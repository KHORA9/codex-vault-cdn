RAYMOND HALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weasel's agility and speed take it in and out of retreats, over\r\nobstacles and across open places in amazingly rapid fashion and are\r\nresponsible for the animal's actions being described as \"quick as a\r\nflash.\" The common long-tailed weasel of the United States measures\r\napproximately a foot and a half in length, of which the tail comprises\r\na third; but the round, slender body is scarcely more than an inch and\r\na half in diameter. Brown above and whitish below in summer dress, the\r\nanimal is sleek as well as lithe and graceful. It is easy to\r\nunderstand, therefore, why the Bavarian name _Schönthierlein_ (pretty\r\nlittle creature) and the Italian name _donnola_ (little lady) were\r\nbestowed upon it. The Spanish name is _comadreja_ (godmother).\r\n\r\nIn the winter, in temperate and northern regions, the coat becomes pure\r\nwhite except for the black tail-tip. In this dress the correct name for\r\nthe animal is ermine, a mammal whose fur is known to all and justly\r\nesteemed, especially for its luster in artificial light, where it is\r\nscarcely excelled in enhancing the beauty of gems and their feminine\r\nwearers.\r\n\r\nIn relation to its weight, the weasel is thought to be unsurpassed, and\r\nperhaps it is unequalled among mammals, in the effectiveness with which\r\nit exercises its carnivorous heritage; it kills with speed and strength\r\na wide variety of animals including many much larger than itself; and\r\nit has been known to attack even man himself when he stood between the\r\nweasel and its intended prey. In structure and temperament it is so\r\nhighly specialized for offense that, when opportunity affords, it\r\nsometimes kills, for storage in its larder, far more than enough to\r\nmeet its immediate needs. After speaking of this tendency, Elliott\r\nCoues (1877:129) has said:\r\n\r\n\"A glance at the physiognomy of the weasels would suffice to betray\r\ntheir character. The teeth are almost of the highest known raptorial\r\ncharacter; the jaws are worked by enormous masses of muscles covering\r\nall the side of the skull. The forehead is low and the nose is sharp;\r\nthe eyes are small, penetrating, cunning, and glitter with an angry\r\ngreen light. There is something peculiar, moreover, in the way that\r\nthis fierce face surmounts a body extraordinarily wiry, lithe, and\r\nmuscular. It ends in a remarkable long and slender neck in such a way\r\nthat it may be held at right angle with the axis of the latter. When\r\nthe creature is glancing around, with the neck stretched up, and flat\r\ntriangular head bent forward, swaying from one side to the other, we\r\ncatch the likeness in a moment--it is the image of a serpent.\" Although\r\nCoues' colorful description more closely links the weasel with the\r\nsymbol of evil than pleases me, his description does emphasize the\r\nraptorial character of the weasel.\r\n\r\nEven though most weasels are intractable as pets, they have a value to\r\nman, as, for instance, when he is plagued by mice. In a field where\r\nmice and other small rodents are so abundant as to damage cultivated\r\ncrops, the weasel is the farmer's best friend. A weasel may inhabit one\r\nden until the rodents thereabouts are almost exterminated in an area\r\ntwo or three hundred yards across; in this way the weasel acts as a\r\ncontrol, locally, as well as a check more widely, on the increase in\r\nsize of populations of kinds of rodents upon which it preys. The\r\nsmaller species are mousers of remarkable efficiency and can, if\r\nnecessary, follow a mouse to the end of the mouse's burrow. The slender\r\nbody allows the weasel to pass through any burrow or hole into which it\r\ncan thrust its head. This ability in an organism as highly specialized\r\nfor killing other animals as is the weasel, has earned for it a bad\r\nname in connection with poultry yards. Authentic instances are recorded\r\nin which a weasel, gaining entrance through a knot-hole to a coop of\r\nyoung chickens, killed several dozen of the fowls. In other instances,\r\nhowever, weasels have lived under buildings close by a poultry yard\r\nwithout even molesting the birds in the slightest; in the latter\r\ninstances the weasels probably were present because there was an\r\nabundant supply of rats and mice. At least three poultry raisers (see\r\npage 214) have encouraged weasels to live in their poultry yards\r\nfeeling that the good they do by destroying rats outweighs the damage\r\ncaused by the occasional weasel which turns to the fowls; the idea is\r\nthat the individual weasel can be eliminated if he becomes destructive.\r\n\r\nAlthough tending to be nocturnal, weasels are almost as active by day\r\nas by night. Their young, numbering 4 to 9, are born in a nest in a\r\nburrow and as with other members of the Order Carnivora, are blind, and\r\nincapable of looking after themselves at the time of birth. In _Mustela\r\nfrenata_ of Montana, breeding occurs in July and August, and the young\r\nare born in the following April and May. Wright (1948A:342) showed that\r\nthe gestation period could not have been less than 337 days in one\r\nindividual and that it averaged 279 (205-337) days in 18 instances.\r\nFindings of the same author (1942B:109) showed that the embryos are\r\nimplanted only 21 to 28 days before the young are born. In the\r\npreceding part of the \"long gestation period, the embryos lie dormant\r\nin the uterus as un-implanted blastocysts. The young female weasel [of\r\n_M. frenata_] mates when 3 or 4 months old.\" Consequently, in the\r\nspring, all females of this species may produce young (Wright,\r\n1942A:348). The circumboreal species _Mustela erminea_ likewise has\r\nbeen shown to have a delayed implantation of the ova. Each of these two\r\nspecies, _M. frenata_ and _M. erminea_, has only one litter per year;\r\nbut the weasel, _Mustela nivalis_, of the Old World seems to lack the\r\ndelayed implantation, in this respect resembling the ferret (subgenus\r\n_Putorius_) as it does also in its ability to have more than one litter\r\nper year (see Deanesly, 1944). The manner of reproduction in the South\r\nAmerican species _M. africana_ and the circumboreal species _M. rixosa_\r\nat this writing is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Mustela_ includes the true weasels, the ferrets and minks.\r\nThe ferrets commonly are treated as a subgenus, _Putorius_, along with\r\nthe Old World polecat. The minks usually are accorded subgeneric\r\ndistinction under the name _Lutreola_, and the true weasels comprise\r\nthe subgenus _Mustela_, the three subgenera together, along with some\r\nother subgenera which are mostly monotypic, comprising the genus\r\n_Mustela_. Considered in this way, the group of true weasels, subgenus\r\n_Mustela_, has a geographic range roughly coextensive with that of the\r\ngenus _Mustela_. This range includes Asia and Europe, Northern Africa,\r\nNorth America and northern South America. Java has its weasel.\r\nAustralia and nearly all the oceanic islands lack weasels, and the\r\nanimals are absent from roughly the southern half of Africa and the\r\nsouthern half of South America. Other small mustelids, weasellike in\r\nshape and with corresponding habits and dentition, take the place of\r\ntrue _Mustela_ in the southern half of Africa and in the corresponding\r\npart of South America.\r\n\r\nIn America the subgenus _Mustela_ occurs from the northernmost land in\r\nArctic America southward to Lake Titicaca in the Andes of South\r\nAmerica, a distance of approximately 6900 miles. _Felis_, I think, is\r\nthe only other genus of land mammals in the western hemisphere that has\r\na geographic range as extensive from north to south. _Felis_ does not\r\nrange so far north but does range farther south. The one species,\r\n_Mustela frenata_, ranges from Lake Titicaca northward to about 57° N\r\nin British Columbia or for approximately 5000 miles in a north to south\r\ndirection and from within the Alpine Arctic Life-zone through the\r\nTropical Life-zone. In North America, weasels occur in almost every\r\ntype of habitat, being absent only in the extremely desert terrain of\r\nwestern Arizona and western Sonora and in adjoining parts of California\r\nand Baja California. Even this area, along the Colorado River, may\r\nsupport some weasels; evidence suggesting that it does so is given in\r\nthe account of _Mustela frenata neomexicana_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALEONTOLOGICAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paleontological record fails to show the precise ancestry of\r\n_Mustela_. The genus has been found in deposits of Pleistocene age,\r\nbut, so far as I can ascertain, not in deposits of earlier times. The\r\nPleistocene remains are not specifically distinct from Recent (living)\r\nspecies, and in only a few instances (see _M. f. latirostra_ and _M. e.\r\nangustidens_) are they even subspecifically distinct from the Recent\r\nweasel living in the same area today. It is true that fossil remains\r\nfrom deposits of several stages of the Tertiary beds have in the past\r\nbeen identified in the literature as _Mustela_, but most of these\r\nidentifications were made many years ago when the generic name\r\n_Mustela_ was used in a far broader and more inclusive sense than it is\r\ntoday and much of the fossil material was so fragmentary that the\r\ngeneric identity could not be ascertained, at least at that time.\r\nBecause the generic identity could not be ascertained, the fossil\r\nmaterial was tentatively assigned to the genus _Mustela_, the \"typical\"\r\ngenus of the family Mustelidae instead of to some other more\r\nspecialized or less well-known genus of the family. To satisfy my\r\ncuriosity about these species of \"_Mustela_\" of a geological age\r\nearlier than the Pleistocene I have personally studied nearly all of\r\nthe original specimens from North America and have found each to be of\r\nsome genus other than _Mustela_. Also, such study as I have been able\r\nto make of the Old World fossils themselves that have been referred to\r\nthe genus _Mustela_ up to 1938, and my study of the illustrations and\r\ndescriptions of the others from there lead to the same conclusion; that\r\nis to say, none that is true _Mustela_ is known up to now from deposits\r\nolder than the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1930 (pp. 146-147), I wrote about the taxonomic position of\r\nthree American genera of fossils (known only from lower jaws), each of\r\nwhich had been previously referred to the genus _Mustela_, I said that\r\nthey pertained \"to that section of the weasel family (Mustelidae)\r\nwhich comprises the polecats, true weasels, ferrets, minks and martens.\r\nThe fossil specimens . . . are smaller than any other later Tertiary\r\nmembers of the group yet described, and are more primitive than any of\r\nthe above mentioned Recent relatives. Of the three extinct genera . . .\r\n_Miomustela_ [Lower Pliocene or Upper Miocene of the Lower Madison\r\nValley, Montana] is the most primitive and _Martinogale_ [Pliocene, 18\r\nmi. SE Goodland, Sherman County, Kansas] is the most advanced. This\r\nview rests largely on the character of M_{=1} which in _Miomustela_ has\r\na deeply basined, short, narrow talonid with a thick, high metaconid\r\nsituated partly posterior to the protoconid. In _Martinogale_ the\r\ntalonid is incipiently trenchant, long, broad, and it has a lesser\r\ndeveloped metaconid which is situated more anterior [ly]. _Pliogale_\r\n[Lower Pliocene, Humboldt County, Nevada] is intermediate in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\"These three forms are of special interest as possible ancestors of the\r\nsubgenus _Mustela_, true weasels. No members of this subgenus, nor\r\nrelated forms which can with any degree of certainty be regarded as\r\ndirectly ancestral to them, have yet been described from Miocene or\r\nPliocene deposits. _Palaeogale_ of the Old World and _Bunaelurus_ of\r\nNorth America, each of Oligocene age, have been placed by Schlosser\r\n(1888, p. 116) and Matthew (1902, p. 137) as members of the primitive\r\ngroup of mustelids ancestral to _Mustela_. This course seems logical;\r\nand with no truly intermediate links between these forms of the\r\nOligocene on the one hand, and _Mustela_ which first appears in the\r\nPleistocene, on the other, more definite statements about ancestral\r\npositions of the small Oligocene forms can hardly be made. The deciding\r\nconsiderations for authors who placed _Palaeogale_ and _Bunaelurus_ as\r\nancestral to _Mustela_ were the absence of a metaconid on M_{1} and the\r\ntrenchant talonid of that tooth. These characters are found also in\r\n_Mustela_. On the other hand certain structures in the basicranial\r\nregion of _Palaeogale_ and more especially of _Bunaelurus_ indicate\r\nthat these genera possibly are not close to the ancestral form of\r\nMustela . . . _Martinogale_ may stand near the ancestral form of\r\n_Mustela_ and . . . _Pliogale_ may be ancestral to _Martinogale_.\r\n_Pliogale_, in turn, may have had an ancestor similar to _Miomustela_.\r\nIf this should prove to be the case, _Palaeogale_ and _Bunaelurus_\r\nmight be regarded as an independent branch which displays merely a\r\nparallelism to _Mustela_ in the loss of the metaconid on M_{1} and the\r\ndevelopment of a trenchant talonid on that tooth. The writer would make\r\nit clear that he does not hold such to be the case. The ancestral\r\nrelation of _Martinogale_ to _Mustela_ is presented merely to show the\r\npossibility, and not the special probability, of such an origin for\r\n_Mustela_. Knowledge of the tympanic bullae and other structures of the\r\nbasicranial region would go far toward answering the question and until\r\nthese structures are known [in mustelids of the Later Tertiary,] some\r\nuncertainty will remain.\"\r\n\r\nAt the present writing I can add to the above statement only a few\r\nfacts. The discovery of better material of _Bunaelurus_ than was\r\navailable to previous workers led Simpson (1946), correctly I think, to\r\nsynonymize _Bunaelurus_ with _Palaeogale_. Simpson figures the cranial\r\nforamina in _Palaeogale_. The differences, between _Palaeogale_ and\r\n_Mustela_, in cranial foramina, possibly are only the result of the\r\nelongation of the tympanic bullae. The bullae of the subgenus _Mustela_\r\nare seen to be much elongated posteriorly if comparison is made with\r\nthe bullae of earlier mustelids. Consequently, it might be concluded\r\nthat there is nothing in the arrangement of the cranial foramina which\r\nwould preclude the derivation of _Mustela_ from _Palaeogale_. However,\r\nthe anterior situation of the carotid foramen--well forward along the\r\nmedial margin of the tympanic bulla--is a character typical of other\r\nmustelids and the posterior location of this foramen in _Palaeogale_\r\nmight indicate that it was not ancestral to _Mustela_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKELETON AND DENTITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outstanding features of a weasel's skeleton are its length and\r\nslenderness. Whereas the length of the vertebral column measured from\r\nthe atlas (the first cervical vertebra) to the last sacral vertebra is\r\n175 per cent of the length of the hind leg (as measured from the head\r\nof the femur to the tip of the longest claw), the corresponding\r\npercentage is only 116 in the raccoon. Stated in another way, the\r\nvertebral column and the hind leg are of approximately equal length in\r\na raccoon, but in a weasel the vertebral column is one and\r\nthree-fourths times as long as the hind leg.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERTEBRAE\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column consists of 7 cervicals, and ordinarily 14\r\nthoracics, 6 lumbars, 3 sacrals and, depending on the species, 11 to 23\r\ncaudals.

Apparently there is also some geographic variation in the\r\nnumber of caudal vertebrae within a species. For example, the one\r\nskeleton seen of _Mustela rixosa eskimo_ (no. 219036, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\nfrom St. Michaels, Alaska) has only 11 caudal vertebrae, whereas in the\r\n11 _Mustela rixosa rixosa_ from Roseau County, Minnesota, the usual\r\nnumber is 15 with extremes of 14 and 16. Similarly specimens of\r\n_Mustela frenata_ from Idaho and California almost always have 1 or 2\r\nmore caudal vertebrae than do individuals of the shorter-tailed\r\nsubspecies of the same species from eastern Kansas.\r\n\r\nOf the vertebrae, only the cervicals, of which there are 7, were found\r\nto be constant in number. In _M. erminea_, two of the seven individuals\r\nin which the anticlinal vertebra was the 12th (instead of the 11th) had\r\n15 instead of the customary 14 thoracic vertebrae. In _M. frenata_,\r\nseven of the twenty-seven individuals in which the anticlinal vertebra\r\nwas the 12th (instead of the 11th) had 15 instead of 14 thoracic\r\nvertebrae. The one _M. erminea_ with a pseudosacral vertebra had only\r\ntwo instead of the customary 3 sacral vertebrae but the same individual\r\nhad 15 thoracic vertebrae. Of the six _M. frenata_ with a pseudosacral\r\nvertebra, two animals had only two instead of three sacral vertebrae.\r\nConceivably, therefore, the pseudosacral vertebra in each of the three\r\ninstances mentioned may represent merely an unfused sacral vertebra,\r\ninstead of a true pseudosacral as occurs in four individuals of _M.\r\nfrenata_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEETH\r\n\r\nIn American weasels, for example in _Mustela frenata_, the permanent\r\ndentition normally is\r\n\r\n  I  3  C  1  P  3  M  1\r\n  -, -, -, -, -, -, -, - or 34 teeth in all. In most respects the\r\n  i  3  c  1  p  3  m  2\r\n\r\ndentition is typical for post-Tertiary mustelids but in several parts\r\nis highly specialized for a diet of flesh, the degree of this\r\nspecialization being second only to that of the cats, family Felidae.\r\nThe outstanding specialization is in the first lower molar, in which,\r\nas in the cats, the internal cusp (metaconid) is completely suppressed\r\nand the heel (talonid) forms an elevated blade for cutting food rather\r\nthan a basin for crushing it. In one sense the tooth is simplified\r\nsince it owes its distinctive form to a reduction in number of parts;\r\nnevertheless, the distinctive form of the lower molar clearly is\r\ncorrelated with a diet of flesh, and the tooth is correctly to be\r\nthought of as the lower blade of a pair of shears; the upper blade is\r\nthe fourth upper premolar. The reduction in size of the second (last)\r\nlower molar and small size of the inner lobe of the one remaining upper\r\nmolar probably are additional modifications for a diet of flesh.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the last two upper molars and last molar in the lower\r\njaw would be expected in any mammal as highly specialized for a diet of\r\nflesh as is the weasel, but these teeth are absent also in other\r\nQuaternary members of the family Mustelidae, many of which are\r\nsubstantially less specialized for a diet of flesh than is the weasel.\r\nTherefore, in the weasel, it is reasonable to regard the absence of\r\nthese teeth more as a heritage than as an indication of a special\r\nadaptation. The absence of a first premolar above and below, as in the\r\nweasel, is to be expected in any carnivore that has the first lower\r\nmolar and fourth upper premolar highly specialized for shearing, but\r\nthe loss of these premolars and the small size of the second premolars\r\nmay be as much the result of a slight shortening of the face as it is a\r\nresult of a lengthening of the third and especially the fourth\r\npremolars. The lengthening of these more posteriorly-situated teeth\r\nwould appear to be an adaptation to a diet of flesh. The cause of the\r\nlengthening of the mentioned teeth and the reason for the absence of\r\nthe first premolars probably will be unknown until the fossil record is\r\nmore complete.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of American species vary little except in size. The absence\r\nof P2 in _Mustela africana_ is the only difference of a qualitative\r\n(presence or absence) nature that was detected. Also, the Central\r\nAmerican subspecies of _Mustela frenata_ exhibit a tendency to early\r\nloss of P2 and thus foreshadow the condition typical of _M. africana_.\r\n\r\nAs a whole the dentition of the weasel exhibits a high degree of\r\nspecialization for a diet of flesh and this specialization is fully as\r\nevident in the deciduous dentition as in the permanent dentition.\r\n\r\nThe deciduous, or milk, dentition, of _Mustela frenata_, as known from\r\nimmature specimens of _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_ and _Mustela\r\nfrenata frenata_ available for this study, is comprised of canines, one\r\non each side above and below, and 3 cheek teeth on each side above and\r\nbelow. See figures 2-9. The upper cheek teeth from anterior to\r\nposterior are: a minute peglike tooth in general similar to the first\r\npremolar of the permanent dentition; a shearing tooth in general\r\nsimilar to P4 of the permanent dentition; and an anteroposteriorly\r\ncompressed tooth in general similar to M1 of the permanent dentition.\r\nIn the lower jaw, behind the canine, there is first a minute peglike\r\ntooth, second a two-rooted tooth similar in general outline to a\r\npermanent third premolar, and finally a shearing tooth corresponding in\r\nfunction to m1 of the permanent dentition.\r\n\r\nNo postnatal specimens which show deciduous incisors have been\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nSelected, outstanding differences between the permanent teeth and the\r\ndeciduous teeth are as follows: In the deciduous teeth the canine above\r\nhas on the posterior face a well-defined ridge extending from the tip\r\nto the cingulum. This ridge is absent or at most faintly indicated in\r\nthe permanent tooth. The lower deciduous canine, in cross section is\r\nseen to have a marked indentation on the anteromedial border in the\r\nregion of the cingulum; this indentation is lacking in the permanent\r\ntooth. The anterior one of the deciduous cheek teeth, both above and\r\nbelow, is single rooted and its crown-surface is only about\r\none-fifteenth as much as that of the anterior premolar of the permanent\r\ndentition. The second deciduous cheek tooth below has two roots,\r\nusually fused, and differs from p4 of the permanent dentition in having\r\nthe tip of the principal cusp more recurved, in having the anterior\r\nbasal cusp better developed and the posterior heel less well developed.\r\n\r\nThe second deciduous cheek tooth above corresponds in function and\r\ngeneral plan of construction to P4 of the permanent dentition but\r\ndiffers from that tooth in the more pronounced protostyle, longer\r\ntritocone, more posteriorly located deuterocone and as noted by Leche\r\n(1915:322) separation of the protocone and tritocone by a notch. The\r\nthird upper deciduous tooth has a single cusp internally and two cusps\r\nlaterally. Thus it reverses the relation of parts seen in M1 where the\r\ninternal moiety is larger than the lateral or buccal moiety. The third\r\ndeciduous tooth below differs from m1 in very much shorter talonid and\r\nseparation of the paraconid from the protoconid by a deeper notch.\r\n\r\nAll the features in which the last two deciduous teeth, both above and\r\nbelow, are described as differing from their functional counterparts in\r\nthe permanent dentition, are features found in the permanent teeth of\r\nprimitive fossil mustelids and certain fossil and Recent viverrids.\r\nEven so, taking into account Leche's (1915) work, which shows that the\r\nmilk teeth of some carnivores have structures lacking in the\r\ncorresponding permanent teeth of the same individual animal and also in\r\nthe teeth of genera that seem to be ancestral, a person suspects that\r\nsome of the structural features mentioned above are not inheritances\r\nof ancestral conditions but rather specializations of the milk\r\ndentition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 2-9.

Occlusolingual views of lower teeth of adult and juvenile\r\nrespectively.]\r\n\r\nIn other deciduous teeth there is clearer evidence of more\r\nspecialization for a diet of flesh in the deciduous teeth than in the\r\npermanent teeth. For example, the upper carnassial of the milk\r\ndentition is even more highly sectorial than is the permanent tooth\r\nand strikingly like that of some of the cats. The lower tooth that is\r\neffective in the shearing action bears no more trace of the metaconid\r\nthan does the permanent first lower molar. These features of the\r\ndeciduous dentition suggest that it is more specialized for a diet of\r\nflesh than is the permanent dentition. If this be the fact, it may seem\r\nespecially remarkable because the commonly employed term \"milk teeth\"\r\nsuggests that the animal makes but little or no use of these teeth in\r\nthe short time that they are in place. Accordingly, the student may\r\ncredit the form of these teeth more to some indirect effects of\r\ninheritance than to natural selection acting directly upon the teeth.\r\nBut, after all, natural selection probably is responsible for the form\r\nof these teeth as is indicated by the observations of Hamilton\r\n(1933:318-325). He found that these milk teeth are used for eating\r\nsolid food as soon as the principal shearing teeth are in place. This\r\nis three weeks after birth and before all of the deciduous teeth have\r\nbroken through the gums. These shearing teeth are used for almost two\r\nmonths before being replaced by the permanent teeth and it is,\r\ntherefore, evident that natural selection could operate to fully as\r\ngreat a degree in determining the form of the deciduous teeth as it may\r\nwith the permanent teeth.\r\n\r\nHamilton (1933:325-326) found that the permanent dentition was complete\r\nat 75 days after birth in captive specimens of _Mustela frenata\r\nnoveboracensis_. In the same subspecies, he noted 28 days after birth\r\nthat the canines and carnassial teeth [second deciduous cheek tooth\r\nabove and third below] had erupted through the gums. Animals 45 days\r\nold, Hamilton found, were losing the milk dentition, and had the gums\r\nbroken through by several of the permanent cheek teeth.\r\n\r\nStudy of the cleaned skulls available of juveniles indicates that the\r\ndeciduous teeth which persist longest are, on each side of the mouth,\r\nthe second cheek tooth above and the third cheek tooth below. These\r\nteeth persist until after the permanent P4 and m1 have come into use.\r\nThese permanent teeth are situated immediately behind their functional\r\ncounterparts of the milk dentition. P3 and p4 are the teeth of the\r\npermanent dentition which ultimately push out the last milk teeth to be\r\nlost. Accordingly, in the permanent dentition, P4 and M1 appear before\r\nP3 does, and m1 and m2 make their appearance before p4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPARITY IN NUMBERS OF MALES AND FEMALES (IN ZOOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question has frequently been asked why twice as many male as female\r\nweasels are captured. This is the proportion in research collections,\r\nas may be seen from table no. 2, and I am convinced that the specimens\r\nin these collections are saved in approximately the same proportion as\r\nthat in which they are caught. Although it might be assumed, upon first\r\nconsideration, that there are twice as many males as females in nature,\r\nselective factors enter into the catch. For example, because a male\r\nweasel is approximately twice as heavy as a female, it may be necessary\r\nfor him, in a given length of time, to travel twice as far as the\r\nfemale to obtain the required amount of food with the result that a\r\ngiven number of traps or snares will catch twice as many males as\r\nfemales. Indeed, Glover (1943B:8) shows that, on the average, in\r\n_Mustela frenata noveboracensis_ in Pennsylvania, the male actually\r\ndoes travel slightly more than twice as far as the female (704 feet\r\nversus 346 feet). From table no. 2, it may be seen that in most winter\r\nmonths the ratio is 3 males to one female. This ratio is reasonable\r\nenough, in view of what has been said, if it is considered also that\r\nthe lighter weight of the female permits her safely to step on the pans\r\nof traps that would be sprung by heavier males.\r\n\r\nIf in the breeding season, which is April through August in _M.\r\nfrenata_, the female is passive and if the male is restlessly searching\r\nfor her, he may thus increase still more his chances of being caught in\r\ntraps set for weasels.\r\n\r\nMy own studies of live weasels in nature indicate that in the season\r\nwhen females are attending young which are half grown, or larger, the\r\nadult male weasels live singly in dens of their own, separate and apart\r\nfrom the females and their young (Hamilton, 1933:328, records adult\r\nmales living with the female and her young, but possibly this was when\r\nthe young were less than half grown). Perhaps these males at that time\r\ntravel no farther than is necessary to obtain food for themselves.\r\nFemales, at this time, forage not only to meet their own needs, but for\r\nfood to supply their young as well. At this time, in May and June, as\r\nmay be seen from table no. 2, almost as many adult females as adult\r\nmales _are_ caught. The reason why only relatively more females than in\r\nother months, instead of actually more females than males, are caught\r\nat this time probably is that the adult males also are extraordinarily\r\nactive at this time because they are in breeding condition. Perhaps\r\nthe explanation in part is to be found in the lesser weight of the\r\nfemale (approximately half of the male's weight) which, as indicated\r\nabove, permits her to step on the pan of a steel trap without springing\r\nit whereas the heavier male does spring the trap and as a consequence\r\nis caught. Hamilton (1933:299-300), who mentions this selective factor,\r\nfound an equal number of males and females in the three newly born\r\nlitters that came under his observation.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2\r\n\r\nSpecimens of _Mustela frenata_ (north of the range of _M. f. frenata_)\r\narranged by sex and under each sex by age\r\n\r\n  KEY:\r\n  A: adult [M]\r\n  B: [M] ad., % of total adults\r\n  C: subadult [M]\r\n  D: young [M]\r\n  E: juvenal [M]\r\n  F: total number of [M]\r\n  G: [M] % of total\r\n  H: adult [F]\r\n  I: [F] ad., % of total adults\r\n  J: subadult [F]\r\n  K: young [F]\r\n  L: juvenal [F]\r\n  M: total number of [F]\r\n  N: [F], % of total\r\n  O: total number of [M] and [F]\r\n  P: total number of adults, [M] and [F]\r\n\r\n           /-----------Male---------\\/--------Female--------\\\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n           | A | B | C | D | E| F | G| H | I| J| K | L| M | N|   O | P\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  May      | 29| 55|  4| 14| 7| 54|59| 24|45| 1|  9| 3| 37|41|   91| 53\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  June     | 42| 53| 14| 40| 8| 97|59| 38|47| 4| 25| 2| 69|41|  166| 80\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  July     | 59| 70| 18| 55| 2|130|59| 25|30| 5| 58| 2| 90|41|  220| 84\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  August   | 40| 77| 23| 55|..|113|74| 12|23| 2| 25|..| 39|26|  152| 52\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  September| 15| 79| 25| 12| 1| 51|75|  4|21| 4|  9|..| 17|25|   68| 19\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  October  | 11| 58| 46|  7|..| 43|66|  8|42|13|  1|..| 22|34|   65| 19\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  November | 41| 70| 48|  1|..| 88|73| 18|30|12|  2| 1| 33|27|  121| 59\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  December | 59| 69| 43|  1|..|108|73| 26|31|15|...|..| 41|27|  149| 85\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  January  | 80| 69| 32|  2| 1|126|72| 36|31|14|...|..| 50|28|  176|116\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  February | 45| 66| 19|  5|..| 82|73| 23|34| 4|  3|..| 30|27|  112| 68\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  March    | 38| 72|  2|...|..| 57|70| 15|28| 8|  1|..| 24|30|   81| 53\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n  April    | 30| 67|  2|  4| 3| 39|67| 15|33|..|  2| 2| 19|33|   58| 45\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n    Totals |489| 67|281|196|22|988|68|244|33|82|135|10|471|32|1,459|733\r\n  ---------+---+---+---+---+--+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+-----+---\r\n\r\nI suppose that in nature there are approximately equal numbers of male\r\nand female weasels and further suppose that the selective factors which\r\ncause more males than females to be caught are the greater distances\r\ntraveled by the males and their greater weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a late stage in the preparation of this manuscript a total of 5,457\r\nspecimens had been examined. For the most part these were conventional\r\nstudy-specimens; that is to say, they were stuffed skins with the\r\nskulls separate and each was accompanied by the customary data as to\r\nlocality of capture, date of capture, name of collector, external\r\nmeasurements and sex recorded on the labels by the collectors. Skulls\r\nunaccompanied by skins, nevertheless, comprised a large share of the\r\ntotal and a small proportion was made up of skins unaccompanied by\r\nskulls, mounted specimens, skeletons, and entire animals preserved in\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n     It was the recognition of this need for specimens from extensive\r\n     areas from which no specimens previously had been collected that\r\n     influenced me, approximately a year after the study was begun, to\r\n     allot for it a long span of time. The procedure adopted, in\r\n     general, was to study the weasels of one species from a given\r\n     geographic area in so far as the material warranted, then lay this\r\n     aside until additional critical material could be obtained, and\r\n     finally, some months or a year later, complete the account. In\r\n     this fashion the manuscript of the American weasels received my\r\n     attention in each of the past twenty-five years (September, 1926\r\n     to date of publication). This is a confession of fact rather than\r\n     a recommendation of procedure. This type of procedure unduly\r\n     delays the diffusion of knowledge and for a variety of reasons\r\n     justifiably annoys other students of the subject. Nevertheless,\r\n     many gaps have been filled that otherwise would have remained\r\n     open. Although specimens to solve several problems still remain to\r\n     be collected and studied, it seems that a point of diminishing\r\n     returns has now been reached, which, in fairness to all concerned,\r\n     calls for publication of the results so far obtained.\r\n\r\n     For assistance in the entire undertaking, I am more indebted to\r\n     Miss Annie M. Alexander than to any other one person; she provided\r\n     the means by which specimens from critical areas were obtained,\r\n     made it possible to examine the European collections, and assisted\r\n     in other ways. The late Professor Joseph Grinnell and Mr. Charles\r\n     D. Bunker, among others, gave truly valuable encouragement and\r\n     assistance.\r\n\r\n     Collections containing weasels which were examined in the study\r\n     here reported upon were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nAcad.

After the materials in North American\r\n     collections were assembled, special effort, with considerable\r\n     success, was made in each of several winters, to obtain specimens\r\n     from areas not previously represented in collections.\r\n\r\n     To the many persons who were in charge of the collections\r\n     consulted, to those who at my request sought critical specimens,\r\n     and to those who assisted in various stages of assembling data and\r\n     in preparation of the manuscript, I am grateful indeed. Likewise,\r\n     I am deeply appreciative of the grants-in-aid received from the\r\n     Carnegie Institution of Washington, the University of California\r\n     Chapter of Sigma Xi, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation\r\n     and the Kansas University Endowment Association. I am mindful also\r\n     of an obligation to those who appropriated funds, by legislative\r\n     action, for research use by The University of California and The\r\n     University of Kansas.\r\n\r\n     For assistance with the illustrations I am indebted to the late\r\n     Major Allan Brooks for Plate 1, to Mrs. Mary Blos for figures\r\n     25-31, to Miss Ann Murray for figures 11-13, to Mr. W. C. Matthews\r\n     for all the photographs, to Mrs. Freda L. Abernathy for figures\r\n     2-9, 18-22, 24, and for retouching all the photographs except the\r\n     following which were retouched by Mrs. Virginia Unruh: figs. _d_\r\n     of plates 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17; figs. _i_ of plates 5, 6, 7;\r\n     figs, _h_, _j_, _k_ of plate 7; figs. _f_ and _g_ of plates 12 and\r\n     13; and figs. _c_ and _d_ of plate 14. To Mrs. Unruh I am further\r\n     indebted for figures 1, 16, 17 and 23 and for much terminal\r\n     assistance with preparing most of the illustrations for the\r\n     engraver.\r\n\r\nThe methods of study, after specimens were assembled, included first\r\ncomparisons of specimens of like age and sex from each of several\r\nlocalities to ascertain the constant features by which full species\r\nwere distinguishable, one from the other. For example, it was found\r\nthat in every individual from Trout Lake, Washington, of the species\r\nhere designated _Mustela erminea_, the postglenoidal length of the\r\nskull amounted to more than 47 per cent of the condylobasal length\r\nwhereas it was less than 47 per cent in all individuals here designated\r\nas _Mustela frenata_, from the same locality. Testing of specimens from\r\nother localities by means of this and other selected characters\r\npermitted the outlining of the geographic ranges of the full\r\n\"species-groups.\" By comparing specimens of other nominal species and\r\nby examining specimens from localities geographically intermediate\r\nbetween the nominal species, I found intergradation and therefore\r\narranged the nominal species as subspecies of a single species.\r\nIntergradation here is understood to be the result of crossbreeding in\r\nnature between two kinds of animals in the area where the geographic\r\nranges of the two kinds meet. Presence of intergradation between two\r\nkinds of weasels was basis for according them subspecific rank. Absence\r\nof intergradation in nature at every place where the geographic ranges\r\nof two kinds met or overlapped, and absence of intergradation by way of\r\nsome other kind, or chain of kinds, was basis for according each of the\r\ntwo kinds full specific rank. By thus applying the test of\r\nintergradation, or lack of it, I found that there were four full\r\nspecies of weasels, of the subgenus _Mustela_, in all of the Americas.\r\n\r\nNext, the specimens of one species were arranged in trays in a\r\ngeographic sequence. The specimens from any one locality were\r\nsegregated by sex and under one sex from one place were arranged from\r\noldest to youngest, that is to say by age. The four series with the\r\nlargest numbers of individuals of a given age were selected. Seventeen\r\ncranial measurements and three external measurements were recorded for\r\neach individual of each of these four series. For each measurement, the\r\ncoefficient of variation, standard deviation and probable error were\r\ncomputed. The four samples subjected to such analysis were a series of\r\nadult males, one of adult females, one of subadult males and one of\r\nsubadult females. Also, studies of each sex were made to ascertain\r\nseasonal changes in pelage. After data were obtained on ontogenetic\r\n(age) variation, secondary sexual variation, seasonal variation, and\r\ndegree of individual variation by studying specimens in the manner\r\ndescribed above, tests were made for subspecific (geographic) variation\r\nby comparing series of specimens of like sex, age and season, from\r\ndifferent localities. For each one of several geographically variable\r\nfeatures noted, a map was prepared for animals of each sex. When all\r\nthe data thus obtained were codified, subspecific ranges were, in a\r\nsense automatically, obtained. On the resulting map showing geographic\r\nranges of subspecies for a species, a type locality was accurately\r\nplotted for each name that had been applied to the species, and names\r\nthen were applied in accordance with the international rules of\r\nzoölogical nomenclature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nVariation with Age\r\n\r\nThe kind of variation which results from increasing age has been dealt\r\nwith extensively for the skull (of the Old World _Mustela erminea_) by\r\nHensel (1881) and for the external features and to some extent for the\r\nskull by Hamilton (1933) in the North American forms _M. erminea\r\ncicognanii_ and _M. frenata noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\nThe young of both _erminea_ and _frenata_ are hairless and blind at\r\nbirth. In _M. frenata noveboracensis_, the eyes open on approximately\r\nthe 37th day. When 2 to 4 months old, the tail is pointed at the tip.\r\nThis is because the terminal hair of the tail, including the black tip,\r\nis short and lies flat on the tail. In subadults and adults the hair on\r\nthe terminal part of the tail is as long as that on the basal part, and\r\nthe tail appears to be of uniform diameter all the way out to the end.\r\n\r\nIn the western subspecies of _M. frenata_, and in its tropical\r\nsubspecies, animals so young as to have pointed tails commonly have the\r\nunderparts of the body more intensely colored than do adults. The young\r\nmay have salmon-colored instead of yellowish fur on the underparts.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, in animals that have attained approximately adult\r\nproportions--which appears to be at approximately 6 months of age in\r\nmales--there are no variations which are ascribable to increasing age\r\nin the color-pattern or pelage that cause the systematist to confuse\r\nspecies or subspecies.\r\n\r\nOf the several parts of the skull in juvenal animals, the braincase and\r\nwidth of the posterior part of the palate are most nearly of the size\r\nattained in the adult, the facial part of the skull at birth is the\r\nleast developed, and the interorbital region is, in relation to its\r\nultimate adult size, intermediate in stage of development. The\r\npermanent teeth are acquired when the animal is approximately eleven\r\nweeks old.\r\n\r\nFour age groups, based on characters of the dentition and skull, have\r\nbeen recognized. They are:\r\n\r\n     Juvenile.--One or more deciduous (milk) teeth present. Birth to\r\n     three months of age.\r\n\r\n     Young.--Sutures widely open between the maxillae and nasals and\r\n     between the premaxillae and nasals. Three to seven and a half\r\n     months of age.\r\n\r\n     Subadult.--Sutures between maxillae and nasals visible but\r\n     indistinct. Seven and a half to ten months of age.\r\n\r\n     Adult.--Bones of rostrum coalesced with no traces of sutures\r\n     visible to the naked eye. More than ten months old.\r\n\r\nThe skull as a whole increases in size until the animal is two-thirds\r\nof the way through the stage designated as young. After this time the\r\nwidth of the rostrum, as measured across the hamular processes of the\r\nlacrimals, increases until approximately a third of the way through\r\nadulthood. The interorbital breadth decreases from late subadulthood to\r\nadulthood and even in adults there appears to be a slight decrease in\r\nthis part of the skull with increasing age.\r\n\r\nThe average zoölogist will readily distinguish skulls of juveniles and\r\nyoung from adults but usually fails to distinguish subadults from\r\nadults. Nevertheless, subadults must be distinguished from adults if\r\ngeographic variation is to be measured accurately. The reason for this\r\nis that such differences in the form (not size) of the skull as result\r\nfrom increasing age equal and often exceed the differences of a\r\ngeographic sort which serve for distinguishing subspecies that have\r\nadjoining geographic ranges. All sutures in the skull, except those\r\nbetween the tympanic bulla and the braincase, and those on the dorsal\r\nface of the rostrum, are obliterated while the animal is a subadult.\r\nMost kinds of mammals retain sutures throughout life or until the\r\nanimals are well into adulthood. Therefore, skulls of weasels offer\r\nfewer features for estimating age than do those of most mammals and the\r\nskulls of weasels that are subadults or older are more difficult to\r\nclassify accurately as to age than are the skulls of most other\r\nmammals. More reliance on shape of entire skull and less reliance on\r\nextent and shape of any individual bone is necessary in estimating the\r\nage of a weasel. Wright (1947:344) shows that the weight of the baculum\r\n(os penis) is a certain means of differentiating adults from males of\r\nlesser age. When approximately eleven months old, _Mustela frenata\r\noribasus_ of western Montana molts from the white winter coat into the\r\nbrown summer coat. At that time spermatogenesis starts for the first\r\ntime and the weight of the baculum increases from less than 30\r\nmilligrams to more than 52 milligrams.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn and early winter, most of the specimens are subadults.\r\nOrdinarily the few adults obtained in these seasons can easily be\r\nsegregated from the subadults because ontogenetic development in the\r\ntwelve additional months of life of each of the older animals has\r\nobliterated the sutures on the rostrum, heightened (vertically) and\r\nlengthened (anteriorly) the sagittal crest, widened the rostrum, and\r\nproduced still other changes in form that are revealed by direct\r\ncomparison of specimens of the two ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary Sexual Variation\r\n\r\nThe secondary sexual variation, which has been detected, is in size of\r\nthe animal, relative length of the tail and shape of the skull. The\r\nfemale is the smaller. In the small _Mustela rixosa_ and apparently in\r\n_Mustela africana_ the secondary sexual difference in size is\r\nrelatively slight. In _Mustela frenata_ and _Mustela erminea_, males\r\nare approximately twice as heavy as females, the degree of difference\r\nvery definitely depending upon the subspecies. For example, in _M. e.\r\nrichardsonii_ the recorded weights are 175 and 69 grams as opposed to\r\n81 and 54 grams in _M. e. cicognanii_. In general, within one species\r\nthe greatest difference in size of males and females is in those\r\nsubspecies in which the animals are of large size. The secondary sexual\r\nvariation in size is much more than the individual variation in either\r\nsex. The same is not true of secondary sexual difference in length of\r\nthe tail (relative to the length of the head and body), which in\r\neighteen subspecies of _M. erminea_ is from 1 to 7 per cent longer in\r\nmales than in females. In two subspecies, _M. e. haidarum_ and _M. e.\r\nolympica_, the tail is a fraction of a per cent the longer in females\r\nif we may rely upon the few specimens for which collectors'\r\nmeasurements are available.\r\n\r\nIn both _M. erminea_ and _M. frenata_ the skull of the female is\r\napproximately 45 per cent lighter than that of the male, or put in the\r\nopposite way, the skull of the male is 83 per cent heavier than the\r\nskull of the female. The difference in this respect varies greatly\r\ndepending on the subspecies. For example, the skull of the male is 127\r\nper cent heavier than that of the female in _M. e. richardsonii_ but\r\nonly 33 per cent heavier in _M. e. anguinae_. In _Mustela frenata_, the\r\nsubspecies _noveboracensis_ shows most sexual dimorphism in weight of\r\nskull (3.6 and 1.7 grams) and _olivacea_ the least (5.3 and 3.8 grams).\r\nIn general, the difference in this respect is less in subspecies the\r\nindividuals of which are of small size.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as might be expected, the secondary sexual variation in\r\nweight of the skull is less in _M. rixosa_, individuals of which are of\r\nsmall size, than in _M. erminea_ or than in _M. frenata_, in general of\r\nlarger size. Nevertheless, in _M. africana_, in which the individuals\r\nare of large size, there appears to be less sexual dimorphism in weight\r\nof the skull than in _M. frenata_ or than in _M. erminea_, although it\r\nshould be remarked that there are too few data for _M. africana_ to\r\nallow of forming a trustworthy conclusion concerning the amount of\r\nsecondary sexual variation in that species.\r\n\r\nThe secondary sexual variation in shape of the skull consists of a\r\nslenderness in the female. In relation to the basilar length the spread\r\nof the zygomatic arches is more in males and, except in the one\r\nsubspecies _M. f. altifrontalis_, the rostrum is broader. Also the\r\ninterorbital region is relatively broader in males of most subspecies.\r\nIn most subspecies of both _M. frenata_ and _M. erminea_ the tympanic\r\nbullae are relatively (to the basilar length) longer in females. The\r\nmaximum sexual dimorphism occurs in _M. erminea arctica_ and the\r\nminimum dimorphism in _M. e. haidarum_, _M. e. anguinae_ and _M. e.\r\nmuricus_. Taking into account all of the subspecies of each of the\r\nNorth American species, the shape of the skull differs most in _M.\r\nerminea_ and least in _M. frenata_. In the latter species the greatest\r\ndifference in shape of the skull, as was true also of its weight, is in\r\nthe subspecies _M. f. noveboracensis_. In these two subspecies, _M. f.\r\nnoveboracensis_ and _M. e. arctica_, in addition to the secondary\r\nsexual variation already mentioned in the skull, females have the\r\nbraincase smoother and more rounded, the postorbital-, mastoid-, and\r\nlacrimal-processes relatively smaller, and the ventral face of the\r\ntympanic bulla at its anterior margin more nearly flush with the floor\r\nof the braincase.\r\n\r\nIn the weasels, subgenus _Mustela_, the disparity in size of the two\r\nsexes is almost or quite as much as in any other fissiped carnivore. It\r\nis because of this large degree of difference that the skulls of the\r\ntwo sexes are described separately in the following systematic\r\naccounts. The need for such treatment was recognized by Reinhold Hensel\r\n(1881:127) more than sixty years ago when he wrote in the introduction\r\nto his \"Craniologische Studien,\" of _Mustela_, as follows: \". . . die\r\nGeschlechtsdifferenzen am Schädel vieler Säugethiere . . . so gross\r\nsind, dass man diese wie Schädel verschiedener species behandeln muss,\r\nwährend in anderen Ordnungen (Rosores, Edentaten) die Schädel solche\r\nUnterschiede nichtzeigen.\" In the past, failure to appreciate the large\r\namount of secondary sexual variation has resulted in erroneous\r\ndeductions as regards characters of certain geographic races and has\r\nbeen the cause of some nomenclatural confusion, as for example, in\r\n_Mustela frenata macrura_, where the female was named as a separate\r\nspecies (_Mustela jelskii_).\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividual Variation\r\n\r\nIndividual variation is here considered to be the variation in one\r\nspecies which can occur between offspring of a single pair of parents,\r\nafter variation ascribable to differences in age, sex, and season is\r\nexcluded. Individual variation, therefore, is a term here used in a\r\ncomposite sense; it includes variations which probably represent\r\ndifferent genetic strains within certain populations and variations\r\ninduced within one generation by environmental factors.\r\n\r\nIn skulls of weasels, the individual variation in size is more than it\r\nis in relative proportions. Hensel (_op. cit._) has stressed that\r\nweasels, like other carnivores, produced \"dwarfed\" individuals more\r\nthan do herbivorous mammals. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this\r\nview, but can say that individual variation is not greater than in some\r\nother fissiped carnivores. Impressions to the contrary probably result\r\nlargely from failure to recognize age-variation. When skulls of a large\r\nseries from any one locality are arranged first by sex, and under each\r\nsex according to probable age on the basis of extension anteriorly of\r\nthe sagittal crest and of degree of postorbital constriction,\r\nindividual variation is seen to be less than a cursory examination,\r\neven of only one sex, would suggest.\r\n\r\nStudy of a large series of one age of one sex of one species from one\r\nlocality shows that some parts, of the skull for example, vary more\r\nthan other parts. In illustration, among 22 male topotypes of _Mustela\r\nfrenata washingtoni_ the least interorbital breadth varied 25 per cent\r\n(9.0 mm. to 12 mm.) whereas the length of the tooth-rows varied only\r\n13.3 per cent (15.6 mm. to 18.0 mm.). In color the individual variation\r\ndefinitely is more in areas of intergradation between subspecies than\r\nin other areas. Details of one such instance of intergradation are\r\ngiven in the account of _Mustela frenata spadix_.\r\n\r\nStatements to the effect that there is much individual variation in the\r\ncolor of weasels, were made mostly fifty years or so ago by writers who\r\nhad but few specimens from widely separated localities. Where marked\r\nclimatic differences exist between localities only a few miles apart,\r\nmarked differences occur in coloration of the weasels from the\r\ndifferent localities. Much of what formerly was mistaken for individual\r\nvariation now proves to be geographic variation. Individual variation\r\nactually is of slight amount in comparison with that in mammals\r\ngenerally. Differences in size and relative proportions of parts\r\nusually are correlated with geographic differences in color. The color\r\ndoes fade slightly in the period between molts. Also as a result of the\r\nseasonal color change, in autumn along the upper margin of the Austral\r\nLife-zone, some individuals become white whereas others become white on\r\nonly the underparts, the upper parts changing only to lighter brown.\r\nProbably it would be correct to say that this variation was a\r\ncombination of seasonal and individual variation rather than either one\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, individual variation is not the same in all\r\nspecies or subspecies. For example, p2 is always absent in _Mustela\r\nafricana_ and always present in certain subspecies of _M. frenata_. In\r\nsome other subspecies of _M. frenata_, p2 is absent approximately as\r\noften as present. In the writer's experience, when only a few specimens\r\nare available for comparison, individual variation is more difficult to\r\ndistinguish from specific and subspecific (geographic) variation than\r\nis age-variation or secondary sexual variation.\r\n\r\nAmong the larger series of specimens examined, only one instance of\r\nwhat might be called a mutation in the old sense of a large, sudden\r\nchange, was detected. That was the loss of the second lower molar in\r\nmany (less than a third) of the specimens from Newfoundland. The six\r\ninstances of abnormal coloration described on pages 41 to 43, might be\r\nregarded as mutations of large magnitude but no evidence was found of\r\nrepetition of an abnormality in any one population. Otherwise, in\r\nevery instance where plotted, the manifestations of a variation\r\narranged themselves about the mean in such a way as to form a smooth,\r\nunimodal curve.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeasonal Variation\r\n\r\nWhen subspecific and specific variations are the objectives of study,\r\nseasonal variation must be understood, in order to be excluded from\r\nconsideration, in the same way that variations ascribable to age, sex\r\nand individualism must be understood in order to be excluded from\r\nconsideration. In weasels, change in color of the pelage is the\r\nseasonal variation most important for the systematist to understand.\r\nOther seasonal variations in the pelage are hairiness versus nakedness\r\nof the pads of the feet, length of the pelage on the body, and possibly\r\nthe density of the pelage on the body. In the northern half of North\r\nAmerica, roughly speaking, seasonal change in color is so pronounced\r\n(white in winter and brown in summer) as to be easily recognized. South\r\nof this area, in the Austral and Sonoran life-zones, the color of the\r\nwinter pelage differs only slightly from that of the summer pelage. In\r\nthese more southern latitudes the winter pelage in almost all\r\nsubspecies is of lighter color than the summer pelage and has a smoky\r\nsuffusion. With material of the two seasons in hand for comparison,\r\nclose attention to the variation will permit the systematist to\r\nrecognize the difference in shade of brown as seasonal variation and\r\nnot geographic or specific variation. Farther south still, in the\r\nTropical Life-zone, seasonal difference in color was not detected in\r\nthe material studied. Seasonal change in color is discussed in the\r\nsection immediately following.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariation in Coloration and Molt\r\n\r\nIn all American weasels (subgenus _Mustela_) the color, at least in\r\nsummer, is brown with more or less white or whitish on the underparts.\r\nIn one species, _Mustela africana_, there is a longitudinal stripe of\r\nbrown on the middle of the light-colored underparts; this stripe is\r\nabsent in each of the other three American species. Two species, _M.\r\nerminea_ and _M. frenata_, always have a black tip on the tail. Of the\r\nother two species, _M. africana_ lacks the black tip and _M. rixosa_\r\nmay or may not have a few black hairs in the tip of its tail. White or\r\nlight yellowish facial markings occur in subspecies of _M. frenata_\r\nfrom the southwestern United Stated to Central America. Subspecies\r\nhaving the most extensive light-colored facial markings have the\r\nremainder of the upper part of the head black. In weasels without light\r\nfacial markings the upper parts of the head all are brown. In the two\r\nspecies, _M. erminea_ and _M. frenata_, the extent to which the light\r\ncolor of the underparts extends down the insides of the legs and out on\r\nthe underside of the tail, or the absence of light color on these\r\nparts, is a matter of geographic variation. The same can be said for\r\n_M. rixosa_ except that first its tail is unicolored and second\r\nindividual variation as well as geographic variation accounts for the\r\ncolor pattern on the underparts and legs in animals from the\r\nsoutheastern part of the range of the species.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the coloration of weasels is the winter\r\nwhitening. This occurs in the northern part of North America in each of\r\nthe three species of weasels found on that continent. The black tip of\r\nthe tail in _M. erminea_ and _M. frenata_ remains black in winter. If\r\nan individual of _M. rixosa_ has black hairs on the tip of its tail in\r\nsummer, there are thought to be black hairs there also in winter.\r\nOtherwise the winter pelage is all white in northern areas in each of\r\nthe three species. In this white winter coat the animal is known as\r\nermine.\r\n\r\nThe underlying cause seems to be protective coloration. At any rate,\r\nweasels are always white in winter if they are from areas where snow\r\nlies on the ground all winter, every winter, or almost every winter;\r\nand they are always brown if from areas where there is never, or\r\nrarely, snow in winter. The changes in color are effected by molt, one\r\nin autumn and one in spring. Animals that are brown in winter undergo\r\nthe same two molts as do those that are white in winter. The capacity\r\nto acquire a white coat or a brown coat in winter is an hereditary\r\nmatter just as one man grows red hair and another grows black hair. In\r\nthe weasels, however, all individuals in the north turn white in winter\r\nand if one that was born there is kept through successive winters in\r\nthe warmer south where there is no snow, he will still turn white each\r\nwinter. A weasel born in a southern area, where all are brown in\r\nwinter, molts into a brown (not white) winter coat even when kept in a\r\ncold, snowy, northern area where native weasels of the same species all\r\nturn white. Obviously, therefore, neither snow nor temperature is an\r\nimmediate cause and, as we have said, the color in winter is a matter\r\nof heredity. The time of the molt, we now know, is determined by the\r\namount of light. When nights grow longer and days shorter, a point is\r\nreached at which the lesser light received through the eyes causes the\r\npituitary gland to cease producing a gonadotropic hormone. Directly or\r\nindirectly, the lack of this hormone stimulates molt and, probably\r\nenzyme action, or the lack of it, causes the melanoblasts of the cells\r\nin the hair follicle to be without pigment. Hence the hair grown from a\r\nfollicle under such conditions lacks pigment (melanin) and is white. In\r\nspring, as the days grow longer and the nights shorter, the increasing\r\namount of light received day by day through the eyes stimulates the\r\npituitary gland to produce the gonadotropic hormone which directly or\r\nindirectly, stimulates molt and, probably by enzyme action, the\r\nmelanoblasts are caused to be present in cells of the hair follicle and\r\nthe melanoblasts provide granules of melanin pigment which are\r\nincorporated in cells of the growing hair. These granules of pigment\r\ngive the hair its color.\r\n\r\nEvidence in support of this hypothesis is given below.\r\n\r\nAlong the Pacific Coast from British Columbia southward, _M. erminea_\r\n(see fig. 25 on page 95) is brown in winter. This is an area where snow\r\nrarely falls and the temperature in winter ordinarily is above\r\nfreezing. In the remaining part of the American range of this species\r\nthe temperature in winter is below freezing much of the time and snow\r\nremains throughout the winter or for long periods. In this colder part\r\nof the animal's range, only white coats occur in winter. _M. frenata_\r\nlikewise has a white coat in winter in the part of its geographic range\r\nwhere snow and freezing temperatures prevail throughout most of the\r\nwinter and a brown coat in warmer, snowless areas to the southward and\r\nalong the Pacific Coast. The third species, _M. rixosa_, exhibits a\r\ncorresponding correlation between coat color and climate. On the\r\nAsiatic continent, several species, including _M. erminea_, provide\r\nparallel correlations and nowhere are there any exceptions for the\r\nsubgenus _Mustela_. These data are an important part of the material on\r\nwhich we have based the induction that the underlying cause of seasonal\r\nchange in color is a need for protective coloration.\r\n\r\nAs regards molt, most naturalists who have written upon the subject\r\nregard it as responsible for the change from the white winter coat to\r\nthe brown summer coat. However, the change from brown summer coat to\r\nwhite winter coat has been thought by several writers to be effected by\r\nchange in coloration of the individual hairs. Among those holding this\r\nopinion there may be cited Bell (1874:197) in reference to _Mustela\r\nerminea_, and Coues (1877:123) in reference to American specimens to\r\nwhich he applied the same name. More lately Hadwen (1929) has taken\r\nthis same view, and Gunn (1932) also discusses the possibility of the\r\nhairs changing color. Bachman (1839:228-232), Macgillivary\r\n(1843?:158), Audubon and Bachman (1851 (vol. 2):62), Schwalbe\r\n(1893:538), Pearson _et al._ (1913:447), Miller (1930, 1931A), Hamilton\r\n(1933:300) and Rothschild (1942), among others, have been inclined to\r\nthe opinion, or positively affirm, that the color change in autumn is\r\nthe result of a molt. The papers cited above contain, in turn,\r\nreferences to many other printed accounts dealing with this question.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, it has not so far been demonstrated that the change in\r\ncolor of weasels in autumn is accomplished without a molt. Also so far\r\nas I am aware, no explanation has been given of how the pigment may\r\ndisappear from the hair of weasels. Metchnikoff's (1901:156) idea that\r\nthe senile whitening of the hair in man is accomplished by phagocytes\r\nwhich remove the pigment granules would hardly seem to explain the\r\nrelatively sudden and complete autumnal change occurring in weasels.\r\nAnyhow, Danforth (1925:108), and some other students have thought that\r\nthe action of these phagocytes was at most a factor of slight\r\nimportance in the whitening of hair. Whatever be the complete answer to\r\nthe question of how the weasel changes color in autumn, at least one\r\nspecimen of long-tailed weasel, which is in process of color change in\r\nautumn, presents clear evidence of molt of the overhairs. This specimen\r\nof _M. f. longicauda_ is no. 188408, U. S. Nat. Mus., taken on November\r\n12, 1897, at Rapid City, South Dakota. Other specimens of _M. erminea_\r\nwhich were taken in autumn similarly show molt to be in progress. For\r\nthese and other reasons, I am inclined to the opinion that the autumnal\r\nchange in color, like the one in spring, is effected by molt. During\r\nthe period of the autumnal color change, Noback (1935:27) had a captive\r\n_M. f. noveboracensis_ and, each morning, found clumps of brown hair on\r\nthe floor of its cage; this was strong indication that molt was\r\nresponsible for the color change in this instance.\r\n\r\nHowever, I freely admit that the evidence does not _prove_ that the\r\nchange from brown to white can be accomplished _only_ by molt; in the\r\npresent state of knowledge it would be unscientific to deny that the\r\nchange were possible of accomplishment by other means. Also, it is true\r\nthat the fifteen specimens before me of _Mustela frenata_, subspecies\r\nincluded, in process of change from brown to white, with the exception\r\nof the one from Rapid City, South Dakota, if taken individually, do\r\nnot, in macroscopic examination, show definite molt lines or other\r\nabsolutely convincing evidence of molt. However, these same specimens,\r\ninsofar as examined microscopically, do show overhairs all white, or\r\noverhairs pigmented throughout. The lighter color of the proximal parts\r\nof the overhairs in itself should not be accepted as evidence of color\r\nchange, for in the fresh summer pelage, the same condition exists.\r\nAlso, careful macroscopic examination suffices to show that in the\r\ntransitional pelage of autumn, the brown overhairs generally are longer\r\nthan the intermixed white overhairs.\r\n\r\nWhether the underfur behaves in exactly the same way as the overhair, I\r\nhave not myself definitely ascertained, but I assume that the underfur\r\nis molted twice each year, at least in the northern populations of\r\n_Mustela frenata_ and in the other species of more northern\r\ndistribution. Schwalbe's (1893) work, including sectioning of the skin\r\nand study of the hair follicles, led him to conclude that the underfur\r\nwas molted twice each year in _Mustela erminea_.\r\n\r\nIn _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_, _M. f. nevadensis_, and _M. f.\r\nnigriauris_, measurements taken on adult males show the overhairs to be\r\nlonger in the winter pelage than in the summer pelage of specimens from\r\nthe same locality. For example, in _M. f. nigriauris_ from Berkeley,\r\nCalifornia, the overhairs of the summer coat (July and August) average\r\n8 millimeters in length on the hinder back and 7 mm. on the belly, but\r\naverage 9.5 mm. and 8 mm. respectively in January-taken specimens\r\npossessing the full winter coat. At Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the summer\r\ncoat, the longest hairs on the hinder back average approximately 12\r\nmm., and those on the belly, 9.5 mm., against 13 mm. and 9.5 mm.\r\nrespectively in winter. Although general observations initially led me\r\nto believe that the black, terminal hairs of the tip of the tail are\r\nlonger in the winter pelage than in the summer pelage, actual\r\nmeasurements fail to show a difference in length.\r\n\r\nThe change from one coat to the other in the long-tailed weasel has\r\nbeen described among others by Miller (1930, 1931A), Hamilton (1933)\r\nand Glover (1942) on the basis of captive specimens. In a general way,\r\nthe progress of the molt in their specimens agrees with that which I\r\nhave been able to make out from examination of skins taken in the wild.\r\nThere is, however, this difference: Their specimens show a more spotted\r\npattern when in process of hair-change than do specimens taken in the\r\nwild. Probably the more or less unnatural conditions under which these\r\ncaptive animals lived modified the normal progress of molt.\r\n\r\nIn wild-taken specimens of the species _Mustela frenata_, subspecies\r\nincluded, the spring molt begins on the mid-dorsal line and proceeds\r\nlaterally, producing, at almost any given time, a relatively sharp\r\nmolt line separating the white winter hair from the incoming brown\r\nsummer coat. However, in autumn the change takes place first on the\r\nbelly, then on the sides, and finally makes its appearance over all the\r\nupper parts at about the same time, with the result that the upper\r\nparts have a salt-and-pepper appearance without at this time any\r\nsharply defined molt lines. In general, the molt pattern can be said to\r\nbe reversed in the two seasons; in spring, it begins on the back and in\r\nautumn, on the belly. The difference in spring and autumn color pattern\r\nis better illustrated on plate 39 than by additional description.\r\nSwanson and Fryklund (1935:123) have observed that the \"spring molt\r\nproceeds differently\" than the fall one in _Mustela rixosa_, and\r\nBarrett-Hamilton (1903:309) in commenting on the European hare (and the\r\nstoat?) remarks, \"In spring the moult, and with it the brown colour,\r\nprogresses in exactly the opposite order . . .\" as compared with the\r\nwhite color of autumn, which that particular writer thought resulted\r\nfrom removal of pigment from the hairs rather than from molt.\r\n\r\nThe tail, excepting the black tip, lags in the molt in many instances,\r\nwith the result that, especially in spring, it may retain a few white\r\nhairs as late as does the belly. In autumn it is less tardy and so far\r\nas I have observed, becomes white at about the same time that the\r\ngeneral area of the back changes color. On the tail, the black tip\r\nitself, as clearly shown in more than a score of specimens, is molted\r\nat approximately the same time in autumn as is the pelage of the body.\r\nHowever, the long black hairs, which appear in, say, November, appear\r\nto increase in length until January. In spring, the long black hairs of\r\nthe tip of the tail seem not to be shed at the same time as the rest of\r\nthe winter pelage, but remain approximately six weeks longer and then\r\nare replaced by long black hairs of the summer coat. At any rate, this\r\nis the picture presented by a half dozen specimens of _M. f.\r\nnevadensis_ and _M. f. longicauda_ which do show a spring molt to be in\r\nprogress on the black tip of the tail. Schwalbe similarly\r\n(1893:536-537) has suggested that the black tip of the tail in _Mustela\r\nerminea_ in spring is not molted until about two months after the\r\npelage on the rest of the body is changed. Schwalbe (_loc. cit._)\r\nthinks also that in _M. erminea_ studied by him, the black tip of the\r\ntail in autumn is replaced approximately one month in advance of the\r\npelage on the rest of the body. As indicated above, my specimens of\r\n_Mustela frenata_, subspecies _longicauda_ and _nevadensis_, do not\r\nshow this discrepancy in autumn. I have considered the possibility that\r\nthe black tip of the tail, in some species of _Mustela_, is molted only\r\nonce while the remainder of the coat was undergoing two molts. My\r\ninconclusive data lend but little support to this possibility.\r\n\r\nThe difference in pattern of color between specimens taken in autumn\r\nand spring is known to some fur-trappers of my acquaintance who have\r\nsuggested that molt occurs in spring, whereas the individual hairs\r\nchange color in autumn. Reference to plate 39 will show how gross\r\ncomparisons might lead one to this erroneous explanation of the color\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nAs to time of molt: In eight subspecies of _Mustela frenata_, namely,\r\n_noveboracensis_, _occisor_, _primulina_, _spadix_, _longicauda_,\r\n_arizonensis_, _nevadensis_ and _effera_, material is available to\r\nindicate that the autumnal molt begins in October and is completed in\r\nNovember, and that the spring molt occurs in March or April. A\r\ncondensed list of specimens providing basis for this statement is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     _M. f. noveboracensis_: 26 specimens in transitional pelage taken\r\n     in autumn and 14 taken in spring; _M. f. occisor_: One topotype\r\n     has acquired one-fifth of the winter pelage on October 22, 1896;\r\n     _M. f. primulina_: 2 in November, one in March, and 2 in April are\r\n     in process of change; _M. f. spadix_: 6 autumnal specimens and one\r\n     in April show pelage change; _M. f. longicauda_: 7 autumnal\r\n     specimens and one in April show pelage change; _M. f.\r\n     arizonensis_: 12 specimens in autumn and 3 in spring are in\r\n     process of molt; _M. f. effera_: One November-taken male has\r\n     acquired four-fifths of the winter coat and another taken on April\r\n     21 at Fort Rock, Oregon, is half finished with the spring molt.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that no marked difference in time of either autumnal or\r\nspring molt is apparent as between the more northern and more southern\r\nlocalities from which the mentioned specimens come. With more complete\r\nmaterial I would expect to find a difference in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe material of the other, more southern, subspecies of _Mustela\r\nfrenata_ has not been adequate to show the time of molting or the\r\nnumber of molts which occur in one year.\r\n\r\nAnimals in the northern part of the range of _Mustela frenata_ acquire\r\na white winter coat, whereas those in the southern part acquire a brown\r\nwinter coat, and in an intervening area the winter coat may be either\r\nbrown or white. By plotting on a map the localities of capture of all\r\nspecimens examined in the winter coat, it was possible to outline this\r\nintervening area as shown in figure 10 on page 37. However, Dearborn\r\n(1932:36) shows that in Michigan some animals have a brown coat in\r\nwinter at places farther north than figure 10 shows to be the case.\r\nHamilton's (1933-306) map for New York shows the same to be true in\r\nthat state. Accordingly, the boundaries of the area shown in figure 10,\r\nin which both brown and white long-tailed weasels occur in winter, are\r\nknown to be only approximate; with full information available the belt\r\nwould be represented as wider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Map showing the region (in black) where both\r\nthe brown and white winter pelage is found in the long-tailed weasel,\r\n_Mustela frenata_.]\r\n\r\nHamilton (1933:302) has pointed out that \"Where half of the weasels\r\nremain brown, these brown winter specimens are always males.\" The\r\nresults of my own examination of specimens not studied by Hamilton, in\r\na general way provide confirmatory data. More exactly, my examination\r\nreveals that at the most northern localities where brown specimens\r\noccur, only males are in this coat. In explanation, it may be said that\r\nin plotting on a map localities of capture of specimens in the winter\r\ncoat, thirteen places were found where both sexes were represented and\r\nwhere both brown and white winter coats were found. With the two sexes,\r\nit is theoretically possible to have nine different combinations of\r\ncoat color. With males all brown, there might occur females (1) all\r\nbrown, (2) all white, or (3) some brown and some white. In addition to\r\nthese three combinations, we might have three more by finding the\r\nmentioned types of female coat color repeated where all males are\r\nwhite, and three more, or nine in all, by substituting a population of\r\nmales some of which were brown and some of which were white. Seven of\r\nthese possible combinations actually were found. The two combinations\r\nnot found were all white males with all brown females, and all white\r\nmales with females both brown and white. In the three instances where\r\nthe males all were brown and the females all were white, the localities\r\nof capture were in the northern part of the variable area. This\r\nindicates that where the brown winter coat occurs at northern\r\nlocalities, the brown individuals are all males. Farther south, of\r\ncourse, the females, too, acquire the brown winter coat.\r\n\r\nStated in another way, there is a broad belt across North America from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific in which males of _Mustela frenata_ at any\r\none locality may be either brown or white in winter. Inside this broad\r\nbelt there is a narrower one, approximately half as wide, in which\r\nfemales at any one locality may be either brown or white.\r\n\r\nIn support of the idea that color of the winter coat is an hereditary\r\nmatter and that it is not dependent on temperature, the following\r\nevidence derived from my transplanting specimens of _Mustela frenata_\r\nsupports the idea that color of the winter pelage is dependent on\r\nheredity and not on temperature or snowfall.\r\n\r\nA male captured on June 24, 1937, in the brown summer coat in Salt Lake\r\nCity, Utah, was received by me at Berkeley, California, five days later\r\nand kept in captivity almost six months. On November 17, 1937, half the\r\npelage was white and on December 27, 1937, when next examined, the\r\nanimal was in the full, white, winter coat as it was on January 25,\r\n1938, when it died. Native weasels all turn white in winter in Salt\r\nLake City, but in Berkeley native weasels always are brown in winter.\r\n\r\nA juvenile or young animal, a male, captured in May, 1936, at\r\nLafayette, Contra Costa County, California, was kept there until August\r\n13, 1936, when transferred to Calneva at the north end of Lake Tahoe,\r\nCalifornia. The weasel was kept at Calneva until its death on December\r\n23, 1937. In both the winter of 1936-'37 and in that of 1937-'38, the\r\nwinter coat was brown as in animals from its place of origin (Contra\r\nCosta County) and unlike weasels of the Tahoe region nearly all of\r\nwhich turn white in winter.\r\n\r\nTwo females, each approximately two months old, captured on May 1,\r\n1936, at James Landing, 4 miles northwest of San Pablo, Contra Costa\r\nCounty, California, were kept in Berkeley, California, until August 13,\r\n1936, when they were transferred to the mouth of Blackwood Creek, on\r\nthe west side of Lake Tahoe, California. On October 25, 1936, both\r\nweasels escaped. On December 25, 1936, the headless body of one of\r\nthese was found approximately 300 yards south of the mouth of Blackwood\r\nCreek. The animal had been dead at most a few days when found and was\r\nin the brown winter coat. At the place of its origin all weasels are\r\nbrown in winter but at the mouth of Blackwood Creek only 2 of 60\r\nweasels caught there in the winter coat were brown; the other 58 were\r\nwhite. The headless weasel was identified, as one of the two formerly\r\nin captivity, by means of certain short toes, the ends of which had\r\nbeen clipped off when the animal was a captive. No trace of the second\r\nfemale was found.\r\n\r\nA female of unknown age, in white winter pelage, captured 4 miles\r\nsoutheast of Tahoe City, California, and kept there until April 3,\r\n1937, on which date it was brought to Berkeley, California, molted to\r\nbrown in the spring. The first signs of the brown coat were noted on\r\nApril 14. On May 24 or 25 she gave birth to 4 young which lived less\r\nthan ten days. In the following winter this animal acquired a white\r\ncoat. As previously noted, weasels native to the Berkeley area, where\r\nthis female was kept, have brown coats in winter.\r\n\r\nThe weasels were in every instance kept in cages out-of-doors. The\r\nsides of the cages were open to the elements. A nest box in each cage\r\nprovided shelter. All were of the species _Mustela frenata_.\r\n\r\nThe significant results, it seemed to me, were that the winter coat was\r\nthe kind found in the area where the weasel originated instead of the\r\nkind found in weasels native to the areas in which the specimens were\r\nheld in captivity.\r\n\r\nThat the time of molt is determined by the amount of light has clearly\r\nbeen shown by Bissonnette (1944:223) for American weasels of the two\r\nspecies _Mustela erminea_ and _M. frenata_. In his words (_op.\r\ncit._:246) \"Reducing the daily periods of light induced molting and\r\nregrowth of new fur. . . . In the Bonaparte weasels [_Mustela\r\nerminea_], white replaced brown. . . . Increasing daily light-periods\r\ncaused molting and change to dark brown. . . . Incomplete molts in both\r\ndirections (toward white or toward brown) were produced as a result of\r\nearly reversal of increase or decrease of daily light-time. . . . That\r\nthis stimulus is received through the eyes and acts through the\r\nanterior pituitary gland is indicated by Bissonnette's [1935:159]\r\nstudies on ferrets, a nearly related animal. That the thyroids and\r\nsex-glands are not essential is at least suggested . . . by Lyman's\r\n(1942) study on the varying hare [_Lepus americanus_].\" It can be added\r\nthat Lyman (1943:451) demonstrated in _Lepus americanus_ that the\r\neffect of light is received through the eyes. He demonstrated this by\r\nmasking the animals. To Wright (1942B:109) who studied the two American\r\nweasels, _M. erminea_ and _M. frenata_, it seemed likely that the\r\npituitary produced or released gonadotropic hormone at about the time\r\nof the spring molt and that this molt and the spring changes in the\r\nreproductive tracts of the weasels might be caused by a stimulus from a\r\ncommon source. Later, Wright (1950:130) injected a gonadotropic hormone\r\ninto long-tailed weasels which had recently acquired their white winter\r\npelage and thereby caused them to lose the white pelage and acquire the\r\nbrown pelage. It is Lyman (1943:450) who says, in relation to _Lepus\r\namericanus_, \"When in the physiologically white condition, the\r\nmelanoblasts of the regenerating guard-and pile-hair follicles contain\r\nno melanin-forming enzyme (dopa-oxidase), which may be the reason for\r\nthe lack of pigment.\" Schwalbe (1893) by sectioning the skin and\r\nmicroscopically examining the hair-follicles of _M. erminea_ learned\r\nthat the basal cells producing hairs lacked pigment granules in autumn\r\nwhen the European ermine (_M. erminea_) was acquiring its white winter\r\ncoat and that the cells contained granules of pigment in spring when,\r\nas we know, the granules are incorporated in the growing hair and give\r\nit its color.\r\n\r\nThe above material, then, is basis for the account on pages 31 and 32\r\nof what causes the weasel of northern areas to have a white coat in\r\nwinter. The discerning student will instantly perceive that although\r\nsome parts of the account on pages 31 and 32 are precisely accurate,\r\nother parts are the result of inferences which need to be proved. More\r\ncareful work of the kind that Schwalbe (1893) and Wright (1942B) did is\r\nneeded. The account on pages 31 and 32 is merely the best that can be\r\ngiven with the information now available.\r\n\r\nMany writers have commented on the yellowish color, sometimes with a\r\ngreenish tinge, found on the fur of weasels in the white winter coat.\r\nThe stain is more often found on the tail and hinder-parts of the body\r\nthan elsewhere. Possibly, partly on this account, some have ascribed\r\nthis color to the smearing of the fur with urine. Still others have\r\nthought it resulted from the smearing of the fur with secretions from\r\nthe anal scent glands. Schumacher (1928) takes this point of view, and\r\nwhile it may be that he has not proved his point, still his conclusions\r\nfit the known facts and seem sound to me. Schumacher points out that\r\nthe same soiling of the fur is present in summer as well as in winter,\r\nbut that on the summer pelage the stain can be detected only on the\r\nlight-colored underparts. It is from this point of view that he\r\ncriticizes the systematic worth of white versus yellowish-white\r\nunderparts in the summer pelage of geographic races of _Mustela\r\nerminea_ and _Mustela nivalis_. Although in the long-tailed weasels\r\n(_Mustela frenata_) the underparts of all the races are pigmented with\r\nsome form of red, orange or yellow, it seems probable to me that the\r\nadditional color resulting from the soiling effect of this glandular\r\nsecretion explains the greater variation, found at a single locality,\r\nin the color of underparts than of upper parts in the summer pelage.\r\n\r\nI have neither seen nor heard of a black weasel in any part of the New\r\nWorld or of the Old World. I have found only one albino among American\r\nspecimens. It is an adult female, no. 121424, American Museum of\r\nNatural History, of _Mustela erminea richardsonii_, taken on August 30,\r\n1935, at Hot Springs, Northwest Territory. This place, I am told by G.\r\nG. Goodwin who obtained the animal, is on the \"Nahanni River where the\r\nrugged mountain ridges rise abruptly from the low mud flat lands,\r\nlatitude 61, longitude 125.\" The shortness and coarseness of the hair\r\ncorresponds to that of the summer pelage and not winter pelage. The\r\npelage is everywhere white, even the tip of the tail. True, all except\r\nthe nape and top and sides of the head has a faint yellowish-green\r\ntinge which has been supposed to result from staining by secretion of\r\nthe anal scent glands but there is no pigment in the hair as in\r\nerythristic specimens. From the Old World, Farurick (1873:17) has\r\nrecorded what he regards as an albino of _Mustela vulgaris_ since it\r\nhad no black hairs on the tip of its tail. Flintoff (1935:228, 229)\r\nrecords what may have been an albino _Mustela vulgaris_ from Yorkshire\r\nand an albino _M. erminea_ from an unstated locality. Jäckel (1873:459)\r\nmentions specimens of _Mustela erminea_ and _Mustela vulgaris_, which\r\nwere partly \"albinistic\" or \"erythristic.\" Among the American specimens\r\nof _M. erminea_ I have not recorded any which appeared to be either\r\npartly or wholly erythristic or only partly albinistic. Among the 1550\r\nskins of _M. frenata_ which were in summer pelage or brown winter\r\npelage, five, described below, show marked abnormalities in color.\r\n\r\nTwo of these five are partly albinistic. One is an adult male, no.\r\n223880, U. S. Nat. Mus., from Billy's Island, Okefinokee Swamp,\r\nGeorgia, which has the nose as well as the area between the eyes white.\r\nAlso there is a tuft of white hairs at the anterodorsal margin of each\r\near, scattering white hairs suggesting a postorbital bar on each side\r\nof the head, and a patch of white hairs on the mid-dorsal line behind\r\nthe ears. Markings of this kind are not abnormal in _M. f. peninsulae_,\r\nthe subspecies adjoining on the south, except for the white nose which\r\nclearly is an instance of partial albinism. The second specimen is a\r\nsubadult male, of _M. f. noveboracensis_, no. 177679, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\nin process of acquiring the brown winter coat, taken on November 27,\r\n1911, at Gaylordsville, Connecticut. It has white markings on the nose,\r\non the right side of the neck, on the right hind foot and right\r\nforefoot, and on the tip of the tail. The white area of the nose on the\r\nleft side extends back to the eye, but on the right side barely\r\nencircles the nose-pad. On the right side of the neck, all that area\r\nbetween the foreleg and ear is white from the mid-dorsal line\r\n(including 7 or 8 millimeters to the left of the mid-dorsal line) down\r\nto the throat, which is white as it is also in normal individuals. The\r\ntoes of the right hind foot are more extensively white than in normal\r\nspecimens of _noveboracensis_, and all of the right forefoot as well as\r\nthe wrist is white. The tail is of striking appearance because of its\r\ntricolor pattern. The proximal part is of the normal brown color. The\r\nblack terminal part commences proximally at the usual place, but the\r\ndistal 11 millimeters of the fleshy part of the tail bear only pure\r\nwhite hairs producing a terminal white pencil 35 millimeters long.\r\n\r\nThe three other specimens abnormally colored are erythristic\r\nindividuals. An adult male of _M. f. latirostra_, no. 7574, coll. D. R.\r\nDickey, taken on April 14, 1918, at Covina, Los Angeles County,\r\nCalifornia, has the color of the upper parts greatly restricted, and,\r\nin addition, has spots and blotches of the color of the underparts\r\ndistributed over the back and rump. A spot of this same color occurs\r\nabove each ear. Incidentally, this and other subspecies of _Mustela\r\nfrenata_ from the Pacific Coast of North America obviously have the\r\nfactor for erythrism operating over a larger part of the body than it\r\ndoes in _M. erminea_ or than in _M. f. noveboracensis_, where the\r\nunderparts sometimes are white. In _M. f. latirostra_ and in other\r\nsubspecies from the Pacific Coast the light color of the underparts\r\nalways is tinged with this reddish color.\r\n\r\nAnother erythristic specimen is a young male of _M. f. nevadensis_, no.\r\n23493, U. S. Nat. Mus., taken on August 6, 1890, at Birch Creek, Idaho.\r\nIt has all of each foreleg, the axillary regions, and a saddle-shaped\r\narea over the shoulders of the same buff-yellow color as the\r\nunderparts.\r\n\r\nThe third erythristic specimen is a subadult female, of _M. f.\r\noregonensis_, no. 47149, Mus. Vert. Zoöl., taken on December 20, 1930,\r\nat Carlotta, Humboldt County, California. This specimen appears to be\r\nwhite and initially was thought to be merely an individual in the white\r\nwinter coat. Closer examination, however, shows that it has a light\r\nwash of ochraceous or faint reddish color. Also, other specimens taken\r\nin winter at Carlotta show that weasels there do not acquire a white\r\nwinter coat. The only normally brown area is approximately three\r\nmillimeters in diameter at the anterodorsal margin of the pinna of the\r\nright ear. The tip of the tail is black as in a normal specimen. The\r\nspecimen in question is actually pure white only on top of the head\r\nfrom a short distance behind the ears on over the forehead nearly to\r\nthe eyes, and on the inside of the ears. In a normally colored animal\r\nthis area is the dark area of the head. In this freak, the other parts\r\nof the head, which, in individuals of normal coloration are the white\r\nor light orange facial markings, have the reddish cast of the remainder\r\nof the body, although the color is less intense than on the back. The\r\ncollector noted that the specimen had eyes of normal color. A possible\r\nexplanation for the coloration of this specimen is that this species\r\nhas three factors for color, one for the black tail tip, one for the\r\nreddish color, and a third, missing in the specimen in question, for\r\nthe blackish brown.\r\n\r\nFor some more exact knowledge concerning this erythristic type of\r\ncoloration, we are indebted to Pitt (1921:99), who describes a\r\npopulation of polecats, _Mustela putorius_, in Cardiganshire, England,\r\nin which this erythristic variation is maintained in a state of nature.\r\nIn ferrets, _Mustela furo_, Pitt (_op. cit._:114) notes that \". . .\r\nerythrism is certainly dependent on a Mendelian factor, being dominant\r\nto albinism and recessive to the black-brown coloration. Both in the\r\nferret and polecat, erythrism seems to be correlated with increased\r\nsize, and certainly in the ferret is usually accompanied by a quick\r\ntemper and general increase in vitality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations of Taxonomic Worth\r\n\r\nVariations of taxonomic worth usually are referred to as characters.\r\nFor example, shortness of the tympanic bulla is a character, and the\r\nopposite condition, long tympanic bulla, is another character. Specific\r\nvariations, that is to say specific characters, are provided by the\r\ncolor-pattern, length of tail, number of premolar teeth, shape of the\r\ntympanic bullae, and length of the braincase in relation to the length\r\nof the tooth-bearing parts of the skull. Subspecific characters are\r\nprovided by color-pattern, color itself, size as measured by weight of\r\nthe animal, and its linear measurements, size of the skull, and size\r\nand shape of parts of the skull. The characters distinguishing\r\nsubspecies from one another are not of a different nature from those\r\ndistinguishing species from one another.\r\n\r\nGiven any one of the above structural features, say, dorsal outline of\r\nthe skull, several characters may be provided by it. For example,\r\nweasels of the species _Mustela frenata_ have the dorsal outline of the\r\nskull convex in southern Louisiana, straight in Missouri and concave in\r\nNorth Dakota, thus providing three characters. This is geographic\r\nvariation. These variations, characters in zoölogical parlance, when\r\nplotted on maps, reveal the geographic occurrence of, say, the convex\r\nshape of the skull. In combination with other characters, for example,\r\ndark color and short tail, basis is provided for recognizing a\r\nsubspecies, in this instance _Mustela frenata arthuri_ of Louisiana.\r\nBecause the change from convex to flat skull takes place geographically\r\nat about the same place (in eastern Texas) as does the change from\r\nshort tail to long tail, and the change from dark color to light color,\r\nit is easy to draw a line there marking the western geographic limit of\r\noccurrence of the _M. f. arthuri_. This same line marks also the\r\neastern margin of the geographic range of the subspecies _Mustela\r\nfrenata frenata_, the subspecies next adjacent to the westward. On this\r\nline and for several miles to either side of it weasels show varying\r\ncombinations of these three characters or an intermediate condition as\r\nregards one or more of the characters, or both. For example, from a\r\nlocality in eastern Texas a weasel may have (1) a facial pattern\r\nexactly intermediate between that of the unicolored face of _arthuri_\r\nand that of the bicolored face of _frenata_, (2) the long tail of\r\n_frenata_ and (3) the convex skull of _arthuri_. In the sum of its\r\ncharacters this specimen is exactly intermediate between typical\r\n_arthuri_ and typical _frenata_. Another specimen from the same place\r\nmay differ from the first specimen only in having the tail slightly\r\nshorter. The total \"score\" for the two specimens is, therefore, by a\r\nvery slight margin in favor of _arthuri_. Let us suppose that we obtain\r\na third specimen from the same place and that it has the face marked\r\nlike that of _arthuri_ but the tail fully as long, and the skull as\r\nlacking in dorsal convexity, as in _frenata_. Now the score is\r\ndefinitely for _frenata_. For convenience of handling, the population\r\nis referred to _frenata_, providing that the average of specimens from\r\na nearby locality to the westward is not in favor of _arthuri_. In\r\nevent the average of specimens from a locality next adjacent to the\r\nwestward is in favor of _M. f. arthuri_, the total evidence from the\r\ntwo localities may be weighed together and appropriate decision as to\r\nsubspecific status of weasels from the area is made according to what\r\nthe average is for the area as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe three individual animals of an intermediate sort are ordinarily\r\ntermed _intergrades_. This implies that their characters are the result\r\nof mixed parentage--perhaps a female of _M. f. arthuri_ and a male of\r\n_M. f. frenata_ but probably each parent itself was an intergrade and\r\nthe offspring, of which we examined three, owe their characters to\r\nreproductive processes operating in obedience to Mendelian laws of\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nThe two kinds of animals, _Mustela frenata arthuri_ and _Mustela\r\nfrenata frenata_, are identified as subspecies because of the\r\nintergradation between them. If at this and all other places where the\r\ngeographic ranges of _arthuri_ and _frenata_ met there was no\r\ncrossbreeding (no intergrades), the two kinds would be treated as\r\ndistinct species. Intergradation, and the lack of it, are accepted as\r\nthe criteria of subspecies and species, respectively.\r\n\r\nThese criteria suffice for animals, in this instance weasels, which\r\nhave a continuous geographic distribution. Some kinds of weasels are\r\nconfined to islands, as for example the islands off the coast of Alaska\r\nand British Columbia. Because weasels are land animals, crossbreeding\r\nin nature between the weasels of two islands is, of course, impossible.\r\nA modified test (used in the study here reported upon) in deciding on\r\nspecific versus subspecific status in these instances can be made as\r\nfollows: On the adjacent mainland, ascertain the degree of difference\r\nbetween two subspecies whose geographic ranges meet (for example, _M.\r\ne. richardsonii_ and _M. e. alascensis_). Next ascertain the degree of\r\ndifference between the insular kind of animal and the kind on the\r\nmainland. If the degree of difference is greater when the insular kind\r\nis compared than when only the kinds of the mainland are compared, the\r\ninsular kind is to be regarded as a species. If the degree of\r\ndifference is no greater between the insular kind and the mainland kind\r\nthan it is between the two adjacent mainland kinds, the insular kind is\r\nto be regarded as a subspecies. In short, for insular kinds, the\r\ncriterion is degree of difference, with the limitation of geographic\r\nadjacency, rather than intergradation.\r\n\r\nThe geographic variation (subspecific characters) found could be spoken\r\nof as two kinds: First, there is the variation which is expressed in a\r\ngeneral trend for a long distance, producing, in general, a cline of\r\neven slope; and second, that of inconstant trend in any one direction.\r\nIn his \"The Rabbits of North America\" Nelson (1909:34-35) has commented\r\non the latter type of variation as follows: \"While studying series of\r\nspecimens from all parts of the vast range occupied by the geographic\r\nraces of such species as _Sylvilagus floridanus_ and _S. auduboni_, I\r\nhave been impressed with evidences of fluctuation of both external and\r\nskull characters. These fluctuations are somewhat wavelike in character\r\nand rise to central points of extreme development and then sink away to\r\nintermediate borders beyond which new waves rise. Where the waves of\r\ndifferentiation are pronounced they mark recognizable geographic races.\r\nWithin the area covered by the larger or geographically broader waves\r\nof differentiation (recognized as of subspecific value), smaller waves\r\nof differentiation are included, which may represent local variations\r\nin intensity of characters of the subspecies, or these characters may\r\ndiminish and the variation tend in other directions, sometimes even\r\nclosely reproducing the characters of another subspecies occupying a\r\ndistinct area.\" In _Mustela frenata_, much of the geographic variation\r\nat first inspection appears to be of this nature. Closer scrutiny,\r\nhowever, reveals that the repetition, at geographic intervals, of\r\nseveral features of color and structure are closely correlated with\r\nenvironmental features which are repeated only at these same places.\r\n\r\nIn _Mustela erminea_, much of the variation is of the first kind,\r\nnamely, that which can be expressed as long clines of relatively even\r\nslope. As several authors have said, zoölogical classification based on\r\nthis kind of variation is like dividing the spectrum and depends\r\nlargely upon the standards set, for, theoretically, the possibilities\r\nof subdivision are unlimited. Actually, however, none of the clines has\r\nan even slope and the possibilities for subdivision therefore are\r\nlimited. Also, when several features are used, instead of only one\r\nfeature, the classification is more satisfactory even if the basis is\r\nmore complex.\r\n\r\nSome features of structure which provide subspecific characters are\r\nmentioned below.\r\n\r\nTotal length, of males, ranges from 598 to 360 mm. in _M. frenata_ and\r\nfrom 336 to 228 mm. in _M. erminea_. There is no cline of sustained\r\nslope in _M. frenata_ but in _M. erminea_ there is a progressive\r\ndecrease in total length from north to south.\r\n\r\nLength of tail varies from as little as a half to as much as\r\nseven-tenths of the length of the head and body in _M. frenata_, the\r\nsubspecies _neomexicana_ having the long tail and the two subspecies\r\n_arthuri_ and _primulina_ having short tails. The geographic ranges of\r\n_primulina_ and _neomexicana_ are contiguous. In _M. erminea_ there is\r\nlikewise no variation of a clinal nature in length of tail and\r\nfurthermore the variation is much less than in _M. frenata_.\r\n\r\nIn length of hind foot, which in males varies from 49 mm. in northern\r\npopulations of _M. erminea_ to 28 mm. in southern populations, the same\r\ncline is seen as in the total length of animals of this species. In _M.\r\nfrenata_, however, there are several decreases and increases along any\r\nstraight line which can be drawn through the geographic range of the\r\nspecies. The range of variation in males is 41 mm. (_M. f.\r\narizonensis_) to 59 mm. (_M. f. macrophonius_).\r\n\r\nWeight of the entire animal is an excellent measure of size but weights\r\nare unavailable for many subspecies. In _M. frenata_, the two\r\nsubspecies _texensis_ and _macrophonius_ probably are the heaviest and\r\n_effera_, _arizonensis_ and _helleri_ probably are the lightest.\r\nGeographically the variation in weight behaves in approximately the\r\nsame way as does the measurement of total length. In _M. erminea_ the\r\nvariation in weight of males is from 206 grams in northern animals to\r\n58 grams in southernmost populations, there being a relatively constant\r\ngradient geographically.\r\n\r\nDegree of hairiness of the foot-soles in _M. frenata_ clearly is linked\r\nwith the temperature; in regions of high average temperature the\r\nhairiness is least and in regions of low average temperature it is\r\nmost. The decrease in hairiness is accomplished in two ways, namely,\r\nsmaller breadth and decreased length of individual hairs and decrease\r\nin number of hairs on a given area of dermal surface. This correlation\r\nholds throughout the entire north to south range of the species.\r\nCorresponding differences are found on the same latitude where\r\ntopographic diversity in an east to west direction produces northern\r\nconditions at high altitudes and southern conditions at low altitudes.\r\nThe conclusion seems unavoidable that climate, directly or indirectly,\r\ndetermines the degree of hairiness. Less careful observations were made\r\non the hairiness of the soles of the feet in other species but it is\r\nclear that the northern species _M. erminea_ has the most hair on the\r\nfoot-soles and that _M. africana_, the tropical weasel, has the least.\r\nIn this regard, _M. frenata_ is intermediate as it is also in\r\ngeographic position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 11-15. Dorsal views of adult skulls of each sex of\r\nfive subspecies of the ermine, _Mustela erminea_, to show secondary\r\nsexual variation and geographic variation in size of the skull. Males\r\non the left and females on the right. All × 1.\r\n\r\nNote especially the geographic variation in decreasing size of the\r\nskull from north to south in each sex, and that the secondary sexual\r\nvariation in size of skull is less in ermines with small skulls than in\r\nthose with large skulls.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Map showing the localities where the skulls,\r\nrepresented in figures 11-15, were obtained.]\r\n\r\nThe maximum length of facial and carpal vibrissae is attained in _M.\r\nerminea_ in the far north. In weasels from north of the Arctic Circle\r\nthe longest facial vibrissae extend posteriorly beyond the posterior\r\nborder of the ear. In the tropical weasel, _M. africana_, the facial\r\nvibrissae do not extend posteriorly beyond the ear and the carpal\r\nvibrissae are not so long as the distance between their bases and the\r\napical pad of the first digit. The correlation of long vibrissae with\r\nlow temperature, is mentioned here merely because length and density of\r\npelage were under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and most exact correlation between change in climate\r\nand change in the animal is furnished by color. This is well shown in\r\nthe one species, _Mustela frenata_, to which the following remarks\r\napply unless indication is given to the contrary. The color of the\r\nupper parts varies from bay (blackish brown) in _M. f. panamensis_ to\r\nbuckthorn brown (light brown) in _M. f. neomexicana_. The color of the\r\nhead varies from solid brown (white chin excepted) to contrasting black\r\nand white markings.\r\n\r\nDark color of the upper parts is associated with a large area of this\r\ncolor; the enlargement of this area is at the expense of the area of\r\nlight color on the underparts. In the weasels of darkest color the\r\nupper parts occupy four-fifths of the circumference of the body (as\r\nmeasured in the anterior lumbar region) but in the lightest-colored\r\nweasels the upper parts comprise only two-thirds of the total\r\ncircumference. In these light-colored animals the color of the\r\nunderparts extends onto the underside of the tail and down the insides\r\nof the legs and over the feet whereas in the animals with the darkest\r\nupper parts the entire tail, feet, and legs below the knees ordinarily\r\nare of the same dark color as the upper parts. The length of the black\r\ntip on the tail varies inversely with the length of the tail, probably\r\nbecause the lightest-colored weasel has the longest tail. In some\r\nsubspecies the black brush is almost half as long as the tail-vertebrae\r\nbut in others is less than a fourth as long as the tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the color of the head, as well as the intensity of the\r\ncolor there, varies markedly and is correlated with climatic\r\nconditions. The extent and intensity of this dark color is greater in\r\nweasels inhabiting regions of heavy rainfall than in those inhabiting\r\nregions of sparse rainfall. Considering the geographic range of each\r\nsubspecies of _Mustela frenata_, that of _M. f. panamensis_ has the\r\nmaximum of rainfall. Reference to the colored plate (1) will show that\r\nin _M. f. panamensis_ (2) the black of the head is extended over all of\r\nthe upper parts. _M. f. macrura_ (1) of Perú, to the southward, is from\r\nan area of lesser rainfall and is correspondingly lighter colored.\r\nReturning to _panamensis_ (2) as a starting point and proceeding\r\nnorthward to the range of _nicaraguae_ (3), which also has lesser\r\nrainfall, thence another step northward to Guatamala, which has still\r\nless rainfall, the weasel there, _M. f. goldmani_ (4) has the black\r\nextending posteriorly only to the shoulders. _M. f. leucoparia_ (5)\r\nfrom Michoacán, and _M. f. frenata_ (6) from Tamaulipas are from\r\nprogressively more northern and also progressively drier regions. In\r\n_M. f. frenata_ (6) the dark color extends posteriorly only to the ears\r\nand is blackish rather than black. In _M. f. neomexicana_ (7) of the\r\nextremely arid parts of Durango, Arizona, and New Mexico the dark\r\nmarking of the head is confined to a brown spot on the nose. Its\r\ngeographic range is the most arid of those of all of the subspecies.\r\nThe contrast between _neomexicana_ (7) and _panamensis_ (2) illustrates\r\nthe great range of geographic variation in color which occurs in the\r\none species. Continuing from the geographic range of _neomexicana_\r\n(specimen from Safford, Arizona) northwesterly 480 miles to Riverside,\r\nCalifornia (see 8, _latirostra_), 430 miles north to Point Reyes,\r\nCalifornia (see 9, _munda_), and finally 570 miles north to Tillamook,\r\nOregon (see 10, _altifrontalis_), each place with more rainfall than\r\nthe one farther south, another correlation of increasingly dark\r\ncoloration with increasing amount of rainfall is illustrated.\r\n\r\nThis geographic variation, it should be remembered, is all within one\r\nspecies. It is the more significant still when we remember that the\r\nsame correlation, with never an exception, occurs at hundreds of places\r\nwithin the geographic range of the species. A particular feature of\r\nclimate, namely rainfall, and possibly therefore humidity, is concerned\r\nin this correlation. The same correlation, heavy rainfall and dark\r\ncolor, is shown also in the other species of North American weasels.\r\nThe conclusion is unavoidable that climate, directly or indirectly,\r\ndetermines or influences the color of weasels.\r\n\r\nThe light facial markings appear in American weasels in two separate\r\ngeographic areas. One is the southwestern United States, México and\r\nnorthern Central America. The second area is in the same latitude, in\r\nFlorida and adjoining parts of Georgia and Alabama. In the western\r\nweasels the markings are white south of latitude 32° N. North of this\r\nlatitude, the facial markings, if at all extensive, usually are of the\r\nsame yellowish color as the underparts of the body. Weasels of southern\r\nCalifornia and its interior valley usually have these yellowish instead\r\nof white facial markings. The light facial markings, in this instance,\r\nwhite markings, attain their maximum extent in _M. f. leucoparia_ of\r\nthe southwestern margin of the tableland of México, at latitude 19° N.\r\nA gradual decrease in area of the light facial markings occurs both to\r\nthe north and south; they disappear at 10° N in _M. f. costaricensis_\r\nand at 35° N at approximately the southern limits of range of _M. f.\r\narizonensis_ and _M. f. nevadensis_. In the mild climate of California\r\nthe light (yellowish) facial markings are found at still higher\r\nlatitudes. These light facial markings crop up as vestiginal remnants,\r\nconsisting of a few white hairs, in some individuals of nearly all\r\nraces of weasels.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the skull there are trends, in size and shape,\r\nwhich continue for long distances geographically. In other words,\r\nclines can be recognized. Changes in size and shape in some other parts\r\nof the skull are wavelike; change toward narrower rostrum, for example,\r\nis not progressive in a given geographic direction for any great\r\ndistance. Length of the upper tooth-rows and zygomatic breadth, when\r\nexpressed as percentages of the basilar length, and also the actual\r\nlength of individual teeth vary geographically in the same wavelike\r\nfashion as does the width of the rostrum.\r\n\r\nSize of the skull, on the other hand, shows a sustained trend for a\r\nlong distance; it becomes progressively smaller from the southern\r\nUnited States southward to Columbia, South America. This clinal\r\nvariation can be demonstrated by plotting on a graph, the basilar\r\nlength, the zygomatic breadth, or the weight of the skull. Beginning at\r\nMérida, Venezuela, and proceeding southward to increasing elevations in\r\nthe mountains of South America, there is a reversal of the direction of\r\nthe variation in this cline; weight of skull, for example, increases to\r\nthe southward from Mérida for a considerable distance. A cline of\r\ndecreasing width of the postorbital constriction of the skull is\r\nevident from Panamá north into Texas.\r\n\r\nVariations in the tympanic bullae provide many characters useful in\r\ndistinguishing weasels from different localities. Most of these\r\ncharacters have to do with degree of inflation of the bullae.\r\nIndirectly correlated with degree of inflation is first the extent of\r\nremoval of the anterior margin of the bulla from the glenoid fossa and\r\nforamen ovale, and second the form (convex, flat, or concave) of the\r\npart of the squamosal bone between the foramen ovale and the anterior\r\nmargin of the tympanic bulla. As one proceeds southward from, say,\r\nsouthwestern Kansas through the geographic range of the species\r\n_Mustela frenata_, there is a progressive deflation of the bulla, an\r\nincrease in length of the space between its anterior margin and the\r\nforamen ovale, and the floor of the braincase in front of the bulla\r\nchanges from ventrally concave to ventrally convex. (See figs. _e_ and\r\n_h_ of pl. 24 and figs, _e_ and _f_ of pl. 27.)\r\n\r\nOne extreme of this variation in bulla is shown in _Mustela frenata\r\nneomexicana_ (fig. _e_ of pl. 24), in which the anterior margin of the\r\nbulla (viewed from the ventral side) rises vertically from the floor of\r\nthe braincase to form a 90-degree angle. The other extreme, the\r\nuninflated bulla, is in _Mustela frenata panamensis_ (fig. _e_ of pl.\r\n27), in which the anterior margin of the bulla is not raised above the\r\nfloor of the braincase. This variation is remarkable because it occurs\r\nwithin a single species. Otherwise, in the family Mustelidae,\r\ndifferences in the tympanic bullae as great as that between the two\r\nsubspecies _M. f. neomexicana_ and _M. f. panamensis_, occur only\r\nbetween genera. The need for caution in inferring the limits of\r\nvariation for a particular structure in one species or genus, on the\r\nbasis of variation in another group, is therefore obvious.\r\n\r\nSpeaking now of full species, the most inflated tympanic bullae in\r\nAmerican weasels are in _Mustela frenata_, and more restrictedly in\r\nthose subspecies of it which occur in the temperate region. Subspecies\r\nof _M. frenata_ in Central and South America, as already noted, have\r\nless inflated bullae. The tropical weasel, _Mustela africana_, of the\r\nAmazon drainage of South America has the bullae still less inflated\r\n(see fig. _i_ of pl. 39 and fig. _f_ of pl. 40). The bullae are less\r\ninflated even than in the mink, subgenus _Lutreola_. In _M. africana_\r\nthe cleidomastoideus, omotrachelian, levator scapulae, and rhomboideus\r\nprofundus muscles take origin from a fossa on the mastoid bone, whereas\r\nin the forms with greatly inflated bullae these muscles take origin\r\nfrom a raised ridge or tubercle. Using _Mustela frenata_ of the\r\ntemperate region as a starting point and proceeding northward, a\r\nreduction in inflation of the tympanic bulla is seen also in that\r\ndirection in that _Mustela erminea_ has less inflated bullae. The\r\nbullae are less inflated in southern than in far northern (arctic)\r\npopulations of _Mustela erminea_. In _erminea_ the lesser inflation is\r\nreal enough but at the same time there appears to be less inflation\r\nthan actually exists, for the squamosal floor of the braincase is\r\n\"pushed down.\" This places the anterior end of the tympanic bulla\r\nfarther in the braincase than it otherwise would be. Although the\r\nanterior end of the bulla is flattened to the extent that it resembles\r\nthe sharp edge of a splitting-wedge, inspection of the lateral and\r\nmedial edges shows that in its central part the bulla is more inflated\r\nthan it is in the weasels of Central and South America.\r\n\r\nFor reasons set forth later, _M. erminea_ is judged to resemble the\r\nancestral stem form more closely than does any one of the other three\r\nAmerican species of weasels. If this judgment is correct, the shape of\r\nthe tympanic bullae of the American weasels may be explained as\r\nfollows: In the subspecies of _Mustela frenata_ of the temperate\r\nregions of North America the bullae have most nearly been pushed out of\r\nthe braincase and at the same time have undergone some enlargement. The\r\nsubspecies of this same species in Central and South America represent\r\nan earlier stage in the evolution of American weasels and retain less\r\ninflated bullae--less inflated even than those of the southern\r\nsubspecies of _erminea_. _M. africana_ probably separated from the stem\r\nform at a still earlier time if we may judge by the lesser inflation of\r\nits tympanic bullae. There are other reasons for thinking that\r\n_africana_ separated from the stem form earlier than _M. frenata_ did.\r\nDuring the time that elapsed since the separation of _M. frenata_ from\r\nthe stem form, the tympanic bullae of _M. erminea_ probably increased\r\nslightly in size, as probably also did the brain but without shoving\r\nthe auditory complex forward from its former position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION AND SPECIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWeasels of the subgenus _Mustela_ are known from the Pleistocene but\r\nnot from deposits laid down at an earlier time (see page 10). The\r\nPleistocene weasels from Rancho La Brea of southern California and from\r\nPotter Creek Cave and Samwel Cave, both of northern California, are\r\nsubspecifically indistinguishable from the weasels living in those same\r\nlocalities today. The other notable occurrence of weasels in the\r\nPleistocene is in the Conard Fissure of Arkansas. Brown (1908:181, 182,\r\npl. 17) names two kinds from the Fissure. One is an extinct subspecies\r\n(_Mustela frenata gracilis_) possibly of the species which occurs in\r\nthe same region today and the other, _Mustela erminea? angustidens_,\r\nis an extinct subspecies of a species which occurs only farther north\r\ntoday. _M. erminea_ came south, probably in front of one of the ice\r\nsheets, as did several other species of American mammals, now of more\r\nnorthern distribution, that left their remains in Conard Fissure.\r\n_Mustela rixosa_ is not recorded as a fossil in America although it is\r\nknown from the \"Diluvial\" deposits of the Old World; see Woldrich\r\n(1884:1000), who employs the name \"_Foetorius minutus_ n. sp.,\" and see\r\nalso Zimmerman (1943:295-296).\r\n\r\nThe ermine, _Mustela erminea_, is the most generalized of the full\r\nspecies. For example, the number of teeth is as large as in any other\r\nspecies and greater than in certain species. The teeth are\r\nsharp-pointed, uncrowded, and individually less specialized than in any\r\nother American weasel. M1 has the inner half, or lobe, of approximately\r\nthe same size as the outer lobe instead of much larger than the outer\r\nlobe (the outer lobe is the larger in several other species). The\r\ntympanic bullae are less inflated and less protruded from the\r\nbraincase. The skull is rounded, and has no marked crests and ridges\r\nwhereas the skulls of the other species are more pronouncedly modeled\r\nand sculptured. Therefore, it is possible to think of these other\r\nspecies as derived from _M. erminea_. A derivation in the reverse\r\ndirection would be more difficult. From the foot soles of an ermine, or\r\na weasel closely resembling an ermine, the more complex soles of\r\n_Mustela africana_ could have been derived by a decrease in hairiness,\r\nalthough it would be necessary to suppose that the thenar pad has been\r\nretained in _africana_ and has been lost in the living _erminea_. The\r\nalternate possibility, namely, that the thenar pad was a relatively\r\nrecent acquisition in the _africana_ line seems less probable. The tail\r\nof _erminea_ is of \"average\" length and in size of entire animal\r\n_erminea_ is intermediate between the other American weasels.\r\nStructurally, _Mustela erminea_ appears to be nearest the stem form\r\nfrom which all of the living weasels ascended. Its present holarctic\r\ndistribution is in harmony with the view that it is a direct descendant\r\nfrom the stem form because the stem forms of most of the known kinds of\r\nmustelids appear to have lived in the holarctic region. To be sure,\r\n_Mustela erminea_ is regarded as having undergone some progressive\r\nchange in structure, but less than the other weasels, in the period of\r\ntime when the weasels were evolving from the stem form.\r\n\r\nThe least weasel, _Mustela rixosa_, seems to be an ancient type and to\r\njudge from the size and proportions of its parts, was differentiated\r\nfrom the _erminea_ stem at a time earlier than were the other American\r\nRecent species of weasels. In size, in reduction of the tail, and in\r\nproportions of the skull, _M. rixosa_ is, in each instance, the most\r\naberrant of all the weasels, _Mustela nivalis_ of Europe and western\r\nAsia included. This aberrancy results from the retention of certain\r\nprimitive features, in the teeth and basicranial region, and from\r\nspecialization in proportions of the skull. The skull is long, deep,\r\nand narrow. These proportions probably are adaptations permitting the\r\nanimal to follow the smaller kinds of mice into their burrows. In most\r\nof that part of North America where _erminea_ and _rixosa_ occur\r\ntogether, _erminea_ is a much larger animal and takes as prey almost\r\nall kinds of land vertebrates that it is powerful enough to kill. These\r\ninclude varying hares and ptarmigans. The least weasel, _rixosa_, can\r\nhardly manage such large prey and lives on the smaller rodents.\r\n_Mustela rixosa_ may eat numbers of insects (see page 176 beyond),--a\r\nkind of food which _Mustela erminea_ is not known to eat. Apparently\r\nthe two species are able to live in the same areas because each eats a\r\nsomewhat different kind of food than does the other and hence they do\r\nnot compete to the point where one is crowded out by the other. This is\r\nthe case in the latitudes where the two species of weasels are of\r\ndifferent bodily size, but in the southernmost latitudes where these\r\ntwo species occur, _erminea_ becomes almost as small as _rixosa_ and\r\nonly one of the species, to the exclusion of the other, occurs in a\r\ngiven area. All through the Rocky Mountains, south of Montana and in\r\nthe territory west of these mountains all the way to the Pacific Coast,\r\nonly the small subspecies of _erminea_ is to be found. In the\r\nAlleghenies of the eastern United States only _rixosa_ occurs. In New\r\nEngland where _erminea_ approaches the size of _rixosa_, the latter is\r\nunknown. Probably this exclusiveness results from competition for food,\r\nalthough competition for dens, safe breeding places and other\r\nrequirements of life may be involved.\r\n\r\nThe species _erminea_ invaded the western United States and in the\r\nprocess of invasion probably developed there the small size appropriate\r\nto permit _erminea_ to live in that latitude before it could do the\r\nsame thing in the Appalachian region. Later than _erminea_, the least\r\nweasel, _Mustela rixosa_, which was small to begin with, also spread\r\nsouthward from the holarctic region, stopped short in the western\r\nUnited States at the northern boundary of the area in which _erminea_\r\nwas of small size, but in the Appalachian region of the eastern United\r\nStates continued on southward to the limits of temperature tolerant for\r\nit because _erminea_ had not yet penetrated into that region and no\r\nother small carnivore was there to offer competition.\r\n\r\nThe long-tailed weasel, _Mustela frenata_, occurs mostly south of the\r\nregions inhabited by the ermine, and mostly south of the region\r\ninhabited by the least weasel which appears to live as well with\r\n_frenata_ as with _erminea_. It is true that _erminea_ and _frenata_\r\noccur in the same region, but this is a relatively narrow belt across\r\nthe United States; and from within it a person cannot go far either\r\nnorth or south without reaching a region in which only one of the two\r\nspecies occurs. Exception has to be made for the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe Sierra Nevada, where _erminea_ is of exceptionally small size. In\r\nthese mountains and in the boreal mountainous parts of the intervening\r\nregion of the United States, _erminea_ and the large-sized _frenata_\r\noccur together over a wide area. Presumably the two occupy different\r\necologic niches, much as _rixosa_ and _frenata_ probably do where they\r\noccur together.\r\n\r\nMost of the geographic range of the long-tailed weasel, _M. frenata_,\r\nis in the temperate region. Structurally, this species is the most\r\nadvanced of the American weasels. Its dentition is the most highly\r\nspecialized for cutting. M1 is relatively small and the inner lobe is\r\nslightly larger than the outer lobe. The skull, throughout, is more\r\nmodeled than in the other species; the rostrum, the lower jaws and the\r\nteeth--all parts of the offensive equipment--are well developed\r\nrelative to the corresponding structures in other weasels; the\r\nbasicranial region exhibits an advanced stage of development in that\r\nthe tympanic bullae show the maximum degree of inflation. Also, they\r\nare thrust far out of the braincase, thereby providing more room for\r\nthe relatively larger brain which is protected by a more solidly built\r\nbraincase than in _erminea_.\r\n\r\nSeveral subspecies of _Mustela frenata_ occur in the tropics, that is\r\nto say, south of the Mexican tableland and on the coastal plain to the\r\neast of it. Each is structurally more primitive than subspecies of the\r\ntemperate region. As compared with _Mustela frenata frenata_ of the\r\ntemperate Mexican tableland the size in these tropical subspecies is\r\nsmaller; the tail is shorter; the braincase and entire skull are less\r\nmodeled; the postorbital breadth is more; the teeth are smaller; the\r\ndeuterocone of P4 is not so far anterior to the protocone; the tympanic\r\nbullae are less inflated, are farther removed from the foramen ovale,\r\nand a larger proportion of each bulla is contained within the\r\nbraincase. These features serve to set off from northern races of\r\n_frenata_ all those subspecies of _frenata_ which occur from southern\r\nMéxico southward to the northern and western limits of the Amazon\r\ndrainage of South America. The Amazon Basin is inhabited by another\r\nspecies, _Mustela africana_, having more primitive characters.\r\n\r\nIn the species _frenata_, the explanation for this abrupt change in\r\ncharacters between the animals of the temperate highlands and those of\r\nthe tropical lowlands may be this: In the early Pleistocene, after the\r\nemergence of much or all of Central America took place, weasels\r\ndistributed themselves over the Isthmus and into South America. These\r\nweasels were more generalized in structure than those now inhabiting\r\nthe uplands of México. Failure of this stock of weasels often to cross\r\nsome still-persisting water barrier, or failure of this stock to cross\r\nsome water barrier that was widened or reformed because of a rise in\r\nsea level in some one of the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene\r\ncut the _frenata_ stock into two or more parts. After the land\r\nconnection was established or re-established and when the necessary\r\nprecedent plants and rodents again had established themselves, the two\r\ngroups of weasels, one from the northern tableland of México, and the\r\nother from the southern area of tropical complexion, met. The weasels\r\nof the _frenata_ stock that reinvaded the area from the north probably\r\ndid so by following along the chain of high volcanic cones and narrow\r\nuplifts. If and when a subsequent inundation occurred in some\r\npart of Central America, weasels were stranded on the adjacent\r\nmountains--converted into islands--only the higher parts of which were\r\nabove water. _Mustela frenata costaricensis_ and _Mustela frenata\r\ngoldmani_ may be examples of a northern stock of weasel that pushed\r\nsouthward in the highlands and became stranded for a short time.\r\nFollowing the latest emergence of land to provide a continuous highway\r\nbetween the two continents, weasels from the south and the insular\r\npopulations, as for example, _M. f. costaricensis_, were the first to\r\ninvade the low tropical areas most recently under water. When the\r\nPleistocene history of Central America is better known, the facts will\r\nprovide a useful means of testing the hypothesis that has been outlined\r\nimmediately above.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, fossil specimens of _M. frenata_ from deposits of\r\nthe last half of Pleistocene time show that no appreciable change\r\noccurred in some areas, for example, in the vicinity of Hawver Cave and\r\nSamwel Cave of California, and that but slight change occurred in other\r\nareas, for example, in southern California (fossils from Rancho La\r\nBrea) and probably in the central United States (fossil from Conard\r\nFissure). It is possible to imagine, therefore, that the two groups of\r\nweasels, one occurring southward only as far as the highlands of\r\nCentral America and the other occurring in northern South America, had\r\nnot differentiated sufficiently in the period of their isolation to\r\nprevent crossbreeding when they last came into contact. If the\r\nseparation of the two groups had been maintained for a longer period,\r\nthe two groups, tropical weasels and austral weasels, probably would\r\nhave been so different when the two met as to prevent crossbreeding and\r\nthey would have constituted two full species instead of only one.\r\n\r\n_Mustela africana_ is the most primitive of the American weasels. Some\r\nof the most important structural features that mark it as such are in\r\nthe basicranial region. The tympanic bullae are less inflated than in\r\nother weasels, are pointed anteriorly and posteriorly, and do not have\r\nthe lateral margins carried outward to the outer margins of the\r\nbraincase. The mastoid sinus is not involved, by inflation or marked\r\nmodification in the production of the auditory complex. Between the\r\nalisphenoid and the squamosal there is a clear demarcation posteriorly\r\nfrom a point directly lateral to the foramen ovale. This demarcation\r\npermits a transverse rounding of the alisphenoid to form a longitudinal\r\nridge between the anterior margin of each bulla and the base of the\r\npterygoid of the same side. Nevertheless, there is no such\r\nspecialization of this primitive, structural feature such as occurs in\r\nsome African and Asiatic mustelids in which the tympano-pterygoid part\r\nof the alisphenoid fuses with the tip of the hamulus of the pterygoid.\r\nHowever, the tympano-pterygoid eminence has not been obliterated in _M.\r\nafricana_ as it has in the other American weasels. Another primitive\r\nfeature in the basicranial region of _M. africana_ is the tendency\r\ntoward separation of the paroccipital processes from the tympanic\r\nbullae. The thenar pad of the foot probably is an inheritance from a\r\nprimitive ancestor since the pad is present in the viverrids and in a\r\nmajority of mustelids judged to be more primitive than _Mustela_.\r\n\r\nSome specializations are obvious in _Mustela africana_. One is the\r\nreduction in number of premolars; p2 is absent whereas it is normally\r\npresent in the other weasels; P2 has one instead of two roots; and, in\r\nrelation to the other teeth, m2 is smaller. The shortness of the\r\npreorbital part of the skull in relation to the length of the skull as\r\na whole may reflect the mentioned reduction of the premolars or\r\nretention of a primitive shape of skull, or both. Also, certain\r\nfeatures which denote immaturity in other weasels are retained in\r\nadults of this species, as for example, sutures on the dorsal face of\r\nthe preorbital region of the skull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 17-22.

Drawn from relaxed feet of dried skins.]\r\n\r\n_Mustela africana_, all characters considered, is the most aberrant of\r\nthe American weasels. That is to say, greater difference prevails\r\nbetween _M. africana_ and any other American weasel than exists between\r\nany other two American weasels. The distinctive cranial and dental\r\ncharacters, excepting the reduction in number of premolars, are of a\r\nprimitive nature. For example, the relatively wide postorbital region,\r\nthe large braincase that is inflated anteriorly, and the flattened\r\ntympanic bullae are points of resemblance to the holarctic _Mustela\r\nerminea_, the species which is regarded as most closely resembling the\r\nstem form. Also, the mentioned characters in adults of _M. africana_\r\nresemble ontogenic stages passed through by other weasels.\r\nConsequently, it is thought that _M. africana_ crossed the\r\nfilter-barrier from North America to South America, remained isolated\r\nfrom the original stock for a length of time sufficient to permit\r\n_africana_ to differentiate from North American weasels and _vice\r\nversa_ to such a degree that crossbreeding with the _frenata_ stock was\r\nprevented when _frenata_, at a later time, pushed southward over the,\r\nthen zoölogically less-effective, water barrier, or continental bridge\r\nif it was by this time in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Diagram indicating probable relationships of\r\nthe species of American weasels.]\r\n\r\nThe four full species of American weasels may well be thought of as\r\nhaving the same stem form of which _erminea_ is the most nearly direct\r\ndescendant. Geographic and climatic changes may have operated to\r\nisolate, and then to foster morphologic differentiation of, first\r\n_rixosa_ in Eurasia, next _africana_, third the _tropicalis_ section of\r\n_M. frenata_, and finally _M. frenata_ itself, leaving _M. erminea_ as\r\na modern version, somewhat altered to be sure, of the stem form. Some\r\nof these ideas are expressed in figure 16. The climate is different in\r\nthe ranges of the several species and the climate has changed through\r\ntime in the ranges of at least many subspecies. Natural selection of\r\nmorphological features best adapted to a particular kind of climate\r\nprobably has altered some species more than others. _M. erminea_ in\r\nalmost every one of its characteristics is generalized and potentially\r\nprogressive whereas _africana_ retains more characters which are truly\r\nprimitive along with a few which are specializations. _M. africana_ is\r\npotentially the least progressive of any of the American weasels. The\r\nmost specialized weasels are the North American races of _Mustela\r\nfrenata_. A progressive series of increasing specialization is\r\ncomprised in (1) _M. africana_, (2) the _M. tropicalis_ (Central\r\nAmerican, lowland) section of _M. frenata_, and (3) the races of _M.\r\nfrenata_ in North America.\r\n\r\nConsidering now features of the environment which have obviously\r\ninfluenced the distribution and speciation of weasels, water barriers\r\nare important. Bering Strait, Carquinez Strait (along with San\r\nFrancisco Bay) which opens through the Golden Gate, and the channels\r\nbetween the islands of southeastern Alaska, have contributed to the\r\nformation of subspecies. The difference is really slight on the two\r\nsides of Bering Strait and San Francisco Bay and is slightly more on\r\ntwo sides of each of several of the channels between the islands of\r\nsoutheastern Alaska. The differences between the weasels on the two\r\nsides of one of these water barriers supposedly result from the\r\npreservation in animals on one side, or on one island, of small\r\nmutations, which would be swamped by crossbreeding if the water barrier\r\nwere not present. The effect of this isolation is easily seen if\r\nermines from the Queen Charlotte Islands are compared with those of the\r\nopposite mainland. The degree of morphological difference is great.\r\nIsolationwise, the Queen Charlotte Islands are the seaward end of a\r\nchain, beginning with Admiralty Island in southeastern Alaska, and are\r\nfarther from the mainland, zoölogically, than the distance in actual\r\nmiles across the water channel would suggest. Between any two islands\r\nthat are geographically consecutive, however, and between the mainland\r\nand the first island of the chain, the difference in the ermines is\r\nsmall. In other places, water barriers of equal or greater width have\r\ncontributed little if anything to the differentiation from one another\r\nof weasels on the two sides of the water barrier. The strait between\r\neastern Canada and Newfoundland is an example.\r\n\r\nThe absence of water, or scarcity of it to a degree that closely\r\napproaches absence, in any large area appears to prevent weasels from\r\nliving there. At any rate, the one sizeable region of North America\r\nfrom which weasels are unknown is the desert of the southwestern United\r\nStates and adjoining part of northwestern México. More precisely, in\r\nwestern Arizona, the Mohave Desert and the desert of northwestern\r\nSonora, collectors of mammals have repeatedly sought small carnivores\r\nwithout ever finding any weasels.\r\n\r\nDegree of moisture is closely correlated with color in weasels.\r\nHumidity and cloudiness as well as actual precipitation seem to be\r\ninvolved. Even if we take into account average annual rainfall alone,\r\nthe darkest-colored weasels are found in the areas of heaviest rainfall\r\nand the lightest-colored weasels in areas of lightest rainfall (extreme\r\ntype of desert where no weasels occur being excepted). In any large\r\nregion where there is a geographic gradient in rainfall, the transition\r\nfrom light to dark color almost exactly parallels the increase in\r\namount of rainfall. Within a given species the same color reappears in\r\nwidely separated areas that have the same amount and seasonal\r\ndistribution of rainfall. This correlation is repeated so often that\r\none can almost certainly say that heavy rainfall, or the associated\r\nphenomena of high humidity and cloudiness, acting separately or\r\ntogether, causes an increase in intensity of color. Relative extent of\r\nthe color of the upper parts and underparts and presence and absence of\r\nlight facial markings seem also to be correlated, in a more general\r\nway, with differences in rainfall. A fuller discussion of the nature\r\nand amount of the variation in color is given on page 51.\r\n\r\nTemperature seems not to be an important factor in directly limiting\r\nthe distribution of weasels, since _M. frenata_ occurs from the hottest\r\nto some of the coldest parts of the Americas. Do _M. erminea_ and _M.\r\nrixosa_ range no farther south, than they do at present, because high\r\ntemperatures constitute a barrier? No evidence is known to me which\r\nprovides an answer, one way or the other, to this question. Granting\r\nthat temperature is unimportant in limiting the distribution of\r\nweasels, it seems to cause geographic variation. Increase in mean\r\nannual temperature is correlated with decreased size in _M. erminea_\r\nand with increased size in _M. rixosa_. Temperature, it seems, causes\r\nthe hair to vary; the pelage is harsher and sparser in weasels from\r\ntropical regions than in those from boreal regions. Difference in\r\nnumber of hairs is especially well shown on the soles of the feet. In\r\nthe weasels from the far north, the pads are concealed by hair and in\r\nthe weasels from the tropical regions the soles are mostly bare. Also,\r\nthe hair on the soles of the feet is longer in northern than in\r\nsouthern weasels. Furthermore there is seasonal change in length of the\r\nhair on the soles of the feet; at a given locality in southern Canada\r\nthe hair of the white winter coat is so long on the soles of the feet\r\nas to obscure completely the palmar and plantar pads whereas the hair\r\nof the brown summer coat is shorter and leaves these pads boldly\r\nexposed to view. This seasonal change, as would be expected, is most\r\nmarked in animals of northern regions and is not perceptible in those\r\nfrom the tropics; it is correlated with increase in seasonal change as\r\nthe distance from the equator increases.\r\n\r\nTemperature and moisture acting together may cause extensive white\r\nfacial markings, that neither alone would cause. In _Mustela frenata_\r\nthese markings occur where there is heavy rainfall and high mean annual\r\ntemperature. Where there is heavy rainfall and a low mean annual\r\ntemperature they do not occur and where there is high mean annual\r\ntemperature and light rainfall the markings are not pure white but are\r\nof the same color as the underparts. Plate I and the description of\r\ncolor on page 51 may be consulted in this connection. Extremely high\r\nmean annual temperature together with extremely heavy rainfall may\r\ninhibit the development of light facial markings. _M. f. meridana_,\r\n_panamensis_ and _costaricensis_ are cases in point. In either\r\ndirection, north or south, from the territory inhabited by these three\r\nsubspecies a similar combination of temperature and rainfall is found\r\nand similar light facial markings appear there.\r\n\r\nConsidering the delicate response of structure to climate, a person\r\nnaturally questions whether or not natural selection accounts for all\r\nof the differences between subspecies. To show that natural selection\r\ndetermines the color of _Mustela frenata_, it would be necessary to\r\nassume that climate, color, and utility of color are positively\r\ncorrelated. Although climate (rainfall) and color are correlated in\r\nsuch a manner that three subspecies of weasel in places as far apart as\r\nNew England, Perú, and the state of Washington are colored alike, other\r\nfeatures of the three environments are unlike. Kinds of animals which\r\nthe weasel catches for food, and flora in which the weasel finds\r\nconcealment, are dissimiliar. If natural selection alone determined the\r\ncolor, some difference in color would be expected between the weasel\r\nwhich needed to be obliteratively colored, that is camouflaged, the\r\nbetter to catch a _Phyllotis_ in Perú and the weasel in Washington\r\nwhich needed nature's aid in catching _Microtus_. _Mustela frenata\r\ngoldmani_ of the highlands of southern México, which is known to attack\r\nthe huge pocket gophers, _Orthogeomys_ and _Cratogeomys_, has a weaker\r\ndental armature than _Mustela frenata texensis_ which does not have to\r\novercome prey so formidable as does _goldmani_. Equally formidable\r\nenemies endanger _M. f. goldmani_ and _texensis_. Examples of this\r\nnature could be multiplied. Without actually proving anything\r\nconcerning selection, these examples give reason for us to suppose that\r\nsome characters are not determined by natural selection.\r\n\r\nAnother question upon which data obtained from a study of _Mustela_ has\r\nsome bearing, is this: Where the geographic ranges of two subspecies\r\nmeet, why does not the swamping effect of crossbreeding cause one\r\nsubspecies to disappear? Although swamping may have occurred in some\r\ninstances, it does not occur in the majority of instances. Witness the\r\nlong-continued existence of the living subspecies _Mustela frenata\r\nnevadensis_ of which skulls are available from Pleistocene deposits.\r\nTherefore, its distinctive characters, cranially at least, have been\r\nmaintained for a long time. Furthermore, these characters are\r\nmaintained over a large geographic region more than a thousand miles\r\nacross. On the eastern margin of its range, at the eastern base of the\r\nRocky Mountains in Colorado, _M. f. nevadensis_ intergrades in a\r\nrelatively narrow belt with the lighter-colored, longer-tailed and\r\ncranially different _Mustela frenata longicauda_, which has a\r\ngeographic range almost equally extensive. _M. f. longicauda_ also is\r\nuniform in its characters over a large area but at approximately 400\r\nmiles east of the base of the Rocky Mountains, it begins to intergrade\r\nwith the darker-colored, shorter-tailed and cranially different\r\n_Mustela frenata primulina_ and does so over a belt of 100 miles or\r\nmore in width. At any given locality within this wide belt of\r\nintergradation the range of individual variation ordinarily does not\r\nexceed that in animals from a given locality well within the geographic\r\nrange of _M. f. longicauda_. In the narrow belt of intergradation along\r\nthe eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, the range of individual\r\nvariation at several places is greater than in animals from a given\r\nlocality well within the geographic range of _M. f. longicauda_ or for\r\nthat matter from well within the geographic range of _M. f.\r\nnevadensis_.\r\n\r\nConsidering the dominance and recessiveness of genes and the genetic\r\nmechanism in general by which characteristics of offspring are\r\ninherited from their parents, it would seem that _M. f. longicauda_ and\r\nfor that matter _M. f. nevadensis_ and _M. f. primulina_ would lose\r\ntheir distinctive characteristics because of the crossbreeding that is\r\nevery year going on between _longicauda_ and _nevadensis_ on the one\r\nhand and between _longicauda_ and _primulina_ on the other hand.\r\n\r\nSumner (1932:84) suggests that homogeneity is prevented by population\r\npressure. Applying his suggestion to the species _Mustela frenata_ we\r\ncould say that the subspecies _longicauda_ pressing westward meets\r\nstrong pressure from the subspecies _nevadensis_ pressing eastward and\r\nthat the width of the zone of intergradation between the two subspecies\r\nvaries inversely with the strength of the population pressure from the\r\ntwo sides. Sumner recognizes that according to his hypothesis the two\r\ncontiguous races would remain distinct only so long as there was a\r\npreponderance of centrifugal movement from both of the centers of\r\ndispersal. Sumner (_op. cit._:85) recognizes that an abrupt change of\r\nenvironmental conditions could account in part for the boundaries of\r\nthe ranges of the two subspecies and finally that his hypothesis does\r\nnot certainly answer the question of why crossbreeding does not result\r\nin homogeneity between two subspecies with contiguous geographic\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of harmoniously stabilized complexes of genes was\r\noffered by Timofeeff-Ressovsky (1940:124) to explain why the swamping\r\neffect of crossbreeding does not obliterate subspecies. The hypothesis\r\ntakes into account that any one of several characters of a subspecies\r\nmay be caused by several genes. Some characters of this kind may be\r\nfavored by natural selection more than others. In the belt of\r\nintergradation between two subspecies, where two of these favored\r\ncharacters meet, a \"biological tension\" as Huxley (1939:415) terms it\r\n\"will result, which will produce _partial discontinuity_ between the\r\ntwo groups. Each group will evolve a gene-complex which is not only\r\nbroadly adapted to the external environment of the central area of its\r\nrange, but is also harmoniously stabilized, in adaptation to the\r\ninternal genetic environment, by the selection of modifiers.\" Crosses,\r\nthat is to say intergrades, between the two subspecies will lack this\r\nstabilization and will therefore be at a selective disadvantage. The\r\nzone of intergradation will therefore remain narrow; intermediates are\r\nconstantly being brought into existence there by crossing but are as\r\nconstantly being extinguished by selection.\r\n\r\nThese two hypotheses are the best that geneticists yet have offered.\r\nNeither has been tested and both, as originally proposed, would hardly\r\napply everywhere because there are some contradictions.\r\n\r\nI can offer no better explanation--in fact no original one as good--but\r\nwould emphasize that under similar climate, weasels remain constant in\r\ncharacter, or at most do not vary beyond certain limits. Crossing at\r\nthe margins of ranges of two subspecies does not result in homogeneity\r\nof weasels. There is, therefore, some stabilizing influence, or\r\ninfluences, that maintain, and even develop, structural characteristics\r\nof weasels in opposition to the contrary tendency of crossing.\r\n\r\nThat this influence not only maintains uniform characters over areas of\r\nlarge extent, but also permitted their development over large\r\ngeographic areas, must logically be supposed, for otherwise,\r\nconsidering the swamping effect of crossing, such variations would not\r\nhave made their appearance in more than a few individuals. Also, if the\r\nraces had been formed in response to some kind of physiological\r\ndifferentiation, or other non-climatic cause, the characters of the\r\npopulation in the belt of intergradation probably would disappear in a\r\nshort time. In any event the close correlation between degree of change\r\nin weasels and degree of change in climate, at once makes one suspect\r\nthat climate has been the deciding factor. Finally, when one recalls\r\nthat in certain parts of the animal, certain characters invariably\r\nappear under similar climates and never under dissimilar climates, the\r\nevidence is almost conclusive that, given long enough time, the animals\r\nvary in response to climate. The variations (characters) may be induced\r\nindirectly, but are no less exactly reproduced than if they can be\r\nshown to be induced directly.\r\n\r\nIn considering how the species and subspecies of American weasels were\r\nformed and in attempting to account for some of the individual\r\ncharacters, it is profitable to view the facts in the light of some of\r\nthe theories of species-formation--theories that are accessory to that\r\nof organic descent and that are concerned with the _modus operandi_ of\r\norganic descent.\r\n\r\nIn any group of closely related species some of them, by the laws of\r\nchance, are almost certain to be more primitive than others. _Mustela_\r\nis no exception and the more primitive species closely match, in\r\nseveral characters, ontogenetic stages passed through by more advanced\r\nspecies. Jaeckel's (1902) theory of metakinesis, therefore, is to be\r\nconsidered since it postulates that many cases of epistasis occur; that\r\nis to say, that many sexually adult animals are arrested in\r\ndevelopment in early otogenetic stages and undergo no further\r\ndevelopment. Although this theory is appealing upon initial\r\nconsideration, it is less so when we recall that in _Mustela_ there is\r\na direct correlation of increasingly primitive structure with\r\ndecreasing latitude as one proceeds from the steppe of North America\r\nsouthward to the equator. It follows that the conditions seen in\r\n_Mustela_ can be explained even better than by metakinesis, by assuming\r\nthat the several species have differentiated from a stem form at\r\ndifferent times, have developed at different rates, have developed in\r\ndifferent directions and that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Age and Area (see Willis, 1922) holds that the species of\r\nwidest distribution are, on the average, the oldest, and that the\r\nspecies which are distributed over small areas are, in general, of\r\nrecent origin. So far as the weasels are concerned, little support is\r\ngiven to this theory. The same can be said of any one of the teological\r\ntheories, including the orthogenesis of post-Darwinian writers. All of\r\nthese imply a determinate line of variation controlled by the inherent\r\nqualities of the organism. The idea that the several species of\r\n_Mustela_ result from mutations of large degree and sudden appearance\r\nis contrary to the evidence accumulated. In fact the evidence rather\r\nclearly indicates that the mutations which may have occurred were of\r\nsmall degree and in most instances owe their preservation to natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThe data obtained by the study of weasels accords almost exactly with\r\nthe theory of species-forming embodied in Matthew's (1915) \"Climate and\r\nEvolution.\" Although the essential features of this theory were made\r\nout from a study of families and orders and therefore would not be\r\nexpected to apply to members of only a genus or subgenus, the facts\r\nknown about the present distribution of American _Mustela_,\r\nnevertheless, are strikingly in accord with the ideas advanced by\r\nMatthew. In the first place, climate is an important factor in the\r\nevolution of the weasels. In the second place, the line of migration\r\nseems to have been outward from the holarctic region. In the third\r\nplace, the geographic changes necessary to explain the present\r\ndistribution of the species of _Mustela_ are not extensive and do not\r\naffect the permanency of oceans as defined by the continental shelf.\r\nThese three statements are, almost verbatim, those made in the first\r\nthree of the five points of Matthew's (1915:172-173) thesis. The\r\nremaining two points of Matthew's thesis have to do with\r\ngeneralizations based on evidence obtained from sources outside the\r\nscope of the present study.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the relative degrees of specialization of the different\r\nspecies and subspecies in relation to their geographic distribution are\r\nin accord with the ideas elaborated by Matthew. For instance, the most\r\nprimitive species is farthest south from the probable center of\r\ndispersal, the holarctic region. Also the full species become\r\nprogressively more primitive as one proceeds southward from the\r\nholarctic, or at least from the northern half of the nearctic, region.\r\nAlthough, in view of the known geological changes that have occurred in\r\nthe Caribbean region, we cannot say that the more primitive species owe\r\ntheir positions entirely to having been pushed farther south from the\r\ncenter of dispersal by actual and _continuous_ contact and competition\r\nwith the more advanced species, this seems to have been the case in a\r\ngeneral way. At any rate the more primitive kinds seem to have been\r\nprevented from pushing northward by the more advanced kinds which\r\ndeveloped there and the latter have actually pushed southward.\r\n\r\nAdditionally and in review: There is strong indication that the\r\nAmerican species of weasels were formed by gradual and slow change.\r\nMuch of this change probably is the result of natural selection\r\noperating on fortuitous variations of a minor nature, but, also,\r\nparticular features of the environment, especially climate, and more\r\nespecially amount of rainfall, seem to compel variations that\r\ndifferentiate subspecies and that characterize full species--compel\r\nsome of them without the direct operation of natural selection, or at\r\nleast compel them within limits so wide that natural selection exerts\r\nno exact control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier accounts of American weasels, from the time of Linnaeus\r\nand before, up until 1890, names then in use for European weasels\r\nfrequently were applied also to those in North America. For the next 50\r\nyears, and almost without exception after 1896, the American weasels\r\nwere regarded as specifically distinct from those in the Old World. In\r\nthis 50-year period many new names were proposed, usually as full\r\nspecies, although now that material from more localities has been\r\nbrought together and studied, geographic intergradation is evident\r\nbetween many of the named kinds and most of these names now therefore\r\ntake only subspecific rank. In 1933 Glover M. Allen showed that\r\n_Mustela rixosa_ occurred also in the Old World, and in 1943 I\r\nemphasized that a second American species, _Mustela erminea_, was\r\ncircumpolar in distribution. In neither _rixosa_, nor _erminea_,\r\nhowever, were the subspecies the same in the two continents. To this\r\ngeneral outline of the nomenclature, exception must be made for weasels\r\nof the southwestern United States, México and Central America, and\r\nSouth America, because as early as 1813 a distinctive name was given to\r\none of these and weasels from the three areas mentioned were, so far as\r\nI know, never given names of Old World kinds.\r\n\r\nThe first paper that could be regarded as revisionary in nature was\r\n\"Remarks on the species of the genus Mustela\" by the zoölogist and\r\nworld-traveler, Charles L. Bonaparte, in Charlesworth's Magazine of\r\nNatural History, for 1838. In that paper three new names, _Mustela\r\ncicognanii_, _M. richardsonii_ and _M. longicauda_, all still valid,\r\nwere proposed for American weasels.\r\n\r\nAudubon and Bachman in their \"Quadrupeds of North America,\" which\r\nappeared in parts from 1845 to 1853, recognized 5 species. Actually\r\nthey were dealing with only 3 taxonomically valid kinds. For one of\r\nthese, _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_, they were misled by the\r\ndifference in size between males and females, and in the males by the\r\npresence of a brown coat in some and a white coat in others. The male\r\nthat was white in winter they regarded as _Putorius ermineus_ of the\r\nOld World; the male that was brown in winter they designated by their\r\nearlier proposed name _P. fuscus_, and the female they named _P.\r\nagilis_. The ermine, subspecies _M. erminea cicognanii_, they called\r\n_P. pusillus_. Their fifth name, _P. frenatus_, included at least some\r\nanimals that today are assigned to the subspecies _M. frenata frenata_.\r\nEach of three and perhaps four of the five names employed by Audubon\r\nand Bachman embraced individuals of more than one species and in that\r\nsense the names were composite.\r\n\r\nOnly five years later, in 1858, Professor Spencer Fullerton Baird's\r\ngreat work, \"The Mammals of North America,\" made it clear that no\r\nAmerican weasel was identical (in the modern subspecific sense) with\r\nany Old World weasel, and he applied most of his names in a correct\r\nzoölogical sense. It is true that he thought that the female weasel of\r\nthe eastern United States was specifically different from the male,\r\nmisapplied to it the name _richardsonii_, and did not correctly\r\nallocate every one of the few poor specimens available to him of the\r\nlittle ermine (_M. e. streatori_) of the Pacific Coast; but he did\r\nrecognize that the least weasel was a distinct kind and his treatment\r\nin general was excellent.\r\n\r\nAfter Baird came a period of great confusion in which most writers did\r\nno better than had Audubon and Bachman, ordinarily confusing the two\r\nsexes as different species, and, in 1877 in his \"Fur-bearing Animals,\"\r\nElliot Coues went rather to the other extreme and allowed only 4 kinds\r\nto all of the Americas, regarding two of these, for purposes of\r\nzoölogical nomenclature, as identical with the European species.\r\n\r\nBut, in 1896 Outram Bangs published \"A Review of the Weasels of Eastern\r\nNorth America\" in which he correctly recognized eight kinds. Although\r\nsome of these were treated by him as full species, whereas the material\r\naccumulated since 1896 has shown that subspecific status is in order,\r\nhis names, still in use, were correctly applied in every instance, save\r\nprobably one. This was his use of _Putorius richardsonii_ for the\r\nanimal now known as _M. e. arctica_. Unlike the earlier, excellent\r\ntreatment by Baird, this accurate one by Bangs was heeded and followed\r\nby subsequent writers. For example, Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the same\r\nyear, 1896, accepted Bangs' conclusions except for correcting the\r\napplication of the name _richardsonii_. The principal contributions of\r\nMerriam's paper \"Synopsis of the Weasels of North America\" were first,\r\nthe wider geographic scope and second, the naming as new of several\r\nkinds outside the geographic area studied by Bangs. Otherwise the work\r\nwas not up to Dr. Merriam's usual standard and the internal evidence of\r\nhaste in its preparation and the superficial study of some of the\r\nmaterial at his disposal explain why the weasels of North America since\r\nthat time have been but little better understood than in 1896. Baird\r\nand Bangs, then, unquestionably did the best systematic work on the\r\nAmerican weasels.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 Dr. Joseph A. Allen published a valuable paper on the South\r\nAmerican weasels. The material available to him was inadequate and\r\nprevented a thoroughly satisfactory treatment. There are too few\r\nspecimens even today to permit of a thorough treatment of the South\r\nAmerican weasels in the present paper; nevertheless the material today\r\nis more nearly adequate than it was in 1916 and it is hoped that the\r\nsystematic arrangement is correspondingly improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nChronological List (annotated) of Specific and Subspecific Names\r\nApplied to American Weasels\r\n\r\nAt least eighty-seven specific and subspecific names have been proposed\r\nfor American weasels. Of these sixty-nine are now regarded as valid\r\ndesignations of recognizable subspecies. The average is 1.2 names per\r\nsubspecies. Some names in the following chronological list were a\r\nsecond time applied wholly or in part to some other kind of weasel. In\r\ngeneral, mention of the second or any other later application is\r\nomitted from the following list but two usages of _agilis_ (1844 and\r\n1853) and of _americana_ (1865) are recorded.\r\n\r\n     1734. =javonica= (_Mustela_) Seba, Locupletissimi Rerum naturalium\r\n     Thesauri ..., 1:77, 78, pl. 48, fig. 4. The weasel to which this\r\n     name was applied was said to have come from Java. Since no animal\r\n     answering to the description has again been found in Java, and\r\n     because specimens from Central America or possibly some from\r\n     northern India, may do so, it is conceivable that Seba was the\r\n     first to distinguish by name an American weasel from those in the\r\n     Old World. My attempts to locate the specimen concerned in places\r\n     where it might have been preserved along with some of the other\r\n     specimens thought to have belonged to Seba have been fruitless.\r\n     Since it is impossible positively to link Seba's description with\r\n     any known weasel, no further use is made of the name _javonica_ in\r\n     the present account.\r\n\r\n     1772. =erminea= (_Mustela_) Forster [= _Mustela erminea\r\n     richardsonii_], Philos. Trans., London, 1772:373. Forster's use of\r\n     the name is one of the earliest applications of it to American\r\n     animals. The name dates from Linnaeus, Syst. Naturae, (10th ed.)\r\n     1:46, 1758, with type locality in Europe. In the subspecific sense\r\n     the name applies to the ermine which occurs over most of the\r\n     Scandinavian Peninsula, if Miller (1912:387) be followed in\r\n     regarding the type locality as Upsala, Sweden. If, instead,\r\n     Cabrera (1913A:394-396) be followed in regarding the type locality\r\n     as in Switzerland, the name, in the subspecific sense, will apply\r\n     to the ermine of continental Europe. As the earliest available\r\n     name applied to the circumpolar species concerned, it is used now\r\n     as the name of the species in the New World as well as in the Old\r\n     World. From the time of Forster until approximately 1890 the name\r\n     _erminea_ by many, but not by all, authors was applied to the\r\n     American weasels in the belief that they were zoölogically\r\n     indistinguishable from those in the Old World. From 1896 to 1943\r\n     the name was not used by American authors at all because the\r\n     ermine of America was in 1896 treated nomenclaturally by Merriam\r\n     as specifically distinct from the animal in the Old World. Since\r\n     1943 _erminea_ has been used in the specific sense for American\r\n     animals in recognition of the circumpolar distribution of the\r\n     species. Some of the early allocations of American specimens to\r\n     _erminea_ probably resulted in a composite use of the name in that\r\n     one or another subspecies of the American species _Mustela\r\n     frenata_ may also have been included with individuals truly of the\r\n     species _erminea_.\r\n\r\n     1772. =nivalis= (_Mustela_), Forster, Philos. Trans., London,\r\n     1772:373. This is one of the early applications of this name to\r\n     American weasels of small size, made in the belief that they were\r\n     taxonomically the same in America and Europe. Linnaeus, Syst. Nat.\r\n     (12th ed.) 1:69, 1766 is the authority for the name [_Mustela_]\r\n     _nivalis_, and the Province of Vesterbotten, Sweden, is regarded\r\n     as the type locality. The name is in use today for the common\r\n     weasel of Europe and parts of Asia. Animals of the species\r\n     _nivalis_ are intermediate in size between _Mustela erminea_ and\r\n     _Mustela rixosa_. The name as used for American animals by some\r\n     authors who wrote later than Forster did, probably was composite\r\n     in that these authors may have applied the name to the small\r\n     weasels of North America and thus may have intended it to apply\r\n     not only to _Mustela erminea cicognanii_ but also to females of\r\n     _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_, and conceivably to both sexes of\r\n     _Mustela rixosa_ of any American subspecies.\r\n\r\n     1813. =Brasiliensis= (_Mustela_) Sevastianoff, Mem. Acad. Imp.\r\n     Sci. St. Petersburg, 4:356-363, table (= plate) 4. This name was\r\n     proposed for a weasel brought to St. Petersburg by Capt.\r\n     Krusenstern on his return from a voyage around the world. The\r\n     animal was said to have come from Brazil, but to judge from the\r\n     description, came instead from México, Central America, or west of\r\n     the Andes in South America, and was based on some one of the\r\n     subspecies of _Mustela frenata_. Although the name was in use for\r\n     more than 60 years it was shown by Merriam (1896:27) to be\r\n     unavailable because it was preoccupied by _Mustela brasiliensis_,\r\n     a name earlier used by Gmelin (Syst. Nat., ed. 13, p. 93, 1788)\r\n     for a South American otter.\r\n\r\n     1815. =vulgaris= (_Mustela_), Ord, Guthrie's Geography as\r\n     reprinted by Rhoads in 1894, vol. 2, p. 291. This use by Ord is\r\n     one of the earliest applications of this name to American weasels,\r\n     in the belief that the smaller weasels of North America and Europe\r\n     were zoölogically the same; [_Mustela_] _vulgaris_ seems\r\n     originally to have been proposed in 1777 by Erxleben on p. 471 of\r\n     vol. 1 of his Syst. Regni Anim., for the weasel of the temperate\r\n     part of Europe and to be a synonym of _Mustela nivalis_ Linnaeus\r\n     (1766). Probably the name as used by Ord was composite in the\r\n     sense that he may have intended it to apply to females of _Mustela\r\n     frenata noveboracensis_ as well as to one or both sexes of\r\n     _Mustela erminea cicognanii_ and, if he ever saw them, to the two\r\n     sexes of _Mustela rixosa_ (one or several subspecies).\r\n\r\n     1818. =africana= (_Mustela_) Desmarest [= _Mustela africana\r\n     africana_], Nouv. Diction, d. Hist. Nat., 19:376. In 1808 E.\r\n     Geoffroy St.-Hilaire visited Portugal and was given several\r\n     African primates and the specimen of _Mustela_ named by Desmarest\r\n     in 1818 who wrongly supposed that it, like most of the primates,\r\n     came originally from Africa. After the name had been misapplied\r\n     for 95 years Angel Cabrera showed that it pertained instead to the\r\n     tropical weasel of Brazil. Of distinctive names applied to\r\n     American weasels today, this is the one first proposed.\r\n\r\n     1832. =frenata= (_Mustela_) Lichtenstein [= _Mustela frenata\r\n     frenata_], Darstellung neuer oder wenig bekannter Säugethiere, pl.\r\n     42 and corresponding text unpaged. This name is the first one\r\n     available for the long-tailed weasel and therefore applies to the\r\n     species as a whole.\r\n\r\n     1838. =Cicognanii= (_Mustela_) Bonaparte [= _Mustela erminea\r\n     cicognanii_], Charlesworth's Mag. Nat. Hist., 2:38. The name\r\n     erroneously spelled _Cigognanii_ was correctly spelled on page 39.\r\n     For a detailed consideration of this name see the account of the\r\n     subspecies _cicognanii_ on page 120.\r\n\r\n     1838. =Richardsonii= (_Mustela_) Bonaparte [= _Mustela erminea\r\n     richardsonii_], Charlesworth's Mag. Nat. Hist., 2:39. Until 1896\r\n     the name sometimes was applied to the subspecies now known as _M.\r\n     e. arctica_ and sometimes to part of the subspecies now designated\r\n     as _M. e. cicognanii_ under the principal treatment of which see\r\n     (page 120) for a detailed account of the basis of the name\r\n     _=richardsonii=_, and the reasons for regarding Fort Franklin as\r\n     the type locality.\r\n\r\n     1838. =longicauda= (_Mustela_) Bonaparte [= _=Mustela frenata\r\n     longicauda=_], Charlesworth's Mag. Nat. Hist., 2:39. The type\r\n     locality appears to be Carlton House, Saskatchewan, and the name\r\n     always seems to have been applied to the long-tailed weasel of the\r\n     Great Plains, although in some earlier accounts the name was used\r\n     in a more inclusive sense to refer also to animals now of\r\n     subspecies closely allied to _longicauda_. As with the two\r\n     preceding names, a detailed consideration of the basis for, and\r\n     application of, this name is given on pages 120-123 in the account\r\n     of _Mustela erminea cicognanii_.\r\n\r\n     1840. =Noveboracensis= (_Putorius_) Emmons [= _Mustela frenata\r\n     noveboracensis_], Quadrupeds of Mass., p. 45. This name was\r\n     credited by Emmons to De Kay who in the same year published it in\r\n     his report on the \"Zoology of New York\" but without a description\r\n     and De Kay's name is a _nomen nudum_. Emmons' was the first use of\r\n     the name accompanied by a recognizable description and therefore\r\n     the name must date from Emmons although this obviously was not his\r\n     intent since he credited the name to De Kay.\r\n\r\n     1842. =fuscus= (_Putorius_) Audubon and Bachman [= _Mustela\r\n     frenata noveboracensis_], Jour.

Hist. of New York, Zool., Pt. 1, Mammalia, p.\r\n     34. This name was proposed for small weasels of 12 to 13 inches in\r\n     length of which the tail amounted to a fourth of the same and\r\n     although obviously applying in considerable part to the earlier\r\n     named _M. e. cicognanii_ seems to have included some individuals\r\n     of the also earlier named _M. f. noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\n     1843. =xanthogenys= (_Mustela_) Gray [= _Mustela frenata\r\n     xanthogenys_], Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 11:118, February, 1843,\r\n     was applied to all of the long-tailed weasels of California that\r\n     had light-colored facial markings. Merriam in 1896 suggested that\r\n     San Diego was the type locality and in 1899 Bangs proposed the\r\n     name _mundus_ for the California weasel north of San Francisco Bay\r\n     thus restricting the application of the name _xanthogenys_. In\r\n     1936 Hall further restricted the application of the name and\r\n     applied it to the long-tailed weasel of the big interior valley of\r\n     California, pointing out that the name was correctly applied to\r\n     this weasel of the big interior valley or possibly instead to the\r\n     race named _munda_.\r\n\r\n     1844. =agilis= (_Mustela_) Tschudi [= _Mustela frenata agilis_],\r\n     Untersuch. ü. die Fauna Peruana, p. 110, is a name applied today\r\n     to the race of weasel of the Temperate Zone of the western Andes\r\n     and intermountain valleys of Perú.\r\n\r\n     1851. =nigripes= (_Putorius_) Audubon and Bachman [= _Mustela\r\n     nigripes_], Quadr.

Quadrupeds N. Amer., 3:184, pl.\r\n     140. This name was proposed for the female in the mistaken belief\r\n     that it was specifically distinct from the larger male for which\r\n     several names already were available. Also Tschudi in 1844 had\r\n     already used the name _Mustela agilis_ for a South American\r\n     weasel.\r\n\r\n     1864. =aureoventris= (_Mustela_) Gray [= _Mustela frenata\r\n     aureoventris_], Proc.

Zoöl.\r\n     Soc. London, 1865:111. The larger individuals of American weasels\r\n     of both _Mustela erminea_ and _Mustela frenata_ from the Atlantic\r\n     Coast to as far west as Carlton House, Saskatchewan, were lumped\r\n     under this name because Gray desired more information than he then\r\n     had before recognizing as different from one another several\r\n     species proposed for America up to the time concerned. The name is\r\n     unavailable because it is preoccupied by _Mustela americana_\r\n     Turton (1806) the name for the American marten.\r\n\r\n     1865. =americana= (_Mustela vulgaris_ Var.) Gray, Proc. Zoöl. Soc.\r\n     London, 1865:113. Under this name the smaller weasels of the\r\n     northern and northeastern part of North America were lumped by\r\n     Gray but the name is preoccupied and can be ignored.\r\n\r\n     1874. =affinis= (_Mustela_) Gray [= _Mustela frenata affinis_],\r\n     Ann. and Mag.

In the past the name has\r\n     been regarded as a _nomen nudum_ but there is some reason for\r\n     regarding it as having nomenclatural status. In either event it is\r\n     here arranged as pertaining to the long-tailed weasel of the Great\r\n     Plains which takes the prior name _longicauda_.

short; body relatively long; adults 190 mm. to 700\r\nmm. in total length; skull ranging in basilar length from 16 to 70 mm.;\r\nfacial angle slight; tympanic bullae greatly inflated (moderately in\r\n_Lutreola_), cancellous, and with paroccipital processes closely\r\nappressed to bullae; palate behind upper molars; dental formula:\r\n\r\n  I  3  C  1  P  2-3  M  1\r\n  -, -; -, -; -, ---; -, -; inner moiety of M1 larger than outer; P4\r\n  i  3  c  1  p  3-2  m  2\r\n\r\nwith simple deuterocone; in m1 inner moiety of M1 larger than outer; P4\r\nwith simple deuterocone; in m1 trigonid longer than talonid, metaconid\r\nabsent (incipiently developed in _Lutreola_), and talonid trenchant.\r\n\r\nFor many years prior to 1911, the name _Mustela_ was applied to\r\nmartens, and _Putorius_ was regarded as the first available generic\r\nname for the weasels. In 1911 Thomas (1911:139) showed that _M.\r\nerminea_ (_Mustela_ of Gesner) by tautonymy was the type of _Mustela_\r\nand subsequently the generic name _Mustela_ has been used for the true\r\nweasels which include the American weasels to which we now apply the\r\nspecific names _erminea_, _rixosa_ and _frenata_. The mink, _Mustela\r\n(Lutreola) vison_, and the black-footed ferret, _Mustela (Putorius)\r\nnigripes_, since 1911 also have been referred by most American authors\r\nto the genus _Mustela_, the names _Lutreola_ and _Putorius_ being\r\nregarded by these authors as having no more than subgeneric status.\r\nEuropean writers, on the other hand, accord greater taxonomic weight to\r\nthe zoölogical differences between ferrets and weasels and, therefore,\r\naccord full generic rank to _Putorius_. Consequently, for the\r\nblack-footed ferret, Europeans today write _Putorius nigripes_ and\r\nAmericans write _Mustela nigripes_. For the same reasons, the name of\r\nthe mink is written by some European zoölogists _Lutreola vison_ and by\r\nAmerican zoölogists _Mustela vison_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF SYSTEMATIC TREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor each full species there will be found under the account of it the\r\nfollowing information: Type, statement of geographic range, selected\r\ncharacters for ready recognition, other characters of the species, a\r\nsummary of geographic variation, and information on habits, in the\r\norder mentioned.\r\n\r\nFor each subspecies, information is presented in the following order:\r\nearliest available zoölogical name, synonyms, type, geographic range,\r\nzoölogical characters for ready recognition, description (mentioning\r\nsize, certain external features including color, the skull and teeth)\r\nhistorical material when warranted, remarks which may elaborate on\r\npoints made in preceding paragraphs, and other information thought to\r\nbe useful, and finally a list of specimens examined.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of certain of these categories it should be said that in\r\nthe synonymy no attempt is made to list every published reference to\r\nthe subspecies concerned. It is aimed, however, to include at least one\r\ncitation to each name-combination that has been applied, to the\r\nsubspecies concerned, along with other especially important references.\r\nMere records of occurrence are not regarded as especially important and\r\ncitations to them ordinarily are omitted in the synonymy. No comma is\r\nplaced between the zoölogical name and the name of the author who\r\ncoined and first used the name in accordance with the rules of\r\nzoölogical nomenclature. Otherwise a comma is interposed between the\r\nzoölogical name and the name of the user (author). When the accepted\r\n(earliest available) name of a subspecies at the head of any one of the\r\nfollowing accounts is combined with a generic name different from that\r\nwith which it originally was placed, the authority for the name is set\r\nin parentheses. The same rule is followed with the name of a full\r\nspecies when it is written without any subspecific name following.\r\nParentheses in such situations, therefore, denote that for the terminal\r\npart of the scientific name there has been a change in generic name\r\nwith which the terminal part of the scientific name is here associated.\r\n\r\nIn the paragraph headed \"characters for ready recognition,\" only a few\r\ncharacters, namely, those regarded as most useful for identification\r\nwhen the student has limited time, are mentioned. Other features useful\r\nfor distinguishing the kind of animal in question from its near\r\nrelatives are to be found in the description and comparisons.\r\n\r\nIn the description, external measurements, unless otherwise indicated,\r\nare those recorded by the collector on the label attached to the skin.\r\nTotal length is the distance from the tip of the pad on the nose to the\r\ntip of the fleshy part of the tail when the relaxed animal is laid out\r\nstraight, not stretched. This measurement does not include the hairs\r\nthat project beyond the end of the fleshy part of the tail. Length of\r\ntail is the distance from the base of the tail, when it is bent at\r\nright angles to the long axis of the body, to the tip of the fleshy\r\npart of the tail excluding the hairs that project beyond the fleshy\r\npart of the tail. Length of tail and length of tail-vertebrae are\r\nsynonymous. Length of hind foot is measured from the proximal end of\r\nthe calcaneum to the tip of the longest claw.\r\n\r\nCapitalized color terms, unless otherwise indicated, refer to Ridgway's\r\n(1912) _Color Standards and Color Nomenclature_. Some use is made of\r\ncolor terms taken from Oberthür and Dauthenay (1905) because those\r\nauthors show a much larger number of shades between dark brown and\r\nblack than does Ridgway (1912). The colors of the upper parts of most\r\nweasels are some shade or other of dark brown. Color terms that do not\r\nhave the initial letter capitalized do not refer to any one standard\r\nand consequently are used in a general sense.\r\n\r\nRelative extents of the color of the upper parts and underparts are\r\ncomputed from measurements of the circumference of the body at the\r\nplace where the color of the underparts is narrowest. Ordinarily this\r\nplace is in the lumbar region rather than in the thoracic region.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of how cranial measurements were taken is given on page\r\n417. In designating teeth, capital letters are used for teeth in the\r\nupper jaw and lower case letters are used for teeth in the lower jaw.\r\nFor example: I2 denotes the second incisor tooth in the upper jaw and\r\ni2 denotes the second incisor tooth in the lower jaw; C1 and c1 refer\r\nto the canine tooth of the upper jaw and lower jaw, respectively; P3\r\nand p3 refer to the third premolar of the upper jaw and lower jaw,\r\nrespectively, bearing in mind that the first (anterior) premolar is\r\nabsent in the lower jaw and upper jaw of weasels (see fig. 31 on page\r\n416), as also, in some kinds of weasels, is the second premolar; M1 and\r\nm1 refer to the first molar of the upper jaw and lower jaw\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nIn describing the skull and teeth the two sexes are treated separately\r\nbecause differences in shape as well as size are the rule. Unless\r\notherwise indicated, the skulls on which descriptions are based are of\r\nadults. Weights of skulls include the weight of the lower jaws. In\r\ngeneral, every second subspecies is described. For a subspecies\r\ngeographically next adjacent to the one described, only the\r\ndifferences between the two are enumerated. This method of description\r\nindicates also likenesses and is more economical of words than some\r\nother methods of description. Also, by use of this method, cross\r\nreference is reduced to one other subspecies. Following this formal\r\ndescription, there is a comparison of the cranial and dental characters\r\nwith those of geographically adjacent subspecies.\r\n\r\nIn the paragraph headed \"Remarks\" the two words \"character\" and\r\n\"structure\" frequently appear. The word structure here is used to mean\r\nsome part of an animal, as for example, a hair, a muscle, a bone, or an\r\ninternal organ. A structure is not a system, as for example, the\r\ndigestive system or osseous system. A character is some weight, linear\r\ndimension, volume, shape, color, or other perceptible attribute of a\r\nstructure, of a system, or of an entire organism.\r\n\r\nIn recording the localities of capture of specimens examined, effort\r\nhas been made to be exactly as precise as the locality data on the\r\nlabels of the specimens permit. The word \"County\" is written out in\r\nfull when the name of the county is written on the label of each\r\nspecimen listed from that county. When one specimen, or more, here\r\nassigned to a given county lacks the name of the county on the label,\r\nthen the abbreviation \"_Co_.\" is used. The surprising frequency with\r\nwhich the same place name is repeated in a given state or province\r\nmakes it desirable for the collector to write the name of the county,\r\nor corresponding minor political subdivision, on labels of study\r\nspecimens at the time they are prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\n=MUSTELA ERMINEA= Linnaeus\r\n\r\nErmine\r\n\r\n(Synonymy under subspecies)\r\n\r\n     _Type._--_Mustela erminea_ Linnaeus, Systema Naturae, 10th ed., p.\r\n     46, 1758.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--From the British Isles and Atlantic Coast of Europe\r\n     across Eurasia and North America including Greenland, from the\r\n     northernmost land, south, in North America, to the lower margin of\r\n     the Canadian Life-zone; geographically south to Connecticut, New\r\n     York, Pennsylvania, northeastern Ohio, southern Michigan,\r\n     Wisconsin, northern Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, in the Rocky\r\n     Mountains to northern New Mexico, in the Sierra Nevada to Mono\r\n     County, California, and on the Pacific Coast to the Golden Gate.\r\n\r\n_Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _Mustela rixosa_ in\r\npresence of black pencil on tail, tail-vertebrae more than a fourth of\r\nlength of head and body, and in regions where the two species occur\r\ntogether, basilar length of skull more than 32.5 in males and more than\r\n31.0 in females; from _Mustela frenata_, in regions where the two\r\nspecies occur together, by tail less than 44 per cent of length of head\r\nand body and by postglenoidal length of skull more than 46 per cent of\r\ncondylobasal length in males and more than 48 per cent in females.\r\n\r\n_Characters of the species._--Size medium to small (total length 225 to\r\n340 mm. in males and 190 to 290 mm. in females); tail 30 to 45 per cent\r\nof length of head and body, with distinct black pencil; caudal\r\nvertebrae 16 to 19; skull with long braincase and short precranial\r\nportion; postglenoidal length, when expressed as a percentage of the\r\ncondylobasal length, more than 48 in females and ordinarily more than\r\n46 in males; upper parts brown; underparts whitish, ordinarily\r\ncontinuous from chin to inguinal region but in subspecies in the humid\r\nregion along the Pacific Coast interrupted in some individuals by brown\r\nof upper parts encircling body in the abdominal region. The soles of\r\nthe feet in each of the subspecies are densely haired in winter and\r\nhave only a relatively small area of the foot-pads exposed in summer,\r\nthe intervening areas being well haired even at that season. The\r\nuniformity throughout the species as regards hairiness of the\r\nfoot-soles and also the character of the vibrissae makes it unnecessary\r\nto describe these features in the accounts of the subspecies of\r\n_erminea_.\r\n\r\n_Geographic variation._--In the Old World 16 or more subspecies are\r\ncurrently recognized and there are 20 in North America. The features in\r\nwhich geographic variation is especially prominent are: First, size,\r\nas expressed by external measurements and weight, second, color\r\npattern, depending on the extent, in relation to one another, of the\r\ndark-colored upper parts and light-colored underparts, and third,\r\nbreadth and depth of the rostral region of the skull. Except in size,\r\nthe variation in the skull is less than in _M. frenata_. Likewise in\r\ntone and shade of upper parts and hue or tint of underparts, _erminea_\r\nis less variable than _frenata_ and has the face all of one color\r\nwithout the contrasting color-pattern of the face and head seen in many\r\nsubspecies of _frenata_. _M. erminea_ exceeds _frenata_ as regards\r\nvariation of the size of the area occupied by the light-colored\r\nunderparts. At one extreme is the subspecies _arctica_ in which the\r\narea of the light color extends well up on the sides of the body, down\r\nthe insides of the legs, over the feet and far out on the lower side of\r\nthe tail whereas at the other extreme are the races _streatori_ and\r\n_olympica_ in which the light-colored underparts are restricted to two\r\nareas, one on the chin, throat and chest, and the other on the inguinal\r\nregion. These areas may or may not be connected by a thin line of white\r\ncolor along the midline of the underparts. In size of animal, _erminea_\r\nprobably exhibits the maximum variation among American species of\r\nweasels; an average-sized male of the race _arctica_ weighs 4 times as\r\nmuch as one of the race _muricus_, and in the species _frenata_ I doubt\r\nthat the difference is quite as great between individuals of the\r\nsmallest race, _effera_, on the one hand, and either of the largest\r\nraces, _texensis_ or _macrophonius_, on the other hand although actual\r\nweights are not available for these races of _frenata_. As elsewhere\r\nindicated, the small-sized individuals of _M. erminea_ are of the\r\nsouthern races and the large-sized individuals are of the northern\r\nraces. This decrease in size southward occurs both in Asia and in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n_Natural history._--habitat and numbers.--Along the International\r\nBoundary east of the Turtle Mountains, Soper (1946:136) found this\r\nspecies present only in timbered areas and absent from many untimbered\r\nareas. Of the same species to the westward he comments \"so far as I\r\nknow at present, there is no evidence to show that any short-tailed\r\nweasels inhabit a broad strip of treeless territory immediately north\r\nof the International Boundary in Canada from southwestern Alberta to\r\nsoutheastern Saskatchewan.\" The same author (1942) reports that in the\r\ngeneral area of Wood Buffalo Park, Northwest Territory, south of Great\r\nSlave Lake, the ermine is uncommon on pine-grown sand ridge and rolling\r\nupland and common in lower spruce-aspen parklands, stream-side\r\nconiferous belts, and grassy, semi-wooded swamplands.\r\n\r\nNine ermines per square mile is the number that Soper (1919:46-47)\r\nestimated at Edmonton on the basis of the numbers that he trapped there\r\nin the winters of 1912-13 and 1913-14 and on the basis of the tracks of\r\nremaining ermines. From corresponding data he estimated the population\r\nin the winter of 1913 on the Hay River, north of Jasper Park, to be\r\nnine per square mile. In each of these instances he estimated ten\r\nweasels per square mile but he inclined to the view that one-tenth of\r\nthe animals involved in his counts were long-tailed weasels (_Mustela\r\nfrenata_). Osgood (1909B:30) and his field companion in the period July\r\n31 to September 3, 1903, took a series of 42 specimens within a radius\r\nof 500 yards of their camp at the head of Seward Creek, Alaska, all\r\ncaught in four traps, in one month. Of the 42 specimens, 28 are males\r\nand 14 are females.\r\n\r\nFluctuations of a multiannual nature are marked in this species. Bailey\r\n(1929:156) observes that in Sherburne County, Minnesota, when meadow\r\nmice are abundant for two or three years these weasels become abundant\r\nbut that when the mice are scarce the weasels also become scarce.\r\nManning (1943:56), on Southampton Island, noted \"that the maximum and\r\nminimum points of the weasel cycle are much more sharply marked than\r\nthose of the fox cycle and the increase and decrease are more rapid.\"\r\n\r\nHow far an ermine will travel in a given length of time has seldom been\r\nrecorded but Hamilton (1933:293), on March 20, 1932, \"followed the\r\ntrack of a small weasel, presumably a male _cicognanii_, for four miles\r\nin the fresh snow,\" and Ingles (1942) observed a diminutive ermine of\r\nthe subspecies _M. e. muricus_, at Woods Lake, California, 286 yards\r\nfrom its den.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehavior\r\n\r\nAs regards locomotion, Soper (1919:46), in reference to _Mustela\r\ncicognanii_, presumably in Ontario, Canada, writes that in the bounding\r\ngait the hind feet register almost, if not exactly, in the front-foot\r\nimpressions, with the right front and hind feet lagging slightly\r\nbehind. \"The distance normally is about 19 inches, representing a\r\nregular rate of travel. . . . In traversing open spaces they resort to\r\nlong, graceful leaps upwards of six feet in length. . . . I measured a\r\nrecord . . . of 8 feet, 2 inches.\"\r\n\r\nOf _M. e. arctica_, Dice (1921:22) writes that when it runs \"the tail\r\nis carried off the ground usually at an angle of about 45 degrees.\"\r\nSeton (1929 (2):598) states that \"At Carberry [Manitoba] I have often\r\nseen this energetic little creature seeking for Mice in the deep, soft\r\nsnow. Its actions are much like those of an Otter pursuing salmon.\r\nSometimes it gallops along a log, or over an icy part of the drift;\r\nthen plunges out of sight in a soft place, to reappear many yards\r\naway. . . .\"\r\n\r\nLittle is recorded concerning swimming but on this score Seton (1929\r\n(2):602) does quote J. W. Curran, who in July, 1899, at Lake\r\nCouchiching, Ontario, watched an ermine pursue a chipmunk into the\r\nwater and for 100 yards before giving up the chase and wheeling around\r\nand making for shore. In swimming \"The Weasel, I think, showed more of\r\nhis body, and seemed to exert himself more\" than the chipmunk.\r\n\r\nAs to voice, Dice (1921:22), at Tanana, Alaska, heard the ermine, when\r\nexcited, bark somewhat like a mink but not so loud and Seton (1929\r\n(2):606) quotes Manley Hardy to the effect that the species has a\r\npurring note.\r\n\r\nSense of smell was used by an _M. e. muricus_ that Dixon (1931:72)\r\nwatched as the ermine followed a three-fourths-grown pika. Concerning\r\nthe ermine at Carberry, Manitoba, Seton (1929 (2):598-599) writes that\r\n\"The smell of blood must be as far-reaching as it is attractive to\r\nthese sanguinary little creatures. I have frequently hung new-killed\r\nRabbits and partridges temporarily in trees, and, after an absence, in\r\nsome cases of a few minutes only, have found an Ermine mauling the\r\ngame, though there was no sign of such a visitor when the cache was\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemies\r\n\r\nGeorge Measham, of Winnipeg, found sign in the snow indicating that a\r\ngreat snowy owl had killed an ermine and T. McIlwraith shot a bald\r\neagle at Hamilton Bay which had the bleached skull of a weasel\r\n(probably of this species) clinging to the throat (Seton, 1929\r\n(2):603).\r\n\r\nA. B. Howell (1943:98) likens mustelid mammals to domestic cats in\r\ntheir manner of crossing roads and thinks that mustelids loiter at the\r\nside of the road until the stimulus of the approaching car causes them\r\nto make a dash whereupon they are caught by the wheels and killed.\r\nThree of four weasels seen to cross the road were killed, one even\r\nhaving apparently crossed the road before turning back and being killed\r\nunder the car. One weasel killed was _Mustela erminea cicognanii_.\r\nDalquest (1948:190) in writing of this species in the state of\r\nWashington, says \"I have seen only one abroad in the daytime. It dashed\r\nfrom a roadside thicket . . . and was crushed beneath the wheels of a\r\ncar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFood\r\n\r\nThe killing of prey is described by Hamilton (1933:332) as follows: \"A\r\nrapid dash, and the bird or mouse is grabbed over the back of the\r\nskull, the fore legs encircle the animal as though hugging it, and the\r\nhind legs are brought up to scratch wildly at the captive. . . . If\r\n[the prey is] a large animal, as a rat, the weasel usually lies on its\r\nside, while the diminishing struggles of the rodent continue, but if a\r\nmouse or a small bird [is the object of attack], the weasel is apt to\r\ncrouch over its prey. Little time is lost over the first [mouse] . . .\r\nif two mice are present [;] a strong bite through the brain case . . .\r\n[is] sufficient. If only one animal is present, the weasel dawdles over\r\nits kill some time after life has departed.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton's (1933:333) study of the contents of the digestive tracts of\r\nbodies of ermines obtained from fur trappers and fur buyers in New York\r\nenabled him to publish the following \"Frequency Indices of Mammal\r\nGenera in Fall and Winter Food of 191 Mustela cicognanii\": _Microtus_,\r\n35.7 per cent; mammals undetermined to genus but principally mice,\r\n16.3; _Blarina_, 15.1; _Peromyscus_, 11.4; _Sylvilagus_, 9.0; _Sorex_,\r\n4.9; _Rattus_, 4.4; _Tamias_, 3.6. Close correspondence is shown by the\r\nfollowing data of Aldous and Manweiler (1942) for the ermine from Lake\r\nof the Woods, Minnesota: mice, 58.7 per cent by number and 54.5 by\r\nvolume; shrews 22.5 and 21.8 per cent; birds, 2.7 and 5.0 per cent. Of\r\nthe mice in stomachs, 40 per cent were microtines, 15 per cent were\r\n_Peromyscus_ and 45 per cent were unidentified as to kind. Fragments of\r\na small fish were found in one stomach. Summed up, the dominant winter\r\nfoods were mice and shrews. Trapping of the mammal populations was done\r\nto see what the available food was and it was found that the small\r\nmammals were eaten in direct ratio to their relative abundance.\r\nSnowshoe rabbits and red squirrels were not eaten. The Minnesotan data\r\nwere from 60 stomachs and 53 intestinal tracts recovered from 129\r\nweasels trapped by use of scent (not bait) mostly from January 1 to\r\nFebruary 7, 1939, although a few were trapped in 1938. Analyses of\r\ncontents from stomachs gave approximately the same results as those\r\nfrom intestines. In 1939 at Lake of the Woods, weasels were\r\nconcentrated where food was abundant but no such concentration was\r\nnoted in the following winter.\r\n\r\nBig short-tailed shrew (_Blarina brevicauda_).--In New York State, the\r\nermine preys on _Blarina_ as shown by Hamilton's (1933:330) seeing one\r\nbeing carried by a male ermine on May 6, 1931, and another being\r\ncarried by a female on May 13, 1932. The same author (1928:249) found\r\nthe remains of a _Blarina_ in a small female from Malone, New York.\r\nKirk (1921) observed, however, that the ermine (_M. e. cicognanii_)\r\navoided the shrew, _Blarina_, caught in a trap and that _Blarina_\r\navoided the weasel caught in a trap.\r\n\r\nChipmunk (genus _Tamias_).--Remains were found in a male ermine in New\r\nYork on May 14, 1932 (Hamilton, 1933:330), and Seton (1929 (2):602)\r\nrecords a chipmunk at Lake Couchiching, Ontario, that was pursued into\r\nthe water by an ermine.\r\n\r\nDeer mice (genus _Peromyscus_).--As shown by Hamilton (1933:33) and\r\nAldous and Manweiler (1942), _Peromyscus_ was second only to microtines\r\nin numerical abundance among the food items of ermines in New York and\r\nMinnesota. _Peromyscus_ and microtine rodents were brought to a den of\r\nthe diminutive _M. e. muricus_ in early August, in Fresno County,\r\nCalifornia, according to Ingles (1942). He observed that an Alpine\r\nchipmunk was active under and around the tree and that juncos reared\r\nyoung 40 feet from the den but that the chipmunk and juncos were\r\nunmolested by the ermines.\r\n\r\nLemming (genus _Lemmus_).--One was recovered from a female ermine (with\r\nmilk in her glands) at Laurier Pass, British Columbia (Sheldon,\r\n1932:201).\r\n\r\nRed-backed mouse (genus _Clethrionomys_).--Criddle and Criddle\r\n(1925:146) record that on \"May 31, 1921.--Saw a Bonaparte's weasel\r\ncapture a Red-backed Vole after a long hunt during which the pursuer\r\nnever once lost track of its victim.\"\r\n\r\nMeadow mice (genus _Microtus_).--As shown by the data of Hamilton\r\n(1933:333) and Aldous and Manweiler (1942) recorded above, _Microtus_\r\nis the item of first importance in the diet of the ermine in New York\r\nand Minnesota. Criddle and Criddle (1925:146) write concerning the\r\nvicinity of Treesbank, Manitoba, that \"October, 1918.--Following a\r\nsevere outbreak of mice in 1916-17, Bonaparte's weasel increased\r\nenormously and very soon reduced the rodents to comparative rarity.\r\nThis resulted in a scarcity of food for the weasels, which in their\r\nturn became greatly reduced in numbers.\"\r\n\r\nOld World rat (_Rattus_).--Bishop (1923) found two headless rats near a\r\nnest of this species in Albany, New York.\r\n\r\nPika (_Ochotona_).--Dixon (1931:72) at Milner Pass, Colorado, on July\r\n20, 1931, saw an ermine, of the subspecies _muricus_, following a\r\nthree-fourths grown pika by scent and outrunning the pika. The pikas\r\nworked a relay system and the weasel abandoned the trail when the\r\nfourth pika became the object of the chase.\r\n\r\nCottontail (genus _Sylvilagus_).--Hamilton (1933:33), as noted above,\r\nfound remains of cottontail in the digestive tracts of ermine that had\r\nbeen trapped for fur in winter. Possibly these remains were bait that\r\nhad been placed at traps.\r\n\r\nSnowshoe rabbit (_Lepus americanus_).--Morse (1939:210) in a study of\r\npredation on hares and grouse in the period of notable decimation of\r\nthese two game species in 1935-1936 in the Cloquet Valley State Forest,\r\nin St. Louis County, Minnesota, found that \"weasel predation on hares\r\nappeared to be of very low incidence or altogether lacking.\"\r\n\r\nWild birds (Class Aves).--Aldous and Manweiler (1942), as noted above,\r\nfound that the remains of birds constituted five per cent by volume of\r\nthe food of the ermine in winter in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nChicken (genus _Gallus_).--Criddle and Criddle (1925:145), who\r\npublished relatively extensive data on the three species of weasels of\r\nManitoba, write that: \"We have no record of Bonaparte's weasel killing\r\npoultry, and we doubt whether it ever does so.\" However, Soper\r\n(1919:46) investigated the excited cackling of a hen brooding chicks at\r\nnight and found a solitary ermine that had killed three chicks and that\r\nhad the remainder under very active scrutiny.\r\n\r\nLeopard frog (_Rana pipiens_).--One frog was found in a male ermine on\r\nNovember 20, 1931, in New York by Hamilton (1933:300).\r\n\r\nFish (Class Pisces).--Aldous and Manweiler (1942) found fragments of a\r\nsmall fish in one of 60 stomachs of ermine from Minnesota.\r\n\r\nEarthworm (Phylum Annelida).--Osgood (1936:64), presumably at Rutland,\r\nVermont, observed a pair of weasels from 2:15 P.M. to 5:00 P.M., in a\r\nbarn and saw the female in that time make many trips for food for her\r\nyoung. Only earthworms were brought. Fifty traps in an adjacent, swampy\r\nfield caught only one bull frog and no mice indicating that mice had\r\nbeen eliminated from the foraging territory of the ermine.\r\n\r\nIn handling food, Dice (1921:22) noted that the Alaskan ermine did not\r\nuse the feet but only the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduction\r\n\r\nLitters of 4, 4, 7, 7, and 8, yielding an average of 6 young per litter\r\nhave been recorded from the northeastern United States by Hamilton\r\n(1933:327). He (_op. cit._:321-325) described animals one day old from\r\nNew York State as being flesh-colored, having the long neck of the\r\nadult and a fine growth of white hair two millimeters in length, on\r\nthe dorsal surface of the neck, that foreshadows the mane or pompadour\r\nthat is prominent from the 14th to the 21st day of life. Six animals,\r\nwhen one day old averaged 1.7 grams in weight, which was three per cent\r\nof the weight of an adult female and one and one half per cent of the\r\nweight of an adult male. At two weeks of age the heavy brown mane stood\r\nout in marked contrast to the rest of the scantily, white-furred\r\nanimal. The eyes opened on the thirty-fifth day of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. _Mustela erminea richardsonii_, adult female,\r\nCatalogue Number 14866, U. S. Nat.

Map showing geographic ranges of the subspecies\r\nof _Mustela erminea_ in the New World.]\r\n\r\nFor rearing their young, ermines live in burrows. Bishop (1923), in\r\nAlbany, New York, found a burrow occupied by four young and a pair of\r\nadults. The burrow had many galleries and contained a nest constructed\r\nof rat fur, fine grass and fragments of leaves. At Woods Lake, Fresno\r\nCounty, California, in early August, Ingles observed (1942) some young\r\nand at least one adult at their den which was in a burrow beneath a\r\nhollow tree. The ermines used the hollow root and the hollow tree as\r\nwell as the burrow beneath. Seton (1929 (2):591) quotes S. Eldon\r\nPercival, of Barretts Rapids, Ontario, as finding the living quarters\r\nof an ermine in unthreshed grain stacked in a barn and says (_op.\r\ncit._:590) that John Burroughs dug out a nest, composed of leaves and\r\nthe fur of mice and moles, two or three handfuls in bulk, from a cavity\r\nthe size of a hat, arched over with a fine network of tree roots.\r\n\r\nFour instances in which the male as well as the female was present at a\r\nden containing young are cited by Hamilton (1933:328) and he gives some\r\nevidence, although not at all conclusive, that \"adults customarily\r\npair, or at least run together, at times other than the breeding\r\nseason.\" No other writers remark on this matter. I doubt that adult\r\nermines are associated in pairs for most of the year but such may be\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela erminea arctica= (Merriam)\r\n\r\nErmine\r\n\r\nPlates 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 and 41\r\n\r\n    _Putorius arcticus_ Merriam, N.

Summer\r\n     pelage with upper parts uniform in color and Raw Umber or darker\r\n     (16_n_) of Ridgway and about tones 2 to 3 of Chocolate of Oberthür\r\n     and Dauthenay, pl. 343, but in autumn some specimens have more\r\n     light red than tones 2 or 3. Underparts Sulphur Yellow, Colonial\r\n     Buff, or Primrose Yellow, often white on chin and insides of\r\n     forelegs; color of underparts extends narrowly over upper lips,\r\n     distally on posterior sides of forelegs onto antipalmar surface of\r\n     forefeet, onto proximal two-thirds or three-fourths of underside\r\n     of tail as length of tail is measured along tail-vertebrae, on\r\n     medial sides of hind legs to a point between knee and ankle but\r\n     reappears on antiplantar faces of toes and in some individuals is\r\n     narrowly continuous onto toes; rim of ear in some specimens with\r\n     short, white or pale hairs giving ears distinct whitish border;\r\n     least width of color of underparts averaging, in adult males from\r\n     Alaska, 65 (46-93) per cent of greatest width of color of upper\r\n     parts. Black tip of tail in 5 males in winter pelage from Tanana\r\n     averaging 84 (70-93) mm. which is 91 (75-107) per cent of length\r\n     of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 5 adult topotypes): See measurements and\r\n     plates 2-4. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except\r\n     that: Weight, 3.5 (3.1-3.9) grams; basilar length 42.5\r\n     (41.8-43.3); length of tooth-rows more than length of tympanic\r\n     bulla; breadth of rostrum measured across lacrimal processes\r\n     averaging more than a third of basilar length; interorbital\r\n     breadth more than distance between glenoid fossa and posterior\r\n     border of external auditory meatus; zygomatic breadth more than\r\n     distance between last upper molar and jugular foramen.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 2 adult topotypes and 2 adults and 4 subadults\r\n     from central Alaska): See measurements and plates 9-11. As\r\n     described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight,\r\n     1.5 (1.2-2.0) grams; basilar length, 35.7 (34.5-37.0); length of\r\n     tooth-rows more than length of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum\r\n     more than 30 per cent of basilar length; interorbital breadth more\r\n     than distance between glenoid fossa and posterior border of\r\n     external auditory meatus; zygomatic breadth more than distance\r\n     between last upper molar and jugular foramen (except in specimens\r\n     from Ellesmere Island where two distances are approximately\r\n     equal).\r\n\r\nCranial differences from _Mustela erminea kaneii_ (which occurs on the\r\nAsiatic side of Bering Strait), in both males and females, are: larger\r\nsize relatively as well as actually, broader except in mastoidal region\r\nwhere relatively (to basilar length) the width is less; preorbital part\r\nof skull broader as well as longer.\r\n\r\nFrom _kadiacensis_ differences in the skull of the male are: size less;\r\n13 per cent heavier, relatively (to basilar length) narrower across\r\ninterorbital region and zygomatic arches; tympanic bullae relatively as\r\nwell as actually narrower. Judging by the single available adult female\r\nof _kadiacensis_, the skull of female _arctica_ is larger in all parts\r\nmeasured, a fourth heavier, has tympanic bullae of almost twice the\r\nvolume and the interorbital and preorbital regions, relative to the\r\nbraincase, are much reduced in whatever plane measured.\r\n\r\nDifferences from _richardsonii_, additional to those noted above in the\r\nformal description of the skull, between the males, are: larger in all\r\nparts measured except length of tympanic bulla which is about the same;\r\n42 per cent heavier; relative to basilar length, skull broader with\r\npreorbital part longer as well as broader; tympanic bullae more\r\ninflated posteriorly. The same differences prevail between females\r\nexcept that the skull is 36 per cent heavier and in _arctica_ the\r\nlength of the bulla is actually more (although relative to the basilar\r\nlength less) and its greater inflation posteriorly is hardly\r\nperceptible. Differences from _alascensis_, additional to those\r\nindicated in the formal descriptions of the skulls of the two, in\r\nmales, are: larger in every part measured; 95 per cent heavier;\r\nrelative to the basilar length, skull broader with preorbital part\r\nlonger as well as broader; measured at a point opposite the foramen\r\nlacerum anterius, the width of the pterygoid space is more, rather than\r\nless, than 40 per cent of its length. Excepting this difference in\r\nwidth of interpterygoid space, the same differences prevail between\r\nfemales, those of _arctica_ being 56 per cent heavier.\r\n\r\nComparison with _semplei_ is made in the account of that subspecies.\r\n\r\nSkull indistinguishable from that of _polaris_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The person who studies specimens of this subspecies finds\r\nlabels inscribed with the names of naturalists well known to all\r\nreaders of literature on the Arctic. Sir John Franklin, R. McFarlane,\r\nR. Kennicott, E. W. Nelson and R. M. Anderson are names which appear\r\ncommonly. Of Alaskan specimens prepared according to modern methods, a\r\nlarge share was obtained by O. J. Murie and L. R. Dice.\r\n\r\nThe ermine was observed in the far north by early explorers and was\r\nmentioned in the literature, almost always under the name then used for\r\nthe ermine of northern Europe and Asia. In 1896 Bangs misapplied to it\r\nthe name _richardsonii_ but Merriam in the same year corrected the\r\napplication of this name and proposed as new for this weasel the name\r\n_arctica_, the name in use today. For almost 50 years after Merriam and\r\nBangs wrote about it, _arctica_ was treated, nominally at least, as a\r\nspecies distinct from its other relatives in both the Old-and\r\nNew-World. The subspecific status of _arctica_ was emphasized in 1944\r\n(555) by the present writer in reporting in detail upon the specimens,\r\nof _Mustela erminea_, from Eastern Asia which were made available on\r\nloan by Professor B. S. Vinogradov and the late Anatol I. Argyropulo of\r\nthe Leningrad Academy of Sciences. Specimens of _Mustela erminea\r\nkaneii_ from the Asiatic side of Bering Strait and _Mustela erminea\r\narctica_ from the American side are distinguishable by slight cranial\r\ncharacters but in coloration and external measurements I can detect no\r\ndifferences. Merriam's (1896:16) mention of more golden-colored upper\r\nparts and darker underparts in American specimens than in _erminea_ was\r\nthe result of his comparison of Alaskan and northern European\r\nspecimens. When Old World specimens from eastern Siberia, instead of\r\nfrom Europe, are used the differences mentioned by Merriam do not\r\napply. Incidentally, many Siberian specimens have the white border, on\r\nthe ear, which Merriam (_loc. cit._) noted as a distinguishing feature\r\nof _arctica_. When Merriam named _arctica_ he said (1896:15, 16)\r\n\"_Putorius arcticus_ . . . has heretofore been confounded with\r\n_erminea_ or _richardsonii_. . . . It is interesting to find in this\r\ncountry an Arctic circumpolar weasel which, though specifically\r\ndistinct, is strictly the American representative of the Old World\r\n_erminea_.\" Bearing in mind that Merriam's concept of species and\r\nsubspecies (see Merriam, 1919:6) differed from that of nearly all\r\nmodern systematists it is clear from his statement quoted above that\r\nhe correctly understood the zoölogical relationship obtaining between\r\nthe ermines of the Old and New Worlds.\r\n\r\nOgnev (1935:31) seems to have been the first to use the name\r\ncombination _Mustela erminea arctica_ for Alaskan specimens. Thereby he\r\nexpresses the view adopted here, namely that the American ermine is\r\nsubspecifically but not specifically distinct from the Old World\r\nanimal. Whether actual intergradation (crossbreeding) ever takes place\r\nacross the narrow Bering Strait I do not know. I doubt that\r\ncrossbreeding occurs but considering the Diomedes (islands), that might\r\nserve as a half way stopping point, and remembering Mr. Charles\r\nBrower's oral statement to me that he had seen tracks of ermine as far\r\nas 10 miles from the northern shore of Alaska out on the ice, the\r\npossibility must be granted of an occasional individual crossing from\r\none side to the other of Bering Strait on the ice in winter or of being\r\ncarried across when the ice broke up and drifted. If transfers of this\r\nkind occurred often one would expect ermines to occur also on Saint\r\nLawrence Island where apparently they do not. The one skin (U. S. Nat.\r\nMus. no. 259046) seen as labeled from there, my friend, Otto William\r\nGeist ascertained was imported as a skin with other furs from Siberia.\r\n\r\nOgnev (_op. cit._) who used the name combination _Mustela erminea\r\narctica_ for Alaskan specimens, applied it also to animals from\r\nKamchatka. At the same time he recognized the animal from the eastern\r\nmainland of Siberia (as opposed to the peninsula of Kamchatka) under\r\nthe name _Mustela erminea orientalis_ Ognev 1928. Hall (1944:556)\r\napplied the earlier proposed name _Putorius kaneii_ Baird 1857, to the\r\nanimal on the eastern mainland of Asia and proposed the new name\r\n_Mustela erminea digna_ for the ermine of Kamchatka. In comparing\r\nmaterial of these two Asiatic races with topotypes and other specimens\r\nof _M. e. arctica_ from Alaska, it seemed to me that the degree of\r\nrelationship, one with the other, was about the same. _M. e. digna_ has\r\na slightly larger preorbital region than _M. e. kaneii_, and the skull\r\nis longer. In both of these particulars _digna_ approaches closer to\r\n_arctica_. _M. e. kaneii_ has longer tympanic bullae and a wider skull\r\nthan _digna_ and therein approaches more towards _arctica_ than toward\r\n_digna_. As nearly as I can make out, _digna_ and _kaneii_ show a\r\nnearly equal degree of resemblance to _arctica_. Also the degree of\r\ndifference between _digna_ and _kaneii_ is about the same as between\r\neither one of them and _arctica_. In view of the above considerations\r\nthe ermines of the New and Old worlds are here regarded as only\r\nsubspecifically distinct.\r\n\r\nIn the original description of _Putorius audax_ (here regarded as\r\ninseparable from _Putorius arcticus_ Merriam) Barrett-Hamilton\r\nerroneously designated the type locality as \"Discovery Bay, North\r\nGreenland\" whereas he should have written Grinnell Land [= Ellesmere\r\nIsland of modern terminology] in place of Greenland. As reference to\r\nNares (1877 and 1878) will readily reveal, Discovery Bay is near 65° W\r\nand 81° 40´ N, across Robeson Channel, to the west, from Greenland. The\r\nlabel on the type specimen and the specimen register in the British\r\nMuseum of Natural History each designates the locality for this\r\nspecimen, the type of _audax_, as Discovery Bay without mention of\r\nGreenland. The published accounts of Feilden (1878) and Nares (1877 and\r\n1878) state that specimens of ermine were obtained at Discovery Bay.\r\nProbably H. C. Hart is the collector of the specimen; he was the\r\nnaturalist attached to H. M. S. Discovery which wintered at Discovery\r\nBay while H. W. Feilden was the naturalist attached to H. M. S. Alert\r\nwhich wintered a few miles southeast of Cape Sheridan, also on the\r\neastern coast of Ellesmere Island.\r\n\r\nIt is true that from these ships a trip was made into Greenland and an\r\nermine (only one individual it seems) was obtained there, but this\r\nindividual was the type specimen of _Mustela erminea polaris_, in the\r\naccount of which race something of the history of this specimen is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nWith the material available--and it is not entirely adequate--I can\r\ndetect no features by which animals from the type locality of _audax_\r\ncan be distinguished from typical _arctica_ which latter name has\r\npriority.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _richardsonii_ probably occurs completely across\r\nthe continent. Intergrades here referred to _arctica_ include those\r\nfrom Fort Goodhope. The one defective specimen from Lake Lebarge,\r\nYukon, is not certainly identified as _arctica_ and how far west of\r\nTeslin Lake the boundary-line between _arctica_ and _richardsonii_\r\nshould be drawn remains to be ascertained. The one specimen available\r\nfrom Hinchenbrook Island, no. 912 Mus. Vert. Zoöl., an adult female, is\r\ndoubtfully referred to _arctica_ because the damaged tympanic bullae\r\nappear to be no larger than in _alascensis_, and the size of the skull\r\nis more as in _alascensis_ although intermediate between that race and\r\n_arctica_. Shape of the skull is more as in _arctica_. Possibly more\r\nnearly adequate material would show the existence on Hinchenbrook\r\nIsland of an insular race differing in about the same degree from\r\n_arctica_ of the mainland as does the insular _kadiacensis_.\r\nNevertheless, the males from farther south at Cape Yakataga are in all\r\nrespects _arctica_ and this argues against near relationship to\r\n_alascensis_ of the animal on Hinchenbrook Island. The three animals\r\nseen from Yakutat Bay are so young as not to display clearly the\r\ncranial characters of the subspecies but the extension of the color of\r\nthe underparts onto the underside of the tail in them and also in the\r\nskin without corresponding skull from Glacier Bay, Alaska, is as in\r\n_arctica_, the race to which they are referred, and gives substantial\r\nbasis for showing the geographic range of _arctica_ as extending this\r\nfar south along the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 281, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by Districts and from north to south in each District.

Underparts Buff-Yellow. Least width of\r\n     color of underparts averaging, in 3 males, 66 (57-72) per cent of\r\n     greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail in same\r\n     males averaging 71 (70-72) mm. which is 99 (99-104) per cent of\r\n     length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     The lighter-colored upper parts and more intensely yellow\r\n     underparts are the distinguishing features of the subspecies\r\n     _polaris_ in comparison with other races of American _M. erminea_.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 5 adults from eastern Greenland): See\r\n     measurements. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_\r\n     except that: Weight more (not recorded); basilar length, 41.3\r\n     (39.0-42.4); length of tooth-rows more than length of tympanic\r\n     bulla; breadth of rostrum measured across lacrimal processes\r\n     averaging more than a third of basilar length; interorbital\r\n     breadth more than distance between glenoid fossa and posterior\r\n     border of external auditory meatus; zygomatic breadth more than\r\n     distance between last upper molar and jugular foramen.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 2 adults, Turner Sund and Kap Hoeg): See\r\n     measurements. As described in _Mustela erminea arctica_ except\r\n     that basilar length 36.8 (35.9, 37.8), and length of tooth-rows\r\n     not more than length of tympanic bulla. Skulls of females not in\r\n     hand when this comparison is written; only the recorded\r\n     measurements are available.\r\n\r\nTo me the skull of _polaris_ is indistinguishable from that of\r\n_arctica_. Therefore the comparisons made of the skull of _arctica_\r\nwith those of other subspecies will apply also for _polaris_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--In view of the heretofore erroneous assignment of the type\r\nlocality of _Mustela erminea audax_ to Greenland, pains were taken to\r\nverify the statement by Barrett-Hamilton (1904:393) relative to the\r\ntype specimen of _polaris_. Taking pains thus seemed the more\r\nworthwhile because in the specimen register at the British Museum of\r\nNatural History, there is written to the right of catalogue numbers\r\n78-6 = 19 nos. 1-11, \"Discovery Bay Presented by Mr. Hart Arctic\r\nCollection.\" This refers to no. 78.6.19.1. There are no ditto marks\r\nbelow but by implication this data applies also to nos. 1-11, which\r\ninclude the holotype of _polaris_. A label attached to the specimen\r\ndoes however give the locality as \"Hall Land\" \"N Greenland\" and another\r\nlabel has on it \"Ermine, procured by Mr. Beaumont Greenland Lat 89°\r\nLong W 59-20.\" The 89° is obviously a mistake (on the label or in my\r\ntranscription of it) for 82°.\r\n\r\nReference to Nares (1877:385) reveals that Lieutenant Lewis A.\r\nBeaumont, under date of June 15 and 16, 1876, wrote in his field\r\njournal as follows: \"I shot an ermine.\" In the daily accounts of his\r\njourney from Discovery Bay on Grinnell Land [= Ellesmere Island],\r\nacross Robeson Channel and along the north coast of Greenland to the\r\nwest base of Mount Farragut near 50° 30´ W he mentions the ermine only\r\nthis once. For several other kinds of animals, Beaumont mentions\r\nindividuals seen or shot, often with the notation that this is the\r\nsecond, or third seen. This mention of a kind of animal whenever seen\r\nwas in accordance with orders. On page 39 of the Discovery Report (_op.\r\ncit._, 1877) in \"General orders to sledging parties\" by Captain G. S.\r\nNares, Commanding the Expedition, we find \". . . note daily: IV State\r\nthe animals seen and those shot.\" Reference to the map facing page 358\r\nof the (_op. cit._) report reveals that on the 15th and 16th, camps\r\nwere made by Beaumont in Gap Valley, each 7-3/4 miles northeast of Cape\r\nBrevoort, one camp on either side of the 82° line, and separated from\r\neach other by a distance of only 2-1/4 air line miles or 4-1/2 miles\r\nmarch according to his journal.\r\n\r\nThese several data, then, are the bases for designating the type\r\nlocality of _M. e. polaris_, in the way that I have stated it at the\r\nbeginning of this account of the subspecies.\r\n\r\nThe light-colored upper parts and more intensely yellow underparts well\r\ndifferentiate this subspecies from _arctica_ or _semplei_.\r\nIntergradation is suggested by a skin, no. 1462, Copenhagen Zoological\r\nMuseum, from Axel Heibergs Land, the color of the underparts of which\r\nagrees with that of specimens from Greenland. Also the color of the\r\nupper parts is decidedly nearer that of animals from Greenland than to\r\nthat of specimens from Ponds Inlet, Tulican and Gifford River. No other\r\nspecimens west or south of Greenland suggest intergradation. In\r\nGreenland itself, one adult, a female from Turner Sund, East Greenland,\r\nhas the underparts no more yellowish than in some specimens from\r\nMelville Peninsula. This female is darker on the back than any one of\r\nthe other 10 specimens from Greenland in summer pelage examined at the\r\nsame time, but even so is not so dark colored as animals from Baffin\r\nIsland or other islands to the west of Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe final summation of information about this subspecies would have\r\nbeen more precise if I had been able to have actually in hand, at the\r\ntime of writing, specimens preserved in the Copenhagen Zoological\r\nMuseum. The war made it impractical to secure the loan of these as\r\npreviously planned. Even so, the measurements and notes on color that I\r\nobtained from this material, in 1937, in Copenhagen, suffice to prove\r\nthat the subspecies _polaris_ is well set off in color from the other\r\nAmerican subspecies of _Mustela erminea_.\r\n\r\nThe best material of this subspecies is in the University Zoological\r\nMuseum at Copenhagen, Denmark.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 35, arranged by locality from\r\n     the western end of the north coast of Greenland, eastward and then\r\n     southward down the east coast.

Black tip of tail in 19\r\n     male topotypes averaging 72 (64-83) mm. which is 91 (75-122) per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 2 adults and 10 subadults from\r\n     Southampton Island): See measurements and plates 2-4. As described\r\n     in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight, 2.0 (in one\r\n     subadult) grams; basilar length, 37.5 (35.7-39.9); length of\r\n     tooth-rows more than length of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum\r\n     more than a third of basilar length; interorbital breadth more\r\n     than distance between glenoid fossa and posterior border of\r\n     external auditory meatus; zygomatic breadth more than distance\r\n     between last upper molar and jugular foramen.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 1 adult and 4 subadults from Southampton Island):\r\n     See measurements and plates 9-11. As described in _Mustela erminea\r\n     richardsonii_ except that: Weight, 1.35 (in one adult) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 34.2; breadth of rostrum more than 30 per cent of\r\n     basilar length; interorbital breadth more than distance between\r\n     glenoid fossa and posterior border of external auditory meatus;\r\n     zygomatic breadth more or less than (approximately same as)\r\n     distance between last upper molar and jugular foramen.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _richardsonii_, the skulls of males averaged smaller\r\nin every measurement taken except breadth of rostrum and interorbital\r\nbreadth which are more, and zygomatic breadth and length of inner lobe\r\nof M1 which are approximately the same; skull about 20 per cent\r\nlighter; in relation to basilar length, preorbital region longer and\r\nbroader in every part measured. Female averages larger, in every part\r\nmeasured; 23 per cent heavier; in relation to basilar length, every\r\nother measurement more. It is noteworthy that the skull of the male is\r\nsmaller and the skull of the female larger than in _richardsonii_.\r\n\r\nDifferences from _arctica_ are: Size less, in each sex; males about 40\r\nper cent and females 10 per cent lighter; in males, skull more rounded\r\nin outline as viewed from above because zygomatic arches arise less\r\nabruptly from skull; in males tympanic bullae do not project so far\r\nventrally from squamosal floor of braincase; with these exceptions,\r\nskull of _semplei_ can be said to be a smaller edition of that of\r\n_arctica_.\r\n\r\nFrom _polaris_, _semplei_ differs, cranially, in the same way as from\r\n_arctica_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--There is a slight increase in size of ermines toward the\r\nnorth which probably is the result of intergradation between _semplei_\r\nand _arctica_. Specimens from the northern part of Baffin Island are\r\nlarger than those from farther south. Specimens from the mainland west\r\nof Southampton Island may owe their smaller (than in _arctica_) size to\r\nintergradation with _richardsonii_ almost as much as to intergradation\r\nwith _semplei_.\r\n\r\nDegerbøl's name _Mustela arctica labiata_ was applied to specimens,\r\nwhich to me are indistinguishable from topotypes of _Mustela arctica\r\nsemplei_, which latter name has three years priority. Degerbøl\r\n(1935:34) states that Malugsitaq, Melville Peninsula, is the type\r\nlocality. He did not designate a type specimen. Reference to his\r\naccount (_op. cit._:26) shows that he lists five specimens from the\r\ntype locality, or more precisely as \"Malugsitaq, Lyon Inlet. 5 summer\r\nskins. [M] [M] June-July 1922. P. F., CN. 2262-2266.\" On labels\r\nattached to these specimens, \"Lyon Inlet\" is replaced with \"Melville\r\nPeninsula.\" On July 28, 1937, Degerbøl and I together examined these\r\nspecimens in his laboratory. Because no. 2262 is first mentioned I\r\nregard it as the type. It is a juvenal male, skull and skin, no. 2262\r\n(20.5 1931.8), Univ. Zool. Mus. Copenhagen, obtained in June or July of\r\n1922 by Peter Freuchen whose original number was / s 2324. The specimen\r\nis one of 5 males taken at the same locality by the same collector and\r\nthey bear identical data as to date. They look to be of the same\r\nlitter for all are roughly of the same size and each retains milk\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nAdditional females, with external measurements carefully taken, are\r\nmuch needed from Southampton Island, because the available females are\r\ninsufficient to show the degree of sexual dimorphism. If the meager\r\ndata available be accepted, the difference in size between the two\r\nsexes is less than in other subspecies. My own feeling is that a better\r\nsample of females would show the secondary sexual difference in size to\r\nbe more than available data indicate.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 183, arranged from north to\r\n     south by islands, or regions attached to the mainland, and from\r\n     north to south in each region or island.

Black tip of tail in 3 males in\r\n     summer pelage averaging 80 (70-90) mm. which is 85 (69-96) per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 2 adults): See measurements and plates\r\n     2-4.

As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except\r\n     that: Weight, 1.2 grams; basilar length, 33.0; length of\r\n     tooth-rows more than length of tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\nComparison with _arctica_ has been made in the account of that\r\nsubspecies. Although _richardsonii_ and _kadiacensis_ are described as\r\nhaving the zygomatic breadth less than the distance between the last\r\nupper molar and jugular foramen, the zygomatic breadth is considerably\r\nmore in _kadiacensis_ than in _richardsonii_; consequently the two\r\ndimensions are more nearly equal than in _richardsonii_. Except for\r\nbeing slightly narrower, the skull of _kadiacensis_ is only a slightly\r\nsmaller edition of that of _arctica_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--When naming the weasel from the mainland of Alaska as new,\r\nunder the name _Putorius arcticus_, Merriam (1896:16) wrote: \"A small\r\nform of _arcticus_ occurs on Kadiak Island. . . . It is probably worthy\r\nof recognition as subspecies _kadiacensis_.\" The informality of this\r\ndescription possibly was in part due to the describer's recognition of\r\nthe fact that the degree of difference between _arcticus_ and the\r\ninsular _kadiacensis_ was slight. Specimens collected after Merriam\r\nproposed the name for the weasel of Kodiak Island show the animal there\r\nto be less different from _arctica_ of the adjacent mainland than he\r\nthought; small size is the most pronounced distinction of\r\n_kadiacensis_ and Merriam's male type specimen is smaller than any of\r\nthe five additional males saved from Kodiak Island since that time.\r\nEven so the differences fully warrant subspecific recognition, in my\r\nopinion, although _kadiacensis_ is not a strongly differentiated race.\r\nMore adult females are needed to ascertain the norm of form and size\r\nfor that sex. If the one female known is typical, the difference from\r\n_arctica_ is more pronounced in females than in males. The lesser size\r\nof _kadiacensis_ can hardly be credited entirely to the effect of\r\ninsularity, for animals from the southern part of the mainland, on\r\nKenai Peninsula for example, are smaller than those from central and\r\nnorthern Alaska and provide evidence of intergradation of a sort\r\nbetween _kadiacensis_ and _arctica_.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 9, all from Kodiak Island,\r\n     Alaska, and unless otherwise indicated in the U.

W Fort Nelson, and Govt. Hay Camp, Wood Buffalo\r\n     Park) yield average and respective measurements as follows: Total\r\n     length, 331 average (340, 325, 330, 328); length of tail, 93 (102,\r\n     91, 93, 87); length of hind foot, 45 (48, 43, 45, 44). Weight of 4\r\n     adults from the Belcher Islands is 175 (135-180) grams. Of 10\r\n     subadults from Belcher Islands it is 119 (92-137) grams.\r\n\r\n     Female: Three adults from Great Slave Lake (Willow River,\r\n     Fairchild Point, and Fort Resolution) yield average and respective\r\n     measurements as follows: Total length, 252 (237, 238, 282); length\r\n     of tail, 69 (63, 60, 85); length of hind foot, 32 (31, 32, 34).\r\n     Corresponding, average measurements for three adults from Glacier\r\n     Lake are 240, 60, 32 and for 3 adults from the Athabasca Delta,\r\n     243, 65, 30. Weight of 8 subadults from the Belcher Islands is 69\r\n     (64-78) grams. Weight of adults would be more.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Winter pelage all white except tip of tail. Summer\r\n     pelage with upper parts uniform in color and darker (16_n_) than\r\n     Raw Umber, and about tones 3 to 4 of Chocolate of Oberthür and\r\n     Dauthenay, pl. 343. Underparts Sulphur Yellow, Colonial Buff, or\r\n     Primrose Yellow, often nearly white on chin and insides of\r\n     forelegs; color of underparts extends narrowly over upper lips,\r\n     distally on posterior sides of forelegs onto antipalmar faces of\r\n     toes and sometimes over most of antipalmar surfaces of forefeet,\r\n     on medial sides of hind legs to a point between knee and ankle but\r\n     reappears on antiplantar faces of toes and in some individuals is\r\n     narrowly continuous onto toes. Least width of color of underparts\r\n     averaging, in a series of 12 males from the Athabasca Lake Region,\r\n     40 (25-54) per cent of greatest width of color of upper parts.\r\n     Black tip of tail averaging 56 (45-63) mm. in 5 adult males from\r\n     same region and thus 60 (48-70) per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     From _arctica_, _polaris_, _semplei_ and _kadiacensis_,\r\n     _richardsonii_ differs in: Color darker; ventral side of tail same\r\n     color as upper parts; light-colored underparts a fifth narrower;\r\n     black tip of tail by actual measurement a fifth shorter and\r\n     averaging less than two-thirds rather than more than four-fifths\r\n     of length of tail-vertebrae. From _cicognanii_, _richardsonii_\r\n     differs in that the underparts are a fourth wider and in some\r\n     specimens more brightly colored. The width of the underparts is\r\n     likewise a fourth more than in _bangsi_. In _invicta_ the\r\n     underparts are not so brightly colored as in some specimens of\r\n     _richardsonii_. From _fallenda_, _richardsonii_ differs in that\r\n     the upper parts often are lighter colored, upper lips white rather\r\n     than colored like upper parts, and underparts as wide again. In\r\n     comparison with _alascensis_, the black tip of the tail averages\r\n     three-fifths rather than a half of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 6 adults from 3 miles south of Big\r\n     Island, Great Slave Lake): See measurements and plates 2-4;\r\n     weight, 2.5 (2.1-2.9) grams; basilar length, 40.9 (39.6-43.7);\r\n     length of tooth-rows less than length of tympanic bulla; breadth\r\n     of rostrum measured across lacrimal processes less than a third of\r\n     basilar length; interorbital breadth less than distance between\r\n     glenoid fossa and posterior border of external auditory meatus;\r\n     zygomatic breadth less than distance between last upper molar and\r\n     jugular foramen.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 4 adults: from Willow River, 1; Fort Resolution,\r\n     1; Athabasca Delta, 2; and 2 subadults, one from 3 mi.

This comparative description has the virtue of\r\nmore clearly indicating differences between subspecies and also makes\r\nfor brevity.\r\n\r\nJohn Richardson, Bernard R. Ross, and names of their companions, as\r\nwritten on the labels of the older specimens recall to the student's\r\nmind early explorations of the north country. Edward A. Preble obtained\r\nimportant specimens at several places and in recent years J. Kenneth\r\nDoutt and G. G. Goodwin have made the reviser's work easier by\r\npreparing specimens in series from areas not previously well\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclatural history of this subspecies begins with references in\r\nthe literature that identify the animal as the Old World species,\r\n_Mustela erminea_--an identification which the study here reported upon\r\nshows to have been correct in the specific, although not in the\r\nsubspecific, sense. Richardson, for example, in his \"Fauna\r\nBoreali-Americana\" published in 1829 so identified the animal. In 1838,\r\nBonaparte, basing his description on Richardson's account of 1829,\r\nproposed the new name _richardsonii_. Richardson himself, the following\r\nyear in the \"Zoology of Beechey's Voyage,\" accepted Bonaparte's name\r\nand it has been applied to the animal in the central part of the\r\nnorthern timber-belt of North America ever since, except as authors\r\nused the name _Mustela erminea_ in the belief that _richardsonii_ was\r\nnot distinct from _erminea_.\r\n\r\nThe north and south boundaries of the range assigned to _richardsonii_\r\nvaried according to the notions of the particular writer who was\r\nemploying the name. Until Merriam in 1896 named _arctica_ as distinct,\r\nanimals from the far north were generally included under the name\r\n_richardsonii_ along with populations to which the latter name now is\r\napplied. Because _richardsonii_ grades gradually into the smaller\r\n_cicognanii_ of more southern occurrence the boundary between the two\r\nhas been set farther north by one writer and farther south by another,\r\ndepending probably upon what the writer felt was the halfway point in\r\nsize. This point of course depended upon the samples selected as\r\ntypical of _richardsonii_ on the north and _cicognanii_ on the south.\r\nBecause Bangs, in 1896, took as representative of _richardsonii_ the\r\nfar northern and hence large-sized animals (now separated as _M. e.\r\narctica_), his halfway point in size between them and the small\r\n_cicognanii_ of New England naturally fell farther north than it would\r\nhave had he used as representative of _richardsonii_ specimens from\r\nplaces south of the range of _arctica_.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 J. A. Allen proposed the name _Putorius microtis_ for a\r\nspecimen from Shesley, northwestern British Columbia, a place\r\napproximately 50 miles northwest of Telegraph Creek. Considering the\r\ngreat disparity in size between this one specimen and the other larger\r\nspecimens of normal size, from the general region, available to Allen\r\nat that time, it is not surprising that he thought two full species\r\nwere represented. In 1943 when G. G. Goodwin called to my attention two\r\nmales, as small as the type of _microtis_ and taken by him\r\napproximately 300 miles east of Shesley, in the valley between the\r\nMusqwa and Prophet rivers, I for a second time examined all available\r\nspecimens and data with the possibility in mind that _microtis_ was a\r\nspecies or subspecies distinct from _M. e. richardsonii_, but again\r\nconcluded that only one subspecies was involved because no character\r\nexcept size was found to distinguish the large from the small\r\nindividuals of a given sex and there are, preserved from northern\r\nBritish Columbia, individuals of intermediate size. _Putorius microtis_\r\nAllen seems to have been based on an individual of _M. e. richardsonii_\r\nnear the lower limit of size for that subspecies and _microtis_ is\r\nregarded as a synonym.\r\n\r\nBarrett-Hamilton in 1904 named the animal at \"Fort Simpson, British\r\nColumbia\" _Putorius arcticus imperii_. Preble (1908:232) pointed out\r\nthat Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie undoubtedly was the place intended,\r\nand arranged _imperii_ as a synonym of _M. e. richardsonii_. The type\r\nspecimen of _imperii_ was stated to have been received from B. M. Ross\r\nwho is known to have collected specimens, including specimens of this\r\nspecies (now in U. S. Nat. Mus.), at Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie. I\r\nknow of no Fort Simpson in British Columbia. If, as seems improbable,\r\nPort Simpson, British Columbia, was the place that Barrett-Hamilton\r\nintended to designate (where so far as I know Ross did not collect),\r\nthe name _imperii_ still would seem to be a synonym of _richardsonii_\r\nbecause _richardsonii_ seems to be the race of weasel at Port Simpson.\r\nIn proposing the name _Putorius arcticus imperii_, Barrett-Hamilton\r\nstressed that the weasel, which he was naming, was a subspecies of _P.\r\narcticus_, gave characters which applied perfectly to _richardsonii_\r\nbut made no reference to _richardsonii_. Barrett-Hamilton did not refer\r\nto _richardsonii_ possibly because he relied on Merriam's\r\nclassification of 1896 wherein _richardsonii_ is treated as a species\r\ndistinct from _arctica_. Merriam, it will be remembered, held that\r\nslight degree of morphological difference rather than intergradation\r\nwas the criterion for subspecies. Although I have no record of having\r\nexamined the type specimen of _imperii_ I have but little hesitancy in\r\ntreating it as a synonym, and would have no hesitancy at all in so\r\ndoing if the type was certainly known to have been obtained at Fort\r\nSimpson on the Mackenzie.\r\n\r\nThe name _Mustela cicognanii mortigena_ Bangs, 1913, proposed for the\r\nermine of Newfoundland, is placed as a synonym of _richardsonii_ only\r\nafter repeated, detailed comparisons. In advance of study I supposed\r\nthat the isolation of the ermine, in Newfoundland, had contributed to\r\nits differentiation, which, however, the original describer, Bangs,\r\nindicated was slight. Bangs was a careful worker and I am confident\r\nthat the differences he described really existed between his specimens.\r\nMaterial more nearly adequate than he had from the mainland, shows the\r\nmales, so far as my measurements and comparisons go, to be in nowise\r\ndifferent from those in Newfoundland. Females in Newfoundland may have,\r\non the average, slightly longer hind feet than on the opposite mainland\r\nbut I am not certain that they do and even if there is a slight\r\ndifference in this regard as suggested by available data, I think it\r\ninsufficient basis, alone, for according subspecific status to the\r\ninsular animal.\r\n\r\nThe name _richardsonii_ was based by Bonaparte on Richardson's\r\ndescription which in turn was drawn from a specimen taken at Fort\r\nFranklin, that thus becomes the type locality. It is fortunate that\r\nPreble, in 1903, succeeded in taking specimens there because the place\r\nis near the belt of intergradation between _arctica_ and\r\n_richardsonii_. Of Preble's two adult males (see Preble, 1908:232) I\r\nhave examined no. 133847, which is in transitional pelage and therefore\r\ngives no clue in so far as coloration is concerned, as to affinities\r\nwith _arctica_ versus _richardsonii_. Specimens in the summer pelage\r\nare much to be desired from Fort Franklin. Regardless of what their\r\ncoloration may be, specimen no. 133847, in external measurements and\r\nmost certainly in cranial features is of the race to the south and not\r\nthe race that Merriam named _arctica_. Because all specimens from\r\nlocalities to the south of Fort Franklin likewise differ from _arctica_\r\nof the barren grounds, considerable additional confidence is felt in\r\nallocating the name _richardsonii_ to the animal which ranges from Fort\r\nFranklin southward rather than to the one, here designated _arctica_,\r\nthat occurs to the northward of Fort Franklin.\r\n\r\nAlthough in most structural features _richardsonii_ is a sort of\r\naverage for the American races of the species, it is the extreme in\r\nhigh degree of sexual dimorphism. The difference in size between the\r\nmales and females is greater than in any other race except possibly _M.\r\ne. kadiacensis_ in which so little is known of the female that the\r\ndifference between the two sexes cannot be accurately judged. It will\r\naid in understanding the high degree of secondary sexual difference in\r\n_richardsonii_ to visualize two kinds of weasels distributed over the\r\nnorthern half of the continent, thinking now of the geographic area in\r\nAmerica occupied by the whole species _Mustela erminea_ of which the\r\nsubspecies _richardsonii_ is only a part. One of the two kinds of\r\nweasel is the male ermine and the other the female. The decrease in\r\nsize of the male, as measured by the weight of the skull, is in the\r\nratio of 7 in the north to 2 in the south. This decrease is gradual\r\nwhereas the corresponding decrease from 3 to 1 in the female is not\r\ngradual; half of the decrease in the female occurs in the short north\r\nto south distance comprised in the belt of intergradation, along the\r\nnorthern boundary of _richardsonii_, between it and _arctica_. As a\r\nresult _richardsonii_ is composed of females with medium sized skulls\r\nand males with relatively large skulls, the ratio by weight being\r\napproximately 5 to 2. The disproportion in races of ermines both to the\r\nnorth and to the south is less. Actually in the north (_arctica_) the\r\napproximate ratio by weight is 2-1/3:1; in _richardsonii_, 2-1/2:1; in\r\nthe south (_muricus_), 1-2/5:1. Indicated in still another way in\r\n_richardsonii_ the skull of the female is 56 per cent lighter than that\r\nof the male and the skull of the male is 127 per cent heavier than that\r\nof the female. Intergradation with races whose ranges border on that of\r\n_richardsonii_ is complete. On the northern boundary of the range of\r\n_richardsonii_ along the western shore of Hudsons Bay for perhaps a\r\nhundred miles north of Eskimo Point, there are intergrades with\r\n_arctica_. As judged by their lesser size, individuals of this\r\npopulation are influenced by the _semplei_-stock. Otherwise,\r\nintergradation on the northern boundary, with _arctica_, is abrupt\r\nwhereas intergradation at the south, between _richardsonii_ and\r\n_cicognanii_, is gradual. Intergradation is similarly gradual between\r\n_richardsonii_ on the one hand and _bangsi_ and _invicta_ on the other.\r\nBy speaking of the intergradation as abrupt, it is intended, in this\r\ninstance, to indicate that in a relatively narrow belt, between the\r\ngeographic ranges of _arctica_ and _richardsonii_, ermines intermediate\r\nin color-pattern, shape of skull, and size, bridge the gap between the\r\nermine of the tundra (_arctica_) and that in the forest belt\r\n(_richardsonii_). It may be added that the degree of difference between\r\nthe two subspecies just mentioned is approximately twice as much as\r\nbetween _richardsonii_ and _cicognanii_. The intergradation between\r\n_cicognanii_ and _richardsonii_ is gradual. By gradual it is meant that\r\nthe change from one kind to the other is achieved in a wider area where\r\nermines from locality A do not differ appreciably from those taken at,\r\nsay, locality B, 50 miles farther south, although ermines from A and\r\nthose from a third locality, C, say, 130 miles south, clearly show\r\ndifferences indicative of geographic variation.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 1035, as follows.

In relation to the basilar length, the skull averages\r\nslightly narrower, slightly shallower as measured in the vertical plane\r\ntouching the posterior borders of the last upper molars, and the\r\npreorbital part is slightly longer. In skulls of females of\r\n_cicognanii_, linear measurements average 3 (0-6) per cent less, the\r\nweight is 16 per cent less and the teeth are 5 per cent shorter. In\r\nrelation to the basilar length, measurements of the skull are\r\napproximately the same or slightly less in _cicognanii_.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _bangsi_, the male sex in linear measurements of the\r\nskull and teeth averages 11 per cent less than in _bangsi_ from Aitkin,\r\nMinn., and 6 per cent less than in _bangsi_ from Elk River, but in\r\nrelation to the basilar length the preorbital region is larger. The\r\nweight is approximately a fourth less. In females the measurements\r\naverage less, some being the same, and in relation to the basilar\r\nlength, the bullae are shorter and the skull is shallower. The weight\r\nis about the same.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--In January, 1838, in Charlesworth's Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory, C. L. Bonaparte proposed for three kinds of American weasels\r\nthe names _Mustela cicognanii_, _Mustela richardsonii_ and _Mustela\r\nlongicauda_.\r\n\r\nIn this paper Bonaparte indicates that he previously had written (for\r\nhis Iconografia della Fauna Italica ...) an account of _Mustela\r\ncicognanii_ using this same name. Fasciola XXII of the Iconogr. d.\r\nFauna Italica, presenting his account of _Mustela_, like the English\r\npaper was published in the year 1838. In his article in Charlesworth's\r\nMagazine, Bonaparte refers to his book published [used the past tense]\r\nin Rome but whether it actually appeared first I am unable to determine\r\nand hence am uncertain which of the two constitutes the original\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nReference to the Italian account suggests as basis for the name _M.\r\ncicognanii_, (1) specimens possibly seen in the United States by\r\nBonaparte, or (2) Godman's published account of the animal.\r\n\r\nIn the English publication, however, Bonaparte actually says that (1)\r\nhe saw the small species in the Union [= United States]. Also, he (2)\r\nmentions his earlier written Italian account, (3) mentions that \"all\r\nthe [American?] naturalists\" used the name _M. vulgaris_ for this\r\nanimal, (4) incidentally mentions Godman's account, and (5) in naming\r\ntwo other American species cites accounts of them by Richardson. Also,\r\nBonaparte in this English article makes clear that when he wrote [not\r\nnecessarily published] his Italian paper he did not know of the\r\nexistence of two of the three American species.\r\n\r\nIn the register of mammals at the British Museum of Natural History,\r\nthere appears:\r\n\r\n  43.3.3.3 Mustela longicauda _Bonap_ N amer presented\r\n                                      by Dr. J. Richardson\r\n         4 Mustela Richardsonii Bonap        \"\r\n         5   \"     Cicognanii Bonap          \"\r\n\r\nTo the right of these entries there appears, in three lines, the\r\nnotation: \"The three specimens examined by Prince Canino on which he\r\nestablished the three species.\"\r\n\r\nEvery part of each of the above entries is in the hand writing of J. E.\r\nGray, in charge of the collections from 1824 to 1840 and associated\r\nwith them as Keeper until 1875. The three specimens are in good\r\ncondition considering their age. The catalogue or register number\r\nshows, among other things, that they were entered in the register on\r\nMarch 3, 1843.\r\n\r\nQuestions which might occur to anyone are:\r\n\r\n(1) Was there a type specimen of _Mustela Cicognanii_ Bonaparte? If so\r\nis it no. 43.3.3.5?\r\n\r\n(2) If there was no type specimen was there a type locality? If so what\r\nis it?\r\n\r\nAmong other things that may have bearing on these questions, are these:\r\nBonaparte in Charlesworth's Magazine appears to base the two names\r\n_Mustela Richardsonii_ and _Mustela longicauda_ on Richardson's\r\npublished account of _Mustela erminea_. At any rate immediately\r\nfollowing each of the two names, Bonaparte writes \"Nob. (_M. erminea_\r\nRich. F. Bor. Amer.).\" Bonaparte's other, first newly proposed name,\r\n_Mustela Cicognanii_, in Charlesworth's Magazine has following it only\r\n\"Nob. North America,\" although in a paragraph above he did point out\r\nthat this was the animal which all naturalists, at the time he was in\r\nAmerica, considered as _M. vulgaris_.\r\n\r\nTurning to Richardson's account (Fauna Boreali Americana, ...\r\nQuadrupeds, pp. 45-47. 1829) one finds that he recognized two species,\r\n_M. vulgaris_ and _M. erminea_. Of the first he gives measurements \"of\r\nan old female killed at Carlton House.\" Of the second species he\r\ndistinguishes two varieties, the first represented by a specimen, of\r\nwhich he gives measurements, \"killed at Fort Franklin, Great Bear Lake\"\r\nand, the second variety \"of a larger size, having a longer tail and\r\nlonger fore-claws\" he indicates the size of by giving measurements of\r\na specimen taken \"in the neighborhood of Carlton House.\"\r\n\r\nThe last variety is clearly the basis of Bonaparte's _M. longicauda_.\r\nThe specimen from which Richardson took his measurements I have been\r\nunable to locate [no. 43.3.3.3 in the British Museum, appears to be\r\nanother specimen, although of the same subspecies and provided by\r\nRichardson].\r\n\r\nThe first variety of Richardson's _Mustela erminea_, clearly is the\r\nbasis of Bonaparte's _M. Richardsonii_. The specimen from which\r\nRichardson took his measurements may well be no. 43.3.3.4 now preserved\r\nin the British Museum of Natural History, but I could not be certain\r\nabout this.\r\n\r\nRichardson's _M. vulgaris_ is accompanied by measurements of a female\r\nwhich I have ascertained to my full satisfaction is the identical\r\nspecimen now bearing catalogue number 43.3.3.5 said by Gray to be the\r\nspecimen on which Bonaparte based his name _Mustela cicognanii_.\r\n\r\nGray probably saw his guest, Bonaparte, at work on these weasels and\r\nGray's own written indication perhaps should be accepted at its face\r\nvalue. I found only 4 Richardson specimens of North American weasel in\r\nthe British Museum in 1937 and it is conceivable that Bonaparte, 100\r\nyears before, actually had at hand only one specimen each of two kinds\r\nand 2 specimens of the third. This I think is not an important\r\nconsideration, though, for Gray says just which specimens did serve as\r\nbasis for Bonaparte's names and there is only one specimen for each\r\nname according to Gray.\r\n\r\nBut I wonder if a type specimen can be _made_ in this way? That is to\r\nsay, after a name is published in a manner which makes it available,\r\nand if two or more specimens of the kind of animal involved, were, or\r\nmay have been, available to the describer, can a person, even the\r\nauthor, himself, _make_ a type specimen by saying that one particular\r\nspecimen is beyond doubt the specimen on which a given name was\r\nestablished even though no particular specimen was designated in the\r\noriginal description? I incline to the view that a specimen so\r\ndesignated would at most be only a lectotype, unless it were a cotype.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a holotype can be _made_ by action such as Gray took, then\r\n(1) is no. 43.3.3.3 the type specimen of _Mustela longicauda_ Bonaparte\r\nand, (2) is no. 43.3.3.4 the type specimen of _Mustela Richardsonii_\r\nBonaparte?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, _Mustela longicauda_ Bonaparte whether based on no.\r\n43.3.3.3 or on Richardson's account will continue in its present\r\napplication. The same is true of _Mustela richardsonii_. If the basis\r\nof _Mustela cicognanii_ Bonaparte [the diagnosis in the Iconografia d.\r\nFauna Italica ... makes it clear that the name applies to the\r\n_short-tailed_ species] was a weasel from the eastern United States or\r\na description of a weasel or weasels from there, the name will continue\r\nin its present application. If, instead, the name is based on no.\r\n43.3.3.3 (from Carlton House, Saskatchewan) or on Richardson's account\r\nof _M. vulgaris_, the name will apply to a different subspecies (now\r\ncalled _richardsonii_ and _richardsonii_ will fall as a synonym of\r\n_cicognanii_) and the ermine of the eastern United States will take the\r\nnext available name. Bonaparte probably named (in manuscript at least)\r\n_cicognanii_ before he ever saw the specimen in the British Museum.\r\nThis is indicated by his statement in Charlesworth's Magazine (1838:37)\r\nthat \"I have _now_ [Italics mine] found two [other] American\r\nspecies. . . .\" Whereas the names _richardsonii_ and _longicauda_ are\r\nbased on Richardson, the name _cicognanii_, even if it dates from the\r\naccount in Charlesworth's Magazine, appears to have a composite basis\r\ncomposed at the very least of (1) animals seen by Bonaparte in the\r\nUnited States, and (2) those called _vulgaris_ by some other authors.\r\nConceivably the specimen no. 43.3.3.3 in the British Museum, was part\r\nof the basis. From the nature of the case it can be argued that there\r\ncould be no type and that if someone should bring to light a specimen\r\nin, say, Philadelphia, bearing the notation \"this is the specimen seen\r\nin the United States by Bonaparte\" it would immediately become as\r\nimportant as the one in London. Any American weasel or weasels (then\r\nalive or preserved in a zoölogical collection) that Bonaparte saw in\r\nthe United States probably were of the eastern United States. Bangs\r\n(1896:18-21), for one, previous to the present consideration of the\r\nname _cicognanii_, restricted it to the ermine of the eastern United\r\nStates. Consequently, the name _cicognanii_, in the present account is\r\napplied to the ermine of the eastern United States. In my opinion there\r\nwas and is no type. Almost certainly there was no type if the Fauna\r\nItalica appeared before the account in Charlesworth's Magazine did.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 172, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by provinces and states, then (except where indication is given to\r\n     the contrary) by counties from north to south within each state or\r\n     province.

Two adults from Aitkin each weigh\r\n     170 grams.\r\n\r\n     Four adult and subadult females from Elk River and Fort Snelling,\r\n     Minnesota, yield average and extreme measurements as follows:\r\n     Total length, 249 (240-260); length of tail, 61 (55-65); length of\r\n     hind foot, 32 (30-33).\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except\r\n     that, least width of color of underparts averaging, in males from\r\n     Minnesota, 32 (19-51) per cent of greatest width of color of upper\r\n     parts. Black tip of tail in 12 male topotypes in white winter\r\n     pelage averaging 52 (45-58) mm. which is 60 (53-66) per cent of\r\n     length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on adults from Aitkin): See measurements and\r\n     plates 2-4. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except\r\n     that: Weight of 2 adults from Aitkin, 2.2, 2.3 grams (9 subadults\r\n     from T. 61 N, R. 26 W, average 1.95 grams); basilar length, 39.7\r\n     (38.5-40.7); length of tooth-rows rarely more (usually less) than\r\n     length of tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on adults from Minnesota as listed in table of\r\n     cranial measurements, which see): See plates 9-11. As described in\r\n     _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight, of a subadult\r\n     from T. 61 N, R. 26 W, 0.91 grams; basilar length, 32.8\r\n     (31.8-33.6); breadth of rostrum rarely equal to as much as 30 per\r\n     cent of basilar length.\r\n\r\nFrom _richardsonii_, topotypes of _bangsi_ differ in that cranial\r\nmeasurements in males are approximately 7 (5-9) per cent less, linear\r\nmeasurements of teeth are 10 (9-11) per cent less and the skull is a\r\nfifth lighter. In relation to basilar length the tympanic bullae of\r\n_bangsi_ are longer. Skulls of females are individually\r\nindistinguishable, those of _bangsi_ averaging approximately 1 per cent\r\nless in linear measurements. Comparison with the smaller cicognanii is\r\nmade in the account of that subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Before the subspecific name _bangsi_ was proposed,\r\nindividuals of this subspecies ordinarily were recorded in the\r\nliterature as _Mustela cicognanii_. The best single lot of material is\r\nin the zoölogical collection of the University of Wisconsin. The late\r\nnaturalist Albert Lano preserved a large share of the material from\r\nMinnesota. The large series from Elk River of that same state was\r\nmostly collected by Bernard Bailey although his Aunt, Anna (Bailey)\r\nMills, and her brother the late Vernon Bailey, at an earlier time saved\r\nsome specimens from Elk River. The name _bangsi_ was proposed in\r\nrecognition of the superior work done on American weasels by the late\r\nOutram Bangs.\r\n\r\nFrom the range of _M. e. invicta_ in the Rocky Mountains, that of\r\n_bangsi_ is separated by the Great Plains from a large part of which\r\nregion the species is unknown. _M. e. bangsi_ differs from _invicta_ in\r\ngreater degree of sexual dimorphism in size, and in each sex by larger\r\nsize, narrower light-colored underparts, and deeper braincase as\r\nmeasured at the anterior margin of the basioccipital. In _bangsi_ the\r\nbraincase is deeper relative to the length of the skull as well as, of\r\ncourse, actually deeper.\r\n\r\nOf the two subspecies whose ranges do meet that of _bangsi_, it more\r\nclosely resembles _richardsonii_ than _cicognanii_. From\r\n_richardsonii_, especially from southeastern populations of the same in\r\nwhich the skull is of the same size as in _bangsi_, the latter differs\r\nin longer hind feet. This is an average difference and by one\r\ninterpretation the animals here referred to _bangsi_ might be lumped\r\nwith some of the populations from the southeastern part of the range of\r\n_richardsonii_ and the whole lot treated as intergrades between\r\n_richardsonii_ and _cicognanii_. Nevertheless, the animals here\r\nreferred to bangsi are not geographically intermediate between\r\n_richardsonii_ and _cicognanii_ and this consideration had much to do\r\nwith the decision to recognize as a separate subspecies the animals\r\nhere named _bangsi_.\r\n\r\nWithin the range of the subspecies there is some geographic variation;\r\nthe hind feet of animals from Iowa average slightly shorter than those\r\nof animals from Minnesota and Wisconsin but are nowhere nearly so short\r\nas in _cicognanii_ at the same latitude in the eastern United States.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the few specimens seen from Isle Royal have the\r\nlong hind feet of _bangsi_ and not the short hind feet of _cicognanii_\r\nwhich occurs all along the northern mainland.\r\n\r\nBecause an oft cited record of occurrence even though erroneous, has a\r\nway of being repeated in later works, attention is here called to the\r\nalleged occurrence of this ermine in northwestern Ohio at New Bremen.\r\nHenninger (1921:239) published the original account of the supposed\r\noccurrence but as I pointed out in 1937 (p. 304), the specimen\r\nconcerned proved upon examination to be a female of _Mustela frenata\r\nnoveboracensis_. Henninger was misled probably by the short tail; the\r\nend of the tail had been lost and healed over before the animal's\r\ndeath. The present study has revealed that _M. erminea_ everywhere east\r\nof the Cascade Mountains assumes a white winter coat. Had this been\r\nknown when Henninger obtained his specimen he probably would not have\r\nwrongly identified the animal from New Bremen which was in the brown,\r\nwinter pelage.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 222, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by provinces and states and, arranged from north to south, by\r\n     counties in each state.

The postmolar part of the right lower jaw is missing.\r\n     The teeth all are present and entire.

See figure 25 on page 95.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. e.\r\n     richardsonii_, in males, by skull lighter than 1.9 grams, mastoid\r\n     breadth less than 19.9, depth of skull at anterior margin of\r\n     basioccipital less than 12.4, in females by corresponding\r\n     measurement of depth less than 10.1, and weight of skull less than\r\n     one gram; from _M. e. fallenda_, in both sexes, by upper lips\r\n     white (not brown), in males by skull averaging longer (37.0 versus\r\n     35.7), in females by breadth of rostrum less, instead of more,\r\n     than 30 per cent of basilar length; from _M. e. streatori_,\r\n     _gulosa_, and _muricus_ by hind foot more than 36 and basilar\r\n     length more than 35 in males and by hind foot more than 29.5 and\r\n     basilar length more than 30.5 in females; further distinguished\r\n     from _streatori_ by white (not brown) upper lips and from _gulosa_\r\n     by black tip of tail more than half length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Ten adults and subadults from\r\n     central Idaho County yield average and extreme measurements as\r\n     follows: Total length, 291 (272-328); length of tail, 86 (75-100);\r\n     length of hind foot, 39.9 (38-44).\r\n\r\n     Female: Five adults and subadults from the same locality yield\r\n     average and extreme measurements as follows: Total length, 255\r\n     (245-270); length of tail, 71 (68-76); length of hind foot, 32.3\r\n     (32-33).\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except\r\n     that underparts in summer Marguerite Yellow or more whitish; least\r\n     width of color of underparts averaging, in four females from Idaho\r\n     and Montana, 38 (33-43) per cent of greatest width of color of\r\n     upper parts. Black tip of tail in same specimens 38 (31-42) mm.\r\n     which is 57 (52-65) per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (5 adults from Idaho County): See measurements and\r\n     plates 2-4. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except\r\n     that: Weight, 1.5 (1.4-1.7) grams; basilar length, 37.0\r\n     (35.8-39.8).\r\n\r\n     Female (illustrated by adult and 4 subadults in table of cranial\r\n     measurements, which see): See plates 9-11. As described in\r\n     _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight, 0.72 (0.7-0.9)\r\n     grams; basilar length, 32.2 (31.6-32.8).\r\n\r\nFrom _fallenda_, _invicta_ differs in that the skull of the male has a\r\nrelatively narrower rostrum and relatively shallower braincase. Females\r\nshow the same differences but the degree of difference is about as\r\ngreat again as in males. The teeth are almost exactly the same size in\r\nthe two subspecies. The weight is the same in males but in females\r\n_invicta_ is 18 per cent heavier.\r\n\r\nFrom _streatori_, _invicta_ differs in that males average larger in\r\nevery measurement taken except that the anteroposterior diameter of the\r\ninner moiety of M1 is less; 36 per cent heavier; linear measurements of\r\nthe skull are about 5 per cent larger and those of the teeth, with the\r\none exception noted, about 6 per cent larger; relative to the basilar\r\nlength the tympanic bullae are longer and the rostrum is relatively\r\nnarrower. In females, measurements of the skull average 8 per cent more\r\nand those of the teeth 7 per cent more except that, as in males, the\r\ninner lobe of M1 is actually shorter. Females of _invicta_ are 12 per\r\ncent heavier; relative to the basilar length the skull is narrower\r\nthroughout and the tooth-rows are shorter than in _streatori_.\r\n\r\nFrom _gulosa_, _invicta_ differs in that males average larger (about 12\r\nper cent) in every measurement taken, excepting the anteroposterior\r\ndiameter of M1 which is the same; 50 per cent heavier; relative to the\r\nbasilar length the length of the tooth-rows and interorbital breadth\r\nare less. In females the inner lobe of M1 is smaller but every other\r\nmeasurement taken of the skull and teeth is more, _invicta_ averaging\r\nabout 8 per cent larger and 22 per cent heavier; relative to the\r\nbasilar length, the tooth-rows are shorter and the skull is narrower\r\ninterorbitally, through the rostrum and across the zygomata.\r\n\r\nFrom _murica_, _invicta_ of corresponding sex differs in being larger\r\nin every measurement taken; males average 17 per cent larger in cranial\r\nmeasurements, 13 per cent larger in dental measurements and are 83 per\r\ncent heavier; corresponding percentages for females are 11, 9 and 20.\r\nException must again be made for the anteroposterior diameter of the\r\ninner lobe of the last upper molar which is less in females, and only\r\nslightly more in males. In males of _invicta_ the tympanic bullae are\r\nlonger in relation to the basilar length.\r\n\r\nFrom the geographically remote _cicognanii_, skulls of both males and\r\nfemales of _invicta_ are to me individually indistinguishable. There\r\nis, nevertheless, an average difference not apparent to the eye between\r\nskulls of males. If the length of the tooth-rows be taken as a standard\r\n(100 per cent), the rostrum, of _invicta_, as measured across the\r\nlacrimal processes is broader (89 rather than 84 per cent) but the\r\nwidth across the fourth upper premolars is less, 94 rather than 97 per\r\ncent of the length of the tooth-rows.\r\n\r\nSince the skull of _invicta_ closely resembles that of _cicognanii_, it\r\nfollows that _invicta_ differs from _richardsonii_ and _bangsi_ in\r\nabout the manner described in the account of _cicognanii_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Animals of this subspecies in advance of the present study\r\ngenerally were recorded in the literature under the name _Mustela\r\ncicognanii_. The difficulty in distinguishing individual specimens of\r\n_invicta_ on morphological grounds from those of the geographically\r\nremote _M. e. cicognanii_ should not be taken to indicate that the\r\npopulations do not differ appreciably. Actually they differ in several\r\ncharacters although in no one of these is the degree of difference\r\nsufficient to allow of using it alone as a certain means of diagnosis.\r\nIn _invicta_, as compared with _cicognanii_, the light-colored\r\nunderparts are wider in relation to the dark-colored upper parts and\r\nthe tail is longer by 4 per cent relative to the head and body. Given a\r\npopulation of each of the two subspecies, in which the skull is of the\r\nsame mass, the hind feet are longer in _invicta_, there is more sexual\r\ndimorphism in size, and the anterior part of the skull differs in some\r\nparticulars as just described in the comparison of the skull of\r\n_invicta_ with other forms. Nevertheless, each of these differences is\r\nof an average sort. Therefore, and because overall size is about the\r\nsame in the two subspecies concerned, one or a few specimens from, say,\r\ncentral Idaho, can be distinguished from animals from western\r\nPennsylvania only with difficulty, if at all. The close resemblance of\r\nskulls of _invicta_ and _cicognanii_ may be a function of their living\r\nat approximately the same latitudinal position in a climate that has\r\nmarked seasonal variation.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _richardsonii_ is complete and gradual; in one\r\nsense _invicta_ is but little more than a small _richardsonii_.\r\nIntergradation with _fallenda_ is shown by several specimens. These two\r\nraces differ in large degree in color, and in size and shape of the\r\nskull of females. Although the geographic area where intergradation in\r\ncolor occurs is fairly wide, the area in which intergradation in\r\ncranial characters in females occurs, appears, from the inadequate\r\nmaterial available, to be much narrower. Intergradation occurs freely\r\nin Washington with _streatori_ but with _muricus_ so far as known only\r\nin the Bitterroot and nearby mountains of northwestern Montana. The\r\nSnake River Plains and low country along much of the Columbia River\r\nappears to be uninhabited by weasels of the species _erminea_ and hence\r\nthere is opportunity for intergradation only in the mentioned area of\r\nMontana.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 177, as follows.

The left exoccipital condyle and adjacent region is\r\n     less developed than the right and the posterior part of the skull\r\n     is bent slightly to the left. Otherwise the skull is unbroken. The\r\n     teeth all are present and entire. The skin is in the brown summer\r\n     coat, fairly well made and in a good state of preservation.

Black tip of tail in same specimens averaging 36 (30-40)\r\n     mm. which is 49 (48-53) per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 8 adults from Windham): See measurements\r\n     and plates, 2-4. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_\r\n     except that: Weight, 1.8 (1.5-2.6) grams; basilar length, 37.5\r\n     (36.5-38.9); length of tooth-rows more or less than (about same\r\n     as) length of tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 5 adults, from localities listed in the table of\r\n     cranial measurements): See measurements and plates 9-11. As\r\n     described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight,\r\n     0.96 (0.7-1.1) grams; basilar length, 32.7 (31.9-33.2); breadth of\r\n     rostrum more or less than (about equal to) 30 per cent of basilar\r\n     length.\r\n\r\nFrom _richardsonii_, _alascensis_ differs in that the skull of the male\r\naverages smaller in every measurement taken and is 28 per cent\r\nlighter. Relative to the basilar length, the orbitonasal length is more\r\nand the braincase is shallower as measured at the anterior end of the\r\nbasioccipital. The four adult females seen of _alascensis_ are more\r\nvariable than those of _richardsonii_ and average smaller in some\r\nmeasurements and larger in others but give no proof of any consistent\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nFrom _haidarum_, _alascensis_ differs in that the rostrum and entire\r\npreorbital part of the skull is actually as well as relatively much\r\nsmaller in both sexes. In males of _alascensis_ the length of the\r\nskull, and other cranial measurements of length, is more. In males, the\r\nmastoid breadth and zygomatic breadth are about the same as in\r\n_haidarum_, as also is the weight. M1 is larger but m1 and P4 are\r\nsmaller. In females the anteroposterior extent of the inner moiety of\r\nM1 and length of tympanic bulla are about the same in the two\r\nsubspecies but all other cranial and dental measurements in\r\n_alascensis_ are less. It is 29 per cent lighter. The difference in the\r\npreorbital region is of about the same degree as in the males.\r\n\r\nComparisons of the skull with those of _arctica_, _salva_, _initis_,\r\n_celenda_, and _seclusa_ are made in the accounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The relatively few specimens known of this race seem always\r\nto have been referred to in the literature by the name _alascensis_ and\r\nthe nomenclatural history is therefore simple. The original materials\r\nwere obtained by the collector Clark P. Streator and the additional\r\nseries of skeletons, one with skin, from Windham were procured by\r\nStanton Price, a resident there.\r\n\r\nThe subspecies is well differentiated from both _arctica_ and\r\n_richardsonii_. Although actual intergrades are lacking between\r\n_alascensis_ and the two races just mentioned I have no doubt that\r\nintergradation occurs with _richardsonii_ and think it probably does\r\nalso with _arctica_.\r\n\r\nThe assignment of the three females from Mitkof Island, Zarembo Island,\r\nand Loring on Revillagigedo Island, is tentative because each is so\r\nyoung as not to show diagnostic cranial characters. The two other\r\nspecimens from Revillagigedo Island (Carroll Inlet), labeled as males,\r\nare in white winter pelage. Only one, no. 136358, a subadult, is\r\naccompanied by a skull. The small size of each specimen, and its\r\ncranial characters which are intermediate between those of males and\r\nfemales of _alascensis_ of the adjacent mainland, indicate the\r\nexistence of a distinct race of weasel on Revillagigedo Island. On the\r\nchance that the one specimen with a skull is a dwarf, or is wrongly\r\nsexed as seems improbable, the population is tentatively referred to\r\n_alascensis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.

The tympanic bullae do not project so\r\nfar below the squamosals and the braincase itself is shallower, in\r\nadults averaging only 11.5 mm. as against 12.5 mm. The overall depth of\r\nthe braincase, including the tympanic bullae, when divided into the\r\norbitonasal length gives an average of 93 (90-97) per cent whereas in\r\n_alascensis_ the figure is only 85 (78-88) per cent. On this basis\r\nalone, everyone of the adult skulls of the two races can be\r\ndistinguished. The females and subadult males show the same tendency to\r\nreduction in depth of braincase but not every individual among them can\r\nbe surely distinguished. By weight the skull of _salva_ of\r\ncorresponding sex is only about 6 per cent smaller. Comparisons with\r\n_initis_ and _celenda_ are made in the accounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Most of the specimens seen were collected by Allen E.\r\nHasselborg, resident on Admiralty Island. On the basis of skulls--few\r\nskins, and measurements taken in the flesh, are available--_salva_ more\r\nclosely resembles _alascensis_ than does any other subspecies so far\r\nknown from southeastern Alaska.

As described in _Mustela erminea\r\n     richardsonii_ except that: Weight, 2.3 and 2.5 grams; basilar\r\n     length, 39.6, and 40.5; interorbital breadth equal to distance\r\n     between glenoid fossa and posterior border of external auditory\r\n     meatus.\r\n\r\n     Female: No adults available.\r\n\r\nFrom _salva_, _initis_ differs in that skulls of males average larger\r\nin every measurement taken, being 41 per cent heavier. Relative to the\r\nbasilar length, the interorbital and preorbital parts of the skull are\r\nlarger; the relatively greater interorbital and mastoid breadths are\r\nparticularly noticeable. Although the depth of the braincase, including\r\nthe tympanic bullae, is both relatively as well as actually more than\r\nin _salva_, the depth is relatively less than in _alascensis_ which\r\notherwise differs from initis in about the same way that _salva_\r\ndiffers from _initis_. Whereas the interorbital breadth in _initis_ is\r\nabout equal to the distance between the glenoid fossa and the posterior\r\nborder of the external auditory meatus, the interorbital breadth is\r\nuniformly less than this distance in both _salva_ and _alascensis_. In\r\ncomparison with _seclusa_ the teeth are of the same size but all\r\nmeasurements of the skull are larger. The skull of _initis_ is 25 per\r\ncent heavier. In relation to the basilar length, the interorbital and\r\npreorbital parts of the skull are much less in _initis_. The preorbital\r\nand interorbital regions in _initis_ are relatively smaller in\r\ncomparison also with _arctica_. The one measurement of interorbital\r\nbreadth in _initis_ is greater in relation to the basilar length than\r\nin _kadiacensis_ but the rostral region, and all that part of the skull\r\nanterior to the braincase, is relatively smaller in _initis_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The two adult males, nos. 286 and 289 from Saook Bay,\r\nprovide convincing evidence of the existence of a distinct race of\r\nweasel on Baranof Island. Three other young specimens, almost subadult,\r\nfrom the same place are labeled as males although the basilar lengths\r\nof these skulls are only 35.5, 35.9 and 37.3 millimeters as against\r\n39.6 and 40.5 in the two adult males. The difference in size is too\r\ngreat to be age-variation. The fact that 3 are definitely of one\r\ncategory and 2 of the other makes it doubtful that individual variation\r\naccounts for the differences. The small size of these 3 specimens and\r\nthe fact that in each the anterior margin of the tympanic bulla is\r\nflush with the squamosal rather than protruded from the braincase,\r\nsuggests that the three are females. If they are females, the amount of\r\nsecondary sexual variation is rather less than would be expected by\r\nanalogy with the amount obtaining in _alascensis_ on the mainland and\r\nin _salva_ on Admiralty Island. Another possibility that I can not\r\ndisprove is that two stocks of weasels persist on Baranof Island, the\r\ntwo larger specimens being descendants of the stock which first became\r\nestablished on the island and the three smaller specimens being\r\ndescendants of an individual ermine, or of ermines, that were rafted or\r\notherwise transported to the island at a considerably later date.\r\nAssuming for the moment that there are two stocks, it must be admitted\r\nthat each one differs from any stock known from elsewhere. Therefore,\r\neach stock would be presumed to have been long resident on the island.\r\nBut--two stocks as closely related as the two in question would not be\r\nexpected to persist for long in an area as small as that of Baranof\r\nIsland because competition would give one the ascendancy. Therefore,\r\nthe first suggestion, namely that the three smaller animals are really\r\nfemales, seems the more probable. The feasible way to clear up the\r\npresent uncertainty is, of course, to obtain additional specimens,\r\ncarefully labeled as to sex. Yet another reason why additional\r\ncollecting is desirable in this area is to ascertain whether there is\r\nsubspecific differentiation between the ermines of Baranof and\r\nChichagof islands. The one specimen available from the latter island,\r\nalthough in general like the three smaller animals from Baranof Island,\r\ndiffers in the fuller (less scooped out) medial side of the tympanic\r\nbulla and to a slight degree in each of some other features. This\r\nspecimen from Chichagof Island is labeled as a male also.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 6, arranged by localities\r\n     from north to south, and in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy,\r\n     University of California.\r\n\r\n     =Alaska.= Chichagof Island, Freshwater Bay, 1.

Additional to differences therein noted, _celenda_ differs\r\nfrom _initis_ in larger interorbital and preorbital parts of the skull\r\nalthough dimensions of other parts of the skull and the teeth are about\r\nthe same or even less. From _salva_, _celenda_ differs in larger\r\naverage size in every measurement taken, except for the inner moiety of\r\nM1 which is about the same. The skull of _celenda_ is 35 per cent\r\nheavier. In relation to the basilar length the skull of _celenda_ is\r\nwider, especially in the interorbital and preorbital regions. In\r\ncomparison with _alascensis_ the tympanic bullae are of approximately\r\nthe same length; otherwise essentially the same differences obtain as\r\nare noted in comparison with _salva_ and the zygomatic breadth is\r\nrelatively more in _celenda_. From _seclusa_, in which the teeth are of\r\ncomparable size, _celenda_ differs in that every cranial measurement is\r\nmore and the skull is 28 per cent heavier. Because the skull of\r\n_celenda_ is so much longer, its dimensions in other planes are less in\r\nrelation to the length than in _seclusa_. _M. e. celenda_ is larger in\r\nevery part measured than _haidarum_, 21 per cent heavier, and in\r\nrelation to the basilar length the interorbital, and preorbital, parts\r\nof the skull are smaller, the braincase is shallower, and the skull is\r\nrelatively wider across the zygomata and mastoid processes. In\r\ncomparison with _kadiacensis_, differences are: 26 per cent lighter,\r\nskull shorter; in relation to the basilar length, braincase shallower\r\nas measured at the anterior end of the basioccipital, tooth-rows\r\nshorter but orbitonasal length more. In comparison with _arctica_ all\r\nparts measured of the teeth and skull of _celenda_ are smaller and its\r\nskull is 34 per cent lighter. In relation to the basilar length, the\r\ninterorbital breadth of _celenda_ is only slightly less but its skull\r\nis narrower across the rostrum and zygomata, the tooth-rows are\r\nshorter, and the braincase is shallower.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The late George Willett in the course of his work in Alaska\r\ncollected most of the known specimens of this strongly differentiated\r\nsubspecies. In both coloration and cranial characters the\r\ndistinguishing features are so well marked that the zoölogist could\r\nwith reason accord full specific rank to _celenda_. Nevertheless it\r\nobviously is an ermine. Also, races from other islands of southeastern\r\nAlaska tend to bridge the gap, as regards cranial features, between\r\n_celenda_ and the mainland ermine. The specimen from Dall Island agrees\r\nin all respects with topotypes. The specimen from Howkan on Long Island\r\nis in white winter pelage and the skull has suffered shrinkage from\r\nsome chemical solution; the reference of this specimen to _celenda_ is\r\ntentative.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 25, as follows: Arranged by\r\n     localities from north to south.

The teeth are about the same size.\r\nIn relation to its length the skull of _seclusa_ is much broader and\r\ndeeper. From _haidarum_, _seclusa_ differs in: teeth larger; skull\r\nshorter and more convex in dorsal outline along median longitudinal\r\naxis; in relation to basilar length, skull broader, deeper and\r\nbraincase relatively shorter.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The characters shown in the one available skull are far\r\noutside the limits of individual variation for other known subspecies.\r\nOther specimens are much to be desired to ascertain what the \"average\"\r\nindividual is like and to learn the characters of the female.\r\n\r\n     _Specimen examined._--One, the holotype.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela erminea haidarum= (Preble)\r\n\r\nErmine\r\n\r\nPlates 5, 6, 7, 11, 12 and 13\r\n\r\n    _Putorius haidarum_ Preble, Proc.

Black tip of tail in same males averaging 62\r\n     (60-70) mm. which is 92 (83-115) per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     The close correspondence in color-pattern of this weasel with the\r\n     Arctic races, _arctica_, _polaris_, _semplei_ and _kadiacensis_ is\r\n     noteworthy, and distinguishes it from weasels on the adjacent\r\n     mainland and adjoining islands to the north and south. The color\r\n     of the upper parts is darker than in the four Arctic races named.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (7 adults): See measurements and plates 5-7. As\r\n     described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight,\r\n     1.9 (1.7-2.0) grams; basilar length, 36.7 (35.6-37.5); length of\r\n     tooth-rows more than length of tympanic bullae; breadth of rostrum\r\n     measured across lacrimal processes more than a third of basilar\r\n     length; interorbital breadth more than distance between glenoid\r\n     fossa and posterior margin of external auditory meatus; zygomatic\r\n     breadth barely less than distance between last upper molar and\r\n     jugular foramen.\r\n\r\n     Female (2 adults): See measurements and plates 11-13. As described\r\n     in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight, 1.3 and 1.4\r\n     grams; basilar length, 34.2; length of tooth-rows more or less\r\n     than (about equal to) length of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum\r\n     more than 30 per cent of basilar length; interorbital breadth not\r\n     less than distance between glenoid fossa and posterior margin of\r\n     external auditory meatus.\r\n\r\nFrom _richardsonii_, _haidarum_ differs in that skull of the male is\r\nactually larger in its anterior part (breadth of rostrum, interorbital\r\nbreadth and orbitonasal length) but all measurements of other parts\r\naverage less. In relation to the basilar length, the tympanic bulla is\r\nshorter but all other measurements are more. In the skull of the\r\nfemale, which is 23 per cent heavier, the width of the tympanic bulla\r\nand anteroposterior extent of the inner lobe of M1 are the same; in all\r\nother measurements the female of _haidarum_ is larger, and in relation\r\nto the basilar length all measurements are more except the depth of the\r\nskull at the anterior margin of the basioccipital and the width of the\r\ntympanic bulla, which are less. By actual weight the skull of the male\r\nis 25 per cent lighter and the skull of the female 24 per cent heavier\r\nthan in _richardsonii_. From _fallenda_ and _anguinae_, _haidarum_\r\ndiffers in that measurements of the skulls of both sexes either average\r\nmore, or are uniformly more, with two exceptions. These are the lesser\r\nlength and breadth of the tympanic bulla, in comparison with males of\r\n_fallenda_, and the dimensions of M1 which are about the same in all\r\nthree races concerned. The pre-and interorbital parts are larger in\r\nrelation to the remainder of the skull. The postorbital breadth is\r\nactually a third more than in _fallenda_. In relation to the basilar\r\nlength, the tympanic bulla is shorter and the braincase deeper than in\r\nmales of _anguinae_. The skull of the male is 27 per cent heavier than\r\nthat of _fallenda_ and 58 per cent heavier than that of _anguinae_. The\r\nskull of the female is 59 and 50 per cent heavier than those of\r\n_fallenda_ and _anguinae_, respectively. Comparison of the skull with\r\nthose of _alascensis_, _celenda_ and _seclusa_ has been made in the\r\naccounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The available specimens of this ermine were obtained by J.\r\nH. Keen in 1898, Wilfred H. Osgood and E. A. Lewis in 1900, W. W. Brown\r\nin 1914, J. A. Munro in 1917 and 1918, and Allan Brooks in 1920. _M. e.\r\nhaidarum_ has more claim to full specific status than any other race of\r\nermine because the diagnostic structural features are numerous and\r\nindividually of relatively great degree. Indeed, individual variation\r\nappears not to bridge the gap between any population of _haidarum_ and\r\nother subspecies and strong reasons could be advanced for according\r\n_haidarum_ the status of a full species. It differs from the subspecies\r\nof _erminea_ on the adjoining mainland and adjoining islands to the\r\nnorth and south and agrees with the Arctic races (_arctica_, _polaris_,\r\n_semplei_ and _kadiacensis_) in great extent of the color of the\r\nunderparts, extension of this color onto the underneath side of the\r\ntail, long black tip of the tail and general form of the skull\r\nincluding the relatively heavy preorbital region. The color although\r\ndarker than in the Arctic subspecies, is lighter than in the insular\r\nraces immediately to the north and south. In combination, the features\r\nmentioned could be taken as indication that _haidarum_ is a relict\r\npopulation from a former glacial period. Assuming that it is a relict\r\npopulation, the color may have become slightly darker since that period\r\nbut the main response appears to have been a decrease in size for this\r\nis a much smaller animal than the Arctic ermines. The size is about\r\nwhat would be expected if one were to judge by the slightly larger\r\nermines on the islands of southeastern Alaska to the north and the\r\nsmaller ermine on Vancouver Island to the south.\r\n\r\nThe ermines of the islands of southeastern Alaska, excepting possibly\r\nthe incompletely known _seclusa_, have fewer characters of the Arctic\r\nraces and more characters of the races of the adjoining mainland.\r\nTherefore, a possible inference is that the distinctive characters of\r\nermines of the Alaskan islands developed with the aid of isolation from\r\nstocks which reached the islands after the glacial period. _M. e.\r\nhaidarum_ may have found its way to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 17, as follows.

Black tip of tail in same\r\n     series averaging 37 (26-46) mm. which is 46 (32-54) per cent of\r\n     length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 13 adults): See measurements and plates\r\n     5-7. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 1.2 (1.0-1.3) grams; basilar length, 34.0 (32.5-35.6);\r\n     length of tooth-rows more or less (usually less) than length of\r\n     tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 5 adults): See measurements and plates 11-13. As\r\n     described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight\r\n     0.9 (0.77-1.06) grams; basilar length, 31.5 (30.9-31.8) grams;\r\n     length of tooth-rows more or less than (approximately same as)\r\n     length of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum more than 30 per cent\r\n     of basilar length.\r\n\r\nThe sexual dimorphism in the skull is slight, the skull of the male\r\nbeing only a third heavier than that of the female. In _fallenda_ of\r\nthe adjacent mainland to the east the male is three-fourths heavier\r\nthan the female. In comparison with _fallenda_, males are smaller,\r\naveraging less in every cranial and dental measurement taken and by\r\nweight are a fifth lighter; sagittal crest absent rather than present;\r\ntympanic bullae flush with squamosal rather than projecting below floor\r\nof braincase; in relation to basilar length, tympanic bullae smaller,\r\nbraincase deeper and broader, skull wider interorbitally and across\r\nzygomata. Females are larger than in _fallenda_, and with one exception\r\naverage larger in every cranial and dental measurement taken, being 6\r\nper cent heavier. The one exception mentioned is the lesser actual\r\nlength of the tympanic bulla in _anguinae_, in which the length of the\r\ntooth-rows is about the same as, rather than less than, the length of\r\nthe tympanic bulla. The postorbital breadth is greater than in\r\n_fallenda_ and the anterior edges of the tympanic bullae are flush with\r\nthe squamosals rather than projecting below the floor of braincase. In\r\nrelation to the skull as a whole the preorbital and interorbital parts\r\nare larger.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _streatori_, skulls of males are of about the same\r\nsize, _anguinae_ being only 9 per cent heavier. The length of the\r\ntooth-rows is ordinarily less than, rather than about equal to, the\r\nlength of the tympanic bulla; sagittal crest wanting rather than\r\npresent since in _anguinae_ the temporal muscles meet usually only at\r\nthe posterior end of the braincase instead of all along the midline on\r\nits top; tympanic bullae narrower and more nearly flush with squamosal\r\n(less protruded from braincase). Relative to the basilar length, the\r\nzygomatic breadth is more, the tympanic bullae are narrower, and the\r\nbraincase is deeper at the anterior end of the basioccipital. The\r\nfemale is 41 per cent heavier than _streatori_, there being no overlap\r\nin most cranial and dental measurements. M1, however, is approximately\r\nthe same size in each subspecies. The tooth-rows and tympanic bulla are\r\nof almost equal length whereas in _streatori_ the length of the\r\ntooth-rows is less than that of the bulla.\r\n\r\nDifferences from _olympica_, in males, are: M1 shorter; all other\r\nmeasurements of teeth and parts of skull averaging larger; skull 20 per\r\ncent heavier; tooth-rows averaging shorter than tympanic bulla rather\r\nthan about the same; relative to basilar length, braincase deeper at\r\nanterior end of basioccipital and tooth-rows shorter. The skull of the\r\nfemale is 64 per cent heavier, larger in every measurement taken\r\nwithout overlap; temporal ridges meeting, rather than separated, at\r\nlambdoidal crest; length of tooth-rows about equal to, rather than\r\nshorter than, tympanic bulla; in relation to basilar length, skull\r\ndeeper, orbitonasal length more, mastoid and zygomatic breadths more,\r\nand tympanic bullae shorter.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--References in the literature to this insular race mostly\r\nwere under the name _streatori_ until 1932 when in the course of the\r\npresent study the name _anguinae_ was proposed. A few specimens have\r\nbeen taken by nearly every student of small mammals who has collected\r\non Vancouver Island. Arthur Peake and Herbert Laing have probably\r\ncollected more specimens than any other two zoölogists.\r\n\r\n_M. c. anguinae_ is noteworthy for the slight secondary sexual\r\nvariation in size; the disparity between the two sexes is less than in\r\nany other American subspecies of _erminea_. By linear measurement the\r\nbody of the female is only 7 per cent shorter than in the male (178\r\nversus 191 mm.). Linear measurements and weights of the skulls of the\r\ntwo sexes are further indicative of this approximation in size. By\r\nweight the skull of the female is only a fourth lighter than that of\r\nthe male, or, stated in another way, the male's skull is only a third\r\nheavier (1.2 versus 0.9 grams).\r\n\r\nNo geographic variation has been detected between lots of specimens\r\nfrom different parts of Vancouver Island. The one specimen available\r\nfrom Salt Spring Island presents no obvious differences from selected\r\nindividuals from Vancouver Island.\r\n\r\nThe winter pelage is more often brown than white. Of 17 specimens seen\r\nin winter pelage or in transition pelage, only 6 are white. These 6 are\r\nfrom Comox, Stamp River, Hilliers, Jeune Landing and Port Alice. Of the\r\n34 specimens in brown pelage, 7 have the dark color of the upper parts\r\nmeeting on the abdomen. Six of the 34 have brown color on the pectoral\r\nregion. In two, this is a separate patch but in the other four the dark\r\ncolor is a continuation of the upper parts and extends in front of each\r\nforeleg over part of the pectoral region, but the two extensions, one\r\nfrom either side, do not meet on the underparts. The color of the lips\r\nwas recorded in 22 individuals: one had both the upper and lower-lips\r\nwhite; 7 had the upper lips brown and the lower lips white; in 14 both\r\nthe upper and lower-lips were brown.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 40, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south as follows.

A\r\n     male topotype of unknown age weighed 113 grams.\r\n\r\n     Female: Two adult topotypes, with actual measurements in\r\n     parentheses, average as follows: Total length, 232 (228-236);\r\n     length of tail, 60 (57-62); length of hind foot, 27 (27-27). An\r\n     adult from Morovitz Guard Station, Wash., weighed 54 grams.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Winter pelage rarely white, brown pelage\r\n     indistinguishable from summer pelage except for slightly more\r\n     smoky tinge in winter in specimens from some localities; otherwise\r\n     as described in _Mustela erminea streatori_ except that least\r\n     width of color of underparts averaging, in seven adult topotypes,\r\n     18 (0-37) per cent of greatest width of color of upper parts.\r\n     Black tip of tail averaging, in same series, 45 (38-52) mm. which\r\n     is 58 (53-65) per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     In comparison with _richardsonii_ and _invicta_, _fallenda_\r\n     differs in darker color of upper parts and their extension at the\r\n     expense of the light-colored underparts which are narrower by a\r\n     half. In correlation with this restriction in area of the\r\n     light-colored underparts, the upper lips are brown instead of\r\n     white. In comparison with _anguinae_, _olympica_ and _streatori_,\r\n     the longer black tip on the tail is the principal difference in\r\n     color. From _gulosa_, _fallenda_ differs in slightly darker color\r\n     of upper parts and in narrow underparts, the width of the same\r\n     being only about a fifth instead of a third of the width of the\r\n     dark-colored upper parts.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (based on 7 adults): See measurements and plates\r\n     5-7. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 1.5 (1.3-1.7) grams; basilar length, 35.7 (34.3-38.2).\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 6 ads.): See measurements and plates 11-13. As\r\n     described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight,\r\n     0.85 (0.73-1.0) grams; basilar length, 30.6 (29.4-31.7); breadth\r\n     of rostrum more than 30 per cent of basilar length.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _richardsonii_, skulls of males differ as follows:\r\naveraging smaller in every measurement taken with no overlap in several\r\ndimensions; 40 per cent lighter; in relation to basilar length, rostrum\r\n(orbitonasal length) longer and skull slightly broader interorbitally.\r\nFemales average smaller in every cranial and dental measurement taken\r\nwith no overlap in basilar length, length of tooth-rows and length of\r\ntympanic bulla; 22 per cent lighter; breadth of rostrum more, rather\r\nthan less, than 30 per cent of basilar length; in relation to basilar\r\nlength, pre-and interorbital parts of skull larger, and mastoid breadth\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nDifferences from males of _olympica_ are: size larger with no overlap\r\nin most measurements; 50 per cent heavier; tympanic bullae longer than\r\nupper tooth-rows rather than of about equal length; in relation to\r\nbasilar length, rostrum shorter, braincase wider and deeper, zygomata\r\nmore expanded. Females are larger with no overlap in most measurements;\r\n35 per cent heavier; in relation to basilar length, pre-and\r\ninterorbital regions narrower, braincase deeper and wider across\r\nmastoids.\r\n\r\nDifferences from _streatori_, in males, are: skull averaging larger in\r\nevery cranial and dental measurement taken; 36 per cent heavier;\r\ntympanic bulla longer than, instead of about same length as,\r\nupper tooth-rows. In females the inner lobe of M1 is shorter\r\nanteroposteriorly; otherwise all measurements of _fallenda_ average\r\nlarger and it is 33 per cent heavier; rostrum and interorbital region\r\nbroader in relation to remainder of skull.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _gulosa_, skulls of males differ as follows:\r\naveraging larger in every measurement taken with no overlap in several\r\ndimensions; 50 per cent heavier; tympanic bullae with anterior margins\r\nprojecting slightly below squamosals rather than flush with same;\r\nlength of bulla more than, rather than about same as, that of upper\r\ntooth-rows. Considering the great difference in size, the relative\r\nproportions are remarkably alike. In females, length of inner lobe of\r\nM1 about the same; otherwise averaging larger in every measurement\r\ntaken; 44 per cent lighter; relative to basilar length, tooth-rows\r\nlonger, skull wider across zygomata and mastoids, rostrum and\r\ninterorbital regions slightly narrower, skull shallower in plane of\r\nlast upper molars.\r\n\r\nComparisons with _haidarum_, _invicta_ and _anguinae_ are made in\r\naccounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Until the name _fallenda_ was proposed in the course of the\r\npresent study, most of the specimens of this race were assigned to\r\n_streatori_.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _streatori_ is complete as it is also with\r\n_invicta_ and _richardsonii_, in other words with each of the\r\nsubspecies whose ranges meet that of _fallenda_. In color and in size\r\nthe difference is least between _streatori_ and _fallenda_. As between\r\n_fallenda_ and _invicta_ the size is not greatly different and the\r\nintergradation in color is gradual. Between _fallenda_ and\r\n_richardsonii_ intergradation is somewhat different and to fully\r\nappreciate its nature we should remember that the color of _fallenda_\r\nresembles that of the saturate coastal races, _streatori_, _anguinae_\r\nand _olympica_ although the black tip of the tail is longer. In this\r\nlatter feature and in several cranial details, as well as in greater\r\ndegree of secondary sexual variation in size, _fallenda_ resembles\r\n_richardsonii_. Because the two differ more than do most subspecies of\r\nermine whose ranges meet, some of the intergrades at first inspection\r\nappear to be widely different from either parent stock. For example,\r\nspecimens from Alta Lake, British Columbia, may give this impression\r\nbecause the combination of large size and dark color suggests a kind of\r\nermine different from either _fallenda_ or _richardsonii_. In no\r\ninstance, however, has there been found in these intergrades any\r\ncharacter other than those occurring in one or the other of the two\r\nparent races.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast in the north part of the geographic range assigned to\r\n_fallenda_, some specimens nearly typical of _richardsonii_ have been\r\ntaken so near to the place where fairly typical _fallenda_ was\r\nobtained that I have doubted whether there is intergradation in the\r\nusual fashion in this area; more specimens will have to be obtained\r\nfrom this coastal area to resolve the doubt one way or the other.\r\n\r\nThe winter pelage is brown in all specimens at most localities. The\r\nonly white pelage seen was in each of three specimens from Glacier,\r\nWhatcom County, Washington. A fourth specimen from there is in brown\r\nwinter pelage. At any one locality there is much variation in the\r\ndegree to which the dark color of the upper parts encroaches on the\r\narea that in most other races is light-colored. An extreme degree of\r\nencroachment is shown by a specimen taken on December 1, 1935, by R. A.\r\nCummings, at Vancouver, British Columbia, in which the light color\r\noccurs only in three restricted areas, the chin, the throat and the\r\nlower breast; otherwise the coat is brown. There are other specimens,\r\nfor instance from the type locality, which differ mainly in having an\r\nadditional white spot in the inguinal region. The opposite extreme, in\r\na specimen also from the type locality, is where the least width of the\r\nlight-colored underparts on the abdominal region is a third of the\r\ncircumference of the body. The two extremes are connected by a dozen\r\nintermediate stages. Of 64 specimens in which the color of the lips was\r\ncarefully examined, one, from Vancouver, has both the upper and\r\nlower-lips brown; 9 have both the upper and lower-lips white; and 54\r\nhave the upper lips brown and the lower lips white.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 72, arranged by localities\r\n     from north to south.

An adult weighs 30\r\n     grams.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela erminea streatori_ except that\r\n     least width of color of underparts averaging, in 12 males of adult\r\n     proportions, 5 (0-11) per cent of greatest width of color of upper\r\n     parts.

As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 1.0 (0.9-1.1) grams; basilar length, 31.8 (30.6-32.5);\r\n     length of tooth-rows more or less than (about equal to) length of\r\n     tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\n     Female (illustrated by 3 adults): See measurements and plates\r\n     12-14. As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 0.55 (0.52-0.58) grams; basilar length, 27.1 (26.7-27.5);\r\n     breadth of rostrum more than 30 per cent of basilar length.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _streatori_, skulls of corresponding sex average\r\nsmaller in every measurement taken with no overlap in most of those of\r\nfemales. Exception is to be made for the inner lobe of M1 in males\r\nwhere the size is the same. By weight males are smaller by 10 per cent\r\nand females by 14 per cent. In relation to other parts of the skull the\r\ntympanic bullae are narrower and in females they are shorter as well.\r\nComparison with _anguinae_ and _fallenda_ has been made in the accounts\r\nof those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The smaller size, especially of females, is the principal\r\nfeature distinguishing this race from _streatori_. On the basis of\r\navailable data the female of _olympica_ is smaller than that of any\r\nother race and hence is the smallest adult weasel of the species\r\n_erminea_, in either the Old World or in America.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _streatori_ is indicated by specimens from the\r\nsouthern end of Puget Sound. These specimens are intermediate in size\r\nbetween typical examples of the two races concerned.\r\n\r\nThe color of the upper parts is uniform and the color pattern varies\r\nless than in geographically adjoining races. The white color of the\r\nunderparts is restricted to a thin line on the abdominal region, but\r\nwidens out posteriorly in the inguinal region and anteriorly over the\r\npectoral region, throat, chin and lower lips. The upper lips are brown.\r\nThe brown of the upper parts extends around in front of each foreleg,\r\nthe two brown areas not quite meeting on the lower throat. The above\r\ndescription applies to each of the 19 specimens examined with regard to\r\nthese details. Every specimen seen in the winter coat was brown, not\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 20, arranged by counties from\r\n     north to south.

As\r\n     described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except that: Weight,\r\n     0.64 (0.60-0.67) grams; basilar length, 28.5 (27.6-29.5); breadth\r\n     of rostrum more than 30 per cent of basilar length.\r\n\r\nComparison with _anguinae_, _fallenda_, _olympica_, _gulosa_ and\r\n_muricus_ is made in accounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This weasel is rare in collections and the best material of\r\nit was obtained by Alex Walker in Tillamook County, Oregon, where he\r\nresides. The almost ideal series of 30 specimens showed the range of\r\nsecondary sexual, age, and individual variation expectable in the small\r\nermines of the Pacific Coast of the United States and was the means of\r\nallowing satisfactory decision on questions of classification in the\r\nrelated subspecies in which individuals are of comparable size.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with each of the geographically adjoining subspecies,\r\n_olympica_, _fallenda_, _invicta_, _gulosa_ and _muricus_ is shown by\r\nspecimens examined. With the last mentioned subspecies, intergradation\r\nis shown by two specimens from as far south as Siskiyou County,\r\nCalifornia, assigned to _muricus_.\r\n\r\nThe application of the name _streatori_ is difficult because it was\r\nbased on a specimen from a place where two clines cross. The\r\nnorth-south cline is one of size which decreases to the south. The\r\neast-west cline is one of intensity of color, the westernmost (coastal)\r\npopulation being the most intensely colored. The type locality of\r\n_streatori_ is at the place where two lines perpendicular to one\r\nanother, and representing the two clines, cross. This intersection is\r\nnear the place where the ranges of several subspecies meet. The\r\nnomenclatural question is, to which one of 6 subspecies should the name\r\n_streatori_ apply. Specimens from barely within the geographic\r\nboundaries of four of these subspecies so closely resemble topotypes of\r\n_streatori_ that a student with material at his disposal from only the\r\narea about Puget Sound naturally would apply the name _streatori_ to\r\nall of his specimens, and knowing even of the arrangement adopted in\r\nthe present account the student will have difficulty in identifying his\r\nspecimens according to it. Not only will the student find the\r\narrangement difficult, but probably unsatisfactory if he thinks of\r\n_streatori_ as being the kind of animal represented by topotypes. I\r\nconceive of topotypes of _streatori_ as being nontypical of the\r\nsubspecies; they are intergrades with _fallenda_. My aim was initially\r\nto work out the geographic ranges of subspecies and only subsequently\r\nto apply names, according to which type localities fell within the\r\npreviously determined geographic ranges. By this procedure no greater\r\nweight was given to a holotype and to topotypes than to specimens from\r\nany other locality.\r\n\r\nOf the 40 specimens seen in winter pelage, only one is white. It is\r\nfrom Darrington in the Cascade Mountains of Washington. The 39 others\r\nare brown and I doubt that the white pelage ever occurs in the low\r\ncoastal territory included within the geographic range of _streatori_.\r\nThis subspecies resembles _anguinae_ and _olympica_ in the great\r\nextension of area of the dark-colored upper parts at the expense of the\r\narea of the light-colored underparts. The usual arrangement is one\r\nwhere the brown of the two sides nearly meets on the midventral line\r\nleaving a sizable, inguinal area of light color connected by a thin\r\nline to the sizable area of light color on the pectoral region. The\r\nlight color of the pectoral area ordinarily is continuous with the\r\nlight-colored area of the throat and chin but the dark color of the\r\nupper parts extends around in front of each foreleg. These extensions\r\nof dark color meet on the chest in only 2 of the 56 specimens examined\r\nin this regard. Across the abdomen the dark color is continuous in 4 of\r\nthe 56 specimens. The lower lips are brown instead of white in only 3\r\nindividuals and in 2 of these the lip of one side is brown and its\r\nopposite is white. The variation in color-pattern is less than in\r\n_anguinae_ or than in _fallenda_.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 63, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states, then by counties from north to south in each state.\r\n     Unless otherwise indicated, specimens are in the U.

In view of these circumstances and because the\r\nanimals can not well be included in the subspecies _streatori_ or\r\n_muricus_, _gulosa_ is recognized as distinct. The races _gulosa_ and\r\n_olympica_ are what might be termed weakly differentiated subspecies in\r\ncontrast to the strongly differentiated subspecies _streatori_ and\r\n_muricus_.\r\n\r\nOf the 21 specimens in winter pelage, 17 are white and four are brown.\r\nThe brown winter coat is distinctly paler, with more of a smoky tinge,\r\nthan the brown summer pelage. The light-colored underparts are narrower\r\nthan in the subspecies immediately to the east but are wider than in\r\nthe coastal forms to the west. The dark color of the upper parts\r\nextends onto the chest in front of the forelegs, as in the coastal\r\nforms, in only one of the 13 specimens in summer pelage and in it on\r\none side only. The black tip of the tail is short as in the coastal\r\nforms. One specimen is in transitional pelage. It has acquired\r\napproximately half of the white winter pelage and was taken on October\r\n12, 1897, at Keechelus Lake.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 38, arranged by counties from\r\n     north to south.

A subadult from 9-1/2 mi. E Pocatello, Idaho, measures: 197,\r\n     50, 25. An adult from Wheeler Peak, Nevada, has corresponding\r\n     measurements of 190, 42, 23, and weighs 33.8 grams.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela erminea richardsonii_ except\r\n     that upper parts tone 2 or lighter of Chocolate of plate 343 of\r\n     Oberthür and Dauthenay; underparts white, Pale Buff or with faint\r\n     wash of Sulphur Yellow; least width of color of underparts in male\r\n     from Black Butte and one from Wheeler Peak, amounting to 65 and 59\r\n     per cent of greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of\r\n     tail, respectively, 28 and 33 mm., which amounts to 51 and 59 per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae. In two adult females, one from\r\n     Teton County, Wyoming, and one from Wheeler Peak, Nevada, the\r\n     least width of the underparts amounts to 55 and 60 per cent of the\r\n     greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail,\r\n     respectively, 23 and 19 mm., which amounts to 44 and 45 per cent\r\n     of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     From the other subspecies of small-sized weasels of more\r\n     northwestern occurrence, namely _anguinae_, _fallenda_,\r\n     _olympica_, _streatori_ and _gulosa_, _muricus_ differs in lighter\r\n     color of upper parts, wider light-colored underparts and\r\n     relatively longer black tip of tail.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Male (illustrated by 5 adults in table of measurements,\r\n     which see): See plate 7. As described in _Mustela erminea\r\n     richardsonii_ except that: Weight, 0.78 (Wheeler Peak) and 0.85\r\n     (Black Butte) grams; basilar length, 30.6 (29.8-31.2); length of\r\n     tooth-rows more or less than (approximately equal to) length of\r\n     tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\n     Female (illustrated by 6 adults in table of measurements, which\r\n     see): See plates 12-14. As described in _Mustela erminea\r\n     richardsonii_ except that: Weight, 0.60 (0.575-0.645); basilar\r\n     length, 28.0 (27.3-29.4); breadth of rostrum approximately 30 per\r\n     cent of basilar length.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _streatori_, males average smaller in every\r\nmeasurement taken with no overlap in most dimensions; 25 per cent\r\nlighter; anterior margin of tympanic bulla more nearly flush with\r\nsquamosal, that is to say less protruded from braincase; in relation to\r\nother dimensions of skull, braincase shallower anteriorly (at plane of\r\nlast molars) and deeper posteriorly (at anterior end of basioccipital).\r\nFemales average smaller in every measurement taken except mastoid and\r\nzygomatic breadths which are actually more; 6 per cent lighter; in\r\nrelation to other parts of skull, preorbital and interorbital parts\r\nslightly smaller; in relation to length of skull, braincase shallower.\r\nComparison with _invicta_ and _gulosa_ is made in the accounts of those\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The smallest males of the entire species are of this\r\nsubspecies and the females of it are barely larger than those of\r\n_olympica_ and _gulosa_ and hence are among the three smallest. The\r\nmaterial now available consists only of one or a few specimens from\r\neach of several widely separated localities. If as many specimens per\r\nunit area were available as there are of the species _M. erminea_ from\r\nsouthern British Columbia, geographic variation warranting the division\r\nof _muricus_ into more than one subspecies might be revealed. Evidence\r\npointing in this direction is comprised in the pale color and small\r\nsize of the pair of adults from Wheeler Peak on the eastern border of\r\nNevada; the suggestion is that there is a distinct pale race of small\r\nindividuals in the isolated spots of boreal life-zone in the mountains\r\nof the desert. The color and size of the specimens from the Toyabe\r\nMountains, and that from the Pine Forest Mountains, both places also in\r\nNevada, nevertheless, lend no support to this suggestion. Comparison of\r\nspecimens from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado with those from the\r\nSierra Nevada of California gives no basis for recognizing more than\r\none subspecies. Therefore, _Putorius streatori leptus_ Merriam with\r\ntype locality at Silverton, San Juan County, Colorado, falls as a\r\nsynonym of the earlier named _Putorius (Arctogale) muricus_ Bangs with\r\ntype locality at Echo, El Dorado County, California. Furthermore,\r\nspecimens from northern New Mexico, the southernmost known area of\r\noccurrence for the subspecies (and for the species), are as large as\r\nspecimens from far north in the range of the subspecies, say, in\r\nnorthwestern Wyoming; there is therefore no evidence of progressive\r\ndecrease in size to the southward as in advance of study I supposed\r\nexisted in _muricus_. This erroneous supposition was held because I\r\nknew that there was a decrease in size to the southward in the species\r\nas a whole and also in each of the subspecies _richardsonii_ and\r\n_invicta_ directly to the north of _muricus_.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _invicta_ is shown by specimens from southwestern\r\nMontana. Where the margins of the geographic ranges of _invicta_ and\r\n_muricus_ approach one another elsewhere, low-lying territory, zonally\r\nunsuited to the existence of the species, occurs along the Snake and\r\nColumbia rivers, and precludes any chance of intergradation except\r\naround the head of the Snake River Plains. Two specimens, here referred\r\nto _muricus_, from Siskiyou County, California, in both color and\r\ncranial characters, are intergrades with _streatori_ and might be\r\nreferred with almost equal propriety to _streatori_.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 52, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states, then by counties from north to south within each state.\r\n     Unless otherwise indicated, specimens are in the Museum of\r\n     Vertebrate Zoölogy, University of California at Berkeley.\r\n\r\n     =California.= _Siskiyou County_: head of Rush Creek, 6400 ft., 1;\r\n     Castle Lake, 5434 ft., 1. _Tehama County_: 2 mi.

Upon comparing these\r\nwith each sex of the three species of American Recent weasels,\r\n_frenata_, _erminea_ and _rixosa_, it is seen that size, and to some\r\ndegree shape, rule out of consideration both sexes of _rixosa_ and also\r\nmales of _frenata_. Thus we are left with females of _frenata_ and\r\nmales and females of _erminea_. So far as size is concerned, it can be\r\nassumed that the larger specimens are females of _frenata_ and that the\r\nsmaller are males of _erminea_. This assumption has in its favor also,\r\nthe fact that the postglenoidal length of the skull accords with that\r\nin Recent specimens. The difference in this regard in Recent animals is\r\nthat the postglenoidal length of the skull, expressed as a percentage\r\nof the total (condylobasal) length of the skull, amounts to:\r\n\r\n          in _frenata_             in _erminea_\r\n  [M] ordinarily less than 46   [M] ordinarily more than 46\r\n  [F] less than 47              [F] more than 48\r\n\r\nIn the fossils the percentage for the larger skulls is 46; for the\r\nsmaller skulls it is 48.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the ten fossil skulls are six female _frenata_ and four\r\nmale _erminea_ but I think not. In the first place a skull of different\r\nshape, seemingly of the _frenata_ stock, is known from the deposit and\r\nit is almost certain that two subspecies of the same species would not\r\noccur at the same place at the same time. It is possible, of course,\r\nthat parts of the deposits were laid down at times so far apart that a\r\nshift in geographic range of two subspecies had occurred. This one\r\nskull, seemingly of the _frenata_ stock, is the type of _Putorius\r\ngracilis_ Brown (see p. 404) and was regarded as the only known\r\nspecimen of _gracilis_. Regardless of the specific identity of this one\r\nspecimen named _gracilis_, the chances of obtaining otherwise from a\r\ndeposit, like that in Conard Fissure, six females of frenata and four\r\nmales of _erminea_ without a male _frenata_ or a female of _erminea_\r\ncoming to light are so slight as strongly to incline me to the view\r\nthat the six larger specimens are males of the same species to which\r\nthe 4 smaller specimens belong. By either this interpretation, or the\r\none initially considered (of female _frenata_ and male _erminea_), the\r\nanimals from the fissure are at least subspecifically distinct from any\r\nAmerican Recent weasel. Furthermore, by this latter interpretation each\r\nsex of this weasel, _angustidens_, is intermediate between the\r\n_frenata_ and _erminea_ stocks in the feature of postglenoidal length\r\nwhich feature, at any place where the two Recent species occur\r\ntogether, serves to distinguish one from the other. In the northernmost\r\nsubspecies of _erminea_ (_arctica_ for example) the postglenoidal\r\nlength in some males is no longer than in males of _frenata_.\r\nConsidering general size, _angustidens_ agrees better with _erminea_\r\nthan with frenata and this circumstance has influenced me to place\r\n_angustidens_ as a subspecies of _erminea_.\r\n\r\nToday, _erminea_ is not known to occur nearer Conard Fissure than\r\nnorthern Iowa, more than 400 miles to the northward. In comparison with\r\nthe race there, _bangsi_, males of _angustidens_ are of approximately\r\nthe same size but in the shorter distance between the glenoid fossa and\r\nanterior margin of the tympanic bulla, and also in the lesser\r\npostglenoidal length of the skull, _angustidens_ resembles the\r\nnorthernmost American subspecies of _erminea_. Females of _angustidens_\r\ndiffer more from any living weasel than the males do. The females are\r\nmuch larger than those of _bangsi_, and among living American races of\r\n_erminea_ most closely resemble intergrades between _arctica_ and\r\n_richardsonii_ which intergrades are found approximately 1700 miles to\r\nthe north of Conard Fissure. In females, the preorbital part of the\r\nskull in _M. e. arctica_ is broader and in _M. e. richardsonii_\r\nnarrower than in _angustidens_. If it seems strange that females of\r\n_angustidens_ resemble one subspecies whereas males, in size, resemble\r\nanother subspecies almost a thousand miles distant, it should be\r\nremembered that the degree of sexual dimorphism varies much from one\r\nsubspecies to another in the Recent animals. An example is furnished by\r\n_Mustela erminea fallenda_ and _Mustela erminea invicta_.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of mammals from Conard Fissure includes several species\r\nof boreal predilections which, like _Mustela erminea_, now occur only\r\nmuch farther north than Arkansas. At one time the edge of the sheet of\r\nice was only about 200 miles north of Arkansas. It may be significant\r\nthat the cranial characters of the female ermine from the Fissure, and\r\nqualitative cranial characters of males from there, are most nearly\r\napproximated among Recent weasels by those which live along the\r\nsouthern edge of the frozen tundra.\r\n\r\nIn view of what has been said, the possibility should be considered\r\nthat the distinctive cranial features of _angustidens_ may be the\r\nresult of evolutionary change in time as well as of geographic\r\nvariation resulting from horizontal placement.\r\n\r\n\r\n=MUSTELA RIXOSA= (Bangs)\r\n\r\nLeast Weasel\r\n\r\n(Synonymy under subspecies)\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Type._--_Putorius rixosus_ Bangs, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,\r\n     10:21, February 25, 1896.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--From Norway and Switzerland eastward through Siberia and\r\n     all the way across North America, but unknown from Iceland,\r\n     Greenland and the Arctic islands west of Greenland; in North\r\n     America, from the Arctic Life-zone south to Central British\r\n     Columbia, Montana and into parts of the Upper Austral Life-zone as\r\n     in the eastern half of the continent.\r\n\r\n     The southern extension of range in the Appalachians (to North\r\n     Carolina) is not duplicated in the Rocky Mountains of western\r\n     North America probably because the region there suitable for\r\n     _rixosa_ south of Central British Columbia and Montana is occupied\r\n     by the almost equally small _Mustela erminea muricus_ and related\r\n     subspecies which seem to fill the ecological role that _rixosa_\r\n     plays where it occurs. The small size of females of _M. erminea\r\n     cicognanii_ in New England may similarly account for the absence\r\n     of _rixosa_ there.\r\n\r\n_Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from both _Mustela\r\nerminea_ and _Mustela frenata_ by tail a fourth or less of length of\r\nhead and body and without a black tip (at most a few black hairs at\r\nextreme tip in rixosa), and from _M. frenata_ and from _M. erminea_ in\r\nregions where it and _rixosa_ occur together, by basilar length of\r\nskull less than 32.5 in males and less than 31.0 in females.\r\n\r\n_Characters of the species._--Size small: Total length less than 250 in\r\nmales and 225 in females; tail a fourth or less of length of head and\r\nbody, and without a black pencil and at most with a few black hairs at\r\nextreme tip; caudal vertebrae 11 to 16, normally 15 in _M. r. rixosa_,\r\nand 11 in one _M. r. eskimo_ examined; skull with long braincase and\r\nshort precranial portion, thus essentially same shape as in _M.\r\nerminea_ but the largest males of _M. rixosa_ always with a lesser\r\nbasilar length that even the smallest females of _M. erminea_ or _M.\r\nfrenata_ of the same geographic area. In fact no specimens of _M.\r\nfrenata_ have skulls so small as the largest _M. rixosa_, and skulls of\r\nequal size of _M. erminea_ and _M. rixosa_, for example, _M. erminea\r\nmuricus_ of Colorado and _M. rixosa eskimo_ of Alaska, differ in that\r\nwhen the skulls are viewed from directly above those of _rixosa_ have\r\nthe mastoid processes more prominent, or the braincase is higher in\r\nrelation to its width or both differences together prevail. Stated in\r\nanother way, comparison of skulls of equal size of _rixosa_ and\r\n_erminea_ shows that in the latter the braincase is more nearly flat\r\nand is wider above and in front of the mastoid processes; therefore,\r\nthe greatest breadth of the braincase equals or exceeds the mastoid\r\nbreadth, whereas the reverse is ordinarily true of _rixosa_.\r\n\r\n_Geographic variation._--In the Old World four subspecies are currently\r\nrecognized (see Allen, 1933:316) and the same number is here recognized\r\nin North America. Length of the tail, length of head and body and hind\r\nfoot, breadth of the rostral part of the skull in relation to its\r\nlength, and position on the side of the head of the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the dark color of the upper parts and the white underparts, are\r\nthe features in which geographic variation has been detected. The\r\ngeneral impression is that the amount of geographic variation is much\r\nless than in _Mustela frenata_ and only slightly less than in _Mustela\r\nerminea_ of the same geographic area.\r\n\r\n_Nomenclature._--It is exceptional for a species which occurs in both\r\nthe Old-and New-World to take its specific name from New World\r\nmaterial, especially if the name was proposed as recently as 1896; most\r\ncircumboreal species take their names from descriptions of European\r\nspecimens. Although the least weasel, _Mustela rixosa_ (Bangs) 1896,\r\nseems now to be an exception, it may yet turn out that the first\r\navailable name was based on European material. Zimmermann (1943) shows\r\nthat the least weasel actually was named on the basis of European\r\nmaterial long before 1896 and concludes that the name _Putorius\r\nminutus_ Pomel, 1853, based on a specimen from France, is the first\r\navailable name.\r\n\r\nBecause _Putorius_ nowadays is relegated to subgeneric rank under the\r\ngeneric name _Mustela_, we have for consideration the name-combination\r\n_Mustela minuta_ (Pomel). Unfortunately for Zimmermann's conclusion,\r\n_Mustela minuta_ Pomel is not available because it is preoccupied by\r\n_Mustela minuta_ Gervais [= _Palaeogale minuta_ (Gervais),\r\n1848-1852--see Simpson, 1946: 2, 12], a name applied to another species\r\nof small mustelid from the Oligocene or lower Miocene deposits of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nSome other early names thought by Zimmermann (1943:290) to have been\r\nbased on the dwarf weasel of Europe are judged to be _nomina nuda_ and\r\ntherefore are to be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe name _Mustela minor_ Nilsson 1820 was thought by Miller (1912:402)\r\nto be a renaming, and hence a synonym, of _Mustela nivalis_ Linnaeus.\r\nIf that is the case the name does not apply to the dwarf weasel. If the\r\nname _Mustela minor_ Nilsson was instead based on the dwarf weasel, the\r\nname might still be unavailable, depending on rulings on secondary\r\nhomonyms, because the name might be preoccupied by _[Lutra] minor_\r\nErxleben 1777 which is a synonym of _[Mustela] lutreola_ Linnaeus 1766.\r\nTwo names seemingly available for weasels, and in use for them today,\r\nwhich might replace _rixosa_ as the name of the species, are, first,\r\n_Mustela boccamela_ Bechstein, 1801, of Sardinia [= _Mustela nivalis\r\nboccamela_ of Miller, 1912, 405] and second, _Putorius numidicus_\r\nPucheran, 1855, of Morocco and Algeria [= _Mustela numidica_ of Allen,\r\nG. M., 1939, 183]. As they stand in the current literature, _Mustela\r\nnumidica_ is a species distinct from the dwarf weasel and the other\r\nname, _Mustela nivalis boccamela_, is an insular subspecies of the\r\nmouse weasel. Zimmermann (1943:292), however, implies that _M.\r\nnumidica_ may belong to the dwarf weasel group when he says \"Ob auch\r\n_iberica_ BARR.-HAM. als Unterart zu _minuta_ POM. zu stellen ist, soll\r\nhier nicht untersucht werden, ebensowenig die von CABRERA vermutete\r\nZugehörigkeit der grossen nordafrikanischen _M. numidica_ PUCH. zur\r\n'_iberica_-Gruppe'.\" The answer to this problem requires a taxonomic,\r\nrather than a nomenclatural, decision. Whether either _M. numidica_ or\r\n_M. boccamela_ are conspecific with the dwarf weasel I cannot at this\r\ntime ascertain for want of adequate specimens. Because these two names,\r\n_M. boccamela_, and _M. numidica_, are assigned to kinds of weasels\r\nwhich are currently regarded as specifically distinct from the dwarf\r\nweasel, and because all the other names which certainly have been\r\nassigned to Old World populations of the dwarf weasel before 1896, so\r\nfar as I know, are _nomina nuda_ or are preoccupied, the next available\r\nname, _Mustela rixosa_ (Bangs, 1896), is here employed.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This species may have a wider geographic range in\r\nnortheastern North America than is now known. Strong (1930:7) writes\r\nthat the Naskapi Indians of the interior country of Labrador between\r\nHamilton Inlet and Ungava Bay \"have only one name for weasel,\r\n_mé-tah-kwut_, but they say there are three kinds in their territory, a\r\nlarge, an intermediate, and a very small weasel. The latter suggests\r\nthe least weasel . . . which has not been recorded from northern\r\nLabrador.\"\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the range of the species, the winter pelage is\r\nwhite and the summer pelage is brown. In the southern part of the\r\nrange, that is in the range of the subspecies _allegheniensis_, the\r\nwinter pelage is either brown or white and the time of the molt into\r\nwinter pelage is irregular; each of eleven individuals from\r\nPennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, taken in December, January, February\r\nand March is mostly white but retains some considerable part of the\r\nbrown pelage of the previous coat on top of the head and usually also\r\nalong the midline of the entire dorsum. These eleven animals include\r\nindividuals of each sex. Of each sex, some are adults and some are\r\nsubadults. Therefore, the delayed or incomplete fall molt, at present,\r\ncannot be correlated with either sex or with any particular age. No\r\nwild-taken specimens of _M. erminea_ or of _M. frenata_ of the same\r\nregion show this delayed or incomplete molt.\r\n\r\nPossibly this delay or incompleteness of molt is the result of the same\r\ncause that lies behind the birth of some _M. rixosa_ in midwinter. As\r\nlisted below, several litters of young have been found in midwinter. In\r\nfact it appears that in the United States, young may be born in every\r\nmonth of the year although, according to existing information, more\r\nlitters are produced in spring and in winter than in summer and autumn.\r\nMany juveniles and young of _allegheniensis_ examined in study\r\ncollections clearly were born in spring but about as many seem to have\r\nbeen born in midwinter as at any other time (in the light of present\r\nknowledge) and this is in contrast to what we know of the two other\r\nspecies of American weasels since their young, so far as known, are\r\nborn in spring.\r\n\r\nOne instance is worthy of detailed comment. An adult female, no. 783\r\nOhio State Museum, taken on January 31, 1931, at Vinton, Meigs County,\r\nOhio, bears the following notation on the attached label \"nest plowed\r\nout of ground. Very small young escaped--marked like parent. [F] was\r\nnursing.\" The enlarged mammae on the dried skin substantiate the\r\nstatement that the female was nursing young. She has a brown mask\r\ncontinuous from one ear through the eye, across the forehead and\r\nthrough the other eye to the opposite ear. On each side of the body a\r\nstripe of brown 5 to 10 mm. wide extends from the upper part of the\r\nforeleg back to the thigh and base of the tail, uniting there with its\r\nopposite and covering the tail. There are a few spots of brown on the\r\nshoulders, and rump and one on the middle of the back. Otherwise the\r\nspecimen is white. One implication of the statement on the label that\r\nthe young which escaped were marked like the parent (presumably this\r\nfemale parent) is that this female is a partial albino. I am more\r\ninclined, however, to the view that there was an unseasonable activity\r\nof the particular glands of internal secretion the hormones of which\r\npromote embryonic growth and that these glands, or others controlled\r\nby them, were in some way responsible for an abnormal progress of molt,\r\nor for a reversal of molt in that one molt began before the previous\r\nmolt had been completed.\r\n\r\nExcepting this one specimen, no. 783 from Vinton, Ohio, all of those in\r\ntransitional pelage indicate that the direction of the molt pattern is\r\nthe same as in _M. frenata_ and _M. erminea_. That is to say, the\r\nautumnal molt begins on the midventral line and the molt in spring\r\nbegins on the mid-dorsal line. Furthermore, the normal progress of each\r\nmolt appears to follow the same pattern that has been described above\r\nfor _Mustela frenata_.\r\n\r\nA possible explanation of unseasonal molt in the southeastern area of\r\noccurrence of the species _Mustela rixosa_, and a possible explanation\r\nof the abnormal molt of the female from Vinton, Ohio, is that the\r\nspecies has only relatively recently invaded the area, and has had\r\ninsufficient time to adjust the physiology of its molting mechanism to\r\nthe longer periods of daylight that obtain later in autumn and earlier\r\nin spring than farther north. In the other two species of American\r\nweasels, the change in length of periods of light, it will be recalled,\r\nis known to indirectly control both molt and some changes in the sexual\r\ncycle. Wright (1942B:109) has shown that molt in spring precedes by one\r\nor two months the birth of young in _M. frenata_, that the two\r\nphenomena are correlated in a way that is statistically significant,\r\nand recognizes that progressively longer periods of daylight may be the\r\ncausal stimulus. The suggestion made above that _M. rixosa_ does not\r\nlive in New England or in the Rocky Mountains of the western United\r\nStates because each of the two areas already is inhabited by weasels of\r\nalmost equally small size, is in line with the idea that _rixosa_ is a\r\nrecent immigrant to America, or more precisely that _rixosa_ arrived\r\nlater than _erminea_.\r\n\r\n_Natural History._--Habitat and Numbers.--Soper (1946:136) recounts\r\nthat near the junction of the Antler and Souris rivers, Manitoba, this\r\nspecies occurs \"both in the river valleys and on the upper prairies,\"\r\nand later (1948:55), with reference to the Grand Prairie of the Peace\r\nRiver region of Alberta, writes that the least weasel \"inhabits both\r\nparklands and mixed wood forest environments.\"\r\n\r\nAt most times, wherever found, the least weasel is regarded as rare.\r\nNot only mammalogists regard it as rare and as a desirable catch, but\r\nIndians likewise value it, probably because of its rarity. For example,\r\nOsgood (1901:69-70), who caught a female least weasel at Tyonek,\r\nAlaska, writes that: \"The natives regard the capture of one of these\r\nrare animals as a piece of great good fortune. One old Indian who\r\nfrequently visited our cabin told us that his brother who had caught\r\none when a small boy had in consequence become a 'big chief'; and he\r\nassured me that since I had caught one I must surely be destined to\r\nbecome a man of great wealth and power.\"\r\n\r\nSwenk's (1926:313-330) account of the species in Clay County, Nebraska,\r\nshows, however, that the animal was far more abundant in 1916 and 1917\r\nthan subsequently and inferentially than it was before 1916. Clearest\r\nproof of multiannual fluctuation is provided by P. O. Fryklund's\r\n(Swanson and Fryklund, 1935:120-126) receipt of weasels from Roseau\r\nCounty, Minnesota. From 1895 to 1932 he had approximately equal\r\nopportunity to receive least weasels each year. Those which came to his\r\nattention were distributed by years as follows: 1895-1927, 7\r\nindividuals in all; winter of 1927-28, 3 individuals; winter of\r\n1928-29, 59 individuals; 1929-1930, 84 individuals; 1930-1935, 3\r\nindividuals. \"These records indicate a very definite increase in the\r\nabundance of least weasels in the Roseau region [in] the two years from\r\nthe autumn of 1928 to the spring of 1930. Mr. Fryklund has handled 166\r\nleast weasels in his 40 years in Roseau County, and of these, 143 were\r\ntaken in the two years mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nThe maximum home range of the least weasel is two acres and a weasel\r\nseldom travels farther than ten rods from its burrow according to\r\nPolderboer (1942:146) who, in the period December 20, 1939, to January\r\n2, 1940, studied four least weasels and one long-tailed weasel on a 144\r\nacre farm in Butler County, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehavior\r\n\r\nOf the voice, Llewellyn (1942:441) records that his captive specimen\r\ntaken in Virginia uttered a shrill shriek when seizing prey or when\r\nteased. When excessively annoyed the weasel also emitted musk.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell is used in hunting as was witnessed by George L.\r\nFordyce; he observed a least weasel following the scent of a\r\n_Peromyscus_ and saw the least weasel overtake and kill the mouse\r\n(Seton, 1929 (2):637).\r\n\r\nAt a nest in a clover stack, in Manitoba, Criddle (1947:69), on\r\nDecember 27, 1946, found the least weasel \"to have been rather remiss\r\nin its sanitary habits as its pile of dung was almost, or quite,\r\ntouching the nest and only just to the side of its entrance.\" There\r\nwere 117 voids.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemies\r\n\r\nThe great-horned owl, barn owl and long-tailed weasel are to be counted\r\nas enemies since Nelson (1934:252) found the fur, skull and other\r\nfragments of the skeleton of a least weasel in one of 26 pellets of the\r\ngreat-horned owl in Wisconsin; Handley (1949:431) found the skull and\r\nother skeletal remains of a least weasel in one of 22 pellets of the\r\nbarn owl in Virginia; and Polderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson (1941), in\r\nIowa, found the remains of a least weasel in the den and scats of a\r\n_Mustela frenata_. A domestic cat in Michigan killed a least weasel\r\n(Dearborn, 1932B:277).\r\n\r\n\r\nFood\r\n\r\nMice are killed by the least weasel biting into the back of the head\r\nand neck according to Allen (1940:460) who reported upon the growth of\r\nfive young, from Michigan, that he had in captivity. He further states\r\nthat a weasel was able to kill a mouse in 30 seconds. One large\r\n_Microtus_ introduced into the cage slept with a weasel for several\r\ndays and ate parts of the mice that the weasel killed but then the\r\nweasel killed this mouse! Llewellyn (1942:440-441), in writing of a\r\ncaptive from Virginia, says: \"When a live mouse was placed in the cage,\r\nthe weasel sprang upon it almost instantly. Grasping the mouse by the\r\nback of the head, the weasel bit its victim through the skull several\r\ntimes in rapid succession and held on with its sharp teeth. The sound\r\nof the teeth piercing the bone was distinctly audible at a distance of\r\nseveral feet. During this interval the weasel hugged the mouse closely\r\nwith its fore legs and pressed it firmly to its belly through a kicking\r\nmotion of the hind legs. The hold on the back of the head was not\r\nrelinquished until the mouse was dead. The killing took only a few\r\nseconds. Upon releasing the mouse the weasel usually came to the front\r\nof the cage and inspected the observer for an interval of several\r\nseconds after which it returned to its prey and began its meal at once.\r\nSometimes the blood would be licked from the wound in the back of the\r\nhead or perhaps an ear would be chewed a bit and the blood licked off,\r\nbut never did the weasel 'cut the throat' of its prey and 'suck the\r\nblood.'\r\n\r\n\"The weasel ate the head and brain first, beginning at the back of the\r\nhead and working forward. Just before reaching the nose the process was\r\nreversed and eating then proceeded from the base of the skull toward\r\nthe tail of the mouse. The tip of the nose, maxilla with teeth, and the\r\ntail seemed to be the parts least preferred; they were not eaten when\r\nan abundance of food was present. At no time did the weasel place its\r\nfront feet on the mouse in an attempt to hold it. A second or third\r\nmouse was killed immediately upon being placed in the cage even though\r\nthe first one had not been consumed. The weasel, however, usually\r\nreturned to the partially eaten mouse and finished it before starting\r\non a new one. Upon completing a meal, especially if the meal had been\r\nparticularly bloody, the weasel rubbed its chin on the bottom of the\r\ncage, scooting along and appearing more snakelike than normal. Whenever\r\nI attempted to remove a mouse, or partially eaten one, from the cage,\r\nthe weasel hung to the mouse tenaciously, and often allowed itself to\r\nbe lifted up in this manner.\r\n\r\n\"In the six days that the weasel was kept in captivity it was fed 10\r\nhouse mice having a total weight of 118 grams. As no food was given on\r\none day, the amount of food eaten is probably slightly below the actual\r\ncapacity of the animal. Since the weasel weighed only about 32 grams,\r\nthe average amount of food eaten a day was slightly in excess of\r\none-half the weight of the animal.\"\r\n\r\nPolderboer (1942:146-147) found in three dens, in Iowa, bits of\r\n_Reithrodontomys_ (harvest mice) and _Peromyscus maniculatus_ (deer\r\nmouse), and in the digestive tract of one least weasel there was a bone\r\nfragment and a few hairs of a deer mouse. In the account, given beyond,\r\nof a nest, Criddle (1947:69) records the Pennsylvania meadow mouse\r\n(_Microtus pennsylvanicus drummondi_) and the Gapper red-backed vole\r\n(_Clethrionomys gapperi_) as prey at Treesbank, Manitoba. The same\r\nauthor, concerning the same place, earlier (1926:199-200) wrote that in\r\n1922 the meadow mouse, _Microtus minor_, \"went into winter quarters in\r\ngreat numbers and its homes were well stocked with provisions . . . all\r\nwent well until the middle of February, 1923. Then, within a few days,\r\neach was taken possession of by a least weasel (_Mustela rixosa_) and\r\nthe inhabitants were quickly destroyed. One dwelling was occupied by\r\none of these weasels for about two weeks during which time I observed\r\nthat it had dragged several mice over the snow to its temporary home.\r\nThis residence was examined in April, and in it were discovered six\r\ndead _Microtus minor_, one _Evotomys_, the head of another, and at\r\nleast six or eight remnants of small rodents including _Microtus\r\ndrummondi_, these last remains being chiefly indicated by the\r\nhair-lined nest of the weasel.\r\n\r\n\"The homes of 27 other vole communities examined at this time were all\r\nfound to have been entered by weasels, the inhabitants having been\r\nkilled and partly eaten. Moreover, the weasels had made the homes\r\ntemporary centers from which they raided other rodent habitations in\r\nthe vicinity. Thus from being an abundant animal this vole was reduced\r\nto insignificance in the course of a few weeks, while all other kinds\r\nof mice had suffered severely from the same enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAn instance of predation on _Peromyscus_, revealing some of the methods\r\nof capturing prey, is recounted by Seton (1929 (2):636-637) who quotes\r\na letter to him from George L. Fordyce, of Youngstown, Ohio, as\r\nfollows: \"While out in the field this morning (Dec. 26), walking along\r\nthe bank of a ravine at the edge of our golf course, I saw a\r\nField-mouse run out of the bushes into the rough grass that is just\r\noutside of the fair-green of the course. In another instant, what I\r\nthought at first to be a white Mouse came out at the same place. The\r\nMouse ran into a wheel track, and disappeared under the grass, coming\r\nout about 6 feet from where it went in. The white animal followed\r\nthrough the same course, and when it came out, I saw that it was a\r\nsmall Weasel, very little larger than the Mouse, and that it was\r\nfollowing the trail of the Mouse by scent.\r\n\r\n\"For a time the Mouse ran in circles, and zigzagged about, often . . .\r\nwithin 4 or 5 feet of the Weasel; but the latter seemed so intent on\r\nthe trail, that it did not notice the Mouse to one side. After a time\r\nthe latter started toward the open golf course; and when the Weasel\r\nreached the point where the trail was straight, it sighted the prey,\r\nmade a sudden dash forward, and, although 25 feet behind, overtook the\r\nMouse while it was going 3 or 4 feet.\r\n\r\n\"For a few seconds, they seemed to fight, until the Weasel got the\r\nMouse by the throat, and started for the bushes, dragging the body.\r\nWhen it came to within about three feet of me, I moved a little to see\r\nwhat it would do. It dropped its victim, and ran into the ravine. The\r\nMouse had a drop of bright red blood in the center of its white throat.\r\nI waited near by for 15 or 20 minutes, thinking the Weasel might come\r\nback, but it did not show up again; even an hour later, the Mouse had\r\nnot been disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two suggestions, but no proof that I know of, in the\r\nliterature that the least weasel eats insects. Abbott (1884:27-32--1st\r\ned., 1884) gives considerable information on the food (some insects\r\nincluded) of the \"little weasel\" which he describes (_op. cit._; 27) as\r\nhaving \"a little pointed tail of a uniform brown color.\" Although this\r\nsuggests _Mustela rixosa_, Abbott mentions on the next page (page 28)\r\nthat a specimen of the smaller weasel measured six and a half inches\r\nfrom the tip of the snout to the base of the tail and that the tail\r\nitself measured two and a fourth inches to the tip of the last caudal\r\nvertebra. These measurements indicate that _Mustela erminea_ was\r\ninvolved. Because of the uncertainty as to the species of _Mustela_\r\ninvolved, Abbott's interesting data on food, nest and behavior are not\r\nrecorded in the present work. Seton (1929 (2):636) says that of several\r\nleast weasels brought to D. Nicholson at Morden, Manitoba, most of them\r\ndecayed so quickly that they could not be saved as specimens. To Seton\r\nthis indicated that insects were an important part of the food of the\r\nweasels.\r\n\r\nIn summary: Least weasels are known to eat harvest mice, deer mice,\r\nmeadow mice and red-backed mice; it is suspected that they eat also\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduction\r\n\r\nPolderboer (1948:296) has taken six specimens in \"northeastern Iowa\r\n[in] . . . January and December--all males in winter pelage. None of\r\nthese males showed signs of sexual activity; in all, the testes were\r\nretracted and diminutive in size. . . . A male least weasel in brown\r\npelage was taken November 17, 1945, at Marion, Iowa. This specimen had\r\nlarge testes that had descended into the scrotum. The testes, when\r\nremoved, were about the size of medium-sized garden peas. Microscopic\r\nexamination of the testes and the vasa deferentia showed mature sperms\r\nto be present. . . .\"\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1917, in Clay County, Nebraska, a nest with four young was\r\nfound (Swenk, 1926:321). On July 29, 1939, an adult and five young were\r\nplowed out of the ground in Allegan County, Michigan; one of the two\r\nyoung males weighed 40.5 grams two days after capture (Allen,\r\n1940:459-460). On August 12, 1932, ten young with the mother, were\r\nfound in Roseau County, Minnesota (Swanson and Fryklund, 1935:125).\r\nSeptember appears to have been the month of birth of a specimen, no.\r\n8472 in the Carnegie Museum, taken on November 24 in Pittsburgh,\r\nPennsylvania. In October, a young least weasel is recorded from\r\nPennsylvania (Winecoff, 1930:313). Early December was the time of birth\r\nof a specimen, approximately 10 weeks old, no. 88077, University of\r\nMichigan, taken on February 21 in Allegan County. On December 25, 1927,\r\nin Washington County, Pennsylvania, \"five full-sized, though\r\nyoung . . . animals were caught under the same pile of corn fodder\"\r\n(Sutton, 1929:253). The first week of January seems to have been the\r\ntime of birth of a juvenile, no. 88080, University of Michigan, taken\r\nin Livingston County, Michigan, on March 27, 1943, since the specimen\r\nis approximately seven weeks old. On January 15, 1929, in Washington\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, four young with the eyes yet unopened were\r\nobtained from a nest (Sutton, 1929:254). On January 25, 1928, young,\r\nthe eyes of which may not yet have been open, were taken from a den in\r\nWashington County, Pennsylvania, by Winecoff (1930:313), who records\r\nother young having been taken in the same month as well as in February.\r\nOn March 10, a female from North Portal, Saskatchewan, gave birth to\r\nfour young (Dunk, 1946:392). On April 18, 1916, four young, half grown,\r\nwere taken in Nebraska (Swenk, 1926:317). On April 2, 1929, three young\r\nwere found in Roseau County, Minnesota, according to Swanson and\r\nFryklund (1935:125) who remark that: \"The Pennsylvania and Minnesota\r\nrecords show that least weasels may be born any time from July to early\r\nFebruary in the northern states.\" Now, with all of the above records\r\navailable, it turns out that November, May and June are the only months\r\nin which young least weasels have not been reported. Of course some of\r\nthe young, for which the ages were not specified, were born in\r\npreceding months. Even so, the data now available suggests that, in the\r\nUnited States, young least weasels may be born in every month of the\r\nyear. The number per litter is 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, and 10, yielding an\r\naverage of 5.\r\n\r\nThe rate of growth of the young has not been studied enough to allow of\r\njudging if it differs significantly from that of other species of the\r\ngenus. Allen (1940:459-460), however, tells us that of the three young\r\nfemales and two young males captured on July 29, 1939, in Allegan\r\nCounty, Michigan, one male that was killed on July 31, 1939, weighed\r\n40.5 grams. The male remaining alive increased from 46 grams (August 5)\r\nto 62.5 grams on September 20, having eaten 63 mice while in captivity.\r\nThe females in the period of August 5 to September 4 increased in\r\nweight as follows: 41 up to 49 grams; 44 to 50 grams; and 47 to 58\r\ngrams, having eaten, by September 26, 60, 64 and 65 mice.\r\n\r\nConcerning a nest in which young were found, Sutton (1929:254) writes\r\nthat on January 15, 1929, near Burgettstown, Washington County,\r\nPennsylvania, an animal was seen to enter a small hole in a creek bank.\r\nAfter the observer dug in a distance of approximately six inches an\r\nadult, female least weasel was seen and obtained. Back of the animal,\r\nthe hole, which turned sharply downward, was full of water. The weasel\r\nfirst seen was a female nursing young. A chamber, to the side of the\r\nhole, filled with dead grass, comprised a nest containing four young\r\nwith the eyes yet unopened. Several nests occupied by adult least\r\nweasels or by least weasels that were old enough to shift for\r\nthemselves have been found. Polderboer (1942:145-147) in the winter of\r\n1939-40, on a 144 acre farm in Butler County, Iowa, found four least\r\nweasels living, singly, in burrows dug by moles and pocket gophers. The\r\nnests therein made by mice were used by the least weasels. Winecoff\r\n(1930:312-313) mentions one den in Pennsylvania that contained the\r\nremains of only mice, \"and not a hint of a feather.\" Above, in the\r\naccount of food of the least weasel, Criddle's (1926:199-200) account\r\nof the havoc wrought by least weasels among the meadow mice (_Microtus\r\nochrogaster minor_) has been given. In this account he mentions the\r\nfur-lined nests of the weasels that had appropriated the homes of the\r\n_Microtus_. Criddle's (1947:69) later account of a nest at Treesbank,\r\nManitoba, is as follows: \"A Nest of the Least Weasel.--When a least\r\nweasel finds its way into a locality that has a large number of mice in\r\nit, it selects for its home one of their nests that has been made in a\r\nwell concealed place. This it immediately starts to improve by lining\r\nit with hair plucked from its victims before eating them; and as long\r\nas sufficient numbers of mice remain in the district the weasel\r\ncontinues adding their hair to the nest, so that the thickness of its\r\nwalls give one a good idea of the length of time it has been in use.\r\nThe nest is not only used for sleeping in, as most of the food is\r\nconsumed in it. Frozen mice are taken in to be thawed out and the\r\nweasel carries those it has recently killed in to prevent them getting\r\nfrozen, or perhaps to have them warm for its next meal.\r\n\r\n\"On January 27, 1946, my son Percy called my attention to a nest that\r\nhe had just uncovered in a clover stack that we were using. This nest\r\nhad originally been made by a Drummond's vole, _Microtus pennsylvanicus\r\ndrummondii_, and taken from it by the least weasel, _Mustela rixosa_,\r\nthe tracks of which had been noticed about the stack yard since the\r\nfirst snow in early November.\r\n\r\n\"The nest had evidently been in use for at least three months and the\r\ncontinual additions made to its walls had been so great that they were\r\nnearly an inch thick of hair matted together so closely that it\r\nappeared to be felt. The hair alone weighed nearly 22 gm., so that with\r\nthis for protection the weasel must have been warm and comfortable\r\nthrough the severest winter weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Map showing occurrences and probable geographic\r\nranges of the subspecies of _Mustela rixosa_ in North America.]\r\n\r\n\"In the nest were two red-backed mice, _Clethrionomys gapperi_, one of\r\nwhich had the base of its skull eaten out. No hair had been removed\r\nfrom either of them, but a _Microtus_ lying in a side tunnel some feet\r\naway had the long hair plucked from its back and sides. In and close\r\nabout the nest were found forty-three front parts of mice skulls which\r\nhad evidently been discarded because of the sharp teeth in the\r\nmaxillaries. Seven full stomachs and eleven hind feet of adult\r\n_Microtus_ with parts of leg bones were disclosed in, or under, the\r\nweasel's bed and a few small bits of skin with hair attached were\r\nscattered among the plucked hair of the nest.\r\n\r\n\"This weasel seems to have been rather remiss in its sanitary habits as\r\nits pile of dung was almost, or quite, touching the nest and only just\r\nto the side of its entrance. It was composed of 117 voids all of which\r\ncontained much hair and broken bone.\r\n\r\n\"Six other mouse nests found in the same stack, or others adjoining it,\r\nhad been thinly lined with hair. One of these had two mice in it, a\r\nred-backed with its brain eaten out and a _Microtus_ with some hair\r\nplucked from its neck. Another nest contained the front part of a skull\r\nwith teeth and the hind feet and tail of a red-back. Besides the mice\r\nfound in the nests seven others were discovered tucked away in side\r\ntunnels. One of these mice had most of the hair plucked from its back.\r\nWhether all these mice and nests belonged to the same weasel or not I\r\nam unable to say, but it is usual for them to have several nests in the\r\narea surrounding the one that is used as their headquarters or home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela rixosa eskimo= (Stone)\r\n\r\nLeast Weasel\r\n\r\nPlates 14 and 15\r\n\r\n    _Putorius rixosus eskimo_ Stone, Proc.

Allowing 5\r\n     per cent for shrinkage, the hind feet of 5 topotypes yield an\r\n     average measurement of 23 for the hind foot.\r\n\r\n     Female: Measurements of two topotypes are: Total length, 184, 180;\r\n     length of tail, 25, 25; length of hind foot, 24, 18. In four other\r\n     topotypes the hind feet, allowing 5 per cent for shrinkage, yield\r\n     an average of 21.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Winter pelage all white, rarely with few white hairs in\r\n     tip of tail but no black pencil; summer pelage with upper parts\r\n     about Raw Umber and tone 3 of Chocolate pl. 343 of Oberthür and\r\n     Dauthenay; underparts white, extending over upper lip, insides of\r\n     limbs and over all four feet. Line of demarcation between\r\n     underparts and upper parts extends from upper lip posterodorsally\r\n     to behind eye down to base of ear, up behind ear for a third or\r\n     more of its height, and back along side of body. Tail unicolor all\r\n     around and same color as upper parts. Least width of color of\r\n     underparts averaging 83 per cent of greatest width of color of\r\n     upper parts.\r\n\r\n     _Skull._--Based on topotypes; see measurements and plates 14 and\r\n     15; weight, 0.82 (0.74-0.93) grams in males, and 0.80 and 0.84 in\r\n     two females; basilar length, 29.5 (27.6-30.1) in males and 27.8\r\n     (27.1-28.8) in females; otherwise as described in _M. e.\r\n     richardsonii_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Among the earliest specimens preserved was one by Edward W.\r\nNelson in the course of his explorations of the Upper Yukon, and one in\r\n1874 by L. T. Turner from St. Michaels, Alaska. Bangs, in 1896 (p. 22)\r\nmentioned the occurrence of the species in Alaska, but it was not until\r\n1900 (p. 44) that Stone named the subspecies, and then principally on\r\nthe basis of specimens obtained two years before by E. A. McIlhenny.\r\n\r\nThe large size, broad skull, light color and short tail are the\r\ndistinguishing subspecific characters of the race _eskimo_, and the\r\nthree characters first mentioned are distinguishing features also of\r\nthe subspecies of _Mustela erminea_, namely _arctica_, which inhabits\r\nthe same region. Possibly _eskimo_ also will be found on Banks Island\r\nand the other Arctic islands between Alaska and Greenland, as is _M. e.\r\narctica_; at the present time no specimens of _Mustela rixosa_ are\r\nknown from these islands although some race of rixosa would be expected\r\nto occur there.\r\n\r\nAnimals from southern Alaska average slightly smaller than those from\r\nnorthern Alaska, and this decrease in size toward the south probably\r\nrepresents intergradation with _M. r. rixosa_. Further evidence of\r\nintergradation is furnished by the short tail of the specimen from 15\r\nmiles east of Atlin; in other particulars this specimen agrees with the\r\nsubspecies _rixosa_ to which it is here referred. Nevertheless, the\r\nshort tail, and color pattern, namely reëntrant angle of white behind\r\nthe eye, is to be seen in all Alaskan specimens examined in the brown\r\npelage, even in no. 107591, from Tyonek on Cook Inlet, which Osgood\r\n(1901:69) and Swenk (1926:323) thought might not differ from the\r\nsubspecies _M. r. rixosa_.\r\n\r\nEach of four male topotypes, hardly subadult in age, probably of a\r\nsingle litter, is much larger than any other specimen seen from Point\r\nBarrow. The basilar length, for example, is 31.9 as against 29.5, and\r\nthe weight of the skull (with lower jaws) is as much as 1.5 grams, as\r\nagainst 0.93 in the heaviest of the other males. Initial examination of\r\nmaterials from Point Barrow raised the suspicion that two distinct\r\nspecies were represented--_rixosa_ and a larger one possibly allied to\r\n_M. nivalis_ of the Old World. Nevertheless, further study almost\r\ncompletely allayed the suspicion because the only difference\r\ndiscernible is one of size, and it is supposed that additional\r\nspecimens will bridge the gap in size and show that _M. r. eskimo_ at\r\nPoint Barrow averages larger than the adult specimens now available\r\nindicate. The four large males of subadult age are nos. 42814-42816 and\r\n42818 of the American Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nOf the fourteen adult and subadult skulls examined, two display lesions\r\nresulting from infestation of the frontal sinuses by nematode\r\nparasites. None of the young skulls show such infestation.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 42 as follows.

Only a few other naturalists followed Baird\r\nin distinguishing the least weasel as a separate species until Bangs in\r\n1896 (p. 21) clearly differentiated it and proposed for it the name\r\n_Putorius rixosus_, which continues in use today and applies to the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation at the National Museum of Canada, through the energy\r\nof Dr. R. M. Anderson, of a good series of specimens from Saskatchewan\r\nin the general vicinity of the type locality allows for the first time\r\nan adequate conception of the amount of secondary sexual variation and\r\nindividual variation and permits recognition of subspecific characters\r\nto differentiate between _M. r. rixosa_ and the subspecies _eskimo_ and\r\n_campestris_. In comparison with the subspecies _allegheniensis_ the\r\nbasis for segregation is less clear and will remain somewhat in doubt\r\nuntil additional adults of _allegheniensis_ from, say, Pennsylvania,\r\nbecome available with accurate external measurements taken in the flesh\r\nand especially with complete skulls.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with the subspecies _eskimo_ is suggested by the short\r\ntail of the specimen from fifteen miles east of Atlin, British\r\nColumbia; in other particulars that specimen, a skin-alone, agrees with\r\nthe subspecies _rixosa_. Intergradation with _campestris_ is indicated\r\nby increased size of some specimens from North Dakota, and is suggested\r\nwith _allegheniensis_ by the color of specimens from Wisconsin and\r\nIllinois. Three specimens from Winona County, in southeastern\r\nMinnesota, unfortunately are skulls-alone without external\r\nmeasurements. Also, two of these skulls are of young animals. The one\r\nadult, unsexed, is from Crystal Springs. Selected cranial measurements\r\nare: basilar length, 28.5; length of tympanic bulla, 10.9. These\r\nmeasurements accord with those of males of the subspecies _rixosa_ to\r\nwhich the specimens from Winona County, therefore, are here assigned.\r\nThe possibilities have not been excluded, however, that the adult is an\r\nunusually large female of the subspecies _campestris_ or a male of\r\n_allegheniensis_ that has tympanic bullae longer than average for that\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\nSome hesitation is felt in assigning the specimens, 8 in all, from\r\neastern Canada to the subspecies _rixosa_. The skin-alone from Eagle\r\nRiver and the skin, with part of the skull, from St. Michael Bay, are\r\nin transitional pelage and are of no help in appraising subspecific\r\ncharacters. The one adult specimen which does have a complete skull is\r\nfrom an island south of the Comb Hills. This animal in all respects\r\nagrees with selected individuals of _M. r. rixosa_ from Saskatchewan,\r\nbut each of the five other skins in summer pelage has spots of dark\r\nbrown color on the breast. Only about one specimen in three of _rixosa_\r\nfrom Saskatchewan is similarly marked. Furthermore, on some of the\r\nspecimens from eastern Canada the spots are larger than on any of the\r\nanimals from farther west. The greater frequency of brown spots on the\r\nbreast, the larger average size of these spots, and the darker average\r\ncoloration of the upper parts are suggestive of geographic variation,\r\nthe existence of which has to be proved by additional and more complete\r\nspecimens from eastern Canada. For the time being, specimens from there\r\nare tentatively assigned to the race _rixosa_.\r\n\r\nOf 56 subadult and adult skulls only 3 (1 North Dakota; 1 Calgary,\r\nAlberta; and 1 Island S Comb Hills, Queb.) display lesions resulting\r\nfrom infestation of the frontal sinuses by nematode parasites. None of\r\nthe young skulls shows such infestation.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 87 as follows.

Underparts white at least on thoracic\r\n     region; approximately three-fourths of specimens with brown rictal\r\n     spot at angle of mouth or with this area covered by brown upper\r\n     parts which extend down on each side and meet on the underparts in\r\n     about one specimen out of three; upper lips and hind feet\r\n     ordinarily brown; toes of forefeet ordinarily white (see under\r\n     remarks for details of color pattern). Least width of color of\r\n     underparts in the specimens in which the dark color of the upper\r\n     parts does not encircle the body averages 60 per cent of greatest\r\n     width of color of upper parts, or including all specimens the\r\n     percentage is 42.\r\n\r\n     _Skull_ (based on specimens from Pa. listed in table of cranial\r\n     measurements, which see and plates 14 and 15).--Basilar length\r\n     29.7 and 28.6 in male and 28.0 in female; weights unavailable;\r\n     otherwise as described in _M. e. richardsonii_. The length of the\r\n     tympanic bullae seems to be actually less, and less in relation to\r\n     the basilar length, than in other American subspecies of _M.\r\n     rixosa_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Robert Kennicott's mention in 1859 (p. 245) of what seems\r\nto be this subspecies is the earliest reference to it that I can\r\nidentify in the literature. He used the specific name _pusillus_ and it\r\nwas not until 1900 that Samuel N. Rhoads proposed the name _Putorius\r\nallegheniensis_. Since 1900, several records of occurrence have been\r\npublished which have made the geographic range of this race better\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAn adequate number of specimens has been gathered only from Ohio and\r\nfrom western Pennsylvania. Many from Ohio are without accurate external\r\nmeasurements taken in the flesh. The majority of the specimens from\r\nPennsylvania owe their preservation to the willingness of local\r\nofficials, who pay bounties on weasels, to save the skins of _Mustela\r\nrixosa_. These specimens ordinarily comprise the skin with locality but\r\nbecause the feet, external measurements in the flesh, and skulls are\r\nunavailable, the material is far from adequate and to give an accurate\r\nnotion of the usual or average cranial characters of _allegheniensis_\r\nin Pennsylvania, skulls from there are especially desirable.\r\n\r\nA smaller percentage of the specimens from Ohio than from Pennsylvania\r\nhave the brown color of the upper parts meeting on the underparts.\r\nAlso, more of the specimens from Ohio are lighter colored and this\r\nsuggests intergradation with the subspecies _campestris_ and _rixosa_\r\nto the westward.\r\n\r\nFrom Pennsylvania 23 animals in brown pelage are available. In 5 there\r\nis a rictal spot at the angle of the mouth; in 5 the area is white and\r\nin 13 the brown color of the upper parts is continuous over the area in\r\nquestion. Only 2 of 23 have the upper lips white. Eight have the color\r\nof the upper parts meeting on the venter thus restricting the white of\r\nthe underparts to the chin, throat, and pectoral region, and 6 of these\r\nhave a white area in the inguinal region as well. The toes of the\r\nforefeet are white in 3 of 4 animals suitable for examination in this\r\nregard and the hind feet are marked with white in 3 of the 8 animals\r\nwhich have the hind feet preserved. _Mustela rixosa_ in Pennsylvania\r\nparallels the species _Mustela frenata_ in that in this relatively\r\nhumid area of the northeastern United States the color of the upper\r\nparts is darker and the area of the dark-colored upper parts is\r\nincreased at the expense of the area of the light-colored underparts.\r\nAlso _Mustela erminea_ in this same region (range of the subspecies\r\n_Mustela cicognanii_) shows the same tendency to darker color of upper\r\nparts and their extension in area at the expense of the area of the\r\nlight-colored underparts, or was mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for the seeming absence of the species from\r\nNew England and all that part of Canada and the United States south of\r\nthe St. Lawrence River and northeastward from Pennsylvania. The size of\r\nfemales of _M. erminea cicognanii_ in that territory is so little more\r\nthan in _rixosa_ that the latter possibly cannot successfully compete\r\nwith the _erminea_ stock which may already occupy the ecologic niche to\r\nwhich _rixosa_ is adapted. It will be remembered that in western North\r\nAmerica in territory seemingly climatically suitable for _rixosa_ it\r\noccurs no farther southward than the line below which _M. erminea_ has\r\nbecome reduced to a size comparable with that of _M. rixosa_.\r\n\r\nOf 41 subadult and adult skulls assigned to this subspecies 24 have\r\nobvious lesions in the frontal sinuses evidently resulting from\r\ninfestation by nematodes. More in detail, none of the specimens from\r\nIllinois (3 individuals), Pennsylvania (3 barely subadult), or West\r\nVirginia (2) displays lesions. From Wisconsin, Indiana, Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina there is one specimen each and each specimen displays\r\nlesions. From Ohio, 17 of 23 specimens display lesions. From Michigan 3\r\nof 8 specimens display lesions; 2 adults and one subadult have lesions\r\nand 5 subadults do not have lesions.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 102 as follows: Arranged\r\n     alphabetically by states and within each state by counties from\r\n     north to south.

Swenk (1926:313) credits Samuel Aughey with\r\nrecording this animal, _M. r. campestris_, from Nebraska, as early as\r\n1880, under the name _Putorius pusillus_. In 1908, Swenk recorded the\r\nanimal from the same state under the name _rixosus_ and in 1913 the\r\nrace _campestris_ was formally named by H. H. T. Jackson.\r\n\r\nOn the testimony of a friend who had previously obtained several\r\nspecimens for him, Swenk (1926:321) records the least weasel from\r\nOshkosh, Garden County, Nebraska, which is a marginal record of\r\noccurrence to the southwest for _M. r. campestris_.\r\n\r\nAt an early stage in the study of American weasels the writer examined\r\nthe specimens from Nebraska saved by Mr. Myron H. Swenk and recorded\r\nmeasurements of them. However, at the time of writing this account the\r\nspecimens were not available for examination and the account of\r\ncoloration is accordingly incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe large size, particularly the large external measurements, comprises\r\nthe principal distinguishing character of this subspecies of the least\r\nweasel.\r\n\r\nOf the four adults examined from Iowa and South Dakota one exhibits\r\nlesions such as result from infestation of the frontal sinuses by\r\nnematodes.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 21 as follows.

All the life-zones from Alpine Arctic to Tropical are\r\n     inhabited. In the extremely desert region of southeastern\r\n     California and western Arizona the species is scarce or possibly\r\n     absent although recovery of a skull (see under account of _M. f.\r\n     neomexicana_) from near the center of this region at Potholes on\r\n     the Colorado River, and a reported occurrence in the mountains of\r\n     Baja California, México, indicate that a few individuals of the\r\n     species live in favorable habitat even in this desert region.\r\n\r\n_Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _Mustela erminea_, in\r\nregions where the two species occur together, by tail more than 44 per\r\ncent of length of head and body and by postglenoidal length of skull\r\nless than 46 per cent of condylobasal length in males and less than 48\r\nper cent in females (see under characters of the species); from\r\n_Mustela rixosa_ by presence of black pencil on tail, caudal vertebrae\r\nmore than a fourth (2/5-3/4) of length of head and body, basilar length\r\nof skull more than 34 mm.; from _Mustela africana_ by absence of thenar\r\npad on forefoot, underparts without longitudinal, median, abdominal\r\nstripe of same color as upper parts, upper lips narrowly (rather than\r\nbroadly) edged with color of underparts, longest facial vibrissae\r\nextending to or behind posterior margin of ear; presence of p2; more\r\ninflated (see pls. 23 and 30) tympanic bullae.\r\n\r\n_Characters of the species._--Size large: Total length 300 to 550 mm.;\r\ntail two-fifths to seven-tenths of length of head and body, with\r\ndistinct black pencil at end; caudal vertebrae 19 to 23; skull with\r\nlong precranial portion; postglenoidal length, expressed as a\r\npercentage of the condylobasal length, less than 47 in females and\r\nordinarily less than 46 in males; upper parts brown; light-colored\r\nunderparts, in summer pelage, tinged with buffy or yellowish and\r\ncontinuous from chin to inguinal region; some subspecies (southwestern\r\nUnited States, México, Central America, and Florida) with white or\r\nyellowish facial markings which do not occur in any other American\r\nspecies of the genus _Mustela_.\r\n\r\n_Geographic variation._--Forty-two subspecies are recognized, and the\r\nspecies is geographically more variable than any of the other 3\r\nAmerican species. Color, color-pattern especially on the head, relative\r\nproportions of the tail, hind feet, body including the head, and shape\r\nand size of the skull are the principal features in which geographic\r\nvariation has been noted. The variation in the skull extends to the\r\nbasicranial region (shape and size of tympanic bullae and related\r\nstructures), interorbital region and preorbital region.\r\n\r\n_Natural History._--Habitat and Numbers.--As has already been remarked,\r\nthe long-tailed weasel is absent from the extreme desert of the\r\nsouthwestern United States and northwestern México. Possibly the\r\nabsence of water to drink is the limiting factor. In southern Nevada\r\nthe finding of weasels only in places that were well watered, even\r\nthough small rodents suitable as food for weasels were even more\r\nabundant in the surrounding desert, supports this possibility that the\r\nabsence of water to drink is the limiting factor. Also at Berkeley,\r\nCalifornia, in early December of 1927 in the canyon at the head of\r\nDwight Way and in the autumn and winter of 1928 in Strawberry Canyon on\r\nthe campus of the University of California, I trapped extensively for\r\nthis species in different habitats and obtained, in all, four\r\nindividuals no one of which was farther than 10 feet from water. The\r\nlesser cruising range of the individual weasel than of, say, the\r\ncoyote, probably explains why, in an arid region, for example\r\nPahranagat Valley, Nevada, only the meadow mice and their riparian\r\nassociates are preyed upon by the long-tailed weasel whereas the coyote\r\npreys upon these riparian rodents and also upon the kangaroo rats and\r\nother rodents which are so abundant in adjoining habitats that are\r\ndevoid of water.\r\n\r\nIn areas where water is available every few hundred yards, no\r\nparticular habitat seems to be avoided in summer providing there is\r\nfood for the long-tailed weasel. In winter (January and March) there\r\nobviously was a choice of habitat, possibly occasioned by more abundant\r\nfood or more satisfactory shelter, or both, in Centre County,\r\nPennsylvania, where Glover (1943B) found the population density in the\r\nchestnut-oak habitat to be one weasel per 6.5 acres in areas of tree\r\ncuttings and slash and one weasel per 13.3 acres in the open forest. In\r\nthe scrub oak-pitch pine forest type the population was one weasel per\r\n26.4 acres in tree cuttings and slash and one weasel per 38.2 acres in\r\nthe open forest. No weasel was found in an area of 9.6 acres comprising\r\na wood lot, the edge of the forest, abandoned fence rows and an\r\nabandoned orchard. The two types of forest in which he did find\r\nweasels, 25 in all, comprised 381.6 acres. Glover's (_op. cit._) data\r\nis the only precise information known to me on actual numbers of\r\nlong-tailed weasels in a given area of any considerable size.\r\n\r\nFluctuations which I elsewhere (1946:57) have designated as multiannual\r\nfluctuations occur in this species but seemingly not in the degree that\r\nthey do in _Mustela erminea_. This difference between the two species\r\nis to be expected because _M. frenata_ does not range so far northward\r\ntoward the polar regions as does _M. erminea_ and populations of most\r\nkinds of animals in the polar, at least in the arctic, regions are\r\nsubject to more extreme and more regular fluctuations than are kinds of\r\nanimals in temperate or tropical regions. Indication of the means by\r\nwhich decrease in the weasel population is brought about is afforded by\r\nOsgood's (1935:156) observations around Rutland, Vermont. In the late\r\nwinter of 1934, tracks indicated that weasels left their usual haunts\r\nand hunted cross lots, vainly trying to find food. Testing of the small\r\nmammal population in the spring and summer of 1934 showed that it was\r\nat low ebb. In the fall of 1934 mice and shrews were abundant again but\r\nweasels seemed to be entirely absent. The decrease in the population of\r\nweasels lagged behind the decrease in the population of the herbivorous\r\nprey as did the subsequent increase; this, of course, is the normal\r\nrelation of carnivorous species of mammals and their prey, at least in\r\nand above the Transition Life-zone.\r\n\r\nThe average distance away from the central den which four weasels (sex\r\nunspecified) traveled in a single night at Ames, Iowa, was 312 feet;\r\nthe maximum distance was 642 feet. These data were obtained in the\r\nwinter of 1939 by Polderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson (1941:115) who\r\nstudied the tracks in the snow. In Manitoba, Criddle and Criddle\r\n(1925:143) noted that a female which lived in their basement often\r\nwandered more than half a mile away in search of food. In Michigan,\r\nQuick (1944:75) found the maximum distance traveled in one day (=\r\nnight?) by a large male to be 3.43 miles although two miles was the\r\naverage distance traveled by this individual. In 1942, from January 4\r\nto March 4, in Centre County, Pennsylvania, Glover (1943B) studied\r\ntracks of 11 males and 10 females, in newly fallen snow, and\r\nascertained that the distance traveled in a single night averaged 704\r\n(60-2535) feet for the male and 346 (20-1420) feet for the female. The\r\nweasels in the open timber traveled farther per trip than those in the\r\nbrushland and dense stands of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehavior\r\n\r\nAn adult female (now the holotype of _Mustela frenata nevadensis_) seen\r\nrunning across a field, and, I think, unaware of my presence, at every\r\nbound bent her back up so far that she reminded me of a measuring worm.\r\nFor part of the time when running, the tail was held off the ground\r\nstraight out behind, and then, for a while, inclined upward at an angle\r\nof about 45°. Another weasel that I saw in the daytime, and that I\r\nthink was unaware of my presence, was bounding along among the\r\n_Baccharis_ bushes on the south-facing slope of Dwight Way Canyon,\r\nBerkeley, California. This individual, at each bound, arched the back\r\nup so high as to remind me, again, of a measuring worm.\r\n\r\nThe long-tailed weasel is a land mammal and unlike its close relative,\r\nthe mink, is seldom seen in the water. That it can swim, however, is\r\nattested by the capture of one while it was swimming across the Río\r\nRamos in México (Davis, 1944:381). Also, Green (1936), in May, in\r\nGratiot County, Michigan, saw a weasel, running with a _Peromyscus_ in\r\nits mouth. The weasel dropped the mouse, entered the water and swam to\r\na hole among stones.\r\n\r\nMore instances of climbing, than of swimming, have been reported in the\r\nliterature for the long-tailed weasel. Seton (1929 (2):625) quotes\r\nWilliam M. Graffius of Pennsylvania as having seen a weasel closely\r\npursue a red squirrel nearly to the topmost branch of a large hemlock.\r\nWhen the squirrel loosed its hold and dropped into a stream, the weasel\r\ndescended to the ground and caught and killed the squirrel when it\r\nemerged from the water. Pearce (1937:483), in central New York State,\r\non July 29, 1931, watched a weasel chase a chipmunk up a black cherry\r\ntree ten inches in diameter, and noted that the first rush carried the\r\nweasel \"straight up the trunk for approximately 10 feet, where it\r\nhesitated momentarily before continuing. Then, instead of climbing\r\nvertically, it made progress by traveling in short ascending spirals\r\naround the trunk, scarcely making 3 feet in height for each circuit of\r\nthe tree. Upon reaching the limb by which the chipmunk escaped, the\r\nweasel followed out along this in the same spiral manner. This limb had\r\na diameter of about 4 inches at its base and extended upward at an\r\nangle of perhaps 20 degrees above the horizontal . . . it made its way\r\nhead first almost down to the ground, using the same spiral mode of\r\nprogress, but at a leisurely pace. . . . While traveling down the side\r\nlimb it appeared practically to wrap its sinuous body around the limb.\"\r\n\r\nA male long-tailed weasel, from Colorado, which I kept captive was\r\noften fed freshly killed mice. These I thrust through one of the small\r\nopenings in the wire mesh. The weasel quickly learned to seize any part\r\nof a mouse thus introduced and his tugging aided in getting the mouse\r\ninto the cage. Occasionally a mouse too large to be got through the\r\nmesh had to be withdrawn. In such an instance, if the weasel had\r\nalready had hold of the mouse, he would screech frightfully. I have\r\nheard no other vocal sounds from a weasel except a kind of purring.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell apparently is well developed; at any rate it is keen\r\nenough to allow the weasel to follow the trail of an intended victim by\r\nthe scent left by the latter. Murie's (1935:321-322) account, for\r\nexample, of a weasel pursuing a snowshoe rabbit gives clear evidence\r\nthat the weasel relied on scent in following the rabbit.\r\n\r\nA captive male weasel obtained at Gainesville, Florida, stamped his\r\nhind feet when annoyed (Moore, 1945:259).\r\n\r\nA male from Colorado that I kept for months in a cage at Lafayette,\r\nCalifornia, was several times found in a sleep so deep that he was\r\nawakened with difficulty. Seton (1929 (2):629-630) writes: \"In my small\r\nmenagerie, I have had half-a-dozen Weasels of the New York species.\r\nTheir sleeping dens are arranged so as to be easily and silently\r\nopened. Several times I have lifted the lid to find the weasel in a\r\ndeep sleep--a sleep so profound that I had to poke him vigorously with\r\na stick before he awoke, looked up, and rushed forth with a little puff\r\nof wrath, and a little puff of smell.\"\r\n\r\nFeces and urine were ordinarily deposited in one particular place by\r\neach of the captive weasels that I have observed. Hamilton (1933:294)\r\nrecords that a large male _M. f. noveboracensis_, in a week, averaged\r\n10 evacuations every twenty-four hours, that urination immediately\r\nprecedes defecation, and describes the feces as black or brown, long\r\nand narrow and often spiral-shaped owing \"to the matted fur of some\r\nrodent that had been eaten.\" Quick (1944:77) writes, concerning four\r\nwinter dens in Michigan, that \"The latrines of weasels were in the\r\nentries of used dens and scats could be collected there by the\r\nhandful.\" Polderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson (1941:116) in the spring of\r\n1939 at Ames, Iowa, gathered scats \"from latrines found at the\r\nentrances of burrows and from latrine chambers found within burrows.\"\r\nScats were found by them in the linings of some nests.\r\n\r\nCourage of a high order might be credited to the long-tailed weasel\r\nbecause individuals have attacked animals much larger than the weasels.\r\nActually, however, in few if any of these instances was the motive for\r\nattack known. That a hawk was attacked is suggested by Soper's\r\n(1919:45) account of _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_ wherein he\r\nrepeats a story told to him of a hawk observed in unsteady flight, and\r\nobviously in distress, which when it plummeted to earth was with a\r\nweasel which escaped from the observer. Charles Tatham, Jr., of\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, according to Seton (1929 (2): 630, 631)\r\nobserved one that attacked his dog.\r\n\r\nPersons and long-tailed weasels have figured in some rather strange\r\nencounters. For example, Oehler (1944:198) recounts that in the autumn\r\nof 1940 at Cincinnati, Ohio, an animal, mistakenly thought to be a\r\nchipmunk, was seen to dash into a hollow log whereupon pounding on the\r\nlog brought out the weasel which bit and clung to the hand of one man\r\nwhose companion was bitten when he attempted to free the man that was\r\nbitten first.\r\n\r\nSeton (1929 (2): 631) writes that on the night of September 5, 1897, on\r\nRoosevelt's old ranch, near Medora, North Dakota, a man turned over his\r\nsaddle (which was lying on the ground) to dislodge what was thought to\r\nbe a pack-rat. The animal was a long-tailed weasel which attacked him.\r\nIt ran up his legs a number of times aiming at his throat before being\r\nkilled by a dog.\r\n\r\nCriddle and Criddle (1925:146) wrote: \"August 20, 1919.--A _longicauda_\r\nin the Insectary ran at me this morning apparently with a view to\r\nintimidating. It uttered a shrill cry while making the attack, but\r\nretreated after advancing within two feet.\" The same authors (_op.\r\ncit._: 147) further write that a \"Long-tailed Weasel was caught in a\r\ntrap set for gophers, and, on being released by Miss M. Criddle, at\r\nonce turned upon its liberator and bit savagely at her boot. It then\r\nmoved a short distance away to a tub of water, where it drank\r\nthirstily, merely glancing at the observer from time to time while\r\ndoing so, and then ran off out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. T. Criddle records a similar experience. After liberating a large\r\nweasel from a trap, it immediately rushed at him and persisted in its\r\nattack with such ferocity that it was three times picked up and thrown,\r\non each occasion to a greater distance, before it finally abandoned its\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n\"We have no record of a weasel making an unprovoked attack upon\r\nanyone.\"\r\n\r\nWight (1932: 164) in Michigan, detected a weasel attacking a hen. The\r\nweasel fled at Wight's approach but returned and attacked him several\r\ntimes. Finally the weasel went around Wight to reach the hen. In\r\nWight's words \"There was no evidence of infuriation, but rather a well\r\ndirected offense at the one object, regardless of its size, which stood\r\nbetween the weasel and an opportunity to satisfy its desire to kill,\r\nwhich was probably based upon the uncontrollable urge of hunger pangs.\"\r\n\r\nWeasels of each of the three North American species have been\r\nsuccessfully kept in captivity. A type of cage satisfactory for keeping\r\nthe animals in the laboratory is described by Bissonnette and Bailey\r\n(1940:761-763). Some of the captives used their teeth to break glass\r\nwater-containers and to gnaw slivers of wood from the cages. Ingested\r\nslivers of wood and bits of broken glass caused the deaths of some of\r\nthe captives. Weasels kept by me all were of the species _Mustela\r\nfrenata_. They thrived on a meat diet but I was always careful to give\r\nthem, every few days, if not each day, some small rodents entire,\r\nthinking that the bits of bone and fur ingested might, in some way\r\nunknown to me, keep the digestive tract in better condition than would\r\nflesh devoid of hair and bone.\r\n\r\nThree young weasels approximately the size of mice, in the Okefinokee\r\nSwamp of Georgia, were obtained by a hunter who, according to Harper\r\n(1927:303), raised them by feeding \"milk for a few days, and then fresh\r\nmeat.\" Litters of young born in captivity have been successfully raised\r\nby the mothers (Hamilton, 1933) and success in getting the animals to\r\nbreed in captivity and to rear their young is recorded by Wright\r\n(1948A). He has found, however, that the majority of his captive adult\r\nmales show no interest in mating when placed with females in heat. He,\r\ntherefore, uses only selected males and when a female in heat is to be\r\nbred, he places one of his responsive males with her one day, another\r\nof his responsive males with her the second day and thus alternates a\r\ncouple of males for three or four days. Even so, slightly fewer than\r\nhalf of the females which were thus bred produced young.\r\n\r\nA weasel in the white winter coat was used by Audubon and Bachman\r\n(1856:177, Quarto edit.) to drive rabbits out of their burrows in the\r\nsame fashion that ferrets commonly are used. Although these naturalists\r\nrefer to their animal as an ermine it probably was _Mustela frenata\r\nnoveboracensis_, the long-tailed weasel. The animal's teeth (probably\r\ncanines) were blunted and a long cord tied on its neck. With the aid of\r\nthis weasel 12 rabbits were caught in one morning and more than 50 in\r\nfour weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemies\r\n\r\nLittle is recorded concerning enemies of weasels and it may be that\r\nother vertebrates are not an important factor in removing the annual\r\nincrease. Errington (1935:195-198), in Iowa, found four, putrid\r\nweasels about dens of red foxes, _Vulpes fulvus_. No remains of weasels\r\nwere found in the feces of the foxes and it appears that the foxes do\r\nnot eat the weasels. The label on an adult female specimen of _M. f.\r\nspadix_ from Boone County, Iowa, bears the date May 10, 1938, and the\r\nannotation, by T. G. Scott, \"fox-killed.\" Bailey (1931:328) recounts\r\nthat \"Weller saw a coyote carrying one in its mouth\" at an elevation of\r\n11,500 feet in the Pecos Mountains of New Mexico. The type specimen, a\r\nyoung female, of _M. f. peninsulae_ from Hudsons, Florida, according to\r\nRhoads (1894:155) \". . . was caught in the woods by a cat.\" Barber and\r\nCockerell (1898:189) mention one that was killed by a dog in Mesilla\r\nPark, New Mexico. Moore (1945:258) records the death of a weasel in\r\nFlorida. Circumstantial evidence indicated that it was killed by the\r\nbite of a water moccasin. In the Biological Surveys Collection of\r\nmammals in the United States National Museum, the label with the skull\r\nof an adult male weasel, No. 160663, from Banning, California, carries\r\nthe information that the skull was taken from the stomach of a\r\n_Crotalus_ (rattlesnake).\r\n\r\nIn reporting on a study of owl predation in Delaware County,\r\nPennsylvania, Pearson and Pearson (1947:143) mention that \"weasels are\r\nfound throughout the county but . . . were never eaten by the owls.\"\r\n\r\nThe Uinta spermophile at some places and times probably is a prey\r\nsought by the long-tailed weasel but Warren (1924:265) records\r\n_Citellus armatus_ repeatedly chasing weasels in August, at Camp\r\nRoosevelt, Yellowstone National Park, and how the ground squirrels at\r\none time ignored the weasel even when it came within a few inches of a\r\nsquirrel.\r\n\r\nWarren (1932:71), on August 2, 1931, at Grand Mesa, Colorado, obtained\r\na large male weasel with two porcupine quills in it; one was near the\r\nmouth and another \"in the skull.\" Osgood (1935:156) writes that near\r\nRutland, Vermont, a male weasel \"taken in April, was heavily\r\nparasitized and had several short porcupine quills embedded in its\r\nneck, head, and shoulders.\" The remainder of Osgood's account implies\r\nthat the weasel may have turned to porcupine because the normal food\r\nfor weasels was scarce at the time. Porcupine quills, then, are a\r\nhazard for weasels although it is unlikely that the porcupine is ever\r\nto be classed as an enemy of the weasel.\r\n\r\nAn accident of another sort, which must at the very least have been\r\nannoying to the weasel that suffered it, was recorded by Soper\r\n(1921:37). The animal had a stick lodged crosswise between the fourth\r\nupper premolar teeth.\r\n\r\nThe recorded actions of several kinds of animals which are too small to\r\nbe dangerous to the weasel suggest that they recognize that the weasel\r\nis a danger to them. Borell and Ellis (1934:21) mention that a weasel\r\nin Nevada caused a great disturbance among the chipmunks. Long\r\n(1938:250) heard pikas give evidence of terror by a peculiar cry when a\r\nweasel was in a rock slide occupied by the pikas. Seton (1929 (2):629)\r\nwrites \"On June 14, 1915, as I prowled around the south side of the\r\nlake on my homeland at Greenwich, Conn., my attention was called to a\r\npair of song sparrows and a male towhee that were noisily mobbing a\r\nWeasel, twittering around and darting at him, as though they knew full\r\nwell his evil ways. The weasel paid little heed, but soon dived from\r\nsight in a stone wall.\"\r\n\r\nNo account has been found of an American weasel or ermine rolling,\r\ntumbling and frolicking in a manner that aroused the curiosity of birds\r\nto a degree which permitted the weasel to come within leaping distance\r\nof the birds. Accounts of such behavior are on record for the English\r\nstoat (ermine).\r\n\r\n\r\nFood and Hunting\r\n\r\nWeasels are active both in the daytime and at night. Whether the time\r\nof activity varies with the season, with the locality, with the sex or\r\nwith other conditions, I do not know. Adult, live, free-living,\r\nactively moving weasels that I recall having seen all were observed in\r\nthe daytime: two were in Alameda County, California, two were in White\r\nPine County, Nevada, one was in Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska, and one\r\nwas in Laramie County, Wyoming. I recall ten adults, from the same\r\nthree states, and one from Washington State, that got into my traps;\r\ntwo of these certainly got in the traps in the night; one certainly got\r\nin the trap in the daytime; the other eight were found in traps which\r\nmay have caught the weasels either in the night or in the daytime.\r\nSoper (1946:136) in speaking of _M. f. longicauda_ north of the\r\nInternational Boundary in Canada remarks that it has the \"habit to some\r\nextent of hunting at all times of day.\" Criddle and Criddle (1925:144)\r\nin writing of _Mustela frenata longicauda_ in Manitoba record that \"The\r\nshrill cry of a rabbit [_Lepus americanus_] in the dark is nearly\r\nalways due to the weasel's attack. Indeed, we have often watched the\r\nlatter at work during the twilight hours. First would come the almost\r\nnoiseless run of the small rabbit with its characteristic dodging and\r\nthis would be followed by the appearance of the agile foe which, at\r\ntimes, would leap high over obstacles and at others move swiftly\r\nbeneath them. Then there would follow intermittent cries of the rabbit\r\nas the weasel secured a temporary hold of its quarry, for be it noted\r\nthat this hunter apparently bites anywhere to begin with and it is\r\nprobable that the blood made to flow acts as an aid to tracking as well\r\nas weakening the prey. Several similar close encounters might occur\r\nbefore the rabbit would be finally overcome, but weasels are very\r\npersistent when they once get into contact with their victims and it is\r\ntherefore very seldom that the latter escape. In killing, they either\r\npenetrate the brain with their teeth, or dislodge the vertebrae behind\r\nthe head.\" These and more than two score other observations which\r\nrecord the time when weasels were seen make it clear that some were\r\nactive at night and that some were active in the daytime.\r\n\r\nAs to the routes traveled while the weasels are hunting, Quick\r\n(1944:77) says of four individuals that he studied in Washtenaw County,\r\nMichigan: \"The weasels appeared to prefer hunting certain coverts with\r\nnoticeable regularity, but rarely cruised the same area on two\r\nconsecutive nights.\"\r\n\r\nThe killing technique of fifteen captive _Mustela frenata\r\nnoveboracensis_ was studied by Glover (1943A). For the weasels he\r\nreleased 19 mice, 3 brown rats, 6 cottontails and 4 ring-necked\r\npheasants. Most of the mice were killed by a bite on the back of the\r\nhead, with the body and legs of the weasel hugging the back of the\r\nvictim. \"The weasel shoved the prey in close to the stomach with the\r\nhind legs, and the kill was made in a reclining semi-curled-up\r\nposition.\" On each of the rats (_Rattus_) an initial grip was secured\r\nat the base of the ear. When the rat rested, a new hold was taken by\r\nthe weasel. Finally the weasel secured a hold at the base of the skull\r\nand near the ear, and a light crushing sound followed. Four of the six\r\ncottontails were killed by bites on top of the head and ear; two\r\ncottontails succumbed from neck wounds. In three instances, neither of\r\ntwo weasels could be induced to make a determined attack on the\r\ncottontails or to kill them. At times the cottontails proved to be able\r\nopponents for weasels by striking out with their front feet and by\r\nkicking with their strong hind legs. In killing the pheasants the teeth\r\nof the upper jaw of the weasel pierced the top of the braincase and the\r\nteeth of the lower jaw entered the region of the auditory process. The\r\nforelegs hugged the neck of the pheasant, the body of the weasel was\r\nextended in a riding position on the back of the bird and no amount of\r\nkicking or rolling dislodged the weasel.\r\n\r\nPolderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson (1941) describe a cottontail cached by\r\na weasel as having the muscles of the neck severed from the region\r\nbehind the right mastoid process and noted \"that hemorrhage in the\r\nregion of the right jugular vein had occurred.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the methods of killing mammals smaller than cottontails, the\r\naccounts by Nichols and Nichols (1935:297-299) and that by Svihla\r\n(1931) corroborate Glover's (1943A) account, as do also the accounts of\r\nMiller (1931B:164) and Moore (1945:257). The latter says that his\r\ncaptive male, from Gainesville, Florida, customarily bit its rodent\r\nprey at the base of the skull and used the feet to manipulate the live\r\nprey. Miller (_loc. cit._) emphasized that his male weasel (_M. f.\r\nlongicauda_) grasped where it could, used its snakelike body to coil\r\nover the prey and shifted the grip of its teeth to the nape of the neck\r\nor back of the skull. The captives that I have had [one from Salt Lake\r\nCity, Utah; three from Contra Costa County, California; and the same\r\nindividual reported upon by Miller (1931:150)] customarily employed the\r\ntechniques of killing small rodents that were described by Glover and\r\nMiller (_loc. cit._).\r\n\r\nAllen (1938:225-229) experimented with the ability of four different\r\nmales of _M. f. noveboracensis_ from Michigan to kill adult\r\ncottontails. The method used was to place the weasel in a cage of\r\nquarter-inch hardware cloth approximately three feet long, two feet\r\nwide, and two feet high. The bottom of the box was covered with several\r\ninches of straw. One cottontail was offered to each weasel. In two\r\ninstances the weasel attacked and bit the cottontail, was struck by the\r\nhind feet of the cottontail, retired from the attack and died a few\r\nhours later as a result of the blows of the cottontail's hind feet. In\r\nthe other two instances the weasel rendered the cottontail helpless by\r\nsevering the neck muscles from the skull. Subsequently an incision made\r\nby the weasel, in each of the two instances gave access to blood on\r\nwhich the weasel fed until it was full, in one instance by licking\r\n\"blood as a cat laps milk.\" One rabbit was subdued in 10 minutes and\r\nthe other in 15 minutes. Allen (_op. cit._) points out that cottontails\r\nform a considerable portion of the weasel's food and thinks that they\r\nare killed in burrows more easily than they were in the cage.\r\n\r\nIn writing of the three species of weasels, including _Mustela\r\nfrenata_, found at Treesbank and vicinity, Manitoba, Norman Criddle and\r\nStuart Criddle (1925:143, 144), in my opinion, correctly explain the\r\nkilling of more prey than weasels need. \"The fact that weasels\r\nfrequently kill many more animals than they require for immediate use\r\nhas been universally interpreted as a lust for killing--a supposition\r\nwhich we believe to be quite erroneous. It is true that weasels often\r\nkill more than they need, but the surplus is not necessarily wasted\r\nbecause the animals always store it for future use, in much the same\r\nway as do badgers, minks or skunks, and with the same object in view as\r\nsquirrels have in gathering nuts. We have observed many such stores,\r\nbut as far as our observations go, the habit of killing in excess\r\noccurs much more prominently in the late summer and autumn months than\r\nin the spring. Indeed, we have no records of excessive spring slaughter\r\nand this indicates that the supposedly blood-thirsty habit of weasels\r\nis no more a lust for killing than is the woodsman's foresight in\r\nproviding his larder with meat for the winter months. It should be\r\nnoted in this connection that members of the weasel family, when\r\nundisturbed, do not leave their victims scattered about, but carefully\r\nstore them away, and in many instances the bodies are buried with earth\r\nor taken under ground to preserve them. We suspect that this instinct\r\nfor preserving food for future use accounts for most of the excessive\r\nkilling by carnivorous animals instead of this latter indicating an\r\naimless desire for slaughter which would unnecessarily deplete the food\r\nsupply of the future. This instinct, however, does not seem to be as\r\ndefinite as that of some rodents, and there is no doubt that much of\r\nthe stored meat decays before it can be utilized.\"\r\n\r\nCriddle and Criddle (1925:146) note that a weasel in the vicinity of\r\nTreesbank was carrying a rat [_Rattus_] and that \"Two small punctures\r\nin the throat were the only evidence of the manner in which its death\r\nhad been brought about.\"\r\n\r\nConsiderable information has been recorded concerning the food of\r\n_Mustela frenata_ and a little information is on record as to kinds of\r\nfoods not taken that could have been taken. For example, Ingles\r\n(1939:253, 254) on May 14, 1938, near Shasta City, California, noted\r\nthat nestlings of russet-backed thrushes were ignored by an adult\r\nweasel and four young weasels which were feeding instead on meadow mice\r\nand a mole. Howard (1935:322, 323) records that a weasel in Michigan\r\nwhich carried bits of meat from beef bones on a porch ignored a red\r\nsquirrel which drew on the same food supply but which retreated to the\r\nend of the porch when the weasel appeared. Quick (1944) records that in\r\nthe winter of 1940 on a 640 acre area in Washtenaw County, Michigan,\r\nfour resident weasels did not kill any of the 10 rabbits or several\r\npheasants but subsisted on smaller animals. Glover (1943A) thought that\r\n_M. frenata_ kills only a few adult cottontails in the wild. To judge\r\nfrom these observations, _M. frenata_ chooses small mammals as prey in\r\ngreater measure than it does birds or larger mammals.\r\n\r\nRecords of prey taken, attacked or pursued by _Mustela frenata_ include\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nBroad-footed mole (_Scapanus latimanus_).--One was fed on by an adult\r\n_M. frenata_ and four young, on May 14, 1939, \"near Shasta City,\"\r\nCalifornia (Ingles, 1939:253, 254).\r\n\r\nDusky shrew (_Sorex cinereus_).--A female weasel, at Majestic, Long\r\nIsland, N. Y., was shot when carrying a _Sorex cinereus_ that had a\r\nsmall hole in the top of its head (Nichols and Nichols, 1935:297-299).\r\n\r\nBig short-tailed shrew (_Blarina brevicauda_).--One was taken from the\r\nstomach of a weasel (Hamilton, 1928:249).\r\n\r\nTownsend ground squirrel (_Citellus townsendii_).--Alcorn saw a weasel\r\nfive miles west of Fallon, Nevada, carrying a squirrel (Hall,\r\n1946:192).\r\n\r\nRichardson ground squirrel (_Citellus richardsonii_).--The attempted\r\ncapture of one of these squirrels in Saskatchewan is recorded by Seton\r\n(1929 (2):625).\r\n\r\nBelding ground squirrel (_Citellus beldingi_).--Grinnell, Dixon and\r\nLinsdale (1937:233) recount that at Tuolumne Meadows, California, a\r\nweasel killed a ground squirrel of this species.\r\n\r\nThirteen-lined ground squirrel (_Citellus\r\ntridecemlineatus_).--Errington (1936:406, 407) found a den in Palo Alto\r\nCounty, Iowa, on June 22, 1934, where he collected 32 fecal pellets.\r\nSixteen samples contained thirteen-lined ground squirrels, 9 contained\r\nrabbits, 9 contained mice (7 _Microtus_, 1 _Peromyscus_ and 1\r\nunidentified); red-winged blackbirds and unidentified fringillids were\r\nrepresented as also were ground beetles, grasshoppers and other\r\ninsects. One red-winged blackbird lay near the entrance of the den.\r\n\r\nFranklin ground squirrel (_Citellus franklinii_).--Sowls (1948:126)\r\nrecords that at Delta, Manitoba, a weasel was observed killing one of\r\nthese squirrels and that \"the weasel had taken the squirrel from its\r\nhibernating burrow as evidenced by tracks in the snow.\" On July 19,\r\n1917, in the vicinity of Treesbank, Manitoba, T. Criddle saw a weasel\r\nattacking one of these ground squirrels which was in mortal terror and\r\nsqueaking continuously. Eventually the squirrel was thrown on its back\r\n\"and would have been speedily killed but for an interruption\" (Criddle\r\nand Criddle, 1925:146).\r\n\r\nGolden-mantled ground squirrel (_Citellus lateralis_).--On August 15,\r\n1941, along the Kaweah River in Sequoia National Park, Boyer (1943:99,\r\n100) saw a weasel chasing a _Citellus lateralis_; three or four times\r\nthe weasel grasped the back of the neck of the squirrel which each time\r\nthrew off the weasel until the two, weasel after the squirrel, plunged\r\ninto the river. The squirrel, bleeding at the base of the skull, was\r\nrescued and entered a hole; the weasel got out of the water and under a\r\nrotting log. Follett (1937:365) at 2 p.m. in Plumas County, California,\r\nsaw a weasel have hold of the lower jaw of a golden-mantled ground\r\nsquirrel near its throat. Alcorn watched a weasel chase a\r\ngolden-mantled ground squirrel in Nevada (Hall, 1946:192) and Grinnell\r\nand Dixon (1919:681) record that on August 4, 1911, near Monache\r\nMeadows in eastern Tulare County, California, a weasel pursued,\r\ncaptured and killed a golden-mantled ground squirrel.\r\n\r\nEastern chipmunk (_Tamias striatus_).--Pearce (1937:483) in central New\r\nYork State, on July 29, 1931, saw a chipmunk scamper up a tree pursued\r\nby a weasel.\r\n\r\nChipmunk (subgenus _Neotamias_).--Stanford (1931:363) on November 11,\r\n1931, at Fish Lake, Utah, saw a weasel pursuing a chipmunk. On August\r\n5, 1910, \"near Independence Lake,\" Nevada County, California, Louise\r\nKellogg recorded that a weasel seized and ran off with a chipmunk\r\n(Grinnell, Dixon and Linsdale, 1937:233). Allen (1938:228) observed\r\nthat a chipmunk (whether _Tamias striatus_ or _T. minimus_ not\r\nspecified) was killed in 30 seconds whereas 10 to 15 minutes were\r\nrequired by the caged, male _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_ to kill a\r\ncottontail.\r\n\r\nRed squirrel (_Tamiasciurus_).--Seton (1929 (2):625) records the\r\ncapture of one in Pennsylvania, and Grinnell, Dixon and Linsdale\r\n(1937:232), at Cisco, California, saw one closely pursued by a weasel.\r\n\r\nFlying squirrel (_Glaucomys_).--Burroughs (1900:77, 78) records remains\r\nof one of these squirrels along with the remains of other animals in a\r\nfood cache of a Mustela but his account does not make clear whether\r\n_Mustela frenata_ or _Mustela erminea_ was the species of weasel\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nNorthern pocket gopher (_Thomomys_).--In \"July, 1939, near Stillwater\r\n[Nevada], Alcorn pursued . . . [a] weasel and caused it to drop . . .\r\na pocket gopher [_Thomomys bottae_] which was about two-thirds grown\"\r\n(Hall, 1946:192). Grinnell, Dixon and Linsdale (1937:233) write that\r\n\"at least twice, weasels in the [Yosemite] Valley were seen carrying\r\npocket gophers.\" Relative to _Thomomys talpoides_ in the vicinity of\r\nTreesbank, Manitoba, Criddle and Criddle (1925:146) record that on\r\nSeptember 11, 1918, an individual of _Mustela frenata longicauda_ took\r\nseven pocket gophers dead. . . . It seized the rodents by the middle of\r\ntheir back and held them high while carrying them away. They were\r\nstored in a gopher burrow some two hundred yards distant. On February\r\n17, 1921, \"Came across the marks of a weasel carting some object over\r\nthe snow. An investigation revealed a recently-killed pocket gopher\r\nwith its captor still in possession.\" Criddle (1930:279), at Aweme,\r\nManitoba, \"frequently observed this weasel [_M. f. longicauda_] . . .\r\ncarrying a pocket gopher to its larder, and twice it has been\r\nencountered in mid winter with freshly killed gophers in its\r\npossession.\" The evidence already presented that weasels levy heavily\r\non pocket gophers is strengthened by the many references in the\r\nliterature to weasels having been caught in traps set for pocket\r\ngophers in the burrows of those rodents and by the many statements, not\r\nquoted here, that living quarters of weasels are in burrows made\r\noriginally by pocket gophers. For example, the present writer, in an\r\naccount of the Mammals of Nevada (Hall, 1946:191, 192), has said of the\r\nlong-tailed weasel, _Mustela frenata nevadensis_, that \"All the three\r\ndens that were excavated . . . were originally burrows of pocket\r\ngophers. . . . Although we have found weasels in many situations in\r\nNevada, . . . they most often were obtained from the burrows of pocket\r\ngophers.\" Excluding the weasels taken by Alcorn, more specimens of the\r\nremaining lot were caught in traps set in the burrows of pocket gophers\r\nthan by all other means combined. All of the 22 weasels taken by Alcorn\r\n[within a radius of 10 miles of Fallon] were obtained in gopher traps.\r\n\r\nMexican pocket gopher (_Cratogeomys_).--At Chalchicomula, 8000 feet,\r\nPuebla, Nelson (1918:470 and letter dated March 9, 1928) saw a weasel\r\nfastened to a pocket gopher. Nelson obtained the pocket gopher and\r\nfound that its neck muscles were torn loose from the skull.\r\n\r\nGrasshopper mouse (_Onychomys_).--Barber and Cockerell (1898:189) found\r\nremains of this mouse in the stomach of a weasel at Mesilla Park, New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nWhite-footed mice (_Peromyscus_).--Green (1936) saw a weasel in Gratiot\r\nCounty, Michigan, in May, carrying a _Peromyscus_. Quick (1944:76), in\r\nwinter, in Michigan, found one dead, probably killed by a weasel. From\r\nWashtenaw County, Michigan, Quick (1944:77) examined 294 scats of\r\nfree-living weasels and found _Peromyscus_ in 189 scats, _Microtus_ in\r\n83, small birds in 20, red squirrel in 3, and hair of weasels in small\r\nquantities (probably from the animals which deposited the scats) in 36.\r\nHe concludes (_op. cit._, 78) that the winter food was 65 to 70 per\r\ncent _Peromyscus_, 23 to 33 per cent _Microtus_, and 2 to 7 per cent\r\nsmall birds.\r\n\r\nWood rats (_Neotoma_).--A female long-tailed weasel weighing 250 grams\r\nwas taken one mile north of Kent, Texas, while eating a _Neotoma\r\nalbigula_ (Davis and Robertson, 1944:263). A wood rat house under\r\nobservation by Vestal (1937:364) in Contra Costa County, California,\r\nwas invaded by one weasel which ate two adult wood rats (_Neotoma\r\nfuscipes_) and one young. In the same area he saw a weasel in a wood\r\nrat nest some months later (Vestal, 1938:5). Three miles east of Reno,\r\nNevada, on May 13, 1936, W. B. Richardson watched a long-tailed weasel\r\ncarrying a half-grown round-tailed wood rat (_Neotoma lepida_) across a\r\nrock slide (Hall, 1946, 192). Harper (1927:303) records three wood rats\r\n[_Neotoma floridana_] and two cotton rats [_Sigmodon hispidus_] found\r\ndead in the den of a female weasel and her three young in the\r\nOkefinokee Swamp of Georgia. Another female and three young\r\napproximately half grown were found in the swamp in a hollow pine log.\r\nContents of the den as described to Harper were nearly a peck of wood\r\nrats, whole and in pieces; remains of several kinds of birds including\r\nrobins and quail, and a piece of joint snake (_Ophisaurus ventralis_).\r\n\r\nMeadow mice (_Microtus_).--Polderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson (1941), in\r\n1939, at Ames, Iowa, identified \"A total of 118 items . . . in 97\r\nwinter scats and 48 in the 38 spring scats.\" Their combined data are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                          Frequency      Percentage\r\n  Meadow mouse               71            42.85\r\n  Harvest mouse              36            21.75\r\n  Deer mouse                 17            10.23\r\n  Mearns cottontail          14             8.42\r\n  Short-tailed shrew          9             5.42\r\n  House mouse                 3             1.86\r\n  Tree sparrow                2             1.02\r\n  Grasshopper                 1              .60\r\n  Shaw pocket gopher          1              .60\r\n  Least weasel                9             5.40\r\n  Unidentified material       3             1.85\r\n\r\nPolderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson divide their data into two categories,\r\nwinter and spring. Items recorded in winter but not in spring are house\r\nmouse, tree sparrow, and grasshopper. Items recorded only in spring\r\nwere pocket gopher and least weasel. The samples of cottontail and\r\nleast weasel all were from the scats of one large male weasel. Of a\r\ntotal of 14 pheasants, 24 quail and 35 cottontails on the 160 acres\r\ninvolved in the study only two cottontails appear to have been killed\r\nby the weasels--really by one weasel of four which lived on the area.\r\n\r\nFood items taken from the nests (3) and adjacent caches of food in the\r\ndens, were as follows: meadow mouse, 30; short-tailed shrew, 4; pocket\r\ngopher, 2; deer mouse, 2; least weasel, 1; tree sparrow, 1. The authors\r\nremark that the abundance of several prey species does not cause the\r\nweasels to ignore the shrews which are said to be distasteful to\r\ncarnivores.\r\n\r\nTwo horned larks, apparently killed by weasels, were found on the 160\r\nacre area studied; the horned larks were not in caches of food, nor\r\nwere remains of horned larks found in scats.\r\n\r\nDearborn (1932:34, 37) for Michigan, on the basis of contents of (37?)\r\nintestinal tracts and \"feces collected partly in winter and partly in\r\nsummer\" found that, by frequency of occurrence, mammals comprised 83\r\nper cent of the food, birds 10 per cent and insects 7 per cent.\r\nFrequency indices for the genera of mammals in percentages of food\r\nitems of all kinds were as follows: _Microtus_, 31 per cent;\r\n_Peromyscus_, 24 per cent; _Sylvilagus_, 14 per cent; _Sorex_, 7 per\r\ncent; _Blarina_, 5 per cent; _Scalopus_, 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nCriddle and Criddle (1925:146), for the vicinity of Treesbank,\r\nManitoba, record that on October 3, 1913, a weasel was seen to take a\r\nfield mouse down a hole. They add (_op. cit._: 147) that \"Once while\r\nploughing, we observed a Long-tailed Weasel carrying a field\r\nmouse. . . .\" Ingles (1939:253, 254), in June, 1938, near Mt. Shasta\r\nCity, California, found an adult and four young weasels which fed on\r\nseveral _Microtus montanus montanus_. Green (1936) in May, in Gratiot\r\nCounty, Michigan, in the vicinity of a nest in which there were four\r\nyoung weasels, found \"several\" dead _Microtus_. Hamilton (1933:330)\r\nrecords that in New York State a male weasel, on April 5, 1932, at\r\nIthaca, had eaten a _Microtus_ and that in May, 1927, a female weasel\r\nwas seen carrying a _Microtus_ in its mouth.\r\n\r\nHamilton's (1933:333) study of the contents of the digestive tracts of\r\nbodies of weasels obtained from fur trappers and fur buyers enabled him\r\nto publish the following \"Frequency Indices of Mammal Genera in Fall\r\nand Winter Food of 163 _Mustela noveboracensis_\": _Microtus_, 33.6 per\r\ncent; _Sylvilagus_, 17.3; mammals undetermined to genus but principally\r\nmice, 17.1; _Peromyscus_, 11.3; _Rattus_, 9.1; _Blarina_, 5.9;\r\n_Sciurus_, 2.7; _Tamias_, 1.0; _Condylura_, 0.8; _Ondatra_, 0.8.\r\n\r\nGrinnell, Dixon and Linsdale (1937:233, 234) quote W. Fry concerning a\r\nweasel which reared six young at Giant Forest, California, in 1919, as\r\nfollows: \"This parent weasel, after the birth of her young, remained at\r\nthe premises for a period of thirty-seven days; during which time, from\r\nactual count, the following numbers of mammal species fell victim to\r\nher: mice [genera not specified] 78; gophers 27; moles 2; chipmunks 34;\r\nwood rats 3; ground squirrels 4. This is a total of 148 animals for\r\nthe . . . thirty-seven days . . . not a bird was captured during the\r\nperiod.\"\r\n\r\nRats (_Rattus_).--Criddle and Criddle (1925:146), on the farm at\r\nTreesbank, Manitoba, record a long-tailed weasel, on July 2, 1918,\r\nrunning away from the farm buildings carrying a rat; July 11, 1919,\r\n\"Two _longicaudas_ . . . have been seen running off with rats on\r\nseveral occasions.\"; July 11, 1920, \"There are two large weasels about\r\nthe buildings[;]. . . . Each has been noted with rats and this\r\nafternoon one of them was seen running into the woods carrying a rat,\r\nfollowed by two excited swallows.\" The authors (_op. cit._:147) add \"In\r\nthe fall of 1924, Mr. A. Cooper, a prominent poultryman of Treesbank,\r\nobserved a large weasel carrying a freshly killed rat which it stored\r\nbelow ground and then returned towards the poultry-house, causing no\r\nlittle apprehension to the owner. Within a short time, however, the\r\nweasel reappeared with another rat which it hid as before. In this way\r\nseveral rodents were accounted for during the afternoon, and Mr. Cooper\r\nassures us that the weasel 'kept up the good work for some days'.\"\r\nHamilton (1933:330) in New York State in May, 1927, saw a male weasel\r\nin possession of a rat.\r\n\r\nBig jumping mouse (_Zapus major_).--In the Warner Mountains of\r\nCalifornia, on Parker Creek, H. C. Bryant frightened a weasel that\r\ndropped a freshly killed jumping mouse (Grinnell, Dixon and Linsdale,\r\n1937:232).\r\n\r\nSnowshoe rabbit (_Lepus americanus_).--Adolph Murie (1935:321-322)\r\nwrites that: \"Four miles north of Funkley, Minnesota, early on the\r\nmorning of November 13, 1921, . . . watched from the top of a 30-foot\r\nspruce a weasel. .. hunting a varying hare. . . . The ground was\r\ncovered with six inches of fresh snow . . . both animals . . . [had]\r\ntheir [white] winter pelage.\r\n\r\n\"My attention was first attracted to the hare as it came hopping\r\nsteadily but unhurriedly from the north. Directly in front of me, about\r\n75 feet from the tree I had climbed, the hare crisscrossed back and\r\nforth at various angles over an open area about 20 feet in diameter.\r\nAfter producing a maze of tracks, the hare 'froze' near one edge of the\r\npattern. In a few minutes the weasel appeared, all his faculties\r\nfocused on the warm trail. Expertly he followed its convolutions,\r\npassing at times within a few feet of the watching hare. Not until the\r\nweasel had followed every turn of the trail to within three feet of its\r\ntermination did the hare skip off. It came out to the road almost\r\ndirectly below me, turned at right angles northward and was soon out of\r\nsight. At the road the weasel lost the trail, . . . and then ran\r\nparallel with it, once more in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes later the hare emerged from the north as before, came on\r\ndirectly to the tracked-up area, and continuing its stratagem,\r\nleisurely hopped about to leave its zigzag trail. Then it sat down\r\nquietly to wait. . . . The weasel['s] . . . nose led him through the\r\nnetwork with little trouble. He was almost upon the hare before it\r\njumped off and followed the same path [as] . . . before. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The hare had to show his big heels [a third time] . . . as the weasel\r\napproached him. This time the weasel failed to follow. . . . After\r\nexamining a few brush heaps he vanished into the woods behind me.\"\r\n\r\nSeton (1929 (4):723, 724) writes that in December of 1886 in the\r\nsandhills northeast of Carberry, Manitoba, he saw a weasel chasing a\r\nsnowshoe rabbit which took refuge near his feet under the sleigh and so\r\nescaped the weasel. Thurber (1940:356) mentions a month-old varying\r\nhare that was rescued from a weasel and of approximately the same size\r\nas the weasel.\r\n\r\nCriddle and Criddle (1925:146) for the vicinity of Treesbank, Manitoba,\r\nrecord \"August 21, 1921.--Heard cries of a small rabbit at dusk\r\nto-night, which investigation showed was being attacked by a large\r\nweasel. The rabbit was later carried to the weasel's store chamber\r\nbelow ground.\" They record further (_op. cit._, 146, 147): \"November 8,\r\n1924.--Shot a bush rabbit and left it lying. Two hours later [it] . . .\r\nwas found to have been dragged beneath a brush pile and partly eaten.\r\nInnumerable weasel tracks left no doubt as to the identity of the\r\nthief.\" In describing a weasel that wintered in a nest in a threshing\r\nmachine, the same authors (_op. cit._:143) say that no bird remains\r\nwere found in the pile of approximately three pounds of droppings\r\nadjacent to the nest. In a store chamber some 140 yards away from the\r\nnest, two bush rabbits (_Lepus americanus_) had been dragged to the\r\nentrance and numerous smaller rodents were taken below ground. The\r\nrabbits were buried beneath the snow and eaten as necessity arose.\r\nNarrow selectivity on the part of the weasel in choosing food is almost\r\nalways shown in instances where the food of weasels has been studied.\r\nFor example, the weasel which lived in the threshing machine ate\r\nrodents and rabbits and not poultry although the weasel had ready\r\naccess to the poultry building. The weasel which lived in the bag of\r\nfeathers in the basement of Stuart Criddle's house ignored grouse,\r\napproximately 20 in number, in favor of other non-avian food.\r\n\r\nCottontail (_Sylvilagus_).--Polderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson (1941)\r\nmention that one of 4 weasels which they studied on a 160 acre area at\r\nAmes, Iowa, in 1939, had a cache of food in a pocket gopher burrow 10\r\nrods distant from the weasel's den. The cache contained only two\r\ncottontails, one partly eaten. Leopold (1937) records seeing a\r\n_Mustela_ (probably a long-tailed weasel but possibly an ermine) kill a\r\nthird-grown cottontail by biting it at the base of the skull. Leopold\r\ndescribes the blood sucking or licking, suggesting that he shared the\r\npopular misconception that weasels suck blood. The supposition that\r\nweasels suck blood has been refuted by many observers, for example by\r\nSvihla (1931). My own observation of captives makes me think that\r\nweasels do not suck blood. Seton (1929 (2):626) quotes B. H. Warren as\r\nseeing a weasel dragging a freshly killed, still warm, rabbit that\r\ncontained nine embryos almost ready for birth. A young rabbit was seen\r\nbeing carried by a weasel in Hidalgo County, Texas, in March, 1935\r\n(Mulaik, 1938:104). An instance of a cottontail being chased in June in\r\nSouth Carolina is recorded by Hamilton (1933:330). Addy (1939:372,\r\n373), in Virginia, on August 14, 1939, shot a large weasel which was\r\npursuing a _Sylvilagus_ that was only a foot and a half ahead of the\r\nweasel. The rabbit stopped when a shot was fired and permitted itself\r\nto be stroked and petted. Tracking showed that the weasel had chased\r\nthe rabbit for a half mile. On November 20, 1942, at Lake James,\r\nIndiana, a weasel was seen by Grosjean (1942:443) attacking a \"young\r\nrabbit\" in the throat of which the weasel had made five large holes\r\nfrom which there was no obvious bleeding. Seton (1929 (4):798) recounts\r\nthat in 1910 at Base Lake, Michigan, F. C. Hicks saw a cottontail with\r\na weasel hanging to its legs rush to the cottage. When only four feet\r\nfrom Hicks the weasel loosed its hold and the cottontail escaped under\r\nthe cottage. Burroughs (1939:253) on May 14, 1939, in Saginaw County,\r\nMichigan, records that a young cottontail weighing between 200 and 250\r\ngrams was carried from the nest and killed. Burroughs was attracted\r\nfirst by the \"hissing scream\" of the weasel, strode toward the sound,\r\nflushed an adult cottontail, and discovered the empty nest from which\r\nthe weasel had taken the young cottontail.\r\n\r\nBrush rabbit (_Sylvilagus bachmani_).--Vestal (1937:364) in Contra\r\nCosta County, California, found a brush rabbit that appeared to have\r\nbeen killed by a weasel.\r\n\r\nReptiles.--Grinnell, Dixon and Linsdale (1937:234) recount that in\r\nJuly, 1889, in Wilson Canyon, near Pasadena, California, a weasel\r\nkilled a red racer by severing the backbone of the snake. In April,\r\n1935, in Hidalgo County, Texas, a half grown bull snake (_Pituophis\r\nsayi sayi_) was regurgitated by a young weasel. Russell (1930:504, 505)\r\nhas recorded finding in California a male weasel and a king snake\r\n(Lampropeltis getulus boylii) three feet five inches long in mortal\r\ncombat. The weasel killed the snake but the weasel, incapacitated by\r\nthe conflict, was easily picked up by hand and was also saved as a\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nWild birds.--In the spring of 1940, in Washtenaw County, Michigan, one\r\nbobwhite, of 10 bobwhite living on a 640 acre area, was killed by one\r\nof four weasels that lived on the area. No other quail was killed\r\nthere. The one unfortunate bird was killed in the mouth of an abandoned\r\nden where the quail roosted (Quick, 1944:76). A male weasel, subspecies\r\n_M. f. effera_, was seen by Booth (1946:439) attempting to enter the\r\nnesting hole of a pair of flickers, _Colaptes_. One song sparrow\r\n(_Melospiza melodia_), and one slate-colored junco (_Junco hyemalis_)\r\nwere recorded by Quick (1944:76) as killed by weasel in Michigan.\r\n\r\nChicken (genus _Gallus_).--Quick (1944:78) writes that in one year\r\n(1938-1939) weasels were reported to have killed 1.03 per cent of all\r\nchickens in one township of Washtenaw County, Michigan, and that of the\r\ntotal damage to all kinds of poultry, 59 per cent was done by weasels.\r\nWeasels entered 19 per cent of the chicken coops on the study area.\r\nFarmers killed 68 per cent of the weasels seen in barn yards. Spring\r\nand summer were the seasons in which most of the weasels were observed\r\nin barn yards. Internal evidence in Quick's (_op. cit._) account leads\r\nme to suspect that some losses of poultry were charged to weasels when\r\n_Rattus_ was actually responsible.\r\n\r\nCriddle and Criddle (1925:146), quote a neighbor in the vicinity of\r\nTreesbank, Manitoba, as recording that on October 29, 1917, \"A weasel\r\nlast night made its way into our fowl-house, the door being\r\ninadvertently left open. The weasel killed eleven fowl, some of which\r\nwere dragged into the yard. All the largest fowls were selected, the\r\npullets remaining untouched though they were in the majority. Next\r\nnight the weasel dug a hole beneath the building and killed a hen and\r\ntwo cocks, returning for another during the day, making a total of\r\nfourteen in all.\" Criddle and Criddle (1925:146) remark that the weasel\r\nproved to be a large one, probably an old male. The same authors (_op.\r\ncit._:147) record that at their farm at Treesbank, Manitoba, on January\r\n31, 1925, \"A Long-tailed Weasel killed three hens last night, and\r\nrather severely bit a cock about the neck. This, or another weasel, had\r\nbeen around the farm-yard for sometime (The specimen was a large\r\nmale). . . .\r\n\r\n\"In the fall of 1924, Mr. A. Cooper, a prominent poultryman of\r\nTreesbank, observed a large weasel carrying a freshly killed rat which\r\nit stored below ground and then returned towards the poultry-house,\r\ncausing no little apprehension to the owner. Within a short time,\r\nhowever, the weasel reappeared with another rat which it hid as before.\r\nIn this way several rodents were accounted for during the afternoon,\r\nand Mr. Cooper assures us that the weasel 'kept up the good work for\r\nsame days'.\r\n\r\n\"Being a farmer of many years' standing, Mr. Cooper has naturally lost\r\nsome poultry through the agency of weasels, but while he remarks that\r\n'there are good as well as bad actors among weasels', he has the\r\npractical good sense to recognize the value of an efficient ratter even\r\nthough it be a weasel.\r\n\r\n\"Our sister, Maida Criddle, writes under date of March 4, 1925:\r\n\r\n\"'There is another weasel (_longicauda_) in the fowl-house, a\r\nwell-behaved one this time. It came and took a piece of meat out of my\r\nhand quite nicely, which it carried down a hole and then came and\r\nsniffed all over my mitt to see if there was any more. I thought it had\r\nbeen killed when I visited the farm buildings next day as there was a\r\nstrong smell of musk on the cat and in the fowl house, but the weasel\r\nwas there as cheeky as ever. It got hold of my skirt twice and tried to\r\npull me down its hole. I think it wanted the cloth for a bed, as it was\r\ntaking straw and other material down the burrow. The poultry were very\r\nfrightened at first, but they are getting used to the weasel's presence\r\nnow'.\"\r\n\r\nIn commenting on the economic role of the long-tailed weasel in\r\nManitoba, Criddle and Criddle (1925:145) write as follows: \"Supply and\r\ndemand are prominent factors in governing our weasels' food habits. The\r\ntwo smaller species, as we have already pointed out are so dependent\r\nupon mice for a living that they increase or diminish with the\r\nfluctuation of these creatures. The Long-tailed Weasel, however, is not\r\nso easily checked by the temporary disappearance of any particular kind\r\nof game. If mice are scarce it devotes greater attention to gophers or\r\nbush rabbits and if these are not in sufficient numbers to satisfy its\r\nappetite, the animal raids a poultry house as a last resource. In nine\r\nyears out of ten, this weasel will find sufficient food about the\r\nfields and woods, but on the tenth it may be obliged to temporarily\r\nturn to domestic animals. It is at such times that the weasel is seen\r\nand its deeds recorded. A thousand mice may have been killed in the\r\nmeantime, but the destruction of half a dozen hens is alone used as\r\nevidence of the weasel's economic standing.\r\n\r\n\"In the last twenty years we have permitted weasels to frequent the\r\nfarm buildings at will and the poultry house has been no exception. In\r\nthat time rats and mice suffered severely from the weasels, while the\r\ntotal number of poultry taken were six. Many times that number,\r\nhowever, have been killed by rats.\r\n\r\n\"When we review our experiences of the past, we are astonished to find\r\nwhat few poultry have been killed by weasels. Our own losses in\r\nforty-two years have not exceeded fifteen birds and even these were\r\nusually eatable. There have been reports of losses from time to time\r\nfrom neighbors, but on looking into details we find that there are very\r\nfew farmers who have experienced more than three separate occasions of\r\nweasel depredation and the total loss per farmer in the last thirty\r\nyears does not, we are sure, exceed ten birds. This is surely a\r\nremarkably small payment to weasels in general for the great good done\r\nby them in killing rodents.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to point out, too, that only the exceptional weasel becomes a\r\npoultry killer. In most cases apparently it is a fully-grown male that\r\ndoes the killing. There are exceptions, of course, but when we see a\r\nlarge weasel actively engaged in rodent hunting within a few feet of a\r\nbrood of newly hatched chickens and not even looking at them, we must\r\nat least pause to ask if this animal is the enemy that we were taught\r\nto believe it to be.\"\r\n\r\nA suggestion that weasels sometimes obtain the prey killed by hawks is\r\noffered by Criddle and Criddle (1925:147) who write: \"Hawks are not\r\nalways the aggressors, as is shown by an incident reported by Mr. H.\r\nL. Seamans, of Lethbridge, Alberta. Mr. Seamans noted a large buzzard\r\nsuddenly fly straight upwards from a fence post, and then alight upon\r\nanother one some distance away. A little while afterward this bird once\r\nmore arose in the same manner as before, and presently repeated the\r\nperformance again. An investigation then followed and revealed that a\r\nLong-tailed Weasel was following the hawk from post to post.\r\n\r\n\"We should hardly expect a weasel to attempt to capture a bird of the\r\nabove type. On the other hand, it is possible that these animals might\r\nbe able to startle a hawk sufficiently to cause it to drop its prey,\r\nwhich would thus provide food for the weasel.\"\r\n\r\nThe following frequency index is compiled from the foregoing data on\r\nprey of _Mustela frenata_.\r\n\r\n  Moles (family _Talpidae_), 5\r\n  Shrews (family _Soricidae_), 26\r\n  Pigmy weasel (_Mustela rixosa_), 1\r\n  Ground squirrels (genus _Citellus_), 23\r\n  Chipmunks (genus _Tamias_), 38\r\n  Tree squirrel (possibly all _Tamiasciurus_), 8\r\n  Flying squirrel (genus _Glaucomys_), 1\r\n  Pocket gophers (family _Geomyidae_), 34\r\n  Mice (order _Rodentia_), 96\r\n  Harvest mice (genus _Reithrodontomys_), 36\r\n  Grasshopper mouse (genus _Onychomys_), 1\r\n  Deer mice (genus _Peromyscus_), 235\r\n  Cotton rat (genus _Sigmodon_), 2\r\n  Wood rats (genus _Neotoma_), 14\r\n  Meadow mice (genus _Microtus_), 248\r\n  Muskrat (genus _Ondatra_), 1\r\n  Old World rats (genus _Rattus_), 19\r\n  House mouse (genus _Mus_), 1\r\n  Jumping mouse (genus _Zapus_), 5\r\n  Varying hare (_Lepus americanus_), 5\r\n  Rabbits (genus _Sylvilagus_), 48\r\n  small birds, 32\r\n  chickens, 17\r\n  lizard, 1\r\n  snakes, 4\r\n  insects, 3\r\n\r\nMore significant than the above compilation, of course, are the results\r\nof careful studies of the food of the long-tailed weasel in restricted\r\nareas. Examples of such studies are those of Polderboer, Kuhn and\r\nHendrickson (1941) and Hamilton (1933:333).\r\n\r\nAccording to Hamilton's (1933:332) observations on captive weasels,\r\n\"There seems to be little relative difference in the amount they eat,\r\nregardless of their activities.\r\n\r\n\"In general, more food is taken in summer than in winter. Usually about\r\na third their weight every 24 hours is eaten, but a growing young\r\nweasel will consume much more. A young male _noveboracensis_, weighing\r\n145 grams, consumed an entire chipmunk, fur and bones, weighing 85\r\ngrams, in 24 hours. A day later it ate all of a partly grown rat, 105\r\ngrams, in the same length of time.\"\r\n\r\nMoore (1945:253) records that a captive male that he obtained at\r\nGainesville, Florida, consumed, on the average, between 63 and 70 grams\r\nof flesh and blood per day. The weasel itself weighed approximately 320\r\ngrams.\r\n\r\nSanderson (1949:413), concerning seven young weasels from Manitoba,\r\nthat he raised in captivity, writes: \"From the fifth to the seventh\r\nweek of age, they consumed approximately 22 per cent of their body\r\nweight per day; from the eighth to the tenth week (just before reaching\r\nmature size) they consumed approximately 24 per cent; but after\r\nreaching maturity they consumed only 18 per cent. When given all the\r\nfood they would take in one day, they ate as much as 40 per cent of\r\ntheir body weight.\"\r\n\r\nCriddle and Criddle (1925:143, 146) say that weasels drinking at a bird\r\ntrough \"held their mouths very close to the water and as far as we\r\ncould see, lapped the liquid up with rapid movements of the tongue. As\r\na rule, after drinking, they would merely spring to the ground and\r\nvanish amid a bunch of scolding birds, but occasionally we have seen an\r\nanimal slowly drag itself through the water and follow this performance\r\nby some rapid gambols, or a quick run, a method of drying which most of\r\nus have practiced in our youth.\" According to Hamilton's (1933:332)\r\nobservations on captives, \"Weasels are great drinkers, and while they\r\ntake but little at a time, about 25 c.c. is drunk by a large animal\r\nduring a day. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduction\r\n\r\nPhilip L. Wright's several papers (1942A, 1942B, 1947, 1948A, and\r\n1948B) reporting on his detailed studies of _Mustela frenata_\r\n(subspecies _oribasus_ and _longicauda_) in captivity have yielded a\r\nlarge share of the precise information that we have concerning breeding\r\nand reproduction in this species. He has found that a single litter, of\r\nup to 9 young is born in the spring, usually in April. At three months\r\nof age the females \"are full grown.\" The young males remain sexually\r\nimmature during the first summer but the young females, as well as the\r\nfemales which are more than a year old, come into heat in the midsummer\r\nand are bred by the adult males. After a long period of quiescence\r\nlasting for several months, the embryos resulting from these matings\r\nbecome active in early spring and develop to full term in less than 27\r\ndays after they become implanted. The adult males are sexually active\r\nfrom April into August, when the testes are at maximal size and are\r\nconspicuous in the scrotum. A gradual regression takes place starting\r\nin August and extending into September. By October the testes may be\r\nfully regressed and the molt to white may start in this month. The\r\nwhite winter weasel, of either sex, is sexually inactive. The testes of\r\nthe sexually active male in early spring and late summer are seven to\r\neight times the size of the fully regressed testes. Females which had\r\nborne and suckled young were first found to be in oestrus 65 to 104\r\ndays after birth of the young. Lactation lasts for approximately 5\r\nweeks. In 18 litters the length of the gestation period varied from 220\r\nto 337 days with an average of 279 days. The female in heat has the\r\nvulva much swollen and she will remain in this condition for several\r\nweeks if not bred. Wright (1948A) describes the actual mating as\r\nbeginning with a scuffle after which the male grabs the female by the\r\nscruff of the neck with his teeth and holds her until she becomes\r\nsubdued when he clasps her lower abdomen with his front feet and arches\r\nhis back over her posterior regions. The two animals remain locked in\r\nthis position usually for two hours and sometimes for longer than three\r\nhours. If the animals are left together, copulation may take place\r\nagain on the same day or upon succeeding days.\r\n\r\nHamilton (1933:316-321) writes of a freshly born _M. f. noveboracensis_\r\nthat it \". . . was pink and much wrinkled. The wetness . . . did not\r\nentirely obscure a few sparse, rather long, white hairs . . . over its\r\nback and head. It had the pronounced and extraordinarily long neck of\r\nthe adult.\" At one day of age the average weight of six individuals in\r\nthe litter was 3.1 grams, which is 3 per cent of the weight of the\r\nadult female and 1-1/2 per cent of the weight of an adult male. At two\r\nweeks of age \"The silky white hair . . . obscures the general flesh\r\ncolor of the skin, evident a week earlier. The hair on the back of the\r\nhead and neck, also over the shoulders, is slightly longer than that of\r\nthe back . . .\" but there is no crest or mane or pompadour at this or\r\nany other age such as characterizes the juvenal ermine. When 21 days\r\nold one young male \"hurried from the nest chamber and commenced to eat\r\nsome meat.\" At three and a half weeks \"They are all eating small pieces\r\nof meat. . . . The canine teeth have made their appearance in both the\r\nupper and lower jaw, but just a hint of the incisors show. Some of the\r\ncheek teeth are through, as the meat appears to be thoroughly\r\nmasticated by the little ones.\" On the 36th and 37th days the eyes\r\nopened. Sanderson (1949:415) found that a litter of seven young of\r\n_Mustela frenata longicauda_, from Manitoba, raised in captivity,\r\n\"reached the peak of their growth\" at approximately ten weeks of age.\r\n\r\nSeveral nests have been found. In Manitoba, Sanderson (1949:412)\r\nexcavated a burrow at the mouth of which he had trapped the adult\r\nfemale and in which he found eight young approximately five weeks old.\r\nThe \"burrow was about three inches in diameter, with two chambers at a\r\ndepth of twelve inches. One of these was empty, the other contained the\r\nyoung. The two surface-openings were but two feet apart and the entire\r\nburrow was no more than three feet long. . . . The meager nest\r\nmaterial consisted entirely of finely chopped grass. There was no mouse\r\nhair present, no accumulation of fecal material, and no storehouse\r\ncontaining food.\"\r\n\r\nCharles O. Handley has written me that on January 25, 1929, on the\r\nSinkola Plantation, Thomas County, Georgia, he investigated the living\r\nquarters of a family of five weasels, four of which had been shot five\r\ndays before by a hunter. According to the hunter each of the four which\r\nhad been killed was approximately two-thirds the size of one which\r\nescaped into a hole in the ground. Handley found that the weasels had\r\nbeen using as headquarters a burrow in the trunk of an old uprooted oak\r\nas well as a nearby gopher burrow. The burrow in the oak was\r\napproximately ten feet long and had been excavated in the rotten wood.\r\nIn a distance of fifty feet along the gopher tunnel there were several\r\nused openings with pathways leading away from each. On February 6,\r\nHandley, with the help of a friend, trapped a large male weasel near\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nCriddle and Criddle (1925:143) describe a female which, one winter,\r\nslept in a bag of feathers in a basement of a house occupied by one of\r\nthe authors; another weasel in winter made its headquarters in a\r\nthreshing machine. The nest of the latter \"was somewhat roughly\r\nconstructed and consisted of a convenient bunch of straw and chaff\r\nunder the cylinder.\"\r\n\r\nHarper (1927:303) in the Okefinokee Swamp of Georgia dislodged a weasel\r\nfrom the house of a wood rat and was told of a den found in the swamp\r\n\"in the trunk of a hollow cypress tree\" from which a mother weasel and\r\nthree young \"about the size of mice\" were obtained. \"The bed contained,\r\nI suppose, a bushel or more of rabbit hair, rat hair, and squirrel\r\nhair. It looked like it must have been used as a den for several years,\r\nalthough there was no stink that I could detect except the musk from\r\nthe old Weasel.\" Another female and three young approximately half\r\ngrown were found in a hollow pine log.\r\n\r\nBetween January 6 and April 12, 1940, on 640 acres of land, in\r\nWashtenaw County, Michigan, four weasels were studied and each weasel\r\nused only one den in this period (Quick, 1944:78). Criddle (1930:279)\r\nremarks that _M. f. longicauda_ at Aweme, Manitoba, often makes its\r\ntemporary headquarters in the burrows of pocket gophers (_Thomomys_). A\r\nfemale and three young weasels were found by Shaw (1921:167) using a\r\nnest of a mountain beaver in the burrow of that animal. Green (1936),\r\nin May, in Gratiot County, Michigan, saw a weasel enter a hole under a\r\ndecayed log and investigated finding four young weasels in a nest\r\nmostly of _Microtus_ fur.\r\n\r\nIn the early part (winter and spring) of 1939, at Ames, Iowa,\r\nPolderboer, Kuhn and Hendrickson (1941) studied four weasels living in\r\nfour separate dens on 160 acres typical of Iowa farmland and excavated\r\nthree of the dens. One den was in a weed patch in an old mole run. The\r\nnest chamber, approximately nine inches in diameter and six inches\r\nbelow the surface of the ground \"was filled with grasses packed in a\r\nlayer-like formation. In the center of this mass was a nest hollow\r\nlined with patches of mouse and shrew fur. Beneath this layer of fur\r\nand at the sides of the nest were skins, various bones, and skulls of\r\npartially eaten mice and shrews . . . scats [were in the nest]. . . .\r\nAt intervals, layers of clean grass had been laid over the filth of the\r\nformer bed, thus giving the nest a stratified appearance.\" A second\r\nden, of a large male, was in a field of sweet clover two feet high in\r\nthe former burrow of a Franklin's ground squirrel. The nest cell, seven\r\ninches in diameter and nine inches below the surface of the ground,\r\n\"was lined with grasses mixed with much rabbit and mouse fur. Some\r\nscats, and bones and fur of mice and shrews were matted together in\r\nlayers at the bottom of the nest.\" When this den was abandoned the male\r\nweasel occupied, for a month, another burrow, 20 rods distant, of a\r\nFranklin ground squirrel, in the field of sweet clover. The nest cell\r\nmeasured 11 by nine inches and was 11 inches below the surface of the\r\nground. \"Two nest layers were present. The first, composed chiefly of\r\ncoarse straw and grass, had apparently been occupied at some time by a\r\nspotted skunk. . . . On top of the skunk nest was the weasel nest\r\ncomposed of fine grasses, mouse fur, and skeletal remains of mice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRelation of the Sexes to each other and to the young\r\n\r\nQuick (1944:75) writes that on March 28, in Michigan, he found the\r\ntracks of a male and those of a smaller animal, supposedly a female,\r\nmeeting. The two \"then led along the fence for about 18 chains and both\r\nentered the den of the male. . . . Only the tracks of the smaller\r\nweasel left the den on the same date. Observation on April 12 showed\r\nthat the large male still occupied the den.\" I am at a loss to explain\r\nthis behavior since breeding would not be expected to occur in late\r\nMarch and since I suppose that the male and female do not live\r\ntogether except in the breeding season. Consequently, I wonder if the\r\nsign was wrongly read.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.

During mid-May, 1927, I\r\nseveral times saw a male of this species carrying food to a den of\r\nyoung ones.\" Green (1936), in May in Gratiot County, Michigan, remarks\r\nthat while he was uncovering and examining a nest of four young\r\nweasels, two adults ran about excitedly and one removed a young weasel.\r\nIn instances where several nearly full-grown young have been obtained\r\nfrom one den it has been my experience (Hall, 1946:191) that the only\r\nadult trapped there was the female; no adult male was found or in the\r\none instance when found he was living alone in a den 200 yards away\r\nfrom the den of the female and her young. Data are too few to warrant a\r\ndefinite conclusion about the extent to which the male aids in rearing\r\nthe young, but I have wondered if he might not do so when the young\r\nwere less than half grown and then live alone when they were more than\r\nhalf grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela frenata noveboracensis= (Emmons)\r\n\r\nLong-tailed Weasel\r\n\r\nPlates 16, 17, 18, 31, 32 and 33\r\n\r\n    _Putorius Noveboracensis_ Emmons, Quadrupeds of Massachusetts, p.\r\n      45, 1840.\r\n\r\n    _Mustela fusca_ DeKay, Zool. of New York, Pt. 1, Mammalia, p. 34,\r\n      1842.\r\n\r\n    _Putorius fuscus_ Audubon and Bachman, Journ.

Weight of 19\r\n     adult males from New York (Hamilton, 1933:294), 225 (196-267)\r\n     grams and in 13 adult females, 102 (72-126) grams. Weights of 2\r\n     adults from Michigan are: [M] 258; [F] 101 grams.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black, brown, or white\r\n     (often all three colors in same specimen) and extending beyond\r\n     ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts and extending to\r\n     apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of foot-soles as shown in\r\n     figure 19.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Upper parts, in summer, Vandyke Brown or darker than\r\n     tone 4 of Burnt Umber of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 304.\r\n     Sometimes approaching tone 2 of Warm Sepia of Oberthür and\r\n     Dauthenay, pl. 305. Underparts, in summer, ranging from white\r\n     through Napthalene Yellow (Peterboro, N. Y.), Pale Orange Yellow\r\n     (eastern Mass.), near Primuline Yellow (unusual specimen from\r\n     Leelanau Co., Mich.) to near (_c_) Deep Chrome (no. 19053, U. S.\r\n     Nat. Mus., Roan Mts., N.

In winter, all white except tip of\r\n     tail, or upper parts near (12\" 1) Rood's Brown and tone 2 of Raw\r\n     Umber of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 301, with underparts white or\r\n     sometimes tinged with yellowish. Tip of tail at all times black.\r\n     Upper parts of uniform color except for occasional slight\r\n     darkening of nose. Color of underparts extends distally on\r\n     posterior sides of forelegs to foot and sometimes over upper sides\r\n     of toes and on medial sides of hind limbs only to knees. Least\r\n     width of color of underparts averaging, in a series of twenty-two\r\n     males, mostly in full winter pelage, from Liberty Hill,\r\n     Connecticut, 21 (11-40) per cent of greatest width of color of\r\n     underparts. In eleven females from the same place, corresponding\r\n     percentages are 20 (14-29). Black tip of tail in same series of\r\n     males, most of which are in full winter pelage, 70 (60-75) mm.\r\n     long; thus longer than hind foot and averaging 50 per cent of\r\n     length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on ten adults from Massachusetts):\r\n     See measurements and plates 16-18; weight, 3.6 (3.3-4.4) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 44.6 (43.3-46.0); zygomatic breadth less than\r\n     distance between condylar foramen and Ml or than between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid\r\n     breadth less than postpalatal length; postorbital breadth more or\r\n     less than length of upper premolars and greater than width of\r\n     basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen lacerum\r\n     posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth more or less\r\n     (usually more) than distance between foramen opticum and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum less than length of\r\n     tympanic bulla; least width of palate less than length of P4;\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen\r\n     ovale as width of 3 to 6 upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla\r\n     more or less than distance from its anterior margin to foramen\r\n     ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar\r\n     and premolar tooth-row and longer or shorter than rostrum;\r\n     anterior margin of masseteric fossa behind or directly below\r\n     posterior fourth of m1.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on five adults from Mass.): See measurements and\r\n     plates 31-33; weight, 1.7 (1.2-2.1) grams; basilar length, 36.5\r\n     (35.2-38.1); zygomatic breadth less than distance between condylar\r\n     foramen and M1 or than between anterior palatine foramen and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla; postorbital breadth more or\r\n     less than length of upper premolars and more than width of\r\n     basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen lacerum\r\n     posterior to its opposite; least width of palate more or less\r\n     (usually less) than greatest length of P4; tympanic bulla as far\r\n     posterior to foramen ovale as width of 4 to 5-1/2 upper incisors;\r\n     height of tympanic bulla less than distance from its anterior\r\n     margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length\r\n     of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and longer than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 53 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the average male.\r\n\r\nComparisons of the skull with those of _M. f. olivacea_, _M. f.\r\nspadix_, _M. f. primulina_, and _M. f. arthuri_, are made in the\r\naccounts of those subspecies. As compared with that of _M. f. occisor_\r\nthe skull of adult male _noveboracensis_, is of smaller average size\r\nwith relatively (to basilar length of Hensel) lesser mastoid and\r\nzygomatic breadths. In addition to the zygomatic arches of\r\n_noveboracensis_ being less widely bowed outward they seem to be more\r\nrounded posteriorly. Comparisons of subadult females indicate that\r\nthese differences exist in the females as well as in the adult males.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The earliest of the post-Linnaean references to this weasel\r\nmostly were under the specific name _erminea_ in the belief that the\r\nAmerican animal was the same as the larger of the two common species of\r\nweasel in the Old World. The name _noveboracensis_, now in use for this\r\nsubspecies, was applied in 1840 and since that time the males usually\r\nhave borne that name; the females, because they are smaller, were more\r\nfrequently confused with some other species. Audubon and Bachman in\r\n1853 even proposed the name _agilis_ for the female in the mistaken\r\nbelief that it was a species distinct from the male. After 1896, when\r\nBangs correctly classified the weasels of the eastern United States,\r\nthe males have been correctly identified and the females, except by a\r\nfew authors, likewise have been correctly named. Because many early\r\nAmerican naturalists did their first collecting of mammals in the\r\ngeographic range of _noveboracensis_, the person who examines labels of\r\nspecimens of this subspecies can find data written in the hand of\r\nSpencer Fullerton Baird, Theodore Roosevelt, and other naturalists\r\nfamous for their work as scientists or accomplishments otherwise. The\r\nmaterial is more nearly adequate than is that of many other subspecies\r\nand the number of specimens is exceeded--and only slightly--by that of\r\nthe subspecies _nevadensis_, which like _noveboracensis_ has a\r\nrelatively large geographic range.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _Mustela frenata spadix_ is indicated by subadult\r\nmales from western Wisconsin, namely, one from Gordon, three from\r\nColfax and one from Meridean. Linear measurements of the teeth of these\r\nspecimens are exactly intermediate between those of _spadix_ from Elk\r\nRiver, Minnesota, to the west, and _noveboracensis_ from, say, Beaver\r\nDam, Wisconsin, to the east. The specimens from western Wisconsin show\r\napproach to spadix also in that the length of the tooth-rows and\r\nbreadth of the rostrum are slightly greater than in _noveboracensis_\r\nfrom farther east, say, Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIndeed, animals from as far east as Beaver Dam itself might be thought\r\nof as showing some approach to _spadix_. Although, along the eastern\r\nseaboard, the upper lips, with rare exceptions, are the same color as\r\nthe underparts, farther west, in Michigan and Wisconsin, the lips more\r\noften than not are white. Animals from Beaver Dam have slightly shorter\r\nblack tips on the tails, broader extent of the light color of the\r\nunderparts and females average slightly larger than typical\r\n_noveboracensis_, say, those from Massachusetts. Each of these\r\ndifferences reflects characters found better developed in the\r\n_spadix-longicauda_ stock to the west.\r\n\r\nToward the southern part of its range where _noveboracensis_ meets _M.\r\nf. olivacea_ there is a marked increase in yellowness of the\r\nunderparts. This coloration of the underparts, since it is not so well\r\nmarked in the northern part of the range of _noveboracensis_, might be\r\nregarded as showing intergradation with _olivacea_ and _primulina_,\r\neach of which has far more intensely colored underparts than does\r\n_noveboracensis_. Excepting this increase of yellow on the underparts,\r\nhowever, there are few if any characters of _noveboracensis_ which\r\nundergo marked change as approach to the range of _olivacea_ is made.\r\nIndeed, the characters of _noveboracensis_ remain constant to within a\r\nrelatively short distance of the geographic range of _olivacea_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the state of affairs described above, intergradation\r\nseems to take place. Three specimens referred to _noveboracensis_ but\r\nwhich at the same time are regarded as intergrades with _olivacea_ are\r\nas follows: No. 28.300, Charleston Museum, from five miles east of\r\nYork, South Carolina, is an adult female with a badly crushed skull. In\r\nexternal measurements the specimen agrees with _noveboracensis_. The\r\nunderparts, as regards color and width, are intermediate. The general\r\nproportions of the skull and tympanic bullae agree with those of\r\n_noveboracensis_ but the skull is larger than in any female of true\r\n_noveboracensis_ and approaches that of _olivacea_. The same can be\r\nsaid of a young female, no. 80, Ohio State Museum, from Roswell,\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nAnother female, no. 171559, U. S. Nat. Mus., from Lookout Mountain,\r\n1500 ft., Fort Payne, Alabama, is barely subadult. The external\r\nmeasurements are nearer those of _olivacea_. The color and narrowness\r\nof the underparts are typical of _noveboracensis_. The proportions and\r\nespecially size of the skull show approach to _olivacea_, though they\r\nare nearer to _noveboracensis_ when all features are taken into\r\naccount. In the northern part of its range individuals of\r\n_noveboracensis_ attain larger size than farther south. This tendency\r\nreaches its extreme, in males at least, in _M. f. occisor_ of Maine.\r\nSpecimens of _noveboracensis_ from the Adirondacks of New York average\r\nlarger (see cranial measurements on page 418) than those from farther\r\nsouth, and thus approach _occisor_ in size as well as in geographic\r\nposition. Also, occasional individuals which strongly show characters\r\nof _occisor_ are found even farther south than the Adirondacks of New\r\nYork. This is true of no. 96518, U. S. Nat. Mus., [M] ad., from\r\nLunenburg; Massachusetts. The animal has a large skull of relatively\r\ngreat width much as in _occisor_, although its external measurements,\r\nrelative length of tail and long, terminal, black brush place it with\r\n_noveboracensis_ rather than with _occisor_. Of a pair of specimens\r\nfrom Ossipee, New Hampshire, the male, no. 77108, U. S. Nat. Mus., has\r\na long (175 mm.) tail, and short (60 mm.) black pencil as in _occisor_,\r\nalthough otherwise it is referable to _noveboracensis_. Still another\r\nspecimen, a subadult male, no. 4193, Mus. Comp. Zoöl., from Upton,\r\nMaine, has a longer (51 mm.) hind foot than _noveboracensis_ although\r\nit otherwise agrees with that subspecies. As remarked by Bangs\r\n(1899:55), other than fully adult specimens from the range of _occisor_\r\nare \"troublesome,\" and would not be selected as distinct from\r\n_noveboracensis_ if placed in a series of that subspecies, say, from\r\nNew York State. In view of the facts that several specimens from\r\nintermediate localities combine the characters of _noveboracensis_ and\r\n_occisor_, that _noveboracensis_ in the northern part of its range\r\naverages larger than it does farther south and thus approaches\r\n_occisor_ in size, and that occasional large specimens resembling\r\n_occisor_ in several, but not all, features sometimes crop up in the\r\nnorthern part of the range of _noveboracensis_, it appears that\r\n_noveboracensis_ and _occisor_ intergrade. Therefore they are treated\r\nas two subspecies of the single species, _Mustela frenata_.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _M. f. primulina_ has been commented on in the\r\ndiscussion of that subspecies. Female, no. 159980, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\nfrom Golconda, Illinois, has many characters of _primulina_ but two\r\nyoung males from there agree better with _noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\nExamination of 283 adult and subadult skulls for malformation of the\r\nfrontal sinuses revealed only ten that were not obviously malformed.\r\nTwo were from New York, one from Massachusetts, one from Pennsylvania,\r\nand six from the 52 specimens from Michigan and Wisconsin. In addition,\r\nskulls of many young and even juveniles were malformed.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 555, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states and provinces and, unless otherwise noted, from north to\r\n     south by counties in each state.

Zoöl.; Bucksport, Hancock County, Maine;\r\n     January 15, 1899; obtained by Alvah G. Door but measured and sexed\r\n     by O. Bangs.\r\n\r\n     The skin is well made and in good condition. It is in full, white\r\n     winter-dress with black-tipped tail. The skull has the posterior\r\n     half of the left zygomatic arch broken away; otherwise the skull\r\n     is unbroken and complete. Left I3 and right P3 are missing.

Zonal range Canadian and probably Transition. See\r\n     figure 29 on page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f.\r\n     noveboracensis_ by a number of average differences including\r\n     larger size, relatively longer tail and relatively wider skull\r\n     (see p. 225, and measurements on pp. 418, 419).\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Five adults yield average and\r\n     extreme measurements as follows: Total length, 443 (430-465);\r\n     length of tail, 163 (154-175); length of hind foot, 50 (47-54).\r\n     Tail averages 58 per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind\r\n     foot averages more than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: Measurements of two subadult female topotypes are as\r\n     follows: Total length, 346, 318; length of tail, 116, 110; length\r\n     of hind foot, 39, 35.5.\r\n\r\n     Tail amounts to 50 per cent and 54 per cent of body-length\r\n     respectively. Length of hind foot more or less than (about equal\r\n     to) basal length.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes\r\n     are: Total length, 111; length of tail, 50; length of hind foot,\r\n     12.5.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_ except\r\n     that black tail-tip in series of 10 males in full winter pelage 60\r\n     (45-80) mm. long; thus averaging 39 per cent of length of tail\r\n     vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 3 adults): See measurements and\r\n     plates 16-18. As described in _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_\r\n     except that: Weight, 4.2 (4.1-4.3) grams; basilar length, 45.7\r\n     (44.9-46.9); zygomatic breadth more or less than (about equal to)\r\n     distance between anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of\r\n     tympanic bulla; least width of palate rarely less than length of\r\n     P4; anterior margin of masseteric fossa behind or directly below\r\n     posterior half of m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 2 subadults): See measurements and plates 31-33.\r\n     As described in _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 2.0 (1.9-2.1) grams; basilar length, 37.3, 38.2.\r\n\r\n     Comparison of the skull with that of _M. f. noveboracensis_ is\r\n     made in the account of that subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Excepting a specimen in the Academy of Natural Sciences of\r\nPhiladelphia, obtained in 1893, and two in the Boston Society of\r\nNatural History, obtained in 1925, I have seen no material of this\r\nsubspecies in addition to that examined by Bangs at the time he\r\nprepared the original description in 1899.\r\n\r\nAnderson (1945:56, 57) records a specimen, Canadian National Museum\r\nCatalogue Number 18426, from Kamouraska County, Quebec, as of this\r\nsubspecies and thinks that _occisor_ occurs north of Maine \"locally to\r\nsouth side of lower St. Lawrence River in Quebec; probably also in\r\nwestern New Brunswick.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the available material of occisor permits one to judge, it is\r\ndistinguished from _noveboracensis_ by a combination of characters no\r\none of which invariably can be relied upon as diagnostic. Employing\r\nadult males, average differences indicate that _M. f. occisor_ is\r\nlarger in each of the external and cranial measurements; tail\r\nrelatively longer; black tip of tail relatively shorter; mastoid and\r\nzygomatic breadth relatively greater and zygomatic arches more nearly\r\nsquare posteriorly.\r\n\r\nConsidering the large number of specimens of _noveboracensis_ which are\r\navailable in comparison with the few of _occisor_ it is not surprising\r\nthat some _noveboracensis_ should be found which exceed in size those\r\nof _occisor_. This is the case as regards the basilar length of a very\r\nold male, no. 96518, U. S. Nat. Mus., from Lunenburg, Massachusetts.\r\nAlso, the skull is actually broader than any of those of _occisor_.\r\nHowever, this specimen is much older than any _occisor_ examined. In a\r\nfemale, no. 4260, Mus. Comp. Zoöl., from Liberty Hill, Connecticut, the\r\nskull is longer (but narrower) than in either of the two available\r\nfemales of _occisor_.\r\n\r\nThe average differences pointed out above which characterize this\r\nextreme northern population of _noveboracensis_-like weasel in\r\ncomparison with true _noveboracensis_ without much question are\r\ngeographic variations. Whether or not these variations are of a degree\r\nsufficient to warrant nomenclatural recognition is debatable. With\r\nequally scanty material from other regions I have not named variations\r\nseemingly as great as those shown by _occisor_. The paucity of material\r\nof _occisor_ is a handicap in making a decision in this instance.\r\n\r\nEach of the adult and subadult specimens, except the one from Perry,\r\nshows malformation resulting from the infestation of the frontal\r\nsinuses with parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 18, listed by counties from\r\n     west to east and unless otherwise indicated in the Museum of\r\n     Comparative Zoölogy.\r\n\r\n     =Maine.= _Oxford County_: South Andover, 2 (Boston Soc.

The type is judged to be a male rather\r\n     than a female as stated by the original describer, Jackson\r\n     (1913:123), whose measurements of hind foot, interorbital\r\n     constriction, maxillary tooth-row, and mandibular tooth-row agree\r\n     with those of males and are larger than those of any female seen\r\n     of this subspecies.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Upper and Lower Austral life-zones west of the\r\n     Mississippi River in Missouri and Arkansas, the southeastern half\r\n     of Iowa, eastern half of Kansas and Oklahoma, northern Louisiana\r\n     and northeastern Texas.

Color of underparts extends distally\r\n     on posterior sides of forelegs onto antipalmar faces of toes, on\r\n     medial sides of hind legs only to a point between knee and ankle.\r\n     Least width of color of underparts averaging, in a series of 21\r\n     males from Lawrence, Kansas, 23 (9-35) per cent of greatest width\r\n     of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail in same series, most of\r\n     which are in full winter pelage, 52 (40-70) mm. long; thus longer\r\n     than hind foot and averaging 39 per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on ten adults from Douglas County,\r\n     Kansas): See measurements and plates 16-18; weight, 3.7 (3.3-4.2)\r\n     grams; basilar length, 44.8 (43.8-46.0); zygomatic breadth more or\r\n     less (less in 80 per cent) than distance between condylar foramen\r\n     and M1 or than between anterior palatine foramen and anterior end\r\n     of tympanic bulla (less in 70 per cent); mastoid breadth more or\r\n     less (less in 80 per cent) than postpalatal length; postorbital\r\n     breadth less than length of upper premolars and, except in one\r\n     specimen, more than width of basioccipital measured from medial\r\n     margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     interorbital breadth more or less (less in 70 per cent) than\r\n     distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla; breadth of rostrum less than length of tympanic bulla;\r\n     least width of palate less than outside length of P4 (except in\r\n     one specimen); anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior\r\n     to foramen ovale as width of 2-1/2 to 5 upper incisors; height of\r\n     tympanic bulla more (except in one specimen) than distance from\r\n     its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla\r\n     more than length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and longer\r\n     (except in one specimen) than rostrum; anterior margin of\r\n     masseteric fossa behind or just below posterior eighth of m1.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 5 adults and subadults from Douglas County,\r\n     Kansas): See measurements and plates 31-33; weight, 2.2 (2.0-2.4)\r\n     grams; basilar length, 38.9 (37.6-40.7); zygomatic breadth less\r\n     than distance between condylar foramen and M1 or than between\r\n     anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     postorbital breadth less than length of upper premolars and except\r\n     in one specimen, more than width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     least width of palate less than greatest length of P4; tympanic\r\n     bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3 to 5 upper\r\n     incisors; height of tympanic bulla more or less than distance from\r\n     its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla\r\n     more than length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and longer\r\n     than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 41 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the male.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. noveboracensis_ from Massachusetts,\r\nthat of the male of _primulina_, in dorsal view, is seen to be shorter\r\nanteriorly to the postorbital processes and to have a more marked\r\npostorbital constriction. In lateral view the dorsal outline of the\r\nskull of _primulina_ is less concave in the postorbital region. In\r\nventral view the skull of _primulina_ is seen to be wider across the\r\nmastoid processes and zygomatic arches but the most pronounced\r\ndifference is in the tympanic bullae. In _noveboracensis_ each bulla is\r\nscooped out on the anterior part of the medial face and appears to be\r\nnarrower anteriorly than posteriorly whereas in _primulina_ the\r\nanterior part of the medial face is not scooped out but is moderately\r\ninflated and the bulla appears to be of uniform breadth anteriorly and\r\nposteriorly. By actual measurement the breadth of the bulla averages 59\r\nper cent of its length in _primulina_ but only 50 per cent in\r\n_noveboracensis_. Other respects in which the skull of the male of\r\n_primulina_ differs from that of _noveboracensis_ are as follows:\r\nLinear measurements of teeth more; relative to the basilar length, the\r\nlength of the tooth-rows averages more, whereas the interorbital\r\nbreadth and orbitonasal length are less.\r\n\r\nWhen skulls of females are compared, each of the differences mentioned\r\nabove is found to apply, except that the degree of difference is in\r\nsome parts greater, for example, in the tympanic bullae. In\r\n_primulina_, the bulla is in general like that of the male\r\n_noveboracensis_, whereas in the female _noveboracensis_ it is less\r\ninflated, especially anteromedially, shorter, relatively narrower, and\r\nin ventral view projects little or none below the squamosal floor of\r\nthe braincase. The breadth of the bulla averages 51 per cent of its\r\nlength in _primulina_ but only 47 per cent in _noveboracensis_. The\r\nbullae project below the basioccipital on the average, for a distance\r\nof 2.9 millimeters in female _primulina_ and only 2.3 millimeters in\r\nfemale _noveboracensis_. In _primulina_ the temporal ridges are well\r\ndeveloped and fuse to form a low sagittal crest, but in\r\n_noveboracensis_ the ridges are absent. Also, in _primulina_ the\r\nmastoid processes project farther laterally beyond the braincase. The\r\nskull of female _noveboracensis_ is much lighter than that of\r\n_primulina_. Average weights of the two are 1.7 and 2.2 grams. The\r\nskulls of females of _primulina_ and _noveboracensis_ differ more than\r\ndo the skulls of males.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _spadix_, that of the male, and the female,\r\nof _primulina_ averages smaller in every part measured. Expressed in\r\npercentages of the basilar length, the two depth measurements of the\r\nskulls are not significantly different, but, excluding the measurements\r\nof the bullae and teeth, the other cranial measurements are less. The\r\nmain difference in relative proportions is in the tympanic bullae which\r\naverage only a half millimeter shorter in males of _primulina_ and one\r\nand one-tenth millimeters shorter in females. The bullae are,\r\ntherefore, relative to the basilar length, longer in _primulina_. The\r\nskull of _primulina_, then, differs from that of _spadix_ mainly in\r\nsmaller size and relatively longer tympanic bullae, especially in\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. longicauda_, that of both sexes of\r\n_primulina_ averages smaller in every part measured, except in males\r\nwhere the length of the tympanic bulla, and breadth and length of M1\r\nare the same or slightly larger in _primulina_. Relative to the basilar\r\nlength, the length of the tympanic bullae, and in females only, the\r\ndepth measurements are greater in _primulina_ but all the others, in\r\nboth sexes, are less. These ratios reflect the relative narrowness of\r\nthe skull of _primulina_. Upon direct comparison the narrowness is\r\nespecially noticeable in the interorbital region, mastoid region,\r\ntympanic bullae, and across the zygomata.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. neomexicana_ that of both sexes of\r\n_primulina_ averages smaller in every part measured. Excepting the\r\nmeasurements of the teeth, most of the other measurements are\r\nconstantly larger. Relative to the basilar length, the length of\r\ntooth-rows and length of tympanic bulla are more, but excepting the\r\ndepth measurements, the others are less. Still other differences are,\r\nin _primulina_, less well-developed sagittal crest, anterolateral\r\ncorner of bulla rounded rather than \"square,\" and in males a\r\ntransversely convex rather than flat interorbital region.\r\n\r\nCompared with _M. f. frenata_ and _M. f. texensis_, the skulls of males\r\nof _primulina_ differ in being smaller in every part measured but\r\nrelative to the basilar length, have longer tooth-rows, a lesser\r\nzygomatic breadth and are less constricted interorbitally.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. olivacea_, those of both sexes of\r\n_primulina_ average smaller in every part measured, have shallower\r\n(dorsoventrally) tympanic bullae, a lower sagittal crest and slightly\r\nweaker postorbital processes on the frontals. Relative to the basilar\r\nlength, the several cranial measurements are about the same.\r\n\r\nComparison of the skull with that of _M. f. arthuri_ has been made in\r\nthe account of that subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The first specimens of this race known to have been\r\npreserved in study collections are one in the United States National\r\nMuseum, taken at Bridge, Carroll County, Missouri, many years ago by J.\r\nBurbage, and less than a dozen specimens preserved before 1900 from\r\neastern Kansas in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.\r\nIn 1913 Hartley H. T. Jackson bestowed a name on this animal on the\r\nbasis of two specimens taken by him in southwestern Missouri. Later,\r\nthrough the efforts of Charles D. Bunker, and his associates at the\r\nUniversity of Kansas, nearly 100 specimens were saved from eastern\r\nKansas, principally from Douglas County. In the course of the present\r\nstudy, Lawrence V. Compton obtained a topotype for the California\r\nMuseum of Vertebrate Zoölogy, and with the assistance of Mr. B. G.\r\nRoberts, a good series of specimens from Boone County, Arkansas, was\r\npreserved in the same museum. In the early years of the 20th Century,\r\nthe late B. H. Bailey at Coe College, Iowa, collected specimens from\r\nthat state. The specimens from these several sources suffice to give a\r\nrelatively clear idea of the characters of this subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata primulina_ is closely related to _M. f.\r\nnoveboracensis_, from which, on the average, it differs in the lighter\r\ncolor of the upper parts of the summer coat, in the more intense\r\ncoloring of the underparts, and in certain cranial features pointed out\r\nabove. In the southern part of its range, however, _noveboracensis_ has\r\nthe underparts only a little less intensely colored with yellow than\r\n_primulina_. Also, the skull of the one topotype from 7-1/2 miles\r\nsoutheast of Carthage, a subadult male in brown, winter pelage, is\r\nalmost exactly intermediate between that of _noveboracensis_ from\r\nMassachusetts and _primulina_ of Douglas County, Kansas, and Boone\r\nCounty, Arkansas. _M. f. primulina_ often has the underparts white in\r\nwinter, as does this topotype which agrees with the average of\r\n_noveboracensis_ in small size of teeth and narrowness across the\r\nmastoid processes and zygomatic arches. However, it agrees with\r\n_primulina_ in shape and relative size of the rostrum. It is almost\r\nexactly intermediate in shape and width of the tympanic bullae.\r\n\r\nThree other males, but no females, all in winter pelage, are available\r\nfrom eastern Missouri. Of the two from Silex, Lincoln County, one is\r\nnearer _noveboracensis_ and the other nearer _primulina_ on the basis\r\nof cranial characters. The third specimen, from four miles south of\r\nLesterville, so far as I can determine by examination of individual\r\ncranial characters and tabulation of results, is exactly intermediate.\r\nFinal decision on the proper allocation of specimens from the parts of\r\nMissouri represented can best be made when skulls of females are\r\navailable. From the fact that the skull of the female referred to\r\n_noveboracensis_ from Golconda, Illinois, shows almost as many\r\ncharacters of _primulina_ as of _noveboracensis_, it is judged that\r\nfemales from as far west as Silex and Lesterville, Missouri, will show\r\neven more characters of _primulina_ and so be referable to that form.\r\nIf this supposition be correct, the present reference of the almost\r\nexactly intermediate males, from eastern Missouri, will stand;\r\notherwise, it may not.\r\n\r\nAdditional intergrades with _noveboracensis_ are available from eastern\r\nIowa. Of five specimens from Hillsboro, Iowa, two males and a female\r\nhave tympanic bullae like those of _primulina_ but the other two males\r\nhave bullae like those of _noveboracensis_. The female is smaller than\r\n_primulina_ and in this small size and in general configuration of the\r\nskull, viewed dorsally, is more nearly like _noveboracensis_. As a\r\nwhole, the population averages almost exactly intermediate. The same is\r\ntrue of 3 males and one female from Muscatine. The subadult male from\r\nKeosaqua, to my eye, resembles _noveboracensis_ in the greater length\r\nof the skull anteriorly to the postorbital processes, and in the\r\nrelative narrowness across the mastoidal region, but otherwise is more\r\nlike that of _primulina_. Two males and one female from Tipton,\r\nalthough in each instance variously intermediate, are as a whole nearer\r\n_primulina_, No. 2865, Coe College, male adult, from Cedar Rapids, has\r\ncharacters of the three races, _spadix_, _noveboracensis_ and\r\n_primulina_. In the skull, the width suggests _spadix_, the narrow\r\nmastoid region, _noveboracensis_, and the tympanic bullae are as in\r\n_spadix_ or _primulina_. One male, no. 12, Coe College, from Dubuque,\r\nis as narrow across the mastoid region as is _noveboracensis_ although\r\nthe bullae are well inflated as in _primulina_. The skull, without\r\ncorresponding skin, of a female, no. 140a, Iowa State College, from\r\nGreen's Island, also resembles _noveboracensis_ in narrowness of the\r\nmastoidal region, and in small size of skull, but in larger teeth,\r\nbroader tympanic bullae, and sagittal crest is referable to\r\n_primulina_. Of two females from Vinton, one adult is typical of\r\n_primulina_ but the other, a subadult, is practically indistinguishable\r\nfrom female _noveboracensis_, from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Three males\r\nfrom Vinton agree well with _primulina_ except that the interorbital\r\nregion is wider than average and thereby suggests _spadix_ or\r\n_noveboracensis_. An adult female from New Hartford also is typical of\r\n_primulina_ except for the broader interorbital region. Three males\r\nfrom Fayette are typical of _primulina_.\r\n\r\nOther specimens from Iowa are intergrades with _spadix_, or if not with\r\n_spadix_, with the animal of northwestern Iowa which in some ways\r\ncombines the characters of _longicauda_ and _spadix_. For example, no.\r\n2665, Coe College, an adult male from Davenport, has the anterior part\r\nof the skull (all that is preserved) heavily ridged as in _spadix_ and\r\nin addition, the underparts are marked with the shade of reddish\r\ndisplayed by topotypes of _spadix_ and with some yellowish as seen in\r\n_longicauda_. The color pattern, however, is as in _primulina_. A young\r\nmale, no. C-51, Iowa State College, from Kelley, Story County, has\r\nanteriorly truncate bullae as are more frequently found in the\r\n_longicauda-spadix_ stock of northwestern Iowa, than in _primulina_. In\r\nother respects, the animal, in so far as can be judged from the broken\r\nskull, agrees with _primulina_ as it certainly does in color, color\r\npattern, and external measurements. An adult male, no. 499a, Iowa State\r\nCollege, from 2 miles east of Ledges St. Park, in Boone County, in\r\nshort body, size of teeth, and size of skull, in so far as the broken\r\nparts can be measured, resembles _primulina_ more closely than it does\r\nany other subspecies. The long tail, long hind foot, wide extent of the\r\nlight-colored underparts, and extension of the color of the underparts\r\nonto the hind feet are more as in _spadix_. Other intergrades with\r\n_spadix_ from Iowa are mentioned in the account of _spadix_.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from Swartz, Louisiana, suggests intergradation with\r\n_arthuri_ in that the anteromedial part of the tympanic bulla is less\r\ninflated than in typical _primulina_.\r\n\r\nIntergrades with _longicauda_ are available from Riley and Pratt\r\ncounties, Kansas. No. 7182, Univ. Kans., subadult male in winter\r\npelage, from near Winkler, has a skull of larger size as in\r\n_longicauda_ with which race it seems to agree in large size of body,\r\ntail and hind foot, although the collector's measurements are lacking.\r\nColor pattern and relative proportions of the skull throughout are as\r\nin _primulina_. The young male, no. 3495, Univ. Kans., from Pratt,\r\nKansas, agrees in external measurements and large size of skull with\r\n_longicauda_, but has the color and color pattern precisely as in\r\n_primulina_. The teeth are smaller as in _primulina_. Immaturity\r\nprevents judging of its relationships on the basis of relative\r\nproportions of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe two specimens, skins only, available from Oklahoma, are\r\nprovisionally referred to _primulina_. These are remarkable for the\r\nrestriction of the color of the underparts and for the intensity of the\r\nyellow coloration of the underparts. The specimen from Norman has the\r\ncolor of the underparts entirely absent from the hind legs and not\r\nextending posteriorly to the penis. On the chest and lower throat,\r\nlarge spots of color of the upper parts are present and the yellow area\r\nof the underparts on the belly is narrower than in any other specimen\r\nof _primulina_ examined. The specimen from 8 miles northwest of\r\nStillwater has the color of the underparts only a little less\r\nrestricted although this color does extend over the inguinal region\r\nalmost to the knees. The skin of the posterior part of the body of a\r\nweasel is available from 10 miles south of Sulphur Springs, Texas. It,\r\nlikewise, is only provisionally referred to _primulina_. The coloration\r\nis about as in the specimens from Oklahoma but the distribution of the\r\ncolor of the underparts cannot be made out.\r\n\r\nThe dark color of the upper parts occurs far westward in animals which\r\notherwise display characters of _longicauda_. Among these intergrades,\r\nthe larger size of _longicauda_ generally is combined with this dark\r\ncolor. This geographic behavior of the dark color of the upper parts is\r\nanalogous to the condition described in _M. f. spadix_. Stated in\r\nanother way, the dark color of the upper parts is the character, of the\r\neastern animal, last to disappear as one goes westward across the\r\nMississippi Valley toward the range of _longicauda_ which is a\r\nsubspecies of markedly different size, shape of skull, and coloration.\r\n\r\nOnly two of 29 specimens from Kansas show infestation of the frontal\r\nsinuses. All four of the specimens from Missouri have the frontal\r\nsinuses malformed as do 9 of the 14 from Arkansas examined in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nAn adult female from Boone County, Iowa, bears the date May 9, 1938,\r\nand the annotation by T. G. Scott, \"Fox-killed.\"\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 131, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states and from north to south by counties in each state.\r\n     Except as otherwise indicated, specimens are in the University of\r\n     Kansas, Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n     =Arkansas.= _Boone County_: 3 mi.

Color of\r\n     underparts extends distally on medial sides of hind limbs only to\r\n     knees. Least width of color of underparts amounting to 15 per cent\r\n     of greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail 50\r\n     mm. long; thus longer than hind foot and 44 per cent as long as\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on type and 2 subadults): See\r\n     measurements and plates 16-18. As described in _M. f.\r\n     noveboracensis_ except that: Weight, 4.0 (3.7-4.3) grams; basilar\r\n     length, 43.5 (43.3-43.6); zygomatic breadth not less than distance\r\n     between anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla; postorbital breadth more than length of upper premolars;\r\n     interorbital breadth more than distance between foramen opticum\r\n     and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; least width of palate more\r\n     or less than length of P4; tympanic bulla longer than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     Female: Typical skull unknown. The skull from 12 miles east of\r\n     Eagle Lake, Texas, lacks the convexity in the dorsal longitudinal\r\n     axis and the skull agrees with those of larger individuals of\r\n     _primulina_ except that the anteromedial faces of the tympanic\r\n     bullae are less inflated, and the mastoid and zygomatic breadths\r\n     are greater than in any female seen of _primulina_. Probably this\r\n     greater breadth is the result of intergradation with _M. f.\r\n     frenata_ to the westward.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. olivacea_ that of _arthuri_ differs\r\nas follows: Averaging smaller in every part measured; basilar length 5\r\nmm. less; by weight a fourth lighter; relative to basilar length,\r\ninterorbital breadth greater and zygomatic and especially mastoid\r\nbreadth less; dorsal outline of skull more convex in longitudinal axis;\r\ntympanic bullae narrower and less inflated especially on anteromedial\r\nfaces. Compared with the skull of _noveboracensis_ that of _arthuri_\r\nhas the zygomatic breadth equal to or exceeding the distance from the\r\nanterior palatine foramen to the anterior margin of the tympanic bulla,\r\nwhereas the zygomatic breadth is less than this distance in\r\n_noveboracensis_. Also, in _arthuri_, the rostrum is relatively\r\nshorter, the braincase is more inflated anteriorly, the zygomatic\r\narches are more uniformly spreading, and the dorsal outline of the\r\nskull is distinctly convex, both transversely and longitudinally,\r\nwhereas it is transversely more nearly flat in _noveboracensis_ and\r\nlongitudinally is concave in the interorbital region.\r\n\r\nCompared with _M. f. primulina_, _arthuri_ has narrower bullae, which\r\nare much less inflated on their anteromedial faces, a less marked\r\npostorbital constriction, a braincase which is narrower across the\r\nmastoid region and broader anteriorly, and a skull, which, in\r\nlongitudinal axis, has the dorsal outline markedly more convex.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. texensis_ that of _arthuri_ is\r\nsmaller in every part measured; length one-fifth less; one-half as\r\nheavy; postorbital constriction less marked; braincase relatively\r\nnarrower posteriorly and tympanic bullae less inflated especially\r\nanteromedially. Compared with the skull of _M. f. frenata_ that of\r\n_arthuri_ is smaller in every part measured; basilar length 6 mm. less;\r\na third lighter; postorbital constriction less marked; relative to the\r\nbasilar length the rostrum is broader, longer and deeper; the zygomatic\r\nexpanse and breadth of the braincase across the mastoids is less; the\r\ndorsal profile of the skull is more convex in longitudinal axis;\r\nzygomata evenly spreading rather than abruptly protruding from skull\r\nposteriorly; tympanic bullae less inflated anteromedially.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--In 1926, Stanley C. Arthur, then Director of the Division\r\nof Wild Life, for the Louisiana State Department of Conservation,\r\nobtained specimens of this weasel. Some of them were mounted and the\r\nremainder were placed in the collections of the United States National\r\nMuseum and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy. In 1938 to 1940 George H.\r\nLowery saved specimens from Baton Rouge, which showed the color of the\r\nsummer pelage and revealed that the size of males was more than was\r\nindicated by the original materials. In 1940 and 1941 Rollin H. Baker\r\nobtained specimens from eastern Texas which greatly extended the known\r\ngeographic range.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the localities represented by specimens examined, Arthur\r\n(1928:117) has recorded specimens from Greensburg, St. Helena Parish;\r\nBraithwaite, Plaquemines Parish; Geismar, Assumption Parish; Laurel\r\nHill, West Feliciana Parish; French Settlement, Livingston Parish; and\r\nKentwood, Tangipahoa Parish. All these localities lie within the\r\neastern half of southern Louisiana. A skin-only, no. 38902, Mus. Vert.\r\nZoöl., obtained from a fur buyer by Stanley C. Arthur, was taken in\r\nMississippi \"south of Jackson.\" Possibly it is of the subspecies\r\n_arthuri_.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _M. f. olivacea_ is indicated by a specimen from\r\nMobile County, Alabama, commented on in the account of _olivacea_.\r\nIntergradation with _primulina_ is indicated by the shape of the\r\nanteromedial part of the bullae of the specimen from Swartz, Louisiana,\r\nthat is referred to _primulina_. The lack of specimens from the\r\nnorthern two-thirds of Mississippi and from western Tennessee, prevents\r\nany definite statement as to the limits of range of _arthuri_ in those\r\nareas. In comparison with animals from the type locality, the slightly\r\nlarger size of the adult male from Baton Rouge, and the still larger\r\nsize of the adult male of _primulina_ from Swartz, Louisiana, suggests\r\nthat the _olivacea_ \"influence\" may extend farther west in the\r\nlatitude of northern Louisiana than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nNone of the skulls examined shows malformation of the frontal sinuses\r\nsuch as results from infestation by parasites in some races. Arthur\r\n(1928:115) speaks of the \". . . cut-over swamp land, where the tupelo\r\nand cypress have been removed, . . .\" as constituting suitable habitat\r\nfor this animal.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 13, as follows:\r\n\r\n     =Texas.= _Colorado County_: 12 mi.

Least width of color of underparts averaging, in a series\r\n     of five males from Talbot Co., Georgia, 29 (extremes 24-34) per\r\n     cent of greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail\r\n     in same series, averaging 65 (extremes 60-70) mm. long, thus\r\n     longer than hind foot and averaging 43 per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     The spot at the angle of the mouth is absent in one-third of the\r\n     specimens examined.

As compared with the skull of _M. f. noveboracensis_,\r\nthat of _olivacea_ in the case of males is larger in every part\r\nmeasured and relative to the basilar length is broader across the\r\nzygomatic arches and mastoids. However, the rostrum and interorbital\r\nregion are relatively narrower. The orbitonasal length is relatively\r\nless. The tympanic bullae are broader and more inflated. The same\r\ndifferences hold as between females of _noveboracensis_ and _olivacea_.\r\nIndeed, the females of these two races differ more than do the males.\r\nAdditional, selected differential cranial characters in the females\r\nare, in _olivacea_, as follows: Weight averaging 3.8 grams rather than\r\n1.7 grams; braincase with, rather than without, sagittal crest;\r\nanterior border of tympanic bulla separated from foramen ovale by\r\nbreadth of less than, rather than breadth of more than, 4 upper\r\nincisors (including I3); height of tympanic bulla not less than, rather\r\nthan less than, distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale;\r\nsquamosal bone, between anterior margin of tympanic bulla and foramen\r\novale, ventrally concave rather than ventrally convex. Comparisons of\r\nthe skulls with those of _M. f. arthuri_ and _M. f. primulina_ are made\r\nin the accounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Excepting two young specimens from South Carolina in the\r\nCharleston Museum, no specimens of this race of large weasel seem to\r\nhave been preserved until Arthur H. Howell, in the course of his study\r\nof the mammals of Alabama, procured specimens on which his name,\r\n_olivacea_, was based. Later, Francis Harper obtained three instructive\r\nspecimens from Okefinokee Swamp. Really adequate material, for the\r\nlocalities represented, owes its preservation to the alertness of\r\nCharles O. Handley, when he resided at Thomasville, Georgia, and to\r\nHallie E. Fuller of Geneva, Talbot Co., Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness of _M. f. olivacea_ from _M. f. peninsulae_ is not\r\nsatisfactorily established due to inadequate material of _peninsulae_.\r\nDifferences shown by the specimens seen indicate that, as compared with\r\n_olivacea_, _peninsulae_ is larger, has transversely wider\r\nlight-colored underparts which possess more yellow, and a larger skull\r\nwith more inflated tympanic bullae. In each of these characters,\r\n_olivacea_ is intermediate between _noveboracensis_ on the north and\r\n_peninsulae_ on the south. The question arises, therefore, whether the\r\nanimals here recognized under the name _olivacea_ really constitute a\r\nrecognizable subspecies or instead are only representatives of a\r\nsubspecies which reaches its extreme development in Florida. In the\r\nlatter event, the name _peninsulae_ would apply to all. Examination of\r\nmore material from Florida, especially from the southern half of\r\nFlorida, will be necessary to answer this question.\r\n\r\nThis large weasel of the southeastern United States is remarkably\r\ndifferent from _noveboracensis_. Indeed, were it not for actual\r\nintergrades such as the two from Fort Payne, Alabama, and York, South\r\nCarolina, which are described in the account of _M. f. noveboracensis_,\r\nand the six specimens from northwestern Alabama, which are referred to\r\n_olivacea_, the systematist, I believe, would have little or no\r\nhesitancy in designating the two as distinct species, especially on the\r\nbasis of differences to be seen in the skull.\r\n\r\nNot only are the two forms structurally more different than usually is\r\nthe case but between two geographically, adjacent subspecies of the\r\nsame species of mammal, but the belt where intergradation occurs\r\nappears to be narrow. Nevertheless, when material of the two races is\r\nlaid out in geographic order, and examined in mass, certain features\r\nare seen to undergo gradual change as a person's eye travels from\r\nspecimens from, say, the center of the range of _noveboracensis_ to\r\nspecimens from southern localities adjoining the territory occupied by\r\n_olivacea_. One of these features subject to gradual change is the\r\ncolor of the underparts. Beginning at the Adirondacks of New York\r\nwhere a large number of the specimens have white underparts, the\r\nunderparts become more intensely yellowish southward through the range\r\nof _noveboracensis_ into that of _olivacea_. Indeed, this progressive\r\ntrend seems to continue right on southward through the range of\r\n_olivacea_ into that of _peninsulae_. Turning in the opposite direction\r\nwe find that the least width of the underparts decreases gradually\r\nnorthward toward the range of _noveboracensis_. There is, likewise, a\r\ndecrease to the northward in length of the skull and relative, as well\r\nas actual, narrowing of the braincase and tympanic bullae. However, in\r\nleast width of color of underparts and the mentioned cranial features,\r\nthe trend stops relatively abruptly at the southern boundary of the\r\ngeographic range of _noveboracensis_ and does not continue on,\r\nnorthward, into the range of _noveboracensis_ as is the case with the\r\nchange in intensity of yellowness of the underparts.\r\n\r\nTwo males, in the United States National Museum, Biological Surveys\r\nCollection, from near Leighton, Alabama, no. 178386 from the Tennessee\r\nRiver nine miles north [of Leighton?] and no. 180240 from La Grange\r\nMountain, although clearly referable to _olivacea_ on the basis of\r\ncranial characters, show some approach to _noveboracensis_ in lesser\r\nsize of the skull and agree with _noveboracensis_ in the narrowness of\r\nthe color of the underparts. Also, these specimens, like others from\r\nthe northern part of the range of _olivacea_, for instance, no 31.227,\r\nCharleston Museum, from Mayesville, South Carolina, have the color of\r\nthe underparts extended only part way out on the hind limb toward the\r\nfoot. In specimens of _olivacea_ from the southern part of its range\r\nthe color of the underparts is extended onto the hind feet and this\r\ntrend reaches its extreme in _peninsulae_, specimens of which have the\r\nfeet and larger parts of the limbs marked with the light color of the\r\nunderparts.\r\n\r\nAn adult female, no. 32.32, Charleston Museum, although typical of\r\n_olivacea_ in most respects, is nevertheless an intergrade. The teeth\r\nare as small as in some specimens of _noveboracensis_. The size of the\r\nskull is only slightly nearer that of _olivacea_ than it is to that of\r\n_noveboracensis_. The proportions of the skull, however, are distinctly\r\nthose of _olivacea_.\r\n\r\nFive other specimens, from northwestern Alabama, namely two from eight\r\nmiles north of Nauvoo, two from Shoal Creek, and one from White Creek,\r\nalso show intergradation between _noveboracensis_ and _olivacea_. The\r\nremarks concerning color and color pattern of the specimens from\r\nLeighton apply equally well to the five from northwestern Alabama. In\r\ncranial characters, no. 51658 from Shoal Creek is referable to\r\n_olivacea_, as also is no. 51677 from the same place, providing it is a\r\nfemale rather than a male as sexed by the collector. No. 57146 from\r\nWhite Creek also is referable to _olivacea_ although the skull shows\r\nsome approach to that of _noveboracensis_. Of the two males from near\r\nNauvoo, no. 51652 is to me indistinguishable from _noveboracensis_, but\r\nno. 51653 does have some characters of _olivacea_, although on the\r\nwhole, the latter, too, seems to be a little nearer _noveboracensis_\r\nthan _olivacea_. However, because the mean of these seven specimens\r\nfrom northwestern Alabama is nearer _olivacea_ than _noveboracensis_\r\nthe former name may be applied.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen from \"Souinlonie\" Creek, Clark County, Mississippi,\r\nhas the coloration and rostral configuration of _primulina_, narrow\r\nmastoidal breadth and smaller teeth of _noveboracensis_ and skull of\r\nlarge size with \"full\" braincase as in _olivacea_. No. 235364, U. S.\r\nNat. Mus., from the Mobile River at the \"L. and N. RR. Crossing,\"\r\nMobile County, Alabama, although definitely _olivacea_, shows approach\r\nto _arthuri_ in that the dorsal outline of the skull is longitudinally\r\nmore convex and the tympanic bullae are less inflated than in\r\n_olivacea_ and in that the color of the underparts is almost exactly as\r\nin the type specimen of _arthuri_. The young specimen labeled as from\r\n\"Silver Springs,\" Florida, has large tympanic bullae (17 mm. long) and\r\nseveral characters that show its relationship to _peninsulae_ as that\r\nrace is now understood. Because the sex is unknown the identification\r\nas _olivacea_ is tentative and is made on the assumption that the\r\nspecimen is a male. If it is instead a female, the animal is referable\r\nto _peninsulae_.\r\n\r\nAn adult, female specimen in the Charleston Museum, no. 27.239.1, taken\r\nat St. Matthews, South Carolina, on December 8, 1927, contained four\r\nembryos which averaged 19 mm. in length and 47.75 centigrams in weight.\r\nAnother adult female, in the Charleston Museum, no. 32.32, taken on\r\nFebruary 21, 1932, at the same place, has prominent mammae, and the\r\ncollector has noted that two were slightly active.\r\n\r\nSixteen of twenty-nine adults examined show infestation of the frontal\r\nsinuses by parasites. However, in none is the malformation of the\r\nfrontal region so great as frequently occurs in _M. f. noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 52, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states and from north to south by counties in each state.\r\n     Except as otherwise indicated specimens are in the University of\r\n     California Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy.\r\n\r\n     =Alabama.= _Lawrence County_: White Creek, 1; Little Sand Mt.,\r\n     Shoal Creek, 2. _Winston County_: 7-1/2 mi.

Philadelphia; Hudson's, Pasco County [14 miles north of\r\n     Tarpon Springs], Florida; before 1895; obtained by W. S.\r\n     Dickinson.\r\n\r\n     The skull has been cut vertically in two at the plane of the\r\n     glenoid fossae. These fossae and all the cranium posterior to them\r\n     are missing. In addition to the part of the cranium anterior to\r\n     the glenoid fossae, the lower jaws are preserved complete. The\r\n     teeth all are present and entire. The prominent sutures on the\r\n     rostrum and palate show the specimen to be young and its small\r\n     size leaves but little doubt that the animal was a female. The\r\n     light facial markings are more extensive than in any of the\r\n     referred specimens. In the type these light facial markings\r\n     consist of a median isolated spot immediately in front of the\r\n     ears, a larger one on the nose, with an interrupted bar on each\r\n     side extending posteroventrally in front of and anterior to the\r\n     eye, a wider bar, on each side, extending anterodorsally between\r\n     the ear and eye and finally an isolated spot at the anterior\r\n     border of each ear. The skin is stuffed and in fair condition\r\n     except that the vertebrae remain in the tail.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Austral and probably Tropical life-zones of Florida\r\n     south of latitude 29°. See figure 29 on page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f.\r\n     olivacea_ in coarser pelage and larger tympanic bullae.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: No external measurements available.\r\n     Female: The type a young animal and no. 2379, an adult from Tarpon\r\n     Springs, measure respectively as follows: Total length, 375, 378;\r\n     length of tail, 100, 130; length of hind foot, 40, 44.5.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_\r\n     except that hairiness of foot-soles as shown in figure 20.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Upper parts (in winter) near tone 3 of Burnt Umber of\r\n     Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 304. Dark spot at each angle of mouth\r\n     present or absent. Tip of tail black. Underparts Reed Yellow\r\n     except on chin and usually on legs where white. Upper lips white\r\n     entirely around. Upper parts of uniform color. Color of underparts\r\n     extends distally on legs over both sides of feet and on front legs\r\n     over wrists. Proximal part of tail slightly lighter below than\r\n     above. Least width of color of underparts, in seven specimens,\r\n     averaging 41 (extremes 31-52) per cent of greatest width of color\r\n     of upper parts. Black tip of tail, in each of two females, 45 mm.\r\n     long; thus slightly longer than hind foot and amounting to 36 per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     The spot at the angle of the mouth is absent in four of the ten\r\n     specimens and is present on both sides in the other six.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on an adult from Apopka and the\r\n     anterior part of an adult from Enterprise): See measurements and\r\n     plates 16-18. As described in _Mustela frenata olivacea_ except\r\n     that: Weight, 7.0 grams; basilar length, 49.8.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on an adult from Tarpon Springs, Florida): See\r\n     measurements. As described in _Mustela frenata olivacea_ except\r\n     that: Weight, 4.7 grams; basilar length, 44.2; zygomatic breadth\r\n     more than distance between anterior palatine foramen and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with _M. f. olivacea_, the insufficient material of _M.\r\nf. peninsulae_ suggests that its skull averages larger and has\r\nrelatively as well as actually larger and more inflated tympanic\r\nbullae.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The first published mention of this weasel seems to have\r\nbeen the original description which appeared in 1894. This description\r\nwas based on a single specimen sent to Samuel N. Rhoads by W. S.\r\nDickinson, who, in the following year, procured another specimen at\r\nTarpon Springs. So far as known only eight other specimens, as listed\r\nunder \"_Specimens examined_,\" have found their way into collections of\r\nstudy specimens.\r\n\r\nH. H. Bailey (1930:1) credits the range of this subspecies as extending\r\nsouth \"to the shores of Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, where ever\r\nhigh ground occurs.\"\r\n\r\nEvidence of intergradation between _M. f. peninsulae_ and _M. f.\r\nolivacea_ is provided by specimens of _olivacea_ from Gainesville,\r\nFlorida, and the Okefinokee Swamp, Georgia. These specimens, on the\r\naverage, have the color of the underparts wider, the skull larger, and\r\nthe tympanic bullae relatively larger than do specimens of _olivacea_\r\nfrom farther north. In these features, approach to _M. f. peninsulae_\r\nis shown.\r\n\r\nLight facial markings occur in this subspecies. They are similar to\r\nthose possessed by weasels which occur at the same latitude and under\r\ncorresponding climatic conditions on the Pacific Coast. The type\r\nspecimen and one from Tarpon Springs have white facial markings. Two of\r\nthe three specimens from Apopka also show white facial markings,\r\nalthough in reduced amount. One of the four specimens of _M. f.\r\nolivacea_ from Gainesville, Florida, has well-developed light (white)\r\nfacial markings. Also of the four specimens of _M. f. olivacea_\r\nexamined from Okefinokee Swamp, Georgia, one has prominent white facial\r\nmarkings. However, in it the pattern is so unusual as to suggest that\r\nit is an instance of partial albinism rather than an outcropping of a\r\nracial tendency, or a pattern of coloration induced by climatic\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nNone of the eight available skulls show any infestation of the frontal\r\nsinuses by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 10, arranged by counties from\r\n     west to east.\r\n\r\n     =Florida.= _Pasco County_: Hudson's, 1[1]. _Pinellas County_:\r\n     Tarpon Springs, 1[1]. _Hernando County_, 1[91]. _Polk County_:\r\n     Auburndale, 1[91]; no locality more definite than county, 1[91].\r\n     _Orange County_: Apopka, 3[61]. _Volusia County_: Enterprise,\r\n     1[60]. _Seminole County_: Osceola, 1[2].\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela frenata spadix= (Bangs)\r\n\r\nLong-tailed Weasel\r\n\r\nPlates 16, 17, 18, 31, 32 and 33\r\n\r\n    _Putorius longicauda spadix_ Bangs, Proc.

From _M. f. longicauda_ by color darker than\r\n     near (_h_) Clay Color, in males by a flattened occiput in which\r\n     the depth of the skull, exclusive of the sagittal crest and taken\r\n     at the anterior border of the basioccipital, amounts to less than\r\n     58 per cent of the mastoid breadth.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Three adults from Elk River,\r\n     Minnesota, yield average and extreme measurements as follows:\r\n     Total length, 458 (444-467); length of tail, 154 (140-165); length\r\n     of hind foot, 55 (52-59). Tail averages 51 per cent as long as\r\n     head and body. Length of hind foot averages more than basal\r\n     length. Corresponding measurements of three subadults from\r\n     Madison, Minnesota, are as follows: 453 (438-469); 157 (152-165);\r\n     50 (47-51).

At Madison, corresponding differences are 68,\r\n     20, and 8. Two adult females from Elk River, Minnesota, weigh 205\r\n     and 210 grams.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black, brown, or white\r\n     (often all three colors in same specimen) and extending beyond\r\n     ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts and extending to\r\n     apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of foot-soles (in summer\r\n     pelage) as shown in figure 19.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Winter pelage all white except tip of tail. In southern\r\n     part of range sometimes assumes a brown winter coat. Summer pelage\r\n     with upper parts ranging from near (16´) Cinnamon Brown to Vandyke\r\n     Brown. Chin and upper lips white. Remainder of underparts ranging\r\n     from near (a) Olive Ocher to Ochraceous Buff and Pale Orange\r\n     Yellow. Tip of tail at all times black. Upper parts of uniform\r\n     color except for occasional slight darkening of nose. Color of\r\n     underparts extends distally on posterior sides of forelegs over\r\n     toes onto antipalmar faces of feet and ankles, on medial sides of\r\n     hind limbs to ankle, over antiplantar faces of toes and\r\n     distomedial fourth of each tarsus, and over proximal fifth to\r\n     third of under side of tail. Least width of color of underparts\r\n     averaging (in 3 specimens from Elk River) 54 (47-59) per cent of\r\n     greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail\r\n     averaging same length as hind foot and 28 per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae. Save for the greater width of the light-colored\r\n     underparts and relatively short black tip of the tail, both\r\n     features of _M. f. longicauda_, _spadix_ is variously\r\n     intermediate, depending on locality, as between _noveboracensis_\r\n     and _longicauda_.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 3 adults from Elk River,\r\n     Minn.): See measurements and plates 16-18. As described in\r\n     _Mustela frenata longicauda_ except that: Weight, 5.6 (5.0-6.5);\r\n     basilar length, 49.0 (48.7-49.2); zygomatic breadth sometimes less\r\n     than distance between anterior palatine foramen and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; postorbital breadth more or less (about\r\n     equal to) width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of\r\n     one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; interorbital\r\n     breadth more or less than distance between foramen opticum and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla; anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 4 to 5 upper\r\n     incisors; height of tympanic bulla more or less than distance from\r\n     its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla\r\n     less than length of rostrum; anterior margin of masseteric fossa\r\n     below talonid of m1.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 4 adults from Elk River, Minn.): See measurements\r\n     and plates 31-33. As described in _Mustela frenata longicauda_\r\n     except that: Weight, 3.5 (3.3-4.0) grams; basilar length, 42.9\r\n     (42.3-43.2); least width of palate more or less than greatest\r\n     length of P4; tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as\r\n     width of 3 to 5 upper incisors.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 33 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the male.\r\n\r\nSkulls of adult males of _spadix_ from Elk River, Minnesota, as\r\ncompared with those of _longicauda_ from Alberta, are larger in every\r\npart measured. Relative to the basilar length these skulls of _spadix_\r\nare broader across the mastoid region, narrower across the zygomata,\r\ndeeper through the plane of the postorbital processes, shallower\r\nthrough the braincase and have relatively shorter tympanic bullae.\r\nWhereas the tympanic bullae of _longicauda_ are, on the average,\r\napproximately as long as the rostrum (orbitonasal length), in _spadix_\r\nthe rostrum is longer than the bulla. Viewed posteriorly, the braincase\r\nof _spadix_ is seen to be much shallower and wider than that of\r\n_longicauda_. Indeed, the depth of the braincase, measured at the\r\nanterior end of the basioccipital, amounts to only 56 per cent of the\r\nmastoid breadth in _spadix_ as against 61 per cent in _longicauda_. The\r\nlonger, waistlike, postorbital constriction, relatively smaller\r\nbraincase, and especially the relatively narrower zygomatic expanse in\r\n_spadix_ imparts to its skull a more slender appearance than has the\r\nskull of _longicauda_. These differences are not shown by the skulls of\r\nfemales. To be sure, _spadix_, in most of its cranial measurements,\r\naverages slightly larger, has a relatively shallower braincase and is\r\nrelatively deeper through the postorbital processes, but these\r\ndifferences are so slight that inclusion of one more specimen, of\r\nslightly different proportions, in the average might cause the average\r\nmeasurements to read as they do in _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nCompared with _noveboracensis_, from Massachusetts, adult skulls of\r\n_spadix_, taking sex into account, are larger in every part measured\r\nand are relatively as well as actually wider and deeper throughout.\r\nAlso, in _spadix_: Sagittal and lambdoidal crests higher, especially in\r\nfemales; anterior margin of tympanic bulla projecting up sharply from\r\nsquamosal; occiput more flattened in posterior view; tooth-rows\r\nrelatively and actually longer but orbitonasal length relatively\r\nshorter; postorbital processes more robust; zygomatic arches widely\r\nbowed outward rather than evenly rounded; canines larger; squamosal\r\nless swollen ventrally, especially in females. Between _noveboracensis_\r\nand _spadix_, the differential cranial characters are greater in number\r\nand degree between females than between males. Comparison of the skull\r\nwith that of _M. f. primulina_ is made in discussion of that\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Edgar A. Mearns in 1889 and the early nineties took several\r\nspecimens of this weasel and it was principally on these that Bangs in\r\n1896 (p. 8) based his description. The best material, however, is that\r\nfrom Elk River, Minnesota, collected in later years by Bernard Bailey,\r\nand supplemented by one specimen taken in 1885 by Vernon Bailey and\r\nanother by his sister Anna Bailey in 1891 at the same place.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata spadix_ has just one structural feature of a \"unique\"\r\nkind which serves to differentiate it from the geographically adjoining\r\nsubspecies. This feature is large size. The other diagnostic characters\r\nascribed to _spadix_ are of an intermediate sort--intermediate as\r\nbetween two extremes, one found to the westward in _longicauda_ and the\r\nother to the eastward in _noveboracensis_. For example, the\r\ndark-colored upper parts are merely darker than in _longicauda_ and\r\nmerely lighter than in _noveboracensis_. The color is not \"different\";\r\nit is only \"intermediate.\" Furthermore, each of the characters ascribed\r\nto _spadix_, including large size itself, undergoes change from one\r\npart of its geographic range to another; the characters are not\r\nconstant over a wide area. Indeed, excepting the large size which\r\nremains relatively uniform over the northern two-thirds of the range,\r\nno two localities have been found from which the specimens can be said\r\nreally to agree in characters.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration, the coloration of the upper parts may be cited.\r\nNear the range of _noveboracensis_ the average coloration of\r\nindividuals from one locality is only a little lighter than in\r\n_noveboracensis_. Farther westward the average coloration is a little\r\nlighter and farther westward yet, toward the range of the extremely\r\nlight colored _longicauda_, the average coloration is lighter still.\r\nAlthough all these animals are darker than _longicauda_ and lighter\r\nthan _noveboracensis_, those from the three places do not agree among\r\nthemselves. Because of the lack of more than one character of a\r\n\"unique\" kind and because of the inconstancy, geographically, of other\r\ncharacters, and for that matter, lack of constancy geographically in\r\ncombination of characters, the writer regards _spadix_ as a barely\r\nrecognizable subspecies.\r\n\r\nExamination of the specimens of _spadix_ shows that the individual\r\nvariation in a single species is greater in a region of intergradation\r\nthan it is some distance inside the borders of the geographic range of\r\na well-marked subspecies. This is illustrated by three specimens of _M.\r\nf. spadix_ in fresh summer pelage from the single locality, Elk River,\r\nMinnesota. In these, the color of the upper parts varies from a little\r\ndarker than Cinnamon Brown to Vandyke Brown. At any one locality well\r\nwithin the range of _longicauda_, or _noveboracensis_, there is nowhere\r\nnearly so much variation in color, even in much larger series of\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nStudy of the specimens here assigned to _spadix_ reveals that some\r\nfeatures regarded as of diagnostic value for one or the other of the\r\ntwo races, _longicauda_ and _noveboracensis_, behave differently. For\r\nexample, the dark coloration of the upper parts, which is\r\ncharacteristic of _noveboracensis_, manifests itself far westward\r\nwithin the range of _spadix_ whereas the wider extent of the\r\nlight-colored underparts, which is characteristic of _longicauda_, and\r\nthe Olive Ocher, rather than Pale Orange Yellow, color of these\r\nunderparts, are seen in varying degree all the way across the range of\r\n_spadix_. Thus, these animals are colored above like _noveboracensis_\r\nand below like _longicauda_, but not _vice versa_. In these animals,\r\nthen, the _longicauda_ type of underparts is dominant, in one sense of\r\nthe word, over the _noveboracensis_ type of underparts, and the\r\n_noveboracensis_ type of upper parts is dominant over the _longicauda_\r\ntype of upper parts. Each of these features is subject to actual\r\nintergradation and does not always behave as a \"unit character,\" that\r\nis to say, one which is either present or absent. However, the\r\n_noveboracensis_ type of upper parts is carried much farther west\r\nbefore being diluted than is the _noveboracensis_ type of underparts.\r\nIndeed, within the range of _noveboracensis_ itself, the broad extent\r\nof the _longicauda_ type of underparts is manifest. This is, of course,\r\nnear the western margin of the range of _noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\nThe large size of males of _spadix_, as exemplified by specimens from\r\nElk River (see measurements on p. 421), seems to be retained across the\r\nnorthern part of the range here assigned to the subspecies. This larger\r\nsize than is found in _longicauda_ from Alberta, is shown also by some\r\nspecimens from eastern North Dakota which are assigned to _longicauda_.\r\nHowever, the average of these Dakotan specimens, all characters\r\nconsidered, is nearer to my concept of _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nInspection of the cranial measurements of _spadix_ shows also that in\r\naddition to its large size it is distinguishable from any one of the\r\ngeographically adjoining races by its relatively (to basilar length)\r\ngreater, as well as actually greater, mastoidal breadth. This might be\r\nincluded with size as a unique character distinguishing _spadix_ from\r\n_longicauda_ and _noveboracensis_. However, it is not clear whether or\r\nnot this greater mastoidal breadth is more than a function of the large\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nExcepting the greater mastoidal breadth and generally larger size of\r\nthe skull, the cranial features distinguishing males of _spadix_ from\r\n_longicauda_ are features in which _spadix_ shows approach to\r\n_noveboracensis_. This is true, in _spadix_, of the relatively longer\r\n(in comparison with _longicauda_) rostrum, relatively lesser zygomatic\r\nbreadth, relatively shallower braincase measured at the anterior end of\r\nthe basioccipital, and relatively deeper skull as measured at the\r\nposterior borders of the last upper molars. This same approach to\r\n_noveboracensis_ already has been pointed out with respect to color of\r\nthe upper parts and is evident also in the relative shortness of the\r\ntail which averages only 51 per cent of the length of the head and body\r\nrather than 55 per cent as in _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nBecause the _longicauda_ type of animal previously has been regarded as\r\nspecifically distinct from the _noveboracensis_ type of animal, comment\r\nis offered below on selected specimens, referred to _spadix_, which are\r\nregarded as intergrades with _noveboracensis_ or with other subspecies.\r\n\r\nNo. 8722, Univ. Wisconsin, adult male, in the white winter coat, from\r\nnorth central Itasca County, Minnesota, obviously has characters of _M.\r\nf. spadix_ or _longicauda_ that occur to the west and _M. f.\r\nnoveboracensis_ of the east. Selected outstanding characters of\r\n_longicauda_ are its long tail, anteriorly truncate tympanic bullae\r\nand large teeth. Characters indicating its affinities with\r\n_noveboracensis_ are smaller size of skull, general narrowness of\r\nskull, and relatively low tympanic bullae. The skull is intermediate as\r\nregards several individual structural features. For example, although\r\nlong and narrow and in this feature more nearly approaching\r\n_noveboracensis_, the skull is wider than usual in that subspecies and\r\nthus approaches that of _longicauda_ or _spadix_. The hind foot, in the\r\ndried state, measures 47 millimeters. This large hind foot, obviously\r\nlong tail (the specimen lacks external measurements), and anteriorly\r\ntruncate bullae constitute basis for here referring the specimen to\r\n_spadix_. However, the seemingly small size of the body and the narrow\r\nskull clearly show relationship to _noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\nSpecimens, referred to _spadix_, from northern Iowa, are instructive as\r\nshowing what happens where the ranges of _noveboracensis_, _primulina_,\r\n_spadix_, and perhaps _longicauda_, meet. No. 47167, Univ. Mich. Mus.\r\nZoöl., a nearly adult female, taken on November 22, 1915, at Island,\r\nClay County, and in process of assuming a brown winter pelage, retains\r\nenough of the dark summer pelage to show that the color was slightly\r\nlighter than average for _spadix_. The color pattern, white lips, and\r\nextension of light color of the underparts onto the feet, agrees with\r\n_spadix_ or _longicauda_ as does also the long tooth-row. The overall\r\nlength of the skull is intermediate between that of _spadix_ and\r\n_primulina_. The proportions of the anterior part of the skull and of\r\nthe tympanic bullae resemble those found in _primulina_. A subadult\r\nmale skull only, no. 123846, American Museum of Natural History, from\r\nWebb, Clay County, shows approach to _primulina_ in the narrowness of\r\nthe rostrum.\r\n\r\nA young male from Ruthven, Iowa, no. 48340, Univ. Michigan, has a large\r\nskull approaching in size that of _spadix_, has the _longicauda-spadix_\r\ntype of light-colored underparts and color pattern, and is slightly\r\ndarker above than true _longicauda_. Another subadult male in the white\r\nwinter coat from Palo Alto County, no. 35756, Univ. Michigan, has a\r\nlarge skull, which shows approach to _primulina_ in its narrowness\r\nanteriorly and in some other features. Although the tail is of moderate\r\nlength, the body is large as in _spadix_ or _longicauda_, and the\r\nlength of the hind foot suggests _spadix_ or _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nA subadult male, no. 425a, Iowa State College, from Manson, Iowa, in\r\nbrown winter pelage, agrees with _primulina_ in the restriction of the\r\narea of the light color of the underparts and in less expanded\r\nzygomatic arches. The teeth are intermediate in size between those of\r\n_noveboracensis_ and _primulina_ on the one hand and those of _spadix_\r\nand _longicauda_ on the other. In other respects it agrees with, or is\r\nmore nearly like, _spadix_.\r\n\r\nAn adult female, no. 426a, Iowa State College, from Barnum, in the\r\nbrown winter coat, agrees with _primulina_ except that the orbitonasal\r\nlength of the skull is more as in _spadix_ and the presence of some\r\nlight color on the lower part of the hind legs suggests _spadix_. The\r\nskull only, no. 440a, Iowa State College, labeled merely Webster\r\nCounty, Iowa, is almost a duplicate of no. 426a. A subadult male, no.\r\n427a, Iowa State College, from Moorland, Iowa, only about six miles\r\nsoutheast of Barnum, likewise is indistinguishable from _primulina_\r\nexcept for having a white winter coat and in being relatively broad in\r\nthe mastoidal region. Nevertheless, both of these animals are here\r\nreferred to _spadix_ because the average of specimens from this general\r\narea is nearer that of _spadix_. No. 497a, Iowa State College, an adult\r\nfemale in white winter pelage, from Ames, approaches _primulina_ in the\r\nnarrow rostrum and smaller teeth but otherwise approaches or even\r\nagrees with _spadix_.\r\n\r\nTwo adult males, without external measurements, from Pilot Mound, Iowa,\r\nhave skulls quite like males of _longicauda_ from Alberta. The only\r\napproach noted to eastern forms is the restricted color of the\r\nunderparts on no. 2856, Coe College, which has a brown winter coat. The\r\ncolor of the underparts is not extended so far out on the feet as in\r\n_longicauda_. Also the tympanic bullae of this specimen are a trifle\r\nnarrower. The other male, no. 2652, is in the white winter coat. The\r\none female from the same place, no. 2660, Coe College, in brown winter\r\npelage, has a skull notably unlike that of _longicauda_ or _spadix_;\r\nthe skull is narrower and practically indistinguishable from that of\r\nthe largest female skull of _primulina_ available from Lawrence,\r\nKansas, save that the tooth-row is much longer. The color pattern also\r\nagrees with that of _primulina_ or _noveboracensis_ in that the color\r\nof the underparts extends only as far as the knee on the hind legs and\r\nis narrow on the belly. Nevertheless, another adult female, no. 120a\r\nfrom Amaqua Township, some 6 miles southwest of Pilot Mound, is in all\r\nrespects typical of _spadix_. This is the more remarkable because\r\nanother comparable specimen from less than 20 miles to the southwest in\r\nWorth Township is equally typical of _primulina_.\r\n\r\nTwo young females from Chester, Iowa, nos. 2656 and 2874/2873, Coe\r\nCollege, have skulls larger than those of corresponding age of\r\n_primulina_ or _noveboracensis_. The color is as in spadix. The color\r\npattern of the underparts also is as in _spadix_ or _longicauda_ except\r\nthat the width of the area of light color on the belly is restricted\r\nsomewhat although not so much as in _noveboracensis_ or _primulina_.\r\nOf four males from the same place, also in the collection of Coe\r\nCollege, no. A2874 is a white skin only and does not provide diagnostic\r\ncharacters. The three other males, each in summer pelage, are marked\r\nand colored as are the two females from the same place except that male\r\nno. 2861 has the color of the underparts so much attenuated on the hind\r\nlegs that it barely, uninterruptedly, extends to the feet. No. 2658 is\r\nyoung, or perhaps barely subadult. The skull is large and referable to\r\n_spadix_. The two adults, nos. 2861 and 2657, differ cranially from\r\ntypical (Elk River, Minn.) _spadix_ only in being slightly narrower\r\nacross the mastoids and in having the bullae a little narrower. In\r\nthese departures they show some approach to _primulina_ and to\r\n_noveboracensis_. Another male, subadult, no. 2867, Coe College, from\r\nDecorah, which has acquired half of the white winter coat, agrees with\r\nthe males from Chester except that the preorbital part of the skull is\r\nshortened much as in some specimens of _primulina_.\r\n\r\nFrom Lansing, in extreme northeastern Iowa, a large subadult male, no.\r\n2864, Coe College, of 453 mm. in total length and half through with\r\nacquiring the white winter coat, agrees with the males previously\r\ndescribed from Chester except in having the palate narrower as in\r\n_noveboracensis_. The adult female available from Lansing, no.\r\n2863/2862, Coe College, in white winter pelage except for the top of\r\nthe head, although a large skin, has a skull smaller than that of any\r\n_spadix_ or _longicauda_ and of about the same size as that of no.\r\n3838, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., of _primulina_, from Lawrence,\r\nKansas, except that the skull of no. 2863/2862 is much narrower across\r\nthe mastoids. This specimen, then, shows approach to _noveboracensis_\r\nin narrowness of the mastoidal region, to _primulina_ in other respects\r\nand to _spadix_.\r\n\r\nMany of these instructive specimens from Iowa, made available to the\r\npresent writer by Mr. W. F. Kubichek, were brought together at the Coe\r\nCollege Museum by the late B. H. Bailey. Most of them were obtained\r\nfrom trappers who did not supply the conventional external measurements\r\ntaken in the flesh. Even though these are lacking, the specimens\r\nclearly show that actual intergradation occurs where the ranges of _M.\r\nf. longicauda_, _spadix_, _noveboracensis_ and _primulina_ meet.\r\n\r\nThe dark color of the upper parts, restriction of the color of the\r\nunderparts on the ankles with the result that the color reaches the\r\ntoes in interrupted fashion, and large skull, of no. 18912 of the\r\nMuseum of the University of South Dakota, from Roberts County, South\r\nDakota, clearly place this specimen with _spadix_, rather than with\r\n_longicauda_. Likewise, male, subadult, no. 11376, Univ. South Dakota,\r\nfrom Clay County, South Dakota, is referable to _spadix_. Although\r\nwithout external measurements, the specimen obviously is large. The\r\npatch of summer pelage on its head and neck is darker than the summer\r\npelage of _longicauda_, and the orbitonasal length is greater than the\r\nlength of the tympanic bullae; all these features are characters of\r\n_spadix_. The adult male from Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, no. 188407,\r\nUnited States National Museum, figured by Merriam (1896, p. 20, figs.\r\n7-9), is almost exactly intermediate between _longicauda_ and _spadix_,\r\nalthough here referred to the latter.\r\n\r\nFive specimens, nos. 147375, 147432, 147762, 148720 and 148721, U. S.\r\nNat. Mus., including 3 skulls only from Beemer, Cuming County,\r\nNebraska, are intergrades between _M. f. longicauda_, _M. f. primulina_\r\nand _M. f. spadix_. One skin is in white winter pelage and the other, a\r\nfemale, is in summer pelage which in coloration and color pattern\r\nagrees with that of _spadix_. External measurements of the male agree\r\nwith those of _longicauda_. Measurements of the female agree with those\r\nof _spadix_ except that the tail is shorter as in _primulina_. The\r\nskulls are as long as in _longicauda_ but are more slender than in\r\neither _longicauda_ or _spadix_ although nearer the latter in this\r\nrespect. In dorsal aspect, the skulls especially posteriorly to the\r\norbital region, resemble _primulina_. All points considered, the\r\nanimals seem best referred to _spadix_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the degree of development of certain morphological features\r\nhas been settled upon as indicative of the race _spadix_, some doubt\r\nremains as to where the western boundary of its range should be shown.\r\nThis results from the fact that color has been taken into account as\r\none diagnostic feature and this feature is lacking in the white winter\r\nspecimens which, from the following places, are all that are available:\r\nKittson County, Minnesota; Moorhead, Minnesota; Casselton and Valley\r\nCity in North Dakota; Armour, South Dakota and Clay County, South\r\nDakota. In summary, more specimens in the summer coat will be required\r\nto establish definitely the boundary between the ranges of _longicauda_\r\nand _spadix_.\r\n\r\nSurber (1932:49) has referred to additional specimens of this weasel in\r\nthe University of Minnesota Museum as from Winona, Hennepin and Isanti\r\ncounties of that state.\r\n\r\nAt Elk River, Minnesota, B. Bailey (1929:156) found this species to be\r\nabout half as abundant as _Mustela cicognanii_ and that it is \"more\r\noften found in the open timber and about the dry ridges and fields.\"\r\nOf seventeen adult or subadult skulls of this race from Minnesota, ten\r\nhave obvious marks of infestation of the frontal sinuses. In no skull,\r\nhowever, has the infestation resulted in so much malformation, as\r\noccurs in _noveboracensis_.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 76, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states and from north to south by counties in each state.\r\n\r\n     =Iowa.= _Lyon County_: Granite, 1[65]. _Howard County_: Chester,\r\n     6[12]. _Winneshiek County_: Decorah, 1[12]; 8 mi.

No. 43.3.3.3 [from Carlton\r\n     House, Saskatchewan] in the British Museum of Natural History has\r\n     been regarded by several zoölogists as the type. It is a subadult\r\n     female, skull and skin, from North America. See the account of _M.\r\n     erminea cicognanii_ for reasons for and reasons against regarding\r\n     this specimen as the holotype.\r\n\r\n     No. 43.3.3.3 from the collection of Dr. John Richardson is in the\r\n     white winter coat and now (Sept. 24, 1937) is prepared as a study\r\n     skin. Evidences of its once having been mounted are: holes in the\r\n     soles of the hind feet for supporting-wires, large straight wire\r\n     in the tail, folds in the skin of the now backward-projecting hind\r\n     feet, and unevenness of the skin on the back resulting from\r\n     straightening out the specimen. The tip of the tail and some skin\r\n     from the middle of the belly are missing. Otherwise the skin is\r\n     intact. The skull is that of an animal in its first year, lacks\r\n     the zygomatic arch on each side, but otherwise is complete and\r\n     unbroken. The teeth all are present and entire except that p2 on\r\n     the right side is missing from its alveolus.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Transition and Upper Sonoran life-zones of the Great\r\n     Plains, southward from central Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern\r\n     Manitoba through eastern Montana, the Dakotas and Nebraska into\r\n     southeastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado and western Kansas.\r\n     See figure 29 on page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f.\r\n     primulina_ in near (_h_) Clay Color rather than Brussels Brown of\r\n     upper parts, least width of color of underparts more than 40 per\r\n     cent of greatest width of color of upper parts, color of\r\n     underparts extended onto hind foot rather than stopped short of\r\n     ankle, zygomatic breadth more than 28.8 in adult males and more\r\n     than 24.1 in adult females; from _M. f. spadix_ in lighter color\r\n     being near (_h_) Clay Color, in males by deeper occiput in which\r\n     the depth of the skull, exclusive of the sagittal crest and taken\r\n     at the anterior border of the basioccipital amounts to more than\r\n     59 per cent of the mastoid breadth; from _M. f. oribasus_ in near\r\n     (_h_) Clay Color rather than near (14_n_) Brussels Brown color of\r\n     the upper parts and in males by deeper occiput in which the depth\r\n     of the skull, exclusive of the sagittal crest and taken at the\r\n     anterior border of the basioccipital, amounts to more than 59 per\r\n     cent of the mastoid breadth; from _M. f. alleni_ in larger size,\r\n     adult males having a total length of more than 400 millimeters,\r\n     hind foot more than 45, basilar length more than 43.5, and females\r\n     having a total length of more than 375 and basilar length not less\r\n     than 40.0; from _M. f. nevadensis_ in near (_h_) Clay Color rather\r\n     than near (14_n_ to 1) Brussels Brown of upper parts, basilar\r\n     length more than 40 in females and averaging more than 45 in\r\n     males; from _M. f. neomexicana_ by near (_h_) Clay Color rather\r\n     than Buckthorn Brown color of upper parts, absence of white and\r\n     Argus Brown facial markings, and length of tooth-rows amounting to\r\n     more than 37 per cent of basilar length.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Five adults from Alberta yield\r\n     average and extreme measurements as follows: Total length, 438\r\n     (418-473); length of tail, 158 (140-193); length of hind foot, 50\r\n     (46-54). Tail averages 56 per cent as long as head and body.\r\n     Length of hind foot averaging more than basal length.\r\n     Corresponding measurements of five adults and subadults from North\r\n     Dakota are as follows: 465 (445-516); 164 (150-179); 51 (50-54).\r\n     Tail averages 55 per cent as long as head and body.\r\n\r\n     Female: Six adults (Alberta, 4; Saskatchewan, 1; Manitoba, 1)\r\n     yield average and extreme measurements as follows: Total length,\r\n     401 (383-425); length of tail, 145 (141-159); length of hind foot,\r\n     43 (41-44). Tail averages 57 per cent as long as head and body.\r\n     Length of hind foot more or less than (approximately equal to)\r\n     basal length.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes\r\n     are: Total length, 37; length of tail, 13; length of hind foot, 7.\r\n     General comparisons indicate that the Alberta-taken males may not\r\n     attain so large a size as those from some other areas. Thus the\r\n     differences in external measurements might be some greater\r\n     elsewhere, say, in North Dakota.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black, brown or white\r\n     (often all three colors in same specimen) and extending beyond\r\n     ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts and extending to\r\n     apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of foot-soles (in summer\r\n     pelage) only slightly greater than shown in figure 20.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Winter pelage all white except tip of tail. Summer\r\n     pelage with upper parts near (_h_) Clay Color or near tone 3 and 4\r\n     of Snuff Brown of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 303. Chin and upper\r\n     lips white. Remainder of underparts ranging from near (_a_) Olive\r\n     Ocher to near (16´) Ochraceous Buff. Upper parts of uniform color\r\n     except for occasional darkening of head in front of ears. Color of\r\n     underparts extends distally on posterior sides of forelegs over\r\n     toes onto antipalmar faces of feet and wrists, on medial sides of\r\n     hind limbs to ankles over antiplantar faces of toes and\r\n     distomedial third of each tarsus, and over proximal fourth to\r\n     third of under side of tail. Least width of color of underparts\r\n     averaging, in a series of 10 males from Alberta, 58 (45-60) per\r\n     cent of greatest width of color of upper parts. Corresponding\r\n     figures for 10 females from the same place are 57 (50-74). Black\r\n     tip of tail in same series of males, most of which are in full\r\n     summer pelage, averaging 43 (35-60) mm. long. Thus, averaging\r\n     shorter than hind foot and 27 per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     As compared with _M. f. neomexicana_, _longicauda_ lacks the white\r\n     facial markings, black ears, black forehead and nose, but\r\n     otherwise is similarly colored. As compared with _M. f.\r\n     nevadensis_, _M. f. oribasus_ and _M. f. spadix_, each of color\r\n     pattern similar to _longicauda_, selected differences of\r\n     _longicauda_ are its much lighter color, especially of the upper\r\n     parts, with less conspicuous darkening on the nose. From _M. f.\r\n     primulina_, _longicauda_ differs in lighter color of upper parts,\r\n     reddish rather than yellowish underparts, and light rather than\r\n     dark-colored hind feet.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 5 adults from Alberta): See\r\n     measurements and plates 16-18; weight, 4.7 (4.6-4.9) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 46.0 (44.7-46.8); zygomatic breadth more than\r\n     distance between condylar foramen and M1 or than between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid\r\n     breadth more than postpalatal length; postorbital breadth less\r\n     than length of upper premolars and more than width of\r\n     basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen lacerum\r\n     posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth greater than\r\n     distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla; breadth of rostrum more or less (usually less) than length\r\n     of tympanic bulla; least width of palate less than greatest length\r\n     of P4; anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to\r\n     foramen ovale as width of 3 to 4 (including I3) upper incisors;\r\n     height of tympanic bulla more than distance from its anterior\r\n     margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length\r\n     of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and longer or shorter than\r\n     rostrum; anterior margin of masseteric fossa below talonid of m1\r\n     or anterior half of m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 5 adults: Alberta, 3; N. D., 1; Sask., 1.): See\r\n     measurements and plates 31-33; weight, 3.1 (2.8-3.5) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 42.3 (40.0-43.7); zygomatic breadth more or less\r\n     (approximately equal to) than distance between condylar foramen\r\n     and M1 or that between anterior palatine foramen and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; postorbital breadth less than length of\r\n     upper premolars and more or less than width of basioccipital\r\n     measured from medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to\r\n     its opposite; least width of palate not more than greatest length\r\n     of P4; tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width\r\n     of 3 to 4 (including I3) upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla\r\n     not less than distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale;\r\n     length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar and\r\n     premolar tooth-rows and longer or shorter than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 34 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the male.\r\n\r\n     Comparisons of the skull with those of _M. f. primulina_, _M. f.\r\n     spadix_, _M. f. oribasus_, _M. f. alleni_, _M. f. nevadensis_, and\r\n     _M. f. neomexicana_ are made in accounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Richardson's (1829:47) account on which Bonaparte may be\r\nsaid to have based his name, records measurements in inches and lines\r\nwhich I transpose into millimeters as follows: Total length, 440 mm.;\r\nlength of head and body, 305; length of tail (vertebrae), 135; length\r\nof tail (including fur), 164 mm. Specimen no. 43.3.3.3 in the British\r\nMuseum, which has by some persons been regarded as the type, yields\r\nmeasurements as follows: Total length, 408 (which allows for 15 mm.\r\nloss of the fleshy part of the end of the tail); length of head and\r\nbody, 272; length of tail (vertebrae), 136 (= 121 + 15); length of tail\r\n(including fur), 162 (142 + 20 mm. that appears to have been lost).\r\nRichardson's specimen would appear to have been of unusual proportions\r\nand to have been larger than no. 43.3.3.3. Some reasons for and reasons\r\nagainst regarding this specimen as the holotype are given in the\r\naccount of _M. erminea cicognanii_.\r\n\r\nThe name _longicauda_ was applied to practically all long-tailed\r\nweasels of the western United States at one time but as one after\r\nanother of the geographic variants in the mountainous regions were\r\ndesignated as separable, the name _longicauda_ came to be restricted to\r\nthe light-colored, relatively large, animal of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nThe intergradation of _longicauda_ with _spadix_ and _oribasus_ has\r\nbeen commented on in the discussions of those subspecies. The larger\r\nsize and darker color of specimens referred to _longicauda_ from Devils\r\nLake and Grafton, North Dakota, are features indicative of\r\nintergradation there with _spadix_. Two young females from Waterton\r\nLake Park, Alberta, by their darker than average color, suggest\r\nintergradation with _oribasus_, as, for that matter, does the specimen\r\nfrom Waterton Lake [= Chief Mountain Lake, in Montana] itself, which,\r\nhowever, is even darker than the two specimens taken on the Canadian\r\nside of the line and hence is referred to _oribasus_. An adult female,\r\nno. 175586, U. S. Nat. Mus., from Moose Pass, Alberta, examined after\r\nthe above was written, is larger than any other female seen of\r\n_longicauda_ and in this respect may show approach to _oribasus_, which\r\nin the northern part of its range is of large size as judged by males\r\nfrom the Bowron Lake region.\r\n\r\nOne male, no. 8564, Nat. Mus. Canada, from Max Lake, Turtle Mountain,\r\nManitoba, presents puzzling characters. The external measurements of\r\n465, 170, and 57, are in keeping with the great length of the skull\r\nwhich has a basilar length of 48.8. The tooth-rows are 19.3 in length\r\nand the mastoid breadth, 25.4. The relative narrowness indicated by the\r\nmastoid breadth is maintained throughout the skull. The only other\r\nspecimens relating to the Turtle Mountains that have been seen are two\r\nmale, skins without measurements or corresponding skulls, nos. 38902\r\nand 38903, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., labeled as from either \"Stump Lake or\r\nTurtle Mts.,\" North Dakota. One of these, no. 38902, is much darker\r\nthan the other. Possibly it is from the Turtle Mountains and the other,\r\nlighter-colored one, is from Stump Lake. Study of additional specimens\r\nfrom the Turtle Mountains might show the existence there of a distinct\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nFour specimens, in the collection of Myron Swenk, from Inland, Clay\r\nCounty, Nebraska, are instructive as showing how intergradation occurs\r\nbetween _primulina_ and _longicauda_. A subadult male, no. 10, is\r\nintermediate in external measurements and in color but in each instance\r\nis nearer _primulina_. The same is true of the least width of the color\r\nof the underparts. The color of the underparts extends uninterruptedly\r\nover the hind legs to the toes as in _longicauda_, but is absent from\r\nthe underside of the tail as in _primulina_. In the skull, the basilar\r\nlength, breadth of bulla, and size of teeth are nearer _longicauda_, as\r\nare also the ratios to the basilar length of the length of tooth-rows,\r\nbreadth of the rostrum, length of the tympanic bulla, and depth of the\r\nbraincase at the anterior margin of the basioccipital. Ratios to the\r\nbasilar length of the interorbital breadth, mastoid breadth, zygomatic\r\nbreadth, and depth of the skull at the posterior borders of the upper\r\nmolars are nearer to those of _primulina_. The relatively long rostrum,\r\nas represented by the orbitonasal length, is nearest to that of\r\n_spadix_. A young, almost subadult, female, no. 7, agrees with\r\n_primulina_ in color, color pattern, and length of hind foot. The other\r\nexternal measurements are intermediate, but nearer those of\r\n_primulina_. Size of skull and teeth are as in _longicauda_. Relative\r\nproportions of parts of the skull are not diagnostic in specimens as\r\nyoung as this female. An adult female, skull only, no. 8, agrees with,\r\nor approaches nearer to, _longicauda_ in size of skull and teeth and in\r\nrelative proportion of every part studied. A juvenile, skull only, of\r\nquestionable sex, no. 9, provides no diagnostic characters. On the\r\nbasis of color, these specimens from Inland are distinctly nearer\r\n_primulina_. On the basis of cranial characters they are distinctly\r\nnearer _longicauda_. External measurements are intermediate and are a\r\nlittle nearer those of _primulina_. By placing the most weight on the\r\ncranial characters, the animals may be referred to _longicauda_. The\r\nsame may be said of 2 skins, one skin with a skull, from Hastings,\r\nNebraska. In each skin the color-pattern is as in _primulina_; in one\r\nthe under side of the tail is nevertheless lighter-colored more as in\r\n_longicauda_ and the skull, adult male 121651 American Museum of\r\nNatural History, approaches nearer to _primulina_ in narrowness but has\r\nthe large teeth of _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _neomexicana_ is suggested by one specimen, no.\r\n7936, Univ. Kans., from Thomas County, Kansas, which has well-developed\r\nwhite facial markings.\r\n\r\nThe specimen, no. 180, Kansas Agric. College, from Glasco, is mounted,\r\nof large size, in white winter pelage, and lacks external measurements.\r\nOn the basis of its obvious large size, and a hind foot measurement of\r\n49 millimeters obtained from the mounted skin, the animal is\r\nprovisionally referred to _longicauda_ rather than to _primulina_.\r\n\r\n_Putorius culbertsoni_ is a name now credited to Coues (1877:136).\r\nAlthough Coues probably intended only to indicate that Baird wrote this\r\nname on the labels of two specimens in the mammal collection of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, Coues gave an \"indication\" of the application\r\nof the name by publishing at the same time the catalogue numbers of\r\nspecimens whose labels bore the name and thus, in accordance with\r\narticle 21 of the International Rules of Zoölogical Nomenclature,\r\nhimself becomes the author of the name. Of the two specimens mentioned\r\nby Coues, only the first recorded by him, no. 4320 (with skull no.\r\n37995, U. S. Nat. Mus.), can now be found.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the skull of this specimen labeled (see Lyon and Osgood,\r\n1909:218) as taken at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, is well preserved. Its\r\nonly defects are a fracture in the left zygomatic arch and the absence\r\nof parts of each of the first lower molars. In deciding on the\r\nsubspecific application of the name _Putorius culbertsoni_ Coues, the\r\nskull of the type must be principally relied upon, for there is\r\navailable only one other specimen, a skin only (no. 12596, U. S. Nat.\r\nMus.), from the same place, and it, like the type, is in white winter\r\npelage and lacks flesh measurements.\r\n\r\nThe ranges as now known of three subspecies of _Mustela frenata_\r\napproach near to Fort Laramie. These are _M. f. longicauda_, _M. f.\r\nalleni_, and _M. f. nevadensis_. The skull of the type of _culbertsoni_\r\nis not typical of any one of the three mentioned races. The small size\r\nof its teeth and relative (to basilar length) shallowness of the\r\nfrontal region of the skull through the postorbital processes of the\r\nfrontal are as in _nevadensis_. The zygomatic arches are not so greatly\r\nexpanded as in some specimens of _longicauda_ and are more like the\r\naverage for _nevadensis_ or _alleni_, as also is the relatively (to\r\nbasilar length) long orbitonasal length. However, each of these\r\ncharacters is subject to variation and alone is not surely diagnostic,\r\nespecially toward the margin of the range of any one of the subspecies\r\nconcerned. The same may be said of the relatively great breadth of the\r\nskull interorbitally--a feature typically found in _longicauda_. More\r\nimportant, in my estimation, is the large size of the skull; all parts\r\nmeasured (excepting the teeth, the depth at the posterior border of the\r\nlast upper molars, the zygomatic breadth, and the depth of the tympanic\r\nbullae) equal or approach nearest to the average for males of\r\n_longicauda_ of similar age.\r\n\r\nThe small size of _alleni_ prevents its identification with\r\n_culbertsoni_. The question of application lies between _nevadensis_\r\nand _longicauda_. If the long-tailed weasel at Fort Laramie is found to\r\nbe referable to the race earlier named _longicauda_, no change in\r\ncurrent nomenclature will be effected. If, on the other hand, the\r\nlong-tailed weasel from Fort Laramie is found to be referable to\r\n_nevadensis_ this name will have to fall before the earlier proposed\r\nname _culbertsoni_. There is, however, a third possibility, namely,\r\nthat the long-tailed weasel of the Transition and Upper Sonoran zones\r\nof southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, as for example, at Lay,\r\nColorado, may represent a recognizable race characterized by size about\r\nas in _longicauda_, relative proportions of skull about as in\r\n_nevadensis_ and coloration intermediate, to which the name\r\n_culbertsoni_ may apply. For more detailed discussion of this\r\npossibility, see remarks under _M. f. nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory application of the name _Putorius culbertsoni_ Coues\r\nrequires an adequate series of adult specimens, of both sexes in the\r\nsummer coat with external measurements taken in the flesh, from the\r\ntype locality and like material from elsewhere in southern Wyoming. On\r\nthe evidence furnished by the skull of the type of _culbertsoni_, that\r\nname tentatively is placed in the synonomy of _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nOnly 2 of 25 adults examined for malformation of the frontal sinuses by\r\nparasites showed evidence of disease.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 138, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by provinces and states and further by districts or counties from\r\n     north to south except as otherwise indicated.

As described in _Mustela frenata longicauda_ except\r\n     that: Weight, 5.0 (3.8-6.0) grams; basilar length, 46.7\r\n     (43.6-48.8); postorbital breadth in one of nine instances less\r\n     than width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one\r\n     foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth\r\n     more or less than distance between foramen opticum and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum less than length of\r\n     tympanic bulla; anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior\r\n     to foramen ovale as width of 2-1/2 to 5 upper incisors; length of\r\n     tympanic bulla not less than length of lower molar and premolar\r\n     tooth-row and shorter than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on the type, specimen): See measurements and plates\r\n     31-33, 40. As described in _Mustela frenata longicauda_ except\r\n     that: Weight, 3.5 grams; basilar length, 41.6 mm.; zygomatic\r\n     breadth more than distance between anterior palatine foramen and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla; postorbital breadth more than\r\n     width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen\r\n     lacerum posterior to its opposite; least width of palate more than\r\n     outside length of P^{4}; tympanic bulla as far posterior to\r\n     foramen ovale as width of 4-1/2 upper incisors; height of tympanic\r\n     bulla less than distance from anterior margin of tympanic bulla to\r\n     foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla less than length of\r\n     rostrum. If more than one skull were available of the female of\r\n     _oribasus_ it is believed that the description would agree with\r\n     that of _longicauda_ in nearly all features.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female is 30 per cent lighter than that of the\r\n     average male.\r\n\r\nComparison with _longicauda_ reveals that, on the average, skulls of\r\nmales are larger, relative to the basilar length broader across the\r\nmastoids, shallower through the braincase as measured at the anterior\r\nend of the basioccipital exclusive of the sagittal crest, with longer\r\nrostrum. Compared with _nevadensis_, the skull averages larger in all\r\nmeasurements taken, and has a relatively broader rostrum, relatively\r\ngreater mastoid breadth and a braincase which is shallower relative to\r\nthe basilar length. By weight, the skull of _nevadensis_ is a fourth\r\nlighter, and in linear measurements 5 to 18 per cent smaller.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Some of the specimens from Montana, which here are referred\r\nto _oribasus_, more than half a century ago were listed by Coues\r\n(1877:138) under the name _longicauda_. It was not until 1899 that this\r\nrace was given a name by Bangs, who at that time (1899B:81) accurately\r\nmade out the distinctive color features. Distinctive cranial characters\r\ncannot be described with assurance even now because there still are too\r\nfew specimens.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen, at one time examined by the present writer, has on\r\nthe stuffed skin no well-developed mammae, scrotal pouch, or other\r\nvisible sexual part. Probably the collector's sex mark for female is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nAs judged by the two skulls of subadult males from the Barkerville\r\nregion, individuals of this race attain larger size than do those of\r\n_longicauda_. On the basis of larger size than either _longicauda_ or\r\n_nevadensis_, the specimens from the Rocky Mountains of Montana and two\r\nfrom northern Wyoming are referred to this race. The short, wide, flat,\r\ntympanic bullae, relatively great mastoidal breadth, and some other\r\nfeatures of the specimen from Donovan, Montana, point toward\r\n_oribasus_, whereas nearly as many more cranial features, in this\r\ninstance mainly differences in size, are indicative of _nevadensis_ to\r\nwhich race the specimen might almost equally well be referred. Another\r\nmale from Darby, in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, has a slightly\r\nlonger hind foot than those from Florence, but a female from Hamilton,\r\nagrees more nearly with _nevadensis_. The average of all the specimens\r\nfrom the Bitterroot Valley is a little nearer _oribasus_. Four skulls\r\nfrom Buffalo, Wyoming, here referred to _nevadensis_ show approach to\r\n_oribasus_ in size of skull. The specimens from Big Snowy Mountains,\r\nand the Highwood Mountains of Montana are too young clearly to show\r\nsize of the adult skull, but are distinctly darker colored than\r\n_longicauda_ of the plains country proper. Of two subadult females from\r\nTacy, Montana, the color of the one in summer pelage is distinctly\r\nnearer that of _oribasus_ and _nevadensis_ than it is to that of\r\n_longicauda_ to which some approach in color might be expected. The\r\nreduced size of both of the specimens is further suggestive of\r\n_nevadensis_ and it may be that adult specimens from these more eastern\r\nmountainous areas in Montana will show that _nevadensis_ is the name\r\nproper to apply to animals of this region.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _nevadensis_ is suggested by specimens collected\r\nfrom along the upper reaches of Okanagan Lake, British Columbia, by\r\nMajor Allan Brooks and Mr. J. A. Munro and by a series of skulls from\r\nIone, Pend Orielle County, Washington, lent me by Mr. Walter Dalquest.\r\nAt each place, the average of all specimens is nearest to that of\r\n_nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from near Waterton Lake show several steps in the transition\r\nfrom the light-colored _longicauda_ type of coloration to the darker\r\ncoloration characterizing _oribasus_. One taken here, at a time when\r\nthe body of water referred to seems to have been known as Chief\r\nMountain Lake, is barely dark enough to be placed with _oribasus_. Two\r\nother specimens from across the Canadian Border labeled as \"Waterton\r\nLake Park\" are slightly lighter colored above, and on this account are\r\nplaced with _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nThe two adult males from Lillooet, British Columbia, are referable to\r\n_oribasus_ although neither is quite typical. One has a saturated\r\ncoloration suggestive of that of _altifrontalis_ and the skull is\r\nshorter and broader than in other specimens of _oribasus_. The female\r\nfrom Lillooet, skin alone, no. 916, Prov. Mus., B. C. is small for\r\n_oribasus_. The female, no. 1539, collection of Kenneth Racey, from\r\nAlta Lake, in brown winter pelage, in almost every measurement falls\r\nnearly midway between _altifrontalis_ and _oribasus_ but slightly\r\nnearer the latter. The skull from Chezacut and 3 animals from Wistaria,\r\nBritish Columbia, probably are females and show a greater average size\r\nthan specimens from farther to the southeast. For example, the basilar\r\nlength of the skull, 44.8 (44.3 to 45.1), exceeds that of the type\r\nspecimen. The animals from Wistaria on Ootsa Lake furnish the\r\nnorthwesternmost station of occurrence of which I have record for this\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\nThe northernmost records of occurrence, at \"Clearwater River, Peace\r\nRiver, B. C,\" and at Little Prairie, are furnished by a white skin\r\nwithout skull, no. 257450, U. S. Nat. Mus., purchased on August 2,\r\n1932, at the place mentioned by W. H. Sheldon and Richard Borden, and a\r\nskull with white winter skin, no. 3585, Provincial Museum, British\r\nColumbia, respectively. The characters distinguishing _longicauda_ and\r\n_oribasus_ are not shown by white winter skins; the skull shows some\r\nfeatures of _longicauda_, and the reference of these specimens to\r\n_oribasus_ rather than _longicauda_ is tentative.\r\n\r\nOnly the skull from Little Prairie shows evidence of infestation of the\r\nfrontal sinuses by parasites. In the Barkerville area of British\r\nColumbia, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas T. McCabe obtained only 2 skulls of this\r\nsubspecies from a total of 238 weasel skulls gathered by local\r\ntrappers. The others were _Mustela erminea_.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 46, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south and unless otherwise indicated, in the United\r\n     States National Museum.\r\n\r\n     =British Columbia.= West of Hudson Hope, 1[7]; Clearwater River,\r\n     tributary to Peace River, 1; Little Prairie, a few miles south of\r\n     Peace River and about 40 miles west of the main highway between\r\n     Dawson Creek and Fort St. John, 1[85]; Wistaria, 3[85]; Four Mile\r\n     Creek, 4 mi.

Vernon\r\nBailey obtained only the one specimen, the type, on his trip in 1888,\r\nbut two more were obtained for the American Museum of Natural History\r\nby Walter Granger in 1894.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata alleni_ combines the light coloration of _M. f.\r\nlongicauda_ with the small size of _M. f. nevadensis_. Indeed, the size\r\nmay average less than that of _nevadensis_. _M. f. alleni_ seems to\r\nreach its extreme of small size in the Black Hills of South Dakota.\r\nSpecimens from Mitchell, Scottsbluff County, Nebraska, here referred\r\nto alleni are of larger size and in this respect are intermediate\r\nbetween the subspecies _alleni_ and _longicauda_. Of the two specimens\r\navailable from Chadron, Nebraska, and here referred to as _longicauda_,\r\nthe female, M1 #6, is almost exactly intermediate in size between\r\n_alleni_ and _longicauda_, whereas the male, Ml #11, is as large as the\r\naverage-sized _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nNone of the nine skulls (5 adults) shows malformation resulting from\r\nthe infestation of the frontal sinuses with parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 10, as follows.\r\n\r\n     =Wyoming.= _Crook County_: Sundance, 1[91].\r\n\r\n     =South Dakota.= _Pennington County_: Hill City, 1[2]; 20 mi.

The color is as\r\n     in _M. f. nevadensis_.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 55211, 65231, and 248993; see\r\n     p. 422): See measurements and plates 19-21; weight 2.7 and 3.1\r\n     grams; basilar length, 40.4; zygomatic breadth more than distance\r\n     between condylar foramen and Ml or than between anterior palatine\r\n     foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth\r\n     more than postpalatal length; postorbital breadth less than length\r\n     of upper premolars and more than width of basioccipital measured\r\n     from medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its\r\n     opposite; interorbital breadth more or less than distance between\r\n     foramen opticum and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; breadth of\r\n     rostrum less than length of tympanic bulla; least width of palate\r\n     more or less than medial length of P4; anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3-1/2\r\n     (including I3) upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla more than\r\n     distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of\r\n     tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar-premolar tooth-row\r\n     and longer or shorter than rostrum; anterior margin of masseteric\r\n     fossa below talonid of m1.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on the type specimen): See measurements and plates\r\n     31-33; weight, 1.6 grams; basilar length, 35.5; zygomatic breadth\r\n     less than distance between condylar foramen and M1 and more than\r\n     distance between anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of\r\n     tympanic bulla (nearly equal in each instance); postorbital\r\n     breadth less than length of upper premolars and greater (7.1-8.4)\r\n     than width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one\r\n     foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; least width of palate\r\n     equal to inside length of P4; tympanic bulla as far posterior to\r\n     foramen ovale as width of 3 (including I3) upper incisors; height\r\n     of tympanic bulla more than distance from its anterior margin to\r\n     foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower\r\n     molar-premolar tooth-row and greater than length of rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 41 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the male.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. nevadensis_, that of _arizonensis_ is\r\nsmaller, less heavily ridged and has more inflated tympanic bullae and\r\na relatively greater mastoid breadth. Comparison with the skull of _M.\r\nf. neomexicana_ is made in the account of that subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--In 1891 Mearns (234-235) named this weasel as a full\r\nspecies on the basis of two individuals taken by him in 1886 and 1887.\r\nSince that time only a few additional specimens have been preserved.\r\nOnly four are adults. Although this material does not permit of a\r\ndefinition of the subspecies as precise as could be wished, still, it\r\nclearly shows that the animals from the plateau region of Arizona are\r\nrecognizably different from those farther north in the Sierra Nevada of\r\nCalifornia and those of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin region\r\nnorthward to the Canadian border. These more northern animals have gone\r\nby Mearns' name, _arizonensis_, since the date of its proposal until\r\n1939 when the name _nevadensis_ was proposed.\r\n\r\nThe smaller size, especially of the skull, and the greater inflation of\r\nthe tympanic bullae are the outstanding characters which distinguish\r\n_arizonensis_ from the similarly marked _nevadensis_. The bullae are\r\nrelatively much inflated throughout but especially so on the\r\nposteromedial parts.\r\n\r\nAlthough the three adult males and two subadult females available of\r\nthis subspecies are smaller in most parts measured than any of the\r\nscores of _nevadensis_ of similar age that have been measured, overlap\r\nin size probably will be found as additional specimens of _arizonensis_\r\nbecome available. A young female, no. 18513, coll. D. R. Dickey, from\r\nLittle Spring, does have certain cranial measurements as large as are\r\nfound in the minimum-sized _nevadensis_ from farther north.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with the two subspecies whose geographic ranges adjoin\r\nthat of _arizonensis_ is indicated by specimens at hand. One of these\r\nis the adult male from 25 miles southeast of Flagstaff, which shows\r\ndecided approach to _neomexicana_, in color and in possessing white\r\nfacial markings less well developed than in _neomexicana_. Even better\r\ndeveloped white facial markings, with intervening blackish coloration,\r\nare displayed by no. 148271, U. S. Nat. Mus., from 8500 feet altitude\r\non Willow Creek, New Mexico. This subadult female shows approach to\r\n_neomexicana_ also in larger size of the skull and entire animal. The\r\ngreat inflation of the posterior part of each of its bullae and the\r\ndark color of the upper parts are characters of _arizonensis_. The\r\ncolor of the underparts stops at the ankles leaving the hind feet dark\r\ncolored, in which respect the specimen is unlike either _neomexicana_\r\nor _arizonensis_. If additional specimens showing the same characters\r\nas this one be found at other nearby localities they probably should be\r\ngiven recognition as a separate subspecies. For the present it seems\r\nbest to regard the specimen merely as an intergrade. Although it might,\r\nwith almost equal propriety, be referred to either _neomexicana_ or\r\n_arizonensis_, the specimen is here placed with the latter. The\r\nsubadult male from Springerville, Arizona, is of larger size than the\r\ntopotypical male of _arizonensis_ and in this respect shows slight\r\napproach to _nevadensis_. The narrower mastoidal breadth and slightly\r\nless inflated tympanic bullae of the male from the Kaibab Plateau may\r\nreflect merely individual variation or may represent intergradation in\r\nthese features with _nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nThe statement made by Merriam (1896:22) that, \"The type specimen . . .\r\nis an immature female and is of unusually small size. A male obtained\r\nby him [Mearns] near the same place is of the normal size, as is\r\nanother male in the Department collection from Springerville, Ariz.,\r\ncollected by E. W. Nelson,\" needs correction. The female is not\r\nimmature. The specimen obtained by Mearns near the same place probably\r\nrefers to Amer. Mus. No. 2489, from Quaking Asp Settlement, which lacks\r\nboth the skull and external measurements. As stuffed it is of small\r\nsize for a male. The male from Springerville, as shown by the external\r\nand cranial measurements, is not of normal (_i. e._ average) size, but\r\nis smaller than the average for the other populations of similarly\r\ncolored weasels referred to by Merriam (_op. cit._) as _arizonensis_\r\nbut here described under the name _nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nNone of the skulls shows signs of infestation of the frontal sinuses by\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 17, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states and from north to south by counties in each state.\r\n     Unless otherwise indicated specimens are in the collection of the\r\n     United States National Museum.\r\n\r\n     =Arizona.= _Coconino County_: VT Park, Kaibab Plateau, 1; Deadman\r\n     Flat, 6400 ft., 1[74]; Little Spring, 1[59]; Government Prairie,\r\n     near Parks, 1[74]; _Coconino?

Tail\r\n     averages 60 per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind foot\r\n     averaging more than basal length. Corresponding measurements of\r\n     twelve adults from extreme southern and southwestern Colorado are\r\n     as follows: 407 (355-431); 150 (133-170); 46.0 (42-49).\r\n\r\n     Female: Ten adults from the Sierra Nevada of California yield\r\n     average and extreme measurements as follows: Total length, 349\r\n     (336-362); length of tail, 127 (120-133); length of hind foot,\r\n     36.3 (32-39). Tail averages 57 per cent as long as head and body.\r\n     Length of hind foot less than basal length. Corresponding\r\n     measurements of ten adults from the Rocky Mountains of central\r\n     Colorado are as follows: 347 (325-375); 123 (111-141); 40\r\n     (32-43).\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes,\r\n     in the Sierras of California are: Total length, 51; length of\r\n     tail, 23; length of hind foot, 9.8. Weight of 7 adult males from\r\n     California is 267 (226-345) grams. Two adult females from there\r\n     weigh 148 and 115 grams and 3 from White Pine County, Nevada, 134,\r\n     122 and 124, giving an average of 129 grams.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black, brown or white\r\n     (often all three colors in same specimen) and extending beyond\r\n     ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts and extending to\r\n     apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of foot-soles (in summer\r\n     pelage) about as shown in figure 19.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Upper parts, in summer, near (14 _n_ to _l_) Brussels\r\n     Brown or tones 1 to 3 of Raw Umber of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl.\r\n     301, darker on top of head from nose to line connecting posterior\r\n     margins of ears. Chin and upper lips white. Remainder of\r\n     underparts Buff-Yellow to Straw Yellow and sometimes\r\n     Ochraceous-Buff especially in young, and in some adults from\r\n     southern Colorado. In winter, all white, except tip of tail, or\r\n     upper parts near (_j_) Snuff Brown or lighter than Brussels Brown\r\n     with a smoked effect, and underparts white.

In seven males\r\n     from southern Colorado corresponding percentages are 55 (37-71).\r\n     Black tip of tail in series from Sierra Nevada averaging 50\r\n     (40-60) mm. long; thus longer than hind foot and averaging 33-1/3\r\n     per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 25 adults, from Sierra Nevada\r\n     of California): See measurements and plates 19-21; weight, 3.7\r\n     (2.9-4.9) grams; basilar length, 43.6 (40.6-46.1); zygomatic\r\n     breadth more than distance between condylar foramen and M1 (save\r\n     in four instances) and more than distance between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla (save in\r\n     two specimens); mastoid breadth more (80 per cent of specimens) or\r\n     less (20 per cent) than postpalatal length; postorbital breadth\r\n     less than length of upper premolars and more or less than width of\r\n     basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen lacerum\r\n     posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth more or less than\r\n     distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla; breadth of rostrum less than length of tympanic bulla;\r\n     least width of palate less than medial length of P4 (except in two\r\n     specimens); anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to\r\n     foramen ovale as width of 3 to 5 upper incisors; height of\r\n     tympanic bulla more than distance from its anterior margin to\r\n     foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower\r\n     molar and premolar tooth-row and longer or shorter than rostrum;\r\n     anterior margin of masseteric fossa not carried farther forward\r\n     than point directly below hypoconid of m1.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on ten adults from Sierra Nevada of California): See\r\n     measurements and plates 33-35; weight, 2.2 (1.8-2.4) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 38.2 (36.7-39.5); zygomatic breadth more (except\r\n     in one specimen) than distance between condylar foramen and M1 and\r\n     more (save in two specimens) than distance between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     postorbital breadth less than length of upper premolars and less\r\n     than (except in one specimen) width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     least width of palate more or less than either outside or inside\r\n     length of P4 but generally less than inside length; tympanic bulla\r\n     as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3 to 5-1/2 upper\r\n     incisors; height of tympanic bulla more or less (usually more)\r\n     than distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of\r\n     tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar and premolar\r\n     tooth-row and more or less than length of rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 41 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the average male.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. longicauda_, that of both sexes\r\naverages smaller in every measurement taken. Males of _nevadensis_, on\r\nthe average, relative to the basilar length, are narrower in the\r\ninterorbital region and across the zygomata but have the orbitonasal\r\nlength greater. Stated in another way, the rostrum of _longicauda_\r\nappears to be shorter and broader and the zygomata are more expanded.\r\nFemales of _nevadensis_, on the average, relative to the basilar length\r\nare narrower across the mastoid processes and zygomata and have the\r\nbraincase deeper at the anterior margin of the basioccipital. Also in\r\n_nevadensis_ the mastoid processes do not project so far laterally\r\nbeyond the braincase, the lambdoidal crest and postorbital processes\r\nare less well developed and except in the interparietal region, the\r\ntemporal ridges hardly meet and they form a sagittal furrow rather than\r\na low sagittal crest which characterizes adult females of _longicauda_.\r\nEach of these differences separating the females of _longicauda_ from\r\nthose of _nevadensis_ are of the same nature, although not necessarily\r\nof the same degree, as those which appear in _longicauda_ with\r\nincreasing age. The differences mentioned above are readily appreciable\r\nwhen series of specimens are compared. However, none of the differences\r\nis of great degree, and most parts of the skulls of the two subspecies\r\nare of similar relative proportions. Even so, there is but little\r\noverlap in actual size. Comparisons with the skulls of _M. f.\r\noribasus_, _alleni_, _neomexicana_, _arizonensis_, _inyoensis_,\r\n_pulchra_, _xanthogenys_, _munda_, _saturata_, _oregonensis_,\r\n_washingtoni_, _altifrontalis_, and _effera_ are made in the accounts\r\nof those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The populations to which the name _nevadensis_ at present\r\nis assigned have gone by the name _arizonensis_ since Mearns proposed\r\nthis name in 1891. Before that time Coues (1877:141) had included\r\nindividuals of this race under the name _Putorius longicauda_.\r\n\r\nAmong the populations here assigned to _M. f. nevadensis_, there is\r\nsome geographic variation but it is of lesser degree than in most other\r\nspecies of mammals which range over the same region. Comparison of 20\r\nadult males from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado with 25 adult males\r\nfrom a place as far distant as the Sierra Nevada of California shows\r\nthat the two populations closely resemble each other. The specimens\r\nfrom Colorado average a trifle wider across the zygomata, have a longer\r\nbody and therefore relatively shorter tail, and, except in southern\r\nColorado, a slightly longer hind foot. Comparison of ten adult females\r\nfrom each of the two areas reveals that those from Colorado have a\r\nmarkedly longer hind foot, and a tail somewhat shorter relative to the\r\nlength of the body. The mentioned differences are the only ones found\r\namong the great number of points investigated, except that as remarked\r\nby Merriam (1896:23) the Sierran animal has the yellow of the\r\nunderparts reaching farther up under the chin, the underside of the\r\ntail on the average is more suffused with yellowish and the white on\r\nthe upper lip is more extensive. As regards the last mentioned feature,\r\nmy check of 34 skins from Colorado reveals that the white extends all\r\nthe way around the upper lip in every specimen but one, whereas in 69\r\nspecimens from the Sierra Nevada the white extends all the way around\r\nthe upper lip in only 39. However, as further remarked by Merriam\r\n(_loc. cit._), not only this but the other color features are\r\ninconstant in addition to being slight. When the occurrence of the dark\r\nspots near the angles of the mouth are tabulated, it is found that in\r\n33 Colorado-taken specimens they are absent in 19, faintly indicated in\r\n13, and well developed in 1. In 62 California-taken specimens they are\r\nabsent in 37, faintly indicated in 20, and well developed in 5.\r\n\r\nIn northwestern Colorado, southern Wyoming, and possibly through the\r\nBear River Divide into southeastern Idaho, long-tailed weasels here\r\nreferred to _nevadensis_ approach _longicauda_ in large size and\r\noccasionally in other features, more closely than do specimens of\r\n_nevadensis_ from most other places in its range. This tendency is\r\nthought to be significant for much of the area in question lies in or\r\nbelow the Transition Life-zone, the same life zones in which farther to\r\nthe eastward true _longicauda_ occurs.\r\n\r\nOne specimen that illustrates this approach to _longicauda_ is an adult\r\nmale, no. 2334, collection of E. R. Warren, from 6160 feet, Lay, Routt\r\n[now Moffat] County, Colorado. In large size and, relative to the\r\nbasilar length, shorter rostrum and shorter tympanic bullae, it agrees\r\nwith _longicauda_ but the darker color and, relative to the basilar\r\nlength, narrowness of the rostrum, interorbital region, zygomatic\r\nexpanse and the shallowness through the region of the postorbital\r\nprocesses place it with _nevadensis_. Of two other specimens from\r\nSteamboat Springs, Routt County, a young male, no. 4010, in the\r\ncollection of E. R. Warren, has a hind foot (50 mm.) as long as in\r\n_longicauda_; and the other, no. 138195, U. S. Nat. Mus., an adult\r\nmale, agrees well enough in size and proportions with _nevadensis_ but\r\nhas the coloration typical of _longicauda_.\r\n\r\nFrom Wyoming, one subadult female, no. 177553, U. S. Nat. Mus., from\r\nGarrett, is intermediate in size and coloration but is nearer to\r\n_nevadensis_ in these particulars, as it is in all other points\r\nconsidered except size of the molar teeth which are as large as in\r\n_longicauda_ and larger than in any female _nevadensis_ from Colorado\r\nor California. Another female, an adult, no. 179304, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\nfrom Lonetree, Wyoming, agrees with _longicauda_ in size of skull.\r\nIndeed, ten of seventeen cranial measurements exceed the maximum for\r\nColorado-taken _nevadensis_. Where differences exist in relative\r\nproportions of the skull as expressed in percentages of the basilar\r\nlength, the specimen approaches _nevadensis_ in 5 instances and\r\n_longicauda_ in only 3. The color is intermediate but much nearer that\r\nof _nevadensis_ with which the animal agrees also in external\r\nmeasurements. Ten subadults (5 of each sex) from within 12 miles of\r\nLaramie (not Fort Laramie) show greater resemblance to _nevadensis_ but\r\ndefinitely approach _longicauda_. Average external measurements are:\r\n[M], 408, 155, 44; [F], 361, 134, 40. The two other specimens examined\r\nfrom this general locality, a young female, no. 2711, Mus. Vert. Zoöl.,\r\nfrom Fort Bridger, and a subadult female, no. 188377, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\nfrom Bridger Pass, show no departures from _nevadensis_ of similar age.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from scattered localities in the Transition Life-zone of\r\nnorthwestern Colorado and southern Wyoming are larger than _nevadensis_\r\nis elsewhere, and also in certain other features resemble _longicauda_\r\nof the plains to the eastward. Everything considered, the animals in\r\nquestion are much more like _nevadensis_ than _longicauda_. Study of\r\nmore specimens, especially from Wyoming, might provide grounds for\r\nrecognizing as a different subspecies the animals in this large area\r\ncomprising parts of Colorado and Wyoming from which so few specimens\r\nnow are available. Possibly the name _Putorius culbertsoni_ Coues would\r\napply. Decision on that point will require adequate material from the\r\ntype locality, Fort Laramie. See discussion of this name under _M. f.\r\nlongicauda_.\r\n\r\nIn southeastern Idaho males are larger than they are at most other\r\nplaces within the range of _nevadensis_. An average of 7 adults and\r\nsubadults from Pegram, Montpelier, Springfield, and the vicinity of\r\nPocatello, reveals, when compared with the average of _nevadensis_ from\r\nColorado and that of _longicauda_ from the Great Plains, that this\r\npopulation from southeastern Idaho is nearest to _longicauda_ in linear\r\nmeasurements of the orbitonasal length, mastoid breadth, length of\r\ntympanic bullae, and as expressed in percentage of the basilar length,\r\nlength of tooth-row, breadth of rostrum, and zygomatic breadth. In all\r\nother points of size, relative proportions and color, the animals\r\napproach nearer to, or actually agree with, _nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens commented upon clearly show intergradation between\r\n_nevadensis_ and _longicauda_. Similarly, the specimens from\r\nScottsbluff County, Nebraska, here referred to _M. f. alleni_, by their\r\nlarger size suggest intergradation of that subspecies with the larger\r\n_nevadensis-longicauda_ stock although the approach is more toward\r\n_longicauda_ than _nevadensis_. Between _oribasus_ and _nevadensis_,\r\nhowever, there is no lack of material showing intergradation. As set\r\nforth in the account of _oribasus_, specimens from Montana are truly\r\nintermediate structurally as well as geographically.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _washingtoni_ is shown by specimens from the\r\nnorthern part of the Cascade Range in Chelan and Okanogan counties,\r\nWashington. The adult male, U. S. Nat. Mus., no. 235183, from Bald\r\nMountain, is referable to _washingtoni_ on the basis of cranial\r\ncharacters but all the other adult and subadult specimens examined from\r\nChelan and Okanogan counties are nearer _nevadensis_ on the basis of\r\ncranial characters. Indeed, some show no approach to _washingtoni_ in\r\ncranial characters. As might be expected on geographic grounds, the\r\nspecimen from Easton, U. S. Nat. Mus., male subadult, no. 116870, shows\r\napproach to _washingtoni_. This is true of the coloration of the hind\r\nlimbs, small size of the tympanic bullae, and relatively greater length\r\nof the preorbital part of the skull. However, the greater width of the\r\nlight color of the underparts and relatively great breadth across the\r\nmastoid processes and zygomatic arches are points of agreement with\r\n_nevadensis_. Similarly, a series of 7 specimens from the Entait River,\r\n20 miles above its mouth, in tone of color is nearer to _washingtoni_,\r\nas is one of the two skulls of adult males in length of the preorbital\r\nregion. However, in greater breadth of the skull otherwise, and in the\r\nrelatively great width of the light color of the underparts, the\r\nanimals are nearer to _nevadensis_, to which they are here referred.\r\nSome of these characters mentioned above in which departure is shown\r\nfrom typical _nevadensis_ are characters that show approach to\r\n_altifrontalis_. This is especially true of the more intense coloration\r\nand restriction of the color of the underparts.\r\n\r\nComplete intergradation with _effera_ is shown by specimens from\r\nsouthern Oregon. The change from small _effera_ to the larger\r\n_nevadensis_ here is gradual; consequently in northeastern California\r\nand southern Oregon the size increases gradually to the northward.\r\nSpecimens showing complete intergradation with _oregonensis_ and\r\n_saturata_ are wanting. However, one specimen from Crescent Lake\r\nsuggests _oregonensis_ in having near (18) apricot yellow underparts\r\nsuch as occur frequently in _oregonensis_. Also some specimens from\r\nnorthern California approach _saturata_ in having the color of the\r\nunderparts reduced in the extent to which it reaches out on the under\r\nside of the tail. This fact and the consideration that the two races\r\nare less different from one another than are other kinds which\r\ndefinitely are known to intergrade leave no doubt but that material\r\nfrom the intervening localities would show complete intergradation.\r\n\r\nIntergradation between _nevadensis_ and _munda_ is indicated by\r\nspecimens from South Yolla Bolly Mountain, Trinity County, which are\r\ncommented on at greater length in the account of _M. f. munda_. _M. f.\r\ninyoensis_ is so closely related to _nevadensis_ as to leave no doubt\r\nthat specimens from suitable localities will show actual\r\nintergradation. That intergradation occurs directly with the bridled\r\nweasel of the interior valleys of California, _M. f. xanthogenys_, is\r\nshown by specimens from along the west-facing flank of the southern\r\npart of the Sierra Nevada. Probably intergradation occurs all along the\r\nSierra Nevada on the western slope but specimens are lacking to show\r\nthis. Weasels are known to occur in the foothill territory and the\r\nlesser attention given to this region by mammal collectors than to the\r\nhigher parts of the mountains may explain the lack of preserved\r\nspecimens. Individual specimens, here referred to _nevadensis_, but,\r\nshowing varying degrees of approach to _xanthogenys_ are as follows: A\r\nfemale from Hume; a male and a female from 8000 feet elevation, Monache\r\nMeadows; a male from 9800 feet elevation on the east fork of the Kaweah\r\nRiver; and 7 specimens, probably one family, from one-half mile south\r\nof Mineral King, 7850 feet. Of the specimens from 7850 feet, the adult\r\nmale has no light facial markings and the head is only slightly darker\r\nthan the back. The adult female has much restricted, light facial\r\nmarkings and the intervening areas are darker than in the male. The\r\nfive juveniles trapped in the same burrow as the female, each has more\r\nextensive light facial markings than the adult female although the area\r\nof this varies from only slightly more than in the female to as much as\r\nin typical specimens of _xanthogenys_. Also, the dark color of the head\r\nin these five specimens averages darker than in _nevadensis_ and more\r\nas in weasels to the southwestward especially _latirostra_. One of the\r\nfive juveniles is lighter colored over all of the upper parts than\r\n_nevadensis_ and is suggestive of _xanthogenys_ in this respect.\r\nFinally, the adult male has on the underparts small spots of ochraceous\r\norange suggestive of _latirostra_ and some individuals of _pulchra_.\r\nNo. 30655/42628, U. S. Nat. Mus., taken on Mount Whitney, also shows\r\nwhite facial markings and some other features of the valley-inhabiting\r\n_xanthogenys_. A suggestion of intergradation with _arizonensis_ is\r\nfurnished by specimens, referred to that race, from Springerville and\r\nthe Kaibab Plateau. No specimens happen to be available from the region\r\nin which intergradation would be expected between _nevadensis_ and\r\n_neomexicana_. Since _neomexicana_ and _arizonensis_ intergrade it is\r\nprobable that _nevadensis_ also will be found to intergrade with\r\n_neomexicana_. In summary, _nevadensis_ is judged to intergrade with\r\neach of the subspecies of _Mustela frenata_ whose range adjoins that of\r\n_nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nThis subspecies is remarkably free from injury to the frontal sinuses\r\nsuch as result from the presence of parasites. In 98 adults from\r\nOregon, California, Nevada, and Colorado, no malformation was noted.\r\nOnly 1 of the 26 specimens from Washington was malformed and it was an\r\nintergrade with _washingtoni_. The single adult from New Mexico was\r\ndiseased, as were 3 of the 6 from British Columbia, 1 of the 20 from\r\nIdaho, and 1 of the 7 from Utah.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 568, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by provinces and states and from north to south by counties in\r\n     each state.

Tail\r\n     averages 56 (52-59) per cent as long as head and body. Length of\r\n     hind foot more or less than (about same as) basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: No. 212423 from Vale, and no. 566 V. B. Scheffer, from 15\r\n     mi. E Ukiah, measure, respectively: Total length, 312, 306; length\r\n     of tail, 113, 114; length of hind foot, 35, 35. Tail averages 57\r\n     per cent as long as head and body.\r\n\r\n     Differences in external measurements between the one adult female\r\n     and the average of the males are: Total length, 51; length of\r\n     tail, 16; length of hind foot, 7.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black, brown or white\r\n     (often all three colors in same specimen) and extending beyond\r\n     ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts and extending to\r\n     apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of foot-soles (in summer\r\n     pelage) about as shown in stage 4 of figure 19.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Upper parts, in summer, near (14 _n_ to _l_) Brussels\r\n     Brown or tones 1 to 3 of Raw Umber of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl.\r\n     301, darker on top of head from nose to, or slightly behind, line\r\n     connecting posterior margins of ears. Chin and usually all of\r\n     upper lips white. Remainder of underparts Buff-Yellow to Straw\r\n     Yellow. In winter all white except tip of tail or upper parts near\r\n     (_j_) Snuff Brown or lighter than Brussels Brown with a smoked\r\n     effect, with underparts white. Tip of tail at all times black.\r\n     Color of underparts extends distally on posterior sides of\r\n     forelegs over toes onto antipalmar faces of toes and wrists, on\r\n     medial sides of hind legs to ankles over antiplantar faces of\r\n     toes, distomedial third of tarsus and usually over proximal fourth\r\n     to three-fourths of ventral side of tail. Least width of color of\r\n     underparts averaging, in 15 males, 53 (36-69) per cent of greatest\r\n     width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail averaging 47\r\n     (38-67) mm. long. Thus averaging longer than hind foot, and 36 per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 6 adults from northeastern\r\n     Oregon): See measurements and plates 19-21. As described in\r\n     _Mustela frenata nevadensis_ except that: Weight, 2.9 (2.5-3.4)\r\n     grams; basilar length, 40.5 (39.3-41.8).\r\n\r\n     Female (based on no. 212423, adult from Vale): In so far as parts\r\n     of the broken skull permit a person to judge, the skull is as\r\n     described in _M. f. nevadensis_ except that: Smaller; lighter;\r\n     postorbital breadth more than width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the skull of _M. f. nevadensis_ that of _effera_\r\nseems, on the average, to have the preorbital part relatively smaller.\r\nOtherwise, the skull is a miniature of the skull of _nevadensis_,\r\naveraging about eight per cent smaller in linear measurements and\r\nweighs twenty-two per cent less. Comparisons of the skull with those of\r\n_M. f. washingtoni_ and _M. f. oregonensis_ are made in accounts of\r\nthose subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This geographic race has long borne the name of _Mustela\r\narizonensis_ (Mearns). Small size differentiates _effera_ from\r\n_nevadensis_ and specimens have been allocated to one or the other\r\nsubspecies on the basis of size, or average size when several\r\nindividuals are available from one locality. Complete intergradation\r\nwith each adjoining subspecies is indicated by numerous specimens, more\r\nof which are assigned to these adjoining subspecies than to _effera_\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe minimum of size in _M. f. effera_ is found in the Blue Mountain\r\nregion of northeastern Oregon. Specimens from the area intervening\r\nbetween these mountains and the Cascades average larger but are nearer\r\nthe mean of typical _effera_ than they are to the means of\r\n_washingtoni_, _oregonensis_ or _nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nTwo males, nos. 204883, adult, and 204884, young, from Sisters, Oregon,\r\nnear the eastern base of the Cascades, show approach structurally to\r\n_M. f. washingtoni_ as it is represented at the nearby locality,\r\nPermilia Lake, at the west base of Mount Jefferson. Everything\r\nconsidered, however, the two specimens from Sisters are nearer to\r\n_effera_. A male from Condon, Oregon, shows approach to the Cascade\r\nrace in slightly increased size.\r\n\r\nNo perfect skulls of adult females are available from the part of\r\nnorthwestern Oregon in which _effera_ reaches its typical state of\r\ndevelopment as judged by the small size of the skull of the adult male.\r\nSkulls of adult females are available, however, from more nearly\r\nmarginal localities. These, though smaller than in _nevadensis_, show\r\nrelatively less difference in size when compared with _nevadensis_ than\r\ndo skulls of males. Even so the females at these marginal localities\r\nare smaller than those of _nevadensis_ of comparable age and adequate\r\nmaterial of adult female _effera_ from the region where the males\r\nattain their extreme of small size probably will show about the same\r\nrelative difference in size between _nevadensis_ and _effera_ as is\r\nknown to exist between the adult males of these two subspecies. The\r\nsmall size of a subadult female, no 74631, U. S. Nat. Mus., from\r\nAsotin, Washington, constitutes partial basis for this opinion.\r\n\r\nOf 14 adults examined none showed malformation of the frontal sinuses\r\ndue to infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 53, arranged within each\r\n     state by counties from north to south.

Black tip of tail in same series averaging 55 (45-60) mm.\r\n     long, thus longer than hind foot and averaging 37 per cent of\r\n     length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     The color of the underparts is not so narrow in the specimens from\r\n     Mount Rainier and it is believed that the slender bodies used in\r\n     stuffing the topotypes has accentuated in them the appearance of\r\n     narrowness of the light-colored underparts.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 22 adult topotypes): See\r\n     measurements and plates 19-21; weight, 3.5 (2.8-4.7) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 43.7 (40.0-47.7); zygomatic breadth more or less\r\n     than distance between condylar foramen and M1 or than between\r\n     anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     mastoid breadth more or less than postpalatal length; postorbital\r\n     breadth less than length of upper premolars and greater than width\r\n     of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen\r\n     lacerum posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth more or\r\n     less than distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin of\r\n     tympanic bullae; breadth of rostrum less (except in no. 82180)\r\n     than length of tympanic bulla; least width of palate more (except\r\n     in no. 81954) than length of P4; anterior margin of tympanic bulla\r\n     as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 2 to 5 upper\r\n     incisors; height of tympanic bulla more or less than distance from\r\n     its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla\r\n     more (except in two instances) than length of lower molar and\r\n     premolar tooth-row and shorter (except in two instances) than\r\n     rostrum; anterior margin of masseteric fossa below m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 11 ad. topotypes): See measurements and plates\r\n     34-36; weight, 2.0 (1.8-2.2) grams; basilar length, 37.6\r\n     (37.0-38.9); zygomatic breadth less (except in no. 70945) than\r\n     distance between condylar foramen and M1 or than between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     postorbital breadth less than length of upper premolars and more\r\n     than width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one\r\n     foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; least width of palate\r\n     less (except in one specimen) than greatest length of P4; tympanic\r\n     bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2\r\n     upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla more or less than\r\n     distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of\r\n     tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar and premolar\r\n     tooth-row and longer or shorter than rostrum.\r\n\r\nCompared with _M. f. nevadensis_, the skull of the male of\r\n_washingtoni_ averages more slender, as shown by the mastoid and\r\nzygomatic breadths and has the preorbital part longer, on the average,\r\nas shown by the greater ratio (to the basilar length) of the length of\r\nthe tooth-rows and orbitonasal length. Also, on the average, the\r\npostorbital constriction is longer than in _nevadensis_ and the\r\ntympanic bullae are smaller. In females, the skull is lighter, the\r\ntooth-rows are shorter, the tympanic bullae are smaller, and the\r\npreorbital part of the skull is shorter and narrower as shown by the\r\norbitonasal length and interorbital breadth. Except that the tympanic\r\nbullae are actually, although not relatively, smaller in males of\r\n_effera_, it differs from _washingtoni_ in the same way as does\r\n_nevadensis_ as regards relative proportions, but, of course, the\r\nactual difference in size is greater since _effera_ is smaller than\r\n_nevadensis_. Comparison of the skull with that of _oregonensis_ is\r\nmade in the account of that subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--_M. f. washingtoni_ was described and named in 1896 by\r\nMerriam as a distinct species. Subsequently, specimens which here are\r\nregarded as intergrades between _altifrontalis_ and _nevadensis_, were\r\nclassified as _washingtoni_.\r\n\r\nThe external measurements given for the specimens from Mount Adams are\r\nthose recorded on the labels in inches and fractions thereof. Instead\r\nof total length there sometimes is written \"tip to tip.\" In the series\r\nof 19 winter-taken topotypes the hairs project beyond the end of the\r\ncaudal vertebrae for an average distance of 28 (19-40) millimeters. If\r\nthe hairs on the end of the tail were included in the measurements, 28\r\nmillimeters should be subtracted from the averages. Probably the\r\nmeasurements should stand as given, since an adult male topotype, no.\r\n226758, U. S. Nat. Mus., taken subsequently by Walter P. Taylor\r\nmeasures 405; 152; 51.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata washingtoni_ is not a strongly marked geographic race.\r\nIn many features it is intermediate between _M. f. altifrontalis_ and\r\n_M. f. nevadensis_. This is especially true of coloration. In the\r\nseries from Mount Adams and that from Mount Rainier, some individuals\r\nhave the light color of the underparts extended down the hind legs over\r\nthe feet and over the proximal face of the ventral third of the tail as\r\nin _nevadensis_, whereas others from the same place have the light\r\ncolor of the underparts absent from the tail and extending no farther\r\ndown the hind limbs than the knees. The light color of the underparts\r\nin the series of topotypes is so restricted that the transverse extent\r\nat the narrowest place amounts to only 24 (10-37) per cent of the\r\ngreatest width of the color of the upper parts. This narrowness of the\r\ncolor of the underparts has been likened by Merriam (1896:18) to the\r\ncondition in _Mustela frenata noveboracensis_. So it is, but it is\r\nsimilar to the condition found also in the geographically adjoining _M.\r\nf. altifrontalis_.\r\n\r\nOf the 37 skulls of subadults and a few adults, 11 had the frontal\r\nsinuses malformed as a result of infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 56, arranged within each\r\n     state by localities from north to south.

Ashland and 2 from Jackson Lake) yield average and extreme\r\n     measurements as follows: Total length, 414 (402-437); length of\r\n     tail, 150 (136-160); length of hind foot, 46 (43-50). Tail\r\n     averages 57 (49-62) per cent as long as head and body. Length of\r\n     hind foot more or less than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: One young from the summit of the Trinity Mountains east of\r\n     Hoopa and one nontypical adult from 5500 feet elevation on South\r\n     Fork Mountain, Humboldt County, measure respectively as follows:\r\n     Total length, 330, 325; length of tail, 115, 123; length of hind\r\n     foot, 37, 37. Tail is 53 and 61 per cent as long as head and body.\r\n     Length of hind foot less than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Average differences in external measurements between the two\r\n     sexes, indicated by the unsatisfactory material available, are:\r\n     Total length, 86; length of tail, 31; length of hind foot, 9.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black or dark brown and\r\n     extending beyond ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts\r\n     and extending as far as apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of\r\n     foot-soles, in summer pelage, as shown in figure 19.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Upper parts, in summer, Brussels Brown to near (_n_)\r\n     Brussels Brown or lighter than tone 3 of Raw Umber of Oberthür and\r\n     Dauthenay, pl. 301, usually darkest on nose and forehead. Chin\r\n     white. Remainder of underparts Buff-Yellow to Warm Buff. Tip of\r\n     tail black. Winter pelage unknown. Color of underparts extends\r\n     distally on posterior sides of forelegs over toes onto antipalmar\r\n     faces of feet and sometimes wrists, on medial sides of hind legs\r\n     only to ankles, but toes sometimes with isolated white markings.\r\n     Least width of color of underparts in the type and 2 adults from\r\n     Jackson Lake averaging 35 (30-40) per cent of greatest width of\r\n     color of upper parts. Black tip of tail averaging 54 (53-55) mm.\r\n     long; thus longer than hind foot and averaging 37 per cent of\r\n     length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 4 adults: Type, Mt. Ashland, 1;\r\n     Jackson Lake, 2): See measurements and plates 19-21, 30. As\r\n     described in _Mustela frenata nevadensis_ except that: Weight, 3.8\r\n     (3.5-4.3) grams; basilar length, 44.4 (42.6-45.8); zygomatic\r\n     breadth more or less than distance between condylar foramen and M1\r\n     or than distance between anterior palatine foramen and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth more than postpalatal\r\n     length; least width of palate less than medial length of P4\r\n     (except in one specimen).\r\n\r\n     Female (based on one adult possibly not typical, from 5500 ft.,\r\n     South Fork Mt.): See measurements. As described in _Mustela\r\n     frenata nevadensis_ except that: Weight, 2.2 grams; basilar\r\n     length, 38.1; zygomatic breadth less than distance between\r\n     condylar foramen and M1 and less than distance between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     postorbital breadth more than width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the male of _saturata_, relative to the basilar length, is\r\nbroader across the mastoids and narrower across the rostrum and\r\ninterorbital region than that of _nevadensis_. Skull not known\r\ncertainly to differ from that of _oregonensis_. Compared with the skull\r\nof _munda_, that of the male of _saturata_ is smaller in every part\r\nmeasured except depth of tympanic bullae which averages 3.6\r\nmillimeters, rather than 3.5 as in _munda_. Also, the skull of\r\n_saturata_ has a less-marked postorbital constriction, is less heavily\r\nridged, less angular, does not have the impressions of the temporal\r\nmuscles carried so far forward on the frontal bones and is relatively\r\nmuch narrower across the zygomatic arches.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--In 1896, Merriam named _M. f. saturata_ as a distinct\r\nspecies on the basis of one specimen, taken by Clark P. Streator at\r\nSiskiyou, Oregon, and a second specimen taken the year previously by\r\nAllan C. Brooks at Chilliwack, British Columbia. On the basis of these\r\ntwo specimens, Merriam (1896:22) ascribed to the race a range \". . . on\r\nthe Cascade and Siskiyou mountains of Oregon and Washington, reaching a\r\nshort distance into British Columbia.\" Since that time, this name,\r\n_saturata_, has been employed for the dark-colored weasels, of the\r\ncoastal region of Oregon, Washington, and extreme southwestern British\r\nColumbia, which here are arranged under the name _M. f. altifrontalis_.\r\n_M. f. saturata_ proves to be restricted to the humid mountainous\r\nregion inland from the coast in northern California and in the Siskiyou\r\nMountains of southern Oregon. Its range is separated by that of _M. f.\r\noregonensis_ from the range of the darker-colored, deeper-skulled, _M.\r\nf. altifrontalis_ of the humid costal region proper.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 1933, Mr. Clark P. Streator, informed the writer that he\r\nremembered taking the type specimen of _Mustela frenata saturata_\r\n(Merriam) in the town of Siskiyou, Oregon. The exact place, he said,\r\nwas reached, at the time of his work there, by going one or two blocks\r\neast of the depot, then through a garden into the thick woods where\r\nthere were springs and numerous burrows of the rodent, _Aplodontia_.\r\nTwo other weasels labeled as taken at Siskiyou, on September 28 and\r\n29, 1893, by Mr. Streator, are much lighter colored than the type of\r\n_saturata_ and have the color of the underparts extended distally on\r\nthe hind legs to the tips of the toes and in other features of\r\ncoloration are more like _nevadensis_, the subspecies to which they are\r\nreferred, than _saturata_. Probably these did not come from exactly the\r\nsame place that the type specimen of _saturata_ did. Although Mr.\r\nStreator does not remember the taking of these particular specimens in\r\n1893, he does remember that on this visit to Siskiyou, he walked\r\nsouthward through the railroad tunnel and collected on the opposite\r\nside of the ridge from Siskiyou. Here on more southern exposures, the\r\ncountry was markedly different than in the thick forest at Siskiyou.\r\nProbably these two specimens taken in 1893, and referred to\r\n_nevadensis_, came from a little way south of Siskiyou and from a\r\ndifferent habitat and life-zone than the type specimen of _M. f.\r\nsaturata_.\r\n\r\nOf the 6 specimens examined, only one, the type, shows malformation of\r\nthe frontal sinuses such as result from infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 6, as follows:\r\n\r\n     =California.= _Siskiyou County_: Jackson Lake, 5900 ft., 2, Mus.\r\n     Vert.

Black tip of\r\n     tail in 8 adult males from Blaine, Oregon, averaging 59 (47-70)\r\n     mm. long; thus longer than hind foot and averaging 37 per cent of\r\n     length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 9 adults from Blaine, Tillamook\r\n     Co., Oregon): See measurements and plates 19-21; weight, 4.4\r\n     (3.3-5.3) grams; basilar length, 45.6 (42.4-47.7); zygomatic\r\n     breadth more or less (usually more) than distance between condylar\r\n     foramen and M1 or than between anterior palatine foramen and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth more or less\r\n     (usually more) than postpalatal length; postorbital breadth less\r\n     (except in some instances of malformations of frontal sinuses\r\n     which result from infestation by parasites) than length of upper\r\n     premolars and more or less than width of basioccipital measured\r\n     from medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its\r\n     opposite; interorbital breadth more or less than distance between\r\n     foramen opticum and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; breadth of\r\n     rostrum less than length of tympanic bulla; least width of palate\r\n     more or less than length of P4; anterior margin of tympanic bulla\r\n     as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3 to 4 (including\r\n     I3) upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla more than distance\r\n     from its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic\r\n     bulla more than length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and\r\n     more or less than orbitonasal length; anterior margin of\r\n     masseteric fossa directly below m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 4 adults): See measurements and plates 34-36;\r\n     weight, 2.2 (2.2-2.3) grams; basilar length, 38.1 (37.8-39.7);\r\n     zygomatic breadth more or less (less in three of four specimens)\r\n     than distance between condylar foramen and M1 or than between\r\n     anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     relation of postorbital breadth to other measurements in doubt\r\n     because of malformation of frontal sinuses by parasites; least\r\n     width of palate not less than greatest length of P4; tympanic\r\n     bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2\r\n     upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla more than distance from\r\n     its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla\r\n     more than length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and longer\r\n     or shorter than rostrum.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of _M. f. washingtoni_ that of each sex of\r\n_altifrontalis_ averages slightly larger in every measurement taken,\r\nexcept measurements of teeth which are approximately the same, and is\r\nrelatively deeper through the frontal region and through the braincase\r\nas measured at the anterior margin of the basioccipital. Skulls of\r\nfemales of _altifrontalis_ have a relatively broader interorbital\r\nregion. Skulls of males of _altifrontalis_ further differ in having\r\nrelatively, as well as actually, longer tympanic bullae, relatively\r\nlesser orbitonasal length and a greater relative breadth across the\r\nmastoids and across zygomata. Compared with _M. f. nevadensis_, the\r\nskull of the male of _altifrontalis_ averages slightly larger and\r\nheavier although the skulls of females are of approximately the same\r\nsize and weight. Relative to the basilar length, the skulls of both\r\nsexes are deeper through the braincase and narrower across the\r\nmastoids; the rostrum is broader, especially in males; the tooth-rows\r\nare shorter and the interorbital breadth less, especially in females.\r\nComparison with the skull of _oregonensis_ is made in the account of\r\nthat subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Until the present study was begun, animals of this race\r\nhave gone under the name _Mustela saturata_ (Merriam). The United\r\nStates National Museum has a juvenile taken, in 1858, by Wayne at\r\nAstoria, O. T.; the Samuel N. Rhoads collection contained one specimen\r\ntaken in 1891, at Tacoma, Washington; one in the Bangs' collection was\r\ntaken at Chilliwack, British Columbia, in 1895, and the Field Museum\r\nhas one taken on the Olympic Peninsula in 1898. The best material is\r\nthat collected by Alex Walker, at Tillamook, Oregon.\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _nevadensis_ is indicated by several specimens. The\r\ncoloration of the one adult female, no. 90, Chas. R. Conner Mus., from\r\nSwamp Creek, Washington, has the color of the underparts extended down\r\nthe hind legs over the feet, and over the proximal third of the ventral\r\nface of the tail as in _nevadensis_ although the other two specimens\r\nfrom the same place have the color pattern of _altifrontalis_. Of the\r\nfour specimens from British Columbia referred to this subspecies, only\r\nthe specimen from Chilliwack is typical as regards color pattern. The\r\none from Cultus Lake has the color pattern of _nevadensis_ and might be\r\nreferred to that race almost as well as to _altifrontalis_. The two\r\nspecimens from Lihumption Park are intermediate between the two races\r\nin tone of color. Neither has the color of the underparts extended onto\r\nthe tail or continuously over the hind feet as in _nevadensis_ but each\r\ndoes have the color of the underparts less restricted and of lighter\r\nhue than in _altifrontalis_. Only one of the specimens, no. 7848 Canad.\r\nNat. Mus., from Lihumption Park is adult and it has a skull which\r\nagrees with that of _altifrontalis_ rather than _nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nAfter writing the above, a good representation of the weasel population\r\nalong the eastern side of Puget Sound was made available by friends in\r\nthat area. Study of the weasels from there shows that their color is\r\nintermediate between that of _altifrontalis_ and _nevadensis_. On the\r\nwhole, they (specimens from Bellingham, for example) resemble one\r\nsubspecies about as much as the other. In cranial characters some\r\nspecimens, in certain features, approach _nevadensis_ but most\r\nspecimens agree with _altifrontalis_ and all are more nearly like\r\n_altifrontalis_ to which race all are referred.\r\n\r\nThe color of these animals is to me indistinguishable from that of\r\n_washingtoni_. The color of _washingtoni_ is merely intermediate\r\nbetween that of _nevadensis_ and _altifrontalis_. Nevertheless, the\r\nrace _washingtoni_ has cranial characters (long narrow skull) which set\r\nit off from both _altifrontalis_ and _nevadensis_. This shape of skull\r\nis not found in the specimens from along the eastern side of Puget\r\nSound; these animals have skulls like that of _altifrontalis_ and when\r\ndepartures from this occur they are in the direction of _nevadensis_\r\nand not _washingtoni_.\r\n\r\nThe above, then, explains why specimens which are colored like those\r\nof _washingtoni_ are not referred to that race but instead to the race\r\n_altifrontalis_.\r\n\r\nOf 23 adult skulls examined, 19 have the frontal sinuses malformed as\r\nthe result of infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 80, arranged within states by\r\n     counties from north to south.

Coll.; Grants Pass, Rogue River Valley,\r\n     Josephine County, Oregon; December 19, 1891; obtained by C. P.\r\n     Streator; original no. 1404.\r\n\r\n     The skull (plates 19-21, 30) is complete and unbroken. P3 on the\r\n     left side is missing. Otherwise the teeth all are present although\r\n     worn probably as a result of gnawing at the trap which captured\r\n     the specimen. The skin, in brown, winter pelage, is fairly well\r\n     made.\r\n\r\n     Although the label on the skin and the label in the skull vial\r\n     each give the sex of the specimen as female, and although Merriam\r\n     (1896:25) regarded the specimen as a female, the present writer\r\n     regards the specimen as a male.\r\n\r\n     It is as large as other undoubted males and larger than any known\r\n     female of this subspecies. The labels with the skull and skin give\r\n     the locality as \"Rogue River Valley, Oregon.\" The listing here of\r\n     the more restricted locality, Grants Pass, is made on the basis of\r\n     Merriam's (1896:25) original description of the subspecies.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Transition and Canadian life-zones along coast of\r\n     northern California and southern Oregon from Humboldt County,\r\n     California, north through Curry County, Oregon, thence inland,\r\n     west of the Cascades, north to the Columbia River. See figures 29\r\n     and 30 on pages 221 and 314.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f.\r\n     altifrontalis_ in presence of frontonasal white patch, lighter\r\n     color above (tone 2 to 3 of Raw Umber, pl. 301, rather than tone 4\r\n     of Brownish Drab, pl. 302, Oberthür and Dauthenay), wider extent\r\n     of light color of underparts which is extended distally beyond\r\n     knee, and in females, longer tooth-row which amounts to more than\r\n     38 per cent of basilar length; from _M. f. munda_ in shorter hind\r\n     foot of males which is less than 50, and in both sexes, smaller,\r\n     less rugose skull (see measurements and plates); from _M. f.\r\n     saturata_ in presence of frontonasal white patch, in having color\r\n     of underparts extended uninterruptedly over ankle onto foot; from\r\n     _M. f. nevadensis_ in presence of frontonasal white patch, lack of\r\n     light color of underparts on ventral face of tail, and longer\r\n     skull, which relative to its length in males, is shallower through\r\n     braincase; from _M. f. effera_ in presence of frontonasal white\r\n     patch, lack of light color of underparts on ventral face of tail,\r\n     and larger skull with basilar length averaging more than 41.7 in\r\n     males; from _M. f. washingtoni_ in presence of frontonasal white\r\n     patch, shorter skull in males, which in percentage of basilar\r\n     length has, on the average, orbitonasal length amounting to less\r\n     than 35, mastoid breadth more than 55, and zygomatic breadth more\r\n     than 63; and in females larger skull with least width of palate\r\n     more than length of P4, upper tooth-rows more than 38-1/2 per cent\r\n     of basilar length, bullae larger and averaging more than 13.4\r\n     long.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Five males (3 adults and 2\r\n     subadults from Eureka, Ferndale, and Carlotta, California) yield\r\n     average and extreme measurements as follows: Total length, 392\r\n     (347-430); length of tail, 138 (110-160); length of hind foot, 46\r\n     (43-50). Tail averages 54 (46-61) per cent as long as head and\r\n     body. Length of hind foot more or less than basal length. The type\r\n     specimen, and an adult from Goldbeach measure, respectively, as\r\n     follows: Total length, 412, 386; length of tail, 155, 137; length\r\n     of hind foot, 44, 46.\r\n\r\n     Female: Three adults (2 from Fortuna and 1 from Carlotta,\r\n     California) yield average and extreme measurements as follows:\r\n     Total length, 367 (360-374); length of tail, 130 (123-134); length\r\n     of hind foot, 40 (39-40). Tail averages 55 (52-57) per cent as\r\n     long as head and body. Length of hind foot less than basal length.\r\n     A subadult from Goldbeach, an adult from 13 mi. SW Grants Pass,\r\n     and an adult from Medford, measure, respectively, as follows:\r\n     Total length, 316, 344, 294; length of tail, 114, 120, 122; length\r\n     of hind foot, 36, 40, 38.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes\r\n     in the vicinity of Carlotta, are: Total length, 25; length of\r\n     tail, 8; length of hind foot, 6. Corresponding differences, at\r\n     Goldbeach, are: 70, 23, 10. Probably the females at Fortuna\r\n     reflect the large size of _munda_ more than do the males at\r\n     Carlotta and the differences between the measurements of the two\r\n     sexes probably, therefore, are actually more than are indicated by\r\n     the figures above.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black, brown or white\r\n     (often all three colors in same specimen) and extending beyond\r\n     ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts and extending to\r\n     apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of foot-soles, in summer\r\n     pelage, as shown in figure 20.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Upper parts, in summer, near (16 _l_) Brussels Brown or\r\n     tone 2 of Raw Umber of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 301, to\r\n     slightly darker than tone 3 of same plate. Darker on nose and top\r\n     of head, usually with frontonasal white patch but lacking white\r\n     bar in front of each ear, except in the type and 2 specimens from\r\n     Salem. Chin, lower lips, angle of mouth, and usually posterior\r\n     seventh of upper lip white. Remainder of underparts Pale\r\n     Orange-Yellow. In winter usually lighter above with underparts\r\n     Warm Buff to Straw Yellow. Tip of tail at all times black. Color\r\n     of underparts extends distally on posterior sides of forelegs over\r\n     toes onto antipalmar faces of feet and wrists, on medial side of\r\n     hind leg, typically over ankle in extremely narrow line which\r\n     widens out over distal phalanges of antiplantar faces of toes but\r\n     sometimes interrupted at ankle. Least width of color of underparts\r\n     averaging, in twenty available specimens, 39 (27-54) per cent of\r\n     greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail in five\r\n     adults averaging 50 (43-60) mm. long; thus averaging longer than\r\n     hind foot and 33 per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 4 adults and subadults from\r\n     Eureka, Requa, Goldbeach, and Grant Pass): See measurements and\r\n     plates 19-21, 30. As described in _Mustela frenata nevadensis_\r\n     except that: Weight, 3.5 (3.5-4.1) grams; basilar length, 42.9\r\n     (41.8-44.0); least width of palate more or less than medial length\r\n     of P4.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 2 adults, one from Carlotta and one from 13 mi.\r\n     SW Grants Pass): See measurements and plates 34-36. As described\r\n     in _Mustela frenata nevadensis_ except that: Weight, 2.4 (2.2-2.6)\r\n     grams; basilar length, 37.7 and 39.5; zygomatic breadth less than\r\n     distance between condylar foramen and M1 and less than distance\r\n     between anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla. See under \"_Remarks_\" for additional data on variation in\r\n     size of skulls of females.\r\n\r\n     The skulls of the female averages 31 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the average male.\r\n\r\nBecause there is much geographic variation between specimens here\r\nreferred to _oregonensis_, the person who is guided by the present\r\naccount should keep in mind that results, here reported, of comparisons\r\nof the skull with those of other races, were obtained by employing\r\nspecimens of _oregonensis_ from Carlotta and Eureka, California. These\r\nspecimens from California are judged to have more of the characters of\r\nthe subspecies _munda_ than do specimens of _oregonensis_ from more\r\nnorthern localities.\r\n\r\nCompared with that of _M. f. washingtoni_ the skull of the male is\r\nshorter, especially in the preorbital region and is relatively broader\r\nacross the mastoidal processes and zygomatic arches. The skull of the\r\nfemale is longer in the preorbital region, has a less cylindrical\r\nbraincase and differs less from the male skull than is the case in _M.\r\nf. washingtoni_. Compared with _M. f. effera_, the skull of the male is\r\nsmaller in every part measured and relative to the basilar length is\r\nbroader across the mastoids and has relatively shorter tympanic bullae.\r\nFrom _M. f. nevadensis_ the skull of the male differs in the same way\r\nexcept that size is about the same. The skull of the female\r\n_oregonensis_ is more heavily ridged and is relatively broader across\r\nthe mastoids than that of _effera_. From _M. f. saturata_,\r\n_oregonensis_ is not surely known to differ in cranial characters. From\r\n_M. f. munda_, _oregonensis_ differs in having the skull of both sexes\r\nsmaller, and on the average, in all parts measured, has a less marked\r\npostorbital constriction, relatively narrower interorbital region and\r\nrelatively more expanded zygomata. From _M. f. altifrontalis_, males of\r\n_oregonensis_ differ on the average, in having larger teeth, and\r\nrelative to the basilar length, a greater mastoid breadth and a\r\nshallower braincase as measured at the anterior margin of the\r\nbasioccipital. Females of _oregonensis_ differ in larger average size\r\nof skull, except for breadth of rostrum and interorbital breadth which,\r\ntherefore, are relatively less in _oregonensis_, as also is the\r\nrelative depth of the skull measured at the posterior borders of the\r\nupper molars and at the anterior margin of the basioccipital. However,\r\nskulls of females of _oregonensis_ have relatively longer tooth-rows\r\nand are relatively broader across the zygomata and mastoidal processes.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--In 1896, Merriam named _oregonensis_ as a subspecies of the\r\nCalifornia bridled weasel on the basis of a single specimen taken by\r\nClark P. Streator. Three additional specimens were acquired in later\r\nyears, by workers of Dr. Merriam's bureau, from near the type locality\r\nand specimens from farther north in Oregon have been accumulated at the\r\nUniversity of Oregon. The most satisfactory material is that saved from\r\nHumboldt County by the late H. E. Wilder, which, when brought together,\r\nis adequate to give some idea of the range of variation that can be\r\nexpected in a given population.\r\n\r\nOf two specimens from Goldbeach, one shows approach to _altifrontalis_\r\nin that the color of the underparts stops at the ankle, and in one, the\r\nangle of the mouth is dark colored. Specimens from Eugene and vicinity\r\nlack the white facial markings, and in this feature approach the\r\nadjoining _washingtoni-effera-nevadensis_ stock. A specimen from 6\r\nmiles south of Medford shows approach to _saturata_ in the\r\ninterruption, on the ankle and lower tibial region, of the color of the\r\nunderparts. One adult female, no. 1413, Univ. Oregon, from the Rogue\r\nRiver Valley, 13 miles southwest of Grants Pass, stands out\r\nprominently, among the other specimens from extreme southern Oregon and\r\nnorthwestern California, by reason of the near (18) Apricot Yellow\r\ncolor of the underparts, but this same color occurs in specimens from\r\nthe more northerly localities of Buchanan, Eugene, Vida Fish Hatchery,\r\nand McKenzie Bridge, as well as in no. 2178, Univ. Oregon, from Cresent\r\nLake. The last mentioned specimen is here referred to _nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nTwo females referred to _oregonensis_ from southern Oregon differ so\r\ngreatly in size of skull that they challenge one's imagination in any\r\nattempt to provide an explanation for so wide a range of variation in\r\none subspecies. One of these, no. 244520, U. S. Nat. Mus., is an adult\r\nfemale from Medford. The other, no. 224034, U. S. Nat. Mus., is a\r\nsubadult female (though labeled male) from 43 miles northeast of Grants\r\nPass. The skull of the adult from Medford has a basilar length of 41.5,\r\nupper tooth-rows, 16.1 in length, and a weight of 2.75 grams, whereas\r\ncorresponding figures for the subadult are only 33.8, 12.9, and 1.4.\r\nTwo other adult females are intermediate in size: No. 1413, Univ.\r\nOregon, from 13 miles southwest of Grants Pass, Oregon, approaches the\r\nspecimen from Medford in size, and the second specimen, no. 34325, Mus.\r\nVert. Zoöl., from Carlotta, California, is smaller.\r\n\r\nNot only is there a difference in length between the skulls of the two\r\nextremes of the females but this difference extends to all other\r\ndimensions of their skulls, and is most pronounced in the preorbital\r\nregion. The differences in breadth of the braincase and other parts of\r\nthe skull are relatively less than the differences in length.\r\nDifferences of the same nature, although of lesser degree than found in\r\nthe females, are to be seen in two males. The skull of an adult no.\r\n51590, Mus. Vert. Zoöl., from 6 miles south of Medford, has a basilar\r\nlength of 46.4, upper tooth-rows, 17.6 mm. long, and a weight of 4.0\r\ngrams, whereas corresponding figures for the subadult type specimen\r\nfrom Grants Pass, are only 43.0, 16.2, and 3.3.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of variation in size of skull of both sexes, together\r\nwith the considerable variation in color pattern of the specimens here\r\nreferred to _oregonensis_ raises the suspicion that we are using the\r\nname in a composite sense; nevertheless, to recognize more than one\r\nsubspecies with the material now available would be unwise.\r\n\r\nA subadult female, of abnormal color, no. 47149, Mus. Vert. Zoöl.,\r\ntaken by Mr. H. E. Wilder at Carlotta, California, on December 20,\r\n1930, in a region where weasels do not turn white in winter, is white,\r\nexcept for the black tip of the tail, but has a suffusion of orange.\r\nThis specimen, discussed at greater length on page 43, is instructive\r\nin that it suggests that there are separate determiners for the brown\r\nand red elements of the pelage. It is interesting also as suggesting\r\nhow natural selection may tend to eliminate from the population a\r\nconspicuous color-variation of this kind. At any rate, Mr. Wilder (Ms.)\r\nstates: \"This specimen was picked up in a field, where it evidently had\r\nbeen dropped by a hawk or an owl.\" The braincase of the skull is\r\ncrushed in three places as though by a raptor's beak. None of the\r\nseveral other weasels, all normally colored, saved by Mr. Wilder from\r\nthis general locality gives evidence of having fallen a victim to a\r\nraptor.\r\n\r\nOnly 2 skulls of the 12 adults and subadults examined show malformation\r\nof the frontal sinuses such as results from the presence of parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 29, arranged within states\r\n     from north to south by counties.

Bangs, but now in collection of Mus.\r\n     Comp. Zoöl.; Point Reyes, Marin County, California; June 19,\r\n     1896; obtained by C. A. Allen; original no. 931. (See comments\r\n     under \"Remarks,\" below, on places in California to which the name\r\n     Point Reyes has been applied.)\r\n\r\n     The skull (pls. 19-21, 30) is complete and unbroken. I1 on each\r\n     side and right I2 are broken away; p2 and p3 on each side have\r\n     been aborted and the only alveoli remaining are two for the right\r\n     p3. Otherwise all teeth are present and entire. The skin is fairly\r\n     well made and in good condition.\r\n\r\n     Cranially, the type is a \"runt\"; its small size and the\r\n     circumstance that the tympanic bulla is longer than the lower\r\n     molar and premolar tooth-row and longer than the rostrum are\r\n     features which differentiate the type from any other specimen seen\r\n     of this race.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Sea level to at least 6,000 feet (South Yolla Bolly\r\n     Mountain, Trinity County, California); Upper Sonoran and\r\n     Transition life-zones of the coast and Coast Range of northwestern\r\n     California from the Golden Gate northward into southern Humboldt\r\n     and Trinity counties. See figures 29 and 30 on pages 221 and 314.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f.\r\n     oregonensis_ in longer hind foot of males which is more than 50\r\n     mm., and in both sexes, larger, more prominently ridged skull (see\r\n     measurements and plates); from _M. f. saturata_ by presence of\r\n     nasofrontal white spot, larger and relatively shallower skull of\r\n     males and larger skull of female; from _M. f. nevadensis_ by\r\n     presence of well-developed, white, facial markings; absence of\r\n     color of underparts on ventral face of proximal third of tail; and\r\n     hind foot of males more than 50; from _M. f. xanthogenys_ by near\r\n     (_l_) Sudan Brown to near (_l_) Antique Brown rather than\r\n     Buckthorn Brown colors of upper parts and greater size, and in\r\n     adult male basilar length more than 45 and hind foot more than 47;\r\n     from _M. f. nigriauris_ by having inside of ears same color as\r\n     back rather than much darker than back.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Three adults and two young from\r\n     Point Arena and Gualala, Mendocino County, yield average and\r\n     extreme measurements as follows: Total length, 447 (434-470);\r\n     length of tail, 167 (150-185); length of hind foot, 53 (50-60).\r\n     Corresponding measurements of three adults from 5 and 6 miles west\r\n     of Inverness, Marin County, are: 430 (420-440), 154 (141-160), 48\r\n     (48-49). Corresponding measurements of four individuals (3 adults\r\n     and 1 young of large size) from South Yolla Bolly Mountain,\r\n     Trinity County, are: 383 (374-400), 134 (130-138); 44 (43-44). The\r\n     tail averages 60 per cent as long as the head and body in the\r\n     series from Point Arena, 56 per cent in the series from Point\r\n     Reyes, and 53 per cent in the series from South Yolla Bolly\r\n     Mountain. In every specimen except two, length of hind foot less\r\n     than basal length. The two exceptions are no. 19720, M.V.Z., male\r\n     adult from Point Arena in which the hind foot is recorded as 60\r\n     (probably an error in measurement), and no. 19721, M.V.Z., from\r\n     the same place, in which the skull has not yet attained its full\r\n     growth.\r\n\r\n     Female: One adult from Point Arena measures as follows: Total\r\n     length, 383; length of tail, 134; length of hind foot, 43.\r\n     Corresponding measurements of an adult from seven miles north of\r\n     Laytonville, Mendocino County, are: 336, 121, 33 (= 36 on dried\r\n     skin). Corresponding measurements of an adult from South Yolla\r\n     Bolly Mountain, Trinity County, are, 326, 113, 37. In these three\r\n     specimens, the tail is, in the order given, 54, 56, and 53 per\r\n     cent as long as the head and body. Length of hind foot more than\r\n     basal length.\r\n\r\n     Differences in external measurements of the two sexes as indicated\r\n     by the five males and one female from Point Arena, are: Total\r\n     length, 64; length of tail, 33; length of hind foot, 10. Weights\r\n     of 2 adult males are 265 and 221 grams and of one adult female 155\r\n     grams.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata nigriauris_.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Spot between eyes, narrow band or spot confluent with\r\n     color of underparts on each side of head anterior to each ear,\r\n     chin, lower lips, and rarely posterior third or less of each upper\r\n     lip white; dark spot posterior to each angle of mouth uniformly\r\n     present and of large size; tip of tail black; remainder of upper\r\n     parts near (14 _l_) Sudan Brown and tone 4 of Raw Umber of\r\n     Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 301; occasionally, slightly darker\r\n     brown on forehead, nose, and about eyes. Underparts near (_a_ to\r\n     _c_) Ochraceous-Buff and sometimes Orange-Buff. Color of\r\n     underparts extends distally on posterior sides of forelegs over\r\n     toes onto antipalmar faces of feet and wrists, on medial sides of\r\n     hind limbs over antiplantar faces of toes. Least width of color of\r\n     underparts averaging, in a series of 5 males from Mendocino\r\n     County, 57 (46-67) per cent of greatest width of color of upper\r\n     parts; 38 (35-40) in 3 males from Point Reyes, Marin County. Black\r\n     tip of tail in Mendocino County series averaging 53 (46-60) mm.,\r\n     which is same length as hind foot and 32 per cent of length of\r\n     tail. In Point Reyes males, black tip of tail averages 44 (34-52)\r\n     mm., which is less than length of hind foot and 45 per cent as\r\n     long as tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     Several specimens of the smaller, inland variant (see under\r\n     \"_Remarks_\") are near (_l_) Antique Brown rather than near (14\r\n     _l_) Sudan Brown above and hence do not differ in this respect\r\n     from _nigriauris_.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 3 adults from Mendocino\r\n     County): See measurements and plates 19-23, 30. As described in\r\n     _Mustela frenata nigriauris_ except that: Weight, 6.0 (5.4-6.3)\r\n     grams; basilar length, 47.6 (46.5-48.2); length of tympanic bulla\r\n     more than length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on no. 19723, M.V.Z., from Point Arena): See\r\n     measurements and plates 34-36, 40. As described in _M. f.\r\n     nigriauris_ except that: Weight, 3.0 grams; basilar length, 42.3.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female is 50 per cent lighter than that of the\r\n     average male.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of the male of _nevadensis_ that of _munda_\r\naverages larger in every part measured and specimens from Point Arena\r\nare nearly as heavy again, have relatively more expanded zygomata and\r\nmastoid processes but are relatively narrower anteriorly as shown by\r\nthe breadth of the rostrum, interorbital breadth and postorbital\r\nbreadth. Also the braincase is less inflated anteriorly, the tympanic\r\nbullae are lower and the skull is more angular. Females show the same\r\ndifferences although in different degree. Compared with the skull of\r\nthe male of _M. f. nigriauris_, that of _munda_ from Point Arena\r\naverages larger in every part measured except for the length of the\r\nupper tooth-rows. Relative to the basilar length, the skull of _munda_\r\naverages broader across the mastoids and across the zygomata, is deeper\r\nthrough the braincase at the anterior end of the basioccipital, and\r\nhas a greater development of the lambdoidal crest.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The skin and part skull, no. 536/1849, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\ntaken by Lieutenant W. P. Trowbridge at San Pablo Bay, is the first\r\nspecimen known to have been saved of this subspecies. Since 1899 when\r\nO. Bangs diagnosed _munda_ as of small size, the weasel of the humid\r\ncostal belt north of San Francisco Bay has been regarded as smaller\r\nthan bridled weasels from farther south in the State. Actually,\r\nhowever, the weasel of the humid costal belt shares with _M. f.\r\npulchra_ the distinction of being one of the two largest weasels in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n_M. f. munda_ may be a composite subspecies, for the variation in\r\nfacial markings, in coloration otherwise, in external measurements and\r\nin size and shape of skull is great. At one time in the course of the\r\npresent study, manuscript accounts of two subspecies were prepared for\r\nthe animals now all called _munda_ and there is still much\r\njustification for recognizing two subspecies, one, along the coast\r\nproper, the larger, darker-colored animal with reduced white facial\r\nmarkings and large, wide, heavily ridged skull from Point Arena, and 6\r\nmiles south of Laytonville, Mendocino County, along with the specimens\r\nfrom 5 and 6 miles west of Inverness, Marin County, and the other, an\r\ninland race, which is a smaller, lighter-colored animal with more\r\nextensive white facial markings and a smaller, narrower, skull, known\r\nby specimens from Point Reyes [station?], Nicasio, 15 mi. north of San\r\nRafael, Freestone, Vallejo, and Mount Sanhedrin. The differences\r\nbetween these two lots of specimens are of great degree. However, a\r\nfemale from Fort Bragg proves to be no larger than three females\r\nlabeled as from Point Reyes. Also, a male from 2 miles south and one\r\nmile east of Stewarts Point on the coast has a skull no larger than the\r\nanimal from Vallejo, whereas the skin alone of an adult female from 3\r\nmiles south of Stewarts Point is large and agrees with the specimens\r\nfrom Point Arena. Consequently, no logical ranges can be worked out for\r\nthe two variants with the material now available.\r\n\r\nFinally, the type specimen of _munda_ is a \"runt,\" smaller than any\r\nother male seen. This specimen, purchased by E. A. and O. Bangs from C.\r\nA. Allen, who collected and sold specimens widely, was labeled as from\r\nPoint Reyes. So far as this place-name is concerned, it might refer to:\r\n(1) The point of land by that name which projects out into the Pacific\r\nOcean, (2) an abandoned ranch house bearing that name at the head of\r\nDrakes Bay, 6 miles north and 3-3/4 miles east of the actual point, or\r\n(3) the railway station by the same name at the head of Tomales Bay,\r\n12 miles east and 4-3/4 miles north of the actual point. Allen,\r\nhimself, lived near San Geronimo (then Nicasio) about nine miles\r\nsoutheast of the Point Reyes railway station. All these places are in\r\nMarin County, but differ markedly as regards climate and flora. The\r\nfirst two are treeless, windswept and have much fog, whereas Point\r\nReyes Station is more often sunny, and is situated in a shallow valley,\r\ninland, where the open grass-covered west-facing slopes meet the\r\neast-facing wooded ones. From which one of these three places the type\r\nspecimen came, I do not know. The same may be said of the three female\r\nspecimens labeled Point Reyes; two of these are in the United States\r\nNational Museum and one in the Field Museum.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy from 5 and 6 miles\r\nwest of Inverness and those from near the same place in the collection\r\nof John Cushing come from within a couple of miles or less of the Point\r\nReyes represented by the abandoned ranch house. These specimens, as\r\nremarked above, agree with those from Point Arena in large size,\r\nreduced facial markings and wide skull. These are points of difference\r\nfrom the smaller variant suspected of being a recognizable subspecies.\r\nIt is the smaller variant which the type specimen approaches in size,\r\nand with which it agrees in relatively well-developed white facial\r\nmarkings. This suggests that the type specimen came from Point Reyes\r\nStation rather than from either of the two other places bearing the\r\nname \"Point Reyes,\" from one of which, as just stated, the variant of\r\nlarge size is known. The three females labeled \"Point Reyes\" also have\r\nwell-developed white facial markings and are of lesser size than the\r\nfemale of similar age from Point Arena, Mendocino County. The\r\npresumption is that these three females also came from Point Reyes\r\nStation.\r\n\r\nThe smaller, inland variant seems to agree in size, cranial characters,\r\nand coloration with _M. f. nigriauris_ to the southward of San\r\nFrancisco Bay, but lacks the black on the head which characterizes\r\n_nigriauris_. The larger variant, on which the description here used\r\nfor _munda_ is based, comprises animals which differ from _nigriauris_\r\nin larger size, darker color, reduced white facial markings, and\r\nlarger, relatively wider skull. Both of the variants mentioned above\r\nare sharply distinct from _nigriauris_ on the basis of coloration of\r\nthe inside of the ear which is blackish in nigriauris like the dark\r\nfacial markings, and in _munda_ is colored like the back. _M. f. munda_\r\nlacks the dark facial markings; an occasional specimen has at most, a\r\ntrace of the markings but this does not extend back so far as the ears.\r\nThis difference, blackish versus non-blackish face, persists eastward\r\nof San Francisco Bay to at least as far as the Carquinez Straits, where\r\na specimen of _munda_ is available from 4 miles north of Vallejo and\r\none of _nigriauris_ from Glen Frazer Station on the south shore\r\nopposite Vallejo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Map showing the geographic distribution of\r\nsubspecies of _Mustela frenata_ in California]\r\n\r\nIntergradation with _M. f. nevadensis_ and possibly with _M. f.\r\nsaturata_ is indicated by specimens from South Yolla Bolly Mountain,\r\nTrinity County. In them the external measurements and measurements of\r\nthe skull are intermediate. Also the white frontal spot is much reduced\r\nin size. The white bars in front of the ears are absent in three\r\nspecimens, and weakly developed in the other two. The relative\r\nproportions of the skulls as a whole are nearer those of _nevadensis_\r\nor _saturata_ than _munda_. The skull of one of the three adult males\r\nand the skull of the adult female suggests _M. f. oregonensis_ in\r\ncertain features; for example, the dorsal outline of the skull in\r\nlongitudinal axis is slightly convex as it is in _oregonensis_.\r\n\r\nNone of the specimens shows malformation of the frontal sinuses such as\r\nresults from infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 37, arranged by counties from\r\n     north to south.

Color\r\n     of underparts extends distally on posterior sides of forelegs over\r\n     toes onto antipalmar faces of feet and wrists, on medial sides of\r\n     hind limbs over antiplantar faces of toes and sometimes tarsal\r\n     region. Least width of color of underparts averaging, in 9\r\n     specimens from Fresno, Selma and Los Banos, 54 (32-74) per cent of\r\n     greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail in three\r\n     males (one subadult and 3 adults) averages 55 (50-60) mm. long.\r\n     Thus longer than hind foot and averaging 34 per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 2 adults from Fresno and one\r\n     from Selma): See measurements and plates 21-23, 30. As described\r\n     in _M. f. nigriauris_ except that: Weight 3.8 grams; basilar\r\n     length, 43.7 (43.4-43.9); least width of palate more or less than\r\n     lateral length of P4; length of tympanic bulla more than length of\r\n     lower molar and premolar tooth-rows.\r\n\r\n     Female (no. 2626 W. E. Snyder, from Selma): See measurements and\r\n     plates 34-36. As described in _M. f. nigriauris_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 2.5 grams; basilar length, 39.4.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female is 34 per cent lighter than the average\r\n     for the three males.\r\n\r\nCompared with skulls of _nevadensis_ from the Sierra Nevada, those of\r\nthe two adult males from Fresno differ as follows: M1 wider\r\n(transversely); tympanic bullae narrower; preorbital part of skull\r\nsmaller. Comparison with _pulchra_ is made in the account of that\r\nsubspecies. Compared with skulls of adult males of _nigriauris_, from\r\nSanta Clara County, the two skulls from Fresno are generally smaller\r\nand in basilar length, length of tooth-rows and measurements of the\r\nteeth fall below the minimum for _nigriauris_. Relative proportions of\r\nthe skulls are approximately the same. Comparison with _munda_ reveals\r\nessentially the same differences as does comparison with _nigriauris_\r\nexcept that the difference in size is greater.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The name _Mustela xanthogenys_ Gray was long applied to all\r\nthe weasels of the interior valleys of California and of the coast of\r\nthat state south of San Francisco Bay. Gray, when he named the species\r\nand when referring to it in later accounts, never defined the locality\r\nwhence the specimen came more definitely than \"California.\" In 1896,\r\nMerriam (1896:25) gave the type locality as \"Southern California,\r\nprobably vicinity of San Diego\" and later writers have not contradicted\r\nhim. The type specimen was obtained in the course of the voyage of the\r\nBritish ship Sulphur, under command of Sir Edward Belcher. Examination\r\nof Belcher's (1843, vol. 1, p. 129) narrative of the voyage indicates\r\nthe following places in California at which the specimen of weasel,\r\ndescribed by Gray, could have been obtained: Fort Ross, Bodega,\r\nvicinity of San Francisco Bay and up Sacramento River to the mouth of\r\nthe Feather River, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Buenaventura, San Pedro,\r\nSan Juan, and San Diego.\r\n\r\nReginald I. Pocock has kindly compared the type specimen in the British\r\nMuseum with several specimens sent for that purpose. In the first\r\nplace, comparison of skulls shows that the type specimen is a member of\r\none of the races north of San Diego. In the second place, comparison of\r\nskins shows that the inside of the ears are not blackish but similar in\r\ncolor to the back. In fact, Pocock writes under date of February 12,\r\n1929, regarding the type specimen, that \"It is practically uniformly\r\ncolored from the snout to the base of the tail, there being scarcely a\r\ntrace of the darkening of the head, or muzzle, observable in your\r\nspecimens [those sent for comparison].\" This character of coloration of\r\nthe ear excludes all the weasels of the Coast region of California from\r\nSan Francisco Bay southward, namely, _M. f. latirostra_ and _M. f.\r\nnigriauris_. My own examination of this type specimen at a date later\r\nthan that on which Pocock compared it satisfies me as to the accuracy\r\nof his statement above.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the name _xanthogenys_ would seem to apply to one of the\r\ntwo subspecies here called _munda_ and _xanthogenys_. Perusal of\r\nBelcher's narrative of the voyage (_loc. cit._) shows that little, if\r\nany, opportunity was afforded to obtain vertebrate specimens at Fort\r\nRoss or Bodega, both localities within the range of the subspecies here\r\ncalled _munda_. Furthermore, the type specimen is smaller than\r\nindividuals of _munda_ from 5 to 6 miles west of Inverness and from\r\nPoint Arena with which the animals from Fort Ross and Bodega would be\r\nexpected to agree in size. Weasels from along the north shore of San\r\nFrancisco Bay are smaller than those on the coast north of the bay.\r\nPossibly the type specimen of _xanthogenys_ came from the north side of\r\nSan Francisco Bay but probably it came from the bank of the Sacramento\r\nRiver and almost certainly not farther up stream from San Francisco Bay\r\nthan the junction of the Sacramento and Feather rivers. The statement\r\nof Belcher (1843, vol. 1, p. 129), regarding the trip up the Sacramento\r\nRiver as far as Point Victoria, lat. 38°46´47\" north, and return to\r\nSan Francisco Bay, that \"Cuyote or jackal--fox, racoon, land otter,\r\nweasel, and squirrel were obtained\" lends strong probability to the\r\nidea that this type specimen was taken along the Sacramento River,\r\npossibly in the vicinity of the existing city of Sacramento.\r\nUnfortunately no specimens are available from the Sacramento Valley. If\r\nsome were available, a comparison of them and specimens of _munda_ from\r\nalong the north side of San Francisco Bay and Carquinez Straits with\r\nthe type specimen of _xanthogenys_ should determine the correct\r\napplication of the name. For the present it seems best to retain the\r\nname _munda_ and apply the name _xanthogenys_ to the weasels inhabiting\r\nthe northern part of the San Joaquin Valley and presumably the southern\r\npart of the Sacramento Valley.\r\n\r\nEfforts to obtain specimens of weasels from the Sacramento Valley have\r\nbeen in vain. A juvenal specimen taken five miles south of Fair Oaks,\r\nSacramento County, by Mr. John Fitzgerald, Jr., in December, 1927, was\r\nexamined at his home and found to agree in coloration with specimens\r\nfrom farther south. Geographically, this specimen probably is more\r\nnearly a topotype than any other examined.\r\n\r\nMost of the specimens examined are immature and adequate adult cranial\r\nmaterial has not been seen. Two adults, one of each sex, from Los Banos\r\nhave skulls of large size which agree with those of _nigriauris_. The\r\nsame is true of one adult and one young female from 4 miles southwest\r\nof Turlock, which, unlike the animals from Los Banos, show a darkening\r\nof the head extending in reduced degree even to the inside of the ears,\r\nas in _nigriauris_. The slightly darker than average (for\r\n_xanthogenys_) color on the back may indicate intergradation with\r\n_nevadensis_. Intergradation with _M. f. nevadensis_ is shown by\r\nspecimens, from the southern part of the Sierra Nevada, mentioned in\r\nthe account of _nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nNone of the skulls shows malformation of the frontal sinuses such as\r\nresult from infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number 30, arranged by counties from\r\n     north to south.\r\n\r\n     =California.= _Sacramento County_: Bank of Sacramento River, 1[7];\r\n     5 mi.

Vert.\r\n     Zoöl.; Half Moon Bay, San Mateo County, California; received at\r\n     Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy, May 4, 1922, through A. L.\r\n     Hagedoorn, after having been in captivity a few days where death\r\n     occurred owing to injuries received in trap; original no. 1590.\r\n\r\n     The skull has each of the zygomatic arches and the anterior end of\r\n     the nasals broken through. The only part missing is the central\r\n     two millimeters of the left zygomatic arch. The teeth all are\r\n     present and entire. The skeleton appears to be complete except for\r\n     the bones of the feet, which are preserved within the skin. The\r\n     skin is well made and in good condition.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Altitudinally, sea level to more than 4000 feet; Sonoran\r\n     and Transition life-zones of Coast Range and coast of California\r\n     from San Francisco Bay south to Point Conception, Santa Barbara\r\n     County, California. See figures 29 and 30 on pages 221 and 314.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f. munda_,\r\n     _xanthogenys_, and _pulchra_ by having inside of ears darker than\r\n     back rather than same color as back, and from _xanthogenys_ and\r\n     _pulchra_ in near (_l_) Antique Brown color of upper parts rather\r\n     than Buckthorn Brown or near (16 _j_) Buckthorn Brown to near\r\n     (_h_) Yellow Ocher respectively; from _M. f. latirostra_ by\r\n     postorbital breadth, of adult males and females, less, rather than\r\n     more, than width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of\r\n     one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Five adults from Palo Alto, Santa\r\n     Clara County, yield average and extreme measurements as follows:\r\n     Total length, 447 (412-465); length of tail, 167 (147-175); length\r\n     of hind foot, 46 (45-47). Corresponding measurements of four\r\n     adults from San Francisco are: 412 (394-435); 153 (145-160); 43.5\r\n     (41-46). Corresponding measurements of five adults and subadults\r\n     from Berkeley, Alameda County, are: 419 (390-448); 148 (135-160);\r\n     44 (42-47). Tail averages 59 per cent as long as head and body in\r\n     series from Palo Alto and in one from San Francisco. The average\r\n     of 55 for the Berkeley series probably reflects a lesser average\r\n     age. Length of hind foot less than basal length. The type specimen\r\n     measures, 415, 150, 43. It is smaller than the mean.\r\n\r\n     Female: A subadult from Palo Alto measures: Total length, 368;\r\n     length of tail, 126; length of hind foot, 39. An adult and two\r\n     subadults from Berkeley measure, respectively, as follows: Total\r\n     length, 347, 365, 340; length of tail, 134, 123, 125; length of\r\n     hind foot, 37, 38.4, 36.5. In these four females the tail averages\r\n     55 per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind foot less\r\n     than basal length.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes,\r\n     as represented by specimens from Berkeley, Alameda County, are:\r\n     Total length, 68; length of tail, 21; length of hind foot, 7.\r\n     Eight adult males weigh 249 (217-335) grams and one adult female\r\n     123 grams.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae brownish like dark color of\r\n     head and extending beyond ear; carpal vibrissae mostly color of\r\n     underparts and extending to apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness\r\n     of foot-soles slightly more than shown in figure 20.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Spot between eyes, band, confluent with color of\r\n     underparts, on each side of head extending anterodorsally anterior\r\n     to ear, and posterior third of each upper lip tinged with color of\r\n     underparts or, less often, pure white; chin and lower lips white;\r\n     remainder of sides and top of head posteriorly to, or a little\r\n     behind, a line connecting posterior margins of ears, blackish;\r\n     inside of pinna of ear, and sometimes outside of pinna, blackish;\r\n     dark spot posterior to each angle of mouth present on each side in\r\n     three-fourths of specimens; tip of tail black; remainder of upper\r\n     parts near (_l_) Antique Brown, and with more yellow than tone 3\r\n     of Raw Umber of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 301. Often with more\r\n     blackish and red in winter. Underparts near (_a_ to _c_)\r\n     Ochraceous-Buff or Ochraceous-Salmon. Ochraceous-Salmon in some\r\n     juveniles. Color of underparts extends distally on posterior sides\r\n     of forelegs over toes onto antipalmar faces of feet and wrists,\r\n     and on medial sides of hind limbs over antiplantar faces of toes.\r\n     Least width of color of underparts averaging, in 17 adult males\r\n     (Berkeley, 5; San Francisco, 5; Palo Alto, 7), 55 (40-73) per cent\r\n     of greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail in\r\n     same series of males averaging 51 (35-60) mm., thus averaging\r\n     longer than hind foot and 33 per cent of length of tail (Palo Alto\r\n     and San Francisco, 31 per cent; Berkeley, 35 per cent). In 8 adult\r\n     females, least color of underparts amounts to 55 (47-62) per cent\r\n     of greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail\r\n     averages 41.5 (28-50) mm., thus averaging longer than hind foot\r\n     and 32 per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on six adults from Stanford Univ.\r\n     and vicinity): See measurements and plates 22-24; weight (four\r\n     adults), 5.4 (5.0-5.9) grams; basilar length, 47 (46.1-48.1);\r\n     zygomatic breadth more than distance between condylar foramen and\r\n     M1, or than between anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin\r\n     of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth more than postpalatal length;\r\n     postorbital breadth less than length of upper premolars (less than\r\n     distance between posterior borders of P4 and P2) and less than\r\n     width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen\r\n     lacerum posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth not\r\n     greater than distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin\r\n     of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum less than length of tympanic\r\n     bulla; least width of palate less than lateral length of P4;\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen\r\n     ovale as width of 3 or 4 (including I3) upper incisors; height of\r\n     tympanic bulla more than distance from its anterior margin to\r\n     foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more or less than (about\r\n     equal to) length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and longer\r\n     or shorter (usually shorter) than rostrum; anterior margin of\r\n     masseteric fossa below anterior half of m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on three adults, Hayward, Palo Alto, and Morro): See\r\n     measurements and plates 34-36; weight (no. 43574, from Morro) 2.7\r\n     grams; basilar length, 41.2 (40.2-42.2); zygomatic breadth more or\r\n     less than distance between condylar foramen and M1 and more or\r\n     less than distance between anterior palatine foramen and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; postorbital breadth less than length of\r\n     upper premolars and less than width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     least width of palate less than lateral length of P4; tympanic\r\n     bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3 (including\r\n     I3) upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla more than distance\r\n     from its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic\r\n     bulla more than length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row and\r\n     longer or shorter than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 50 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the average male.\r\n\r\n     Comparisons of the skull of the male with those of _M. f.\r\n     latirostra_, _pulchra_, _xanthogenys_, and _munda_ are made in the\r\n     accounts of those subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Like _M. f. latirostra_, _nigriauris_ long bore the name\r\n_xanthogenys_. The fairly adequate lot of specimens is divided between\r\nthe collections of several institutions. The most satisfactory material\r\nin any one collection is in the Stanford University Natural History\r\nMuseum where local specimens have been accumulated over a period of\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nNo actual intergrade between _nigriauris_ and _xanthogenys_ has been\r\nseen, although the specimens from Los Banos, referred to _xanthogenys_,\r\nhave large skulls as in _nigriauris_. Intergradation with _latirostra_\r\nis shown by specimens, referred to _latirostra_, from the Los Angeles\r\narea. Also the one adult male from 5 miles southeast of Santa\r\nMargarita, San Luis Obispo County, is of small size and in this respect\r\napproaches _latirostra_. The range of _nigriauris_ is separated from\r\nthat of _munda_ by San Francisco Bay, Carquinez Straits, and I suppose\r\nby the lower part of the San Joaquin River. On the basis of color of\r\nthe inside of the pinna of the ear, the two subspecies are uniformly\r\ndistinct. Intergradation is assumed to occur through the subspecies\r\n_xanthogenys_.\r\n\r\nNone of the 26 adult and subadult specimens examined for evidences of\r\ninfestation of the frontal sinuses by parasites shows malformation of\r\nthe sinuses.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 103, arranged by counties\r\n     from north to south.

See figures 29 and 30 on pages 221 and\r\n     314.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f.\r\n     nigriauris_ by having postorbital breadth of adult males and\r\n     females, more, rather than less, than width of basioccipital\r\n     measured from medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to\r\n     its opposite; from _M. f. pulchra_ by having tympanic bulla longer\r\n     than rostrum (orbitonasal length) and by near (_l_) Antique Brown\r\n     rather than near (16 _j_) Buckthorn Brown to near (_h_) Yellow\r\n     Ocher color of upper parts.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Six adults and subadults from San\r\n     Diego yield average and extreme measurements as follows: Total\r\n     length, 439 (428-449); length of tail, 153 (142-160); length of\r\n     hind foot, 45 (40-47). Corresponding measurements for a series of\r\n     eight adult males from the vicinity of Los Angeles are: 416\r\n     (394-428); 158 (151-166); 44 (40-47). In the series from San Diego\r\n     the tail averages 54 per cent as long as head and body. In the\r\n     series from Los Angeles the average is 61 per cent. Length of hind\r\n     foot in each series, less than basal length. The type specimen\r\n     measures, 435, 142, 42.\r\n\r\n     Female: No. 5070, adult, from San Diego, measures 367, 141, 38.\r\n     Nos. 22 and 6748 from Santa Ysabel, measure: 359, 380; 130, 140;\r\n     39, 35. No. 7194 from Jamacha measures, 358, 125, 35. Three adult\r\n     females from Los Angeles yield the following: Total length, 373,\r\n     345, 368; length of tail, 150, 122, 134; length of hind foot,--,\r\n     41, 41. In no. 5070 the tail is 62 per cent as long as the head\r\n     and body and in the three from Los Angeles it averages 60 (55-67)\r\n     per cent. Length of hind foot, in each case, less than basal\r\n     length.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes\r\n     as shown by the six males from San Diego and the four females\r\n     from San Diego County are: Total length, 73; length of tail, 19;\r\n     length of hind foot, 8. Corresponding differences shown by the\r\n     eight males and three females from Los Angeles are: 54, 23, 3.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae brownish, like dark color\r\n     of head and extending beyond ear; carpal vibrissae mostly color of\r\n     underparts and extending to apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness\r\n     of foot-soles slightly more than shown in figure 20.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Spot between eyes, band confluent with color of\r\n     underparts on each side of head extending anterodorsally anterior\r\n     to ear, and posterior third of each upper lip tinged with color of\r\n     underparts or, less often, white; chin and lower lips white;\r\n     remainder of sides and top of head posteriorly to near line\r\n     connecting posterior margins of ears, blackish; inside of pinna of\r\n     ear, and sometimes outside of pinna, blackish; dark spot posterior\r\n     to each angle of mouth present on each side in three-fourths of\r\n     specimens; tip of tail black; remainder of upper parts near (_l_)\r\n     Antique Brown, and with more yellow than tone 3 of Raw Umber of\r\n     Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 301. Underparts Ochraceous-Buff to\r\n     Warm Buff and in some specimens from Los Angeles and Ventura\r\n     counties Ochraceous-Orange, especially in young and juveniles.\r\n     Color of underparts extends distally on posterior sides of\r\n     forelegs over toes onto antipalmar faces of feet and wrists and on\r\n     medial sides of hind limbs over antiplantar faces of toes. Least\r\n     width of color of underparts averaging, in 15 adult and subadult\r\n     males from San Diego County, 54 (35-75) per cent of greatest width\r\n     of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail in same series of males\r\n     averaging 54.5 (46-60) mm. long. Thus averaging longer than hind\r\n     foot and 35 per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 6 adults from San Diego\r\n     County). See measurements and plates 22-24. As described in _M. f.\r\n     nigriauris_ except that: Weight (4 specimens), 3.9 (3.8-4.0)\r\n     grams; basilar length 43.8 (41.9-47.0); postorbital breadth more\r\n     than width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one\r\n     foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth\r\n     not less than distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin\r\n     of tympanic bulla; anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far\r\n     posterior to foramen ovale as width of 2 to 2-1/2 (including I3)\r\n     upper incisors; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower\r\n     molar and premolar tooth-row and longer than rostrum; anterior\r\n     margin of masseteric fossa below m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on 4 adults from San Diego County): See\r\n     measurements. As described in _M. f. nigriauris_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 2.6 (2.2-2.8) grams; basilar length, 40.0 and 40.1;\r\n     postorbital breadth more than width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     length of tympanic bulla more than length of rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 34 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the average male.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the male of _latirostra_, compared with that of\r\n_nigriauris_, is by weight, more than one-fourth lighter, has a lesser\r\nbasilar length, a lesser mastoid breadth, a lesser zygomatic breadth\r\nand a narrower M1. In these features no overlap has been observed\r\nbetween adults from the general vicinities of the type localities of\r\nthe two forms. In adult males of _latirostra_ the postorbital breadth,\r\nwith one exception, is more than the combined length of P4 and P3\r\nwhereas the reverse is true in adult males of _nigriauris_. Both males\r\nand females of _latirostra_ have a generally smaller skull with\r\nrelatively broader interorbital and postorbital parts and the tympanic\r\nbullae are relatively larger, rounder and more inflated.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of the male of _pulchra_ that of _latirostra_\r\nis, by weight, more than one-fourth lighter, has a lesser basilar and\r\norbitonasal length, lesser zygomatic and mastoid breadth and a more\r\nnearly flat braincase. In these features no overlap has been observed\r\nbetween adults from the general vicinities of the type localities of\r\nthe two subspecies. Also, in _latirostra_ the tympanic bulla is longer\r\nthan the rostrum whereas the opposite is true in _pulchra_. The skull\r\nof _latirostra_ is generally smaller and relatively, on the average,\r\nhas the preorbital part of the skull deeper and broader with longer\r\ntooth-rows, although with shorter rostrum, while the zygomatic and\r\nmastoid breadths are less. Study of skulls of subadult females of\r\n_pulchra_ indicate that females of _latirostra_ and _pulchra_ differ in\r\nthe same fashion as do males.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This subspecies long has gone by the name _M. xanthogenys_\r\nand the type locality was generally supposed to be in the vicinity of\r\nSan Diego. This supposition seems to have originated with Merriam's\r\n(1896:25) statement that the type locality was \"Southern California,\r\nprobably vicinity of San Diego.\" Nevertheless, as set forth in the\r\naccount of _M. f. xanthogenys_ the type specimen concerned now is\r\nthought to have come from much farther north.\r\n\r\nAlthough 76 Recent specimens are available from southern California,\r\nadditional adults are needed to understand the geographic variation\r\nthere. _M. f. latirostra_ may be a composite--made up of more than one\r\ngeographic race. Specimens from San Diego County differ so much in\r\nrelative length of the tail that at one stage in the present study it\r\nwas thought that a difference in this respect existed between the\r\ncoastal animals and those from farther inland. Material received later\r\ndid not wholly substantiate this view and because of the uniformly\r\nsmall size of all of the skulls from that county, the animals were\r\nlater regarded as of the same subspecies. Eventually, even this\r\nsupposed common feature proved to be inconstant for an adult male from\r\nJamacha, no. 7098, of the San Diego Society of Natural History, and\r\nanother adult male from San Marcos, no. 8869, collection of Ralph\r\nEllis, were later examined and found to have skulls as large as those\r\nof average-sized, adult males of _nigriauris_.\r\n\r\nDespite these puzzling local variations, it is established that the\r\nlong-tailed weasels of southern California are smaller than those from\r\nfarther north. Also, the southern animal averages smaller in weight and\r\nsize of skull, and the skull is differently proportioned. Specimens in\r\nseries from Los Angeles County definitely are intermediate in size and\r\nshape of skull between _latirostra_ from San Diego County and\r\n_nigriauris_ from, say, Santa Clara County, but definitely more closely\r\nresemble _latirostra_ from San Diego County than they do _nigriauris_.\r\nA skull of a young animal, not here identified to subspecies, from\r\nPotholes, in the Colorado River Valley, 10 miles northeast of Bard,\r\nImperial County, California, may have closest relationship to _M. f.\r\nlatirostra_. Additional comment on this specimen is offered in the\r\naccount of _M. f. neomexicana_.\r\n\r\nFrom the asphalt pits of Rancho La Brea, in Los Angeles County, a total\r\nof 57 skulls have been examined, more than half of which are reasonably\r\ncomplete. I have been unable to learn whether these came from pits\r\nregarded by students of the deposit as wholly Recent, from pits\r\nregarded as of Pleistocene age, or from both. Suffice to say that only\r\ntwo specimens were found which could be distinguished from skulls of\r\nthe subspecies of weasel living in that area today.\r\n\r\nThese two specimens, lent to me by Professor Chester Stock, were with\r\nother skulls received from the Los Angeles Museum of History, Art and\r\nScience and bore identifying numbers as follows: 16/20-27, the anterior\r\npart of the skull of an adult, and 16, the skull posterior to the\r\ncribiform plate of a subadult or possibly young individual. The latter\r\nhas a mastoid breadth of 28.0 millimeters, a tympanic bulla 16.1 long\r\nand other measurements in proportion. It is larger than any specimen of\r\nweasel, of any subspecies, seen from California and in the subgenus\r\n_Mustela_ seems to be exceeded in size only by certain individuals of\r\n_M. f. texensis_. _M. f. neomexicana_ attains relatively large size and\r\ncomparisons were made with individuals of that subspecies. However, the\r\nyoung specimen from Rancho La Brea differs from _neomexicana_ in that\r\nthe tympanic bullae rise less steeply on the medial sides and the\r\ninferior lip of the external auditory meatus is less developed\r\nlaterally. Age considered, the sagittal crest is less developed and the\r\nmastoid processes project more abruptly from the skull. The anterior\r\npart of the skull of the adult, no. 16/20-27 is larger than any\r\nspecimen seen of _M. f. latirostra_ or adjoining subspecies, and among\r\nCalifornia-taken specimens is equaled in size only by the largest males\r\nof _M. f. munda_ from the northwest coastal district in Mendocino\r\nCounty. This adult from Rancho La Brea differs from _neomexicana_, sex\r\nand age taken into account, in greater postorbital breadth, lesser\r\nrostral width in comparison with the interorbital breadth, and in\r\nhaving the temporal ridges at the anterior end of the sagittal crest\r\nspread out into a Y-shaped, rather than a T-shaped, pattern. All these\r\ndifferences from _neomexicana_ are features of agreement with the\r\nCalifornia bridled weasels of the subspecies _latirostra_,\r\n_nigriauris_, and _munda_. The same is true of the characters which set\r\napart the young specimen from _neomexicana_. In summary: of 57 weasel\r\nskulls examined from the asphalt pits at Rancho La Brea, Los Angeles\r\nCounty, all but two are indistinguishable from the skulls of the Recent\r\nweasel living in that region today. These two skulls agree in\r\nqualitative characters with animals of the California coastal\r\nsubspecies now living from Los Angeles northward to Humboldt County,\r\nbut are larger. For the time being these two may be thought of as\r\ngiants of the same type of animal inhabiting the Los Angeles region\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nOnly one of 41 adult and subadult skulls examined for malformation of\r\nthe frontal sinuses shows infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 142, listed by counties from\r\n     north to south.

Length of hind foot approximately equal to basal length.\r\n     The type specimen measures, 460, 184, 49.\r\n\r\n     Female: Three subadult topotypes yield average and extreme\r\n     measurements as follows: Total length, 399 (383-411); length of\r\n     tail, 154 (140-161); length of hind foot, 42 (41-42). Tail\r\n     averages 63 per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind foot\r\n     less than basal length.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes\r\n     are: Total length, 55; length of tail, 24; length of hind foot, 8.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata nigriauris_.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Spot between eyes, band confluent with color of\r\n     underparts, on each side of head extending anterodorsally anterior\r\n     to each ear, posterior third of each upper lip, lower lips and\r\n     chin white or more often darker than Ochraceous-Buff and\r\n     therefore same color as belly; dark spot posterior to each angle\r\n     of mouth present but small; tip of tail black; remainder of upper\r\n     parts near (16 _j_) Buckthorn Brown to near (_h_) Yellow Ocher and\r\n     from tone 2 to 4 of Brown Pink of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 297,\r\n     but with a trifle more reddish brown. Upper parts of uniform color\r\n     except for occasional slight darkening of nose, forehead, and\r\n     areas around eyes. Underparts darker (_a_) than Ochraceous-Buff.\r\n     Color of underparts extends distally on posterior sides of\r\n     forelegs over toes, onto antipalmar faces of feet and wrists, on\r\n     medial sides of hind limbs over antiplantar faces of toes, tarsal\r\n     region and sometimes in diluted fashion on proximal third of\r\n     underside of tail. Least width of color of underparts averaging,\r\n     in 6 male topotypes, 55 (43-81) per cent of greatest width of\r\n     color of upper parts. Black tip of tail in same series of males\r\n     averaging 58 (53-63) mm. long; thus averaging longer than hind\r\n     foot and 33 per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on 6 ads., type and 5 topotypes):\r\n     See measurements and plates 22-24. As described in _M. f.\r\n     nigriauris_ except that: Weight (6 ads.), 5.3 (4.5-6.1) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 47.6 (46.0-48.6); (one skull, no. 335, with\r\n     postorbital breadth more than distance between posterior borders\r\n     of P4 and P2); interorbital breadth more or less than distance\r\n     between foramen opticum and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen\r\n     ovale as width of 2 to 3-1/2 (including I3) upper incisors; length\r\n     of tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar and premolar\r\n     tooth-row and shorter than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     Female: Adult skull of typical female not seen.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the skull of the type specimen of _inyoensis_, skulls\r\nof adult males of _pulchra_ are larger throughout, relatively broader,\r\nespecially in the preorbital part of the skull, have more inflated\r\ntympanic bullae, and are less convex in dorsal outline. Comparison of\r\nthe skull with that of _latirostra_ has been made in discussion of that\r\nsubspecies. Comparison of skulls of adult males of _nigriauris_ and\r\n_pulchra_ shows that those of _pulchra_ average larger in every\r\nmeasurement taken except those of m1, M1, P4, and depth of skull at\r\nposterior borders of upper molars. The basilar length is only slightly\r\nmore and it follows that, relative to this length, other measurements\r\nof the skull are relatively, as well as actually, larger. In no one\r\nmeasurement is there an entire lack of overlap, but the skulls of adult\r\nmales, and probably adult females, may be distinguished from those of\r\n_nigriauris_ by the combination of the following mentioned, average\r\ndifferences: Tympanic bullae larger in each of three dimensions;\r\npreorbital and interorbital parts of skull broader and notably heavier;\r\ninterorbital breadth greater; zygomatic arches more expanded laterally;\r\nmastoid processes more prominent. As compared with _xanthogenys_,\r\ndifferences of similar nature, but of greater degree, distinguish\r\n_pulchra_. As compared with those of _nevadensis_ (represented by\r\nspecimens from Mono Co., Calif.), skulls of adult males of _pulchra_\r\naverage larger in every measurement taken and no overlap exists in\r\nbasilar length, orbitonasal length, mastoid breadth, zygomatic breadth,\r\nlength of tympanic bulla, or depth of skull at either the anterior\r\nmargin of the basioccipital or at the posterior margins of the upper\r\nmolars. Relatively, the preorbital portion is about the same size in\r\nthe two forms.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The best material of this big weasel was obtained in 1910\r\nand 1911 by John Wimmer and forwarded to the California Academy of\r\nSciences through John R. Rowley, although in 1905, one specimen had\r\nbeen obtained by A. S. Bunnell for the collections of the United States\r\nBureau of Biological Survey, another by J. Grinnell for the Museum of\r\nVertebrate Zoölogy in 1912, and in 1933, another by L. M. Huey, for the\r\nSan Diego Society of Natural History.\r\n\r\nThe males from the type locality are relatively uniform in size and\r\nshape of skull. The one exception is no. 137935, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\nslightly younger than the others. Its skull is relatively more slender\r\nthan any of the others and does not display several of the differential\r\ncharacters. The male, no. 127566, U. S. Nat. Mus., from Alila (=\r\nEarlimart) is intermediate in cranial features between _pulchra_ and\r\n_xanthogenys_ as known from specimens taken in the vicinity of Fresno.\r\nThe skull of the female, no. 127565, from the same place, is too young\r\nto provide diagnostic characters. Since the skull of an adult female of\r\ntopotypical _pulchra_ is unknown, doubt attaches to the identification\r\nof the adult, female specimen, no. 115895, U. S. Nat. Mus., from\r\nDelano. It has a relatively broad skull in comparison with the adult\r\nfemale of _xanthogenys_ from Los Banos. The adult female, no. 9998, San\r\nDiego Soc. Nat. Hist., from 2 mi. SW Simmler, shows approach to\r\n_nigriauris_ in slightly reduced size. The skin alone from Coalinga, a\r\nmale, taken on April 10, 1935, measures 462, 179, 47. The adult female,\r\nwith crushed skull, from 4 miles east of Coalinga, measures 350, 129,\r\n40. In size, these specimens agree better with _pulchra_ than with\r\n_xanthogenys_. The skin alone from 3 miles south of Coalinga is unsexed\r\nand without external measurements. Skulls of adults from Coalinga are\r\nneeded to permit of more positive identification of the subspecies\r\nfound there. The female from 4 miles east of Coalinga, taken on\r\nFebruary 21, 1936, is in process of molt on the underparts, and the\r\nlonger hair which is near (20´) Naples Yellow contrasts strongly with\r\nthe incoming shorter hair which is near (10 _c_) Salmon-Orange. The\r\nskin alone, no. 16270, Mus. Vert. Zoöl., from Isabella, was made up\r\nfrom a decayed animal and is of but little use. It is referred to\r\n_pulchra_ purely because of geographic nearness of Isabella to the type\r\nlocality of _pulchra_. The most that can be told from the specimen is\r\nthat it is a relatively light-colored, bridled weasel. The fact that\r\nthe color is slightly darker than in _pulchra_ may or may not indicate\r\nintergradation with _nevadensis_. No. 54103/41042, U. S. Nat. Mus.,\r\nconsisting of crushed bits of skull and the skin of the head, is from\r\nWillow Spring, Kern County. This marginal locality is really in the\r\nMojave Desert rather than in the San Joaquin Valley. The light color of\r\nthe skin of the head suggests _pulchra_, but it is realized that a\r\ncomplete specimen might show the animal there to be unlike _pulchra_.\r\n\r\nNone of the skulls shows evidence of having had the frontal sinuses\r\ninfested by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 18, listed by counties from\r\n     north to south.

Length of hind foot less than basal length.\r\n\r\n     The differences in external measurements between the two sexes, as\r\n     represented by the male type specimen and by the young female,\r\n     are: Total length, 33, length of tail, 20; length of hind foot, 3.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black or dark brown and\r\n     reaching beyond ear; carpal vibrissae same color as underparts and\r\n     extending to apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness of foot-soles\r\n     (in summer pelage) slightly less than shown in figure 19.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Large spot between eyes, band confluent with color of\r\n     underparts, on each side of head extending anterodorsally anterior\r\n     to each ear, upper throat, chin, lower lips and in some specimens\r\n     part or all of upper lips white; patch between eyes and bars in\r\n     front of ears tinged with some shade of yellowish in one specimen;\r\n     dark spot posterior to each angle of mouth present in four of five\r\n     specimens; tip of tail black; remainder of upper parts, in summer,\r\n     near (_l_) Brussels Brown or tones 1 to 2 of Raw Umber of Oberthür\r\n     and Dauthenay, pl. 301; slightly darker brown on forehead, nose\r\n     and about eyes. In winter near (_j_) Snuff Brown or lighter than\r\n     Brussels Brown with a smoked effect. Underparts Buff-Yellow,\r\n     winter and summer. Color of underparts extends distally on\r\n     posterior sides of forelegs over toes onto antipalmar faces of\r\n     feet and wrists and on medial sides of hind legs over antiplantar\r\n     faces of toes. Least width of color of underparts averaging, in 5\r\n     available specimens 34 (24-42) per cent of greatest width of color\r\n     of upper parts. Black tip of tail, in two adult males, averaging\r\n     53 (45 and 60) mm. Thus longer than hind foot and averaging 34 per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on the type): See measurements and\r\n     plates 22-24. As described in _M. f. nigriauris_ except that:\r\n     Weight, 4.4 grams; basilar length, 44.7; postorbital breadth not\r\n     less than width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of\r\n     one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; length of tympanic\r\n     bulla less than length of lower molar and premolar tooth-row.\r\n\r\n     Female: Adult unknown.\r\n\r\nCompared with the skull of the male of _nevadensis_, no single\r\ndifference not covered by individual variation in _nevadensis_ has been\r\ndetected. Selected differences of _inyoensis_ in comparison with\r\n_latirostra_ are larger size, less inflated tympanic bullae and\r\nrelative narrowness of the postorbital, interorbital and preorbital\r\nparts of the skull. Comparison of the skull with that of _M. f.\r\npulchra_ is made in the account of that subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Although two specimens of this subspecies were taken during\r\nthe Death Valley Survey conducted by Dr. C. Hart Merriam, only three\r\nadditional individuals are known to have been saved as study specimens\r\nsince that time.\r\n\r\n_M. f. inyoensis_ as now known may be thought of as closely similar to\r\n_M. f. nevadensis_ except for the presence of well-developed white\r\nfacial markings like those found in the weasels of the San Joaquin\r\nValley and coastal region of California south of San Francisco Bay. The\r\nnonwhite areas of the head are almost the same color as the back and\r\nnot distinctly blackish as in _M. f. latirostra_ and _M. f.\r\nnigriauris_. The one specimen in the winter coat, no. 25392/32805, U.\r\nS. Nat. Mus., from Lone Pine, is brown rather than white. The brown has\r\nthe pale smoke-tinge common in the winter pelage of subspecies whose\r\nmembers are either brown or white in winter. The range of this\r\nsubspecies is thought to include the floor and lower elevations of\r\nOwens Valley although it may occur in limited numbers southwestward\r\nalong the base of the Sierra Nevada and through the mountains in places\r\nof low elevation like Walker Pass its range may meet that of _pulchra_.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen was taken in an alfalfa field by ranch hands, who,\r\naccording to A. C. Shelton (MS), stated that the species was common at\r\nthe type locality. None of the five specimens shows infestation of the\r\nfrontal sinuses by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 5, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south.\r\n\r\n     =California.= _Inyo County_: Alvord, 4000 ft., 1 (U.

Tail 70 per cent as long as head and\r\n     body. Length of hind foot less than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: No. 21779 from Tombstone, Arizona, measured: Total length,\r\n     419; length of tail, 165; length of hind foot from dried skin, 41\r\n     (probably 43 in flesh). Tail 65 per cent as long as head and body.\r\n     Length of hind foot less than basal length.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes,\r\n     as known from these two individuals, are: Total length, 81; length\r\n     of tail, 40; length of hind foot, 7.\r\n\r\n     Compared with _M. f. frenata_, the size, proportions of parts and\r\n     difference in size of the two sexes, appears to be about the same.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae colored like upper parts\r\n     [in the type specimen some of the \"long bristles of the upper lip\"\r\n     are white as pointed out by Barber and Cockerell (_op. cit._:\r\n     188)] and extending beyond ear; carpal vibrissae colored like\r\n     underparts and extending to apical pad of fifth digit; hairiness\r\n     of foot-soles as shown in figure 20.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Broad white bands on sides of head, extending\r\n     anterodorsally anterior to each ear, confluent with white spot\r\n     between eyes and with color of underparts; posterior half or all\r\n     of each upper lip edged with white; usually few white hairs on top\r\n     of head between ears; remainder of top of head near Argus Brown of\r\n     Ridgway and Chocolate, tone 4, of Oberthür and Dauthenay; dark\r\n     spot posterior to each angle of mouth usually absent; tip of tail\r\n     black; remainder of upper parts varying, in different specimens,\r\n     from Buckthorn Brown to Dresden Brown of Ridgway, and Brown Pink\r\n     (tones 3 to 4, pl. 297, of Oberthür and Dauthenay); underparts\r\n     Antimony Yellow or near (_c_) Warm Buff of Ridgway, and Brown Pink\r\n     (tone 1, pl. 297, of Oberthür and Dauthenay); color of underparts\r\n     extends distally on legs over forefeet and hind feet. Least width\r\n     of color of underparts averaging 46 (41-55) per cent of greatest\r\n     width of color of upper parts; black tip of tail 35 to 45 mm. long\r\n     in females; 43 to 68 mm. long in males and averaging 21 (20-36)\r\n     per cent as long as tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     No specimen of this subspecies in the white winter coat has been\r\n     seen. Animals taken in midwinter are available from Mesilla Park,\r\n     Willcox, and 10 miles east of Roswell.\r\n\r\n     From _M. f. frenata_, _neomexicana_ differs in: upper parts and\r\n     underparts much lighter colored; white facial markings more\r\n     extensive; color of underparts more extended onto feet. From _M.\r\n     f. leucoparia_, _neomexicana_ differs as follows: above and below,\r\n     much lighter colored, but white facial markings less extensive and\r\n     color of underparts less extended onto feet and legs.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on adults: the type; no. 131582\r\n     from Berino, New Mexico; and no. 1485 from Seward Co., Kansas):\r\n     See measurements and plates 22-24. As described in _Mustela\r\n     frenata frenata_ except that: Weight, 6.2 (4.9 and 7.5); basilar\r\n     length, 49.3 (48 and 50.5); mastoid breadth more than postpalatal\r\n     length; least width of palate less than length of P4; anterior\r\n     margin of masseteric fossa directly below m2 or heel of ml.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on three adults): See measurements and plates 34-36.\r\n     As described in _Mustela frenata frenata_ except that: Weight, 3.1\r\n     (2.6-3.5) grams; basilar length, 42.7 (40.8-45.5); zygomatic\r\n     breadth less than distance between condylar foramen and M1 and\r\n     more or less than distance between anterior palatine foramen and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 50 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the male.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the skull of the male of _M. f. frenata_, that of\r\n_neomexicana_ is decidedly more angular and ridged. The postorbital\r\nconstriction is narrower, the mastoid breadth greater (it is less than\r\nthe postpalatal length in some subadult males), the sagittal crest much\r\nhigher with impressions of the temporal and masseter muscles carried\r\nfarther forward on the frontals, rostrum shorter and tympanic bullae\r\nwider and more inflated. Similar, though less marked, differences exist\r\nbetween the females. As compared with _M. f. leucoparia_ and _perotae_,\r\nthe same differences as noted above between _frenata_ and _neomexicana_\r\nexist. In addition the tympanic bullae are so far removed from the\r\nforamen ovale that the distance from the anterior end of each bulla to\r\nthe foramen ovale, instead of being less than the height of tympanic\r\nbullae, is in _leucoparia_ more than four-fifths this height and in\r\n_perotae_ more than the entire height. Also, in _perotae_, the\r\nsquamosal, anterior to each tympanic bulla, is ventrally convex rather\r\nthan ventrally concave as in _neomexicana_. Compared with _M. f.\r\nlongicauda_, _neomexicana_ is relatively narrower in the interorbital\r\nregion, has relatively shorter tooth-rows, a V-shaped rather than a\r\nU-shaped interpterygoid space and in males has the interorbital region\r\nflat rather than convex and the sagittal crest is higher. The same\r\ndifferences are to be noted in comparison with _nevadensis_ but here\r\nthe difference in relative length of tooth-row is less. The same\r\ndifferences exist also in comparison with _M. f. arizonensis_ except\r\nthat its interorbital breadth, relative to the rest of the skull, is\r\nabout the same. Difference in size is especially marked here; even\r\nfemales of _neomexicana_ average larger than males of _arizonensis_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--When Barber and Cockerell named this subspecies in 1898,\r\nthey had three specimens. Only two others are known to have been taken\r\nbefore this time. These are a skeleton, without corresponding skin,\r\ntaken at Lozier, Texas, in 1890 by Wm. Lloyd, and no. 21779/36482, U.\r\nS. Nat. Mus., taken on April 6, 1893, by R. D. Lusk at Tombstone,\r\nArizona. On the back of a label recently attached to the last mentioned\r\nspecimen the name C. K. Worthen appears and probably signifies that the\r\nspecimen was purchased from this dealer in vertebrate specimens.\r\n\r\n_M. f. neomexicana_ has a large geographic range. The old male from\r\nLiberal, Seward County, Kansas, extends the known range far to the\r\nnortheast. Geographically, this occurrence is logical for the\r\nsouthwestern desertlike conditions extend to this part of Kansas.\r\nProbably the subspecies occurs in southeastern Colorado and in the\r\npanhandle of Oklahoma where conditions are similar. Bailey (1905:198)\r\nlists _neomexicana_ as a member of the mammalian fauna of Texas. As\r\nstated by him (_loc. cit._:198) this inclusion is based on geographic\r\ngrounds and not on actual specimens. Strecker (1926:13) also includes\r\n_neomexicana_ in his list of Texas mammals but writes me, under date of\r\nJanuary 9, 1928, that \"I included _Mustela frenata neomexicana_ as a\r\nTexas mammal on the strength of its being mentioned by Bailey. . . .\"\r\nOn better ground, Bailey (1928:97) lists the subspecies as occurring in\r\nsoutheastern New Mexico at Carlsbad Cavern. However, Bailey (_loc.\r\ncit._) knew of the existence of weasels just below El Paso and at\r\nLangtry, Texas. An unsexed skeleton, no. 167891, in the United States\r\nNational Museum, from Lozier, Texas, is not certainly identifiable to\r\nsubspecies. If, as I think, the animal is a female, its skull is\r\nintermediate between that of _frenata_ and _neomexicana_ although when\r\nall features are considered it is seen to be nearest the latter. The\r\nlarge size (basilar length of 46.5 mm.) may reflect some relationship\r\nto _texensis_. The field notes of the collector furnished me by Dr. H.\r\nH. T. Jackson (MS), describe the color as brownish yellow above and\r\nsulphur below. The admission of this subspecies to the list of mammals\r\nof Texas is made certain by the female (no. 1572, Texas Cooperative\r\nResearch Collection) taken on July 28, 1940, 1-1/2 mi. NW Kent, Texas,\r\nby C. E. Scull.\r\n\r\nThe skull alone from Durango (City of), extends the known range far to\r\nthe south. This skull is typical of _neomexicana_. Skins from the same\r\nplace would be especially interesting as showing the approach, if any,\r\nin color, of _neomexicana_ to _M. f. leucoparia_.\r\n\r\nMr. D. D. Stone of Casa Grande, Arizona, writes, under date of February\r\n2, 1927, that a weasel was seen by an acquaintance of his in a field\r\nnear Chandler, Maricopa County, Arizona. Probably this was\r\n_neomexicana_. If so, its range extends much farther west than\r\ncollected specimens show.\r\n\r\nActual intergradation with _M. f. frenata_ is not shown by the material\r\nat hand. The two females from Albuquerque, although typically\r\n_neomexicana_ as regards color, have smaller, less prominently ridged\r\nskulls than females of _neomexicana_ of the same age from farther south\r\nand approach _M. f. nevadensis_.\r\n\r\nProbably the geographic ranges of _M. f. neomexicana_ and _M. f.\r\nlatirostra_ do not meet; the only evidence of the existence of weasels\r\nin all of the large area, comprising western Arizona and the deserts of\r\neastern California, which intervenes between the ranges of the two\r\nsubspecies is the skull of a young individual, no. 68842, Mus. Vert.\r\nZoöl., from 10 miles northeast of Bard, Imperial County, California.\r\nThere, on December 29, 1932, Jack C. vonBloeker, Jr., retrieved the\r\nweathered skull with some of the vertebrae attached, from the top of a\r\nwood rat's nest beneath a mesquite tree near the west bank of the\r\nColorado River.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the carcass may have been washed down the river from far\r\nupstream gains no support from a comparison of the specimen itself for\r\nthe tympanic bullae are larger than in _nevadensis_ and the skull is\r\nlarger than the largest males seen of _arizonensis_, the two upriver\r\nraces. On the basis of size the skull could be either a male of\r\n_latirostra_ or a female of _neomexicana_. These two subspecies, like\r\n_arizonensis_ and the skull in question, have much inflated bullae.\r\nHowever, the immaturity of the specimen conceals any other diagnostic\r\ncranial features, and prevents referring it certainly to either\r\n_neomexicana_ or _latirostra_. In any event the specimen provides no\r\nevidence of intergradation between the two forms last mentioned.\r\nSpeculating on its identity, I should say that it might be either an\r\nintergrade between _arizonensis_ and _nevadensis_, from southern Utah\r\nor northwestern Arizona, or a member of an unnamed race resident in the\r\nlower part of the valley of the Colorado River.\r\n\r\nWhereas _M. f. panamensis_ and _M. f. aureoventris_ are the\r\ndarkest-colored weasels and occur in regions of heavy rainfall, _M. f.\r\nneomexicana_ is the lightest-colored American weasel and occurs in an\r\nextremely arid region where the rainfall and humidity are slight.\r\n\r\nAccording to Barber and Cockerell (1898:189) \"The type specimen was\r\nshot in the grass on the shore of Armstrong's Lake. . . .\" Bailey\r\n(1928:97) found the tracks of one of these animals \"in the great pit at\r\nthe west entrance to\" Carlsbad Cavern and supposes they \"hunt the cave\r\nwalls for mice and other small game.\" Data on the label attached to no.\r\n230973 states that the specimen was taken, two miles west of Willcox,\r\nArizona, in a prairie dog town.\r\n\r\nOnly two of the 23 skulls show evidence of infestation of the frontal\r\nsinuses by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 28, arranged alphabetically\r\n     by states and from north to south by counties in each state.\r\n     Unless otherwise indicated specimens are in the United States\r\n     National Museum.\r\n\r\n     =Arizona.= _Graham County_: Safford, 1. _Cochise County_: 2 mi.

P. Attwater, appears to have been the first one of these\r\nanimals to find its way into the collection of any museum or\r\nnaturalist. The second specimen from Kerr County was secured by, or\r\nthrough, the well-known commercial collector, F. B. Armstrong. Two\r\ntrade skins, from Kerr County, taken on December 10, 1938, are in the\r\nTexas Cooperative Research Collection, as is also the skeleton of a\r\nyoung animal from Fredericksburg. The two other specimens from McLennan\r\nCounty (both males contrary to the statement of Strecker, 1924:14), owe\r\ntheir preservation to the alertness of John K. Strecker, Curator of the\r\nBaylor University Museum, who has given a complete account of their\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe range of this subspecies is thought to include much of central\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThe preserved parts of the skin of the type specimen show it to have\r\nbeen generally large. The part of the tail preserved measures 226\r\nmillimeters and the skin of the head and neck is correspondingly large.\r\nThe skin alone, no. 427, from near Waco, Texas, has, as now stuffed, a\r\nbody 365 millimeters long. Individuals of this race attain larger size\r\nthan those of any other American member of the subgenus _Mustela_ with\r\nthe possible exception of _Mustela frenata macrophonius_ from Veracruz,\r\nMéxico. In addition to large size, _texensis_ and _macrophonius_ are\r\nanalogous in that each has a small geographic range at the northern end\r\nof an extensive range of its similarly colored southern relative from\r\nwhich it differs mainly in size. Each of the two groups, _goldmani_ and\r\n_macrophonius_ on the one hand and _perotae_, _frenata_ and _texensis_\r\non the other, has relatively uniform color, color pattern and body\r\nproportions over a large region but at its northern extremity develops\r\na \"giant\" population, _M. f. macrophonius_ and _M. f. texensis_,\r\nrespectively. The skull of the type specimen of _M. f. texensis_ is the\r\nlargest one seen of any American weasel. The type specimen of _M. f.\r\nmacrophonius_ has a basilar length that is greater by one-tenth of a\r\nmillimeter but in every other measurement taken the skull of _M. f.\r\ntexensis_ is the larger. Its weight, 8 grams, also shows it to be\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nThe broad, white bands in front of the ears are confluent with the\r\nwhite patch between the eyes on both sides in two specimens and on one\r\nside only in one other specimen. A white patch between the ears is\r\npresent in four specimens. The dark spot at each angle of the mouth is\r\nabsent on both sides in four specimens and on one side only in one\r\nother specimen. Thus out of a possible twelve cases, the broad bands in\r\nfront of the ears are confluent with the spot between the eyes in five\r\ncases. Four of the six specimens have a white spot between the ears.\r\nThe dark spot at each angle of the mouth is present three out of a\r\npossible twelve times.\r\n\r\nThe skull of no. 2017, from five miles north of Waco, is smaller than\r\neither of the two skulls seen from Kerr County and in this respect\r\napproaches _M. f. frenata_. There is no actual evidence of\r\nintergradation with any other subspecies but intergradation probably\r\ndoes take place with _M. f. neomexicana_ and possibly with _M. f.\r\narthuri_ and _M. f. primulina_.\r\n\r\nStrecker (1924:14) remarks that of the two specimens obtained near\r\nWaco, one was taken in a trap baited for mink and the other was shot in\r\na hen house. None of the four skulls had the frontal sinuses infested\r\nwith parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 7, arranged by counties from\r\n     north to south.\r\n\r\n     =Texas.= _McLennan County_: 5 mi.

As compared with _M. f. texensis_ (known only from\r\nmales), the only difference detected is smaller size.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--As Merriam (1896:27) has said: \"In 1813 a Russian\r\nnaturalist, Sevastianoff, gave the name '_Mustela brasiliensis_' to a\r\nweasel brought to St. Petersburg by Capt. A. J. Krusenstern on his\r\nreturn from a voyage around the world. The animal was said to have come\r\nfrom Brazil, but no definite locality was given.\" This name was long\r\napplied by many European naturalists to American weasels which had\r\nwhite facial markings, and several American naturalists adopted the\r\nname. However, Lichtenstein in 1832 applied the name _Mustela frenata_\r\nto the weasels of the vicinity of México City and that name was used\r\nfor bridled weasels from México and the southwestern United States by\r\nmost subsequent German writers and by several Americans. In 1896\r\nMerriam (1896:27) showed that Sevastianoff's _Mustela brasiliensis_,\r\n1813, although probably the same as _Mustela frenata_, was preoccupied\r\nby Gmelin's _Mustela brasiliensis_, 1788, applied to an otter and that\r\nLichtenstein's name must be used as the next available one. Since that\r\ntime, 1896, _frenata_ has been the name applied to the large\r\nbridled-weasels of Texas and the high table land of México south to\r\nMéxico City. It may be added that in 1937 search by the writer among\r\nthe specimens and records at the Russian Academy of Sciences, in\r\nLeningrad, failed to reveal any trace of the type specimen of\r\nSevastianoff's _Mustela brasiliensis_.\r\n\r\nThe geographic range of this subspecies is relatively large and, as\r\nmight therefore be expected, specimens show geographic variation. The\r\nspecimens from Tlalpam, which Merriam (_op. cit._:27) regards as\r\ntopotypes, differ in certain respects from specimens from Texas. The\r\nskull of the adult male \"topotype,\" no. 50826, differs from any other\r\nadult male seen in that the basilar length, the length of the upper\r\ntooth-rows, the orbitonasal length, the ratio of the same to the\r\nbasilar length, the mastoidal breadth, the zygomatic breadth, the depth\r\nof the skull at the posterior margins of the upper molars, and the\r\nlength and breadth of M1, are greater. The height of the tympanic\r\nbullae is less than the average height for these structures in more\r\nnorthern specimens. The specimens from Tlalpam have also larger\r\nexternal measurements than the average of more northern specimens. All\r\nof these features show an approach to the subspecies of more southern\r\ndistribution. On the other hand, the blackish of the head is not more\r\nintense or more extended posteriorly onto the neck than in specimens\r\nfrom Brownsville, Texas. The skin, with skull crushed, no. 767, in the\r\nParis Museum, from 3200 meters elevation near Toluca, does have the\r\nblack color of the head extended 30 millimeters posteriorly to the\r\nears. In this feature, and also in the extensively white face on which\r\nthe white bar in front of each ear connects with the frontal spot, as\r\nwell as with the color of the underparts, the specimen resembles\r\n_leucoparia_. Better material from the western part of the state of\r\nMéxico may show the range of _leucoparia_ to extend eastward almost or\r\nquite to Toluca.\r\n\r\nAn adult male, taken on July 15 at Miquihuana, Tamaulipas, is unique in\r\nseveral respects. The top of its head is black, rather than blackish,\r\nand this color extends posteriorly on the top and sides of the neck\r\nalmost halfway to the shoulders. All of the upper parts are much more\r\ndarkly colored than in other specimens of this race. The least width of\r\nthe color of the underparts is 63 per cent of the greatest width of the\r\ncolor of the upper parts; thus the color of the underparts is\r\nconsiderably more extensive than in any other specimen seen. The\r\nunderparts are more intensely colored than in the average specimen. The\r\nmastoidal breadth is greater than in any other adult male and amounts\r\nto more than the postpalatal length. On available maps the elevation of\r\nMiquihuana is given as 1892 meters (about 6200 feet). Thus the dark\r\ncolors can hardly be ascribed to more tropical conditions than those\r\nunder which animals from Brownsville, Texas, live. Brownsville is only\r\na few feet above sea level and only 235 miles farther north. The\r\ndifference noted, therefore, seems to be of geographic significance.\r\nHowever, there is from Alvarez, San Luis Potosí, approximately 115\r\nmiles south of Miquihuana, a young (nearly subadult) female, no. 21968,\r\nwhich is as light colored as specimens from Brownsville, Texas, or\r\nTlalpam, México. The only distinctive feature of this specimen is the\r\nmuch greater extent of its white facial markings; they are more\r\nextensive even than in the specimen from Miquihuana.\r\n\r\nFinally, the series from Brownsville, Texas, indicates that the animal\r\nthere is smaller than _frenata_ from the vicinity of México (city). The\r\nskull is similarly proportioned except that relative to the basilar\r\nlength the orbitonasal length is more. Several other measurements of\r\nthe skull of the adult male from Tlalpam, as pointed out above, are\r\nactually, although not relatively, greater than in any specimen from\r\nBrownsville. The similarities between specimens from the two\r\nlocalities, Tlalpam and Brownsville, are striking; since the two\r\nlocalities lie at opposite, extreme ends of the range more geographic\r\nvariation would be expected. All that is known of the characters of\r\npopulations from intermediate localities is that the one specimen from\r\nAlvarez shows no peculiarities whereas the one from Miquihuana suggests\r\nthe existence there of a geographic variant.\r\n\r\nNone of the specimens seen shows actual intergradation with _M. f.\r\nneomexicana_ or with _M. f. arthuri_ but it is supposed that frenata\r\nintergrades with each of these subspecies. The difference between\r\n_frenata_ and _arthuri_ is greater than between _frenata_ and\r\n_neomexicana_. Bailey (1905:198) records tracks of a weasel seen just\r\nbelow El Paso which he supposed had been made by a weasel of the\r\n_neomexicana_ type. He also cited the taking of a weasel at Langtry\r\nwhich suggested to him (_op. cit._) \". . . a continuous range from the\r\ncountry of _frenatus_ up the Rio Grande to the type locality of\r\n_neomexicanus_ at Mesilla Valley,\" New Mexico. Other records of\r\noccurrence in Texas cited by Bailey, in addition to those provided by\r\nspecimens examined by the writer, are San Diego, Beeville, and Port\r\nLavaca. The Port Lavaca record is the easternmost one assigned to the\r\nsubspecies _frenata_; possibly specimens from there would be referable\r\nto _arthuri_.\r\n\r\nThe series of thirty-four specimens from Brownsville, Texas, permits\r\nmeasuring the amount of individual and age variation in several\r\nfeatures. For instance, the material is sufficient to show that\r\nexternal measurements of subadults and those that fall in the upper\r\npart of the category designated as \"young\" may be included with the\r\nmeasurements of adults, because the mentioned measurements are not\r\nappreciably greater in adults. The series of skulls, although not\r\nproviding more than six of any one age, shows the range of variation in\r\nsize and proportion of certain parts and enables the student the better\r\nto evaluate cranial characters of nearby races known from only a few\r\nspecimens. For example, not one of the twenty skulls of males from\r\nBrownsville and immediate vicinity is as large as either of the two\r\nspecimens of _texensis_ from Kerr County.\r\n\r\nThe white facial markings vary much in size and shape. In the series of\r\nthirty-four skins from Brownsville the broad white bands in front of\r\nthe ears are confluent with the white patch between the eyes on both\r\nsides in three specimens and on one side only in six other specimens.\r\nThese bands are confluent with the color of the underparts in all but\r\ntwo specimens. In one specimen the connection is lacking on both sides\r\nand in the other on one side only. A white patch between the ears is\r\npresent in two specimens. The dark spot at each angle of the mouth is\r\nabsent on both sides in eleven specimens and absent on one side only in\r\nten others.\r\n\r\nIn six other specimens from parts of Texas north of Brownsville, the\r\nbroad white bands in front of the ears are confluent with the white\r\npatch between the eyes on both sides in one specimen. A white spot\r\nbetween the ears is present in one specimen. The dark spot at each\r\nangle of the mouth is absent on both sides in six specimens and on one\r\nside only in three other specimens.\r\n\r\nIn eleven specimens from México, the broad white bands in front of the\r\nears are confluent with the white spot between the eyes on both sides\r\nin two specimens and on one side only in one other specimen. The white\r\nspot between the ears is present in one specimen. The dark spot at each\r\nangle of the mouth is absent on both sides, in six specimens, and on\r\none side only in one other specimen.\r\n\r\nThus, in 51 specimens the broad bands (one in front of each ear) are\r\nconfluent with the white patch between the eyes in nineteen out of 100\r\ninstances, and not with the color of the underparts in three instances.\r\nA white spot between the ears is present in four specimens. The dark\r\nspot at each angle of the mouth is present 47 out of a possible 98\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nFour juvenal specimens from Brownsville, Texas, with their dates of\r\ncapture and probable age, are as follows: no. 58574, [F], three weeks\r\nold, taken on February 15; no. 17318/24239, [M], four weeks old, taken\r\non March 16; no. 45899, [F], forty days old, taken on May 21; no.\r\n21778/36481, [M], thirty days old, taken on October 20. In the order\r\ngiven, the dates of birth of these four juveniles would be\r\napproximately as follows: January 25, February 15, April 1, and\r\nSeptember 20. The dates of birth of other specimens less than three\r\nmonths old as judged by the stage of development of the skull, and\r\nreckoning backward from the dates of capture, are as follows: April 1,\r\nApril 30, May 25, October 12, and December 21. Thus, young appear to be\r\nbrought forth at Brownsville, Texas, in the fall, winter and spring,\r\nthat is to say from the latter part of September until the latter part\r\nof May.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata frenata_ is either free of the parasites that infest\r\nthe frontal sinuses of most weasels, or withstands their presence\r\nremarkably well, for only one skull shows a definite pathological\r\ncondition of the frontal sinuses.\r\n\r\nAllen (1896:74) quotes H. P. Attwater, with respect to this species in\r\nBexar County, Texas, as follows: \"Not common, but occasionally met\r\nwithin the chaparral and cactus lands, where Wood Rats, Rabbits and\r\nQuail abound.

Tail\r\n     averages 67 per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind foot\r\n     more than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: One adult from Artenkiki, Jalisco, and one subadult from\r\n     Pátzcuaro, Michoacán, measure, respectively, as follows: Total\r\n     length, 412, 400; length of tail, 159, 159; length of hind foot,\r\n     41, 42. Tail averages 64 per cent as long as head and body. Length\r\n     of hind foot equal to or greater than basal length.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes\r\n     are: Total length, 108; length of tail, 47; length of hind foot,\r\n     13.\r\n\r\n     _Mustela frenata leucoparia_ has a greater total length and length\r\n     of tail than either _M. f. frenata_ or _goldmani_. The hind foot\r\n     is longer than that of _frenata_ and approximately the same as in\r\n     _goldmani_. Relative to the body length, the tail averages longer\r\n     than that of _goldmani_ and shorter than that of _frenata_.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata frenata_.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Broad white bands on sides of head, extending\r\n     anterodorsally anterior to each ear, confluent with white spot\r\n     between eyes and with color of underparts; posterior third of each\r\n     upper lip white; remainder of sides and top of head, and neck\r\n     posteriorly to point halfway to shoulders from ears, black; no\r\n     dark spots at angles of mouth; tip of tail black; remainder of\r\n     upper parts Argus Brown; chin white and sometimes also chest, neck\r\n     and medial sides of hind legs; remainder of underparts near (16´)\r\n     Ochraceous-Buff (near (_a_) Ochraceous-Buff in juvenal female),\r\n     which color extends distally over all of each foreleg (except its\r\n     lateral face proximally from about middle of forearm) and on\r\n     medial side of hind leg and over most of upper side of each foot.\r\n     Least width of color of underparts averaging, in eight specimens,\r\n     54 (extremes 44-61) per cent of greatest width of color of upper\r\n     parts; black tip of tail averaging, in four males, 52 (extremes\r\n     38-78) mm. long, thus averaging 25 per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     As compared with _M. f. frenata_ and _goldmani_: white facial\r\n     markings more extensive; color of underparts less restricted and\r\n     more extended on legs; black tip of tail relatively of about same\r\n     extent as in _frenata_ and thus much less than in _goldmani_;\r\n     black color of head extending farther posteriorly than in\r\n     _frenata_ but not so far as in _goldmani_.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (adult): See measurements and plates\r\n     24-26, 29, 30. As described in _Mustela frenata frenata_ except\r\n     that: Weight (no. 128972) 6.3 grams; basilar length, 51.2;\r\n     interorbital breadth less than distance between foramen opticum\r\n     and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 4 or 5 upper\r\n     incisors; height of tympanic bulla more or less than (about equal\r\n     to) distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale; anterior\r\n     margin of masseteric fossa anywhere from slightly anterior, to\r\n     slightly posterior, to m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on no. 26153): See measurements and plates 37-39. As\r\n     described in _Mustela frenata frenata_ except that: Weight, 3.6\r\n     grams; basilar length, 44.5; zygomatic breadth less than distance\r\n     between condylar foramen and M1, or than between anterior palatine\r\n     foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; tympanic bulla as\r\n     far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 4 or 5 upper incisors;\r\n     height of tympanic bulla not more than distance from its anterior\r\n     margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length\r\n     of lower molar and premolar tooth-row or than length of rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female is 43 per cent lighter than that of the\r\n     male.\r\n\r\nComparison of the skull with those of _M. f. perotae_, _goldmani_ and\r\n_neomexicana_ has been made in the accounts of those subspecies. As\r\ncompared with that of _frenata_ the main difference is the less\r\ninflated tympanic bulla, the height of which is approximately equal to,\r\nrather than decidedly more than, distance from its anterior margin to\r\nforamen ovale.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The first specimen known to have been preserved is the\r\nalcoholic in the British Museum of Natural History, taken in September,\r\n1891, on the Río Santiago in Jalisco, by D. A. C. Buller. The other\r\nknown specimens of this white-faced weasel are divided between the\r\nAmerican Museum and the United States National Museum. The two referred\r\nspecimens from Jalisco were the last of several helpful ones collected\r\nin México and Central America by J. H. Batty, and these two were taken\r\nless than three months before Batty's tragic death in Chiapas (see\r\nAllen, J. A., 1906:191). The five specimens from Michoacán were taken\r\nby Nelson or Nelson and Goldman together. Merriam had only three of\r\nthese when he named the subspecies and remarked (1896:29) that \"This\r\nform is the poorest subspecies described in the present paper.\"\r\nAlthough the form is not strongly marked, the two additional specimens\r\nfrom Michoacán and better comparative material than Merriam had confirm\r\nseveral of the differential characters ascribed to it by him and\r\nindicate the existence of still other characters.\r\n\r\n_M. f. leucoparia_ occurs in the Sonoran and Transition life-zones. No.\r\n27258 from Los Masos, and no. 26153 from Artenkiki (see specimens\r\nexamined for other spellings) approach true _frenata_ in coloration.\r\nEach of these specimens has a few white hairs between the ears and the\r\nwhite patch between the eyes is confluent on one side only with the\r\nlateral white bands on the side of the head. No. 27258 from Los Masos\r\nhas a dark spot at each angle of the mouth. The 7 other specimens are\r\nrelatively uniform in coloration. Each has the white spot between the\r\neyes confluent on both sides with the extensive white areas on each\r\nside of the face. None has a dark spot at either angle of the mouth. Of\r\nthese 7 specimens, the type specimen and three others have white hairs\r\nforming a median line between the ears and a fifth specimen has a white\r\nspot behind each ear.\r\n\r\n_M. f. leucoparia_ is most like _M. f. frenata_. Unlike _frenata_,\r\n_leucoparia_ has tympanic bullae that are less inflated, narrower and\r\nless projected, at their anterior margins, from the cranium. In these\r\ncharacters _leucoparia_ is intermediate between _M. f. frenata_ and _M.\r\nf. goldmani_. The latter subspecies has the least inflated, narrowest\r\nand least projecting tympanic bullae of the three. The black color of\r\nthe head extends, on the average, farther posteriorly than in _M. f.\r\nfrenata_ but not so far as in _M. f. goldmani_. The general color, too,\r\nis intermediate between that of _M. f. frenata_ and that of the much\r\ndarker _M. f. goldmani_. The white facial markings are more extensive\r\nthan in either _M. f. frenata_ or _M. f. goldmani_. This applies to\r\nboth the white area between the eyes and the one on each side of the\r\nhead between the ear and eye. _M. f. neomexicana_, whose range possibly\r\nmeets that of _M. f. leucoparia_, also has more extensive white facial\r\nmarkings than _M. f. frenata_ but less extensive markings than _M. f.\r\nleucoparia_.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of skulls alone, specimens of _frenata_ from Tlalpam and\r\nthose of _leucoparia_ from Los Reyes can hardly be distinguished. This\r\nfact, and the circumstance that the specimens from the northern part of\r\nthe range of _leucoparia_ closely resemble _frenata_ in color,\r\nconstitute sufficient evidence for regarding the two as only\r\nsubspecifically distinct. The female, no. 26153 from Artenkiki, as\r\nmentioned above, approaches true _frenata_ in coloration. On this\r\naccount it is not to be regarded as typical and it was because no other\r\nskulls of adult females were available that this one was used for\r\ncomparison with females of allied races.\r\n\r\n_M. f. leucoparia_ is, then, a subspecies of the large, temperate-zone\r\ngroup and is unique in possessing the maximum extent of white facial\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nNone of the seven skulls shows signs of having had the frontal sinuses\r\ninfested with parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 8, all from México.\r\n     Localities are listed by states from north to south.

As\r\n     described in _Mustela frenata frenata_ except that: Weight, 4.9\r\n     grams; basilar length, 49.2; postorbital breadth more than\r\n     distance between posterior borders of P4 and P2; tympanic bulla as\r\n     far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 5 upper incisors;\r\n     height of tympanic bulla less than distance from its anterior\r\n     margin to foramen ovale; zygomatic breadth less than distance\r\n     between condylar foramen and M1 or than between anterior palatine\r\n     foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on type specimen, an adult): See measurements and\r\n     plates 37-39. As described in _Mustela frenata frenata_ except\r\n     that: Weight 3.4 grams; basilar length, 43.5; zygomatic breadth\r\n     less than distance between condylar foramen and M1 or than between\r\n     anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     postorbital breadth less than width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 5 or\r\n     6 upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla one-half to\r\n     three-fifths distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale;\r\n     length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar and\r\n     premolar tooth-row and longer than rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female is 33 per cent lighter than that of the\r\n     nontypical (and smaller than average) male from Cerro San Felipe.\r\n\r\nComparison of the skull with that of _M. f. tropicalis_ is made in the\r\naccount of that subspecies. Compared with the skull of _M. f._\r\n_macrophonius_, that of the female of _perotae_ is more flattened, has\r\nthe longitudinal dorsal outline distinctly concave rather than flat\r\njust behind the postorbital processes, and much wider tympanic bullae.\r\nAccordingly, the basioccipital is slightly narrower in _perotae_. The\r\nmore marked postorbital constriction of the type specimen of _perotae_\r\npossibly is due to its relatively greater age. As compared with the\r\nskull of _M. f. leucoparia_, that of the female of _perotae_ has less\r\ninflated tympanic bullae, the height of each being half as great as\r\ndistance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale, whereas, in\r\n_leucoparia_ (as represented by no. 26153) the two distances are equal.\r\nAs compared with that of _M. f. frenata_, the skull of the female of\r\n_perotae_ differs mainly in the lesser inflation of the tympanic bullae\r\nand their relative position. The height of each bulla is in _perotae_\r\nonly half as much as, but in _frenata_ more than, the distance from its\r\nanterior margin to foramen ovale. The anterior margin of the bulla is\r\nmuch less projected from the floor of the braincase in _perotae_. The\r\nsquamosal anterior to each bulla is convex ventrally in _perotae_ but\r\nflat or concave ventrally in _frenata_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The type specimen and a juvenal female from the town of\r\nPerote were taken in the spring of 1893 by E. W. Nelson. Of these two,\r\nthe type specimen was mentioned and figured by Merriam (1898:30, fig.\r\n16 [= fig. 15], pl. 3, fig. 2) as _Putorius frenatus_. The referred\r\nnontypical specimen from Cerro San Felipe, Oaxaca, was referred by\r\nMerriam (op. cit.:29) to _Putorius frenatus goldmani_ with the comment\r\nthat it was intermediate \". . . both in coloration and cranial\r\ncharacters, between typical _frenatus_ and _goldmani_;. . . .\" No other\r\npublished references to this subspecies, or specimens of it, have been\r\nseen. In 1941 and 1942, W. B. Davis and associates took four specimens\r\nalong the boundary between the states of Puebla and México.\r\n\r\nAlthough the specimen from Cerro San Felipe, Oaxaca, is referred to\r\n_Mustela frenata perotae_, to the description of which it answers best,\r\nthat specimen, on account of its structural characters and geographic\r\nposition relative to adjacent races, is in reality an intergrade\r\nbetween several of the adjacent races. Some of its intermediate\r\ncharacters are pointed out in the discussion of _M. f. goldmani_. In\r\nthe specimens from 45 and 55 kilometers ESE of México (city) the black\r\ncolor of the top of the head does not extend so far behind the ears as\r\nin the holotype of _M. f. perotae_ and in this feature the two\r\nspecimens show intergradation between the two subspecies, _perotae_ and\r\n_frenata_.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen taken on May 26, is acquiring new hair on the belly\r\nand lower sides which appears to be the result of a normal molt.\r\n\r\nAs would be expected from its geographic position, _M. f. perotae_\r\nresembles _M. f. frenata_ of northern México and the high mountain\r\nforms of southern México more than it does the lowland tropical forms.\r\nThis is true as regards size of entire animal, proportions of its\r\nparts, and size, general angularity and major proportions of its skull.\r\nThe marked postorbital constriction, convex supralacrymal face of\r\nrostrum, width of tympanic bullae and angularity of the braincase place\r\nit nearest _M. f. frenata_ as does also the color and color pattern.\r\nThe ventrally convex squamosal anterior to each tympanic bulla and the\r\nslight degree of projection from the cranium of the anterior margin of\r\neach tympanic bulla are intermediate in degree between the condition in\r\n_M. f. macrophonius_ and that in _M. f. frenata_. Thus _M. f. perotae_\r\ncombines several characters of _M. f. frenata_ on the one hand with\r\nsome of _M. f. macrophonius_ on the other and in some features, for\r\ninstance in the size, shape and degree of inflation of the tympanic\r\nbullae, presents intermediate stages of development.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern plain below the high mountain, Cofre de Perote, there\r\nranges the similarly colored, smaller, tropical weasel, _Mustela\r\nfrenata tropicalis_. Between _M. f. perotae_ and _M. f. tropicalis_\r\nthere is marked differentiation in the skulls with much less\r\ndifferentiation in coloration. The differences in typical skulls of the\r\ntwo subspecies are so pronounced that one would, at first glance,\r\nhardly believe it possible for direct intergradation to occur between\r\nthem on the sides of this mountain. Merriam (1896:30) thought that it\r\ndid not. The two skulls figured by him (_op. cit._:31) are a topotype\r\nof _M. f. tropicalis_ from Jico and the one which now is the type\r\nspecimen of _M. f. perotae_. They show the great difference in size and\r\nproportions and are females of comparable ages, not of different ages\r\nas I suspected before examining the skulls. However, despite this\r\nmarked difference in the skulls, there is some, although not\r\nconclusive, evidence of intergradation furnished by a young female from\r\nXuchil, Veracruz. This specimen is described in connection with _M. f.\r\ntropicalis_ (see p. 366).\r\n\r\nNone of the seven skulls shows marked deformity of the interorbital\r\nregion, but two of the three adults appear to have had these parts\r\ninfested with nematodes.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 7, all from México, listed by\r\n     localities from north to south.

Mus.,\r\n     Biol. Surv. Coll.; Pinabete, Chiapas, México; February 10, 1896;\r\n     obtained by E. A. Goldman (on attached label collectors recorded\r\n     as Nelson and Goldman); original no. 9279.\r\n\r\n     The skull (plates 24 and 30) has the rostrum badly injured. All\r\n     the right, and part of the left nasal, the upper part of the right\r\n     maxilla, the postorbital process and intervening area of frontals\r\n     are missing. Each zygomatic arch is broken but the parts are\r\n     present and attached to the skull. The frontal and interorbital\r\n     regions are greatly malformed owing to parasites that infested the\r\n     sinuses. Right I2 and I3, right and left i3, and the medial parts\r\n     of the paraconid and protoconid of right m1 are missing. The light\r\n     facial markings are less extensive than in any of the referred\r\n     specimens. These markings consist of a separate spot between the\r\n     eyes and a white line, confluent with the color of the underparts,\r\n     on each side of the head, that extends from the base of the ear to\r\n     above the eye. The dark color of the underparts is represented at\r\n     the angles of the mouth by a spot on the left side and a similar\r\n     dark area, confluent with the dark color of the face, on the right\r\n     side. The large size, characters of the skull, and scrotal pouch\r\n     on the skin prove the specimen to be a male as stated on the\r\n     label.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Two thousand five hundred feet (El Cipres, Guatemala) to\r\n     9500 feet (near Tecpám, Guatemala), Upper Tropical Life-zone of\r\n     mountains and western coasts of southern México, Guatemala and\r\n     Salvador. See figure 29 on page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition_ (characters based on\r\n     males).--Differs from _M. f. nicaraguae_ and _M. f. perda_ by\r\n     larger size (total length of adult males more than 489), least\r\n     width of color of underparts not less than 26 per cent of greatest\r\n     width of color of upper parts, weight of skull of adult male more\r\n     than 5 grams; from _M. f. macrophonius_ by smaller size (total\r\n     length of adult males less than 540), skull of male with basilar\r\n     length less than 52.5 and weight less than 6 grams; from _M. f.\r\n     perotae_ (typical specimens of same sex not available) by darker\r\n     color of upper parts which are Argus Brown or darker rather than\r\n     Brussels Brown; nonextension of color of underparts onto hind\r\n     feet; from _M. f. leucoparia_ in least width of color of\r\n     underparts not more than 37 per cent of greatest width of color of\r\n     upper parts; color of underparts not extended onto hind feet;\r\n     black tip of tail two-fifths rather than one-fourth as long as\r\n     tail-vertebrae; height of tympanic bulla less than four-fifths\r\n     distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Four adults yield average and\r\n     extreme measurements as follows: Total length, 508 (500-512);\r\n     length of tail, 196 (185-207); length of hind foot, 55.5 (54-58).\r\n     Tail averages 63 (59-67) per cent as long as head and body. Length\r\n     of hind foot more than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: Typical specimen unknown.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black and reaching beyond\r\n     ear; carpal vibrissae wholly or in part of same color as upper\r\n     parts and reaching as far as hypothenar pad; hairiness of\r\n     foot-soles distinctly less than that shown in figure 20 on page\r\n     60.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Spot between eyes, band, confluent with color of\r\n     underparts, on each side of head extending anterodorsally anterior\r\n     to each ear and posterior third of each upper lip, white;\r\n     remainder of sides and top of head and neck posteriorly to or\r\n     slightly behind shoulders, black; dark spots at angles of mouth\r\n     usually absent; tip of tail black; remainder of upper parts Argus\r\n     Brown or near (_n_) Argus Brown; chin, throat and breast white;\r\n     remainder of underparts near (16' _c_) Ochraceous-Buff; color of\r\n     underparts extending distally on posterior sides of forelegs onto\r\n     medial toes and on hind legs to points between knees and heels.\r\n     Least width of color of underparts, in five adult males, averaging\r\n     28 (extremes 26-33) per cent of greatest width of color of upper\r\n     parts; black tip of tail, in four adult males, averaging 40 per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on five adults): See measurements\r\n     and plates 24-26, 30; weight, 5.4 (5.3-5.5) grams; basilar length,\r\n     49.9 (49.6-51.3); zygomatic breadth (except in no. 12523 from\r\n     Salvador) more than or equal to distance between condylar foramen\r\n     and M1 or between anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of\r\n     tympanic bulla. Mastoid breadth less than postpalatal length;\r\n     postorbital breadth more or less than length of upper premolars\r\n     and greater than width of basioccipital measured from median\r\n     margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     interorbital breadth less than distance between foramen opticum\r\n     and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum less\r\n     than length of tympanic bulla; least width of palate more or less\r\n     than length of P4; anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far\r\n     posterior to foramen ovale as width of five upper incisors; height\r\n     of tympanic bulla less than distance from its anterior margin to\r\n     foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower\r\n     molar and premolar tooth-row and shorter than or equal to length\r\n     of rostrum; anterior margin of masseteric fossa immediately behind\r\n     m2.\r\n\r\n     Female: Typical skull unknown.\r\n\r\nComparison of male skull with that of _M. f. perda_ made in discussion\r\nof that form. Comparison with that of _M. f. nicaraguae_ shows similar\r\ndifferences, some of which are more pronounced. For example, squamosals\r\nanterior to tympanic bullae more convex ventrally and these bullae\r\nproject less from braincase than in _M. f. perda_; thus the difference\r\nin these features is greater between _goldmani_ and _nicaraguae_ than\r\nbetween _goldmani_ and _perda_.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the skull of the male of _M. f. macrophonius_, each\r\none of the skulls of the adult males of _M. f. goldmani_ is smaller in\r\nevery measurement taken, with two exceptions. The width of the tympanic\r\nbullae was more in three specimens of _M. f. goldmani_ as was also the\r\ndepth of the same in three specimens. Relative to the basilar length\r\nall but two of these measurements average less in _goldmani_; the\r\nexceptions are the zygomatic breadth and depth of the skull at the\r\nanterior margin of the tympanic bullae which average more. Relative to\r\nthe basilar length, the orbitonasal length and depth of the skull at\r\nthe posterior margin of M1 are less in each skull of _goldmani_. Thus,\r\nexcepting the width and height of the tympanic bullae and the relative\r\nzygomatic breadth and relative depth of the braincase posteriorly, the\r\nskull of _goldmani_ is shorter and relatively as well as actually\r\nnarrower and lighter throughout.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the skull of the male of _M. f. leucoparia_, that of\r\n_M. f. goldmani_ averages a trifle shorter and no skull of _goldmani_\r\nequals that of _leucoparia_ in actual or relative zygomatic and mastoid\r\nbreadths or length or height of tympanic bullae. In depth, the skull of\r\n_goldmani_ averages actually and relatively greater. Its teeth are\r\nsmaller. The squamosal anterior to each tympanic bulla is convex\r\nventrally whereas it is concave ventrally in _leucoparia_ as in\r\n_frenata_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--When Merriam (1896:28) named this subspecies, he had only\r\none specimen but he called attention to the more important diagnostic\r\ncharacters, which additional specimens show pertain to the race as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n_M. f. goldmani_ in typical form occurs in high mountains of the Upper\r\nTropical Life-zone and is most closely related to _M. f. frenata_ and\r\n_M. f. macrophonius_. The altitude at which the two specimens were\r\ntaken, twenty miles southeast of Teopisca in Chiapas, is not known.\r\nMerriam (1896:28) states that the type specimen was obtained at \"about\r\n8200 feet.\" The specimen taken by Stirton in Salvador comes from 8000\r\nfeet and the one obtained by Barber in Guatemala from 9500 feet. The\r\nspecimen from Dueñas, the skin alone of a young animal, is not\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nAs regards size, _goldmani_ is larger than the immediately adjacent\r\nsubspecies from the Lower Tropical Life-zone but is smaller than _M. f.\r\nleucoparia_ or _macrophonius_. As compared with _M. f. frenata_,\r\n_goldmani_ is longer, has an actually as well as relatively shorter\r\ntail, and a much longer hind foot.\r\n\r\nThe most outstanding difference in externals from _frenata_ is the\r\nnaked foot soles.\r\n\r\nMolting probably takes place twice each year although actual proof of\r\nthis is lacking. In number 133254 from twenty miles southeast of\r\nTeopisca, taken on May 12, the molt is well advanced. Another specimen\r\nfrom the same place still retains the winter coat.\r\n\r\nIn color, _goldmani_ is much darker than _frenata_, has less extensive\r\nwhite facial markings, longer black tip on tail, more restricted color\r\nof underparts, and lacks the extension of color of the underparts onto\r\nthe hind feet.\r\n\r\nOf the adult males from the high mountains, the type specimen from\r\nChiapas is lightest, and the one from Salvador is darkest. This\r\nprogressively darker color to the southward probably is geographic\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nIn total length and relative and actual length of tail, the specimen\r\nfrom Salvador is the smallest of the five adult males from the higher\r\nmountains. In addition to its darker color and smaller size, no. 12523\r\nfrom Salvador shows certain distinctive cranial characters. The\r\nzygomatic breadth is less than, rather than more than, or equal to, the\r\ndistance between the condylar foramen and M1 or than that between the\r\nanterior palatine foramen and the anterior margin of the tympanic\r\nbulla. This difference appears to be correlated with geographic\r\nposition, since no. 15953 from Guatemala has the three distances about\r\nequal and therefore is intermediate in this respect between the\r\nspecimen from Salvador and those from Chiapas, in which the zygomatic\r\nbreadth is greater than the other two measurements. Also in the greater\r\ndepth of the skull and smaller size of the teeth, this specimen from\r\nSalvador approaches the subspecies of the Lower Tropical Life-zone. It\r\nhas, however, the longest, highest and widest tympanic bullae of any of\r\nthe five specimens. The amount of ventral convexity of the squamosal in\r\nfront of each tympanic bulla appears not to be greater than in the\r\nother specimens.\r\n\r\nAs indicative of intergradation with _perotae_, _leucoparia_ and\r\npossibly _frenata_, there is the specimen from Cerro San Felipe,\r\nOaxaca. The degree of restriction of the color of the underparts is\r\nintermediate between that of _goldmani_ and _leucoparia_. The same is\r\ntrue as regards the amount of projection from the braincase of the\r\nanterior margins of the tympanic bullae. The squamosal immediately\r\nanterior to each tympanic bulla is flat instead of ventrally convex as\r\nin _goldmani_ or ventrally concave as in _leucoparia_ and _frenata_. In\r\naccordance with the custom adopted in this paper of referring every\r\nspecimen to some one subspecies, this specimen from Cerro San Felipe is\r\nreferred to _Mustela frenata perotae_, to the description of which it\r\nmost nearly answers.\r\n\r\nPossibly _goldmani_, as here constituted, is a composite form. The\r\nspecimens from the high mountains closely resemble one another.\r\nHowever, a specimen, no. 68541 from \"Finca El Cipres,\" Guatemala, which\r\nplace Mr. G. Goodwin tells me is at an elevation of 2500 feet,\r\napproximately 5 miles north of Retalhuleu, has a basilar length of 47.3\r\nand is correspondingly small in other parts. This suggests the\r\nexistence of a small, lowland race on the western side of the central\r\ndivide corresponding to _perda_ and _tropicalis_ on the eastern side.\r\nFrom only a few miles away, at San Sebastian, there is available, the\r\nadult skull of a still smaller animal. This skull only, no. 41026, in\r\nthe Berlin Zoological Museum, has a basilar length of 46.1, zygomatic\r\nbreadth of 27.4, and other cranial measurements notably smaller than\r\nthose of specimens from the high mountains. A skin-only, no. 12038,\r\ncollection of Donald R. Dickey, from La Cebia, altitude 2150 feet, near\r\nthe city of San Salvador, seemingly represents an animal smaller than\r\ntypical _goldmani_. This specimen from La Cebia has the light color of\r\nthe underparts extended distally on the hind legs to the tips of the\r\ntoes as in _M. f. tropicalis_. However, the upper parts are darker and\r\nresemble those of _M. f. goldmani_. A fourth specimen from only 3500\r\nfeet elevation, on the south side of Volcano Tajumulco, Guatemala, no.\r\n41768, Field Museum of Natural History, a subadult male, measures only\r\n490 in total length and has the least color of the underparts so\r\nrestricted as to amount to only 22 per cent of the greatest width of\r\nthe color of the upper parts. Both these features are suggestive of the\r\nlowland races.\r\n\r\nThese four specimens indicate that the lowland population on the\r\nwestern side of the divide is smaller than the mountain population. The\r\njuvenile from Carolina and a young male from Finca Cipres, however,\r\nboth closely resemble individuals of _goldmani_ from the higher\r\nmountains. All these animals here are referred to _goldmani_. More\r\nspecimens may reveal an amount and a pattern of geographic variation in\r\nweasels of this region that will require application of another\r\nsubspecific name.\r\n\r\nThe female, no. 68540, from Puebla agrees remarkably well with the\r\nskull of the female, no. 132528, of _macrophonius_. Differences\r\ndisplayed by the specimen from Puebla are its slightly narrower\r\nbraincase and longer space between the foramen ovale and anterior end\r\nof the tympanic bulla. Considering the far eastern location of Puebla\r\n(just north of Río Motagua, at 89° W, according to a sketch map\r\nprovided by Mr. G. G. Goodwin), this specimen might be expected to show\r\nsome approach to the small lowland races. Actually, however, it\r\ndisplays the characters of _goldmani_ better than does the subadult\r\nfemale from Volcano San Lucas, which is nearer the metropolis of\r\n_goldmani_, and I assume at a higher elevation than Puebla.\r\n\r\nConcerning this weasel Merriam (1896:29) says: \"Mr. E. W. Nelson writes\r\nme that this fine weasel is found sparingly in the forest about\r\nPinabete, Chiapas, at an altitude of 7000 to 8000 feet (2100 to 2500\r\nmeters). The type specimen was shot in the afternoon while hunting on a\r\nheavily wooded hill slope. It was heard making long, slow leaps over\r\nthe dry, crisp leaves. Coming to a log, it stood up and rested its fore\r\nfeet on the log, in which position it was shot by Mr. Goldman.\"\r\n\r\nThe specimen taken by R. A. Stirton in Salvador comes from an elevation\r\nof 8000 feet in the rain forest of the Upper Tropical Life-zone. Mr.\r\nStirton tells me that one morning on visiting his traps set for small\r\nrodents, he found in one the partly eaten remains of a _Heteromys_.\r\nLeaving these remains as found he placed a steel trap beside them and\r\non the following morning found the male weasel in the trap.\r\n\r\nAt least three of the ten specimens had the frontal sinuses infested\r\nwith parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 15, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south, and unless otherwise indicated in the American\r\n     Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n     =México=: _Chiapas_: 20 mi.

Tail 70 per cent as long as body; length\r\n     of hind foot more than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: The skin, without field collector's measurements, of an\r\n     adult female from Pérez, Veracruz, shows this sex to be\r\n     correspondingly large. Because the skin is understuffed and\r\n     because the hind feet are skinned out, reliable measurements can\r\n     not be obtained from the dried skin.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata goldmani_ except\r\n     that all carpal vibrissae are of same color as upper parts and\r\n     that hairiness of foot-soles is halfway between that shown in\r\n     figures 20 and 21.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As in darkest individuals of _M. f. goldmani_, thus,\r\n     color of upper parts on posterior part of back near (_n_) Argus\r\n     Brown. Color of underparts near (12) Mikado Orange in a juvenile,\r\n     extending distally on posterior sides of forelegs onto inner toes\r\n     and on hind legs to points between knees and heels. Least width of\r\n     color of underparts 28 per cent of greatest width of color of\r\n     upper parts. Black tip of tail 34 per cent of length of\r\n     tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on type specimen): See\r\n     measurements and plates 24-26, 30. As described in _Mustela\r\n     frenata frenata_ except that: Weight, 6.9 grams; basilar length,\r\n     54.1; zygomatic breadth less than distance between condylar\r\n     foramen and M1 or that between anterior palatine foramen and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla; interorbital breadth less than\r\n     distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin of tympanic\r\n     bulla; anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to\r\n     foramen ovale as width of 4 to 6 upper incisors; height of\r\n     tympanic bulla less than distance from its anterior margin to\r\n     foramen ovale; anterior margin of masseteric fossa below posterior\r\n     half of m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on no. 132528): See measurements and plates 37-39.\r\n     As described in _Mustela frenata frenata_ except that: Weight, 3.6\r\n     grams; basilar length, 43.5; zygomatic breadth less than distance\r\n     between condylar foramen and M1 and more or less than (in the\r\n     single specimen, equal to) that between anterior palatine foramen\r\n     and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; least width of palate more\r\n     or less than (about equal to) outside length of P4; tympanic bulla\r\n     as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 4 or 5 upper\r\n     incisors; height of tympanic bulla less than distance from its\r\n     anterior margin to foramen ovale.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female is 48 per cent lighter than that of the\r\n     male.\r\n\r\nComparison of the skull with that of _M. f. goldmani_ is made in the\r\naccount of that subspecies. Similar differences probably exist between\r\nmales of _perotae_ and _macrophonius_. As compared with skulls of males\r\nof _M. f. tropicalis_ and _perda_, the skull of the male of\r\n_macrophonius_ is larger in every measurement taken. The postorbital\r\nconstriction is less, rather than more, than the combined length of the\r\nupper premolars. Relative to the basilar length, the following\r\nmeasurements are less than in any specimen of _tropicalis_ or _perda_:\r\nlength of tooth-rows; orbitonasal length; depth of skull at posterior\r\nborder of upper molars; and depth of skull at anterior margin of\r\nbasioccipital.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This large weasel appears to have escaped the notice of\r\nnaturalists until the spring of 1903 when J. Friesser obtained an adult\r\nfemale and juvenal male at Pérez for the collection of the United\r\nStates Bureau of Biological Survey. These specimens were tentatively\r\nreferred to _Mustela tropicalis_. In the following January, Edmund\r\nHeller and Charles M. Barber obtained the adult male that was made the\r\ntype specimen by Elliot who did not see, or if he did, did not mention,\r\nthe specimens from Pérez. He did, however, refer a young female from\r\nXuchil, Veracruz, to his _Putorius macrophonius_. This young female is\r\nhere referred to _Mustela frenata tropicalis_.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the geographic range of this subspecies is not well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata macrophonius_ and _M. f. texensis_ are the largest\r\nAmerican weasels. The basilar length in the type specimen is greater by\r\none-tenth of a millimeter than in the type specimen of _M. f.\r\ntexensis_. The other cranial measurements taken are greater in _M. f.\r\ntexensis_. The skull of the female from Pérez is one of the largest\r\nskulls examined of that sex. The juvenal male has teeth as large as\r\nthose of the type specimen and the skull is the largest for its age of\r\nany seen. Although the skin of the female is understuffed and hence\r\ndoes not provide reliable measurements, it shows that the female is\r\nalso large.\r\n\r\nThe white bands in front of the ears are confluent with the white patch\r\nbetween the eyes on one side only in one specimen. It is the juvenal\r\nmale. These bands are not confluent with the color of the underparts\r\non either side in the female and on one side only in the adult male.\r\nNone of the specimens has a white patch between the ears. The dark spot\r\nat each angle of the mouth is present only in the juvenile where it\r\noccurs on each side. Of the three specimens, the juvenile is the\r\ndarkest and the adult male the lightest. The white facial markings are\r\nmost extensive in the juvenal male and the least extensive in the adult\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\n_M. f. macrophonius_ most closely resembles _M. f. goldmani_ but in the\r\nrelatively flattened braincase, deep constriction of the postorbital\r\nregion and general angularity of the skull approaches _M. f. perotae_\r\nand _M. f. frenata_.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the three skulls, that of the female, shows evidence of\r\ninfestation of the frontal sinuses by parasites, and this did not\r\nresult in malformation of the interorbital region.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 3, all from México, listed by\r\n     localities from north to south.\r\n\r\n     =Veracruz.= Achotal, 1 (Field Mus.

The tail is 65 and 57 per\r\n     cent as long as the head and body. The hind foot is more or less\r\n     than (approximately equal to) the basilar length.\r\n\r\n     Female: Merriam (1896:31) gives the measurements of a female\r\n     topotype (probably no. 54993, U. S. Nat. Mus., which has no\r\n     measurements written on the attached label) as: Total length, 333;\r\n     length of tail, 121; length of hind foot, 37. The length of the\r\n     tail amounts to 57 per cent of the length of the body. The length\r\n     of the hind foot of no. 54993, U. S. Nat. Mus. is the same as the\r\n     basal length.\r\n\r\n     The differences in external measurements between the male and the\r\n     female topotypes are: Total length, 111; length of tail, 54;\r\n     length of hind foot, 13.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata frenata_ except\r\n     that carpal vibrissae do not reach apical pad of fifth digit and\r\n     hairiness of foot soles is less.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _M. f. frenata_ except that: Blackish of\r\n     head extends half way or more from ears to shoulders; upper parts\r\n     near (14) Brussels Brown or slightly faded tone 2 of Maroon of\r\n     Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl. 341; underparts of juvenal pelage near\r\n     (_a_) Ochraceous-Buff. Least width of color of underparts\r\n     averaging (in three specimens from Jico and one from Jalapa) 34\r\n     (extremes 30-37) per cent of greatest width of color of\r\n     underparts. Black tip of tail, in two male topotypes, 57.5 (55 and\r\n     60) mm. long; thus longer than hind foot and in each individual\r\n     comprising 34 per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     As compared with _M. f. frenata_: White facial markings slightly\r\n     less extensive; blackish (not black) of head extending onto neck;\r\n     upper parts slightly darker; ventral side of tail noticeably\r\n     darker; color of underparts more restricted, averaging\r\n     approximately one-third rather than nearly one-half width color of\r\n     upper parts; black tip of tail one-third rather than one-fourth\r\n     length of tail and much longer than hind foot. Similar differences\r\n     of lesser amount exist between _perotae_ and _tropicalis_. _M. f.\r\n     perda_, _macrophonius_ and _goldmani_ bear the opposite relation\r\n     to _tropicalis_. That is to say, in the latter: White facial\r\n     markings slightly more extensive; blackish of head less extended\r\n     over neck; upper parts markedly lighter; color of underparts less\r\n     restricted and black tip of tail shorter.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on type specimen and a subadult,\r\n     no. 11058, from Jalapa): See measurements and plates 25-27, 30. As\r\n     described in _Mustela frenata perda_ except that: Weight 4.7 (4.6\r\n     and 4.7) grams; basilar length 46.7 (45.5 and 47.8); zygomatic\r\n     breadth more or less than distance between condylar foramen and M1\r\n     or than between anterior palatine foramen and anterior margin of\r\n     tympanic bulla; least width of palate more than length of P4;\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen\r\n     ovale as width of 4 (including I3) upper incisors; anterior margin\r\n     of masseteric fossa below middle of m2 or posterior to that tooth.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on no. 54993 and no. 1060): See measurements and\r\n     plates 37-39. As described in _Mustela frenata perda_ except that:\r\n     Weight (of 54993) 2.2 grams; basilar length, 37.5 (36.0-39.0);\r\n     zygomatic breadth more or less than distance between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; least\r\n     width of palate more than greatest length of P4; height of\r\n     tympanic bulla equal to one-third to three-fourths of distance\r\n     from its anterior margin to foramen ovale.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the adult female is 53 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the type specimen, a male.\r\n\r\nComparison of the skulls of males and females with those of _M. f.\r\nperda_, the nearest relative, has been made in the discussion of that\r\nsubspecies. Some of the features that readily distinguish skulls of _M.\r\nf. tropicalis_ from those of _M. f. frenata_, _perotae_ and\r\n_macrophonius_ are as follows: Weight less than 4.8 grams; basilar\r\nlength less than 48; postorbital breadth more than length of upper M-Pm\r\ntooth-row. The skulls of male _frenata_, _perotae_ and _macrophonius_\r\nare much larger, heavier, and are decidedly more angular with more\r\nconstricted postorbital region the least width of which is less than\r\nthe length of the upper premolars. In _frenata_ the anterior margins of\r\nthe tympanic bullae are protruded much farther from the braincase. The\r\nskull of the female of _M. f. tropicalis_ is smaller, weighing less\r\nthan 3 grams; basilar length less than 41; postorbital breadth more\r\nthan length of upper molar and premolar tooth-row.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This subspecies was originally described by Merriam as a\r\nfull species. Later he described _Putorius tropicalis perdus_ as\r\nanother subspecies. Allen (1916) placed _P. t. perdus_ in synonymy but\r\nnamed _Mustela tropicalis nicaraguae_ as new. In the present paper all\r\nthree forms are recognized but are regarded as only subspecifically\r\ndistinct from the other bridled weasels of México and Central America.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the geographic range of _tropicalis_ are fairly well\r\nknown on the south and west but the only specimen available from the\r\ntropical coastal region north of Jico, is a young female from a point\r\n50 miles south of Victoria. Thus, how far north along the coast it\r\nranges toward Matamoros, where _M. f. frenata_ occurs, is not known.\r\nThe three specimens from Jico, a young female from Jalapa and another\r\nadult collected by J. Potts and labeled as coming from México City, are\r\nassumed to be typical. The latter specimen certainly came from an\r\nelevation lower than that of México City because _M. f. frenata_ occurs\r\nthere. Although the female from Jalapa, agrees well with specimens from\r\nJico, a male, no. 12764/11058, from Jalapa, has a relatively broader\r\nskull, as in _perda_, although the tympanic bullae are short as in\r\n_tropicalis_. The resemblances to _perda_ in features of coloration\r\nare: slightly darker upper parts, and the termination just below the\r\nknees of the color of the underparts. There are three specimens labeled\r\nas from Orizaba that indicate intergradation with _perotae_ as does\r\nalso the coloration of the juvenal female from 5 kilometers north of\r\nJalapa. The specimens labeled as from Orizaba are old, poorly-prepared\r\nskins, only two of which have partial skulls. The size and coloration\r\nof the skins suggest _perotae_ as do also the partial skulls in some\r\nrespects although the skulls show greater resemblance to those of\r\n_tropicalis_.\r\n\r\nThe topotype, female, no. 54993, was figured by Merriam (1896, fig. 16,\r\np. 31) along with that of what now is the type specimen of _M. f.\r\nperotae_. Merriam called attention to the great difference in size\r\nbetween the skulls of the two sexes of _M. f. tropicalis_ and compared\r\nthe condition to that found in _noveboracensis_. Although the skull of\r\nthe female from Jico is fully adult, it probably is exceptionally\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe young female from Xuchil is indistinguishable in coloration from\r\nthe juvenal female of _M. f. perotae_ from Perote, but in size of skull\r\nand size of teeth is intermediate between the female of tropicalis from\r\nJalapa and the females from Cofre de Perote.\r\n\r\nThere is then, indication of intergradation with _M. f. perotae_ as\r\nwell as with _M. f. perda_. _M. f. tropicalis_ differs from _M. f.\r\nperotae_ and _M. f. frenata_ in about the same way that _M. f. perda_\r\ndiffers from _M. f. goldmani_ and _M. f. macrophonius_. _M. f.\r\ntropicalis_ and _perda_ each is smaller and more intensely colored than\r\n_goldmani_ and _macrophonius_, and inhabits the lowland to the east of\r\ntheir highland relative.\r\n\r\nAt least five of the nine skulls have the frontal sinuses infested by\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 13, all from México, listed\r\n     by localities from north to south.

Least width of\r\n     color of underparts, in four specimens, averaging 20 (extremes\r\n     18-22) per cent of greatest width of color of upper parts; black\r\n     tip of tail, in two subadult males, averaging 48 (extremes 46-49)\r\n     per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on type specimen and subadult no.\r\n     132997 from San Vicente): See measurements and plates 25-27, 30;\r\n     weight 4.4 grams (same for each); basilar length 45.7 (45.3 and\r\n     46.1); zygomatic breadth less than distance between condylar\r\n     foramen and M1 or than between anterior palatine foramen and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth less than\r\n     postpalatal length; postorbital breadth more or less than\r\n     (approximately equal to) length of upper premolars and greater\r\n     than width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one\r\n     foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; interorbital breadth\r\n     less than distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin of\r\n     tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum not greater than length of\r\n     tympanic bulla; least width of palate less than length of P4;\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen\r\n     ovale as width of 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 upper incisors; height of\r\n     tympanic bulla less than distance from its anterior margin to\r\n     foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower\r\n     molar and premolar tooth-row and longer or shorter than rostrum;\r\n     anterior margin of masseteric fossa below middle of m2.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on two subadults, nos. 65422 and 218036): See\r\n     measurements and plates 36-39; weight, 2.4 (2.3-2.5) grams;\r\n     basilar length, 40.5 (40.4-40.6); zygomatic breadth less than\r\n     distance between condylar foramen and M1 or than between anterior\r\n     palatine foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla;\r\n     postorbital breadth more than length of upper premolars or than\r\n     width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of one foramen\r\n     lacerum posterior to its opposite; least width of palate more than\r\n     outside length of P4 and less than inside length of same; anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as\r\n     width of 5 or 6 upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla equal to\r\n     one-third to one-half distance from its anterior margin to foramen\r\n     ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar\r\n     and premolar tooth-row and more or less than (about equal to)\r\n     length of rostrum.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female averages 48 per cent lighter than that of\r\n     the male.\r\n\r\nComparison of the skull of the male with that of _M. f. nicaraguae_ has\r\nbeen made in the account of that subspecies. The skull of the male as\r\ncompared with that of _M. f. tropicalis_ has shorter tympanic bullae,\r\ndeeper braincase at anterior margin of basioccipital, lesser zygomatic\r\nand palatal breadth and smaller P4 and m1. The skull of the female is\r\nlarger in every measurement taken except those reflecting width of the\r\npreorbital portion. This part is actually narrower but probably mainly\r\nbecause the females of _perda_ are younger than those of _tropicalis_.\r\nFeatures in which three skulls of subadults of _M. f. perda_ differ\r\nfrom the five adults of _M. f. goldmani_ and show no overlap are:\r\nlesser basilar length, lesser weight, greater relative length of upper\r\ntooth-rows, greater relative width of rostrum, greater relative length\r\nof rostrum, lesser mastoid and zygomatic breadths, lesser width, length\r\nand height of tympanic bullae; lesser outside length of P4 and greater\r\nrelative depth of braincase at anterior margin of basioccipital and at\r\nposterior margin of M1. Features in which _perda_ averages less are:\r\nlength of tooth-rows, interorbital breadth, orbitonasal length,\r\nrelative zygomatic breadth, length of m1, outside and inside lengths of\r\nP4, width and length of M1, and depth of skull at posterior margin of\r\nM1. Features in which _perda_ averages more than _goldmani_ are:\r\nrelative interorbital breadth, relative mastoid breadth and depth of\r\nskull at anterior margin of basioccipital. The length of the inner\r\nhalf of M1 averages the same. As compared with _goldmani_, the skull of\r\nthe male of _perda_ is shorter, otherwise generally smaller, but\r\nrelatively broader except across the zygomatic arches, and relatively\r\ndeeper. The anterior margins of the tympanic bullae project slightly\r\nless from the braincase and the squamosals immediately in front of\r\nthese bullae are slightly more convex ventrally.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Described by Merriam in 1902 as a subspecies of _Putorius\r\ntropicalis_, the form _perda_ was regarded by Allen (1916:99) as not\r\nsubspecifically distinct from _P. t. tropicalis_.\r\n\r\nThis is the eastern, lowland subspecies of the Tropical Life-zone,\r\ncorresponding to _M. f. goldmani_ of the higher mountains just as _M.\r\nf. tropicalis_ corresponds to _M. f. frenata_ and _perotae_ of the high\r\nmountains and table land. The difference in size between _perda_ and\r\n_nicaraguae_ and between _perda_ and _tropicalis_ is slight. _M. f.\r\nperda_ is slightly less richly colored than _M. f. nicaraguae_ but has\r\nthe color of the underparts more restricted and has a longer black tip\r\non the tail. In these respects it is second only to _M. f. panamensis_\r\namong Central American weasels. Evidence of intergradation with\r\n_goldmani_ is furnished by the specimens from Cobán, Guatemala, and the\r\nnearby locality San Cristóbal in Verapaz, Guatemala. Reduced size as\r\ncompared with _goldmani_ suggests affinity with _perda_ but the greater\r\nwidth of the light-colored underparts, which averages 24 (extremes\r\n18-32) per cent of the greatest width of the color of the upper parts,\r\nshows approach to _goldmani_. Farther north, in Chiapas, however,\r\nspecimens of _perda_ from San Cristóbal and San Vicente are readily\r\ndistinguishable from those of _goldmani_ taken a few miles away at\r\nPinabete and near Teopisca. The latter two localities are, however,\r\nseveral thousand feet higher than San Cristóbal (Chiapas) and San\r\nVicente.\r\n\r\nTwo of the nine skulls (only 3 adult) examined for malformation of the\r\nfrontal sinuses reveal infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 18, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south, and unless otherwise indicated in the United\r\n     States National Museum.\r\n\r\n     =Veracruz.= Catemaco, 1.\r\n\r\n     =Tabasco.= Teapa, 2 (1[7]).\r\n\r\n     =Chiapas.= San Cristóbal, 1; San Vicente, 1; no locality more\r\n     definite than state, 1.\r\n\r\n     =Yucatán.= Chichén-Itzá, 1[76].\r\n\r\n     =Guatemala=: Cobán, 2 (1[7], 1[4]); Finca la Providenci, S.\r\n     Cristóbal, Verapaz, 3[76]; central Guatemala, 1; no locality more\r\n     definite than Guatemala, 5 (2[7]).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela frenata nicaraguae= Allen\r\n\r\nLong-tailed Weasel\r\n\r\nPlates 1, 25, 26, 27 and 30\r\n\r\n    _Mustela tropicalis nicaraguae_ Allen, Bull.

The teeth all are\r\n     present and unbroken. The skin is complete and unfaded but only\r\n     partly stuffed.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Honduras and Nicaragua. Altitudinal and zonal limits\r\n     unknown. See figure 29 on page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _M. f.\r\n     costaricensis_ and _M. f. goldmani_ in shorter black tip of tail\r\n     (not more than 35 per cent of length of tail) and lesser width\r\n     (usually not more than 7 mm.) of tympanic bulla; from _M. f.\r\n     perda_ in greater extent of color of underparts (22 or more per\r\n     cent of greatest width of color of upper parts), shorter black tip\r\n     on tail (not more than 35 per cent as long as tail) and narrower\r\n     skull, the mastoid breadth in adult males being less than 23.9 and\r\n     the zygomatic breadth less than 27.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: Average and extreme measurements of\r\n     five subadults and one young (four from Matagalpa and one from San\r\n     Rafel del Norte) are: Total length, 450 (420-480); length of tail,\r\n     178 (150-190); length of hind foot, 48 (46-50). Tail averages 65\r\n     (extremes 56-69) per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind\r\n     foot (measurements from dried skins) more than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female: Measurements unrecorded.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata goldmani_, except\r\n     that hairiness of foot soles (between that shown in figures 20 and\r\n     21) is less, slightly less even than in _M. f. perda_.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela frenata goldmani_ except that:\r\n     Back near (_n_) Argus Brown, or Carbon Brown, tone 4 of Oberthür\r\n     and Dauthenay, pl. 342. Underparts Ochraceous-Buff. Least width of\r\n     color of underparts, in four males, young, subadult and adult, 24\r\n     (extremes 22-26) per cent of greatest width of color of upper\r\n     parts; the corresponding per cent in one female is 32; black tip\r\n     of tail, in two subadult males, averaging 29 (extremes, 28-30) per\r\n     cent of length of tail-vertebrae; corresponding per cent in one\r\n     female, 36.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on type specimen, one adult\r\n     topotype [?] and one subadult from San Rafel del Norte): See\r\n     measurements and plates 25-27, 30. As described in _Mustela\r\n     frenata perda_ except that: Weight, 4.2 grams (estimated for\r\n     adults); basilar length 45.0 (44.8-45.5); interorbital breadth\r\n     more or less than distance between foramen opticum and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; anterior margin of tympanic bulla as far\r\n     posterior to foramen ovale as width of four to five upper\r\n     incisors; length of tympanic bulla not less than length of lower\r\n     molar and premolar tooth-row; anterior margin of masseteric fossa\r\n     below anterior margin of m2 or posterior to that tooth.\r\n\r\n     Female: Skull unknown.\r\n\r\nComparison of the skull of the male with that of _M. f. costaricensis_\r\nis made in the account of that subspecies. As compared with that of _M.\r\nf. perda_, which it most closely resembles, the skull of the male has a\r\nnarrower, shorter rostrum, lesser interorbital breadth, lesser mastoid\r\nand zygomatic breadths and slightly shallower braincase, measured at\r\nanterior margin of basioccipital. The tympanic bullae are slightly less\r\nprojected, at their anterior margins, from the braincase and the\r\nsquamosal, directly anterior to each, is a little more convex\r\nventrally. The skull of _M. f. nicaraguae_ is, then, slightly shorter\r\nthan that of _M. f. perda_ and relatively narrower.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--When naming this form, Allen (1916:100) characterized it as\r\n\"Similar to _M. tropicalis tropicalis_ but general coloration much\r\ndarker and the white face markings somewhat reduced in area.\" In the\r\nsentence preceding the one quoted, _Putorius tropicalis perdus_ was\r\nplaced as a synonym of _Putorius tropicalis tropicalis_. _M. f.\r\nnicaraguae_ and _M. f. perda_ are nearly alike in color and color\r\npattern but differ in cranial characters. _M. f. perda_ and _M. f.\r\ntropicalis_ are widely different in color and more especially in color\r\npattern but differ only slightly in cranial characters. The aggregate\r\ndifference between _perda_ and _nicaraguae_ is less than that between\r\n_perda_ and _tropicalis_. All three are lowland forms and each is\r\nsmaller than the adjacent highland forms, namely, _M. f. goldmani_,\r\n_macrophonius_, _perotae_ and _frenata_.\r\n\r\nThe weasels from Honduras definitely are not typical of _nicaraguae_ as\r\nit is known from the specimens from Nicaragua itself. The specimens\r\nfrom the state of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, are larger. Some are darker\r\nthan topotypical _nicaraguae_. The dorsal outline of the skull is more\r\nnearly flat (less convex) in some. In these and several other\r\ndifferential features studied, the average of specimens from\r\nTegucigalpa is intermediate toward _goldmani_, but everything\r\nconsidered the animals seem best placed with _nicaraguae_ rather than\r\nwith _goldmani_ or _perda_, to which latter also, they show some\r\nresemblance. With better material from Nicaragua and additional\r\nspecimens from Salvador (here referred to _goldmani_) a restudy of all\r\nthe material now referred to the three races named would be profitable.\r\nAims of this restudy might be to determine if a highland race\r\nadditional to _goldmani_ should be recognized and if the lowland races\r\n_perda_ and _nicaraguae_ differ from one another in the way that the\r\nexisting specimens indicate.\r\n\r\nIn the five males from Matagalpa, the narrow white band in front of\r\neach ear is confluent with the color of the underparts on one side only\r\nin one specimen and on both sides in two specimens. None of these bands\r\nis confluent with the white patch between the eyes. A dark spot at the\r\nangle of the mouth is present on one side in one specimen. The\r\ncorresponding area is dark colored in all other specimens but not\r\nseparated from the color of the upper parts. In the specimen from San\r\nRafel del Norte the white bands are not confluent with the color of the\r\nunderparts. The female from Mambacho has the mentioned bands confluent\r\nwith the color of the underparts. This female approaches _M. f.\r\ncostaricensis_ in the dark color of the upper parts but has more\r\nextensive white facial markings than some specimens from much farther\r\nnorth. Like a female seen of _M. f. costaricensis_, this one has a\r\n\"frosted\" nape but the white hairs on the back of the neck are less\r\nnumerous than in the female of _M. f. costaricensis_.\r\n\r\n_M. f. nicaraguae_ in typical form, then, is thought of as a small,\r\nlowland, tropical subspecies only slightly differentiated from _M. f.\r\nperda_. By reason of its intermediate characters, it constitutes a link\r\nbetween the lowland forms, and the larger animals called _M. f.\r\ngoldmani_ and _M. f. costaricensis_.\r\n\r\nNone of the four skulls from Nicaragua shows signs of infestation of\r\nthe frontal sinuses by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 16, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south.

Van Patten.\r\n\r\n     The skull (plates 28-30) is complete and unbroken. All teeth are\r\n     present and unworn. The skin apparently has been remade. It lacks\r\n     the distal two-thirds of the tail. The head is somewhat shrunken.\r\n     The color is possibly faded but if so only to a slight degree.\r\n     Otherwise, the skin is in good condition. The orange color of the\r\n     underparts is so intense as to suggest that the full, adult pelage\r\n     has not been acquired. No white markings are present on the face.\r\n     There is no sex mark on the label attached to the skin but the\r\n     size and proportions of the skull and the scrotal pouch on the\r\n     skin prove that the specimen is a male. The presence of sutures on\r\n     the dorsal face of the rostrum and the short, wide, and low\r\n     sagittal crest show the specimen to be young.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Costa Rica. Altitudinal and zonal range unknown.

Estimated measurements of adult\r\n     males: Total length, 470; length of tail, 165; length of hind foot\r\n     (taken from dried skins of 3 adults), 52 (50-52). Tail estimated\r\n     to average 55 per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind\r\n     foot more or less than (about equal to) basal length.\r\n\r\n     _Female_: A subadult or adult, from the Candelaria Mountains, and\r\n     a subadult from Irazú, measure, respectively: Total length, 370,\r\n     385; length of tail, 130, 150; length of hind foot, 40, 31. Tail\r\n     59 per cent as long as head and body. Length of hind foot probably\r\n     about equal to basal length.\r\n\r\n     The estimated differences in external measurements of the two\r\n     sexes are: Total length, 92; length of tail, 25; length of hind\r\n     foot, 16 (probably average difference is less).\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _M. f. panamensis_ (figure 21)\r\n     except that foot soles are slightly more hairy.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela frenata panamensis_ except\r\n     that: back is near Reddish Black, tone 2 of Oberthür and\r\n     Dauthenay, pl. 344; chin, lips, and throat white or whitish;\r\n     remainder of underparts near (_c_) Ochraceous-Buff; color of\r\n     underparts rarely extending distally onto toes of forefeet.

As compared with that of\r\n_M. f. nicaraguae_ the skull of _M. f. costaricensis_ is heavier and in\r\nevery measurement taken is larger. The skull is generally more massive\r\nand it follows that most measurements of depth and width are greater in\r\nrelation to the basilar length as well as actually greater. The\r\nindividual teeth are larger and the tympanic bullae wider and at their\r\nanterior ends are more projected from the braincase. Indeed the skull\r\nis more like that of _M. f. goldmani_ than like that of _M. f.\r\nnicaraguae_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The half dozen ill-prepared skins, with partial skulls\r\ninside, of this form in the United States National Museum long were\r\nreferred either to _Mustela brasiliensis_ or _Mustela affinis_. It was\r\nnot until 1912 when Goldman studied these specimens that the\r\ndistinctive characters of the Costa Rican weasel were recognized and\r\nmade the basis of the name _costaricensis_.\r\n\r\n_M. f. costaricensis_ is well differentiated from _M. f. nicaraguae_\r\nand _M. f. goldmani_ which occur to the northward and from _M. f.\r\npanamensis_ which occurs to the southward and is a large,\r\nheavy-skulled, dark-colored animal with white facial markings\r\nrestricted or absent. In the type specimen and the female from the\r\nCandelaria Mountains the white facial markings are only narrow facial\r\nbars or a few white hairs, but in the young male from Cervantes there\r\nis a well developed bar 6 millimeters wide on each side of the face and\r\na separate nasofrontal spot, 10 x 12 mm. The young female from Cachí\r\nhas a V-shaped frontonasal spot, on the right side of the face a white\r\nbar 5 mm. wide and 17 mm. long connected with the color of the\r\nunderparts, and on the left side a white spot in front of the ear and\r\nanother between the ear and eye. White facial markings were not\r\nrecorded in the other specimens. The color of the upper parts is only a\r\nlittle less dark than those of _M. f. panamensis_. Owing to the\r\nnumerous white hairs on the dorsal side of the neck, the nape of the\r\nfemale from the Candelaria Mountains has a frosted appearance not\r\npresent in other specimens.\r\n\r\n_M. f. costaricensis_ is a large animal and among its geographic\r\nneighbors is approached in size only by a specimen of _panamensis_ from\r\nBoquete, Panamá. Also the young male from Cervantes suggests\r\n_panamensis_ in the less flattened interorbital region, but even so is\r\nmore like _costaricensis_. The small size of two young males, one from\r\nNavarro and the other from the vicinity of San José, is suggestive of\r\n_M. f. nicaraguae_. However, the large size of most of the specimens\r\nand the configuration of the skull are more as in _M. f. goldmani_ than\r\nin _M. f. nicaraguae_ and thus suggest that the known specimens are of\r\nhigh mountain subspecies. The long black tip of the tail is another\r\npoint of resemblance to _M. f. goldmani_, the high mountain subspecies\r\nto the north. Perhaps in the lowlands of Costa Rica, there are weasels\r\nof another subspecies.\r\n\r\nOf the eight skulls examined for malformation of the frontal sinuses,\r\neach of the two adults and two subadults shows signs of having the\r\nfrontal sinuses infested with parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 14, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south.\r\n\r\n     =Costa Rica=: Irazú (Frasu or Irasu on label), 3000 M., 1[4];\r\n     Cervantes, 1[2]; San José, 1[91]; vicinity of San José, 2[7];\r\n     Azahar Cartago, 1[78]; Tucurrique, 1[7]; Cachí, 1[7]; El Muñco [=\r\n     Muñeco?] (Río Nivarro [= Navarro?]), 4000 ft., 10 mi.

Relative to basilar length, tooth-rows, orbitonasal\r\nlength, interorbital breadth and zygomatic breadth averaging narrower.\r\nMastoid breadth always narrower. Tympanic bullae longer, narrower, and\r\nusually slightly less protruded. P4 and m1 larger. Dorsal outline of\r\nskull, viewed laterally, more convex. Postorbital breadth actually and\r\nrelatively greater. Postorbital processes, mastoid processes, and\r\nsagittal crest not so well developed. Differences between skulls of\r\nfemales, in so far as known, similar to those described between males.\r\n\r\nAs compared with _M. f. costaricensis_, _M. f. panamensis_ has a\r\nlighter skull averaging smaller in every measurement taken except\r\ninterorbital breadth, which is greater. Relative to basilar length,\r\nwidth of rostrum, interorbital breadth and depth of skull at plane of\r\nupper molars, less. Tympanic bullae shorter, narrower, less protruded.\r\nP4, M1, and m1 larger. Dorsal outline of skull, viewed laterally, more\r\nconvex. Postorbital breadth relatively and actually greater.\r\nPostorbital processes, mastoid processes, sagittal crest and lambdoidal\r\ncrest less developed. No skull of an adult female of _M. f.\r\ncostaricensis_ is available for comparison.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This subspecies had not been recognized by previous workers\r\nbecause specimens from Panamá were supposed to be _Mustela affinis_\r\nGray up until 1916, when Allen (1916:100) restricted the type locality\r\nof _M. affinis_ to Bogotá, Colombia. At that time Allen referred\r\nspecimens from Panamá to _Mustela affinis costaricensis_, and Goldman\r\n(1920:161) followed Allen.\r\n\r\nThe specimens examined show much variation. Part of this is geographic\r\nvariation. For instance the specimens from Boquete approach _M. f.\r\ncostaricensis_ in size more than do those from farther south. Too few\r\nadult females have been seen to ascertain the amount of secondary\r\nsexual variation. Bangs (1902:49) suggested that the sex of no. 10113\r\nwas wrongly recorded and that it was not really a male. If so, this\r\nwould reduce the range of apparent variation in size of males from\r\nBoquete by half and bring it into accord with the amount normally\r\nexisting in adult males from one locality. No. 10113 is adult but the\r\nskin shows no mammae which would prove it to be a female instead of a\r\npigmy male. Although even smaller than 10113, the type specimen is so\r\nmuch larger than females of _M. f. meridana_ that I have wondered if it\r\nis correctly sexed. However, the fact that it was sexed by E. A.\r\nGoldman, a collector of wide experience, lessens the possibility that a\r\nmistake was made.\r\n\r\nThe color of the underparts is more restricted in _panamensis_ than in\r\nany other subspecies of the species. Excluding the specimen from Mt.\r\nPirre, the least width of color of the underparts averages 16 (extremes\r\n6-24) per cent of greatest width of the color of the upper parts. This\r\nfeature, together with the black color, imparts an appearance to the\r\nPanamá weasel that is strikingly like that of a mink. _M. f.\r\npanamensis_ is one of the two blackest weasels; _M. f. aureoventris_ is\r\nthe other. Each of these subspecies occurs in a region of heavy\r\nrainfall and there clearly is a positive correlation between high\r\nhumidity and intensity of color. The black tip of the tail, as regards\r\nextent, here reaches the maximum attained among Central and South\r\nAmerican weasels. The foot soles are less hairy than in any other\r\nmember of the subgenus _Mustela_. The tympanic bullae are lower and\r\nless inflated than in any other subspecies of the species.\r\n\r\nAdequate specimens from central and southern Panamá may reveal the\r\nexistence of one or more additional subspecies since animals from each\r\nof the three localities now represented differ from those from the\r\nother two and some of these differences are correlated with geographic\r\nposition. However, specimens from all three localities agree in\r\nseveral features. For example all of them have the dorsal outline of\r\nthe skull highly convex, transversely, and, more especially,\r\nlongitudinally. In this respect they are sharply differentiated from\r\nany other American weasel. Nevertheless, _M. f. panamensis_ is clearly\r\na link between the North and South American subspecies and _panamensis_\r\nintergrades with the adjacent subspecies. The large size of the skull\r\nand teeth and the slightly more ventrally projected tympanic bullae of\r\nno. 10112 from Boquete approach features seen in _M. f. costaricensis_.\r\nThe smaller size of skull and teeth of no. 178970 from Mt. Pirre are\r\npoints of resemblance to _M. f. meridana_.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen was selected from a region where _M. f. panamensis_\r\nis thought to have its distinctive characters well developed. The\r\nspecimen is not adult and, therefore, does not show as many\r\ndifferential characters as does a nontypical adult from Boquete.\r\nNevertheless, the majority of the above mentioned differential\r\ncharacters are shown by the type specimen and an adult from the same\r\nplace would, it is judged, show all the differential characters better\r\nthan would an adult from Boquete.\r\n\r\nOf the 11 skulls examined, 6 show no signs of having had the frontal\r\nsinuses infested with parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 19, listed by localities from\r\n     north to south and unless otherwise indicated in the United States\r\n     National Museum.\r\n\r\n     =Panamá=: Boquete, 10 (3[75], 1[8], 1[2], 3[4], 1[7]); Río Gariche\r\n     [é], 5300 ft., 1[1]; Siola, 1[1]; Chiriquí, 1[7]; Río Indio, near\r\n     Gatún, 1; Mt.

No. 32182, adult, from Mira\r\n     Flores, Cauca, Colombia, measured (by W. B. Richardson), 375, 150,\r\n     43.\r\n\r\n     The average differences in external measurements of the two sexes,\r\n     at Mérida, are: Total length, 87; length of tail, 36; length of\r\n     hind foot, 10.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black (few rarely white)\r\n     and extending beyond ear; carpal vibrissae colored like underparts\r\n     or upper parts, and not extending beyond apical pad of fifth\r\n     digit; hairiness of foot soles slightly greater than shown in\r\n     figure 21.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela frenata panamensis_ except\r\n     that: Posterior fourth of each upper lip rarely, and small spot in\r\n     front of ear usually, white; black of head proper not extending\r\n     back of ears and grading insensibly into color of upper parts;\r\n     anterior half of upper parts of adults \"frosted\" with numerous\r\n     white hairs (tick bites?), upper parts near (_n_) Bay or tone 2 of\r\n     Reddish Black (pl. 344, Oberthür and Dauthenay) or tone 3 in\r\n     freshest, unfaded pelage. Least width of color of underparts (in\r\n     ten males from Mérida) 20 (17-23) per cent of greatest width of\r\n     color of upper parts. Black tip of tail, in same series, 60 to 75\r\n     mm. long, thus longer than hind foot and 41 (40-44) per cent as\r\n     long as tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on type specimen and seven\r\n     topotypes, five adults and three subadults): See measurements and\r\n     plates 25-27; weight, 4.1 (3.8-4.3) grams; basilar length, 43.6\r\n     (42.3-44.3); zygomatic breadth more than distance between condylar\r\n     foramen and M1 or than between anterior palatine foramen and\r\n     anterior margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth less than\r\n     postpalatal length; postorbital breadth greater than length of\r\n     upper premolars or than width of basioccipital measured from\r\n     medial margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     interorbital breadth not less than distance between foramen\r\n     opticum and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum\r\n     greater than length of tympanic bulla; least width of palate\r\n     greater than length of P4; anterior margin of tympanic bulla as\r\n     far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 4 to 5 upper incisors;\r\n     height of tympanic bulla less than distance from its anterior\r\n     margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more or less\r\n     than (approximately equal to) alveolar length of lower molar and\r\n     premolar tooth-row and shorter than rostrum; anterior margin of\r\n     masseteric fossa posterior to m2 and confined to posterior third\r\n     (34 per cent average, 32 minimum, 37 maximum) of mandible.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on four adult topotypes): See measurements and\r\n     plates 37-39; weight (no. 143665), 2.3 grams; basilar length 37.2\r\n     (36.3-38.2); zygomatic breadth more or less than distance between\r\n     condylar foramen and M1 or than distance between anterior palatine\r\n     foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; postorbital breadth\r\n     (sinuses badly infested with parasites) more than length of upper\r\n     premolars or width of basioccipital measured from medial margin of\r\n     one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite; least width of\r\n     palate more than length of P4; tympanic bulla as far posterior to\r\n     foramen ovale as combined width of 4 to 5 upper incisors; height\r\n     of tympanic bulla less than (one half to three fourths of)\r\n     distance from its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of\r\n     tympanic bulla more than length of lower molar and premolar\r\n     tooth-row.\r\n\r\n     The skull of the female is 44 per cent lighter than that of the\r\n     average male.\r\n\r\nComparisons of the skull with those of _M. f. panamensis_ and _affinis_\r\nhave been made in the accounts of those subspecies. As compared with\r\nthe skull of the male of _M. f. aureoventris_, that of _meridana_\r\naverages smaller in every measurement taken. Indeed, none of the skulls\r\nof _meridana_ equals that of _aureoventris_ in basilar length, length\r\nof tooth-rows, length of tympanic bulla, depth of skull at anterior\r\nmargin of basioccipital or at posterior margin of upper molars, or\r\nmeasurements of teeth. Relative to the basilar length, most of the\r\nmeasurements are greater in _meridana_. Exceptions are the relative\r\nlength of the tooth-rows, and the two measurements of depth of the\r\nskull which average less.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--In 1914 when Hollister named this weasel he compared it\r\nwith _M. f. affinis_ and most of the differential characters which he\r\nascribed to _meridana_ were merely \"more than\" or \"less than\" in\r\n_affinis_. In _affinis_, Hollister included specimens from Chiriquí,\r\nPanamá, and the coast of Venezuela. The specimens from these three\r\nplaces were referred by Allen (1916:101) to _Mustela affinis\r\ncostaricensis_, and he restricted (_op. cit._:100) the type locality of\r\n_Mustela affinis affinis_ to Bogotá, Colombia, and synonymized _Mustela\r\nmeridana_ with _M. a. affinis_. Hollister probably would not have named\r\n_meridana_ had he had specimens from Bogotá for comparison and had he\r\nregarded them as topotypes of _affinis_ for the difference is slight.\r\nNevertheless, within the large geographic range of _M. f. meridana_\r\nthere is some geographic variation. There is more of such variation in\r\nthe color of the pelage than in shape and size of the skull. The\r\nspecimen from San Julián is darker than the average and in this respect\r\napproaches true _panamensis_. San Julián is situated at a relatively\r\nlow elevation on the coast of Venezuela.\r\n\r\n_M. f. meridana_ so closely resembles _M. f. affinis_ that the writer\r\nhas no quarrel with anyone who would synonymize _meridana_. However, as\r\nrepresented by topotypes, the two races unquestionably are, _on the\r\naverage_, different, and specimens from the southeastern part of the\r\nrange of _affinis_ probably are individually distinguishable from\r\ntopotypes of _meridana_.\r\n\r\nVariation in the skulls of the series from Mérida is relatively small.\r\nThis applies to both males and females. The external measurements\r\nrecorded by native collectors are not accurate to within more than five\r\nmillimeters but, considering this, variation in external measurements\r\nalso seems to be slight. The difference in size of the two sexes\r\nappears to be uniformly greater than in weasels from Central America.\r\nThe twenty-six topotypes show that the color and color pattern are\r\nrelatively uniform. All are of nearly the same tone except juveniles or\r\nyoung which are, as in the case of _panamensis_, much brighter colored\r\non the underparts. Also, the young have darker-colored upper parts. The\r\nadults, without exception, have numerous white hairs scattered over the\r\nback of the head, neck and between the shoulders. I have no\r\ntrustworthy evidence to support the suggestion that these white hairs\r\nare the results of tick bites or that they are caused by other\r\nparasites which damage the hair follicles. The white facial markings\r\nvary relatively little in the 45 specimens carefully examined in this\r\nregard. Also, the variation in color pattern of the two sides of the\r\nhead is small. Indeed, within rather narrow limits, the color of the\r\ntwo sides of the head is the same in every specimen except two. In\r\nthese two the white spots anterior to the ears are confluent with the\r\ncolor of the underparts. Only one specimen, no. 21342, has a white spot\r\nbetween the eyes and this spot is small. Ten of the twenty-six\r\nspecimens have a definite white spot or band in front of each ear. Two\r\nspecimens have such a spot on one side only. The dark spots at the\r\nangles of the mouth are present on two sides in three specimens and on\r\none side only in three others. The mentioned spots are, then, present\r\nnine out of a possible fifty-two times. When the spots are absent, dark\r\ncolor usually is present in the required area but is confluent with the\r\ncolor of the upper parts.\r\n\r\nA young male from San Julián, Robinson and Lyon (1901:147) state \". . .\r\nwas shot . . . as it ran over some bowlders in a ravine. Its eyes shone\r\nwith the same greenish light as do the eyes of our common weasel, and\r\nit emitted the same strong odor.\" No. 14463, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., from\r\nRío Zapata, Colombia, according to data on the label, was \"taken in\r\ntimber belt in valley in balk hills\" and the native name is Cosonebi.\r\nTwo specimens taken on the Páramo de Tama, head of Tachira River,\r\nVenezuela and Colombia are commented on by Osgood (1912:61) as follows:\r\n\"One . . . was caught in a steel trap baited with birds and set by the\r\nside of a rushing mountain stream. . . . The other was shot in midday\r\nas it came prowling about our 'house' in the clearing. . . .\"\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-three skulls before me, twelve have the frontal sinuses\r\nmalformed by parasites. These twelve include most of the adults for few\r\nof the subadults and fewer of the young show pathologic conditions in\r\nthe frontal region.\r\n\r\n_Note on localities._--Several of the localities in Colombia mentioned\r\nin \"Specimens examined\" are described and located by Chapman\r\n(1917:640-656, pl. 41) in his \"Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia.\"\r\nPlace names for Colombia on labels, not found on any map, or duplicated\r\nnames of which I can not certainly select one, are Río Barrotow, Río\r\nOscuro, Río Zapata, Río Japata, Guasca and El Baldro. Sonson may or\r\nmay not be the town of that name situated some eighty miles northwest\r\nof Bogotá and on the east flank of the Central Andes west of the\r\nMagdalena River on the drainage of the Cauca River. In Venezuela most\r\nof the specimens from Mérida are labeled 1630 meters, Montes de Mérida.\r\nSan Julián is some seven miles east of La Guaira (see Robinson and\r\nLyon, 1901:136). San Esteban is located a little way back from the\r\ncoast between Puerto Cabello and Valencia. Páramo de Tama is on the\r\nVenezuelan-Colombian border near the source of the Tachira River (see\r\nOsgood, 1912:35). Mt. Duida is shown as at 3° 30´ N and 65° 40´ W by\r\nChapman (1931:13) and Mt. Auyán-tepui as near 5° 15´ N and 62° 50´ W by\r\nChapman (1937:760).\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 78, arranged by localities\r\n     from north to south and unless otherwise indicated in the British\r\n     Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n     =Venezuela=: San Julián, 1[91]; Carácas, 2; Galipare, Cerro del\r\n     Avila, 6500 feet, 1; San Esteban, 1[2]; Mérida, 45 (10[91], 14[2],\r\n     10[4], 2[60], 2[14], 1[78]); Páramo de Tama, 1[60].\r\n\r\n     =Colombia=: Páramo de Tama, 1[60]; Cincinnati, 3[9]; Valdiva, 3800\r\n     ft., 1; Medellín, 2; 7200 ft., Barro Blanco, 1[2]; Santa Elena,\r\n     9000 ft., 1[2]; Santa Elena, 1[2]; Sonson, 2 (1[91], 1[2]); Mt.\r\n     Auyan-tepui, 1[2]; Pueblo Rico, 5200 ft., 1[91]; Mira Flores,\r\n     1[2]; Jerico, near Cauca River, 1; Tornel, 20 mi.

The skull (plate 30) lacks the middle 9 mm. of the right\r\n     zygomatic arch, occiput, basioccipital and posterior two-thirds\r\n     of the left tympanic bulla.

Proportions of parts supposedly as\r\n     described in _Mustela frenata meridana_.\r\n\r\n     Female: Estimates from two dried skins: Total length, 365; length\r\n     of tail, 135; length of hind foot, 43. Proportions of parts\r\n     supposedly as described in _Mustela frenata meridana_.\r\n\r\n     The estimated differences in external measurements of the two\r\n     sexes are: Total length, 90; length of tail, 40; length of hind\r\n     foot, 9.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _Mustela frenata meridana_.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _Mustela frenata panamensis_ except\r\n     that: posterior fourth of each upper lip and spot in front of each\r\n     ear white in approximately half of the specimens; black of head\r\n     proper not extending back of ears and grading insensibly into\r\n     color of upper parts; upper parts near (_n_) Bay, or tone 2 of\r\n     Reddish Black (pl. 344, Oberthür and Dauthenay). Least width of\r\n     color of underparts (in five males from vicinity of Bogotá) 24\r\n     (15-29) per cent of greatest width of color of upper parts. Black\r\n     tip of tail, in same series, 60 to 75 mm. long, thus longer than\r\n     hind foot and averaging 38 per cent as long as tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on three adults and two subadult\r\n     topotypes): See measurements and plate 30. As described in\r\n     _Mustela frenata meridana_ except that: Weight, 4.5 grams\r\n     (estimated); basilar length 45.8±; interorbital breadth not\r\n     greater than distance between foramen opticum and anterior margin\r\n     of tympanic bulla (type as in _meridana_ where interorbital\r\n     breadth is more than distance between foramen opticum and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla); least width of palate not less than\r\n     length of P4; masseteric fossa confined to posterior two-fifths\r\n     (38 to 40 per cent; average 39 per cent) of mandible and not\r\n     extended anteriorly to middle of m2.\r\n\r\n     Female: No adults examined.\r\n\r\nAs compared with _M. f. meridana_ the skull of the male is larger, to\r\nthe average amount of 2.2 mm. in basilar length and 1.2 mm. in\r\nzygomatic breadth of adults; length of tooth-rows and mastoid breadth\r\naverage greater but relatively less; breadth of rostrum, interorbital\r\nbreadth and orbitonasal length average actually and relatively less.\r\nThus the skull of _affinis_ is longer and broader, but the facial\r\nregion is actually, as well as relatively, smaller. As compared with\r\nthe skull of the male of _M. f. aureoventris_, that of _M. f. affinis_\r\nis about the same in basilar length. However, in no specimen of\r\n_affinis_ are the measurements of length of tooth-rows or breadth of\r\nrostrum, actually, or relatively, as great as in _aureoventris_. The\r\nsame is true of all measurements taken of M1, P4 and m1. The specimens\r\nfrom the vicinity of Quito and north of there, although referred to\r\n_macrura_, are nearly as dark as typical _affinis_, approach _affinis_\r\nin cranial characters, and indicate intergradation of _affinis_ with\r\n_macrura_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--_Mustela affinis_ was named by John Edward Gray in 1874 (p.\r\n375) on the basis of a specimen from New Granada. Although usually\r\nsynonymized with _Mustela brasiliensis_ by later authors until 1896\r\nwhen Merriam (1896:31) applied the name to weasels from Costa Rica,\r\nnearly all the South American and several of the Central American\r\nweasels have, at one time or another, had Gray's name, _affinis_,\r\napplied to them. Gray, in 1865 (p. 115) when giving measurements of\r\n_Mustela aureoventris_, probably mentioned the specimen, that later\r\nbecame the holotype. In 1916 (p. 98) Allen restricted the type locality\r\nto Bogotá, Colombia. Allen's action was a necessary procedure in\r\nclearing up the systematics of South American weasels and was based on\r\ngood grounds. As set forth by Allen (_loc. cit._), and more in detail\r\nby Chapman (1917:642), Bogotá has long been the shipping point for\r\nColombian vertebrate specimens, many of which were obtained in the\r\nmountains to the east. Allen (1916A:220) quotes Thomas as saying that\r\nthe type specimen was purchased from Stevens at about the same time\r\nthat a number of Colombian birds were purchased from the same dealer.\r\nAlso, specimens from Bogotá agree with Gray's description of the type\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata affinis_, as here defined, constitutes one of the\r\nseveral slight geographic variants met with, on the sides of, and\r\nbetween, the three north and south mountain chains of Colombia. The\r\nothers are lumped under the name _Mustela frenata meridana_. _M. f.\r\naffinis_, in common with specimens from the northern part of the range\r\nof _macrura_ has large teeth. Weasels of all of the region from Quito\r\nto Bogotá have large teeth. To the north there is the smaller-toothed\r\n_meridana_ and to the south the smaller-toothed _macrura_ grading into\r\nthe still smaller-toothed _agilis_, and _boliviensis_.\r\n\r\nTwo skins, without corresponding skulls, from Caqueta are lighter\r\ncolored than any others of _affinis_; possibly the skins are faded by\r\nexposure to light. Since they probably come from an elevation of less\r\nthan 1000 feet in the Amazonian region, they may pertain to another\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\nComplete, unbroken, skulls of _affinis_ are needed to ascertain the\r\ndegree to which _affinis_ and _meridana_ differ in cranial features.\r\nThe several specimens from the immediate region of Bogotá show well the\r\ncolor and the color pattern but lack collectors' measurements.\r\n\r\nNone of the ten skulls examined shows malformation of the frontal\r\nregion due to infestation of the frontal sinuses by parasites. Possibly\r\nthree of the four adults were infested, although not severely.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 27, arranged by localities\r\n     from north to south and unless otherwise indicated in the United\r\n     States National Museum.\r\n\r\n     =Colombia=: El Carmen, 1[2]; W.

See figure 29 on page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _Mustela\r\n     africana stolzmanni_ by absence of median, longitudinal, abdominal\r\n     stripe of same color as upper parts, by presence of p2 and by two\r\n     rather than one root on P2; from _Mustela frenata macrura_ by\r\n     Reddish Black, tone 4, plate 344 rather than Chocolate, tone 3,\r\n     pl. 343 (of Oberthür and Dauthenay), or slightly darker color of\r\n     upper parts; from _M. f. affinis_ and _M. f. meridana_ by darker\r\n     color (tone 4 rather than tone 2, Reddish Black of Ober. and\r\n     Dauth.) of upper parts and larger size of teeth (M1 with length\r\n     more than 2.4 and breadth more than 4.7; P4 with outside length\r\n     more than 5.9; length of m1 more than 6.2).\r\n\r\n     _Description._--Unless otherwise stated, information concerning\r\n     this subspecies is derived from the one referred specimen\r\n     available, a young male, no. 34677, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.\r\n\r\n     _Size._--Male: Total length, 470; length of tail, 160; length of\r\n     hind foot, 50. Tail 51 per cent as long as head and body.\r\n\r\n     Female: Not known.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Longest facial vibrissae black and reaching beyond\r\n     ear. Carpal vibrissae reaching to or beyond apical pad of fifth\r\n     digit; hairiness of foot soles slightly less than shown in figure\r\n     20.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Sides and top of head and neck posteriorly to shoulders\r\n     black; white facial markings represented by only five white hairs\r\n     anterior to right ear, one anterior to left ear and three far back\r\n     on forehead; dark areas at angles of mouth confluent with color of\r\n     upper parts; tip of tail black; remainder of upper parts near\r\n     (_n_) Bay or Reddish Black, tone 4 of Oberthür and Dauthenay, pl.\r\n     344; chin whitish; remainder of underparts Warm Buff, deep orange\r\n     in juvenile, type specimen, according to Gray (1864, pl. 8); color\r\n     of underparts extending distally on posterior sides of forelegs to\r\n     wrists but not reaching foot soles and on hind legs to or slightly\r\n     below knees. Least width of color of underparts equal to 15 per\r\n     cent of greatest width of color of upper parts. Black tip of tail\r\n     equal to 27 per cent of length of tail-vertebrae.\r\n\r\n     In color, no. 34677 is, to me as it was to Allen (1916:101),\r\n     indistinguishable from the darkest specimens (nos. 178970 and\r\n     10112) of _M. f. panamensis_. Therefore, _M. f. aureoventris_ is\r\n     one of the two darkest subspecies of weasels.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male: See measurements and plates 27-29;\r\n     weight, 4.3 grams; basilar length, 45.8; zygomatic breadth\r\n     approximately equal to distance between condylar foramen and M1\r\n     and to distance between anterior palatine foramen and anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth less than postpalatal\r\n     length; postorbital breadth more than length of upper premolars\r\n     and greater than width of basioccipital measured from medial\r\n     margin of one foramen lacerum posterior to its opposite;\r\n     interorbital breadth greater than distance between foramen opticum\r\n     and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; breadth of rostrum less (at\r\n     least in young specimen) than length of tympanic bulla; least\r\n     width of palate seldom if ever greater than length of P4; anterior\r\n     margin of tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as\r\n     width of three (including I3) upper incisors; height of tympanic\r\n     bulla not greater than distance from its anterior margin to\r\n     foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla more than length of lower\r\n     molar and premolar tooth-row and shorter than orbitonasal length;\r\n     anterior margin of masseteric fossa below anterior half of m2.\r\n\r\n     Skulls of males of _M. f. aureoventris_, and _Mustela frenata\r\n     macrura_ from the vicinity of Quito so closely resemble one\r\n     another as not to be distinguished with the material now\r\n     available, although the teeth of _aureoventris_ are larger.\r\n     Comparisons of the skulls of males with those of _M. f. meridana_\r\n     and _affinis_, which are readily distinguishable from those of\r\n     _aureoventris_, have been made in the accounts of those\r\n     subspecies.\r\n\r\n     Female: Skull of adult unknown.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--This subspecies of the Tropical Life-zone, or at least the\r\nSubtropical Life-zone, of Ecuador, in certain cranial characters\r\nresembles _Mustela frenata macrura_ of the Temperate Life-zone. The two\r\ndiffer markedly in color. Nevertheless, a large number of the specimens\r\ncollected in Ecuador are intermediate in color as well as in zonal\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen is young or a juvenile. The measurements of no. 34677\r\nfrom Gualea indicate an animal similar in size to _M. f. affinis_. Gray\r\n(1864:55) states that the type specimen measures \"Length of body and\r\nhead 6 inches, of tail 4-1/2 inches.\" The plate (pl. 8) accompanying\r\nGray's original description (_loc. cit._) is marked one-half natural\r\nsize and represents the animal as having a head and body length of\r\neight and one-half inches. One year later Gray (1865:115) gives the\r\nmeasurements of this species as \"Length of body and head 12, tail 8\r\ninches.\" Since he had at this time another specimen, larger than the\r\ntype specimen (which specimen later, probably, became the type of\r\n_Mustela affinis_ Gray), the larger measurements probably were taken\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nGeographically, and as regards cranial characters, _Mustela frenata\r\naureoventris_ is most closely related to _M. f. affinis_ and to the\r\nnorthern section of _M. f. macrura_, but in color to _M. f.\r\npanamensis_. _M. f. aureoventris_ and _M. f. panamensis_ are the two\r\ndarkest-colored subspecies and each occurs in a region of extremely\r\nheavy rainfall. There is a skin only, no. 32620, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,\r\nfrom Munchique, obtained on June 1, 1911, which is appreciably darker\r\nthan specimens of _M. f. affinis_ in corresponding pelage and is\r\nintermediate between _M. f. affinis_ and _M. f. aureoventris_ in color\r\nas it is geographically. The specimen measures 495, 202, 52.\r\n\r\nThe name _Mustela aureoventris_ Gray has been regarded by most authors\r\nas preoccupied by _Mustela auriventer_ Hodgson (1841:909). However, the\r\nwriter is not of this opinion and agrees with Thomas (1920:224) that\r\n\"The name _aureoventris_ is not invalidated by the _auriventer_ of\r\nHodgson, as, apart from 'one-letterist' differences, its first half\r\ncomes from the adjective _aureus_, while Hodgson's name is based on the\r\nsubstantive _aurum_, so that not only the spellings but the derivations\r\nare different.\" The spelling of Gray's name should be _aureoventris_\r\nfor this is the spelling in the original description which in\r\npagination precedes the colored plate of the animal that is labeled\r\n_Mustela aureoventris_. _Putorius brasiliensis_ var. _aequatorialis_\r\nCoues (1877:142) is the only name known to the writer that has been\r\nproposed as a substitute for _Mustela aureoventris_ Gray.\r\n\r\nThomas (1920:224) treats _Mustela macrura_ Taczanowski as a synonym of\r\n_Mustela aureoventris_ Gray. Allen (1916:101) also treats the two names\r\nas applying to the same kind of weasel but regards _aureoventris_ as\r\npreoccupied and therefore uses the name _macrura_. Taczanowski's\r\noriginal description (1874:311) and plate of _Mustela macrura_ indicate\r\nan animal that is lighter colored than _M. f. affinis_. Gray's original\r\ndescription (1864:55) and plate of _aureoventris_ indicate an animal\r\nthat is darker colored than _M. f. affinis_. Indeed Gray (1865:115) in\r\nspeaking of the type of _aureoventris_ as compared with an adult from\r\nNew Granada [= Colombia] that probably later became the type specimen\r\nof _Mustela affinis_, states: \"The young from Quito is much darker than\r\nthe adult;. . . .\" Comparison of the plates accompanying the original\r\ndescriptions of _aureoventris_ and _macrura_ well illustrate the\r\ndifference stated in the written descriptions. My examination of the\r\ntype specimens of _M. macrura_ and _M. f. aureoventris_ shows them to\r\nhave been fairly accurately portrayed in the plates accompanying the\r\noriginal descriptions. Accordingly the two names are used for the two\r\nkinds of animals which appear, however, to be only subspecifically\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nComparison of Gray's plate (1864, pl. 8) with the available specimens\r\nfrom South America indicates that the name _aureoventris_ is based on\r\nan individual that is lighter colored than no. 34677 Amer. Mus. Nat.\r\nHist., from Gualea, Ecuador, but on one which resembles no. 34677 more\r\nthan it does the lighter-colored specimens from the Temperate Zone of\r\nEcuador and northern Perú. Because Quito, Ecuador, is in the Temperate\r\nLife-zone and because the available specimens from this zone in Ecuador\r\nand northern Perú are distinctly lighter colored than Gray's plate\r\nrepresenting the type of _aureoventris_ shows this specimen to be, it\r\nis judged to have come from an altitude lower than that of Quito (9350\r\nfeet, according to Chapman, 1926:717); probably it came from the\r\nSubtropical Life-zone of Ecuador. Indeed Gray (1864:55) did not say\r\nthat the specimen was collected or obtained at Quito but that it\r\nwas \". . . received from Quito. . . .\" Chapman (1926:717) has pointed\r\nout that Quito, since 1846 has been the distributing point for bird\r\nskins which specimens \". . . come from the vicinity of the city, from\r\nthe 'Napo' region on the Amazonian slopes of the Andes, and from\r\nNanegal, Gualea, and other localities on the Pacific side rarely below\r\nthe Subtropical Zone.\" It is also pointed out that only some of the\r\nspecimens are labeled with their approximate place of capture and that\r\neven then these localities cannot be accepted as definite; they\r\nindicate mainly whether the specimen is from the eastern or western\r\nside of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned considerations and information gained by study of\r\nthe specimens cause me to think that the type is an intergrade tending\r\ntoward the lighter-colored _Mustela f. macrura_ of the Temperate Zone\r\nalthough sufficiently dark to be referred to the dark subspecies\r\nrepresented by no. 34677 Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., from Gualea, Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe skull of no. 34677 shows no infestation of the frontal sinuses by\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 3, as follows:\r\n\r\n     =Ecuador=: Gualea, 1, Amer.

It is to honor his contributions to mammalogy that the subspecies\r\nis named _helleri_. No. 24135 is the specimen carried as a pet for some\r\ntime by Mr. and Mrs. Heller and of which Mrs. Heller (1924:481) has\r\ngiven an account.\r\n\r\nThis subspecies is insufficiently known, especially as to geographic\r\nrange; probably it occupies a considerable range in the Tropical\r\nLife-zone along the eastern base of the Andes. The three females, two\r\nfrom Ambo and one from Huanuco, come from a much higher altitude than\r\ndo the two males and the climate is said to be arid at Ambo and\r\nHuanuco. The skulls of the females are 62 per cent lighter and\r\ncorrespondingly smaller in measurements, than those of males. This\r\ndifference is more than that found in any other South American weasel\r\nand it may be that the females are of a subspecies other than\r\n_helleri_.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen has a broad skull with major proportions strikingly\r\nlike those of _Mustela stolzmanni_. Possibly the similar climatic\r\nconditions under which the two live have left their impress in similar\r\nfashion in this part of each of the two species. The teeth, tympanic\r\nbullae, and certain other parts of the skull are, however, so\r\ndifferently proportioned as to show that the skulls represent two\r\nspecies. The referred male has a much longer skull than the type\r\nspecimen and the relative proportions of breadth and depth of the two\r\nskulls differ widely. Judging from large series of weasels examined\r\nfrom localities outside the range of _M. f. helleri_, the two skulls\r\nprobably represent almost the maximum of individual variation occurring\r\nin one subspecies.\r\n\r\nThe dark color is as might be expected since _helleri_ inhabits the\r\nhumid Tropical Zone.\r\n\r\nNone of the five skulls shows signs of having had the frontal sinuses\r\ninfested by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 5, all in the Field Museum of\r\n     Natural History.\r\n\r\n     =Perú=: 3500 ft., Hacienda Buena Vista, Río Chinchao, 1; 3000 ft.,\r\n     Hacienda San Antonio, Río Chinchao, 1; Huanuco, 1; Ambo, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela frenata agilis= Tschudi\r\n\r\nLong-tailed Weasel\r\n\r\nPlates 27, 28, 29, 39 and 40\r\n\r\n    _Mustela agilis_ Tschudi, Fauna Peruana, p. 110, 1844; Gray, Proc.\r\n      Zoöl.

Top of head near\r\n     (_n_) Mars Brown, and Carbon Brown, tone 3 (pl. 342, Ober. and\r\n     Dauth.); tip of tail black; remainder of upper parts near (16\"\r\n     _j_) Tawny-Olive, and Chocolate (tone 2, of pl. 343 of Ober. and\r\n     Dauth.) or Raw Umber (tone 3 of pl. 301 of Ober. and Dauth.);\r\n     anterior half of underparts, including posterior sides of forelegs\r\n     and antipalmar faces of forefeet, white; remainder of underparts\r\n     tinged with Warm Buff and extended on posterior legs almost to\r\n     ankles.\r\n\r\n     No. 8.1.10.1., male adult, from Lima, is also light colored, and\r\n     as described in no. 21147, except that left side of head has a\r\n     white spot rather than bar; posterior eighth of each upper lip\r\n     white; white frontonasal spot present, 11 x 11 mm.; antipalmar\r\n     faces of forefeet spotted with brown color of upper parts; color\r\n     of underparts extending distally on hind legs along medial side of\r\n     foot to point halfway between heel and tip of inner toe.\r\n\r\n     No. 13257 from Huarochirí in color and color pattern closely\r\n     resembles no. 21147. It differs from no. 21147 in slightly lighter\r\n     color of upper parts, entirely white underparts, less extension of\r\n     color of underparts onto forefeet, few white hairs instead of\r\n     white band in front of each ear; color of underparts more\r\n     restricted.\r\n\r\n     In each of the four specimens, the least width of the underparts,\r\n     expressed as a percentage of the upper parts, is as follows: no.\r\n     13257, 11 per cent; no. 21147, 29 per cent; no. 565, 31 per cent;\r\n     no. 8.1.10.1., nineteen per cent.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male (based on no. 8.1.10.1.): See\r\n     measurements and plates 27-29. As described in _Mustela frenata\r\n     macrura_ except that: Weight 4.1 grams; basilar length, 42.5;\r\n     zygomatic breadth more than distance between anterior palatine\r\n     foramen and anterior margin of tympanic bulla; mastoid breadth\r\n     less than postpalatal length; tympanic bullae shorter than\r\n     rostrum.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on no. 21147): See measurements and plates 39 and\r\n     40. As described in _Mustela frenata macrura_ except that: Weight\r\n     (no. 21147, subadult), 1.5 grams; basilar length, 35.2; least\r\n     width of palate less than outside length of P4; tympanic bulla as\r\n     far posterior to foramen ovale as combined width of five upper\r\n     incisors; no. 565 answers to the same description but differs from\r\n     no. 21147 in greater basilar length and larger tympanic bullae\r\n     which are slightly more projected, at their anterior margins, from\r\n     the braincase.\r\n\r\nTo judge from the skull of the female from Macate and the skull of the\r\nmale from Lima, the skull and teeth of _agilis_ are smaller than in any\r\nother South American subspecies of _Mustela frenata_, except _M. f.\r\nboliviensis_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Tschudi almost certainly used the name _Mustela agilis_ in\r\na composite sense. His statement (see quoted matter below) about the\r\nmarked variation in color of this species, as represented by the skins\r\ncarried by the Indian women as purses, indicates that the forms here\r\ndesignated as _Mustela macrura_, _M. helleri_ and possibly others\r\nadditional to the one here called _agilis_ were included by him under\r\nthe name _Mustela agilis_. Taczanowski took account of _Mustela agilis_\r\nwhen he described other species from Perú. Allen (1916:104) and Thomas\r\n(1920:224) were not convinced that _Mustela agilis_ and _Mustela\r\nmacrura_ were distinct species or subspecies.\r\n\r\nSearch on August 28, 1937, in the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle, at\r\nNeuchatel, Switzerland, by Mr. Théodore Delachaux, assistant there, and\r\nthe writer, revealed no trace of weasels from Tschudi's collection,\r\nalthough some other specimens of mammals that he figured in the \"Fauna\r\nPeruana\" are preserved in that Museum. Not only were the collections of\r\nspecimens examined but the new catalogue and old catalogue of mammals\r\nwere vainly searched for mention of weasels deposited by Tschudi.\r\nLater, at the British Museum of Natural History, on page 105 of a\r\npersonal notebook, of the late Mr. Oldfield Thomas, record was found of\r\nhis fruitless search for the same specimens of _Mustela_ in May, 1902,\r\nat Neuchatel.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tschudi certainly used the name _Mustela agilis_ in a\r\ncomposite sense, as subspecies are at present understood, his\r\ndescription most nearly applies to the light-colored animals from\r\nwestern Perú--the lightest colored of any South American weasels seen.\r\nThey are of approximately the same color as North American subspecies\r\ninhabiting semiarid regions, for example _Mustela frenata longicauda_\r\nof the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nAnother, but in my opinion less weighty, justification for applying\r\nTschudi's name _agilis_ to these light-colored weasels of western Perú\r\nis that by one line of reasoning, Taczanowski in naming _macrura_\r\n(_jelskii_ is a synonym of it) from farther eastward in Perú, and that\r\nHall in naming _helleri_ from still farther eastward, and _boliviensis_\r\nto the southeastward, geographically restricted the application of the\r\nname _agilis_. Hall's action did this because he recognized geographic\r\nvariation and employed the subspecies concept. Taczanowski, however,\r\nproposed his name _macrura_ for a kind of animal which he indicated was\r\nspecifically (as opposed to subspecifically) distinct from _agilis_ and\r\nhis account (1881:649) of _jelskii_ indicates that he thought _Mustela\r\nagilis_ Tschudi might occur in the same place as the animals which he\r\nnamed as new kinds. Thus, we can not credit Taczanowski with _intent_\r\nto restrict the name _agilis_ geographically, even though later authors\r\nmay choose to rule that his naming of _macrura_ in effect did so\r\nrestrict the application of _Mustela agilis_ Tschudi.\r\n\r\nThe equivalents in millimeters given by Allen (1916:104) for Tschudi's\r\nmeasurements of 9 to 10 inches entire length, and tails of 4 inches to\r\n4 inches and 4 lines, apparently are based on the London scale in use\r\ntoday. If Tschudi employed the Rhine scale also of eight lines to the\r\ninch, but one which has the foot longer by an amount of 20 millimeters,\r\nor the Leipzig scale in which the foot is 22 millimeters shorter than\r\nthe London foot, the measurements recorded by Tschudi differ in one\r\ndirection or the other from those computed by Allen. However, knowledge\r\nof which scale Tschudi employed would not help much, if any, in more\r\nprecise application of the name _agilis_ because he does not indicate\r\nwhether his measurements are of male or female animals; animals of the\r\ntwo sexes of the same subspecies differ more in external measurements\r\nthan animals of the same sex of different subspecies of Peruvian\r\nweasels.\r\n\r\nSpecimen no. 565, in the Polish Museum of Natural History, without\r\ndefinite locality, is provisionally referred to this subspecies. The\r\nspecimen is intermediate in several respects between the female from\r\nMacate and the one of _macrura_ from Cutervo.\r\n\r\n     Tschudi (1844:111-112) has given the following account:\r\n     \"_Lebensweise und geographische Verbreitung_. Das peruanische\r\n     Wiesel lebt auf den kalten, öden Hochebenen der Cordillera an\r\n     sonnigen Steinhaufen und Felsen gewöhnlich in Gesellschaft von\r\n     8-12 Stücken. Diese Thierchen sind so ausserordentlich behende und\r\n     scheu, dass bei dem leisesten Geräusche die ganze Schaar mit\r\n     Blitzesschnelle verschwindet. Es ist uns auch nie gelungen, eines\r\n     derselben zu erlegen. Die Indianer aber verstehen es, dieselben\r\n     lebendig einzufangen und zu zähmen. Ein sehr zahmes sahen wir bei\r\n     einer uns befreundeten Dame in Tarma; gegen alle Fremden biss es\r\n     mit Wuth und liess sich nicht anfassen, während es sich von seiner\r\n     Herrin Alles gefallen liess; sie öffnete ihm den Mund und steckte\r\n     ihm den Finger hinein, ohne dass es eine böse Miene dazu machte,\r\n     während es bei der geringsten Bewegung, die wir machten, es zu\r\n     ergreifen, grimmig auf uns lossprang. Wenn es eingeschüchtert\r\n     wurde, versteckte es sich in den Busen seiner Gebieterin und kroch\r\n     ihr bald nachher zum Aermel heraus. An den Wänden und Meublen\r\n     kletterte es mit grosser Behendigkeit und schlüpfte durch so\r\n     kleine Ritzen und Löcher, dass wir fast an der Möglichkeit dieses\r\n     Hindurchdringens gezweifelt haben würden, wenn wir es nicht selbst\r\n     mit angesehen hätten. Wenn es unartig war, wurde es mit einer\r\n     Schnur an seinem kleinen Halsbande festgebunden; dadurch vermehrte\r\n     sich sein Zorn, so dass es zuweilen gegen die Dame auffuhr.\r\n     Mehrmals verschwand es während 8-10 Tagen und kam dann plötzlich\r\n     wieder zum Vorschein. Seine Nahrung bestand in Gemüse und Fleisch,\r\n     besonders aber liebte es Zuckerbrod in Milch aufgeweicht; einmal\r\n     machte es sich an einen Kanarienvogel, den es auch tödtete. Es\r\n     erhielt seine Strafe und verschwand dann für immer. Die Indianer\r\n     sollen dieses Wiesel zum Fange der Viscacha abrichten (davon\r\n     weiter unten). Sie nennen es Comadreja, auch Ardilla. ([footnote]\r\n     Ardilla ist spanisch und heisst Eichhörnchen. Mit diesem Namen\r\n     werden sehr verschiedene Thiere bezeichnet; ausser dem Sc.\r\n     variabilis und der Galictis agilis auch noch mehrere Nager und\r\n     einige Didelphysarten.) Die Indianerinnen verfertigen sich aus dem\r\n     kleinen Felle Geldbeutel. Des Sonntags trifft man unter den vielen\r\n     tausend Punaindianerinnen die nach den grossen Dörfern der Sierra\r\n     kommen, um ihre Einkäufe zu machen, kaum ein halbes Dutzend, die\r\n     nicht solche Börsen mit sich führten, und dann kann man auch die\r\n     verschiedensten Farbennuancen, die bei dieser Species vorkommen,\r\n     beobachten.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the three skulls referred to this subspecies shows infestation\r\nof the frontal sinuses by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 4.\r\n\r\n     =Perú=: Macate, 1 (Field Mus.

An adult from Yana Mayo, Río\r\n     Tarma, was measured by Hendee as 394, 134. Hind foot relaxed\r\n     measures, 47. Tail 55 per cent as long as head and body. Length\r\n     of hind foot more than basal length.\r\n\r\n     Female (based on measurements given by Taczanowski (1881:647) of\r\n     no. 564): Total length, 323; length of tail, 120; length of hind\r\n     foot, 37.

The\r\nskulls of females available indicate that the skull and teeth are\r\nlarger than in _agilis_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Seven years after Taczanowski named this subspecies, he\r\napplied the name _jelskii_ to a female taken farther north than the\r\noriginal examples of _macrura_. As indicated in synonymy, various other\r\nnames have been applied to animals included by the present author in\r\nthis subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Mustela frenata macrura_ intergrades with _M. f. affinis_ as shown by\r\npractically all the referred specimens from north of Junín. As one\r\nproceeds northward the color of the weasels becomes progressively\r\ndarker and the teeth become larger until the conditions found in\r\n_affinis_ are met with near the northern border of Ecuador. From the\r\nmaterial available it appears that the light-colored upper parts found\r\nin _macrura_ characterize weasels of, at least, the Temperate Zone,\r\nfrom Marcapata, Perú, to near Quito, Ecuador. West of the range of\r\n_macrura_ there exists the still lighter-colored subspecies, _M. f.\r\nagilis_. Immediately adjacent on the north, east, and south,\r\ndarker-colored weasels occur. So far as color is concerned, the\r\ngeographic range of the subspecies _M. f. macrura_ is not difficult to\r\ndefine. However, the small size of the teeth characterizes only that\r\npart of this light-colored subspecies from Junín southward including\r\nthe subspecies _boliviensis_ at the southern extremity of the range of\r\nthe species. From Cutervo northward the light-colored weasels of the\r\nTemperate Zone have teeth similar in size to those of the darker, more\r\nnorthern _affinis_. To designate the slightly larger-toothed,\r\nlight-colored animals from Ecuador as a subspecies distinct from\r\n_affinis_ and _macrura_ is one solution but at present it seems best to\r\nrefer all of these light-colored animals to _macrura_.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen and topotype no. 562 differ more in the amount of\r\ninflation of the tympanic bullae than adult males of comparable ages\r\nfrom a given locality usually do. In other respects, the differences\r\nbetween the two skulls are not greater than those ordinarily found in\r\nspecimens from the same locality. No. 562 has the tympanic bullae\r\ngreatly, relative to the other South American weasels, inflated\r\nposteriorly. Otherwise, the bullae agree with those of the type\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from southwestern Ecuador, average large, and include the\r\nlargest specimens of the species _Mustela frenata_ seen from South\r\nAmerica. A subadult male, no. 61406, in the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, is the largest. Its external measurements are 482, 191, 56.\r\nThe basilar length of the skull is 48.2 and the zygomatic breadth is\r\n30.3. Although not so large as this specimen, the corresponding\r\nmeasurements of specimens from Alamor, El Chiral, and even from as far\r\naway as Sigsig also are distinctly large.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the female from Ollantaytambo and that of the male from\r\nMarcapata have teeth equally as small as do the specimens from Lake\r\nJunín.\r\n\r\nThe skin alone, no. 194328, from Ollantaytambo has the color of the\r\nunderparts extended over the entire upper sides of the forefeet. The\r\nmale from Marcapata has less of this color on the forefeet and is in\r\nthis respect intermediate between the specimens from Lake Junín and the\r\none from Ollantaytambo.\r\n\r\nIn size of teeth the female, type specimen of _M. jelskii_, from\r\nCutervo, shows an approach to the larger-toothed weasels of the\r\nnorthern part of the range of _macrura_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in the Riksmuseum from the vicinity of Quito, Ecuador,\r\nhave been rather fully described by Lönnberg (1921:11-17) and need\r\nlittle comment here, except to say that they show, as he suggested,\r\nthat the weasel of the Temperate Zone of Ecuador is an intermediate\r\nlink between _M. f. macrura_ and _M. f. affinis_.\r\n\r\nThe adult female and juvenal male labeled as from Ambato have little\r\nleft of the skulls except some of the teeth and the assignment of the\r\nspecimens to the subspecies _macrura_ is made mainly on geographic\r\ngrounds. These two specimens probably are part of the shipment of birds\r\nand mammals of which Chapman (1926:703) speaks as follows: \"A small\r\ncollection of native-made skins purchased by the American Museum from a\r\ncommission merchant in New York City as from 'Ambato' proved to be from\r\nthe eastern slope of the Andes.\" Another skin in the same Museum,\r\nlabeled by a native collector as from \"Baeza arriba\" [= above Baeza] is\r\nso dark colored and has the color of the underparts so much restricted,\r\nas to suggest that it belongs to the race _aureoventris_. Possibly,\r\ntherefore, it was taken not at Baeza, Ecuador, which I find to the\r\neastward of Quito at 77° 55' W and O° 25' S, but at some place of the\r\nsame name on the Pacific Slope, unless the locality has been altogether\r\nwrongly recorded on the label. If the specimen was taken near the Baeza\r\nabove referred to, then it gives evidence of an unnamed race of\r\n_Mustela_ on the eastern slope of the Andes, characterized by its dark\r\ncolor. Unfortunately the specimen is young and its skull therefore\r\noffers insufficient basis for the judging of its subspecific\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\nOther specimens, in the British Museum of Natural History, recorded as\r\ntaken \"near Quito\" and here tentatively listed under _macrura_, mostly,\r\ninclude specimens so dark colored as to lead me to think they came from\r\ncountry, lower than Quito, adjacent to the range of _aureoventris_.\r\n\r\nNematodes taken from the right frontal sinus of no. 562 from Junín\r\nproved to belong to the superfamily Oxyuriodea according to Professor\r\nW. B. Herms and Mr. O. L. Williams, who have independently identified\r\nthem. Because these worms had been dried fifty-five years in the\r\nmounted specimen and were later boiled in cleaning the skull, a more\r\naccurate determination was impossible and whether or not they pertain\r\nto the same species found in North American weasels cannot be said. Of\r\n18 adult skulls examined for this type of infestation, 13 were found\r\naffected as judged by the evident malformation of the frontal region.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 74, arranged by localities\r\n     from north to south and unless otherwise indicated in the American\r\n     Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n     =Ecuador=: Ibarra, 6600 ft., and 7500 ft., 2[7]; San Antonio,\r\n     8000-8500 ft., 5 mi.

Ockenden (sic).\r\n\r\n_M. f. boliviensis_ is smaller than any other South American weasel\r\nexcept possibly _agilis_. Better material of the two races probably\r\nwill show even _agilis_ to be larger.\r\n\r\nEarly in my study of _Mustela_ after examination of the one young\r\nspecimen, from Limbaní, in the United States National Museum, an\r\naccount of this race was drawn up, but the account was discarded for\r\nwant of satisfactory material and the animal was referred to _macrura_.\r\nThen, in 1937, when the two other specimens were studied, the race was\r\nformally characterized as different from previously recognized kinds.\r\n\r\nThe collector has noted on the labels of the two young from Limbaní\r\nthat they were shot in the afternoon when running together beneath\r\nbushes. The frontal sinuses of the type are malformed as a result of\r\ninfestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 3, as follows:\r\n\r\n     =Perú=: Carabaya, Limbaní, 2 (one in U.

(See plates 39 and 40.)\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Known only from the Pleistocene deposit in Conard\r\n     Fissure, at the type locality in northern Arkansas.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--Skull. Probably female (based on the type): See\r\n     measurements and plates 39 and 40; weight unknown; basilar length,\r\n     38.1; least width of palate less than greatest length of P4;\r\n     tympanic bulla as far posterior to foramen ovale as width of 3 to\r\n     5 upper incisors; height of tympanic bulla less than distance from\r\n     its anterior margin to foramen ovale; length of tympanic bulla\r\n     less than length of rostrum.\r\n\r\n_Comparison and remarks._--The type specimen was the only individual\r\nreferred by Brown (1908) to this species. The remaining material of\r\nweasels from this deposit was referred by Brown to his _Putorius\r\ncicognanii angustidens_. Examination of the original materials\r\nconvinces the writer, too, that the specimens, except no. 12431, _are_\r\nof the species _erminea_ [= _cicognanii_ of Brown]. No. 12431 itself\r\nmay possibly be _erminea_ but is far more probably of the species\r\n_frenata_. The uncertainty is due to the fact that an occasional skull\r\nalone of a subadult male _erminea_ is extremely difficult certainly to\r\ndistinguish from a skull alone of an adult female _frenata_. This is\r\ntrue among Recent specimens in the northern Mississippi Valley today;\r\nmore exactly in Iowa and southern Minnesota the females of _frenata_,\r\noftentimes intergrades between the subspecies _Mustela frenata\r\nlongicauda_, _M. f. noveboracensis_ and _M. f. primulina_, by only the\r\nskulls are next to indistinguishable from certain, unusually slender\r\nskulls of male _erminea_. At other places where the ranges of the two\r\nspecies meet, this difficulty is not so often encountered. Also, the\r\ntype of _gracilis_ has the skull broken in such a way that the\r\npostglenoid length in relation to the length of the skull as a whole\r\ncould not be accurately determined in this particular skull.\r\n\r\nThe type specimen of _gracilis_ surely is an adult and because of its\r\nsmall size is thought to be a female. Of known long-tailed weasels of\r\nthe species _frenata_, _gracilis_ is structurally nearest to _M. f.\r\nprimulina_ which occurs in the same region today and to _M. f.\r\nnoveboracensis_, the long-tailed weasel of the eastern United States.\r\n_M. gracilis_ differs from _noveboracensis_ and agrees with _primulina_\r\nin possessing well-marked temporal ridges which fuse to form a low\r\nsagittal crest, in having the mastoid processes projecting farther,\r\nlaterally, beyond the braincase, in having the anterior ends of the\r\ntympanic bullae produced below the squamosal rather than on the same\r\nplane with the squamosal, and in having the bullae more inflated\r\nanteromedially. _M. gracilis_ differs from both _noveboracensis_ (97\r\n[M] and 56 [F] with skulls of comparable age) and _primulina_ (64 [M]\r\nand 24 [F] with skulls of comparable age) in that the zygomatic breadth\r\namounts to less than 58 per cent of the basilar length. Another\r\ndifference from any one of the skulls of females of _primulina_ is the\r\nlonger rostrum, which, when measured from the posterior base of the\r\npostorbital process of the frontal to the anterior end of the nasal on\r\nthe same side, amounts to more than 35 per cent of the basilar length.\r\nAs pointed out by Brown (1908:182) this specimen represents the extreme\r\nof slender skull among known kinds of American weasels.\r\n\r\n     Selected measurements of no. 12431, the type specimen of _Mustela\r\n     gracilis_, are as follows: Basilar length of Hensel, 38.1 mm.;\r\n     length of upper tooth-rows, 14.3 to 14.4; breadth of rostrum,\r\n     11.0; interorbital breadth, 8.5; orbitonasal length, 13.6; mastoid\r\n     breadth, 18.2; length of tympanic bulla, 13.0; breadth of tympanic\r\n     bulla, 6.3; depth of tympanic bulla, 3.25; outside length of P4,\r\n     4.5; inside length of P4, 4.7; breadth of M1, 3.4; length of inner\r\n     moiety of M1, 1.8; depth of skull at anterior margin of\r\n     basioccipital, 12.2; depth of skull at posterior borders of last\r\n     upper molars, 11.3; distance from foramen ovale to tympanic bulla,\r\n     3.6 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n=MUSTELA AFRICANA= Desmarest\r\n\r\nTropical Weasel\r\n\r\n(Synonymy under subspecies)\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Type._--_Mustela africana_ Desmarest, Nouv. Dict. d'Hist.

See figure 29 on page\r\n     221.\r\n\r\n_Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _Mustela frenata_,\r\nthe only geographically adjacent species of the genus, by: presence of\r\nthenar pad on forefoot; presence of a longitudinal, median, abdominal\r\nstripe of same color as upper parts; upper lips being broadly edged,\r\nentirely round, with color of underparts; failure of longest facial\r\nvibrissae to reach posterior margin of ear; absence of p2; relative\r\nflatness (see pl. 29, fig. i and pl. 39, fig. _h_) of tympanic bullae.\r\n\r\n_Characters of the species._--Size large (total length of adults\r\napproximately 500 mm.); foot-soles naked; thenar pad present on\r\nforefoot; length of claws, measured on concave sides, less than one and\r\none-fourth times depth of claws measured at bases; longest facial\r\nvibrissae not reaching posterior margin of ear; tail relatively long\r\nhaired; tail at all ages terminating in point as is characteristic of\r\nonly juveniles and very young of _Mustela frenata_ and _M. erminea_;\r\ntip of tail, and muzzle, only slightly darker than remainder of upper\r\nparts; upper lips broadly edged with color of underparts; pelage\r\ncoarse, harsh and sparse; longitudinal, median, abdominal stripe of\r\nsame color as upper parts present; skull broad and deep; braincase\r\nlarge, rounded, and much inflated anteriorly; palatal region wide;\r\ntympanic bullae less inflated than in any other American species of the\r\nsubgenus; angle of lower jaw reduced; dental formula\r\n\r\n  3  1  2-3  1\r\n  -, -, ---, -; teeth heavy; medial lobe of M1 but slightly larger than\r\n  3  1   2   2\r\n\r\nlateral lobe. See plates 28, 29, 30, 39 and cranial measurements.\r\n\r\n_Geographic variation._--The reddish versus chocolate color of the\r\nupper parts constitutes the only variation of a geographic nature so\r\nfar detected.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--One of the most noteworthy of the several unique characters\r\nof this large, tropical weasel is the longitudinal, median, abdominal\r\nband. The species exhibits the minimum degree of development of certain\r\nfeatures that become progressively less apparent as one proceeds\r\nsouthward from Central America. The relative uniformity of the\r\ncoloration of the upper parts (reduction in intensity of black color on\r\nthe muzzle and tip of the tail) and the reduction of the tympanic\r\nbullae are two cases in point. Viewed dorsally the general outline of\r\nthe skull is most nearly matched by that of the skull of _Mustela\r\nfrenata meridana_ from Venezuela or that of _M. f. helleri_ from Perú.\r\nHowever, the resemblance is not close. The tympanic bullae, although\r\nunique among American weasels, are more like those of _M. f. meridana_\r\nfrom Venezuela than like those of any other kind. The great postorbital\r\nwidth (relatively less in _M. africana_ than in several South American\r\nsubspecies of _Mustela frenata_) and small angular process of the\r\nmandible are characters, in varying degrees, also common to all South\r\nAmerican weasels. Structurally _M. africana_ clearly is more nearly\r\nlike other subspecies of _M. frenata_ from South America than it is\r\nlike any species or subspecies from North America.\r\n\r\n_Mustela africana_ is the most primitive of the American weasels. The\r\ndistinctive cranial and dental characters, excepting the reduction in\r\nnumber of premolars, are of a primitive nature. For example, the\r\nrelatively wide postorbital region, the large braincase that is\r\ninflated anteriorly, and the flattened, tympanic bullae, are points of\r\nresemblance to the holarctic _Mustela erminea_, which species is\r\nregarded as nearest the original stem form; also the mentioned\r\ncharacters correspond to ontogenetic stages passed through by other\r\nweasels. Mostly on these accounts, one is led to look upon _M.\r\nafricana_ as a migrant from North America. It may have become isolated\r\nfrom its original stock, by a water barrier in the Central American\r\nregion, for a length of time sufficient to permit of a degree of\r\ndifferentiation to develop between it and the North American weasels\r\nwhich prevented crossbreeding with the _frenata_ stock when that stock,\r\nat a later time, reached South America. This assumption is suggested\r\nonly by evidence from the Recent specimens. No remains of true weasels\r\n(subgenus _Mustela_) have been recorded from deposits in South America\r\nolder than the Recent period. The alternate possibility, that _M.\r\nafricana_ intergrades with some race of _M. frenata_ in western or\r\nnorthern South America, has been considered and regarded as highly\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nCabrera (1940:15) has made the distinctive structural characters of\r\n_Mustela africana_ basis of the generic name _Grammogale_ to include\r\nthe one species _africana_. I am inclined to accord _Grammogale_ only\r\nsubgeneric rank.\r\n\r\nIt is possibly significant that _Mustela africana_ is intermediate in\r\nseveral respects between _Lyncodon_ and typical _Mustela_. The median,\r\nlongitudinal, abdominal band of the same color as the upper parts in\r\n_M. africana_ and the relative uniformity of the coloration of its\r\nupper parts might be considered as an intermediate stage between the\r\ndark, bicolored (black muzzle and tail tip and brown body) upper parts\r\nand light-colored underparts of the North American weasels on the one\r\nhand and the light, unicolored upper parts and dark-colored underparts\r\nof the Patagonian weasel (_Lyncodon_) on the other hand. The number of\r\npremolars,\r\n\r\n  2-3\r\n  ---, is also intermediate between the numbers\r\n   2\r\n\r\n  3     2\r\n  - and - of the North American _Mustela_ and the Patagonian\r\n  3     2\r\n\r\n_Lyncodon_, respectively. The American _Mustela_ and the Patagonian\r\n_Lyncodon_, respectively. The more medially, as opposed to anteriorly,\r\ndirected medial cusp of P4 (characteristic of approximately half of the\r\nspecimens examined), and the structure of the skull in general of _M.\r\nafricana_ also seem to be morphologically intermediate between those\r\nparts of _Mustela_ and _Lyncodon_.\r\n\r\nOn the chance that _Lyncodon_ is closely enough related to _Mustela_,\r\nto be included in a group with _Mustela_ rather than in a group with\r\n_Grisonella_, it is worth noting that _Lyncodon lujanensis_ Ameghino\r\n(1889:324, 325), from the villa of Lujan and at the city of Córdoba, at\r\neach place in the Pampean [= Pleistocene] formation of Argentine (see\r\nalso Cabrera, 1928:263) is the first and only fossil form of this group\r\nrecorded from the whole of South America. Actually, however, _Lyncodon_\r\nseems to me to be as nearly related to _Grisonella_, if not more so,\r\nthan to _Mustela_. If _Lyncodon_ is more closely related to\r\n_Grisonella_ and _Grison_ than to _Mustela_, then the above remarked\r\nintermediacy in characters of _M. africana_ has more of interest as a\r\ntendency to parallelism than it has of phylogenetic import. Appraisal\r\nof phylogenetic relationships would require appraisal of the ancestral\r\nstem forms of the _Grison_ stock and the _Mustela_ stock. None of\r\neither is known from deposits of the Pliocene, the period of time\r\nimmediately preceding the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nNone of the skulls of _Mustela africana_ seen or figured has the\r\nnasomaxillary sutures entirely obliterated and the specimens would,\r\njudged on this character alone and by analogy with North American\r\nspecies, be regarded as young and subadult. However, the sutures close\r\nat what seems to be a later age than in _M. frenata_ and _M. erminea_.\r\nThe condition of the mammae in the type specimen of _M. stolzmanni_ and\r\nin the specimen from Moyobamba, indicate that they have borne young.\r\nNorth American weasels old enough to bear young lack visible traces of\r\nthe nasomaxillary sutures. I have examined no skulls of _africana_\r\nwith greatly worn teeth and hence cannot say if the sutures are\r\nobliterated in advanced age.\r\n\r\nIf available data be correct, this species is unique within the genus\r\nin that the two sexes are of approximately the same actual size and of\r\nthe same relative proportions in the body and in the skull. There was\r\nno difference between individuals said to be of different sexes from\r\nPará, described and figured by Goeldi (1904:61-62, pls. 1, 2). The\r\nundoubted female, type specimen of _Mustela africana stolzmanni_, is as\r\nlarge as the undoubted male, no. 37475, of the same species, but of a\r\ndifferent subspecies, from Pará, Brazil. All the specimens of _M. a.\r\nafricana_ that I have handled are labeled male and those of _M. a.\r\nstolzmanni_ female. More material may show that the female is smaller\r\nthan the male, as is the case in all near relatives of _M. africana_.\r\n\r\nLittle has been recorded concerning the habits of this species. Tate\r\n(1931:254) states that a live individual which he saw in a cage at Pará\r\nhad been captured \"swimming in the salt water of the estuary about half\r\na mile away from the shore.\" On the label of the specimen from\r\nMoyobamba, there appears: \"caught in Willow tree.\"\r\n\r\n_Subspecies examined._--All described forms, of which there are two.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela africana africana= Desmarest\r\n\r\nTropical Weasel\r\n\r\nPlates 28, 29, 30 and 41\r\n\r\n    _Mustela africana_ Desmarest, Nouv.

Except for the loss of the distal part of\r\n     the tail, and fading because of exposure to light, the specimen\r\n     was in good condition.

See figure 29 on page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _Mustela\r\n     frenata_, the only other geographically adjacent species of the\r\n     genus, in presence of median, longitudinal, abdominal stripe of\r\n     same color as upper parts and naked foot-soles, in absence of p2\r\n     and in reduced size of tympanic bullae (see pls. 29 and 30) and\r\n     from _Mustela africana stolzmanni_ by lighter color of upper parts\r\n     which although near Chestnut-Brown are in adults 10' _l_ (darker\r\n     in yg. M. C. Z., no. 30802), instead of 11' _n_ as in _M. a.\r\n     stolzmanni_.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--This is a relatively large weasel. Goeldi\r\n     (1897:559) gives the total length of the type specimen of his _P.\r\n     b. paraensis_, a female, as 520 mm. (495 in the flesh) and, by\r\n     computation from his figures, the length of the tail as 200 (205\r\n     in the flesh). These measurements probably include the hairs on\r\n     the tip of the tail as probably also do the measurements given of\r\n     two other specimens (see Goeldi, 1904:62). One of these specimens,\r\n     a female, measured: Total length, 520; length of tail, 200. The\r\n     other specimen, a male, measured: Total length, 510; length of\r\n     tail, 200. The skin of no. 37475, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., a male,\r\n     has the following measurements written on the attached label:\r\n     Total length, 548; length of tail, 234; length of hind foot, 56.\r\n     The hairs project 20 mm. beyond the tip of the last vertebra of\r\n     the tail and probably are included in the measurements of total\r\n     length and length of tail. Collectors' measurements of a young\r\n     male from Cametá, and a subadult labeled as male, from Pará\r\n     Murutucu, are respectively as follows: 500, 430; 210, 190; 50 and\r\n     54.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--Foot-soles naked, except for a few scattered hairs\r\n     on ventral sides of interdigital membranes; length of claws,\r\n     measured on concave sides, not more than one and one-fifth times\r\n     depth of claws measured at bases; carpal vibrissae not extending\r\n     beyond apical pad of first digit (not beyond hypothenar pad except\r\n     in one young specimen); longest facial vibrissae not extending to\r\n     posterior margin of ear; superior genal tuft not found, hairiness\r\n     of foot-soles as shown in figure 22.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--Upper parts near (10 l) Chestnut-Brown and relatively\r\n     uniform since tip of tail and muzzle are only slightly darker than\r\n     remainder; underparts with longitudinal stripe of same color as\r\n     upper parts extending along median line of belly from throat or\r\n     breast posteriorly to within 40 to 50 millimeters of anus.\r\n     Underparts otherwise near (20\" _a_) Olive-Ocher (lips and chin\r\n     whiter in one young specimen). Color of underparts extends\r\n     distally on median sides of forelegs to bare foot-soles and on\r\n     median side of hind legs two-thirds of distance from knee to\r\n     ankle. Upper lips broadly edged with whitish, which color passes\r\n     posteriorly below and not touching eye to ventral margin of concha\r\n     of ear. An inverted, basally broad, V-shaped extension passes\r\n     upward 4 millimeters, just posterior to the eye.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--See measurements (plates 28-30). Male: (based\r\n     on 3 adult and subadult topotypes and figures and descriptions\r\n     published by Goeldi, 1897 and 1904.) Weight, 7.0 grams; basilar\r\n     length, 45.8 (44.6-47.8); skull broad and deep; braincase large,\r\n     rounded, and much inflated anteriorly; distance from postorbital\r\n     process to anterior, nasal notch approximately equal to breadth\r\n     across exoccipital condyles; palatal region wide; tympanic bullae\r\n     less inflated than in any other species; mastoid bone, laterally,\r\n     concave; length of upper tooth-rows in adults and subadults less\r\n     than breadth of palate measured between two outer margins of\r\n     fourth upper premolars; alveolar distance between C1 and P4 less\r\n     than length of P4; teeth heavy; medial lobe of M1 only slightly\r\n     larger than lateral lobe; deuterocone of P4 heavy and often\r\n     inclined mesially; p2 absent (P2 present above on both sides in\r\n     only one of seven specimens seen or described); lower jaw heavy;\r\n     masseteric fossa not extending anteriorly to posterior fourth of\r\n     talonid of m1; paraconid of m1 low and base of cleft between it\r\n     and protoconid relatively low on tooth.\r\n\r\n     Female: No skull examined but from figures published by Goeldi\r\n     (1904, pl. 2), apparently as described in the male.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Desmarest in 1818 gave a remarkably good description of\r\nthis animal which he named as a new species, _Mustela africana_, but\r\nmistakenly indicated that the single specimen known to him came\r\noriginally from Africa. Until 1913 the name was applied, wrongly, to\r\nweasels of northern Africa or to those of the Azores Islands and St.\r\nThomas Island. In that year Cabrera (1913:429) identified the species\r\nwith the one later named _Putorius (Mustela) brasiliensis paraensis_ by\r\nGoeldi (1897:556, pl. 21) from Pará, Brazil. Despite Cabrera's clear\r\nidentification in 1913, and his later mention of the correct\r\napplication of the name _Mustela africana_, it was not correctly\r\nemployed by other authors, including myself who even as late as 1936\r\n(p. 111) instead used Goeldi's name. In 1937 Mr. Cabrera called my\r\nattention to his published account of _Mustela africana_ and so\r\npermitted me to examine the type specimen in the Paris Museum, whither\r\nI was bound when I received Mr. Cabrera's letter. My own examination of\r\nthe specimen fully confirmed the conclusions published by Cabrera\r\n(1913:429).\r\n\r\nAs a matter of historical interest, however, it is worth noting that\r\nCabrera (1913) originally supposed the type specimen to have been taken\r\nas booty of war from Portugal by the French and that Cabrera later, at\r\nthe request of P. Trouessart, pointed out (1914:176) that the specimen\r\nhad been acquired in exchange (\"a cambio\") since according to Dr.\r\nTrouessart the Museum register showed that offer had been made to\r\nPortugal to return this and other specimens but that Portugal had\r\nreplied that it had nothing to reclaim. Dr. P. Rode in August, 1937, at\r\nthe Paris Museum, gave it to me as his opinion that the specimen had\r\nbeen an outright gift from the \"Cabinet de Lisbonne\" to E. Geoffroy\r\nSt.-Hilaire on his trip to Portugal in 1808 when he was given also from\r\nthe same cabinet several primates, all from Brazil. Of the labels\r\nattached to the pedestal on which the specimen is mounted, that of most\r\nancient appearance is glued to the bottom of the stand and bears in a\r\nhand apparently written before Trouessart's entries on the same label,\r\nthe information \"Du Cabinet de Lisbonne 1808\" and \"J. H. S. 1809.\"\r\n\r\nThe opened mouth of the mounted specimen permits one to determine that\r\nP2 is absent on each side above. The stuffed scrotal pouch and hair\r\nprojecting downward about the preputial opening clearly show the animal\r\nto have been a male. The least faded portions of the mounted specimen,\r\nits sides, are of the same reddish color as characterizes adults from\r\nPará and not of the darker chocolate color of specimens of _M.\r\nstolzmanni_ from Perú. The specimen is indistinguishable from topotypes\r\nof _P. paraensis_ of Goeldi and his name will have to fall as a synonym\r\nof _Mustela africana_ Desmarest.\r\n\r\nGoeldi gave an extended description, with figures of the skull, head,\r\nand entire animal, when he named _paraensis_. As his account shows, he\r\nwas unaware that Taczanowski had described a similar weasel from the\r\nheadwaters of the Amazon, or for that matter that any weasel excepting\r\n_Mustela affinis_ Gray, had been found in South America. Goeldi's later\r\naccount of additional specimens (1904:61, pls. 1, 2) gives much useful\r\ninformation about the animal. Photographs of several specimens and\r\nphotographs and detailed measurements of several skulls are presented\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nPará, and Cametá, Brazil, places from which _Mustela africana africana_\r\nis known, are nearly 2000 miles from the localities in eastern Perú and\r\neastern Ecuador from which _M. a. stolzmanni_ is known, and no\r\nspecimens, from intermediate localities, are available to show actual\r\nintergradation of the two. However, the similarity in structure of the\r\ntwo weasels is so great as to indicate close affinity. Furthermore, it\r\nis understood that environmental conditions at and between the two\r\nlocalities are similar. These considerations, in the light of our\r\nknowledge of actual intergradation of geographic races of weasels in\r\nother places, cause me to treat, with a feeling of assurance, _M.\r\nafricana_ [= _P. paraensis_ Goeldi] and _M. stolzmanni_ Taczanowski as\r\nsubspecies of a single species. M. Rodolpho Legueira Rodríguez writes\r\nme, under date of June 16, 1928, that the type specimen of _Putorius\r\n(Mustela) brasiliensis paraensis_ Goeldi is stuffed and preserved in a\r\n\"vitrine\" at the Museum Goeldi (Museum Paraense) De Historia Natural e\r\nEthnographia, Pará, Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe one young specimen seen, that from Cametá, is darker colored than\r\nany of the four older specimens examined. It is almost exactly the\r\nChestnut Brown of Ridgway (1912) and therefore approaches closely in\r\ncolor the adult specimens of _M. a. stolzmanni_. This same tendency to\r\ngreater richness of color in young than in adults is seen also in\r\n_Mustela frenata_.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 5, all from eastern Brazil,\r\n     as follows: Pará, 2 (1[2], 1[7]); Pará Murutucu, 1[7]; Río\r\n     Tocantins, Cametá, 1[75]; type specimen, 1[84].\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mustela africana stolzmanni= Taczanowski\r\n\r\nTropical Weasel\r\n\r\nPlates 39 and 40\r\n\r\n    _Mustela stolzmanni_ Taczanowski, Proc.

Stolzmann.\r\n\r\n     The skull (plate 40), mounted with the skin but removed by me for\r\n     study, consists of the premaxillae, maxillae, two halves of the\r\n     lower jaw and dentition. Of these parts, right m2, left coronoid\r\n     process, right P4 and M1 and adjacent part of maxilla are lost.\r\n     The skin is well mounted, in a good state of preservation and\r\n     shows no fading due to exposure to light. Inguinal mammae are\r\n     distinctly shown on the skin and prove that the specimen is a\r\n     female. Except for a few scattered hairs on the lower throat, a\r\n     spot six by eight millimeters on the medial side of the region of\r\n     the olecranon of the left foreleg and another of similar size in\r\n     the left axilla, the underparts are, excepting the ventral\r\n     longitudinal, abdominal stripe, unmarked by color of the upper\r\n     parts.\r\n\r\n     _Range._--Known from the Tropical Life-zone of eastern Ecuador and\r\n     Perú from Jatun Yacu south to Valle del Perené. See figure 29 on\r\n     page 221.\r\n\r\n     _Characters for ready recognition._--Differs from _Mustela\r\n     frenata_, the only other geographically adjacent species of the\r\n     genus, in presence of median, longitudinal, abdominal stripe of\r\n     same color as upper parts and naked foot soles, in absence of p2\r\n     and in reduced size of tympanic bullae (see pls. 28, 29, 30, 39\r\n     and 40) and from _Mustela africana africana_ by darker color of\r\n     upper parts which, although near Chestnut Brown, are 11' _n_\r\n     instead of 10' _l_ as in _M. a. africana_.\r\n\r\n     _Description._--_Size._--Male: unknown.\r\n\r\n     Female: Taczanowski (1881:836) gives, among others, the following\r\n     measurements of the type specimen: Total length, 523, length of\r\n     body, 260; length of tail without hair, 190 (with hair 224);\r\n     length of hind foot, 54. Whether or not the measurements were\r\n     taken from the animal when in the flesh I do not know. Allowing\r\n     for shrinkage of hind feet and changes due to the posture of the\r\n     now mounted specimen, I get from it essentially the same\r\n     measurements. Collectors' measurements of a subadult from\r\n     Moyobamba and a young female from Valle del Perené, are\r\n     respectively, as follows: 469, 415; 184, 160; 57, 52. My own\r\n     measurements of the dry hind feet on the skins are respectively,\r\n     48 and 49.\r\n\r\n     _Externals._--As described in _M. a. africana_ except that the\r\n     length of the concave sides of the claws are approximately one and\r\n     one-fourth times the depth; thus the claws are relatively longer\r\n     than in _M. a. africana_.\r\n\r\n     _Color._--As described in _M. a. africana_ with the following\r\n     noted exceptions: Upper parts near (11' _n_) Chestnut-Brown; area\r\n     of lighter ventral coloration on the throat and sides of head less\r\n     strongly tinged with yellow; pelage more dense, finer and softer\r\n     than in _M. a. africana_.\r\n\r\n     _Skull and teeth._--Male: Skull unknown.\r\n\r\n     Female: See measurements and plate 39 and 40. As described in male\r\n     of _Mustela africana africana_ except that: Weight, 4.7 grams. As\r\n     contrasted with _M. a. africana_, the dentition of the lower jaw\r\n     is lighter; the transverse diameter of m2 is 1.2 mm. in the type\r\n     and also in the specimen from Moyobamba as against 1.5 to 1.7 in\r\n     three male topotypes of _M. a. africana_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--After the Polish naturalist, Stolzmann, in the course of\r\nhis explorations in Perú, obtained the single specimen which was made\r\nthe type, no other naturalist, so far as known, visited the type\r\nlocality until thirty-two years later when Wilfred H. Osgood and M. P.\r\nAnderson spent more than a month collecting at Yurimaguas (see Osgood,\r\n1914:147), but secured no topotypes of this little-known weasel. C. O.\r\nSchunke took the second specimen in the Valle del Perené in April,\r\n1921; L. Rutter on January 25, 1924, took the third specimen, and W.\r\nClark-MacIntyre took the fourth specimen on the Jatun Yacu. This\r\nobscure place name is shown on the map (fig. 4, page 827) published by\r\nBrown (1941) and is the stream flowing from the west to the town of\r\nNapo. Napo is situated at approximately 1° 2' S and 77° 49' W.\r\n\r\nIn the female from Moyobamba there are only 3 pairs of mammae. One pair\r\nis inguinal and two pairs are on the posterior part of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nTaczanowski (1881:836) relates that this species was taken in the\r\nforest to which it appears to be restricted since the inhabitants of\r\nthe village did not know of the animal. He points out also that the\r\npreviously known Peruvian species [_M. f. macrura_ and _M. f. agilis_]\r\nlive in the treeless territory of eight to eleven thousand feet\r\naltitude whereas _M. stolzmanni_ was found in the humid forest of the\r\ngreat plain of the Maynas at an elevation of 500 feet or less above sea\r\nlevel. The frontal sinuses of the specimens seen reveal no malformation\r\nas a result of infestation by parasites.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 4, as follows:\r\n\r\n     =Ecuador=: R.
