When I was not more than\r\nten years old, a distant relative of our family, hoping to astonish my\r\ninexperience, constructed a simple microscope for me by drilling in a\r\ndisk of copper a small hole in which a drop of pure water was sustained\r\nby capillary attraction. This very primitive apparatus, magnifying some\r\nfifty diameters, presented, it is true, only indistinct and imperfect\r\nforms, but still sufficiently wonderful to work up my imagination to a\r\npreternatural state of excitement.\r\n\r\nSeeing me so interested in this rude instrument, my cousin explained to\r\nme all that he knew about the principles of the microscope, related to\r\nme a few of the wonders which had been accomplished through its agency,\r\nand ended by promising to send me one regularly constructed, immediately\r\non his return to the city. I counted the days, the hours, the minutes\r\nthat intervened between that promise and his departure.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I was not idle. Every transparent substance that bore the\r\nremotest resemblance to a lens I eagerly seized upon, and employed\r\nin vain attempts to realize that instrument the theory of whose\r\nconstruction I as yet only vaguely comprehended. All panes of\r\nglass containing those oblate spheroidal knots familiarly known as\r\n\"bull's-eyes\" were ruthlessly destroyed in the hope of obtaining lenses\r\nof marvelous power. I even went so far as to extract the crystalline\r\nhumor from the eyes of fishes and animals, and endeavored to press\r\nit into the microscopic service. I plead guilty to having stolen the\r\nglasses from my Aunt Agatha's spectacles, with a dim idea of grinding\r\nthem into lenses of wondrous magnifying properties--in which attempt it\r\nis scarcely necessary to say that I totally failed.\r\n\r\nAt last the promised instrument came. It was of that order known as\r\nField's simple microscope, and had cost perhaps about fifteen dollars.\r\nAs far as educational purposes went, a better apparatus could not\r\nhave been selected. Accompanying it was a small treatise on the\r\nmicroscope--its history, uses, and discoveries. I comprehended then for\r\nthe first time the \"Arabian Nights' Entertainments.\" The dull veil of\r\nordinary existence that hung across the world seemed suddenly to\r\nroll away, and to lay bare a land of enchantments. I felt toward my\r\ncompanions as the seer might feel toward the ordinary masses of men.\r\nI held conversations with nature in a tongue which they could not\r\nunderstand. I was in daily communication with living wonders such as\r\nthey never imagined in their wildest visions, I penetrated beyond the\r\nexternal portal of things, and roamed through the sanctuaries. Where\r\nthey beheld only a drop of rain slowly rolling down the window-glass,\r\nI saw a universe of beings animated with all the passions common to\r\nphysical life, and convulsing their minute sphere with struggles as\r\nfierce and protracted as those of men. In the common spots of mould,\r\nwhich my mother, good housekeeper that she was, fiercely scooped\r\naway from her jam-pots, there abode for me, under the name of mildew,\r\nenchanted gardens, filled with dells and avenues of the densest foliage\r\nand most astonishing verdure, while from the fantastic boughs of these\r\nmicroscopic forests hung strange fruits glittering with green and silver\r\nand gold.\r\n\r\nIt was no scientific thirst that at this time filled my mind. It was the\r\npure enjoyment of a poet to whom a world of wonders has been disclosed.\r\nI talked of my solitary pleasures to none. Alone with my microscope, I\r\ndimmed my sight, day after day and night after night, poring over the\r\nmarvels which it unfolded to me. I was like one who, having discovered\r\nthe ancient Eden still existing in all its primitive glory, should\r\nresolve to enjoy it in solitude, and never betray to mortal the secret\r\nof its locality. The rod of my life was bent at this moment. I destined\r\nmyself to be a microscopist.\r\n\r\nOf course, like every novice, I fancied myself a discoverer. I was\r\nignorant at the time of the thousands of acute intellects engaged in the\r\nsame pursuit as myself, and with the advantage of instruments a thousand\r\ntimes more powerful than mine. The names of Leeuwenhoek, Williamson,\r\nSpencer, Ehrenberg, Schultz, Dujardin, Schact, and Schleiden were then\r\nentirely unknown to me, or, if known, I was ignorant of their patient\r\nand wonderful researches. In every fresh specimen of cryptogamia which\r\nI placed beneath my instrument I believed that I discovered wonders\r\nof which the world was as yet ignorant. I remember well the thrill\r\nof delight and admiration that shot through me the first time that I\r\ndiscovered the common wheel animalcule (Rotifera vulgaris) expanding\r\nand contracting its flexible spokes and seemingly rotating through the\r\nwater. Alas! as I grew older, and obtained some works treating of my\r\nfavorite study, I found that I was only on the threshold of a science\r\nto the investigation of which some of the greatest men of the age were\r\ndevoting their lives and intellects.\r\n\r\nAs I grew up, my parents, who saw but little likelihood of anything\r\npractical resulting from the examination of bits of moss and drops of\r\nwater through a brass tube and a piece of glass, were anxious that I\r\nshould choose a profession.\r\n\r\nIt was their desire that I should enter the counting-house of my uncle,\r\nEthan Blake, a prosperous merchant, who carried on business in New\r\nYork. This suggestion I decisively combated. I had no taste for trade; I\r\nshould only make a failure; in short, I refused to become a merchant.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary for me to select some pursuit. My parents were\r\nstaid New England people, who insisted on the necessity of labor, and\r\ntherefore, although, thanks to the bequest of my poor Aunt Agatha, I\r\nshould, on coming of age, inherit a small fortune sufficient to place me\r\nabove want, it was decided that, instead of waiting for this, I should\r\nact the nobler part, and employ the intervening years in rendering\r\nmyself independent.\r\n\r\nAfter much cogitation, I complied with the wishes of my family, and\r\nselected a profession. I determined to study medicine at the New York\r\nAcademy. This disposition of my future suited me. A removal from my\r\nrelatives would enable me to dispose of my time as I pleased without\r\nfear of detection. As long as I paid my Academy fees, I might shirk\r\nattending the lectures if I chose; and, as I never had the remotest\r\nintention of standing an examination, there was no danger of my being\r\n\"plucked.\" Besides, a metropolis was the place for me. There I could\r\nobtain excellent instruments, the newest publications, intimacy with\r\nmen of pursuits kindred with my own--in short, all things necessary to\r\nensure a profitable devotion of my life to my beloved science. I had an\r\nabundance of money, few desires that were not bounded by my illuminating\r\nmirror on one side and my object-glass on the other; what, therefore,\r\nwas to prevent my becoming an illustrious investigator of the veiled\r\nworlds? It was with the most buoyant hope that I left my New England\r\nhome and established myself in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMy first step, of course, was to find suitable apartments. These I\r\nobtained, after a couple of days' search, in Fourth Avenue; a very\r\npretty second floor, unfurnished, containing sitting-room, bedroom,\r\nand a smaller apartment which I intended to fit up as a laboratory. I\r\nfurnished my lodgings simply, but rather elegantly, and then devoted\r\nall my energies to the adornment of the temple of my worship. I visited\r\nPike, the celebrated optician, and passed in review his splendid\r\ncollection of microscopes--Field's Compound, Hingham's, Spencer's,\r\nNachet's Binocular (that founded on the principles of the stereoscope),\r\nand at length fixed upon that form known as Spencer's Trunnion\r\nMicroscope, as combining the greatest number of improvements with an\r\nalmost perfect freedom from tremor. Along with this I purchased\r\nevery possible accessory--draw-tubes, micrometers, a _camera lucida_,\r\nlever-stage, achromatic condensers, white cloud illuminators, prisms,\r\nparabolic condensers, polarizing apparatus, forceps, aquatic boxes,\r\nfishing-tubes, with a host of other articles, all of which would have\r\nbeen useful in the hands of an experienced microscopist, but, as I\r\nafterward discovered, were not of the slightest present value to me. It\r\ntakes years of practice to know how to use a complicated microscope. The\r\noptician looked suspiciously at me as I made these valuable purchases.\r\nHe evidently was uncertain whether to set me down as some scientific\r\ncelebrity or a madman. I think he was inclined to the latter belief. I\r\nsuppose I was mad. Every great genius is mad upon the subject in which\r\nhe is greatest. The unsuccessful madman is disgraced and called a\r\nlunatic.\r\n\r\nMad or not, I set myself to work with a zeal which few scientific\r\nstudents have ever equaled. I had everything to learn relative to the\r\ndelicate study upon which I had embarked--a study involving the most\r\nearnest patience, the most rigid analytic powers, the steadiest hand,\r\nthe most untiring eye, the most refined and subtle manipulation.\r\n\r\nFor a long time half my apparatus lay inactively on the shelves of\r\nmy laboratory, which was now most amply furnished with every possible\r\ncontrivance for facilitating my investigations. The fact was that I did\r\nnot know how to use some of my scientific implements--never having been\r\ntaught microscopies--and those whose use I understood theoretically were\r\nof little avail until by practice I could attain the necessary delicacy\r\nof handling. Still, such was the fury of my ambition, such the untiring\r\nperseverance of my experiments, that, difficult of credit as it may\r\nbe, in the course of one year I became theoretically and practically an\r\naccomplished microscopist.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of my labors, in which I submitted specimens of every\r\nsubstance that came under my observation to the action of my lenses, I\r\nbecame a discoverer--in a small way, it is true, for I was very young,\r\nbut still a discoverer. It was I who destroyed Ehrenberg's theory that\r\nthe _Volvox globator_ was an animal, and proved that his \"monads\" with\r\nstomachs and eyes were merely phases of the formation of a vegetable\r\ncell, and were, when they reached their mature state, incapable of\r\nthe act of conjugation, or any true generative act, without which no\r\norganism rising to any stage of life higher than vegetable can be said\r\nto be complete. It was I who resolved the singular problem of rotation\r\nin the cells and hairs of plants into ciliary attraction, in spite of\r\nthe assertions of Wenham and others that my explanation was the result\r\nof an optical illusion.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these discoveries, laboriously and painfully made\r\nas they were, I felt horribly dissatisfied. At every step I found\r\nmyself stopped by the imperfections of my instruments. Like all active\r\nmicroscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is a common\r\ncomplaint against many such that they supply the defects of their\r\ninstruments with the creations of their brains. I imagined depths beyond\r\ndepths in nature which the limited power of my lenses prohibited me from\r\nexploring. I lay awake at night constructing imaginary micro-scopes\r\nof immeasurable power, with which I seemed to pierce through all the\r\nenvelopes of matter down to its original atom. How I cursed those\r\nimperfect mediums which necessity through ignorance compelled me to\r\nuse! How I longed to discover the secret of some perfect lens, whose\r\nmagnifying power should be limited only by the resolvability of the\r\nobject, and which at the same time should be free from spherical and\r\nchromatic aberrations--in short, from all the obstacles over which the\r\npoor microscopist finds himself continually stumbling! I felt convinced\r\nthat the simple microscope, composed of a single lens of such vast yet\r\nperfect power, was possible of construction. To attempt to bring the\r\ncompound microscope up to such a pitch would have been commencing at the\r\nwrong end; this latter being simply a partially successful endeavor\r\nto remedy those very defects of the simplest instrument which, if\r\nconquered, would leave nothing to be desired.\r\n\r\nIt was in this mood of mind that I became a constructive microscopist.\r\nAfter another year passed in this new pursuit, experimenting on every\r\nimaginable substance--glass, gems, flints, crystals, artificial crystals\r\nformed of the alloy of various vitreous materials--in short, having\r\nconstructed as many varieties of lenses as Argus had eyes--I found\r\nmyself precisely where I started, with nothing gained save an extensive\r\nknowledge of glass-making. I was almost dead with despair. My parents\r\nwere surprised at my apparent want of progress in my medical studies\r\n(I had not attended one lecture since my arrival in the city), and the\r\nexpenses of my mad pursuit had been so great as to embarrass me very\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\nI was in this frame of mind one day, experimenting in my laboratory on\r\na small diamond--that stone, from its great refracting power, having\r\nalways occupied my attention more than any other--when a young\r\nFrenchman who lived on the floor above me, and who was in the habit of\r\noccasionally visiting me, entered the room.\r\n\r\nI think that Jules Simon was a Jew. He had many traits of the Hebrew\r\ncharacter: a love of jewelry, of dress, and of good living. There was\r\nsomething mysterious about him. He always had something to sell, and yet\r\nwent into excellent society. When I say sell, I should perhaps have said\r\npeddle; for his operations were generally confined to the disposal of\r\nsingle articles--a picture, for instance, or a rare carving in ivory, or\r\na pair of duelling-pistols, or the dress of a Mexican _caballero_. When\r\nI was first furnishing my rooms, he paid me a visit, which ended in my\r\npurchasing an antique silver lamp, which he assured me was a Cellini--it\r\nwas handsome enough even for that--and some other knick-knacks for my\r\nsitting-room. Why Simon should pursue this petty trade I never could\r\nimagine. He apparently had plenty of money, and had the _entree_ of the\r\nbest houses in the city--taking care, however, I suppose, to drive no\r\nbargains within the enchanted circle of the Upper Ten. I came at length\r\nto the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask to cover some\r\ngreater object, and even went so far as to believe my young acquaintance\r\nto be implicated in the slave-trade. That, however, was none of my\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, Simon entered my room in a state of\r\nconsiderable excitement.\r\n\r\n\"_Ah! mon ami!_\" he cried, before I could even offer him the ordinary\r\nsalutation, \"it has occurred to me to be the witness of the most\r\nastonishing things in the world. I promenade myself to the house of\r\nMadame ------. How does the little animal--_le renard_--name himself in\r\nthe Latin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vulpes,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! yes--Vulpes. I promenade myself to the house of Madame Vulpes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The spirit medium?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the great medium. Great heavens! what a woman! I write on a\r\nslip of paper many of questions concerning affairs of the most\r\nsecret--affairs that conceal themselves in the abysses of my heart the\r\nmost profound; and behold, by example, what occurs? This devil of a\r\nwoman makes me replies the most truthful to all of them. She talks to me\r\nof things that I do not love to talk of to myself. What am I to think? I\r\nam fixed to the earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I to understand you, M. Simon, that this Mrs. Vulpes replied to\r\nquestions secretly written by you, which questions related to events\r\nknown only to yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! more than that, more than that,\" he answered, with an air of some\r\nalarm. \"She related to me things--But,\" he added after a pause, and\r\nsuddenly changing his manner, \"why occupy ourselves with these follies?\r\nIt was all the biology, without doubt. It goes without saying that it\r\nhas not my credence. But why are we here, _mon ami?_ It has occurred to\r\nme to discover the most beautiful thing as you can imagine--a vase with\r\ngreen lizards on it, composed by the great Bernard Palissy. It is in my\r\napartment; let us mount. I go to show it to you.\"\r\n\r\nI followed Simon mechanically; but my thoughts were far from Palissy and\r\nhis enameled ware, although I, like him, was seeking in the dark a great\r\ndiscovery. This casual mention of the spiritualist, Madame Vulpes,\r\nset me on a new track. What if, through communication with more subtle\r\norganisms than my own, I could reach at a single bound the goal which\r\nperhaps a life, of agonizing mental toil would never enable me to\r\nattain?\r\n\r\nWhile purchasing the Palissy vase from my friend Simon, I was mentally\r\narranging a visit to Madame Vulpes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTwo evenings after this, thanks to an arrangement by letter and the\r\npromise of an ample fee, I found Madame Vulpes awaiting me at her\r\nresidence alone. She was a coarse-featured woman, with keen and rather\r\ncruel dark eyes, and an exceedingly sensual expression about her mouth\r\nand under jaw. She received me in perfect silence, in an apartment on\r\nthe ground floor, very sparsely furnished. In the centre of the room,\r\nclose to where Mrs. Vulpes sat, there was a common round mahogany table.\r\nIf I had come for the purpose of sweeping her chimney, the woman could\r\nnot have looked more indifferent to my appearance. There was no attempt\r\nto inspire the visitor with awe. Everything bore a simple and practical\r\naspect. This intercourse with the spiritual world was evidently as\r\nfamiliar an occupation with Mrs. Vulpes as eating her dinner or riding\r\nin an omnibus.\r\n\r\n\"You come for a communication, Mr. Linley?\" said the medium, in a dry,\r\nbusinesslike tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\"By appointment--yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of communication do you want--a written one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I wish for a written one.\"\r\n\r\n\"From any particular spirit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever known this spirit on this earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never. He died long before I was born. I wish merely to obtain from\r\nhim some information which he ought to be able to give better than any\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you seat yourself at the table, Mr. Lin-ley,\" said the medium,\r\n\"and place your hands upon it?\"\r\n\r\nI obeyed, Mrs. Vulpes being seated opposite to me, with her hands also\r\non the table. We remained thus for about a minute and a half, when a\r\nviolent succession of raps came on the table, on the back of my chair,\r\non the floor immediately under my feet, and even on the window-panes.\r\nMrs. Vulpes smiled composedly.\r\n\r\n\"They are very strong to-night,\" she remarked. \"You are fortunate.\" She\r\nthen continued, \"Will the spirits communicate with this gentleman?\"\r\n\r\nVigorous affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"Will the particular spirit he desires to speak with communicate?\"\r\n\r\nA very confused rapping followed this question.\r\n\r\n\"I know what they mean,\" said Mrs. Vulpes, addressing herself to me;\r\n\"they wish you to write down the name of the particular spirit that\r\nyou desire to converse with. Is that so?\" she added, speaking to her\r\ninvisible guests.\r\n\r\nThat it was so was evident from the numerous affirmatory responses.\r\nWhile this was going on, I tore a slip from my pocket-book and scribbled\r\na name under the table.\r\n\r\n\"Will this spirit communicate in writing with this gentleman?\" asked the\r\nmedium once more.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's pause, her hand seemed to be seized with a violent\r\ntremor, shaking so forcibly that the table vibrated. She said that a\r\nspirit had seized her hand and would write. I handed her some sheets of\r\npaper that were on the table and a pencil. The latter she held loosely\r\nin her hand, which presently began to move over the paper with a\r\nsingular and seemingly involuntary motion. After a few moments had\r\nelapsed, she handed me the paper, on which I found written, in a large,\r\nuncultivated hand, the words, \"He is not here, but has been sent for.\"\r\nA pause of a minute or so ensued, during which Mrs. Vulpes remained\r\nperfectly silent, but the raps continued at regular intervals. When the\r\nshort period I mention had elapsed, the hand of the medium was again\r\nseized with its convulsive tremor, and she wrote, under this strange\r\ninfluence, a few words on the paper, which she handed to me. They were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am here. Question me.\r\n\r\n\"_Leeuwenhoek_.\"\r\n\r\nI was astounded. The name was identical with that I had written beneath\r\nthe table, and carefully kept concealed. Neither was it at all probable\r\nthat an uncultivated woman like Mrs. Vulpes should know even the name\r\nof the great father of microscopies. It may have been biology; but\r\nthis theory was soon doomed to be destroyed. I wrote on my slip--still\r\nconcealing it from Mrs. Vulpes--a series of questions which, to avoid\r\ntediousness, I shall place with the responses, in the order in which\r\nthey occurred:\r\n\r\nI.--Can the microscope be brought to perfection?\r\n\r\nSpirit--Yes.\r\n\r\nI.--Am I destined to accomplish this great task?\r\n\r\nSpirit.--You are.\r\n\r\nI.--I wish to know how to proceed to attain this end. For the love which\r\nyou bear to science, help me!\r\n\r\nSpirit--A diamond of one hundred and forty carats, submitted to\r\nelectro-magnetic currents for a long period, will experience a\r\nrearrangement of its atoms _inter se_ and from that stone you will form\r\nthe universal lens.\r\n\r\nI.--Will great discoveries result from the use of such a lens?\r\n\r\nSpirit--So great that all that has gone before is as nothing.\r\n\r\nI.--But the refractive power of the diamond is so immense that the image\r\nwill be formed within the lens. How is that difficulty to be surmounted?\r\n\r\nSpirit--Pierce the lens through its axis, and the difficulty is\r\nobviated. The image will be formed in the pierced space, which will\r\nitself serve as a tube to look through. Now I am called. Good-night.\r\n\r\nI can not at all describe the effect that these extraordinary\r\ncommunications had upon me. I felt completely bewildered. No biological\r\ntheory could account for the _discovery_ of the lens. The medium might,\r\nby means of biological _rapport_ with my mind, have gone so far as to\r\nread my questions and reply to them coherently. But biology could\r\nnot enable her to discover that magnetic currents would so alter the\r\ncrystals of the diamond as to remedy its previous defects and admit of\r\nits being polished into a perfect lens. Some such theory may have\r\npassed through my head, it is true; but if so, I had forgotten it. In\r\nmy excited condition of mind there was no course left but to become a\r\nconvert, and it was in a state of the most painful nervous exaltation\r\nthat I left the medium's house that evening. She accompanied me to\r\nthe door, hoping that I was satisfied. The raps followed us as we went\r\nthrough the hall, sounding on the balusters, the flooring, and even the\r\nlintels of the door. I hastily expressed my satisfaction, and escaped\r\nhurriedly into the cool night air. I walked home with but one thought\r\npossessing me--how to obtain a diamond of the immense size required. My\r\nentire means multiplied a hundred times over would have been inadequate\r\nto its purchase. Besides, such stones are rare, and become historical. I\r\ncould find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThere was a light in Simon's room as I entered my house. A vague\r\nimpulse urged me to visit him. As I opened the door of his sitting-room\r\nunannounced, he was bending, with his back toward me, over a Carcel\r\nlamp, apparently engaged in minutely examining some object which he held\r\nin his hands. As I entered, he started suddenly, thrust his hand into\r\nhis breast pocket, and turned to me with a face crimson with confusion.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I cried, \"poring over the miniature of some fair lady? Well,\r\ndon't blush so much; I won't ask to see it.\"\r\n\r\nSimon laughed awkwardly enough, but made none of the negative\r\nprotestations usual on such occasions. He asked me to take a seat.\r\n\r\n\"Simon,\" said I, \"I have just come from Madame Vulpes.\"\r\n\r\nThis time Simon turned as white as a sheet, and seemed stupefied, as\r\nif a sudden electric shock had smitten him. He babbled some incoherent\r\nwords, and went hastily to a small closet where he usually kept his\r\nliquors. Although astonished at his emotion, I was too preoccupied with\r\nmy own idea to pay much attention to anything else.\r\n\r\n\"You say truly when you call Madame Vulpes a devil of a woman,\" I\r\ncontinued. \"Simon, she told me wonderful things to-night, or rather\r\nwas the means of telling me wonderful things. Ah! if I could only get a\r\ndiamond that weighed one hundred and forty carats!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had the sigh with which I uttered this desire died upon my lips\r\nwhen Simon, with the aspect of a wild beast, glared at me savagely, and,\r\nrushing to the mantelpiece, where some foreign weapons hung on the wall,\r\ncaught up a Malay creese, and brandished it furiously before him.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he cried in French, into which he always broke when excited. \"No!\r\nyou shall not have it! You are perfidious! You have consulted with that\r\ndemon, and desire my treasure! But I will die first! Me, I am brave! You\r\ncan not make me fear!\"\r\n\r\nAll this, uttered in a loud voice, trembling with excitement, astounded\r\nme. I saw at a glance that I had accidentally trodden upon the edges of\r\nSimon's secret, whatever it was. It was necessary to reassure him.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Simon,\" I said, \"I am entirely at a loss to know what you mean.\r\nI went to Madame Vulpes to consult with her on a scientific problem,\r\nto the solution of which I discovered that a diamond of the size I just\r\nmentioned was necessary. You were never alluded to during the evening,\r\nnor, so far as I was concerned, even thought of. What can be the meaning\r\nof this outburst? If you happen to have a set of valuable diamonds in\r\nyour possession, you need fear nothing from me. The diamond which I\r\nrequire you could not possess; or, if you did possess it, you would not\r\nbe living here.\"\r\n\r\nSomething in my tone must have completely reassured him, for his\r\nexpression immediately changed to a sort of constrained merriment,\r\ncombined however, with a certain suspicious attention to my movements.\r\nHe laughed, and said that I must bear with him; that he was at certain\r\nmoments subject to a species of vertigo, which betrayed itself in\r\nincoherent speeches, and that the attacks passed off as rapidly as they\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nHe put his weapon aside while making this explanation, and endeavored,\r\nwith some success, to assume a more cheerful air.\r\n\r\nAll this did not impose on me in the least. I was too much accustomed\r\nto analytical labors to be baffled by so flimsy a veil. I determined to\r\nprobe the mystery to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Simon,\" I said gayly, \"let us forget all this over a bottle of\r\nBurgundy. I have a case of Lausseure's _Clos Vougeot_ downstairs,\r\nfragrant with the odors and ruddy with the sunlight of the Cote d'Or.\r\nLet us have up a couple of bottles. What say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" answered Simon smilingly.\r\n\r\nI produced the wine and we seated ourselves to drink. It was of a famous\r\nvintage, that of 1848, a year when war and wine throve together, and its\r\npure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed vitality to the system.\r\nBy the time we had half finished the second bottle, Simon's head, which\r\nI knew was a weak one, had begun to yield, while I remained calm as\r\never, only that every draught seemed to send a flush of vigor through\r\nmy limbs. Simon's utterance became more and more indistinct. He took to\r\nsinging French _chansons_ of a not very moral tendency. I rose suddenly\r\nfrom the table just at the conclusion of one of those incoherent verses,\r\nand, fixing my eyes on him with a quiet smile, said, \"Simon, I have\r\ndeceived you. I learned your secret this evening. You may as well be\r\nfrank with me. Mrs. Vulpes--or rather, one of her spirits--told me all.\"\r\n\r\nHe started with horror. His intoxication seemed for the moment to fade\r\naway, and he made a movement toward the weapon that he had a short time\r\nbefore laid down, I stopped him with my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Monster!\" he cried passionately, \"I am ruined! What shall I do? You\r\nshall never have it! I swear by my mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want it,\" I said; \"rest secure, but be frank with me. Tell me\r\nall about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe drunkenness began to return. He protested with maudlin earnestness\r\nthat I was entirely mistaken--that I was intoxicated; then asked me to\r\nswear eternal secrecy, and promised to disclose the mystery to me. I\r\npledged myself, of course, to all. With an uneasy look in his eyes, and\r\nhands unsteady with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case from his\r\nbreast and opened it. Heavens! How the mild lamplight was shivered into\r\na thousand prismatic arrows as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond that\r\nglittered in the case! I was no judge of diamonds, but I saw at a glance\r\nthat this was a gem of rare size and purity. I looked at Simon with\r\nwonder and--must I confess it?--with envy. How could he have obtained\r\nthis treasure? In reply to my questions, I could just gather from\r\nhis drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence was\r\naffected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged\r\nin diamond-washing in Brazil; that he had seen one of them secrete a\r\ndiamond, but, instead of informing his employers, had quietly watched\r\nthe negro until he saw him bury his treasure; that he had dug it up and\r\nfled with it, but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to dispose of\r\nit publicly--so valuable a gem being almost certain to attract too\r\nmuch attention to its owner's antecedents--and he had not been able\r\nto discover any of those obscure channels by which such matters are\r\nconveyed away safely. He added that, in accordance with oriental\r\npractice, he had named his diamond with the fanciful title of \"The Eye\r\nof Morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Simon was relating this to me, I regarded the great diamond\r\nattentively. Never had I beheld anything so beautiful. All the glories\r\nof light ever imagined or described seemed to pulsate in its crystalline\r\nchambers. Its weight, as I learned from Simon, was exactly one hundred\r\nand forty carats. Here was an amazing coincidence. The hand of destiny\r\nseemed in it. On the very evening when the spirit of Leeuwenhoek\r\ncommunicates to me the great secret of the microscope, the priceless\r\nmeans which he directs me to employ start up within my easy reach! I\r\ndetermined, with the most perfect deliberation, to possess myself of\r\nSimon's diamond.\r\n\r\nI sat opposite to him while he nodded over his glass, and calmly\r\nrevolved the whole affair. I did not for an instant contemplate so\r\nfoolish an act as a common theft, which would of course be discovered,\r\nor at least necessitate flight and concealment, all of which must\r\ninterfere with my scientific plans. There was but one step to be\r\ntaken--to kill Simon. After all, what was the life of a little peddling\r\nJew in comparison with the interests of science? Human beings are taken\r\nevery day from the condemned prisons to be experimented on by surgeons.\r\nThis man, Simon, was by his own confession a criminal, a robber, and I\r\nbelieved on my soul a murderer. He deserved death quite as much as any\r\nfelon condemned by the laws: why should I not, like government,\r\ncontrive that his punishment should contribute to the progress of human\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nThe means for accomplishing everything I desired lay within my reach.\r\nThere stood upon the mantelpiece a bottle half full of French laudanum.\r\nSimon was so occupied with his diamond, which I had just restored to\r\nhim, that it was an affair of no difficulty to drug his glass. In a\r\nquarter of an hour he was in a profound sleep.\r\n\r\nI now opened his waistcoat, took the diamond from the inner pocket in\r\nwhich he had placed it, and removed him to the bed, on which I laid him\r\nso that his feet hung down over the edge. I had possessed myself of\r\nthe Malay creese, which I held in my right hand, while with the other I\r\ndiscovered as accurately as I could by pulsation the exact locality of\r\nthe heart. It was essential that all the aspects of his death should\r\nlead to the surmise of self-murder. I calculated the exact angle at\r\nwhich it was probable that the weapon, if leveled by Simon's own hand,\r\nwould enter his breast; then with one powerful blow I thrust it up to\r\nthe hilt in the very spot which I desired to penetrate. A convulsive\r\nthrill ran through Simon's limbs. I heard a smothered sound issue from\r\nhis throat, precisely like the bursting of a large air-bubble sent up by\r\na diver when it reaches the surface of the water; he turned half round\r\non his side, and, as if to assist my plans more effectually, his right\r\nhand, moved by some mere spasmodic impulse, clasped the handle of the\r\ncreese, which it remained holding with extraordinary muscular tenacity.\r\nBeyond this there was no apparent struggle. The laudanum, I presume,\r\nparalyzed the usual nervous action. He must have died instantly.\r\n\r\nThere was yet something to be done. To make it certain that all\r\nsuspicion of the act should be diverted from any inhabitant of the house\r\nto Simon himself, it was necessary that the door should be found in the\r\nmorning _locked on the in-side_. How to do this, and afterward escape\r\nmyself? Not by the window; that was a physical impossibility. Besides,\r\nI was determined that the windows _also_ should be found bolted. The\r\nsolution was simple enough. I descended softly to my own room for\r\na peculiar instrument which I had used for holding small slippery\r\nsubstances, such as minute spheres of glass, etc. This instrument was\r\nnothing more than a long, slender hand-vise, with a very powerful grip\r\nand a considerable leverage, which last was accidentally owing to the\r\nshape of the handle. Nothing was simpler than, when the key was in the\r\nlock, to seize the end of its stem in this vise, through the keyhole,\r\nfrom the outside, and so lock the door. Previously, however, to doing\r\nthis, I burned a number of papers on Simon's hearth. Suicides almost\r\nalways burn papers before they destroy themselves. I also emptied some\r\nmore laudanum into Simon's glass--having first removed from it all\r\ntraces of wine--cleaned the other wine-glass, and brought the bottles\r\naway with me. If traces of two persons drinking had been found in the\r\nroom, the question naturally would have arisen, Who was the second?\r\nBesides, the wine-bottles might have been identified as belonging to me.\r\nThe laudanum I poured out to account for its presence in his stomach, in\r\ncase of a _post-mortem_ examination. The theory naturally would be that\r\nhe first intended to poison himself, but, after swallowing a little of\r\nthe drug, was either disgusted with its taste, or changed his mind from\r\nother motives, and chose the dagger. These arrangements made, I walked\r\nout, leaving the gas burning, locked the door with my vise, and went to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nSimon's death was not discovered until nearly three in the afternoon.\r\nThe servant, astonished at seeing the gas burning--the light streaming\r\non the dark landing from under the door--peeped through the keyhole and\r\nsaw Simon on the bed.\r\n\r\nShe gave the alarm. The door was burst open, and the neighborhood was in\r\na fever of excitement.\r\n\r\nEvery one in the house was arrested, myself included. There was an\r\ninquest; but no clew to his death beyond that of suicide could be\r\nobtained. Curiously enough, he had made several speeches to his friends\r\nthe preceding week that seemed to point to self-destruction. One\r\ngentleman swore that Simon had said in his presence that \"he was tired\r\nof life.\" His landlord affirmed that Simon, when paying him his last\r\nmonth's rent, remarked that \"he should not pay him rent much longer.\"\r\nAll the other evidence corresponded--the door locked inside, the\r\nposition of the corpse, the burned papers. As I anticipated, no one\r\nknew of the possession of the diamond by Simon, so that no motive was\r\nsuggested for his murder. The jury, after a prolonged examination,\r\nbrought in the usual verdict, and the neighborhood once more settled\r\ndown to its accustomed quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe three months succeeding Simon's catastrophe I devoted night and day\r\nto my diamond lens. I had constructed a vast galvanic battery, composed\r\nof nearly two thousand pairs of plates: a higher power I dared not use,\r\nlest the diamond should be calcined. By means of this enormous engine\r\nI was enabled to send a powerful current of electricity continually\r\nthrough my great diamond, which it seemed to me gained in lustre every\r\nday. At the expiration of a month I commenced the grinding and polishing\r\nof the lens, a work of intense toil and exquisite delicacy. The great\r\ndensity of the stone, and the care required to be taken with the\r\ncurvatures of the surfaces of the lens, rendered the labor the severest\r\nand most harassing that I had yet undergone.\r\n\r\nAt last the eventful moment came; the lens was completed. I stood\r\ntrembling on the threshold of new worlds. I had the realization of\r\nAlexander's famous wish before me. The lens lay on the table, ready to\r\nbe placed upon its platform. My hand fairly shook as I enveloped a drop\r\nof water with a thin coating of oil of turpentine, preparatory to\r\nits examination, a process necessary in order to prevent the rapid\r\nevaporation of the water. I now placed the drop on a thin slip of glass\r\nunder the lens, and throwing upon it, by the combined aid of a prism and\r\na mirror, a powerful stream of light, I approached my eye to the minute\r\nhole drilled through the axis of the lens. For an instant I saw nothing\r\nsave what seemed to be an illuminated chaos, a vast, luminous abyss. A\r\npure white light, cloudless and serene, and seemingly limitless as space\r\nitself, was my first impression. Gently, and with the greatest care, I\r\ndepressed the lens a few hairbreadths. The wondrous illumination\r\nstill continued, but as the lens approached the object a scene of\r\nindescribable beauty was unfolded to my view.\r\n\r\nI seemed to gaze upon a vast space, the limits of which extended far\r\nbeyond my vision. An atmosphere of magical luminousness permeated the\r\nentire field of view. I was amazed to see no trace of animalculous\r\nlife. Not a living thing, apparently, inhabited that dazzling expanse.\r\nI comprehended instantly that, by the wondrous power of my lens, I had\r\npenetrated beyond the grosser particles of aqueous matter, beyond the\r\nrealms of infusoria and protozoa, down to the original gaseous globule,\r\ninto whose luminous interior I was gazing as into an almost boundless\r\ndome filled with a supernatural radiance.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, no brilliant void into which I looked. On every side I\r\nbeheld beautiful inorganic forms, of unknown texture, and colored with\r\nthe most enchanting hues. These forms presented the appearance of what\r\nmight be called, for want of a more specific definition, foliated clouds\r\nof the highest rarity--that is, they undulated and broke into vegetable\r\nformations, and were tinged with splendors compared with which the\r\ngilding of our autumn woodlands is as dross compared with gold. Far away\r\ninto the illimitable distance stretched long avenues of these gaseous\r\nforests, dimly transparent, and painted with prismatic hues of\r\nunimaginable brilliancy. The pendent branches waved along the fluid\r\nglades until every vista seemed to break through half-lucent ranks of\r\nmany-colored drooping silken pennons. What seemed to be either fruits or\r\nflowers, pied with a thousand hues, lustrous and ever-varying, bubbled\r\nfrom the crowns of this fairy foliage. No hills, no lakes, no rivers,\r\nno forms animate or inanimate, were to be seen, save those vast auroral\r\ncopses that floated serenely in the luminous stillness, with leaves and\r\nfruits and flowers gleaming with unknown fires, unrealizable by mere\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nHow strange, I thought, that this sphere should be thus condemned to\r\nsolitude! I had hoped, at least, to discover some new form of animal\r\nlife, perhaps of a lower class than any with which we are at present\r\nacquainted, but still some living organism. I found my newly discovered\r\nworld, if I may so speak, a beautiful chromatic desert.\r\n\r\nWhile I was speculating on the singular arrangements of the internal\r\neconomy of Nature, with which she so frequently splinters into atoms our\r\nmost compact theories, I thought I beheld a form moving slowly through\r\nthe glades of one of the prismatic forests. I looked more attentively,\r\nand found that I was not mistaken. Words can not depict the anxiety with\r\nwhich I awaited the nearer approach of this mysterious object. Was it\r\nmerely some inanimate substance, held in suspense in the attenuated\r\natmosphere of the globule, or was it an animal endowed with vitality\r\nand motion? It approached, flitting behind the gauzy, colored veils of\r\ncloud-foliage, for seconds dimly revealed, then vanishing. At last the\r\nviolet pennons that trailed nearest to me vibrated; they were gently\r\npushed aside, and the form floated out into the broad light.\r\n\r\nIt was a female human shape. When I say human, I mean it possessed the\r\noutlines of humanity; but there the analogy ends. Its adorable beauty\r\nlifted it illimitable heights beyond the loveliest daughter of Adam.\r\n\r\nI can not, I dare not, attempt to inventory the charms of this divine\r\nrevelation of perfect beauty. Those eyes of mystic violet, dewy and\r\nserene, evade my words. Her long, lustrous hair following her glorious\r\nhead in a golden wake, like the track sown in heaven by a falling star,\r\nseems to quench my most burning phrases with its splendors. If all the\r\nbees of Hybla nestled upon my lips, they would still sing but hoarsely\r\nthe wondrous harmonies of outline that inclosed her form.\r\n\r\nShe swept out from between the rainbow-curtains of the cloud-trees into\r\nthe broad sea of light that lay beyond. Her motions were those of some\r\ngraceful naiad, cleaving, by a mere effort of her will, the clear,\r\nunruffled waters that fill the chambers of the sea. She floated forth\r\nwith the serene grace of a frail bubble ascending through the still\r\natmosphere of a June day. The perfect roundness of her limbs formed\r\nsuave and enchanting curves. It was like listening to the most spiritual\r\nsymphony of Beethoven the divine, to watch the harmonious flow of lines.\r\nThis, indeed was a pleasure cheaply purchased at any price. What cared\r\nI if I had waded to the portal of this wonder through another's blood.\r\nI would have given my own to enjoy one such moment of intoxication and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nBreathless with gazing on this lovely wonder, and forgetful for an\r\ninstant of everything save her presence, I withdrew my eye from the\r\nmicroscope eagerly. Alas! as my gaze fell on the thin slide that lay\r\nbeneath my instrument, the bright light from mirror and from prism\r\nsparkled on a colorless drop of water! There, in that tiny bead of dew,\r\nthis beautiful being was forever imprisoned. The planet Neptune was not\r\nmore distant from me than she. I hastened once more to apply my eye to\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\nAnimula (let me now call her by that dear name which I subsequently\r\nbestowed on her) had changed her position. She had again approached the\r\nwondrous forest, and was gazing earnestly upward. Presently one of the\r\ntrees--as I must call them--unfolded a long ciliary process, with which\r\nit seized one of the gleaming fruits that glittered on its summit, and,\r\nsweeping slowly down, held it within reach of Animula. The sylph took\r\nit in her delicate hand and began to eat. My attention was so entirely\r\nabsorbed by her that I could not apply myself to the task of determining\r\nwhether this singular plant was or was not instinct with volition.\r\n\r\nI watched her, as she made her repast, with the most profound attention.\r\nThe suppleness of her motions sent a thrill of delight through my frame;\r\nmy heart beat madly as she turned her beautiful eyes in the direction of\r\nthe spot in which I stood. What would I not have given to have had the\r\npower to precipitate myself into that luminous ocean and float with her\r\nthrough those grooves of purple and gold! While I was thus breathlessly\r\nfollowing her every movement, she suddenly started, seemed to listen\r\nfor a moment, and then cleaving the brilliant ether in which she was\r\nfloating, like a flash of light, pierced through the opaline forest and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nInstantly a series of the most singular sensations attacked me. It\r\nseemed as if I had suddenly gone blind. The luminous sphere was still\r\nbefore me, but my daylight had vanished. What caused this sudden\r\ndisappearance? Had she a lover or a husband? Yes, that was the solution!\r\nSome signal from a happy fellow-being had vibrated through the avenues\r\nof the forest, and she had obeyed the summons.\r\n\r\nThe agony of my sensations, as I arrived at this conclusion, startled\r\nme. I tried to reject the conviction that my reason forced upon me. I\r\nbattled against the fatal conclusion--but in vain. It was so. I had no\r\nescape from it. I loved an animalcule.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, thanks to the marvelous power of my microscope, she\r\nappeared of human proportions. Instead of presenting the revolting\r\naspect of the coarser creatures, that live and struggle and die, in\r\nthe more easily resolvable portions of the water-drop, she was fair and\r\ndelicate and of surpassing beauty. But of what account was all that?\r\nEvery time that my eye was withdrawn from the instrument it fell on a\r\nmiserable drop of water, within which, I must be content to know, dwelt\r\nall that could make my life lovely.\r\n\r\nCould she but see me once! Could I for one moment pierce the mystical\r\nwalls that so inexorably rose to separate us, and whisper all that\r\nfilled my soul, I might consent to be satisfied for the rest of my life\r\nwith the knowledge of her remote sympathy.\r\n\r\nIt would be something to have established even the faintest personal\r\nlink to bind us together--to know that at times, when roaming through\r\nthese enchanted glades, she might think of the wonderful stranger who\r\nhad broken the monotony of her life with his presence and left a gentle\r\nmemory in her heart!\r\n\r\nBut it could not be. No invention of which human intellect was capable\r\ncould break down the barriers that nature had erected. I might feast my\r\nsoul upon her wondrous beauty, yet she must always remain ignorant\r\nof the adoring eyes that day and night gazed upon her, and, even when\r\nclosed, beheld her in dreams. With a bitter cry of anguish I fled from\r\nthe room, and flinging myself on my bed, sobbed myself to sleep like a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nI arose the next morning almost at daybreak, and rushed to my\r\nmicroscope, I trembled as I sought the luminous world in miniature that\r\ncontained my all. Animula was there. I had left the gas-lamp, surrounded\r\nby its moderators, burning when I went to bed the night before. I found\r\nthe sylph bathing, as it were, with an expression of pleasure animating\r\nher features, in the brilliant light which surrounded her. She tossed\r\nher lustrous golden hair over her shoulders with innocent coquetry. She\r\nlay at full length in the transparent medium, in which she supported\r\nherself with ease, and gamboled with the enchanting grace that the nymph\r\nSalmacis might have exhibited when she sought to conquer the modest\r\nHermaphroditus. I tried an experiment to satisfy myself if her powers of\r\nreflection were developed. I lessened the lamplight considerably. By the\r\ndim light that remained, I could see an expression of pain flit across\r\nher face. She looked upward suddenly, and her brows contracted. I\r\nflooded the stage of the microscope again with a full stream of light,\r\nand her whole expression changed. She sprang forward like some some\r\nsubstance deprived of all weight. Her eyes sparkled and her lips moved.\r\nAh! if science had only the means of conducting and reduplicating\r\nsounds, as it does rays of light, what carols of happiness would then\r\nhave entranced my ears! what jubilant hymns to Adonais would have\r\nthrilled the illumined air!\r\n\r\nI now comprehended how it was that the Count de Cabalis peopled his\r\nmystic world with sylphs-beautiful beings whose breath of life was\r\nlambent fire, and who sported forever in regions of purest ether and\r\npurest light. The Rosicrucian had anticipated the wonder that I had\r\npractically realized.\r\n\r\nHow long this worship of my strange divinity went on thus I scarcely\r\nknow. I lost all note of time. All day from early dawn, and far into the\r\nnight, I was to be found peering through that wonderful lens. I saw\r\nno one, went nowhere, and scarce allowed myself sufficient time for my\r\nmeals. My whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as that of\r\nany of the Romish saints. Every hour that I gazed upon the divine form\r\nstrengthened my passion--a passion that was always overshadowed by the\r\nmaddening conviction that, although I could gaze on her at will, she\r\nnever, never could behold me!\r\n\r\nAt length I grew so pale and emaciated, from want of rest and continual\r\nbrooding over my insane love and its cruel conditions, that I determined\r\nto make some effort to wean myself from it. \"Come,\" I said, \"this is\r\nat best but a fantasy. Your imagination has bestowed on Animula charms\r\nwhich in reality she does not possess. Seclusion from female society has\r\nproduced this morbid condition of mind. Compare her with the beautiful\r\nwomen of your own world, and this false enchantment will vanish.\"\r\n\r\nI looked over the newspapers by chance. There I beheld the advertisement\r\nof a celebrated _danseuse_ who appeared nightly at Niblo's. The\r\nSignorina Caradolce had the reputation of being the most beautiful as\r\nwell as the most graceful woman in the world. I instantly dressed and\r\nwent to the theatre.\r\n\r\nThe curtain drew up. The usual semicircle of fairies in white muslin\r\nwere standing on the right toe around the enameled flower-bank of green\r\ncanvas, on which the belated prince was sleeping. Suddenly a flute is\r\nheard. The fairies start. The trees open, the fairies all stand on\r\nthe left toe, and the queen enters. It was the Signorina. She bounded\r\nforward amid thunders of applause, and, lighting on one foot, remained\r\npoised in the air. Heavens! was this the great enchantress that had\r\ndrawn monarchs at her chariot-wheels? Those heavy, muscular limbs,\r\nthose thick ankles, those cavernous eyes, that stereotyped smile, those\r\ncrudely painted cheeks! Where were the vermeil blooms, the liquid,\r\nexpressive eyes, the harmonious limbs of Animula?\r\n\r\nThe Signorina danced. What gross, discordant movements! The play of\r\nher limbs was all false and artificial. Her bounds were painful athletic\r\nefforts; her poses were angular and distressed the eye. I could bear it\r\nno longer; with an exclamation of disgust that drew every eye upon me,\r\nI rose from my seat in the very middle of the Signorina's\r\n_pas-de-fascination_ and abruptly quitted the house.\r\n\r\nI hastened home to feast my eyes once more on the lovely form of\r\nmy sylph. I felt that henceforth to combat this passion would be\r\nimpossible. I applied my eyes to the lens. Animula was there--but what\r\ncould have happened? Some terrible change seemed to have taken place\r\nduring my absence. Some secret grief seemed to cloud the lovely features\r\nof her I gazed upon. Her face had grown thin and haggard; her limbs\r\ntrailed heavily; the wondrous lustre of her golden hair had faded. She\r\nwas ill--ill, and I could not assist her! I believe at that moment I\r\nwould have forfeited all claims to my human birthright if I could only\r\nhave been dwarfed to the size of an animalcule, and permitted to console\r\nher from whom fate had forever divided me.\r\n\r\nI racked my brain for the solution of this mystery. What was it that\r\nafflicted the sylph? She seemed to suffer intense pain. Her features\r\ncontracted, and she even writhed, as if with some internal agony. The\r\nwondrous forests appeared also to have lost half their beauty. Their\r\nhues were dim and in some places faded away altogether. I watched\r\nAnimula for hours with a breaking heart, and she seemed absolutely to\r\nwither away under my very eye. Suddenly I remembered that I had not\r\nlooked at the water-drop for several days. In fact, I hated to see it;\r\nfor it reminded me of the natural barrier between Animula and myself.\r\nI hurriedly looked down on the stage of the microscope. The slide was\r\nstill there--but, great heavens, the water drop had vanished! The awful\r\ntruth burst upon me; it had evaporated, until it had become so minute\r\nas to be invisible to the naked eye; I had been gazing on its last atom,\r\nthe one that contained Animula--and she was dying!\r\n\r\nI rushed again to the front of the lens and looked through. Alas! the\r\nlast agony had seized her. The rainbow-hued forests had all melted away,\r\nand Animula lay struggling feebly in what seemed to be a spot of dim\r\nlight. Ah! the sight was horrible: the limbs once so round and lovely\r\nshriveling up into nothings; the eyes--those eyes that shone like\r\nheaven--being quenched into black dust; the lustrous golden hair now\r\nlank and discolored. The last throe came. I beheld that final struggle\r\nof the blackening form--and I fainted.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke out of a trance of many hours, I found myself lying amid\r\nthe wreck of my instrument, myself as shattered in mind and body as it.\r\nI crawled feebly to my bed, from which I did not rise for many months.\r\n\r\nThey say now that I am mad; but they are mistaken. I am poor, for I have\r\nneither the heart nor the will to work; all my money is spent, and I\r\nlive on charity. Young men's associations that love a joke invite me to\r\nlecture on optics before them, for which they pay me, and laugh at me\r\nwhile I lecture. \"Linley, the mad microscopist,\" is the name I go by. I\r\nsuppose that I talk incoherently while I lecture. Who could talk sense\r\nwhen his brain is haunted by such ghastly memories, while ever and anon\r\namong the shapes of death I behold the radiant form of my lost Animula!",
