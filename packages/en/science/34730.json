I have attempted to show him both as receiving the\r\ntorch from Lamarck and Malthus, and as passing it on with renewed\r\nbrilliancy to the wide school of evolutionary thinkers whom his work was\r\ninstrumental in arousing to fresh and vigorous activity along a thousand\r\nseparate and varied lines of thought and action.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Francis Darwin was already engaged upon a life of his father, I\r\nshould have shrunk from putting forth my own little book if I had not\r\nsucceeded in securing beforehand his kind sanction. That sanction,\r\nhowever, was at once so frankly and cordially given, that all my\r\nhesitation upon such a score was immediately laid aside; and as I have\r\nnecessarily had to deal rather with Darwin's position as a thinker and\r\nworker than with the biographical details of his private life, I trust\r\nthe lesser book may not clash with the greater, but to some extent may\r\nsupplement and even illustrate it.\r\n\r\nTreating my subject mainly as a study in the interaction of organism and\r\nenvironment, it has been necessary for me frequently to introduce the\r\nnames of living men of science side by side with some of those who have\r\nmore or less recently passed away from among us. For uniformity's sake,\r\nas well as for brevity's, I have been compelled, in every instance\r\nalike, to omit the customary conventional handles. I trust those who\r\nthus find themselves docked of their usual titles of respect will kindly\r\nremember that the practice is in fact adopted _honoris causâ_; they are\r\npaying prematurely the usual penalty of intellectual greatness.\r\n\r\nMy obligations to Professor Huxley, to Professor Fiske, to Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer, to Professor Sachs, to Hermann Müller, to Dr. Krause, to\r\nCharles Darwin himself, and to many other historians and critics of\r\nevolutionism, will be sufficiently obvious to all instructed readers,\r\nand are for the most part fully acknowledged already in the text. It\r\nwould be absurd to overload so small and popularly written a book with\r\nreferences and authorities. I hope, therefore, that any other writers to\r\nwhom I may inadvertently have neglected to confess my debts will kindly\r\nrest satisfied with this general acknowledgment. There are, however,\r\nthree persons in particular from whom I have so largely borrowed facts\r\nor ideas that I owe them more special and definite thanks. From Mr.\r\nWoodall's admirable paper on Charles Darwin, contributed to the\r\n'Transactions of the Shropshire Archaeological Society,' I have taken\r\nmuch interesting information about my hero's immediate ancestry and\r\nearly days. From Mr. Samuel Butler, the author of 'Evolution Old and\r\nNew,' I have derived many pregnant suggestions with regard to the true\r\nposition and meaning of Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and the early\r\nessentially teleological evolutionists--suggestions which I am all the\r\nmore anxious to acknowledge since I differ fundamentally from Mr. Butler\r\nin his estimate of the worth of Charles Darwin's distinctive discovery\r\nof natural selection. Finally, to Mr. Bates, the 'Naturalist on the\r\nAmazons,' I am indebted for several valuable items of information as to\r\nthe general workings of the pre-Darwinian evolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\nIn a book dealing so largely with a contemporary movement, the history\r\nof which has never yet been consecutively written down in full, or\r\nsubjected as a whole to searching criticism, there must probably be many\r\nerrors of detail, which can hardly be avoided under such circumstances.\r\nI have endeavoured to minimise them as far as possible. For those which\r\nmay have escaped my own scrutiny I must trust both for correction and\r\nfor indulgence to the kindness of my readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

The\r\nNewton of biology, he found the science of life a chaotic maze; he left\r\nit an orderly system, with a definite plan and a recognisable meaning.\r\nGreat men are not accidents; great works are not accomplished in a\r\nsingle day. Both are the product of adequate causes. The great man\r\nsprings from an ancestry competent to produce him; he is the final\r\nflower and ultimate outcome of converging hereditary forces, that\r\nculminate at last in the full production of his splendid and exceptional\r\npersonality. The great work which it is his mission to perform in the\r\nworld is never wholly of his own inception. It also is the last effect\r\nof antecedent conditions, the slow result of tendencies and ideas long\r\nworking unseen or but little noticed beneath the surface of opinion, yet\r\nall gradually conspiring together towards the definitive revolution at\r\nwhose head, in the fulness of time, the as yet unborn genius is destined\r\nto place himself. This is especially the case with those extraordinary\r\nwaves of mental upheaval, one of which gave us the Italian renaissance,\r\nand another of which is actually in progress around us at the present\r\nday. They have their sources deep down in the past of human thought and\r\nhuman feeling, and they are themselves but the final manifestation of\r\ninnumerable energies which have long been silently agitating the souls\r\nof nations in their profoundest depths.\r\n\r\nThus, every great man may be regarded as possessing two distinct lines\r\nof ancestry, physical and spiritual, each of which separately demands\r\nelucidation. He owes much in one way to his father and his mother, his\r\ngrandfathers and his grandmothers, and his remoter progenitors, from\r\nsome or all of whom he derives, in varying degrees and combinations, the\r\npersonal qualities whose special interaction constitutes his greatness\r\nand his idiosyncrasy; he owes much in another way to his intellectual\r\nand moral ancestors, the thinkers and workers who have preceded him in\r\nhis own department of thought or action, and have made possible in the\r\ncourse of ages the final development of his special revolution or his\r\nparticular system. Viewed as an individual, he is what he is, with all\r\nhis powers and faculties and potentialities, in virtue of the brain, the\r\nframe, the temperament, the energy he inherits directly from his actual\r\nancestors, paternal and maternal; viewed as a factor or element in a\r\ngreat movement, he is what he is because the movement had succeeded in\r\nreaching such and such a point in its progress already without him, and\r\nwaited only for such and such a grand and commanding personality in\r\norder to carry it yet a step further on its course of development.\r\n\r\nNo man who ever lived would more cordially have recognised these two\r\nalternative aspects of the great worker's predetermining causes than\r\nCharles Darwin. He knew well that the individual is the direct\r\ncumulative product of his physical predecessors, and that he works and\r\nis worked upon in innumerable ways by the particular environment into\r\nwhose midst he is born. Let us see, then, in his own case what were\r\nthese two main sets of conditioning circumstances which finally led up\r\nto the joint production of Charles Darwin, the man and the philosopher,\r\nthe thinking brain and the moving energy. In other words, what was the\r\nstate of the science of life at the time when he first began to observe\r\nand to speculate; and what was the ancestry which made him be born a\r\nperson capable of helping it forward at a single bound over its great\r\nrestricting dogmatic barrier of the fixity of species?\r\n\r\nLet us begin, in the first place, by clearing the path beforehand of a\r\npopular misconception, so extremely general and almost universal that,\r\nunless it be got rid of at the very outset of our sketch, much of the\r\nreal scope and purport of Darwin's life and work must, of necessity,\r\nremain entirely misunderstood by the vast mass of English readers. In\r\nthe public mind Darwin is, perhaps, most commonly regarded as the\r\ndiscoverer and founder of the evolution hypothesis. Two ideas are\r\nusually associated with his name and memory. It is believed that he was\r\nthe first propounder of the theory which supposes all plant and animal\r\nforms to be the result, not of special creation, but of slow\r\nmodification in pre-existent organisms. It is further and more\r\nparticularly believed that he was the first propounder of the theory\r\nwhich supposes the descent of man to be traceable from a remote and more\r\nor less monkey-like ancestor. Now, as a matter of fact, Darwin was not\r\nthe prime originator of either of these two great cardinal ideas. Though\r\nhe held both as part of his organised theory of things, he was not by\r\nany means the first or the earliest thinker to hold them or to propound\r\nthem publicly. Though he gained for them both a far wider and more\r\ngeneral acceptance than they had ever before popularly received, he laid\r\nno sort of claim himself to originality or proprietorship in either\r\ntheory. The grand idea which he did really originate was not the idea of\r\n'descent with modification,' but the idea of 'natural selection,' by\r\nwhich agency, as he was the first to prove, definite kinds of plants and\r\nanimals have been slowly evolved from simpler forms, with definite\r\nadaptations to the special circumstances by which they are surrounded.\r\nIn a word, it was the peculiar glory of Charles Darwin, not to have\r\nsuggested that all the variety of animal and vegetable life might have\r\nbeen produced by slow modifications in one or more original types, but\r\nto have shown the nature of the machinery by which such a result could\r\nbe actually attained in the practical working out of natural causes. He\r\ndid not invent the development theory, but he made it believable and\r\ncomprehensible. He was not, as most people falsely imagine, the Moses of\r\nevolutionism, the prime mover in the biological revolution; he was the\r\nJoshua who led the world of thinkers and workers into full fruition of\r\nthat promised land which earlier investigators had but dimly descried\r\nfrom the Pisgah-top of conjectural speculation.\r\n\r\nHow far Darwin's special idea of natural selection supplemented and\r\nrendered credible the earlier idea of descent with modification we shall\r\nsee more fully when we come to treat of the inception and growth of his\r\ngreat epoch-making work, 'The Origin of Species;' for the present, it\r\nmust suffice to point out that in the world into which he was born, the\r\ntheory of evolution already existed in a more or less shadowy and\r\nundeveloped shape. And since it was his task in life to raise this\r\ntheory from the rank of a mere plausible and happy guess to the rank of\r\na highly elaborate and almost universally accepted biological system, we\r\nmay pause awhile to consider on the threshold what was the actual state\r\nof natural science at the moment when the great directing and organising\r\nintelligence of Charles Darwin first appeared.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial, in modern Christendom at least, it had been the\r\ngeneral opinion of learned and simple alike that every species of plant\r\nor animal owed its present form and its original existence to a distinct\r\nact of special creation. This _naïf_ belief, unsupported as it was by\r\nany sort of internal evidence, was supposed to rest directly upon the\r\nexpress authority of a few obscure statements in the Book of Genesis.\r\nThe Creator, it was held, had in the beginning formed each kind after a\r\nparticular pattern, had endowed it with special organs devised with\r\nsupreme wisdom for subserving special functions, and had bestowed upon\r\nit the mystical power of reproducing its like in its own image to all\r\ngenerations. No variation of importance ever occurred within the types\r\nthus constituted; all plants and animals always retained their special\r\nforms unaltered in any way from era to era. This is the doctrine of the\r\nfixity and immutability of species, almost universal in the civilised\r\nworld up to the end of the last century.\r\n\r\nImprobable as such a crude idea now seems to any person even moderately\r\nacquainted with the extraordinary variety and variability of living\r\nforms, it nevertheless contained nothing at all likely to contradict the\r\nordinary experience of the everyday observer in the last century. The\r\nhandful of plants and animals with which he was personally acquainted\r\nconsisted for the most part of a few large, highly advanced, and\r\nwell-marked forms, not in the least liable to be mistaken for one\r\nanother even by the most hasty and casual spectator. A horse can\r\nimmediately be discriminated by the naked eye from a donkey, and a cow\r\nfrom a sheep, without risk of error; nobody is likely to confuse wheat\r\nwith barley, or to hesitate between classing any given fruit that is\r\nlaid before him as a pear or an apple, a plum or a nectarine.\r\nVariability seldom comes under the notice of the ordinary passing\r\nspectator as it does under that of the prying and curious scientific\r\nobserver; and when it comes at all, as in the case of dogs and pigeons,\r\nroses and hyacinths, it is no doubt set down carelessly on a superficial\r\nview as a mere result of human selection or of deliberate mongrel\r\ninterbreeding. To the eye of the average man, all the living objects\r\nordinarily perceived in external nature fall at once under certain fixed\r\nand recognisable kinds, as dogs and horses, elms and ashes, whose limits\r\nhe is never at all inclined to confound in any way one with the other.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, the great father of modern scientific biology, had frankly and\r\nperhaps unthinkingly accepted this current and almost universal dogma of\r\nthe fixity and immutability of species. Indeed, by defining a kind as a\r\ngroup of plants or animals so closely resembling one another as to give\r\nrise to the belief that they might all be descended from a single\r\nancestor or pair of ancestors, he implicitly gave the new sanction of\r\nhis weighty authority to the creation hypothesis, and to the prevalent\r\ndoctrine of the unchangeability of organic forms. To Linnæus, the\r\nspecies into which he mapped out all the plants and animals then known,\r\nappeared as the descendants each of a solitary progenitor or of a\r\nprimitive couple, called into existence at the beginning of all things\r\nby the direct fiat of a designing Creator. He saw the world of organic\r\nlife as composed of so many well-demarcated types, each separate,\r\ndistinct, and immutable, each capable of producing its like _ad\r\ninfinitum_, and each unable to vary from its central standard in any of\r\nits individuals, except perhaps within very narrow and unimportant\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nBut towards the close of the eighteenth century, side by side with the\r\ngeneral awakening of the human intellect and the arrival of a new era of\r\nfree social investigation, which culminated in a fresh order of things,\r\nthere was developed a more critical and sceptical attitude in the world\r\nof science, which soon produced a notable change of front among thinking\r\nnaturalists as to the origin and meaning of specific distinctions.\r\n\r\nBuffon was the first great biological innovator who ventured, in very\r\ndoubtful and tentative language, to suggest the possibility of the rise\r\nof species from one another by slow modification of ancestral forms.\r\nEssentially a popular essayist, writing in the volcanic\r\npriest-suppressed France of the _ancien régime_, during the inconsistent\r\ndays of Louis XV. and Louis XVI., when it was uncertain whether novel\r\nand heterodox opinions would bring down upon their author fame and\r\nreputation or the Sorbonne and the Bastille, Buffon was careful to put\r\nhis conjectural conclusions in a studiously guarded and often even\r\nironical form. But time after time, in his great discursive work, the\r\n'Histoire Naturelle' (published in successive volumes between 1749 and\r\n1788), he recurs anew to the pregnant suggestion that plants and animals\r\nmay not be bound by fixed and immovable limits of species, but may\r\nfreely vary in every direction from a common centre, so that one kind\r\nmay gradually and slowly be evolved by natural causes from the type of\r\nanother. He points out that, underlying all external diversities of\r\ncharacter and shape, fundamental likenesses of type occur in many\r\nanimals, which irresistibly suggest the novel notion of common descent\r\nfrom a single ancestor. Thus regarded, he says, not only the ass and the\r\nhorse (to take a particular passage) but even man himself, the monkeys,\r\nthe quadrupeds, and all vertebrate animals, might be viewed as merely\r\nforming divergent branches of one and the same great family tree. Every\r\nsuch family, he believed, whether animal or vegetable, might have sprung\r\noriginally from a single stock, which after many generations had here\r\ndeveloped into a higher form, and there degenerated into a lower and\r\nless perfect type of organisation. Granting this--granting that nature\r\ncould by slow variation produce one species in the course of direct\r\ndescent from another unlike it (for example, the ass from the horse),\r\nthen, Buffon observed, there was no further limit to be set to her\r\npowers in this respect, and we might reasonably conclude that from a\r\nsingle primordial being she has gradually been able in the course of\r\ntime to develop the whole continuous gamut of existing animal and\r\nvegetable life. To be sure, Buffon always saves himself from censure by\r\nan obvious afterthought--'But no; it is certain from revelation that\r\nevery species was directly created by a separate fiat.' This\r\nhalf-hearted and somewhat subrisive denial, however, must be taken\r\nmerely as a concession to the Sorbonne and to the fashionable exegesis\r\nof his own day; and, even so, the Sorbonne was too much in the end for\r\nthe philosophic thinker. He had once in his life at least to make his\r\nsubmission and demand pardon from the offended orthodoxy of the Paris\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\nThe wave of thought and feeling, thus apologetically and tentatively\r\nstirred on the unruffled pond of eighteenth century opinion by the\r\nstartling plop of Buffon's little smooth-cut pebble, soon widened out on\r\nevery side in concentric circles, and affected with its wash the entire\r\nworld of biological science in every country. Before the close of the\r\neighteenth century speculation as to the origin of species was rife in\r\nall quarters of Europe. In France itself, Geoffroy St. Hilaire,\r\nconstitutionally cautious and undecided, but wide of view and free from\r\nprejudice, came slowly to the conclusion, in 1795, that all species are\r\nreally derived by modification from one or more primitive types. In\r\nGermany, in the very same year, Goethe, with the keen vision of the\r\npoet and the calm eye of the philosopher uniquely combined, discerned\r\nindependently as by a lightning flash the identical idea of the origin\r\nof kinds by modification of pre-existent organisms. 'We may assert\r\nwithout hesitation,' says that great nebulous thinker and observer,\r\n'that all the more perfect organic natures, such as fishes, amphibians,\r\nbirds and mammals, with man at their head, were formed at first on one\r\noriginal type, which still daily changes and modifies its form by\r\npropagation.' In England, twelve months earlier, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\r\nCharles Darwin's grandfather (of whom more anon), published his\r\n'Zoonomia,' a treatise on the laws of animal life, in which he not only\r\nadopted Buffon's theory of the origin of species by evolution, but also\r\nlaid down as the chief cause of such development the actions and needs\r\nof the animals themselves. According to Dr. Erasmus Darwin, animals came\r\nto vary from one another chiefly because they were always altering their\r\nhabits and voluntarily accommodating themselves to new actions and\r\npositions in life. His work produced comparatively little effect upon\r\nthe world at large in his own time, but it had immense influence upon\r\nthe next great prophet of evolution, Lamarck, and through Lamarck on\r\nLyell, Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and the modern school of\r\nevolutionists generally. We shall consider his views in greater detail\r\nwhen we pass from the spiritual to the physical antecedents of Charles\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1801 that Lamarck first gave to the world his epoch-making\r\nspeculations and suggestions on the origin of species; and from that\r\ndate to the day of his death, in 1831, the unwearied old philosopher\r\ncontinued to devote his whole time and energy, in blindness and poverty,\r\nto the elucidation of this interesting and important subject. A bold,\r\nacute, and vigorous thinker, trained in the great school of Diderot and\r\nD'Alembert, with something of the vivid Celtic poetic imagination, and a\r\nfearless habit of forming his own conclusions irrespective of common or\r\npreconceived ideas, Lamarck went to the very root of the matter in the\r\nmost determined fashion, and openly proclaimed in the face of frowning\r\nofficialism under the Napoleonic reaction his profound conviction that\r\nall species, including man, were descended by modification from one or\r\nmore primordial forms. In Charles Darwin's own words, 'He first did the\r\neminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all change,\r\nin the organic as well as in the inorganic world, being the result of\r\nlaw and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to have been\r\nchiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of species by the\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by the almost\r\nperfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the analogy of\r\ndomestic productions. With respect to the means of modification, he\r\nattributed something to the direct action of the physical conditions of\r\nlife, something to the crossing of already existing forms, and much to\r\nuse and disuse, that is, to the effects of habit. To this latter agency\r\nhe seems to attribute all the beautiful adaptations in nature--such as\r\nthe long neck of the giraffe for browsing on the branches of trees,' He\r\nbelieved, in short, that animals had largely developed themselves, by\r\nfunctional effort followed by increased powers and abilities.\r\n\r\nLamarck's great work, the 'Philosophie Zoologique,' though opposed by\r\nthe austere and formal genius of the immortal Cuvier--a reactionary\r\nbiological conservative and obscurantist, equal to the enormous task of\r\nmapping out piecemeal with infinite skill and power the separate\r\nprovinces of his chosen science, but incapable of taking in all the\r\nbearings of the whole field at a single vivid and comprehensive\r\nsweep--Lamarck's great work produced a deep and lasting impression upon\r\nthe entire subsequent course of evolutionary thought in scientific\r\nEurope. True, owing to the retrograde tendencies of the First Empire, it\r\ncaused but little immediate stir at the precise moment of its first\r\npublication; but the seed it sowed sank deep, and, lying fallow long in\r\nmen's minds, bore fruit at last in the next generation with the\r\nmarvellous fecundity of the germs of genius. Indeed, from the very\r\nbeginning of the present century, a ferment of inquiry on the subject of\r\ncreation and evolution was everywhere obvious among speculative\r\nthinkers. The profound interest which Goethe took in the dispute on this\r\nvery subject in the French Académie des Sciences between Cuvier and\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire, amid the thundering guns of a threatened European\r\nconvulsion, was but a solitary symptom of the general stir which\r\npreceded the gestation and birth of the Darwinian hypothesis. It is\r\nimpossible to take up any scientific memoirs or treatises of the first\r\nhalf of our own century without seeing at a glance how every mind of\r\nhigh original scientific importance was permeated and disturbed by the\r\nfundamental questions aroused, but not fully answered, by Buffon,\r\nLamarck, and Erasmus Darwin. In Lyell's letters and in Agassiz's\r\nlectures, in the 'Botanic Journal' and the 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions,' in treatises on Madeira beetles and the Australian flora,\r\nwe find everywhere the thoughts of men profoundly influenced in a\r\nthousand directions by this universal evolutionary solvent and leaven.\r\n\r\nAnd while the world of thought was thus seething and moving restlessly\r\nbefore the wave of ideas set in motion by these various independent\r\nphilosophers, another group of causes in another field was rendering\r\nsmooth the path beforehand for the future champion of the amended\r\nevolutionism. Geology on the one hand and astronomy on the other were\r\nmaking men's minds gradually familiar with the conception of slow\r\nnatural development, as opposed to immediate and miraculous creation.\r\n\r\nThe rise of geology had been rapid and brilliant. In the last century it\r\nhad been almost universally believed that fossil organisms were the\r\nrelics of submerged and destroyed worlds, strange remnants of successive\r\nterrible mundane catastrophes. Cuvier himself, who had rendered immense\r\nservices to geological science by his almost unerring reconstructions of\r\nextinct animals, remained a partisan of the old theory of constant\r\ncataclysms and fresh creations throughout his whole life; but Lamarck,\r\nhere as elsewhere the prophet of the modern uniformitarian concept of\r\nnature, had already announced his grand idea that the ordinary process\r\nof natural laws sufficed to account for all the phenomena of the earth's\r\ncrust. In England, William Smith, the ingenious land surveyor, riding up\r\nand down on his daily task over the face of the country, became\r\nconvinced by his observations in the first years of the present century\r\nthat a fixed order of sequence could everywhere be traced among the\r\nvarious superincumbent geological strata. Modern scientific geology\r\ntakes its rise from the moment of this luminous and luminiferous\r\ndiscovery. With astonishing rapidity the sequence of strata was\r\neverywhere noted, and the succession of characteristic fossils mapped\r\nout, with the result of showing, however imperfectly at first, that the\r\nhistory of organic life upon the globe had followed a slow and regular\r\ncourse of constant development. Immediately whole schools of eager\r\nworkers employed themselves in investigating in separate detail the\r\nphenomena of these successive stages of unfolding life. Murchison, fresh\r\nfrom the Peninsular campaign, began to study the dawn of organic history\r\nin the gloom of the Silurian and Cambrian epochs. A group of less\r\narticulate but not less active workers like Buckland and Mantell\r\nperformed similar services for the carboniferous, the wealden, and the\r\ntertiary deposits. Sedgwick endeavoured to co-ordinate the whole range\r\nof then known facts into a single wide and comprehensive survey. De La\r\nBeche, Phillips, and Agassiz added their share to the great work of\r\nreconstruction. Last of all, among those who were contemporary and all\r\nbut coeval with Charles Darwin himself, Lyell boldly fought out the\r\nbattle of 'uniformitarianism,' proving, with all the accumulated weight\r\nof his encyclopædic and world-wide knowledge, that every known feature\r\nof geological development could be traced to the agency of causes now in\r\naction, and illustrated by means of slow secular changes still actually\r\ntaking place on earth before our very eyes.\r\n\r\nThe influence of these novel conceptions upon the growth and spread of\r\nevolutionary ideas was far-reaching and twofold. In the first place, the\r\ndiscovery of a definite succession of nearly related organic forms,\r\nfollowing one another with evident closeness through the various ages,\r\ninevitably suggested to every inquiring observer the possibility of\r\ntheir direct descent one from the other. In the second place, the\r\ndiscovery that geological formations were not really separated each from\r\nits predecessor by violent revolutions, but were the result of gradual\r\nand ordinary changes, discredited the old idea of frequent fresh\r\ncreations after each catastrophe, and familiarised the minds of men of\r\nscience with the alternative notion of slow and natural evolutionary\r\nprocesses. The past was seen to be in effect the parent of the present;\r\nthe present was recognised as the child of the past.\r\n\r\nCurrent astronomical theories also pointed inevitably in the same\r\ndirection. Kant, whose supereminent fame as a philosopher has almost\r\novershadowed his just claims as a profound thinker in physical science,\r\nhad already in the third quarter of the eighteenth century arrived at\r\nhis sublime nebular hypothesis, in which he suggested the possible\r\ndevelopment of stars, suns, planets, and satellites by the slow\r\ncontraction of very diffuse and incandescent haze-clouds. This\r\nmagnificent cosmical conception was seized and adapted by the genius of\r\nLaplace in his celestial system, and made familiar through his great\r\nwork to thinking minds throughout the whole of Europe. In England it was\r\nfurther modified and remodelled by Sir William Herschel, whose period of\r\nactive investigation coincided in part with Charles Darwin's early\r\nboyhood. The bearings of the nebular hypothesis upon the rise of\r\nDarwinian evolutionism are by no means remote: the entire modern\r\nscientific movement forms, in fact, a single great organic whole, of\r\nwhich the special doctrine of biological development is but a small\r\nseparate integral part. All the theories and doctrines which go to make\r\nit up display the one common trait that they reject the idea of direct\r\ncreative interposition from without, and attribute the entire existing\r\norder of nature to the regular unfolding of one undeviating continuous\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nYet another factor in the intellectual stir and bustle of the time must\r\nneeds be mentioned even in so short and cursory a sketch as this of the\r\ncauses which led to the Darwinian crisis. In 1798, Thomas Malthus, a\r\nclergyman of the Church of England, published the first edition of his\r\nfamous and much-debated 'Essay on the Principle of Population.' Malthus\r\nwas the first person who ever called public attention to the tendency of\r\npopulation to increase up to the utmost limit of subsistence, as well as\r\nto the necessary influence of starvation in checking its further\r\ndevelopment beyond that point. Though his essay dealt only with the\r\nquestion of reproduction in human societies, it was clear that it\r\npossessed innumerable analogies in every domain of animal and vegetable\r\nlife. The book ran through many successive editions with extraordinary\r\nrapidity for a work of its class, it was fiercely attacked and bravely\r\ndefended, it caused an immense amount of discussion and debate, and\r\nbesides its marvellous direct influence as a germinal power upon the\r\nwhole subsequent course of politico-economical and sociological thought,\r\nit produced also a remarkable indirect influence on the side current of\r\nbiological and speculative opinion. In particular, as we shall more\r\nfully see hereafter, it had an immediate effect in suggesting to the\r\nmind of the great naturalist who forms our present subject the embryo\r\nidea of 'natural selection.'\r\n\r\nSuch then was the intellectual and social world into which, early in the\r\npresent century, Charles Darwin found himself born. Everywhere around\r\nhim in his childhood and youth these great but formless evolutionary\r\nideas were brewing and fermenting. The scientific society of his elders\r\nand of the contemporaries among whom he grew up was permeated with the\r\nleaven of Laplace and of Lamarck, of Hutton and of Herschel. Inquiry was\r\nespecially everywhere rife as to the origin and nature of specific\r\ndistinctions among plants and animals. Those who believed in the\r\ndoctrine of Buffon and of the 'Zoonomia' and those who disbelieved in\r\nit, alike, were profoundly interested and agitated in soul by the\r\nfar-reaching implications of that fundamental problem. On every side\r\nevolutionism, in its crude form, was already in the air. Long before\r\nCharles Darwin himself published his conclusive 'Origin of Species,'\r\nevery thinking mind in the world of science, elder and younger, was\r\ndeeply engaged upon the self-same problem. Lyell and Horner in alternate\r\nfits were doubting and debating. Herbert Spencer had already frankly\r\naccepted the new idea with the profound conviction of _a priori_\r\nreasoning. Agassiz was hesitating and raising difficulties. Treviranus\r\nwas ardently proclaiming his unflinching adhesion. Oken was spinning in\r\nmetaphysical Germany his fanciful parodies of the Lamarckian\r\nhypothesis. Among the depths of Brazilian forests Bates was reading the\r\nstory of evolution on the gauze-like wings of tropical butterflies.\r\nUnder the scanty shade of Malayan palm-trees Wallace was independently\r\nspelling out in rude outline the very theory of survival of the fittest,\r\nwhich Charles Darwin himself was simultaneously perfecting and polishing\r\namong the memoirs and pamphlets of his English study. Wollaston in\r\nMadeira was pointing out the strange adaptations of the curious local\r\nsnails and beetles. Von Buch in the Canaries was coming to the\r\nconclusion that varieties may be slowly changed into permanent species.\r\nLecoq and Von Baer were gradually arriving, one by the botanical route,\r\nthe other by the embryological, at the same opinion. Before Charles\r\nDarwin was twenty, Dean Herbert had declared from the profound depth of\r\nhis horticultural knowledge that kinds were only mere fixed sports; and\r\nPatrick Matthew, in the appendix to a work on 'Naval Timber,' had\r\ncasually developed, without perceiving its importance, the actual\r\ndistinctive Darwinian doctrine of natural selection. Robert Chambers\r\npublished in 1844 his 'Vestiges of Creation,' in which Lamarck's theory\r\nwas impressed and popularised under a somewhat spoilt and mistaken form:\r\nit was not till 1859 that the first edition of the 'Origin of Species'\r\nburst like a thunderbolt upon the astonished world of unprepared and\r\nunscientific thinkers.\r\n\r\nThis general attitude of interest and inquiry is of deep importance to\r\nthe proper comprehension of Charles Darwin's life and work, and that for\r\ntwo distinct reasons. In the first place, the universal stir and deep\r\nprying into evolutionary questions which everywhere existed among\r\nscientific men in his early days was naturally communicated to a lad\r\nborn of a scientific family, and inheriting directly in blood and bone\r\nthe biological tastes and tendencies of Erasmus Darwin. In the second\r\nplace, the existence of such a deep and wide-spread curiosity as to\r\nultimate origins, and the common prevalence of profound uniformitarian\r\nand evolutionary views among philosophers and thinkers, made the\r\nacceptance of Charles Darwin's particular theory, when it at last\r\narrived, a comparatively easy and certain matter, because by it the\r\ncourse of organic development was assimilated, on credible grounds, to\r\nthe course of all other development in general, as then already widely\r\nrecognised. The first consideration helps us to account in part for the\r\nman himself; the second consideration helps us even more to account for\r\nthe great work which he was enabled in the end so successfully to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN AND HIS ANTECEDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the environment let us turn to the individual; from the world in\r\nwhich the man moved to the man who moved in it, and was in time destined\r\nto move it.\r\n\r\nWho was he, and whence did he derive his exceptional energy and\r\nintellectual panoply?\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin, the grandfather, the first of the line in whom the\r\ndistinctive Darwinian strain of intellect overtly displayed itself, was\r\nthe son of one Robert Darwin, a gentleman of Nottinghamshire, 'a person\r\nof curiosity,' with 'a taste for literature and science;' so that for\r\nfour generations at least, in the paternal line, the peculiar talents of\r\nthe Darwin family had been highly cultivated in either direction. Robert\r\nDarwin was an early member of the Spalding Club, a friend of Stukeley\r\nthe antiquary, and an embryo geologist, after the fantastic,\r\nhalf-superstitious fashion of his own time. Of his four sons, both\r\nRobert, the eldest, and Erasmus, the youngest, were authors and\r\nbotanists. Erasmus himself was a Cambridge man, and his natural bent of\r\nmind and energy led him irresistibly on to the study of medicine. Taking\r\nhis medical degree at his own university, and afterwards preparing for\r\npractice by attending Hunter's lectures in London, besides going\r\nthrough the regular medical course at Edinburgh, the young doctor\r\nfinally settled down as a physician at Nottingham, whence shortly\r\nafterward he removed to Lichfield, then the centre of a famous literary\r\ncoterie. So large a part of Charles Darwin's remarkable idiosyncrasy was\r\nderived by heredity from his paternal grandfather, that it may be worth\r\nwhile to dwell a little here in passing on the character and career of\r\nthis brilliant precursor of the great evolutionist. Both in the physical\r\nand in the spiritual sense, Erasmus Darwin was one among the truest and\r\nmost genuine ancestors of his grandson Charles.\r\n\r\nA powerful, robust, athletic man, in florid health and of temperate\r\nhabits, yet with the full-blooded tendency of the eighteenth century\r\nvividly displayed in his ample face and broad features, Erasmus Darwin\r\nbubbled over with irrepressible vivacity, the outward and visible sign\r\nof that overflowing energy which forms everywhere one of the most marked\r\ndetermining conditions of high genius. Strong in body and strong in\r\nmind, a teetotaler before teetotalism, an abolitionist before the\r\nanti-slavery movement, he had a great contempt for weaknesses and\r\nprejudices of every sort, and he rose far superior to the age in which\r\nhe lived in breadth of view and freedom from preconceptions. The\r\neighteenth century considered him, in its cautious, cut-and-dried\r\nfashion, a man of singular talent but of remarkably eccentric and unsafe\r\nopinions. Unfortunately for his lasting fame, Dr. Darwin was much given\r\nto writing poetry; and this poetry, though as ingenious as everything\r\nelse he did, had a certain false gallop of verse about it which has\r\ndoomed it to become since Canning's parody a sort of warning beacon\r\nagainst the worst faults of the post-Augustan decadence in the\r\nten-syllabled metre. Nobody now reads the 'Botanic Garden' except either\r\nto laugh at its exquisite extravagances, or to wonder at the queer\r\ntinsel glitter of its occasional clever rhetorical rhapsodies.\r\n\r\nBut in his alternative character of philosophic biologist, rejected by\r\nthe age which swallowed his poetry all applausive, Erasmus Darwin is\r\nwell worthy of the highest and deepest respect, as a prime founder and\r\nearly prophet of the evolutionary system. His 'Zoonomia,' 'which, though\r\ningenious, is built upon the most absurd hypothesis'--as men still said\r\nonly thirty years ago--contains in the germ the whole theory of organic\r\ndevelopment as understood up to the very moment of the publication of\r\nthe 'Origin of Species.' In it Dr. Darwin calls attention to 'the great\r\nchanges introduced into various animals by artificial or accidental\r\ncultivation,' a subject afterwards fully elucidated by his greater\r\ngrandson in his work on 'The Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication.' He specially notes 'the immense changes of shape and\r\ncolour' produced by man in rabbits and pigeons, the very species on\r\nwhich Charles Darwin subsequently made some of his most remarkable and\r\ninteresting observations. More than any previous writer, Erasmus Darwin,\r\nwith 'prophetic sagacity,' insisted strongly on the essential unity of\r\nparent and offspring--a truth which lies at the very base of all modern\r\nphilosophical biology. 'Owing to the imperfection of language,' wrote\r\nthe Lichfield doctor nearly a hundred years ago, 'the offspring is\r\ntermed a new animal, but is in truth a branch or elongation of the\r\nparent, since a part of the embryon-animal is or was a part of the\r\nparent, and therefore may retain some of the habits of the parent\r\nsystem.' He laid peculiar stress upon the hereditary nature of some\r\nacquired properties, such as the muscles of dancers or jugglers, and the\r\ndiseases incidental to special occupations. Nay, he even anticipated his\r\ngreat descendant in pointing out that varieties are often produced at\r\nfirst as mere 'sports' or accidental variations, as in the case of\r\nsix-fingered men, five-clawed fowls, or extra-toed cats, and are\r\nafterwards handed down by heredity to succeeding generations. Charles\r\nDarwin would have added that if these new stray peculiarities happened\r\nto prove advantageous to the species they would be naturally favoured in\r\nthe struggle for existence, while if they proved disadvantageous, or\r\neven neutral, they would die out at once or be bred out in the course of\r\na few crosses. That last truth of natural selection was the only\r\ncardinal one in the evolutionary system on which Erasmus Darwin did not\r\nactually forestall his more famous and greater namesake. For its full\r\nperception, the discovery of Malthus had to be collated with the\r\nspeculations of Buffon.\r\n\r\n'When we revolve in our minds,' says the eighteenth century prophet of\r\nevolution, 'the great similarity of structure which obtains in all the\r\nwarm-blooded animals, as well quadrupeds, birds, and amphibious animals,\r\nas in mankind; from the mouse and bat to the elephant and whale; one is\r\nled to conclude that they have alike been produced from a similar living\r\nfilament. In some this filament in its advance to maturity has acquired\r\nhands and fingers with a fine sense of touch, as in mankind. In others\r\nit has acquired claws or talons, as in tigers and eagles. In others,\r\ntoes with an intervening web or membrane, as in seals and geese. In\r\nothers it has acquired cloven hoofs, as in cows and swine; and whole\r\nhoofs in others, as in the horse: while in the bird kind this original\r\nliving filament has put forth wings instead of arms or legs, and\r\nfeathers instead of hair.' This is a very crude form of evolutionism\r\nindeed, but it is leading up by gradual stages to the finished and\r\nall-sided philosophy of physical life, which at last definitely\r\nformulates itself through the mouth of Charles Darwin. We shall see\r\nhereafter wherein Erasmus Darwin's conception of development chiefly\r\nfailed--in attributing evolution for the most part to the exertions and\r\nendeavours of the animal itself, rather than to inevitable survival of\r\nthe fittest among innumerable spontaneous variations--but we must at\r\nleast conclude our glimpse of his pregnant and suggestive work by\r\nquoting its great fundamental _aperçu_:--'As the earth and ocean were\r\nprobably peopled with vegetable productions long before the existence of\r\nanimals, and many families of these animals long before other families\r\nof them, shall we conjecture that one and the same kind of living\r\nfilament is and has been the cause of all organic life?'\r\n\r\nA few lines from the 'Temple of Nature,' one of Erasmus Darwin's poetic\r\nrhapsodies, containing his fully matured views on the origin of living\r\ncreatures, may be worth reproduction in further elucidation of his\r\nphilosophical position:--\r\n\r\n     'Organic life beneath the shoreless waves\r\n     Was born, and nursed in ocean's pearly caves;\r\n     First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass.\r\n     Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;\r\n     These, as successive generations bloom,\r\n     New powers acquire, and larger limbs assume;\r\n     Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,\r\n     And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.'\r\n\r\nHave we not here the very beginnings of Charles Darwin? Do we not see,\r\nin these profound and fundamental suggestions, not merely hints as to\r\nthe evolution of evolution, but also as to the evolution of the\r\nevolutionist?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, though Erasmus Darwin defined a fool to his friend\r\nEdgeworth as 'a man who never tried an experiment in his life,' he was\r\nwanting himself in the rigorous and patient inductive habit which so\r\nstrikingly distinguished his grandson Charles. That trait, as we shall\r\npresently see, the biological chief of the nineteenth century derived in\r\nall probability from another root of his genealogical tree. Erasmus\r\nDarwin gave us brilliant suggestions rather than cumulative proof: he\r\napologised in his 'Zoonomia' for 'many conjectures not supported by\r\naccurate investigation or conclusive experiments,' Such an apology would\r\nhave been simply impossible to the painstaking spirit of his grandson\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin was twice married. His first wife was Mary, daughter of\r\nMr. Charles Howard, of Lichfield, and it was her son, Robert Waring\r\nDarwin, who became the father of our hero, Charles. It is fashionable to\r\nsay, in this and sundry other like cases, that the mental energy skips a\r\ngeneration. People have said so in the case of that intermediate\r\nMendelssohn who was son of Moses Mendelssohn, the philosopher, and\r\nfather of Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn, the composer--that mere link in a\r\nmarvellous chain who was wont to observe of himself in the decline of\r\nlife, that in his youth he was called the son of the great Mendelssohn,\r\nand in his old age the father of the great Mendelssohn. As a matter of\r\nfact, one may fairly doubt whether such a case of actual skipping is\r\never possible in the nature of things. In the particular instance of\r\nRobert Waring Darwin at least we may be pretty sure that the distinctive\r\nDarwinian strain of genius lay merely latent rather than dormant: that\r\nit did not display itself to the world at large, but that it persisted\r\nsilently as powerful as ever within the remote recesses of the thinking\r\norganism. Not every man brings out before men all that is within him.\r\nRobert Waring Darwin was a physician at Shrewsbury; and he attained at\r\nleast sufficient scientific eminence in his own time to become a Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society, in days when that honour was certainly not readily\r\nconferred upon country doctors of modest reputation. Charles Darwin says\r\nof him plainly, 'He was incomparably the most acute observer whom I ever\r\nknew.' It may well have been that Robert Darwin lived and died, as his\r\nfamous son lived for fifty years of his great life, in comparative\r\nsilence and learned retirement; for we must never forget that if Charles\r\nDarwin had only completed the first half century of his laborious\r\nexistence, he would have been remembered merely as the author of an\r\nentertaining work on the voyage of the 'Beagle,' a plausible theory of\r\ncoral islands, and a learned monograph on the fossil barnacles. During\r\nall those years, in fact, he had really done little else than collect\r\nmaterial for the work of his lifetime. If we judge men by outward\r\nperformance only, we may often be greatly mistaken in our estimates:\r\npotentiality is wider than actuality; what a man does is never a certain\r\nor extreme criterion of what he can do.\r\n\r\nThe Darwins, indeed, were all a mighty folk, of varied powers and varied\r\nattainments. Erasmus's brother, Robert, was the author of a work on\r\nbotany, which long enjoyed a respectable repute. Of his sons, one, Sir\r\nFrancis Darwin, was noted as a keen observer of animals; a second,\r\nCharles, who died at twenty-one, was already the author of a very\r\nvaluable medical essay; while the third, Robert, was the Shrewsbury\r\nF.R.S., the father of our great evolutionary thinker. And among Charles\r\nDarwin's own cousins, one is Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, the philologist; a\r\nsecond was the late Sir Henry Holland; and a third is Mr. Francis\r\nGalton, the author of that essentially Darwinian book, 'Hereditary\r\nGenius.'\r\n\r\nRobert Waring Darwin took to himself a wife from another very great and\r\neminent family. He married Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of Josiah\r\nWedgwood, the famous potter; and from these two silent representatives\r\nof powerful stocks, Charles Robert Darwin, the father of modern\r\nevolutionary biology, was born at Shrewsbury, on February the 12th,\r\n1809. That Wedgwood connection, again, is no mere casual or unimportant\r\nincident in the previous life-history of the Darwinian originality; it\r\nthrows a separate clear light of its own upon the peculiar and\r\nadmirably compounded idiosyncrasy of Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\nA man, indeed, owes on the average quite as much to his mother's as to\r\nhis father's family. It is a mere unscientific old-world prejudice which\r\nmakes us for the most part count ancestry in the direct ascending male\r\nline alone, to the complete neglect of the equally important maternal\r\npedigree. Prom the biological point of view, at least, every individual\r\nis a highly complex compound of hereditary elements, a resultant of\r\nnumerous converging forces, a meeting place of two great streams of\r\ninheritance, each of which is itself similarly made up by the like\r\nconfluence of innumerable distinct prior tributaries. Between these two\r\nit is almost impossible for us accurately to distribute any given\r\nindividuality. How much Charles Darwin owed to the Darwins, and how much\r\nhe owed in turn to the Wedgwoods, no man is yet psychologist enough or\r\nphysiologist enough to say. But that he owed a great deal to either\r\nstrong and vigorous strain we may even now quite safely take for\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nThe Wedgwood family were 'throwers' by handicraft, superior artisans\r\nlong settled at Burslem, in the Staffordshire potteries. Josiah, the\r\nyoungest of thirteen children, lamed by illness in early life, was\r\nturned by this happy accident from his primitive task as a 'thrower' to\r\nthe more artistic and original work of producing ornamental coloured\r\nearthenware. Skilful and indefatigable, of indomitable energy and with\r\ngreat powers of forcing his way in life against all obstacles, young\r\nWedgwood rose rapidly by his own unaided exertions to be a master\r\npotter, and a manufacturer of the famous unglazed black porcelain.\r\nThose were the darkest days of industrial art and decorative handicraft\r\nin modern England. Josiah Wedgwood, by his marked originality and force\r\nof character, succeeded in turning the current of national taste, and\r\ncreating among us a new and distinctly higher type of artistic\r\nworkmanship. His activity, however, was not confined to his art alone,\r\nbut found itself a hundred other different outlets in the most varied\r\ndirections. When his potteries needed enlargement to meet the increased\r\ndemand, he founded for the hands employed upon his works the model\r\nindustrial village of Etruria. When Brindley began cutting artificial\r\nwaterways across the broad face of central England, it was in the great\r\npotter that he found his chief ally in promoting the construction of the\r\nGrand Trunk Canal. Wedgwood, indeed, was a builder of schools and a\r\nmaker of roads; a chemist and an artist; a friend of Watt and an\r\nemployer of Flaxman. In short, like Erasmus Darwin, he possessed that\r\nprime essential in the character of genius, an immense underlying stock\r\nof energy. And with it there went its best concomitant, the 'infinite\r\ncapacity for taking pains.' Is it not probable that in their joint\r\ndescendant, the brilliant but discursive and hazardous genius of Erasmus\r\nDarwin was balanced and regulated by soberer qualities inherited\r\ndirectly from the profound industry of the painstaking potter? When\r\nlater on we find Charles Darwin spending hours in noting the successive\r\nmovements of the tendrils in a plant, or watching for long years the\r\nhabits and manners of earthworms in flower-pots, may we not reasonably\r\nconjecture that he derived no little share of his extraordinary\r\npatience, carefulness, and minuteness of handicraft from his mother's\r\nfather, Josiah Wedgwood?\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the two main component elements, paternal and maternal,\r\nfrom which the striking personality of Charles Darwin was no doubt for\r\nthe most part ultimately built up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLY DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Chester express steams out of Shrewsbury station, you see on your\r\nleft, overhanging the steep bank of Severn, a large, square,\r\nsubstantial-looking house, known as the Mount, the birthplace of the\r\nauthor of the 'Origin of Species.' There, in the comfortable home he had\r\nbuilt for himself, Dr. Robert Darwin, the father, lived and worked for\r\nfifty years of unobtrusive usefulness. He had studied medicine at\r\nEdinburgh and Leyden, and had even travelled a little in Germany, before\r\nhe settled down in the quiet old Salopian town, where for half a century\r\nhis portly figure and yellow chaise were familiar objects of the\r\ncountry-side for miles around. Among a literary society which included\r\nColeridge's friends, the Tayleurs, and where Hazlitt listened with\r\ndelight to the great poet's 'music of the spheres,' in High Street\r\nUnitarian Chapel, the Mount kept up with becoming dignity the family\r\ntraditions of the Darwins and the Wedgwoods as a local centre of\r\nsweetness and light.\r\n\r\nOn February the 12th, 1809, Charles Darwin first saw the light of day in\r\nthis his father's house at Shrewsbury. Time and place were both\r\npropitious. Born in a cultivated scientific family, surrounded from his\r\nbirth by elevating influences, and secured beforehand from the cramping\r\nnecessity of earning his own livelihood by his own exertions, the boy\r\nwas destined to grow up to full maturity in the twenty-one years of slow\r\ndevelopment that immediately preceded the passing of the first Reform\r\nAct. The thunder of the great European upheaval had grown silent at\r\nWaterloo when he was barely six years old, and his boyhood was passed\r\namid country sights and sounds during that long period of reconstruction\r\nand assimilation which followed the fierce volcanic outburst of the\r\nFrench Revolution. Happy in the opportunity of his birth, he came upon\r\nthe world eight years after the first publication of Lamarck's\r\nremarkable speculations, and for the first twenty-two years of his life\r\nhe was actually the far younger contemporary of the great French\r\nevolutionary philosopher. Eleven years before his arrival upon the scene\r\nMalthus had set forth his 'Principle of Population.' Charles Darwin thus\r\nentered upon a stage well prepared for him, and he entered it with an\r\nidiosyncrasy exactly adapted for making the best of the situation. The\r\nsoil had been thoroughly turned and dressed beforehand: Charles Darwin's\r\nseed had only to fall upon it in order to spring up and bear fruit a\r\nhundredfold, in every field of science or speculation.\r\n\r\nFor it was not biology alone that he was foredoomed to revolutionise,\r\nbut the whole range of human thought, and perhaps even ultimately of\r\nhuman action.\r\n\r\nIs it mere national prejudice which makes one add with congratulatory\r\npleasure that Darwin was born in England, rather than in France, in\r\nGermany, or in America? Perhaps so; perhaps not. For the English\r\nintellect does indeed seem more capable than most of uniting high\r\nspeculative ability with high practical skill and experience: and of\r\nthat union of rare qualities Darwin himself was a most conspicuous\r\nexample. It is probable that England has produced more of the great\r\norganising and systematising intellects than any other modern country.\r\n\r\nAmong those thinkers in his own line who stood more nearly abreast of\r\nDarwin in the matter of age, Lyell was some eleven years his senior, and\r\ncontributed not a little (though quite unconsciously) by his work and\r\nconclusions to the formation of Darwin's own peculiar scientific\r\nopinions. The veteran Owen, who still survives him, was nearly five\r\nyears older than Darwin, and also helped to a great extent in giving\r\nform and exactness to his great contemporary's anatomical ideas.\r\nHumboldt, who preceded our English naturalist in the matter of time by\r\nno less than forty years, might yet almost rank as coeval in some\r\nrespects, owing to his long and active life, his late maturity, and the\r\nvery recent date of his greatest and most thought-compelling work, the\r\n'Cosmos' (begun when Humboldt was seventy-five, and finished when he\r\nlacked but ten years of his century), in itself a sort of preparation\r\nfor due acceptance of the Darwinian theories. In fact, as many as fifty\r\nyears of their joint lives coincided entirely one with the other's.\r\nAgassiz antedated Darwin by two years. On the other hand, among the men\r\nwho most helped on the recognition of Darwin's theories, Hooker and\r\nLewes were his juniors by eight years, Herbert Spencer by eleven,\r\nWallace by thirteen, and Huxley by sixteen. His cousin, Francis Galton,\r\nanother grandson of Erasmus Darwin, and joint inheritor of the\r\ndistinctive family biological ply, was born at the same date as Alfred\r\nRussell Wallace, thirteen years after Charles Darwin. In such a goodly\r\ngalaxy of workers was the Darwinian light destined to shine through the\r\nmiddle of the century, as one star excelleth another in glory.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin was the second son: but nature refuses doggedly to\r\nacknowledge the custom of primogeniture. His elder brother, Erasmus, a\r\nman of mute and inarticulate ability, with a sardonic humour alien to\r\nhis race, extorted unwonted praise from the critical pen of Thomas\r\nCarlyle, who 'for intellect rather preferred him to his brother\r\nCharles.' But whatever spark of the Darwinian genius was really innate\r\nin Erasmus the Less died with him unacknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe boy was educated (so they call it) at Shrewsbury Grammar School,\r\nunder sturdy Sam Butler, afterwards Bishop of Lichfield; and there he\r\npicked up so much Latin and Greek as was then considered absolutely\r\nessential to the due production of an English gentleman. Happily for the\r\nworld, having no taste for the classics, he escaped the ordeal with\r\nlittle injury to his individuality. His mother had died while he was\r\nstill a child, but his father, that 'acute observer,' no doubt taught\r\nhim to know and love nature. At sixteen he went to Edinburgh University,\r\nthen rendered famous by a little knot of distinguished professors, and\r\nthere he remained for two years. Already at school he had made himself\r\nnotable by his love of collecting--the first nascent symptom of the\r\nnaturalist bent. He collected everything, shells, eggs, minerals,\r\ncoins, nay, since postage stamps were then not yet invented, even\r\nfranks. But at Edinburgh he gave the earliest distinct evidence of his\r\ndefinite scientific tastes by contributing to the local academic society\r\na paper on the floating eggs of the common sea-mat, in which he had even\r\nthen succeeded in discovering for the first time organs of locomotion.\r\nThence he proceeded to Christ's College, Cambridge. The Darwins were\r\nluckily a Cambridge family: luckily, let us say, for had it been\r\notherwise--had young Darwin been distorted from his native bent by Plato\r\nand Aristotle, and plunged deep into the mysteries of Barbara and\r\nCelarent, as would infallibly have happened to him at the sister\r\nuniversity--who can tell how long we might have had to wait in vain for\r\nthe 'Origin of Species' and the 'Descent of Man'? But Cambridge, which\r\nrejoiced already in the glory of Newton, was now to match it by the\r\nglory of Darwin. In its academical course, the mathematical wedge had\r\nalways kept open a dim passage for physical science; and at the exact\r\nmoment when Darwin was an undergraduate at Christ's--from 1827 to\r\n1831--the university had the advantage of several good scientific\r\nteachers, and amongst them one, Professor Henslow, a well-known\r\nbotanist, who took a special interest in young Darwin's intellectual\r\ndevelopment. There, too, he met with Sedgwick, Airy, Ramsay, and\r\nnumerous other men of science, whose intercourse with him must no doubt\r\nhave contributed largely to mould and form the future cast of his\r\npeculiar philosophical idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\nIt was to Henslow's influence that Darwin in later years attributed in\r\ngreat part his powerful taste for natural history. But in truth the\r\nascription of such high praise to his early teacher smacks too much of\r\nthe Darwinian modesty to be accepted at once without demur by the candid\r\ncritic. The naturalist, like the poet, is born, not made. How much more,\r\nthen, must this needs be the case with the grandson of Erasmus Darwin\r\nand of Josiah Wedgwood? As a matter of fact, already at Edinburgh the\r\nlad had loved to spend his days among the sea-beasts and wrack of the\r\nInches in the Firth of Forth; and it was through the instrumentality of\r\nhis 'brother entomologists' that he first became acquainted with Henslow\r\nhimself when he removed to Cambridge. The good professor could not make\r\nhim into a naturalist: inherited tendencies and native energies had done\r\nthat for him already from his very cradle.\r\n\r\n'Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam;' and it was well that Darwin took up\r\nat Cambridge with the study of geology as his first love. For geology\r\nwas then the living and moving science, as astronomy had been in the\r\nsixteenth century, and as biology is at the present day--the\r\ngrowing-point, so to speak, of European development, whence all great\r\nthings might naturally be expected. Moreover, it was and is the central\r\nscience of the concrete class, having relations with astronomy on the\r\none hand, and with biology on the other; concerned alike with cosmical\r\nchances or changes on this side, and with the minutest facts of organic\r\nnature on that; the meeting-place and border-land of all the separate\r\nbranches of study that finally bear upon the complex problems of our\r\nhuman life. No other subject of investigation was so well calculated to\r\nrouse Darwin's interest in the ultimate questions of evolution or\r\ncreation, of sudden cataclysm or gradual growth, of miraculous\r\nintervention or slow development. Here, if anywhere, his enigmas were\r\nall clearly propounded to him by the inarticulate stony sphinxes; he had\r\nonly to riddle them out for himself as he went along in after years with\r\nthe aid of the successive side-lights thrown upon the world by the\r\nunconnected lanterns of Lamarck and of Malthus.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, then, Darwin did not waste his time at Cambridge\r\nover the vain and frivolous pursuits of the classical tripos. He\r\npreferred to work at his own subjects in his own way, and to leave the\r\nshort-lived honours of the schools to those who cared for them and for\r\nnothing higher. He came out with the _οἱ πολλοί_ in 1831, and\r\nthenceforth proceeded to study life in the wider university for which\r\nhis natural inclinations more properly fitted him. The world was all\r\nbefore him where to choose, and he chose that better part which shall\r\nnot be taken away from him as long as the very memory of science\r\nsurvives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDARWIN'S WANDER-YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had Darwin taken his pass degree at Cambridge when the great\r\nevent of his life occurred which, more than anything else perhaps, gave\r\nthe final direction to his categorical genius in the line it was\r\nthenceforth so successfully to follow. In the autumn of 1831, when\r\nDarwin was just twenty-two, it was decided by Government to send a\r\nten-gun brig, the 'Beagle,' under command of Captain Fitzroy, to\r\ncomplete the unfinished survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, to map\r\nout the shores of Chili and Peru, to visit several of the Pacific\r\narchipelagoes, and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round\r\nthe whole world. This was an essentially scientific expedition, and\r\nCaptain Fitzroy, afterwards so famous as the meteorological admiral, was\r\na scientific officer of the highest type. He was anxious to be\r\naccompanied on his cruise by a competent naturalist who would undertake\r\nthe collection and preservation of the animals and plants discovered on\r\nthe voyage, for which purpose he generously offered to give up a share\r\nof his own cabin accommodation. Professor Henslow seized upon the\r\nopportunity to recommend for the post his promising pupil, young Darwin,\r\n'grandson of the poet.' Darwin gladly volunteered his services without\r\nsalary, and partly paid his own expenses on condition of being permitted\r\nto retain in his own possession the animals and plants he collected on\r\nthe journey. The 'Beagle' set sail from Devonport on December the 27th,\r\n1831; she returned to Falmouth on October the 2nd, 1836.\r\n\r\nThat long five years' cruise around the world, the journal of which\r\nDarwin has left us in the 'Voyage of the \"Beagle,\"' proved a marvellous\r\nepoch in the great naturalist's quiet career. It left its abiding mark\r\ndeeply imprinted on all his subsequent life and thinking. Lamarck and\r\nErasmus Darwin were cabinet biologists, who had never beheld with their\r\nown eyes the great round world and all that therein is; Charles Darwin\r\nhad the inestimable privilege of seeing for himself, at first hand, a\r\nlarge part of the entire globe and of the creatures that inhabit it.\r\nEven to have caught one passing glimpse of the teeming life of the\r\ntropics is in itself an education; to the naturalist it is more, it is a\r\nrevelation. Our starved little northern fauna and flora, the mere\r\nleavings of the vast ice sheets that spread across our zone in the\r\nglacial epoch, show us a world depopulated of all its largest,\r\nstrangest, and fiercest creatures; a world dwarfed in all its component\r\nelements, and immensely differing in ten thousand ways from that rich,\r\nluxuriant, over-stocked hot-house in which the first great problems of\r\nevolution were practically worked out by survival of the fittest. But\r\nthe tropics preserve for us still in all their jungles something of the\r\ntangled, thickly-peopled aspect which our planet must have presented for\r\ncountless ages in all latitudes before the advent of primæval man. We\r\nnow know that throughout the greater part of geological time,\r\nessentially tropical conditions existed unbroken over the whole surface\r\nof the entire earth, from the Antarctic continent to the shores of\r\nGreenland; so that some immediate acquaintance at least with the\r\nequatorial world is of immense value to the philosophical naturalist for\r\nthe sake of the analogies it inevitably suggests; and it is a\r\nsignificant fact that almost all those great and fruitful thinkers who\r\nin our own time have done good work in the wider combination of\r\nbiological facts have themselves passed a considerable number of years\r\nin investigating the conditions of tropical nature. Europe and England\r\nare at the ends of the earth; the tropics are biological head-quarters.\r\nThe equatorial zone is therefore the true school for the historian of\r\nlife in its more universal and lasting aspects.\r\n\r\nNor was that all. The particular countries visited by the 'Beagle'\r\nduring the course of her long and varied cruise happened to be exactly\r\nsuch as were naturally best adapted for bringing out the latent\r\npotentialities of Darwin's mind, and suggesting to his active and\r\nreceptive brain those deep problems of life and its environment which he\r\nafterwards wrought out with such subtle skill and such consummate\r\npatience in the 'Origin of Species' and the 'Descent of Man.' The Cape\r\nde Verdes, and the other Atlantic islands, with their scanty population\r\nof plants and animals, composed for the most part of waifs and strays\r\ndrifted to their barren rocks by ocean currents, or blown out helplessly\r\nto sea by heavy winds; Brazil, with its marvellous contrasting wealth of\r\ntropical luxuriance and self-strangling fertility, a new province of\r\ninterminable delights to the soul of the enthusiastic young collector;\r\nthe South American pampas, with their colossal remains of extinct\r\nanimals, huge geological precursors of the stunted modern sloths and\r\narmadillos that still inhabit the self-same plains; Tierra del Fuego,\r\nwith its almost Arctic climate, and its glimpses into the secrets of the\r\nmost degraded savage types; the vast range of the Andes and the\r\nCordilleras, with their volcanic energy and their closely crowded\r\nhorizontal belts of climatic life; the South Sea Islands, those\r\nparadises of the Pacific, Hesperian fables true, alike for the lover of\r\nthe picturesque and the biological student; Australia, that surviving\r\nfragment of an extinct world, with an antiquated fauna whose archaic\r\ncharacter still closely recalls the European life of ten million years\r\nback in the secondary epoch: all these and many others equally novel and\r\nequally instructive passed in long alternating panorama before Darwin's\r\neyes, and left their images deeply photographed for ever after on the\r\nlasting tablets of his retentive memory. That was the real great\r\nuniversity in which he studied nature and read for his degree. Our\r\nevolutionist was now being educated.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the journal of this long cruise, which Darwin\r\nafterwards published in an enlarged form, it is impossible not to be\r\nstruck at every turn with the way in which his inquisitive mind again\r\nand again recurs to the prime elements of those great problems towards\r\nwhose solution he afterwards so successfully pointed out the path. The\r\nDarwinian ideas are all already there in the germ; the embryo form of\r\nthe 'Origin of Species' plays in and out on every page with the\r\nquaintest elusiveness. We are always just on the very point of catching\r\nit; and every now and again we do actually all but catch it in essence\r\nand spirit, though ever still its bodily shape persistently evades us.\r\nQuestions of geographical distribution, of geological continuity, of the\r\ninfluence of climate, of the modifiability of instinct, of the effects\r\nof surrounding conditions, absorb the young observer's vivid interest at\r\nevery step, wherever he lands. He is all unconsciously collecting notes\r\nand materials in profuse abundance for his great work; he is thinking in\r\nrough outline the new thoughts which are hereafter to revolutionise the\r\nthought of humanity.\r\n\r\nFive years are a great slice out of a man's life: those five years of\r\nceaseless wandering by sea and land were spent by Charles Darwin in\r\naccumulating endless observations and hints for the settlement of the\r\nprofound fundamental problems in which he was even then so deeply\r\ninterested. The 'Beagle' sailed from England to the Cape de Verdes, and\r\nalready, even before she had touched her first land, the young\r\nnaturalist had observed with interest that the impalpably fine dust\r\nwhich fell on deck contained no less than sixty-seven distinct organic\r\nforms, two of them belonging to species peculiar to South America. In\r\nsome of the dust he found particles of stone so very big that they\r\nmeasured 'above the thousandth of an inch square;' and after this fact,\r\nsays the keen student, 'one need not be surprised at the diffusion of\r\nthe far lighter and smaller sporules of cryptogamic plants.' Would\r\nErasmus Darwin have noticed these minute points and their implications\r\none wonders? Probably not. May we not see in the observation partly the\r\nhereditary tendencies of Josiah Wedgwood towards minute investigation\r\nand accuracy of detail, partly the influence of the scientific\r\ntime-wave, and the careful training under Professor Henslow? Erasmus\r\nDarwin comes before us rather as the brilliant and ingenious amateur,\r\nhis grandson Charles as the instructed and fully equipped final product\r\nof the scientific schools.\r\n\r\nAt St. Paul's Rocks, once more, a mass of new volcanic peaks rising\r\nabruptly from the midst of the Atlantic, the naturalist of the 'Beagle'\r\nnotes with interest that feather and dirt-feeding and parasitic insects\r\nor spiders are the first inhabitants to take up their quarters on\r\nrecently formed oceanic islands. This problem of the peopling of new\r\nlands, indeed, so closely connected with the evolution of new species,\r\nnecessarily obtruded itself upon his attention again and again during\r\nhis five years' cruise; and in some cases, especially that of the\r\nGalapagos Islands, the curious insular faunas and floras which he\r\nobserved upon this trip, composed as they were of mere casual straylings\r\nfrom adjacent shores, produced upon his mind a very deep and lasting\r\nimpression, whose traces one may without difficulty discern on every\r\nsecond page of the 'Origin of Species.'\r\n\r\nOn the last day of February, 1832, the 'Beagle' came to anchor in the\r\nharbour of Bahia, and young Darwin caught sight for the first time of\r\nthe mutually strangling luxuriance of tropical vegetation. Nowhere on\r\nearth are the finest conditions of tropical life more fully realised\r\nthan in the tangled depths of the great uncleared Brazilian forests,\r\nwhich everywhere gird round like a natural palisade with their\r\nimpenetrable belt the narrow and laborious clearings of over-mastered\r\nman. The rich alluvial silt of mighty river systems, the immemorial\r\nmanuring of the virgin soil, the fierce energy of an almost equatorial\r\nsun, and the universal presence of abundant water, combine to make life\r\nin that marvellous region unusually wealthy, varied, and crowded, so\r\nthat the struggle for existence is there perhaps more directly visible\r\nto the seeing eye than in any other known portion of God's universe.\r\n'Delight itself,' says Darwin in his journal, with that naive simplicity\r\nwhich everywhere forms the chief charm of his direct and unaffected\r\nliterary style--'delight itself is a weak term to express the feelings\r\nof a naturalist who for the first time has wandered by himself in a\r\nBrazilian forest. The elegance of the grasses, the novelty of the\r\nparasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the glossy green of the\r\nfoliage, but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation, filled\r\nme with admiration.' In truth, among those huge buttressed trunks,\r\noverhung by the unbroken canopy of foliage on the vast spreading and\r\ninterlacing branches, festooned with lianas and drooping lichens, or\r\nbeautified by the pendent alien growth of perfumed orchids, Darwin's\r\nmind must indeed have found congenial food for apt reflection, and\r\ninfinite opportunities for inference and induction. Prom the mere\r\npicturesque point of view, indeed, the naturalist enjoys such sights as\r\nthis a thousand times more truly and profoundly than the mere casual\r\nunskilled observer: for it is a shallow, self-flattering mistake of\r\nvulgar and narrow minds to suppose that fuller knowledge and clearer\r\ninsight can destroy or impair the beauty of beautiful objects--as who\r\nshould imagine that a great painter appreciates the sunset less than a\r\nsilly boy or a sentimental schoolgirl. As a matter of fact, the\r\nnaturalist knows and admires a thousand exquisite points of detail in\r\nevery flower and every insect which only he himself and the true artist\r\ncan equally delight in. And a keen intellectual and æsthetic joy in the\r\nglorious fecundity and loveliness of nature was everywhere present to\r\nDarwin's mind. But, beyond and above even that, there was also the\r\narchitectonic delight of the great organiser in the presence of a noble\r\norganised product: the peculiar pleasure felt only by the man in whose\r\nbroader soul all minor details fall at once into their proper place, as\r\ncomponent elements in one great consistent and harmonious whole--a\r\nsympathetic pleasure akin to that with which an architect views the\r\ninterior of Ely and of Lincoln, or a musician listens to the linked\r\nharmonies of the 'Messiah' and the 'Creation.' The scheme of nature was\r\nnow unfolding itself visibly and clearly before Charles Darwin's very\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAfter eighteen memorable days spent with unceasing delight at Bahia, the\r\n'Beagle' sailed again for Rio, where Darwin stopped for three months, to\r\nimprove his acquaintance with the extraordinary wealth of the South\r\nAmerican fauna and flora. Collecting insects was here his chief\r\noccupation, and it is interesting to note even at this early period how\r\nhis attention was attracted by some of those strange alluring devices on\r\nthe part of the males for charming their partners which afterwards\r\nformed the principal basis for his admirable theory of sexual selection,\r\nso fully developed in the 'Descent of Man.' 'Several times,' he says,\r\n'when a pair [of butterflies], probably male and female, were chasing\r\neach other in an irregular course, they passed within a few yards of me;\r\nand I distinctly heard a clicking noise, similar to that produced by a\r\ntoothed wheel passing under a spring catch.' In like manner he observed\r\nhere the instincts of tropical ants, the habits of phosphorescent\r\ninsects, and the horrid practice of that wasp-like creature, the sphex,\r\nwhich stuffs the clay cells of its larvæ full of half-dead spiders and\r\nwrithing caterpillars, so stung with devilish avoidance of vital parts\r\nas to be left quite paralysed yet still alive, as future food for the\r\ndeveloping grubs. Cases like these helped naturally to shake the young\r\nbiologist's primitive faith in the cheap and crude current theories of\r\nuniversal beneficence, and to introduce that wholesome sceptical\r\nreaction against received dogma which is the necessary groundwork and\r\ndue preparation for all great progressive philosophical thinking.\r\n\r\nIn July they set sail again for Monte Video, where the important\r\nquestion of climate and vegetation began to interest young Darwin's\r\nmind. Uruguay is almost entirely treeless; and this curious phenomenon,\r\nin a comparatively moist sub-tropical plain-land, struck him as a\r\nremarkable anomaly, and set him speculating on its probable cause.\r\nAustralia, he remembered, was far more arid, and yet its interior was\r\neverywhere covered by whole forests of quaint indigenous gum-trees.\r\nCould it be that there were no trees adapted to the climate? As yet, the\r\ntrue causes of geographical distribution had not clearly dawned upon\r\nDarwin's mind; but that a young man of twenty-three should seriously\r\nbusy himself about such problems of ultimate causation at all is in\r\nitself a sufficiently pointed and remarkable phenomenon. It was here,\r\ntoo, that he first saw that curious animal, the Tucutuco, a true rodent\r\nwith the habits of a mole, which is almost always found in a blind\r\ncondition. With reference to this singular creature, there occurs in his\r\njournal one of those interesting anticipatory passages which show the\r\nrough workings of the distinctive evolutionary Darwinian concept in its\r\nearlier stages. 'Considering the strictly subterranean habits of the\r\nTucutuco,' he writes, 'the blindness, though so common, cannot be a very\r\nserious evil; yet it appears strange that any animal should possess an\r\norgan frequently subject to be injured. Lamarck would have been\r\ndelighted with this fact, had he known it, when speculating (probably\r\nwith more truth than usual with him) on the gradually acquired blindness\r\nof the Aspalax, a gnawer living under the ground, and of the Proteus, a\r\nreptile living in dark caverns filled with water; in both of which\r\nanimals the eye is in an almost rudimentary state, and is covered by a\r\ntendinous membrane and skin. In the common mole the eye is\r\nextraordinarily small but perfect, though many anatomists doubt whether\r\nit is connected with the true optic nerve; its vision must certainly be\r\nimperfect, though probably useful to the animal when it leaves its\r\nburrow. In the Tucutuco, which I believe never comes to the surface of\r\nthe ground, the eye is rather larger, but often rendered blind and\r\nuseless, though without apparently causing any inconvenience to the\r\nanimal: no doubt Lamarck would have said that the Tucutuco is now\r\npassing into the state of the Aspalax and Proteus.' The passage is\r\ninstructive both as showing that Darwin was already familiar with\r\nLamarck's writings, and as pointing out the natural course of his own\r\nfuture development.\r\n\r\nFor the two years from her arrival at Monte Video, the 'Beagle' was\r\nemployed in surveying the eastern coast of South America; and Darwin\r\nenjoyed unusual opportunities for studying the geology, the zoology, and\r\nthe botany of the surrounding districts during all that period. It was a\r\nsuggestive field indeed for the young naturalist. The curious\r\nrelationship of the gigantic fossil armour-plated animals to the\r\nexisting armadillo, of the huge megatherium to the modern sloths, and of\r\nthe colossal ant-eaters to their degenerate descendants at the present\r\nday, formed one of the direct inciting causes to the special study which\r\nproduced at last the 'Origin of Species.' In the Introduction to that\r\nimmortal work Darwin wrote, some twenty-seven years later, 'When on\r\nboard H.M.S. \"Beagle\" as naturalist, I was much struck with certain\r\nfacts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South\r\nAmerica, and in the geological relations of the present to the past\r\ninhabitants of that continent. These facts, as will be seen in the\r\nlatter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the origin\r\nof species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of\r\nour greatest philosophers.' And in the body of the work itself he refers\r\nover and over again to numberless observations made by himself during\r\nthis period of rapid psychological development--observations on the\r\nabsence of recent geological formations along the lately upheaved South\r\nAmerican coast; on the strange extinction of the horse in La Plata; on\r\nthe affinities of the extinct and recent species; on the effect of\r\nminute individual peculiarities in preserving life under special\r\ncircumstances; and on the influence of insects and blood-sucking bats in\r\ndetermining the existence of the larger naturalised mammals in parts of\r\nBrazil and the Argentine Republic. It was the epoch of wide collection\r\nof facts, to be afterwards employed in brilliant generalisations: the\r\nmaterials for the 'Origin of Species' were being slowly accumulated in\r\nthe numberless pigeon-holes of the Darwinian memory.\r\n\r\nAmong the facts thus industriously gathered by Darwin in the two years\r\nspent on the South American coast were several curious instincts of the\r\ncuckoo-like molothrus, of the owl of the Pampas, and of the American\r\nostrich. A few sentences scattered here and there through this part of\r\nthe 'Naturalist's Journal' may well be extracted in the present place as\r\nshowing, better than any mere secondhand description could do, the slow\r\ngerminating process of the 'Origin of Species.' In speaking of the\r\ntoxodon, that strange extinct South American mammal, the young author\r\nremarks acutely that, though in size it equalled the elephant and the\r\nmegatherium, the structure of its teeth shows it to be closely allied to\r\nthe ruminants, while several other details link it to the pachyderms,\r\nand its aquatic peculiarities of ear and nostril approximate it rather\r\nto the manatee and the dugong. 'How wonderfully,' he says, 'are the\r\ndifferent orders, at the present time so well separated, blended\r\ntogether in different points of the structure of the toxodon.' We now\r\nknow that unspecialised ancestral forms always display this close union\r\nof peculiarities afterwards separately developed in distinct species of\r\ntheir later descendants.\r\n\r\nStill more pregnant with evolutionism in the bud is the prophetic remark\r\nabout a certain singular group of South American birds, 'This small\r\nfamily is one of those which, from its varied relations to other\r\nfamilies, although at present offering only difficulties to the\r\nsystematic naturalist, ultimately may assist in revealing the grand\r\nscheme, common to the present and past ages, on which organised beings\r\nhave been created.' Of the agouti, once more, that true friend of the\r\ndesert, Darwin notes that it does not now range as far south as Port St.\r\nJulian, though Wood in 1670 found it abundant there; and he asks\r\nsuggestively, 'What cause can have altered, in a wide, uninhabited, and\r\nrarely visited country, the range of an animal like this?' Again, when\r\nspeaking of the analogies between the extinct camel-like macrauchenia\r\nand the modern guanaco, as well as of those between the fossil and\r\nliving species of South American rodents, he says, with even more\r\nprophetic insight, 'This wonderful relationship in the same continent\r\nbetween the dead and the living will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw\r\nmore light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their\r\ndisappearance from it, than any other class of facts.' He was himself\r\ndestined in another thirty years to prove the truth of his own\r\nvaticination.\r\n\r\nA yet more remarkable passage in the 'Journal of the \"Beagle,\"' though\r\nentered under the account of events observed in the year 1834, must\r\nalmost certainly have been written somewhat later, and subsequently to\r\nDarwin's first reading of Malthus's momentous work, 'The Principle of\r\nPopulation,' which (as we know from his own pen) formed a cardinal point\r\nin the great biologist's mental development. It runs as follows in the\r\npublished journal:[1]--'We do not steadily bear in mind how profoundly\r\nignorant we are of the conditions of existence of every animal; nor do\r\nwe always remember that some check is constantly preventing the too\r\nrapid increase of every organised being left in a state of nature. The\r\nsupply of food, on an average, remains constant; yet the tendency in\r\nevery animal to increase by propagation is geometrical, and its\r\nsurprising effects have nowhere been more astonishingly shown than in\r\nthe case of the European animals run wild during the last few centuries\r\nin America. Every animal in a state of nature regularly breeds; yet in a\r\nspecies long established any great increase in numbers is obviously\r\nimpossible, and must be checked by some means.' Aut Malthus aut\r\nDiabolus. And surely here, if anywhere at all, we tremble on the very\r\nverge of natural selection.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to follow young Darwin in detail through his\r\njourney to Buenos Ayres, and up the Parana to Santa Fé, which occupied\r\nthe autumn of 1833. In the succeeding year he visited Patagonia and the\r\nFalkland Islands, having previously made his first acquaintance with\r\nsavage life among the naked Fuegians of the extreme southern point of\r\nthe continent. Some of these interesting natives, taken to England by\r\nCaptain Fitzroy on a former visit, had accompanied the 'Beagle' through\r\nall her wanderings, and from them Darwin obtained that close insight\r\ninto the workings of savage human nature which he afterwards utilised\r\nwith such conspicuous ability in the 'Descent of Man.' Through\r\nMagellan's Straits the party made their way up the coasts of Chili, and\r\nDarwin had there an opportunity of investigating the geology and biology\r\nof the Cordillera. The year 1835 was chiefly spent in that temperate\r\ncountry and in tropical Peru; and as the autumn went on, the 'Beagle'\r\nmade her way across a belt of the Pacific to the Galapagos archipelago.\r\n\r\nSmall and unimportant as are those little equatorial islands from the\r\ngeographical and commercial point of view, they will yet remain for ever\r\nclassic ground to the biologists of the future from their close\r\nconnection with the master-problems of the 'Origin of Species.' Here\r\nmore, perhaps, than anywhere else the naturalist of the 'Beagle' found\r\nhimself face to face in real earnest with the ultimate questions of\r\ncreation or evolution. A group of tiny volcanic islets, never joined to\r\nany land, nor even united to one another, yet each possessing its own\r\nspecial zoological features--the Galapagos roused to an extraordinary\r\ndegree the irresistible questionings of Darwin's mind. They contain no\r\nfrogs, and no mammal save a mouse, brought to them, no doubt, by some\r\npassing ship. The only insects are beetles, which possess peculiar\r\nfacilities for being transported in the egg or grub across salt water\r\nupon floating logs. There are two kinds of snake, one tortoise, and four\r\nlizards; but, in striking contrast to this extreme poverty of\r\nterrestrial forms, there are at least fifty-five distinct species of\r\nnative birds. A few snails complete the list. Now most of these animals,\r\nthough closely resembling the fauna of Ecuador, the nearest mainland,\r\nare specifically distinct; they have varied (as we now know) from their\r\ncontinental types owing to natural selection under the new circumstances\r\nin which they have been placed. But Darwin had not yet evolved that\r\npotent key to the great riddle of organic existence. He saw the problem,\r\nbut not its solution. 'Most of the organic productions,' he says\r\nplainly, 'are aboriginal creations, found nowhere else; there is even a\r\ndifference between the inhabitants of the different islands: yet all\r\nshow a marked relationship with those of America, though separated from\r\nthat continent by an open space of ocean, between 500 and 600 miles in\r\nwidth.... Considering the small size of these islands, we feel the more\r\nastonished at the number of their aboriginal beings, and at their\r\nconfined range. Seeing every height crowned with its crater, and the\r\nboundaries of most of the lava-streams still distinct, we are led to\r\nbelieve that within a period geologically recent the unbroken sea was\r\nhere spread out. Hence, both in space and time we seem to be brought\r\nsomewhat nearer to that great fact--that mystery of mysteries--the first\r\nappearance of new beings on this earth.' Among the most singular of\r\nthese zoological facts may be mentioned the existence in the Galapagos\r\narchipelago of a genus of gigantic and ugly lizard, the amblyrhyncus,\r\nunknown elsewhere, but here assuming the forms of two species, the one\r\nmarine and the other terrestrial. In minuter points, the differences of\r\nfauna and flora between the various islands are simply astounding, so as\r\nto compel the idea that each form must necessarily have been developed\r\nnot merely for the group, but for the special island which it actually\r\ninhabits. No wonder that Darwin should say in conclusion, 'One is\r\nastonished at the amount of creative force, if such an expression may be\r\nused, displayed on these small, barren, and rocky islands; and still\r\nmore so at its diverse, yet analogous, action on points so near each\r\nother.' Here again, in real earnest, the young observer trembles visibly\r\non the very verge of natural selection. In the 'Origin of Species' he\r\nmakes full use, more than once, of the remarkable facts he observed with\r\nso much interest in these tiny isolated oceanic specks of the American\r\ngalaxy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Galapagos the 'Beagle' steered a straight course for Tahiti,\r\nand Darwin then beheld with his own eyes the exquisite beauty of the\r\nPolynesian Islands. Thence they sailed for New Zealand, the most truly\r\ninsular large mass of land in the whole world, supplied accordingly with\r\na fauna and flora of most surprising meagreness and poverty of species.\r\nIn the woods, our observer noted very few birds, and he remarks with\r\nastonishment that so big an island--as large as Great Britain--should\r\nnot possess a single living indigenous mammal, save a solitary rat of\r\ndoubtful origin. Australia and Tasmania, with their antiquated and\r\nstranded marsupial inhabitants, almost completed the round trip. Keeling\r\nIsland next afforded a basis for the future famous observations upon\r\ncoral reefs; and thence by Mauritius, St. Helena, Ascension, Bahia,\r\nPernambuco, and the beautiful Azores, the 'Beagle' made her way home by\r\nslow stages to England, which she reached in safety on October the 2nd,\r\n1836. What an ideal education for the future reconstructor of\r\nbiological science! He had now all his problems cut and dried, ready to\r\nhis hand, and he had nothing important left to do--except to sit down\r\nquietly in his study, and proceed to solve them. Observation and\r\ncollection had given him one half the subject-matter of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies;' reflection and Malthus were to give him the other half. Never\r\nhad great mind a nobler chance; never, again, had noble chance a great\r\nmind better adapted by nature and heredity to make the most of it. The\r\nman was not wanting to the opportunity, nor was the opportunity wanting\r\nto the man. Organism and environment fell together into perfect harmony;\r\nand so, by a lucky combination of circumstances, the secret of the ages\r\nwas finally wrung from not unwilling nature by the far-seeing and\r\nindustrious volunteer naturalist of the 'Beagle' expedition.\r\n\r\nIt would be giving a very false idea of the interests which stirred\r\nCharles Darwin's mind during his long five years' voyage, however, if we\r\nwere to dwell exclusively upon the biological side of his numerous\r\nobservations on that memorable cruise. Ethnology, geology, oceanic\r\nphenomena, the height of the snow-line, the climate of the Antarctic\r\nislands, the formation of icebergs, the transport of boulders, the\r\nhabits and manners engendered by slavery, all almost equally aroused in\r\ntheir own way the young naturalist's vivid interest. Nowhere do we get\r\nthe faintest trace of narrow specialism; nowhere are we cramped within\r\nthe restricted horizon of the mere vulgar beetle-hunter and\r\nbutterfly-catcher. The biologist of the 'Beagle' had taken the whole\r\nworld of science for his special province. Darwin's mind with all its\r\nvastness was not, indeed, profoundly analytical. The task of working out\r\nthe psychological and metaphysical aspects of evolution fell rather to\r\nthe great organising and systematising intellect of Herbert Spencer. But\r\nwithin the realm of material fact, and of the widest possible inferences\r\nbased upon such fact, Darwin's keen and comprehensive spirit ranged\r\nfreely over the whole illimitable field of nature. 'No one,' says Buckle\r\nwith unwonted felicity, 'can have a firm grasp of any science if, by\r\nconfining himself to it, he shuts out the light of analogy. He may, no\r\ndoubt, work at the details of his subject; he may be useful in adding to\r\nits facts; he will never be able to enlarge its philosophy. For the\r\nphilosophy of every department depends on its connection with other\r\ndepartments, and must therefore be sought at their points of contact. It\r\nmust be looked for in the place where they touch and coalesce: it lies,\r\nnot in the centre of each science, but on the confines and margin.' This\r\nprofound truth Darwin fully and instinctively realised. It was the\r\nall-embracing catholicity of his manifold interests that raised him into\r\nthe greatest pure biologist of all time, and that enabled him to\r\nco-ordinate with such splendid results the raw data of so many distinct\r\nand separate sciences. And even as early as the days of the cruise in\r\nthe 'Beagle,' that innate catholicity had already asserted itself in\r\nfull vigour. Now it is a party of Gauchos throwing the bola that engages\r\nfor the moment his eager attention; and now again it is a group of\r\nshivering Fuegians, standing naked with their long hair streaming in the\r\nwind on a snowy promontory of their barren coast. Here he examines the\r\ntubular lightning-holes melted in the solid rock of Maldonado by the\r\nelectric energy; and there he observes the moving boulder-streams that\r\ncourse like torrents down the rugged corries of the Falkland Islands. At\r\none time he works upon the unstudied geology of the South American\r\nPampas; at another, he inspects the now classical lagoon and narrow\r\nfringing reef of the Keeling archipelago. Everywhere he sees whatever of\r\nmost noteworthy in animate or inanimate nature is there to be seen; and\r\neverywhere he draws from it innumerable lessons, to be applied hereafter\r\nto the special field of study upon which his intense and active energies\r\nwere finally concentrated. It is not too much to say, indeed, that it\r\nwas the voyage of the 'Beagle' which gave us in the last resort the\r\n'Origin of Species' and its great fellow the 'Descent of Man.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The full narrative was first given to the world in 1839, some three\r\nyears after Darwin's return to England, so that much of it evidently\r\nrepresents the results of his maturer thinking and reading on the facts\r\ncollected during his journey round the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF INCUBATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Darwin landed in England on his return from the voyage of\r\nthe 'Beagle' he was nearly twenty-eight. When he published the first\r\nedition of the 'Origin of Species' he was over fifty. The intermediate\r\nyears, though much occupied by many minor works of deep specialist\r\nscientific importance, were still mainly devoted to collecting material\r\nfor the one crowning effort of his life, the chief monument of his great\r\nco-ordinating and commanding intellect--the settlement of the question\r\nof organic evolution.\r\n\r\n'There is one thing,' says Professor Fiske, 'which a man of original\r\nscientific or philosophical genius in a rightly ordered world should\r\nnever be called upon to do. He should never be called upon to earn a\r\nliving; for that is a wretched waste of energy, in which the highest\r\nintellectual power is sure to suffer serious detriment, and runs the\r\nrisk of being frittered away into hopeless ruin.' From this unhappy\r\nnecessity Charles Darwin, like his predecessor Lyell, was luckily free.\r\nHe settled down early in a home of his own, and worked away at his own\r\noccupations, with no sordid need for earning the day's bread, but with\r\nperfect leisure to carry out the great destiny for which the chances of\r\nthe universe had singled him out. His subsequent history is the history\r\nof his wonderful and unique contributions to natural science.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done, of course, was the arrangement and\r\nclassification of the natural history spoils gathered during the cruise,\r\nand the preparation of his own journal of the voyage for publication.\r\nThe strict scientific results of the trip were described in the 'Zoology\r\nof the Voyage of the \"Beagle,\"' the different parts of which were\r\nundertaken by rising men of science of the highest distinction, under\r\nCharles Darwin's own editorship. Sir Richard Owen took in hand the\r\nfossil mammals; Waterhouse arranged their living allies; Gould discussed\r\nthe birds, Jenyns the fish, and Bell the amphibians and reptiles. In\r\nthis vast co-operative publication Darwin thus obtained the assistance\r\nof many among the most competent specialists in the England of his day,\r\nand learned to understand his own collections by the light thrown upon\r\nthem from the focussed lamps of the most minute technical learning. As\r\nfor the journal, it was originally published with the general account of\r\nthe cruise by Captain Fitzroy in 1839, but was afterwards set forth in a\r\nseparate form under the title of 'A Naturalist's Voyage Round the\r\nWorld.'\r\n\r\nBut while Darwin was thus engaged in arranging and classifying the\r\nanimals and plants he had brought home with him, the germs of those\r\ninquiring ideas about the origin of species which we have already\r\nobserved in his account of the voyage were quickening into fresh life\r\nwithin him. As he ruminated at his leisure over the results of his\r\naccumulations, he was beginning to work upon the great problem with the\r\ndefinite and conscious resolution of solving it. 'On my return home, it\r\noccurred to me,' he says, 'in 1837, that something might perhaps be made\r\nout on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all\r\nsorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five\r\nyears' work, I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up\r\nsome short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the\r\nconclusions that then seemed to me probable; from that period to the\r\npresent day [1859] I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that\r\nI may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them\r\nto show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.'\r\n\r\nSo Darwin wrote at fifty. The words are weighty and well worthy of\r\nconsideration. They give us in a nutshell the true secret of Darwin's\r\nsuccess in compelling the attention and assent of his contemporaries to\r\nhis completed theory. For speculations and hypotheses like those of\r\nLamarck and Erasmus Darwin, however brilliant and luminous they may be,\r\nthe hard, dry, scientific mind cares as a rule less than nothing. Men of\r\ngenius and insight like Goethe and Oken may, indeed, seize greedily upon\r\nthe pregnant suggestion; their intellects are already attuned by nature\r\nto its due reception and assimilation; but the mere butterfly-catchers\r\nand plant-hunters of the world, with whom after all rests ultimately the\r\npractical acceptance or rejection of such a theory, can only be\r\nconvinced by long and patient accumulations of facts, by infinite\r\ninstances and endless examples, by exhaustive surveys of the whole\r\nfield of nature in a thousand petty details piecemeal. They have to be\r\ndriven by repeated beating into the right path. Everywhere they fancy\r\nthey see the loophole of an objection, which must be carefully closed\r\nbeforehand against them with anticipatory argument, as we close hedges\r\nby the wayside against the obtrusive donkey with a cautious bunch of\r\nthorny brambles. Even if Charles Darwin had hit upon the fundamental\r\nidea of natural selection, and had published it, as Wallace did, in the\r\nform of a mere splendid _aperçu_, he would never have revolutionised the\r\nworld of biology. When the great discovery was actually promulgated, it\r\nwas easy enough to win the assent of philosophical thinkers like Herbert\r\nSpencer; easy enough, even, to gain the ready adhesion of non-biological\r\nbut kindred minds, like Leslie Stephen's and John Morley's; those might\r\nall, perhaps, have been readily convinced by far less heavy and crushing\r\nartillery than that so triumphantly marshalled together in the 'Origin\r\nof Species.' But in order to command the slow and grudging adhesion of\r\nthe rank and file of scientific workers, the 'hodmen of science,' as\r\nProfessor Huxley calls them, it was needful to bring together an\r\nimposing array of closely serried facts, to secure every post in the\r\nrear before taking a single step onward, and to bring to bear upon every\r\nantagonist the exact form of argument with which he was already\r\nthoroughly familiar. It was by carefully pursuing these safe and\r\ncautious philosophical tactics that Charles Darwin gained his great\r\nvictory. Where others were pregnant, he was cogent. He met the\r\nDryasdusts of science on their own ground, and he put them fairly to\r\nflight with their own weapons. More than that, he brought them all over\r\nin the long run as deserters into his own camp, and converted them from\r\ndoubtful and suspicious foes into warm adherents of the evolutionary\r\nbanner.\r\n\r\nMoreover, fortunately for the world, Darwin's own mind was essentially\r\none of the inductive type. If a great deductive thinker and speculator\r\nlike Herbert Spencer had hit upon the self-same idea of survival of the\r\nfittest, he might have communicated it to a small following of receptive\r\ndisciples, who would have understood it and accepted it, on _a priori_\r\ngrounds alone, and gradually passed it on to the grades beneath them;\r\nbut he would never have touched the slow and cautious elephantine\r\nintellect of the masses. The common run of mankind are not deductive;\r\nthey require to have everything made quite clear to them by example and\r\ninstance. The English intelligence in particular shows itself as a rule\r\ncongenitally incapable of appreciating the superior logical certitude of\r\nthe deductive method. Englishmen will not even believe that the square\r\non the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the containing sides until\r\nthey have measured and weighed as well as they are able by rude\r\nexperimental devices a few selected pieces of rudely shaped rectangular\r\npaper. It was a great gain, therefore, that the task of reconstructing\r\nthe course of organic evolution should fall to the lot of a highly\r\ntrained and masterly intelligence of the inductive order. Darwin had\r\nfirst to convince himself, and then he could proceed to convince the\r\nworld. He set about the task with characteristic patience and\r\nthoroughness. No man that ever lived possessed in a more remarkable\r\ndegree than he did the innate capacity for taking trouble. For five\r\nyears, as a mere preliminary, he accumulated facts in immense variety,\r\nand then for the first time and in the vaguest possible way he--'allowed\r\nhimself to speculate.' That brings us down to the year 1842, when the\r\nfirst notes of the 'Origin of Species' must have been tentatively\r\ncommitted to paper. It was in 1859 that the first edition of the\r\ncomplete work was given to the world. Compare this with the case of\r\nNewton, who similarly kept his grand idea of gravitation for many years\r\nin embryo, until more exact measurements of the moon's mass and distance\r\nshould enable him to verify it to his own satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOne other item of immense importance in the genesis of the full\r\nDarwinian doctrine deserves mention here--I mean, the exact moment of\r\ntime occupied by Charles Darwin in the continuous history of scientific\r\nthought. A generation or two earlier, in Erasmus Darwin's days, biology\r\nhad not yet arrived at the true classification of animals and plants\r\nupon an essentially hereditary basis. The Linnæan arrangement, then\r\nuniversally accepted, was wholly artificial in its main features; it\r\ndistributed species without regard to their fundamental likenesses of\r\nstructure and organisation. But the natural system of Jussieu and De\r\nCandolle, by arranging plants into truly related groups, made possible\r\nthe proofs of an order of affiliation in the vegetable kingdom; while\r\nCuvier's similar reconstruction of the animal world gave a like foothold\r\nto the evolutionary philosopher in the other great department of organic\r\nnature. The recognition of kinship between the various members of the\r\nsame family necessarily preceded the establishment of a regular\r\ngenealogical theory of life in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThough we are here concerned mainly with Charles Darwin the thinker and\r\nwriter--not with Charles Darwin the husband and father--a few words of\r\nexplanation as to his private life must necessarily be added at the\r\npresent point, before we pass on to consider the long, slow, and\r\ncautious brewing of that wonderful work, the 'Origin of Species,' Darwin\r\nreturned home from the voyage of the 'Beagle' at the end of the year\r\n1836. Soon after, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, no doubt\r\nthrough the influence of his friend Lyell, who was quite enthusiastic\r\nover his splendid geological investigations on the rate of elevation in\r\nthe Pampas and the Cordillera. Acting on Lyell's advice, too, he\r\ndetermined to seek no official appointment, but to devote himself\r\nentirely for the rest of his life to the pursuit of science. In 1838, at\r\nthe age of twenty-nine, he read before the Geological Society his paper\r\non the 'Connection of Volcanic Phenomena with the Elevation of Mountain\r\nChains,' when, says Lyell admiringly in a private letter, 'he opened\r\nupon De la Beche, Phillips, and others'--the veterans of the\r\nscience--'his whole battery of the earthquakes and volcanoes of the\r\nAndes.' Shortly after, the audacious young man was appointed secretary\r\nto the Geological Society, a post which he filled when the voyage of the\r\n'Beagle' was first published in 1839.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of that same year, the rising naturalist took to\r\nhimself a wife from one of the houses to which he himself owed no small\r\npart of his conspicuous greatness. His choice fell upon his cousin,\r\nMiss Emma Wedgwood, daughter of Josiah Wedgwood, of Maer Hall; and,\r\nafter three years of married life in London, he settled at last at Down\r\nHouse, near Orpington, in Kent, where for the rest of his days he passed\r\nhis time among his conservatories and his pigeons, his garden and his\r\nfowls, with his children growing up quietly beside him, and the great\r\nthinking world of London within easy reach of a few minutes' journey.\r\nHis private means enabled him to live the pleasant life of an English\r\ncountry gentleman, and devote himself unremittingly to the pursuit of\r\nscience. Ill health, indeed, interfered sadly with his powers of work;\r\nbut system and patience did wonders during his working days, which were\r\nregularly parcelled out between study and recreation, and utilised and\r\neconomised in the very highest possible degree. Early to bed and early\r\nto rise, wandering unseen among the lanes and paths, or riding slowly on\r\nhis favourite black cob, the great naturalist passed forty years happily\r\nand usefully at Down, where all the village knew and loved him. A man of\r\nsingular simplicity and largeness of heart, Charles Darwin never really\r\nlearnt to know his own greatness. And that charming innocence and\r\nignorance of his real value made the value itself all the greater. His\r\nmoral qualities, indeed, were no less admirable and unique in their way\r\nthan his intellectual faculties. To that charming candour and delightful\r\nunostentatiousness which everybody must have noticed in his published\r\nwritings, he united in private life a kindliness of disposition, a width\r\nof sympathy, and a ready generosity which made him as much beloved by\r\nhis friends as he was admired and respected by all Europe. The very\r\nservants who came beneath his roof stopped there for the most part\r\nduring their whole lifetime. In his earlier years at Down, the quiet\r\nKentish home was constantly enlivened by the visits of men like Lyell,\r\nHuxley, Hooker, Lubbock, and Wollaston. During his later days, it was\r\nthe Mecca of a world-wide scientific and philosophic pilgrimage, where\r\nall the greatest men our age has produced sought at times the rare\r\nhonour of sitting before the face of the immortal master. But to the\r\nvery last Darwin himself never seemed to discover that he was anything\r\nmore than just an average man of science among his natural peers.\r\n\r\nShortly after Darwin went to Down he began one long and memorable\r\nexperiment, which in itself casts a flood of light upon his patient and\r\npainstaking method of inquiry. Two years before, he had read at the\r\nGeological Society a paper on the 'Formation of Mould,' which more than\r\nthirty years later he expanded into his famous treatise on the 'Action\r\nof Earthworms.' His uncle and father-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood, suggested\r\nto him that the apparent sinking of stones on the surface might really\r\nbe due to earthworm castings. So, as soon as he had some land of his own\r\nto experiment upon, he began, in 1842, to spread broken chalk over a\r\nfield at Down, in which, twenty-nine years later, in 1871, a trench was\r\ndug to test the results. What other naturalist ever waited so long and\r\nso patiently to discover the upshot of a single experiment? Is it\r\nwonderful that a man who worked like that should succeed, not by faith\r\nbut by logical power, in removing mountains?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we do not know the exact date when Darwin first read\r\nMalthus. But that the perusal of that remarkable book formed a crisis\r\nand turning-point in his mental development we know from his own\r\ndistinct statement in a letter to Haeckel, prefixed to the brilliant\r\nGerman evolutionist's 'History of Creation.' 'It seemed to me probable,'\r\nsays Darwin, speaking of his own early development, 'that allied species\r\nwere descended from a common ancestor. But during several years I could\r\nnot conceive how each form could have been modified so as to become\r\nadmirably adapted to its place in nature. I began therefore to study\r\ndomesticated animals and cultivated plants, and after a time perceived\r\nthat man's power of selecting and breeding from certain individuals was\r\nthe most powerful of all means in the production of new races. Having\r\nattended to the habits of animals and their relations to the surrounding\r\nconditions, I was able to realise the severe struggle for existence to\r\nwhich all organisms are subjected; and my geological observations had\r\nallowed me to appreciate to a certain extent the duration of past\r\ngeological periods. With my mind thus prepared I fortunately happened to\r\nread Malthus's \"Essay on Population\" and the idea of natural selection\r\nthrough the struggle for existence at once occurred to me. Of all the\r\nsubordinate points in the theory, the last which I understood was the\r\ncause of the tendency in the descendants from a common progenitor to\r\ndiverge in character.'\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, indeed, to overrate the importance of Malthus, viewed\r\nas a schoolmaster to bring men to Darwin, and to bring Darwin himself to\r\nthe truth. Without the 'Essay on the Principle of Population' it is\r\nquite conceivable that we should never have had the 'Origin of Species'\r\nor the 'Descent of Man.'\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Darwin had not been idle in other departments of\r\nscientific work. Side by side with his collections for his final effort\r\nhe had been busy on his valuable treatise upon Coral Reefs, in which he\r\nproved, mainly from his own observations on the Keeling archipelago,\r\nthat atolls owe their origin to a subsidence of the supporting\r\nocean-floor, the rate of upward growth of the reefs keeping pace on the\r\nwhole with the gradual depression of the sea-bottom. 'No more admirable\r\nexample of scientific method,' says Professor Geikie forty years later,\r\n'was ever given to the world; and even if he had written nothing else,\r\nthis treatise alone would have placed Darwin in the very front of\r\ninvestigators of nature.' But, from our present psychological and\r\nhistorical point of view, as a moment in the development of Darwin's\r\ninfluence, and therefore of the evolutionary impulse in general, it\r\npossesses a still greater and more profound importance, because the work\r\nin which the theory is unfolded forms a perfect masterpiece of thorough\r\nand comprehensive inductive method, and gained for its author a\r\nwell-deserved reputation as a sound and sober scientific inquirer. The\r\nacquisition of such a reputation, afterwards increased by the\r\npublication of the monograph on the Family Cirripedia (in 1851), proved\r\nof immense use to Charles Darwin in the fierce battle which was to rage\r\naround the unconscious body of the 'Origin of Species.' To be 'sound' is\r\neverywhere of incalculable value; to have approved oneself to the slow\r\nand cautious intelligence of the Philistine classes is a mighty spear\r\nand shield for a strong man; but in England, and above all in scientific\r\nEngland, it is absolutely indispensable to the thinker who would\r\naccomplish any great revolution. Soundness is to the world of science\r\nwhat respectability is to the world of business--the _sine qua non_ for\r\nsuccessfully gaining even a hearing from established personages.\r\n\r\nTo read the book on Coral Reefs is indeed to take a lesson of the\r\ndeepest value in applied inductive canons. Every fact is duly\r\nmarshalled: every conclusion is drawn by the truest and most legitimate\r\nprocess from careful observation or crucial experiment. Bit by bit,\r\nDarwin shows most admirably that, through gradual submergence, fringing\r\nreefs are developed into barrier-reefs, and these again into atolls or\r\nlagoon islands; and incidentally he throws a vivid light on the slow\r\nsecular movements upward or downward for ever taking place in the\r\nworld's crust. But the value of the work as a geological record, great\r\nas it is, is as nothing compared with its value as a training exercise\r\nin inductive logic. Darwin was now learning by experience how to use his\r\nown immense powers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the environment too had been gradually moving. In 1832, the\r\nyear after young Darwin set out upon his cruise, Lyell published the\r\nfirst edition of his 'Principles of Geology,' establishing once for all\r\nthe uniformitarian concept of that branch of science. In 1836, the year\r\nwhen he returned, Rafinesque, in his 'New Flora of North America,' had\r\naccepted within certain cramping limits the idea that 'all species might\r\nonce have been varieties, and that many varieties are gradually becoming\r\nspecies by assuming constant and peculiar characters.' Haldeman in\r\nBoston, and Grant at University College, London, were teaching from\r\ntheir professorial chairs the self-same novel and revolutionary\r\ndoctrine. At last, in 1844, Robert Chambers published anonymously his\r\nfamous and much-debated 'Vestiges of Creation,' which brought down the\r\nquestion of evolution _versus_ creation from the senate of _savants_ to\r\nthe arena of the mere general public, and set up at once a universal\r\nfever of inquiry into the mysterious question of the origin of species.\r\nChambers himself was a man rather of general knowledge and some native\r\nphilosophical insight than of any marked scientific accuracy or depth.\r\nHis work in its original form displayed comparatively little\r\nacquaintance with the vast ground-work of the question at\r\nissue--zoological, botanical, geological, and so forth--and in Charles\r\nDarwin's own opinion showed 'a great want of scientific caution.' But\r\nits graphic style, its vivid picturesqueness, and to the world at large\r\nthe startling novelty of its brilliant and piquant suggestions, made it\r\nburst at once into an unwonted popularity for a work of so distinctly\r\nphilosophical a character. In nine years it leaped rapidly through no\r\nless than ten successive editions, and remained until the publication of\r\nthe 'Origin of Species' the chief authoritative exponent in England of\r\nthe still struggling evolutionary principle.\r\n\r\nThe 'Vestiges of Creation' may be succinctly described as Lamarck and\r\nwater, the watery element being due in part to the unnecessary obtrusion\r\n(_more Scotico_) of a metaphysical and theological principle into the\r\nphysical universe. Chambers himself, in his latest edition (before the\r\nbook was finally killed by the advent of Darwinism), thus briefly\r\ndescribes his main concepts: 'The several series of animated beings,\r\nfrom the simplest and oldest up to the highest and most recent, are,\r\nunder the providence of God, the results, _first_, of an impulse which\r\nhas been imparted to the forms of life, advancing them, in definite\r\ntimes, by generation, through grades of organisation, terminating in the\r\nhighest dicotyledons and vertebrata, these grades being few in number,\r\nand generally marked by intervals of organic character, which we find to\r\nbe a practical difficulty in ascertaining affinities; _second_, of\r\nanother impulse connected with the vital forces, tending, in the course\r\nof generations, to modify organic structures in accordance with external\r\ncircumstances, as food, the nature of the habitat, and the meteoric\r\nagencies.' Now it is clear at once that these two supposed 'impulses'\r\nare really quite miraculous in their essence. They do not help us at all\r\nto a distinct physical and realisable conception of any natural agency\r\nwhereby species became differentiated one from the other. They lay the\r\nwhole burden of species-making upon a single primordial supernatural\r\nimpetus, imparted to the first living germ by the will of the Creator,\r\nand acting ever since continuously it is true, but none the less\r\nmiraculously for all that. For many creations Chambers substitutes one\r\nsingle long creative nisus: where Darwin saw natural selection, his\r\nScotch predecessor saw a _deus ex machina_, helping on the course of\r\norganic development by a constant but unseen interference from above. He\r\nsupposed evolution to be predetermined by some intrinsic and externally\r\nimplanted proclivity. In short, Chambers's theory is Lamarck's\r\ntheologised, and spoilt in the process.\r\n\r\nThe book had nevertheless a most prodigious and perfectly unprecedented\r\nsuccess. The secret of its authorship was keenly debated and jealously\r\nkept. The most ridiculous surmises as to its anonymous origin were\r\neverywhere afloat. Some attributed it to Thackeray, and some to Prince\r\nAlbert, some to Lyell, some to Sir John Herschel, and some to Charles\r\nDarwin himself. Obscurantists thought it a wicked book; 'intellectual'\r\npeople thought it an advanced book. As a matter of fact it was neither\r\nthe one nor the other. It was just a pale and colourless transcript of\r\nthe old familiar teleological Lamarckism. Yet it did good in its\r\ngeneration. The public at large were induced by its ephemeral vogue to\r\ninterest themselves in a question to which they had never previously\r\ngiven even a passing thought, though more practised biologists of\r\nevolutionary tendencies were grieved at heart that evolution should\r\nfirst have been popularly presented to the English world under so\r\nunscientific, garbled, and mutilated a form. From the philosophic side,\r\nHerbert Spencer found 'this ascription of organic evolution to some\r\naptitude naturally possessed by organisms or miraculously imposed upon\r\nthem' to be 'one of those explanations which explain nothing--a shaping\r\nof ignorance into the semblance of knowledge. The cause assigned,' he\r\nsays, 'is not a true cause--not a cause assimilable to known causes--not\r\na cause that can be anywhere shown to produce analogous effects. It is a\r\ncause unrepresentable in thought: one of those illegitimate symbolic\r\nconceptions which cannot by any mental process be elaborated into a real\r\nconception.' From the scientific side, on the other hand, Darwin felt\r\nsadly the inaccuracy and want of profound technical knowledge everywhere\r\ndisplayed by the anonymous author. These things might naturally cause\r\nthe enemy to blaspheme. No worse calamity, indeed, can happen to a\r\ngreat truth than for its defence to be intrusted to inefficient hands.\r\nNevertheless, long after, in the 'Origin of Species,' the great\r\nnaturalist wrote with generous appreciation of the 'Vestiges of\r\nCreation,' 'In my own opinion it has done excellent service in this\r\ncountry in calling attention to the subject, in removing prejudice, and\r\nin thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous views.'\r\n\r\nStill Darwin gave no sign. A flaccid, cartilaginous, unphilosophic\r\nevolutionism had full possession of the field for the moment, and\r\nclaimed, as it were, to be the genuine representative of the young and\r\nvigorous biological creed, while he himself was in truth the real heir\r\nto all the honours of the situation. He was in possession of the\r\nmaster-key which alone could unlock the bars that opposed the progress\r\nof evolution, and still he waited. He could afford to wait. He was\r\ndiligently collecting, amassing, investigating; eagerly reading every\r\nnew systematic work, every book of travels, every scientific journal,\r\nevery record of sport, or exploration, or discovery, to extract from the\r\ndead mass of undigested fact whatever item of implicit value might swell\r\nthe definite co-ordinated series of notes in his own commonplace books\r\nfor the now distinctly contemplated 'Origin of Species.' His way was to\r\nmake all sure behind him, to summon up all his facts in irresistible\r\narray, and never to set out upon a public progress until he was secure\r\nagainst all possible attacks of the ever-watchful and alert enemy in the\r\nrear. Few men would have had strength of mind enough to resist the\r\ntemptation offered by the publication of the 'Vestiges of Creation,' and\r\nthe extraordinary success attained by so flabby a presentation of the\r\nevolutionary case: Darwin resisted it, and he did wisely.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, take it for granted, I doubt not, that it was the\r\nappearance and success of Chambers's invertebrate book which induced\r\nDarwin, in 1844 (the year of its publication), to enlarge his short\r\nnotes 'into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed to him\r\nprobable.' This sketch he showed to Dr. (now Sir Joseph) Hooker, no\r\ndoubt as a precaution to ensure his own claim of priority against any\r\nfuture possible competitor. And having thus eased his mind for the\r\nmoment, he continued to observe, to read, to devour 'Transactions,' to\r\ncollate instances, with indefatigable persistence for fifteen years\r\nlonger. If any man mentally measures out fifteen years of his own life,\r\nand bethinks him of how long a space it seems when thus deliberately\r\npictured, he will be able to realise a little more definitely--but only\r\na little--how profound was the patience, the self-denial, the\r\nsingle-mindedness of Darwin's intense search after the ultimate truths\r\nof natural science.\r\n\r\nWhat was the sketch that he thus committed to paper in 1844, and\r\nsubmitted to the judgment of his friend Hooker? It was the germ of the\r\ntheory of natural selection. According to that theory, organic\r\ndevelopment is due to the survival of the fittest among innumerable\r\nvariations, good, bad, and indifferent, from one or more parent stocks.\r\nDarwin's reading of Malthus had suggested to him (apparently as early as\r\nthe date of publication of the 'Naturalist's Journal') the idea that\r\nevery species of plant and animal must always be producing a far greater\r\nnumber of seeds, eggs, germs, or young offspring than could possibly be\r\nneeded for the maintenance of the average number of the species. Of\r\nthese young, by far the greater number must always perish from\r\ngeneration to generation, for want of space, of food, of air, of raw\r\nmaterial. The survivors in each brood must be those naturally best\r\nadapted for survival. The many would be eaten, starved, overrun, or\r\ncrowded out; the few that survive would be those that possessed any\r\nspecial means of defence against aggressors, any special advantage for\r\nescaping starvation, any special protection against overrunning or\r\novercrowding foes. Animals and plants, Darwin found on inquiry and\r\ninvestigation, tended to vary under diverse circumstances from the\r\nparent or parents that originally produced them. These variations were\r\nusually infinitesimal in amount, but sometimes more considerable or even\r\nstriking. If any particular variation tended in any way to preserve the\r\nlife of the creatures that exhibited it, beyond the average of their\r\nlike competitors, that variation would in the long run survive, and the\r\nindividuals that possessed it, being thus favoured in the struggle for\r\nexistence, would replace the less adapted form from which they sprang.\r\nDarwinism is Malthusianism on the large scale: it is the application of\r\nthe calculus of population to the wide facts of universal life.\r\n\r\nIn one sense, indeed, it may be said that, given Malthus on the one hand\r\nand the Lamarckian evolutionism on the other, some great man somewhere\r\nmust sooner or later, almost of necessity, have combined the two, and\r\nhit out the doctrine of natural selection as we actually know it. Quite\r\nso; but then the point is just this: Darwin _was_ the great man in\r\nquestion; he _did_ the work which in the very essence of things some\r\nsuch great man was naturally and inevitably predestined to do. You can\r\nalways easily manage to get on without any particular great man,\r\nprovided, of course, you have ready to hand another equally able great\r\nman by whom to replace him in the scheme of existence. But how many\r\nordinary naturalists possess the width of mind and universality of\r\ninterest which would prompt them to read, mark, learn, and inwardly\r\ndigest a politico-economical treatise of the calibre of Malthus? How\r\nmany, having done so, have the keenness of vision to perceive the\r\nensuing biological implications? How many, having seen them, have the\r\nskill and the patience to work up the infinite chaos of botanical and\r\nzoological detail into the far-reaching generalisations of the 'Origin\r\nof Species'? Merely to have caught at the grand idea is in itself no\r\nsmall achievement; others did so and deserve all honour for their\r\ninsight; but to flesh it out with all the minute care and conclusive\r\nforce of Darwin's masterpiece is a thousand times a greater and nobler\r\nmonument of human endeavour.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteen years from 1844 to 1859, however, Darwin's pen was by\r\nno means idle. In the first-named year he published his 'Geological\r\nObservations on Volcanic Islands'--part of the 'Beagle' exploration\r\nseries; in 1846 he followed this up by his 'Geological Observations on\r\nSouth America;' in 1851 he gave to the world his monograph on 'Recent\r\nBarnacles;' and in 1853, his treatise on the fossil species of the same\r\nfamily. But all these works of restricted interest remained always\r\nsubsidiary to the one great central task of his entire lifetime, the\r\npreparation of his projected volume on the Origin of Species.\r\n\r\nAll through the middle decades of the century Darwin continued to labour\r\nat his vast accumulation of illustrative facts; and side by side with\r\nhis continuous toil, outside opinion kept paving the way for the final\r\nacceptance of his lucid ideas. The public was buying and reading all the\r\ntime its ten editions of the 'Vestiges of Creation.' It was slowly\r\ndigesting Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' in which the old cataclysmic\r\ntheories were featly demolished, and the uniformitarian conception of a\r\npast gradually and insensibly merging into the present was conclusively\r\nestablished. It was getting accustomed to statements like those of the\r\nyounger St. Hilaire, in 1850, that specific characters may be modified\r\nby changes in the environing conditions, and that the modifications thus\r\nproduced may often be of generic value--may make a difference so great\r\nthat we must regard the product not merely as belonging to a distinct\r\nspecies, but even to a distinct genus or higher kind. In 1852 Herbert\r\nSpencer published in the 'Leader' his remarkable essay, contrasting the\r\ntheories of creation and evolution, as applied to organic beings, with\r\nall the biting force of his profound intelligence; and in 1855, the same\r\nencyclopædic philosopher put forth the first rough sketch of his\r\n'Principles of Psychology,' in which he took the lead in treating the\r\nphenomena of mind from the point of view of gradual development. In that\r\nextraordinary work, the philosopher of evolution traced the origin of\r\nall mental powers and faculties by slow gradations from the very\r\nsimplest subjective elements. The 'Principles of Psychology' preceded\r\nthe 'Origin of Species' by nearly five years; the first collected volume\r\nof Mr. Spencer's essays preceded Darwin's work by some twelve months.\r\nBaden-Powell's essay on the 'Philosophy of Creation' (much debated and\r\ncondemned in ecclesiastical circles), and Professor Owen's somewhat\r\ncontradictory utterances on the nature of types and archetypal ideas,\r\nalso helped to keep alive interest in the problem of origins up to the\r\nvery moment of the final appearance of Darwin's great and splendid\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting during these intermediate years to watch from time to\r\ntime the occasional side-hints of Darwin's activity and of the interest\r\nit aroused among his scientific contemporaries. In 1854, for example,\r\nSir Charles Lyell notes, after an evening at Darwin's, how Sir Joseph\r\nHooker astonished him with an account of that strange orchid, Catasetum,\r\nwhich bears three totally distinct kinds of flowers on the same plant;\r\n'It will figure,' he says, 'in C. Darwin's book on species, with many\r\nother \"ugly facts,\" as Hooker, clinging like me to the orthodox faith,\r\ncalls these and other abnormal vagaries.' On a similar occasion, a\r\nlittle later, Lyell asks, after meeting 'Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston\r\nat Darwin's,' 'After all, did we not come from an ourang?' Last of all,\r\nin 1857, Darwin himself writes an anticipatory letter to his American\r\nfriend, Asa Gray, in which he mentions 'six points'--the cardinal\r\nconceptions of the 'Origin of Species.' His book is now fairly under\r\nweigh; he speaks of it himself to acquaintance and correspondents as an\r\nacknowledged project.\r\n\r\nEvents were growing ripe for the birth. A lucky accident precipitated\r\nits parturition in the course of the year 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n'THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accident came in this wise.\r\n\r\nAlfred Russel Wallace, a young Welsh biologist, went out at twenty-four,\r\nin 1848, to the Amazons River, in company with Bates (the author of 'The\r\nNaturalist on the Amazons'), to collect birds and butterflies, and to\r\nstudy tropical life in the richest region of equatorial America. Like\r\nall other higher zoologists of their time, the two young explorers were\r\ndeeply interested in the profound questions of origin and metamorphosis,\r\nand of geographical distribution, and in the letters that passed between\r\nthem before they started they avowed to one another that the object of\r\ntheir quest was a solution of the pressing biological enigma of creation\r\nor evolution. Starting with fresh hopes and a few pounds in pocket, on\r\nan old, worn-out, and unseaworthy slave-trader, they often discussed\r\nthese deep problems of life and nature together upon the Sargasso sea,\r\nor among the palms and lianas of the Brazilian woodlands. The air was\r\nthick with whiffs and foretastes of evolutionism, and the two budding\r\nnaturalists of the Amazons expedition had inhaled them eagerly with\r\nevery breath. They saw among the mimicking organisms of that equatorial\r\nzone strange puzzles to engage their deepest attention; they recognised\r\nin the veins and spots that diversified the filmy membranes of insects'\r\nwings the hieroglyphs of nature, writing as on a tablet for them to\r\ndecipher the story of the slow modification of species. In 1852--the\r\nyear when Herbert Spencer in England published his essay on the\r\n'Development Hypothesis,' and when Naudin in France put forth his bold\r\nand able paper on the 'Origin of Species'--Wallace once more returned to\r\nEurope, and gave to the world his interesting 'Travels on the Amazons\r\nand the Rio Negro.' Two years later the indefatigable traveller set out\r\na second time on a voyage of tropical exploration, among the islands of\r\nthe Malay archipelago, and for eight years he wandered about in Malay\r\nhuts and remote islets, gathering in solitude and isolation the enormous\r\nstore of minute facts which he afterwards lavished with so prodigal a\r\nhand upon 'Tropical Nature,' and the 'Geographical Distribution of\r\nAnimals.'\r\n\r\nWhile Wallace was still at Amboyna, he sent home in 1858 a striking\r\nmemoir, addressed to Darwin, with a request that he would forward it to\r\nSir Charles Lyell, for presentation to the Linnean Society. Darwin\r\nopened and read his brother naturalist's paper, and found to his\r\nsurprise that it contained his own theory of natural selection, not\r\nworked out in detail, as he himself was working it out, but still\r\ncomplete in spirit and essence, with no important portion of the central\r\nidea lacking to its full rotundity of conception. A jealous man would\r\nhave thrown obstacles in the way of publication; but both Darwin and\r\nWallace were born superior to the meannesses of jealousy. The elder\r\nnaturalist commended his young rival's paper at once to Sir Charles\r\nLyell, who sent it on immediately to the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Charles Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker, both of whom knew of\r\nDarwin's work, thought it advisable that he should publish, in the\r\n'Journal' of the Society, a few extracts from his own manuscripts, side\r\nby side with Wallace's paper. Darwin, therefore, selected some essential\r\npassages for the purpose from his own long-gathered and voluminous\r\nnotes, and the two contributions were read together before the Society\r\non July the 1st, 1858. That double communication marks the date of birth\r\nof modern evolutionism. It is to the eternal credit of both thinkers\r\nthat each accepted his own true position with regard to the great\r\ndiscovery in perfect sincerity. The elder naturalist never strove for a\r\nmoment to press his own claim to priority against the younger: the\r\nyounger, with singular generosity and courtesy, waived his own claim to\r\ndivide the honours of discovery in favour of the elder. Not one word\r\nsave words of fraternal admiration and cordial appreciation ever passed\r\nthe lips of either with regard to the other.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive notion of natural selection, indeed, like all true and\r\nfruitful ideas, had more than once flashed for a moment across the\r\npenetrating mind of more than one independent investigator. As early as\r\n1813, Dr. Wells, the famous author of the theory of dew, applied that\r\nparticular conception to the single case of the production of special\r\nraces among mankind.\r\n\r\n'Of the accidental varieties of man, which would occur among the first\r\nfew and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa,' he\r\nwrote, 'some one would be better fitted than the others to bear the\r\ndiseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply, while\r\nthe others would decrease; not only from their inability to sustain the\r\nattacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending with their\r\nmore vigorous neighbours.... The same disposition to form varieties\r\nstill existing, a darker and a darker race would in the course of time\r\noccur; and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the climate, this\r\nwould at last become the most prevalent, if not the only race in the\r\ncountry.' Here we have not merely the radical concept of natural\r\nselection, but also the subordinate idea of its exertion upon what\r\nDarwin calls 'spontaneous variations.' What is wanting in the paper is\r\nthe application of the faintly descried law to the facts and\r\ncircumstances of general biology: Wells saw only a particular instance,\r\nwhere Darwin and Wallace more vividly perceived a universal principle.\r\nAgain, in 1831, Mr. Patrick Matthew in that singular appendix to his\r\nbook on naval timber actually enunciates the same idea, applied this\r\ntime to the whole of nature, in words sometimes almost identical with\r\nDarwin's own. 'As nature in all her modifications of life,' says this\r\nunconscious discoverer, 'has a power of increase far beyond what is\r\nneeded to supply the place of what falls by Time's decay, those\r\nindividuals who possess not the requisite strength, swiftness,\r\nhardihood, or cunning, fall prematurely without reproducing--either a\r\nprey to their natural devourers, or sinking under disease, generally\r\ninduced by want of nourishment, their place being occupied by the more\r\nperfect of their own kind, who are pressing on the means of\r\nexistence.... The self-regulating adaptive disposition of organised life\r\nmay, in part, be traced to the extreme fecundity of nature, who, as\r\nbefore stated, has in all the varieties of her offspring a prolific\r\npower much beyond (in many cases a thousandfold) what is necessary to\r\nfill up the vacancies caused by senile decay. As the field of existence\r\nis limited and preoccupied, it is only the hardier, more robust,\r\nbetter-suited-to-circumstance individuals, who are able to struggle\r\nforward to maturity, these inhabiting only the situations to which they\r\nhave superior adaptation and greater power of occupancy than any other\r\nkind; the weaker and less circumstance-suited being prematurely\r\ndestroyed. This principle is in constant action; it regulates the\r\ncolour, the figure, the capacities, and instincts; those individuals in\r\neach species whose colour and covering are best suited to concealment or\r\nprotection from enemies, or defence from inclemencies and vicissitudes\r\nof climate, whose figure is best accommodated to health, strength,\r\ndefence, and support; whose capacities and instincts can best regulate\r\nthe physical energies to self-advantage according to circumstances--in\r\nsuch immense waste of primary and youthful life those only come forward\r\nto maturity from the strict ordeal by which nature tests their\r\nadaptation to her standard of perfection and fitness to continue their\r\nkind by reproduction.' Of the ideas expressed in these paragraphs, and\r\nothers which preceded them, Darwin himself rightly observes, 'He gives\r\nprecisely the same view on the origin of species as that propounded by\r\nMr. Wallace and myself. He clearly saw the full force of the principle\r\nof natural selection.'\r\n\r\nIn 1852, once more, so eminent and confirmed an evolutionist as Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer himself had hit upon a glimpse of the same great truth,\r\nstrange to say without perceiving the width and scope of its\r\nimplications. 'All mankind,' he wrote in that year in an essay on\r\npopulation in the 'Westminster Review,' 'in turn subject themselves more\r\nor less to the discipline described; they either may or may not advance\r\nunder it; but, in the nature of things, only those who _do_ advance\r\nunder it eventually survive. For, necessarily, families and races whom\r\nthis increasing difficulty of getting a living which excess of fertility\r\nentails does not stimulate to improvements in production.... are on the\r\nhigh road to extinction; and must ultimately be supplanted by those whom\r\nthe pressure does so stimulate.... And here, indeed, without further\r\nillustration, it will be seen that premature death, under all its forms,\r\nand from all its causes, cannot fail to work in the same direction. For\r\nas those prematurely carried off must, in the average of cases, be those\r\nin whom the power of self-preservation is the least, it unavoidably\r\nfollows that those left behind to continue the race must be those in\r\nwhom the power of self-preservation is the greatest, must be the select\r\nof their generation.' In this striking pre-Darwinian passage we have a\r\npartial perception of what Mr. Spencer afterwards described as the\r\nsurvival of the fittest; but, as our great philosopher himself remarks,\r\nit 'shows how near one may be to a great generalisation without seeing\r\nit.' For not only does Mr. Spencer, like Wells before him, limit the\r\napplication of the principle to the case of humanity; but, unlike Wells,\r\nhe overlooks the all-important factor of spontaneous variation, and the\r\npower of natural selection, acting upon such, to produce specific and\r\ngeneric divergences of structure. In short, in his own words, the\r\nparagraph 'contains merely a passing recognition of the selective\r\nprocess, and indicates no suspicion of the enormous range of its\r\neffects, or of the conditions under which a large part of its effects\r\nare produced.' On the other hand, it must be noted that both Spencer and\r\nMatthew, like Darwin himself, based their ideas largely upon the\r\nMalthusian principle, and thus held the two true keys of the situation\r\nfairly within their unconscious hands.\r\n\r\nFrankly to recognise these various foreshadowings of the distinctive\r\nDarwinian theory of natural selection is not in any way to undermine the\r\nfoundations of Charles Darwin's own real and exceptional greatness. On\r\nthe contrary, the mere fact that his views were so far anticipated by\r\nWells, Matthew, Spencer, and others, and were simultaneously arrived at\r\nacross half the globe by the independent intellect of Alfred Russel\r\nWallace, is in itself the very best proof and finest criterion of\r\nCharles Darwin's genuine apostleship. No truly grand and fruitful idea\r\nwas ever yet the sole property of a single originator. Great\r\ndiscoveries, says an acute critic, must always be concerned with some\r\nproblem of the time which many of the world's foremost minds are just\r\nthen cudgelling their active brains about. It was so with the discovery\r\nof the differential calculus, and of the planet Neptune; with the\r\ninterpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and of the cuneiform\r\ninscriptions; with the undulatory theory of light, with the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat, with the doctrine of the correlation and\r\nconservation of energies, with the invention of the steam engine, the\r\nlocomotive, the telegraph and the telephone; with the nebular\r\nhypothesis, and with spectrum analysis. It was so, too, with the\r\nevolutionary movement. The fertile upturning of virgin sod in the\r\nbiological field which produced Darwin's forerunners, as regards the\r\nidea of descent with modification, in the persons of Buffon, Lamarck,\r\nand Erasmus Darwin, necessarily produced a little later, under the fresh\r\nimpetus of the Malthusian conception, his forerunners or coadjutors, as\r\nregards the idea of natural selection, in the persons of Wells, Matthew,\r\nand Wallace. It was Darwin's task to recognise the universal, where\r\nWells and Spencer had seen only the particular; to build up a vast and\r\nirresistible inductive system, where Matthew and Wallace had but thrown\r\nout a pregnant hint of wonderful _a priori_ interest and suggestiveness.\r\nIt is one thing to draw out the idea of a campaign, another thing to\r\ncarry it to a successful conclusion; one thing rudely to sketch a\r\nground-plan, another thing finally to pile aloft to the sky the front of\r\nan august and imposing fabric.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the papers at the Linnean had been read and printed, Darwin\r\nset to work in real earnest to bring out the first instalment of his\r\ngreat work. That instalment was the 'Origin of Species.' The first\r\nedition was ready for the public on November the 24th, 1859.\r\n\r\nIn his own mind Darwin regarded that immortal work merely in the light\r\nof an abstract of his projected volumes. So immense were his collections\r\nand so voluminous his notes that the 'Origin of Species' itself seemed\r\nto him like a mere small portion of the contemplated publication. And\r\nindeed he did ultimately work out several other portions of his original\r\nplan in his detailed treatises on the Variation of Animals and Plants\r\nunder Domestication, on the Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation, and\r\non the Descent of Man and Sexual Selection. But the immense and\r\nunexpected vogue of his first volume, the almost immediate revolution\r\nwhich it caused in biological and general opinion, and the all but\r\nuniversal adhesion to his views of all the greatest and most rising\r\nnaturalists, to a great extent saved him the trouble of carrying out in\r\nfull the task he had originally contemplated as necessary. Younger and\r\nless occupied labourers took part of the work off their leader's hands;\r\nthe great chief was left to prosecute his special researches in some\r\nspecial lines, and was relieved from the necessity of further proving in\r\nminuter detail what he had already proved with sufficient cogency to\r\nconvince all but the wilfully blind or the hopelessly stupid.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary and unprecedented success of the 'Origin of Species'\r\nis the truest test of the advance it made upon all previous evolutionary\r\ntheorising. Those who had never been convinced before were now convinced\r\nby sheer force of reasoning; those who believed and those who wavered\r\nhad their faith confirmed into something like the reposeful calm of\r\nabsolute certitude.\r\n\r\nLet us consider, therefore, what exactly were the additions which\r\nCharles Darwin offered in his epoch-making work to the pre-existing\r\nconceptions of evolutionists.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, seven years before the publication of Darwin's masterpiece, Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer wrote as follows in an essay in the 'Leader' on creation\r\nand evolution. The expressions of so profound and philosophical a\r\nbiologist may be regarded as the high-water mark of evolutionary\r\nthinking up to the date of the appearance of Wallace and Darwin's\r\ntheory:--\r\n\r\n'Even could the supporters of the development hypothesis merely show\r\nthat the production of species by the process of modification is\r\nconceivable, they would be in a better position than their opponents.\r\nBut they can do much more than this; they can show that the process of\r\nmodification has effected and is effecting great changes in all\r\norganisms, subject to modifying influences ... they can show that any\r\nexisting species--animal or vegetable--when placed under conditions\r\ndifferent from its previous ones, immediately begins to undergo certain\r\nchanges of structure fitting it for the new conditions. They can show\r\nthat in successive generations these changes continue until ultimately\r\nthe new conditions become the natural ones. They can show that in\r\ncultivated plants and domesticated animals, and in the several races of\r\nmen, these changes have uniformly taken place. They can show that the\r\ndegrees of difference, so produced, are often, as in dogs, greater than\r\nthose on which distinctions of species are in other cases founded. They\r\ncan show that it is a matter of dispute whether some of these modified\r\nforms _are_ varieties or modified species. They can show too that the\r\nchanges daily taking place in ourselves; the facility that attends long\r\npractice, and the loss of aptitude that begins when practice ceases; the\r\ndevelopment of every faculty, bodily, moral or intellectual, according\r\nto the use made of it, are all explicable on this same principle. And\r\nthus they can show that throughout all organic nature there _is_ at\r\nwork a modifying influence of the kind they assign as the cause of these\r\nspecific differences, an influence which, though slow in its action,\r\ndoes in time, if the circumstances demand it, produce marked changes; an\r\ninfluence which, to all appearance, would produce in the millions of\r\nyears, and under the great varieties of condition which geological\r\nrecords imply, any amount of change.'\r\n\r\nThis admirable passage, written seven years before the publication of\r\nthe 'Origin of Species,' contains explicitly almost every idea that\r\nordinary people, not specially biological in their interests, now\r\nassociate with the name of Darwin. That is to say, it contains, in a\r\nvery philosophical and abstract form, the theory of 'descent with\r\nmodification' _without_ the distinctive Darwinian adjunct of 'natural\r\nselection' or 'survival of the fittest.' Yet it was just that particular\r\nlever, dexterously applied, and carefully weighted with the whole weight\r\nof his endlessly accumulated inductive instances, that finally enabled\r\nour modern Archimedes in so short a time to move the world. The public,\r\nthat was deaf to the high philosophy of Herbert Spencer, listened at\r\nonce to the practical wisdom of Charles Darwin. They did not care at all\r\nfor the _a priori_ proof, but they believed forthwith as soon as a\r\ncautious and careful investigator laid bare before their eyes in minute\r\ndetail the _modus operandi_ of nature herself.\r\n\r\nThe main argument of Darwin's chief work runs somewhat after the\r\nfollowing fashion[2]:--\r\n\r\nVariation, to a greater or less degree, is a common and well-known fact\r\nin nature. More especially, animals and plants under domestication tend\r\nto vary from one another far more than do the individuals of any one\r\nspecies in the wild state. Rabbits in a warren are all alike in shape,\r\nsize, colour, and features: rabbits in a hutch vary indefinitely in the\r\nhue of their fur, the length of their ears, the character of their coat,\r\nand half a dozen other minor particulars, well known to the observant\r\nsouls of boys and fanciers. This great variability, though partly\r\nperhaps referable to excess of food, is probably due on the whole to\r\ntheir having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and\r\nsomewhat different from, those to which the parent species is commonly\r\nexposed in a state of nature. In other words, variability is one result\r\nof altered and more varied surrounding circumstances.\r\n\r\nAgain, this variability is usually indefinite. You cannot say what\r\ndirection it will take, or to what particular results it is likely in\r\nany special instance to lead. Marked differences sometimes occur even\r\nbetween the young of the same litter, or between the seedlings sown from\r\nthe same capsule. As a rule, the variations exhibit themselves in\r\nconnection with sexual reproduction; but sometimes, as in the case of\r\n'sporting plants,' a new bud suddenly produces leaves or flowers of a\r\ndifferent character from the rest of those on the self-same stem, thus\r\nshowing that the tendency to vary is inherent, as it were, in the\r\norganism itself. Upon this fundamental fact of the existence in nature\r\nof numerous and indefinite variations, the whole theory of natural\r\nselection is ultimately built up. In illustrating by example the immense\r\nvariability of domesticated creatures, Darwin lays great stress upon the\r\ncase of pigeons, with which he was familiar from his long experience as\r\na breeder and fancier in his own home at Down. Naturalists are almost\r\nuniversally of opinion that all the breeds of domestic pigeons, from the\r\ncarrier to the tumbler, from the runt to the fantail, are alike\r\ndescended from the wild rock pigeon of the European coasts. The immense\r\namount of variation which this original species has undergone in\r\ndomestication may be seen by comparing the numberless breeds of pigeon\r\nnow exhibited at all our poultry shows with one another.\r\n\r\nBut variation gives us only half the elements of the ultimate problem,\r\neven in the case of domestic kinds. For the other half, we must have\r\nrecourse to human selection, which, by picking out for seed or breeding\r\npurposes certain specially favoured varieties, has produced at last all\r\nthe purposive or intentional diversity between the different existing\r\nstocks or breeds. In these artificially produced domestic races we see\r\neverywhere special adaptations to man's particular use or fancy. The\r\ndray-horse has been fashioned for purposes of strength and\r\nsure-footedness in draught, the race-horse for purposes of fleetness in\r\nrunning. In the fox-hound, man has encouraged the special properties\r\nthat tend to produce a good day's hunting; in the sheepdog, those that\r\nmake for the better maintenance and safety of a herd. The cauliflower is\r\na cabbage, with specialised and somewhat abortive flower-heads; the\r\nfuller's teasel is a sport of the wild form, with curved hooks specially\r\nadapted by a freak of nature for the teasing of wool. So in every case\r\nman, by deliberately picking out for breeding or seeding purposes the\r\naccidental variations which happened best to suit his own needs, has\r\nsucceeded at last in producing races admirably fitted in the minutest\r\nparticulars for the special functions to which they are applied. There\r\nappears indeed to be hardly any limit to the almost infinite plasticity\r\nand modifiability of domestic animals. 'It would seem,' said a great\r\nsheep-breeder, speaking of sheep, 'as if farmers had chalked out upon a\r\nwall a form perfect in itself, and then proceeded to give it existence.'\r\n\r\nNow, what is thus true within narrow limits, and in a short space of\r\ntime about the deliberate action of man, Darwin showed to be also true\r\nwithin wider limits and spread over longer geological epochs about the\r\nunconscious action of nature. And herein consisted his great advance\r\nupon the earlier evolutionism of Lamarck, Goethe, and Erasmus Darwin.\r\nFor while these instinctive pioneers of the evolutionary spirit saw\r\nclearly that animals and plants betrayed signs of common descent from\r\none or a few original ancestors, they did not see what was the mechanism\r\nby which such organisms had been differentiated into so many distinct\r\ngenera and species. They caught, indeed, at the analogy of variation\r\nunder domestication and in the wild state, but they missed the subtler\r\nand deeper analogy between human and natural selection. Now, variation\r\nalone would give us a world consisting not of definite kinds fairly well\r\ndemarcated one from the other, but of innumerable unclassified and\r\nunorganisable individuals, all shading off indefinitely one into the\r\nother, and incapable of being reduced by human ingenuity to any orderly\r\nhierarchical system. Furthermore, it would give us creatures without\r\nspecial adaptation of any kind to the peculiar circumstances of their\r\nown environment. To account for adaptation, for the almost perfect\r\nfitness of every plant and every animal to its position in life, for the\r\nexistence (in other words) of definitely correlated parts and organs, we\r\nmust call in the aid of survival of the fittest. Without that potent\r\nselective agent, our conception of the becoming of life is a mere chaos;\r\norder and organisation are utterly inexplicable save by the brilliant\r\nilluminating ray of the Darwinian principle. That is why Darwin\r\ndestroyed at one blow the specious arguments of the early teleologists;\r\nhe showed that where Chambers and even Erasmus Darwin had seen the\r\nworking of a final cause, we ought rather to recognise the working of an\r\nefficient cause, whose outcome necessarily but fallaciously simulates\r\nthe supposed features of an _a priori_ finality.\r\n\r\nFrom art, then, Darwin harks back once more to nature. He proceeds to\r\nshow that variability occurs among all wild plants and animals, though\r\nnot so frequently under ordinary circumstances as in the case of\r\ndomesticated species. Individual differences everywhere occur between\r\nplant and plant, between animal and animal. Sometimes these differences\r\nare so very numerous that it is impossible to divide the individuals at\r\nall into well-marked kinds; for example, among British wild-roses,\r\nbrambles, hawkweeds and epilobes, with a few other very variable\r\nfamilies, Babington makes as many as 251 distinct species, where\r\nBentham gives only 112--a margin of 139 doubtful forms of shadowy\r\nindefiniteness. Varieties, in fact, are always arising, and dominant\r\nspecies in particular always tend to vary most in every direction. The\r\nreason why variation is not so marked in the wild state as under\r\ndomestication is of course because the conditions are there less\r\ndiverse; but where the conditions of wild things are most diverse, as in\r\nthe case of dominant kinds, which range over a wide space of country or\r\nof ocean, abundant individual variations habitually occur. Local\r\nvarieties thus produced are regarded by Darwin as incipient species:\r\nthey are the raw material on which natural selection gradually exerts\r\nitself in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nGranting individual variability, then, how do species arise in nature?\r\nAnd how are all the exquisite adaptations of part to whole, and of whole\r\nto environment, gradually initiated, improved, and perfected?\r\n\r\nHere Malthus and the struggle for life come in to help us.\r\n\r\nFor the world is perpetually over-populated. It is not, as many good\r\npeople fearfully imagine, on a half-comprehension of the Malthusian\r\nprinciple, shortly going to be over-populated; it is now, it has always\r\nbeen, and it will always be, pressed close up to the utmost possible\r\nlimit of population. Reproduction is everywhere and in all species for\r\never outrunning means of subsistence; and starvation or competition is\r\nfor ever keeping down the number of the offspring to the level of the\r\naverage or normal supply of raw material. A single red campion produces\r\nin a year three thousand seeds; but there are not this year three\r\nthousand times as many red campions as there were last summer, nor will\r\nthere be three thousand times as many more in the succeeding season. The\r\nroe of a cod contains sometimes nearly ten million eggs; but supposing\r\neach of these produced a young fish which arrived at maturity, the whole\r\nsea would immediately become a solid mass of closely packed codfish.\r\nLinnæus reckoned that if an annual plant had two seeds, each of which\r\nproduced two seedlings in the succeeding season, and so on continually,\r\nin twenty years their progeny would amount to a million plants. A\r\nstruggle for existence necessarily results from this universal tendency\r\nof animals and plants to increase faster than the means of subsistence,\r\nwhether those means be food, as in the first case, or carbonic acid,\r\nwater, and sunshine as in the second. Animals are all perpetually\r\nbattling with one another for the food-supply of the moment; plants are\r\nperpetually battling with one another for their share of the soil, the\r\nrainfall, and the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe case of the plant is a very important one to understand in this\r\nconnection, because it is probable that most people greatly\r\nmisunderstand the biological meaning of the phrase 'struggle for\r\nexistence.' They imagine that the struggle is chiefly conducted between\r\ndifferent species, whereas in reality it is chiefly conducted between\r\nmembers of the same species. It is not so much the battle between the\r\ntiger and the antelope, between the wolf and the bison, between the\r\nsnake and the bird, that ultimately results in natural selection or\r\nsurvival of the fittest, as the struggle between tiger and tiger,\r\nbetween bison and bison, between snake and snake, between antelope and\r\nantelope. A human analogy may help to make this difficult principle a\r\nlittle clearer. The baker does not fear the competition of the butcher\r\nin the struggle for life: it is the competition of the other bakers that\r\nsometimes inexorably crushes him out of existence. The lawyer does not\r\npress hard upon the doctor, nor the architect upon the journeyman\r\npainter. A war in the Soudan or in South Africa is far less fatal to the\r\nworkman in our great towns than the ceaseless competition of his\r\nfellow-workmen. It is not the soldier that kills the artisan, but the\r\nnumber of other artisans who undersell him and crowd to fill up every\r\nvacant position. In this way the great enemies of the individual\r\nherbivore are not the carnivores, but the other herbivores. The lion\r\neats the antelope, to be sure; but the real struggle lies between lion\r\nand lion for a fair share of meat, or between antelope and antelope for\r\na fair share of pasturage. _Homo homini lupus_, says the old proverb,\r\nand so, we may add, in a wider sense, _lupus lupo lupus_, also. Of\r\ncourse, the carnivore plays a great part in the selective process; but\r\nhe is the selector only; the real competition is between the selected.\r\nNow, let us take the case of the plant. A thousand seedlings occupy the\r\nspace where few alone can ultimately grow; and between these seedlings\r\nthe struggle is fierce, the strongest and best adapted ultimately\r\nsurviving. To take Darwin's own example, the mistletoe, which is a\r\nparasite, cannot truly be said to struggle with the apple tree on which\r\nit fastens; for if too many parasites cover a tree, it perishes, and so\r\nthey kill themselves as well as their host, all alike dying together.\r\nBut several seedling mistletoes growing together on the same branch may\r\nfairly be said to struggle with one another for light and air; and since\r\nmistletoe seeds are disseminated by birds and dropped by them in the\r\nangles of branches, the mistletoe may also be said to compete with other\r\nberry-bearing bushes, like cornel and hawthorn, for the ministrations of\r\nthe fruit-eating birds. The struggle is fierce between allied kinds, and\r\nfiercest of all between individual members of the same species.\r\n\r\nOwing to this constant struggle, variations, however slight, and from\r\nwhatever cause arising, if in any degree profitable to the individual\r\nwhich presents them, will tend to the preservation of the particular\r\norganism, and, being on the average inherited by its offspring, will\r\nsimilarly tend to increase and multiply in the world at large. This is\r\nthe principle of natural selection or survival of the fittest--the great\r\nprinciple which Darwin and Wallace added to the evolutionism of Lamarck\r\nand his successors.\r\n\r\nLet us take a single concrete example. In the desert, with its\r\nmonotonous sandy colouring, a black insect or a white insect, still more\r\na red insect or a blue insect, would be immediately detected and\r\npromptly devoured by its natural enemies, the birds and lizards. But any\r\ngreyish or yellowish insects would be less likely to attract attention\r\nat first sight, and would be overlooked as long as there were any more\r\nconspicuous individuals of their own kind about for the birds and\r\nlizards to feed on at their leisure. Hence, in a very short time, the\r\ndesert would be depopulated of all but the greyest and yellowest\r\ninsects; and among these the birds would pick out those which differed\r\nmost markedly in hue or shade from the sand around them. But those\r\nwhich happened to vary most in the direction of a sandy or spotty colour\r\nwould be most likely to survive, and to become the parents of future\r\ngenerations. Thus, in the course of long ages, all the insects which\r\ninhabit deserts have become sand-coloured; because the least sandy were\r\nperpetually picked out for destruction by their ever-watchful foes,\r\nwhile the most sandy escaped and multiplied and replenished the earth\r\nwith their own likes.\r\n\r\nConversely, the birds and the lizards again would probably begin by\r\nbeing black, and white, and blue, and green, like most other birds and\r\nlizards in the world generally. But the insect would have ample warning\r\nof the near approach of such conspicuous self-advertising enemies, and\r\nwould avoid them accordingly whenever they appeared within range of his\r\nlimited vision, either by lying close, or by shamming death, or by\r\nretreating precipitately to holes and crannies. Therefore, whatever\r\nindividual birds or lizards happened to vary most in the direction of\r\ngrey or sand-colour, and so to creep unobserved upon the unguarded\r\ninsects, would succeed best on the average in catching beetles or desert\r\ngrasshoppers. Hence, by the slow dying out of the more highly coloured\r\nand distinctive insect-eaters, before the severe competition of the\r\ngreyest and sandiest, all the birds and lizards of the desert have\r\nbecome at last as absolutely sand-coloured as the insects themselves.\r\nOnly the greyest insect could escape the bird; only the greyest bird,\r\n_en revanche_, could surprise and devour the unwary insect.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell and the elder De Candolle had already seen the great\r\nimportance of the struggle for existence in the organic world, but\r\nneither of them had observed the magnificent corollary of natural\r\nselection, which flows from it almost as a mathematical necessity when\r\nonce suggested; for, given indefinite variability, and a geometrical,\r\nrate of increase, it must needs follow that some varieties will be\r\nbetter suited to the circumstances than others, and therefore that they\r\nwill survive on the average in increased proportions. A passage from one\r\nof Lyell's early letters will show how near he too went to this great\r\nluminous generalisation, and yet how utterly he missed the true\r\nimplications of his own vague and chaotic idea. He writes thus to Sir\r\nJohn Herschel in 1836, while Darwin was still but homeward bound on the\r\nvoyage of the 'Beagle':--\r\n\r\n'In regard to the origination of new species, I am very glad to find\r\nthat you think it probable that it may be carried on through the\r\nintervention of intermediate causes.... An insect may be made in one of\r\nits transformations to resemble a dead stick, or a leaf, or a lichen, or\r\na stone, so as to be somewhat less easily found by its enemies; or if\r\nthis would make it too strong, an occasional variety of the species may\r\nhave this advantage conferred on it; or if this would be still too much,\r\none sex of a certain variety. Probably there is scarcely a dash of\r\ncolour on the wing or body of which the choice would be quite arbitrary,\r\nor which might not affect its duration for thousands of years.'\r\n\r\nNow, this comes in some ways perilously near to Darwin indeed; but in\r\nthe most important point of all it is wide apart from him as the pole is\r\nfrom the equator. For Lyell thought of all this as a matter of external\r\nteleological arrangement; he imagined a deliberate power from outside\r\nsettling it all by design beforehand, and granting to varieties or\r\nspecies these special peculiarities in a manner that was at bottom\r\nessentially supernatural, or in other words miraculous; whereas Darwin\r\nthinks of it as the necessary result of the circumstances themselves, an\r\ninevitable outcome of indefinite variability _plus_ the geometrical rate\r\nof increase. Where Lyell sees a final cause, Darwin sees an efficient\r\ncause; and this distinction is fundamental. It marks Darwin's position\r\nas that of a great philosophical thinker, who can dash aside at once all\r\nmetaphysical cobwebs, and penetrate to the inmost recesses of things,\r\nunswerved by the vain but specious allurements of obvious and misleading\r\nteleological fallacies.\r\n\r\nDarwin also laid great stress on the immense complexity of the relations\r\nwhich animals and plants bear to one another, in the struggle for\r\nexistence. For example, on the heathy uplands near Farnham in Surrey,\r\nlarge spaces were at one time enclosed, on which, within ten years,\r\nself-grown fir-trees from the wind-borne seeds of distant clumps sprang\r\nup so thickly as actually to choke one another with their tiny branches.\r\nAll over the heaths outside, when Darwin looked for them, he could not\r\nfind a single fir, except the old clumps on the hilltops, from which the\r\nseedlings themselves had originally sprung. But, on looking closer among\r\nthe stems of the heath, he descried a number of very tiny firs, which\r\nhad been perpetually browsed down by the cattle on the commons; and one\r\nof them, with twenty-six rings of growth, had during many years\r\nendeavoured unsuccessfully to raise its head above the surrounding\r\nheather. Hence, as soon as the land was enclosed, and the cattle\r\nexcluded, it became covered at once with a thick growth of vigorous\r\nyoung fir-trees. Yet who would ever have supposed beforehand that the\r\nmere presence or absence of cattle would absolutely have determined the\r\nvery existence of the Scotch fir throughout a wide range of well-adapted\r\nsandy English upland?\r\n\r\nTo take another curious instance mentioned by Darwin. In Paraguay,\r\nunlike the greater part of neighbouring South America, neither horses\r\nnor cattle have ever run wild. This is due to the presence of a\r\nparasitic fly, which lays its eggs in their bodies when first born, the\r\nmaggots killing off the tender young in their first stages. But if any\r\ncause were to alter the number of the dangerous flies, then cattle and\r\nwild horses would abound; and this would alter the vegetation, as Darwin\r\nhimself observed in other parts of America; and the change in the\r\nvegetation would affect the insects; and that again the insectivorous\r\nbirds; and so on in ever widening circles of incalculable complexity.\r\nOnce more, to quote the most famous instance of all, the visits of\r\nhumble-bees are absolutely necessary in order to place the pollen in the\r\nright position for setting the seeds of purple clover. Heads from which\r\nDarwin excluded the bees produced no seeds at all. Hence, if humble-bees\r\nbecame extinct in England, the red clover, too, would die off: and\r\nindeed, in New Zealand, where there are no humble-bees, and where the\r\nefforts to introduce them for this very purpose have been uniformly\r\nunsuccessful, the clover never sets its seed at all, and fresh stocks\r\nhave to be imported at great expense every year from Europe. But the\r\nnumber of humble-bees in any district largely depends upon the number of\r\nfield-mice, which destroy the combs and nests in immense quantities.\r\nThe number of mice, again, is greatly affected by the proportion of cats\r\nin the neighbourhood; so that Colonel Newman, who paid much attention to\r\nthis subject, found humble-bees most numerous in the neighbourhood of\r\nvillages and small towns, an effect which he attributed to the abundance\r\nof cats, and the consequent scarcity of the destructive field-mice. Yet\r\nhere once more, who could suppose beforehand that the degree to which\r\nthe purple clover set its seeds was in part determined by the number of\r\ncats kept in houses in the surrounding district?\r\n\r\nOne of Darwin's own favourite examples of the action of natural\r\nselection, which he afterwards expanded largely in his work on Orchids\r\nand in several other volumes, is that which relates to the origin of\r\nconspicuous flowers. Many plants have a sweet excretion, which is\r\neliminated sometimes even by the leaves, as in the case of the common\r\nlaurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is eagerly sought and\r\neaten by insects. Now let us suppose that, in some variety of an\r\ninconspicuous flower, similar nectar was produced in the neighbourhood\r\nof the petals and stamens. Insects, in seeking the nectar, would dust\r\ntheir bodies over with the pollen, and would carry it away with them to\r\nthe next flower visited. This would result in an act of crossing; and\r\nthat act, as Darwin afterwards abundantly proved in a separate and very\r\nlaborious treatise, gives rise to exceptionally vigorous seedlings,\r\nwhich would therefore have the best chance of flourishing and surviving\r\nin the struggle for existence. The flowers which produced most honey\r\nwould oftenest be visited, and oftenest crossed; so that they would\r\nfinally form a new species. The more brightly coloured among them,\r\nagain, would be more readily discriminated than the less brightly\r\ncoloured; and this would give them such an advantage that in the long\r\nrun, as we actually see, almost all habitually insect-fertilised flowers\r\nwould come to have brilliant petals. The germ of this luminous idea,\r\nonce more, is to be found in Sprengel's remarkable work on the\r\nfertilisation of flowers--a work far in advance of its time in many\r\nways, and to which Darwin always expressed his deep obligations; but, as\r\nin so many other instances, while Sprengel looked upon all the little\r\nmodifications and adaptations of flower and insect to one another as the\r\nresult of distinct creative design, Darwin looked upon them as the\r\nresult of natural selection, working upon the basis of indeterminate\r\nspontaneous variations.\r\n\r\nHow do these variations arise? Not by chance, of course (for in the\r\nstrict scientific sense nothing on earth can be considered as really\r\nfortuitous), but as the outcome for the most part of very minute organic\r\ncauses, whose particular action it is impossible for us to predict with\r\nour present knowledge. Some physical cause in each case there must\r\nnecessarily be; and indeed it is often possible to show that certain\r\nchanges of condition in the parent do result in variations in the\r\noffspring, though what special direction the variation will take can\r\nnever be foretold with any accuracy. In short, our ignorance of the laws\r\nof variation is profound, but our knowledge of the fact is clear and\r\ncertain. The fact alone is essential to the principle of natural\r\nselection; the cause, though in itself an interesting subject of\r\ninquiry, may be safely laid aside for the present as comparatively\r\nunimportant. What we have actually given to us in the concrete universe\r\nis, organisms varying perpetually in minute points, and a rapid rate of\r\nincrease causing every minute point of advantage to be exceptionally\r\nfavoured in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nBut Darwin is remarkable among all broachers of new theories for the\r\nextraordinary candour and openness of his method. He acknowledged\r\nbeforehand all the difficulties in the way of his theory, and though he\r\nhimself confessed that some of them were serious (a statement which\r\nsubsequent research has often rendered unnecessary), he met many of them\r\nwith cogent arguments by anticipation, and demolished objections before\r\nthey could even be raised against him by hostile critics. Of these\r\nobjections, only two need here be mentioned. The first is the question,\r\nwhy is not all nature even now a confused mass of transitional forms?\r\nWhy do genera and species exist as we see them at present in broad\r\ndistinction one from the other? To this Darwin answers rightly that,\r\nwhere the process of species-making is still going on, we do actually\r\nfind fine gradations and transitional forms existing between genera,\r\nvarieties, and species.[3] But, furthermore, as natural selection acts\r\nsolely by the preservation of useful modifications, each better-adapted\r\nnew form will always tend in a fully stocked country to oust and\r\nexterminate its own unimproved parent type, as well as all other\r\ncompeting but less perfect varieties. Thus natural selection and\r\nextinction of intermediates go for ever hand in hand. The more perfect\r\nthe new variety, the more absolutely will it kill off the intermediate\r\nforms. The second great difficulty lies in the question of the origin of\r\ninstinct, which, as Darwin shows, by careful inductive instances, may\r\nhave arisen by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous slight yet\r\nprofitable variations.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length upon those portions of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies' which deal in detail with the theory of natural selection, the\r\nchief contribution which Darwin made to the evolutionary movement,\r\nbecause it is impossible otherwise fully to understand the great gulf\r\nwhich separates his evolutionism from the earlier evolutionism of\r\nLamarck and his followers. But it is impracticable here to give any idea\r\nof the immense wealth of example and illustration which Darwin brought\r\nto the elucidation of every part of his complex problem. In order to\r\ngain a full conception of this side of his nature, we must turn to the\r\noriginal treatise itself, and still more to the subsequent volumes in\r\nwhich the ground-work of observations and experiments on which he based\r\nhis theory was more fully detailed for the specialist public.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Darwin's epoch-making work deals, strictly speaking,\r\nrather with the general theory of 'descent with modification' than with\r\nthe special doctrine of natural selection. It restates and reinforces,\r\nby the light of the new additional concept, and with fuller facts and\r\nlater knowledge, the four great arguments already known in favour of\r\norganic evolution as a whole, the argument from Geological Succession,\r\nthe argument from Geographical Distribution, the argument from\r\nEmbryological Development, and the argument from Classificatory\r\nAffinities. Each of these we may briefly summarise.\r\n\r\nThe geological record is confessedly imperfect. At the time when Darwin\r\nfirst published the 'Origin of Species,' it had disclosed to our view\r\ncomparatively few intermediate or transitional forms between the chief\r\ngreat classes of plants or animals; since that time, in singular\r\nconfirmation of the Darwinian hypothesis, it has disclosed an immense\r\nnumber of such connecting types, amongst which may be more particularly\r\nnoticed the 'missing links' between the birds and reptiles, the\r\nancestors of the horses, the camels, and the pigs, and the common\r\nprogenitor of the ruminants and the pachyderms, two great groups classed\r\nby Cuvier as distinct orders--all of which instances were incorporated\r\nby Darwin in later editions of his 'Origin of Species.' But, apart from\r\nthese special and newly discovered cases, the whole general course of\r\ngeological history 'agrees admirably with the theory of descent with\r\nmodification through variation and natural selection.' The simpler\r\nanimals of early times are followed by the more complex and more\r\nspecialised animals of later geological periods. As each main group of\r\nanimals appears upon the stage of life, it appears in a very central and\r\n'generalised' form; as time goes on, we find its various members\r\ndiffering more and more widely from one another, and assuming more and\r\nmore specialised adaptive forms. And in each country it is found, as a\r\nrule, that the extinct animals of the later formations bear a close\r\ngeneral resemblance and relationship to the animals which now inhabit\r\nthe same regions. For example, the fossil mammals from the Australian\r\ncaves are nearly allied to the modern kangaroos, phalangers, and\r\nwombats; and the gigantic extinct sloths and armadillos of South America\r\nare reproduced in their smaller representatives at the present day. So,\r\ntoo, the moa of New Zealand was a huge apteryx; and the birds\r\ndisentombed from the bone-caves of Brazil show close affinities to the\r\ntoucans and jacanars that still scream and flit in countless flocks\r\namong Brazilian forests. The obvious implication is that the animals now\r\ninhabiting any given area are the modified descendants of those that\r\nformerly inhabited it. 'On the theory of descent with modification, the\r\ngreat law of the succession of the same types within the same areas is\r\nat once explained.'\r\n\r\nThis last consideration leads us up to the argument from Geographical\r\nDistribution. In considering the various local faunas and floras on the\r\nface of the globe, no point strikes one more forcibly than the fact that\r\nneither their similarities nor their dissimilarities can be accounted\r\nfor by climate or physical conditions. The animals of South Africa do\r\nnot in the least resemble the animals of the corresponding belt of South\r\nAmerica; the Australian beasts and birds and trees are utterly unlike\r\nthose of France and Germany; the fishes and crustaceans of the Pacific\r\nat Panama are widely different from those of the Caribbean at the same\r\npoint, separated from them only by the narrow belt of intervening\r\nisthmus. On the other hand, within the same continuous areas of sea or\r\nland, however great the differences of physical conditions, we find\r\neverywhere closely related types in possession of the most distinct and\r\nvaried situations. On the burning plains of La Plata we get the agouti\r\nand the bizcacha as the chief rodents; we ascend the Cordillera, and\r\nclose to the eternal snows we discover, not hares and rabbits like those\r\nof Europe, but a specialised chilly mountain form of the same distinctly\r\nSouth American type. We turn to the rivers, and we see no musk-rat or\r\nbeaver, but the coypu and capybara, slightly altered varieties of the\r\noriginal bizcacha ancestor. Australia has no wolf, but it has instead\r\nfierce and active carnivorous marsupials; it has no mice, but some of\r\nits tiny kangaroo-like creatures fulfil analogous functions in its\r\nanimal economy. Everywhere the evidence points to the conclusion that\r\nlocal species have been locally evolved from pre-existing similar\r\nspecies. The oceanic isles, of which Darwin had had so large an\r\nexperience, and especially his old friends the Galapagos, come in\r\nusefully for this stage of the question. They are invariably inhabited,\r\nas Darwin pointed out, and as Wallace has since abundantly shown in the\r\nminutest detail, by waifs and strays from neighbouring continents,\r\naltered and specialised by natural selection in accordance with the\r\nconditions of their new habitat. As a rule, they point back to the\r\ndistricts whence blow the strongest and most prevalent winds; and the\r\nmodifications they have undergone are largely dependent upon the nature\r\nof the other species with which they have to compete, or to whose habits\r\nthey must needs accommodate themselves. In such cases it is easy to see\r\nhow far Darwin's special conception of natural selection helps to\r\nexplain and account for facts not easily explicable by the older\r\nevolutionism of mere descent with modification.\r\n\r\nEmbryology, the study of early development in the individual animal or\r\nplant, also throws much side light upon the nature and ancestry of each\r\nspecies or family. For example, gorse, which is a member of the\r\npea-flower tribe, has in its adult stage solid, spiny, thorn-like\r\nleaves, none of which in the least resemble the foliage of the clover,\r\nto which it is closely related; but the young seedling in its earliest\r\nstages has trefoil leaves, which only slowly pass by infinitesimal\r\ngradations into flat blades and finally into the familiar defensive\r\nprickles. Here, natural selection under stress of herbivorous animals on\r\nopen heaths and commons has spared only those particular gorse-bushes\r\nwhich varied in the direction of the stiffest and most inedible foliage;\r\nbut the young plant in its first days still preserves for us the trefoil\r\nleaf which it shared originally with a vast group of clover-like\r\ncongeners. The adult barnacle, once more, presents a certain fallacious\r\nexternal resemblance to a mollusk, and was actually so classed even by\r\nthe penetrating and systematic intellect of Cuvier; but a glance at the\r\nlarva shows an instructed eye at once that it is really a shell-making\r\nand abnormal crustacean. On a wider scale, the embryos of mammals are at\r\nfirst indistinguishable from those of birds or reptiles; the feet of\r\nlizards, the hoofs of horses, the hands of man, the wings of the bat,\r\nthe pinions of birds, all arise from the same fundamental shapeless bud,\r\nin the same spot of an almost identical embryo. Even the human foetus,\r\nat a certain stage of its development, is provided with gill-slits,\r\nwhich point dimly back to the remote ages when its ancestor was\r\nsomething very like a fish. The embryo is a picture, more or less\r\nobscured and blurred in its outline, of the common progenitor of a whole\r\ngreat class of plants or animals.\r\n\r\nFinally, classification points in the same way to the affiliation of all\r\nexisting genera and species upon certain early divergent ancestors. The\r\nwhole scheme of the biological system, as initiated by Linnæus and\r\nimproved by Cuvier, Jussieu, De Candolle, and their successors, is\r\nessentially that of a genealogical tree. The prime central vertebrate\r\nancestor--to take the case of the creatures most familiar to the general\r\nreader--appears to have been an animal not unlike the existing lancelet,\r\na mud-haunting, cartilaginous, undeveloped fish, whose main lineaments\r\nare also embryologically preserved for us in the ascidian larva and the\r\ncommon tadpole. From this early common centre have been developed,\r\napparently, in one direction the fishes, and in another the amphibian\r\ntribes of frogs, newts, salamanders, and axolotls. From an early\r\namphibian, again, the common ancestor of birds, reptiles, and mammals\r\nseems to have diverged: the intermediate links between bird and reptile\r\nbeing faintly traced among the extinct deinosaurians and the\r\narchæopteryx, some years subsequently to the first appearance of the\r\n'Origin of Species;' while the ornithorhynchus, which to some extent\r\nconnects the mammals, and especially the marsupials, with the lower\r\negg-laying types of vertebrate, was already well-known and thoroughly\r\nstudied before the publication of Darwin's great work. Throughout, the\r\nindications given by all the chief tribes of animals and plants point\r\nback to slow descent and divergence from common ancestors; and all the\r\nsubsequent course of palæontological research has supplied us rapidly,\r\none after another, with the remains of just such undifferentiated\r\nfamily starting-points.\r\n\r\nStress has mainly been laid, in this brief and necessarily imperfect\r\nabstract, on the essentially Darwinian principle of natural selection.\r\nBut Darwin did not himself attribute everything to this potent factor in\r\nthe moulding of species. 'I am convinced,' he wrote pointedly in the\r\nintroduction to his first edition, 'that natural selection has been the\r\nmain but not the exclusive means of modification.' He attributed\r\nconsiderable importance as well to the Lamarckian principle of use and\r\ndisuse, already so fully insisted upon before him by Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer. The chief factors in his compound theory, as given in his own\r\nwords at the end of his work, areas follows: 'Growth with Reproduction;\r\nInheritance, which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability, from\r\nthe indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use\r\nand disuse; a Ratio of Increase, so high as to lead to a Struggle for\r\nLife, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of\r\nCharacter, and the Extinction of the less improved forms. Thus, from the\r\nwar of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we\r\nare capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals,\r\ndirectly follows.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the simple and inoffensive-looking bombshell which Darwin\r\nlaunched from his quiet home at Down into the very midst of the\r\nteleological camp in the peaceful year 1859. Subsequent generations will\r\nremember the date as a crisis and turning-point in the history of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The remainder of the present chapter, which consists almost entirely\r\nof an exposition of the doctrine of natural selection, may safely be\r\nskipped by the reader already well acquainted with the Origin of\r\nSpecies. The abstract is taken for the most part from the latest and\r\nfullest enlarged edition, but attention is usually called in passing to\r\nthe points which did not appear in the first issue of 1859.\r\n\r\n[3] The researches of Seebohm and others have since proved that this is\r\nreally the case to a far greater extent than Darwin was aware of in\r\n1859, or, indeed, till many years afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION BEGINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as the scientific world was concerned the 'Origin of Species'\r\nfell, like a grain of mustard seed, upon good and well-prepared ground;\r\nthe plant that sprang from it grew up forthwith into a great and stately\r\ntree, that overshadowed with its spreading branches all the corners of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe soil, indeed, had been carefully broken for it beforehand: Lamarck\r\nand St. Hilaire, Spencer and Chambers, had ploughed and harrowed in all\r\ndiligence; and the minds of men were thoroughly ready for the\r\nassimilation of the new doctrine. But the seed itself, too, was the\r\nright germ for the exact moment; it contained within itself the\r\nvivifying principle that enabled it to grow and wax exceeding great\r\nwhere kindred germs before had withered away, or had borne but scanty\r\nand immature fruit.\r\n\r\nTwo conditions contributed to this result, one external, the other\r\ninternal.\r\n\r\nFirst for the less important external consideration. Darwin himself was\r\na sound man with an established reputation for solidity and learning.\r\nThat gained for his theory from the very first outset universal respect\r\nand a fair hearing. Herbert Spencer was known to be a philosopher: and\r\nthe practical English nation mistrusts philosophers: those people probe\r\ntoo deep and soar too high for any sensible person to follow them in all\r\ntheir flights. Robert Chambers, the unknown author of 'Vestiges of\r\nCreation,' was a shallow sciolist; it was whispered abroad that he was\r\neven inaccurate and slovenly in his facts: and your scientific plodder\r\ndetests the very shadow of minute inaccuracy, though it speak with the\r\ntongues of men and angels, and be bound up with all the grasp and power\r\nof a Newton or a Goethe. But Charles Darwin was a known personage, an\r\nF.R.S., a distinguished authority upon coral reefs and barnacles, a\r\ngreat geologist, a great biologist, a great observer and indefatigable\r\ncollector. His book came into the public hands stamped with the\r\nimprimatur of official recognition. Darwin was the father of the infant\r\ntheory; Lyell and Hooker stood for its sponsors. The world could not\r\nafford to despise its contents; they could not brand its author offhand\r\nas a clever dreamer or a foolish amateur, or consign him to the dreaded\r\nEnglish limbo of the 'mere theorist.'\r\n\r\nNext, for the other and far more important internal consideration. The\r\nbook itself was one of the greatest, the most learned, the most lucid,\r\nthe most logical, the most crushing, the most conclusive, that the world\r\nhad ever yet seen. Step by step, and principle by principle, it proved\r\nevery point in its progress triumphantly before it went on to\r\ndemonstrate the next. So vast an array of facts so thoroughly in hand\r\nhad never before been mustered and marshalled in favour of any\r\nbiological theory. Those who had insight to learn and understand were\r\nconvinced at once by the cogency of the argument; those who had not were\r\noverpowered and silenced by the weight of the authority and the mass of\r\nthe learning. A hot battle burst forth at once, no doubt, around the\r\nsuccessful volume; but it was one of those battles which are aroused\r\nonly by great truths,--a battle in which the victory is a foregone\r\nconclusion, and the rancour of the assailants the highest compliment to\r\nthe prowess of the assailed.\r\n\r\nDarwin himself, in his quiet country home at Down, was simply astonished\r\nat the rapid success of his own work. The first edition was published at\r\nthe end of November 1859; it was exhausted almost immediately, and a\r\nsecond was got ready in hot haste by the beginning of January 1860. In\r\nless than six weeks the book had become famous, and Darwin found himself\r\nthe centre of a European contest, waged with exceeding bitterness, over\r\nthe truth or falsity of his wonderful volume. To the world at large\r\nDarwinism and evolution became at once synonymous terms. The same people\r\nwho would entirely ascribe the Protestant Reformation to the account of\r\nLuther, and the inductive philosophy to the account of Bacon, also\r\nbelieved, in the simplicity of their hearts, that the whole vast\r\nevolutionary movement was due at bottom to that very insidious and\r\ndangerous book of Mr. Darwin's.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, profound as had been the impulses in the evolutionary\r\ndirection among men of science before Darwin's work appeared at all,\r\nimmense as were the throes and pangs of labour throughout all Europe\r\nwhich preceded and accompanied its actual birth, when it came at last it\r\ncame to the general world of unscientific readers with all the sudden\r\nvividness and novelty of a tremendous earthquake. Long predestined, it\r\nwas yet wholly unexpected. Men at large had known nothing or next to\r\nnothing of this colossal but hidden revolutionary force which had been\r\ngathering head and energy for so many years unseen within the bowels of\r\nthe earth; and now that its outer manifestation had actually burst upon\r\nthem, they felt the solid ground of dogmatic security bodily giving way\r\nbeneath their feet, and knew not where to turn in their extremity for\r\nsupport. Naturally, it was the theological interest that felt itself at\r\nfirst most forcibly assailed. The first few chapters of Genesis, or\r\nrather the belief in their scientific and historical character, already\r\nsapped by the revelations of geology, seemed to orthodox defenders to be\r\nfatally undermined if the Darwinian hypothesis were once to meet with\r\ngeneral recognition. The first resource of menaced orthodoxy is always\r\nto deny the alleged facts; the second is to patch up tardily the feeble\r\nand hollow _modus vivendi_ of an artificial pact. On this occasion the\r\northodox acted strictly after their kind: but to their credit it should\r\nbe added that they yielded gracefully in the long run to the unanimous\r\nvoice of scientific opinion. Twenty-three years later, when all that was\r\nmortal of Charles Darwin was being borne with pomp and pageantry to its\r\nlast resting-place in Westminster Abbey, enlightened orthodoxy, with\r\ngenerous oblivion, ratified a truce over the dead body of the great\r\nleader, and, outgrowing its original dread of naturalistic\r\ninterpretations, accepted his theory without reserve as 'not necessarily\r\nhostile to the main fundamental truths of religion.' Let us render\r\njustice to the vanquished in a memorable struggle. Churchmen followed\r\nrespectfully to the grave with frank and noble inconsistency the\r\nhonoured remains of the very teacher whom less than a quarter of a\r\ncentury earlier they had naturally dreaded as loosening the traditional\r\nfoundations of all accepted religion and morality.\r\n\r\nBut if the attack was fierce and bitter, the defence was assisted by a\r\nsudden access of powerful forces from friendly quarters. A few of the\r\nelder generation of naturalists held out, indeed, for various shorter or\r\nlonger periods; some of them never came into the camp at all, but\r\nlingered on, left behind, like stragglers from the onward march, by the\r\nyounger biologists, in isolated non-conformity on the lonely heights of\r\naustere officialism. Their business was to ticket and docket and\r\npigeon-hole, not to venture abroad on untried wings into the airy\r\nregions of philosophical speculation. The elder men, in fact, had many\r\nof them lost that elasticity and modifiability of intellect which is\r\nnecessary for the reception of new and revolutionary fundamental\r\nconcepts. A mind that has hardened down into the last stage of extreme\r\nmaturity may assimilate fresh facts and fresh minor principles, but it\r\ncannot assimilate fresh synthetic systems of the entire cosmos.\r\nMoreover, some of the elder thinkers were committed beforehand to\r\nopposing views, with which they lacked either the courage or the\r\nintellectual power to break; while others were entangled by religious\r\nrestrictions, and unable to free themselves from the cramping fetters of\r\na narrow orthodoxy. But even among his own contemporaries and seniors\r\nDarwin found not a few whose minds were thoroughly prepared beforehand\r\nfor the reception of his lucid and luminous hypothesis; while the\r\nyounger naturalists, with the plasticity of youth, assimilated almost\r\nto a man, with the utmost avidity, the great truths thus showered down\r\nupon them by the preacher of evolution.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker and Professor Huxley were among the first to give in\r\ntheir adhesion and stand up boldly for the new truth by the side of the\r\nreckless and disturbing innovator. In June 1859, nearly a year after the\r\nreading of the Darwin-Wallace papers at the Linnean Society, but five\r\nmonths previously to the publication of the 'Origin of Species,' Huxley\r\nlectured at the Royal Institution on 'Persistent Types of Animal Life,'\r\nand declared against the old barren theory of successive creations, in\r\nfavour of the new and fruitful hypothesis of gradual modification. In\r\nDecember 1859, a month later than the appearance of Darwin's book,\r\nHooker published his 'Introduction to the Flora of Australia,' in the\r\nfirst part of which he championed the belief in the descent and\r\nmodification of species, and enforced his views by many original\r\nobservations drawn from the domain of botanical science. For fifteen\r\nyears, as Darwin himself gratefully observed in his introduction to the\r\n'Origin of Species,' that learned botanist had shared the secret of\r\nnatural selection, and aided its author in every possible way by his\r\nlarge stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment. Bates, the\r\nnaturalist on the Amazons, followed fast with his beautiful and striking\r\ntheory of mimicry, a crucial instance well explained. The facts of the\r\nstrange disguises which birds and insects often assume had long been\r\npresent to his acute mind, and he hailed with delight the discovery of\r\nthe new principle, which at once enabled him to reduce them with ease\r\nto symmetry and order. To Herbert Spencer, an evolutionist in fibre from\r\nthe very beginning, the fresh doctrine of natural selection came like a\r\npowerful ally and an unexpected assistant in deciphering the deep\r\nfundamental problems on which he was at that moment actually engaged;\r\nand in his 'Principles of Biology,' even then in contemplation, he at\r\nonce adopted and utilised the new truth with all the keen and vigorous\r\ninsight of his profound analytic and synthetic intellect. The first part\r\nof that important work was issued to subscribers just three years after\r\nthe original appearance of the 'Origin of Species;' the first volume was\r\nfully completed in October 1864. It is to Mr. Spencer that we owe the\r\npellucid expression 'survival of the fittest,' which conveys even better\r\nthan Darwin's own phrase, 'natural selection,' the essential element\r\nadded by the 'Origin of Species' to the pre-existing evolutionary\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nThe British Association for the Advancement of Science held its big\r\nannual doctrinaire picnic the next summer after the publication of\r\nDarwin's book, at Oxford. The Oxford meeting was a stormy and a\r\nwell-remembered one. The 'Origin of Species' was there discussed and\r\nattacked before a biological section strangely enough presided over by\r\nDarwin's old Cambridge teacher, Professor Henslow. Though then a\r\nbeneficed parish priest, Henslow had the boldness frankly to avow his\r\nown acceptance of his great pupil's startling conclusions. Huxley\r\nfollowed in the same path, as did also Lubbock and Hooker. On the whole,\r\nthe evolutionists were already in the ascendant; the fresh young\r\nintellects especially being quick to seize upon the new pabulum so\r\ngenerously dealt out to them by the new evolutionism.\r\n\r\nAmong scientific minds of the first order, Lyell alone in England,\r\nheavily weighted by theological preconceptions, for awhile hung back.\r\nAll his life long, as his letters show us, the great geologist had felt\r\nthe powerful spell of the Lamarckian hypothesis continually enticing him\r\nwith its seductive charm. He had fought against it blindly, in the\r\npassionate endeavour to preserve what he thought his higher faith in the\r\nseparate and divine creation of man; but ever and anon he returned anew\r\nto the biological Circe with a fresh fascination, as the moth returns to\r\nthe beautiful flame that has scorched and singed it. In a well-known\r\npassage in the earlier editions of his 'Principles of Geology,' the\r\nfather of uniformitarianism gives at length his own reasons for\r\ndissenting from the doctrine of evolution as then set forth; and even\r\nafter Darwin's discovery had supplied him with a new clue, a _vera\r\ncausa_, a sufficient power for the modification of species into fresh\r\nforms, theological difficulties made him cling still as long as possible\r\nto the old theory of the origin of man which he loved to describe as\r\nthat of the 'archangel ruined.' He was loth to exchange this cherished\r\nbelief for the degrading alternative (as it approved itself to him) of\r\nthe ape elevated. But in the end, with the fearless honesty of a\r\nsearcher after truth, he gave way slowly and regretfully. Always looking\r\nback with something like remorse to the flesh-pots of the ecclesiastical\r\nEgypt, with its enticing visions of fallen grandeur, the great thinker\r\nwhose uniformitarian theory of geology had more than aught else paved\r\nthe way for the gradual acceptance of Darwin's evolutionism, came out\r\nat last from the house of bondage, and nobly ranged himself on the side\r\nof what his intellect judged to be the truth of nature, though his\r\nemotions urged him hard to blind his judgment and to neglect its lights\r\nfor an emotional figment. Science has no more pathetic figure than that\r\nof the old philosopher, in his sixty-sixth year, throwing himself with\r\nall the eagerness of youth into what he had long considered the wrong\r\nscale, and vigorously wrecking in the 'Antiquity of Man' what seemed to\r\nthe dimmed vision of his own emotional nature the very foundations of\r\nhis beloved creed. But still he did it. He came out and was separate. In\r\nhis own idiomatic language, he found at last that 'we must go the whole\r\nourang;' and, deep as was the pang that the recantation cost him, he\r\nformally retracted the condemnation of 'transformism' in his earlier\r\nworks, and accepted, however unwillingly, the theory he had so often and\r\nso deliberately rejected.\r\n\r\nThe 'Antiquity of Man' came out in February 1863, some three years after\r\nthe 'Origin of Species.' For some time speculation had been active over\r\nthe strange hatchets which Boucher de Perthes had recently unearthed\r\namong the Abbeville drift--shapeless masses of chipped flint rudely\r\nfashioned into the form of an axe, which we now call palæolithic\r\nimplements, and know to be the handicraft of preglacial men. But until\r\nLyell's authoritative work appeared the unscientific public could not\r\ntell exactly what to think of these curious and almost unhuman-looking\r\nobjects. Lyell at once set all doubts at rest; the magic of his name\r\nsilenced the derisive whispers of the dissidents. Already, in the\r\nprevious year, the first fasciculus of Colenso's famous work on the\r\nPentateuch had dealt a serious blow from the ecclesiastical and critical\r\nside at the authenticity and historical truth of the Mosaic cosmogony.\r\nLyell now from the scientific side completely demolished its literal\r\ntruth, as ordinarily interpreted, by throwing back the primitive origin\r\nof our race into a dim past of immeasurable antiquity. In so doing he\r\nwas clearing the way for Charles Darwin's second great work, 'The\r\nDescent of Man;' and by incorporating in his book Huxley's remarks on\r\nthe Neanderthal skull, and much similar evolutionary matter, he\r\nadvertised the new creed in the animal origin of our race with all the\r\nacquired weight of his immense and justly-deserved European reputation.\r\nAs a matter of taste, Lyell did not relish the application of\r\nevolutionism to his own species. But, with that perfect loyalty to fact\r\nwhich he shared so completely with Charles Darwin, as soon as he found\r\nthe evidence overwhelming, he gave in. By that grudging concession he\r\nimmensely strengthened the position of the new creed. 'I plead guilty,'\r\nhe writes to Sir Joseph Hooker, 'to going farther in my reasoning\r\ntowards transmutation than in my sentiments and imagination, and perhaps\r\nfor that very reason I shall lead more people on to Darwin and you, than\r\none who, being born later, like Lubbock, has comparatively little to\r\nabandon of old and long-cherished ideas, which constituted the charm to\r\nme of the theoretical part of the science in my earlier days.' And to\r\nDarwin himself he writes regretfully. 'The descent of man from the\r\nbrutes takes away much of the charm from my speculations on the past\r\nrelating to such matters.' This very reluctance itself told powerfully\r\nin favour of Charles Darwin's novel theories: there is no evidence more\r\nvaluable to a cause than that which it extorts by moral force, in spite\r\nof himself, from the faltering lips of an unwilling witness.\r\n\r\nThe same year that saw the publication of Lyell's 'Antiquity of Man' saw\r\nalso the first appearance of Huxley's work on 'Man's Place in Nature.'\r\nDarwin himself had been anxious rather than otherwise to avoid too close\r\nreference to the implications of his theory as regards the origin and\r\ndestiny of the human race. He had desired that his strictly scientific\r\nviews on the rise of specific distinctions should be judged entirely on\r\ntheir own merits, unhampered by the interference of real or supposed\r\ntheological and ethical considerations. His own language on all such\r\nsubjects, wherever he was compelled to trench on them in the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies,' was guarded and conciliatory; he scarcely referred at all to\r\nman or his history; and his occasional notices of the moving principle\r\nand first cause of the entire cosmos were reverential and religious in\r\nthe truest sense and in the highest degree. But you cannot let loose a\r\nmoral whirlwind, and then attempt to direct its course; you cannot open\r\nthe floodgates of opinion or of speculation, and then pretend to set\r\nlimits to the scope of their restless motion. Darwin soon found out that\r\npeople would insist in drawing inferences beyond what was written, and\r\nin seeing implicit conclusions when they were not definitely formulated\r\nin the words of their author. 'Man is perennially interesting to man,'\r\nsays the great chaotic American thinker; and whatever all-embracing\r\ntruth you set before him, you may be sure that man will see in it\r\nchiefly the implications that most closely affect his own happiness and\r\nhis own destiny. The biological question of the origin of species is a\r\nsufficiently wide one, but it includes also, among other cases, the\r\norigin of the very familiar species _Homo sapiens_ of Linnæus. Some\r\ntheologians jumped at once at the conclusion, right or wrong, that if\r\nDarwinism were true man was nothing more than a developed monkey, the\r\nimmortal soul was an exploded myth, the foundations of religion itself\r\nwere shattered, and the wave of infidelity was doomed to swamp the whole\r\nof Christendom with its blank nihilism. Scientific men, on the other\r\nhand, drew the conclusion that man must be descended, like other\r\nmammals, from some common early vertebrate ancestor, and that the\r\ncurrent views of his origin and destiny must be largely modified by the\r\nevolutionary creed. Of this profound scientific belief Professor\r\nHuxley's maiden work was the earliest outcome.\r\n\r\nMeantime, on the continent of Europe and over-sea in America, the\r\nDarwinian theory was being hotly debated and warmly defended. France,\r\ncoldly sceptical and critical, positive rather than imaginative in\r\nmatters of science, and little prone by native cast of mind to the\r\nevolutionary attitude, stood aloof to a great extent from the onward\r\ncourse of the general movement. Here and there, to be sure, a Gaudry or\r\na Ribot, a Delboeuf or a De Candolle (the two latter a Liège Belgian and\r\na Genevan Swiss) might heartily throw himself into the new ideas, and\r\ncontribute whole squadrons of geological or botanical fact to the final\r\nvictory. Yet, as a whole, the dry and cautious French intelligence, ever\r\ninclined to a scientific opportunism, preferred for the moment to stand\r\nby expectant and await the result of the European consensus. But\r\nphilosophical Germany, on the other hand, beaming enthusiasm from its\r\nmyriad spectacles, eagerly welcomed the novel ideas, and proclaimed from\r\nthe housetops the evolutionary faith as a main plank in the rising\r\nplatform of the newly-roused Kulturkampf. Fritz Müller began with all\r\nthe ardour of a fresh convert to collect his admirable 'Facts for\r\nDarwin;' his brother Hermann sat down with indomitable patience, like\r\nthe master's own, to watch the ceaseless action of the bees and\r\nbutterflies in the fertilisation of flowers. Rütimeyer applied the\r\nDarwinian principles to the explanation of mammalian relationships, and\r\nHaeckel set to work upon his vast reconstructive 'History of Creation,'\r\na largely speculative work which, with all its faults, distinctly\r\ncarried forward the evolutionary impulse, and set fresh researchers\r\nworking upon new lines, to confirm or to disprove its audacious\r\nimaginings. In America, Asa Gray gave to the young creed the high\r\nauthority of his well-known name, and Chauncey Wright helped it onward\r\non the road with all the restrained force of his singular and oblique\r\nbut powerful and original personality. If Agassiz and Dawson still\r\nhesitated, Fiske and Youmans were ardent in the faith. If critical\r\nBoston put up its eye-glass doubtfully, Chicago and St. Louis were ready\r\nfor conversion. Everywhere Darwin and Darwinism became as household\r\nwords; it was the singular fate of the great prophet of evolution, alone\r\nalmost among the sons of men, to hear his own name familiarly twisted\r\nduring his own lifetime into a colloquial adjective, and to see the\r\nDarwinian theory and the errors of Darwinism staring him in the face a\r\nhundred times a day from every newspaper and every periodical.\r\n\r\nOf course the 'Origin of Species' was largely translated at once into\r\nall the civilised languages of Europe, Russian as well as French, Dutch\r\nas well as German, Swedish as well as Italian, Spanish as well as\r\nHungarian, nay even, at last, transcending narrow continental limits,\r\nJapanese as well as Hindustani. The revolution which it was rapidly\r\neffecting was indeed a revolution in every mode of thought and feeling\r\nas well as a revolution in mere restricted biological opinion. But all\r\nthis time, the modest, single-minded, and unassuming author was working\r\nunmoved among his plants and pigeons in his home at Down, regardless of\r\nthe European fame he was so quickly acquiring, and anxious only to bring\r\nto a termination the vast work which he still contemplated. A little\r\nmore than eleven years intervened between the publication of the 'Origin\r\nof Species,' in 1859, and the first appearance of the 'Descent of Man,'\r\nin 1871. The interval was occupied in carrying out in part the gigantic\r\nscheme of his original collections for the full treatment of the\r\ndevelopment theory. The work published in 1859 Darwin regarded merely as\r\nan abstract and preliminary outline of his full opinions: 'No one can\r\nfeel more sensible than I do,' he wrote, 'of the necessity of hereafter\r\npublishing in detail all the facts, with references, on which my\r\nconclusions have been grounded.' The marvellously learned work on the\r\n'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,' which came out in\r\ntwo volumes in 1867, formed the first instalment of this long-projected\r\ntreatise. The second part, as he told Mr. Fiske, was to have treated of\r\nthe variation of animals and plants through natural selection; while the\r\nthird part would have dealt at length with the phenomena of morphology,\r\nof classification, and of distribution in space and time. But these\r\nlatter portions of the work were never written. To say the truth, they\r\nwere never needed. So universal was the recognition among the younger\r\nmen of Darwin's discovery, that before ten years were over innumerable\r\nworkers were pushing out the consequences of natural selection into\r\nevery field of biology and palæontology. It seemed no longer so\r\nnecessary as it had once seemed to write the larger and more elaborate\r\ntreatise he had originally contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe volume on the variation of animals and plants contained also\r\nDarwin's one solitary contribution to the pure speculative philosophy of\r\nlife--his 'Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis,' by which he strove to\r\naccount on philosophical principles for the general facts of physical\r\nand mental heredity. Not to mince matters, it was his one conspicuous\r\nfailure, and is now pretty universally admitted as such. Let not the\r\nlove of the biographer deceive us; Darwin was here attempting a task\r\n_ultra vires_. As already observed, his mind, vast as it was, leaned\r\nrather to the concrete than to the abstract side: he lacked the\r\ndistinctively metaphysical and speculative twist. Strange to say, too,\r\nhis abortive theory appeared some years later than Herbert Spencer's\r\nmagnificent all-sided conception of 'Physiological Units,' put forth\r\nexpressly to meet the self-same difficulty. But while Darwin's\r\nhypothesis is rudely materialistic, Herbert Spencer's is built up by an\r\nacute and subtle analytical perception of all the analogous facts in\r\nuniversal nature. It is a singular instance of a crude and essentially\r\nunphilosophic conception endeavouring to replace a finished and delicate\r\nphilosophical idea.\r\n\r\nEarlier still, in 1862, Darwin had published his wonderful and\r\nfascinating book on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids.' It is delightful to\r\ncontemplate the picture of the unruffled naturalist, in the midst of\r\nthat universal storm of ecclesiastical obloquy and scientific enthusiasm\r\nwhich he had roused throughout Europe, sitting down calmly in his\r\nKentish conservatory to watch the behaviour of catasetums and\r\nmasdevallias, and to work out the details of his chosen subject, with\r\nthat marvellous patience of which he was so great a master, in the\r\npettiest minutiæ of fertilisation as displayed by a single highly\r\ndeveloped family of plants. Whoever wishes to learn the full profundity\r\nof Darwin's researches, into every point that he set himself to\r\ninvestigate, cannot do better than turn for a while to the consideration\r\nof that exquisite treatise on one of the quaintest fairylands of\r\nscience. He will there learn by what an extraordinary wealth of cunning\r\ndevices natural selection has ensured the due conveyance of the\r\nfecundating pollen from stamens to stigmas within the limits of a single\r\ngroup of vegetable organisms. Here the fertilising mass is gummed\r\nautomatically between the eyes of the exploring bee, and then bent round\r\nby the drying of its stalk so as to come in contact with the stigmatic\r\nsurface. There the pollen club is jerked out elastically by a sensitive\r\nfibre, and actually flung by its irritable antennæ at the unconscious\r\nhead of the fertilising insect. In one case, the lip of the flower\r\nsecretes moisture and forms a sort of cold bath, which wets the wings of\r\nthe bees, so compelling them to creep out of the bucket by a passage\r\nclose to the anthers and stigma; in another case, the honey is concealed\r\nat the bottom of so long a tube that only the proper fertilising moth\r\nwith a proboscis of ten or eleven inches in length can probe the deep\r\nrecess in which it is hidden. These, and a hundred other similar\r\ninstances, were all carefully considered and described by the great\r\nnaturalist as the by-work with which he filled up one of the intervals\r\nbetween his greater and more comprehensive treatises.\r\n\r\nIn the decade between 1860 and 1870 the progress of Darwinism was rapid\r\nand continuous. One by one, the few scientific men who still held out\r\nwere overborne by the weight of evidence. Geology kept supplying fresh\r\ninstances of transitional forms; the progress of research in unexplored\r\ncountries kept adding to our knowledge of existing intermediate species\r\nand varieties. During those ten years, Herbert Spencer published his\r\n'First Principles,' his 'Biology,' and the remodelled form of his\r\n'Psychology;' Huxley brought out 'Man's Place in Nature,' the 'Lectures\r\non Comparative Anatomy,' and the 'Introduction to the Classification of\r\nAnimals;' Wallace produced his 'Malay Archipelago' and his\r\n'Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection;' and Galton wrote his\r\nadmirable work on 'Hereditary Genius,' of which his own family is so\r\nremarkable an instance. Tyndall and Lewes had long since signified their\r\nwarm adhesion. At Oxford, Rolleston was bringing up a fresh generation\r\nof young biologists in the new faith; at Cambridge, Darwin's old\r\nuniversity, a whole school of brilliant and accurate physiologists was\r\nbeginning to make itself both felt and heard in the world of science. In\r\nthe domain of anthropology, Tylor was welcoming the assistance of the\r\nnew ideas, while Lubbock was engaged on his kindred investigations into\r\nthe Origin of Civilisation and the Primitive Condition of Man. All these\r\ndiverse lines of thought both showed the wide-spread influence of\r\nDarwin's first great work, and led up to the preparation of his second,\r\nin which he dealt with the history and development of the human race.\r\nAnd what was thus true of England was equally true of the civilised\r\nworld, regarded as a whole: everywhere the great evolutionary movement\r\nwas well in progress; everywhere the impulse sent forth from that quiet\r\nKentish home was permeating and quickening the entire pulse of\r\nintelligent humanity.\r\n\r\nWhy was it that the 'Origin of Species' possessed this extraordinary\r\nvitalising and kinetic power, this germinal energy, this contagious\r\nforce, beyond all other forms of evolutionism previously promulgated?\r\nWhy did the world, that listened so coldly to Lamarck and Chambers, turn\r\nso ready an ear to Charles Darwin and natural selection? Partly, no\r\ndoubt, because in the fulness of time the moment had come and the\r\nprophet had arisen. All great movements are long brewing, and burst out\r\nat last (like the Reformation and the French Revolution) with explosive\r\nenergy. But the cause is largely to be found, also, I believe, in the\r\npeculiar nature of the Darwinian solution. True, a thoroughly logical\r\nmind, a mind of the very highest order, would have said even before\r\nDarwin, 'Creation can have no possible place in the physical series of\r\nthings at all. How organisms came to be I do not yet exactly see; but I\r\nam sure they must have come to be by some merely physical process, if we\r\ncould only find it out.' And such minds were all actually evolutionary\r\neven before Darwin had made the _modus operandi_ of evolution\r\nintelligible. But most people are not so clear-sighted. They require to\r\nhave everything proved to them by the strictest collocation of actual\r\ninstances. They will not believe unless one rise from the dead. There\r\nare men who rejected the raw doctrine of special creation on evidence\r\nadduced; and there are men who never even for a moment entertained it as\r\nconceivable. The former compose the mass of the scientific world, and it\r\nwas for their conversion that the Darwinian hypothesis was so highly\r\nsalutary. As Professor Fiske rightly remarks, 'The truth is that before\r\nthe publication of the \"Origin of Species\" there was no opinion whatever\r\ncurrent respecting the subject that deserved to be called a scientific\r\nhypothesis. That the more complex forms of life must have come into\r\nexistence through some process of development from simpler forms was no\r\ndoubt the only sensible and rational view to take of the subject; but in\r\na vague and general opinion of this sort there is nothing that is\r\nproperly scientific. A scientific hypothesis must connect the phenomena\r\nwith which it deals by alleging a \"true cause;\" and before 1859 no one\r\nhad suggested a \"true cause\" for the origination of new species,\r\nalthough the problem was one over which every philosophical naturalist\r\nhad puzzled since the beginning of the century. This explains why Mr.\r\nDarwin's success was so rapid and complete, and it also explains why he\r\ncame so near being anticipated.' To put it briefly, _a priori_, creation\r\nis from the very first unbelievable; but, as a matter of evidence,\r\nLamarck failed to make evolution comprehensible, or to give a rationale\r\nof its mode of action, while Darwin's theory of natural selection\r\nsucceeded in doing so for those who awaited _a posteriori_ proof. Hence\r\nDarwin was able to convert the world, where Lamarck had only been able\r\nto stir up enquiry among the picked spirits of the scientific and\r\nphilosophical coterie. Therein lies the true secret of his rapid, his\r\nbrilliant, and his triumphant progress. He had found out not only _that_\r\nit was so, but _how_ it was so, too. In Aristotelian phrase, he had\r\ndiscovered the _πῶς_ as well as the _ὅτι_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1871, nearly twelve years after the 'Origin of Species,' Darwin\r\npublished his 'Descent of Man.'\r\n\r\nWe have seen already that he would fain have avoided the treatment of\r\nthis difficult and dangerous topic a little longer, so as to let his\r\nmain theory be fairly judged on its own merits, without the obtrusion of\r\ntheological or personal feelings into so purely biological a question;\r\nbut the current was too strong for him, and at last he yielded. On the\r\none hand, the adversaries had drawn for themselves the conclusion of\r\nman's purely animal origin, and held it up to ridicule under false forms\r\nin the most absurd and odious light. On the other hand, imprudent allies\r\nhad put forth under the evolutionary ægis their somewhat hypothetical\r\nand extravagant speculations on this involved subject, which Darwin was\r\nnaturally anxious to correct and modify by his own more sober and\r\nguarded inferences. The result was the second great finishing work of\r\nthe complete Darwinian system of things.\r\n\r\nEver since evolutionism had begun to be at all it had been observed that\r\na natural corollary from the doctrine of descent with modification was\r\nthe belief in man's common ancestry with the anthropoid apes. As early\r\nas the middle of the last century, indeed, Lord Monboddo, a whimsical\r\nScotch eccentric, had suggested in his famous book on the origin of\r\nlanguage the idea that men were merely developed monkeys. But this crude\r\nand unorganised statement of a great truth, being ultimately based upon\r\nno distinct physical grounds, deserved scarcely to be classed higher\r\nthan the childish evolutionism of 'Telliamed' De Maillet, which makes\r\nbirds descend from flying-fish and men the offspring of the hypothetical\r\ntritons. On this point as on most others the earliest definite\r\nscientific views are those of Buffon, who ventured to hint with extreme\r\ncaution the possibility of a common ancestry for man and all other\r\nvertebrate animals. Goethe the all-sided had caught a passing glimpse of\r\nthe same profound conception about the date of the Reign of Terror; and\r\nErasmus Darwin had openly announced it, though without much elaboration,\r\nin his precocious and premature 'Zoonomia.' Still more specifically, in\r\na note to the 'Temple of Nature,' the English evolutionist says: 'It has\r\nbeen supposed by some that mankind were formerly quadrupeds.... These\r\nphilosophers, with Buffon and Helvetius, seem to imagine that mankind\r\narose from one family of monkeys on the banks of the Mediterranean;' and\r\nin the third canto of that fantastic poem, he enlarges upon the great\r\npart performed by the hand, with its opposable thumb, in the development\r\nand progress of the human species. Lamarck, in his 'Philosophie\r\nZoologique,' distinctly lays down the doctrine that man is descended\r\nfrom an ape-like ancestor, which gradually acquired the upright\r\nposition, not even now wholly natural to the human race, and maintained\r\nonly by the most constant watchfulness. The orang-outang was then the\r\nhighest known anthropoid ape; and it was from the orang-outang,\r\ntherefore, that the fancy of Lyell and other objectors in the\r\npre-Darwinian days continually derived the Lamarckian Adam.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the chimpanzee into our European Zoological Gardens\r\ngave a fresh type of anthropoid to the crude speculators of the middle\r\ndecades of the century; and in 1859, Paul du Chaillu, the explorer and\r\nhunter of the Gaboon country, brought over to America and Europe the\r\nfirst specimens of the true gorilla ever seen by civilised men. There\r\ncan be little doubt that the general interest excited by his narrative\r\nof his adventures (published in London in 1861) and by the well-known\r\nstuffed specimen of the huge African anthropoid ape so long conspicuous\r\nin the rooms of the British Museum, and now surviving (somewhat the\r\nworse for wear) in the natural history collection at South Kensington,\r\ndid much to kindle public curiosity as to the nature of our relations\r\nwith the lower animals. It is no mere accidental circumstance, indeed,\r\nthat Huxley should have brought out 'Man's Place in Nature' just two\r\nyears after Du Chaillu's 'Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial\r\nAfrica' had made the whole world, lay and learned, familiar with the\r\nname and features of the most human in outer aspect among the anthropoid\r\nfamily. Thenceforth the gorilla, and not the orang-outang, was popularly\r\nhit upon by scoffer and caricaturist as the imaginary type of our\r\nprimitive ancestors.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, during the twelve intervening years immense strides\r\nhad been made in every department of anthropological science, and the\r\nwhole tenor of modern speculation had been clearing the ground for the\r\n'Descent of Man,' In 1865, Rolle in Germany had published his work on\r\n'Man Viewed by the Light of the Darwinian Theory.' Two years later,\r\nCanestrini in Italy read before the Naturalists' Society of Modena his\r\ninteresting paper on rudimentary characters as bearing on the origin of\r\nthe human species. In 1868, Büchner brought out his rudely materialistic\r\nsledge-hammer lectures on the Darwinian principle; and in 1869, Barrago\r\nflung straight at the head of the Roman clericals his offensive work on\r\nman and the anthropoid apes. Most of these foreign publications were\r\nunhappily marked by that coarse and almost vituperative opposition to\r\nreceived views which too often disfigures French and German\r\ncontroversial literature. In England, on the contrary, under our milder\r\nand gentler ecclesiastical yoke, the contest had been conducted with\r\ngreater decorum and with far better results. Wallace had broken ground\r\ntentatively and reverently in his essay on the 'Origin of Human Races,'\r\nwhere he endeavoured to show that man is the co-descendant with the\r\nanthropoid apes of some ancient lower and extinct form. Lubbock's\r\n'Prehistoric Times' (1865) and 'Origin of Civilisation' (1870) helped to\r\nclear the way in the opposite direction by demolishing the old belief,\r\nfirmly upheld by Whately and others, that savages represent a degraded\r\ntype, and that the civilised state is natural and, so to speak,\r\ncongenital to man. Tylor's 'Early History of Mankind' (1865) did still\r\nmore eminent service in the same direction. Colenso's 'Pentateuch and\r\nBook of Joshua Critically Examined,' the publication of which began in\r\n1862, had already shaken the foundations of the Mosaic cosmogony, and\r\nincidentally discredited the received view of the direct creation of the\r\nfirst human family. McLennan's 'Primitive Marriage' (1865) and Herbert\r\nSpencer's articles on the origin of religion had kept speculation alive\r\nalong other paths, all tending ultimately towards the same conclusion.\r\nDarwin's own cousin, Hensleigh Wedgwood, and Canon Farrar, had\r\nindependently endeavoured to prove that language, instead of being a\r\ndivine gift, might have arisen in a purely natural manner from\r\ninstinctive cries and the imitation of external sounds. The Duke of\r\nArgyll and Professor Max Müller, by the obvious feebleness of their\r\nhalf-hearted replies, had unconsciously aided in disseminating and\r\nenforcing the very views they attempted to combat. Bagehot and Flower,\r\nMaudsley and Jevons, Vogt and Lindsay, Galton and Brown-Séquard had each\r\nin his way contributed facts and arguments ultimately utilised by the\r\ngreat master architect in building up his consistent and harmonious\r\nedifice. Finally, in 1868, Haeckel had published his 'Natural History of\r\nCreation,' in which he discussed with surprising and perhaps excessive\r\nboldness the various stages in the genealogy of man. These various\r\nworks, following so close upon Huxley's 'Man's Place in Nature' and\r\nLyell's conclusive 'Antiquity of Man,' left Darwin no choice but to set\r\nforth his own reasoned opinions on the subject of the origin and\r\ndevelopment of the human species.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the descent of man from some lower form, collected and\r\nmarshalled together by Darwin, consists chiefly of minute inferential\r\nproofs which hardly admit of deliberate condensation. In his bodily\r\nstructure man is formed on the same underlying type or model as all the\r\nother mammals, bone answering throughout to bone, as, for example, in\r\nthe fore limb, where homologous parts have been modified in the dog into\r\ntoes, in the bat into wing-supports, in the seal into flippers, and in\r\nman himself into fingers and thumb, while still retaining in every case\r\ntheir essential fundamental likeness of construction. Even the brain of\r\nman resembles closely the brain of the higher monkeys; the differences\r\nwhich separate him in this respect from the orang or the gorilla are far\r\nslighter than the differences which separate those apes themselves from\r\nthe inferior monkeys. Indeed, as Huxley conclusively showed, on\r\nanatomical grounds alone, man must be classed in the order Primates as\r\nonly one among the many divergent forms which that order includes within\r\nits wide limits.\r\n\r\nIn his embryonic development man closely resembles the lower animals,\r\nthe human creature being almost indistinguishable in certain stages from\r\nthe dog, the bat, the seal, and especially the monkeys. At a very early\r\nage he possesses a slight projecting tail; at another, the great toe is\r\nshorter than its neighbours, and projects like the thumb at a slight\r\nangle; and at a third, the convolutions of the brain reach a point of\r\ndevelopment about equivalent to that of the adult baboon. In his first\r\nstages man himself stands far more closely related to the apes than the\r\napes in turn stand to cats or hyænas.\r\n\r\nRudiments of muscles not normally found in man occur in many aberrant\r\nhuman individuals. Some people possess the power of moving their scalps\r\nand wagging their ears like dogs and monkeys; others can twitch the skin\r\nof their bodies, as horses do when worried by flies. Mr. Woolner, the\r\nsculptor, pointed out to Darwin a certain little projecting point or\r\nknob on the margin of the ear, observed by him in the course of\r\nmodelling, which comparison shows to be the last folded remnant or\r\nrudiment of the once erect and pointed monkey-like ear-tip. The\r\nnictitating membrane, or third eyelid, once more, which in birds can be\r\ndrawn so rapidly across the ball of the eye, and which gives the\r\nfamiliar glazed or murky appearance, is fairly well developed in the\r\nornithorhynchus and the kangaroo, as well as in a few higher mammals,\r\nlike the walrus; but in man, as in the monkey group, it survives only\r\nunder the degenerate form of a practically useless rudiment, the\r\nsemilunar fold. Man differs from the other Primates in his apparently\r\nhairless condition; but the hair, though short and downy, still remains\r\non close inspection, and in some races, such as the Ainos of Japan,\r\nforms a shaggy coat like an orang's or a gibbon's. A few long rough\r\nhairs sometimes project from the short smooth down of the eyebrows; and\r\nthese peculiar bristles, occasional only in the human species, are\r\nhabitual in the chimpanzee and in many baboons. Internal organs show\r\nsimilar rudiments, of less enthralling interest, it must be candidly\r\nconfessed, to the unscientific outside intelligence. Even the bony\r\nskeleton contributes its share of confirmatory evidence; for in the\r\nlower monkeys and in many other mammals a certain main trunk nerve\r\npasses through a special perforation in the shoulder-blade, and this\r\nperforation, though now almost obsolete, sometimes recurs in man, in\r\nwhich case the nerve in question invariably passes through it, as in the\r\ninferior monkeys. What is still more remarkable is the fact that the\r\nperforation occurs far more frequently (in proportion) among the\r\nskeletons of very ancient races than among those of our own time. One\r\nchief cause why in this and other cases ancient races often present\r\nstructures resembling those of the lower animals seems to be that they\r\nstand nearer in the long line of descent to their remote animal-like\r\nprogenitors.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion at which, after fully examining all the evidence, Darwin\r\nfinally arrives is somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\nThe early ancestors of man must have been more or less monkey-like\r\nanimals, belonging to the great anthropoid group, and related to the\r\nprogenitors of the orang-outang, the chimpanzee, and the gorilla. They\r\nmust have been once covered with hair, both sexes possessing beards.\r\nTheir ears were probably pointed and capable of movement, and their\r\nbodies were provided with a movable tail. The foot had a great toe\r\nsomewhat thumb-like in its action, with which they could grasp the\r\nbranches of trees. They were probably arboreal in their habits,\r\nfruit-eaters by choice, and inhabitants of some warm forest-clad land.\r\nThe males had great canine teeth, with which they fought one another for\r\nthe possession of the females. At a much earlier period, the internal\r\nanatomical peculiarities approached those of the lowest mammals, and the\r\neye was provided with a third eyelid. Peering still further back into\r\nthe dim abyss of the ages, Darwin vaguely describes the ancestors of\r\nhumanity as aquatic animals, allied to the mudfish; for our lungs are\r\nknown to consist of modified swim-bladders, which must once have served\r\nour remote progenitors in the office of a float. The gill-clefts on the\r\nneck of the human embryo still point to the spot where the branchiæ\r\nonce, no doubt, existed. Our primordial birthplace appears to have been\r\na shore washed twice a day by the recurrent tides. The heart then took\r\nthe shape merely of a simple pulsating vessel; and a long undivided\r\nspinal cord usurped the place of the vertebral column. These extremely\r\nprimitive ancestors of man, thus dimly beheld across the gulf of ages,\r\nmust have been at least as simply and humbly organised as that very\r\nlowest and earliest of existing vertebrates, the worm-like lancelet.\r\n\r\nFrom such a rude and indefinite beginning natural selection, aided by\r\nthe various concomitant principles, has slowly built up the pedigree of\r\nman. Starting from these remote half-invertebrate forms, whose vague\r\nshape is still perhaps in part preserved for us by the soft and\r\njelly-like larva of the modern ascidian, we rise by long stages to a\r\ngroup of early fishes, like the lancelet itself. From these the ganoids\r\nand then the lung-bearing mudfish must have been gradually developed.\r\nFrom such fish a very small advance would carry us on to the newts and\r\nother amphibians. The duck-billed platypus helps us slightly to bridge\r\nover the gap between the reptiles and the lower mammals, such as the\r\nkangaroo and the wombat, though the connection with the amphibians is\r\nstill, as when Darwin wrote, highly problematical. From marsupials, such\r\nas the kangaroo, we ascend gradually to the insectivorous type\r\nrepresented by the shrews and hedgehogs, and thence once more by very\r\nwell-marked intermediate stages to the lemurs of Madagascar, a group\r\nlinked on the one hand to the insectivores, and on the other to the true\r\nmonkeys. The monkeys, again, 'branched off into two great stems--the New\r\nWorld and Old World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote period,\r\nman, the wonder and glory of the universe, proceeded.'\r\n\r\nThe word was spoken; the secret was out. The world might well have been\r\nexcused for treating it scornfully. But as a matter of fact, the storm\r\nwhich followed the 'Descent of Man' was as nothing compared with the\r\ntorrent of abuse that had pursued the author of the 'Origin of Species.'\r\nIn twelve years society had grown slowly accustomed to the once\r\nstartling idea, and it listened now with comparatively languid interest\r\nto the final utterance of the great biologist on the question of its own\r\norigin and destinies. In 1859 it cried in horror, 'How very shocking!'\r\nin 1871, it murmured complacently, 'Is that all? Why, everybody knew\r\nthat much already!'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the moral and social side, the ultimate importance of\r\nthe 'Descent of Man' upon the world's history can hardly be overrated by\r\na philosophic investigator. Vast as was the revolution effected in\r\nbiology by the 'Origin of Species,' it was as nothing compared with the\r\nstill wider, deeper, and more subtly-working revolution inaugurated by\r\nthe announcement of man's purely animal origin. The main discovery,\r\nstrange to say, affected a single branch of thought alone; the minor\r\ncorollary drawn from it to a single species has already affected, and is\r\ndestined in the future still more profoundedly to affect, every\r\npossible sphere of human energy. Not only has it completely reversed our\r\nentire conception of history generally, by teaching us that man has\r\nslowly risen from a very low and humble beginning, but it has also\r\nrevolutionised our whole ideas of our own position and our own destiny,\r\nit has permeated the sciences of language and of medicine, it has\r\nintroduced new conceptions of ethics and of religion, and it threatens\r\nin the future to produce immense effects upon the theory and practice of\r\neducation, of politics, and of economic and social science. These\r\nwide-reaching and deep-seated results began to be felt from the first\r\nmoment when the Darwinian principle was definitely promulgated in the\r\n'Origin of Species,' but their final development and general acceptance\r\nwas immensely accelerated by Darwin's own authoritative statement in the\r\n'Descent of Man.'\r\n\r\nTo some among us still, as to Lyell before us, this new belief in the\r\nanimal origin of man seems far less beautiful, noble, and inspiriting\r\nthan the older faith in his special and separate divine creation. Such\r\nthinkers find it somehow more pleasant and comfortable to suppose that\r\nman has fallen than that man has risen; the doctrine of the universal\r\ndegradation of humanity paradoxically appears to them more full of\r\npromise and aspiration for the times to come than the doctrine of its\r\nuniversal elevation. To Darwin himself, however, it seemed otherwise.\r\n'Man,' he says, 'may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen,\r\nthough not through his own exertions, to the very summit of the organic\r\nscale; and the fact of his having thus risen, instead of having been\r\naboriginally placed there, may give him hope for a still higher destiny\r\nin the distant future.' Surely this is the truer and manlier way of\r\nlooking at the reversed and improved attitude of man. Surely it is\r\nbetter to climb to the top than to have been placed there--and\r\nfallen--at the very outset. Surely it is a nobler view of life that we\r\nmay yet by our own strenuous exertions raise our race some places higher\r\nin the endless and limitless hierarchy of nature than that we are the\r\nmiserable and hopelessly degenerate descendants of a ruined and degraded\r\nangelic progenitor. Surely it is well, while we boast with Glaucus that\r\nwe indeed are far braver and better than our ancestors, to pray at the\r\nsame time, in the words of Hector, that our sons may be yet braver and\r\nbetter than ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF COURTSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same volumes with the 'Descent of Man' Darwin included his\r\nadmirable treatise on sexual selection. This form of selection he had\r\nalready dealt with briefly in the 'Origin of Species;' but as in his\r\nopinion it was largely instrumental in producing the minor differences\r\nwhich separate one race of men from another, he found it necessary to\r\nenlarge and expand it in connection with his account of the rise and\r\nprogress of the human species.\r\n\r\nAmong many animals, and especially in the higher classes of animals, the\r\nmales and females do not mate together casually; there is a certain\r\namount of selection or of courtship. In some cases, as with deer and\r\nantelopes, the males fight with one another for the possession of the\r\nfemales. In other cases, as with the peacock and the humming-birds, the\r\nmales display their beauty and their skill before the eyes of the\r\nassembled females. In the first instance, the victor obtains the mates;\r\nin the second instance, the mates themselves select from the group the\r\nhandsomest and most personally pleasing competitor. Sexual selection, of\r\nwhich these are special cases, depends on the advantage possessed by\r\ncertain individuals over others of the same sex and species solely in\r\nrespect to the question of mating. In all such instances, the males have\r\nacquired their weapons of offence and defence or their ornamental\r\ndecorations, not from being better fitted to survive in the struggle for\r\nexistence, but from having gained an advantage over other males of the\r\nsame kind, and from having transmitted this advantage to offspring of\r\ntheir own sex alone.\r\n\r\nJust as man can improve the breed of his game-cocks by the selection of\r\nthose birds which are victorious in the cockpit, so the strongest and\r\nmost vigorous males, or those provided with the best weapons, have\r\nprevailed in the state of nature over their feebler and more cowardly\r\ncompetitors. Just as man can give beauty, according to his own standard\r\nof taste, to his male poultry, by selecting special birds for their\r\nplumage, their port, their wattles, or their hackles, so female birds in\r\na state of nature have by a long-continued choice of the more attractive\r\nmales added to their beauty and their ornamental adjuncts. In these two\r\nways, Darwin believed, a limited selection has slowly developed weapons\r\nlike the horns of buffaloes, the antlers of stags, the tusks of boars,\r\nand the spurs of game-birds, together with the courage, strength, and\r\npugnacity always associated with such special organs. It has also\r\ndeveloped the ornamental plumage of the peacock, the argus pheasant, and\r\nthe birds of paradise; the song of the lark, the thrush, and the\r\nnightingale; the brilliant hues on the face of the mandrill; and the\r\nattractive perfume of the musk-deer, the snakes, and the scented\r\nbutterflies. Wherever one sex possesses any decorative or alluring\r\nadjunct not equally shared by the other, Darwin attributed this special\r\ngift either to the law of battle, or to the long and slowly exerted\r\nselective action of their fastidious mates.\r\n\r\nThe germ of the doctrine of sexual selection is to be found, like so\r\nmany other of Charles Darwin's theories, in a prophetic passage of his\r\ngrandfather's 'Zoonomia.' Stags, the Lichfield physician tells us, are\r\nprovided with antlers 'for the purpose of combating other stags for the\r\nexclusive possession of the females, who are observed, like the ladies\r\nin the time of chivalry, to attend the car of the victor. The birds\r\nwhich do not carry food to their young, and do not therefore marry, are\r\narmed with spurs for the purpose of fighting for the exclusive\r\npossession of the females, as cocks and quails. It is certain that these\r\nweapons are not provided for their defence against other adversaries,\r\nbecause the females of these species are without this armour. The final\r\ncause of this contest among the males seems to be that the strongest and\r\nmost active animal should propagate the species, which should thence\r\nbecome improved.'\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed, however, that Erasmus Darwin here imports into the\r\nquestion the metaphysical and teleological notion of the final cause,\r\nimplying that the struggle of the males was ordained from without, for\r\nthis express and preconceived purpose; whereas Charles Darwin, never\r\ntranscending the world of phenomena, more logically regards the struggle\r\nitself as an efficient cause, having for its result the survival of the\r\nstrongest or the handsomest as the case may be. This distinction is\r\nfundamental; it marks the gulf between the essentially teleological\r\nspirit of the eighteenth century and the essentially positive spirit of\r\nphilosophy and science at the present day.\r\n\r\nHere again, too, the immense logical superiority of Charles Darwin's\r\nrigorous and exhaustive inductive method over the loose suggestiveness\r\nof his grandfather Erasmus may easily be observed. For while Erasmus\r\nmerely throws out a clever and interesting hint as to the supposed\r\nmethod and intention of nature, Charles Darwin proves his thesis, point\r\nby point, with almost mathematical exactitude, leaving no objection\r\nunmet behind him, but giving statistical and inductive warrant for every\r\nstep in his cumulative argument. He goes carefully into the numerical\r\nproportion of the two sexes in various species; into the relative dates\r\nof arrival in any particular country of the males and females of\r\nmigratory birds; into the question whether any individuals ever remain\r\nin the long run unpaired; into the chances of the earliest-mated or most\r\nvigorous couples leaving behind more numerous or stronger offspring to\r\nrepresent them in the next generation. He collects from every quarter\r\nand from all sources whatever available evidence can be obtained as to\r\nthe courtship and rivalry of birds and butterflies, of deer and\r\nantelopes, of fish and lizards. He shows by numerous examples and\r\nquotations how even flies coquet together in their pretty rhythmical\r\naerial dances; how wasps battle eagerly with one another to secure\r\npossession of their unconcerned mates; how cicadas strive to win their\r\n'voiceless brides' with stridulating music; how sphinx-moths endeavour\r\nto allure their partners with the musky odour of their pencilled wings;\r\nand how emperors and orange-tips display their gorgeous spots and bands\r\nin the broad sunshine before the admiring and attentive eyes of their\r\nobservant dames. He traces up the same spirit of rivalry and ostentation\r\nto the cock-pheasant strutting about before the attendant hen, and to\r\nthe meeting-places of the blackcock, where all the males of the district\r\nfight with one another and undertake long love-dances in regular\r\ntournaments, while the females stand by and watch the chances and\r\nchanges of the contest with affected indifference. Finally, he points\r\nout how similar effects are produced by like causes among the higher\r\nanimals, especially among our near relations the monkeys; and then he\r\nproceeds to apply the principles thus firmly grounded to the particular\r\ninstance of the human race itself, the primary object of his entire\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting of the modifications due to this particular\r\nform of selective action are to be found amongst the insects and other\r\nlow types of animal life. The crickets, the locusts, and the\r\ngrasshoppers, for example, are all famous for their musical powers; but\r\nthe sounds themselves are produced in the different families by very\r\ndifferent and quaintly varied organs. The song of the crickets is evoked\r\nby the scraping of minute teeth on the under side of either wing-cover;\r\nin the case of the locusts, the left wing, which acts as a bow, overlies\r\nthe right wing, which serves as a fiddle; while with the grasshoppers,\r\nthe leg does duty as the musical instrument, and has a row of\r\nlancet-shaped elastic knobs along its outer surface, which the insect\r\nrubs across the nerves of the wing-covers when it wishes to charm the\r\nears and rouse the affection of its silent mate. In a South African\r\nspecies of the same family, the whole body of the male is fairly\r\nconverted into a musical instrument, being immensely inflated, hollow,\r\nand distended like a pellucid air-bladder in order to act as an\r\nefficient sounding-board. Among the beetles, taste seems generally to\r\nhave specialised itself rather on form than on music or colour, and the\r\nmales are here usually remarkable for their singular and very\r\ncomplicated horns, often compared in various species to those of stags\r\nor rhinoceroses, and entirely absent in the females of most kinds. But\r\nit is among the butterflies and moths that insect æstheticism has\r\nproduced its greatest artistic triumphs; for here the beautiful\r\neye-spots and delicate markings on the expanded wing-membranes are\r\nalmost certainly due to sexual selection.\r\n\r\nThe higher animals display like evidence of the same slow selective\r\naction. The courtship of the stickleback, who dances 'mad with delight'\r\naround the mate he has allured into the nest he prepares for her, has\r\nbeen observed by dozens of observers both before and since in the\r\ndomestic aquarium. The gem-like colours of the male dragonet, the\r\nbutterfly wings of certain gurnards, and the decorated tails of some\r\nexotic carps all point in the same direction. Our own larger newt is\r\nadorned during the breeding season with a serrated crest edged with\r\norange; while in the smaller kind the colours of the body acquire at the\r\nsame critical period of love-making a vivid brilliancy. The strange\r\nhorns and luridly coloured throat-pouches of tropical lizards are\r\nfamiliar to all visitors in equatorial climates, and they are confined\r\nexclusively to the male sex. Among birds, the superior beauty of the\r\nmale plumage is known to everybody; and their greatest glory invariably\r\ncoincides with the special season for the selection of mates. In the\r\nspring, as even our poets have told us, the wanton lapwing gets himself\r\nanother crest. The law of battle produces the spur of the game-birds and\r\nthe still stranger wing-spurs of certain species of the plover kind.\r\nÆsthetic rivalry is answerable rather for vocal music, and for the\r\nplumage of the umbrella-bird, the lyre-bird, the humming-birds, and the\r\ncock of the rocks. Among mammals, strength rather than beauty seems to\r\nhave carried the day; horns, and tusks, and spikes, and antlers are here\r\nthe special guerdon of the victorious males. Yet even mammals show\r\noccasional signs of distinctly æsthetic and artistic preferences, as in\r\nthe gracefully twisted horns of the koodoo, the scent-glands of the\r\nmusk-deer or of certain antelopes, the brilliant hues of the male\r\nmandrill, and the tufts and moustaches of so many monkeys.\r\n\r\nIt must be frankly conceded that the reception accorded to Darwin's\r\ndoctrine of sexual selection, even among the biological public, was far\r\nless unanimous, enthusiastic, and full than that which had been granted\r\nto his more extensive theory of survival of the fittest. Many eminent\r\nnaturalists declined from the very outset to accept the conclusions thus\r\ndefinitely set before them, and others who at first seemed disposed to\r\nbow to the immense weight of Darwin's supreme authority gradually\r\nwithdrew their grudging assent from the new doctrine, as they found\r\ntheir relapse backed up by others, and refused to believe that the\r\ntheory of courtship had been fairly proven before the final tribunal of\r\nscience. Several critics began by objecting that the whole theory was a\r\nmere afterthought. Darwin, they said, finding that natural selection\r\ndid not suffice by itself to explain all the details of structure in\r\nman, had invented sexual selection as a supplementary principle to help\r\nit over the hard places. Those who wrote and spoke in this thoughtless\r\nfashion could have had but a very inadequate idea of Darwin's close\r\nexperimental methods of enquiry. As a matter of fact, indeed, they were\r\nentirely wrong; the doctrine of sexual selection itself, already faintly\r\nforeshadowed by Erasmus Darwin in the 'Zoonomia,' had been distinctly\r\ndeveloped in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species' with at least\r\nas much provisional elaboration as any other equally important factor in\r\nthe biological drama as set forth in that confessedly introductory work.\r\nNay, Haeckel had caught gladly at the luminous conception there\r\nexpressed, even before the appearance of the 'Descent of Man,' and had\r\nworked it out in his 'Generelle Morphologie,' with great insight, to its\r\nlegitimate conclusions in many directions. Indeed, the sole reason why\r\nso much space was devoted to the subject in Darwin's work on human\r\ndevelopment was simply because there for the first time an opportunity\r\narose of utilising his vast store of collected information on this\r\nsingle aspect of the evolutionary process. It was no afterthought, but a\r\nnecessary and inevitable component element of the fully-developed\r\nevolutionary concept.\r\n\r\nStill, it cannot be denied that naturalists generally did not accept\r\nwith effusion the new clause in the evolutionary creed. Many of them\r\nhesitated; a few acquiesced; the majority more or less openly dissented.\r\nBut Darwin's belief remained firm as a rock. 'I am glad you defend\r\nsexual selection,' he wrote a few years later in a private letter; 'I\r\nhave no fear about its ultimate fate, though it is now at a discount;'\r\nand in the preface to the second edition of the 'Descent of Man,' he\r\nremarks acutely, 'I have been struck with the likeness of many of the\r\nhalf-favourable criticisms on sexual selection with those which appeared\r\nat first on natural selection; such as that it would explain some few\r\ndetails, but certainly was not applicable to the extent to which I have\r\nemployed it. My conviction of the power of sexual selection remains\r\nunshaken.... When naturalists have become familiar with the idea, it\r\nwill, as I believe, be much more largely accepted; and it has already\r\nbeen fully and favourably received by several capable judges.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of the still continued demurrer of not a few among the leading\r\nevolutionists, it is probable, I think, that Darwin's prophecy on this\r\nmatter will yet be justified by the verdict of time. For the opposition\r\nto the doctrine of sexual selection proceeds almost invariably, as it\r\nseems to me, from those persons who still desire to erect an efficient\r\nbarrier of one sort or another between the human and animal worlds;\r\nwhile on the contrary the theory in question is almost if not quite\r\nuniversally accepted by just those rigorously evolutionary biologists\r\nwho are freest from preconceptions or special _a priori_ teleological\r\nobjections of any kind whatever. The half of the doctrine which deals\r\nwith the law of battle, indeed, can hardly be doubted by any competent\r\nnaturalist; the other half, which deals with the supposed æsthetic\r\npreferences of the females, is, no doubt, distasteful to certain\r\nthinkers because it seems to imply the existence in the lower animals of\r\na sense of beauty which many among us are not even now prepared\r\ngenerously to admit. The desire to arrogate to mankind alone all the\r\nhigher faculties either of sense or intellect has probably much to do\r\nwith the current disinclination towards the Darwinian idea of sexual\r\nselection. Thinkers who allow themselves to be emotionally swayed by\r\nsuch extraneous considerations forget that the beautiful is merely that\r\nwhich pleases; that beauty has no external objective existence; and that\r\nthe range of taste, both among ourselves and among animals at large, is\r\npractically infinite. The greatest blow ever aimed at the Darwinian\r\ntheory of sexual selection was undoubtedly that dealt out by Mr. Alfred\r\nRussel Wallace (et tu, Brute!) in his able and subtle article on the\r\nColours of Animals in 'Macmillan's Magazine,' since reprinted in his\r\ndelightful work on 'Tropical Nature.' Wallace there urges with his usual\r\nacuteness, ingenuity, and skill several fundamental objections to the\r\nDarwinian hypothesis of no little importance and weight. But it must\r\nalways be remembered (with all due respect to the joint discoverer of\r\nnatural selection) that Mr. Wallace himself, after publishing his own\r\nadmirable essay on the development of man, drew back aghast in the end\r\nfrom the full consequences of his own admission, and uttered his partial\r\nrecantation in the singular words, 'Natural selection could only have\r\nendowed the savage with a brain a little superior to that of an ape.' It\r\nseems probable that in every case an analogous desire to erect a firm\r\nbarrier between man and brute by positing the faculty for perceiving\r\nbeauty as a special quasi-divine differentia of the human race has been\r\nat the bottom of the still faintly surviving dislike amongst a section\r\nof scientific men to sexual selection. Nevertheless, a candid and\r\nimpartial critic would be compelled frankly to admit that Darwin's\r\nadmirable theory of courtship has not on the whole proved so generally\r\nacceptable to the biological world up to the present time as his greater\r\nand far more comprehensive theory of survival of the fittest. It still\r\nwaits for its final recognition, towards which it is progressing more\r\nrapidly and surely every day it lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nVICTORY AND REST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last eleven years of Darwin's life were spent in enforcing and\r\ndeveloping the principles already reached, and in enjoying the almost\r\nunchequered progress of the revolution he had so unconsciously to\r\nhimself succeeded in inaugurating.\r\n\r\nOnly one year elapsed between the publication of the 'Descent of Man'\r\nand that of its next important successor, the 'Expression of the\r\nEmotions.' The occasion of this learned and bulky treatise in itself\r\nstands as an immortal proof of the conscientious way in which Darwin\r\nwent to work to anticipate the slightest and most comparatively\r\nimpertinent possible objections to his main theories. Sir Charles Bell,\r\nin one of the quaintly antiquated Bridgwater treatises--those marvellous\r\nmonuments of sadly misplaced teleological ingenuity--had maintained that\r\nman was endowed with sundry small facial muscles solely for the sake of\r\nexpressing his emotions. This view was so obviously opposed to the\r\nbelief in the descent of man from some lower form, 'that,' says Darwin,\r\n'it was necessary for me to consider it;' and so he did, in a lengthy\r\nwork, where the whole subject is exhaustively treated, and Bell's idea\r\nis completely pulverised by the apt allegation of analogous expressions\r\nin the animal world. In his old age Darwin grew, in fact, only the more\r\nceaselessly and wonderfully industrious. In 1875, after three years of\r\ncomparative silence, came the 'Insectivorous Plants,' a work full of\r\nminute observation on the habits and manners of the sundew, the\r\nbutterwort, the Venus's fly-catcher, and the various heterogeneous\r\nbog-haunting species known by the common name of pitcher plants. The\r\nbare mass and weight of the facts which Darwin had collected for the\r\n'Origin of Species' might well-nigh have stifled the very existence of\r\nthat marvellous book: it was lucky that the premature publication of\r\nWallace's paper compelled him to hurry on his 'brief abstract,' for if\r\nhe had waited to select and arrange the whole series of observations\r\nthat he finally published in his various later justificatory volumes, we\r\nmight have looked in vain for the great systematic and organising work,\r\nwhich would no doubt have been 'surcharged with its own weight, and\r\nstrangled with its waste fertility.' But the task that he himself best\r\nloved was to watch in minute detail the principles whose secret he had\r\npenetrated, and whose reserve he had broken, working themselves out\r\nbefore his very eyes, naked and not ashamed--to catch Actæon-like the\r\nundraped form of nature herself in the actual process of her inmost\r\nbeing. He could patiently observe the red and slimy hair-glands of the\r\ndrosera closing slowly and remorselessly round the insect prey, and\r\nsucking from their bodies with sensitive tentacles the protoplasmic\r\njuices denied to its leaves by the poor and boggy soil, on which alone\r\nits scanty rootlets can properly thrive. He could watch the butterwort\r\ncurving round the edges of its wan green foliage upon the captured limbs\r\nof fly or aphis. He could note how the serried mass of finger-like\r\nprocesses in the utricles of the bladderwort slowly absorb organic\r\nmatter from the larva of a gnat, or the minute water-insects entangled\r\nwithin its living and almost animated lobster-pot. He could track the\r\nlong line of treacherous honey-glands by which the sarracenia entices\r\nflies into the festering manure-wells of its sticky pitchers. The\r\nminuteness and skill of all his observations on these lesser problems of\r\nnatural selection inevitably inspired faith among outsiders in the\r\ncautious judgment of the observer and experimenter; and day by day\r\nthroughout his later years the evidence of the popular acceptance of his\r\ndoctrine, and of the dying away of the general ridicule with which it\r\nwas first received by the unlearned public, was very gratifying to the\r\ngreat naturalist.\r\n\r\nA year later, in 1876, came the 'Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation\r\nin the Vegetable Kingdom.' So far as regarded the world of plants,\r\nespecially with respect to its higher divisions, this work was of\r\nimmense theoretical importance; and it also cast a wonderful side-light\r\nupon the nature of that strange distinction of sex which occurs both in\r\nthe vegetable and animal kingdom, and in each is the concomitant--one\r\nmight almost say the necessary concomitant--of high development and\r\ncomplex organisation. The great result attained by Darwin in his long\r\nand toilsome series of experiments on this interesting subject was the\r\nsplendid proof of the law that cross-fertilisation produces finer and\r\nhealthier offspring, while continuous self-fertilisation tends in the\r\nlong run to degradation, degeneration, and final extinction.\r\n\r\nHere as elsewhere, however, Darwin's principle does not spring\r\nspontaneous, like Athene from the head of Zeus, a goddess full-formed,\r\nuncaused, inexplicable: it arises gradually by a slow process of\r\ndevelopment and modification from the previous investigations of earlier\r\nbiologists. At the close of the last century, in the terrible year of\r\nupheaval 1793, a quiet German botanist, Christian Konrad Sprengel by\r\nname, published at Berlin his long unheeded but intensely interesting\r\nwork on the 'Fertilisation of Flowers.' In the summer of 1789, while all\r\nEurope was ablaze with the news that the Bastille had been stormed, and\r\na new era of humanity begun, the calm and peaceful Pomeranian observer\r\nwas noting in his own garden the curious fact that many flowers are\r\nincapable of being fertilised without the assistance of flying insects,\r\nwhich carry pollen from the stamens of one blossom to the sensitive\r\nsurface or ovary of the next. Hence he concluded that the secretion of\r\nhoney or nectar in flowers, the contrivances by which it is protected\r\nfrom rain, the bright hues or lines of the corolla, and the sweet\r\nperfume distilled by the blossoms, are all so many cunning devices of\r\nnature to ensure fertilisation by the insect-visitors. Moreover,\r\nSprengel observed that many flowers are of one sex only, and that in\r\nseveral others the sexes do not mature simultaneously; 'so that,' said\r\nhe, 'nature seems to intend that no flower shall be fertilised by means\r\nof its own pollen.' Indeed, in some instances, as he showed by\r\nexperiments upon the yellow day lily, plants impregnated from their own\r\nstamens cannot be made to set seed at all. 'So near,' says his able\r\nsuccessor, Hermann Müller, 'was Sprengel to the distinct recognition of\r\nthe fact that self-fertilisation leads to worse results than\r\ncross-fertilisation, and that all the arrangements which favour\r\ninsect-visits are of value to the plant itself, simply because the\r\ninsect-visitors effect cross-fertilisation!' As in most other\r\nanticipatory cases, however, it must be here remarked that Sprengel's\r\nidea was wholly teleological: he conceived of nature as animated by a\r\ndirect informing principle, which deliberately aimed at a particular\r\nresult; whereas Darwin rather came to the conclusion that\r\ncross-fertilisation as a matter of fact does actually produce beneficial\r\nresults, and that therefore those plants which varied most in the\r\ndirection of arrangements for favouring insect-visits were likely to be\r\nexceptionally fortunate in the struggle for existence against\r\ncompetitors otherwise arranged. It is just the usual Darwinian\r\nsubstitution of an efficient for a final cause.\r\n\r\nEven before Sprengel, Kölreuter had recognised, in 1761, that\r\nself-fertilisation was avoided in nature; and his observations and\r\nexperiments on intercrossing and on hybridism were largely relied upon\r\nby Darwin himself, to whom they suggested at an early period many\r\nfruitful lines of original investigation. In 1799, again, Andrew Knight,\r\nfollowing up the same line of thought in England as Sprengel in Germany,\r\ndeclared as the result of his close experiments upon the garden pea,\r\nthat no plant ever fertilises itself for a perpetuity of generations.\r\nBut Knight's law, not being brought into causal connection with any\r\ngreat fundamental principle of nature, was almost entirely overlooked by\r\nthe scientific world until the publication of Darwin's 'Origin of\r\nSpecies,' half a century later. The same neglect also overtook\r\nSprengel's immensely interesting and curious work on fertilisation of\r\nflowers. The world, in fact, was not yet ready for the separate\r\ntreatment of functional problems connected with the interrelations of\r\norganic beings; so Knight and Sprengel were laid aside unnoticed on the\r\ndusty top bookshelves of public libraries, while the dry classificatory\r\nand systematic biology of the moment had it ail its own way for the time\r\nbeing on the centre reading-tables. So many separate and independent\r\nstrands of thought does it ultimately require to make up the grand final\r\ngeneralisation which the outer world attributes in its totality to the\r\none supreme organising intelligence.\r\n\r\nBut in the 'Origin of Species' itself Darwin reiterated and emphasised\r\nKnight's law as a general and all-pervading principle of nature, placing\r\nit at the same time on broader and surer biological foundations by\r\naffiliating it intimately upon his own great illuminating and unifying\r\ndoctrine of natural selection. He also soon after rescued from oblivion\r\nSprengel's curious and fairy-like book, showing in full detail in his\r\nwork on orchids the wonderful contrivances by which flowers seek to\r\nattract and to secure the assistance of insects for the impregnation of\r\ntheir embryo seeds. In the 'Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,' he further showed that breeding in-and-in diminishes the\r\nstrength and productiveness of the offspring; while crossing with\r\nanother stock produces, on the contrary, the best possible physical\r\nresults in both directions. And now at last, in the 'Effects of Cross\r\nand Self fertilisation,' he proved by careful and frequently repeated\r\nexperiments that a constant infusion of fresh blood (so to speak) is\r\nessential to the production of the healthiest offspring. In the words of\r\nhis own emphatic summing up, 'Nature abhors perpetual\r\nself-fertilisation.'\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of these new statements and this fresh rationale of\r\nKnight's law was to bring down Sprengel forthwith from the top shelf,\r\nwhere he had languished ingloriously for seventy years, and to set a\r\nwhole school of ardent botanical observers working hard in the lines he\r\nhad laid down upon the mutual correlations of insects and flowers. A\r\nvast literature sprang up at once upon this enchanting and\r\nlong-neglected subject, the most eminent workers in the rediscovered\r\nfield being Delpino in Italy, Hildebrand and Hermann Müller in Germany,\r\nAxel in Sweden, Lubbock in England, and Fritz Müller in tropical South\r\nAmerica. Darwin found the question, in fact, almost taken out of his\r\nhands before he had time himself to treat of it; for Hildebrand's chief\r\nwork was published as early as 1867, while Axel's appeared in 1869, both\r\nof them several years earlier than Darwin's own final essay on the\r\nsubject in the 'Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation.' No statement,\r\nperhaps, could more clearly mark the enormous impetus given to\r\nresearches in this direction than the fact that D'Arcy Thompson, in his\r\nappendix to Müller's splendid work on the 'Fertilisation of Flowers,'\r\nhas collected a list of no less than eight hundred and fourteen separate\r\nworks or important papers bearing on that special department of botany,\r\nalmost all of them subsequent in date to the first publication of the\r\n'Origin of Species.' So widely did the Darwinian wave extend, and so\r\nprofoundly did it affect every minute point of biological and\r\npsychological investigation.\r\n\r\nEach of these later works of Darwin's consists, as a rule, of an\r\nexpansion of some single chapter or paragraph in the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies;' or, to speak more correctly, of an arrangement of the\r\nmaterials collected and the experiments designed for that particular\r\nportion of the great projected encyclopædia of evolutionism, of which\r\nthe 'Origin of Species' itself was but a brief anticipatory summary or\r\nrough outline. Thus, the book on Orchids, published in 1862, is already\r\nforeshadowed in a part of the chapter on the Difficulties of the Theory\r\nof Natural Selection; the 'Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants'\r\n(1865) is briefly summarised by anticipation in the long section on\r\nModes of Transition; the 'Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication' (1868) consists of the vast array of _pièces\r\njustificatives_ for the first chapter of the 'Origin of Species;' and\r\nthe germ of the 'Cross and Self Fertilisation' (1876) is to be seen in\r\nthe passage 'On the Intercrossing of Individuals' in Chapter IV. of the\r\nsame work. It was well indeed that Darwin began by publishing the\r\nshorter and more manageable abstract; the half, as the wise Greek\r\nproverb shrewdly remarks, is often more than the whole; and a world that\r\neagerly devoured the first great deliverance of the Darwinian principle,\r\nmight have stood aghast had it been asked to swallow it piecemeal in\r\nsuch gigantic treatises as those with which its author afterwards sought\r\nthrice to vanquish all his foes and thrice to slay the slain.\r\n\r\nYet, with each fresh manifestation of Darwin's inexhaustible resources,\r\non the other hand, the opposition to his principles grew feebler and\r\nfeebler, and the universality of their acceptance more and more\r\npronounced, till at last, among biologists at least, not to be a\r\nDarwinian was equivalent to being hopelessly left behind by the general\r\nonward movement of the time. In 1874 Tyndall delivered his famous\r\naddress at the Belfast meeting of the British Association; and in 1877,\r\nfrom the same presidential chair at Plymouth, Allen Thomson, long\r\nreputed a doubtful waverer, enforced his cordial adhesion to the\r\nDarwinian principles by his inaugural discourse on 'The Development of\r\nthe Forms of Animal Life.' A new generation of active workers, trained\r\nup from the first in the evolutionary school, like Romanes, Ray\r\nLankester, Thistleton Dyer, Balfour, Sully, and Moggridge, had now risen\r\ngradually around the great master; and in every direction he could see\r\nthe seed he had himself planted being watered and nourished in fresh\r\nsoil by a hundred ardent and enthusiastic young disciples. Even in\r\nFrance, ever irresponsive to the touch of new ideas of alien origin,\r\nColonel Moulinié's admirable and sympathetic translations were beginning\r\nto win over to the evolutionary creed many rising workers; while in\r\nGermany, Victor Carus's excellent versions had from the very first\r\nbrought in the enthusiastic Teutonic biologists with a congenial\r\n'swarmery' to the camp of the Darwinians. Correspondents from every part\r\nof the world kept pressing fresh facts and fresh applications upon the\r\nfounder of the faith; and Darwin saw his own work so fast being taken\r\nout of his hands by specialist disciples that he abandoned entirely his\r\noriginal intention of publishing in detail the basis of his first book,\r\nand contented himself instead with tracing out minutely some minor\r\nportions of his contemplated task as specimens of evolutionary method.\r\n\r\nIn 1877, in pursuance of this changed purpose, Darwin published his book\r\non 'Forms of Flowers,' in which he dealt closely with the old problem of\r\ndifferently shaped blossoms on plants of the same species. It had long\r\nbeen known, to take a single example, that primroses existed in two\r\nforms, the pin-eyed and the thrum-eyed, of which the former has the\r\npin-like summit of the pistil at the top of the tube, and the stamens\r\nconcealed half way down its throat; while in the latter these relative\r\npositions are exactly reversed, the stamens answering in place to the\r\npistil of the alternative form with geometrical accuracy. As early as\r\n1862 Darwin had shown, in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society,' that\r\nthis curious arrangement owed its development to the greater security\r\nwhich it afforded for cross-fertilisation, because in this way each\r\nflower had to be impregnated with the pollen, from a totally distinct\r\nblossom, growing on a different individual plant. In a series of\r\nsuccessive papers read before the same Society in the years between 1863\r\nand 1868, he had extended a similar course of explanation to the\r\nmultiform flowers of the flaxes, the loosestrifes, the featherfoil, the\r\nauricula, the buckbean, and several other well-known plants. At last, in\r\n1877, he gathered together into one of the now familiar green-covered\r\nvolumes the whole of his observations on this strange peculiarity, and\r\nproved by abundant illustration and experiment that the diversity of\r\nform is always due through natural selection to the advantage gained by\r\nperfect security of cross-fertilisation, resulting as it invariably does\r\nin the production of the finest, strongest, and most successful\r\nseedlings. Any variation, however peculiar, which helps to ensure this\r\nconstant infusion of fresh blood is certain to be favoured in the\r\nstruggle for life, owing to the superior vitality of the stock it\r\nbegets. But it is worthy of notice, as showing the extreme minuteness\r\nand exhaustiveness of Darwin's method on the small scale, side by side\r\nwith his extraordinary and unusual power of rising to the very highest\r\nand grandest generalisations, that the volume which he devoted to the\r\nelucidation of this minor factor in the question of hereditary\r\nadvantages runs to nearly as many pages as the last edition of the\r\n'Origin of Species' itself. So great was the wealth of observation and\r\nexperiment which he could lavish upon the solution of a single, small,\r\nincidental problem.\r\n\r\nEven fuller in minute original research was the work which Darwin\r\npublished in 1880, on 'The Power of Movement in Plants,' detailing the\r\nresult of innumerable observations on the seemingly irresponsible yet\r\nalmost purposive rotations of the growing rootlets and young stems of\r\npeas and climbers. Anyone who wishes to see on what a wide foundation of\r\nirrefragable fact the great biologist built up the stately fabric of his\r\nvast theories cannot do better than turn for instruction to this\r\nremarkable volume, which the old naturalist gave to the world some time\r\nafter passing the allotted span of threescore years and ten.\r\n\r\nIt was in the same year (1880) that Huxley delivered at the Royal\r\nInstitution his famous address on the Coming of Age of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.' The time was a favourable one for reviewing the silent and\r\nalmost unobserved progress of a great revolution. Twenty-one years had\r\ncome and gone since the father of modern scientific evolutionism had\r\nlaunched upon the world his tentative work. In those twenty-one years\r\nthe thought of humanity had been twisted around as upon some invisible\r\npivot, and a new heaven and a new earth had been presented to the eyes\r\nof seers and thinkers. One-and-twenty years before, despite the\r\ninfluence of Hutton and of Lyell, the dominant view of the earth's past\r\nhistory revealed but one vast and lawless succession of hideous\r\ncatastrophes. Wholesale creations and wholesale extinctions, world-wide\r\ncataclysms followed by fresh world-wide births of interwoven faunas and\r\nfloras--these, said Huxley, were the ordinary machinery of the\r\ngeological epic brought into fashion by the misapplied genius of the\r\nmighty Cuvier. One-and-twenty years after, the opponents themselves had\r\ngiven up the game in its fullest form as lost beyond the hope of\r\npossible restitution. Some hesitating thinkers, it is true, while\r\naccepting the evolutionary doctrine more or less in its earlier form,\r\nlike Mivart and Meehan, yet refused their assent on one ground or\r\nanother to the specific Darwinian doctrine of natural selection. Others,\r\nlike Wallace, made a special exception with regard to the development of\r\nthe human species, which they supposed to be due to other causes from\r\nthose implied in the remainder of the organic scale. Yet on the whole,\r\nbiological science had fairly carried the day in favour of evolution, in\r\none form or another, and not even the cavillers dared now to suggest\r\nthat whole systems of creation had been swept away _en bloc_, and remade\r\nagain in different forms for a succeeding epoch, in accordance with the\r\nbelief which was almost universal among geologists up to the exact\r\nmoment of the publication of Darwin's masterpiece.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-one years, too, as Huxley likewise pointed out, an\r\nimmense number of new facts had come to strengthen the hands of the\r\nevolutionists at the very point where they had before felt themselves\r\nmost openly vulnerable. Palæontology had supplied many of those missing\r\nlinks in the organic chain whose absence from the interrupted and\r\nimperfect geological record had been loudly alleged against the\r\nDarwinian hypothesis in the earlier days of struggle and hesitation. Two\r\nyears after the publication of the 'Origin of Species,' the discovery of\r\na winged and feathered creature, happily preserved for us in the\r\nSolenhofen slates, with lizard-like head and teeth and tail, and\r\nbird-like pinions, feet, and breast, had bridged over in part the great\r\ngap that yawns between the existing birds and reptiles. A few years\r\nlater, new fossil reptilian forms, erect on their hind legs like\r\nkangaroos, and with very singular peculiarities of bony structure, had\r\nhelped still further to show the nature of the modifications by which\r\nthe scale-bearing quadruped type passed slowly into that of the\r\nfeather-bearing biped. In 1875, again, Professor Marsh's discovery of\r\nthe toothed birds in the American cretaceous strata completed the\r\nillustrative series of transitional forms over what had once been the\r\nmost remarkable existing break in the continuity of organic development.\r\nSimilarly, Hofmeister's investigations in the vegetable world brought\r\nclose together the flowering and flowerless plants, by indicating that\r\nthe ferns and the horsetails were connected in curious unforeseen ways,\r\nthrough the pill-worts and club-mosses, with the earliest and simplest\r\nof forest trees, the firs and the puzzle-monkeys. In minor matters like\r\nprogress was continually reported on every side. Gaudry found among the\r\nfossils of Attica the successive stages by which the ancient and\r\nundeveloped civets passed into the more modern and specialised tribe of\r\nthe hyænas; Marsh traced out in Western America the ancestry of the\r\nhorse from a five-toed creature no bigger than a fox, through\r\nintermediate four-toed and three-toed forms, to the existing single\r\nsolid-hoofed type with its digits reduced to the minimum of unity; and\r\nFilhol unearthed among the phosphorites of Quercy the common progenitor\r\nof the most distinct among the recent carnivores, the cats and the dogs,\r\nthe plantigrade bears and the digitigrade pumas. 'So far as the animal\r\nworld is concerned,' Professor Huxley said in conclusion, reviewing\r\nthese additions to the evidence upon that memorable occasion, 'evolution\r\nis no longer a speculation but a statement of historical fact.' Of\r\nDarwin himself he remarked truly, 'He has lived long enough to outlast\r\ndetraction and opposition, and to see the stone that the builders\r\nrejected become the head-stone of the corner.'\r\n\r\nIt was in 1881 that Darwin published his last volume, 'The Formation of\r\nVegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.' In this singularly\r\nfascinating and interesting monograph he took in hand one of the\r\nlowliest and humblest of living forms, the common earthworm, and by an\r\nexhaustive study of its habits and manners strove to show how the\r\nentire existence of vegetable mould--the ordinary covering of fertile\r\nsoil upon the face of the earth--is due to the long but unobtrusive\r\naction of these little-noticed and ever-active architects. By the acids\r\nwhich they evolve, they appear to aid largely in the disintegration of\r\nthe stone beneath the surface; by their constant practice of eating\r\nfallen leaves, which they drag down with them into their subterranean\r\nburrows, they produce the fine castings of soft earth, so familiar to\r\neverybody, and thus reinstate the coating of humus above the bare rock\r\nas often as it is washed away again in the course of ordinary denudation\r\nby the rain and the torrents. It is true that subsequent investigation\r\nhas shown the possibility of vegetable mould existing under certain\r\nconditions without the intervention of worms to any marked extent; but,\r\nas a whole, there can be little doubt that over most parts of the world\r\nthe presence of soil, and therefore of the vegetable growth rooted in\r\nit, is entirely due to the unsuspected yet ceaseless activity of these\r\nhumble creatures.\r\n\r\nThe germ of the earthworm theory appears to me to have been first\r\nsuggested to Darwin's mind by a passage in a work where one would little\r\nhave suspected it--White's 'Natural History of Selborne.' 'Earthworms,'\r\nsays the idyllic Hampshire naturalist, 'though in appearance a small and\r\ndespicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a\r\nlamentable chasm. For to say nothing of half the birds, and some\r\nquadrupeds, which are almost entirely supported by them, worms seem to\r\nbe the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely\r\nwithout them, by boring, perforating, and loosening the soil, and\r\nrendering it pervious to rains and the fibres of plants, by drawing\r\nstraws and stalks of leaves into it; and, most of all, by throwing up\r\nsuch infinite numbers of lumps of earth, called worm-casts, which, being\r\ntheir excrement, is a fine manure for grain and grass. Worms probably\r\nprovide new soils for hills and slopes where the rain washes the earth\r\naway; and they affect slopes, probably, to avoid being flooded.\r\nGardeners and farmers express their detestation of worms; the former,\r\nbecause they render their walks unsightly, and make them much work; and\r\nthe latter, because, as they think, worms eat their green corn. But\r\nthese men would find, that the earth without worms would soon become\r\ncold, hard-bound, and void of fermentation; and, consequently, sterile.'\r\n\r\nIf Darwin ever read this interesting passage, which he almost certainly\r\nmust at some time have done, it would appear that he had overlooked it\r\nin later life; for he, who was habitually so candid and careful in the\r\nacknowledgment of all his obligations, however great or however small,\r\ndoes not make any mention of it at all in his 'Vegetable Mould,' though\r\nhe alludes incidentally to some other observations of Gilbert White's on\r\nthe minor habits and manners of earthworms. But whether Darwin was\r\noriginally indebted to White or not for the foundation of his theory on\r\nthe subject of mould, the important point to notice is really this, that\r\nwhat with the observant parson of Selborne was but a casual glimpse, the\r\nmere passing suggestion of a fruitful idea, became with Darwin, in his\r\nwider fashion, a carefully elaborated and powerfully buttressed theory,\r\nsupported by long and patient investigation, ample experiment, and vast\r\ncollections of minute facts. The difference is strikingly characteristic\r\nof the strong point of Darwin's genius. While he had all the breadth and\r\nuniversality of the profoundest thinkers, he had also all the marvellous\r\nand inexhaustible patience of the most precise and special microscopical\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nFor years, indeed, Darwin studied the ways and instincts of the common\r\nearthworm with the same close and accurate observation which he gave to\r\nevery other abstruse subject that engaged in any way his acute\r\nintellect. The lawyer's maxim, 'De minimis lex non curat,' he used to\r\nsay, never truly applies to science. As early as the year 1837 he read a\r\npaper, before the Geological Society of London, 'On the Formation of\r\nMould,' in which he developed with some fulness the mother idea of his\r\ncomplete theory on the earthworm question. He there showed that layers\r\nof cinders, marl, or ashes, which had been strewn thickly over the\r\nsurface of meadows, were found a few years after at a depth of some\r\ninches beneath the turf, yet still forming in spite of their burial a\r\nregular and fairly horizontal stratum. This apparent sinking of the\r\nstones, he believed, was due to the quantity of fine earth brought up to\r\nthe surface by worms in the form of castings. It was objected to his\r\ntheory at the time that the work supposed to be accomplished by the\r\nworms was out of all reasonable proportion to the size and numbers of\r\nthe alleged actors. Here Darwin's foot was on his native heath; he felt\r\nhimself immediately on solid ground again. The cumulative importance of\r\nseparately infinitesimal elements is indeed the very keynote and special\r\npeculiarity of the great biologist's method of thinking. He had found\r\nout in very truth that many a little makes a mickle, that the infinitely\r\nsmall, infinitely repeated, may become in process of infinite years\r\ninfinitely important. So he set himself to work, with characteristic\r\ncontempt of time, to weigh and measure worms and worm-castings.\r\n\r\nHe began by keeping tame earthworms in flower-pots in his own house,\r\ncounting the number of worms and burrows in certain measured spaces of\r\npasture or garden, and starting his long and slow experiment in his\r\nfield at Down already alluded to. He tried issues on their senses, on\r\ntheir instincts, on their emotions, on their intelligence; he watched\r\nthem darting wildly like rabbits into their holes when alarmed from\r\nwithout, overcoming engineering difficulties in dragging down\r\noddly-shaped or unfamiliar leaves, and protecting the open mouths of\r\ntheir tunnels from intruders with a little defensive military glacis of\r\nrounded pebbles. He found that more than 53,000 worms on an average\r\ninhabit every acre of garden land, and that a single casting sometimes\r\nweighs as much as three ounces avoirdupois. Ten tons of soil per acre\r\npass annually through their bodies, and mould is thrown up by them at an\r\naverage rate of 22 inches in a century. Careful observations on the\r\nstones of Stonehenge; on the tiled floors of buried buildings; on Roman\r\nruins at Silchester and Wroxeter, and on his own meadows and pastures at\r\nDown, finally enabled the cautious experimenter to prove conclusively\r\nthe truth of his thesis, and to present to the world the despised\r\nearthworm in a new character, as the friend of man and of agriculture,\r\nthe producer and maintainer of the vegetable mould on our hills or\r\nvalleys, and the prime cause of the very existence of that cloak of\r\ngreensward that clothes our lawns, our fields, and our pleasure-grounds.\r\n\r\nIt was his last work. Persistent ill-health and equally persistent study\r\nfor seventy-three years had broken down a constitution never really\r\nstrong, and consumed from within by the ceaseless fires of its own\r\noverpowering and undying energy. On Tuesday, April the 18th, 1882, he\r\nwas seized at midnight by violent pains, and at four o'clock on\r\nWednesday afternoon he died suddenly in his son's arms, after a very\r\nshort but painful illness. So retired was the family life at Down that\r\nthe news of the great biologist's death was not actually known in London\r\nitself till two days after he had breathed his last.\r\n\r\nThe universal regret and grief expressed at the loss in all civilised\r\ncountries was the best measure of the immense change of front which had\r\nslowly come over the whole educated community, in the twenty-three years\r\nsince the first publication of the 'Origin of Species.' No sooner was\r\nDarwin's death announced than all lands and all classes vied with one\r\nanother in their eagerness to honour the name and memory of the great\r\nbiologist. Indeed, the spontaneous and immediate nature of the outburst\r\nof regret and affectionate regard which followed hard upon the news of\r\nDarwin's death, astonished even those who had watched closely the\r\nextraordinary revolution the man himself had brought so well to its\r\nfinal consummation. In England, it was felt instinctively on every side\r\nthat the great naturalist's proper place was in the aisles of\r\nWestminster, hard by the tomb of Newton, his immortal predecessor. To\r\nthis universal and deep-seated feeling Darwin's family regretfully\r\nsacrificed their own natural preference for a quiet interment in the\r\ngraveyard at Down. On the Wednesday morning next after his death,\r\nCharles Darwin's remains were borne with unwonted marks, of respect and\r\nceremony, in the assembled presence of all that was noble and good in\r\nBritain, to an honoured grave in the precincts of the great Abbey.\r\nWallace and Huxley, Lubbock and Hooker, his nearest peers in the domain\r\nof pure science, stood among the bearers who held the pall. Lowell\r\nrepresented the republics of America and of letters. Statesmen, and\r\npoets, and philosophers, and theologians mingled with the throng of\r\nscientific thinkers who crowded close around the venerated bier. No\r\nincident of fitting pomp or dignity was wanting as the organ pealed out\r\nin solemn strains the special anthem composed for the occasion, to the\r\nappropriate words of the Hebrew poet, 'Happy is the man that findeth\r\nwisdom.' Even the narrow Philistine intelligence itself, which still\r\nknew Darwin only as the man who thought we were all descended from\r\nmonkeys, was impressed with the sole standard of greatness open to its\r\nfeeble and shallow comprehension by the mere solemnity and ceremony of\r\nthe occasion, and began to enquire with blind wonderment what this\r\nthinker had done whom a whole people thus delighted to honour.\r\n\r\nOf Darwin's pure and exalted moral nature no Englishman of the present\r\ngeneration can trust himself to speak with becoming moderation. His love\r\nof truth, his singleness of heart, his sincerity, his earnestness, his\r\nmodesty, his candour, his absolute sinking of self and\r\nselfishness--these, indeed, are all conspicuous to every reader, on the\r\nvery face of every word he ever printed. Like his works themselves, they\r\nmust long outlive him. But his sympathetic kindliness, his ready\r\ngenerosity, the staunchness of his friendship, the width and depth and\r\nbreadth of his affections, the manner in which 'he bore with those who\r\nblamed him unjustly without blaming them in return,' these things can\r\nnever so well be known to any other generation of men as to the three\r\ngenerations who walked the world with him. Many even of those who did\r\nnot know him loved him like a father; to many who never saw his face,\r\nthe hope of winning Charles Darwin's approbation and regard was the\r\nhighest incentive to thought and action. Towards younger men,\r\nespecially, his unremitting kindness was always most noteworthy: he\r\nspoke and wrote to them, not like one of the masters in Israel, but like\r\na fellow-worker and seeker after truth, interested in their interests,\r\npleased at their successes, sympathetic with their failures, gentle to\r\ntheir mistakes. Not that he ever spared rightful criticism; on the\r\ncontrary, the love of truth was with him so overpowering and enthralling\r\na motive that he pointed out what seemed to him errors or misconceptions\r\nin the work of others with perfect frankness, fully expecting them to be\r\nas pleased and delighted at a suggested amendment of their faulty\r\nwriting as he himself was in his own case. But his praise was as\r\ngenerous as his criticism was frank; and, amid all the toil of his\r\nlaborious life in his study at Down, he could always find time to read\r\nand comment at full length upon whatever fresh contributions to his own\r\nsubjects the merest tyro might venture to submit for his consideration.\r\nHe had the sympathetic receptivity of all truly great minds, and when\r\nhe died, thousands upon thousands who had never beheld his serene\r\nfeatures and his fatherly eyes felt they had lost indeed a personal\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nGreatness is not always joined with gentleness: in Charles Darwin's\r\ncase, by universal consent of all who knew him, 'an intellect which had\r\nno superior' was wedded to 'a character even nobler than the\r\nintellect.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDARWIN'S PLACE IN THE EVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo most people Darwinism and evolution mean one and the same thing.\r\nAfter what has here been said, however, with regard to the pre-Darwinian\r\nevolutionary movement, and the distinction between the doctrines of\r\ndescent with modification and of natural selection, it need hardly be\r\nadded that the two are quite separate and separable in thought, even\r\nwithin the limits of the purely restricted biological order. Darwinism\r\nis only a part of organic evolution; the theory, as a whole, owes much\r\nto Darwin, but it does not owe everything to him alone. There were\r\nbiological evolutionists before ever he published the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies;' there are biological evolutionists even now who refuse to\r\naccept the truth of his great discovery, and who cling firmly to the\r\nprimitive faith set forth in earlier and cruder shapes by Erasmus\r\nDarwin, by Lamarck, or by Robert Chambers.\r\n\r\nMuch more, then, must Darwinism and the entire theory of organic\r\ndevelopment to which it belongs be carefully discriminated, as a part or\r\nfactor, from evolution at large, as a universal and all-embracing\r\ncosmical system. That system itself has gradually emerged as a slow\r\ngrowth of the past two centuries, a progressive development of the\r\ncollective scientific and philosophical mind of humanity, not due in its\r\ntotality to any one single commanding thinker, but summing itself up at\r\nlast in our own time more fully in the person and teaching of Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer than of any other solitary mouthpiece. Indeed,\r\nintimately as we all now associate the name of Darwin with the word\r\n'evolution,' that term itself (whose vogue is almost entirely due to Mr.\r\nSpencer's influence) was one but rarely found upon Darwin's own lips,\r\nand but rarely written by his own pen. He speaks rather of development\r\nand of natural selection than of evolution: his own concern was more\r\nwith its special aspect as biological modification than with its general\r\naspect as cosmical unfolding. Let us ask, then, from this wider\r\nstandpoint of a great and far-reaching mental revolution, what was\r\nCharles Darwin's exact niche in the evolutionary movement of the two\r\nlast centuries?\r\n\r\nEvolutionism, as now commonly understood, may be fairly regarded as a\r\nmode of envisaging to ourselves the history of the universe, a tendency\r\nor frame of mind, a temperament, one might almost say, or habit of\r\nthought rather than a definite creed or body of dogmas. The evolutionist\r\nlooks out upon the cosmos as a continuous process unfolding itself in\r\nregular order in obedience to definite natural laws. He sees in it all,\r\nnot a warring chaos restrained by the constant interference from without\r\nof a wise and beneficent external power, but a vast aggregate of\r\noriginal elements, perpetually working out their own fresh\r\nredistribution, in accordance with their own inherent energies. He\r\nregards the cosmos as an almost infinite collection of material atoms,\r\nanimated by an almost infinite sum-total of energy, potential or\r\nkinetic.\r\n\r\nIn the very beginning, so far as the mental vision of the astronomer can\r\ndimly pierce with hypothetical glance the abyss of ages, the matter\r\nwhich now composes the material universe seems to have existed in a\r\nhighly diffuse and nebulous condition. The gravitative force, however,\r\nwith which every atom of the whole vast mass was primarily endowed,\r\ncaused it gradually to aggregate around certain fixed and definite\r\ncentres, which became in time the rallying-points or nuclei of future\r\nsuns. The primitive potential energy of separation in the atoms of the\r\nmass was changed into actual energy of motion as they drew closer and\r\ncloser together about the common centre, and into molecular energy or\r\nheat as they clashed with one another in bodily impact around the\r\nhardening core. Thus arose stars and suns, composed of fiery atomic\r\nclouds in a constant state of progressive concentration, ever\r\ngathering-in the hem of their outer robes on the surface of the solid\r\nglobe within, and ever radiating off their store of associated energy to\r\nthe impalpable and hypothetical surrounding ether. This, in necessarily\r\nbrief and shadowy abstract, is the nebular theory of Kant and Laplace,\r\nas amended and supplemented by the modern doctrine of the correlation\r\nand conservation of energies.\r\n\r\nApplied to the solar system, of which our own planet forms a component\r\nmember, the evolutionary doctrine (in its elder shape) teaches us to\r\nenvisage that minor group as the final result of a single great diffuse\r\nnebula, which once spread its faint and cloud-like mass with\r\ninconceivable tenuity, at least as far from its centre, now occupied by\r\nthe sun's body, as the furthest point in the orbit of Neptune, the\r\noutermost of the yet known planets. From this remote and immense\r\nperiphery it has gradually gathered itself in, growing denser and denser\r\nall the time, towards its common core, and has left behind, at irregular\r\nintervals, concentric rings or belts of nebulous matter, which, after\r\nrupturing at their weakest point, have hardened and concentrated round\r\ntheir own centre of gravity into Jupiter, Saturn, the Earth, or Venus.\r\nThe main central body of all, retreating ever within as it dropped in\r\nits course the raw material of the planetary masses, has formed, at\r\nlast, the sun, the great ruler and luminary of our system. Much as this\r\nprimitive evolutionary concept of the development and history of the\r\nsolar system has been modified and altered of late years by recent\r\nresearches into the nature of comets and meteors and of the sun's\r\nsurface, it still remains for all practical purposes of popular\r\nexposition the best and simplest mental picture of the general type of\r\nastronomical evolution. For the essential point which it impresses upon\r\nthe mind is the idea of the planets in their several orbits and with\r\ntheir attendant satellites as due, not to external design and special\r\ncreation, in the exact order in which we now see them, but to the slow\r\nand regular working out of preordained physical laws, in accordance with\r\nwhich they have each naturally assumed, by pure force of circumstances,\r\ntheir existing size, and weight, and orbit, and position.\r\n\r\nGeology has applied a similar conception to the origin and becoming of\r\nthe earth's material and external features as we now know them.\r\nAccepting from astronomy the notion of our planet's primary condition as\r\na cooling sphere of incandescent matter, it goes on to show how the two\r\ngreat envelopes, atmospheric and oceanic, gaseous and liquid, have\r\ngradually formed around its solid core; how the hard crust of the\r\ncentral mass has been wrinkled and corrugated into mountain chain and\r\ndeep-cut valley, uplifted here into elevated table-land or there\r\ndepressed into hollow ocean bed; how sediment has slowly gathered on the\r\nfloor of the sea, and how volcanic energies or lateral pressure have\r\nsubsequently forced up the resulting deposits into Alpine peaks and\r\nmassive continents. In this direction, it was Lyell who principally\r\nintroduced into science the uniformitarian or evolutionary principle,\r\nwho substituted for the frequent cataclysms and fresh beginnings of the\r\nearlier geologists the grand conception of continuous action, producing\r\nfrom comparatively infinitesimal but cumulative causes effects which at\r\nlast attain by accretion the most colossal proportions.\r\n\r\nHere biology next steps in, with its splendid explanation of organic\r\nlife, as due essentially to the secondary action of radiated solar\r\nenergy on the outer crust of such a cooling and evolving planet. Falling\r\non the cells of the simplest green plants, the potent sunlight\r\ndissociates the carbon from the oxygen in the carbonic acid floating in\r\nthe atmosphere, and builds it up with the hydrogen of water in the\r\ntissues of the organism into starches and other organic products, which\r\ndiffer from the inert substances around them, mainly by the possession\r\nof locked-up solar energy. On the energy-yielding food-stuffs thus\r\nstored up the animal in turn feeds and battens, reducing what was before\r\npotential into actual motion, just as the steam-engine reduces the\r\nlatent solar energy of coal into visible heat and visible movement in\r\nits furnace and its machinery. How the first organism came to exist\r\nbiology has not yet been able fully to explain for us; but aided by\r\nchemical science it has been able to show us in part how some of the\r\nsimpler organic bodies may have been originally built up, and it does\r\nnot despair of showing us in the end how the earliest organism may\r\nactually have been produced from the prime elements of oxygen, hydrogen,\r\nnitrogen, and carbon. Into this most fundamental of biological problems,\r\nhowever, Darwin himself, with his constitutional caution and dread of\r\nspeculative theorising, was not careful or curious to enter. Even upon\r\nthe far less abstruse and hypothetical question, whether all life took\r\nits prime origin from a single starting-point or from several distinct\r\nand separate tribal ancestors, he hardly cared so much as to hazard a\r\npassing speculation. With splendid self-restraint he confined his\r\nattention almost entirely to the more manageable and practical problem\r\nof the origin of species by natural selection, which lay then and there\r\nopen for solution before him. Taking for granted the existence of the\r\noriginal organism or group of organisms, the fact of reproduction, and\r\nthe tendency of such reproduction to beget increase in a geometrical\r\nratio, he deduced from these elementary given factors the necessary\r\ncorollary of survival of the fittest, with all its marvellous and\r\nfar-reaching implications of adaptation to the environment and specific\r\ndistinctions. By doing so, he rendered conceivable the mechanism of\r\nevolution in the organic world, thus bringing another great aspect of\r\nexternal nature within the range of the developmental as opposed to the\r\nmiraculous philosophy of the cosmos.\r\n\r\nPsychology, once more, in the hands of Herbert Spencer and his\r\nfollowers, not wholly unaided by Darwin himself, has extended the\r\nself-same evolutionary treatment to the involved and elusive phenomena\r\nof mind, and has shown how from the simplest unorganised elements of\r\nfeeling, the various mental powers and faculties as we now know them,\r\nboth on the intellectual and on the emotional side, have been slowly\r\nbuilt up in the long and ever-varying interaction between the sentient\r\norganism and the natural environment. It has traced the first faint\r\ninception of a nervous system as a mere customary channel of\r\ncommunication between part and part; the gradual growth of fibre and\r\nganglion; the vague beginnings of external sense-organ and internal\r\nbrain; the final perfection of eye and ear, of sight and hearing, of\r\npleasure and pain, of intellect and volition. It has thus done for the\r\nsubjective or mental half of our complex nature what biology, as\r\nconceived by Darwin, has done for the physical or purely organic half;\r\nit has traced the origin and development of mind, without a single\r\nbreak, from its first faint and half-unconscious manifestation in the\r\npolyp or the jelly-fish to its final grand and varied outcome in the\r\nsoul of the poet or the intellect of the philosopher.\r\n\r\nFinally, sociology has applied the evolutionary method to the origin and\r\nrise of human societies, with their languages, customs, arts, and\r\ninstitutions, their governmental organisation and their ecclesiastical\r\npolity. Taking from biology the evolving savage, viewed as a developed\r\nand highly gifted product of the anthropoid stock, it has shown by what\r\nstages and through what causes he has slowly aggregated into tribes and\r\nnations; has built up his communal, polygamic, or monogamic family; has\r\nlearnt the use of fire, of implements, of pottery, of metals; has\r\ndeveloped the whole resources of oral speech and significant gesture;\r\nhas invented writing, pictorial or alphabetic; has grown up to science,\r\nto philosophy, to morals, and to religion. The chief honours of this\r\nparticular line of enquiry, the latest and youngest of all to receive\r\nthe impact of the evolutionary impulse, belong mainly to Tylor, Lubbock,\r\nand Spencer in England, and to Haeckel, De Mortillet, and Wagner on the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIn the sublime conception of the external universe and its present\r\nworkings which we thus owe to the independent efforts of so many great\r\nprogressive thinkers, and which has here been briefly and inadequately\r\nsketched out, Darwin's work in life falls naturally into its own place\r\nas the principal contribution to the evolutionary movement in the\r\nspecial biological department of thought. Within the more limited range\r\nof that department itself, the evolutionary impulse did not owe its\r\norigin to Charles Darwin personally; it took its rise with Erasmus\r\nDarwin, Buffon, and Lamarck, and it derived from our great modern\r\nEnglish naturalist its final explanation and definitive proof alone. But\r\njust as the evolutionary movement in astronomy and cosmical thought is\r\nrightly associated in all our minds with the mighty theories of Kant,\r\nLaplace, and Herschel; just as the evolutionary movement in geology is\r\nrightly associated with the far lesser yet brilliant and effective\r\npersonality of Lyell; just as the evolutionary movement in the\r\nderivative sciences is rightly associated with so many great still\r\nliving thinkers; so the evolutionary movement in biology in particular\r\nrightly sums itself up in the honoured name of Charles Darwin. For what\r\nothers suspected, he was the first to prove; where others speculated, he\r\nwas the first to observe, to experiment, to demonstrate, and to\r\nconvince.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, too, that while to us who come after, the great\r\ncomplex evolutionary movement of the two last centuries justly reveals\r\nitself as one and indivisible, a single grand cosmical drama, having\r\nmany acts and many scenes, but all alike inspired by one informing and\r\npervading unity, yet to those whose half unconscious co-operation slowly\r\nbuilt it up by episodes, piecemeal, each act and each scene unrolled\r\nitself separately as an end in itself, to be then and there attained and\r\nproved, quite apart from the conception of its analytic value as a part\r\nin a great harmonious natural poem of the constitution of things. Though\r\nevolution appears to us now as a single grand continuous process, a\r\nphase of the universe dependent upon a preponderating aggregation of\r\nmatter and dissipation of energy, yet to Kant and Laplace it was the\r\nastronomical aspect alone that proved attractive, to Darwin it was the\r\nbiological aspect alone, and to many of the modern workers in the minor\r\nfields it is the human and sociological aspect that almost monopolises\r\nthe whole wide mental horizon. No greater proof can be given of the\r\nsubjective distinctness of parts in what was objectively and\r\nfundamentally a single broad psychological revolution of the human mind,\r\nthan the fact that Lyell himself, who more than any one man had\r\nintroduced the evolutionary conception into the treatment of geology,\r\nshould have stood out so long and fought so blindly against the\r\nevolutionary conception in the organic world. Indeed, it was not until\r\nthe various scattered and many-coloured strands of evolutionary thought\r\nhad been gathered together and woven into one by the vast catholic and\r\nsynthetic intelligence of Herbert Spencer that the idea of evolution as\r\na whole, as a single continuous cosmical process, began to be\r\napprehended and gradually assimilated by the picked intelligences of the\r\nseveral distinct scientific departments.\r\n\r\nObserve also that the evolutionary method has invaded each of the\r\nconcrete sciences in the exact order of their natural place in the\r\nhierarchy of knowledge. It had been applied to astronomy by Kant and\r\nLaplace before it was applied to geology by Lyell; it had been applied\r\nto geology by Lyell before it was applied to biology by Darwin; it had\r\nbeen applied to biology (in part, at least) by Lamarck and the Darwins\r\nbefore it was applied to psychology by Spencer; and it is only at the\r\nvery end of all that it has been applied to sociology and the allied\r\nbranches of thought by a hundred different earnest workers in\r\ncontemporary Europe. Each stage helped on the next; each was dependent\r\nonly on those that went naturally before it, and aided in turn the\r\nsubsequent development of those that naturally came after it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the popular instinct which regards Darwinism and evolution\r\nas practically synonymous is to a large extent justified by the actual\r\nfacts of the psychological upheaval. Darwin's work forms on the whole\r\nthe central keystone of the evolutionary system, and deserves the honour\r\nwhich has been thrust upon it of supporting by its own mass the entire\r\nsuperstructure of the development theory.\r\n\r\nFor, in the first place, Darwin had to deal with the science of life,\r\nthe science where the opposition to evolutionism was sure to be\r\nstrongest, and where the forces and tendencies in favour of obscurantism\r\nwere sure to gather in fullest force. Every other great onward step in\r\nour knowledge of our own relation to the universe of which we form a\r\npart had been compelled indeed to run the gauntlet, in its own time, of\r\necclesiastical censure and of popular dislike. Those inveterate\r\nprejudices of human ignorance which sedulously hide their genuine shape\r\nunder the guise of dogma masquerading as religion, had long since\r\nbrought to bear their baneful resources upon the discoveries of\r\nCopernicus and the theories of Galileo, as blind, misleading, and\r\ndiabolical lights, opposed to the sure and certain warranty of Holy\r\nScripture. Newton, again, had in due time been blamed in that he boldly\r\nsubstituted (as his critics declared) the bald and barren formula of\r\ngravitation for the personal superintendence of a divine Providence.\r\nLaplace had been accused of dethroning the deity from the centre and\r\ngovernance of his celestial system. Around the early geologists the\r\nbattle of the six days of creation had raged fiercely for nearly half a\r\ncentury. But all these varying modes of thought, though deemed heretical\r\nenough in their own day, had touched, as it were, but the minor\r\nramparts and unimportant out-works of the great obscurantist dogmatic\r\nstrongholds: Darwinism, by openly attacking the inmost problems of life\r\nand mind, had brought to bear its powerful artillery upon the very keep\r\nand highest tower of the fortress itself. The belief that the various\r\nstars, planets, and satellites had or had not been wisely created in\r\ntheir existing positions, and with their present orbits, movements, and\r\nrelations accurately fore-measured, did not fundamentally affect, for\r\ngood or evil, the cherished dogmas of the ordinary multitude. But the\r\nanalogous belief in the distinct and separate creation of plants and\r\nanimals, and more especially of the human species, was far more closely\r\nand intimately bound up with all the current religious conceptions. It\r\nwas at first supposed, not perhaps without some practical wisdom, that\r\nto upset the primitive faith in the separate creation of living beings\r\nwas to loosen and imperil the very foundations of common morality and\r\nrevealed religion. The 'argument from design' had been immemorially\r\nregarded as the principal buttress of orthodox thought. Theologians had\r\nunwisely staked their all upon the teleological dogma, and could ill\r\nafford to retire without a blow from that tenaciously defended bastion\r\nof their main position. Hence the evolutionary concept had its hardest\r\nfight to wage over the biological field; and when that field was once\r\nfairly won, it had little more to fear from banded preconceptions and\r\nestablished prejudices in any other portion of the wide territory it\r\nclaimed for its own.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, biological evolution, firmly established by Darwin\r\non a safe, certain, and unimpeachable basis, led naturally and almost\r\ninevitably to all the other innumerable applications of the\r\nevolutionary method, in the domains of psychology, sociology, philology,\r\npolitical thought, and ethical science. Hence the immediate and visible\r\nresults of its promulgation have been far more striking, noticeable, and\r\nevident than those which followed the establishment of the evolutionary\r\nconception in the astronomical and geological departments. It was\r\npossible to accept cosmical evolution and solar evolution and planetary\r\nevolution, without at the same time accepting evolution in the\r\nrestricted field of life and mind. But it was impossible to accept\r\nevolution in biology without at the same time extending its application\r\nto psychology, to the social organism, to language, to ethics, to all\r\nthe thousand and one varied interests of human life and human\r\ndevelopment. Now, most people are little moved by speculations and\r\nhypotheses as to the origin of the milky way or the belt of Orion; they\r\ncare very slightly for Jupiter's moons or Saturn's rings; they are\r\nstolidly incurious as to the development of the earth's crust, or the\r\nprecise date of the cretaceous epoch; but they understand and begin to\r\nbe touched the moment you come to the practical questions of man's\r\norigin, nature, and history. Darwinism compelled their attention by its\r\nimmediate connection with their own race; and the proof of this truth is\r\namply shown by the mere fact that out of all the immense variety of\r\nCharles Darwin's theories and ideas, the solitary one which alone has\r\nsucceeded in attaching to itself the public interest and public ridicule\r\nis the theory of man's ultimate descent from a monkey-like ancestor.\r\nPopular instinct, here as elsewhere profoundly true at core in the midst\r\nof all its superficial foolishness, has rightly hit upon the central\r\nelement in the Darwinian conception which more than any other has caused\r\nits fruitful and wonderful expansion through every fertile field of\r\nhuman enquiry.\r\n\r\nIn short, it was Darwin's task in life to draw down evolution from\r\nheaven to earth, and to bring within the scope of its luminous method\r\nall that is most interesting to the uninstructed and unsophisticated\r\nheart of the natural man.\r\n\r\nThe application of the evolutionary principle to the world of life,\r\nhuman or animal, thus presents itself as the chief philosophic and\r\nscientific achievement of the nineteenth century. Throughout the whole\r\nmiddle decades of the present age, the human mind in all its highest\r\nembodiments was eagerly searching, groping, and enquiring after a\r\nnaturalistic explanation of the origin and progress of organic life. In\r\nthe vast scheme for the System of Synthetic Philosophy which Herbert\r\nSpencer set forth as an anticipatory synopsis of his projected work, the\r\nphilosopher of development leapt at once from the First Principles of\r\nevolution as a whole to the Principles of Biology, Psychology, and\r\nSociology, omitting all reference to the application of evolution to the\r\nvast field of inorganic nature; and he did so on the distinctly stated\r\nground that its application to organic nature was then and there more\r\nimportant and interesting. That suggestive expression of belief aptly\r\nsums up the general attitude of scientific and philosophic minds at the\r\nprecise moment of the advent of Darwinism. Kant and Laplace and Lyell\r\nhad already applied the evolutionary method to suns and systems, to\r\nplanets and continents; what was needed next was that some deeply\r\nlearned and universally equipped biological leader should help the lame\r\nevolutionism of Lamarck over the organic stile, and leave it free to\r\nroam the boundless fields of what Mr. Spencer has sometimes well\r\ndescribed as the super-organic sciences. For that office, Darwin at the\r\nexact moment presented himself; and his victory and its results rightly\r\nentitle him to the popular regard as the founder of all that most men\r\nmean when they speak together in everyday conversation of the doctrine\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the total esoteric philosophic conception of\r\nevolution as a cosmical process, one and continuous from nebula to man,\r\nfrom star to soul, from atom to society, we owe rather to the other\r\ngreat prophet of the evolutionary creed, Herbert Spencer, whose name\r\nwill ever be equally remembered side by side with his mighty peer's, in\r\na place of high collateral glory. It is he who has given us the general\r\ndefinition of evolution as a progress from an indefinite, incoherent\r\nhomogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity, accompanying an\r\nintegration of matter and dissipation of motion, or, as we should now\r\nperhaps more correctly say, of energy. In the establishment of the\r\nvarious lines of thought which merge at last in that magnificent\r\ncosmical law, it was Darwin's special task to bring the phenomena of\r\norganic life well within the clear ken of known and invariable natural\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE NET RESULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now let us ask ourselves, in all sincerity, what was the final\r\noutcome and net result of Darwin's great and useful life?\r\n\r\nIf Charles Darwin had never existed at all, there would still have been\r\na considerable and expansive evolutionary movement both in biology and\r\nin its sister sciences throughout the latter half of the present\r\ncentury. The harvest indeed was ready, and the labourers, though few,\r\nwere full of vigour. Suppose for a moment that that earnest and\r\nsingle-hearted Darwinian genius had been cut off by some untimely\r\ndisease of childhood at five years old, all other conditions remaining\r\nas they were, we should even so have had in our midst to-day, a small\r\nphilosophical and influential band of evolutionary workers. Spencer\r\nwould none the less have given us his 'First Principles' and the major\r\npart of his 'Principles of Biology,' with comparatively little\r\nalteration or omission. Wallace would none the less have promulgated his\r\ninchoate theory of natural selection, and rallied round his primordial\r\nconception the very best and deepest minds of the biological fraction.\r\nGeology would have enforced the continuity of types; Cope and Marsh\r\nwould have unearthed for our edification the ancestral forms of the\r\nevolving horse and the toothed birds of the Western American deposits.\r\nThe Solenhofen lithographic slates would still have yielded us the\r\nhalf-reptilian, half-avian Archæopteryx; the tertiary deposits would\r\nstill have presented us with a long suite of gradually specialised and\r\nmodified mammalian forms. The Siberian meadows would have sent us that\r\nintermediate creature which Prjevalsky recognises as the half-way house\r\nbetween the horses and the donkeys; the rivers of Queensland would have\r\ndisclosed to our view that strange lung-bearing and gill-breathing\r\nbarramunda, in which Günther discerns the missing link between the\r\nganoid fishes on the one hand, and the mudfish and salamandroid\r\namphibians on the other. From data such as these, biologists and\r\npalæontologists of the calibre of Huxley, Gaudry, Geikie, Rütimeyer, and\r\nBusk, would necessarily have derived, by the aid of Wallace's pregnant\r\nprinciple, conclusions not so very far remote from Darwin's own. Heer\r\nand Saporta would have drawn somewhat similar inferences from the fossil\r\nflora of Switzerland and of Greenland; Hooker and De Candolle would have\r\nread pretty much the self-same lessons in the scattered ferns and scanty\r\npalm-trees of oceanic islands. Kowalevsky would have seen in the\r\nascidian larva a common prototype of the vertebrate series; the\r\nfollowers of Von Baer would have popularised the embryological\r\nconception of the single origin of animal life. The researches of\r\nBoucher de Perthes, of Lyell, of Evans, of Boyd Dawkins, of Keller, and\r\nof Christy and Lartet, would have unrolled before our eyes, under any\r\ncircumstances, the strange story of prehistoric man. On the facts so\r\ngained, Lubbock and Tylor, Schaafhausen and Büchner, would have built up\r\ntheir various consistent theories of human development and human\r\nculture. In short, even without Charles Darwin, the nineteenth century\r\nwould not have stood still; it would have followed in the wake of Buffon\r\nand Diderot, of Lamarck and Laplace, of St. Hilaire and Goethe, of Kant\r\nand Herschel, of Hutton and Lyell, of Malthus and of Spencer. The great\r\nworld never rolls down the abysses of time obedient to the nod of one\r\nsingle overruling Titanic intellect. 'If the doctrine of evolution had\r\nnot existed,' says Huxley, 'palæontologists must have invented it.'\r\n\r\nBut Charles Darwin acted, nevertheless, the part of an immense and\r\npowerful accelerating energy. The impetus which he gave gained us at\r\nleast fifty years of progress; it sent us at a bound from Copernicus to\r\nNewton; so far as ordinary minds were concerned, indeed, it transcended\r\nat a single leap the whole interval from Ptolemy to Herschel. The\r\ncomparison is far from being a mere rhetorical one. A close analogy\r\nreally exists between the two cases. Before Copernicus, the earth stood\r\nfixed and immovable in the centre of the universe, with obsequious suns,\r\nand planets, and satellites dancing attendance in cycle and epicycle\r\naround the solid mass, to which by day and night they continually\r\nministered. The great astronomical revolution begun by Copernicus,\r\nGalileo, and Kepler, and completed by Newton, Laplace, and Herschel,\r\nreduced the earth to its true position as a petty planet, revolving\r\nfeebly among its bigger brethren round a petty sun, in some lost corner\r\nof a vast, majestic, and almost illimitable galaxy. Even so, before\r\nDarwin, man stood in his own esteem the fixed point of an\r\nanthropocentric universe, divinely born and divinely instructed, with\r\nall the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air, and the fruits of\r\nthe earth specially created with a definite purpose in subservience to\r\nhis lordly wants and interests. The great biological revolution, which\r\nrightly almost sums itself up in the name of Darwin, reduced man at once\r\nto his true position as the last product of kinetic solar energy,\r\nworking upon the peculiar chemical elements of an evolving planet. It\r\nshowed that every part of every plant and every animal existed primarily\r\nfor the sake of that plant or animal alone; it unseated man from his\r\nimaginary throne in the centre of the cosmos, teaching him at once a\r\nlesson of humility and a lesson of aspiration--pointing out to him how\r\nlow was the origin from which, in very truth, he first sprang, and\r\nsuggesting to him, at the same time, how high was the grand and glorious\r\ndestiny to which by his own strenuous and ardent efforts he might yet\r\nperchance some day attain.\r\n\r\nThat result, inevitable perhaps in the long run, from the slow unfolding\r\nof human intelligence, was immensely hastened in our own time by the\r\npeculiar idiosyncrasy and lofty personality of Charles Darwin. Without\r\nhim we should have had, not only evolutionism, but also, as Wallace's\r\ndiscovery testifies, natural selection itself into the bargain. But we\r\nshould never have had the 'Origin of Species.' We should never have had\r\nthat vast and enthusiastic consensus of scientific opinion through an\r\nall but unanimous thinking world, which has forced an immediate\r\nacceptance of evolutionary ideas down the unwilling throats of half\r\nunthinking Europe. The prodigious mass of Darwin's facts, the cautious\r\nworking of Darwin's intellect, the immense weight of Darwin's\r\nreputation, the crushing force of Darwin's masterly inductive method,\r\nbore down before them all opposition in the inner circle of biologists,\r\nand secured the triumph of the evolutionary system even in the very\r\nstrongholds of ignorance and obscurantism. Without Darwin, a small group\r\nof philosophic thinkers would still be striving to impress upon an\r\nincredulous and somewhat contemptuous world the central truths of the\r\nevolutionary doctrine. The opposition of the elders, long headed even in\r\nthe society we actually know by a few stern scientific recalcitrants,\r\nlike Owen and Agassiz, Pictet and Dawson, Virchow and Mivart, would have\r\nfought desperately in the last trench for the final figment of the\r\nfixity of species. What is now the general creed, more or less loosely\r\nheld and imperfectly understood, of hundreds and thousands among the\r\nintelligent mass, would, under such circumstances, be even yet the mere\r\nparty-shibboleth of an esoteric few, struggling hard against the bare\r\nforce of overwhelming numbers to ensure not only recognition but a fair\r\nhearing for the first principles of the development theory. It is to\r\nDarwin, and to Darwin almost alone, that we owe the present\r\ncomparatively wide acceptance of the all-embracing doctrine of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nNo other man did so much or could have done so much to ensure its\r\ntriumph. He began early in life to collect and arrange a vast\r\nencyclopædia of facts, all finally focussed with supreme skill upon the\r\ngreat principle he so clearly perceived, and so lucidly expounded. He\r\nbrought to bear upon the question an amount of personal observation, of\r\nminute experiment, of world-wide book-knowledge, of universal scientific\r\nability, such as never perhaps was lavished by any other man upon any\r\nother department of study. His conspicuous and beautiful love of truth,\r\nhis unflinching candour, his transparent fearlessness and honesty of\r\npurpose, his child-like simplicity, his modesty of demeanour, his\r\ncharming manner, his affectionate disposition, his kindliness to friends,\r\nhis courtesy to opponents, his gentleness to harsh and often bitter\r\nassailants, kindled in the minds of men of science everywhere throughout\r\nthe world a contagious enthusiasm, only equalled perhaps among the\r\ndisciples of Socrates and the great teachers of the revival of learning.\r\nHis name became a rallying-point for the children of light in every\r\ncountry; and what philosophers and speculators might have taken a\r\ncentury or two more to establish in embryo was firmly grounded, never to\r\nbe overthrown, by the vast accumulations of fact and argument in the\r\n'Origin of Species,' and its companion volumes.\r\n\r\nThe end of that great Darwinian revolution the world has not yet seen:\r\nin a sense, indeed, it will never see it. For the general acceptance of\r\nDarwin's theory, which we may watch progressing around us every minute\r\nto-day, implies a complete _bouleversement_ of anthropocentric ideas, a\r\ntotal change in our human conception of our own relations to the world\r\nand the universe, which must work out for ever increasingly\r\nwide-reaching and complex effects in all our dealings with one another\r\nand with the environment at large. There is no department of human\r\nthought or human action which evolutionism leaves exactly where it\r\nstood before the advent of the Darwinian conception. In nothing is this\r\nfact more conspicuously seen than in the immediate obsolescence (if one\r\nmay so speak) of all the statical pre-Darwinian philosophies which\r\nignored development, as soon as ever the new progressive evolutionary\r\ntheories had fairly burst upon an astonished world. Dogmatic Comte was\r\nleft forthwith to his little band of devoted adherents; shadowy Hegel\r\nwas relegated with a bow to the cool shades of the common-rooms of\r\nOxford; Buckle was exploded like an inflated wind-bag; even Mill\r\nhimself--_magnum et venerabile nomen_--with all his mighty steam-hammer\r\nforce of logical directness, was felt instinctively to be lacking in\r\nfull appreciation of the dynamic and kinetic element in universal\r\nnature. Spencer and Hartmann, Haeckel and Clifford, had the field to\r\nthemselves for the establishment of their essentially evolutionary\r\nsystems. Great thinkers of the elder generation, like Bain and Lyell,\r\nfelt bound to remodel their earlier conceptions by the light of the new\r\nDarwinian hypotheses. Those who failed by congenital constitution to do\r\nso, like Carlyle and Carpenter, were, philosophically speaking, left\r\nhopelessly behind and utterly extinguished. Those who only half\r\nsucceeded in thus reading themselves into the new ideas, like Lewes and\r\nMax Müller, lost ground immediately before the eager onslaught of their\r\nyounger competitors. 'The world is to the young,' says the eastern\r\nproverb; and in a world peopled throughout in the high places of thought\r\nby men almost without exception evolutionists, there was little or no\r\nplace for the timid group of stranded Girondins, who still stood aloof\r\nin sullen antique scientific orthodoxy from what seemed to them the\r\ncarmagnoles and orgies of a biological Thermidor.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it must be steadily remembered that there are many\r\nnaturalists at the present day, especially among those of the lower\r\norder of intelligence, who, while accepting evolutionism in a general\r\nway, and therefore always describing themselves as Darwinians, do not\r\nbelieve and often cannot even understand the distinctive Darwinian\r\naddition to the evolutionary doctrine--namely, the principle of natural\r\nselection. Such hazy and indistinct thinkers as these are still really\r\nat the prior stage of Lamarckian evolutionism. It is probable that in\r\nthe future, while a formal acceptance of Darwinism becomes general, the\r\nspecial theory of natural selection will be thoroughly understood and\r\nassimilated only by the more abstract and philosophical minds. Our\r\nchildren will be taught as a matter of course the doctrine of\r\ndevelopment or of descent with modification; but the rationale of that\r\ndescent will still remain in all likelihood always beyond the grasp of\r\nmost of them: just as thousands accept on authority the Copernican\r\nastronomy, who would never even be capable of comprehending the simplest\r\nproofs of the earth's annual movement round the sun. Thus the name of\r\nDarwin will often no doubt be tacked on to what are in reality the\r\nprinciples of Lamarck.\r\n\r\nEvery day, however, in spite of such half-ignorant adherents, the\r\neffects of true Darwinism are widening and deepening. One group of\r\nearnest workers is using it now as a guide to physiological,\r\nembryological, and anatomical researches. Another is employing it with\r\nzeal and skill in the field of classificatory and physiological botany.\r\nYet others are working out its psychological implications, enquiring\r\ninto instinct and animal intelligence, and solving by its aid abstruse\r\nproblems of the human mind and the human emotions. One philosopher has\r\nbrought it to bear on questions of ethics, another on questions of\r\nsocial and political economy. Its principles have been applied in one\r\nplace to æsthetics, in another place to logic, in a third place to the\r\norigin and growth of religion. The study of language has derived new\r\nlights from the great central Darwinian luminary. The art of education\r\nis beginning to feel the progressive influence of the Darwinian impulse.\r\nIn fact, there is hardly a single original worker in any department of\r\nthought or science who has not been more or less profoundly affected,\r\nwhether he knows it or whether he knows it not, by the vast spreading\r\nand circling wave of the Darwinian conceptions. All our ideas have been\r\nrevolutionised and evolutionised. The new notions are abroad in the\r\nworld, quickening with their fresh and vigorous germinal power the dry\r\nbones of all the sciences, all the arts, and all the philosophies.\r\n\r\nAnd evolutionism is gradually though slowly filtering downward. It is\r\npermeating the daily press of the nations, and gaining for its\r\nvocabulary a recognised place in the phraseology of the unlearned\r\nvulgar. Such expressions as 'natural selection,' 'survival of the\r\nfittest,' 'struggle for existence,' 'adaptation to the environment,' and\r\nall the rest of it, are becoming as household words upon the lips of\r\nthousands who only know the name of Darwin as a butt for the petty empty\r\njibes of infinitesimal cheap witlings. And Darwinism will trickle down\r\nstill through a thousand channels, by definite popularisation, and still\r\nmore by indefinite absorption into the common thought of universal\r\nhumanity, till it becomes part and parcel of the general inheritance,\r\nbred in our bone and burnt into our blood, an heir-loom of our race to\r\nall time and in all countries. Great thoughts like his do not readily\r\ndie: they expand and grow in ten thousand bosoms, till they transform\r\nthe world at last into their own likeness, and adapt it to the\r\nenvironment they have themselves created by their informing power.\r\n\r\nHappy above ordinary human happiness, Charles Darwin lived himself to\r\nsee the prosperous beginning of this great silent philosophical\r\nrevolution. Harvey's grand discovery, it has been well said, was scoffed\r\nat for nearly a whole generation. Newton's marvellous law of gravitation\r\nwas coldly received even by the gigantic intellect of Leibnitz himself.\r\nFrancis Bacon, in disgrace and humiliation, could only commend his name\r\nand memory 'to foreign nations and to the next age.' It is too often so\r\nwith thinkers of the first and highest order: it was not so, happily,\r\nwith the gentle soul of Charles Darwin. Alone among the prophets and\r\nteachers of triumphant creeds, he saw with his own eyes the adoption of\r\nthe faith he had been the first to promulgate in all its fulness by\r\nevery fresh and powerful mind of the younger race that grew up around\r\nhim. The Nestor of evolutionism, he had lived among two successive\r\ngenerations of thinkers, and over the third he ruled as king.
