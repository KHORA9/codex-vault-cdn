A._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITORS' ANNOUNCEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of specialization makes it impossible for one author\r\nto cover satisfactorily the whole field of modern Biology. This\r\nsituation, which exists in all the sciences, has induced English authors\r\nto issue series of monographs in Biochemistry, Physiology, and Physics.\r\nA number of American biologists have decided to provide the same\r\nopportunity for the study of Experimental Biology.\r\n\r\nBiology, which not long ago was purely descriptive and speculative, has\r\nbegun to adopt the methods of the exact sciences, recognizing that for\r\npermanent progress not only experiments are required but quantitative\r\nexperiments. It will be the purpose of this series of monographs to\r\nemphasize and further as much as possible this development of Biology.\r\n\r\nExperimental Biology and General Physiology are one and the same\r\nscience, in method as well as content, since both aim at explaining life\r\nfrom the physico-chemical constitution of living matter. The series of\r\nmonographs on Experimental Biology will therefore include the field of\r\ntraditional General Physiology.\r\n\r\n  JACQUES LOEB,\r\n  T. H. MORGAN,\r\n  W. J. V. OSTERHOUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nBioluminescence, the production of light by animals and plants, has\r\nalways excited the admiration of the layman and the wonder of the\r\nscientist. It is not surprising that an enormous literature dealing with\r\nthe subject has grown up. A large part of this literature, however, is\r\nmade up merely of reports that a certain animal is luminous, or records\r\nof especially brilliant phosphorescence of the sea. Among those who have\r\ninquired somewhat more carefully into the nature and causes of light\r\nproduction may be mentioned the names of Beijerinck, R. Boyle, Dahlgren,\r\nDubois, Ehrenberg, Krukenberg, Mangold, McDermott, Molisch, Panceri,\r\nPflueger, Phipson, Quatrefages, Spallanzani, and Trojan. Several of these\r\nmen have written comprehensive monographs on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this book to deal with every phase of\r\nbioluminescence. Volumes could be written on the evolutionary side of\r\nthe problem and the structure and uses of luminous organs. These\r\nquestions can only be touched upon. Neither is it my purpose to discuss\r\nthe ultimate cause of the light, whether due to vibration of electrons\r\nor to other causes. That problem must be left to the physicist, although\r\nit is highly probable that a study of animal light will give important\r\ninformation regarding the nature of light in general, and no theory of\r\nlight can be adequate which fails to take into account the extraordinary\r\npowers of luminous animals.\r\n\r\nWe shall be concerned largely with the physical characteristics of\r\nanimal light and the chemical processes underlying its production.\r\nGreat advances have been made since the first early guesses that the\r\nlight was due to phosphorus and was a kind of oxidation. Although the\r\nproblem cannot be considered as solved, it has been placed on a sound\r\nphysico-chemical basis. Some material is oxidized. Exactly what this\r\nmaterial is and why light accompanies its oxidation are the two more\r\nfundamental problems in the field of Bioluminescence. How far and with\r\nwhat success we have progressed toward a solution of these problems may\r\nbe seen from a perusal of the following pages.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to acknowledge the kindness of Dr. W. E. Forsythe\r\nof the Nela Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, in reading and criticizing the\r\nmanuscript of Chapter III, and of Professor Lyman of Harvard University\r\nfor a similar review of Chapter II. I am also deeply indebted to my wife\r\nfor reading the proof and to Dr. Jacques Loeb and Prof. W. J. V.\r\nOsterhout for many suggestions throughout the book. My thanks are also\r\ndue to Prof. C. Ishikawa of the Agricultural College, Imperial\r\nUniversity of Tokio, Japan, for his generous assistance in providing\r\n_Cypridina_ material. Finally I wish to acknowledge the support of the\r\nCarnegie Institution of Washington, through its director of Marine\r\nBiology, Dr. Alfred G. Mayor. Without this support much of the work\r\ndescribed in this book could not have been accomplished.\r\n\r\n  E. N. H.\r\n\r\n  PRINCETON, N.

Aristotle mentions\r\nthe light of dead fish and flesh and both Aristotle and Pliny that of\r\ndamp wood. Robert Boyle in 1667 made many experiments to show that the\r\nlight from all three sources, as well as that of the glowworm, is\r\ndependent upon a plentiful supply of air and drew an interesting\r\ncomparison between the light of shining wood and that of a glowing coal.\r\nBoyle had no means of finding out the true cause of the light and early\r\nviews of its nature were indeed fantastic. Even as late as 1800 Hulme\r\nconcludes from his experiments on phosphorescent fish that the light is\r\na \"constituent principle of marine fishes\" and the \"first that escapes\r\nafter the death of the fish.\" It was only in 1830 that Michaelis\r\nsuspected the light of dead fish to be the result of some living thing\r\nand in 1854 Heller gave the name _Sarcina noctiluca_ to the suspected\r\norganism. In 1875 Pflueger showed that nutrient media could be inoculated\r\nwith small amounts of luminous fish and that these would increase in\r\nsize, like bacterial colonies, and we now know that the light of all\r\ndead fish and flesh is due to luminous bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century it was surmised that the\r\nlight of damp wood was connected with fungus growth because of a\r\nsimilarity in smell. In 1854 Heller recognized minute strands, which he\r\ncalled _Rhizomorpha noctiluca_, as the actual source of the light. We\r\nnow know that all phosphorescent wood is due to the mycelium of various\r\nkinds of fungi and that sometimes the fruiting body of the fungus also\r\nproduces light.\r\n\r\nThe phosphorescence or \"burning of the sea,\" which is described by so\r\nmany of the older explorers, is also due entirely to living organisms,\r\nboth microscopic and macroscopic. The latter are mostly jelly-fish\r\n(_medusae_) or comb jellies (_Ctenophores_) and give rise to the larger,\r\nmore brilliant flashes of light often seen in the wake or about the\r\nsides of a steamer at night. The former are various species of\r\ndinoflagellates or cystoflagellates such as _Noctiluca_ (just visible to\r\nthe naked eye) which collect at the surface of the sea and often\r\nincrease in such numbers that the water is colored by day (usually pink\r\nor red) and shines like a sheet of fire when disturbed at night.\r\nAlthough _Noctiluca_ was recognized as a luminous animal in 1753 by\r\nBaker, the light of the sea was a mysterious phenomenon to the older\r\nobservers. MacCartney, speaking before the Royal Society in 1810,\r\noutlines the various older theories as follows: \"Many writers have\r\nascribed the light of the sea to other causes than luminous animals.\r\nMartin supposed it to be occasioned by putrefaction; Silberschlag\r\nbelieved it to be phosphoric; Prof. J. Mayer conjectured that the\r\nsurface of the sea imbibed light, which it afterwards discharged. Bajon\r\nand Gentil thought the light of the sea was electric, because it was\r\nexcited by friction.... I shall not trespass on the time of the Society\r\nto refute the above speculations; their authors have left them\r\nunsupported by either arguments or experiments, and they are\r\ninconsistent with all ascertained facts upon the subject. The remarkable\r\nproperty of emitting light during life is only met amongst animals of\r\nthe four last classes of modern naturalists, viz., mollusca, insects,\r\nworms, and zoophytes.\" MacCartney recognized the true cause of the\r\nlight, although he had little idea of the vast number of marine forms\r\nwhich are luminous and omits entirely any reference to the fishes, many\r\nof which produce a light of their own when living, apart from any\r\nbacterial infection.\r\n\r\nA survey of the animal kingdom discloses at least 36 orders containing\r\none or more forms known to produce light and several more orders\r\ncontaining species whose luminosity is doubtful. In the plant kingdom\r\nthere are two groups containing luminous forms. The distribution of\r\nluminous organisms is brought out in the accompanying classification of\r\nplants and animals. Those orders are printed in italics which contain\r\nspecies whose self-luminosity is fairly well established. It will be\r\nnoted that further subdivisions into orders is not given in classes of\r\nanimals which lack luminous forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\n_DISTRIBUTION OF LUMINOUS ORGANISMS IN PLANT AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS_\r\n\r\n  PLANT KINGDOM\r\n\r\n  I. _Thallophyta_\r\n    Algae\r\n      Cyanophyceae (Blue-green Algae)\r\n      Chlorophyceae (Green Algae)\r\n      Phaeophyceae (Brown Algae)\r\n      Rhodophyceae (Red Algae)\r\n    Lichenes (Lichens, symbiotic growth of algae and fungi)\r\n    _Fungi_\r\n      Myxomycetes (Slime moulds)\r\n      _Schizomycetes_ (Bacteria)\r\n        _Bacterium_, _Photobacterium_, _Bacillus_, Pseudomonas_,\r\n          _Micrococcus_, _Microspira_, _Vibrio_.\r\n      Phycomycetes (moulds)\r\n      Ascomycetes (Sac fungi, yeasts, some moulds)\r\n      _Basidiomycetes_ (Smuts, rusts, mushrooms)\r\n        Ustilaginae (Smuts)\r\n        Uridineae\r\n        Auriculariae (Judas ears)\r\n        Tremellineae (Jelly fungi)\r\n        _Hymenomycetes_ (Mushrooms)\r\n          _Agaricus_, _Armillaria_, _Pleurotus_, _Panus_, _Mycena_,\r\n            _Omphalia_,\r\n            _Locellina_, _Marasinium_, _Clitocybe_, _Corticium_.\r\n        Gasteromycetes (Stinkhorns and puff-balls)\r\n\r\n  II.

Many different\r\nspecies of phosphorescent bacteria have been described, differing in\r\ncultural characteristics and structural peculiarities and grouped in the\r\ngenera, _Bacterium_, _Photobacterium_, _Bacillus_, _Microspira_,\r\n_Pseudomonas_, _Micrococcus_, and _Vibrio_. Specific names indicating\r\ntheir light-producing power such as _phosphorescens_, _phosphoreum_,\r\n_luminosum_, _lucifera_, etc., have been applied.\r\n\r\nAll the fungi which are definitely known to produce light belong to the\r\n_Basidiomycetes_, the largest and most highly developed of the true\r\nfungi. Either the mycelium alone or the fruiting body alone, or both,\r\nmay be luminescent.\r\n\r\nAmong animals the best known forms are the dinoflagellates; _Noctiluca_;\r\nhydroids; jelly-fish; ctenophores; sea pens; _Chaetopterus_ and other\r\nmarine worms; earthworms; brittle stars; various crustaceans; myriapods;\r\nfireflies and glowworms, the larvae of fireflies; _Pholas dactylus_ and\r\n_Phyllirrhoe bucephala_, both molluscs; squid; _Pyrosoma_, a colonial\r\nascidian; and fishes.\r\n\r\nLuminous animals are all either marine or terrestrial forms. No examples\r\nof fresh water luminous organisms are known. Of marine forms, the great\r\nmajority are deep sea animals, and it is among these that the\r\ndevelopment of true luminous organs of a complicated nature is most\r\npronounced. Many of the luminous marine animals are to be found in the\r\nplankton, while the littoral luminous forms are in the minority. Some\r\nmembers of all the above groups are found at one or another of our\r\nmarine laboratories with the possible exception of _Pholas_,\r\n_Phyllirrhoe_ and squid. Although earthworms and myriapods which produce\r\nlight are found in the United States, they are rather rare and seldom\r\nobserved forms.\r\n\r\nNot only adult forms but the embryos and even the eggs of some animals\r\nare luminous. The egg of _Lampyris_ emits light within the ovary and\r\nfreshly laid eggs are quite luminous. The light does not come from\r\nluminous material of the luminous organ adhering to the egg when it is\r\nlaid but from within the egg itself. _Pyrophorus_ eggs are also\r\nluminous. The segmentation stages of _Ctenophores_ are luminous on\r\nstimulation, as noted by Allman (1862), Agassiz (1874) and Peters\r\n(1905), but the eggs themselves do not luminesce. _Schizopod larvae_\r\n(Trojan, 1907), _Copepod nauplii_ (Giesbrecht, 1895), _Chaetopterus\r\nlarvae_ (Enders, 1909), and brittle star _plutei_ (Mangold, 1907) also\r\nproduce light.\r\n\r\nApparently there is no rhyme or reason in the distribution of\r\nluminescence throughout the plant or animal kingdom. It is as if the\r\nvarious groups had been written on a blackboard and a handful of sand\r\ncast over the names. Where each grain of sand strikes, a luminous\r\nspecies appears. The _C[oe]lenterates_ have received most sand.\r\nLuminescence is more widespread in this phylum and more characteristic\r\nof the group as a whole than any other. Among the arthropods luminous\r\nforms crop up here and there in widely unrelated groups. In the\r\nmollusks, excluding the cephalopods, only two luminous species are\r\nknown. Several _phyla_ contain no luminous forms whatever. It is an\r\nextraordinary fact that one species in a genus may be luminous and\r\nanother closely allied species contain no trace of luminosity. There\r\nseems to have been no development of luminosity along direct\r\nevolutionary lines, although a more or less definite series of\r\ngradations with increasing structural complexity may be traced out among\r\nthe forms with highly developed luminous organs.\r\n\r\nWhile the accompanying list of luminous genera aims to be fairly\r\ncomplete, there are no doubt omissions and some inaccuracies in it.\r\nAnyone who has ever tried to determine what animal is responsible for\r\nthe occasional flashes of light observed on agitating almost any sample\r\nof sea water will realize how difficult it is to discover the luminous\r\nform among a host of non-luminous ones, especially if the animal is\r\nmicroscopic in size. It is not surprising, then, to find many false\r\nreports of luminous animals in the literature of the subject and we\r\ncannot be too careful in accepting as luminous a reported case. The\r\ndifficulty lies chiefly in the fact that all luminous organisms with the\r\nexception of bacteria, fungi, and a few fish, flash only on stimulation,\r\nand, while it is easy enough to see the flash, the animal is lost\r\nbetween the flashes. The only safe way to detect luminous organisms is\r\nto add a little ammonia to the sea water. This slowly kills the\r\norganisms and causes any luminous forms to glow with a steady,\r\ncontinuous light for some time, a condition accompanying the death of\r\nthe animal. Not all observers, however, have followed this method. One\r\nmust always be on guard against confusing the light from a supposed\r\nluminous form with the light from truly luminous organisms living upon\r\nit. The reported cases of luminosity among marine algae are now known to\r\nbe due to hydroids or unicellular organisms living on the alga.\r\n\r\nWe know also that many non-luminous forms may become infected with\r\nluminous bacteria, not only after death, but also while living, so that\r\ntheir luminescence is purely secondary. Giard and Billet (1889-90)\r\nsucceeded in inoculating many different kinds of amphipod crustacea\r\n(_Talitrus_, _Orchestia_, _Ligia_) and isopod crustacea (_Porcellio_,\r\n_Philoscia_) with luminous bacteria, in some cases passing the infection\r\nfrom one to the next through nine individuals. Curiously enough the\r\nbacterium did not produce light on artificial culture media but did when\r\ngrowing in the body of the crustacea, which were killed in about seven\r\ndays by the infection. The species of _Talitrus_ and _Orchestia_ might\r\neasily have been taken for truly luminous animals if not carefully\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nTarchanoff (1901) has injected luminous bacteria into the dorsal lymph\r\nsac of frogs with the result that the animals continued to glow for\r\nthree to four days, especially about the tongue. I remember once while\r\ncollecting luminous beetles in Cuba, I was astounded to find a frog\r\nwhich was luminous. Expecting this animal to be of great interest, I\r\nexamined it further only to find that the frog had just finished a\r\nhearty meal of fireflies, whose light was shining through the belly with\r\nconsiderable intensity.\r\n\r\nInfection with luminous bacteria is especially liable to occur in any\r\ndead marine animal. The flesh is an excellent culture medium. I have\r\nseen non-luminous species of squid, recently killed, covered with minute\r\ngrowing colonies, quite evenly spaced, so as to closely resemble\r\nluminous species whose light is restricted to scattered light organs\r\nover the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nIndeed Pierantoni (1918) has carried this idea to extremes. He believes\r\nthat in the luminous organs of fireflies, cephalopods and _Pyrosoma_,\r\nluminous symbiotic bacteria occur which are responsible for the light\r\nof these animals, and he claims in the case of cephalopods and\r\n_Pyrosoma_ to have been able to isolate these in pure culture on\r\nartificial culture media. In the firefly they can be seen but not grown\r\nand in luminous animals where no visible bacteria-like structures are\r\napparent he believes we are dealing with ultra-microscopic luminous\r\nbacteria similar to the pathogenic forms suspected in filterable\r\nviruses. While the assumption of ultra-microscopic organisms makes the\r\nrefutation of Pierantoni's views a somewhat hazardous task, no one can\r\ndeny that even an ultra-microscopic organism will be killed by boiling\r\nwith 20 per cent. (by wt.) HCl for 6 hours. As we shall see, the\r\nluminous material of _Cypridina_, an ostracod crustacean, can withstand\r\nsuch prolonged boiling with strong acid. The light of one animal at\r\nleast, and I believe many others also, cannot be due to any sort of\r\nsymbiotic organism.\r\n\r\nApart from these cases where light is actually produced but is not\r\nprimary, not produced by the animal itself, there are many forms whose\r\nsurface is so constituted as to produce interference colors. This is\r\ntrue in many cases among the birds and butterflies whose feathers and\r\nscales are iridescent. Some of these have been erroneously described as\r\nluminous. Perhaps the best known case among aquatic animals is\r\n_Sapphirina_, a marine copepod living at the surface of the sea, and\r\nespecially likely to be collected with other luminous forms. Its cuticle\r\nis so ruled with fine lines as to diffract the light and flash on moving\r\nmuch as a fire opal. Needless to say no trace of light is given off from\r\nthis animal in a totally dark room.\r\n\r\nIt has often been supposed that the eye of a cat or of other animals is\r\nluminous. The eyes of a moth, also, can be seen to glow like beads of\r\nfire when it is flying about a flame. Both of these cases are, however,\r\npurely reflection phenomena and due to reflection out of the eye again\r\nof light which has entered from some external source. The correct\r\nexplanation was given by Prevost in 1810. The eye of any animal is quite\r\ninvisible in absolute darkness. The same explanation applies to the\r\nmoss, _Schistostega_, which lives in dimly illuminated places and whose\r\ncells are almost spherical, constructed like a lens, so as to refract\r\nthe light and condense it on the chloroplasts at the bottom of the\r\ncells. Some of this light is reflected out of the cells again and gives\r\nthe appearance of self-luminosity. The alga, _Chromophyton rosanoffii_,\r\nis another example of apparent luminosity, due to reflection from almost\r\nspherical cells.\r\n\r\nThere are several light phenomena known which have nothing to do with\r\nliving organisms. Commonest of these is St. Elmo's fire (\"corposants\" of\r\nEnglish sailors), a glow accompanying a slow brush discharge of\r\nelectricity, which appears as a tip of light on masts of ships, spires\r\nof churches or even the fingers of the hand. It is best seen in winter\r\nduring and after snowstorms and is a purely electrical phenomenon.\r\n\r\nLess well known is the _Ignis fatuus_ (Will-o'-the-Wisp,\r\nJack-o'-Lantern, spunkie), a fire seen over marshes and stagnant pools,\r\nappearing as a pale bluish flame which may be fixed or move, steady or\r\nintermittent. So uncommon is this phenomenon that its nature is not well\r\nunderstood, but it is believed to be the result of burning _phosphine_\r\n(PH_{3} + P_{2}H_{4}), a self-inflammable gas, generated in some way\r\nfrom the decomposition of organic matter in the swamp. The difficulty\r\nwith this explanation is that phosphine is not known as a decomposition\r\nproduct of organized matter. Methane (CH_{4}), a well-known\r\ndecomposition product of organic matter and abundantly formed in swamps,\r\nwill burn with a pale bluish flame and some have thought the _Ignis\r\nfatuus_ to be the result of this gas. As methane is not self-inflammable\r\nthere remains the difficulty of explaining how it becomes lighted.\r\nAlthough still a mystery, it is possible that this light is also of\r\nelectrical origin or that in some cases large clusters of luminous fungi\r\nhave been observed.\r\n\r\nThe flashing of flowers, especially those of a red or orange color, like\r\nthe poppy, which many observers have noticed during twilight hours, is a\r\npurely subjective phenomenon due to the formation of after images in\r\neyes partially adapted to the dark. This flashing, first observed by the\r\ndaughter of Linnaeus, is never observed in total darkness or in the\r\ndirect field of vision, but only in the indirect field as during a\r\nsidelong glance at the plant.\r\n\r\nThere are some cases of luminosity on record in connection with man\r\nhimself. (See Heller, 1854). Before the days of aseptic and antiseptic\r\nsurgery, wounds frequently became infected with luminous bacteria and\r\nglowed at night. The older surgeons even supposed that luminous wounds\r\nwere more apt to heal properly than non-luminous ones. We know that\r\nluminous bacteria are non-pathogenic, harmless organisms and the\r\npresence of these forms even on dead fish or flesh never accompanies but\r\nalways precedes putrefaction. As recorded by Robert Boyle, no harm has\r\ncome from eating luminous meat, unless it may also have become infected\r\nwith pathogenic forms.\r\n\r\nA few cases of luminous individuals have been noted in which the skin\r\nwas the source of light, especially if the person sweated freely. It is\r\npossible that here we are again dealing with luminous bacteria upon the\r\naccumulations of substances passed out in the sweat, which serves as a\r\nnutrient medium.\r\n\r\nThere are also on record, in the older literature, cases of luminous\r\nurine, where the urine when freshly voided was luminous. If these\r\nobservations are correct and they may, perhaps, be doubted, we are at\r\npresent uncertain of the cause of the light. Bacterial infections of the\r\nbladder are not inconceivable although luminous bacteria are strongly\r\naerobic and would not thrive under anaerobic conditions. I can state\r\nfrom my own experiments that luminous bacteria will live in normal human\r\nurine, but not well. In albuminous urines it is very likely that they\r\nwould live better, and it is possible that the luminous urines reported\r\nare the results of luminous bacterial infection. On the other hand, the\r\nlight may be purely chemical, due to the oxidation of some compound, an\r\nabnormal incompletely oxidized product of metabolism, which oxidizes\r\nspontaneously in the air. We know that sometimes these errors in\r\nmetabolism occur, as in _alkaptonuria_, where homogentistic acid is\r\nexcreted in the urine and on contact with the air quickly oxidizes to a\r\ndark brown substance. Light, however, has never been reported to\r\naccompany the oxidation of homogentistic acid, although it does\r\naccompany the oxidation of some other organic compounds. (See Chapter\r\nII.)\r\n\r\nFinally, we may inquire to what extent luminous animals may be utilized\r\nby man. Leaving out of account the use of tropical fireflies for\r\nadornment by the natives of the West Indies and South America and the\r\nuse for bait, in fishing, of the luminous organ of a fish,\r\n_Photoblepharon_, by the Banda islanders, we find that luminous bacteria\r\nare of value for certain purposes in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThese methods are all due to Beijerinck (1889, 1902). He has, for\r\ninstance, used luminous bacteria for testing bacterial filters. If there\r\nis a crack in the filter the bacteria will pass through and a luminous\r\nfiltrate is the result, but a perfect filter allows no organisms to pass\r\nand gives a dark filtrate.\r\n\r\nLuminous bacteria are also very sensitive to oxygen and cease to\r\nluminesce in its absence. By mixing luminous bacteria with an emulsion\r\nof chloroplasts (from clover leaves) in the dark, allowing the bacteria\r\nto use up all the oxygen, and then exposing the mixture to light of\r\nvarious colors, the effect of different wave-lengths in causing\r\nphotosynthesis could be studied. Only if the chloroplasts are exposed to\r\na color in the spectrum which decomposes CO_{2} with liberation of\r\noxygen do the bacteria luminesce, and when this oxygen is used up by the\r\nbacteria, the tube again becomes dark. Beijerinck has also worked out a\r\nmethod of testing for maltose and diastase with luminous bacteria, based\r\non the fact that a certain form, _Photobacterium phosphorescens_, will\r\nonly produce light in presence of maltose or diastase which will form\r\nmaltose from starch.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dubois and Molisch have both prepared \"bacterial lamps\" and\r\nalthough it has been suggested that this method of illumination might be\r\nof value in powder magazines where any sort of flame is too dangerous,\r\nit seems doubtful, to say the least, whether luminous bacteria can ever\r\nbe used for illumination. Other forms, perhaps, might be utilized, but\r\nbacteria produce too weak a light for any practical purposes. The\r\nhistory of Science teaches that it is well never to say that anything is\r\nimpossible. It is very unlikely that any luminous animal can be utilized\r\nfor practical illumination, but there is no reason why we cannot learn\r\nthe method of the firefly. Then we may, perhaps, go one step further and\r\ndevelop a really efficient light along similar lines. To what extent our\r\ninquiry into the \"secret of the firefly\" has been successful may be\r\ngleaned from the following pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLUMINESCENCE AND INCANDESCENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nModern physical theory supposes that light is a succession of wave\r\npulses in the ether caused by vibrating electrons. The light to which we\r\nare most accustomed--sunlight, electric light, gaslight, etc.,--is due\r\nto electrical phenomena connected more or less directly with the high\r\ntemperature of the source of the light. Every solid body above the\r\ntemperature of absolute zero is giving off waves of different\r\nwave-length ([lambda]) and frequency ([nu]) but of the same velocity\r\n([upsilon]), in vacuo, 180,000 miles, or 300,000 kilometres a second. In\r\nfact, [upsilon] (a constant)=[lambda]_{[nu]}, so that it is only\r\nnecessary to designate the wave-length in order to characterize the\r\nwaves. This is radiant energy or radiant flux.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows, the long waves given off in largest amount from\r\nobjects at comparatively low temperatures give the sensation of warmth.\r\nAs we raise the temperature, in addition to these longer heat waves,\r\nthose of shorter and shorter wave-length are given off in sufficient\r\nquantity to be detected. At 525 deg. C., rays of about [lambda]=.76 mu in\r\nlength are just visible as a faint red glow to the eye. As the\r\ntemperature increases still shorter wave-lengths become apparent, and\r\nthe light changes to dark red (700 deg.), cherry red (900 deg.), dark yellow\r\n(1100 deg.), bright yellow (1200 deg.), white-hot (1300 deg.) and blue-white (1400 deg.\r\nand above). Above [lambda]=.4 mu the waves again fail to affect our eye,\r\nand, although they are very active in producing chemical changes, we\r\nhave no sense organs for perceiving them. Thus, a white-hot object\r\nliberates radiant energy or flux of many different wave-lengths\r\ncorresponding to what we know as \"heat, light and actinic rays.\" All can\r\nbe dispersed by prisms of one or another appropriate material to form a\r\nwide continuous spectrum, such as that indicated in Fig. 1. Radiant\r\nenergy of [lambda]=.76 mu to [lambda]=.4 mu, evaluated according to its\r\ncapacity to produce the sensation of light, is spoken of as visible\r\nradiation or luminous flux.\r\n\r\nBelow the infra-red comes a region of wave-length as yet uninvestigated,\r\nand beyond this may be placed the Hertzian electric waves of long\r\nwave-length used in wireless telegraphy. Above the ultra-violet comes\r\nanother region as yet uninvestigated, and then Roentgen rays (X-rays) and\r\nradium rays, of exceedingly short wave-length. These last types need not\r\nconcern us except in that we may later inquire if they are given off by\r\nluminous animals. The shortest of the ultra-violet are known as Schumann\r\nand Lyman rays. These relations are brought out in Table 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.\r\n\r\n_Wave-lengths of Various Kinds of Radiation_\r\n\r\nWave-lengths of light are usually given in Angstrom units. One micron\r\n( mu)=.001 mm.=1000 millimicrons ( mu mu)=10,000 Angstrom units (A) or tenth\r\nmetres=10^{-10} metres or 10^{-8} centimetres.

(Stefan-Boltzmann Law). The radiant energy emitted at\r\ndifferent wave-lengths is not the same but more energy is emitted at one\r\nparticular wave-length ([lambda]_{max.}) than at longer or shorter ones,\r\ndepending also on the temperature. If the various waves are intercepted\r\nin some way, their relative energy can be measured by an appropriate\r\ninstrument and spectral energy curves can be drawn, showing the\r\ndistribution of energy throughout the spectrum. Fig. 2 gives a few of\r\nthe curves, and it will be noted that the maximum shifts toward the\r\nshorter waves the higher the temperature. In fact, for a black body\r\n[lambda]_{max.}xT=2890, and at 5000 deg. C. (about the temperature of the\r\nsun) [lambda]_{max.} lies within the visible spectrum. In gas or\r\nelectric lights it lies in the infra-red region. The area enclosed by\r\nthese spectral energy curves represents the total energy emitted, and,\r\nknowing this and the area enclosed by the curve of visible radiation, it\r\nis easy to determine how efficient a source of light is as a\r\nlight-producing body. We shall inquire more fully into this question in\r\nChapter III, in considering the efficiency of the firefly as a source of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Distribution of energy throughout the spectrum\r\nof the sun, electric arc, and gas light (_after Nichols and Franklin_).\r\nOrdinates show the relative intensities of different wave-lengths\r\nemitted.

(_Courtesy Macmillan Co._)]\r\n\r\nA body which emits light because of its (high) temperature is said to be\r\nincandescent and we speak of temperature radiation. We know, however, of\r\nmany cases where substances give off light at temperatures much below\r\n525 deg. C. They do not follow the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The light emission\r\nis stimulated by some other means than heat. Such bodies we speak of as\r\n_luminescent_, and in this category belong all luminous animals. The\r\ndistinction between light and luminescence was first pointed out by\r\nWiedemann (1888). It is usual to classify luminescences, according to\r\nthe means of exciting the light, into the following groups:\r\n\r\n  Thermoluminescence\r\n  Phosphorescence and Fluorescence\r\n      Photoluminescence\r\n      Cathodoluminescence\r\n      Anodoluminescence\r\n      Radioluminescence\r\n  Triboluminescence and Piezoluminescence\r\n  Crystalloluminescence\r\n  Chemiluminescence\r\n\r\nThe luminescence which appears in a vacuum tube when an electric current\r\nis passed through it is sometimes spoken of as _electroluminescence_. As\r\nelectroluminescence and also thermoluminescence are really special cases\r\nof phosphorescence or fluorescence and tribo-and crystalloluminescence\r\nare closely allied, the classification has only the merit of emphasizing\r\nthe means of producing light. Let us examine each kind in turn in order\r\nthat we may place the light of animals, _organoluminescence_ or\r\n_bioluminescence_ (or _biophotogenesis_), in one of these classes. All\r\nare examples of \"cold light,\" light produced at temperature far below\r\nthose observed in incandescent solids. In this category should be placed\r\nalso the light from salts in the bunsen flame, for flame spectra and\r\nline spectra in general, while only obtained at relatively high\r\ntemperatures, are not to be confused with the purely temperature\r\nradiation from the incandescent particles of carbon in a gas or candle\r\nlight. The sodium or lithium flame, etc., is not a simple function of\r\ntemperature and has been spoken of as a luminescence,\r\n_pyroluminescence_. As the luminescence of organisms could in no manner\r\nbe regarded as a pyroluminescence, occurring at temperatures far above\r\nthose compatible with life, a consideration of this form of luminescence\r\nwill be omitted. Some other low temperature flames are known, such as\r\nthat of CS_{2} in air, rich in ultra-violet rays, despite its relatively\r\nlow temperature. While these are of interest to the physicist and\r\nchemist, they can have no direct bearing on the luminescence of animals\r\nand their consideration will also be omitted. (See Bancroft and Weiser,\r\n1914-1915.)\r\n\r\nTHERMOLUMINESCENCE.--Some substances begin to emit light of shorter\r\nwave-length than red, well below 525 deg.. This is thermoluminescence.\r\nDiamond, marble, and fluorite are examples. Only certain varieties of\r\nfluorite show the phenomenon well. A crystal of one of these varieties\r\nheated in the bunsen flame on an iron spoon will give off a white light\r\nlong before any trace of redness appears in the iron. Other crystals may\r\nluminesce in hot water. In all, this luminescence is dependent on a\r\nprevious illumination or radiation of the crystal. If kept in the dark\r\nfor a long time no trace of light appears when fluorite is placed at a\r\ntemperature of 100 deg., but after a short exposure to the light of an\r\nincandescent bulb, although no light can be observed in the fluorite at\r\nroom temperature, quite a bright glow appears at 100 deg.. Calcium, barium,\r\nstrontium, magnesium and other sulphates containing traces of manganese\r\nsulphate, show a similar phenomenon after exposure to cathode rays\r\n(Wiedemann and Schmidt, 1895 b). They emit light during bombardment, but\r\nthis soon ceases when the rays are cut off. If the sulphates are now\r\nheated they give off light, red in the case of MgSO_{4} + MnSO_{4},\r\ngreen in the case of CaSO_{4} + MnSO_{4}. The power to emit light on\r\nheating may be retained for months after the exposure to cathode rays.\r\nThe emission of light by bodies after previous illumination or radiation\r\nis called _phosphorescence_ and will be considered below. It would seem\r\nthat the cases of thermoluminescence with which we are acquainted are\r\nreally cases of phosphorescence intensified by rise of temperature. The\r\nspectrum of thermoluminescent bodies, also, is similar to that of\r\nphosphorescent ones. (See Fig. 3.) However, not all phosphorescent\r\nmaterials are also thermoluminescent. The production of light by animals\r\nis quite another phenomenon from thermoluminescence.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE AND FLUORESCENCE.--Although the word phosphorescence has\r\nbeen used in a very loose way to indicate all kinds of luminescence, and\r\nparticularly that of phosphorus or of luminous animals, to the physicist\r\nit has a very definite meaning, namely, the absorption of radiant energy\r\nby substances which afterwards give this off as light. Phosphorescence\r\ndoes not strictly apply to the light of white phosphorus. If the radiant\r\nenergy is light (visible or ultra-violet) we speak of\r\n_photoluminescence_, if cathode rays we have _cathodoluminescence_, if\r\nanode rays, _anodoluminescence_, and if X-rays (Roentgen rays) we have\r\n_radioluminescence_. Inasmuch as the [alpha], [beta], and [gamma] rays\r\nof radium correspond to the anode, cathode, and X-rays, respectively,\r\nradium radiation also produces luminescence in many kinds of material.\r\nIf the material gives off the light only during the time it is radiated\r\nwe speak of fluorescence; if the light persists we speak of\r\nphosphorescence. The distinction is perhaps a purely arbitrary one, as\r\nthere are a great many substances which give off light for only a\r\nfraction of a second (1/5000 sec. in some cases) after being illuminated\r\n(_photoluminescence_). Some substances also, which fluoresce at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, will phosphoresce at low temperatures. Phosphorescence is\r\nexhibited chiefly by solids, fluorescence also by liquids and vapors.\r\n\r\nSpecial means must be used to observe a phosphorescence of short\r\nduration. E. Becquerel has devised an apparatus for doing this, a\r\n_phosphoroscope_. It consists of revolving disks with holes in them\r\nbetween which the object to be examined is placed. The holes are so\r\narranged that the object is first illuminated and then completely cut\r\noff from light. The observer looking at it through another hole sees it\r\nat the moment it is not illuminated and can thus tell if it is\r\nphosphorescing. By determining the rate of revolution of the disks it is\r\neasy to calculate how long the phosphorescence persists.\r\n\r\nWhile relatively few solids phosphoresce after exposure to light at\r\nordinary temperature a large number of these acquire the property at the\r\ntemperature of liquid air. Included in the list are such biological\r\nproducts as urea, salicylic acid, starch, glue and egg shells. The\r\ntemperature also affects the wave-length and hence the color of the\r\nlight given off. Usually the higher the temperature the shorter the\r\nwave-length, but in the case of some bodies (SrS) the wave-lengths\r\nbecome longer at the higher temperature.\r\n\r\nThe best known cases of phosphorescence which occur at room temperature\r\nand the group to which the word phosphorescence is commonly applied, are\r\nthose of the alkaline earth sulphides (BaS, CaS, SrS) and ZnS. An\r\nItalian, Vicenzo Cascariolo, is said to have discovered the Bologna\r\nstone (BaSO_{4}) which, by calcination with charcoal, gave an impure\r\nphosphorescent BaS or _lapis solaris_. Canton's phosphorus (CaS) was\r\nlater prepared \"by heating a mixture of three parts of sifted calcined\r\noyster shells with one part of sulphur to an intense heat for one hour.\"\r\nHulme spoke of it as the \"light magnet of Canton,\" because of its power\r\nof attracting and absorbing light. The pure sulphides do not show this\r\nproperty. Only if small amounts of some other metal such as Cu, Pb, Ag,\r\nZn, Sb, Ni, Bi, or Mn are present, will the sulphide phosphoresce. One\r\npart of impurity in a million is often sufficient. Such mixtures,\r\ntogether with a flux of Na_{2}SO_{4}, Li_{3}(PO_{4})_{2} or some other\r\nfusible salt constitute a \"phosphor.\" A \"phosphor\" is in reality an\r\nexample of a solid solution and is the basis of some kinds of luminous\r\npaints.\r\n\r\nThe intensity and duration of a phosphorescent light depend chiefly on\r\nthe nature of the exciting rays, the color chiefly on the impurity\r\npresent but the alkaline earth metal also exerts an influence. Rise in\r\ntemperature increases the intensity but diminishes the duration, so that\r\nthe total amount of light emitted is about constant at different\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of most phosphorescent substances is made up of one or more\r\ncontinuous bands having _maxima_ at different wave-lengths. In the light\r\nincident on a phosphorescent substance are also bands of light rays\r\nwhich are absorbed and whose wave-lengths are more efficient than others\r\nin stimulating phosphorescence. These bands in the phosphorescent light\r\nare usually of longer wave-length than those in the light which excites\r\nthe phosphorescence. This fact is known as Stokes' Law, but it has been\r\nfound not to be universally true. Curiously enough, red and infra-red\r\nrays have the power of annulling phosphorescence after a momentary\r\nincrease in brightness and phosphorescing materials have been used to\r\ndetermine if infra-red rays are given off in the light of the firefly.\r\nIves (1910) showed that infra-red radiation had no power of quenching\r\nthe light of the firefly as it does the phosphorescent light of Sidot\r\nblende (ZnS), one fact tending to show that the firefly's light is not\r\ndue to phosphorescence. Fig. 3 is a reproduction of a photograph of the\r\nphosphorescence spectrum of ZnS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Spectrum of zinc sulphide phosphorescence (_after\r\nIves and Luckiesh_). Photographs were taken by a special device one\r\nminute (middle) and fifteen minutes (bottom) after exposure to the light\r\nof the mercury arc and compared with a helium spectrum (top). In the\r\nmiddle photograph, the mercury exciting lines are visible. It will be\r\nnoted that the narrow band of phosphorescent light does not shift its\r\nposition during decay of phosphorescence.]\r\n\r\nOther facts show that the light of luminous animals is in no sense a\r\nphosphorescence and is quite independent of previous illumination of the\r\nanimal. Luminous bacteria will continue to luminesce although they are\r\ngrown in the dark for many weeks. Indeed strong light has a bactericidal\r\naction on these forms similar to that with ordinary bacteria. With some\r\nmarine forms light has an inhibiting effect. They lose their power of\r\nluminescence during the day and only regain it at dusk or when kept in\r\nthe dark for some time. Indeed, ordinary light never has the effect of\r\ncausing luminescence in the same sense as it causes phosphorescence of\r\nCaS.\r\n\r\nFluorescence is most efficiently excited by the cathode rays of a vacuum\r\ntube. They not only cause the residual gas in the tube to glow\r\n(_electroluminescence_) by which their path may be followed with the\r\neye, but also a vivid fluorescence of the glass walls of the tube,\r\nyellow green with sodium glass, blue green with lead and lithium glass.\r\nLiCl_{2} in the path of cathode rays gives off a blue light; in the path\r\nof anode rays a red light; NaCl a blue cathodoluminescence and a yellow\r\nanodoluminescence. The spectrum of the latter is a line spectrum of Li\r\nor Na, showing the characteristic red or yellow lines similar to those\r\nobserved where Li or Na is held in the bunsen flame. The spectrum of the\r\nsalts under excitation of cathode rays is a short continuous one in the\r\nblue region. Fluorescent spectra in general are of this nature, made up\r\nof short bands of light in one or more regions.\r\n\r\nDiamonds, rubies and many minerals fluoresce brilliantly in the path of\r\ncathode rays. Some specimens of fluorite (CaF_{2}) show the phenomenon\r\nespecially well, whence the name _fluorescence_. Fluorescent screens of\r\nbarium platinocyanide, willemite (Zn_{2}SiO_{4}), Sidot blend (ZnS) or\r\nScheelite (Ca tungstate) are frequently employed to render visible\r\nX-rays. The luminous paint most used at the present time is ZnS\r\ncontaining a trace of radium salt. The rays of the radium continually\r\nemitted cause a steady fluorescence of the ZnS. Indeed, if one examines\r\nthe paint on the hands of a watch with a lens the flash of light from\r\nthe impact of alpha particles on the ZnS can be distinctly seen, as in\r\nthe _spinthariscope_.\r\n\r\nSome animal tissues and fluids, especially the lens of the eye, will\r\nluminesce in the path of radium rays, as shown by the experiments of\r\nExner (1903), but there is no evidence that luminous animals are\r\nespecially active in this respect. Ultra-violet rays have the same\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe luminous material of practically all luminous forms, if dessicated\r\nsufficiently rapidly, can be obtained in the form of a dry powder which\r\nwill give off light when moistened with water. Coblentz (1912) has\r\nexposed this dry material to light, to the ultra-violet spark, and to\r\nX-rays and in no case has a phosphorescence or fluorescence ever been\r\nobserved. I have examined the action of radium upon _Cypridina_ light.\r\nThere was no intensifying or diminishing effect of twenty milligrams of\r\nradium (probably the bromide) on a luminous solution of _Cypridina_\r\nmaterial, nor was phosphorescence or fluorescence excited in a\r\nnon-luminous extract of the animal. We must conclude that animal light\r\nis not a fluorescence of any substance due to radiation produced by the\r\nanimals themselves.\r\n\r\nMany solutions show fluorescence in strong lights. This is especially\r\nmarked in quinine sulphate, mineral oils, eosin, fluorescein, esculin,\r\nrhodamin, chlorophyll, etc. The fluorescence of eosin in 10^{-8} grams\r\nper cubic centimetre is visible in daylight and 10^{-15} grams per cubic\r\ncentimetre in the beam from an arc lamp. It is difficult to realize that\r\nthe bluish fluorescence of quinine sulphate is really an emission\r\nrather than a reflection of light. But a test tube of quinine sulphate\r\nsolution held in the ultra-violet region of a spectrum will glow with a\r\npale blue light, although it is not illuminated with any rays that are\r\nvisible to our eyes. Concerning this, Stokes, to whom the word\r\nfluorescence and much of our knowledge of the subject is due, says, \"It\r\nwas certainly a curious sight to see the tube\" (containing quinine\r\nsulphate solution) \"instantaneously lighted up when plunged into the\r\ninvisible rays; it was literally 'darkness visible.'\" Quinine sulphate\r\nabsorbs the ultra-violet converting these rays into visible blue ones.\r\nIts spectrum is a short continuous one. Most fluorescent substances\r\nconvert short into longer wave-lengths (Stokes' Law), but some may cause\r\nthe reverse change.\r\n\r\nA substance, fluorescent in solution, has been found in a few luminous\r\nanimals, notably in several species of fireflies and also in a\r\nnon-luminous beetle. It is called _pyrophorine_ or _luciferesceine_.\r\nDubois (1886) has ascribed to pyrophorine the power of absorbing\r\ninvisible rays and transforming them into visible ones, thus increasing\r\nthe animal's light. That this is not the case has been shown by the work\r\nof Coblentz (1909). He photographed the spectrum of the firefly's light\r\nand the fluorescent spectrum of luciferesceine. The latter is almost\r\ncomplementary to the former (see Fig. 4) and no trace of the fluorescent\r\nspectrum appears in the spectrum of the light of the firefly. McDermott\r\n(1911 _a_) has studied the properties of luciferesceine and regards it\r\nmerely as an incidental material found in many animals of the\r\n_Lampyridae_ (in some non-luminous forms) and having no connection with\r\nthe light production. A trace of alkali usually increases and acid\r\ninhibits the fluorescence of solutions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Spectrum of fluorescent substance found in\r\nfireflies below (2) and of firefly luminescence above (2) compared with\r\nhelium vacuum tube (1) (_after Coblentz_).]\r\n\r\nTRIBOLUMINESCENCE AND PIEZOLUMINESCENCE.--Under this head are grouped a\r\nnumber of light phenomena which at first sight may appear to be\r\nelectrical in nature but in reality are not. The light is produced by\r\nshaking, rubbing, or crushing crystals, and only crystalline bodies\r\nappear to show _triboluminescence_ or _piezoluminescence_. A striking\r\ncase is that of uranium nitrate. Gentle agitation of the crystals is\r\nsufficient to give off sparks of light which much resemble the\r\nscintillations of dinoflagellates when sea-water containing these\r\nanimals is agitated. If Romberg's phosphorus, which is fused CaCl_{2},\r\nis rubbed on the sleeve, it glows with a greenish light. Lumps of cane\r\nsugar rubbed together will glow. Saccharin crystals will also light if\r\nshaken and Pope (1899) found that the bluish light of saccharin was\r\nbright enough to be visible in a room in daytime. It only appeared from\r\nimpure crystals and freshly crystallized specimens. Other crystals,\r\nalso, have been found to lose their power of lighting after a time.\r\n\r\nAmong biological substances, cane sugar, milk sugar, mannite, hippuric\r\nacid, asparagin, _r_-tartaric acid, _l_-malic acid, vanillin, cocaine,\r\natropin, benzoic acid, and many others show triboluminescence. A long\r\nlist is given by Tschugaeff (1901), by Trautz (1905), and by Gernez\r\n(1905). The spectrum is a short continuous one, the waves emitted\r\ndepending on the kind of crystal. Thus the color of the light varies\r\namong different santonin derivatives from yellow to green. In saccharin\r\nit is blue.\r\n\r\nAlthough the light produced by some living organisms resembles\r\ntriboluminescence in that it may be evoked by rubbing or shaking the\r\nanimals, it is in reality fundamentally different since it is dependent\r\non the presence of oxygen whereas triboluminescence is not.\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLOLUMINESCENCE.--Crystalloluminescence is observed when solutions\r\ncrystallize. It was described by Bandrowski (1894, 1895) in arsenious\r\noxide, in NaF, or if HCl or alcohol is added to hot saturated NaCl\r\nsolution. A bluish light with sparkling points appeared. All well\r\nauthenticated cases are exhibited by simple inorganic salts and these\r\nare also all triboluminescent. The reverse is not true, however; many\r\ntriboluminescent substances are not crystalloluminescent.\r\nCrystalloluminescence is much less widespread than triboluminescence.\r\nTrautz (1905) has studied the matter in a number of compounds and comes\r\nto the conclusion that the light is really a special case of\r\ntriboluminescence in which the growth of individual crystals causes them\r\nto rub together. The light becomes much brighter on stirring a mass of\r\ncrystals which exhibit crystalloluminescence. While in some cases\r\ncrystalloluminescence is unquestionably due to the triboluminescence of\r\ncrystals rubbing against each other it is not in every case, as has been\r\nclearly shown by the work of Weiser (1918 _b_). He studied luminescence\r\nof saturated aqueous alkali halide solutions (NaCl, KCl, etc.,) upon\r\naddition of alcohol or of HCl. The salt crystallizes out under these\r\nconditions and Weiser found that the light is brightest when the\r\nconditions of concentration of alcohol or of HCl are such as to cause\r\nheaping up of Na and Cl ions. He believes that the bluish light which\r\nappears is due to the combination of ions in the reaction, Na^+ + Cl^- =\r\nNaCl. Only if this proceeds rapidly enough does luminescence occur.\r\nWeiser studied also the crystalloluminescence and triboluminescence of\r\nAsCl_{3} and of K_{2}SO_{4}. By photographing the luminescence through\r\ncolor screens of different absorptive power (Weiser, 1918, _a_) a\r\nspectrum of the light could be obtained, and it was found to be\r\nidentical in both the tribo- and crystalloluminescent light; in the case\r\nof AsCl_{3}, a band in the green-blue, blue and violet. Weiser believes\r\nthe light in this case also to come from recombination of the ions,\r\nAs^{+++} + 3Cl^- = AsCl_{3}, and that crystalloluminescence in general\r\nis due to rapid reformation of molecules from ions broken up by\r\nelectrolytic dissociation while triboluminescence is due to rapid\r\nreformation of molecules from ions broken up by violent disruption of\r\nthe crystal. Of course in triboluminescent organic crystals which do not\r\ndissociate into ions, some other reaction must be responsible for the\r\nlight. One thing seems certain, that the two types of luminescence are\r\nsimilar. As Bigelow[1] remarks, \"It is altogether probable that the\r\ncause of this\" (crystalloluminescence) \"whatever it may be, is the same\r\nas the cause of triboluminescence, whatever that may be.\"\r\n\r\n[1] Theoretical and Physical Chemistry, 1912, p. 516.\r\n\r\nCrystals are not found in the luminous organs of animals with the\r\nexception of the fireflies. In these a layer of cells occurs (see\r\nChapter IV) filled with minute crystals of one of the purine bodies\r\n(xanthin or uric acid). One might surmise that the light of the animal\r\nwas a crystalloluminescence accompanying the formation of these\r\ncrystals. It is easy to show, however, that the light comes not from the\r\ncrystal layer but from another layer of cells containing large granules.\r\nIt is also dependent on the presence of oxygen while\r\ncrystalloluminescence takes place in the absence of oxygen. The crystal\r\nlayer possibly serves as a reflector. Its significance will be\r\ndiscussed in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Dubois's figures showing transformation of\r\nphotogenic granules to crystals (_after Dubois_).]\r\n\r\nThe light of luminous organisms is quite generally associated with\r\ngranules. In one of the centipedes (_Orya barbarica_), which produces a\r\nluminous secretion, Dubois (1893) has described the transformation of\r\nthese granules into crystals and at one time he supposed the light to be\r\na crystalloluminescence. He later reversed this opinion and, certainly,\r\nexamination of his drawings which are reproduced in Fig. 5 does not\r\nconvince one of the actuality of crystal formation.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of _lyoluminescence_, described by Wiedemann and Schmidt\r\n(1895) as a light accompanying the solution of colored (from exposure to\r\ncathode rays) crystals of Li, Na, or K chlorides, is probably due to a\r\ntriboluminescence from stirring of the crystals during solution.\r\n\r\nCHEMILUMINESCENCE.--As the name implies, chemiluminescence is the\r\nproduction of light during a chemical reaction at low temperatures. This\r\ndoes not mean that the other types of luminescence are not connected\r\nwith chemical reactions--using the word _reaction_ in a broad sense--for\r\nwe have reason to believe that in some cases spectra are not\r\ncharacteristic of the element as such but are rather characteristic of a\r\nparticular reaction in which the element takes part (dissociation into\r\nions, changes from monovalent to bivalent condition, etc.) and that this\r\nis the reason one element may show various spectra under different\r\nconditions (Bancroft, 1913). The chemiluminescences are rather oxidation\r\nreactions involving the absorption of gaseous or dissolved oxygen and\r\nmay be very easily distinguished from all the previously mentioned\r\nluminescences by this criterion. They should, perhaps, more properly be\r\ncalled _oxyluminescences_.\r\n\r\nThe glow of phosphorus is the best known case, recognized since\r\nphosphorus was first prepared by Brandt in 1669. It is interesting to\r\nnote that when first prepared phosphorus was regarded as a peculiarly\r\npersistent type of phosphor, _i.e._, a material akin to the impure\r\nalkaline earth sulphides.\r\n\r\nFresh cut surfaces of Na and K metal will glow in the dark for some\r\ntime, especially if warmed to 60 deg.-70 deg. (Linnemann, 1858). A film of oxide\r\nis formed over the surface, showing definitely that oxidation has\r\noccurred. Ozone oxidizes organic matter with an accompanying glow\r\n(Fahrig, 1890; Otto, 1896). The light from ozone acting on pyrogallol\r\nsolution is especially bright under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nRadziszewski (1877, 1880) gives a long list of substances, chiefly\r\nessential oils, which luminesce if slowly oxidized in alcoholic\r\nsolutions of alkalis. Formaldehyde, dioxymethylen, paraldehyde,\r\nmetaldehyde, acrolein, disacryl, aldehydeammonia, acrylammonia,\r\nhydrobenzamid, lophin, hydroanisamid, anisidin, hydrocuminamid,\r\nhydrocinamid, besides waxes, and such biological substances as glucose,\r\nlecithin, cholesterin, cholic, taurocholic, and glycocholic acids, and\r\ncerebrin, all luminesce on oxidation. Radziszewski himself and many\r\nother authors have compared the light of organisms to this type of\r\nluminescence. Indeed the incorrect identification of granules found in\r\nthe cells of practically all luminous tissues as oil droplets, is\r\nlargely due to the influence of Radziszewski's work. Dubois (1901 _b_)\r\nhas added esculin, and Trautz (1904-5) many aldehydes and phenol\r\nderivatives, including vanillin, papaverin, tannic and gallic acids,\r\nbesides glycerol and mannite to the list of biological substances\r\noxidizing with light production. Guinchant (1905) has described\r\noxyluminescence of uric acid and asparagine, Weitlaner (1911) of\r\nsubstances in humus and McDermott (1913) of substances in urine and the\r\nanaerobic alkaline hydrolysis products of glue and Witte's peptone.\r\nPyrogallol is especially prone to luminesce, as was first noticed by\r\nLenard and Wolf (1888) in developing a photographic plate with\r\npyrogallol developer. Later the luminescence was studied in some detail\r\nby Trautz and Schloringin (1904-5) who developed the well-known\r\nluminescent mixture of pyrogallol, formaldehyde, K_{2}CO_{3} and\r\nH_{2}O_{2}. As I have shown, pyrogallol can be oxidized in a great many\r\ndifferent ways, and some of these are of great interest, for they very\r\nclosely imitate the mechanism for the production of light in organisms.\r\nThese are recorded in Table 3, which also includes various other types\r\nof oxyluminescence of general or biological interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 3\r\n\r\n_Types of Oxyluminescent Reactions_\r\n\r\n   1.

Pt. Pd. Au.\r\n      (Pyrogallol.)\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of chemiluminescent reactions has been described in a few\r\ninstances as continuous but no definite measurements of its extent have\r\nbeen made. Radziszewski (1880) found the light of lophin oxidized in\r\nalcoholic caustic alkali, examined with a two-prism spectroscope, to\r\ngive a continuous spectrum, brightest at _E_, with the red and violet\r\nends lacking. Trautz (1905, p. 101) states that the\r\npyrogallol-formaldehyde-Na_{2}CO_{3}-H_{2}O_{2} reaction gives a\r\ncontinuous spectrum from the red to the blue green with maximum\r\nbrightness in the orange. Weiser (1918 _a_) has studied the spectra of\r\nsome chemiluminescent reactions by photographing the light behind a\r\nseries of color screens. He finds also that the spectra are short, with\r\nmaximum intensity in various regions. Thus, _amarin_ oxidized by\r\nchlorine or bromine, extends from the yellow to greenish blue with a\r\nmaximum in the green while _phosphorus_, dissolved in glacial acetic\r\nacid and oxidized with H_{2}O_{2}, luminesces from yellow green to\r\nviolet.\r\n\r\nThe spectra of luminous animals are quite similar to those of\r\nchemiluminescent reactions. Moreover, as we have seen, chemiluminescence\r\nis essentially an oxyluminescence, since oxygen is necessary for the\r\nreaction. All luminous animals also require oxygen for light production.\r\nTherefore, bioluminescence and chemiluminescence are similar phenomena\r\nand they differ from all the other forms of luminescence which we have\r\nconsidered. The light from luminous animals is due to the oxidation of\r\nsome substance produced in their cells, and when we can write the\r\nstructural formula of this photogenic substance and tell how the\r\noxidation proceeds, the problem of light production in animals will be\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL NATURE OF ANIMAL LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest in the light of animals from a physical standpoint has centred\r\naround questions of quality, efficiency and intensity, but in only one\r\ngroup of luminous animals, the beetles, have accurate measurements of\r\nthese characteristics been made. This is due in part to the abundance of\r\nthese forms and their appeal to human interest and in part because they\r\nare among the brightest of luminous organisms. Weak lights are not only\r\ndifficult to measure but, when dispersed to form spectra, give bands so\r\nfaint that their limits are very difficult to see and more so to\r\nphotograph. Very few organisms produce light visible to the fully\r\nlight-adapted eye. Although their light may seem quite bright to the\r\ndark-adapted eye, the dark-adapted eye is a poor judge of the quality,\r\n_i.e._, the color of a light. This is because of the Purkinje\r\nphenomenon, a change in the region of maximum sensibility of the retina\r\nwith change in intensity of the light. For an equal energy spectrum, to\r\nthe normal, completely light-adapted eye, yellow-green light of\r\nwave-length, [lambda] = .565 mu, appears the brightest, but when the light\r\nis made fainter the maximum shifts first to the green and then to the\r\nblue. The dark-adapted eye can see green or blue better than yellow and\r\nfor this reason weak lights will appear more green or blue than stronger\r\nones of the same energy distribution. Also two weak lights of the same\r\nspectral composition may appear different in color if they differ much\r\nin intensity. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Visibility curves for three illuminations\r\nshowing the shift in region of maximum visibility, or Purkinje\r\nphenomenon (_after Nutting_).]\r\n\r\nThe shift in sensibility of the eye occurs in illuminations of between\r\n0.5 and 50 metre-candles and represents a change from central cone\r\nvision (high intensities) to peripheral rod vision (low intensities).\r\nThe _fovea centralis_ lacks rods and this part of the eye becomes\r\npractically color blind at very low intensities of light. Below 0.5 and\r\nabove 50 metre-candles visibility varies but little with change in\r\nintensity. It is clearly necessary then to distinguish between the\r\nphysical objective phenomenon of light and the physiological subjective\r\nsensation of light.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that different luminous animals produce light of quite\r\ndifferent colors as judged by our eye. A range of spectral tints has\r\nbeen described which extends from red to violet but \"yellowish,\"\r\n\"greenish\" and \"bluish\" tints are commonest. Indeed one or two animals\r\npossess several luminous organs emitting lights of different colors.\r\nThis is true in a South American firefly, _Phengodes_, whose lights are\r\nred and greenish yellow, and in the deep sea squid, _Thaumatolampas\r\ndiadema_, which produces lights of three colors, two shades of blue and\r\nred. The red light in the case of the squid appears to be due to a red\r\ncolor screen formed by the chromatophores, but in _Phengodes_ no screen\r\nis present.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 4\r\n\r\n_Wave-lengths of Fraunhofer Lines and Prominent Lines in Line Spectra_\r\n\r\n\r\n  FRAUNHOFER LINES\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n        Line        |Color |    Wave-lengths     |      Source\r\n                    |      |    ( mu mu =  mu/1000)     |\r\n  ------------------+------+---------------------+------------------------\r\n          A         |Red   | 759.4 (band)        |Oxygen in atmosphere.\r\n          a         |Red   | 718.5 (band)        |Water vapor atmosphere.\r\n          B         |Red   | 686.7               |Oxygen vapor atmosphere.\r\n          C         |Red   | 656.3               |Hydrogen in sun.\r\n     D_{1} D_{2}    |Yellow| 589.6, 589.0        |Sodium in sun.\r\n          E         |Green | 527.0               |Calcium in sun.\r\n  b_{1} b_{2} b_{4} |Green | 518.4, 517.3, 516.8 |Magnesium in sun.\r\n          F         |Blue  | 486.1               |Hydrogen in sun.\r\n          G         |Violet| 430.8               |Calcium in sun.\r\n         H K        |Violet| 396.9, 393.4        |Calcium in sun.\r\n  ------------------+------+---------------------+------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  BUNSEN FLAME LINES\r\n\r\n  ===============================================\r\n    Source  | Color  | Wave-lengths ( mu mu =  mu/1000)\r\n  ----------+--------+---------------------------\r\n  Potassium | Red    | 769.9, 766.5 (double)\r\n  Lithium   | Red    | 670.8\r\n  Sodium    | Yellow | 589.6, 589.0 (double)\r\n  Thallium  | Green  | 535.1\r\n  Magnesium | Green  | 518.4\r\n  Strontium | Blue   | 460.7\r\n  ----------+--------+---------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLUeCKER TUBE LINES\r\n\r\n  ===============================================\r\n    Source  | Color  | Wave-lengths ( mu mu =  mu/1000)\r\n  ----------+--------+---------------------------\r\n  Mercury   | Yellow | 579.0, 576.9\r\n            | Green  | 546.1\r\n            | Blue   | 491.6, 435.8\r\n            | Violet | 407.8, 404.7\r\n  Hydrogen  | Red    | 656.3\r\n            | Blue   | 486.1, 434.1\r\n  Helium    | Red    | 728.2, 706.5, 667.8\r\n            | Yellow | 587.6\r\n            | Green  | 504.8, 501.6, 492.2\r\n            | Blue   | 471.3, 447.2\r\n            | Violet | 438.8, 402.6, 388.8\r\n  ----------+--------+---------------------------\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, difference in color of the light does not necessarily\r\nindicate difference in spectral composition because of the Purkinje\r\neffect. However, examination of the spectrum of various luminous forms\r\nhas very clearly indicated that the different colors are really due to\r\nlight rays of different wave-length and are not the result of any\r\nsubjective phenomena. To facilitate comparison, spectral lines and\r\ncolors are given in Table 4. The first adequate observations on the\r\nspectra of luminous animals were made by Pasteur (1864), who studied\r\n_Pyrophorus_ and found a continuous spectrum unbroken by light or dark\r\nbands. Lankester (1868) discovered a similar continuous spectrum in\r\n_Chaetopterus insignis_ and placed its limits from line 5 to 10 on\r\nSorby's Scale (about [lambda] = 0.55 mu to [lambda] = 0.44 mu). Young\r\n(1870) first recorded the limits of the firefly spectrum as a little\r\nabove _C_ ([lambda] = .6563 mu) to _F_ ([lambda] = .4861 mu). Since then a\r\nnumber of luminous forms have been examined and all are found to give\r\nshort continuous spectra (not crossed by light or dark bands or lines)\r\nlying in different color regions. Thus, Conroy (1882) examined the\r\nglowworm (_Lampyris noctiluca_) light and observed a band extending from\r\n[lambda] = 0.518 mu to [lambda] = 0.656 mu. Dubois (1886) states that the\r\nspectrum of _Pyrophorus noctilucus_, the West Indian \"Cucullo,\" extends\r\nfrom slightly further than the Fraunhofer _B_ line to the _F_ line,\r\nwhile Langley and Very (1890), working on the same form, placed the\r\nlimits at [lambda] = 0.468 mu to [lambda] = 0.640 mu. It consists, then, of\r\na broad band chiefly in the green and yellow. But, \"would the light not\r\nextend farther were it bright enough to be seen?... if the light of the\r\ninsect were as bright as that of the sun would it not extend equally far\r\non either side of the spectrum?\" \"It is impossible to increase the\r\nintrinsic brilliancy by any optical device, but if it be impossible to\r\nmake the light of the insect as bright as that of the sun, it is on the\r\nother hand quite possible to make the light of the sun no brighter than\r\nthat of the insect ...\" Langley and Very investigated this question,\r\nforming a solar spectrum from sunlight of the same intensity as that of\r\n_Pyrophorus_ and a _Pyrophorus_ spectrum together in the same field of\r\nthe spectroscope. The latter was very much shorter than the solar\r\nspectrum, showing that its length was not due to weakness of the red and\r\nblue rays but to their absence. Later Ives and Coblentz (1910)\r\nphotographed the spectrum of a firefly (_Photinus pyralis_), together\r\nwith that of a carbon glow lamp, on plates sensitive to all wave-lengths\r\nof visible rays under conditions which would have recorded all visible\r\nradiations given off. They found the spectrum to extend only from\r\n[lambda] = 0.51 mu to [lambda] = 0.67 mu (Fig. 7). Another species of\r\nfirefly (_Photuris pennsylvanica_) was found by Coblentz (1912) to give\r\na spectrum extending from [lambda] = 0.51 mu to [lambda] = 0.59 mu (Fig. 8).\r\nThe _Photinus_ light extends much further into the red and it is easy to\r\ndistinguish between _Photinus_ and _Photuris_ in nature, merely by the\r\nreddish tint of the light of the former. These photographic records show\r\nconclusively that the color of the light of luminous animals is not a\r\nsubjective phenomenon due to the Purkinje effect and the low intensity\r\nof the light, but is real, an actual difference in spectral\r\ncomposition of the light emitted. Neither is it due, at least in the\r\nfireflies examined, to the existence of color screens which absorb\r\ncertain rays, allowing only those of a definite color to pass. The\r\nspectra of forms thus far investigated are reproduced in Fig. 9 and\r\nrecorded in Table 5. It will be noted that they vary considerably in\r\nposition but are all of the same type. The spectrum of _Cypridina\r\nhilgendorfii_ is the longest thus far investigated ([lambda] = .610 mu to\r\n[lambda] = .415 mu), extending well into the blue, and the light of this\r\nform is very blue in appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Spectra of carbon glow lamp, A, firefly\r\n(_Photinus pyralis_); B, and helium vacuum tube, C (_after Ives and\r\nCoblentz_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Spectra of helium vacuum tube (1); carbon glow\r\nlamp (2); the firefly, _Photinus pyralis_ (3); and the firefly _Photuris\r\npennsylvanica_ (4) (_after Coblentz_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Spectra of various luminous animals (_after\r\nMcDermott_). 1.

I may add\r\nthat the _Cypridina_ light like any other light may be polarized by\r\npassing through a Nicol prism.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers [Dubois (1914 book)], Fischer (1888), Molisch (1904\r\nbook) have noticed that the light of luminous bacteria changes in color\r\nif grown on different culture media. Light which is \"silver white\" on\r\ndead fish becomes \"greenish\" on salt-peptone-gelatin media and more\r\nyellow on salt-poor media. Peron (1804) and Panceri (1872) describe the\r\nlight of _Pyrosoma_ as yellow to greenish after death of the animal and\r\nreddish on stimulation; then fading out through orange, yellow, greenish\r\nand azure blue. Polimanti (1911) describes the normal light of\r\n_Pyrosoma_ as greenish, and states that as the animals die, or if they\r\nare kept at temperatures above the optimum, the light becomes more red.\r\nMcDermott (1911, _b_) noticed that the light of fireflies placed in\r\nliquid air became decidedly reddish just before going out and on\r\nrewarming the first light to appear was reddish followed by the proper\r\nshade at higher temperatures. I have frequently observed a more\r\nreddish color from luminous tissues of the firefly upon the addition of\r\ncoagulants such as alcohol, and have noted that the light of _Cypridina_\r\nbecomes weaker and more yellow at both low (0 deg.) and high (50 deg.)\r\ntemperatures. The meaning of these color changes will be discussed in\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of any light may be defined in several different ways:\r\n(1) By the percentage of visible wave-lengths in the total amount of\r\nradiation emitted, _i.e._, visible radiation divided by total (heat,\r\nvisible, actinic) radiation; (2) by considering, in addition to visible\r\nradiation / total radiation, the sensibility of the eye to different\r\nwave-lengths, visible radiation x visual sensibility / total radiation.\r\nVisible radiation x visual sensibility is spoken of as luminosity; (3)\r\nby the amount of light (expressed in candles) produced in relation to a\r\ngiven expenditure of energy or in relation to the cost of the energy\r\nexpended. Thus, of the radiation emitted from an incandescent electric\r\nlamp only a small per cent. is light, the rest being heat and actinic\r\nrays. It is therefore very far from being 100 per cent. efficient. If\r\nthere were no infra-red or ultra-violet in the radiation from an\r\nincandescent lamp its efficiency would be 100 per cent. if we\r\ndisregarded visual sensibility. But if we take into account the fact\r\nthat the eye is most sensitive to yellow green, a source of light, even\r\nthough emitting only visible radiation, would not be 100 per cent.\r\nefficient unless its maximum of emission corresponded also with the\r\nmaximum of visual sensibility. We shall return to this question in a\r\nlater paragraph. Looking at the question from the standpoint of energy\r\nconsumption, the carbon incandescent lamp gives one mean spherical\r\ncandle for 4.83 watts (watt = 10^7 ergs per sec.), while the tungsten\r\nlamp gives one mean spherical candle for 1.6 watts, about one-third the\r\nenergy, and the latter is consequently more efficient.\r\n\r\nAs we know practically nothing of the energy transformations occurring\r\nduring the process of light production in organisms, all statements\r\nregarding the efficiency of their light are based on relations between\r\nthe visible radiation and total radiation. This involves a measurement\r\nof rays in the infra-red region (heat rays) and ultra-violet region\r\n(actinic rays) as well as the light rays proper, and any other radiant\r\nenergy produced. While all spectroscopic investigations show that the\r\nspectrum of luminous animals never extends to the limits of the visible\r\nspectrum in either the red or violet, it is possible that bands occur in\r\nthe infra-red or ultra-violet, and special methods must be employed to\r\ndetect these. Radiations of all kinds, if converted into heat on\r\nstriking the blackened surface of a thermopile, bolometer, or radiometer\r\ncan be measured by changes in temperature and the relative amounts of\r\nenergy represented be compared in a common unit, the calorie. By proper\r\nscreening, all rays except the visible light rays can be cut off from\r\nthe measuring instrument and the amounts of energy represented in light\r\nand in total radiation thus be determined.\r\n\r\nDubois (1886) first studied this problem in _Pyrophorus_ by the use of a\r\nthermopile and galvanometer and found a small amount of radiation from\r\nthe luminous region in excess of that from a non-luminous region. It\r\namounted to a galvanometer deflection of 0.95 deg. and was increased 0.3 deg.\r\nduring the flash of the insect on electrical stimulation. This increase\r\nof 0.3 deg. is possibly due to heat produced on muscular contraction. In any\r\ncase the amount of heat radiated in comparison with that of the candle\r\nis very small indeed. A more careful study has been made by Langley and\r\nVery (1890) with the bolometer. They point out first of all that the\r\ntotal radiation from the most powerful luminous organ (the abdominal\r\none) of _Pyrophorus_ which affected their bolometer slightly, would, in\r\nthe same time (10 seconds), be sufficient to raise the temperature of an\r\nordinary mercurial thermometer having a bulb 1 cm. in diameter by rather\r\nless than 2.3 x 10^{-6} deg. C. We may thus gain some idea of the magnitude\r\nof the measurements to be made. The radiation from _Pyrophorus_ which\r\naffected their bolometer was shown to be due merely to the \"body\r\nheat\"[2] of the insect, and it is largely cut off by a plate of glass\r\nwhich is opaque to all wave-lengths of 3 mu or more. These waves are given\r\noff by bodies at temperatures below 50 deg. C. and belong \"to quite another\r\nspectral region to that in which the invisible heat associated with\r\nlight mainly appears.\" Langley and Very then compared the radiation from\r\na non-luminous bunsen flame and the _Pyrophorus_ light, interposing a\r\nplate of glass in each case to cut off the waves longer than 3 mu, and\r\nfound several hundred times more radiation in the case of the bunsen\r\nburner but, nevertheless, perceptible radiation from _Pyrophorus_. The\r\nformer consisted of radiant heat shorter than [lambda] = 3 mu and\r\nextending up to the visible light rays ([lambda] = 0.7 mu since the bunsen\r\nflame emitted no light). The very slight effect of the _Pyrophorus_\r\nradiation must be due to wave-lengths between [lambda] = 3 mu and [lambda]\r\n= 0.468 mu, the limit of the _Pyrophorus_ spectrum in the blue. Langley\r\nand Very assumed it to be due entirely to the band of visible light,\r\n[lambda] = 0.640 mu to [lambda] = 0.468 mu, and assumed that no invisible\r\nheat rays were produced. All of the energy of _Pyrophorus_ light would\r\ntherefore lie in the visible region and its efficiency (light rays /\r\nheat + light + actinic rays) would be 100 per cent. Later, Langley\r\n(1902) reinvestigated the radiation of _Pyrophorus_ and could detect no\r\nheating whatever with the bolometer. \"A portion of the flame of a\r\nstandard sperm candle, equal in area to the bright part of the insects,\r\ngave under the same circumstances, a bolometric effect of such magnitude\r\nthat had the heat of the insect been 1/80,000 as great as that from the\r\ncandle, it would certainly have been recognized.\" Coblentz (1912) also,\r\nusing a vacuum thermopile of Pt and Bi, was unable to detect any\r\ninfra-red radiation from _Photinus pyralis_, but found that the\r\ntemperature of this firefly is slightly lower than the air. These\r\ntemperature measurements will be discussed in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n[2] Langley and Very evidently supposed that the body temperature of the\r\nfirefly, like the mammal or bird, is higher than its surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of Langley and Very that the small amount of _Pyrophorus_\r\nradiation passing glass is all light has been called into question by\r\nIves (1910), who points out that Langley and Very failed to use a screen\r\nwhich would cut off either the visible rays or the invisible rays\r\nbetween 3 mu and 0.7 mu. They really left the question open as to whether\r\nthe effect of _Pyrophorus_ light on their bolometer was due to the\r\nvisible band of rays or to this plus another band in the infra-red. \"The\r\nfirefly's actual efficiency as a light source is dependent to a large\r\ndegree on the radiation being confined to the visible region. If there\r\nshould be found infra-red of quantity comparable to the visible, the\r\nfirefly, while still a very efficient source would not be, as usually\r\nsupposed, the example of an ideally efficient light produced by\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nIves investigated the question further by the phosphor-photographic\r\nmethod. \"In brief it consists of this: Phosphorescence, which is excited\r\nin various substances by exposure to short waves (blue, violet or\r\nultra-violet), is destroyed by exposure to longer waves (orange, red,\r\ninfra-red). Thus, a surface of Balmain's paint or of Sidot blende,\r\nexcited to phosphorescence and then exposed in a spectrograph, will have\r\nareas of reduced brightness wherever long-wave energy has fallen upon\r\nit. If this surface is then laid on a photographic plate for a short\r\nperiod, a permanent record is obtained on the plate after development.\"\r\nPreliminary tests showed that the method was applicable in the case of\r\nweak light such as the firefly spectrum and also if the light is\r\nintermittent like the firefly. With Sidot blend (ZnS) the extinguishing\r\naction extends from [lambda] = 0.6 mu to [lambda] = 1.5 mu. A sheet of deep\r\nruby glass, which cut off all the visible rays of the firefly but\r\nallowed infra-red to pass, was placed between the firefly light and a\r\nsurface of phosphorescent Sidot blend which was exposed to the firefly\r\nflashes for three and a half hours. No extinction of phosphorescence\r\noccurred, while without the ruby glass, extinction, due to the orange\r\nrays of the _visible_ firefly light was noticeable in 20 minutes. There\r\nis thus no infra-red of an intensity at all comparable to the visible as\r\nfar as [lambda] = 1.5 mu, the lower limit of the phosphor-photographic\r\nmethod. Coblentz (1912) had examined the transparency of the dry\r\nchitinous integument of various fireflies (Fig. 10) in the infra-red and\r\nreports it to be fairly transparent down to [lambda] = 2.8 mu, opaque\r\nbetween [lambda] = 2.8 mu and [lambda] = 3.8 mu, transparent again to\r\n[lambda] = 6 mu, and opaque beyond that. The infra-red could, then, if it\r\nwere emitted, largely pass through the integument which is similar in\r\nabsorption properties to complex carbohydrates. Transparency of the\r\nintegument to the ultra-violet was not studied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Transmissivity of the integument of fireflies\r\nto infra-red radiation (_after Coblentz._)]\r\n\r\nAlthough photographs of the spectrum of firefly (_Photinus_) light show\r\nthat it extends only to the beginning of the blue, Forsyth (1910)\r\nreports ultra-violet radiation in luminous bacteria. He exposed a plate\r\nfor 48 hours to the spectrum of bacterial light dispersed by a quartz\r\nprism and got a continuous band from [lambda] = 0.50 mu (the lower limit\r\nof sensitivity of the plate) to [lambda] = 0.35 mu. However, McDermott\r\n(1911 _d_) was unable to observe fluorescence of\r\np-amino-ortho-sulpho-benzoic acid, which responds to the ultra-violet\r\nlight. Molisch (1904, book) photographed bacterial and fungus light\r\nthrough glass and through a piece of quartz and found no difference in\r\ndensity on the plate. As the exposure was brief, to avoid saturation,\r\nand as the ultra-violet, which passes quartz but not glass, has a much\r\ngreater action on the plate than visible light, we must conclude that\r\nultra-violet is absent. Ives (1910) investigated the spectrum of\r\n_Photinus pyralis_, using a quartz spectroscope, and found no evidence\r\nof ultra-violet radiation, at least as far as [lambda] = 0.216 mu.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the radiation from the firefly has been very\r\ncarefully studied and that no waves are given off from [lambda] = 1.5 mu\r\nto [lambda] = 0.216 mu with the exception of the short band ([lambda] =\r\n0.67 mu to [lambda] = 0.51 mu) in the visible, and it is highly probable\r\nthat no radiation is given off with wave-lengths longer than [lambda] =\r\n1.5 mu. The firefly light remains, then, 100 per cent. efficient,\r\ndiffering from all our artificial sources of light, the best of which\r\ndoes not approach this value. As Langley and Very express it in the\r\ntitle to their paper, it is \"the cheapest form of light,\" not cheapest\r\nin the sense of that we can reproduce it commercially at less cost than\r\nother lights, but cheaper in the sense that it is the most economical in\r\nthe energy radiated. This energy is all light and no heat. \"Cold light\"\r\nhas actually been developed by the firefly and concerning which \"we know\r\nof nothing to prevent our successfully imitating.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Spectral energy curves of various fireflies and\r\nthe carbon glow lamp (_after Coblentz_).]\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that we may also consider the efficiency of a\r\nlight in relation to the sensibility of our own eye. That is, we take\r\ninto account not only the energy distribution in the spectrum of the\r\nlight but also the fact that different wave-lengths of an equal energy\r\nspectrum affect our eye very differently. As the normal light-adapted\r\neye is most sensitive to yellow green of [lambda] = 0.565 mu,\r\nmonochromatic light of this wave-length will appear much brighter than\r\nmonochromatic light of any other wave-length with the same energy.\r\nMonochromatic light of [lambda] = 0.565 mu will then be the theoretically\r\nmost efficient possible, when we consider the energy radiated in\r\nrelation to the sensitivity of our eye. This is the usual method of\r\ndetermining the luminous efficiency of artificial lights and is\r\nobtained from a knowledge of the radiated energy and the visual\r\nsensibility. Reduced luminous efficiency = light (_radiated energy_ x\r\n_visual sensibility_) or luminosity / total radiated energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Visibility curves of various investigators\r\nobtained by different methods (_after Hyde, Forsyth and Cady_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Luminous efficiency of the 4-watt carbon glow\r\nlamp, shaded area / total area (_after Ives and Coblentz_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Luminous efficiency of the firefly, shaded area\r\n/ total area (_after Ives and Coblentz_).]\r\n\r\nThe spectral energy curve for the firefly has been worked out by Ives and\r\nCoblentz (1910), using a photographic method in which the intensities of\r\ndifferent wave-lengths of the firefly (_Photinus pyralis_) light is\r\ncompared with that of a carbon glow lamp by measuring theamount of\r\nphotochemical change produced on panchromatic photographic plates. Fig.\r\n11 gives the energy curves of various fireflies and the carbon glow lamp\r\nin the same spectral region. The visual sensibility curve used by Ives\r\nand Coblentz is that of Nutting (1908, 1911), based on Konig's data. It\r\nis reproduced in Fig. 6. The latest visibility curve is that of Hyde,\r\nForsyth and Cady (1918), reproduced in Fig. 12. It is based on\r\nobservations of twenty-nine individuals. As individuals vary considerably\r\nin their sensibility to different wave-lengths, the visibility curve\r\nrepresents an average, but it is the only standard we have with which to\r\nevaluate the energy we call light. Color-blind individuals would have a\r\nvisibility curve very different from normal individuals. Composite curves\r\nshowing the luminous efficiency of the 4-watt carbon glow lamp and the\r\nfirefly, both in relation to visibility, are given in Figs. 13 and 14,\r\nrespectively. In these figures the luminous efficiency is the shaded\r\narea / total area, 0.43 per cent. for the carbon glow lamp and 99.5 per\r\ncent. for the firefly, \"these numbers representing the relative amounts\r\nof light (measured on a photometer) for equal amounts of radiated\r\nenergy--a striking illustration of the wastefulness of artificial methods\r\nof light production. From the specific consumption of the tungsten lamp\r\n(1.6 watts per spherical candle) and the mercury arc (.55 watts per\r\nspherical candle) we obtained by comparison with the carbon filament that\r\ntheir luminous efficiencies are 1.3 and 3.8 per cent. The most efficient\r\nartificial illuminant therefore has about 4 per cent. of the luminous\r\nefficiency of the firefly.\" This is calculated to be .02 watts per\r\ncandle. More recent determinations (Coblentz, 1912), using a new\r\nsensibility curve of Nutting's (1911) for a partially light-adapted eye,\r\ngive the reduced luminous efficiency as 87 per cent. for _Photinus\r\npyralis_, 80 per cent. for _Photinus consanguineus_ and 92 per cent. for\r\n_Photuris pennsylvanica_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Spectral energy, luminosity and visibility\r\ncurves (_after Gibson and McNicholas_)\r\n  A.

The most\r\nefficient light for human use, taking into account both color and\r\nenergy-light relationships, would be a light similar to the firefly\r\nlight containing no radiation beyond the visible spectrum, but differing\r\nfrom it by being white.\" (Ives, 1910.) Although the spectral energy\r\ncurve for _Cypridina_ light has not been worked out, it will be noted\r\nthat the _Cypridina_ spectrum is much longer than that of the firefly,\r\nmore nearly approaching the spectrum of an incandescent solid giving\r\nwhite light. It approaches, but does not attain the ideal.\r\n\r\nAlthough Muraoka (1896) and Singh and Maulik (1911) have described\r\nradiations coming from fireflies which would pass opaque objects and\r\naffect a photographic plate, and Dubois reports the same from bacteria,\r\nthe existence of such radiation has been denied by Suchsland (1898),\r\nSchurig (1901) and Molisch (1904 book). The experiments of Molisch on\r\nluminous bacteria are of greatest interest, for they are very carefully\r\ncontrolled and show without a doubt that black paper or Zn, Al, or Cu\r\nsheet will allow no rays from these organisms to pass that will affect a\r\nphotographic plate, even after several days' exposure. The _visible_\r\nlight of luminous bacteria will affect the plate after one second\r\nexposure. Moreover, Molisch has pointed out the errors of those who\r\nclaim to have found penetrating radiation in luminous forms. It seems\r\nthat certain kinds of cardboard, especially yellow varieties, or wood,\r\nwill give off vapors that affect the photographic plate. The action is\r\nespecially marked with damp cardboard at a temperature of 25 deg.-35 deg. C.,\r\nand Dubois and Muraoka must have used such cardboard to cover their\r\nplates. A piece of old dry section of beech or oak trunk, placed on a\r\nphotographic plate for 15 hours in a totally dark place, will register a\r\nbeautiful picture of the annual rings of growth, medullary rays,\r\njunction of bark and wood, etc. Russell (1897) had previously found that\r\nmany bodies, both metals and substances of organic origin (gums, wood,\r\npaper, etc.), placed in contact with photographic plates, would affect\r\nthem, and concluded that vapors and not rays were the active agents. As\r\na dry piece of wood has a very definite smell, there is something given\r\noff which can affect our nose and there is no reason why it should not\r\nchange, by purely chemical action, the photographic plate. This action\r\nof wood on the plate is prevented by interposing a sheet of glass.\r\nFrankland (1898) has described similar vapors coming from colonies of\r\n_Bacillus proteus vulgaris_ and _B. coli communis_ which affect a\r\nphotographic plate laid directly over the colonies in an open petri\r\ndish. There is no effect if the glass cover of the petri dish is between\r\nplate and bacteria. There is, then, no specific emission of X-rays or\r\nsimilar penetrating radiation from luminous tissues which will affect\r\nthe photographic plate through opaque screens.\r\n\r\nA similar conclusion is reached if we attack the problem in another way.\r\nX-rays and radium rays (Becquerel rays) cause fluorescence of ZnS,\r\nbarium platinocyanide, willemite (Zn_{2}SiO_{4}), and calcium\r\ntungstate. Coblentz (1912) showed that the firefly will cause no\r\nfluorescence of a barium platinocyanide screen and I have been unable to\r\ndetect fluorescence of zinc sulphide, barium platinocyanide, zinc\r\nsilicate (willemite) or calcium tungstate shielded from _Cypridina_\r\nlight by black paper, although the light of this organism is quite\r\nbright enough to cause phosphorescence of zinc sulphide without the\r\nblack paper. The samples of the above four substances all showed\r\nfluorescence in presence of radium rays, but only the ZnS phosphoresces\r\nafter exposure to light rays, although the willemite was phosphorescent\r\nafter exposure to the ultra-violet.\r\n\r\nWhile photometry at low intensities is a difficult procedure at best, if\r\nthe light varies in intensity or is a flash, accurate measurements\r\nbecome well-nigh impossible. The figures given for intensity of animal\r\nluminescence must, therefore, be accepted with a realization of the\r\ndifficulties of measurement. By candle is meant the international\r\ncandle, unless otherwise specified, equal to 1.11 Hefner candles (H. K.)\r\n0.1 pentane lamp and 0.104 carcel units. It is a measure of intensity.\r\n\r\nAmount of light, or light flux, measured in lumens, is that emitted in a\r\nunit solid angle (area/_r_^2) by a point source of one candle-power. One\r\ncandle-power emits 4[pi] lumens. The latest figure for the mechanical\r\nequivalent of light at [lambda] = .566 is .0015 watt (Hyde, Forsyth and\r\nCady, 1919), _i.e._, 1 lumen = .0015 watt. One watt is 10^7 ergs (one\r\njoule) per second.\r\n\r\nThe illumination (of a surface) is that given by one candle at one\r\nmetre, the candle metre (C.M.) or lux. The surface then receives one\r\nlumen per square metre. A metre kerze (M.K.) is the illumination given\r\nby one Hefner candle at one metre distance.\r\n\r\nThe brightness of a surface is measured in lamberts or millilamberts. A\r\nlambert is \"the brightness of a perfectly diffusing surface radiating or\r\nreflecting one lumen per square cm.\" A millilambert is 1/1000 lambert.\r\nFor further definitions the reader is referred to the reports of the\r\ncommittee on nomenclature of the Illuminating Engineering Society.\r\n\r\nDubois (1886) states that one of the prothoracic organs of _Pyrophorus\r\nnoctilucus_ has a light intensity of 1/150 Ph[oe]nix candle of eight to\r\nthe pound (probably about equivalent to 1/150 candle) and that 37 or 38\r\nbeetles (each using all three light organs) would produce light\r\nequivalent to one Ph[oe]nix candle. Langley (1890) found that to the eye\r\nthe prothoracic organ of _Pyrophorus noctilucus_ gave one-eighth as much\r\nlight as an equal area of a candle and the actual candle-power of the\r\ninsect was 1/1600 candle. It may be remarked in passing how widely\r\ndivergent these observations are.\r\n\r\nFor the flash of the firefly (_Photinus pyralis_) Coblentz (1912) found\r\nvariation from 1/50 to 1/400 candle, the predominating values being\r\naround 1/400 candle. A continuous steady glow is sometimes obtained from\r\nthis insect and it proved to be of the order of 1/50,000 candle.\r\n\r\nSteady sources of light can be more easily measured and we have two\r\nrecords of the light intensity from luminous organisms with continuous\r\nlight. One of these is a fish, _Photoblepharon palpebratus_, with a\r\nlarge luminous organ under the eye, of flattened oval shape, 11 x 5 mm.,\r\nwhich glows continuously without change of intensity. The organ can be\r\ndarkened by a screen similar to an eyelid which pulls up over it. Steche\r\n(1909) reports the intensity to be .0024 M.K.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] The metre-kerze is a unit of illumination, not of intensity, and is\r\nincorrectly used by Steche.\r\n\r\nLuminous bacteria probably glow with less intensity than any other\r\norganism. The light from a single organism cannot be seen but that from\r\na colony is visible to the dark-adapted eye. Even so we must remember\r\nthat the eye is an exceedingly delicate instrument which can detect very\r\nsmall energy changes. The \"minimum radiation visually perceptible\" has\r\nbeen calculated by Reeves (1917) to be in the neighborhood of 18 x\r\n10^{-10} ergs per second and the light from a small colony of luminous\r\nbacteria represents little more radiation than this.\r\n\r\nLode (1904, 1908), by a modified grease spot photometer method,\r\nascertained that the light of his brightest bacterial colony of _Vibrio\r\nrumple_ had an intensity of 7.85 x 10^{-10} H.K. per sq. mm. or 0.785\r\nH.K. per 1000 sq. metres (=0.562 German-normal candles per 1000 sq.\r\nmetres). In round numbers this is about one German-normal candle per\r\n2000 sq. metres, or two to three times this area for the light from an\r\nordinary stearin candle. Lode calculated that the dome of St. Peter's at\r\nRome, if covered with bacteria, would give little more light than a\r\ncommon stearin candle. An ordinary room of 50 sq. metres wall and\r\nceiling area would give out only 0.039 German-normal candle. It does not\r\nseem likely that luminous bacteria will ever come into vogue for\r\nilluminating purposes. Friedberger and Doepner (1907) by a photographic\r\nmethod, not entirely free from error, found that one square millimetre\r\nof lighting surface of a bouillon culture of photobacteria gave 6.8 x\r\n10^{-9} German-normal candles, about ten times Lode's value. Even at\r\nthis rate commercial lighting by luminous bacteria does not appear a\r\npromising field for investors.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we may say that light from animal sources is in no way\r\ndifferent from light of ordinary sources, except in intensity and\r\nspectral extent. It is all visible light, containing no infra-red or\r\nultra-violet radiation or rays which are capable of penetrating opaque\r\nobjects. It is not polarized as produced, but may be polarized by\r\npassing through a Nichol prism. Like ordinary light, animal light will\r\nalso cause fluorescence and phosphorescence of substances, affect a\r\nphotographic plate, cause marked heliotropism of plant seedlings\r\n(Nadson, 1903) and stimulate the formation of chlorophyll (Issatschenko,\r\n1903, 1907). Because of the weakness of bacterial light, etiolated\r\nseedlings do not become green to the eye (Molisch, 1912 book), but a\r\nsmall amount of chlorophyll is formed which can be recognized by the\r\nspectroscope because of its absorption bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF LUMINOUS ORGANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe production of light is the converse of the detection of light. In\r\nthe first case chemical energy is converted into radiant energy; in the\r\nsecond case radiant energy is converted into chemical energy. The\r\nlantern of the firefly is an organ of _chemi-photic_ change; the eye is\r\nan organ of _photo-chemical_ change. While it is theoretically probable\r\nthat all reactions which proceed in one direction under the influence of\r\nlight, will proceed in the opposite direction with the evolution of\r\nlight, the formation of luciferin from oxyluciferin (described in\r\nChapter VI) is the only one definitely known. Perhaps we may place in\r\nthis category also the instances of photoluminescence, but the chemical\r\nreaction involved cannot be pointed out.\r\n\r\nWe know of no animal whose eyes, the organs, _par excellence_, of\r\nphotochemical change, give off light in the dark. All cases of luminous\r\neyes have been conclusively shown to be purely reflection phenomena. The\r\neyes of a cat only glow if some stray light is present which may enter\r\nand be reflected out again. Photochemical reactions and chemiluminescent\r\nreactions do have this in common, however, that they are largely but not\r\nexclusively oxidations. Whether all photochemical changes in the eyes in\r\nanimals require oxygen or not, is unknown, but all animal\r\nlight-producing reactions, without exception, are oxidations, and light\r\nis only produced if oxygen is present. Some material is oxidized.\r\n\r\nIn general, we may divide luminous organisms into two great classes\r\naccording as the oxidizable material is burned within the cell where it\r\nis formed or is secreted to the exterior and is burned\r\noutside--intracellular and extracellular luminescence. Many animals with\r\nintracellular luminescence have quite complicated luminous organs. It is\r\nan interesting fact that a great similarity may be observed between the\r\nevolution of the complex organs of vision and of these complicated\r\norgans. In the simplest unicellular forms certain structures within the\r\ncell serve as the photochemical detectors of light, while in luminous\r\nprotozoa, similarly, granules scattered throughout the cell are oxidized\r\nwith light production. In the higher forms the eye contains groups of\r\nphotosensitive cells connected with afferent nerves, lenses, and\r\naccessory structures for properly adjusting the light, while luminous\r\norgans contain groups of photogenic cells in connection with efferent\r\nnerves, lenses, and accessory structures for properly directing the\r\nlight. It is interesting to note that in the two groups where the eye\r\nhas attained its highest development, the cephalopods and vertebrates,\r\nhere also the luminous organ is found in greatest complexity and\r\nperfection. In intermediate stages of evolution the eye and luminous\r\norgan so closely approach each other in structure that it is still a\r\nmooted question whether certain organs found in worms and crustacea are\r\nintended for receiving or producing light.\r\n\r\nWe may also divide luminous forms into two groups according as the\r\noxidation of luminous material goes on continuously, independently of\r\nany stimulation of the organism; or is intermittent, oxidation and\r\nluminescence occurring only as a result of stimulation, using the word\r\n\"stimulation\" in the same sense in which it is used in connection with\r\nnerve or muscle tissue. Bacteria, fungi, and a few fish produce light\r\ncontinuously and independently of stimulation. Its intensity varies only\r\nover long periods of time and is dependent on the nature of the nutrient\r\nmedium or general physiological condition of the organism. All other\r\nforms give off no light until they are stimulated. Stimulation may of\r\ncourse come from the inside (nerves) or outside. Only under unfavorable\r\nconditions, such as will eventually lead to the destruction of the\r\nluminous cells, do these forms give off a continuous light. This has\r\noften been spoken of as the \"death glow,\" and is to be compared with\r\n_rigor_ in muscle tissue.\r\n\r\nSome of the fish which produce a continuous light possess a movable\r\nscreen similar to an eyelid which can be drawn across the organ, thus\r\nshutting off the light, so that the animal appears to belong to the\r\ngroup which flashes on stimulation. This is true of _Photoblepharon_,\r\nwhile _Anomalops_ can rotate the light organ itself downward, so as to\r\nbring the lighting surface against the body wall and thus cut off the\r\nlight (Steche, 1909). Other fish (_Monocentris_) are unable to \"turn\r\noff\" their light.\r\n\r\nAnimals which flash spontaneously on stimulation through nerves from\r\nwithin, possess a very varied rhythm. The different species of fireflies\r\ncan be distinguished by the character of their flashing (McDermott,\r\n1910-17; Mast, 1912). Fig. 16 shows the method of flashing of some\r\ncommon eastern North America species. The glowworm light lasts for many\r\nseconds and then dies out. This interval of darkness persists for some\r\nminutes and is then followed by another period of glowing. Some\r\nfireflies have a light which may be described as partially\r\nintermittent. It lasts for hours, but may become more dim or be\r\nintensified on stimulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Chart showing relative intensities and\r\ndurations of flashes of American fireflies (_after McDermott_). One cm.\r\nvertically = approximately 0.02 candle power; one cm. horizontally =\r\napproximately one second. The flash of the males ([male]) is at the\r\nleft; that of females ([female]) at right of chart.]\r\n\r\nSome forms only produce light at certain seasons of the year. According\r\nto Giesbrecht (1895) this is true of the copepods, which only light in\r\nsummer and autumn, and according to Greene (1899) in the toad-fish;\r\n_Porichthys_, which can only be stimulated to luminesce during the\r\nspawning season in spring and early summer.\r\n\r\nSome animals possess a periodicity of luminescence. They only luminesce\r\nat night and fail to respond to stimulation or are difficult to\r\nstimulate during the day. Bright light has an inhibiting effect. Perhaps\r\ncorrelated with this is the fact that most luminous forms are strongly\r\nnegatively heliotropic. Fireflies lie hidden in the day, to appear about\r\ndusk and the ostracod crustacean, _Cypridina_, is difficult to obtain on\r\nmoonlight nights.\r\n\r\nThe Ctenophores were the first forms in which the inhibiting effect of\r\nlight was noticed. This was described by Allman (1862) and has been\r\nconfirmed by a number of observers, especially Peters (1905). Massart\r\nfound that _Noctiluca_ was difficult to stimulate during the day and\r\n_Ceratium_, according to both Zacharias (1905) and Moore (1908), only\r\nluminesces at night, or if kept in darkness, for some little time.\r\nCrozier[4] finds a persistent day-night rhythm of light production when\r\n_Ptychodera_, a balanoglossid, is maintained for eight days in continued\r\ndarkness. The animal is difficult to stimulate during the period which\r\ncorresponds to day and luminesces brilliantly and at the slightest touch\r\nduring the period which corresponds to night.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a great many forms are able to luminesce quite\r\nindependently of previous illumination. According to Crozier[4]\r\n_Chaetopterus_ luminescence is not affected by an exposure to 3000\r\nmetre-candles for six hours.\r\n\r\n[4] Private communication.\r\n\r\nIn the case of animals with extracellular luminescence we may speak of\r\nluminous secretions and true luminous glands. A large number of forms\r\npossess luminous glands or gland cells, including some of the _medusae_,\r\nthe hydroids (probably), the pennatulids (?), the molluscs (_Pholas_ and\r\n_Phyllirhoe_) (probably), some cephalopods (_Heteroteuthis_ and\r\n_Sepietta_), most annelids, ostracods, copepods, some schizopods\r\n(_Gnathophausia_) and decapod (_Heterocarpus_ and _Aristeus_)\r\ncrustaceans, all myriapods, and the balanoglossids. The remaining\r\norganisms burn their material within the cell. These include the\r\nbacteria, fungi, protozoa, some medusae (?), ctenophores (probably), most\r\ncephalopods, a few annelids (_Tomopterus_ (?)), ophiuroids (?), some\r\nschizopod (_Nyctiphanes_, _Euphasia_, _Nematocelis_, _Stylochiron_) and\r\ndecapod (_Sergestes_) crustacea, all(?) insects, _Pyrosoma_, and fishes\r\n(_selachians_ and _teleosts_). It is among this latter type that the\r\nmost complicated luminous organs have been developed. While a\r\ndescription of all the types of luminous organs and luminous structures\r\ncannot be attempted here (excellent descriptions have been given by\r\nDahlgren and Mangold) it is necessary to understand the structural\r\nconditions in a few of the forms whose physiology has attracted most\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nLuminous bacteria are so small that the light from a single individual\r\ncannot be seen. It is almost impossible to make out structural\r\ndifferences within the cell and we cannot definitely state in just what\r\nspecial region, if any, the luminescence is produced. We do know that\r\nthe light is intracellular and that filtration of the bacteria from\r\ntheir culture medium gives a dark sterile filtrate absolutely free from\r\nany luminous secretion.\r\n\r\nAmong protozoa, in certain forms at least, it is easy to observe that\r\nluminescence is connected with globules or granules which were\r\nconsidered by the earlier observers to be oil droplets. Thus, in\r\n_Noctiluca_ (Figs. 17 and 18), when the animal is violently stimulated\r\nor in the presence of reagents which slowly kill it, the whole interior\r\nappears a mass of starry points of light which can be traced to minute\r\ngranules along the strands of protoplasm (Quatrefages, 1850).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--_Noctiluca miliaris_, showing photogenic\r\ngranules in cytoplasm. _n_, nucleus; _c_, cytoplasmic strands containing\r\nphotogenic (large) and other (small) granules; _p_, pharynx; _f_,\r\nflagellum; _o_, oral groove; _t_, tentacle; _s_, spines at base of\r\ntentacle; _v_, vacuoles. _Drawn by E. B. Harvey._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--_Noctiluca miliaris_ as it appears during\r\nluminescence (_after Quatrefages_). Upper left and middle, low power;\r\nbelow, high power; upper right, a crushed fragment still luminescent.]\r\n\r\nTurning to the multicellular forms, we find the simplest development of\r\nluminosity in those animals which possess gland cells producing a\r\nluminous secretion. These cells may be scattered over the surface of the\r\nanimal as in _Chaetopterus_ (Fig. 19) or _Cavernularia_, or restricted to\r\ncertain areas [_Pholas_, (Fig. 19),] or more definitely localized to\r\nform an isolated group of gland cells as in _Cypridina_. True\r\nmulticellular glands also occur. In every case, however, we find that\r\nthe luminosity of these uni- or multicellular glands is connected with\r\nthe presence of granules. They are often spoken of as _luciferine\r\ngranules_, although it is not certain whether they are made up of\r\nluciferin or luciferase (see Chapter IV) or both. They are most similar\r\nto the zymogen granules found so abundantly in gland cells and thought\r\nto be the precursors of various enzymes. According to Dahlgren (1915),\r\nthe luciferine granules stain blue-black by iron haematoxylon after\r\nfixation at the boiling point, and photogenic cells can be detected by\r\nthis method of selective staining. Dubois (1914, book), who regards them\r\nas examples of _bioprotein_, comparable to the chondriosomes and handed\r\non from one generation to another, gives them the name of _vacuolides_\r\nor _macrozymases_. In some forms he has described their transformation\r\ninto crystals and believed at one time that animal light was a\r\ncrystalloluminescence. His figures of the crystal transformation are\r\nnot very convincing. Pierantoni (1915) has considered the granules to be\r\n_symbiotic_ luminous bacteria, but this is certainly not the case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Diagram of _Pholas_ (right) and _Chaetopterus_\r\n(left) to show distribution of luminous areas (_after Panceri_).]\r\n\r\nThe light of _Chaetopterus_ comes from a material mixed with a mucous\r\nsecretion formed over almost the whole body surfaces of the animal. A\r\nsection of the epithelium shows large mucous-producing cells and smaller\r\ngranule-containing light cells (Fig. 20). These appear to be under\r\nnervous control, as a strong stimulation in one part of the body causes\r\nluminescence which spreads over the whole surface of the worm. The\r\nanimal becomes fatigued rather readily, however. In the pennatulids,\r\nsuch as _Cavernularia_, we have also the formation of a luminous\r\nsecretion over the whole surface of the body and the individual animals\r\nin this colonial form are also connected with nerves. A stimulation in\r\nany local region, as Panceri (1872) first showed (Fig. 21), will cause a\r\nwave of luminosity to spread from this point until it extends over the\r\nwhole surface of the colony. In _Pennatula_ the rate of this luminous\r\nwave is about 5 cm. per second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Sectional view of the luminous epithelium of\r\n_Chaetopterus_ (_after Dahlgren_). _cu_, cuticle; _l. c._, light cells,\r\nsome showing discharge of secretion; _d. l. c._, discharged and emptied\r\nlight cells; _m. c._, mucous cells.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Diagram of _Pennatula_, showing by arrows the\r\ncourse of a wave of luminosity which spreads over the colony from the\r\npoint stimulated (s) (_after Panceri_).]\r\n\r\n_Pholas dactylus_ possesses similar light cells to those of\r\n_Chaetopterus_, but they are restricted to narrow bands on the siphon and\r\nmantle and a pair of triangular spots near the retractor muscles. Nerves\r\npass to the luminous regions.\r\n\r\nIn many luminous animals the light secretion formed over the surface of\r\nthe body is small in amount and adheres to the animal because it is\r\nembedded in the mucous skin secretions. In those forms which possess a\r\ntrue localized light gland the luminous secretion when expelled into the\r\nsea water (if the animal be a marine form) may persist as a luminous\r\nstreak for some time and exhibit diffusion and convection\r\nmovements. The most beautiful examples of luminous secretions are found\r\namong the ostracod crustacea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Luminous gland of _Cypridina hilgendorfii_\r\n(_after Yatsu_). 2, longitudinal section. 4, transverse section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Single enlarged gland cell of _Cypridina_\r\n(_after Dahlgren_). P, nucleus and plasmasome; C, cytoplasm; F,\r\nsecretion fibrils; D, reservoir duct filled with large yellow granules;\r\nO, valve-like outer opening of cell at surface of body.]\r\n\r\nIn _Cypridina hilgendorfii_ the luminous gland is situated on the upper\r\nlip near the mouth. It is made up of elongate (some 0.7 mm. in length),\r\nspindle-shaped cells, each one of which opens by a separate pore with a\r\nkind of valve. The openings are arranged on five protuberances. Muscle\r\nfibres pass between the gland cells in such a way that by contracting\r\nthe secretion can be forced out. In the sea water the secretion\r\nluminesces brilliantly and the Japanese call these forms _umi hotaru_,\r\nor marine fireflies. Fig. 22 is a diagram showing the structure.\r\nWatanabe (1897), who first studied this form, and also Yatsu (1917) have\r\ndescribed two kinds of granule-containing cells, one with large yellow\r\nglobules, 4-10 mu in diameter (Fig. 23), the other with small colorless\r\ngranules 0.5, in diameter. I have observed in the living form these two\r\ntypes and also large colorless globules of the same size as the yellow\r\nglobules. All dissolve when extruded into the sea water. Dahlgren[5] has\r\ndescribed from sections four types of cells containing (1) large\r\nglobules, (2) small granules, (3) a fat-like material, (4) a mucous\r\nmaterial. Just what the significance and nature of these types of\r\nsubstance is cannot be stated at present. At least one, probably two,\r\nare concerned in light production. The others may possibly form\r\ndigestive fluids which act on the food of the animal.\r\n\r\n[5] Private communication soon to be published.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the animals possessing light cells with intracellular\r\nluminescence we find in general that such light cells are localized to\r\nform definite light organs and that these may be single, as in the\r\ncommon fireflies, paired, as the prothoracic light organs of\r\n_Pyrophorus_, or scattered over the surface of the body, as in so many\r\nshrimps, cephalopods and fishes, when they are often called photophores.\r\nThe light cells proper are often associated with reflectors, lenses,\r\nopaque screens and color screens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Distal portion of malpighian tubule of\r\n_Bolitophila_, showing modification to form photogenic organ (_after\r\nWheeler and Williams_). _MT_{1}_, _MT_{4}_, malpighian tubules forming\r\nphotogenic organ; _R_, reflector; _M_, muscle; _T_, trachea.]\r\n\r\nThe insects possess the simplest types of intracellular light organs, a\r\nmass of photogenic cells, which, in the common firefly (_a lampyrid\r\nbeetle_) of Eastern North America, has probably been developed from the\r\nfat body, while in the New Zealand glowworm, the larva of a tipulid fly\r\n(_Bolitophila luminosa_), part of the Malpighian tubule cells have\r\nacquired photogenic power (Wheeler and Williams, 1915). This is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nThe photogenic organ of the firefly is made up of two kinds of cells, a\r\ndorsal mass of small cells several layers deep, the reflector layer, and\r\na ventral mass of large cells with indistinct boundaries, the photogenic\r\nlayer (Fig. 25). The photogenic cells contain a mass of granules,\r\nspherical in the male and short rods in the female. The photogenic cells\r\nare divided into groups by large tracheal trunks which pass into the\r\nlight organ and branch to form tracheoles connected with tracheal end\r\ncells. The exact distribution varies in different species, but in all\r\nthe arrangement is such as to give a very abundant oxygen supply. Each\r\ngroup of photogenic cells is surrounded by a clear ectoplasm containing\r\nno granules. The tracheoles pass through this and either end openly\r\nwithin the photogenic cells or anastomose with tracheoles from\r\nneighboring tracheae. Nerves, but no blood-vessels--which are absent in\r\ninsects--enter the organ. It is difficult to determine if the nerves\r\nsupply the tracheal end cells or the photogenic cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Sectional view of photogenic organ of the\r\nfirefly (_after Williams_), showing reflector or crystal layer (_U_)\r\nabove and photogenic cells (_P_) below. _C_, cuticula; _T_, trachea;\r\n_c_, capillaries of tracheal end cells; _H_, hypodermis; _EC_, tracheal\r\nend cells; _N_, nerve.]\r\n\r\nThe dorsal reflecting layer is made up of cells containing numerous\r\nminute crystals of some purin base, either xanthin or urates, or both.\r\nThey have a white milky appearance and while they are certainly not good\r\nreflectors in the optical sense, they do act as a white background,\r\nscatter incident light, and partially prevent its penetration to the\r\ninternal organs of the firefly. Although a few crystals similar to those\r\nof the reflector layer are found in the photogenic cells and in other\r\ncells of the body, it is known that the photogenic cells are not\r\ntransformed into the reflector cells. The two layers are distinct and\r\npermanent from an early stage in development.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the light organ of the larva of the firefly (glowworm)\r\nis quite distinct from that of the adult. Like so many other structures\r\nin insects, the adult organ is developed anew from potential photogenic\r\ncells during the pupal period. Even the egg of the firefly is luminous\r\nand glows with a steady light, and during the pupal period light may\r\nsometimes be seen coming from the thoracic region.\r\n\r\nIn the firefly there is no true lens, the light merely shining through\r\nthe cuticle which is transparent over the light organ, whereas over the\r\nrest of the body it is dark and pigmented. In the deep sea shrimp,\r\n_Acanthephyra debelis_, with light organs scattered over the surface of\r\nthe body, the cuticle covering the light organ forms a concavo-convex\r\nlens, behind which are the photogenic cells (Kemp, 1910). As may be seen\r\nfrom Fig. 26, the lens is made up of three layers which suggests that it\r\nmay be corrected for chromatic aberration--a veritable \"achromatic\r\ntriplet.\" In an allied form, _Sergestes_ (Fig. 27), the lens is of two\r\nlayers and double convex. Optical studies of these lanterns have been\r\nmade by Trojan (1907). The course of the light rays is shown in Fig. 28.\r\nThe lens of these organs is also bluish in color which suggests that\r\nthey may serve also as color filters. Behind the photogenic cells is a\r\nmass of connective tissues through which enters the nerve, for the\r\nlight of these organs is under the control of the animal and may be\r\nflashed \"at will.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Sectional view of photogenic organ of\r\n_Acanthephyra debilis_ (_after Kemp_). _n_, nerve; _s. l._, sheathing\r\nlayer of cells; _g_, cone of refractive granules at end of nerve strand;\r\n_c_, cellular layer; _i. l._, _m. l._, _o. l._, inner, middle and outer\r\nlayer of lens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Sectional view of photogenic organ of\r\n_Sergestes prehensilis_ (_after Terao_). _bm_, basement membrane; _cs_,\r\nconnective strands of photogenic layer; _hy_, hypodermis; _l_{1}_,\r\n_l_{2}_, _l_{3}_, layers of lens; _le_, lens epithelium; _n_, nerve;\r\n_ph_, photogenic cells; _pi_, pigment layer; _r_, reflector; _th_,\r\ntheca.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Diagram of photogenic organ of _Nyctiphanes\r\nConchii_, to show pathways of light rays arising in the light cell layer\r\n(_after Trojan_). _p_, pigment; _ri_, inner reflector; _lp_, light\r\ncells; _rf_, refractor; _f_, focus; _l_, lens; _A-A_, axis;\r\n_a_{1}-a_{4}_, _b_{1}-b_{4}_, light rays reflected from _ri_;\r\n_c_{1}-c_{4}_, light rays passing directly outward; _d_{1}-d_{9}_ and\r\n_e_{1}-e_{9}_, light rays which have passed refractor and lens\r\nrespectively.]\r\n\r\nAll gradations in complexity of light organs may be found from the\r\ncondition in the shrimp just described to that found among the squid and\r\nfish. Figs. 29 and 30 are sections of two of the more complicated types\r\nfound in squid. The explanation given to the various structures is that\r\nof Chun (1903) to whom we are indebted for a careful histological\r\ninvestigation of these forms. It will be noted that in addition to\r\nphotogenic and lens tissues there are various types of reflector cells\r\nand a line of pigment about the whole inner surface of the organ to\r\neffectively screen the animal's tissues from the light. In one form\r\n(Fig. 30) chromatophores are found about the region where the light is\r\nemitted and these no doubt serve as color filters. There are also an\r\nabundant blood supply and nerves passing to the organ. Figs. 30 and 31\r\nare sections through light organs of fishes.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that light organs may be very simple and also very\r\ncomplicated. The latter must have evolved from the former, although it\r\nis not always possible to point out the intermediate stages. It is not\r\nwithin the scope of this book to discuss bioluminescence in its\r\nevolutionary aspects. It may be worth while, however, to point out\r\nbriefly what is known concerning the use of the light to the animal.\r\nThere are four possibilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Sectional view of photogenic organ of a squid,\r\n_Abraliopsis_ (_after Chun_.) _refl^1_, _refl^2_, reflectors; _lac._,\r\nlacunar spaces; _chr._, pigment screen of chromatophores; _chr.^1_,\r\nchromatophore; _phot._, photogenic cells; _l_, lens; _co._, cuticle;\r\n_v_, blood vessel; _fibr._, connective tissue.]\r\n\r\n(1) The light may be of no use whatever, purely fortuitous, an\r\naccompaniment of some necessary or even unnecessary chemical reaction.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the case in the luminous bacteria and fungi and\r\nperhaps the great majority of forms which make up the marine plankton,\r\n_Noctiluca_, dinoflagellates, jelly-fish, ctenophores and even the\r\nsessile sea pens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Sectional view of photogenic organ of a squid,\r\n_Calliteuthis_ (_after Chun_). _phot._, photogenic cells; _l_, _l^1_,\r\nlens; _n_, nerve; _spec._, \"Spiegel\"; _pg._, pigmented screen; _c.\r\nfusif._, spindle-shaped reflector cells; _chr._, chromatophore color\r\nscreen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Sectional view of photogenic organ of a fish,\r\n_Stomias_ (_after Brauer_). _p_, pigment screen; _dr_, _dr^1_,\r\nphotogenic gland cells; _l_, lens.]\r\n\r\nWe know that luminous bacteria occasionally lose the power of lighting\r\nand that on certain culture media they develop as non-luminous forms.\r\nLuminescence is not indispensable to them. The same is true of some of\r\nthe fungi but _Noctiluca_ and other animals are not known in a\r\nnon-luminous condition, although we can see no definite value to the\r\norganism of this power of luminescence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Sectional view of photogenic organ of a fish,\r\n_Argyrophelecus affinis_ (_after Brauer_). _p_, pigmented screen; _dr._,\r\nphotogenic cells; _r_, _r^1_, reflector?; _l_, lens?; _s_, sclera; _g_,\r\nconnective tissue.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of sea pens, however, we might suppose that the light acts\r\nas an attraction to small organisms on which the sea pen feeds, although\r\nthese creatures only luminesce when stimulated in some way, which rather\r\ndetracts from the above suggestion.\r\n\r\n(2) The light may act as a warning to scare away predacious animals\r\nwhich would otherwise feed on the luminous organism. Perhaps this is the\r\ncase in the sea pens, although these forms possess nematocysts which\r\nshould serve as adequate protection. The marine worm, _Chaetopterus_, is\r\nbrightly luminous and lives its whole life in an opaque parchment tube.\r\nIf this tube were torn open by a predacious form we might conceive that\r\nthe attacking animal would be alarmed by the light and refrain from\r\ndestroying the worm. The _Chaetopterus_, however, could not rebuild\r\nanother tube and its light would only protect it in the night time.\r\nThese cases will suffice to indicate the difficulties and perplexities\r\nof the problem. Perhaps we may add one more guess and suppose that the\r\nlight of certain fishes is actually for blinding or distracting their\r\nenemies or blinding the forms on which they feed. Until this use of\r\nluminous organs has actually been observed, we can give little credence\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n(3) The light may serve as a means of recognition or a sex signal to\r\nbring the sexes together for mating. It would seem from the work of Mast\r\nand of McDermott that this is the case in the common fireflies and it\r\nmay be the case in the toad-fish, _Poricthys_, which is only luminous in\r\nthe spawning season and in the worm, _Odontosyllis_, of Bermuda, which\r\nis brilliantly luminous while swarming when the eggs and sperm are shed.\r\nIt is non-luminous at other times (Galloway and Welch, 1911.)\r\n\r\n(4) Finally, it is possible that animals with complex luminous organs,\r\nsuch as squid, fish and shrimp, actually use these as lanterns. It is\r\nsignificant that most of them are deep sea forms, living in a region of\r\nperpetual darkness, and it is perfectly logical to suppose that they\r\nmake use of their light organs for illuminating purposes.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem of the use and purpose of luminous organs is an\r\nexceedingly complex and difficult one. We have, perhaps, said enough to\r\nindicate this and may add that in most cases, so far as opinion is based\r\non actual evidence and observation, that of the layman is of as great\r\nvalue as that of the scientist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMISTRY OF LIGHT PRODUCTION, PART I\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo experiments, both performed very early in the history of\r\nBioluminescence, are of great importance in understanding the nature of\r\nanimal light. Boyle (1667), as already mentioned, proved the necessity\r\nof air for the luminescence of wood and fish and Spallanzani (1794)\r\nshowed that parts of luminous medusae gave no light when dried but if\r\nmoistened again would emit light as before. We see then, that air\r\n(oxygen), water, and some photogenic substance are necessary for the\r\nlight production. Spallanzani's experiment, which has been confirmed for\r\na great many luminous forms, shows also that animal luminescence is not\r\na _vital_ process, in the same sense that the conduction of a nerve\r\nimpulse is a vital process. A nerve loses its characteristic property of\r\nconduction on drying or maceration while luminous cells still possess\r\nthe power to luminesce after drying or maceration. Using the terminology\r\nof the older physiology we may say that \"living protoplasm\" is not\r\nnecessary for light production.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Boyle (1626-91) are of great interest, especially\r\nthose in which he studied the behavior of shining wood under the\r\nreceiver of his air pump. On October 29, 1667, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Exp. I.: Having procured a Piece of _shining Wood_, about the bigness\r\nof a groat or less, that gave a vivid Light, (for _rotten Wood_) we put\r\nit into a middle sized _Receiver_, so as it was kept from touching the\r\nCement; and the _Pump_ being set a-work, we observed not, during the 5\r\nor 6 first Exsuctions of the Air, that the splendor of the included Wood\r\nwas manifestly lessened (though it was never at all increased;) but\r\nabout the 7th Suck, it seemed to glow a little more dim, and afterwards\r\nanswered our Expectation, by losing of its Light more and more, as the\r\nAir was still farther pumped out; till at length about the 10th\r\nExsuction, (though by the removal of the Candles out of the Room, and by\r\nblack Cloaths and Hats we made the place as dark as we could, yet) we\r\ncould not perceive any light at all to proceed from the _Wood_.\r\n\r\n\"Exp. II.: Wherefore we let in the outward Air by Degrees and had the\r\npleasure to see the seemingly extinguished Light revive so fast and\r\nperfectly, that it looked to us almost like a little Flash of Lightning,\r\nand the Splendor of the Wood seemed rather greater than at all less,\r\nthan before it was put into the Receiver.\"\r\n\r\nBoyle proved that light from the wood was able to pass a vacuum and\r\nlater showed that \"shining fish\" behaved as the \"shining wood,\" but that\r\na piece of white hot iron would not regain its light on readmitting air\r\nto the exhausted receiver and that the iron lost its glow under the\r\nair-pump merely because it cooled off. A piece of glowing coal, however,\r\ndid lose its light in the absence of air and regained it on again\r\nadmitting air, provided the air had not been removed for too long. Boyle\r\nwas apparently impressed with the similarity of the light giving process\r\nin glowing coal and shining wood as he draws a comparison between the\r\ntwo which brings out the fundamental similarity of combustion\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n\"Resemblances:\r\n\r\nVII. The Things wherein I observed a Piece of _shining Wood_ and a\r\n_burning Coal_ to agree or _resemble_ each other are principally these\r\n_five_:\r\n\r\n    1. Both of them are _Luminaries_, that is, give _Light_, as having\r\n    it (if I may so speak) _residing in them_; and not like\r\n    _Looking-glasses_, or _white Bodies_, which are conspicuous only by\r\n    the _incident Beams_ of the _Sun_, or some other _luminous Body_,\r\n    which they _reflect_....\r\n\r\n    2. Both _shining Wood_ and a _burning Coal_ need the Presence of the\r\n    Air (and that too of such a _Density_ to make them continue\r\n    _shining_)....\r\n\r\n    3. Both _shining Wood_ and a _burning Coal_, having been deprived,\r\n    for a Time, of their _Light_, by the withdrawing of the contiguous\r\n    _Air_, may presently recover it by letting in fresh _Air_ upon\r\n    them....\r\n\r\n    4. Both a _quick Coal_ and _shining Wood_ will be easily quenched by\r\n    _Water_ and _many other Liquors_....\r\n\r\n    5. As a _quick Coal_ is not to be _extinguished_ by the Coldness of\r\n    the _Air_, when it is greater than ordinary; so neither is a Piece\r\n    of _shining Wood_ to be deprived of its _Light_ by the same Quality\r\n    of the _Air_....\r\n\r\nDifferences:\r\n\r\n    1. The first Difference I observed betwixt a _live Coal_ and a\r\n    _shining Wood_ is, that whereas the _Light_ of the _former_ is\r\n    readily _extinguishable_ by _Compression_ (as is obvious in the\r\n    Practice of suddenly _extinguishing_ a piece of _Coal_ by treading\r\n    upon it), I could not find that such a _Compression_ as I could\r\n    conveniently give without losing sight of its operation, would _put\r\n    out_, or much injure the _Light_, even of small Fragments of\r\n    _shining_ Wood....\r\n\r\n    2. The next _Unlikeness_ to be taken notice of betwixt _rotten Wood_\r\n    and a _kindled Coal_ is, that the latter will, in a very few\r\n    _Minutes_, be totally _extinguished_ by the withdrawing of the\r\n    _Air_; whereas a Piece of _shining Wood_, being eclipsed by the\r\n    Absence of the _Air_, and kept so for a Time, will immediately\r\n    _recover_ its _Light_ if the _Air_ be let in upon it again within\r\n    half an hour after it was first withdrawn....\r\n\r\n    3. The next _Difference_ to be mentioned is, that a _live Coal_,\r\n    being put into a small close Glass, will not continue to _burn_ for\r\n    very many _Minutes_; but a Piece of _shining Wood_ will continue to\r\n    shine for _some_ whole _Days_....\r\n\r\n    4. A _fourth Difference_ may be this: that whereas a _Coal_, as it\r\n    _burns_, sends forth Store of _Smoke_ or _Exhalations_, _luminous\r\n    Wood_ does not so.\r\n\r\n    5. A _fifth_, flowing from the former, is, that whereas a _Coal_ in\r\n    _shining_ wastes itself at a great Rate, _shining Wood_ does not....\r\n\r\n    6. The last Difference I shall take notice of betwixt the bodies\r\n    hitherto compared is, that a _quick Coal_ is actually and vehemently\r\n    hot; whereas I have not observed _shining Wood_ to be so much as\r\n    sensibly _lukewarm_.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be clearly borne in mind that if we place luminous organisms,\r\nsay bacteria or fungi, in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen and find that\r\nno light is produced, this may merely mean that certain functions of the\r\ncell are interfered with, including light production, but does not\r\nnecessarily indicate that oxygen is actually used up in the photogenic\r\nprocess. If we find, however, that extracts of luminous cells or\r\nluminous secretions devoid of cells cease to light when the oxygen is\r\nremoved and again luminesce when it is returned, we may be quite certain\r\nthat the photogenic process itself requires free oxygen. As luminous\r\nextracts of fireflies, pennatulids, ostracods, _Pholas_ and others give\r\noff no light when the oxygen is removed, we may safely conclude that for\r\nthese luminescences, oxygen is necessary. Bacteria, fungi, and\r\n_Noctiluca_, whose light also disappears in absence of oxygen, although\r\nthey are whole cells, we may by analogy also assume to require oxygen in\r\nthe photogenic process.\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier workers on fireflies and _Noctiluca_ obtained light\r\neven after placing these organisms in absence of oxygen, but they did\r\nnot realize how low is the amount of oxygen necessary to produce light.\r\nIt is difficult to remove traces of oxygen from the water, traces which\r\nare nevertheless sufficient to cause luminescence. If the organisms are\r\nnumerous, as in an emulsion of luminous bacteria, they will themselves\r\nuse up all the oxygen and the liquid soon ceases to glow except at the\r\nsurface in contact with air. We may gain an idea of the amount of oxygen\r\nnecessary for luminescence from an experiment of Beijerinck (1902). He\r\nmixed luminous bacteria with an emulsion of clover leaves containing\r\nchloroplasts and kept the two in the dark until all the oxygen was used\r\nup and the bacteria ceased to glow. If now a match was struck for a\r\nfraction of a second, sufficient oxygen was formed by photosynthesis to\r\ncause the bacteria to luminesce for a short time.\r\n\r\nExact figures on the minimal concentration of oxygen for luminescence\r\ncannot be given. The luminescent secretion of _Cypridina hilgendorfii_\r\nwill still give off much light if hydrogen containing only 0.4 per cent.\r\nof oxygen is bubbled through it, _i.e._, a partial oxygen pressure of\r\n1/250 atmosphere (3.04 mm.Hg). However, addition of a fresh emulsion of\r\nyeast cells to a glowing _Cypridina_ secretion is sufficient to rapidly\r\nextinguish the light, because the yeast is capable of utilizing the last\r\ntrace of oxygen in the mixture. Light only appears when, by agitation,\r\nwe cause more air to dissolve. The minimal concentration of oxygen for\r\nluminescence of _Cypridina_ lies somewhere between 3.04 mm. and the\r\namount which living yeast fails to extract from solution, a\r\nconcentration approaching zero. It is probably nearer the latter figure.\r\n\r\nAs the oxygen pressure is increased from 0 to about 7 mm., the intensity\r\nof the _Cypridina_ luminescence increases and at the latter figure the\r\nlight is just as bright as if the solution were saturated with air (152\r\nmm.O_{2}). Thus, the luminescence requires only a low pressure of oxygen\r\nand the similarity to the saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen is\r\nobvious. Just as haemoglobin is nearly saturated with oxygen at low\r\npressures and becomes bright red in color, so the luminous material\r\nbecomes saturated with oxygen at low pressures and glows intensely.\r\n\r\nBoyle also made many experiments to show that air was necessary for the\r\nlife of animals and the germination of seeds and showed that repeatedly\r\nrespired air was unfit for further breathing. About the same time R.\r\nHooke discovered the true meaning of respiratory movements and by\r\nforcing a blast of air continuously through the lungs with bellows, was\r\nable to keep animals alive. He concludes \"that as the bare Motion of the\r\n_Lungs_, without fresh air, contributes nothing to the life of the\r\nAnimal, he being found to survive as well as when they were not moved as\r\nwhen they were; so it was not the Subsiding or Movelessness of the\r\n_Lungs_ that was the immediate cause of death, or the stopping of the\r\ncirculation of the Blood through the _Lungs_, but the Want of a\r\nsufficient Supply of fresh Air.\" The cause of death on collapse of the\r\nlungs could not be better stated to-day. Thus combustion, respiration\r\nand luminescence of flesh or wood were early recognized as related\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nAlthough the \"gas sylvestre\" (CO_{2}) of burning charcoal and\r\nfermentation of wine was known to van Helmont (1577-1644) and Mayow\r\n(1646-1679) in 1674 showed that \"spiritus nitroaerens\" (oxygen) was\r\nresponsible for the life of animals and for combustion, a century\r\nelapsed before the true significance of these gases became known. In the\r\nmeantime the phlogiston theory of combustion had been developed, Black\r\n(1728-1799) in 1755 had rediscovered carbon dioxide (\"fixed air\") in the\r\nexpired air and Priestley (1733-1804) and Scheele (1742-1786) had both\r\nrediscovered oxygen (\"dephlogisticated air\") in 1774. About the same\r\ntime Lavoisier overthrew the phlogiston doctrine and showed that in the\r\ncombustion of organic substances water and CO_{2} are formed.\r\n\r\nLater it was realized that this slow combustion did not take place in\r\nthe lungs, or in the blood, but in the tissues cells themselves and\r\nrespiration in the chemical sense has come to mean this universal slow\r\ncombustion in the cells of the body rather than the breathing movements\r\nof the lungs themselves. In anaerobic respiration, CO_{2} is given off,\r\nbut no oxygen absorbed. In aerobic respiration, oxygen is absorbed and\r\nCO_{2} given off. In addition we know of many substances which oxidize\r\nby taking up oxygen without giving off CO_{2}. We have seen that oxygen\r\nmust be absorbed for luminescence of animals and we may now inquire\r\nwhether CO_{2} is given off and the relation between respiration and\r\nlight production.\r\n\r\nTo determine if CO_{2} is given off during luminescence it is necessary\r\nto work with fairly pure luminous materials, obtained from luminous\r\norganisms. It is impossible to use the living organisms themselves as\r\nthe CO_{2} continually respired becomes a very disturbing factor. From\r\n_Cypridina_, a small crustacean, two materials soluble in water may be\r\nprepared (_luciferin_ and _luciferase_), which will give a brilliant\r\nluminescence on mixing. It is possible to determine the H-ion\r\nconcentration of the two solutions separately and of the mixture of the\r\ntwo after the luminescence has occurred.\r\n\r\nIf CO_{2} is produced during luminescence the H-ion concentration of the\r\nluminous solution should increase. Measurements made electrometrically\r\nwith the hydrogen electrode have failed to demonstrate any increase in\r\nacidity. The PH of both solutions and of a mixture of the two is 9.04.\r\nThis would indicate that CO_{2} is not produced. As both luminous\r\nsolutions contain proteins and the luminous substances themselves are\r\nprobably proteins, which have a high buffer value, a method of this kind\r\nis none too sensitive. However, we can definitely state that not enough\r\nCO_{2} is produced to be detected and that this may be due to the buffer\r\naction of the luminous substances themselves. After all, unless\r\nluminescence is connected with respiration, we should hardly expect\r\nCO_{2} to be produced.\r\n\r\nAnother method of testing CO_{2} production is to measure the amount of\r\nheat produced during luminescence. Substances burned during respiration\r\ngive off considerable heat, one gram of glucose to CO_{2} and H_{2}O, as\r\nmuch as 4000 calories. We have seen in Chapter III that no infra-red\r\nradiation is produced in the light of the firefly. This does not mean,\r\nhowever, that no heat is produced by the reaction which produces the\r\nluminescence. A temperature change of a few thousandths or hundredths of\r\na degree would evolve no measurable radiation. Coblentz (1912) first\r\nstudied the problem of heat production in the firefly, using a\r\nthermocouple as the measuring instrument. He came to the conclusion that\r\nthe temperature of the insect was slightly lower than the temperature of\r\nthe air and that the luminous segments were slightly hotter than the\r\nnon-luminous segments, whereas a dead firefly is of the same temperature\r\nas its surroundings. No definite increase or decrease in temperature\r\ncould be established during the flash of the firefly. However, further\r\nwork on the firefly is much to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe use of a living animal for such measurements introduces a possible\r\nsource of error in that any contraction of the muscles of the animal\r\nwill produce heat which may add to an increase or mask a decrease of\r\ntemperature during luminescence. Utilization of extracts of luminous\r\nanimals containing the luciferin and luciferase mentioned above avoids\r\nthe complications due to muscular contraction. By bringing the solutions\r\nof luciferin and luciferase to the same temperature and then mixing\r\nthem one can measure any increase or decrease of temperature which\r\noccurs during the luminescence which results from mixing. We can thus\r\ngain some idea of the heat of oxidation of luciferin.\r\n\r\nAs a determination of heat production is of considerable interest the\r\nmethod will be given in some detail. Although the experiment sounds very\r\nsimple, it is actually somewhat difficult to carry out. The attainment\r\nof temperature equilibrium between two solutions is very slow when one\r\nwishes to obtain them to within 0.001 deg. C. of the same temperature. After\r\nmany attempts, the following arrangement of apparatus (Fig. 33) was\r\nfound most satisfactory. About 10 c.c. luciferin solution was placed in\r\nthe inner tube (_D_) of a special non-silvered thermos bottle (_A_).\r\nAbout 1 c.c. of luciferase solution was placed in a very thin-walled\r\nglass tube (_E_) which was immersed in the luciferin solution and\r\nconnected with a small motor so that it could be slowly but constantly\r\nrotated, thus stirring the solutions. Thermocouples (_L_ and _M_) of\r\nadvance (.008 in)--copper (No. 30, _B_ and _S_, enamel insulated) wire\r\nwere paraffined and placed in each tube and the copper wires connected\r\nthrough a copper double throw switch (_C_) with a Leeds and Northrup\r\nd'Arsonval wall galvanometer (No. 34637, silver strip suspension) of 35\r\nohms resistance and 310 megohms sensitivity. The constant temperature\r\njunctions (_N_) were placed in a large Dewar flask (_B_) filled with\r\nwater at approximately the same temperature as the luciferin solution.\r\nOne mm. galvanometer scale division represented 0.003 deg. C. and the\r\ndivision readings could be estimated to tenths. By means of a glass rod\r\n(_F_) placed in the tube containing luciferase solution, this tube\r\ncould be broken and the luciferase and luciferin solution mixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Apparatus for determining heat production\r\nduring luminescence of luciferin.

C. Dots represent readings of thermocouple in\r\ntube D; crosses readings of thermocouple in tube E.]\r\n\r\nIt was found that even after the luciferase and luciferin solutions\r\ncame to the same temperature within the thermos bottle, this was not\r\nnecessarily the same as that of the room and a slow rise or fall\r\noccurred as indicated by a slow drift of the galvanometer coil. Readings\r\nof each thermocouple on the galvanometer scale were therefore taken at\r\none-minute intervals for some time before and after mixing the luciferin\r\nand luciferase solutions and plotted as curves. Control experiments were\r\nalso carried out in exactly the same manner as the luciferin-luciferase\r\nexperiments, but water was placed in the two tubes instead of luciferin\r\nand luciferase. Figs. 34 and 35 give typical experiments with water and\r\nwith luminescent solutions, respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Curve showing temperature change when luciferin\r\nand luciferase solutions at the same temperature are mixed. 0.1\r\ngalvanometer scale division = 0.003 deg. C. Dots represent readings of\r\nthermocouple in luciferin solution; crosses, readings of thermocouple in\r\nluciferase solution.]\r\n\r\nWith both control (water) and luciferin experiments there was a slight\r\nrise in temperature on mixing the liquids in the two tubes. The average\r\nrise of five control (water) experiments was .0054 deg. C. and the average\r\nrise of five luciferin experiments was .0048 deg. C.\r\n\r\nThe average rise in temperature is no doubt due to heat from friction in\r\nmixing of the liquids and breaking of the glass tube. The difference in\r\nthe average rise of control and of luciferin experiments is so small\r\n(.0006 deg. C.) as to have little significance. We may therefore conclude\r\nthat if any temperature change occurs during the luminescent reaction it\r\nis certainly less than 0.001 deg. C. and probably less than 0.0005 deg. C., too\r\nsmall to be measured by this method.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the luciferin solution, two grams of dried _Cypridina_ were\r\ndissolved in 20 c.c. hot water and 10 c.c. of this 10 per cent. solution\r\nwas used in the thermos bottle in the above experiments. If we assume\r\nthat 1 per cent. of the dried _Cypridina_ is luciferin, 0.01 gram of\r\nluciferin on oxidation was not able to raise the temperature of the 10\r\nc.c. (in reality 11 c.c., since 1 c.c. luciferase solution was mixed\r\nwith the 10 c.c. luciferin solution) .001 deg. C. This means that 1 gram\r\nluciferin liberates _at least less_ than 10 calories during the\r\nluminescence accompanying oxidation.\r\n\r\nSince 1 gram glucose liberates 4000 calories on complete oxidation to\r\nCO_{2} and H_{2}O, it will be seen that the oxidation of luciferin is a\r\nvery different type of reaction from the oxidation of glucose. As we\r\nshall see, it is probably similar to the oxidation of reduced haemoglobin\r\nor the oxidation of leuco methylene-blue to methylene blue. According to\r\nBarcroft and Hill (1910), 1.85 calories are produced per gram of\r\nhaemoglobin oxidized. I have been unable to find figures for the heat\r\nexchange during oxidation of leuco-dyes, but it is no doubt also small.\r\nSince luciferin evolves no measurable amount of heat on oxidation, we\r\nhave very good evidence in support of that obtained by electrometric\r\nmeasurements of H-ion concentration, that no carbon dioxide is produced\r\nduring luminescence of luminous animals.\r\n\r\nIn most animal cells it is perfectly clear that luminescence does not\r\naccompany respiration, since respiration is a continuous process,\r\nwhereas light is only produced on stimulation. It is true that on\r\nstimulation respiration is accelerated, and we might suppose that\r\nluminescence is an accompaniment of accelerated respiratory oxidations;\r\nbut this is not the case, for in luminous animals a rise in temperature\r\nof ten degrees centigrade will accelerate the respiratory oxidations 250\r\nper cent. without necessarily causing the production of light.\r\n\r\nIn fungi and bacteria, on the other hand, which continually emit light,\r\nit is quite natural to suppose that the light is an accompaniment of\r\nrespiration, just as we know the heat of these forms to be. This view\r\nwas accepted by such of the earlier workers as Fabre in 1855, who found\r\nthat luminous portions of a mushroom, _Agaricus olearius_, gave off more\r\nCO_{2} (4.41 c.c. CO_{2} per gram in 36 hours at 12 deg. C.) than\r\nnon-luminous portions (2.88 c.c. CO_{2} per gram in 36 hours at 12 deg. C.).\r\nThis experiment has never been repeated and there are many reasons\r\nbesides luminescence why one piece of fungus might have a more rapid\r\nrespiratory rate than another piece. It is not true that rapidly\r\nrespiring plant tissues, such as germinating seeds or the spadix of\r\n_Araceae_, are luminous, although they produce considerable heat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is very easy to prove that luminescence, even in\r\nbacteria, is not connected with respiration. Thus, Beijerinck (1889 _c_)\r\nfound that of several species of luminous bacteria studied by him, one,\r\n_Bacterium phosphorescens_, was a facultative anaerobe and would grow,\r\n_i.e._, multiply, but not luminesce in the absence of oxygen. Some\r\nforms, ordinarily producing light, will grow, but fail to luminesce at\r\nhigh temperatures. Beijerinck (1915) has recently found that these\r\nindividuals may, by continued cultivation at high temperatures, form\r\nnon-luminous strains which fail to luminesce when again brought into\r\nlower temperatures, favorable for luminescence. These non-luminous\r\nmutants occasionally give rise to atavistic brilliantly luminous forms.\r\nBeijerinck also finds that after exposure of _Photobacter splendidum_ to\r\nultra-violet or strong sunlight, radium or mesothorium rays,\r\nluminescence continues but no growth occurs. There is thus ample\r\nevidence that growth and respiration are properties quite distinct and\r\nseparable from luminescence. Indeed, respiration increases continuously\r\nup to a relatively high maximum whereas luminescence falls off rapidly\r\nabove a relatively low optimum. McKenney (1902) found also that _Bacillus\r\nphosphorescens_ could grow rapidly in 0.5 per cent. ether without\r\nproducing light.\r\n\r\nLuminescence has been compared in bacteria to pigment formation, as\r\nrather definite cultural conditions are necessary for realization of\r\nboth chromogenic and photogenic function. Some pigment-formers, as\r\n_Bacillus pyocyaneus_, which produces a water-soluble green pigment,\r\nremain colorless under anaerobic conditions. A colorless chromogen is\r\nformed, which oxidizes to the green pigment in the air. If this\r\ncolorless chromogen produced light during its oxidation as well as green\r\npigment, we would have a case of both chromogenic and photogenic\r\nfunction combined in one species of bacterium. Luminescence involves\r\nsomething more than respiration, an oxidation of a very definite and\r\nparticular kind.\r\n\r\nSince Spallanzani's observation that the luminous material of medusae\r\ncould be dried, and upon moistening would again give light, many\r\nconfirmatory observations have been made on other forms. _Pyrosoma_,\r\n_Pholas_, _Phyllirrhoe_, fireflies, _Pyrophorus_, copepods, ostracods,\r\npennatulids, fungi, and bacteria can all be dessicated and the\r\nphotogenic material preserved for a greater or less time. In a\r\ndessicator filled with CaCl_{2}, dried luminous bacteria lose, after a\r\nfew months, their power to give light on being moistened. On the other\r\nhand, ostracods and copepods will still luminesce after years of\r\ndessication. The luminous material in the latter case appears capable of\r\nindefinite preservation, but it is possible that the quick loss of\r\nphotogenic power with dried luminous bacteria is merely an indication\r\nthat they contain very little photogenic substance and that the dried\r\nostracods would also in time lose their power to luminesce. It is\r\ncertainly a fact that the amount of luminous material in a single gland\r\ncell of an ostracod is vastly greater than that in the same mass of\r\nbacterial colony.\r\n\r\nWhen the dried powdered luminous material of an ostracod is sprinkled\r\nover the surface of water, it goes into solution and leaves luminous\r\ndiffusion and convection trails plainly visible in the water. Many\r\nluminous marine forms give off a phosphorescent slime when they are\r\nhandled, which adheres to the fingers. It is not surprising that this\r\nluminous matter should have early received a name. In 1872, Phipson\r\ncalled it _noctilucin_ and described some of its properties. He regarded\r\nthe luminous matter which can be scraped from dead fish (luminous\r\nbacteria) and the mucous secretion of _Scolopendra electrica_ or the\r\nluminous matter of the glowworm to be this material, noctilucin, which,\r\n\"in moist condition, takes up oxygen and gives off CO_{2} and when dry\r\nappears like mucin.\" Phipson says that it forms an oily layer over the\r\nseas in summer (he probably refers to masses of dinoflagellates), is\r\nliquid at ordinary temperatures and less dense than water, smells a\r\nlittle like caprylic acid, is insoluble in water but miscible with it,\r\ninsoluble in alcohol and ether, dissolves with decomposition in mineral\r\nacids and alkalies and contains no phosphorus. We can see from this\r\ndescription that the word \"noctilucin\" does not indicate a chemical\r\nindividual, but it is the earliest attempt to definitely designate the\r\nluminous substance.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a definite substance oxidizing and causing the light has\r\nbeen upheld by a number of investigators, and many years later Molisch\r\ncalled this substance the _photogen_. He contrasts the \"photogen theory\"\r\nwith certain other views of light production, which may be spoken of as\r\n\"vital theories,\" notably those of Pflueger (1875), who looked upon\r\nluminescence as a sign of intense respiration, and of Beijerinck (1915),\r\nwho regarded the light as an accompaniment of the formation of living\r\nmatter from peptone.\r\n\r\nFortunately biological science has advanced beyond the stage where a\r\nliving process can be explained by calling it a vital process, and we\r\nmust fall back upon the idea of a photogen oxidizing with light\r\nproduction. Indeed, it is now possible to go much further than this and\r\ndescribe the properties of the photogen, but we must not lose sight of\r\nthe fact that it was recognized very early in the history of\r\nBioluminescence, that water, oxygen, and a photogenic substance were\r\nnecessary for light production.\r\n\r\nA very great advance in our knowledge of the chemistry of the problem\r\nwas made by Dubois in 1885. He showed that if one dips the luminous\r\norgan of _Pyrophorus_ in hot water, the light disappears and will not\r\nreturn again. Also if one grinds up a luminous organ the mass will glow\r\nfor some time but the light soon disappears. If one brings the\r\npreviously heated organ in contact with the unheated triturated organ it\r\nwill again give off light. Later, Dubois showed that the same experiment\r\ncould be performed with the luminous tissues of _Pholas dactylus_. A\r\nhot-water extract of the luminous tissue, and a cold-water extract of\r\nthe luminous tissue, allowed to stand until the light disappears, will\r\nagain produce light if mixed together. Dubois (1887 _b_) advanced the\r\ntheory that in the hot-water extract there is a substance, luciferin,\r\nnot destroyed by heating, which oxidizes with light production in the\r\npresence of an enzyme, luciferase, which is destroyed on heating. The\r\nluciferase is present together with luciferin in the cold-water extract,\r\nbut the luciferin is soon oxidized and luciferase alone remains. Mixing\r\na solution of luciferin and luciferase always results in light\r\nproduction until the luciferin is again oxidized. Similar substances\r\nhave been found by me in the American fireflies, _Photinus_ and\r\n_Photuris_, the Japanese firefly, _Luciola_, and in the ostracod\r\ncrustacean, _Cypridina hilgendorfii_. Crozier[6] reports that they exist\r\nalso in _Ptychodera_, a balanoglossid. I have been unable to demonstrate\r\ntheir existence in luminous bacteria; in the annelid, _Chaetopterus_; the\r\npennatulids, _Cavernularia_ and _Pennatula_; the squid, _Watasenia_;\r\nand the fish, _Monocentris japonica_. E. B. Harvey (1917) could not\r\ndemonstrate them in _Noctiluca_. There are several reasons why the\r\nexistence of such bodies might be difficult to demonstrate, but these\r\nreasons cannot be considered here. We thus see that the photogen is in\r\nreality of dual nature, that two substances are necessary for light\r\nproduction and that they may be very readily separated because of\r\ndifference in resistance to heating. In this respect Bioluminescence is\r\nsimilar to some other biological processes, notably to certain immune\r\nreactions and to certain enzyme actions.\r\n\r\n[6] Private communication.\r\n\r\nThus, for the haemolysis of foreign red blood corpuscles, a specific\r\nimmune body (_amboceptor or substance sensibilatrice_) not destroyed by\r\nmoderate heating, and a thermolabile complement (_alexin_) are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nFor the alcoholic fermentation of glucose by the zymase of yeast juice\r\ntwo substances are also necessary. The zymase is made up of a heat\r\nresistant, dialyzing component, the co-enzyme, and a non-dialyzing\r\nsubstance, destroyed on boiling, the enzyme proper. Both must be present\r\nfor alcoholic fermentation of glucose to proceed and the two may be\r\nseparated by dialysis or by their difference in resistance to heating.\r\nSeveral other characteristics of living cells are known to depend on the\r\njoint action of two substances, one thermolabile, the other\r\nthermostable. The reducing action of tissues, according to Bach,\r\nrequires a reducing enzyme proper or perhydridase and some easily\r\noxidizable substance, such as an aldehyde. The aldehyde has been spoken\r\nof as the co-enzyme.\r\n\r\nBecause of the necessity of thermostable and thermolabile substances for\r\nlight production in luminous animals and because I was unable to oxidize\r\nthe thermostable material of _Cypridina_ with such oxidizing agents as\r\nKMnO_{4}, H_{2}O_{2}, blood and H_{2}O_{2}, BaO_{2}, etc., I called the\r\nheat resistant substance of _Cypridina_, \"_photophelein_\" (from _phos_,\r\nlight and _opheleo_, to assist), comparable to co-zymase, and the heat\r\nsensitive substance of _Cypridina_, \"photogenin\" (from _phos_, light and\r\n_gennao_, to produce), comparable to the zymase proper of yeast. In mode\r\nof preparation and properties, the photophelein of _Cypridina_ was also\r\ncomparable to the luciferin of _Pholas_ and the _photogenin_ of\r\n_Cypridina_ to the luciferase of _Pholas_. I also regarded photogenin as\r\nthe source of the light (hence the name), because a solution of\r\n_Cypridina_ photogenin (=_Pholas_ luciferase) will give light on mixing\r\nwith crystals of salt and other substances which could not possibly be\r\noxidized. I later found, however, that this result was due to the fact\r\nthat the photogenin solution contained some of the thermostable\r\nsubstance (luciferin) bound (combined or adsorbed), and that this was\r\nfreed by the salt crystals and oxidized with light production. I have\r\nconsequently abandoned the view that the system of substances concerned\r\nin light production is similar to the zymase--co-zymase system of\r\nyeast--and have adopted Dubois' term, luciferase (=_photogenin_) for the\r\nthermolabile material, and luciferin (=_photophelein_) for the\r\nthermostable material.\r\n\r\nThe luciferin of _Cypridina_ differs from that of _Pholas_ in that it\r\nwill not oxidize with light production with any oxidizing agents that I\r\nhave tried, and will give no light with luciferase from _Pholas_. It\r\ndoes, however, oxidize spontaneously in solution, although no light\r\naccompanies this oxidation.\r\n\r\nI believe that for accuracy and definiteness we must designate the\r\nluciferins and luciferases from different animals by prefixing the\r\ngeneric name of the animal and speak of _Pholas_ luciferin, _Cypridina_\r\nluciferase, _Pyrophorus_ luciferase, etc. In extracts of many\r\nnon-luminous animals Dubois has found oxidizing agents which can oxidize\r\n_Pholas_ luciferin with light production and I have confirmed this for\r\n_Pholas_, but I have not found any such substances in non-luminous\r\nanimals which will oxidize _Cypridina_ luciferin with light production.\r\nI have found in extracts of non-luminous animals substances which will\r\nliberate the bound luciferin in a concentrated _Cypridina_ luciferase\r\nsolution. The luciferin can then be oxidized by the luciferase and light\r\nappears. Their effect is similar to that of salt crystals and I suggest\r\nthat they be called _photopheleins_, substances that assist in the\r\nluciferin-luciferase reaction by liberating bound luciferin. One of the\r\nbest ways of freeing a solution of luciferase from bound luciferin is to\r\nshake with chloroform. We can then do away with the disturbing effects\r\nof bound luciferin.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that luciferin must be formed from some precursor in the\r\ncell and following the usual biochemical terminology, Dubois has called\r\nit _proluciferin_ or _preluciferin_, and believes that it is converted\r\ninto luciferin by an enzyme co-luciferase. The experiments to prove the\r\nexistence of proluciferin were first made by Dubois on _Pholas_ in 1907\r\nand have since been amplified (1917 _a_; 1918 _a_ and _b_).\r\n\r\nIn order to understand these experiments it must be borne in mind that\r\nDubois prepares luciferin from _Pholas_ in three ways: (1) By\r\nprecipitating the viscid luminous fluid from the siphons with 95 deg.\r\nalcohol and dissolving the precipitate in water (1901_a_, 1907). (2) By\r\nextracting the luminous organs with 90 deg. alcohol in a closed vessel for\r\ntwelve hours and filtering (1896). (3) By heating the viscid luminous\r\nfluid to 70 deg. C. Apparently _Pholas_ luciferin is sparingly soluble in\r\nalcohol as it can be obtained either in an alcoholic extract (method 2)\r\nor by precipitation with alcohol (method 1). Proluciferin (called\r\n_preluciferine_ in a later paper, 1917 _a_, 1918 _a_), is prepared by\r\nmethods 1 or 2 except that fatigued siphons, from which luciferin has\r\nbeen removed by washing, are used (1907, 1917 _a_, 1918 _a_).\r\nPreluciferin can also be obtained on boiling an extract of the luminous\r\norgan of _Pholas_ because luciferin (at 70 deg.), luciferase (at 60 deg.) and a\r\nco-luciferase are all destroyed below the boiling point (1917 _a_).\r\n\r\nCo-luciferase is prepared (1) by heating a luciferase solution to 65 deg.\r\n(1917 _a_) or (2) by extracting with water portions of the siphon of\r\n_Pholas_ which have previously been macerated and well extracted with\r\nalcohol (1918 _a_). Long-continued treatment with alcohol apparently\r\ndestroys the luciferase without affecting the co-luciferase. On mixing a\r\nsolution of preluciferin with one of co-luciferase and allowing them to\r\nstand for 8-10 hours, luciferase is formed and can be recognized by the\r\nfact that it will give light with a crystal of KMnO_{4}. Preluciferine\r\ndoes not do this.\r\n\r\nRecently Dubois (1918 _a_) states that preluciferine is nothing but\r\ntaurine and that taurine occurs in large quantities in _Pholas_ and is\r\ntransformed into luciferine by the action of co-luciferase. Not only\r\ntaurine, but also Byla's peptone, egg lecithin, and esculin can be\r\nconverted into luciferine by co-luciferase, and since esculin, a\r\nglucoside, is so transformed, Dubois believes this proves that\r\nco-luciferase belongs to the hydrolases. Indeed, it proves too much.\r\nLuciferin must have an extraordinary chemical structure if it can be\r\nformed by hydrolysis of such diverse compounds as peptone, lecithin,\r\nesculin and taurine. A glance at the structural formula of esculin and\r\ntaurine is sufficient to emphasize the diverse nature of these two\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Taurine]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Esculin]\r\n\r\nI believe that in these experiments Dubois has been working with an\r\noxidation product of luciferin, what I have called _oxyluciferin_,\r\nrather than a pro-substance. The mode of preparation of _Pholas_\r\npreluciferin and _Pholas_ co-luciferase is such as could be used in the\r\npreparation of _Cypridina_ oxyluciferin, and it seems more logical to\r\nlook for the presence of _Pholas_ oxyluciferin in one or both of Dubois'\r\nextracts rather than believe that luciferin can be formed from both\r\ntaurine and esculin. When the co-luciferase solution stands with the\r\npreluciferin solution we would in reality have not the formation of\r\nluciferin from preluciferin, but the formation of luciferin from\r\noxyluciferin, by some reducing agent in the mixture. Indeed, in a very\r\nrecent paper Dubois (1919 _c_) takes the view that his co-luciferase is\r\na reducing enzyme which forms luciferin by reduction (presumably from\r\noxidized luciferin) and no mention is made of preluciferin.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, obvious that when luciferin oxidizes, some oxidation\r\nproducts must be formed. Most observers have assumed the oxidation\r\nproducts of luciferin to be relatively simple and to represent a rather\r\ncomplete breaking down of the luciferin molecule. Carbon dioxide was\r\nmentioned by Phipson (1872) as being formed. We have just seen that no\r\ncarbon dioxide is formed during the oxidation of _Cypridina_ luciferin\r\nand there is evidence that no fundamental change at all occurs. It is\r\nfor this reason that I have called the oxidation product of luciferin\r\n_oxyluciferin_.[7] As we shall later see, the change luciferin\r\noxyluciferin is to be compared to the oxidation of colorless dyes\r\n(leuco-compounds) to the colored dye. The chemical properties of\r\noxyluciferin are similar to those of luciferin and the oxyluciferin can\r\nbe readily reduced to luciferin again.\r\n\r\n[7] It is unfortunate that Dubois (1918 b) has used the term\r\noxyluciferine in a quite different sense from the present use. He\r\nregards oxyluciferine as a substance still capable of giving light by\r\nautooxidation, and represents the steps in luminescence as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Co-luciferase + preluciferine = luciferine.\r\n\r\n   Luciferase    + luciferine    = oxyluciferine.\r\n\r\n   Oxyluciferine + oxygene       = lumiere.\"\r\n\r\nI should represent them as follows:\r\n\r\n  Luciferin + oxygen <=> oxyluciferin.\r\n\r\nThe reaction proceeds to right with light production only in presence of\r\nluciferase.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the fluorescent substance of _Pyrophorus_ and\r\nfireflies, which Dubois first called _pyrophorin_, but later, adopting\r\nMcDermott's terminology, speaks of as _luciferesceine_. This Dubois\r\nregards as a substance intensifying the light and modifying its color by\r\nchanging invisible into visible rays. As we have seen, this theory,\r\nwhile attractive, will not stand the test of critical examination.\r\n\r\nPhipson's noctilucin, while the first name for the photogen of luminous\r\nanimals, is too vague a substance, chemically, to warrant a retention of\r\nthe term. Of the names, luciferin, luciferase, preluciferin or\r\nproluciferin, co-luciferase, photogenin, photophelein, oxyluciferin,\r\nluciferesceine, I believe that only proluciferin, luciferin,\r\noxyluciferin, luciferase and photophelein stand for substances which are\r\nreally significant for the theory of light production. _Luciferin_ is\r\nthe heat resistant, dialyzable substance which takes up oxygen and\r\noxidizes with light production in the presence of the heat sensitive,\r\nnon-dialyzing, enzyme-like _luciferase_. The luciferin must come from\r\nsome precursor, _proluciferin_, but I have been unable to demonstrate\r\nthe existence of this body in _Cypridina_ and know nothing definite of\r\nits properties. The luciferin oxidizes to _oxyluciferin_ which has the\r\nsame chemical properties as the luciferin itself and may be reduced to\r\nluciferin again by reducing substances in luminous and other animals or\r\nby inorganic reducing agents. _Photophelein_ is a name for substances in\r\nvarious animal or plant extracts which are capable of liberating\r\nluciferin from some bound condition in solutions containing luciferase.\r\nUnder this term are included a number of unknown, probably quite\r\ndifferent substances, some of which are thermostable and others\r\nthermolabile.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Bioluminescence is an oxyluminescence, that the light\r\nis probably due to the oxidation of a compound, luciferin, in presence\r\nof air and water and that the oxidation is accelerated by an enzyme-like\r\nsubstance, luciferase. We also saw in Chapter 2 that light production is\r\nof fairly common occurrence during the oxidation of many organic\r\ncompounds, provided the oxidation is carried out in the proper way. Many\r\nof these organic compounds must be oxidized by relatively strong alkali\r\nor such strong oxidizing agents as would have a very deleterious action\r\non living cells. In 1913, Ville and Derrien, in a short note to the\r\nFrench Academy, \"Catalyse Biochemique d'une Oxydation Luminescente,\"\r\nshow that _lophin_ could be oxidized by vertebrate blood in the presence\r\nof H_{2}O_{2}. In the same year Dubois (1913) found that esculin, the\r\nglucoside from horse chestnut bark, would also oxidize and luminesce in\r\npresence of blood and H_{2}O_{2}. In these cases the haemoglobin of the\r\nblood acts as a catalyst, transferring oxygen from the H_{2}O_{2} to\r\nesculin or lophin and is to be compared to luciferase, except that\r\nluciferase does not require the presence of H_{2}O_{2}.\r\n\r\nAs the haemoglobin does not lose this power on boiling, whereas\r\nluciferase does, the analogy is far from perfect. Many oxygen carriers\r\nare known, however, which may be destroyed on boiling their solutions,\r\nnamely, the peroxidases of plant juices. Esculin will not luminesce with\r\nperoxidase and H_{2}O_{2}, but pyrogallol or gallic acid will. If one\r\nmixes a test tube containing pyrogallol solution + H_{2}O_{2} with\r\npotato or turnip juice or almost any plant extract, a yellowish\r\nluminescence appears. The plant extract loses the power to cause such\r\nluminescence on boiling and the peroxidase will not dialyze. It is, of\r\ncourse, comparable to luciferase and acts on the thermostable,\r\ndialyzable pyrogallol-H_{2}O_{2} mixture, which is comparable to\r\nluciferin. Curiously enough, although many hydroxyphenol and\r\namino-phenol compounds can be oxidized by peroxidase and H_{2}O_{2},\r\nonly pyrogallol and gallic acid will oxidize with light production. Many\r\nother oxidizers can take the place of the peroxidase. A list of these is\r\ngiven on page 151. No other peroxide can take the place of H_{2}O_{2}\r\nwith peroxidases as oxidizers, but a few can replace H_{2}O_{2} with\r\nother oxidizers. This is brought out in Table 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 7\r\n\r\n_Peroxides Giving Light with Pyrogallol and Oxidizers_\r\n\r\n  Key to column headings:\r\n   [A]: Oxidizer.

As Dubois\r\n(1914 _a_) expresses it, we are dealing in luminous organisms with \"1 deg.\r\nune luminescence; 2 deg. une chemiluminescence; 3 deg. une oxyluminescence; 4 deg.\r\nune zymoluminescence.\r\n\r\n\"Ou si l'on bien admettre que les zymases sont encore quelque chose de\r\nvivant, une Biozymooxyluminescence.\" Perhaps it is not really necessary\r\nto admit that the enzymes are living in order that we may adequately\r\nvisualize the nature of the photogenic process.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter the properties of the three principal substances,\r\nluciferin, oxyluciferin and luciferase, will be studied more carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMISTRY OF LIGHT PRODUCTION, PART II\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Radziszewski's experiments on the oxidation of oils in alcoholic\r\nsolutions of alkali, most of the early workers on Bioluminescence\r\ntacitly assumed that the oxidizable material was fat or a fat-like\r\nsubstance. Support was given to this view by the occurrence in cells of\r\ngranules or globules from which the light was seen to come. We now know\r\nthat these bodies are not fat droplets and that neither luciferin nor\r\nluciferase are soluble in such fat solvents as ether, chloroform, benzol\r\nor benzine. Phipson's description of the properties of noctilucin are\r\ntoo crude and inaccurate to be considered. Dubois did not study the\r\nchemical properties of luciferin and luciferase from _Pyrophorus_, the\r\nfirst form with which he worked, except to point out that _Pyrophorus_\r\nluciferase was destroyed on heating and was precipitated by alcohol\r\nwhile the _Pyrophorus_ luciferin was not so affected. Luciferin was\r\nfound only in the luminous organ of _Pyrophorus_, not in the blood;\r\nluciferase probably exists throughout the animal.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] Private communication from R. Dubois.\r\n\r\nPHOLAS LUCIFERIN.--In a series of papers since 1887 Dubois has studied\r\nthe chemical properties of _Pholas_ luciferin and _Pholas_ luciferase.\r\nHe finds the luciferin to be destroyed above 70 deg. C., to dialyze slowly,\r\nto oxidize with light production in the presence of _Pholas_ luciferase,\r\nKMnO_{4}, H_{2}O_{2}, haematine and H_{2}O_{2}, BaO_{2}, PbO_{2},\r\nhypochlorites, and the blood of various marine mollusks and crustacea.\r\nIt is insoluble in fat solvents but forms a colloidal solution in water\r\nfrom which it is precipitated unchanged by picric acid, alcohol at 82 deg.,\r\nand (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}. It is not precipitated by NaCl, MgSO_{4} or\r\nacetic and carbonic acids, except in presence of neutral salts. It forms\r\nan insoluble alkali albumin with NH_{4}OH. Dubois (1887 _a_) stated at\r\none time that it could be crystallized and has spoken of it as belonging\r\nto several different classes of substances, proteose, nucleoprotein,\r\nalbumin. Most recently he describes luciferin as a natural albumin\r\nhaving acid properties. It occurs only in luminous, not in non-luminous\r\nanimals, and is found in all parts of the mantle, especially the\r\nsiphons. It does not occur in non-luminous parts of the mollusk. No\r\nphotographs of luciferin crystals have ever been published.\r\n\r\nPHOLAS LUCIFERASE.--_Pholas_ luciferase has all the properties of an\r\nenzyme, is destroyed at 60 deg. C., is non-dialyzable, insoluble in fat\r\nsolvents, but forms a colloidal solution in water. It is not affected by\r\n1 per cent. NaF but its activity is suspended in saturated salt\r\nsolutions, sugar or glycerine, and it may be preserved in this way, its\r\nactivity returning on dilution. It is digested by trypsin and slowly\r\ndestroyed by the fat solvent anaesthetics, such as chloroform. For this\r\nreason Dubois regards it as an oxidizing enzyme similar to the oxydones\r\nof Batelli and Stern. Because he found iron in an extract of _Pholas_\r\ndialyzed for a long time against running water, Dubois considers that it\r\nis associated with iron, and reports that it will oxidize the ordinary\r\noxidase reagents, such as pyrogallol, gum guaiac, a-naphthol and\r\npara-phenylene-diamine, etc. It remains to be proved, however, that\r\nluciferase and not the oxidizing systems such as occur in all cells are\r\nresponsible for the coloration of these reagents. Dubois has found\r\nluciferases or substances capable of giving light with _Pholas_\r\nluciferin in the blood of many non-luminous crustacea and mollusks (in\r\n_Barnea candida_, _Solen_, _Cardium edulis_, _Ostraea_ and _Mytilus_).\r\n\r\nCYPRIDINA LUCIFERIN.--Despite the large amount that has been written on\r\nluminous animals, Dubois' work on _Pholas_ and my own on _Cypridina_ and\r\nthe firefly are the only truly chemical studies that give us any idea of\r\nthe nature of the photogenic substances in any luminous animal. In many\r\nways _Cypridina_ luciferin is similar to _Pholas_ luciferin, but the two\r\ndiffer in a sufficient number of points to make certain that they are\r\nnot identical substances. As I have emphasized above, we should speak\r\nnot of luciferin and luciferase but of the _luciferins_ and the\r\n_luciferases_. The luciferins, as the oxidizable substances, must claim\r\nfirst attention. They are more simple substances than the luciferases.\r\nIf we are to produce light artificially in the same way that animals do,\r\nthe luciferins must be synthesized. The luciferin of _Pholas_ will\r\nluminesce with KMnO_{4} and other oxidizing agents, and, although I have\r\nnot yet succeeded in oxidizing _Cypridina_ luciferin with oxidizing\r\nagents, I have no doubt but that some inorganic catalyzer will be found\r\nto take the place of luciferase and accelerate oxidation of _Cypridina_\r\nluciferin with light production.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable peculiarity of _Cypridina_ luciferin is its\r\nstability. In my first paper on _Cypridina_ I stated that luciferin was\r\nnot destroyed by momentary boiling but would be destroyed if boiled four\r\nor five minutes; also, that it was unstable at room temperatures and\r\nwould disappear from solution in the course of a day or so. The reason\r\nfor this is that luciferin oxidizes even in absence of luciferase and\r\nwill then no longer give light with luciferase. This spontaneous\r\noxidation, which occurs without light production, can be prevented by\r\nkeeping the luciferin in a hydrogen atmosphere or by the addition of\r\nacid. Under these conditions the luciferin can be boiled without\r\ndestruction or preserved for months without deterioration. The rapid\r\ndisappearance of luciferin from neutral or alkaline solution on boiling\r\nin the air is entirely due to the more rapid oxidation at the boiling\r\npoint. As the oxidation product, oxyluciferin, can be readily\r\nreconverted into luciferin again, we can not consider luciferin unstable\r\nin the sense that its molecule is actually destroyed as is the case when\r\nluciferase is boiled.\r\n\r\nNot only is luciferin stable on boiling but it will actually withstand\r\nboiling for 10 hours with 20 per cent. HCl (by weight, sp. gr. = 1.1) or\r\nwith 4 per cent. H_{2}SO_{4}. After one day of boiling with 20 per cent.\r\nHCl the luciferin was completely destroyed and with 4 per cent.\r\nH_{2}SO_{4} destruction was almost complete. In these cases there was no\r\nquestion of a mere oxidation to oxyluciferin, as no oxyluciferin could\r\nbe demonstrated after boiling with such strong acids. An actual\r\ndestruction, probably an hydrolysis of the luciferin molecule, occurred.\r\nWe shall have occasion to refer to this again in considering the protein\r\nnature of luciferin. It must be borne in mind that many proteins require\r\nfour or five days' boiling with 20 per cent. HCl for complete hydrolysis\r\nto amino-acids. Luciferin forms a solution in water, probably colloidal,\r\nalthough the luciferin will dialyze through parchment or collodion\r\nmembranes. It is rather readily adsorbed by various finely divided\r\nmaterials such as bone black, Fe(OH)_{3}, kaolin, talc and CaCo_{3}. It\r\nis not destroyed by any of the enzyme solutions which I have tried.\r\nThese include such as are widely divergent in action: pepsin HCl,\r\ntrypsin, erepsin, salivary and malt diastase, yeast invertase, urease,\r\nrennin and the enzymes of dried spleen, kidney and liver substances.\r\n\r\nBy extracting the dried Cypridinas ground to a powder, the solubility of\r\nluciferin in non-aqueous solvents could be easily studied, and by adding\r\nsuch reagents as dilute acids, alkalies, neutral salts and the\r\nalkaloidal reagents to an aqueous solution of luciferin the general\r\nbiochemical behavior of luciferin can be quite accurately stated. For\r\nconvenience the results of this study are given in Table 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 8\r\n\r\n_Properties of Photogenic Substances from Cypridina_\r\n\r\n

(NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}, we may conclude that it occurs in water in the\r\ncolloidal state. This excludes it from belonging to one of the numerous\r\ngroups of biochemical compounds occurring in true solution and places it\r\namong the known groups of colloidal substances, the soaps, proteins,\r\npolysaccharides, phospholipins, galactolipins (_cerebrosides_), tannins\r\nor saponins. It is not a polysaccharide because nearly completely\r\nprecipitated by phosphotungstic acid, nor a soap because not\r\nprecipitated by calcium salts, nor a phospho- or galactolipin because\r\ninsoluble in benzine, hot or cold. It gives no tannin or saponin tests.\r\nOnly the protein group remains, and of the eighteen protein classes\r\nrecognized by the American Society of Biochemists, the general\r\nproperties of luciferin indicate that it should be placed among the\r\nnatural proteoses, somewhere on the borderland between the proteoses and\r\npeptones. The fact that luciferin will dialyze, although almost\r\ncompletely salted out by (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}, is strong evidence in favor\r\nof placing it in such a position.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, luciferin has two properties which to say the least\r\nare unusual for proteins. I refer to its solubility in alcohols,\r\nacetone, esters, etc., and non-digestibility by trypsin or erepsin,\r\nwhich have almost universal proteolytic power.\r\n\r\nThe best known class of proteins soluble in alcohol is the prolamines of\r\nplants, but the prolamines are insoluble in water and in absolute\r\nalcohol. Zein, the prolamine of corn, is soluble in 90 per cent. ethyl,\r\nmethyl, and propyl alcohols, in glycerol heated to 150 deg. C., and in\r\nglacial acetic acid. Recently Osborne and Wakeman (1918) have described\r\na protein from milk having solubilities similar to those of gliadin, the\r\nprolamine of wheat. Welker (1912) has described a substance, obtained\r\nfrom Witte's peptone, giving the biuret, Millon, and Hopkins-Cole tests,\r\nwhich is soluble in water and absolute alcohol but not in ether, and it\r\nis possible that others of the peptones are soluble in absolute alcohol.\r\nOn the other hand, some proteins in the absence of salts form colloidal\r\nsolutions in strong alcohol from which they may be precipitated by an\r\nappropriate salt. As the absolute alcohol extract of _Cypridinae_ was\r\nmade from dry material containing the salts of sea water, some salt was\r\npresent, but there is always the possibility of sol formation.\r\n\r\nIf we extract dried _Cypridinae_, which have previously been thoroughly\r\nextracted with benzine or ether, with 800 c.c. of boiling absolute\r\nalcohol for an hour, filter the alcohol extract through blotting paper\r\nand hardened filter paper, quickly evaporate the filtrate to dryness on\r\nthe water bath, and dissolve the residue in a small quantity of water\r\nsaturated with CO_{2},[9] we obtain a yellow opalescent solution which\r\ngives a bright light with luciferase. This solution contains some\r\nprotein or protein derivatives as it gives a very faint Millon\r\nreaction, a good positive ninhydrin test, reddish blue in color, but no\r\nbiuret reaction. It precipitates with tannic and phosphotungstic acids\r\nbut not with picric, acetic, trichloracetic, or chromic acids. The\r\nextract gives a faint Molisch reaction for carbohydrates. As the\r\nevidence points to the presence of some protein products in the absolute\r\nalcohol extract of _Cypridinae_, it is possible that this protein is\r\nluciferin. It should be emphasized, however, that the Millon reaction\r\nwas very faint, although the ninhydrin was quite marked and the biuret\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n[9] To make the solution slightly acid and prevent oxidation of the\r\nluciferin.\r\n\r\nAlthough luciferin is not digested by trypsin, even after five days at\r\n38 deg. C., it does hydrolyze with mineral acids after about 16 hours'\r\nboiling. Some proteins, the albuminoids and racemized proteins, resist\r\ntryptic digestion but yield to acid hydrolysis. We know also that some\r\nNH-CO linkages of proteins are broken down with great difficulty by\r\ntrypsin as it is difficult to obtain a tryptic digest of protein which\r\ndoes not give the biuret reaction, and the work of Fischer and\r\nAbderhalden has shown that certain artificial polypeptides are not\r\ndigested by pure activated pancreatic juice.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, three possibilities: Luciferin is (1) either a natural\r\nproteose not attacked by trypsin, or (2) if attacked by trypsin its\r\ndecomposition products (presumably amino-acids) still contain the group\r\noxidizable with light production, or (3) it is not protein at all. I\r\nhave been unable to oxidize with light production various mixtures of\r\namino-acids (from tryptic digestion of beef and casein, or the acid\r\nhydrolysis products of luciferin itself) by means of luciferase, and\r\nconsequently am led to believe that _Cypridina_ luciferin is either a\r\nnew natural proteose, soluble in absolute alcohol and not digested by\r\ntrypsin or that it belongs to some other group than the proteins. The\r\nabsence of a biuret reaction would point in that direction and the\r\nquestion must await further study.\r\n\r\n_Cypridina_ luciferin is found in the luminous gland of the animal and\r\npossibly in parts non-luminous as well as in the luminous organ. This is\r\ntrue of the luciferin from fireflies which is found throughout the body\r\nof _Luciola_, _Photuris_ and _Photinus_.\r\n\r\nCYPRIDINA LUCIFERASE.--Luciferase, on the other hand, has _all_ the\r\nproperties of a complex protein. It will not dialyze through collodion\r\nor parchment membranes, is soluble only in aqueous solvents, and hence\r\nprecipitated by alcohol and acetone, digested by proteolytic enzymes,\r\nreadily changed by contact with dilute acid and alkali and irreversibly\r\ncoagulated on boiling. It is completely salted out of solution by\r\nsaturation with (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4} and nearly completely precipitated by\r\nthe alkaloidal reagents. Its other properties are given in Table 8.\r\nTaken together, they point to the group of albumins as the class of\r\nproteins with which luciferase most closely agrees.\r\n\r\nIf luciferase is not a protein it is so closely bound up with protein\r\nthat it cannot be separated. This is characteristic of many enzymes and\r\nluciferase is also an enzyme. We can determine this by finding out\r\nwhether luciferase will accelerate the oxidation of a large amount of\r\nluciferin, for such is the test of a catalytic substance. If we take 1\r\nc.c. of a dilute solution of luciferase (1 _Cypridina_ to 50 c.c. water)\r\nand add to it successive 1 c.c. portions of concentrated luciferin (1\r\n_Cypridina_ to 2 c.c. solution) as soon as the light from the preceding\r\naddition has disappeared, after four 1 c.c. additions, no more light is\r\nproduced. The luciferase is therefore used up and cannot oxidize more\r\nthan a certain quantity of luciferin. In this experiment, however, we\r\nadded a concentration of luciferin from one _Cypridina_ 100 times that\r\nof the luciferase from one _Cypridina_, i.e., four additions each 25\r\ntimes as concentrated. We have, of course, no way of telling what the\r\nabsolute amount (in milligrams) of luciferin or luciferase is in a\r\nsingle _Cypridina_, but we do know that the luciferase from one\r\n_Cypridina_ cannot oxidize luciferin from more than 100 Cypridinas. If\r\nthe ratio of luciferin to luciferase in a single animal is 100:1, it\r\nwould mean that luciferase could oxidize 10,000 times its weight of\r\nluciferin. A large excess of luciferin but not an indefinite quantity\r\ncan be oxidized by luciferase, and I believe this is sufficient\r\njustification for considering luciferase an enzyme, although it is not\r\nan ideal example of an organic catalyzer. Quite a number of enzymes are\r\nknown to be diminished during the course of the reaction they accelerate\r\nor to be poisoned by their reaction products. Enzyme reactions inhibited\r\nby the formation of reaction products again proceed if these are removed\r\nor diluted. However, light does not again appear in a mixture of weak\r\nluciferase with excess of luciferin upon dilution with water, so that\r\nthe luciferase cannot have been merely inhibited by some reaction\r\nproduct but must have been actually used up during the reaction. It\r\nshould be noted in passing that the peroxidases, ordinarily spoken of as\r\noxidizing enzymes, are used up in the reaction and can only oxidize\r\nlimited amounts of oxidizable substances, a quantity almost in\r\nproportion to the concentration of peroxidase present.\r\n\r\nWhether luciferase is an oxidizing enzyme made up of an albumin\r\nassociated with some heavy metal as iron, copper or manganese is\r\nuncertain. From analyses of whole _Cypridina_, kindly made for me by\r\nProf. A. H. Phillips of Princeton University, all three of these metals,\r\nwhich we know to be associated with biological oxidations, are present,\r\nand it is quite possible that one of them is concerned with the\r\noxidation of luciferin.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have tested a great many oxidizers, organic and inorganic,\r\nand a large number of oxidizing enzymes from blood and tissue extracts\r\nof animals rich in iron, copper and manganese, I have found no material\r\nwhich is capable of taking the place of _Cypridina_ luciferase.\r\nPeroxidases or oxidases of plants, haemoglobin, haemocyanin, extracts of\r\nmussels, manganese containing blood of various marine crustacea and\r\nmollusks will give no light on mixing with luciferin. Such active\r\noxidizers as KMnO_{4}, H_{2}O_{2}, BaO_{2}, and many others, will not\r\noxidize _Cypridina_ luciferin with light production, although they can\r\noxidize _Pholas_ luciferin with light production.\r\n\r\nThe action of _Cypridina_ luciferase is very highly specific. It is\r\nfound only in the luminous organ of _Cypridina hilgendorfii_, not in\r\nnon-luminous parts and not in a non-luminous species of _Cypridina_\r\nclosely related to _hilgendorfii_.\r\n\r\nLuciferins and luciferases from closely allied luminous forms will\r\nmutually interact to produce light, but no light appears if these\r\nsubstances come from distantly related forms. Thus firefly (_Photuris_)\r\nluciferin will give light with _Pyrophorus_ luciferase and _vice versa_,\r\nbut _Cypridina_ luciferin will give no light with firefly (_Luciola_)\r\nluciferase or _vice versa_, nor with _Pholas_ luciferase or _vice\r\nversa_. The faint luminescences sometimes observed on mixing firefly or\r\n_Cypridina_ luciferase with boiled extracts of non-luminous forms, or of\r\ndistantly related luminous forms, are probably caused by photophelein in\r\nthe boiled extract.\r\n\r\nLike the plant peroxidases, _Cypridina_ luciferase is not readily\r\naffected by the action of chloroform, toluol, etc. Unlike the plant\r\nperoxidases, it will not oxidize (_i.e._, produce coloration) in either\r\npresence or absence of H_{2}O_{2}, any of the hydroxyphenol or\r\naminophenol compounds, such as pyrogallol, a-naphthol,\r\npara-diamino-benzine, gum guaiac, etc., commonly used as peroxidase\r\nreagents. Neither will luciferase produce light with any substances,\r\nsuch as oils, lophin, pyrogallol, gallic acid, esculin, etc., which we\r\nknow to be capable of oxidation with light production by other means.\r\nThe luciferases are very highly specific and act only upon the\r\nluciferins of the same or closely related species. They must be placed\r\nby themselves in a new class of oxidizing enzymes.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dubois, _Pholas_ luciferase is rather readily destroyed by\r\nchloroform and my own observations indicate that this is true also of\r\nfirefly luciferase, so that a certain amount of variation exists in the\r\ngroup of luciferases.\r\n\r\nNone of the luminescent animals which I have studied are at all affected\r\nby cyanides. The luminescence continues in extracts of _Cypridina_,\r\nfirefly, and _Cavernularia_, or in _Noctiluca_ and luminous bacteria\r\nafter addition of small or high (_m_/40) concentrations of KCN. In this\r\nrespect the luciferases are very different from many types of oxidizing\r\nenzymes which are inhibited by exceedingly weak concentrations of\r\ncyanide. It should be borne in mind, however, that while KCN inhibits\r\ncatalase and the catalytic decomposition of H_{2}O_{2} by Pt or Ag, it\r\ndoes not affect the catalytic decomposition of H_{2}O_{2} by thallium.\r\n\r\nOXYLUCIFERIN.--When luciferin is oxidized it must be converted into some\r\nsubstance or substances and I believe this change involves no\r\nfundamental destruction of the luciferin molecule as it is a reversible\r\nprocess. I shall speak of the principal (if not the only) product formed\r\nas _oxyluciferin_.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the oxidation of luciferin changes the molecule but\r\nslightly, we at once think of comparing the change luciferin <=>\r\noxyluciferin with the change reduced haemoglobin <=> oxyhaemoglobin. The\r\ncondition is, however, not so simple as this, for oxyhaemoglobin will\r\nagain give up its oxygen providing the partial pressure of oxygen is\r\nmade sufficiently low, whereas oxyluciferin will not do this, at least\r\nin the dark. We can not reduce oxyluciferin solution by exhausting the\r\noxygen with an air-pump.\r\n\r\nThere is another oxidation-reduction system which can also be easily\r\nreversed, but not by merely removing the oxygen from the solution--that\r\nis, the reduction of a dye such as methylene blue to its leuco-base. I\r\nbelieve the change which occurs when luciferin is oxidized is similar to\r\nthat which occurs when the leuco-base of methylene blue or sodium\r\nindigo-sulphonate is oxidized to the blue dye. Oxidation of leuco-dye\r\nbases occurs spontaneously in presence of oxygen and appears to consist\r\nin the removal of hydrogen from the leuco-base with formation of water.\r\nReduction of these dyes may be effected in the same ways that\r\noxyluciferin can be reduced. In the case of methylene blue, reduction\r\nconsists in the addition of two hydrogen atoms. Whether a similar change\r\noccurs when oxyluciferin is reduced or whether oxygen is actually added\r\nas in formation of haemoglobin cannot be definitely stated at present. We\r\nmay write equations representing these possibilities as follows:\r\n\r\n  C_{16}H_{20}N_{3}SCl(leuco-methylene blue) + O <=> C_{16}H_{18}N_{3}SCl\r\n    (methylene blue) + H_{2}O\r\n\r\n  Haemoglobin + O <=> oxyhaemoglobin.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the methods which may be used in reduction of\r\noxyluciferin. We may then endeavor to write an equation which will\r\nrepresent the fundamental changes in the luminescence reaction.\r\n\r\nMy attempts to reduce the oxidation product of luciferin started from\r\nthe observation that if one places a clear solution of luciferase in a\r\ntall test tube, although it may give off no light at first when shaken,\r\nafter standing a day or so a very bright light would appear on shaking.\r\nThis was especially true when the luciferase had become turbid and\r\nill-smelling from the growth of bacteria. Thinking that the bacteria\r\nproduced a substance which could be oxidized by the luciferase, I tried\r\ngrowing bacteria and also yeast on appropriate culture media, and after\r\nsome days of growth mixing the culture media containing the products of\r\nbacterial or yeast growth with luciferase, expecting to obtain light;\r\nbut no light appeared. However, if a little crude luciferase solution\r\nwas added to the bacterial or yeast cultures and then allowed to stand\r\nfor some hours, light appeared whenever they were shaken. Indeed such\r\ncultures behaved much as a suspension of luminous bacteria which has\r\nused up all the oxygen in the culture fluid and will only luminesce\r\nwhen, by shaking, more oxygen dissolves in the culture medium.\r\nRealizing that in bacterial cultures in test tubes, anaerobic\r\nconditions soon appear, and also the strong reducing action of bacteria\r\nupon many substances (for instance, nitrates or methylene blue) under\r\nanaerobic conditions, it struck me that the bacteria might be reducing\r\nthe oxidation product of luciferin to luciferin again. We must remember\r\nthat since crude luciferase solution is a cold-water extract of a\r\nluminous animal allowed to stand until all the luciferin has been\r\noxidized, it must contain oxyluciferin as well as luciferase and will\r\ngive light if the oxyluciferin is again reduced and oxygen admitted.\r\nThis appears to be the correct explanation of the above experiments.\r\n\r\nOxyluciferin may also be readily reduced by the use of the blood of the\r\nhorse-shoe crab (_Limulus_) allowed to stand until bacteria develop.\r\nThis experiment is of special interest because the blood contains\r\nhaemocyanin, which is colorless in the reduced condition and blue in the\r\noxy-condition. The color change thus serves as an indicator of the\r\noxygen concentration in the blood. A sample of foul-smelling _Limulus_\r\nblood full of bacteria will become colorless on standing in a test tube\r\nfor 10 to 15 minutes, but the blue color quickly returns if shaken with\r\nair. Such a blood has the power of reducing oxyluciferin through the\r\nactivity of the bacteria which it contains. Fresh blood has very little\r\nif any reducing action.\r\n\r\nNot only bacteria but also tissue extracts have a strong reducing action\r\nin absence of oxygen. Thus, muscle tissue stained in methylene blue will\r\nvery quickly decolorize (reduce) the methylene blue if oxygen (air) is\r\nkept away, but the blue color immediately returns if air is admitted.\r\nOxyluciferin (_i.e._, a solution of luciferin which has been completely\r\noxidized by boiling or standing in air until it no longer gives light\r\nwith luciferase) if mixed with a suspension of ground frog's muscle and\r\nkept in a well-filled and stoppered test tube for some hours, is reduced\r\nto luciferin and gives a bright light if now poured into luciferase\r\nsolution. Frog muscle suspension alone, or oxyluciferin alone, give no\r\nlight with luciferase, nor will a mixture of frog muscle suspension and\r\noxyluciferin, if shaken with air for several hours. Only if this last\r\nmixture be kept under anaerobic conditions is the oxyluciferin reduced.\r\n\r\nThe reducing action of tissues is said to be due to a reducing enzyme\r\n(_reducase_ or _reductase_), itself composed of a perhydridase and some\r\neasily oxidized body such as an aldehyde. In the presence of the\r\nperhydridase the oxygen of water oxidizes the aldehyde and the hydrogen\r\nset free reduces any easily reducible substance which may be present.\r\nThere is a perhydridase in fresh milk, spoken of as _Schardinger's\r\nenzyme_, which is destroyed by boiling. If some aldehyde is added, fresh\r\nmilk will reduce methylene blue to its leuco-base or nitrates to\r\nnitrites, upon standing a short time. If shaken with air the blue color\r\nreturns. There is no reduction unless an aldehyde is added or unless\r\nsome boiled extract of a tissue such as liver is added. The boiled-liver\r\nextract has no reducing action of its own, but supplies a substance\r\nsimilar to the aldehyde which has been spoken of as _co-enzyme_. The\r\naldehyde is oxidized to its corresponding acid. Milk will reduce\r\nmethylene blue without aldehyde if bacteria are present in large\r\nnumbers. There is no reduction if the milk, methylene blue, and aldehyde\r\nare agitated with air. The temperature optimum is rather high, 60 deg. to\r\n70 deg. C.\r\n\r\nI find that milk is a favorable and convenient medium for the reduction\r\nof oxyluciferin and that it acts without the addition of an aldehyde or\r\nthe presence of bacteria. There is probably a substance acting as the\r\naldehyde in the luciferase-oxyluciferin solution. No light appears if\r\nmilk is added to a luciferase-oxyluciferin solution, but if the mixture\r\nis allowed to stand in absence of oxygen light will appear when air is\r\nadmitted. The air can be conveniently kept out by filling small test\r\ntubes completely with the solution and closing them with rubber\r\nstoppers.\r\n\r\nAs almost all animal tissues contain reductases it is not surprising to\r\nfind that a freshly prepared and filtered extract of _Cypridina_\r\ncontaining oxyluciferin and luciferase, which gives no light on shaking,\r\nwill, on standing in a stoppered tube for 24 hours at room temperature in\r\nthe dark give light when air is admitted. While this may be due to the\r\ndevelopment of bacteria with a reducing action, it does not seem likely,\r\nas under the same conditions methylene blue is not reduced in 24 hours,\r\nand there is no turbidity or smell of decomposition in the tube. In 48\r\nhours bacteria appear and methylene blue is also reduced. If we add\r\nchloroform, toluol or thymol to the tubes of _Cypridina_ extract to\r\nprevent the growth of bacteria, and allow them to stand 48 hours, upon\r\nadmitting air the tube with chloroform gives no light but the tubes with\r\ntoluol and thymol do give light, although it is not so bright as if they\r\nwere absent. I believe that these substances have a destructive action on\r\nthe reductases, most complete in the case of chloroform. Dubois (1919_c_)\r\nalso has recorded the occurrence of a reducing enzyme in _Pholas_, a\r\n\"hydrogenase,\" which is able to form hydrogen from cane sugar, and\r\nluciferin from a boiled extract of _Pholas_. He now regards it as\r\nidentical with his co-luciferase.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to demonstrate that a _Cypridina_ extract will\r\nreduce methylene blue, or nitrates to nitrites, either with or without\r\nthe addition of acetaldehyde. This may be due to the fact that\r\noxyluciferin, which is also present, may be reduced more readily than\r\neither nitrates or methylene blue, and so is reduced first.\r\n\r\nWe can also reduce oxyluciferin by means which do not involve the use of\r\nanimal extracts. Perhaps the best of these is reduction by palladium\r\nblack and sodium hypophosphite. The latter is oxidized in presence of\r\npalladium and nascent hydrogen is set free. The nascent hydrogen reduces\r\nany easily reducible substance which may be present, such as methylene\r\nblue or oxyluciferin. Oxyluciferin is not reduced by palladium alone or\r\nhypophosphite alone, but methylene blue is reduced by palladium black\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIf hydrogen sulphide is passed through a solution of methylene blue the\r\ndye is very quickly reduced and becomes colorless. If the H_{2}S is\r\ndriven off by boiling the colorless methylene-blue solution, the blue\r\ncolor again returns on cooling. Oxyluciferin can also be reduced by\r\nH_{2}S.\r\n\r\nIf one adds some Mg powder to oxyluciferin and then dilute acetic acid\r\nin successive additions as the acetic acid is used up in formation of Mg\r\nacetate, the oxyluciferin will be reduced relatively quickly. Nascent\r\nhydrogen is produced in the reaction and is no doubt the active reducing\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nDilute acid favors the reduction of oxyluciferin. If one saturates an\r\noxyluciferin solution with CO_{2} or adds a little dilute acetic acid,\r\nHCl, HNO_{3} or H_{2}SO_{4}, to it, a certain amount of reduction will\r\noccur. No reduction occurs if the solution is saturated with pure\r\nhydrogen, even if allowed to stand 24 hours. The action of the acid\r\nbegins when the solution of oxyluciferin, ordinarily slightly alkaline\r\n(PH = 9), is made neutral (PH = 7.1) as indicated in Table 9. The action\r\nof the acid must be on the oxyluciferin, as no luciferin or other\r\nenzymes destroyed on boiling are present.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 9\r\n\r\n_Effect of Acid on Reduction of Oxyluciferin_\r\n\r\n  =============================================================================\r\n      Solution                   | P_{H}|Luminescence|    Remarks\r\n                                 |      |   with     |\r\n                                 |      | luciferase |\r\n  -------------------------------+------+------------+-------------------------\r\n  20 c.c.

Fortunately we\r\ncan test this matter by the use of reducing fluids which are not acid.\r\nIf they also form luciferin from oxyluciferin, a reduction must occur.\r\nNascent H can be generated by the action of NaOH on Al, or when finely\r\ndivided Mg or Zn or Al is placed in water. With Mg the water becomes\r\nonly slightly alkaline from formation of almost insoluble Mg(OH)_{2}. If\r\nwe add some Al powder and dilute NaOH to an oxyluciferin solution, H is\r\ngiven off and luciferin is formed. As oxyluciferin cannot be formed by\r\nthe addition of alkali alone we must have in this experiment a reduction\r\nof oxyluciferin in alkaline medium by the nascent H produced. Luciferin\r\ncan also be formed by merely adding Al or Zn or Mg dust to an\r\noxyluciferin solution. Methylene blue can also be readily reduced to its\r\nleuco-base by Zn dust or Al + NaOH.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if one adds some Al or Zn or Mg powder to a solution of\r\nluciferase, light will appear whenever the solution is shaken.\r\nLuciferase solution must always contain the oxidation product of\r\nluciferin, oxyluciferin. In presence of nascent H this is reduced to\r\nluciferin, and since the reaction of the medium is alkaline and\r\nluciferase is present this is oxidized with light production, when, by\r\nshaking, air is dissolved. The light can never become very bright except\r\nat the surface because of the deficiency of oxygen in the solution. It\r\nwould seem, then, that the action of bacteria, yeast, muscle cells,\r\netc., on oxyluciferin must be due not entirely to their acid reaction\r\nbut to their reducing power as well.\r\n\r\nThe above experiment is a very striking and instructive one. Given a\r\ntest tube of luciferase solution containing, as it does, oxyluciferin,\r\nadd some Zn dust or Mg powder, and the evolution of hydrogen begins.\r\nConditions are now favorable for the reduction of oxyluciferin and this\r\noccurs. Shake the contents of the tube to dissolve oxygen and light\r\nappears. Allow the tube to stand and the light soon disappears. Shake\r\nagain and the light reappears. The luminescence reduction and oxidation\r\nprocess can be demonstrated many times.\r\n\r\nA similar experiment can be performed with luciferase and oxyluciferin\r\nsolution by addition of NH_{4}SH. This will serve also as another\r\nexample of the reduction of oxyluciferin in an alkaline medium. Whenever\r\nwe shake a tube of luciferase, oxyluciferin and NH_{4}SH, light will\r\nappear. When the tube is at rest it becomes dark. Even the merest touch\r\nis sufficient to agitate the tube contents, cause solution of oxygen and\r\nappearance of light. It is just as if we stimulate the tube to produce\r\nlight and I believe the phenomenon has a deeper significance and a more\r\nfundamental similarity to the phenomena of stimulation than may at first\r\nappear. What more simple means of controlling a process can we think of\r\nthan by admission or withdrawal of oxygen? The firefly turns on its\r\nlight by stimulation through nerves of the luminous organ. _Noctiluca_\r\nflashes on stimulation of any kind, even the slightest agitation causing\r\na brilliant emission of light. If the stimulation process means merely\r\nthe admission of oxygen to the photogenic cells we have a mechanism in\r\nthe cell itself for automatically producing the light. The admission of\r\noxygen results in aerobic conditions and luciferin in presence of\r\nluciferase can then oxidize to oxyluciferin with luminescence. When the\r\noxygen is used up, the light ceases, anaerobic conditions prevail, and\r\nthe oxyluciferin is reduced to luciferin again. Thus, luciferin is\r\nreformed during the rest period of _Noctiluca_ or between the flashes of\r\nthe firefly. What more efficient type of light than this is to be\r\ndesired?\r\n\r\nAgain, methylene blue offers an interesting parallel to oxyluciferin. A\r\nlittle NH_{4}SH added to methylene blue solution will reduce\r\n(decolorize) it to the leuco-base. If the tube is now shaken the blue\r\ncolor returns. On standing reduction again occurs. The process can be\r\nrepeated a number of times, the reaction going in one or the other\r\ndirection, depending on the oxygen content of the mixture.\r\n\r\nAs methylene blue contains no oxygen, its reduction consists in the\r\naddition of two atoms of hydrogen. When leuco-methylene blue oxidizes,\r\nwater is formed by the union of these two atoms of hydrogen with oxygen,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n  C_{16}H_{20}N_{3}SCl + O <=> C_{16}H_{18}N_{3}SCl + H_{2}O\r\n    (leuco-methylene blue)       (methylene blue)\r\n\r\n  Briefly--MH_{2} + O <=> M + H_{2}O\r\n\r\nTo reduce methylene blue we can add the two hydrogen atoms directly from\r\nnascent hydrogen formed in the solution or we can split up water by a\r\ncatalyzer in the presence of some substance, which will take up the\r\noxygen of water, thus:\r\n\r\n  NaH_{2}PO_{2} + H_{2}O + Pd = NaH_{2}PO_{3} + H_{2} + Pd\r\n   (Sodium hypophosphite)         (Sodium phosphite)\r\n\r\nThis reaction occurs in presence of finely divided palladium. Methylene\r\nblue can be reduced by the H_{2} and the hypophosphite oxidized.\r\n\r\nSince oxyluciferin can be reduced by palladium and sodium hypophosphite\r\n(Harvey, 1918), it is probable that we can write the equation for\r\nreduction of oxyluciferin and oxidation of luciferin in a similar manner\r\nto that of methylene blue:\r\n\r\n  Luciferin + O <=> Oxyluciferin + H_{2}O\r\n\r\n  Briefly--LH_{2} + O <=> L + H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of methylene blue the reaction proceeds in the right\r\nhand direction spontaneously if the pressure of O is sufficiently high.\r\nIf luciferase is also present we have luminescence.\r\n\r\n  LH_{2} + O + luciferase <=> L + H_{2}O + luciferase (luminescence)\r\n\r\nThe reaction proceeds in the left hand direction under low oxygen\r\npressure, in the presence of nascent hydrogen or with some catalyzer\r\nwhich is able to split water, transferring the H_{2} to oxyluciferin and\r\nthe O to an acceptor (A). NaH_{2}PO_{2} plays the part of the acceptor.\r\n\r\n  L + H_{2}O + A + Pd = LH_{2} + AO + Pd.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the way in which the reducing enzymes or\r\nperhydridases (comparable to the Pd) of living tissues act (Bach,\r\n1911-13) and the action of yeast cells, bacteria, muscle suspensions,\r\netc., in reducing oxyluciferin must occur in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the LH_{2} (luciferin) compound is dissociated to even\r\nthe slightest extent into L and hydrogen, the hydrogen ion will shift\r\nthe equilibrium toward the formation of that substance which involves\r\nthe taking up of hydrogen. Consequently we may obtain a partial\r\nformation of luciferin by adding an acid to oxyluciferin. Reduction of\r\nthe H-ion concentration tends to shift the equilibrium in the opposite\r\ndirection. Consequently, addition of alkali favors the oxidation of\r\nluciferin, and it is quite generally true that biological oxidations are\r\nfavored by an alkaline reaction. In addition oxygen in alkaline medium\r\nhas a higher oxidation potential than in neutral or acid media. I\r\nbelieve this is the explanation of the action of acid in formation of\r\nluciferin from oxyluciferin.\r\n\r\nAddition of acid is not the only means of favoring the formation of\r\nluciferin from oxyluciferin. Any reaction which proceeds in one\r\ndirection with evolution of light should, theoretically, proceed in the\r\nopposite direction under the influence of light. So far as I know the\r\ncase of a reaction, photogenic in one direction and photochemical in the\r\nother direction, has never been described, unless we are to accept the\r\ncases of phosphorescence, for instance, the absorption of light by CaS\r\nand its emission in the dark. However, the reaction which occurs during\r\nphosphorescence cannot be stated.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that light will cause the reduction of oxyluciferin. A tube\r\nof oxyluciferin exposed to sunlight for six hours, or the mercury arc\r\nfor two hours, will be partially converted into luciferin. It will\r\nluminesce when luciferase is added, while a control tube kept in\r\ndarkness shows no trace of luciferin. The action is more marked with the\r\nultra-violet as a solution of oxyluciferin in a quartz tube showed more\r\nreduction than one in a glass tube when exposed for the same length of\r\ntime to the quartz mercury arc. The reduction is not dependent on the\r\nformation of acid under the influence of light since two tubes of\r\noxyluciferin, one kept in darkness and the other exposed to sunlight for\r\nsix hours, had the same reaction, PH = 9.3. Of course some reducing\r\nsubstance might be formed under the influence of light but this is not\r\nvery probable.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore write the reaction for luminescence in the following\r\nway:\r\n\r\n                             darkness\r\n                             alkali\r\n                             luciferase\r\n  luciferin (LH_{2}) + O <=> oxyluciferin (L) + H_{2}O (luminescence)\r\n                             perhydridase\r\n                             acid\r\n                             light\r\n\r\nAcid and light favor reduction while alkali and darkness favor oxidation\r\nin the luciferin <=> oxyluciferin reaction. Whether the luciferin be really\r\noxidized by removal of H_{2} or whether by addition of oxygen is, of\r\ncourse, uncertain, but the analogy with methylene blue is striking and\r\nmay serve as a working hypothesis until the composition of luciferin and\r\nits oxidation product are known.\r\n\r\nWhile I have not studied the properties of oxyluciferin as fully as\r\nthose of luciferin, so far as I can judge, both substances give the same\r\ngeneral reactions and possess identical properties. Both crude luciferin\r\nand crude oxyluciferin solution are yellow in color, but I do not\r\nbelieve that either pure luciferin or oxyluciferin are yellow in color,\r\nbecause an ether or benzine extract of _Cypridina_ is also yellow,\r\nalthough luciferase, luciferin, and oxyluciferin are insoluble in ether\r\nand benzine. The yellow pigment which can be observed to make up part of\r\nthe luminous gland of _Cypridina_ is not luciferin or luciferase. It may\r\nbe a pigment related to _urochrome_.\r\n\r\nWhen tests are applied and precipitating reagents are added to crude\r\nluciferin and crude oxyluciferin solution, they give identical results\r\nin each case. A more complete account of the chemistry of luciferin has\r\nbeen given in this chapter, and there is no need of duplicating these\r\nstatements regarding oxyluciferin. Like luciferin, the oxyluciferin will\r\npass porcelain filters, dialyze through parchment or collodion\r\nmembranes, and is undigested by salivary diastase, pepsin HCl, Merck's\r\npancreatin in neutral solution, and erepsin. The salivary diastase and\r\nthe pancreatin (containing amylopsin, trypsin, and lipase) were allowed\r\nto digest for four days at 38 deg. C. without showing any evidence of\r\ndigestive action.\r\n\r\nAs luciferin is so easily oxidizable a substance, we should expect to\r\nfind that it will reduce just as glucose will reduce. However, a\r\nconcentrated solution of luciferin has no reducing action on Fehling's\r\n(alkaline Cu), Barfoed's (acid Cu), Nylander's (alkaline Bi) or Knapp's\r\n(alkaline Hg) reagent. Glucose will reduce methylene blue in alkaline\r\n(not in neutral solution), but luciferin will not reduce methylene blue\r\nin alkaline or neutral solution. It would seem, then, that luciferin\r\nmust contain no aldehyde group. If so, we should expect to obtain\r\nreduction of some of the above reagents. Just what group is concerned in\r\nthe oxidation is unknown at the present time, and in the absence of more\r\nexperimental data, speculation regarding it can be of little value.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn summing up we may say that the luminescence of at least three groups\r\nof luminous animals, the beetles, _Pholas_, and _Cypridina_, has been\r\ndefinitely shown to be due to the interaction of two substances,\r\nluciferin and luciferase, in presence of water and oxygen. Luciferin and\r\nluciferase have quite different properties and may be easily separated\r\nfrom each other by various chemical procedures. As the luciferins and\r\nluciferases from different luminous animals have somewhat different\r\nproperties, they may be designated by prefixing the generic name of the\r\nanimal from which they are obtained.\r\n\r\n_Cypridina_ luciferin differs from _Pholas_ luciferin in that it can not\r\nbe oxidized with light production by KMnO_{4}, H_{2}O_{2}, with or\r\nwithout haemoglobin, or similar oxidizing agents. _Cypridina_ luciferase\r\ndiffers from _Pholas_ and firefly luciferase in that it is not readily\r\ndestroyed by the fat-solvent anaesthetics, such as chloroform, ether,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWhen _Cypridina_ luciferin is oxidized, no fundamental splitting of the\r\nmolecule occurs, because the product, oxyluciferin, can be readily\r\nreduced to luciferin again. This reduction is brought about under\r\nconditions similar to those necessary for the reduction of dyes, such as\r\nmethylene blue. Oxyluciferin can be reduced to luciferin, which will\r\nagain give light with luciferase, by the reductases of muscle tissue,\r\nliver, etc., or by bacteria; by Schardinger's enzyme of milk; by H_{2}S;\r\nby the nascent hydrogen from the action of acetic acid on magnesium or\r\nof water or NaOH on aluminium, zinc or magnesium; and by palladium black\r\nand sodium hypophosphite, all well-known reducing methods. Reduction of\r\noxyluciferin no doubt occurs even in presence of luciferase if oxygen is\r\nabsent, and reduction of oxyluciferin no doubt occurs in animals which\r\nburn luciferin within the cell, thus tending for conservation of\r\nmaterial. Dilute alkali favors oxidation and dilute acid favors the\r\nreduction. Light favors the reduction of oxyluciferin.\r\n\r\nApparently luciferin and oxyluciferin have identical chemical\r\nproperties. Neither is digested by the enzymes: malt diastase, ptyalin,\r\nyeast invertase, pepsin, trypsin, steapsin, amylopsin, rennin, erepsin,\r\nurease or enzymes occurring in the water extracts of dried spleen,\r\nkidney, or liver. Luciferase is destroyed only by pepsin (probably),\r\ntrypsin, erepsin, and something in spleen and liver extract.\r\n\r\nLuciferase is unquestionably a protein and all its properties agree with\r\nthose of the albumins. Although used up in oxidizing large quantities of\r\nluciferin, it behaves in many ways like an enzyme and may be so\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\nLuciferin, on the other hand, is not digested by proteolytic enzymes, is\r\ndialyzable, almost but not completely precipitated by saturation with\r\n(NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}, and is soluble in absolute alcohol, acetone, and\r\nsome other organic solvents, but not in the strictly fat-solvents like\r\nether, chloroform, and benzol. There are, however, certain CO-NH\r\nlinkages which are not attacked by proteolytic enzymes and some peptones\r\nsoluble in absolute alcohol, so that these two characteristics do not\r\nbar it from the group of proteins. Luciferin, in fact, has many\r\nproperties in common with the proteoses and peptones but its chemical\r\nnature cannot be definitely stated at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDYNAMICS OF LUMINESCENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary things regarding luminescence in general\r\nis the small amount of material necessary to cause a visible emission of\r\nlight. To take an extreme case, the flash of light resulting from the\r\nimpact on ZnS of a single [alpha] particle, a helium atom, is visible to\r\nthe naked eye. Addition of one part in a million of some heavy metal to\r\npure CaS will confer phosphorescent properties on the latter. We are\r\nforced to believe that the heavy metal enters into some reaction during\r\nillumination which is reversed with light emission after illumination\r\nand a very small amount of heavy metal is necessary. Pyrogallol in\r\nwater, 1:5,000,000 (m/512,000), can be oxidized with light production by\r\nK_{4}Fe(CN)_{6} and H_{2}O_{2} (Harvey, 1917) and m/100 pyrogallol +\r\nH_{2}O_{2} will give a visible light with colloidal platinum in\r\n1:250,000 concentration (Goss, 1917).\r\n\r\nLuciferin and luciferase from _Cypridina_ will also luminesce in\r\nexceedingly small concentration. If one grinds a single _Cypridina_ in a\r\nmortar with water and dilutes the extract to 25,600 c.c., light can be\r\nobserved if luciferin is added to this dilute luciferase solution. By\r\ndetermining the volume of the luminous gland of _Cypridina_ and even\r\nassuming that this volume is all luciferase, one can calculate that one\r\npart of luciferase in 1,700,000,000 parts of water will give light when\r\nluciferin is added. Likewise, a similar dilution of luciferin will give\r\nvisible light when luciferase is added.\r\n\r\nThe sensitivity of our eye is largely responsible for the detection of\r\nso small an energy change. As we have seen, recent determinations have\r\nproved that the dark adapted eye can detect 18 x 10^{-10} ergs per\r\nsecond. From the heat of complete oxidation of pyrogallol it is possible\r\nto calculate the amount of pyrogallol necessary to give 18 x 10^{-10}\r\nergs if completely oxidized. This quantity is infinitesimally small.\r\nWhen pyrogallol is oxidized by K_{4}Fe(CN)_{6} and H_{2}O_{2}, it is not\r\ncompletely oxidized and probably only a small amount of the energy is\r\nconverted into light; otherwise we should be able to see the\r\nluminescence of a very much weaker concentration of pyrogallol. As the\r\nreaction luciferin <=> oxyluciferin is so easily reversible, very little\r\nenergy must be liberated, and, as experiments indicate, very little\r\nheat, if any, accompanies light production. Even though this be true, it\r\nis still possible for a very small amount of luciferin to produce a very\r\nlarge amount of light.\r\n\r\nA very small amount of luciferase only is necessary because it behaves\r\nas an enzyme and follows the general rule that catalysts act in minute\r\nconcentrations.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that luciferase is an enzyme, an organic catalyst\r\noxidizing luciferin with light production, we may appropriately inquire\r\ninto the relation between the concentration of luciferin and luciferase\r\nand intensity and duration of luminescence. Oxygen tension, hydrogen ion\r\nconcentration and temperature must be maintained constant as these all\r\naffect both intensity and duration of luminescence. Before considering\r\nluciferin and luciferase, however, let us study a few well-known\r\nchemiluminescent oxidations with special reference to concentration of\r\nreacting substances and temperature.\r\n\r\nThe effect of temperature on luminescence is of special interest because\r\nit gives us a means of analysis for determining if the luminescence\r\ndepends on reaction velocity. We know that photochemical reactions are\r\nvery little affected by temperature because the reaction is dependent on\r\nthe absorption of light, a physical process, and this increases only a\r\nsmall per cent. for a rise of temperature of 10 deg. C. To put it in the\r\nusual way, its temperature coefficient (Q_{10}) for a 10 deg. interval is\r\nusually less than 1.1. On the other hand, we should expect photogenic\r\nreactions, in which some of the chemical energy is converted into\r\nradiant energy, to give off much more light the greater the reaction\r\nvelocity. As reaction velocity increases so rapidly with temperature\r\n(Q_{10} = 2 to 3), luminescence intensity should rapidly increase with\r\nincrease in temperature.\r\n\r\nTrautz (1905), from his extensive study of the chemiluminescence of\r\nphenol and aldehyde compounds came to the conclusion that luminescence\r\nintensity was proportional to reaction velocity. He based his\r\nconclusions largely on the effects of temperature and concentration of\r\nreacting substances and went so far as to declare that any reaction\r\nwould produce luminescence if the reaction velocity were sufficiently\r\nincreased. It is quite true that increasing the temperature does\r\nincrease the intensity of chemiluminescence, but this is only within\r\ncertain limits. As we raise the temperature, chemiluminescence becomes\r\nmore intense but we soon reach a temperature for maximum luminescence\r\nand above this the intensity diminishes. This is especially well seen in\r\nthe action of various oxidizers on pyrogallol and H_{2}O_{2} recorded in\r\nTable 10. At 100 deg. C. practically no light is produced by many\r\noxidizers which are themselves unaffected at 100 deg.. If we are to connect\r\nreaction velocity with intensity of luminescence we must conclude that\r\nthe evolution of light is dependent rather on an optimum than a maximum\r\nreaction velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 10\r\n\r\n_Temperature and Light Production.

This fact does not confirm the theory that reaction\r\nvelocity is a determining factor in luminescence. The conditions for the\r\nluminescence of white phosphorus are most interesting and unusual. (See\r\nvan't Hoff, 1895; Ewan, 1895; Centnerszwer, 1895; Russell,1903; Scharff,\r\n1908.) Phosphorus will only begin to luminesce at a certain small\r\npressure of oxygen. This \"minimum luminescence pressure\" of oxygen is\r\nvery low, so low that earlier observers, failing to remove traces of\r\noxygen, thought that luminescence might occur in absence of oxygen.\r\nCuriously enough there is also a \"maximum luminescence pressure\" of\r\noxygen above which no luminescence occurs. Phosphorus will not luminesce\r\nin pure oxygen. Between the minimum and maximum is an \"optimum\r\nluminescence pressure\" where luminescence of the phosphorus is\r\nbrightest. The exact values of these pressures vary with degree of water\r\nvapor present and with temperature. According to Abegg's _Handbuch der\r\nanorganischen Chemie_, the maximum luminescence pressure with water\r\nvapor present, is 320 mm. Hg at 0 deg. and increases 13.19 mm. Hg for each\r\ndegree rise in temperature. This means that for a definite temperature,\r\nsay, 20 deg., phosphorus will not luminesce with an oxygen pressure of 583\r\nmm. Hg, but will luminesce with pressures under this. If, however, we\r\nraise the temperature, luminescence will occur with an oxygen pressure\r\nof 583 mm. Hg.\r\n\r\nA somewhat analogous case is presented by the oxidation of pyrogallol\r\nsolution in contact with ozone, except that in this reaction too high a\r\nconcentration of pyrogallol will hinder the oxidation. I have not\r\nstudied the effect of varying concentrations of ozone. If oxygen, passed\r\nthrough an ozonizer (the silent electric discharge tube), is bubbled\r\nthrough m/100 pyrogallol, no luminescence occurs at 0 deg., a fair\r\nluminescence at 20 deg., a good luminescence at 50 deg., and a bright\r\nluminescence at the boiling point. If the pyrogallol is of _m_\r\nconcentration, no luminescence occurs at 0 deg. or 20 deg., a fair luminescence\r\nat 50 deg., and a bright luminescence at the boiling point. For a definite\r\ntemperature, say 20 deg., no light appears if the pyrogallol is of _m_\r\nconcentration, but if we raise the temperature, luminescence can occur.\r\nThe similarity to phosphorus is obvious. Thus the \"maximum luminescence\r\npressure\" of pyrogallol increases with increase of temperature.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that pyrogallol can also be oxidized, if H_{2}O_{2}\r\nis present, by a great variety of substances, such as peroxidases of\r\npotato or turnip juice, haemoglobin, KMnO_{4}, K_{4}Fe(CN)_{6}, CrO_{3},\r\nMnO_{2}, hypochlorites and hypobromites, or colloidal Pt and Ag. For\r\nconvenience we may collectively speak of these as oxidizers. They are\r\nrecorded in Table 13. No light occurs if H_{2}O_{2}is absent. In the\r\ncase of some of these oxidizers pyrogallol will luminesce in dilute\r\nconcentrations but not in strong. Also, dilute pyrogallol will luminesce\r\nwith a dilute solution of oxidizer but not with a concentrated solution\r\nof oxidizer. The effect of rise in temperature in these cases also is to\r\nincrease the \"maximum luminescence concentration\" of pyrogallol and the\r\n\"maximum luminescence concentration\" of oxidizer. Table 11 shows this\r\neffect of temperature with K_{4}Fe(CN)_{6} and varying concentrations of\r\npyrogallol, and Table 12 shows the effect of temperature with pyrogallol\r\nand varying concentrations of K_{4}Fe(CN)_{6}. Table 10 shows the\r\nrelation between temperature and intensity of luminescence with\r\npyrogallol and various oxidizers. The terms _faint_, _fair_, _good_, and\r\n_bright_ are purely relative designations of brightness as estimated by\r\nthe eye, for accurate measurements of weak intensities are very\r\ndifficult to make.\r\n\r\nFrom Table 10 it should be noted that the intensity of luminescence of\r\npyrogallol oxidized with most oxidizers is actually less at the boiling\r\npoint, a fact which I have repeatedly verified. Let us now see how these\r\nfacts are to be explained. If we assume that luminescence is dependent\r\non reaction velocity, the intensity of luminescence should increase with\r\nincreasing temperature. Up to a certain limit this is what we find, but\r\nat temperatures above this limit the intensity of luminescence actually\r\ndecreases. The duration of luminescence also decreases. There is an\r\noptimum temperature for luminescence in many cases and we can only\r\nconclude that luminescence depends not on a very rapid reaction velocity\r\nbut on a certain definite reaction velocity. Assuming that this is true,\r\nhow can we account for the anomalous fact that in high concentrations of\r\noxygen, phosphorus will not luminesce or that in high concentrations of\r\npyrogallol, there is no luminescence in presence of ozone or of oxidizer\r\nand H_{2}O_{2}. Of course with high active mass of oxygen (in case of\r\nphosphorous luminescence) or of pyrogallol (in case of pyrogallol\r\nluminescence) the reaction velocity must be greater than the\r\noptimum. If that is the case, then lowering the temperature should\r\nreduce the reaction velocity to the optimum and light should appear.\r\nHowever, as we have seen, not lowering but raising the temperature\r\ncauses luminescence with high oxygen concentration or high pyrogallol\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 11\r\n\r\n_Temperature, Concentration of Pyrogallol, and Light Production.

While intensity of luminescence undoubtedly increases\r\nwith increasing reaction velocity, the luminescence itself probably\r\naccompanies only one stage in the formation of a series of oxidation\r\nproducts. This stage is favored at a definite temperature and mass of\r\nreacting substances. Thus, in the oxidation of phosphorus several\r\nintermediate oxides are said to be formed. The oxidation takes place in\r\nsteps and probably the luminescence is connected with only one of the\r\nsteps in a chain of reactions. It is probable that a certain oxygen\r\npressure and temperature favors that particular step at the expense of\r\nthe others and so this oxygen concentration and temperature correspond\r\nto the optimum for luminescence.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that certain definite oxidation products of pyrogallol\r\nmust be formed in order to produce light is borne out by the fact that\r\npyrogallol must be oxidized in a particular way to obtain luminescence.\r\nThe blackening of pyrogallol with absorption of oxygen in presence of\r\nalkali is a very well-known reaction, but luminescence does not\r\naccompany this type of oxidation. I have tried mixing all concentrations\r\nof pyrogallol and all concentrations of alkali in an endeavor to obtain\r\nsome light, but always with negative results. Likewise my attempts to\r\nobtain light during the electrolysis of salt solutions containing\r\npyrogallol by means of the nascent oxygen at various kinds of anodes\r\nhave met with negative results. A similar case is presented by luciferin\r\nwhich oxidizes spontaneously (most rapidly in presence of alkali)\r\nwithout light production and only produces light when oxidized in\r\npresence of luciferase.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the results of the dynamics of chemiluminescence we may say\r\nthat certain oxyluminescences occur only if the substance is oxidized in\r\na particular way under definite conditions of temperature and\r\nconcentration and that this is probably due to a favoring of one step\r\n(with which the luminescence is associated) in a chain of oxidations.\r\nProviding temperature and concentration are such as to favor the step\r\nresponsible for luminescence, then higher temperature and greater\r\nconcentration result in increased intensity of luminescence.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to luminous organisms and consider the effect of\r\ntemperature and of concentration of reacting substances (oxygen,\r\nluciferin and luciferase) on the luminescence. We have already seen that\r\nluminescence of a luciferin-luciferase mixture begins with an\r\nextraordinarily low oxygen tension and increases in intensity with\r\nincreasing tension of oxygen, but that very soon an oxygen tension is\r\nreached where a maximum luminescence is obtained and further increase of\r\noxygen tension gives no brighter light. In this respect the luminescence\r\nintensity--oxygen tension curve is no doubt very similar to the\r\nhaemoglobin saturation--oxygen tension curve. Haemoglobin is about 50 per\r\ncent. saturated at 10 mm. oxygen pressure, 80 per cent. saturated at 20\r\nmm. oxygen pressure and completely saturated at pressures of oxygen\r\nwell below the pressure of oxygen in air (152 mm. Hg). As the optimum\r\noxygen tension for luminescence of luciferin is also well below that of\r\nair, mixtures of luciferin and luciferase luminesce with equal\r\nbrilliancy whether air or pure oxygen is bubbled through them. To obtain\r\nan excess of oxygen it is only necessary to keep the solution saturated\r\nwith air and statements regarding concentration of luciferin and\r\nluciferase and intensity or duration refer to excess of oxygen.\r\nInvestigators who have studied the effect of increase in oxygen pressure\r\non luminous animals have come to the same conclusions. High pressures of\r\nair or oxygen do not increase the intensity of luminescence (Dubois and\r\nRegnard, 1884).\r\n\r\nThe hydrogen ion concentration of crude solutions of luciferin and\r\nluciferase, made by extracting whole Cypridinas with hot or cold water\r\nis fairly constant, about PH = 9, determined electrometrically. Such\r\nsolutions have a high buffer value and the PH does not change during\r\noxidation of luciferin so that this variable is automatically\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\nBecause of difficulties in measuring low intensities of light which are\r\nconstantly changing, no figures on light intensities can be given, but\r\nit is easy to establish the following facts: The greater the\r\nconcentration of luciferin or luciferase the more intense the\r\nluminescence. The greater the concentration of luciferin the longer the\r\nduration of luminescence and the greater the concentration of\r\nluciferase, the shorter the luminescence lasts. Thus, if we mix\r\nconcentrated luciferin and weak luciferase we get a bright light which\r\nlasts for a half hour or more, gradually growing more dim. Concentrated\r\nluciferase and weak luciferin give a bright flash of light which\r\ndisappears almost instantly. Concentrated luciferase and concentrated\r\nluciferin give a brilliant light which lasts for an intermediate length\r\nof time and weak luciferin and weak luciferase give a faint luminescence\r\nwhich lasts for an intermediate length of time.\r\n\r\nThese facts can all be explained by regarding luciferase as a catalyzer\r\nwhich accelerates the oxidation of luciferin and by assuming that\r\nintensity of luminescence is dependent on reaction velocity, _i.e._, on\r\nrate of oxidation. Contrary to the condition for phosphorus and for\r\npyrogallol there appears to be no optimum concentration of luciferase or\r\nluciferin, but the luminescence intensity increases gradually with\r\nincreasing concentration of luminous substances up to the point where\r\npure (?) luciferin and pure (?) luciferase, as secreted from the gland\r\ncells of the animal, come in contact with each other. This, the maximum\r\nbrightness, is not to be compared with the light of an incandescent\r\nsolid, but is nevertheless visible in a well-lighted room, out of direct\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nThe effect of temperature on _Cypridina_ luminescence also bears out the\r\npreceding conclusions. For a given mixture of luciferin and luciferase\r\nthe light becomes more intense with increasing temperature up to a\r\ndefinite optimum and then diminishes in intensity. The diminution in\r\nintensity above the optimum is due to a reversible change in the\r\nluciferase so that its active mass diminishes. This change becomes\r\nirreversible in the neighborhood of 70 deg. (depending on various\r\nconditions), where coagulation of luciferase occurs. Light will appear\r\nat 0 deg. but it is far less intense than light at higher temperatures and\r\nit is more yellow in color. The light of optimum temperatures is quite\r\nblue. The weaker light at temperatures above the optimum is also more\r\nyellow in color. I believe this difference in color is a function of the\r\nslowed reaction velocity, for a mixture of luciferin and luciferase\r\nwhich gives a bluish luminescence at room temperature, will give a\r\nweaker and yellowish luminescence if diluted with water. Dilution with\r\nwater will slow the reaction velocity. If the difference in color were\r\nnot real but due to change in color sensitivity of the eye with\r\ndifferent intensities of such relatively weak light (Purkinje\r\nphenomenon), the weaker light should appear more blue. As the weaker\r\nlight appears more yellow, I therefore believe the color difference is\r\nactual and not subjective.\r\n\r\nA minimum, optimum, and maximum temperature for luminescence is observed\r\nin all luminous organisms. The minimum is usually very low. Luminous\r\nbacteria will still light at -11.5 deg. C. The power to luminesce under\r\nordinary conditions is not destroyed by exposure to liquid air, for, on\r\nraising the temperature, light again appears (Macfayden, 1900, 1902).\r\nAlmost all organisms will luminesce at 0 deg. C., and the luminescence\r\nminimum probably represents the point at which complete freezing of the\r\nluminous solution occurs. It is very low with bacteria because they are\r\nsolutions in capillary spaces of very small size, a condition tending to\r\nlower the freezing point.\r\n\r\nThe luminescence maximum represents the point at which luciferase is\r\nreversibly changed so as to be no longer active. If the temperature is\r\nagain lowered the luciferase again becomes active and light reappears.\r\nSome degrees above this, and in all forms well below the boiling point,\r\nluciferase is coagulated and destroyed. As the coagulation point of\r\nproteins depends on many factors, such as time of heating, salt\r\ncontent, acidity, etc., so the luciferases of different animals\r\ncoagulate at different temperatures depending on these conditions. Some\r\nof the more reliable observations on these critical temperatures are\r\ncollected in Table 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 14\r\n\r\n_Temperature Limits of Luminescence for Luminous Organism_\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+---------------------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n          Organism         |   Author and date   |Minimum|Optimum|Maximum|\r\n  -------------------------+---------------------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  Pseudomonas javanica     | Eijkman, 1892       | -20 deg.  | 25-33 deg.|  45 deg.  |\r\n                           |                     |       |       |       |\r\n  Bacterium phosphorescens | Lehmann, 1889       | -12 deg.  |  ...  | 39.5 deg. |\r\n                           |                     |       |       |       |\r\n  Bacterium phosphoreum    | Molish, 1904, book  |  -5 deg.  | 16-18 deg.|  28 deg.  |\r\n                           |                     |       |       |       |\r\n  Light bacteria           | Tarchanoff, 1902    |  -7 deg.  | 15-25 deg.|  37 deg.  |\r\n                           |                     |       |       |       |\r\n  Light bacteria           | Harvey, E.

I believe, however, that\r\nin _Cypridina_ also, the luminescence intensity depends not only on\r\nreaction velocity but on the particular manner in which luciferin is\r\noxidized. _Cypridina_ luciferin will luminesce only in presence of\r\n_Cypridina_ luciferase and no light can be obtained from _Cypridina_\r\nluciferin and a host of different oxidizers (with or without H_{2}O_{2})\r\nsuch as are able to oxidize pyrogallol. Luciferin will also oxidize in\r\nthe air spontaneously but no light is produced. It is easy to show that\r\nthis spontaneous oxidation may be much more rapid than an oxidation with\r\nluciferase and yet light appears only in presence of the latter. If a\r\nconcentrated solution of luciferin is kept near the boiling point it\r\nwill be completely oxidized to oxyluciferin in four or five minutes. No\r\nlight appears if air or even if pure oxygen is bubbled through it. The\r\nsame solution kept at 20 deg. with a small amount of luciferase will\r\nluminesce continuously and not be completely oxidized to oxyluciferin in\r\na half hour. We can, however, cause the luciferin to oxidize as rapidly\r\nat 20 deg. by adding concentrated luciferase as does the luciferin near the\r\nboiling point without luciferase. A bright light is produced in the\r\nformer case, none in the latter case. The oxyluciferin formed from\r\nspontaneous oxidation of luciferin appears to be the same as that formed\r\nwith luciferase present. Both give luciferin again on reduction. Perhaps\r\nthe reaction takes place in two stages, similar to those supposed to\r\noccur in other enzyme actions:\r\n\r\n  luciferin + luciferase = luciferinluciferase\r\n  luciferinluciferase + O (or minus H_{2}) = oxyluciferin\r\n    + luciferase.\r\n\r\nWe may then assume as a tentative hypothesis that luminescence only\r\noccurs during oxidation (addition of O or removal of H) of the\r\nluciferinluciferase compound.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that the effect of cooling a _Cypridina_ extract\r\ncontaining luciferin and luciferase and luminescing with a bluish light,\r\nis to reduce the intensity and change the shade toward the yellow.\r\nVelocity of oxidation must be lowered and with the same concentration of\r\nluciferase lowered velocity means more light of the longer wave-lengths.\r\nA very instructive experiment on color of the light can be carried out\r\nwith animals having different colored lights and so closely related that\r\ntheir luciferins and luciferases will interact with each other. Such a\r\ncase is presented by the American fireflies, _Photinus_ and _Photuris_.\r\n_Photinus_ emits an orange light, while _Photuris_ emits a greenish\r\nyellow light. The difference in color is especially noticeable when the\r\nluminous organs of the two forms are ground up in separate mortars. As\r\nshown by Coblentz, the difference in color is real, the spectrum of\r\n_Photinus_ extending farther into the red than that of _Photuris_ (see\r\nFig. 8). We can easily prepare luciferin and luciferase from the two\r\nfireflies and make the following mixtures:\r\n\r\n_Photinus_ luciferin x _Photinus_ luciferase = reddish light.\r\n\r\n_Photinus_ luciferin x _Photuris_ luciferase = yellowish light.\r\n\r\n_Photuris_ luciferin x _Photuris_ luciferase = yellowish light.\r\n\r\n_Photuris_ luciferin x _Photinus_ luciferase = reddish light.\r\n\r\nThus the color of the light in these \"crosses\" is that characteristic of\r\nthe animal supplying the luciferase. To bring this fact in line with\r\nwhat we have already said regarding reaction velocity and luminescence,\r\nwe must believe that the _Photinus_ luciferase oxidizes at a slower rate\r\nthan the _Photuris_ luciferase. In this connection it is of interest to\r\nrecall that the _Photuris_ light as emitted by the insect becomes\r\nreddish at high temperatures, or if the insect is plunged into alcohol,\r\nboth conditions which bring about partial coagulation of the luciferase\r\nand reduce its active mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nA few of the enormous number of papers on luminescence are included in\r\nthe list below.
