VON HALLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n‘STARS and Atoms’ was the title of an Evening Discourse given at\r\nthe meeting of the British Association in Oxford in August 1926. In\r\nadapting it for publication the restrictions of a time limit are\r\nremoved, and accordingly it appears in this book as three lectures.\r\nEarlier in the year I had given a course of three lectures in King’s\r\nCollege, London, on the same topics; these have been combined with the\r\nOxford lecture and are the origin of most of the additions.\r\n\r\nA full account of the subject, including the mathematical theory, is\r\ngiven in my larger book, _The Internal Constitution of the Stars_\r\n(Camb. Univ. Press, 1926). Here I only aim at exposition of some of the\r\nleading ideas and results.\r\n\r\nThe advance in our knowledge of atoms and radiation has led to many\r\ninteresting developments in astronomy; and reciprocally the study of\r\nmatter in the extreme conditions prevailing in stars and nebulae has\r\nplayed no mean part in the progress of atomic physics. This is the\r\ngeneral theme of the lectures. Selection has been made of the advances\r\nand discoveries which admit of comparatively elementary exposition;\r\nbut it is often necessary to demand from the reader a concentration\r\nof thought which, it is hoped, will be repaid by the fascination of\r\nthe subject. The treatment was meant to be discursive rather than\r\nsystematic; but habits of mind refuse to be suppressed entirely and\r\na certain amount of system has crept in. In these problems where our\r\nthought fluctuates continually from the excessively great to the\r\nexcessively small, from the star to the atom and back to the star, the\r\nstory of progress is rich in variety; if it has not lost too much in\r\nthe telling, it should convey in full measure the delights--and the\r\ntroubles--of scientific investigation in all its phases.\r\n\r\nTemperatures are expressed throughout in degrees Centigrade. The\r\nEnglish billion, trillion, &c. (10^{12}, 10^{18}, &c.) are used.\r\n\r\n                                                               A. S. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nLECTURE I.

The\r\nstars are globes comparable in size with the sun, that is to say,\r\nof the order of a million miles in diameter. The space for their\r\naccommodation is on the most lavish scale. Imagine thirty cricket balls\r\nroaming the whole interior of the earth; the stars roaming the heavens\r\nare just as little crowded and run as little risk of collision as the\r\ncricket balls. We marvel at the grandeur of the stellar system. But\r\nthis probably is not the limit. Evidence is growing that the spiral\r\nnebulae are ‘island universes’ outside our own stellar system. It may\r\nwell be that our survey covers only one unit of a vaster organization.\r\n\r\nA drop of water contains several thousand million million million\r\natoms. Each atom is about one hundred-millionth of an inch in diameter.\r\nHere we marvel at the minute delicacy of the workmanship. But this is\r\nnot the limit. Within the atom are the much smaller electrons pursuing\r\norbits, like planets round the sun, in a space which relatively to\r\ntheir size is no less roomy than the solar system.\r\n\r\nNearly midway in scale between the atom and the star there is another\r\nstructure no less marvellous--the human body. Man is slightly nearer to\r\nthe atom than to the star. About 10^{27} atoms build his body; about\r\n10^{28} human bodies constitute enough material to build a star.\r\n\r\nFrom his central position man can survey the grandest works of Nature\r\nwith the astronomer, or the minutest works with the physicist. To-night\r\nI ask you to look both ways. For the road to a knowledge of the stars\r\nleads through the atom; and important knowledge of the atom has been\r\nreached through the stars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe star most familiar to us is the sun. Astronomically speaking, it is\r\nclose at hand. We can measure its size, weigh it, take its temperature,\r\nand so on, more easily than the other stars. We can take photographs of\r\nits surface, whereas the other stars are so distant that the largest\r\ntelescope in the world does not magnify them into anything more than\r\npoints of light. Figs. 1 and 2[1] show recent pictures of the sun’s\r\nsurface. No doubt the stars in general would show similar features if\r\nthey were near enough to be examined.\r\n\r\nI must first explain that these are not the ordinary photographs.\r\nSimple photographs show very well the dark blotches called sunspots,\r\nbut otherwise they are rather flat and uninteresting. The pictures\r\nhere shown were taken with a spectroheliograph, an instrument which\r\nlooks out for light of just one variety (wave-length) and ignores all\r\nthe rest. The ultimate effect of this selection is that the instrument\r\nsorts out the different levels in the sun’s atmosphere and shows what\r\nis going on at one level, instead of giving a single blurred impression\r\nof all levels superposed. Fig. 2, which refers to a high level, gives a\r\nwonderful picture of whirlwinds and commotion. I think that the solar\r\nmeteorologists would be likely to describe these vortices in terms not\r\nunfamiliar to us--‘A deep depression with secondaries is approaching,\r\nand a renewal of unsettled conditions is probable.’ However that may\r\nbe, there is always one safe weather forecast on the sun; cyclone or\r\nanticyclone, the temperature will be _very warm_--about 6,000° in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. THE SUN. Hydrogen photograph]\r\n\r\nBut just now I do not wish to linger over the surface layers or\r\natmosphere of the sun. A great many new and interesting discoveries\r\nhave recently been made in this region, and much of the new knowledge\r\nis very germane to my subject of ‘Stars and Atoms’. But personally I am\r\nmore at home underneath the surface, and I am in a hurry to dive below.\r\nTherefore with this brief glance at the scenery that we pass we shall\r\nplunge into the deep interior--where the eye cannot penetrate, but\r\nwhere it is yet possible by scientific reasoning to learn a great deal\r\nabout the conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Temperature in the Interior_\r\n\r\n\r\nBy mathematical methods it is possible to work out how fast the\r\npressure increases as we go down into the sun, and how fast the\r\ntemperature must increase to withstand the pressure. The architect can\r\nwork out the stresses inside the piers of his building; he does not\r\nneed to bore holes in them. Likewise the astronomer can work out the\r\nstress or pressure at points inside the sun without boring a hole.\r\nPerhaps it is more surprising that the temperature can be found by pure\r\ncalculation. It is natural that you should feel rather sceptical about\r\nour claim that we know how hot it is in the very middle of a star--and\r\nyou may be still more sceptical when I divulge the actual figures!\r\nTherefore I had better describe the method as far as I can. I shall not\r\nattempt to go into detail, but I hope to show you that there is a clue\r\nwhich might be followed up by appropriate mathematical methods.\r\n\r\nI must premise that the heat of a gas is chiefly the energy of motion\r\nof its particles hastening in all directions and tending to scatter\r\napart. It is this which gives a gas its elasticity or expansive\r\nforce; the elasticity of a gas is well known to every one through its\r\npractical application in a pneumatic tyre. Now imagine yourself at\r\nsome point deep down in the star where you can look upwards towards\r\nthe surface or downwards towards the centre. Wherever you are, a\r\ncertain condition of balance must be reached; on the one hand there\r\nis the weight of all the layers above you pressing downwards and\r\ntrying to squeeze closer the gas beneath; on the other hand there is\r\nthe elasticity of the gas below you trying to expand and force the\r\nsuperincumbent layers outwards. Since neither one thing nor the other\r\nhappens and the star remains practically unchanged for hundreds of\r\nyears, we must infer that the two tendencies just balance. At each\r\npoint the elasticity of the gas must be just enough to balance the\r\nweight of the layers above; and since it is the heat which furnishes\r\nthe elasticity, this requirement settles how much heat the gas must\r\nhave. And so we find the degree of heat or temperature at each point.\r\n\r\nThe same thing can be expressed a little differently. As before, fix\r\nattention on a certain point in a star and consider how the matter\r\nabove it is supported. If it were not supported it would fall to the\r\ncentre under the attractive force of gravitation. The support is given\r\nby a succession of minute blows delivered by the particles underneath;\r\nwe have seen that their heat energy causes them to move in all\r\ndirections, and they keep on striking the matter above. Each blow gives\r\na slight boost upwards, and the whole succession of blows supports the\r\nupper material in shuttlecock fashion. (This process is not confined\r\nto the stars; for instance, it is in this way that a motor car is\r\nsupported by its tyres.) An increase of temperature would mean an\r\nincrease of activity of the particles, and therefore an increase in\r\nthe rapidity and strength of the blows. Evidently we have to assign a\r\ntemperature such that the sum total of the blows is neither too great\r\nnor too small to keep the upper material steadily supported. That in\r\nprinciple is our method of calculating the temperature.\r\n\r\nOne obvious difficulty arises, The whole supporting force will depend\r\nnot only on the activity of the particles (temperature) but also on\r\nthe number of them (density). Initially we do not know the density of\r\nthe matter at an arbitrary point deep within the sun. It is in this\r\nconnexion that the ingenuity of the mathematician is required. He has\r\na definite amount of matter to play with, viz. the known mass of the\r\nsun; so the more he uses in one part of the globe the less he will have\r\nto spare for other parts. He might say to himself, ‘I do not want to\r\nexaggerate the temperature, so I will see if I can manage without going\r\nbeyond 10,000,000°.’ That sets a limit to the activity to be ascribed\r\nto each particle; therefore when the mathematician reaches a great\r\ndepth in the sun and accordingly has a heavy weight of upper material\r\nto sustain, his only resource is to use large numbers of particles to\r\ngive the required total impulse. He will then find that he has used up\r\nall his particles too fast, and has nothing left to fill up the centre.\r\nOf course his structure, supported on nothing, would come tumbling\r\ndown into the hollow. In that way we can prove that it is impossible\r\nto build up a permanent star of the dimensions of the sun without\r\nintroducing an activity or temperature exceeding 10,000,000°. The\r\nmathematician can go a step beyond this; instead of merely finding a\r\nlower limit, he can ascertain what must be nearly the true temperature\r\ndistribution by taking into account the fact that the temperature\r\nmust not be ‘patchy’. Heat flows from one place to another, and any\r\npatchiness would soon be evened out in an actual star. I will leave the\r\nmathematician to deal more thoroughly with these considerations, which\r\nbelong to the following up of the clue; I am content if I have shown\r\nyou that there is an opening for an attack on the problem.\r\n\r\nThis kind of investigation was started more than fifty years ago. It\r\nhas been gradually developed and corrected, until now we believe that\r\nthe results must be nearly right--that we really know how hot it is\r\ninside a star.\r\n\r\nI mentioned just now a temperature of 6,000°; that was the temperature\r\nnear the surface--the region which we actually see. There is no serious\r\ndifficulty in determining this surface temperature by observation;\r\nin fact the same method is often used commercially for finding the\r\ntemperature of a furnace from the outside. It is for the deep regions\r\nout of sight that the highly theoretical method of calculation is\r\nrequired. This 6,000° is only the marginal heat of the great solar\r\nfurnace giving no idea of the terrific intensity within. Going down\r\ninto the interior the temperature rises rapidly to above a million\r\ndegrees, and goes on increasing until at the sun’s centre it is about\r\n40,000,000°.\r\n\r\nDo not imagine that 40,000,000° is a degree of heat so extreme that\r\ntemperature has become meaningless. These stellar temperatures are to\r\nbe taken quite literally. Heat is the energy of motion of the atoms or\r\nmolecules of a substance, and temperature which indicates the degree\r\nof heat is a way of stating how fast these atoms or molecules are\r\nmoving. For example, at the temperature of this room the molecules of\r\nair are rushing about with an average speed of 500 yards a second; if\r\nwe heated it up to 40,000,000° the speed would be just over 100 miles\r\na second. That is nothing to be alarmed about; the astronomer is quite\r\naccustomed to speeds like that. The velocities of the stars, or of the\r\nmeteors entering the earth’s atmosphere, are usually between 10 and 100\r\nmiles a second. The velocity of the earth travelling round the sun is\r\n20 miles a second. So that for an astronomer this is the most ordinary\r\ndegree of speed that could be suggested, and he naturally considers\r\n40,000,000° a very comfortable sort of condition to deal with. And if\r\nthe astronomer is not frightened by a speed of 100 miles a second, the\r\nexperimental physicist is quite contemptuous of it; for he is used\r\nto handling atoms shot off from radium and similar substances with\r\nspeeds of 10,000 miles a second. Accustomed as he is to watching these\r\nexpress atoms and testing what they are capable of doing, the physicist\r\nconsiders the jog-trot atoms of the stars very commonplace.\r\n\r\nBesides the atoms rushing to and fro in all directions we have in the\r\ninterior of a star great quantities of ether waves also rushing in\r\nall directions. Ether waves are called by different names according\r\nto their wave-length. The longest are the Hertzian waves used in\r\nbroadcasting; then come the infra-red heat waves; next come waves of\r\nordinary visible light; then ultra-violet photographic or chemical\r\nrays; then X-rays; then Gamma rays emitted by radio-active substances.\r\nProbably the shortest of all are the rays constituting the very\r\npenetrating radiation found in our atmosphere, which according to\r\nthe investigations of Kohlhörster and Millikan are believed to reach\r\nus from interstellar space. These are all fundamentally the same but\r\ncorrespond to different octaves. The eye is attuned to only one octave,\r\nso that most of them are invisible; but essentially they are of the\r\nsame nature as visible light.\r\n\r\nThe ether waves inside a star belong to the division called X-rays.\r\nThey are the same as the X-rays produced artificially in an X-ray tube.\r\nOn the average they are ‘softer’ (i.e. longer) than the X-rays used\r\nin hospitals, but not softer than some of those used in laboratory\r\nexperiments. Thus we have in the interior of a star something familiar\r\nand extensively studied in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nBesides the atoms and ether waves there is a third population to join\r\nin the dance. There are multitudes of free electrons. The electron is\r\nthe lightest thing known, weighing no more than ¹⁄₁₈₄₀ of the lightest\r\natom. It is simply a charge of negative electricity wandering about\r\nalone. An atom consists of a heavy nucleus which is usually surrounded\r\nby a girdle of electrons. It is often compared to a miniature solar\r\nsystem, and the comparison gives a proper idea of the _emptiness_\r\nof an atom. The nucleus is compared to the sun, and the electrons to\r\nthe planets. Each kind of atom--each chemical element--has a different\r\nquorum of planet electrons. Our own solar system with eight planets\r\nmight be compared especially with the atom of oxygen which has eight\r\ncirculating electrons. In terrestrial physics we usually regard the\r\ngirdle or crinoline of electrons as an essential part of the atom\r\nbecause we rarely meet with atoms incompletely dressed; when we do meet\r\nwith an atom which has lost one or two electrons from its system, we\r\ncall it an ‘ion’. But in the interior of a star, owing to the great\r\ncommotion going on, it would be absurd to exact such a meticulous\r\nstandard of attire. All our atoms have lost a considerable proportion\r\nof their planet electrons and are therefore _ions_ according to\r\nthe strict nomenclature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Ionization  of Atoms_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the high temperature inside a star the battering of the particles\r\nby one another, and more especially the collision of the ether waves\r\n(X-rays) with atoms, cause electrons to be broken off and set free.\r\nThese free electrons form the third population to which I have\r\nreferred. For each individual the freedom is only temporary, because it\r\nwill presently be captured by some other mutilated atom; but meanwhile\r\nanother electron will have been broken off somewhere else to take its\r\nplace in the free population. This breaking away of electrons from\r\natoms is called _ionization_, and as it is extremely important in\r\nthe study of the stars I will presently show you photographs of the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nMy subject is ‘Stars and Atoms’; I have already shown you photographs\r\nof a star, so I ought to show you a photograph of an atom. Nowadays\r\nthat is quite easy. Since there are some trillions of atoms present\r\nin the tiniest piece of material it would be very confusing if\r\nthe photograph showed them all. Happily the photograph exercises\r\ndiscrimination and shows only ‘express train’ atoms which flash past\r\nlike meteors, ignoring all the others. We can arrange a particle of\r\nradium to shoot only a few express atoms across the field of the\r\ncamera, and so have a clear picture of each of them.\r\n\r\nFig. 3[2] is a photograph of three or four atoms which have flashed\r\nacross the field of view--giving the broad straight tracks. These are\r\natoms of helium discharged at high speed from a radio-active substance.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is an under-current of suspicion in your minds\r\nthat there must be something of a fake about this photograph. Are\r\nthese really the single atoms that are showing themselves--those\r\ninfinitesimal units which not many years ago seemed to be theoretical\r\nconcepts far outside any practical apprehension? I will answer that\r\nquestion by asking you one. You see a dirty mark on the picture. Is\r\nthat somebody’s thumb? If you say Yes, then I assure you unhesitatingly\r\nthat these streaks are single atoms. But if you are hypercritical\r\nand say ‘No. That is not anybody’s thumb, but it is a mark that\r\nshows that somebody’s thumb has been there’, then I must be equally\r\ncautious and say that the streak is a mark that shows where an atom\r\nhas been. The photograph instead of being the impression of an atom\r\nis the impression of the impression of an atom, just as it is not the\r\nimpression of a thumb but the impression of the impression of a thumb.\r\nI don’t see that it really matters that the impression is second-hand\r\ninstead of first-hand. I do not think we have been guilty of any more\r\nfaking than the criminologist who scatters powder over a finger-print\r\nto make it visible, or a biologist who stains his preparations with\r\nthe same object. The atom in its passage leaves what we might call a\r\n‘scent’ along its trail; and we owe to Professor C. T. R. Wilson a most\r\ningenious device for making the scent visible. Professor Wilson’s ‘pack\r\nof hounds’ consists of water vapour which flocks to the trail and there\r\ncondenses into tiny drops.\r\n\r\nYou will next want to see a photograph of an electron. That also can be\r\nmanaged. The broken wavy trail in Fig. 3 is an electron. Owing to its\r\nsmall mass the electron is more easily turned aside in its course than\r\nthe heavy atom which rushes bull-headed through all obstacles. Fig. 4\r\nshows numerous electrons, and it includes one of very high speed which\r\non that account was able to make a straight track. Incidentally it\r\ngives away the device used for making the tracks visible, because you\r\ncan see the tiny drops of water separately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. FAST-MOVING ATOMS AND ELECTRONS]\r\n\r\nWe have seen photographs of atoms and free electrons. Now we want a\r\nphotograph of X-rays to complete the stellar population. We cannot\r\nquite manage that, but we can very nearly. Photographs _by_\r\nX-rays are common enough; but a photograph _of_ X-rays is a\r\ndifferent matter. I have already said that electrons can be broken\r\naway from atoms by X-rays colliding with them. When this happens the\r\nfree electron is usually shot off with high velocity so that it is one\r\nof the express electrons which can be photographed. In Fig. 5 you see\r\nfour electrons shot off in this way. You notice that they all start\r\nfrom points in the same line, and it does not require much imagination\r\nto see in your mind a mysterious power travelling along this line\r\nand creating the explosions. That power is the X-rays which were\r\ndirected in a narrow beam along the line (from right to left) when the\r\nphotograph was taken. Although the X-rays are left to your imagination,\r\nthe photograph at any rate shows the process of ionization which is so\r\nimportant in the stellar interior--the freeing of electrons from the\r\natoms by the incidence of X-rays. You notice that it is just a chance\r\nwhether the X-ray ionizes an atom when it meets it. There are trillions\r\nof atoms lying about (of which the photograph takes no notice); but,\r\nnevertheless, the X-rays travel a long way before meeting the atom\r\nwhich they choose to operate on.\r\n\r\nFinally I can show you the other method of ionizing atoms by battering\r\nof a more mechanical kind--in this case by the collision of a fast\r\nelectron. In Fig. 6 a fast electron was travelling nearly horizontally,\r\nbut the tiny water-drops that should mark its track are so spread out\r\nthat you do not at first trace the connexion. Notice that the drops\r\noccur in pairs. This is because the fast electron battered some of the\r\natoms along its track, wrenching away an electron from each. You see\r\nat intervals along the track a broken atom and a free electron lying\r\nside by side, though you cannot tell which is which. Occasionally the\r\noriginal fast electron was too vigorous and there is more of a mix up,\r\nbut usually you can see clearly the two fragments resulting from the\r\nsmash.[3]\r\n\r\nA cynic might remark that the interior of a star is a very safe\r\nsubject to talk about because no one can go there and prove that you\r\nare wrong. I would plead in reply that at least I am not abusing the\r\nunlimited opportunity for imagination; I am only asking you to allow\r\nin the interior of the star quite homely objects and processes which\r\ncan be photographed. Perhaps now you will turn round on me and say,\r\n‘What right have you to suppose that Nature is as barren of imagination\r\nas you are? Perhaps she has hidden in the star something novel which\r\nwill upset all your ideas.’ But I think that science would never have\r\nachieved much progress if it had always imagined unknown obstacles\r\nhidden round every corner. At least we may peer gingerly round the\r\ncorner, and perhaps we shall find there is nothing very formidable\r\nafter all. Our object in diving into the interior is not merely\r\nto admire a fantastic world with conditions transcending ordinary\r\nexperience; it is to get at the inner mechanism which makes stars\r\nbehave as they do. If we are to understand the surface manifestations,\r\nif we are to understand why ‘one star differeth from another star in\r\nglory’, we must go below--to the _engine-room_--to trace the\r\nbeginning of the stream of heat and energy which pours out through the\r\nsurface. Finally, then, our theory will take us back to the surface\r\nand we shall be able to test by comparison with observation whether we\r\nhave been badly misled. Meanwhile, although we naturally cannot prove a\r\ngeneral negative, there is no reason to anticipate anything which our\r\nlaboratory experience does not warn us of.\r\n\r\nThe X-rays in a star are the same as the X-rays experimented on in a\r\nlaboratory, but they are enormously more abundant in the star. We can\r\nproduce X-rays like the stellar X-rays, but we cannot produce them\r\nin anything like stellar abundance. The photograph (Fig. 5) showed\r\na laboratory beam of X-rays which had wrenched away four electrons\r\nfrom different atoms; these would be speedily recaptured. In the star\r\nyou must imagine the intensity multiplied many million-fold, so that\r\nelectrons are being wrenched away as fast as they settle and the atoms\r\nare kept stripped almost bare. The nearly complete mutilation of the\r\natoms is important in the study of the stars for two main reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first is this. An architect before pronouncing an opinion on the\r\nplans of a building will want to know whether the material shown in\r\nthe plans is to be wood or steel or tin or paper. Similarly it would\r\nseem essential before working out details about the interior of a\r\nstar to know whether it is made of heavy stuff like lead or light\r\nstuff like carbon. By means of the spectroscope we can find out a\r\ngreat deal about the chemical composition of the sun’s atmosphere;\r\nbut it would not be fair to take this as a sample of the composition\r\nof the sun as a whole. It would be very risky to make a guess at the\r\nelements preponderating in the deep interior. Thus we seem to have\r\nreached a deadlock. But now it turns out that when the atoms are\r\nthoroughly smashed up, they all behave nearly alike--at any rate in\r\nthose properties with which we are concerned in astronomy. The high\r\ntemperature--which we were inclined to be afraid of at first--has\r\nsimplified things for us, because it has to a large extent eliminated\r\ndifferences between different kinds of material. The structure\r\nof a star is an unusually simple physical problem; it is at low\r\ntemperatures such as we experience on the earth that matter begins\r\nto have troublesome and complicated properties. Stellar atoms are\r\nnude savages innocent of the class distinctions of our fully arrayed\r\nterrestrial atoms. We are thus able to make progress without guessing\r\nat the chemical composition of the interior. It is necessary to make\r\none reservation, viz. that there is not an excessive proportion of\r\nhydrogen. Hydrogen has its own way of behaving; but it makes very\r\nlittle difference which of the other 91 elements predominate.\r\n\r\nThe other point is one about which I shall have more to say later.\r\nIt is that we must realize that the atoms in the stars are mutilated\r\nfragments of the bulky atoms with extended electron systems familiar to\r\nus on the earth; and therefore the behaviour of stellar and terrestrial\r\ngases is by no means the same in regard to properties which concern the\r\nsize of the atoms.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the effect of the chemical composition of a star, we\r\nrevert to the problem of the support of the upper layers by the\r\ngas underneath. At a given temperature every independent particle\r\ncontributes the same amount of support no matter what its mass or\r\nchemical nature; the lighter atoms make up for their lack of mass by\r\nmoving more actively. This is a well-known law originally found in\r\nexperimental chemistry, but now explained by the kinetic theory of\r\nMaxwell and Boltzmann. Suppose we had originally assumed the sun to\r\nbe composed entirely of silver atoms and had made our calculations\r\nof temperature accordingly; afterwards we change our minds and\r\nsubstitute a lighter element, aluminium. A silver atom weighs just\r\nfour times as much as an aluminium atom; hence we must substitute\r\nfour aluminium atoms for every silver atom in order to keep the mass\r\nof the sun unchanged. But now the supporting force will everywhere be\r\nquadrupled, and all the mass will be heaved outwards by it if we make\r\nno further change. In order to keep the balance, the activity of each\r\nparticle must be reduced in the ratio ¼; that means that we must assign\r\nthroughout the aluminium sun temperatures ¼ of those assigned to the\r\nsilver sun. Thus for unsmashed atoms a change in the assigned chemical\r\ncomposition makes a big change in our inference as to the internal\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nBut if electrons are broken away from the atom these also become\r\nindependent particles rendering support to the upper layers. A\r\nfree electron gives just as much support as an atom does; it is of\r\nmuch smaller mass, but it moves about a hundred times as fast. The\r\nsmashing of one silver atom provides 47 free electrons, making with\r\nthe residual nucleus of the atom 48 particles in all. The aluminium\r\natom gives 13 electrons or 14 particles in all; thus 4 aluminium atoms\r\ngive 56 independent particles. The change from smashed silver to an\r\nequal mass of smashed aluminium only means a change from 48 to 56\r\nparticles, requiring a reduction of temperature by 14 per cent. We\r\ncan tolerate that degree of uncertainty in our estimates of internal\r\ntemperature;[4] it is a great improvement on the corresponding\r\ncalculation for unsmashed atoms which was uncertain by a factor 4.\r\n\r\nBesides bringing closer together the results for different varieties\r\nof chemical constitution, ionization by increasing the number of\r\nsupporting particles lowers the calculated temperatures considerably.\r\nIt is sometimes thought that the exceedingly high temperature assigned\r\nto the interior of a star is a modern sensationalism. That is not so.\r\nThe early investigators, who neglected both ionization and radiation\r\npressure, assigned much higher temperatures than those now accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Radiation Pressure and Mass_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars differ from one another in mass, that is to say, in\r\nthe quantity of material gathered together to form them; but the\r\ndifferences are not so large as we might have expected from the great\r\nvariety in brightness. We cannot always find out the mass of a star,\r\nbut there are a fair number of stars for which the mass has been\r\ndetermined by astronomical measurements. The mass of the sun is--I will\r\nwrite it on the blackboard--\r\n\r\n2000000000000000000000000000 tons\r\n\r\nI hope I have counted the 0’s rightly, though I dare say you would not\r\nmind much if there were one or two too many or too few. But Nature\r\n_does_ mind. When she made the stars she evidently attached great\r\nimportance to getting the number of 0’s right. She has an idea that\r\na star should contain a particular amount of material. Of course she\r\nallows what the officials at the mint would call a ‘remedy’. She may\r\neven pass a star with one 0 too many and give us an exceptionally\r\nlarge star, or with one 0 too few, giving a very small star. But these\r\ndeviations are rare, and a mistake of two 0’s is almost unheard of.\r\nUsually she adheres much more closely to her pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. IONIZATION BY X-RAYS]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. IONIZATION BY COLLISION]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does Nature keep count of the 0’s? It seems clear that there must\r\nbe something inside the star itself which keeps check and, so to speak,\r\nmakes a warning protest as soon as the right amount of material has\r\nbeen gathered together. We think we know how it is done. You remember\r\nthe ether waves inside the star. These are trying to escape outwards\r\nand they exert a pressure on the matter which is caging them in. This\r\noutward force, if it is sufficiently powerful to be worth considering\r\nin comparison with other forces, must be taken into account in any\r\nstudy of the equilibrium or stability of the star. Now in all small\r\nglobes this force is quite trivial; but its importance increases with\r\nthe mass of the globe, and it is calculated that at just about the\r\nabove mass it reaches equal status with the other forces governing\r\nthe equilibrium of the star. If we had never seen the stars and were\r\nsimply considering as a curious problem how big a globe of matter\r\ncould possibly hold together, we could calculate that there would be\r\nno difficulty up to about two thousand quadrillion tons; but beyond\r\nthat the conditions are entirely altered and this new force begins to\r\ntake control of the situation. Here, I am afraid, strict calculation\r\nstops, and no one has yet been able to calculate what the new force\r\nwill do with the star when it does take control. But it can scarcely be\r\nan accident that the stars are all so near to this critical mass; and\r\nso I venture to conjecture the rest of the story. The new force does\r\nnot _prohibit_ larger mass, but it makes it risky. It may help a\r\nmoderate rotation about the axis to break up the star. Consequently\r\nlarger masses will survive only rarely; for the most part stars will be\r\nkept down to the mass at which the new force first becomes a serious\r\nmenace. The force of gravitation collects together nebulous and chaotic\r\nmaterial; the force of radiation pressure chops it off into suitably\r\nsized lumps.\r\n\r\nThis force of radiation pressure is better known to many people under\r\nthe name ‘pressure of light’. The term ‘radiation’ comprises all kinds\r\nof ether-waves including light, so that the meaning is the same. It\r\nwas first shown theoretically and afterwards verified experimentally\r\nthat light exerts a minute pressure on any object on which it falls.\r\nTheoretically it would be possible to knock a man over by turning a\r\nsearchlight on him--only the searchlight would have to be excessively\r\nintense, and the man would probably be vaporized first. Pressure of\r\nlight probably plays a great part in many celestial phenomena. One of\r\nthe earliest suggestions was that the minute particles forming the\r\ntail of a comet are driven outwards by the pressure of sunlight, thus\r\naccounting for the fact that a comet’s tail points away from the sun.\r\nBut that particular application must be considered doubtful. Inside\r\nthe star the intense stream of light (or rather X-rays) is like a wind\r\nrushing outwards and distending the star.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Interior of a Star_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can now form some kind of a picture of the inside of a star--a\r\nhurly-burly of atoms, electrons, and ether-waves. Dishevelled atoms\r\ntear along at 100 miles a second, their normal array of electrons being\r\ntorn from them in the scrimmage. The lost electrons are speeding 100\r\ntimes faster to find new resting places. Let us follow the progress of\r\none of them. There is almost a collision as an electron approaches an\r\natomic nucleus, but putting on speed it sweeps round in a sharp curve.\r\nSometimes there is a side-slip at the curve, but the electron goes on\r\nwith increased or reduced energy. After a thousand narrow shaves, all\r\nhappening within a thousand millionth of a second, the hectic career is\r\nended by a worse side-slip than usual. The electron is fairly caught,\r\nand attached to an atom. But scarcely has it taken up its place when\r\nan X-ray bursts into the atom. Sucking up the energy of the ray the\r\nelectron darts off again on its next adventure.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the knockabout comedy of modern atomic physics is not very\r\ntender towards our aesthetic ideals. The stately drama of stellar\r\nevolution turns out to be more like the hair-breadth escapades on the\r\nfilms. The music of the spheres has almost a suggestion of--_jazz_.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the result of all this bustle? Very little. The atoms\r\nand electrons for all their hurry never get anywhere; they only\r\nchange places. The ether-waves are the only part of the population\r\nwhich accomplish anything permanent. Although apparently darting in\r\nall directions indiscriminately, they do on the average make a slow\r\nprogress outwards. There is no outward progress of the atoms and\r\nelectrons; gravitation sees to that. But slowly the encaged ether-waves\r\nleak outwards as through a sieve. An ether-wave hurries from one atom\r\nto another, forwards, backwards, now absorbed, now flung out again\r\nin a new direction, losing its identity, but living again in its\r\nsuccessor. With any luck it will in no unduly long time (ten thousand\r\nto ten million years according to the mass of the star) find itself\r\nnear the boundary. It changes at the lower temperature from X-rays to\r\nlight-rays, being altered a little at each re-birth. At last it is so\r\nnear the boundary that it can dart outside and travel forward in peace\r\nfor a few hundred years. Perhaps it may in the end reach some distant\r\nworld where an astronomer lies in wait to trap it in his telescope and\r\nextort from it the secrets of its birth-place.\r\n\r\nIt is the leakage that we particularly want to determine; and that\r\nis why we have to study patiently what is going on in the turbulent\r\ncrowd. To put the problem in another form; the waves are urged to flow\r\nout by the temperature gradient in the star, but are hindered and\r\nturned back by their adventures with the atoms and electrons. It is\r\nthe task of mathematics, aided by the laws and theories developed from\r\na study of these same processes in the laboratory, to calculate the\r\ntwo factors--the factor urging and the factor hindering the outward\r\nflow--and hence to find the leakage. This calculated leakage should,\r\nof course, agree with astronomical measurements of the energy of heat\r\nand light pouring out of the star. And so finally we arrive at an\r\nobservational test of the theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Opacity of Stellar Matter_\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us consider the factor which hinders the leakage--the turning back\r\nof the ether-waves by their encounters with atoms and electrons. If\r\nwe were dealing with light waves we should call this obstruction to\r\ntheir passage ‘opacity’, and we may conveniently use the same term for\r\nobstruction to X-rays.\r\n\r\nWe soon realize that the material of the star must be decidedly opaque.\r\nThe quantity of radiation in the interior is so great that unless it\r\nwere very severely confined the leakage would be much greater than the\r\namount which we observe coming out of the stars. The following is an\r\nillustration of the typical degree of opacity required to agree with\r\nthe observed leakage. Let us enter the star Capella and find a region\r\nwhere the density is the same as that of the atmosphere around us;[5]\r\na slab of the material only two inches thick would form a screen so\r\nopaque that only one-third of the ether-waves falling on one side\r\nwould get through to the other side, the rest being absorbed in the\r\nscreen. A foot or two of the material would be practically a perfect\r\nscreen. If we are thinking of light-waves this seems an astonishing\r\nopacity for material as tenuous as air; but we have to remember that\r\nit is an opacity to X-rays, and the practical physicist knows well the\r\ndifficulty of getting the softer kinds of X-rays to pass through even a\r\nfew millimetres of air.\r\n\r\nThere is a gratifying accordance in general order of magnitude between\r\nthe opacity inside the star, determined from astronomical observation\r\nof leakage, and the opacity of terrestrial substances to X-rays of more\r\nor less the same wave-length. This gives us some assurance that our\r\ntheory is on the right track. But a careful comparison shows us that\r\nthere is some important difference between the stellar and terrestrial\r\nopacity.\r\n\r\nIn the laboratory we find that the opacity increases very rapidly with\r\nthe wave-length of the X-rays that are used. We do not find anything\r\nlike the same difference in the stars although the X-rays in the cooler\r\nstars must be of considerably greater wave-length than those in the\r\nhotter stars. Also, taking care to make the comparison at the same\r\nwave-length for both, we find that the stellar opacity is less than the\r\nterrestrial opacity. We must follow up this divergence.\r\n\r\nThere is more than one way in which an atom can obstruct ether-waves,\r\nbut there seems to be no doubt that for X-rays both in the stars and in\r\nthe laboratory the main part of the opacity depends on the process of\r\nionization. The ether-wave falls on an atom and its energy is sucked up\r\nby one of the planet electrons which uses it to escape from the atom\r\nand travel away at high speed. The point to notice is that in the very\r\nact of absorption the absorbing mechanism is broken, and it cannot\r\nbe used again until it has been repaired. To repair it the atom must\r\ncapture one of the free electrons wandering about, inducing it to take\r\nthe place of the lost electron.\r\n\r\nIn the laboratory we can only produce thin streams of X-rays so that\r\neach wave-trap is only called upon to act occasionally. There is\r\nplenty of time to repair it before the next time it has a chance of\r\ncatching anything; and there is practically no loss of efficiency\r\nthrough the traps being out of order. But in the stars the stream of\r\nX-rays is exceedingly intense. It is like an army of mice marching\r\nthrough your larder springing the mouse-traps as fast as you can set\r\nthem. Here it is the time wasted in resetting the traps--by capturing\r\nelectrons--which counts, and the amount of the catch depends almost\r\nentirely on this.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the stellar atoms have lost most of their electrons;\r\nthat means that at any moment a large proportion of the absorption\r\ntraps are awaiting repair. For this reason we find a smaller opacity in\r\nthe stars than in terrestrial material. The lowered opacity is simply\r\nthe result of overworking the absorbing mechanisms--they have too\r\nmuch radiation to deal with. We can also see why the laws of stellar\r\nand terrestrial opacity are somewhat different. The rate of repair,\r\nwhich is the main consideration in stellar opacity, is increased by\r\ncompressing the material, because then the atom will not have to wait\r\nso long to meet and capture a free electron. Consequently the stellar\r\nopacity will increase with the density. In terrestrial conditions there\r\nis no advantage in accelerating the repair which will in any case be\r\ncompleted in sufficient time; thus terrestrial opacity is independent\r\nof the density.\r\n\r\nThe theory of stellar opacity thus reduces mainly to the theory of\r\nthe capture of electrons by ionized atoms; not that this process\r\nis attended by absorption of X-rays--it is actually attended by\r\nemission--but it is the necessary preliminary to absorption. The\r\nphysical theory of electron-capture is not yet fully definitive; but it\r\nis sufficiently advanced for us to make use of it provisionally in our\r\ncalculations of the hindering factor in the leakage of radiation from\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _The Relation of Brightness to Mass_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not want to tackle too difficult a problem at first, and so we\r\nshall deal with stars composed of perfect gas. If you do not like\r\nthe technical phrase ‘perfect gas’ you can call it simply ‘gas’,\r\nbecause all the terrestrial gases that you are likely to think of are\r\nwithout sensible imperfection. It is only under high compression that\r\nterrestrial gases become imperfect. I should mention that there are\r\nplenty of examples of gaseous[6] stars. In many stars the material\r\nis so inflated that it is more tenuous than the air around us; for\r\nexample, if you were inside Capella you would not notice the material\r\nof Capella any more than you notice the air in this room.\r\n\r\nFor gaseous stars, then, the investigation will give formulae by which,\r\ngiven the mass of the star, we can calculate how much energy of heat\r\nand light will leak out of it--in short, how bright it will be. In\r\nFig. 7 a curve is drawn giving this theoretical relation between the\r\nbrightness and mass of a star. Strictly speaking, there is another\r\nfactor besides the mass which affects the calculated brightness; you\r\ncan have two stars of the same mass, the one dense and the other puffed\r\nout, and they will not have quite the same brightness. But it turns\r\nout (rather unexpectedly) that this other factor, density, makes very\r\nlittle difference to the brightness, always provided that the material\r\nis not too dense to be a perfect gas. I shall therefore say no more\r\nabout density in this brief summary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere are a few details about the scale of the diagram. The brightness\r\nis measured in magnitudes, a rather technical unit. You have to\r\nremember that stellar magnitude is like a golfer’s handicap--the bigger\r\nthe number, the worse the performance. The diagram includes practically\r\nthe whole range of stellar brightness; at the top -4 represents\r\nalmost the brightest stars known, and at the bottom 12 is nearly the\r\nfaintest limit. The difference from top to bottom is about the same as\r\nthe difference between an arc light and a glow worm. The sun is near\r\nmagnitude 5. These magnitudes refer, of course, to the true brightness,\r\nnot to the apparent brightness affected by distance; also, what is\r\nrepresented here is the ‘heat brightness’ or heat intensity, which is\r\nsometimes a little different from the light intensity. Astronomical\r\ninstruments have been made which measure directly the heat instead of\r\nthe light received from a star. These are quite successful; but there\r\nare troublesome corrections on account of the large absorption of heat\r\nin the earth’s atmosphere, and it is in most cases easier and more\r\naccurate to infer the heat brightness from the light brightness, making\r\nallowance for the colour of the star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. The Mass-luminosity Curve.]\r\n\r\nThe horizontal scale refers to mass, but it is graduated according to\r\nthe logarithm of the mass. At the extreme left the mass is about ⅙ x\r\nsun, and on the extreme right about 30 x sun; there are very few stars\r\nwith masses outside these limits. The sun’s mass corresponds to the\r\ndivision labelled 0·0.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained our theoretical curve, the first thing to do is to test\r\nit by observation. That is to say, we gather together as many stars as\r\nwe can lay hands on for which both the mass and absolute brightness\r\nhave been measured. We plot the corresponding points (opposite to the\r\nappropriate horizontal and vertical graduations) and see whether they\r\nfall on the curve, as they ought to do if the theory is right. There\r\nare not many stellar masses determined with much precision. Everything\r\nthat is reasonably trustworthy has been included in Fig. 7. The\r\ncircles, crosses, squares, and triangles refer to different kinds of\r\ndata--some good, some bad, some very bad.\r\n\r\nThe circles are the most trustworthy. Let us run through them from\r\nright to left. First comes the bright component of Capella, lying\r\nbeautifully on the curve--because I drew the curve through it. You\r\nsee, there was one numerical constant which in the present state of\r\nour knowledge of atoms and ether-waves, &c., it was not possible to\r\ndetermine with any confidence from pure theory. So the curve when it\r\nwas obtained was loose in one direction and could be raised or lowered.\r\nIt was anchored by making it pass through the bright component of\r\nCapella which seemed the best star to trust to for this purpose. After\r\nthat there could be no further tampering with the curve. Continuing to\r\nthe left we have the fainter component of Capella; next Sirius; then,\r\nin a bunch, two components of α Centauri (the nearest fixed star) with\r\nthe Sun between them, and--lying on the curve--a circle representing\r\nthe mean of six double stars in the Hyades. Finally, far on the left\r\nthere are two components of a well-known double star called Krueger 60.\r\n\r\nThe observational data for testing the curve are not so extensive and\r\nnot so trustworthy as we could wish; but still I think it is plain from\r\nFig. 7 that the theory is substantially confirmed, and it really does\r\nenable us to predict the brightness of a star from its mass, or vice\r\nversa. That is a useful result, because there are thousands of stars of\r\nwhich we can measure the absolute brightness but not the mass, and we\r\ncan now infer their masses with some confidence.\r\n\r\nSince I have not been able to give here the details of the calculation,\r\nI should make it plain that the curve in Fig. 7 is traced by pure\r\ntheory or terrestrial experiment except for the one constant determined\r\nby making it pass through Capella. We can imagine physicists working\r\non a cloud-bound planet such as Jupiter who have never seen the stars.\r\nThey should be able to deduce by the method explained on p. 25 that\r\nif there is a universe existing beyond the clouds it is likely to\r\naggregate primarily into masses of the order a thousand quadrillion\r\ntons. They could then predict that these aggregations will be globes\r\npouring out light and heat and that their brightness will depend on\r\nthe mass in the way given by the curve in Fig. 7. All the information\r\nthat we have used for the calculations would be accessible to them\r\nbeneath the clouds, except that we have stolen one advantage over\r\nthem in utilizing the bright component of Capella. Even without this\r\nforbidden peep, present-day physical theory would enable them to assign\r\na brightness to the invisible stellar host which would not be absurdly\r\nwrong. Unless they were wiser than us they would probably ascribe to\r\nall the stars a brilliance about ten times too great[7]--not a bad\r\nerror for a first attempt at so transcendent a problem. We hope to\r\nclear up the discrepant factor 10 with further knowledge of atomic\r\nprocesses; meanwhile we shelve it by fixing the doubtful constant by\r\nastronomical observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Dense Stars_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agreement of the observational points with the curve is remarkably\r\nclose, considering the rough nature of the observational measurements;\r\nand it seems to afford a rather strong confirmation of the theory. But\r\nthere is one awful confession to make--_we have compared the theory\r\nwith the wrong stars_. At least when the comparison was first made\r\nat the beginning of 1924 no one entertained any doubt that they were\r\nthe wrong stars.\r\n\r\nWe must recall that the theory was developed for stars in the condition\r\nof a perfect gas. In the right half of Fig. 7 the stars represented\r\nare all diffuse stars; Capella with a mean density about equal to that\r\nof the air in this room may be taken as typical. Material of this\r\ntenuity is evidently a true gas, and in so far as these stars agree\r\nwith the curve the theory is confirmed. But in the left half of the\r\ndiagram we have the Sun whose material is denser than water, Krueger\r\n60 denser than iron, and many other stars of the density usually\r\nassociated with solid or liquid matter. What business have they on the\r\ncurve reserved for a perfect gas? When these stars were put into the\r\ndiagram it was not with any expectation that they would agree with\r\nthe curve; in fact, the agreement was most annoying. Something very\r\ndifferent was being sought for. The idea was that the theory might\r\nperhaps be trusted on its own merits with such confirmation as the\r\ndiffuse stars had already afforded; then by measuring how far these\r\ndense stars fell below the curve we should have definite information\r\nas to how great a deviation from a perfect gas occurred at any given\r\ndensity. According to current ideas it was expected that the sun would\r\nfall three or four magnitudes below the curve, and the still denser\r\nKrueger 60 should be nearly ten magnitudes below.[8] You see that the\r\nexpectation was entirely unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe shock was even greater than I can well indicate to you, because\r\nthe great drop in brightness when the star is too dense to behave\r\nas a true gas was a fundamental tenet in our conception of stellar\r\nevolution. On the strength of it the stars had been divided into two\r\ngroups known as giants and dwarfs, the former being the gaseous stars\r\nand the latter the dense stars.\r\n\r\nTwo alternatives now lie before us. The first is to assume that\r\nsomething must have gone wrong with our theory; that the true curve for\r\ngaseous stars is not as we have drawn it, but runs high up on the left\r\nof the diagram so that the Sun, Krueger 60, &c., are at the appropriate\r\ndistances below it. In short, our imaginary critic was right; Nature\r\nhad hidden something unexpected inside the star and so frustrated our\r\ncalculations. Well, if this were so, it would be something to have\r\nfound it out by our investigations.\r\n\r\nThe other alternative is to consider this question--Is it impossible\r\nthat a perfect gas should have the density of iron? The answer is\r\nrather surprising. There is no earthly reason why a perfect gas should\r\nnot have a density far exceeding iron. Or it would be more accurate to\r\nsay, the reason why it should not is _earthly_ and does not apply\r\nto the stars.\r\n\r\nThe sun’s material, in spite of being denser than water, really is\r\na perfect gas. It sounds incredible, but it must be so. The feature\r\nof a true gas is that there is plenty of room between the separate\r\nparticles--a gas contains very little substance and lots of emptiness.\r\nConsequently when you squeeze it you do not have to squeeze the\r\nsubstance; you just squeeze out some of the waste space. But if\r\nyou go on squeezing, there comes a time when you have squeezed out\r\nall the empty space; the atoms are then jammed in contact and any\r\nfurther compression means squeezing the substance itself, which is\r\nquite a different proposition. So as you approach that density the\r\ncompressibility characteristic of a gas is lost and the matter is no\r\nlonger a proper gas. In a liquid the atoms are nearly in contact;\r\nthat will give you an idea of the density at which the gas loses its\r\ncharacteristic compressibility.\r\n\r\nThe big terrestrial atoms which begin to jam at a density near that\r\nof the liquid state do not exist in the stars. The stellar atoms have\r\nbeen trimmed down by the breaking off of all their outer electrons. The\r\nlighter atoms are stripped to the bare nucleus--of quite insignificant\r\nsize. The heavier atoms retain a few of the closer electrons, but have\r\nnot much more than a hundredth of the diameter of a fully arrayed atom.\r\nConsequently we can go on squeezing ever so much more before these\r\ntiny atoms or ions jam in contact. At the density of water or even of\r\nplatinum there is still any amount of room between the trimmed atoms;\r\nand waste space remains to be squeezed out as in a perfect gas.\r\n\r\nOur mistake was that in estimating the congestion in the stellar\r\nball-room we had forgotten that crinolines are no longer in fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was, I suppose, very blind of us not to have foreseen this result,\r\nconsidering how much attention we had been paying to the mutilation\r\nof the atoms in other branches of the investigation. By a roundabout\r\nroute we have reached a conclusion which is really very obvious. And\r\nso we conclude that the stars on the left of the diagram are after\r\nall not the ‘wrong’ stars. The sun and other dense stars are on the\r\nperfect gas curve because their material is perfect gas. Careful\r\ninvestigation has shown that in the small stars on the extreme left of\r\nFig. 7 the electric charges of the atoms and electrons bring about a\r\nslight deviation from the ordinary laws of a gas; it has been shown by\r\nR. H. Fowler that the effect is to make the gas not _imperfect_\r\nbut _superperfect_--it is _more_ easily compressed than an\r\nordinary gas. You will notice that on the average the stars run a\r\nlittle above the curve on the left of Fig. 7. It is probable that the\r\ndeviation is genuine and is partly due to superperfection of the gas;\r\nwe have already seen that imperfection would have brought them below\r\nthe curve.\r\n\r\nEven at the density of platinum there is plenty of waste space, so\r\nthat in the stars we might go on squeezing stellar matter to a density\r\ntranscending anything known on the earth. But that’s another story--I\r\nwill tell it later on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general agreement between the observed and predicted brightness of\r\nthe stars of various masses is the main test of the correctness of our\r\ntheories of their internal constitution. The incidence of their masses\r\nin a range which is especially critical for radiation pressure is also\r\nvaluable confirmation. It would be an exaggeration to claim that this\r\nlimited success is a proof that we have reached the truth about the\r\nstellar interior. It is not a proof, but it is an encouragement to work\r\nfarther along the line of thought which we have been pursuing. The\r\ntangle is beginning to loosen. The more optimistic may assume that it\r\nis now straightened out; the more cautious will make ready for the next\r\nknot. The one reason for thinking that the real truth cannot be so very\r\nfar away is that in the interior of a star, if anywhere, the problem\r\nof matter is reduced to its utmost simplicity; and the astronomer is\r\nengaged on what is essentially a less ambitious problem than that of\r\nthe terrestrial physicist to whom matter always appears in the guise\r\nof electron systems of the most complex organization.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the present-day theories of physics and pressed them to\r\ntheir remotest conclusions. There is no dogmatic intention in this;\r\nit is the best means we have of testing them and revealing their\r\nweaknesses if any.\r\n\r\nIn ancient days two aviators procured to themselves wings. Daedalus\r\nflew safely through the middle air and was duly honoured on his\r\nlanding. Icarus soared upwards to the sun till the wax melted which\r\nbound his wings and his flight ended in fiasco. In weighing their\r\nachievements, there is something to be said for Icarus. The classical\r\nauthorities tell us that he was only ‘doing a stunt’, but I prefer to\r\nthink of him as the man who brought to light a serious constructional\r\ndefect in the flying-machines of his day. So, too, in Science. Cautious\r\nDaedalus will apply his theories where he feels confident they will\r\nsafely go; but by his excess of caution their hidden weaknesses remain\r\nundiscovered. Icarus will strain his theories to the breaking-point\r\ntill the weak joints gape. For the mere adventure? Perhaps partly; that\r\nis human nature. But if he is destined not yet to reach the sun and\r\nsolve finally the riddle of its constitution, we may at least hope to\r\nlearn from his journey some hints to build a better machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LECTURE II\r\n\r\n                      SOME RECENT INVESTIGATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIT will help us to appreciate the astronomical significance of what we\r\nhave learnt in the previous lecture if we turn from the general to the\r\nparticular and see how it applies to individual stars. I will take two\r\nstars round which centre stories of special interest, and relate the\r\nhistory of our knowledge of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _The Story of Algol_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a detective story, which we might call ‘The Missing Word and\r\nthe False Clue’.\r\n\r\nIn astronomy, unlike many sciences, we cannot handle and probe the\r\nobjects of our study; we have to wait passively and receive and decode\r\nthe messages that they send to us. The whole of our information\r\nabout the stars comes to us along rays of light; we watch and try\r\nto understand their signals. There are some stars which seem to be\r\nsending us a regular series of dots and dashes--like the intermittent\r\nlight from a lighthouse. We cannot translate this as a morse code;\r\nnevertheless, by careful measurement we disentangle a great deal of\r\ninformation from the messages. The star Algol is the most famous of\r\nthese ‘variable stars’. We learn from the signals that it is really two\r\nstars revolving round each other. Sometimes the brighter of the two\r\nstars is hidden, giving a deep eclipse or ‘dash’; sometimes the faint\r\nstar is hidden, giving a ‘dot’. This recurs in a period of 2 days 21\r\nhours--the period of revolution of the two stars.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal more information in the message, but it was\r\nrather tantalizing. There was, so to speak, just one word missing. If\r\nwe could supply that word the message would give full and accurate\r\nparticulars as to the size of the system--the diameters and masses of\r\nthe two components, their absolute brightness, the distance between\r\nthem, their distance from the sun. Lacking the word the message told us\r\nnothing really definite about any of these things.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances astronomers would scarcely have been human if\r\nthey had not tried to guess the missing word. The word should have told\r\nus how much bigger the bright star was than the fainter, that is to\r\nsay, the ratio of the masses of the two stars. Some of the less famous\r\nvariable stars give us complete messages. (These could accordingly be\r\nused for testing the relation of mass and absolute brightness, and are\r\nrepresented by triangles in Fig. 7.) The difficulty about Algol arose\r\nfrom the excessive brightness of the bright component which swamped and\r\nmade illegible the more delicate signals from the faint component. From\r\nthe other systems we could find the most usual value of the mass ratio,\r\nand base on that a guess as to its probable value for Algol. Different\r\nauthorities preferred slightly different estimates, but the general\r\njudgement was that in systems like Algol the bright component is twice\r\nas massive as the faint component. And so the missing word was assumed\r\nto be ‘two’; on this assumption the various dimensions of the system\r\nwere worked out and came to be generally accepted as near the truth.\r\nThat was sixteen years ago.[9]\r\n\r\nIn this way the sense of the message was made out to be that the\r\nbrighter star had a radius of 1,100,000 kilometres (one and a half\r\ntimes the sun’s radius), that it had half the mass of the sun, and\r\nthirty times the sun’s light-power, &c. It will be seen at once that\r\nthis will not fit our curve in Fig. 7; a star of half the sun’s mass\r\nought to be very much fainter than the sun. It was rather disconcerting\r\nto find so famous a star protesting against the theory; but after\r\nall the theory is to be tested by comparison with facts and not with\r\nguesses, and the theory might well have a sounder basis than the\r\nconjecture as to the missing word. Moreover, the spectral type of Algol\r\nis one that is not usually associated with low mass, and this cast some\r\nsuspicion on the accepted results.\r\n\r\nIf we are willing to trust the theory given in the last lecture we\r\ncan do without the missing word. Or, to put it another way, we can\r\ntry in succession various guesses instead of ‘two’ until we reach one\r\nthat gives the bright component a mass and luminosity agreeing with\r\nthe curve in Fig. 7. The guess ‘two’ gives, as we have seen, a point\r\nwhich falls a long way from the curve. Alter the guess to ‘three’\r\nand recalculate the mass and brightness on this assumption; the\r\ncorresponding point is now somewhat nearer to the curve. Continue with\r\n‘four’, ‘five’, &c.; if the point crosses the curve we know that we\r\nhave gone too far and must take an intermediate value in order to reach\r\nthe desired agreement. This was done in November 1925, and it appeared\r\nthat the missing word must be ‘five’, not ‘two’--a rather startling\r\nchange. And now the message ran--\r\n\r\nRadius of bright component = 2,140,000 kilometres.\r\n\r\nMass of bright component = 4·3 x sun’s mass.\r\n\r\nIf you compare these with the original figures you will see that there\r\nis a great alteration. The star is now assigned a large mass much\r\nmore appropriate to a B-type star. It also turns out that Algol is\r\nmore than a hundred times as bright as the sun; and its parallax is\r\n0·028\"--twice the distance previously supposed.\r\n\r\nAt the time there seemed little likelihood that these conclusions could\r\nbe tested. Possibly the prediction as to the parallax might be proved\r\nor disproved by a trigonometrical determination; but it is so small as\r\nto be almost out of range of reasonably accurate measurement. We could\r\nonly adopt a ‘take it or leave it’ attitude--‘If you accept the theory,\r\n_this_ is what Algol is like; if you distrust the theory, these\r\nresults are of no interest to you.’\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile two astronomers at Ann Arbor Observatory had been making\r\na search for the missing word by a remarkable new method. They had in\r\nfact found the word and published it a year before, but it had not\r\nbecome widely known. If a star is rotating, one edge or ‘limb’ is\r\ncoming towards us and the other going away from us. We can measure\r\nspeeds towards us or away from us by means of the Doppler effect on\r\nthe spectrum, obtaining a definite result in miles per second. Thus\r\nwe can and do measure the equatorial speed of rotation of the sun\r\nby observing first the east limb then the west limb and taking the\r\ndifference of velocity shown. That is all very well on the sun, where\r\nyou can cover up the disk except the special part that you want to\r\nobserve; but how can you cover up part of a star when a star is a mere\r\npoint of light? _You_ cannot; but in Algol the covering up is done\r\nfor you. The faint component is your screen. As it passes in front\r\nof the bright star there is a moment when it leaves a thin crescent\r\nshowing on the east and another moment when a thin crescent on the west\r\nis uncovered. Of course, the star is too far away for you actually to\r\nsee the crescent shape, but at these moments you receive light from\r\nthe crescents only, the rest of the disk being hidden. By seizing\r\nthese moments you can make the measurements just as though you had\r\nmanipulated the screen yourself. Fortunately the speed of rotation of\r\nAlgol is large and so can be measured with relatively small error. Now\r\nmultiply the equatorial velocity by the period of rotation;[10] that\r\nwill give you the circumference of Algol. Divide by 6·28, and you have\r\nthe radius.\r\n\r\nThat was the method developed by Rossiter and McLaughlin. The latter\r\nwho applied it to Algol found the radius of the bright component to be\r\n\r\n                         2,180,000 kilometres.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be judged his result has considerable accuracy; indeed it\r\nis probable that the radius is now better known than that of any other\r\nstar except the sun. If you will now turn back to p. 44 and compare\r\nit with the value found from the theory you will see that there is\r\ncause for satisfaction. McLaughlin evaluated the other constants and\r\ndimensions of the system; these agree equally well, but that follows\r\nautomatically because there was only one missing word to be supplied.\r\nIn both determinations the missing word or mass ratio turned out to be\r\n5·0.\r\n\r\nThis is not quite the end of the story. Why had the first guess at\r\nthe mass ratio gone so badly wrong? We understand by now that a\r\ndisparity in mass is closely associated with a disparity in brightness\r\nof the two stars. The disparity in brightness was given in Algol’s\r\noriginal message; it informed us that the faint component gives about\r\none-thirteenth of the light of the bright one. (At least that was how\r\nwe interpreted it.) According to our curve this corresponds to a mass\r\nratio 2½, which is not much improvement on the original guess 2. For a\r\nmass ratio 5 the companion ought to have been much fainter--in fact its\r\nlight should have been undetectable. Although considerations like these\r\ncould not have had much influence on the original guess, they seemed at\r\nfirst to reassure us that there was not very much wrong with it.\r\n\r\nLet us call the bright component Algol A and the faint component Algol\r\nB. Some years ago a new discovery was made, namely Algol C. It was\r\nfound that Algol A and B together travel in an orbit round a third star\r\nin a period of just under two years--at least they are travelling round\r\nin this period, and we must suppose that there is something present\r\nfor them to revolve around. Hitherto we had believed that when Algol\r\nA was nearly hidden at the time of deepest eclipse all the remaining\r\nlight must come from Algol B; but now it is clear that it belongs to\r\nAlgol C, which is always shining without interference. Consequently the\r\nmass ratio 2½ is that of Algol A to Algol C. The light from Algol B is\r\ninappreciable as it should be for a mass ratio 5.[11]\r\n\r\nThe message from Algol A and B was confused, not only on account of\r\nthe missing word, but because a word or two of another message from\r\nAlgol C had got mixed up with it; so that even when the missing word\r\nwas found to be ‘five’ and confirmed in two ways, the message was\r\nnot quite coherent. In another place the message seemed to waver\r\nand read ‘two-and-a-half’. The finishing step is the discovery that\r\n‘two-and-a-half’ belongs to a different message from a previously\r\nunsuspected star, Algol C. And so it all ends happily.\r\n\r\nThe best detective is not infallible. In this story our astronomical\r\ndetective made a reasonable but unsuccessful guess near the beginning\r\nof the case. He might have seen his error earlier, only there was a\r\nfalse clue dropped by a third party who happened to be present at the\r\ncrime, which seemed to confirm the guess. This was very unlucky. But it\r\nmakes all the better detective story of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _The Story of the Companion of Sirius_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this detective story is ‘The Nonsensical Message’.\r\n\r\nSirius is the most conspicuous star in the sky. Naturally it was\r\nobserved very often in early days, and it was used by astronomers along\r\nwith other bright stars to determine time and set the clocks by. It\r\nwas a _clock star_, as we say. But it turned out that it was not\r\nat all a good clock; it would gain steadily for some years, and then\r\nlose. In 1844 Bessel found out the cause of this irregularity; Sirius\r\nwas describing an elliptic orbit. Obviously there must be something\r\nfor it to move around, and so it came to be recognized that there was\r\na dark star there which no one had ever seen. I doubt whether any one\r\nexpected it would ever be seen. The Companion of Sirius was, I believe,\r\nthe first invisible star to be regularly recognized. We ought not to\r\ncall such a star hypothetical. The mechanical properties of matter are\r\nmuch more crucial than the accidental property of being visible; we\r\ndo not consider a transparent pane of glass ‘hypothetical’. There was\r\nnear Sirius something which exhibited the most universal mechanical\r\nproperty of matter, namely, exerting force on neighbouring matter\r\naccording to the law of gravitation. That is better evidence of the\r\nexistence of a material mass than ocular evidence would be.\r\n\r\nHowever, eighteen years later the Companion of Sirius was actually\r\nseen by Alvan Clark. This discovery was unique in its way; Clark was\r\nnot looking at Sirius because he was interested in it, but because\r\nSirius was a nice bright point of light with which to test the optical\r\nperfection of a large new object-glass that his firm had made. I dare\r\nsay that when he saw the little point of light close to Sirius he was\r\ndisappointed and tried to polish it away. However, it stayed, and\r\nproved to be the already known but hitherto unseen Companion.\r\n\r\nThe big modern telescopes easily show the star and rather spoil the\r\nromance; but as romance faded, knowledge grew, and we now know that the\r\nCompanion is a star not much less massive than the sun. It has ⅘ths of\r\nthe mass of the sun, but gives out only ¹⁄₃₆₀th of the sun’s light. The\r\nfaintness did not particularly surprise us;[11] presumably there should\r\nbe white-hot stars glowing very brightly and red-hot stars glowing\r\nfeebly, with all sorts of intermediate degrees of brightness. It was\r\nassumed that the Companion was one of the feeble stars only just red\r\nhot.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 Professor Adams at the Mount Wilson Observatory found that it\r\nwas not a red star. It was white--white hot. Why, then, was it not\r\nshining brilliantly? Apparently the only answer was that it must be a\r\nvery small star. You see, the nature and colour of the light show that\r\nits surface must be glowing more intensely than the sun’s; but the\r\ntotal light is only ¹⁄₃₆₀th of the sun’s; therefore the surface must\r\nbe less than ¹⁄₃₆₀th of the sun’s. That makes the radius less than\r\n¹⁄₁₉th of the sun’s radius, and brings the globe down to a size which\r\nwe ordinarily associate with a planet rather than with a star. Working\r\nout the sum more accurately we find that the Companion of Sirius is a\r\nglobe intermediate in size between the earth and the next larger planet\r\nUranus. But if you are going to put a mass not much less than that of\r\nthe sun into a globe not very much larger than the earth, it will be\r\na tight squeeze. The actual density works out at 60,000 times that of\r\nwater--just about a ton to the cubic inch.\r\n\r\nWe learn about the stars by receiving and interpreting the messages\r\nwhich their light brings to us. The message of the Companion of Sirius\r\nwhen it was decoded ran: ‘I am composed of material 3,000 times denser\r\nthan anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material would\r\nbe a little nugget that you could put in a match-box.’ What reply can\r\none make to such a message? The reply which most of us made in 1914\r\nwas--‘Shut up. Don’t talk nonsense.’\r\n\r\nBut in 1924 the theory described in the last lecture had been\r\ndeveloped; and you will remember that at the end it pointed to the\r\npossibility that matter in the stars might be compressed to a density\r\nmuch transcending our terrestrial experience. This called back to mind\r\nthe strange message of the Companion of Sirius. It could no longer\r\nbe dismissed as obvious nonsense. That does not mean that we could\r\nimmediately assume it to be true; but it must be weighed and tested\r\nwith a caution which we should not care to waste over a mere nonsense\r\njingle.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that it was very difficult to explain away\r\nthe original message as a mistake. As to the mass being ⅘ths of the\r\nsun’s mass there can be no serious doubt at all. It is one of the very\r\nbest determinations of stellar mass. Moreover, it is obvious that the\r\nmass must be large if it is to sway Sirius out of its course and upset\r\nits punctuality as a clock. The determination of the radius is less\r\ndirect, but it is made by a method which has had conspicuous success\r\nwhen applied to other stars. For example, the radius of the huge star\r\nBetelgeuse was first calculated in this way; afterwards it was found\r\npossible to measure directly the radius of Betelgeuse by means of\r\nan interferometer devised by Michelson, and the direct measurement\r\nconfirmed the calculated value. Again the Companion of Sirius does not\r\nstand alone in its peculiarity. At least two other stars have sent us\r\nmessages proclaiming incredibly high density; and considering our very\r\nlimited opportunities for detecting this condition, there can be little\r\ndoubt that these ‘white dwarfs’, as they are called, are comparatively\r\nabundant in the stellar universe.\r\n\r\nBut we do not want to trust entirely to one clue lest it prove false\r\nin some unsuspected way. Therefore in 1924 Professor Adams set to\r\nwork again to apply to the message a test which ought to be crucial.\r\nEinstein’s theory of gravitation indicates that all the lines of the\r\nspectrum of a star will be slightly displaced towards the red end of\r\nthe spectrum as compared with the corresponding terrestrial lines. On\r\nthe sun the effect is almost too small to be detected having regard to\r\nthe many causes of slight shift which have to be disentangled. To me\r\npersonally Einstein’s theory gives much stronger assurance of the real\r\nexistence of the effect than does the observational evidence available.\r\nStill it is a striking fact that those who have made the investigation\r\nare now unanimous in their judgement that the effect really occurs on\r\nthe sun, although some of them at first thought that they had evidence\r\nagainst it. Hitherto Einstein’s theory has been chiefly regarded by\r\nthe practical astronomer as something he is asked to test; but now the\r\ntheory has a chance to show its mettle by helping us to test something\r\nmuch more doubtful than itself. The Einstein effect is proportional to\r\nthe mass divided by the radius of the star; and since the radius of the\r\nCompanion of Sirius is very small (if the message is right) the effect\r\nwill be very large. It should in fact be thirty times as large as on\r\nthe sun. That lifts it much above all the secondary causes of shift of\r\nthe lines which made the test on the sun so uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe observation is very difficult because the Companion of Sirius\r\nis faint for work of this kind, and scattered light from its\r\noverpoweringly brilliant neighbour causes much trouble. However, after\r\na year’s effort Professor Adams made satisfactory measurements, and he\r\nfound a large shift as predicted. Expressing the results in the usual\r\nunit of kilometres per second, the mean of his measurements came to 19,\r\nwhilst the predicted shift was 20.\r\n\r\nProfessor Adams has thus killed two birds with one stone. He has\r\ncarried out a new test of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, and\r\nhe has shown that matter at least 2,000 times denser than platinum is\r\nnot only possible but actually exists in the stellar universe.[13]\r\nThis is the best confirmation we could have for our view that the sun\r\nwith a density 1½ times that of water is still very far indeed from\r\nthe maximum density of stellar matter; and it is therefore entirely\r\nreasonable that we should find it behaving like a perfect gas.\r\n\r\nI have said that the observation was exceedingly difficult. However\r\nexperienced the observer, I do not think we ought to put implicit trust\r\nin a result which strains his skill to the utmost until it has been\r\nverified by others working independently. Therefore you should for the\r\npresent make the usual reservations in accepting these conclusions.\r\nBut science is not just a catalogue of ascertained facts about the\r\nuniverse; it is a mode of progress, sometimes tortuous, sometimes\r\nuncertain. And our interest in science is not merely a desire to hear\r\nthe latest facts added to the collection; we like to discuss our hopes\r\nand fears, probabilities and expectations. I have told the detective\r\nstory so far as it has yet unrolled itself. I do not know whether we\r\nhave reached the last chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Unknown Atoms and Interpretation of Spectra_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that this matter of enormous density is\r\nnot supposed to be any strange substance--a new chemical element\r\nor elements. It is just ordinary matter smashed about by the high\r\ntemperature and so capable of being packed more tightly--just as more\r\npeople could be squeezed into a room if a few bones were broken. It\r\nis one of the features of astronomical physics that it shows us the\r\n_ordinary_ elements of the earth in an _extraordinary_\r\nstate--smashed or ionized to a degree that has either not been\r\nreproduced or has been reproduced with great difficulty in the\r\nlaboratory. It is not only in the inaccessible interior of the star\r\nthat we find matter in a state outside terrestrial experience.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of the Ring Nebula in Lyra (Fig. 8).[14] It is taken\r\nthrough a prism so that we see not one ring but a number of rings\r\ncorresponding to different lines of the spectrum and representing the\r\ndifferent kinds of atoms which are at work producing the light of the\r\nnebula. The smallest ring, which is rather faint (marked by an arrow),\r\nconsists of light produced by the helium atoms in the nebula--not\r\nordinary helium but smashed helium atoms. It was one of the great\r\nlaboratory achievements of recent times when Professor A. Fowler in\r\n1912 succeeded in battering helium atoms in a vacuum tube sufficiently\r\nto give this kind of light, already well known in the stars. Two other\r\nrings are due to hydrogen. With these three exceptions none of the\r\nrings have yet been imitated in the laboratory. For instance, we do not\r\nknow what elements are producing the two brightest rings on the extreme\r\nright and left respectively.\r\n\r\nWe are sometimes asked whether any new elements show themselves in\r\nthe stars which are not present or are not yet discovered on the\r\nearth. We can give fairly confidently the answer No. That, however,\r\nis not because everything seen in the stars has been identified with\r\nknown terrestrial elements. The answer is in fact given not by the\r\nastronomer but by the physicist. The latter has been able to make out\r\nthe orderly scheme of the elements; and it transpires that there are\r\nno gaps left for fresh elements until we come to elements of very high\r\natomic weight, which would not be likely to rise into the atmosphere of\r\na star and show themselves in astronomical observation. Every element\r\ncarries a number, starting with hydrogen which is No. 1, and going up\r\nto uranium which is No. 92.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. THE RING NEBULA IN LYRA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. HYDROGEN--THE BALMER SERIES]\r\n\r\nAnd what is more, the element carries its number-plate so conspicuously\r\nthat a physicist is able to read it. He can, for instance, see that\r\niron is No. 26 without having to count up how many known elements\r\nprecede it. The elements have been called over by their numbers, and up\r\nto No. 84 they have all answered ‘Present’.[15]\r\n\r\nThe element helium (No. 2) was first discovered by Lockyer in the\r\nsun, and not until many years later was it found on the earth.\r\nAstrophysicists are not likely to repeat this achievement; they cannot\r\ndiscover new elements if there aren’t any. The unknown source of the\r\ntwo rings close together on the right of the photograph (a bright ring\r\nand a fainter ring) has been called _nebulium_. But nebulium is\r\nnot a new element. It is some quite familiar element which we cannot\r\nidentify because it has lost several of its electrons. An atom which\r\nhas lost an electron is like a friend who has shaved off his moustache;\r\nhis old acquaintances do not recognize him. We shall recognize nebulium\r\nsome day. The theoretical physicists are at work trying to find laws\r\nwhich will determine exactly the kind of light given off by atoms in\r\nvarious stages of mutilation--so that it will be purely a matter of\r\ncalculation to infer the atom from the light it emits. The experimental\r\nphysicists are at work trying more and more powerful means of battering\r\natoms, so that one day a terrestrial atom will be stimulated to give\r\nnebulium light. It is a great race; and I do not know which side to\r\nback. The astronomer cannot do much to help the solution of the problem\r\nhe has set. I believe that if he would measure with the greatest care\r\nthe ratio of intensity of the two nebulium lines he would give the\r\nphysicists a useful hint. He also provides another clue—though it is\r\ndifficult to make anything of it--namely, the different sizes of the\r\nrings in the photograph, showing a difference in the distribution of\r\nthe emitting atoms. Evidently nebulium has a fondness for the outer\r\nparts of the nebula and helium for the centre; but it is not clear what\r\ninference should be drawn from this difference in their habits.\r\n\r\nThe atoms of different elements, and atoms of the same element in\r\ndifferent states of ionization, all have distinctive sets of lines\r\nwhich are shown when the light is examined through a spectroscope.\r\nUnder certain conditions (as in the nebulae) these appear as bright\r\nlines; but more often they are imprinted as dark lines on a continuous\r\nbackground. In either case the lines enable us to identify the element,\r\nunless they happen to belong to an atom in a state of which we have\r\nhad no terrestrial experience. The rash prophecy that knowledge of the\r\ncomposition of the heavenly bodies must be for ever beyond our reach\r\nhas long been disproved; and the familiar elements, hydrogen, carbon,\r\ncalcium, titanium, iron, and many others, can be recognized in the most\r\ndistant parts of the universe. The thrill of this early discovery has\r\nnow passed. But meanwhile stellar spectroscopy has greatly extended its\r\nscope; it is no longer chemical analysis, but physical analysis. When\r\nwe meet an old acquaintance there is first the stage of recognition;\r\nthe next question is ‘How are you?’ After recognizing the stellar\r\natom we put this question, and the atom answers, ‘Quite sound’ or\r\n‘Badly smashed’, as the case may be. Its answer conveys information\r\nas to its environment--the severity of the treatment to which it is\r\nbeing subjected--and hence leads to a knowledge of the conditions of\r\ntemperature and pressure in the object observed.\r\n\r\nSurveying the series of stars from the coolest to the hottest, we can\r\ntrace how the calcium atoms are at first whole, then singly ionized,\r\nthen doubly ionized--a sign that the battering becomes more severe as\r\nthe heat becomes more intense. (The last stage is indicated by the\r\ndisappearance of all visible signs of calcium, because the ion with two\r\nelectrons missing has no lines in the observable part of the spectrum.)\r\nThe progressive change of other elements is shown in a similar way. A\r\ngreat advance in this study was made in 1920 by Professor M. N. Saha,\r\nwho first applied the quantitative physical laws which determine the\r\ndegree of ionization at any given temperature and pressure. He thereby\r\nstruck out a new line in astrophysical research which has been widely\r\ndeveloped. Thus, if we note the place in the stellar sequence where\r\ncomplete calcium atoms give place to atoms with one electron missing,\r\nthe physical theory is able to state the corresponding temperature or\r\npressure.[16] Saha’s methods have been improved by R. H. Fowler and\r\nE. A. Milne. One important application was to determine the surface\r\ntemperatures of the hottest types of stars (12,000°—25,000°), since\r\nalternative methods available for cooler stars are not satisfactory\r\nat these high temperatures. Another rather striking result was the\r\ndiscovery that the pressure in the star (at the level surveyed by the\r\nspectroscope) is only ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀th of an atmosphere; previously it had\r\nbeen assumed on no very definite evidence to be about the same as that\r\nof our own atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe commonly use the method of spectrum analysis when we wish to\r\ndetermine which elements are present in a given mineral on the earth.\r\nIt is equally trustworthy in examining the stars since it can make no\r\ndifference whether the light we are studying comes from a body close\r\nat hand or has travelled to us for hundreds of years across space. But\r\none limitation in stellar work must always be remembered. When the\r\nchemist is looking, say, for nitrogen in his mineral, he takes care to\r\nprovide the conditions which according to his experience are necessary\r\nfor the nitrogen spectrum to show itself. But in the stars we have\r\nto take the conditions as we find them. If nitrogen does not appear,\r\nthat is no proof that nitrogen is absent; it is much more likely that\r\nthe stellar atmosphere does not hit off the right conditions for the\r\ntest. In the spectrum of Sirius the lines of hydrogen are exceedingly\r\nprominent and overwhelm everything else. We do not infer that Sirius\r\nis composed mainly of hydrogen; we infer instead that its surface is\r\nat a temperature near 10,000°, because it can be calculated that that\r\nis a temperature most favourable for a great development of these\r\nhydrogen lines. In the sun the most prominent spectrum is iron. We do\r\nnot infer that the sun is unusually rich in iron; we infer that it\r\nis at a comparatively low temperature near 6,000° favourable for the\r\nproduction of the iron spectrum. At one time it was thought that the\r\nprominence of hydrogen in Sirius and of metallic elements in the sun\r\nindicated an evolution of the elements, hydrogen turning into heavier\r\nelements as the star cools from the Sirian to the solar stage. There is\r\nno ground for interpreting the observations in that way; the fading of\r\nthe hydrogen spectrum and the increase of the iron spectrum would occur\r\nin any case as the result of the fall of temperature; and similar\r\nspurious appearances of evolution of elements can be arranged in the\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nIt is rather probable that the chemical elements have much the same\r\nrelative abundance in the stars that they have on the earth. All the\r\nevidence is consistent with this view; and for a few of the commoner\r\nelements there is some positive confirmation. But we are limited to the\r\noutside of the star as we are limited to the outside of the earth in\r\ncomputing the abundance of the elements, so that this very provisional\r\nconclusion should not be pressed unduly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Spectral Series_\r\n\r\n\r\nTo illustrate further this kind of deduction, let us consider the\r\nspectrum shown in Fig. 9 and see what may be learnt from it. With a\r\nlittle trouble we can disentangle a beautifully regular series of\r\nbright lines. The marks above will assist you to pick out the first few\r\nlines of the series from the numerous other spectra mixed up with it.\r\nNoticing the diminishing spacing from right to left, you will be able\r\nto see that the series continues to the left for at least fifteen lines\r\nbeyond the last one marked, the lines ultimately drawing close together\r\nand forming a ‘head’ to the series. This is the famous Balmer Series of\r\nhydrogen, and having recognized it we identify hydrogen as one of the\r\nelements present in the source of the light. But that is only the first\r\nstep, and we can proceed to further inferences.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom teaches us that each line\r\nof the series is emitted by an atom in a different state. These ‘states\r\nof excitation’ can be numbered consecutively, starting from the normal\r\nstate of the hydrogen atom as No. 1. The light emitted in the first\r\nfew states comes into the part of the spectrum not reproduced here, and\r\nthe first line in our picture corresponds to state No. 8. Counting to\r\nthe left from this you will recognize the successive lines without much\r\ndifficulty up to state No. 30. Now the successive states correspond to\r\nmore and more swollen atoms, that is to say, the planet electron[17]\r\nmakes a wider and wider circuit. The radius (or more strictly the\r\nsemi-axis) of its orbit is proportional to the square of the number of\r\nthe state, so that the orbit for state No. 30 is 900 times larger than\r\nthe orbit for the normal atom No. 1. The diameter of the orbit in No.\r\n30 is approximately a ten-thousandth of a millimetre. One inference can\r\nbe drawn immediately--the spectrum shown in Fig. 9 was not produced in\r\nany terrestrial laboratory. In the highest vacuum that can be used in\r\nterrestrial spectroscopy the atoms are still too crowded to leave room\r\nfor an orbit so large as this. The source must be matter so tenuous\r\nthat there is vacant space for the electron to make this wide circuit\r\nwithout colliding with or suffering interference from other atoms.\r\nWithout entering into further detail we can conclude that Fig. 9 is a\r\nspectrum of matter more rarefied than the highest vacuum known on the\r\nearth.[18]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that, whereas throughout most of the\r\npicture the lines are shown on a dark background, at the extreme left\r\nthe background is bright; the change occurs just at the point where the\r\nBalmer Series comes to an end. This background of light is also due to\r\nhydrogen and it is caused in the following way. The swollen atoms in\r\nstate No. 30 or thereabouts are perilously near the bursting-point,\r\nso it is natural that along with them there should be atoms which\r\nhave overstepped the limit and burst. They have lost their planet\r\nelectrons and are occupied in catching new ones. Just as energy is\r\nrequired in order to wrench away an electron from an atom, so there\r\nwill be superfluous energy to be got rid of when the atom tames a wild\r\nelectron. This superfluous energy is radiated and forms the bright\r\nbackground referred to. Without entering into technicalities of the\r\ntheory, we can see that it is appropriate that this light from the\r\nburst atoms should appear in the spectrum immediately beyond the lines\r\nfrom the most swollen atoms, since bursting is a sequel to overswelling.\r\n\r\nWhilst you have this photograph of the Balmer Series before you I\r\nmay take the opportunity of recounting the history of another famous\r\nseries. In some of the hottest stars a related series of lines known\r\nas the Pickering Series was discovered in 1896. This is spaced on\r\nprecisely the same regular plan, but the lines fall half way between\r\nthe lines of the Balmer Series--not exactly half way because of the\r\ngradually diminishing intervals from right to left, but just where\r\none would naturally interpolate lines in order to double their number\r\nwhilst keeping the spacing regular. Unlike the Balmer Series, the\r\nPickering Series had never been produced in any laboratory. What\r\nelement was causing it? The answer seemed obvious; surely these two\r\nrelated series, one fitting half way between the other, must belong to\r\ndifferent modes of vibration of the same atom, hydrogen. That seemed to\r\nbe the only possible answer at the time; but we have learned more about\r\natoms since then. We may fairly argue that the ideal simplicity of\r\nthese two series indicates that they are produced by an atomic system\r\nof the simplest possible type, viz. an atom with one planet electron;\r\nbut it must be remembered that this condition only tells us how the\r\natom is _clothed_, not what the atom is. The helium atom (or, for\r\nthat matter, the uranium atom) can on occasion masquerade in the scanty\r\nattire of the hydrogen atom. Normal helium has two planet electrons;\r\nbut if one of these is lost, it becomes hydrogen-like and copies the\r\nsimple hydrogen system on a different scale. It is significant that the\r\nPickering Series appears only in the very hottest stars--in conditions\r\nlikely to cause loss of an electron. The difference between hydrogen\r\nand hydrogen-like helium is firstly the difference of atomic weight;\r\nthe helium nucleus is four times as massive. But this scarcely affects\r\nthe spectrum because both nuclei are so massive that they remain almost\r\nunshaken by the dancing electron. Secondly, the helium nucleus has\r\na double electric charge; this is equivalent to substituting in the\r\nvibrating system a controlling spring of twice the strength. What can\r\nbe more natural than that the doubled force of the spring should double\r\nthe number of lines in the series without otherwise altering its plan?\r\nIn this way Professor Bohr discovered the real origin of the Pickering\r\nSeries; it is due to ionized helium, not to hydrogen.[19]\r\n\r\nThe heavy nucleus, whether of hydrogen or helium, remains almost\r\nunshaken by the atomic vibration--almost, but not quite. At a later\r\ndate Professor A. Fowler succeeded in reproducing the Pickering\r\nSeries in the laboratory and was able to measure the lines with much\r\ngreater accuracy than could be achieved in stellar spectroscopy; he\r\nwas then able to show from his measures that the nucleus is not quite\r\nirresponsive. It was a delicate double-star problem transferred to the\r\ninterior of the atom; or perhaps a closer analogy would be the mutual\r\ninfluence of the sun and Jupiter, because Jupiter, having a thousandth\r\nof the mass of the sun, disturbs it to about the same extent that the\r\nlight electron disturbs the hydrogen nucleus. Ionized helium is a\r\nfaithful copy of the hydrogen atom (on the altered scale) in everything\r\nexcept the ‘shake’; the shake is less than in hydrogen because the\r\nhelium nucleus is still more massive and rock-like. The difference\r\nof shake throws the Pickering Series of helium and the Balmer Series\r\nof hydrogen slightly out of step with respect to one another; and by\r\nmeasuring this misfit Professor Fowler was able to make a very accurate\r\ndetermination of the shake and therefore of the mass of the electron.\r\nIn this way the mass of the electron is found to be ¹⁄₁₈₄₄th of the\r\nmass of the hydrogen nucleus; this agrees well with the mass found\r\nby other methods, and the determination is probably not inferior in\r\naccuracy to any of them.\r\n\r\nAnd so the clue first picked up in stars 300 light years away, followed\r\nin turn by the theoretical and the experimental physicist, leads in the\r\nend to the smallest of all things known.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _The Cloud in Space_\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving already considered the densest matter in the universe, we now\r\nturn to consider the rarest.\r\n\r\nIn spite of great improvements in the art of exhausting vessels we\r\nare still a long way from producing a _real_ vacuum. The atoms\r\nin a vacuum tube before it is exhausted muster a formidable number\r\ncontaining about twenty digits. High exhaustion means knocking off\r\nfive or six noughts at the end of that number; and the most strenuous\r\nefforts to knock off one more nought seem ludicrously ineffective--a\r\nmere nibbling at the huge number that must remain.\r\n\r\nSome of the stars are extremely rarefied. Betelgeuse, for example, has\r\na density about a thousandth that of air. We should call it a vacuum\r\nwere it not contrasted with the much greater vacuosity of surrounding\r\nspace. Nowadays physicists have no difficulty in producing a better\r\nvacuum than Betelgeuse; but in earlier times this star would have been\r\nregarded as a very creditable attempt at a vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe outer parts of a star, and especially the light appendages such as\r\nthe solar chromosphere and corona, reach much lower densities. Also the\r\ngaseous nebulae are, as their appearance suggests, extremely tenuous.\r\nWhen there is space enough to put a pin’s head between adjacent atoms\r\nwe can begin to talk about a ‘real vacuum.’ At the centre of the Orion\r\nnebula that degree of rarefaction is probably reached and surpassed.\r\n\r\nA nebula has no definite boundary and the density gradually fades off.\r\nThere is reason to think that the fading off becomes slow at great\r\ndistances. Before we pass entirely out of the sphere of one nebula we\r\nenter the sphere of another, so that there is always some residual\r\ndensity in interstellar space.\r\n\r\nI believe that, reasoning from the tailing off of the nebulae, we are\r\nin a position to make an estimate of the amount of matter remaining\r\nunaggregated in space. An ordinary region where there is no observable\r\nnebulosity is the highest vacuum existing--within the limits of the\r\nstellar system at least--but there still remains about _one atom in\r\nevery cubic inch_. It depends on our point of view whether we regard\r\nthis as an amazing fullness or an amazing emptiness of space. Perhaps\r\nit is the fullness that impresses us most. The atom can find no place\r\nof real solitude within the system of the stars; wherever it goes it\r\ncan nod to a colleague not more than an inch away.\r\n\r\nLet us approach the same subject from a different angle.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Story of Algol’ I referred to the way in which we measure the\r\nvelocity of rotation of the sun. We point the spectroscope first on one\r\nlimb of the sun and then on the other. Taking any one of the dark lines\r\nof the spectrum, we find that it has shifted a little between the two\r\nobservations. This tells us that the material which imprinted the line\r\nwas moving towards or away from us with different velocities in the two\r\nobservations. That is what we expected to find; the rotation of the\r\nsun makes solar material move towards us on one side of the disk and\r\naway from us on the other side. But there are a few dark lines which\r\ndo not show this change. They are in just the same position whether\r\nwe observe them on the east or on the west of the sun. Clearly these\r\ncannot originate on the sun. They have been imprinted on the light\r\nafter it left the sun and before it reached our telescope. We have\r\nthus discovered a medium occurring somewhere between the sun and our\r\ntelescope; and as some of the lines are recognized as belonging to\r\noxygen, we can infer that it is a medium containing oxygen.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the beginning of a great discovery, but it ends in a\r\nbathos. It happens that we were already aware of a medium containing\r\noxygen lying somewhere between our telescope and the sun. It is a\r\nmedium essential to our existence. The terrestrial atmosphere is\r\nresponsible for the ‘fixed’ lines seen in the sun’s spectrum.\r\n\r\nJust as the spectroscope can tell us that the sun is turning round (a\r\nfact already familiar to us from watching the surface markings), so\r\nit can tell us that certain stars are wandering round an orbit, and\r\ntherefore are under the influence of a second star which may or may\r\nnot be visible itself. But here again we sometimes find ‘fixed’ lines\r\nwhich do not change with the others. Therefore somewhere between the\r\nstar and the telescope there exists a stationary medium which imprints\r\nthese lines on the light. This time it is not the earth’s atmosphere.\r\nThe lines belong to two elements, calcium and sodium, neither of which\r\noccur in the atmosphere. Moreover, the calcium is in a smashed state,\r\nhaving lost one of its electrons, and the conditions in our atmosphere\r\nare not such as would cause this loss. There seems to be no doubt that\r\nthe medium containing the sodium and ionized calcium--and no doubt\r\nmany other elements which do not show themselves--is separate from the\r\nearth and the star. It is the ‘fullness’ of interstellar space already\r\nmentioned. Light has to pass one atom per cubic inch all the way from\r\nthe star to the earth, and it will pass quite enough atoms during its\r\njourney of many hundred billion miles to imprint these dark lines on\r\nits spectrum.\r\n\r\nAt first there was a rival interpretation. It was thought that the\r\nlines were produced in a cloud attached to the star--forming a kind\r\nof aureole round it. The two components travel in orbits round each\r\nother, but their orbital motion need not disturb a diffuse medium\r\nfilling and surrounding the combined system. This was a very reasonable\r\nsuggestion, but it could be put to the test. The test was again\r\n_velocity_. Although either component can move periodically to\r\nand fro within the surrounding cloud of calcium and sodium, it is\r\nclear that its average approach to us or recession from us taken over\r\na long time must agree with that of the calcium and sodium if the star\r\nis not to leave its halo behind. Professor Plaskett with the 72-inch\r\nreflector at the Dominion Observatory in British Columbia carried out\r\nthis test. He found that the secular or average rate of approach of\r\nthe star[20] was in general quite different from the rate shown by the\r\nfixed calcium or sodium lines. Clearly the material responsible for\r\nthe fixed lines could not be an appendage of the star since it was not\r\nkeeping pace with it. Plaskett went farther and showed that whereas\r\nthe stars themselves had all sorts of individual velocities, the\r\nmaterial of the fixed lines had the same or nearly the same velocity\r\nin all parts of the sky, as though it were one continuous medium\r\nthroughout interstellar space. I think there can be no doubt that this\r\nresearch demonstrates the existence of a cosmic cloud pervading the\r\nstellar system. The fullness of interstellar space becomes a fact of\r\nobservation and no longer a theoretical conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe system of the stars is floating in an ocean--not merely an ocean\r\nof space, not merely an ocean of ether, but an ocean that is so far\r\nmaterial that one atom or thereabouts occurs in each cubic inch. It is\r\na placid ocean without much relative motion; currents probably exist,\r\nbut they are of a minor character and do not attain the high speeds\r\ncommonly possessed by the stars.\r\n\r\nMany points of interest arise, but I will only touch on one or two.\r\nWhy are the calcium atoms ionized? In the calm of interstellar space\r\nwe seem to have passed away from the turmoil which smashed the calcium\r\natoms in the interior of a star; so at first it seems difficult to\r\nunderstand why the atoms in the cloud should not be complete. However,\r\neven in the depths of space the breaking-up of the atom continues;\r\nbecause there is always starlight passing across space, and some of\r\nthe light-waves are quite powerful enough to wrench a first or second\r\nelectron away from the calcium atom. It is one of the most curious\r\ndiscoveries of modern physics that when a light-wave is attenuated\r\nby spreading, what it really suffers from is _laziness_ rather\r\nthan actual loss of power. What is weakened is not the power but the\r\nprobability that it will display the power. A light-wave capable of\r\nbursting an atom still retains the power when it is attenuated a\r\nmillion-fold by spreading; only it is a million times more sparing in\r\nthe exercise of the power. To put it another way, an atom exposed to\r\nthe attenuated waves will on the average have to wait a million times\r\nlonger before a wave chooses to explode it; but the explosion when it\r\ndoes occur will be of precisely the same strength however great the\r\nattenuation. This is entirely unlike the behaviour of water-waves; a\r\nwave which is at first strong enough to capsize a boat will, after\r\nspreading, become too weak. It is more like machine-gun fire which is\r\nmore likely to miss a given object at greater distance but is equally\r\ndestructive if it hits. The property here referred to (the quantum\r\nproperty) is the deepest mystery of light.\r\n\r\nThus in interstellar space electrons are still being torn from calcium\r\natoms, only very infrequently. The other side of the question is the\r\nrate of repair, and in this connexion the low density of the cosmic\r\ncloud is the deciding factor. The atom has so few opportunities for\r\nrepair. Roving through space the atom meets an electron only about\r\nonce a month, and it by no means follows that it will capture the first\r\none it meets. Consequently very infrequent smashing will suffice to\r\nkeep the majority of the atoms ionized. The smashed state of the atoms\r\ninside a star can be compared to the dilapidation of a house visited by\r\na tornado; the smashed state in interstellar space is a dilapidation\r\ndue to ordinary wear and tear coupled with excessive slackness in\r\nmaking repairs.\r\n\r\nA calculation indicates that most of the calcium atoms in interstellar\r\nspace have lost two electrons; these atoms do not interfere with the\r\nlight and give no visible spectrum. The ‘fixed lines’ are produced by\r\natoms temporarily in a better state of repair with only one electron\r\nmissing; they cannot amount at any moment to more than one-thousandth\r\nof the whole number, but even so they will be sufficiently numerous to\r\nproduce the observed absorption.\r\n\r\nWe generally think of interstellar space as excessively cold. It is\r\nquite true that any thermometer placed there would show a temperature\r\nonly about 3° above the absolute zero--if it were capable of\r\nregistering so low a reading. Compact matter such as a thermometer, or\r\neven matter which from the ordinary standpoint is regarded as highly\r\ndiffuse, falls to this low temperature. But the rule does not apply\r\nto matter as rarefied as the interstellar cloud. Its temperature is\r\ngoverned by other considerations, and it will probably be not much\r\nbelow the surface-temperature of the hottest stars, say 15,000°.\r\nInterstellar space is at the same time excessively cold and decidedly\r\nhot.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Sun’s Chromosphere_\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again we shift the scene, and now we are back in the outer parts\r\nof the sun. Fig. 10[22] shows one of the huge prominence flames which\r\nfrom time to time shoot out of the sun. The flame in this picture was\r\nabout 120,000 miles high. It went through great changes of form and\r\ndisappeared in not much more than twenty-four hours. This was rather an\r\nexceptional specimen. Smaller flames occur commonly enough; it seems\r\nthat the curious black marks in Fig. 1, often looking like rifts,\r\nare really prominences seen in projection against the still brighter\r\nbackground of the sun. The flames consist of calcium, hydrogen, and\r\nseveral other elements.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned not so much with the prominences as with the layer\r\nfrom which they spring. The ordinary atmosphere of the sun terminates\r\nrather abruptly, but above it there is a deep though very rarefied\r\nlayer called the chromosphere consisting of a few selected elements\r\nwhich are able to float--float, not on the top of the sun’s atmosphere,\r\nbut on the _sunbeams_. The art of riding a sunbeam is evidently\r\nrather difficult, because only a few of the elements have the necessary\r\nskill. The most expert is calcium. The light and nimble hydrogen atom\r\nis fairly good at it, but the ponderous calcium atom does it best.\r\n\r\nThe layer of calcium suspended on the sunlight is at least 5,000 miles\r\nthick. We can observe it best when the main part of the sun is hidden\r\nby the moon in an eclipse; but the spectroheliograph enables us to\r\nstudy it to some extent without an eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. SOLAR PROMINENCE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. STAR CLUSTER ω CENTAURI]\r\n\r\nOn the whole it is steady and quiescent, although, as the prominence\r\nflames show, it is liable to be blown sky-high by violent outbursts.\r\nThe conclusions about the calcium chromosphere that I am going to\r\ndescribe rest on a series of remarkable researches by Professor Milne.\r\n\r\nHow does an atom float on a sunbeam? The possibility depends on the\r\npressure of light to which we have already referred (p. 26). The\r\nsunlight travelling outwards carries a certain outward momentum; if the\r\natom absorbs the light it absorbs also the momentum and so receives a\r\ntiny impulse outwards. This impulse enables it to recover the ground it\r\nwas losing in falling towards the sun. The atoms in the chromosphere\r\nare kept floating above the sun like tiny shuttlecocks, dropping a\r\nlittle and then ascending again from the impulse of the light. Only\r\nthose atoms which can absorb large quantities of sunlight in proportion\r\nto their weight will be able to float successfully. We must look rather\r\nclosely into the mechanism of absorption of the calcium atom if we are\r\nto see why it excels the other elements.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary calcium atom has two rather loose electrons in its\r\nattendant system; the chemists express this by saying that it is a\r\ndivalent element, the two loose electrons being especially important in\r\ndetermining the chemical behaviour. Each of these electrons possesses\r\na mechanism for absorbing light. But under the conditions prevailing\r\nin the chromosphere one of the electrons is broken away, and the\r\ncalcium atoms are in the same smashed state that gives rise to the\r\n‘fixed lines’ in the interstellar cloud. The chromospheric calcium\r\nthus supports itself on what sunlight it can gather in with the one\r\nloose electron remaining. To part with this would be fatal; the atom\r\nwould no longer be able to absorb sunlight, and would drop like a\r\nstone. It is true that after two electrons are lost there are still\r\neighteen remaining; but these are held so tightly that sunlight has no\r\neffect on them and they can only absorb shorter waves which the sun\r\ndoes not radiate in any quantity. The atom therefore could only save\r\nitself if it restored its main absorbing mechanism by picking up a\r\npassing electron; it has little chance of catching one in the rarefied\r\nchromosphere, so it would probably fall all the way to the sun’s\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which light can be absorbed. In one the atom\r\nabsorbs so greedily that it bursts, and the electron scurries off with\r\nthe surplus energy. That is the process of ionization which was shown\r\nin Fig. 5. Clearly this cannot be the process of absorption in the\r\nchromosphere because, as we have seen, the atom cannot afford to lose\r\nthe electron. In the other method of absorption the atom is not quite\r\nso greedy. It does not burst, but it swells visibly. To accommodate the\r\nextra energy the electron is tossed up into a higher orbit. This method\r\nis called excitation (cf. p. 59). After remaining in the excited orbit\r\nfor a little while the electron comes down again spontaneously. The\r\nprocess has to be repeated 20,000 times a second in order to keep the\r\natom balanced in the chromosphere.\r\n\r\nThe point we are leading up to is, Why should calcium be able to float\r\nbetter than other elements? It has always seemed odd that a rather\r\nheavy element (No. 20 in order of atomic weight) should be found in\r\nthese uppermost regions where one would expect only the lightest atoms.\r\nWe see now that the special skill demanded is to be able to toss up an\r\nelectron 20,000 times a second without ever making the fatal blunder\r\nof dropping it. That is not easy even for an atom. Calcium[23] scores\r\nbecause it possesses a possible orbit of excitation only a little way\r\nabove the normal orbit so that it can juggle the electron between\r\nthese two orbits without serious risk. With most other elements the\r\nfirst available orbit is relatively much higher; the energy required\r\nto reach this orbit is not so very much less than the energy required\r\nto detach the electron altogether; so that we cannot very well have a\r\ncontinuous source of light capable of causing the orbit-jumps without\r\nsometimes overdoing it and causing loss of the electron. It is the\r\nwide difference between the energy of excitation and the energy of\r\nionization of calcium which is so favourable; the sun is very rich in\r\nether-waves capable of causing the first, and is almost lacking in\r\nether-waves capable of causing the second.\r\n\r\nThe average time occupied by each performance is ¹⁄₂₀₀₀₀th of a second.\r\nThis is divided into two periods. There is a period during which the\r\natom is patiently waiting for a light-wave to run into it and throw\r\nup the electron. There is another period during which the electron\r\nrevolves steadily in the higher orbit before deciding to come down\r\nagain. Professor Milne has shown how to calculate from observations of\r\nthe chromosphere the durations of both these periods. The first period\r\nof waiting depends on the strength of the sun’s radiation. But we focus\r\nattention especially on the second period, which is more interesting\r\nbecause it is a definite property of the calcium atom, having nothing\r\nto do with local circumstances. Although we measure it for ions in\r\nthe sun’s chromosphere, the same result must apply to calcium ions\r\nanywhere. Milne’s result is that an electron tossed into the higher\r\norbit remains there for an average time of a hundred-millionth of a\r\nsecond before it spontaneously drops back again. I may add that during\r\nthis brief time it makes something like a million revolutions in the\r\nupper orbit.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a piece of information that you were not particularly\r\nburning to know. I do not think it can be called interesting except to\r\nthose who make a hobby of atoms. But it does seem to me interesting\r\nthat we should have to turn a telescope and spectroscope on the sun to\r\nfind out this homely property of a substance which we handle daily. It\r\nis a kind of measurement of immense importance in physics. The theory\r\nof these atomic jumps comes under the quantum theory which is still\r\nthe greatest puzzle of physical science; and it is greatly in need of\r\nguidance from observation on just such a matter as this. We can imagine\r\nwhat a sensation would be caused if, after a million revolutions round\r\nthe sun, a planet made a jump of this kind. How eagerly we should try\r\nto determine the average interval at which such jumps occurred! The\r\natom is rather like a solar system, and it is not the less interesting\r\nbecause it is on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nThere is no prospect at present of measuring the time of relaxation\r\nof the excited calcium atom in a different way. It has, however, been\r\nfound possible to determine the corresponding time for one or two other\r\nkinds of atoms by laboratory experiments. It is not necessary that\r\nthe time should be at all closely the same for different elements;\r\nbut laboratory measurements for hydrogen also give the period as a\r\nhundred-millionth of a second, so there is no fault to find with the\r\nastronomical determination for calcium.\r\n\r\nThe excitation of the calcium atom is performed by light of two\r\nparticular wave-lengths, and the atoms in the chromosphere support\r\nthemselves by robbing sunlight of these two constituents. It is true\r\nthat after a hundred-millionth of a second a relapse comes and the\r\natom has to disgorge what it has appropriated; but in re-emitting\r\nthe light it is as likely to send it inwards as outwards, so that\r\nthe _outflowing_ sunlight suffers more loss than it recovers.\r\nConsequently, when we view the sun through this mantle of calcium the\r\nspectrum shows gaps or dark lines at the two wave-lengths concerned.\r\nThese lines are denoted by the letters H and K. They are not entirely\r\nblack, and it is important to measure the residual light at the centre\r\nof the lines, because we know that it must have an intensity just\r\nstrong enough to keep calcium atoms floating under solar gravity; as\r\nsoon as the outflowing light is so weakened that it can support no\r\nmore atoms it can suffer no further depredations, and so it emerges\r\ninto outer space with this limiting intensity. The measurement gives\r\nnumerical data for working out the constants of the calcium atom\r\nincluding the time of relaxation mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe atoms at the top of the chromosphere rest on the weakened light\r\nwhich has passed through the screen below; the full sunlight would blow\r\nthem away. Milne has deduced a consequence which may perhaps have a\r\npractical application in the phenomena of explosion of ‘new stars’ or\r\nnovae, and in any case is curiously interesting. Owing to the Doppler\r\neffect a moving atom absorbs a rather different wave-length from a\r\nstationary atom; so that if for any cause an atom moves away from the\r\nsun it will support itself on light which is a little to one side of\r\nthe deepest absorption. This light, being more intense than that which\r\nprovided a balance, will make the atom recede faster. The atom’s own\r\nabsorption will thus gradually draw clear of the absorption of the\r\nscreen below. Speaking rather metaphorically, the atom is balanced\r\nprecariously on the summit of the absorption line and it is liable to\r\ntopple off into the full sunlight on one side. Apparently the speed\r\nof the atom should go on increasing until it has to climb an adjacent\r\nabsorption line (due perhaps to some other element); if the line is too\r\nintense to be surmounted the atom will stick part-way up, the velocity\r\nremaining fixed at a particular value. These later inferences may be\r\nrather far-fetched, but at any rate the argument indicates that there\r\nis likely to be an escape of calcium into outer space.\r\n\r\nBy Milne’s theory we can calculate the whole weight of the sun’s\r\ncalcium chromosphere. Its mass is about 300 million tons. One scarcely\r\nexpects to meet with such a trifling figure in astronomy. It is less\r\nthan the tonnage handled by our English railways each year. I think\r\nthat solar observers must feel rather hoaxed when they consider the\r\nlabour that they have been induced to spend on this airy nothing.\r\nBut science does not despise trifles. And astronomy can still be\r\ninstructive even when, for once in a way, it descends to commonplace\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Story of Betelgeuse_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story has not much to do with atoms, and scarcely comes under\r\nthe title of these lectures; but we have had occasion to allude to\r\nBetelgeuse as the famous example of a star of great size and low\r\ndensity, and its history is closely associated with some of the\r\ndevelopments that we are studying.\r\n\r\nNo star has a disk large enough to be seen with our present telescopes.\r\nWe can calculate that a lens or mirror of about 20 feet aperture would\r\nbe needed to show traces even of the largest star disk. Imagine for a\r\nmoment that we have constructed an instrument of this order of size.\r\nWhich would be the most hopeful star to try it on?\r\n\r\nPerhaps Sirius suggests itself first, since it is the brightest star in\r\nthe sky. But Sirius has a white-hot surface radiating very intensely,\r\nso that it is not necessary that it should have a wide expanse.\r\nEvidently we should prefer a star which, although bright, has its\r\nsurface in a feebly glowing condition; then the apparent brightness\r\nmust be due to large area. We need, then, a star which is both red\r\nand bright. Betelgeuse seems best to satisfy this condition. It is\r\nthe brighter of the two shoulder-stars of Orion--the only conspicuous\r\nred star in the constellation. There are one or two rivals, including\r\nAntares, which might possibly be preferred; but we cannot go far wrong\r\nin turning our new instrument on Betelgeuse in the hope of finding the\r\nlargest or nearly the largest star disk.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that I have paid no attention to the distances of these\r\nstars. It happens that distance is not relevant. It would be relevant\r\nif we were trying to find the star of greatest actual dimensions; but\r\nhere we are considering the star which presents the largest apparent\r\ndisk,[24] i.e. covers the largest area of the sky. If we were at twice\r\nour present distance from the sun, we should receive only one-quarter\r\nas much light; but the sun would look half its present size linearly,\r\nand its apparent area would be one-quarter. Thus the light per unit\r\narea of disk is unaltered by distance. Removing the sun to greater\r\nand greater distance its disk will appear smaller but glowing not\r\nless intensely, until it is so far away that the disk cannot be\r\ndiscriminated.\r\n\r\nBy spectroscopic examination we know that Betelgeuse has a surface\r\ntemperature about 3,000°. A temperature of 3,000° is not unattainable\r\nin the laboratory, and we know partly by experiment and partly by\r\ntheory what is the radiating power of a surface in this state. Thus it\r\nis not difficult to compute how large an area of the sky Betelgeuse\r\nmust cover in order that the area multiplied by the radiating power\r\nmay give the observed brightness of Betelgeuse. The area turns out to\r\nbe very small. The apparent size of Betelgeuse is that of a half-penny\r\nfifty miles away. Using a more scientific measure, the diameter of\r\nBetelgeuse predicted by this calculation is 0·051 of a second of arc.\r\n\r\nNo existing telescope can show so small a disk. Let us consider briefly\r\nhow a telescope forms an image--in particular how it reproduces that\r\ndetail and contrast of light and darkness which betrays that we are\r\nlooking at a disk or a double star and not a blur emanating from a\r\nsingle point. This optical performance is called resolving power; it is\r\nnot primarily a matter of magnification but of aperture, and the limit\r\nof resolution is determined by the size of aperture of the telescope.\r\n\r\nTo create a sharply defined image the telescope must not only\r\nbring light where there ought to be light, but it must also bring\r\ndarkness where there ought to be darkness. The latter task is the\r\nmore difficult. Light-waves tend to spread in all directions, and\r\nthe telescope cannot prevent individual wavelets from straying on to\r\nparts of the picture where they have no business. But it has this one\r\nremedy--for every trespassing wavelet it must send a second wavelet\r\nby a slightly longer or shorter route so as to arrive in a phase\r\nopposite to the first wavelet and cancel its effect. This is where the\r\nutility of a wide aperture arises--by affording a wider difference of\r\nroute of the individual wavelets, so that those from one part of the\r\naperture may be retarded relatively to and interfere with those from\r\nanother part. A small object-glass can furnish light; it takes a big\r\nobject-glass to furnish darkness in the picture.\r\n\r\nNow we may ask ourselves whether the ordinary circular aperture is\r\nnecessarily the most efficient for giving the wavelets the required\r\npath-differences. Any deviation from a symmetrical shape is likely to\r\nspoil the definition of the image--to produce wings and fringes. The\r\nimage will not so closely resemble the object viewed. But on the other\r\nhand we may be able to sharpen up the tell-tale features. It does\r\nnot matter how widely the image-pattern may differ from the object,\r\nprovided that we can read the significance of the pattern. If we cannot\r\nreproduce a star-disk, let us try whether we can reproduce something\r\ndistinctive of a star-disk.\r\n\r\nA little reflection shows that we ought to improve matters by blocking\r\nout the middle of the object-glass, and using only the extreme\r\nregions on one side or the other. For these regions the difference of\r\nlight-path of the waves is greatest, and they are the most efficient in\r\nfurnishing the dark contrast needed to outline the image properly.\r\n\r\nBut if the middle of the object-glass is not going to be used, why go\r\nto the expense of manufacturing it? We are led to the idea of using\r\ntwo widely separated apertures, each involving a comparatively small\r\nlens or mirror. We thus arrive at an instrument after the pattern of a\r\nrangefinder.\r\n\r\nThis instrument will not show us the disk of a star. If we look through\r\nit the main impression of the star image is very like what we should\r\nhave seen with either aperture singly--a ‘spurious disk’ surrounded by\r\ndiffraction rings. But looking attentively we see that this image is\r\ncrossed by dark and bright bands which are produced by interference\r\nbetween the light-waves coming from the two apertures. At the centre\r\nof the image the waves from the two apertures arrive crest on crest\r\nsince they have travelled symmetrically along equal paths; accordingly\r\nthere is a bright band. A very little to one side the asymmetry causes\r\nthe waves to arrive crest on trough, so that they cancel one another;\r\nhere there is a dark band. The width of the bands decreases as the\r\nseparation of the two apertures increases, and for any given separation\r\nthe actual width is easily calculated.\r\n\r\nEach point of the star’s disk is giving rise to a diffraction image\r\nwith a system of bands of this kind, but so long as the disk is small\r\ncompared with the finest detail of the diffraction image there is no\r\nappreciable blurring. If we continually increase the separation of the\r\ntwo apertures and so make the bands narrower, there comes a time when\r\nthe bright bands for one part of the disk are falling on the dark bands\r\nfor another part of the disk. The band system then becomes indistinct.\r\nIt is a matter of mathematical calculation to determine the resultant\r\neffect of summing the band systems for each point of the disk. It can\r\nbe shown that for a certain separation of the apertures the bands will\r\ndisappear altogether; and beyond this separation the system should\r\nreappear though not attaining its original sharpness. The complete\r\ndisappearance occurs when the diameter of the star-disk is equal to\r\n1⅕ times the width of the bands (from the centre of one bright band to\r\nthe next). As already stated, the bandwidth can be calculated from the\r\nknown separation of the apertures.\r\n\r\nThe observation consists in sliding apart the two apertures until the\r\nbands disappear. The diameter of the disk is inferred at once from\r\ntheir separation when the disappearance occurred. Although we measure\r\nthe size of the disk in this way we never _see_ the disk.\r\n\r\nWe can summarize the principle of the method in the following way. The\r\nimage of a point of light seen through a telescope is not a point but\r\na small diffraction pattern. Hence, if we look at an extended object,\r\nsay Mars, the diffraction pattern will blur the fine detail of the\r\nmarking on the planet. If, however, we are looking at a star which\r\nis almost a point, it is simpler to invert the idea; the object, not\r\nbeing an ideal point, will slightly blur the detail of the diffraction\r\npattern. We shall only perceive the blurring if the diffraction pattern\r\ncontains detail fine enough to suffer from it. Betelgeuse on account\r\nof its finite size must theoretically blur a diffraction pattern; but\r\nthe ordinary diffraction disk and rings produced with the largest\r\ntelescope are too coarse to show this. We create a diffraction image\r\nwith finer detail by using two apertures. Theoretically we can make the\r\ndetail as fine as we please by increasing the separation of the two\r\napertures. The method accordingly consists in widening the separation\r\nuntil the pattern becomes fine enough to be perceptibly blurred by\r\nBetelgeuse. For a smaller star-disk the same effect of blurring would\r\nnot be apparent until the detail had been made still finer by further\r\nseparation of the apertures.\r\n\r\nThis method was devised long ago by Professor Michelson, but it was\r\nonly in 1920 that he tried it on a large scale with a great 20-foot\r\nbeam across the 100-inch reflector at Mount Wilson Observatory. After\r\nmany attempts Pease and Anderson were able to show that the bright\r\nand dark bands for Betelgeuse disappeared when the apertures were\r\nseparated 10 feet. The deduced diameter is 0·045 a second of arc in\r\ngood enough agreement with the predicted value (p. 78). Only five or\r\nsix stars have disks large enough to be measured with this instrument.\r\nIt is understood that the construction of a 50-foot interferometer\r\nis contemplated; but even this will be insufficient for the great\r\nmajority of the stars. We are fairly confident that the method of\r\ncalculation first described gives the correct diameters of the stars,\r\nbut confirmation by Michelson’s more direct method of measurement is\r\nalways desirable.\r\n\r\nTo infer the actual size of the star from its apparent diameter, we\r\nmust know the distance. Betelgeuse is rather a remote star and its\r\ndistance cannot be measured very accurately, but the uncertainty will\r\nnot change the general order of magnitude of the results. The diameter\r\nis about 300 million miles. Betelgeuse is large enough to contain the\r\nwhole orbit of the earth inside it, perhaps even the orbit of Mars. Its\r\nvolume is about fifty million times the volume of the sun.\r\n\r\nThere is no direct way of learning the mass of Betelgeuse because\r\nit has no companion near it whose motion it might influence. We\r\ncan, however, deduce a mass from the mass-brightness relation in\r\nFig. 7. This gives the mass equal to 35 x sun. If the result is\r\nright, Betelgeuse is one of the most massive stars--but, of course,\r\nnot massive in proportion to its bulk. The mean density is about\r\none-millionth of the density of water, or not much more than\r\none-thousandth of the density of air.[25]\r\n\r\nThere is one way in which we might have inferred that Betelgeuse is\r\nless dense than the sun, even if we had had no grounds of theory or\r\nanalogy for estimating its mass. According to the modern theory of\r\ngravitation, a globe of the size of Betelgeuse and of the same mean\r\ndensity as the sun would have some remarkable properties:\r\n\r\nFirstly, owing to the great intensity of its gravitation, light would\r\nbe unable to escape; and any rays shot out would fall back again to the\r\nstar by their own weight.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Einstein shift (used to test the density of the Companion\r\nof Sirius) would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThirdly, mass produces a curvature of space, and in this case the\r\ncurvature would be so great that space would close up round the star,\r\nleaving us outside--that is to say, _nowhere_.\r\n\r\nExcept for the last consideration, it seems rather a pity that the\r\ndensity of Betelgeuse is so low.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is now well realized that the stars are a very important adjunct to\r\nthe physical laboratory--a sort of high-temperature annex where the\r\nbehaviour of matter can be studied under greatly extended conditions.\r\nBeing an astronomer, I naturally put the connexion somewhat differently\r\nand regard the physical laboratory as a low-temperature station\r\nattached to the stars. It is the laboratory conditions which should be\r\ncounted abnormal. Apart from the interstellar cloud which is at the\r\nmoderate temperature of about 15,000°, I suppose that nine-tenths of\r\nthe matter of the universe is above 1,000,000°. Under _ordinary_\r\nconditions--you will understand my use of the word--matter has rather\r\nsimple properties. But there are in the universe exceptional regions\r\nwith temperature not far removed from the absolute zero, where the\r\nphysical properties of matter acquire great complexity; the ions\r\nsurround themselves with complete electron systems and become the atoms\r\nof terrestrial experience. Our earth is one of these chilly places and\r\nhere the strangest complications can arise. Perhaps strangest of all,\r\nsome of these complications can meet together and speculate on the\r\nsignificance of the whole scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LECTURE III\r\n\r\n                         THE AGE OF THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen that spatially the scale of man is about midway between\r\nthe atom and the star. I am tempted to make a similar comparison as\r\nregards time. The span of the life of a man comes perhaps midway in\r\nscale between the life of an excited atom (p. 74) and the life of a\r\nstar. For those who insist on greater accuracy--though I would not\r\nlike to claim accuracy for present estimates of the life of a star--I\r\nwill modify this a little. As regards mass, man is rather too near to\r\nthe atom and a stronger claimant for the midway position would be the\r\nhippopotamus. As regards time, man’s three score years and ten is a\r\nlittle too near to the stars and it would be better to substitute a\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nThere is one serious moral in this fantasy. We shall have to consider\r\nperiods of time which appall our imagination. We fear to make such\r\ndrafts on eternity. And yet the vastness of the time-scale of stellar\r\nevolution is _less_ remote from the scale of human experience than\r\nis the minuteness of the time-scale of the processes studied in the\r\natom.\r\n\r\nOur approach to the ‘age of the stars’ will be devious, and certain\r\nincidental problems will detain us on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Pulsating Stars_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe star δ Cephei is one of the variable stars. Like Algol, its\r\nfluctuating light sends us a message. But the message when it is\r\ndecoded is not in the least like the message from Algol.\r\n\r\nLet me say at once that experts differ as to the interpretation of the\r\nmessage of δ Cephei. This is not the place to argue the matter, or to\r\nexplain why I think that rival interpretations cannot be accepted. I\r\ncan only tell you what is to the best of my belief the correct story.\r\nThe interpretation which I follow was suggested by Plummer and Shapley.\r\nThe latter in particular made it very convincing, and subsequent\r\ndevelopments have, I think, tended to strengthen it. I would not,\r\nhowever, claim that all doubt is banished.\r\n\r\nAlgol turned out to be a pair of stars very close together which from\r\ntime to time eclipse one another; δ Cephei is a single star which\r\npulsates. It is a globe which swells and contracts symmetrically with\r\na regular period of 5⅓ days. And as the globe swells and contracts\r\ncausing great changes of pressure and temperature in the interior, so\r\nthe issuing stream of light rises and falls in intensity and varies\r\nalso in quality or colour.\r\n\r\nThere is no question of eclipses; the light signals are not in the form\r\nof ‘dots’ and ‘dashes’; and in any case the change of colour shows\r\nthat there is a real change in the physical condition of the source of\r\nthe light. But at first explanations always assumed that _two_\r\nstars were concerned, and aimed at connecting the physical changes with\r\nan orbital motion. For instance, it was suggested that the principal\r\nstar in going round its orbit brushed through a resisting medium which\r\nheated its front surface; thus the light of the star varied according\r\nas the heated front surface or cooler rear surface was presented\r\ntowards us. The orbital explanation has now collapsed because it is\r\nfound that there is literally no room for two stars. The supposed orbit\r\nhad been worked out in the usual way from spectroscopic measurements of\r\nvelocity of approach and recession; later we began to learn more about\r\nthe true size of stars, first by calculation, and afterwards (for a\r\nfew stars) by direct measurement. It turned out that the star was big\r\nand the orbit small; and the second star if it existed would have to\r\nbe placed inside the principal star. This overlapping of the stars is\r\na _reductio ad absurdum_ of the binary hypothesis, and some other\r\nexplanation must be found.\r\n\r\nWhat had been taken to be the approach and recession of the star as\r\na whole was really the approach and recession of the surface as it\r\nheaved up and down with the pulsation. The stars which vary like δ\r\nCephei are diffuse stars enormously larger than the sun, and the total\r\ndisplacement measured amounts to only a fraction of the star’s radius.\r\nThere is therefore no need to assume a bodily displacement of the star\r\n(orbital motion); the measures follow the oscillation of that part of\r\nthe star’s surface presented towards us.\r\n\r\nThe decision that δ Cephei is a single star and not double has\r\none immediate consequence. It means that the period of 5⅓ days is\r\n_intrinsic_ in the star and is therefore one of the clues to\r\nits physical condition. It is a free period, not a forced period. It\r\nis important to appreciate the significance of this. The number of\r\nsunspots fluctuates from a maximum to minimum and back to maximum in\r\na period of about 11½ years; although we do not yet understand the\r\nreason for this fluctuation, we realize that this period is something\r\ncharacteristic of the sun in its present state and would change if any\r\nnotable change happened to the sun. At one time, however, there was\r\nsome speculation as to whether the fluctuation of the sunspots might\r\nnot be caused by the revolution of the planet Jupiter, which has a\r\nperiod not so very different; if that explanation had been tenable\r\nthe 11½-year period would have been something forced on the sun from\r\nwithout and would teach us nothing as to the properties of the sun\r\nitself. Having convinced ourselves that the light-period of δ Cephei\r\nis a free period of a single star, belonging to it in the same way\r\nthat a particular note belongs to a tuning-fork, we can accept it as\r\na valuable indicator of the constancy (or otherwise) of the star’s\r\nphysical condition.\r\n\r\nIn stellar astronomy we usually feel very happy if we can determine\r\nour data--parallax, radius, mass, absolute brightness, &c.--to within\r\n5 per cent.; but the measurement of a period offers chances of far\r\nsuperior accuracy. I believe that the most accurately known quantity in\r\nthe whole of science (excluding pure mathematics) is the moon’s mean\r\nperiod, which is commonly given to twelve significant figures. The\r\nperiod of δ Cephei can be found to six significant figures at least.\r\nBy fastening an observable period to the intrinsic conditions of a\r\nstar we have secured an indicator sensitive enough to show extremely\r\nsmall changes. You will now guess why I am approaching ‘the age of the\r\nstars’ through the Cepheid variables. Up to the present they are the\r\nonly stars known to carry a sensitive indicator, by which we might hope\r\nto test the rate of evolutionary change. We believe that δ Cephei like\r\nother stars has condensed out of a nebula, and that the condensation\r\nand contraction are still continuing. No one would expect to detect the\r\ncontraction by our rough determinations of the radius even if continued\r\nfor a hundred years; but the evolution must indeed be slow if an\r\nintrinsic period measurable to 1 part in 10,000,000 shows no change in\r\na century.\r\n\r\nIt does not greatly matter whether or not we understand the nature of\r\nthis intrinsic period. If a star contracts, the period of pulsation,\r\nthe period of rotation, or any other free period associated with it,\r\nwill alter. If you prefer to follow any of the rival interpretations\r\nof the message of δ Cephei, you can make the necessary alterations\r\nin the wording of my argument, but the general verdict as to the\r\nrate of progress of evolution will be unchanged. Only if you detach\r\nthe period from the star itself by going back to the old double star\r\ninterpretation will the argument collapse; but I do not think any of\r\nthe rival interpreters propose to do that.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that these pulsating stars should be regarded\r\nwith special interest. Ordinary stars must be viewed respectfully like\r\nthe objects in glass cases in museums; our fingers are itching to\r\npinch them and test their resilience. Pulsating stars are like those\r\nfascinating models in the Science Museum provided with a button which\r\ncan be pressed to set the machinery in motion. To be able to see the\r\nmachinery of a star throbbing with activity is most instructive for the\r\ndevelopment of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe theory of a steady star, which was described in the first lecture,\r\ncan be extended to pulsating stars; and we can calculate the free\r\nperiod of pulsation for a star of assigned mass and density. You\r\nwill remember that we have already calculated the heat emission or\r\nbrightness and compared it with observation, obtaining one satisfactory\r\ntest of the truth of the theory; now we can calculate the period of\r\npulsation and by comparing it with observation obtain another test.\r\nOwing to lack of information as to a certain constant of stellar\r\nmaterial there is an uncertainty in the calculation represented by a\r\nfactor of about 2; that is to say, we calculate two periods, one double\r\nthe other, between which with any reasonable luck the true period\r\nought to lie. The observational confirmation is very good. There are\r\nsixteen Cepheid variables on which the test can be made; their periods\r\nrange from 13 hours to 35 days, and they all agree with the calculated\r\nvalues to within the limits of accuracy expected. In a more indirect\r\nway the same confirmation is shown in Fig. 7 by the close agreement of\r\nthe squares, representing Cepheid variables, with the theoretical curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _The Cepheid as a ‘Standard Candle’_\r\n\r\n\r\nCepheid variables of the same period are closely similar to one\r\nanother. A Cepheid of period 5⅓ days found in any part of the universe\r\nwill be practically a replica of δ Cephei; in particular it will be\r\na star of the same absolute brightness. This is a fact discovered\r\nby observation, and is not predicted by any part of the theory yet\r\nexplored. The brightness, as we have seen, depends mainly on the mass;\r\nthe period, on the other hand, depends mainly on the density; so that\r\nthe observed relation between brightness and period involves a relation\r\nbetween mass and density. Presumably this relation signifies that for a\r\ngiven mass there is just one special density--one stage in the course\r\nof condensation of the star--at which pulsations are liable to occur;\r\nat other densities the star can only burn steadily.\r\n\r\nThis property renders the Cepheid extremely useful to astronomers. It\r\nserves as a standard candle--a source of known light-power.\r\n\r\nIn an ordinary way you cannot tell the _real_ brightness of a\r\nlight merely by looking at it. If it appears dim, that may mean either\r\nreal faintness or great distance. At night time on the sea you observe\r\nmany lights whose distance and real brightness you cannot estimate;\r\nyour judgement of the real brightness may be wrong by a factor of a\r\nquintillion if you happen to mistake Arcturus for a ship’s light. But\r\namong them you may notice a light which goes through a regular series\r\nof changes in a certain number of seconds; that tells you that it\r\nis such-and-such a lighthouse, known to project a light of so many\r\nthousand candlepower. You may now estimate with certainty how far off\r\nit is--provided, of course, that there is no fog intervening.\r\n\r\nSo, too, when we look up at the sky, most of the lights that we see\r\nmight be at any distance and have any real brightness. Even the most\r\nrefined measurements of parallax only succeed in locating a few of the\r\nnearer lights. But if we see a light winking in the Cepheid manner with\r\na period of 5⅓ days, we know that it is a replica of δ Cephei and is a\r\nlight of 700 sun-power. Or if the period is any other number of days\r\nwe can assign the proper sun-power for that period. From this we can\r\njudge the distance. The apparent brightness, which is a combination\r\nof distance and true brightness, is measured; then it is a simple\r\ncalculation to answer the question, At what distance must a light\r\nof 700 sun-power be placed in order to give the apparent brightness\r\nobserved? How about interference by fog? Careful discussions have\r\nbeen made, and it appears that notwithstanding the cosmical cloud in\r\ninterstellar space there is ordinarily no appreciable absorption or\r\nscattering of the starlight on its way to us.\r\n\r\nWith the Cepheids serving as standard candles distances in the stellar\r\nuniverse have been surveyed far exceeding those reached by previous\r\nmethods. If the distances were merely those of the Cepheid variables\r\nthemselves that would not be so important, but much more information is\r\nyielded.\r\n\r\nFig. 11[26] shows a famous star-cluster called ω Centauri. Amongst the\r\nthousands of stars in the cluster no less than 76 Cepheid variables\r\nhave been discovered. Each is a standard candle serving to measure the\r\ndistance primarily of itself but also incidentally of the great cluster\r\nin which it lies. The 76 gauges agree wonderfully among themselves, the\r\naverage deviation being less than 5 per cent. By this means Shapley\r\nfound the distance of the cluster to be 20,000 light years. The light\r\nmessages which we receive to-day were sent from the cluster 20,000\r\nyears ago.[27]\r\n\r\nThe astronomer, more than other devotees of science, learns to\r\nappreciate the advantage of not being too near the objects he is\r\nstudying. The nearer stars are all right in their way, but it is a\r\ngreat nuisance being in the very midst of them. For each star has to\r\nbe treated singly and located at its proper distance by elaborate\r\nmeasurements; progress is very laborious. But when we determine the\r\ndistance of this remote cluster, we secure at one scoop the distances\r\nof many thousands of stars. The distance being known, the apparent\r\nmagnitudes can be turned into true magnitudes, and statistics and\r\ncorrelations of absolute brightness and colour can be ascertained.\r\nEven before the distance is discovered we can learn a great deal from\r\nthe stars in clusters which it is impracticable to find out from less\r\nremote stars. We can see that the Cepheids are much above the average\r\nbrightness and are surpassed by relatively few stars. We can ascertain\r\nthat the brighter the Cepheid the longer is its period. We discover\r\nthat the brightest stars of all are red.[28] And so on. There is a\r\nreverse side to the picture; the tiny points of light in the distant\r\ncluster are not the most satisfactory objects to measure and analyse,\r\nand we could ill spare the nearer stars; but the fact remains that\r\nthere are certain lines of stellar investigation in which remoteness\r\nproves to be an actual advantage, and we turn from the nearer stars to\r\nobjects fifty thousand light years away.\r\n\r\nAbout 80 globular clusters are known with distances ranging from\r\n20,000 to 200,000 light years. Is there anything yet more remote? It\r\nhas long been suspected that the spiral nebulae,[29] which seem to be\r\nexceedingly numerous, are outside our stellar system and form ‘island\r\nuniverses’. The evidence for this has become gradually stronger, and\r\nnow is believed to be decisively confirmed. In 1924 Hubble discovered\r\na number of Cepheid variables in the great Andromeda nebula which is\r\nthe largest and presumably one of the nearest of the spirals. As soon\r\nas their periods had been determined they were available as standard\r\ncandles to gauge the distance of the nebula. Their apparent magnitude\r\nwas much fainter than that of the corresponding Cepheids in globular\r\nclusters, showing that they must be even more remote. Hubble has since\r\nfound the distance of one or two other spirals in the same way.\r\n\r\nWith the naked eye you can see the Andromeda nebula as a faint patch of\r\nlight. When you look at it you are looking back 900,000 years into the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The Contraction Hypothesis_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of providing sufficient supplies of energy to maintain the\r\nsun’s output of light and heat has often been debated by astronomers\r\nand others. In the last century it was shown by Helmholtz and\r\nKelvin that the sun could maintain its heat for a very long time by\r\ncontinually shrinking. Contraction involves an approach or fall of\r\nthe matter towards the centre; gravitational potential energy is thus\r\nconverted and made available as heat. It was assumed that this was\r\nthe sole resource since no other supply capable of yielding anything\r\nlike so large an amount was known. But the supply is not unlimited,\r\nand on this hypothesis the birth of the sun must be dated not more\r\nthan 20,000,000 years ago. Even at the time of which I am speaking the\r\ntime-limit was found to be cramping; but Kelvin assured the geologists\r\nand biologists that they must confine their outlines of terrestrial\r\nhistory within this period.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the present century the contraction theory was\r\nin the curious position of being generally accepted and generally\r\nignored. Whilst few ventured to dispute the hypothesis, no one seems to\r\nhave had any hesitation, if it suited him, in carrying back the history\r\nof the earth or moon to a time long before the supposed era of the\r\nformation of the solar system. Lord Kelvin’s date of the creation was\r\ntreated with no more respect than Archbishop Ussher’s.\r\n\r\nThe serious consequences of the hypothesis become particularly\r\nprominent when we consider the diffuse stars of high luminosity; these\r\nare prodigal of their energy and squander it a hundred or a thousand\r\ntimes faster than the sun. The economical sun could have subsisted\r\non its contraction energy for 20,000,000 years, but for the high\r\nluminosity stars the limit is cut down to 100,000 years. This includes\r\nmost of the naked-eye stars. Dare we believe that they were formed\r\nwithin the last 100,000 years? Is the antiquity of man greater than\r\nthat of the stars now shining? Do stars in the Andromeda nebula run\r\ntheir course in less time than their light takes to reach us?\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to feel a limitation of time-scale irksome, ruling out\r\nideas and explanations which are otherwise plausible and attractive; it\r\nis another thing to produce definite evidence against the time-scale.\r\nI do not think that astronomers had _in their own territory_ any\r\nweapon for a direct attack on the Helmholtz-Kelvin hypothesis until\r\nthe Cepheid variables supplied one. To come to figures: δ Cephei emits\r\nmore than 700 times as much heat as the sun. We know its mass and\r\nradius, and we can calculate without difficulty how fast the radius\r\nmust contract in order to provide this heat. The required rate is one\r\npart in 40,000 per annum. Now δ Cephei was first observed carefully\r\nin 1785, so that in the time it has been under observation the radius\r\nmust have changed by one part in 300 if the contraction hypothesis is\r\nright. You remember that we have in δ Cephei a very sensitive indicator\r\nof any changes occurring in it, viz. the period of pulsation; clearly\r\nchanges of the above magnitude could not occur without disturbing this\r\nindicator. Does the period show any change? It is doubtful; there is\r\nperhaps sufficient evidence for a slight change, but it is not more\r\nthan ¹⁄₂₀₀th of the change demanded by the contraction hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAccepting the pulsation theory, the period should diminish 17 seconds\r\nevery year--a quantity easily detectable. The actual change is not\r\nmore than one-tenth of a second per year. At least during the Cepheid\r\nstage the stars are drawing on some source of energy other than that\r\nprovided by contraction.\r\n\r\nOn such an important question we should not like to put implicit\r\ntrust in one argument alone, and we turn to the sister sciences for\r\nother and perhaps more conclusive evidence. Physical and geological\r\ninvestigations seem to decide definitely that the age of the\r\nearth--reckoned from an epoch which by no means goes back to its\r\nbeginnings as a planet--is far greater than the Helmholtz-Kelvin\r\nestimate of the age of the solar system. It is usual to lay most stress\r\non a determination of the age of the rocks from the uranium-lead ratio\r\nof their contents. Uranium disintegrates into lead and helium at a\r\nknown rate. Since lead is unlike uranium in chemical properties the two\r\nelements would not naturally be deposited together; so that the lead\r\nfound with uranium has presumably been formed by its decomposition.[30]\r\nBy measuring how much lead occurs with the uranium we can determine\r\nhow long ago the uranium was deposited. The age of the older rocks\r\nis found to be about 1,200 million years; lower estimates have been\r\nurged by some authorities, but none low enough to save the contraction\r\nhypothesis. The sun, of course, must be very much older than the earth\r\nand its rocks.\r\n\r\nWe seem to require a time-scale which will allow at least\r\n10,000,000,000 years for the age of the sun; certainly we cannot\r\nabate our demands below 1,000,000,000 years. It is necessary to look\r\nfor a more prolific source of energy to maintain the heat of the\r\nsun and stars through this extended period. We can at once narrow\r\ndown the field of search. No source of energy is of any avail unless\r\nit liberates heat in the deep interior of the star. The crux of the\r\nproblem is not merely the provision for radiation but the maintenance\r\nof the internal heat which keeps the gravitating mass from collapsing.\r\nYou will remember how in the first lecture we had to assign a certain\r\namount of heat at each point in the stellar interior in order to keep\r\nthe star in balance. But the internal heat is continually running away\r\ntowards the cooler outside and then escaping into space as the star’s\r\nradiation. This, or its equivalent, must be put back if the star is to\r\nbe kept steady--if it is not to contract and evolve at the rate of the\r\nKelvin time-scale. And it is no use to put it back at the surface of\r\nthe star--by bombarding the star with meteors, for example. It could\r\nnot flow up the temperature-gradient, and so it would simply take the\r\nfirst opportunity of escaping as additional radiation. You cannot\r\nmaintain a temperature-gradient by supplying heat at the bottom end.\r\nHeat must be poured in at the top end, i. e. in the deep interior of\r\nthe star.\r\n\r\nSince we cannot well imagine an extraneous source of heat able to\r\nrelease itself at the centre of a star, the idea of a star picking up\r\nenergy as it goes along seems to be definitely ruled out. _It follows\r\nthat the star contains hidden within it the energy which has to last\r\nthe rest of its life_.\r\n\r\nEnergy has mass. Many people would prefer to say--energy _is_\r\nmass; but it is not necessary for us to discuss that. The essential\r\nfact is that an erg of energy in any form has a mass of 1·1. 10^-21\r\ngrammes. The erg is the usual scientific unit of energy; but we can\r\nmeasure energy also by the gramme or the ton as we measure anything\r\nelse which possesses mass. There is no real reason why you should not\r\nbuy a pound of light from an electric light company--except that it\r\nis a larger quantity than you are likely to need and at current rates\r\nwould cost you something over £100,000,000. If you could keep all this\r\nlight (ether-waves) travelling to and fro between mirrors forming a\r\nclosed vessel, and then weigh the vessel, the observed weight would be\r\nthe ordinary weight of the vessel plus 1 lb. representing the weight of\r\nthe light. It is evident that an object weighing a ton cannot contain\r\nmore than a ton of energy; and the sun with a mass of 2.000 quadrillion\r\ntons (p. 24) cannot contain more than 2.000 quadrillion tons of energy\r\nat the most.\r\n\r\nEnergy of 1·8. 10^{54} ergs has a mass 2. 10^{33} grammes which is the\r\nmass of the sun; consequently that is the sum total of the energy which\r\nthe sun contains--the energy which has to last it all the rest of its\r\nlife.[31] We do not know how much of this is capable of being converted\r\ninto heat and radiation; if it is all convertible there is enough to\r\nmaintain the sun’s radiation at the present rate for 15 billion years.\r\nTo put the argument in another form, the heat emitted by the sun each\r\nyear has a mass of 120 billion tons; and if this loss of mass continued\r\nthere would be no mass left at the end of 15 billion years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Subatomic Energy_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis store of energy is, with insignificant exception, energy of\r\nconstitution of atoms and electrons; that is to say, subatomic energy.\r\nMost of it is inherent in the constitution of the electrons and\r\nprotons--the elementary negative and positive electric charges--out\r\nof which matter is built; so that it cannot be set free unless these\r\nare destroyed. The main store of energy in a star cannot be used for\r\nradiation unless the matter composing the star is being annihilated.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the star may have a long enough life without\r\nraiding the main energy store. A small part of the store can be\r\nreleased by a process less drastic than annihilation of matter, and\r\nthis might be sufficient to keep the sun burning for 10,000,000,000\r\nyears or so, which is perhaps as long as we can reasonably require.\r\nThe less drastic process is transmutation of the elements. Thus we\r\nhave reached a point where a choice lies open before us; we can either\r\npin our faith to transmutation of the elements, contenting ourselves\r\nwith a rather cramped time-scale, or we can assume the annihilation of\r\nmatter, which gives a very ample time-scale. But at present I can see\r\nno possibility of a third choice. Let me run over the argument again.\r\nFirst we found that energy of contraction was hopelessly inadequate;\r\nthen we found that the energy must be released in the interior of the\r\nstar, so that it comes from an internal, not an external, source; now\r\nwe take stock of the whole internal store of energy. No supply of\r\nany importance is found until we come to consider the electrons and\r\natomic nuclei; here a reasonable amount can be released by regrouping\r\nthe protons and electrons in the atomic nuclei (transmutation of\r\nelements), and a much greater amount by annihilating them.\r\n\r\nTransmutation of the elements--so long the dream of the alchemist--is\r\nrealized in the transformation of radio-active substances. Uranium\r\nturns slowly into a mixture of lead and helium. But none of the known\r\nradio-active processes liberate anything like enough energy to maintain\r\nthe sun’s heat. The only important release of energy by transmutation\r\noccurs at the very beginning of the evolution of the elements.\r\n\r\nWe must start with hydrogen. The hydrogen atom consists simply of a\r\npositive and negative charge, a proton for the nucleus plus a planet\r\nelectron. Let us call its mass 1. Four hydrogen atoms will make a\r\nhelium atom. If the mass of the helium atom were exactly 4, that would\r\nshow that all the energy of the hydrogen atoms remained in the helium\r\natom. But actually the mass is 3·97; so that energy of mass a 0·03\r\nmust have escaped during the formation of helium from hydrogen. By\r\nannihilating 4 grammes of hydrogen we should have released 4 grammes of\r\nenergy, but by transmuting it into helium we release 0·03 grammes of\r\nenergy. Either process might be used to furnish the sun’s heat though,\r\nas we have already stated, the second gives a much smaller supply.\r\n\r\nThe release of energy occurs because in the helium atom only two of the\r\nfour electrons remain as planet electrons, the other two being cemented\r\nwith the four protons close together in the helium nucleus. In bringing\r\npositive and negative charges close together you cause a change of\r\nthe energy of the electric field, and release electrical energy which\r\nspreads away as ether-waves. That is where the 0·03 grammes of energy\r\nhas gone. The star can absorb these ether-waves and utilize them as\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nWe can go on from helium to higher elements, but we do not obtain much\r\nmore release of energy. For example, an oxygen atom can be made from 16\r\nhydrogen atoms or 4 helium atoms; but as nearly as we can tell it has\r\njust the weight of the 4 helium atoms, so that the release of energy\r\nis not appreciably greater when the hydrogen is transmuted into oxygen\r\nthan when it is transmuted into helium.[32] This becomes clearer if\r\nwe take the mass of a hydrogen atom to be 1·008, so that the mass of\r\nhelium is exactly 4 and of oxygen 16; then it is known from Dr. Aston’s\r\nresearches with the mass-spectrograph that the atoms of other elements\r\nhave masses which are very closely whole numbers. The loss of 0·008 per\r\nhydrogen atom applies approximately whatever the element that is formed.\r\n\r\nThe view that the energy of a star is derived by the building up of\r\nother elements from hydrogen has the great advantage that there is no\r\ndoubt about the possibility of the process; whereas we have no evidence\r\nthat the annihilation of matter can occur in Nature. I am not referring\r\nto the alleged transmutation of hydrogen into helium in the laboratory;\r\nthose whose authority I accept are not convinced by these experiments.\r\nTo my mind the existence of helium is the best evidence we could desire\r\nof the possibility of the _formation_ of helium. The four protons\r\nand two electrons constituting its nucleus must have been assembled at\r\nsome time and place; and why not in the stars? When they were assembled\r\nthe surplus energy must have been released, providing a prolific supply\r\nof heat. Prima facie this suggests the interior of a star as a likely\r\nlocality, since undoubtedly a prolific source of heat is there in\r\noperation. I am aware that many critics consider the conditions in the\r\nstars not sufficiently extreme to bring about the transmutation--the\r\nstars are not hot enough. The critics lay themselves open to an obvious\r\nretort; we tell them to go and find a _hotter place_.\r\n\r\nBut here the advantage seems to end. There are many astronomical\r\nindications that the hypothesis attributing the energy of the stars\r\nto the transmutation of hydrogen is unsatisfactory. It may perhaps be\r\nresponsible for the rapid liberation of energy in the earliest (giant)\r\nstages when the star is a large diffuse body radiating heat abundantly;\r\nbut the energy in later life seems to come from a source subject to\r\ndifferent laws of emission. There is considerable evidence that as a\r\nstar grows older it gets rid of a large fraction of the matter which\r\noriginally constituted it, and apparently this can only be contrived\r\nby the annihilation of the matter. The evidence, however, is not very\r\ncoherent, and I do not think we are in a position to come to a definite\r\ndecision. On the whole the hypothesis of annihilation of matter seems\r\nthe more promising; and I shall prefer it in the brief discussion of\r\nstellar evolution which I propose to give.\r\n\r\nThe phrase ‘annihilation of matter’ sounds like something supernatural.\r\nWe do not yet know whether it can occur naturally or not, but there is\r\nno obvious obstacle. The ultimate constituents of matter are minute\r\npositive charges and negative charges which we may picture as centres\r\nof opposite kinds of strain in the ether. If these could be persuaded\r\nto run together they would cancel out, leaving nothing except a splash\r\nin the ether which spreads out as an electromagnetic wave carrying off\r\nthe energy released by the undoing of the strain. The amount of this\r\nenergy is amazingly large; by annihilating a single drop of water we\r\nshould be supplied with 200 horsepower for a year. We turn covetous\r\neyes on this store without, however, entertaining much hope of ever\r\ndiscovering the secret of releasing it. If it should prove that the\r\nstars have discovered the secret and are using this store to maintain\r\ntheir heat, our prospect of ultimate success would seem distinctly\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\nI suppose that many physicists will regard the subject of subatomic\r\nenergy as a field of airy speculation. That is not the way in which\r\nit presents itself to an astronomer. If it is granted that the stars\r\nevolve much more slowly than on the contraction-hypothesis, the\r\nmeasurement of the output of subatomic energy is one of the commonest\r\nastronomical measurements--the measurement of the heat or light of the\r\nstars.[33] The collection of observational data as to the activity of\r\nliberation of subatomic energy is part of the routine of practical\r\nastronomy; and we have to pursue the usual course of arranging the\r\nmeasurements into some kind of coherence, so as to find out how the\r\noutput is related to the temperature, density, or age of the material\r\nsupplying it--in short, to discover the laws of emission. From this\r\npoint onwards the discussion may be more or less hypothetical according\r\nto the temperament of the investigator; and indeed it is likely that in\r\nthis as in other branches of knowledge advances may come by a proper\r\nuse of the scientific imagination. Vain speculation is to be condemned\r\nin this as in any other subject, and there is no need for it; the\r\nproblem is one of induction from observation with due regard to our\r\ntheoretical knowledge of the possibilities inherent in atomic structure.\r\n\r\nI cannot pass from this subject without mentioning the penetrating\r\nradiation long known to exist in our atmosphere, which according\r\nto the researches of Kohlhörster and Millikan comes from outer\r\nspace. Penetrating power is a sign of short wave-length and intense\r\nconcentration of energy. Hitherto the greatest penetrating power\r\nhas been displayed by Gamma rays originated by subatomic processes\r\noccurring in radio-active substances. The cosmic radiation is still\r\nmore penetrating, and it seems reasonable to refer it to more energetic\r\nprocesses in the atom such as those suggested for the source of\r\nstellar energy. Careful measurements have been made by Millikan, and\r\nhe concludes that the properties accord with those which should be\r\npossessed by radiation liberated in the transmutation of hydrogen; it\r\nis not penetrating enough to be attributed to a process so energetic as\r\nthe annihilation of protons and electrons.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that this radiation is travelling downwards\r\nfrom the sky. This is shown by measurements of its strength at\r\ndifferent heights in the atmosphere and at different depths below the\r\nsurface of mountain lakes; it is weakened according to the amount of\r\nair or water that it has had to traverse. Presumably its source must be\r\nextra-terrestrial. Its strength does not vary with the sun’s altitude,\r\nso it is not coming from the sun. There is some evidence that it varies\r\naccording to the position of the Milky Way, most radiation being\r\nreceived when the greatest extension of the stellar system is overhead.\r\nIt cannot come from the _interior_ of the stars, the penetrating\r\npower being too limited; all the hottest and densest matter in the\r\nuniverse is shut off from us by impenetrable walls. At the most it\r\ncould come only from the outer rind of the stars where the temperature\r\nis moderate and the density is low; but it is more likely that its main\r\nsource is in the diffuse nebulae or possibly in the matter forming the\r\ngeneral cloud in space.[34]\r\n\r\nWe must await further developments before we can regard the supposed\r\nsubatomic origin of this radiation as other than speculative; we\r\nmention it here only as a possible opening for progress. It will be of\r\ngreat interest if we can reach by this means a more direct acquaintance\r\nwith the processes which we assume to be the source of stellar energy;\r\nand the messages borne to us by the cosmic rays which purport to\r\nrelate to these processes deserve the closest attention. Our views\r\nof stellar energy are likely to be affected on one crucial point.\r\nHitherto we have usually supposed that the very high temperature in the\r\ninterior of a star is one of the essential conditions for liberation of\r\nsubatomic energy, and that a reasonably high density is also important.\r\nTheoretically it would seem almost incredible that the building up of\r\nhigher elements or the annihilation of protons and electrons could\r\nproceed with any degree of vigour in regions where encounters are rare\r\nand there is no high temperature or intense radiation to wake the atoms\r\nfrom apathy; but the more we face the difficulties of all theories of\r\nthe release of subatomic energy the less inclined we are to condemn\r\nany evidence as incredible. The presence of sodium and calcium in\r\nthe cosmical cloud, of helium and nebulium in the diffuse nebulae,\r\nof titanium and zirconium in large quantities in the atmospheres of\r\nthe youngest stars, bears witness that the evolution of the elements\r\nis already far advanced during the diffuse prestellar stage--unless\r\nindeed our universe is built from the debris of a former creation.\r\nFrom this point of view it is fitting that we should discern symptoms\r\nof subatomic activity in open space. But the physicist may well shake\r\nhis head over the problem. How are four protons and two electrons to\r\ngather together to form a helium nucleus in a medium so rare that the\r\nfree path lasts for days? The only comfort is that the mode of this\r\noccurrence is (according to present knowledge) so inconceivable under\r\nany conditions of density and temperature that we may postulate it in\r\nthe nebulae--on the principle that we may as well be hung for a sheep\r\nas for a lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Evolution of the Stars_\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago stellar evolution seemed to be very simple. The stars\r\nbegin by being very hot and gradually cool down until they go out.\r\n\r\nOn this view the temperature of a star indicated the stage of evolution\r\nthat it had reached. The outline of the sequence was sufficiently\r\nindicated by the crude observation of colour--white-hot, yellow-hot,\r\nred-hot; a more detailed order of temperature was ascertained by\r\nexamining the light with a spectroscope. The red stars naturally\r\ncame last in the sequence; they were the oldest stars on the verge\r\nof extinction. Sir Norman Lockyer strongly opposed this scheme and\r\nto a considerable extent anticipated the more modern view; but most\r\nastronomers pinned their faith to it up to about 1913.\r\n\r\nTen years ago more knowledge had been gained of the densities of\r\nstars. It seemed likely that density would be a more direct criterion\r\nof evolutionary development than temperature. Granted that a star\r\ncondenses out of nebulous material, it must in the youngest stage be\r\nvery diffuse; from that stage it will contract and steadily increase in\r\ndensity.\r\n\r\nBut this necessitates an entire rearrangement of the scheme of\r\nevolution, because the order according to density is by no means the\r\nsame as the order according to surface temperature. On the former\r\nview all the cool red stars were old and dying. But a large number of\r\nthem are now found to be extremely diffuse--stars like Betelgeuse,\r\nfor instance. These must be set down as the very youngest of the\r\nstars; after all it is not unnatural that a star just beginning to\r\ncondense out of nebulous material should start at the lowest stage of\r\ntemperature. Not all the red stars are diffuse; there are many like\r\nKrueger 60 which have high density, and these we leave undisturbed\r\nas representing the last stage of evolution. Both the first and last\r\nperiods of a star’s life are characterized by low temperature; in\r\nbetween whiles the temperature must have risen to a maximum and fallen\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe ‘giant and dwarf theory’ proposed by Hertzsprung and Russell\r\nbrought these conclusions into excellent order. It recognized a series\r\nof _giant_ stars, comparatively diffuse stars with temperature\r\nrising, and a series of _dwarf_ or dense stars with temperature\r\nfalling. The two series merged at the highest temperatures. An\r\nindividual star during its lifetime went up the giant series to its\r\nhighest temperature and then down the dwarf series. The brightness\r\nremained fairly steady throughout the giant stage because the\r\ncontinually increasing temperature counterbalanced the reduction of\r\nthe surface area of the star; in the dwarf stage the decreasing\r\ntemperature and the contraction of the surface caused a rapid decrease\r\nof brightness as the star progressed down the series. This was in\r\naccordance with observation. The theory has dominated most recent\r\nastrophysical research and has been instrumental in bringing to light\r\nmany important facts. One example must suffice. Although we may have a\r\ngiant and a dwarf star with the same surface temperature, and therefore\r\nshowing very similar spectra, nevertheless a close examination of the\r\nspectrum reveals tell-tale differences; and it is now quite easy to\r\nascertain from the spectrum whether the star is a diffuse giant or a\r\ndense dwarf.\r\n\r\nThe attractive feature of the giant and dwarf theory was the simple\r\nexplanation given for the up-and-down progress of the temperature.\r\nThe passing over from the giant to the dwarf series was supposed to\r\noccur when the density had reached such a value (about one-quarter the\r\ndensity of water) that the deviation of the material from a perfect gas\r\nbegan to be serious. It was shown by Lane fifty years ago that a globe\r\nof perfect gas must rise in temperature as it contracts, his method of\r\nfinding the internal temperature being that considered on p. 12; thus\r\nthe rising temperature in the giant stage is predicted. But the rise\r\ndepends essentially on the easy compressibility of the gas; and when\r\nthe compressibility is lost at high density the rising temperature may\r\nbe expected to give place to falling temperature so that the star cools\r\nas a solid or liquid would do. That was believed to account for the\r\ndwarf stage.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to recall ideas of twenty and ten years ago, and you\r\nmust not suppose that from the standpoint of present-day knowledge I\r\ncan endorse everything here stated. I have intentionally been vague\r\nas to whether by the hotness of a star I mean the internal or the\r\nsurface temperature since ideas were formerly very loose on this point;\r\nI have made no reference to white dwarfs, which are now thought to be\r\nthe densest and presumably the oldest stars of all. But it is the last\r\nparagraph especially which conflicts with our latest conclusions, for\r\nwe no longer admit that stellar material will cease to behave as a\r\nperfect gas at one-quarter the density of water. Our result that the\r\nmaterial in the dense dwarf stars is still perfect gas (p. 38) strikes\r\na fatal blow at this part of the giant and dwarf theory.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say what is the accepted theory of stellar\r\nevolution to-day. The theory is in the melting-pot and we are still\r\nwaiting for something satisfactory to emerge. The whole subject is in\r\ndoubt and we are prepared to reconsider almost anything. Provisionally,\r\nhowever, I shall assume that the former theory was right in assuming\r\nthat the sequence of evolution is from the most diffuse to the densest\r\nstars. Although I make this assumption I do not feel sure that it is\r\nallowable. The former theory had strong reasons for making it which\r\nno longer apply. So long as contraction was supposed to be the source\r\nof a star’s heat, contraction and increasing density were essential\r\nthroughout its whole career; with the acceptance of subatomic energy\r\ncontraction ceases to play this fundamental role.\r\n\r\nI propose to confine attention to the dwarf stars[35] because it is\r\namong them that the upset has occurred. They form a well-defined series\r\nstretching from high surface-temperature to low surface-temperature,\r\nhigh luminosity to low luminosity, and the density increases steadily\r\nalong the series. We now call this the Main Series. It comprises the\r\ngreat majority of the stars. To fix ideas let us take three typical\r\nstars along the series--Algol near the top, the Sun near the middle,\r\nand Krueger 60 near the bottom. The relevant information about them is\r\nsummarized below:\r\n\r\n                   Mean         Central\r\n                  density      temperature      Surface\r\n         Mass     (Water       (million       temperature        Luminosity\r\nStar. (Sun = 1).     =1).         deg.).         (deg.)  Colour. (Sun = 1).\r\nAlgol    4·3     0·15            40             12,000    white       150\r\nSun      1       1·4             40              6,000   yellow        1\r\nKrueger\r\n60       0·27    9·1             35              3,000      red        0·01\r\n\r\nThe idea of evolution is that these represent the stages passed\r\nthrough in the life-history of an individual star.[36] The increasing\r\ndensity in the third column should be noticed; according to our\r\naccepted criterion it indicates that the order of development is\r\nAlgol→Sun→Krueger 60. A confusion between internal temperature and\r\nsurface temperature is responsible for some of the mistakes of the\r\nolder theories. To outward view the star cools from 12,000° to 3,000°\r\nin passing down the series, but there is no such change in its internal\r\nheat. The central temperature remains surprisingly steady. (No special\r\nreliance can be placed on the slight falling off apparently shown by\r\nKrueger 60.) It is very remarkable that all stars of the main series\r\nhave a central temperature of about 40 million degrees as nearly as we\r\ncan calculate. It is difficult to resist the impression that there is\r\nsome unusual property associated with this temperature, although all\r\nour physical instincts warn us that the idea is absurd.\r\n\r\nBut the vital point is the decrease of mass shown in the second column.\r\n_If an individual star is to progress any part of the way down the\r\nmain series it must lose mass_. We can put the same inference in a\r\nmore general way. Now that it has been found that luminosity depends\r\nmainly on mass, there can be no important evolution of faint stars from\r\nbright stars unless the stars lose a considerable part of their mass.\r\n\r\nIt is this result which has caused the hypothesis of annihilation of\r\nmatter to be seriously discussed. All progress in the theory of stellar\r\nevolution is held up pending a decision on this hypothesis. If it is\r\naccepted it provides an easy key to these changes. The star may (after\r\npassing through the giant stage) reach the stage of Algol, and then by\r\nthe gradual annihilation of the matter in it pass down the main series\r\nuntil when only one-sixteenth of the original mass remains it will be\r\na faint red star like Krueger 60. But if there is no annihilation of\r\nmatter, the star when once it has reached the dwarf stage seems to be\r\nimmovable; it has to stay at the point of the series corresponding to\r\nits constant mass.\r\n\r\nLet it be clearly understood what is the point at issue. The stars\r\nlose mass by their radiation; there is no question about that. The\r\nsun is losing 120 billion tons annually whether its radiation comes\r\nfrom annihilation of matter or any other internal source. The question\r\nis, How long can this loss continue? Unless there is annihilation of\r\nmatter, all the mass that can escape as radiation will have escaped in\r\na comparatively short time; the sun will then be extinct and there is\r\nan end to the loss and to the evolution. But if there is annihilation\r\nof matter the life of the sun and the loss of mass continue far longer,\r\nand an extended track of evolution lies open before the sun; when it\r\nhas got rid of three-quarters of its present mass it will have become a\r\nfaint star like Krueger 60.\r\n\r\nOur choice between the possible theories of subatomic energy only\r\naffects stellar evolution in one point--but it is the vital point.\r\nUnless we choose annihilation of matter, we cut the life of a star so\r\nshort that there is no time for any significant evolution at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the same objection that every one must feel to building\r\nextensively on a hypothetical process without any direct evidence that\r\nthe laws of Nature permit of its occurrence. But the alternative is to\r\nleave the stars in sleepy uniformity with no prospect of development\r\nor change until their lives come to an end. Something is needed to\r\ngalvanize the scene into that activity, whether of progress or decay,\r\nin which we have so long believed. Rather desperately we seize on the\r\none visible chance. The petrified system wakes. The ultimate particles\r\none by one yield up their energy and pass out of existence. Their\r\nsacrifice is the life-force of the stars which now progress on their\r\nhigh adventure:\r\n\r\n    Atoms or systems into ruin hurl’d,\r\n    And now a bubble burst, and now a world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Radiation of Mass_\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first evidence of the extent of the time-scale of stellar evolution\r\nwas afforded by the steadiness of condition of δ Cephei. This was\r\nsupplemented by evidence of the great extension of geological time on\r\nthe earth. We could not do more than set an upper limit to the rate of\r\nprogress of evolution and a lower limit to the age of the stars. But\r\nthis limit was sufficient to rule out the contraction hypothesis and\r\ndrive us to consider the store of subatomic energy.\r\n\r\nWe now make a new attack, which depends on the belief that _the rate\r\nof evolution is determined by the rate at which a star can get rid of\r\nits mass_. We are here considering only the evolution of faint stars\r\nfrom bright stars, and there will remain scope for a certain amount of\r\ndevelopment in the giant stage to which our arguments will not directly\r\napply. But to abandon all lines of evolution between bright stars and\r\nfaint stars would mean admitting that one star differs from another\r\nstar in brightness because it was different originally. This _may_\r\nbe true; but we ought not to surrender the main field of stellar\r\nevolution without making a fight for it.\r\n\r\nBy the new line of attack we reach a definite determination of the\r\ntime-scale and not merely a lower limit. We know the rate at which\r\nstars in each stage are losing mass by radiation; therefore we can find\r\nthe time taken to lose a given mass and thereby pass on to a stage of\r\nsmaller mass. Evolution from Algol to the Sun requires five billion\r\nyears; evolution from the Sun to Krueger 60 requires 500 billion years.\r\nIt is interesting to note that stars in the stage between the Sun and\r\nKrueger 60 are much more abundant than those between Algol and the\r\nSun--a fact somewhat confirmatory of the calculated duration of the\r\ntwo stages. The abundance of faint stars does not, however, increase so\r\nrapidly as the calculated duration; perhaps the stellar universe has\r\nnot existed long enough for the old stars to be fully represented.\r\n\r\nA star of greater mass than Algol squanders its mass very rapidly, so\r\nthat we do not increase the age of the Sun appreciably by supposing it\r\nto have started with greater mass than Algol. The upper limit to the\r\npresent age of the Sun is 5·2 billion years however great its initial\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked, cannot a star accelerate its progress by getting\r\nrid of matter in some other way than by radiation? Cannot atoms escape\r\nfrom its surface? If so the loss of mass and consequent evolution will\r\nbe speeded up, and the time required may perhaps even be brought within\r\nrange of the alternative theory of transmutation of the elements. But\r\nit is fairly certain that the mass escaping in the form of material\r\natoms is negligible compared with that which imperceptibly glides\r\naway in the form of radiation. You will perhaps be in doubt as to\r\nwhether the 120 billion tons per annum lost by the sun in radiation is\r\n(astronomically regarded) a large quantity or a small quantity. From\r\ncertain aspects it is a large quantity. It is more than 100,000 times\r\nthe mass of the calcium chromosphere. The sun would have to blow off\r\nits chromosphere and form an entirely fresh one every five minutes in\r\norder to get rid of as much mass in this way as it loses by radiation.\r\nIt is obvious from solar observation that there is no such outrush\r\nof material. To put it another way--in order to halve the time-scale\r\nof evolution stated above it would be necessary that a billion atoms\r\nshould escape each second through each square centimetre of the sun’s\r\nsurface. I think we may conclude that there is no short cut to smaller\r\nmass and that radiation is responsible for practically the whole loss.\r\n\r\nWe noticed earlier (p. 25) that Nature builds stars which are much\r\nalike in mass, but allows herself some deviation from her pattern\r\namounting sometimes to a mistake of one 0. I think we may have done\r\nher an injustice, and that she is more careful over her work than we\r\nsupposed. We ought to have examined coins fresh from her mint; it was\r\nnot fair to take coins promiscuously, including many that had been in\r\ncirculation for some hundreds of billions of years and had worn rather\r\nthin. Taking the newly formed stars, i. e. the diffuse stars, we find\r\nthat 90 per cent. of them are between 2½ and 5½ times the mass of the\r\nsun--showing that initially the stars are made nearly as closely to\r\npattern as human beings are. In this range radiation pressure increases\r\nfrom 17 to 35 per cent, of the whole pressure; I think this would be\r\nexpected to be the crucial stage in its rise to importance. Our idea\r\nis that the stellar masses initially have this rather close uniformity\r\n(which does not exclude a small proportion of exceptional stars outside\r\nthe above limits); the smaller masses are evolved from these in course\r\nof time by the radiation of mass.\r\n\r\nFor the time being the sun is comfortably settled in its present state,\r\nthe amount of energy radiated being just balanced by the subatomic\r\nenergy liberated inside it. Ultimately, however, it must move on.\r\nThe moving on, or evolution, is continuous, but for convenience of\r\nexplanation we shall speak of it as though it occurred in steps.\r\nTwo possible motives for change can be imagined, (1) the supply of\r\nsubatomic energy might fall off by exhaustion and no longer balance the\r\nradiation, and (2) the sun is slowly becoming a star of smaller mass.\r\nIn former theories the first motive has generally been assumed, and we\r\nmay still regard it as effective during the giant stage of the stars;\r\nbut it is clear that the motive to move down the main series must be\r\nloss of mass.[37] Apparently the distinction between giant and dwarf\r\nstars, replacing the old distinction of perfect and imperfect gas, is\r\nthat the prolific and soon exhausted supplies of subatomic energy in\r\nthe giant stage disappear and leave a much steadier supply in the dwarf\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun has become a star of smaller mass it will need to resettle\r\nits internal conditions. Suppose that at first it tries to retain its\r\npresent density. As explained on p. 12, we can calculate the internal\r\ntemperature, and we find that the reduced mass coupled with constant\r\ndensity involves lower temperature. This will slightly turn off the\r\ntap of subatomic energy, because there can be little doubt that the\r\nrelease of subatomic energy is more rapid at higher temperature. The\r\nreduced supply will no longer be sufficient to balance the radiation;\r\naccordingly the star will contract just as it was supposed to do\r\non the old contraction hypothesis which corresponds to the tap of\r\nsubatomic energy being turned off altogether. The motive is loss of\r\nmass; the first consequence is an increase of density which is another\r\ncharacteristic of progress down the main series.\r\n\r\nTracing the consequences a little farther, the increasing density\r\ncauses a rising temperature which in turn reopens the tap of subatomic\r\nenergy. As soon as the tap is opened enough to balance the rate of\r\nradiation of the star, the contraction stops and the star remains\r\nsettled in equilibrium at the smaller mass and higher density.\r\n\r\nYou will see that the laws of release of subatomic energy must be\r\ninvoked if we are to explain quantitatively why a particular density\r\ncorresponds to a particular mass in the progress down the main series.\r\nThe contraction has to proceed so far as to bring the internal\r\nconditions to a state in which the release of energy is at the exact\r\nrate required to balance the radiation.\r\n\r\nI am afraid this all sounds very complicated, but my purpose is to\r\nshow that the adjustment of the star after an alteration of mass is\r\nautomatic. After a change of mass the star has to re-solve the problem\r\nof the internal conditions necessary for its equilibrium. So far as\r\nmechanical conditions are concerned (supporting the weight of the\r\nupper layers) it can choose any one of a series of states of different\r\ndensity provided it has the internal temperature appropriate to that\r\ndensity. But such equilibrium is only temporary, and the star will not\r\nreally settle down until the tap of subatomic energy is opened to the\r\nright extent to balance the rate of radiation which, as we have already\r\nseen, is practically fixed by the mass. The star fiddles about with the\r\ntap until it secures this balance.\r\n\r\nOne important conclusion has been pointed out by Professor\r\nRussell. When the star is adjusting the tap it does not do so\r\n_intelligently_; one trial must automatically lead to the next\r\ntrial, and it is all-important that the next trial should automatically\r\nbe nearer to and not farther from the right rate. The condition that it\r\nshall be nearer to the right rate is that the liberation of subatomic\r\nenergy shall increase with temperature or density.[38] If it decreases,\r\nor even if it is unaltered, the trials will be successively farther\r\nand farther from the required rate, so that although a steady balance\r\nis possible the star will never be able to find it. It is therefore\r\nessential to admit as one of the laws of liberation of subatomic energy\r\nthat the rate increases with temperature or with density or with both;\r\notherwise subatomic energy will not fulfil the purpose for which it was\r\nintroduced, viz. to keep the star steady for a very long time.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that the condition of balance is reached when the\r\ncentral temperature is near 40 million degrees--the same whether the\r\nstar is at the top, middle, or bottom of the main series. Stars at the\r\ntop release from each gramme of material 700 ergs of energy per second;\r\nthe sun releases 1 ergs per second; Krueger 60 releases 0·08 ergs per\r\nsecond. It seems extraordinary that stars requiring such different\r\nsupplies should all have to ascend to the same temperature to procure\r\nthem. It looks as though at temperatures below this standard not even\r\n0·08 ergs per second is available, but on reaching the standard the\r\nsupply is practically unlimited. We can scarcely believe that there is\r\na kind of boiling-point (independent of pressure) at which matter boils\r\noff into energy. The whole phenomenon is most perplexing.\r\n\r\nI may add that the giant stars have temperatures considerably below 40\r\nmillion degrees. It would appear that they are tapping special supplies\r\nof subatomic energy released at lower temperatures. After using up\r\nthese supplies the star passes on to the main series, and proceeds to\r\ntap the main supply. It seems necessary to suppose further that the\r\nmain supply does not last indefinitely, so that ultimately the star (or\r\nwhat is left of it) leaves the main series and passes on to the white\r\ndwarf stage.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to deal with a question which you may\r\nhave wished to ask earlier. Why does δ Cephei pulsate? One possible\r\nanswer is that the oscillation was started off by some accident.\r\nSo far as we can calculate an oscillation, if once started, would\r\ncontinue for something like 10,000 years before becoming damped down.\r\nBut 10,000 years is now deemed to be an insignificant period in the\r\nlife of a star, and, having regard to the abundance of Cepheids, the\r\nexplanation seems inadequate even if we could envisage the kind of\r\naccident supposed. It is much more likely that the pulsation arises\r\nspontaneously. Enormous supplies of heat energy are being released in\r\nthe star--far more than enough to start and maintain the pulsation--and\r\nthere are at least two alternative ways in which this heat can be\r\nsupposed to operate a mechanism of pulsation.\r\n\r\nHere is one alternative. Suppose first that there is a very small\r\npulsation. When compressed the star has higher temperature and density\r\nthan usual and the tap of subatomic energy is opened more fully. The\r\nstar gains heat, and the expansive force of the extra heat assists\r\nthe rebound from compression. At greatest expansion the tap is turned\r\noff a little and the loss of heat diminishes the resistance to the\r\nensuing compression. Thus the successive expansions and compressions\r\nbecome more and more vigorous and a large pulsation grows out of an\r\ninfinitesimal beginning. It will be seen that the star works the tap of\r\nsubatomic energy just as an engine works the valve admitting heat into\r\nits cylinder; so that the pulsations of a star are started up like the\r\npulsations of an engine.\r\n\r\nThe only objection that I can find to this explanation is that it\r\nis too successful. It shows why a star may be expected to pulsate;\r\nbut the trouble is that stars in general do not pulsate--it is only\r\nthe rare exceptions that behave in this way. It is now so easy to\r\naccount for the Cepheids that we have to turn back and face the more\r\ndifficult problem of accounting for the normal steady stars. Whether\r\nthe pulsation will start up or not depends on whether the engine of\r\npulsation is sufficiently powerful to overcome the forces tending to\r\ndamp out and dissipate pulsations. We cannot predict the occurrence\r\nor non-occurrence from any settled theory; we have rather to seek to\r\nframe the laws of release of subatomic energy so as to conform to our\r\nknowledge that the majority of the stars remain steady, but certain\r\nconditions of mass and density give the pulsatory forces the upper hand.\r\n\r\nCepheid pulsation is a kind of distemper which happens to stars at a\r\ncertain youthful period; after passing through it they burn steadily.\r\nThere may be another attack of disease later in life when the star is\r\nsubject to those catastrophic outbursts which occasion the appearance\r\nof ‘new stars’ or novae. But very little is known as to the conditions\r\nfor this, and it is not certain whether the outbreak is spontaneous or\r\nprovoked from outside.\r\n\r\nSo long as we stick to generalities the theory of subatomic energy\r\nand especially the theory of annihilation of matter makes a fairly\r\npromising opening. It is when we come to technical details that doubts\r\nand perplexities arise. Difficulties appear in the simultaneous\r\npresence of giant and dwarf stars in coeval clusters, notwithstanding\r\ntheir widely different rates of evolution. There are difficulties in\r\ndevising laws of release of subatomic energy which will safeguard the\r\nstability of the stars without setting every star into pulsation.\r\nDifficulties arise from the fact that as a rule in the giant stage the\r\nlower the temperature and density the more rapid the release of energy;\r\nand although we account for this in a general way by considering the\r\nexhaustibility of the more prolific sources of energy, the facts are\r\nnot all straightened out by such a scheme. Finally grave difficulties\r\narise in reconciling the laws of release inferred from astronomical\r\nobservation with any theoretical picture we can form of the process\r\nof annihilation of matter by the interplay of atoms, electrons, and\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\nThe subject is highly important, but we cannot very well pursue it\r\nfurther in this lecture. When the guidance of theory is clear interest\r\ncentres round the broad principles; when the theory is rudimentary,\r\ninterest centres round technical details which are anxiously\r\nscrutinized as they appear to favour now one view now another. I have\r\ndealt mainly with two salient points--the problem of the source of a\r\nstar’s energy and the change of mass which must occur if there is any\r\nevolution of faint stars from bright stars. I have shown how these\r\nappear to meet in the hypothesis of annihilation of matter. I do not\r\nhold this as a secure conclusion. I hesitate even to advocate it as\r\nprobable, because there are many details which seem to me to throw\r\nconsiderable doubt on it, and I have formed a strong impression that\r\nthere must be some essential point which has not yet been grasped. I\r\nsimply tell it you as the clue which at the moment we are trying to\r\nfollow up--not knowing whether it is false scent or true.\r\n\r\nI should have liked to have closed these lectures by leading up to\r\nsome great climax. But perhaps it is more in accordance with the\r\ntrue conditions of scientific progress that they should fizzle out\r\nwith a glimpse of the obscurity which marks the frontiers of present\r\nknowledge. I do not apologize for the lameness of the conclusion, for\r\nit is not a conclusion. I wish I could feel confident that it is even a\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fig. 1 is from a photograph taken by Mr. Evershed at\r\nKodaikanal Observatory, Madras.

But the observational\r\nevidence indicates that these individual differences are small. The\r\nmain series is nearly a linear sequence; it must have some ‘breadth’ as\r\nwell as ‘length’, but at present the scatter of the individual stars\r\naway from the central line of the sequence seems to be due chiefly to\r\nthe probable errors of the observational data and the true breadth has\r\nnot been determined.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Exhaustion of supply without change of mass would\r\ncause the star to contract to higher density; it would thus have a\r\ncombination of density and mass which (according to observation) is not\r\nfound in any actual stars.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: This increase was assumed in our detailed description of\r\nthe automatic adjustment of the star, and it will be seen that it was\r\nessential to assume it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX\r\n\r\n             _Further Remarks on the Companion of Sirius_\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE preferred not to complicate the Story of the Companion of\r\nSirius with details of a technical kind; some further information may,\r\ntherefore, be welcome to those readers who are curious to learn as much\r\nas possible about this remarkable star. I am also able to add a further\r\ninstalment of the ‘detective story’ which has just come to hand, the\r\nsleuth this time being Mr. R. H. Fowler.\r\n\r\nThe star is between the eighth and ninth magnitude, so that it is not\r\nan excessively faint object. The difficulty in detecting it arises\r\nentirely from the overpowering light of its neighbour. At favourable\r\nepochs it has been seen easily with an 8-inch telescope. The period of\r\nrevolution is 49 years.\r\n\r\nThe Companion is separated from Sirius by a distance nearly equal\r\nto the distance of Uranus from the Sun--or twenty times the earth’s\r\ndistance from the sun. It has been suggested that the light might be\r\nreflected light from Sirius. This would account for its whiteness, but\r\nwould not directly account for its spectrum, which differs appreciably\r\nfrom that of Sirius. To reflect ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀th of the light of Sirius (its\r\nactual brightness) the Companion would have to be 74 million miles in\r\ndiameter. The apparent diameter of its disk would be 0\"·3, which, one\r\nwould think, could scarcely escape notice in spite of unfavourable\r\nconditions of observation. But the strongest objection to this\r\nhypothesis of reflected light is that it applies only to this one star.\r\nThe other two recognized white dwarfs have no brilliant star in their\r\nneighbourhood, so that they cannot be shining by reflected light. It\r\nis scarcely worth while to invent an elaborate explanation for one of\r\nthese strange objects which does not cover the other two.\r\n\r\nThe Einstein effect, which is appealed to for confirmation of the high\r\ndensity, is a lengthening of the wave-length and corresponding decrease\r\nof the frequency of the light due to the intense gravitational field\r\nthrough which the rays have to pass. Consequently the dark lines in the\r\nspectrum appear at longer wave-lengths, i.e. displaced towards the red\r\nas compared with the corresponding terrestrial lines. The effect can be\r\ndeduced either from the relativity theory of gravitation or from the\r\nquantum theory; for those who have some acquaintance with the quantum\r\ntheory the following reasoning is probably the simplest. The stellar\r\natom emits the same quantum of energy hν as a terrestrial atom, but\r\nthis quantum has to use up some of its energy in order to escape from\r\nthe attraction of the star; the energy of escape is equal to the mass\r\nhν/c^2 multiplied by the gravitational potential Φ at the surface of\r\nthe star. Accordingly the reduced energy after escape is hν(1 - Φ/c^2);\r\nand since this must still form a quantum hν', the frequency has to\r\nchange to a value ν' = ν(1 - Φ/c^2). Thus the displacement ν' - ν is\r\nproportional to Φ, i.e. to the mass divided by the radius of the star.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the spectrum resembles the Doppler effect of a velocity\r\nof recession, and can therefore only be discriminated if we know\r\nalready the line-of-sight velocity. In the case of a double star the\r\nvelocity is known from observation of the other component of the\r\nsystem, so that the part of the displacement attributable to Doppler\r\neffect is known. Owing to orbital motion there is a difference of\r\nvelocity between Sirius and its Companion amounting at present to 43\r\nkm. per sec. and this has been duly taken into account; the observed\r\ndifference in position of the spectral lines of Sirius and its\r\nCompanion corresponds to a velocity of 23 km. per sec. of which 4 km.\r\nper sec. is attributable to orbital motion, and the remaining 19 km.\r\nper sec. must be interpreted as Einstein effect. The result rests\r\nmainly on measurements of one spectral line H_β. The other\r\nfavourable lines are in the bluer part of the spectrum, and since\r\natmospheric scattering increases with blueness, the scattered light\r\nof Sirius interferes. However, they afford some useful confirmatory\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nOf the other white dwarfs ο^2 Eridani is a double star, its companion\r\nbeing a red dwarf fainter than itself. The red shift of the spectrum\r\nwill be smaller than in the Companion of Sirius and it will not\r\nbe so easy to separate it from various possible sources of error.\r\nNevertheless the prospect is not hopeless. The other recognized white\r\ndwarf is an unnamed star discovered by Van Maanen; it is a solitary\r\nstar, and consequently there is no means of distinguishing between\r\nEinstein shift and Doppler shift. Various other stars have been\r\nsuspected of being in this condition, including the Companions of\r\nProcyon, 85 Pegasi, and Mira Ceti.\r\n\r\nIf the Companion of Sirius were a perfect gas its central temperature\r\nwould be about 1,000,000,000°, and the central part of the star would\r\nbe a million times as dense as water. It is, however, unlikely that the\r\ncondition of a perfect gas continues to hold. It should be understood\r\nthat in any case the density will fall off towards the outside of the\r\nstar, and the regions which we _observe_ are entirely normal. The\r\ndense material is tucked away under high pressure in the interior.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most puzzling feature that remains is the extraordinary\r\ndifference of development between Sirius and its Companion, which must\r\nboth have originated at the same time. Owing to the radiation of mass\r\nthe age of Sirius must be less than a billion years; an initial mass,\r\nhowever large, would radiate itself down to less than the present mass\r\nof Sirius within a billion years. But such a period is insignificant\r\nin the evolution of a small star which radiates more slowly, and it\r\nis difficult to see why the Companion should have already left the\r\nmain series and gone on to this (presumably) later stage. This is\r\nakin to other difficulties in the problem of stellar evolution, and I\r\nfeel convinced that there is something of fundamental importance that\r\nremains undiscovered.\r\n\r\nUntil recently I have felt that there was a serious (or, if you like,\r\na comic) difficulty about the ultimate fate of the white dwarfs.\r\nTheir high density is only possible because of the smashing of the\r\natoms, which in turn depends on the high temperature. It does not seem\r\npermissible to suppose that the matter can remain in this compressed\r\nstate if the temperature falls. We may look forward to a time when the\r\nsupply of subatomic energy fails and there is nothing to maintain the\r\nhigh temperature; then on cooling down, the material will return to\r\nthe normal density of terrestrial solids. The star must, therefore,\r\nexpand, and in order to regain a density a thousandfold less the radius\r\nmust expand tenfold. Energy will be required in order to force out\r\nthe material against gravity. Where is this energy to come from? An\r\nordinary star has not enough heat energy inside it to be able to expand\r\nagainst gravitation to this extent; and the white dwarf can scarcely be\r\nsupposed to have had sufficient foresight to make special provision for\r\nthis remote demand. Thus the star may be in an awkward predicament--it\r\nwill be losing heat continually _but will not have enough energy to\r\ncool down_.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for avoiding this dilemma is like the device of a\r\nnovelist who brings his characters into such a mess that the only\r\nsolution is to kill them off. We might assume that subatomic energy\r\nwill never cease to be liberated until it has removed the whole\r\nmass--or at least conducted the star out of the white dwarf condition.\r\nBut this scarcely meets the difficulty; the theory ought in some way to\r\nguard automatically against an impossible predicament, and not to rely\r\non disconnected properties of matter to protect the actual stars from\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe whole difficulty seems, however, to have been removed in a recent\r\ninvestigation by R. H. Fowler. He concludes unexpectedly that the\r\ndense matter of the Companion of Sirius has an ample store of energy\r\nto provide for the expansion. The interesting point is that his\r\nsolution invokes some of the most recent developments of the quantum\r\ntheory--the ‘new statistics’ of Einstein and Bose and the wave-theory\r\nof Schrödinger. It is a curious coincidence that about the time that\r\nthis matter of transcendently high density was engaging the attention\r\nof astronomers, the physicists were developing a new theory of matter\r\nwhich specially concerns high density. According to this theory matter\r\nhas certain wave properties which barely come into play at terrestrial\r\ndensities; but they are of serious importance at densities such as that\r\nof the Companion of Sirius. It was in considering these properties\r\nthat Fowler came upon the store of energy that solves our difficulty;\r\nthe classical theory of matter gives no indication of it. The white\r\ndwarf appears to be a happy hunting ground for the most revolutionary\r\ndevelopments of theoretical physics.\r\n\r\nTo gain some idea of the new theory of dense matter we can begin by\r\nreferring to the photograph of the Balmer Series in Fig. 9. This shows\r\nthe light radiated by a large number of hydrogen atoms in all possible\r\nstates up to No. 30 in the proportions in which they occur naturally in\r\nthe sun’s chromosphere. The old-style electromagnetic theory predicted\r\nthat electrons moving in curved paths would radiate continuous\r\nlight; and the old-style statistical theory predicted the relative\r\nabundance of orbits of different sizes, so that the distribution\r\nof light along this continuous spectrum could be calculated. These\r\npredictions are wrong and do not give the distribution of light shown\r\nin the photograph; _but they become less glaringly wrong as we draw\r\nnear to the head of the series_. The later lines of the series\r\ncrowd together and presently become so close as to be practically\r\nindistinguishable from continuous light. Thus the classical prediction\r\nof continuous spectrum is becoming approximately true; simultaneously\r\nthe classical prediction of its intensity approaches the truth. There\r\nis a famous Correspondence Principle enunciated by Bohr which asserts\r\nthat for states of very high number the new quantum laws merge into the\r\nold classical laws. If we never have to consider states of low number\r\nit is indifferent whether we calculate the radiation or statistics\r\naccording to the old laws or the new.\r\n\r\nIn high-numbered states the electron is for most of the time far\r\ndistant from the nucleus. Continuous proximity to the nucleus indicates\r\na low-numbered state. Must we not expect, then, that in extremely\r\ndense matter the continuous proximity of the particles will give\r\nrise to phenomena characteristic of low-numbered states? There is\r\nno real discontinuity between the organization of the atom and the\r\norganization of the star; the ties which bind the particles in the\r\natom, bind also more extended groups of particles and eventually the\r\nwhole star. So long as these ties are of high quantum number, the\r\nalternative conception is sufficiently nearly valid which represents\r\nthe interactions by forces after the classical fashion and takes no\r\ncognizance of ‘states’. For very high density there is no alternative\r\nconception, and we must think not in terms of force, velocity, and\r\ndistribution of independent particles, but in terms of states.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this breakdown of the classical conception can best\r\nbe seen by passing at once to the final limit when the star becomes\r\na single system or molecule in state No. 1. Like an excited atom\r\ncollapsing with discontinuous jumps such as those which give the\r\nBalmer Series, the star with a few last gasps of radiation will reach\r\nthe limiting state which has no state beyond. This does not mean that\r\nfurther contraction is barred by the ultimate particles jamming in\r\ncontact, any more than collapse of the hydrogen atom is barred by\r\nthe electron jamming against the proton; progress is stopped because\r\nthe star has got back to the first of an integral series of possible\r\nconditions of a material system. A hydrogen atom in state No. 1 cannot\r\nradiate; nevertheless its electron is moving with high kinetic energy.\r\nSimilarly a star when it has reached state No. 1 no longer radiates;\r\nnevertheless its particles are moving with extremely great energy.\r\nWhat is its temperature? If you measure temperature by radiating power\r\nits temperature is absolute zero, since the radiation is nil; if you\r\nmeasure temperature by the average speed of molecules its temperature\r\nis the highest attainable by matter. The final fate of the white dwarf\r\nis to become at the same time the hottest and the coldest matter in\r\nthe universe. Our difficulty is doubly solved. Because the star is\r\nintensely hot it has enough energy to cool down if it wants to; because\r\nit is so intensely cold it has stopped radiating and no longer wants to\r\ngrow any colder.\r\n\r\nWe have described what is believed to be the final state of the white\r\ndwarf and perhaps therefore of every star. The Companion of Sirius\r\nhas not yet reached this state, but it is so far on the way that the\r\nclassical treatment is already inadmissible. If any stars have reached\r\nstate No. 1 they are invisible; like atoms in the normal (lowest) state\r\nthey give no light. The binding of the atom which defies the classical\r\nconception of forces has extended to cover the star. I little imagined\r\nwhen this survey of Stars and Atoms was begun that it would end with a\r\nglimpse of a Star-Atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed in England at the_ OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS\r\n_by John Johnson Printer to the University_",
