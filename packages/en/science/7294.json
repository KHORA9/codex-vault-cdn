W.\r\nGREELY, DATED MALSHERBE, OCTOBER 23, 1920\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR GENERAL:\r\n\r\n   Colonel Ardant du Picq was the exponent of _moral force_, the\r\n   most powerful element in the strength of armies. He has shown it to\r\n   be the preponderating influence in the outcome of battles.\r\n\r\n   Your son has accomplished a very valuable work in translating his\r\n   writings. One finds his conclusions amply verified in the\r\n   experience of the American Army during the last war, notably in the\r\n   campaign of 1918.\r\n\r\n   Accept, my dear General, my best regards.\r\n   F. FOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nBY FRANK H. SIMONDS\r\nAuthor of \"History of the World War,\" \"'They Shall Not Pass'--Verdun,\"\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting to the American reading public a translation of a volume\r\nwritten by an obscure French colonel, belonging to a defeated army, who\r\nfell on the eve of a battle which not alone gave France over to the\r\nenemy but disclosed a leadership so inapt as to awaken the suspicion\r\nof treason, one is faced by the inevitable interrogation--\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nYet the answer is simple. The value of the book of Ardant du Picq lies\r\nprecisely in the fact that it contains not alone the unmistakable\r\nforecast of the defeat, itself, but a luminous statement of those\r\nfundamental principles, the neglect of which led to Gravelotte and\r\nSedan.\r\n\r\nNapoleon has said that in war the moral element is to all others as\r\nthree is to one. Moreover, as du Picq impressively demonstrates, while\r\nall other circumstances change with time, the human element remains\r\nthe same, capable of just so much endurance, sacrifice, effort, and no\r\nmore. Thus, from Caesar to Foch, the essential factor in war endures\r\nunmodified.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not the value of du Picq's book, as an explanation of the\r\ndisasters of 1870, but of the triumphs of 1914-18, which gives it\r\npresent and permanent interest. It is not as the forecast of why\r\nBazaine, a type of all French commanders of the Franco-Prussian War,\r\nwill fail, but why Foch, Joffre, Petain will succeed, that the volume\r\ninvites reading to-day.\r\n\r\nBeyond all else, the arresting circumstances in the fragmentary pages,\r\nperfect in themselves but incomplete in the conception of their\r\nauthor, is the intellectual and the moral kinship they reveal between\r\nthe soldier who fell just before the crowning humiliation of\r\nGravelotte and the victor of Fere Champenoise, the Yser and the\r\ncolossal conflict of 1918 to which historians have already applied the\r\nname of the Battle of France, rightly to suggest its magnitude.\r\n\r\nRead the hastily compiled lectures of Foch, the teacher of the Ecole\r\nde Guerre, recall the fugitive but impressive words of Foch, the\r\nsoldier, uttered on the spur of the moment, filled with homely phrase,\r\nand piquant figure and underlying all, one encounters the same\r\nintegral conception of war and of the relation of the moral to the\r\nphysical, which fills the all too scanty pages of du Picq.\r\n\r\n\"For me as a soldier,\" writes du Picq, \"the smallest detail caught on\r\nthe spot and in the heat of action is more instructive than all the\r\nThiers and the Jominis in the world.\" Compare this with Foch\r\nexplaining to his friend Andre de Mariecourt, his own emotions at the\r\ncritical hour at Fere Champenoise, when he had to invent something new\r\nto beguile soldiers who had retreated for weeks and been beaten for\r\ndays. His tactical problem remained unchanged, but he must give his\r\nsoldiers, tired with being beaten to the \"old tune\" a new air, which\r\nwould appeal to them as new, something to which they had not been\r\nbeaten, and the same philosophy appears.\r\n\r\nDu Picq's contemporaries neglected his warning, they saw only the\r\noutward circumstances of the Napoleonic and Frederican successes. In\r\nvain du Picq warned them that the victories of Frederick were not the\r\nlogical outgrowth of the minutiae of the Potsdam parades. But du Picq\r\ndead, the Third Empire fallen, France prostrated but not annihilated\r\nby the defeats of 1870, a new generation emerged, of which Foch was\r\nbut the last and most shining example. And this generation went back,\r\npowerfully aided by the words of du Picq, to that older tradition, to\r\nthe immutable principles of war.\r\n\r\nWith surprising exactness du Picq, speaking in the abstract, foretold\r\nan engagement in which the mistakes of the enemy would be\r\ncounterbalanced by their energy in the face of French passivity, lack\r\nof any control conception. Forty years later in the Ecole de Guerre,\r\nFoch explained the reasons why the strategy of Moltke, mistaken in all\r\nrespects, failed to meet the ruin it deserved, only because at\r\nGravelotte Bazaine could not make up his mind, solely because of the\r\nabsence in French High Command of precisely that \"Creed of Combat\" the\r\nlack of which du Picq deplored.\r\n\r\nOf the value of du Picq's work to the professional soldier, I\r\nnaturally cannot speak, but even for the civilian, the student of\r\nmilitary events, of war and of the larger as well as the smaller\r\ncircumstances of battle, its usefulness can hardly be exaggerated.\r\nReading it one understands something, at least of the soul as well as\r\nthe science of combat, the great defeats and the great victories of\r\nhistory seem more intelligible in simple terms of human beings. Beyond\r\nthis lies the contemporaneous value due to the fact that nowhere can\r\none better understand Foch than through the reading of du Picq.\r\n\r\nBy translating this volume of du Picq and thus making it available for\r\nan American audience whose interest has been inevitably stirred by\r\nrecent events, the translators have done a public as well as a\r\nprofessional service. Both officers enjoyed exceptional opportunities\r\nand experiences on the Western front. Col. Greely from Cantigny to the\r\nclose of the battle of the Meuse-Argonne was not only frequently\r\nassociated with the French army, but as Chief of Staff of our own\r\nFirst Division, gained a direct knowledge of the facts of battle,\r\nequal to that of du Picq, himself.\r\n\r\nOn the professional side the service is obvious, since before the last\r\nwar the weakness of the American like the British Army, a weakness\r\ninevitable, given our isolation, lay in the absence of adequate study\r\nof the higher branches of military science and thus the absence of\r\nsuch a body of highly skilled professional soldiers, as constituted\r\nthe French or German General Staff. The present volume is a clear\r\nevidence that American officers themselves have voluntarily undertaken\r\nto make good this lack.\r\n\r\nOn the non-professional side and for the general reader, the service\r\nis hardly less considerable, since it supplies the least technically\r\ninformed with a simply comprehensible explanation of things which\r\nalmost every one has struggled to grasp and visualize during the last\r\nsix years extending from the battle of Marne in 1914 to that of the\r\nVistula in 1920.\r\n\r\nOf the truth of this latter assertion, a single example will perhaps\r\nsuffice. Every forthcoming military study of the campaign of 1914\r\nemphasizes with renewed energy the fact that underlying all the German\r\nconceptions of the opening operations was the purpose to repeat the\r\nachievement of Hannibal at Cannae, by bringing the French to battle\r\nunder conditions which should, on a colossal scale, reproduce those of\r\nHannibal's greatest victory. But nowhere better than in du Picq's\r\nvolume, are set forth the essential circumstances of the combat which,\r\nafter two thousand years gave to Field Marshal von Schlieffen the root\r\nideas for the strategy expressed in the first six weeks of 1914. And,\r\nas a final observation, nowhere better than in du Picq's account, can\r\none find the explanation of why the younger Moltke failed in executing\r\nthose plans which gave Hannibal one of the most shining triumphs in\r\nall antiquity.\r\n\r\nThus, although he died in 1870, du Picq lives, through his book, as\r\none of the most useful guides to a proper understanding of a war\r\nfought nearly half a century later.\r\n\r\nFRANK H. SIMONDS.\r\n\r\nSnowville, New Hampshire,\r\nOctober 15, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATORS' NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Ardant du Picq's \"Battle Studies\" is a French military\r\nclassic. It is known to every French army officer; it is referred to\r\nas an established authority in such works as Marshal Foch's \"The\r\nPrinciples of War.\" It has been eagerly read in the original by such\r\nAmerican army officers as have chanced upon it; probably only the\r\nscarcity of thinking men with military training has precluded the\r\nearlier appearance of an American edition.\r\n\r\nThe translators feel that the war with Germany which brought with it\r\nsome military training for all the best brains of the country has\r\nprepared the field for an American edition of this book. They are sure\r\nthat every American reader who has had actual battle experience in any\r\ncapacity will at some point say to himself, \"That is absolutely\r\ntrue....\" or, \"That reminds me of the day....\"\r\n\r\nAppendices II, III, IV, and V, appearing in the edition from which\r\nthis translation is made, deal with issues and military questions\r\nentirely French and not of general application. They are therefore not\r\nconsidered as being of sufficient interest to be reproduced herein.\r\nAppendix VI of the original appears herein as Appendix II.\r\n\r\nThe translation is unpretentious. The translators are content to\r\nexhibit such a work to the American military public without changing\r\nits poignancy and originality. They hope that readers will enjoy it as\r\nmuch as they have themselves.\r\n\r\nJ. N. G.\r\n\r\nR. C. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe present to the public the complete works of Colonel Ardant du Picq,\r\narranged according to the plan of the author, enlarged by unpublished\r\nfragments and documents.\r\n\r\nThese unpublished documents are partially known by those who have read\r\n\"Studies on Combat\" (Hachette & Dumaine, 1880). A second edition was\r\ncalled for after a considerable time. It has left ineffaceable traces\r\nin the minds of thinking men with experience. By its beauty and the\r\nvigor of its teachings, it has created in a faithful school of\r\ndisciples a tradition of correct ideas.\r\n\r\nFor those familiar with the work, there is no need for emphasizing the\r\nimportance and usefulness of this rejuvenated publication. In it they\r\nwill find new sources of interest, which will confirm their admiration\r\nfor the author.\r\n\r\nThey will also rejoice in the popularity of their teacher, already\r\nhighly regarded in the eyes of his profession on account of his\r\npresentation of conclusions, the truth of which grows with years. His\r\nwork merits widespread attention. It would be an error to leave it in\r\nthe exclusive possession of special writers and military technicians.\r\nIn language which is equal in power and pathetic beauty, it should\r\ncarry its light much further and address itself to all readers who\r\nenjoy solid thought. Their ideas broadened, they will, without fail,\r\njoin those already initiated.\r\n\r\nNo one can glance over these pages with indifference. No one can fail\r\nto be moved by the strong and substantial intellect they reveal. No\r\none can fail to feel their profound depths. To facilitate treatment of\r\na subject which presents certain difficulties, we shall confine\r\nourselves to a succinct explanation of its essential elements, the\r\ngeneral conception that unites them, and the purpose of the author.\r\nBut we must not forget the dramatic mutilation of the work\r\nunfortunately never completed because of the glorious death of Ardant\r\ndu Picq.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Ardant du Picq was killed near Metz in 1870 by a Prussian\r\nshell, he left works that divide themselves into two well-defined\r\ncategories:\r\n\r\n(1) Completed works:\r\n\r\n   Pamphlet (printed in 1868 but not intended for sale), which forms\r\n   the first part of the present edition: Ancient Battle.\r\n\r\n   A series of memoirs and studies written in 1865. These are partly\r\n   reproduced in Appendices I and II herein.\r\n\r\n(2) Notes jotted down on paper, sometimes developed into complete\r\n   chapters not requiring additions or revision, but sometimes\r\n   abridged and drawn up in haste. They reveal a brain completely\r\n   filled with its subject, perpetually working, noting a trait in a\r\n   rapid phrase, in a vibrating paragraph, in observations and\r\n   recollections that a future revision was to compile, unite and\r\n   complete.\r\n\r\n   The collection of these notes forms the second part: Modern Battle.\r\n\r\n   These notes were inspired by certain studies or memoirs which are\r\n   presented in Appendices I-V, and a Study on Combat, with which the\r\n   Colonel was occupied, and of which we gave a sketch at the end of\r\n   the pamphlet of 1868. He himself started research among the\r\n   officers of his acquaintance, superiors, equals or subordinates,\r\n   who had served in war. This occupied a great part of his life.\r\n\r\nIn order to collect from these officers, without change or\r\nmisrepresentation, statements of their experiences while leading their\r\nmen in battle or in their divers contacts with the enemy, he sent to\r\neach one a questionnaire, in the form of a circular. The reproduction\r\nherein is from the copy which was intended for General Lafont de\r\nVilliers, commanding the 21st Division at Limoges. It is impossible to\r\nover-emphasize the great value of this document which gives the key to\r\nthe constant meditations of Ardant du Picq, the key to the reforms\r\nwhich his methodical and logical mind foresaw. It expounds a principle\r\nfounded upon exact facts faithfully stated. His entire work, in\r\nembryo, can be seen between the lines of the questionnaire. This was\r\nhis first attempt at reaction against the universal routine\r\nsurrounding him.\r\n\r\nFrom among the replies which he received and which his family\r\ncarefully preserved, we have extracted the most conclusive. They will\r\nbe found in Appendix II--Historical Documents. Brought to light, at\r\nthe urgent request of the author, they complete the book,\r\ncorroborating statements by examples. They illuminate his doctrines by\r\nauthentic historical depositions.\r\n\r\nIn arranging this edition we are guided solely by the absolute respect\r\nwhich we have for the genius of Ardant du Picq. We have endeavored to\r\nreproduce his papers in their entirety, without removing or adding\r\nanything. Certain disconnected portions have an inspired and fiery\r\ntouch which would be lessened by the superfluous finish of an attempt\r\nat editing. Some repetitions are to be found; they show that the\r\nappendices were the basis for the second part of the volume, Modern\r\nBattle. It may be stated that the work, suddenly halted in 1870,\r\ncontains criticisms, on the staff for instance, which aim at radical\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nERNEST JUDET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRONTISPIECE--PORTRAIT OF COLONEL ARDANT DU PICQ\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA MILITARY THINKER\r\n\r\nRECORD OF MILITARY SERVICE OF COLONEL ARDANT DU PICQ\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE HISTORY OF THE 10TH INFANTRY REGIMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ONE: ANCIENT BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\nI   MAN IN PRIMITIVE AND ANCIENT COMBAT\r\n\r\nII  KNOWLEDGE OF MAN MADE ROMAN TACTICS; THE SUCCESSES OF HANNIBAL;\r\n    THOSE OF CAESAR\r\n\r\nIII ANALYSIS OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE\r\n\r\nIV  ANALYSIS OF THE BATTLE OF PHARSALUS AND SOME CHARACTERISTIC\r\n    EXAMPLES\r\n\r\nV   MORALE IN ANCIENT BATTLE\r\n\r\nVI  HOW REAL COMBATANTS ARE OBTAINED AND HOW THE FIGHTING OF TO-DAY\r\n    REQUIRES THEM TO BE MORE DEPENDABLE THAN IN ANCIENT BATTLE\r\n\r\nVII PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY AND WHAT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE IT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO: MODERN BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI   GENERAL DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n    1.

The obscure gunner never knew that he had\r\ndone away with one of the most intelligent officers of our army, one\r\nof the most forceful writers, one of the most clear-sighted\r\nphilosophers whom sovereign genius had ever created.\r\n\r\nArdant du Picq, according to the Annual Register, commanded but a\r\nregiment. He was fitted for the first rank of the most exalted. He\r\nfell at the hour when France was thrown into frightful chaos, when all\r\nthat he had foreseen, predicted and dreaded, was being terribly\r\nfulfilled. New ideas, of which he was the unknown trustee and\r\nunacknowledged prophet, triumphed then at our expense. The disaster\r\nthat carried with it his sincere and revivifying spirit, left in the\r\ntomb of our decimated divisions an evidence of the necessity for\r\nreform. When our warlike institutions were perishing from the lack of\r\nthought, he represented in all its greatness the true type of military\r\nthinker. The virile thought of a military thinker alone brings forth\r\nsuccesses and maintains victorious nations. Fatal indolence brought\r\nabout the invasion, the loss of two provinces, the bog of moral\r\nmiseries and social evils which beset vanquished States.\r\n\r\nThe heart and brain of Ardant du Picq guarded faithfully a worthy but\r\ndiscredited cult. Too frequently in the course of our history virtues\r\nare forsaken during long periods, when it seems that the entire race\r\nis hopelessly abased. The mass perceives too late in rare individuals\r\ncertain wasted talents--treasures of sagacity, spiritual vigor, heroic\r\nand almost supernatural comprehension. Such men are prodigious\r\nexceptions in times of material decadence and mental laxness. They\r\ninherit all the qualities that have long since ceased to be current.\r\nThey serve as examples and rallying points for other generations, more\r\nclear-sighted and less degenerate. On reading over the extraordinary\r\nwork of Ardant du Picq, that brilliant star in the eclipse of our\r\nmilitary faculties, I think of the fatal shot that carried him off\r\nbefore full use had been found for him, and I am struck by melancholy.\r\nOur fall appears more poignant. His premature end seems a punishment\r\nfor his contemporaries, a bitter but just reproach.\r\n\r\nFortunately, more honored and believed in by his successors, his once\r\nunappreciated teaching contributes largely to the uplift and to the\r\neducation of our officers. They will be inspired by his original views\r\nand the permanent virtue contained therein. They will learn therefrom\r\nthe art of leading and training our young soldiers and can hope to\r\nretrieve the cruel losses of their predecessors.\r\n\r\nArdant du Picq amazes one by his tenacity and will power which,\r\nwithout the least support from the outside, animate him under the\r\ntrying conditions of his period of isolated effort.\r\n\r\nIn an army in which most of the seniors disdained the future and\r\nneglected their responsibilities, rested satisfied on the laurels of\r\nformer campaigns and relied on superannuated theories and the\r\nexercises of a poor parade, scorned foreign organizations and believed\r\nin an acquired and constant superiority that dispenses with all work,\r\nand did not suspect even the radical transformations which the\r\ndevelopment of rifles and rapid-fire artillery entail; Ardant du Picq\r\nworked for the common good. In his modest retreat, far from the\r\npinnacles of glory, he tended a solitary shrine of unceasing activity\r\nand noble effort. He burned with the passions which ought to have\r\nmoved the staff and higher commanders. He watched while his\r\ncontemporaries slept.\r\n\r\nToward the existing system of instruction and preparation which the\r\nfirst blow shattered, his incorruptible honesty prevented him from\r\nbeing indulgent. While terrified leaders passed from arrogance or\r\nthoughtlessness to dejection and confusion, the blow was being struck.\r\nServed by his marvelous historical gifts, he studied the laws of\r\nancient combat in the poorly interpreted but innumerable documents of\r\nthe past. Then, guided by the immortal light which never failed, the\r\nfeverish curiosity of this soldier's mind turned towards the research\r\nof the laws of modern combat, the subject of his preference. In this\r\nstudy he developed to perfection his psychological attainments. By the\r\nuse of these attainments he simplified the theory of the conduct of\r\nwar. By dissecting the motor nerves of the human heart, he released\r\nbasic data on the essential principles of combat. He discovered the\r\nsecret of combat, the way to victory.\r\n\r\nNever for a second did Ardant du Picq forget that combat is the\r\nobject, the cause of being, the supreme manifestation of armies. Every\r\nmeasure which departs therefrom, which relegates it to the middle\r\nground is deceitful, chimerical, fatal. All the resources accumulated\r\nin time of peace, all the tactical evolutions, all the strategical\r\ncalculations are but conveniences, drills, reference marks to lead up\r\nto it. His obsession was so overpowering that his presentation of it\r\nwill last as long as history. This obsession is the role of man in\r\ncombat. Man is the incomparable instrument whose elements, character,\r\nenergies, sentiments, fears, desires, and instincts are stronger than\r\nall abstract rules, than all bookish theories. War is still more of an\r\nart than a science. The inspirations which reveal and mark the great\r\nstrategists, the leaders of men, form the unforeseen element, the\r\ndivine part. Generals of genius draw from the human heart ability to\r\nexecute a surprising variety of movements which vary the routine; the\r\nmediocre ones, who have no eyes to read readily therein, are doomed to\r\nthe worst errors.\r\n\r\nArdant du Picq, haunted by the need of a doctrine which would correct\r\nexisting evils and disorders, was continually returning to the\r\nfountain-head. Anxious to instruct promising officers, to temper them\r\nby irrefutable lessons, to mature them more rapidly, to inspire them\r\nwith his zeal for historical incidents, he resolved to carry on and\r\nadd to his personal studies while aiding them. Daring to take a\r\ncourageous offensive against the general inertia of the period, he\r\ntranslated the problem of his whole life into a series of basic\r\nquestions. He presented in their most diverse aspects, the basic\r\nquestions which perplex all military men, those of which knowledge in\r\na varying degree of perfection distinguish and classify military men.\r\nThe nervous grasp of an incomparable style models each of them, carves\r\nthem with a certain harshness, communicates to them a fascinating yet\r\nunknown authority which crystallizes them in the mind, at the same\r\ntime giving to them a positive form that remains true for all armies,\r\nfor all past, present and future centuries. Herewith is the text of\r\nthe concise and pressing questions which have not ceased to be as\r\nimportant to-day (1902) as they were in 1870:\r\n\r\n\"_General_,\r\n\r\n\"In the last century, after the improvements of the rifle and field\r\nartillery by Frederick, and the Prussian successes in war--to-day,\r\nafter the improvement of the new rifle and cannon to which in part the\r\nrecent victories are due--we find all thinking men in the army asking\r\nthemselves the question: 'How shall we fight to-morrow?' We have no\r\ncreed on the subject of combat. And the most opposing methods confuse\r\nthe intelligence of military men.\r\n\r\n\"Why? A common error at the starting point. One might say that no one\r\nis willing to acknowledge that it is necessary to understand yesterday\r\nin order to know to-morrow, for the things of yesterday are nowhere\r\nplainly written. The lessons of yesterday exist solely in the memory\r\nof those who know how to remember because they have known how to see,\r\nand those individuals have never spoken. I make an appeal to one of\r\nthose.\r\n\r\n\"The smallest detail, taken from an actual incident in war, is more\r\ninstructive for me, a soldier, than all the Thiers and Jominis in the\r\nworld. They speak, no doubt, for the heads of states and armies but\r\nthey never show me what I wish to know--a battalion, a company, a\r\nsquad, in action.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning a regiment, a battalion, a company, a squad, it is\r\ninteresting to know: The disposition taken to meet the enemy or the\r\norder for the march toward them. What becomes of this disposition or\r\nthis march order under the isolated or combined influences of\r\naccidents of the terrain and the approach of danger?\r\n\r\n\"Is this order changed or is it continued in force when approaching\r\nthe enemy?\r\n\r\n\"What becomes of it upon arriving within the range of the guns, within\r\nthe range of bullets?\r\n\r\n\"At what distance is a voluntary or an ordered disposition taken\r\nbefore starting operations for commencing fire, for charging, or both?\r\n\r\n\"How did the fight start? How about the firing? How did the men adapt\r\nthemselves? (This may be learned from the results: So many bullets\r\nfired, so many men shot down--when such data are available.) How was\r\nthe charge made? At what distance did the enemy flee before it? At\r\nwhat distance did the charge fall back before the fire or the good\r\norder and good dispositions of the enemy, or before such and such a\r\nmovement of the enemy? What did it cost? What can be said about all\r\nthese with reference to the enemy?\r\n\r\n\"The behavior, i.e., the order, the disorder, the shouts, the\r\nsilence, the confusion, the calmness of the officers and men whether\r\nwith us or with the enemy, before, during, and after the combat?\r\n\r\n\"How has the soldier been controlled and directed during the action?\r\nAt what instant has he had a tendency to quit the line in order to\r\nremain behind or to rush ahead?\r\n\r\n\"At what moment, if the control were escaping from the leader's hands,\r\nhas it no longer been possible to exercise it?\r\n\r\n\"At what instant has this control escaped from the battalion\r\ncommander? When from the captain, the section leader, the squad\r\nleader? At what time, in short, if such a thing did take place, was\r\nthere but a disordered impulse, whether to the front or to the rear\r\ncarrying along pell-mell with it both the leaders and men?\r\n\r\n\"Where and when did the halt take place?\r\n\r\n\"Where and when were the leaders able to resume control of the men?\r\n\r\n\"At what moments before, during, or after the day, was the battalion\r\nroll-call, the company roll-call made? The results of these\r\nroll-calls?\r\n\r\n\"How many dead, how many wounded on the one side and on the other; the\r\nkind of wounds of the officers, non-commissioned officers, corporals,\r\nprivates, etc., etc.?\r\n\r\n\"All these details, in a word, enlighten either the material or the\r\nmoral side of the action, or enable it to be visualized. Possibly, a\r\ncloser examination might show that they are matters infinitely more\r\ninstructive to us as soldiers than all the discussions imaginable on\r\nthe plans and general conduct of the campaigns of the greatest captain\r\nin the great movements of the battle field. From colonel to private we\r\nare soldiers, not generals, and it is therefore our trade that we\r\ndesire to know.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly one cannot obtain all the details of the same incident. But\r\nfrom a series of true accounts there should emanate an ensemble of\r\ncharacteristic details which in themselves are very apt to show in a\r\nstriking, irrefutable way what was necessarily and forcibly taking\r\nplace at such and such a moment of an action in war. Take the estimate\r\nof the soldier obtained in this manner to serve as a base for what\r\nmight possibly be a rational method of fighting. It will put us on\r\nguard against _a priori_ and pedantic school methods.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever has seen, turns to a method based on his knowledge, his\r\npersonal experience as a soldier. But experience is long and life is\r\nshort. The experiences of each cannot therefore be completed except by\r\nthose of others.\r\n\r\n\"And that is why, General, I venture to address myself to you for your\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n\"Proofs have weight.\r\n\r\n\"As for the rest, whether it please you to aid or not, General, kindly\r\naccept the assurance of most respectful devotion from your obedient\r\nservant.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reading of this unique document is sufficient to explain the glory\r\nthat Ardant du Picq deserved. In no other career has a professional\r\never reflected more clearly the means of pushing his profession to\r\nperfection; in no profession has a deeper penetration of the resources\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nIt pleases me particularly to associate the two words 'penseur' and\r\n'militaire,' which, at the present time, the ignorance of preconceived\r\nopinion too frequently separates. Because such opinion is on the verge\r\nof believing them to be incompatible and contradictory.\r\n\r\nYet no calling other than the true military profession is so fitted to\r\nexcite brain activity. It is preeminently the calling of action, at\r\nthe same time diverse in its combinations and changing according to\r\nthe time and locality wherein it is put to practice. No other\r\nprofession is more complex nor more difficult, since it has for its\r\naim and reason the instruction of men to overcome by training and\r\nendurance the fatigue and perils against which the voice of\r\nself-preservation is raised in fear; in other words, to draw from\r\nnature what is most opposed and most antipathic to this nature.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, much of routine in the customs of military life,\r\nand, abuse of it may bring about gross satires which in turn bring it\r\ninto derision. To be sure, the career has two phases because it must\r\nfulfill simultaneously two exigencies. From this persons of moderate\r\ncapacity draw back and are horrified. They solve the question by the\r\nsacrifice of the one or the other. If one considers only the lower and\r\nsomewhat vulgar aspect of military life it is found to be composed of\r\nmonotonous obligations clothed in a mechanical procedure of\r\nindispensable repetition. If one learns to grasp it in its ensemble\r\nand large perspective, it will be found that the days of extreme trial\r\ndemand prodigies of vigor, spirit, intelligence, and decision!\r\nRegarded from this angle and supported in this light, the commonplace\r\nthings of wearisome garrison life have as counterweights certain\r\nsublime compensations. These compensations preclude the false and\r\ncontemptible results which come from intellectual idleness and the\r\nhabit of absolute submission. If it yields to their narcotic charms,\r\nthe best brain grows rusty and atrophies in the long run. Incapable of\r\nvirile labor, it rebels at a renewal of its processes in sane\r\ninitiative. An army in which vigilance is not perpetual is sick until\r\nthe enemy demonstrates it to be dead.\r\n\r\nFar, then, from attaching routine as an indispensable companion to\r\nmilitary discipline it must be shown continually that in it lies\r\ndestruction and loss. Military discipline does not degenerate except\r\nwhen it has not known the cult of its vitality and the secret of its\r\ngrandeur. The teachers of war have all placed this truth as a preface\r\nto their triumphs and we find the most illustrious teachers to be the\r\nmost severe. Listen to this critique of Frederick the Great on the\r\nmaneuvers which he conducted in Silesia:\r\n\r\n\"The great mistake in inspections is that you officers amuse\r\nyourselves with God knows what buffooneries and never dream in the\r\nleast of serious service. This is a source of stupidity which would\r\nbecome most dangerous in case of a serious conflict. Take shoe-makers\r\nand tailors and make generals of them and they will not commit worse\r\nfollies! These blunders are made on a small as well as on a large\r\nscale. Consequently, in the greatest number of regiments, the private\r\nis not well trained; in Zaramba's regiment he is the worst; in\r\nThadden's he amounts to nothing; and to no more in Keller's, Erlach's,\r\nand Haager's. Why? Because the officers are lazy and try to get out of\r\na difficulty by giving themselves the least trouble possible.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn default of exceptional generals who remold in some campaigns, with\r\na superb stroke, the damaged or untempered military metal, it is of\r\nimportance to supply it with the ideals of Ardant du Picq. Those who\r\nare formed by his image, by his book, will never fall into error. His\r\nbook has not been written to please aesthetic preciseness, but with a\r\nsincerity which knows no limit. It therefore contains irrefutable\r\nfacts and theories.\r\n\r\nThe solidity of these fragmentary pages defies time; the work\r\ninterrupted by the German shell is none the less erected for eternity.\r\nThe work has muscles, nerves and a soul. It has the transparent\r\nconcentration of reality. A thought may be expressed by a single word.\r\nThe terseness of the calcined phrase explains the interior fire of it\r\nall, the magnificent conviction of the author. The distinctness of\r\noutline, the most astounding brevity of touch, is such that the vision\r\nof the future bursts forth from the resurrection of the past. The work\r\ncontains, indeed, substance and marrow of a prophetic experience.\r\n\r\nAmidst the praise rendered to the scintillating beauties of this book,\r\nthere is perhaps, none more impressive than that of Barbey\r\nd'Aurevilly, an illustrious literary man of a long and generous\r\npatrician lineage. His comment, kindled with lyric enthusiasm, is\r\nilluminating. It far surpasses the usual narrow conception of\r\ntechnical subjects. Confessing his professional ignorance in matters\r\nof war, his sincere eulogy of the eloquent amateur is therefore only\r\nthe more irresistible.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" writes Barbey d'Aurevilly, \"has a man of action--of brutal\r\naction in the eyes of universal prejudice--more magnificently\r\nglorified the spirituality of war. Mechanics--abominable\r\nmechanics--takes possession of the world, crushing it under its stupid\r\nand irresistible wheels. By the action of newly discovered and\r\nimproved appliances the science of war assumes vast proportions as a\r\nmeans of destruction. Yet here, amid the din of this upset modern\r\nworld we find a brain sufficiently master of its own thoughts as not\r\nto permit itself to be dominated by these horrible discoveries which,\r\nwe are told, would make impossible Fredericks of Prussia and Napoleons\r\nand lower them to the level of the private soldier! Colonel Ardant du\r\nPicq tells us somewhere that he has never had entire faith in the huge\r\nbattalions which these two great men, themselves alone worth more than\r\nthe largest battalions, believed in. Well, to-day, this vigorous brain\r\nbelieves no more in the mechanical or mathematical force which is\r\ngoing to abolish these great battalions. A calculator without the\r\nleast emotion, who considers the mind of man the essential in\r\nwar--because it is this mind that makes war--he surely sees better\r\nthan anybody else a profound change in the exterior conditions of war\r\nwhich he must consider. But the spiritual conditions which are\r\nproduced in war have not changed. Such, is the eternal mind of man\r\nraised to its highest power by discipline. Such, is the Roman cement\r\nof this discipline that makes of men indestructible walls. Such, is\r\nthe cohesion, the solidarity between men and their leaders. Such, is\r\nthe moral influence of the impulse which gives the certainty of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n\"'To conquer is to advance,' de Maistre said one day, puzzled at this\r\nphenomenon of victory. The author of \"Etudes sur le Combat\" says more\r\nsimply: 'To conquer is to be sure to overcome.' In fine, it is the\r\nmind that wins battles, that will always win them, that always has won\r\nthem throughout the world's history. The spirituality, the moral\r\nquality of war, has not changed since those times. Mechanics, modern\r\narms, all the artillery invented by man and his science, will not make\r\nan end to this thing, so lightly considered at the moment and called\r\nthe human soul. Books like that of Ardant du Picq prevent it from\r\nbeing disdained. If no other effect should be produced by this sublime\r\nbook, this one thing would justify it. But there will be others--do\r\nnot doubt it--I wish merely to point out the sublimity of this\r\ndidactic book which, for me, has wings like celestial poetry and which\r\nhas carried me above and far away from the materialistic abjectness of\r\nmy time. The technique of tactics and the science of war are beyond my\r\nprovince. I am not, like the author, erudite on maneuvers and the\r\nbattle field. But despite my ignorance of things exclusively military,\r\nI have felt the truth of the imperious demonstrations with which it is\r\nreplete, as one feels the presence of the sun behind a cloud. His book\r\nhas over the reader that moral ascendancy which is everything in war\r\nand which determines success, according to the author. This\r\nascendancy, like truth itself, is the sort which cannot be questioned.\r\nComing from the superior mind of a leader who inspires faith it\r\nimposes obedience by its very strength. Colonel Ardant du Picq was a\r\nmilitary writer only, with a style of his own. He has the Latin\r\nbrevity and concentration. He retains his thought, assembles it and\r\nalways puts it out in a compact phrase like a cartridge. His style has\r\nthe rapidity and precision of the long-range arms which have dethroned\r\nthe bayonet. He would have been a writer anywhere. He was a writer by\r\nnature. He was of that sacred phalanx of those who have a style all to\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nBarbey d'Aurevilly rebels against tedious technicalities. Carried away\r\nby the author's historical and philosophical faculties, he soars\r\nwithout difficulty to the plane of Ardant du Picq. In like manner, du\r\nPicq ranges easily from the most mediocre military operations to the\r\nanalysis of the great functions of policy of government and the\r\nevolution of nations.\r\n\r\nWho could have unraveled with greater finesse the causes of the\r\ninsatiable desires of conquest by the new power which was so desirous\r\nof occupying the leading role on the world's stage? If our diplomats,\r\nour ministers and our generals had seized the warning of 1866, the\r\ndate of the defeat of Austria, it is possible that we might have been\r\nspared our own defeats.\r\n\r\n\"Has an aristocracy any excuse for existing if it is not military? No.\r\nThe Prussian aristocracy is essentially military. In its ranks it does\r\naccept officers of plebeian extraction, but only under condition that\r\nthey permit themselves to be absorbed therein.\r\n\r\n\"Is not an aristocracy essentially proud? If it were not proud it\r\nwould lack confidence. The Prussian aristocracy is, therefore,\r\nhaughty; it desires domination by force and its desire to rule, to\r\ndominate more and more, is the essence of its existence. It rules by\r\nwar; it wishes war; it must have war at the proper time. Its leaders\r\nhave the good judgment to choose the right moment. This love of war is\r\nin the very fiber, the very makeup of its life as an aristocracy.\r\n\r\n\"Every nation that has an aristocracy, a military nobility, is\r\norganized in a military way. The Prussian officer is an accomplished\r\ngentleman and nobleman; by instruction or examination he is most\r\ncapable; by education, most worthy. He is an officer and commands from\r\ntwo motives, the French officer from one alone.\r\n\r\n\"Prussia, in spite of all the veils concealing reality, is a military\r\norganization conducted by a military corporation. A nation,\r\ndemocratically constituted, is not organized from a military point of\r\nview. It is, therefore, as against the other, in a state of\r\nunpreparedness for war.\r\n\r\n\"A military nation and a warlike nation are not necessarily the same.\r\nThe French are warlike from organization and instinct. They are every\r\nday becoming less and less military.\r\n\r\n\"In being the neighbor of a military nation, there is no security for\r\na democratic nation; the two are born enemies; the one continually\r\nmenaces the good influences, if not the very existence of the other.\r\nAs long as Prussia is not democratic she is a menace to us.\r\n\r\n\"The future seems to belong to democracy, but, before this future is\r\nattained by Europe, who will say that victory and domination will not\r\nbelong for a time to military organization? It will presently perish\r\nfor the lack of sustenance of life, when having no more foreign\r\nenemies to vanquish, to watch, to fight for control, it will have no\r\nreason for existence.\"\r\n\r\nIn tracing a portrait so much resembling bellicose and conquering\r\nPrussia, the sharp eye of Ardant du Picq had recognized clearly the\r\ndanger which immediately threatened us and which his deluded and\r\ntrifling fellow citizens did not even suspect. The morning after\r\nSadowa, not a single statesman or publicist had yet divined what the\r\nColonel of the 10th Regiment of the Line had, at first sight,\r\nunderstood. Written before the catastrophes of Froeschwiller, Metz and\r\nSedan, the fragment seems, in a retrospective way, an implacable\r\naccusation against those who deceived themselves about the\r\nHohenzollern country by false liberalism or a softening of the brain.\r\n\r\nUnswerved by popular ideas, by the artificial, by the trifles\r\nof treaties, by the chimera of theories, by the charlatanism\r\nof bulletins, by the nonsense of romantic fiction, by the\r\nsentimentalities of vain chivalry, Ardant du Picq, triumphant in\r\nhistory, is even more the incomparable master in the field of his\r\nlaborious days and nights, the field of war itself. Never has a\r\nclearer vision fathomed the bloody mysteries of the formidable test of\r\nwar. Here man appears as his naked self. He is a poor thing when he\r\nsuccumbs to unworthy deeds and panics. He is great under the impulse\r\nof voluntary sacrifice which transforms him under fire and for honor\r\nor the salvation of others makes him face death.\r\n\r\nThe sound and complete discussions of Ardant du Picq take up, in a\r\npoignant way, the setting of every military drama. They envelop in a\r\ncircle of invariable phenomena the apparent irregularity of combat,\r\ndetermining the critical point in the outcome of the battle. Whatever\r\nbe the conditions, time or people, he gives a code of rules which will\r\nnot perish. With the enthusiasm of Pascal, who should have been a\r\nsoldier, Ardant du Picq has the preeminent gift of expressing the\r\ninfinite in magic words. He unceasingly opens an abyss under the feet\r\nof the reader. The whole metaphysics of war is contained therein and\r\nis grasped at a single glance.\r\n\r\nHe shows, weighed in the scales of an amazing exactitude, the normal\r\nefficiency of an army; a multitude of beings shaken by the most\r\ncontradictory passions, first desiring to save their own skins and yet\r\nresigned to any risk for the sake of a principle. He shows the\r\nquantity and quality of possible efforts, the aggregate of losses, the\r\neffects of training and impulse, the intrinsic value of the troops\r\nengaged. This value is the sum of all that the leader can extract from\r\nany and every combination of physical preparation, confidence, fear of\r\npunishment, emulation, enthusiasm, inclination, the promise of\r\nsuccess, administration of camps, fire discipline, the influence of\r\nability and superiority, etc. He shows the tragic depths, so somber\r\nbelow, so luminous above, which appear in the heart of the combatant\r\ntorn between fear and duty. In the private soldier the sense of duty\r\nmay spring from blind obedience; in the non-commissioned officer,\r\nresponsible for his detachment, from devotion to his trade; in the\r\ncommanding officer, from supreme responsibility! It is in battle that\r\na military organization justifies its existence. Money spent by the\r\nbillions, men trained by the millions, are gambled on one irrevocable\r\nmoment. Organization decides the terrible contest which means the\r\ntriumph or the downfall of the nation! The harsh rays of glory beam\r\nabove the field of carnage, destroying the vanquished without\r\nscorching the victor.\r\n\r\nSuch are the basic elements of strategy and tactics!\r\n\r\nThere is danger in theoretical speculation of battle, in prejudice, in\r\nfalse reasoning, in pride, in braggadocio. There is one safe resource,\r\nthe return to nature.\r\n\r\nThe strategy that moves in elevated spheres is in danger of being lost\r\nin the clouds. It becomes ridiculous as soon as it ceases to conform\r\nto actual working tactics. In his classical work on the decisive\r\nbattle of August 18, 1870, Captain Fritz Hoenig has reached a sound\r\nconclusion. After his biting criticism of the many gross errors of\r\nSteinmetz and Zastrow, after his description of the triple panic of\r\nthe German troops opposite the French left in the valley and the\r\nravine of the Mance, he ends by a reflection which serves as a\r\nstriking ending to the book. He says, \"The grandest illustration of\r\nMoltke's strategy was the battle of Gravelotte-Saint Privat; but the\r\nbattle of Gravelotte has taught us one thing, and that is, the best\r\nstrategy cannot produce good results if tactics is at fault.\"\r\n\r\nThe right kind of tactics is not improvised. It asserts itself in the\r\npresence of the enemy but it is learned before meeting the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"There are men,\" says Ardant du Picq, \"such as Marshal Bugeaud, who\r\nare born military in character, mind, intelligence and temperament.\r\nNot all leaders are of this stamp. There is, then, need for standard\r\nor regulation tactics appropriate to the national character which\r\nshould be the guide for the ordinary commander and which do not exact\r\nof him the exceptional qualities of a Bugeaud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tactics is an art based on the knowledge of how to make men fight\r\nwith their maximum energy against fear, a maximum which organization\r\nalone can give.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here confidence appears. It is not the enthusiastic and\r\nthoughtless confidence of tumultuous or improvised armies that gives\r\nway on the approach of danger to a contrary sentiment which sees\r\ntreason everywhere; but the intimate, firm, conscious confidence which\r\nalone makes true soldiers and does not disappear at the moment of\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\n\"We now have an army. It is not difficult for us to see that people\r\nanimated by passions, even people who know how to die without\r\nflinching, strong in the face of death, but without discipline and\r\nsolid organization, are conquered by others who are individually less\r\nvaliant but firmly organized, all together and one for all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Solidarity and confidence cannot be improvised. They can be born only\r\nof mutual acquaintanceship which establishes pride and makes unity.\r\nAnd, from unity comes in turn the feeling of force, that force which\r\ngives to the attack the courage and confidence of victory. Courage,\r\nthat is to say, the domination of the will over instinct even in the\r\ngreatest danger, leads finally to victory or defeat.\"\r\n\r\nIn asking for a doctrine in combat and in seeking to base it on the\r\nmoral element, Ardant du Picq was ahead of his generation. He has had\r\na very great influence. But, the doctrine is not yet established.\r\n\r\nHow to approach the adversary? How to pass from the defensive to the\r\noffensive? How to regulate the shock? How to give orders that can be\r\nexecuted? How to transmit them surely? How to execute them by\r\neconomizing precious lives? Such are the distressing problems that\r\nbeset generals and others in authority. The result is that presidents,\r\nkings and emperors hesitate, tremble, interrogate, pile reports upon\r\nreports, maneuvers upon maneuvers, retard the improvement of their\r\nmilitary material, their organization, their equipment.\r\n\r\nThe only leaders who are equal to the difficulties of future war, come\r\nto conclusions expressed in almost the same terms. Recently General de\r\nNegrier, after having insisted that physical exhaustion determined by\r\nthe nervous tension of the soldier, increased in surprising\r\nproportions according to the invisibility of the adversary, expressed\r\nhimself as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The tide of battle is in the hands of each fighter, and never, at any\r\ntime, has the individual bravery of the soldier had more importance.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever the science of the superior commander, the genius of his\r\nstrategic combinations, the precision of his concentrations, whatever\r\nnumerical superiority he may have, victory will escape him if the\r\nsoldier does not conduct himself without being watched, and if he is\r\nnot personally animated by the resolution to conquer or to perish. He\r\nneeds much greater energy than formerly.\r\n\r\n\"He no longer has the intoxication of ancient attacks in mass to\r\nsustain him. Formerly, the terrible anxiety of waiting made him wish\r\nfor the violent blow, dangerous, but soon passed. Now, all his normal\r\nand physical powers are tried for long hours and, in such a test, he\r\nwill have but the resoluteness of his own heart to sustain him.\r\n\r\n\"Armies of to-day gain decisions by action in open order, where each\r\nsoldier must act individually with will and initiative to attack the\r\nenemy and destroy him.\r\n\r\n\"The Frenchman has always been an excellent rifleman, intelligent,\r\nadroit and bold. He is naturally brave. The metal is good; the problem\r\nis to temper it. It must be recognized that to-day this task is not\r\neasy. The desire for physical comfort, the international theories\r\nwhich come therefrom, preferring economic slavery and work for the\r\nprofit of the stranger to the struggle, do not incite the Frenchman to\r\ngive his life in order to save that of his brother.\r\n\r\n\"The new arms are almost valueless in the hands of weakhearted\r\nsoldiers, no matter what their number may be. On the contrary, the\r\ndemoralizing power of rapid and smokeless firing, which certain armies\r\nstill persist in not acknowledging, manifests itself with so much the\r\nmore force as each soldier possesses greater valor and cool energy.\r\n\r\n\"It is then essential to work for the development of the moral forces\r\nof the nation. They alone will sustain the soldier in the distressing\r\ntest of battle where death comes unseen.\r\n\r\n\"That is the most important of the lessons of the South African war.\r\nSmall nations will find therein the proof that, in preparing their\r\nyouth for their duties as soldiers and creating in the hearts of all\r\nthe wish for sacrifice, they are certain to live free; but only at\r\nthis price.\"\r\n\r\nThis profession of faith contradicts the imbecile sophisms foolishly\r\nput into circulation by high authority and a thoughtless press, on the\r\nefficiency of the mass, which is nothing but numbers, on the fantastic\r\nvalue of new arms, which are declared sufficient for gaining a victory\r\nby simple mechanical perfection, on the suppression of individual\r\ncourage. It is almost as though courage had become a superfluous and\r\nembarrassing factor. Nothing is more likely to poison the army. Ardant\r\ndu Picq is the best specific against the heresies and the follies of\r\nignorance or of pedantry. Here are some phrases of unerring truth.\r\nThey ought to be impressed upon all memories, inscribed upon the walls\r\nof our military schools. They ought to be learned as lessons by our\r\nofficers and they ought to rule them as regulations and pass into\r\ntheir blood:\r\n\r\n\"Man is capable of but a given quantity of fear. To-day one must\r\nswallow in five minutes the dose that one took in an hour in Turenne's\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day there is greater need than ever for rigid formation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who can say that he never felt fear in battle? And with modern\r\nappliances, with their terrible effect on the nervous system,\r\ndiscipline is all the more necessary because one fights only in open\r\nformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Combat exacts a moral cohesion, a solidarity more compact that ever\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since the invention of fire arms, the musket, rifle, cannon, the\r\ndistances of mutual aid and support are increased between the various\r\narms. The more men think themselves isolated, the more need they have\r\nof high morale.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are brought by dispersion to the need of a cohesion greater than\r\never before.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a truth, so clear as to be almost naive, that if one does not\r\nwish bonds broken, he should make them elastic and thereby strengthen\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not wise to lead eighty thousand men upon the battle field, of\r\nwhom but fifty thousand will fight. It would be better to have fifty\r\nthousand all of whom would fight. These fifty thousand would have\r\ntheir hearts in the work more than the others, who should have\r\nconfidence in their comrades but cannot when one-third of them shirk\r\ntheir work.\"\r\n\r\n\"The role of the skirmisher becomes more and more predominant. It is\r\nmore necessary to watch over and direct him as he is used against\r\ndeadlier weapons and as he is consequently more prone to try to escape\r\nfrom them at all costs in any direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"The thing is then to find a method that partially regulates the\r\naction of our soldiers who advance by fleeing or escape by advancing,\r\nas you like, and if something unexpected surprises them, escape as\r\nquickly by falling back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Esprit de corps improves with experience in wars. War becomes shorter\r\nand shorter, and more and more violent; therefore, create in advance\r\nan esprit de corps.\"\r\n\r\nThese truths are eternal. This whole volume is but their masterful\r\ndevelopment. They prove that together with audacious sincerity in the\r\ncooerdination of facts and an infallible judgment, Ardant du Picq\r\npossessed prescience in the highest degree. His prophetic eye\r\ndistinguished sixty years ago the constituent principles of a good\r\narmy. These are the principles which lead to victory. They are\r\nradically opposed to those which enchant our parliamentarians or\r\nmilitary politicians, which are based on a fatal favoritism and which\r\nprecipitate wars.\r\n\r\nArdant du Picq is not alone a superior doctrinaire. He will be\r\nconsulted with profit in practical warlike organization. No one has\r\nbetter depicted the character of modern armies. No one knew better the\r\nvalue of what Clausewitz called, \"The product of armed force and the\r\ncountry's force ... the heart and soul of a nation.\"\r\n\r\nNo more let us forget that he launched, before the famous prediction\r\nof von der Goltz, this optimistic view well calculated to rekindle the\r\nzeal of generals who struggle under the weight of enormous tasks\r\nincident to obligatory service.\r\n\r\n\"Extremes meet in many things. In the ancient times of conflict with\r\npike and sword, armies were seen to conquer other solid armies even\r\nthough one against two. Who knows if the perfection of long-range arms\r\nmight not bring back these heroic victories? Who knows whether a\r\nsmaller number by some combination of good sense or genius, or morale,\r\nand of appliances will not overcome a greater number equally well\r\narmed?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the abandonment of the law of 1872, and the repeal of the law of\r\n1889, and before the introduction of numerous and disquieting reforms\r\nin recruitment and consequently, in the education of our regiments,\r\nwould it not be opportune to study Ardant du Picq and look for the\r\nsecret of force in his ideas rather than in the deceptive illusions of\r\nmilitary automatism and materialism?\r\n\r\nThe martial mission of France is no more ended than war itself. The\r\nseverities of war may be deplored, but the precarious justice of\r\narbitration tribunals, still weak and divested of sanction, has not\r\ndone away with its intervention in earthly quarrels. I do not suppose\r\nthat my country is willing to submit to the mean estate, scourged with\r\nsuperb contempt by Donoso Cortes, who says:--\r\n\r\n\"When a nation shows a civilized horror of war, it receives directly\r\nthe punishment of its mistake. God changes its sex, despoils it of its\r\ncommon mark of virility, changes it into a feminine nation and sends\r\nconquerors to ravish it of its honor.\"\r\n\r\nFrance submits sometimes to the yoke of subtle dialecticians who\r\npreach total disarmament, who spread insanely disastrous doctrine of\r\ncapitulation, glorify disgrace and humiliation, and stupidly drive us\r\non to suicide. The manly counsels of Ardant du Picq are admirable\r\nlessons for a nation awakening. Since she must, sooner or later, take\r\nup her idle sword again, may France learn from him to fight well, for\r\nherself and for humanity!\r\n\r\nERNEST JUDET.\r\nPARIS, October 10, 1902.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArdant du Picq has said little about himself in his writings. He veils\r\nwith care his personality. His life and career, little known, are the\r\nmore worthy of the reader's interest, because the man is as original\r\nas the writer. To satisfy a natural curiosity, I asked the Colonel's\r\nfamily for the details of his life, enshrined in their memory. His\r\nbrother has kindly furnished them in a letter to me. It contains many\r\nunpublished details and shows traits of character which confirm our\r\nestimate of the man, Ardant du Picq. It completes very happily the\r\nimpression made by his book.\r\n\r\n\"PARIS, October 12, 1903.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir,_\r\n\r\n\"Herewith are some random biographical notes on the author of 'Etudes\r\nsur le Combat' which you requested of me.\r\n\r\n\"My brother entered Saint-Cyr quite late, at twenty-one years, which\r\nwas I believe the age limit at that time. This was not his initial\r\npreference. He had a marked preference for a naval career, in which\r\nadventure seemed to offer an opportunity for his activity, and which\r\nhe would have entered if the circumstances had so permitted. His\r\nchildhood was turbulent and somewhat intractable; but, attaining\r\nadolescence, he retained from his former violence a very pronounced\r\ntaste for physical exercise, especially for gymnastics, little\r\npracticed then, to which he was naturally inclined by his agility and\r\nmuscular strength.\r\n\r\n\"He was successful in his classes, very much so in studies which were\r\nto his taste, principally French composition. In this he rose above\r\nthe usual level of schoolboy exercises when the subject interested\r\nhim. Certain other branches that were uninteresting or distasteful to\r\nhim, as for instance Latin Grammar, he neglected. I do not remember\r\never having seen him attend a distribution of prizes, although he was\r\nhighly interested, perhaps because he was too interested. On these\r\noccasions, he would disappear generally after breakfast and not be\r\nseen until evening. His bent was toward mechanical notions and\r\nhandiwork. He was not uninterested in mathematics but his interest in\r\nthis was ordinary. He was nearly refused entrance to Saint-Cyr. He\r\nbecame confused before the examiners and the results of the first part\r\nof the tests were almost negligible. He consoled himself with his\r\nfavorite maxim as a young man: 'Onward philosophy.' Considering the\r\nfirst test as over and done with, he faced the second test with\r\nperfect indifference. This attitude gave him another opportunity and\r\nhe came out with honors. As he had done well with the written test on\r\n'Hannibal's Campaigns,' he was given a passing grade.\r\n\r\n\"At school he was liked by all his comrades for his good humor and\r\nfrank and sympathetic character. Later, in the regiment, he gained\r\nnaturally and without effort the affection of his equals and the\r\nrespect of his subordinates. The latter were grateful to him for the\r\nreal, cordial and inspiring interest he showed in their welfare, for\r\nhe was familiar with the details of the service and with the soldier's\r\nequipment. He would not compromise on such matters and prevaricators\r\nwho had to do with him did not emerge creditably.\r\n\r\n\"It can be said that after reaching manhood he never lied. The\r\nabsolute frankness from which he never departed under any\r\ncircumstances gave him prestige superior to his rank. A mere\r\nLieutenant, he voted 'No' to the Coup d'Etat of December 2, and was\r\nadmonished by his colonel who was sorry to see him compromise thus his\r\nfuture. He replied with his usual rectitude: 'Colonel, since my\r\nopinion was asked for, I must suppose that it was wanted.'\r\n\r\n\"On the eve of the Crimean war, his regiment, (67th) not seeming\r\ndestined to take the field, he asked for and obtained a transfer to\r\nthe light infantry (9th Battalion). It was with this battalion that he\r\nserved in the campaign. When it commenced, he made his first\r\nappearance in the fatal Dobrutscha expedition. This was undertaken in\r\na most unhealthy region, on the chance of finding there Cossacks who\r\nwould have furnished matter for a communique. No Cossacks were found,\r\nbut the cholera was. It cut down in a few hours, so as to speak, a\r\nlarge portion of the total strength. My brother, left with the rear\r\nguard to bury the dead, burn their effects and bring up the sick, was\r\nin his turn infected. The attack was very violent and he recovered\r\nonly because he would not give in to the illness. Evacuated to the\r\nVarna hospital, he was driven out the first night by the burning of\r\nthe town and was obliged to take refuge in the surrounding fields\r\nwhere the healthfulness of the air gave him unexpected relief.\r\nReturned to France as a convalescent, he remained there until the\r\nmonth of December (1854). He then rejoined his regiment and withstood\r\nto the end the rigors of the winter and the slowness of the siege.\r\n\r\n\"Salle's division to which the Trochu brigade belonged, and in which\r\nmy brother served, was charged with the attack on the central bastion.\r\nThis operation was considered a simple diversion without a chance of\r\nsuccess. My brother, commanding the storming column of his battalion,\r\nhad the good fortune to come out safe and sound from the deadly fire\r\nto which he was exposed and which deprived the battalion of several\r\ngood officers. He entered the bastion with a dozen men. All were\r\nnaturally made prisoners after a resistance which would have cost my\r\nbrother his life if the bugler at his side had not warded off a saber\r\nblow at his head. Upon his return from captivity, in the first months\r\nof 1856, he was immediately made major in the 100th Regiment of the\r\nLine, at the instance of General Trochu who regarded him highly. He\r\nwas called the following year to the command of the 16th Battalion of\r\nFoot Chasseurs. He served with this battalion during the Syrian\r\ncampaign where there was but little serious action.\r\n\r\n\"Back again in France, his promotion to the grade of\r\nlieutenant-colonel, notwithstanding his excellent ratings and his\r\nplace on the promotion list, was long retarded by the ill-will of\r\nMarshal Randon, the Minister of War. Marshal Randon complained of his\r\nindependent character and bore him malice from an incident relative to\r\nthe furnishing of shoes intended for his battalion. My brother,\r\nquestioned by Marshal Niel about the quality of the lot of shoes, had\r\nfrankly declared it bad.\r\n\r\n\"Promoted finally to lieutenant-colonel in the 55th in Algeria, he\r\ntook the field there in two campaigns, I believe. Appointed colonel of\r\nthe 10th of the Line in February, 1869, he was stationed at Lorient\r\nand at Limoges during the eighteen months before the war with Germany.\r\nHe busied himself during this period with the preparation of his work,\r\nsoliciting from all sides first-hand information. It was slow in\r\ncoming in, due certainly to indifference rather than ill-will. He made\r\nseveral trips to Paris for the purpose of opening the eyes of those in\r\nauthority to the defective state of the army and the perils of the\r\nsituation. Vain attempts! 'They take all that philosophically,' he\r\nused to say.\r\n\r\n\"Please accept, Sir, with renewed acknowledgements of gratitude, the\r\nexpression of my most distinguished sentiments.\r\n\r\n\"C. ARDANT DU PICQ.\r\n\r\n\"P. S. As to the question of atavism in which you showed some interest\r\nin our first conversation, I may say that our paternal line does not\r\nin my knowledge include any military man. The oldest ancestor I know\r\nof, according to an album of engravings by Albert Duerer, recovered in\r\na garret, was a gold and silversmith at Limoges towards the end of the\r\nsixteenth century. His descendants have always been traders down to my\r\ngrandfather who, from what I have heard said, did not in the least\r\nattend to his trade. The case is different with my mother's family\r\nwhich came from Lorraine. Our great-grandfather was a soldier, our\r\ngrandfather also, and two, at least, of my mother's brothers gave\r\ntheir lives on the battlefields of the First Empire. At present, the\r\nfamily has two representatives in the army, the one a son of my\r\nbrother's, the other a first cousin, once removed, both bearing our\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\"C. A. DU P.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD OF MILITARY SERVICE OF COLONEL ARDANT DU PICQ\r\n\r\n\r\nArdant du Picq (Charles-Jean-Jacques-Joseph), was born October 19,\r\n1821 at Perigueux (Dordogne). Entered the service as a student of the\r\nSpecial Military School, November 15, 1842.\r\n\r\nSub-Lieutenant in the 67th Regiment of the Line, October 1, 1844.\r\n\r\nLieutenant, May 15, 1848.\r\n\r\nCaptain, August 15, 1852.\r\n\r\nTransferred to the 9th Battalion of Foot Chasseurs, December 25, 1853.\r\n\r\nMajor of the 100th Regiment of the Line, February 15, 1856.\r\n\r\nTransferred to the 16th Battalion of Chasseurs, March 17, 1856.\r\n\r\nTransferred to the 37th Regiment of the Line, January 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel of the 55th Regiment of the Line, January 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nColonel of the 10th Regiment of Infantry of the Line, February 27,\r\n1869.\r\n\r\nDied from wounds at the military hospital in Metz, August 18, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGNS AND WOUNDS\r\n\r\nOrient, March 29, 1854 to May 27, 1856. Was taken prisoner of war at\r\nthe storming of the central bastion (Sebastopol) September 8, 1855;\r\nreturned from enemy's prisons December 13, 1855.\r\n\r\nServed in the Syrian campaign from August 6, 1860 to June 18, 1861; in\r\nAfrica from February 24, 1864 to April 14, 1866; in Franco-German war,\r\nfrom July 15, 1870 to August 18, 1870.\r\n\r\nWounded--a comminute fracture of the right thigh, a torn gash in the\r\nleft thigh, contusion of the abdomen--by the bursting of a projectile,\r\nAugust 15, 1870, Longeville-les-Metz (Moselle).\r\n\r\n\r\nDECORATIONS\r\n\r\nChevalier of the Imperial Order of the Legion of Honor, Dec. 29, 1860.\r\n\r\nOfficer of the Imperial Order of the Legion of Honor, September 10,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nReceived the medal of H. M. the Queen of England.\r\n\r\nReceived the medal for bravery in Sardinia.\r\n\r\nAuthorized to wear the decoration of the fourth class of the Ottoman\r\nMedjidie order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE HISTORY OF THE 10TH INFANTRY REGIMENT\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN OF 1870\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July, the three active battalions of the 10th Regiment\r\nof Infantry of the Line left Limoges and Angouleme by rail arriving on\r\nthe 23rd at the camp at Chalons, where the 6th Corps of the Rhine Army\r\nwas concentrating and organizing, under the command of Marshal\r\nCanrobert. The regiment, within this army corps, belonged to the 1st\r\nBrigade (Pechot) of the 1st Division (Tixier).\r\n\r\nThe organization on a war footing of the 10th Regiment of Infantry of\r\nthe Line, begun at Limoges, was completed at the Chalons camp.\r\n\r\nThe battalions were brought up to seven hundred and twenty men, and\r\nthe regiment counted twenty-two hundred and ten present, not including\r\nthe band, the sappers and the headquarters section, which raised the\r\neffectives to twenty-three hundred men.\r\n\r\nThe troops of the 6th Corps were soon organized and Marshal Canrobert\r\nreviewed them on the 31st of July.\r\n\r\nOn August 5th, the division received orders to move to Nancy. It was\r\nplaced on nine trains, of which the first left at 6 A. M. Arriving in\r\nthe evening at its destination, the 1st brigade camped on the Leopold\r\nRacetrack, and the 10th Regiment established itself on the Place de la\r\nGreve.\r\n\r\nThe defeats of Forbach and Reichshofen soon caused these first plans\r\nto be modified. The 6th Corps was ordered to return to the Chalons\r\ncamp. The last troops of the 2d Brigade, held up at Toul and Commercy,\r\nwere returned on the same trains.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Brigade entrained at Nancy, on the night of August 8th,\r\narriving at the Chalons camp on the afternoon of August 8th.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Corps, however, was to remain but a few days in camp. On the\r\n10th it received orders to go to Metz. On the morning of the 11th the\r\nregiment was again placed on three successive trains. The first train\r\ncarrying the staff and the 1st Battalion, arrived at Metz without\r\nincident. The second train, transporting the 2d Battalion and four\r\ncompanies of the 3d was stopped at about 11 P.M. near the Frouard\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph line was cut by a Prussian party near Dieulouard, for a\r\nlength of two kilometers, and it was feared the road was damaged.\r\n\r\nIn order not to delay his arrival at Metz, nor the progress of the\r\ntrains following, Major Morin at the head of the column, directed his\r\ncommands to detrain and continue to Metz.\r\n\r\nHe caused the company at the head of the train to alight (6th Company,\r\n2d Battalion, commanded by Captain Valpajola) and sent it\r\nreconnoitering on the road, about three hundred meters in advance of\r\nthe train. All precautions were taken to assure the security of the\r\ntrain, which regulated its progress on that of the scouts.\r\n\r\nAfter a run of about eight kilometers in this way, at Marbache\r\nstation, all danger having disappeared and communication with Metz\r\nhaving been established, the train resumed its regulation speed. In\r\nconsequence of the slowing up of the second column, the third followed\r\nat a short distance until it also arrived. On the afternoon of the\r\n12th, the regiment was entirely united.\r\n\r\nThe division of which it was a part was sent beyond Montigny and it\r\ncamped there as follows:\r\n\r\nThe 9th Chasseurs and 4th Regiment of the Line, ahead of the\r\nThionville railroad, the right on the Moselle, the left on the\r\nPont-a-Mousson highway; the 10th Regiment of the Line, the right\r\nsupported at the branch of the Thionville and Nancy lines, the left in\r\nthe direction of Saint-Privat, in front of the Montigny repair shops\r\nof the Eastern Railroad lines.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was thus placed in the rear of a redoubt under\r\nconstruction. The company of engineers was placed at the left of the\r\n10th near the earth-works on which it was to work.\r\n\r\nAlong the ridge of the plateau, toward the Seille, was the 2d Brigade,\r\nwhich rested its left on the river and its right perpendicular to the\r\nSaint-Privat road, in rear of the field-work of this name. The\r\ndivisional batteries were behind it.\r\n\r\nThe division kept this position August 13th and during the morning of\r\nthe 14th. In the afternoon, an alarm made the division take arms,\r\nduring the engagement that took place on the side of Vallieres and\r\nSaint-Julien (battle of Borny). The regiment immediately occupied\r\npositions on the left of the village of Montigny.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, the division retired to the rear of the railroad cut,\r\nand received orders to hold itself in readiness to leave during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe regiment remained thus under arms, the 3d Battalion (Major\r\nDeschesnes), passing the night on grand guard in front of the Montigny\r\nredoubt.\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak, the division marched over the bank of the Thionville\r\nrailroad, crossed the Moselle, and, marching towards Gravelotte,\r\ndescended into the plain south of Longeville-les-Metz, where the\r\nprincipal halt was made and coffee prepared.\r\n\r\nScarcely had stacks been made, and the men set to making fires, about\r\n7 A.M. when shells exploded in the midst of the troops. The shots came\r\nfrom the Bradin farm, situated on the heights of Montigny, which the\r\ndivision had just left the same morning, and which a German cavalry\r\nreconnaissance patrol supported by two pieces had suddenly occupied.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel had arms taken at once and disposed the regiment north of\r\nthe road which, being elevated, provided sufficient cover for\r\ndefilading the men.\r\n\r\nHe himself, stood in the road to put heart into his troops by his\r\nattitude, they having been a little startled by this surprise and the\r\nbaptism of fire which they received under such disadvantageous\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a shell burst over the road, a few feet from the Colonel,\r\nand mutilated his legs in a frightful manner.\r\n\r\nThe same shell caused other ravages in the ranks of the 10th. The\r\ncommander of the 3d Battalion, Major Deschesnes, was mortally wounded,\r\nCaptain Reboulet was killed, Lieutenant Pone (3d Battalion, 1st\r\nCompany), and eight men of the regiment were wounded. The Colonel was\r\nimmediately taken to the other side of the highway into the midst of\r\nhis soldiers and a surgeon called, those of the regiment being already\r\nengaged in caring for the other victims of the terrible shot.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Colonel Ardant du Picq asked for Lieut.-Colonel\r\nDoleac, delivered to him his saddlebags containing important papers\r\nconcerning the regiment and gave him his field glasses. Then, without\r\nuttering the least sound of pain, notwithstanding the frightful injury\r\nfrom which he must have suffered horribly, he said with calmness: \"My\r\nregret is to be struck in this way, without having been able to lead\r\nmy regiment on the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThey wanted him to take a little brandy, he refused and accepted some\r\nwater which a soldier offered him.\r\n\r\nA surgeon arrived finally. The Colonel, showing him his right leg open\r\nin two places, made with his hand the sign of amputating at the thigh,\r\nsaying: \"Doctor, it is necessary to amputate my leg here.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a soldier wounded in the shoulder, and placed near the\r\nColonel, groaned aloud. Forgetting his own condition, the Colonel said\r\nimmediately to the surgeon: \"See first, doctor, what is the matter\r\nwith this brave man; I can wait.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of instruments it was not possible to perform the\r\namputation on the ground, as the Colonel desired, so this much\r\ndeplored commander was transported to the Metz hospital.\r\n\r\nFour days later (19th of August), Colonel Ardant du Picq died like a\r\nhero of old, without uttering the least complaint. Far from his\r\nregiment, far from his family, he uttered several times the words\r\nwhich summed up his affections: \"My wife, my children, my regiment,\r\nadieu!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBattle is the final objective of armies and man is the fundamental\r\ninstrument in battle. Nothing can wisely be prescribed in an army--its\r\npersonnel, organization, discipline and tactics, things which are\r\nconnected like the fingers of a hand--without exact knowledge of the\r\nfundamental instrument, man, and his state of mind, his morale, at the\r\ninstant of combat.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that those who discuss war, taking the weapon for the\r\nstarting point, assume unhesitatingly that the man called to serve it\r\nwill always use it as contemplated and ordered by the regulations. But\r\nsuch a being, throwing off his variable nature to become an impassive\r\npawn, an abstract unit in the combinations of battle, is a creature\r\nborn of the musings of the library, and not a real man. Man is flesh\r\nand blood; he is body and soul. And, strong as the soul often is, it\r\ncan not dominate the body to the point where there will not be a\r\nrevolt of the flesh and mental perturbation in the face of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe human heart, to quote Marshal de Saxe, is then the starting point\r\nin all matters pertaining to war.\r\n\r\nLet us study the heart, not in modern battle, complicated and not\r\nreadily grasped, but in ancient battle. For, although nowhere\r\nexplained in detail, ancient battle was simple and clear.\r\n\r\nCenturies have not changed human nature. Passions, instincts, among\r\nthem the most powerful one of self-preservation, may be manifested in\r\nvarious ways according to the time, the place, the character and\r\ntemperament of the race. Thus in our times we can admire, under the\r\nsame conditions of danger, emotion and anguish, the calmness of the\r\nEnglish, the dash of the French, and that inertia of the Russians\r\nwhich is called tenacity. But at bottom there is always found the same\r\nman. It is this man that we see disposed of by the experts, by the\r\nmasters, when they organize and discipline, when they order detailed\r\ncombat methods and take general dispositions for action. The best\r\nmasters are those who know man best, the man of today and the man of\r\nhistory. This knowledge naturally comes from a study of formations and\r\nachievements in ancient war.\r\n\r\nThe development of this work leads us to make such an analysis, and\r\nfrom a study of combat we may learn to know man.\r\n\r\nLet us go even back of ancient battle, to primeval struggle. In\r\nprogressing from the savage to our times we shall get a better grasp\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nAnd shall we then know as much as the masters? No more than one is a\r\npainter by having seen the methods of painting. But we shall better\r\nunderstand these able men and the great examples they have left behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe shall learn from them to distrust mathematics and material dynamics\r\nas applied to battle principles. We shall learn to beware of the\r\nillusions drawn from the range and the maneuver field.\r\n\r\nThere, experience is with the calm, settled, unfatigued, attentive,\r\nobedient soldier, with an intelligent and tractable man-instrument in\r\nshort, and not with the nervous, easily swayed, moved, troubled,\r\ndistrait, excited, restless being, not even under self-control, who is\r\nthe fighting man from general to private. There are strong men,\r\nexceptions, but they are rare.\r\n\r\nThese illusions, nevertheless, stubborn and persistent, always repair\r\nthe very next day the most damaging injuries inflicted on them by\r\nexperience. Their least dangerous effect is to lead to prescribing the\r\nimpractical, as if ordering the impractical were not really an attack\r\non discipline, and did not result in disconcerting officers and men by\r\nthe unexpected and by surprise at the contrast between battle and the\r\ntheories of peacetime training.\r\n\r\nBattle, of course, always furnishes surprises. But it furnishes less\r\nin proportion as good sense and the recognition of truth have had\r\ntheir effect on the training of the fighting man, and are disseminated\r\nin the ranks. Let us then study man in battle, for it is he who really\r\nfights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMAN IN PRIMITIVE AND ANCIENT COMBAT\r\n\r\n\r\nMan does not enter battle to fight, but for victory. He does\r\neverything that he can to avoid the first and obtain the second.\r\n\r\nWar between savage tribes, between Arabs, even today, [1] is a war of\r\nambush by small groups of men of which each one, at the moment of\r\nsurprise, chooses, not his adversary, but his victim, and is an\r\nassassin. Because the arms are similar on both sides, the only way of\r\ngiving the advantage to one side is by surprise. A man surprised,\r\nneeds an instant to collect his thoughts and defend himself; during\r\nthis instant he is killed if he does not run away.\r\n\r\nThe surprised adversary does not defend himself, he tries to flee.\r\nFace to face or body to body combat with primitive arms, ax or dagger,\r\nso terrible among enemies without defensive arms, is very rare. It can\r\ntake place only between enemies mutually surprised and without a\r\nchance of safety for any one except in victory. And still ... in case\r\nof mutual surprise, there is another chance of safety; that of falling\r\nback, of flight on the part of one or the other; and that chance is\r\noften seized. Here is an example, and if it does not concern savages\r\nat all, but soldiers of our days, the fact is none the less\r\nsignificant. It was observed by a man of warlike temperament who has\r\nrelated what he saw with his own eyes, although he was a forced\r\nspectator, held to the spot by a wound.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War, on a day of heavy fighting, two detachments of\r\nsoldiers, A and B, coming around one of the mounds of earth that\r\ncovered the country and meeting unexpectedly face to face, at ten\r\npaces, stopped thunderstruck. Then, forgetting their rifles, they\r\nthrew stones and withdrew. Neither of the two groups had a decided\r\nleader to lead it to the front, and neither of the two dared to shoot\r\nfirst for fear that the other would at the same time bring his own arm\r\nto his shoulder. They were too near to hope to escape, or so they\r\nthought at least, although in reality, reciprocal firing, at such\r\nshort ranges, is almost always too high. The man who would fire sees\r\nhimself already killed by the return fire. He throws stones, and not\r\nwith great force, to avoid using his rifle, to distract the enemy, to\r\noccupy the time, until flight offers him some chance of escaping at\r\npoint-blank range.\r\n\r\nThis agreeable state of affairs did not last long, a minute perhaps.\r\nThe appearance of a troop B on one flank determined the flight of A,\r\nand then the opposing group fired.\r\n\r\nSurely, the affair is ridiculous and laughable.\r\n\r\nLet us see, however. In a thick forest, a lion and a tiger meet face\r\nto face at a turn in the trail. They stop at once, rearing and ready\r\nto spring. They measure each other with their eyes, there is a\r\nrumbling in their throats. The claws move convulsively, the hair\r\nstands up. With tails lashing the ground, and necks stretched, ears\r\nflattened, lips turned up, they show their formidable fangs in that\r\nterrible threatening grimace of fear characteristic of felines.\r\n\r\nUnseen, I shudder.\r\n\r\nThe situation is disagreeable for both: movement ahead means the death\r\nof a beast. Of which? Of both perhaps.\r\n\r\nSlowly, quite slowly, one leg, bent for the leap, bending still, moves\r\na few inches to the rear. Gently, quite gently, a fore paw follows the\r\nmovement. After a stop, slowly, quite slowly, the other legs do the\r\nsame, and both beasts, insensibly, little by little, and always\r\nfacing, withdraw, up to the moment where their mutual withdrawal has\r\ncreated between them an interval greater than can be traversed in a\r\nbound. Lion and tiger turn their backs slowly and, without ceasing to\r\nobserve, walk freely. They resume without haste their natural gaits,\r\nwith that sovereign dignity characteristic of great seigneurs. I have\r\nceased to shudder, but I do not laugh.\r\n\r\nThere is no more to laugh at in man in battle, because he has in his\r\nhands a weapon more terrible than the fangs and claws of lion or\r\ntiger, the rifle, which instantly, without possible defense, sends one\r\nfrom life into death. It is evident that no one close to his enemy is\r\nin a hurry to arm himself, to put into action a force which may kill\r\nhim. He is not anxious to light the fuse that is to blow up the enemy,\r\nand himself at the same time.\r\n\r\nWho has not observed like instances between dogs, between dog and cat,\r\ncat and cat?\r\n\r\nIn the Polish War of 1831, two Russian and two Polish regiments of\r\ncavalry charged each other. They went with the same dash to meet one\r\nanother. When close enough to recognize faces, these cavalrymen\r\nslackened their gait and both turned their backs. The Russians and\r\nPoles, at this terrible moment, recognized each other as brothers, and\r\nrather than spill fraternal blood, they extricated themselves from a\r\ncombat as if it were a crime. That is the version of an eyewitness and\r\nnarrator, a Polish officer.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of cavalry troops so moved by brotherly love?\r\n\r\nBut let us resume:\r\n\r\nWhen people become more numerous, and when the surprise of an entire\r\npopulation occupying a vast space is no longer possible, when a sort\r\nof public conscience has been cultivated within society, one is warned\r\nbeforehand. War is formally declared. Surprise is no longer the whole\r\nof war, but it remains one of the means in war, the best means, even\r\nto-day. Man can no longer kill his enemy without defense. He has\r\nforewarned him. He must expect to find him standing and in numbers. He\r\nmust fight; but he wishes to conquer with as little risk as possible.\r\nHe employs the iron shod mace against the staff, arrows against the\r\nmace, the shield against arrows, the shield and cuirass against the\r\nshield alone, the long lance against the short lance, the tempered\r\nsword against the iron sword, the armed chariot against man on foot,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nMan taxes his ingenuity to be able to kill without running the risk of\r\nbeing killed. His bravery is born of his strength and it is not\r\nabsolute. Before a stronger he flees without shame. The instinct of\r\nself-preservation is so powerful that he does not feel disgraced in\r\nobeying it, although, thanks to the defensive power of arms and armor\r\nhe can fight at close quarters. Can you expect him to act in any other\r\nway? Man must test himself before acknowledging a stronger. But once\r\nthe stronger is recognized, no one will face him.\r\n\r\nIndividual strength and valor were supreme in primitive combats, so\r\nmuch so that when its heroes were killed, the nation was conquered. As\r\na result of a mutual and tacit understanding, combatants often stopped\r\nfighting to watch with awe and anxiety two champions struggling. Whole\r\npeoples often placed their fate in the hands of the champions who took\r\nup the task and who alone fought. This was perfectly natural. They\r\ncounted their champion a superman, and no man can stand against the\r\nsuperman.\r\n\r\nBut intelligence rebels against the dominance of force. No one can\r\nstand against an Achilles, but no Achilles can withstand ten enemies\r\nwho, uniting their efforts, act in concert. This is the reason for\r\ntactics, which prescribe beforehand proper means of organization and\r\naction to give unanimity to effort, and for discipline which insures\r\nunited efforts in spite of the innate weakness of combatants.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning man battled against man, each one for himself, like a\r\nbeast that hunts to kill, yet flees from that which would kill him.\r\nBut now prescriptions of discipline and tactics insure unity between\r\nleader and soldier, between the men themselves. Besides the\r\nintellectual progress, is there a moral progress? To secure unity in\r\ncombat, to make tactical dispositions in order to render it\r\npractically possible, we must be able to count on the devotion of all.\r\nThis elevates all combatants to the level of the champions of\r\nprimitive combat. Esprit appears, flight is a disgrace, for one is no\r\nlonger alone in combat. There is a legion, and he who gives way quits\r\nhis commanders and his companions. In all respects the combatant is\r\nworth more.\r\n\r\nSo reason shows us the strength of wisely united effort; discipline\r\nmakes it possible.\r\n\r\nWill the result be terrible fights, conflicts of extermination? No!\r\nCollective man, a disciplined body of troops formed in tactical battle\r\norder, is invincible against an undisciplined body of troops. But\r\nagainst a similarly disciplined body, he becomes again primitive man.\r\nHe flees before a greater force of destruction when he recognizes it\r\nor when he foresees it. Nothing is changed in the heart of man.\r\nDiscipline keeps enemies face to face a little longer, but cannot\r\nsupplant the instinct of self-preservation and the sense of fear that\r\ngoes with it.\r\n\r\nFear!...\r\n\r\nThere are officers and soldiers who do not know it, but they are\r\npeople of rare grit. The mass shudders; because you cannot suppress\r\nthe flesh. This trembling must be taken into account in all\r\norganization, discipline, arrangements, movements, maneuvers, mode of\r\naction. All these are affected by the human weakness of the soldier\r\nwhich causes him to magnify the strength of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis faltering is studied in ancient combat. It is seen that of\r\nnations apt in war, the strongest have been those who, not only best\r\nhave understood the general conduct of war, but who have taken human\r\nweakness into greatest account and taken the best guarantees against\r\nit. It is notable that the most warlike peoples are not always those\r\nin which military institutions and combat methods are the best or the\r\nmost rational.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, in warlike nations there is a good dose of vanity. They\r\nonly take into account courage in their tactics. One might say that\r\nthey do not desire to acknowledge weakness.\r\n\r\nThe Gaul, a fool in war, used barbarian tactics. After the first\r\nsurprise, he was always beaten by the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\nThe Greek, a warrior, but also a politician, had tactics far superior\r\nto those of the Gauls and the Asiatics.\r\n\r\nThe Roman, a politician above all, with whom war was only a means,\r\nwanted perfect means. He had no illusions. He took into account human\r\nweakness and he discovered the legion.\r\n\r\nBut this is merely affirming what should be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nKNOWLEDGE OF MAN MADE ROMAN TACTICS.\r\nTHE SUCCESSES OF HANNIBAL, THOSE OF CAESAR\r\n\r\n\r\nGreek tactics developed the phalanx; Roman tactics, the legion; the\r\ntactics of the barbarians employed the square phalanx, wedge or\r\nlozenge.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of these various formations is explained in all\r\nelementary books. Polybius enters into a mechanical discussion when he\r\ncontrasts the phalanx and the legion. (Book 18.)\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were, in intellectual civilization, superior to the Romans,\r\nconsequently their tactics ought to have been far more rational. But\r\nsuch was not the case. Greek tactics proceeded from mathematical\r\nreasoning; Roman tactics from a profound knowledge of man's heart.\r\nNaturally the Greeks did not neglect morale nor the Romans mechanics, [2]\r\nbut their primary, considerations were diverse.\r\n\r\nWhat formation obtained the maximum effort from the Greek army?\r\n\r\nWhat methods caused the soldiers of a Roman army to fight most\r\neffectively?\r\n\r\nThe first question admits of discussion. The Roman solved the second.\r\n\r\nThe Roman was not essentially brave. He did not produce any warrior of\r\nthe type of Alexander. It is acknowledged that the valorous\r\nimpetuosity of the barbarians, Gauls, Cimbri, Teutons, made him\r\ntremble. But to the glorious courage of the Greeks, to the natural\r\nbravery of the Gauls he opposed a strict sense of duty, secured by a\r\nterrible discipline in the masses. It was inspired in the officers by\r\na sentiment of the strongest patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the Greeks was secured by exercises and rewards; the\r\ndiscipline of the Romans was secured also by the fear of death. They\r\nput to death with the club; they decimated their cowardly or\r\ntraitorous units.\r\n\r\nIn order to conquer enemies that terrified his men, a Roman general\r\nheightened their morale, not by enthusiasm but by anger. He made the\r\nlife of his soldiers miserable by excessive work and privations. He\r\nstretched the force of discipline to the point where, at a critical\r\ninstant, it must break or expend itself on the enemy. Under similar\r\ncircumstances, a Greek general caused Tyrtaeus to sing. [3] It would\r\nhave been curious to see two such forces opposed.\r\n\r\nBut discipline alone does not constitute superior tactics. Man in\r\nbattle, I repeat, is a being in whom the instinct of self-preservation\r\ndominates, at certain moments, all other sentiments. Discipline has\r\nfor its aim the domination of that instinct by a greater terror. But\r\nit cannot dominate it completely. I do not deny the glorious examples\r\nwhere discipline and devotion have elevated man above himself. But if\r\nthese examples are glorious, it is because they are rare; if they are\r\nadmired, it is because they are considered exceptions, and the\r\nexception proves the rule.\r\n\r\nThe determination of that instant where man loses his reasoning power\r\nand becomes instinctive is the crowning achievement in the science of\r\ncombat. In general, here was the strength of the Roman tactics. In\r\nparticular cases such successful determination makes Hannibals and\r\nCaesars.\r\n\r\nCombat took place between masses in more or less deep formation\r\ncommanded and supervised by leaders with a definite mission. The\r\ncombat between masses was a series of individual conflicts,\r\njuxtaposed, with the front rank man alone fighting. If he fell, if he\r\nwas wounded or worn out, he was replaced by the man of the second rank\r\nwho had watched and guarded his flanks. This procedure continued up to\r\nthe last rank. Man is always physically and morally fatigued in a\r\nhand-to-hand tournament where he employs all his energy.\r\n\r\nThese contests generally lasted but a short time. With like morale,\r\nthe least fatigued always won.\r\n\r\nDuring this engagement of the first two ranks, the one fighting, the\r\nother watching close at hand, the men of the rear ranks waited\r\ninactive at two paces distance for their turn in the combat, which\r\nwould come only when their predecessors were killed, wounded or\r\nexhausted. They were impressed by the violent fluctuations of the\r\nstruggle of the first rank. They heard the clashes of the blows and\r\ndistinguished, perhaps, those that sank into the flesh. They saw the\r\nwounded, the exhausted crawl through the intervals to go to the rear.\r\nPassive spectators of danger, they were forced to await its terrible\r\napproach. These men were subjected to the poignant emotions of combat\r\nwithout being supported by the animation of the struggle. They were\r\nthus placed under the moral pressure of the greatest of anxieties.\r\nOften they could not stand it until their turn came; they gave way.\r\n\r\nThe best tactics, the best dispositions were those that made easiest a\r\nsuccession of efforts by assuring the relief by ranks of units in\r\naction, actually engaging only the necessary units and keeping the\r\nrest as a support or reserve outside of the immediate sphere of moral\r\ntension. The superiority of the Romans lay in such tactics and in the\r\nterrible discipline which prepared and assured the execution. By their\r\nresistance against fatigue which rude and continual tasks gave them\r\nand by the renewal of combatants in combat, they secured greater\r\ncontinuity of effort than any others. [4]\r\n\r\nThe Gauls did not reason. Seeing only the inflexible line, they bound\r\nthemselves together, thus rendering relief impracticable. They\r\nbelieved, as did the Greeks, in the power of the mass and impulse of\r\ndeep files, and did not understand that deep files were powerless to\r\npush the first ranks forward as they recoiled in the face of death. It\r\nis a strange error to believe that the last ranks will go to meet that\r\nwhich made the first ones fall back. On the contrary, the contagion of\r\nrecoil is so strong that the stopping of the head means the falling\r\nback of the rear!\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, also, certainly had reserves and supports in the second\r\nhalf of their dense ranks. But the idea of mass dominated. They placed\r\nthese supports and reserves too near, forgetting the essential, man.\r\n\r\nThe Romans believed in the power of mass, but from the moral point of\r\nview only. They did not multiply the files in order to add to the\r\nmass, but to give to the combatants the confidence of being aided and\r\nrelieved. The number of ranks was calculated according to the moral\r\npressure that the last ranks could sustain.\r\n\r\nThere is a point beyond which man cannot bear the anxiety of combat in\r\nthe front lines without being engaged. The Romans did not so increase\r\nthe number of ranks as to bring about this condition. The Greeks did\r\nnot observe and calculate so well. They sometimes brought the number\r\nof files up to thirty-two and their last files, which in their minds,\r\nwere doubtless their reserves, found themselves forcibly dragged into\r\nthe material disorder of the first ones.\r\n\r\nIn the order by maniples in the Roman legion, the best soldiers, those\r\nwhose courage had been proved by experience in battle, waited\r\nstoically, kept in the second and third lines. They were far enough\r\naway not to suffer wounds and not to be drawn in by the front line\r\nretiring into their intervals. Yet they were near enough to give\r\nsupport when necessary or to finish the job by advancing.\r\n\r\nWhen the three separate and successive maniples of the first cohort\r\nwere united in order to form the united battle cohort of Marius and of\r\nCaesar, the same brain placed the most reliable men in the last lines,\r\ni.e., the oldest. The youngest, the most impetuous, were in the first\r\nlines. The legion was not increased simply to make numbers or mass.\r\nEach had his turn in action, each man in his maniple, each maniple in\r\nits cohort, and, when the unit became a cohort, each cohort in the\r\norder of battle.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Roman theory dictated a depth of ranks to\r\nfurnish successive lines of combatants. The genius of the general\r\nmodified these established formations. If the men were inured to war,\r\nwell-trained, reliable, tenacious, quick to relieve their file\r\nleaders, full of confidence in their general and their own comrades,\r\nthe general diminished the depth of the files, did away with the lines\r\neven, in order to increase the number of immediate combatants by\r\nincreasing the front. His men having a moral, and sometimes also a\r\nphysical endurance superior to that of the adversary, the general knew\r\nthat the last ranks of the latter would not, under pressure, hold\r\nsufficiently to relieve the first lines nor to forbid the relief of\r\nhis own. Hannibal had a part of his infantry, the Africans, armed and\r\ndrilled in the Roman way; his Spanish infantrymen had the long wind of\r\nthe Spaniards of to-day; his Gallic soldiers, tried out by hardship,\r\nwere in the same way fit for long efforts. Hannibal, strong with the\r\nconfidence with which he inspired his people, drew up a line less deep\r\nby half than the Roman army and at Cannae hemmed in an army which had\r\ntwice his number and exterminated it. Caesar at Pharsalus, for similar\r\nreasons, did not hesitate to decrease his depth. He faced double his\r\nstrength in the army of Pompey, a Roman army like his own, and crushed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned Cannae and Pharsalus, we shall study in them the\r\nmechanism and the morale of ancient combat, two things which cannot be\r\nseparated. We cannot find better examples of battle more clearly and\r\nmore impartially exhibited. This is due in one case to the clear\r\npresentation of Polybius, who obtained his information from the\r\nfugitives from Cannae, possibly even from some of the conquerors; in\r\nthe other it is due to the impassive clearness of Caesar in describing\r\nthe art of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE\r\n\r\n\r\nRecital of Polybius:\r\n\r\n\"Varro placed the cavalry on the right wing, and rested it on the\r\nriver; the infantry was deployed near it and on the same line, the\r\nmaniples drawn close to each other, with smaller intervals than usual,\r\nand the maniples presenting more depth than front.\r\n\r\n\"The cavalry of the allies, on the left wing, completed the line, in\r\nfront of which were posted the light troops. There were in that army,\r\nincluding the allies, eighty thousand foot and a little more than six\r\nthousand horse.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile Hannibal had his slingers and light troops cross the\r\nAufidus and posted them in front of his army. The rest crossed the\r\nriver at two places. He placed the Iberian and Gallic cavalry on the\r\nleft wing, next the river and facing the Roman cavalry. He placed on\r\nthe same line, one half of the African infantry heavily armed, the\r\nIberian and Gallic infantry, the other half of the African infantry,\r\nand finally the Numidian cavalry which formed the right wing.\r\n\r\n\"After he had thus arrayed all his troops upon a single line, he\r\nmarched to meet the enemy with the Iberian and Gallic infantry moving\r\nindependently of the main body. As it was joined in a straight line\r\nwith the rest, on separating, it was formed like the convex face of a\r\ncrescent. This formation reduced its depth in the center. The\r\nintention of the general was to commence the battle with the Iberians\r\nand Gauls, and have them supported by the Africans.\r\n\r\n\"The latter infantry was armed like the Roman infantry, having been\r\nequipped by Hannibal with arms that had been taken from the Romans in\r\npreceding battle. Both Iberians and Gauls had shields; but their\r\nswords were quite different. The sword of the former was as fit for\r\nthrusting as for cutting while that of the Gauls only cut with the\r\nedge, and at a limited distance. These troops were drawn up as\r\nfollows: the Iberians were in two bodies of troops on the wings, near\r\nthe Africans; the Gauls in the center. The Gauls were nude; the\r\nIberians in linen shirts of purple color, which to the Romans was an\r\nextraordinary and frightening spectacle. The Carthaginian army\r\nconsisted of ten thousand horse and little more than forty thousand\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\"Aemilius commanded the right of the Romans, Varro the left; the two\r\nconsuls of the past year, Servilius and Attilius, were in the center.\r\nOn the Carthaginian side, Hasdrubal had the left under his orders,\r\nHanno the right, and Hannibal, who had his brother Mago with him,\r\nreserved for himself the command of the center. The two armies did not\r\nsuffer from the glare of the sun when it rose, the one being faced to\r\nthe South, as I remarked, and the other to the North.\r\n\r\n\"Action commenced with the light troops, which were in front of both\r\narmies. The first engagement gave advantage to neither the one nor the\r\nother. Just as soon as the Iberian and Gallic cavalry on the left\r\napproached, the conflict became hot. The Romans fought with fury and\r\nrather more like barbarians than Romans. This falling back and then\r\nreturning to the charge was not according to their tactics. Scarcely\r\ndid they become engaged when they leaped from their horses and each\r\nseized his adversary. In the meanwhile the Carthaginians gained the\r\nupper hand. The greater number of the Romans remained on the ground\r\nafter having fought with the greatest valor. The others were pursued\r\nalong the river and cut to pieces without being able to obtain\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\"The heavily armed infantry immediately took the place of the light\r\ntroops and became engaged. The Iberians and Gauls held firm at first\r\nand sustained the shock with vigor; but they soon gave way to the\r\nweight of the legions, and, opening the crescent, turned their backs\r\nand retreated. The Romans followed them with impetuosity, and broke\r\nthe Gallic line much more easily because the wings crowded toward the\r\ncenter where the thick of the fighting was. The whole line did not\r\nfight at the same time. The action commenced in the center because the\r\nGauls, being drawn up in the form of a crescent, left the wings far\r\nbehind them, and presented the convex face of the crescent to the\r\nRomans. The latter then followed the Gauls and Iberians closely, and\r\ncrowded towards the center, to the place where the enemy gave way,\r\npushing ahead so forcibly that on both flanks they engaged the heavily\r\narmed Africans. The Africans on the right, in swinging about from\r\nright to left, found themselves all along the enemy's flank, as well\r\nas those on the left which made the swing from left to right. The very\r\ncircumstances of the action showed them what they had to do. This was\r\nwhat Hannibal had foreseen; that the Romans pursuing the Gauls must be\r\nenveloped by the Africans. The Romans then, no longer able to keep\r\ntheir formation [5] were forced to defend themselves man to man and in\r\nsmall groups against those who attacked them on front and flank.[6]\r\n\r\n\"Aemilius had escaped the carnage on the right wing at the\r\ncommencement of the battle. Wishing, according to the orders he had\r\ngiven, to be everywhere, and seeing that it was the legionary infantry\r\nthat would decide the fate of the battle, he pushed his horse through\r\nthe fray, warded off or killed every one who opposed him, and sought\r\nat the same time to reanimate the ardor of the Roman soldiers.\r\nHannibal, who during the entire battle remained in the conflict, did\r\nthe same in his army.\r\n\r\n\"The Numidian cavalry on the right wing, without doing or suffering\r\nmuch, was useful on that occasion by its manner of fighting; for,\r\npouncing upon the enemy on all sides, they gave him enough to do so\r\nthat he might not have time to think of helping his own people.\r\nIndeed, when the left wing, where Hasdrubal commanded, had routed\r\nalmost all the cavalry of the Roman right wing, and a junction had\r\nbeen effected with the Numidians, the auxiliary cavalry did not wait\r\nto be attacked but gave way.\r\n\r\n\"Hasdrubal is said to have done something which proved his prudence\r\nand his ability, and which contributed to the success of the battle.\r\nAs the Numidians were in great number, and as these troops were never\r\nmore useful than when one was in flight before them, he gave them the\r\nfugitives to pursue, and led the Iberian and Gallic cavalry in a\r\ncharge to aid the African infantry. He pounced on the Romans from the\r\nrear, and having bodies of cavalry charge into the melee at several\r\nplaces, he gave new strength to the Africans and made the arms drop\r\nfrom the hands of the adversaries. It was then that L. Aemilius, a\r\ncitizen who during his whole life, as in this last conflict, had nobly\r\nfulfilled his duties to his country, finally succumbed, covered with\r\nmortal wounds.\r\n\r\n\"The Romans continued fighting, giving battle to those who were\r\nsurrounding them. They resisted to the last. But as their numbers\r\ndiminished more and more, they were finally forced into a smaller\r\ncircle, and all put to the sword. Attilius and Servilius, two persons\r\nof great probity, who had distinguished themselves in the combat as\r\ntrue Romans, were also killed on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\"While this carnage was taking place in the center, the Numidians\r\npursued the fugitives of the left wing. Most of them were cut down,\r\nothers were thrown under their horses; some of them escaped to\r\nVenusia. Among these was Varro, the Roman general, that abominable man\r\nwhose administration cost his country so dearly. Thus ended the battle\r\nof Cannae, a battle where prodigies of valor were seen on both sides.\r\n\r\n\"Of the six thousand horse of which the Roman cavalry was composed,\r\nonly seventy Romans reached Venusia with Varro, and, of the auxiliary\r\ncavalry, only three hundred men found shelter in various towns. Ten\r\nthousand foot were taken prisoners, but they were not in the battle. [7]\r\nOf troops in battle only about three thousand saved themselves in the\r\nnearby town; the balance, numbering about twenty thousand, died on the\r\nfield of honor.\" [8]\r\n\r\nHannibal lost in that action in the neighborhood of four thousand\r\nGauls, fifteen hundred Iberians and Africans and two hundred horses.\r\n\r\nLet us analyze:\r\n\r\nThe light infantry troops were scattered in front of the armies and\r\nskirmished without result. The real combat commenced with the attack\r\non the legitimate cavalry of the Roman left wing by the cavalry of\r\nHannibal.\r\n\r\nThere, says Polybius, the fight grew thickest, the Romans fought with\r\nfury and much more like barbarians than like Romans; because this\r\nfalling back, then returning to the charge was not according to their\r\ntactics; scarcely did they become engaged when they leaped from their\r\nhorses and each seized his adversary, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis means that the Roman cavalry did not habitually fight hand to\r\nhand like the infantry. It threw itself in a gallop on the enemy\r\ncavalry. When within javelin range, if the enemy's cavalry had not\r\nturned in the opposite direction on seeing the Roman cavalry coming,\r\nthe latter prudently slackened its gait, threw some javelins, and,\r\nmaking an about by platoons, took to the rear for the purpose of\r\nrepeating the charge. The hostile cavalry did the same, and such an\r\noperation might be renewed several times, until one of the two,\r\npersuaded that his enemy was going to attack him with a dash, turned\r\nin flight and was pursued to the limit.\r\n\r\nThat day, the fight becoming hot, they became really engaged; the two\r\ncavalry bodies closed and man fought man. The fight was forced,\r\nhowever; as there was no giving way on one side or the other, it was\r\nnecessary actually to attack. There was no space for skirmishing.\r\nClosed in by the Aufidus and the legions, the Roman cavalry could not\r\noperate (Livy). The Iberian and Gallic cavalry, likewise shut in and\r\ndouble the Roman cavalry, was forced into two lines; it could still\r\nless maneuver. This limited front served the Romans, inferior in\r\nnumber, who could thus be attacked only in front, that is by an equal\r\nnumber. It rendered, as we have said, contact inevitable. These two\r\ncavalry bodies placed chest to chest had to fight close, had to\r\ngrapple man to man, and for riders mounted on simple saddle cloths and\r\nwithout stirrup, embarrassed with a shield, a lance, a saber or a\r\nsword, to grapple man to man is to grapple together, fall together and\r\nfight on foot. That is what happened, as the account of Titus Livius\r\nexplains it in completing that of Polybius. The same thing happened\r\nevery time that two ancient cavalry organizations really had to fight,\r\nas the battle of the Tecinus showed. This mode of action was all to\r\nthe advantage of the Romans, who were well-armed and well-trained\r\ntherein. Note the battle of Tecinus. The Roman light infantry was cut\r\nto pieces, but the elite of the Roman cavalry, although surprised and\r\nsurrounded, fought a-foot and on horse back, inflicted more casualties\r\non the cavalry of Hannibal than they suffered, and brought back from\r\nthe field their wounded general. The Romans besides were well led by\r\nConsul Aemilius, a man of head and heart, who, instead of fleeing when\r\nhis cavalry was defeated, went himself to die in the ranks of the\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we see thirty to thirty-four hundred Roman cavalrymen nearly\r\nexterminated by six to seven thousand Gauls and Iberians who did not\r\nlose even two hundred men. Hannibal's entire cavalry lost but two\r\nhundred men on that day.\r\n\r\nHow can that be explained?\r\n\r\nBecause most of them died without dreaming of selling their lives and\r\nbecause they took to flight during the fight of the first line and\r\nwere struck with impunity from behind. The words of Polybius: \"Most of\r\nthem remained on the spot after having defended themselves with the\r\nutmost valor,\" were consecrated words before Polybius. The conquered\r\nalways console themselves with their bravery and conquerors never\r\ncontradict. Unfortunately, the figures are there. The facts of the\r\nbattle are found in the account, which sounds no note of desperation.\r\nThe Gallic and Roman cavalry had each already made a brave effort by\r\nattacking each other from the front. This effort was followed by the\r\nterrible anxiety of close combat. The Roman cavalrymen, who from\r\nbehind the combatants on foot were able to see the second Gallic line\r\non horse back, gave ground. Fear very quickly made the disengaged\r\nranks take to their horses, wheel about like a flock of sheep in a\r\nstampede, and abandon their comrades and themselves to the mercy of\r\nthe conquerors.\r\n\r\nYet, these horsemen were brave men, the elite of the army, noble\r\nknights, guards of the consuls, volunteers of noble families.\r\n\r\nThe Roman cavalry defeated, Hasdrubal passed his Gallic and Iberian\r\ntroopers behind Hannibal's army, to attack the allied cavalry till\r\nthen engaged by the Numidians. [9] The cavalry of the allies did not\r\nawait the enemy. It turned its back immediately; pursued to the utmost\r\nby the Numidians who were numerous (three thousand), and excellent in\r\npursuit, it was reduced to some three hundred men, without a struggle.\r\n\r\nAfter the skirmishing of the light infantry troops, the foot-soldiers\r\nof the line met. Polybius has explained to us how the Roman infantry\r\nlet itself be enclosed by the two wings of the Carthaginian army and\r\ntaken in rear by Hasdrubal's cavalry. It is also probable that the\r\nGauls and Iberians, repulsed in the first part of the action and\r\nforced to turn their backs, returned, aided by a portion of the light\r\ninfantry, to the charge upon the apex of the wedge formed by the\r\nRomans and completed their encirclement.\r\n\r\nBut we know, as will be seen further on in examples taken from Caesar,\r\nthat the ancient cavalryman was powerless against formed infantry,\r\neven against the isolated infantryman possessing coolness. The Iberian\r\nand Gallic cavalry ought to have found behind the Roman army the\r\nreliable triarians penned in, armed, with pikes. [10] It might have held\r\nthem in check, forced them to give battle, but done them little or no\r\nharm as long as the ranks were preserved.\r\n\r\nWe know that of Hannibal's infantry only twelve thousand at the most\r\nwere equipped with Roman weapons. We know that his Gallic and Iberian\r\ninfantry, protected by plain shields, had to fall back, turn, and\r\nprobably lost in this part of the action very nearly the four thousand\r\nmen, which the battle cost them.\r\n\r\nLet us deduct the ten thousand men that had gone to the attack of\r\nHannibal's camp and the five thousand which the latter must have left\r\nthere. There remain:\r\n\r\nA mass of seventy thousand men surrounded and slaughtered by\r\ntwenty-eight thousand foot soldiers, or, counting Hasdrubal's cavalry,\r\nby thirty-six thousand men, by half their number.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how seventy thousand men could have let themselves be\r\nslaughtered, without defense, by thirty-six thousand men less\r\nwell-armed, when each combatant had but one man before him. For in\r\nclose combat, and especially in so large an envelopment, the number of\r\ncombatants immediately engaged was the same on each side. Then there\r\nwere neither guns nor rifles able to pierce the mass by a converging\r\nfire and destroy it by the superiority of this fire over diverging\r\nfire. Arrows were exhausted in the first period of the action. It\r\nseems that, by their mass, the Romans must have presented an\r\ninsurmountable resistance, and that while permitting the enemy to wear\r\nhimself out against it, that mass had only to defend itself in order\r\nto repel assailants.\r\n\r\nBut it was wiped out.\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of the Gauls and Iberians, who certainly were not able,\r\neven with like morale, to stand against the superior arms of the\r\nlegionaries, the center drove all vigorously before it. The wings, in\r\norder to support it and not to lose the intervals, followed its\r\nmovement by a forward oblique march and formed the sides of the\r\nsalient. The entire Roman army, in wedge order, marched to victory.\r\nSuddenly the wings were attacked by the African battalions; the Gauls,\r\nthe Iberians, [11] who had been in retreat, returned to the fight. The\r\nhorsemen of Hasdrubal, in the rear, attacked the reserves. [12]\r\nEverywhere there was combat, unexpected, unforeseen. At the moment\r\nwhen they believed themselves conquerors, everywhere, in front, to the\r\nright, to the left, in the rear, the Roman soldiers heard the furious\r\nclamor of combat. [13]\r\n\r\nThe physical pressure was unimportant. The ranks that they were\r\nfighting had not half their own depth. The moral pressure was\r\nenormous. Uneasiness, then terror, took hold of them; the first ranks,\r\nfatigued or wounded, wanted to retreat; but the last ranks,\r\nfrightened, withdrew, gave way and whirled into the interior of the\r\nwedge. Demoralized and not feeling themselves supported, the ranks\r\nengaged followed them, and the routed mass let itself be slaughtered.\r\nThe weapons fell from their hands, says Polybius.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of Cannae is ended. Before passing to the recital of\r\nPharsalus, we cannot resist the temptation, though the matter be a\r\nlittle foreign to the subject, to say a few words about the battles of\r\nHannibal.\r\n\r\nThese battles have a particular character of stubbornness explained by\r\nthe necessity for overcoming the Roman tenacity. It may be said that\r\nto Hannibal victory was not sufficient. He must destroy. Consequently\r\nhe always tried to cut off all retreat for the enemy. He knew that\r\nwith Rome, destruction was the only way of finishing the struggle.\r\n\r\nHe did not believe in the courage of despair in the masses; he\r\nbelieved in terror and he knew the value of surprise in inspiring it.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the losses of the Romans that was the most surprising\r\nthing in these engagements. It was the losses of Hannibal. Who, before\r\nHannibal or after him, has lost as many as the Romans and yet been\r\nconqueror? To keep troops in action, until victory comes, with such\r\nlosses, requires a most powerful hand.\r\n\r\nHe inspired his people with absolute confidence. Almost always his\r\ncenter, where he put his Gauls, his food for powder, was broken. But\r\nthat did not seem to disquiet or trouble either him or his men.\r\n\r\nIt is true that his center was pierced by the Romans who were escaping\r\nthe pressure of the two Carthaginian wings, that they were in disorder\r\nbecause they had fought and pushed back the Gauls, whom Hannibal knew\r\nhow to make fight with singular tenacity. They probably felt as though\r\nthey had escaped from a press, and, happy to be out of it, they\r\nthought only of getting further away from the battle and by no means\r\nof returning to the flanks or the rear of the enemy. In addition,\r\nalthough nothing is said about it, Hannibal had doubtless taken\r\nprecautions against their ever returning to the conflict.\r\n\r\nAll that is probably true. The confidence of the Gallic troops, so\r\nbroken through, is none the less surprising.\r\n\r\nHannibal, in order to inspire his people with such confidence, had to\r\nexplain to them before the combat his plan of action, in such a way\r\nthat treachery could not injure him. He must have warned his troops\r\nthat the center would be pierced, but that he was not worried about\r\nit, because it was a foreseen and prepared affair. His troops, indeed,\r\ndid not seem to be worried about it.\r\n\r\nLet us leave aside his conception of campaigns, his greatest glory in\r\nthe eyes of all. Hannibal was the greatest general of antiquity by\r\nreason of his admirable comprehension of the morale of combat, of the\r\nmorale of the soldier whether his own or the enemy's. He shows his\r\ngreatness in this respect in all the different incidents of war, of\r\ncampaign, of action. His men were not better than the Roman soldiers.\r\nThey were not as well armed, one-half less in number. Yet he was\r\nalways the conqueror. He understood the value of morale. He had the\r\nabsolute confidence of his people. In addition he had the art, in\r\ncommanding an army, of always securing the advantage of morale.\r\n\r\nIn Italy he had, it is true, cavalry superior to that of the Romans.\r\nBut the Romans had a much superior infantry. Had conditions been\r\nreversed, he would have changed his methods. The instruments of battle\r\nare valuable only if one knows how to use them, and Pompey, we shall\r\nsee, was beaten at Pharsalus precisely because he had a cavalry\r\nsuperior to that of Caesar.\r\n\r\nIf Hannibal was vanquished at Zuma, it was because genius cannot\r\naccomplish the impossible. Zuma proved again the perfect knowledge of\r\nmen that Hannibal possessed and his influence over the troops. His\r\nthird line, the only one where he really had reliable soldiers, was\r\nthe only one that fought. Beset on all sides, it slew two thousand\r\nRomans before it was conquered.\r\n\r\nWe shall see later what a high state of morale, what desperate\r\nfighting, this meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF THE BATTLE OF PHARSALUS, AND SOME CHARACTERISTIC EXAMPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is Caesar's account of the battle of Pharsalus.\r\n\r\n\"As Caesar approached Pompey's camp, he noted that Pompey's army was\r\nplaced in the following order:\r\n\r\n\"On the left wing were the 2nd and 3rd Legions which Caesar had sent\r\nto Pompey at the commencement of the operation, pursuant to a decree\r\nof the Senate, and which Pompey had kept. Scipio occupied the center\r\nwith the legions from Syria. The legion from Cilicia was placed on the\r\nright wing together with the Spanish cohorts of Afranius. Pompey\r\nregarded the troops already mentioned as the most reliable of his\r\narmy. Between them, that is, between the center and the wings, he had\r\ndistributed the remainder, consisting of one hundred and ten complete\r\ncohorts in line. These were made up of forty-five thousand men, two\r\nthousand of whom were veterans, previously rewarded for their\r\nservices, who had come to join him. He had scattered them throughout\r\nthe whole line of battle. Seven cohorts had been left to guard his\r\ncamp and the neighboring forts. His right wing rested on a stream with\r\ninaccessible banks; and, for that reason, he had placed all his seven\r\nthousand cavalry, [14] his archers and his slingers (forty-two hundred\r\nmen) on the left wing.\r\n\r\n\"Caesar, keeping his battle order, [15] had placed the 10th Legion on the\r\nright wing, and on the left, the 9th, which was much weakened by the\r\ncombats of Dyrrachium. To the latter he added the 8th in order to form\r\nsomething like a full legion from the two, and ordered them to support\r\none another. He had eighty very completely organized cohorts in line,\r\napproximately twenty-two thousand men. Two cohorts had been left to\r\nguard the camp. Caesar had entrusted the command of the left wing to\r\nAnthony, that of the right to P. Sylla, and of the center to C.\r\nDomitius. He placed himself in front of Pompey. But when he saw the\r\ndisposition of the opposing army, he feared that his right wing was\r\ngoing to be enveloped by Pompey's numerous cavalry. He therefore\r\nwithdrew immediately from his third line a cohort from each legion\r\n(six cohorts), in order to form a fourth line, placed it to receive\r\nPompey's cavalry and showed it what it had to do. Then he explained\r\nfully to these cohorts that the success of the day depended on their\r\nvalor. At the same time he ordered the entire army, and in particular\r\nthe third line, not to move without his command, reserving to himself\r\nauthority to give the signal by means of the standard when he thought\r\nit opportune.\r\n\r\n\"Caesar then went through his lines to exhort his men to do well, and\r\nseeing them full of ardor, had the signal given.\r\n\r\n\"Between the two armies there was only enough space to give each the\r\nnecessary distance for the charge. But Pompey had given his men orders\r\nto await the charge without stirring, and to let Caesar's army break\r\nits ranks upon them. He did this, they say, on the advice of C.\r\nTriarius, as a method of meeting the force of the first dash of\r\nCaesar's men. He hoped that their battle order would be broken up and\r\nhis own soldiers, well disposed in ranks, would have to fight with\r\nsword in hand only men in disorder. He thought that this formation\r\nwould best protect his troops from the force of the fall of heavy\r\njavelins. At the same time he hoped that Caesar's soldiers charging at\r\nthe run would be out of breath and overcome with fatigue at the moment\r\nof contact. Pompey's immobility was an error because there is in every\r\none an animation, a natural ardor that is instilled by the onset to\r\nthe combat. Generals ought not to check but to encourage this ardor.\r\nIt was for this reason that, in olden times, troops charged with loud\r\nshouts, all trumpets sounding, in order to frighten the enemy and\r\nencourage themselves.\r\n\r\n\"In the meanwhile, our soldiers, at the given signal advanced with\r\njavelins in hand; but having noticed that Pompey's soldiers were not\r\nrunning towards them, and taught by experience and trained by previous\r\nbattles, they slowed down and stopped in the midst of their run, in\r\norder not to arrive out of breath and worn out. Some moments after,\r\nhaving taken up their run again, they launched their javelins, and\r\nimmediately afterwards, according to Caesar's order drew their swords.\r\nThe Pompeians conducted themselves perfectly. They received the darts\r\ncourageously; they did not stir before the dash of the legions; they\r\npreserved their lines, and, having dispatched their javelins, drew\r\ntheir swords.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time Pompey's entire cavalry dashed from the left wing,\r\nas had been ordered, and the mass of his archers ran from all parts of\r\nthe line. Our cavalry did not await the charge, but fell back a\r\nlittle. Pompey's cavalry became more pressing, and commenced to reform\r\nits squadrons and turn our exposed flank. As soon as Caesar saw this\r\nintention, he gave the signal to the fourth line of six cohorts. This\r\nline started directly and, standards low, they charged the Pompeian\r\ncavalry with such vigor and resolution that not a single man stood his\r\nground. All wheeled about and not only withdrew in full flight, but\r\ngained the highest mountains as fast as they could. They left the\r\narchers and slingers without their defense and protection. These were\r\nall killed. At the same time the cohorts moved to the rear of Pompey's\r\nleft wing, which was still fighting and resisting, and attacked it in\r\nrear.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Caesar had advanced his third line, which up to this\r\nmoment had been kept quietly at its post. These fresh troops relieved\r\nthose that were fatigued. Pompey's men, taken in rear, could no longer\r\nhold out and all took to flight.\r\n\r\n\"Caesar was not in error when he put these cohorts in a fourth line,\r\nparticularly charged with meeting the cavalry, and urged them to do\r\nwell, since their effort would bring victory. They repulsed the\r\ncavalry. They cut to pieces the slingers and archers. They turned\r\nPompey's left wing, and this decided the day.\r\n\r\n\"When Pompey saw his cavalry repulsed and that portion of the army\r\nupon which he had counted the most seized with terror, he had little\r\nconfidence in the rest. He quit the battle and galloped to his camp,\r\nwhere, addressing his centurions who were guarding the praetorian\r\ngate, he told them in a loud voice heard by the soldiers: 'Guard well\r\nthe camp and defend it vigorously in case of attack; as for myself, I\r\nam going to make the tour of the other gates and assure their\r\ndefense.'\r\n\r\n\"That said, he retired to the praetorium, despairing of success and\r\nawaiting events.\r\n\r\n\"After having forced the enemy to flee to his entrenchments Caesar,\r\npersuaded that he ought not to give the slightest respite to a\r\nterrorized enemy, incited his soldiers to profit by their advantage\r\nand attack the camp. Although overcome by the heat, for the struggle\r\nwas prolonged into the middle of the day, they did not object to\r\ngreater fatigue and obeyed. The camp was at first well defended by the\r\ncohorts on watch and especially by the Thracians and barbarians. The\r\nmen who had fled from the battle, full of fright and overcome with\r\nfatigue, had nearly all thrown their arms and colors away and thought\r\nrather more of saving themselves than of defending the camp. Even\r\nthose who defended the entrenchments were unable long to resist the\r\nshower of arrows. Covered with wounds, they abandoned the place, and\r\nled by their centurions and tribunes, they took refuge as quickly as\r\nthey could in the high mountains near the camp.\r\n\r\n\"Caesar lost in this battle but two hundred soldiers, but nearly\r\nthirty of the bravest centurions were killed therein. Of Pompey's army\r\nfifteen thousand perished, and more than twenty-four thousand took\r\nrefuge in the mountains. As Caesar had invested the mountains with\r\nentrenchments, they surrendered the following day.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is Caesar's account. His action is so clearly shown that there is\r\nscarcely any need of comment.\r\n\r\nInitially Caesar's formation was in three lines. This was the usual\r\nbattle order in the Roman armies, without being absolute, however,\r\nsince Marius fought with two only. But, as we have said, according to\r\nthe occasion, the genius of the chief decided the battle formation.\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that Pompey's army was in a different\r\norder of battle.\r\n\r\nTo face that army, twice as large as his, Caesar, if he had had to\r\npreserve the disposition of cohorts in ten ranks, would have been able\r\nto form but one complete line, the first, and a second, half as\r\nnumerous, as a reserve. But he knew the bravery of his troops, and he\r\nknew the apparent force of deep ranks to be a delusion. He did not\r\nhesitate to diminish his depth in order to keep the formation and\r\nmorale of three-fifths of his troops intact, until the moment of their\r\nengagement. In order to be even more sure of the third line of his\r\nreserve, and in order to make sure that it would not be carried away\r\nby its enthusiasm for action, he paid it most particular attention.\r\nPerhaps, the text is doubtful, he kept it at double the usual distance\r\nin rear of the fighting lines.\r\n\r\nThen, to guard against a turning movement by Pompey's seven thousand\r\ncavalry and forty-two hundred slingers and archers, a movement in\r\nwhich Pompey placed the hopes of victory, Caesar posted six cohorts\r\nthat represented scarcely two thousand men. He had perfect confidence\r\nthat these two thousand men would make Pompey's cavalry wheel about,\r\nand that his one thousand horsemen would then press the action so\r\nenergetically that Pompey's cavalry would not even think of rallying.\r\nIt happened so; and the forty-two hundred archers and slingers were\r\nslaughtered like sheep by these cohorts, aided, without doubt, by\r\nfour-hundred foot [16] young and agile, whom Caesar mixed with his\r\nthousand horsemen and who remained at this task, leaving the horsemen,\r\nwhom they had relieved, to pursue the terror-stricken fugitives.\r\n\r\nThus were seven thousand horsemen swept away and forty-two hundred\r\ninfantrymen slaughtered without a struggle, all demoralized simply by\r\na vigorous demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe order to await the charge, given by Pompey to his infantry, was\r\njudged too severely by Caesar. Caesar certainly was right as a general\r\nrule; the enthusiasm of the troops must not be dampened, and the\r\ninitiative of the attack indeed gives to the assailant a certain moral\r\ninfluence. But with trusted soldiers, duly trained, one can try a\r\nstratagem, and the men of Pompey had proven their dependability by\r\nawaiting on the spot, without stirring, a vigorous enemy in good\r\norder, when they counted on meeting him in disorder and out of breath.\r\nThough it may not have led to success, the advice of Triarius was not\r\nbad. Even the conduct of Caesar's men proves this. This battle shows\r\nthe confidence of the soldier in the material rank in ancient combat,\r\nas assuring support and mutual assistance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that Caesar's soldiers had the initiative in\r\nthe attack, the first encounter decided nothing. It was a combat on\r\nthe spot, a struggle of several hours. Forty-five thousand good troops\r\nlost scarcely two hundred men in this struggle for, with like arms,\r\ncourage and ability, Pompey's infantry ought not to have lost in\r\nhand-to-hand fighting more than that of Caesar's. These same\r\nforty-five thousand men gave way, and, merely between the battle field\r\nand their camp, twelve thousand were slaughtered.\r\n\r\nPompey's men had twice the depth of Caesar's ranks, whose attack did\r\nnot make them fall back a step. On the other hand their mass was\r\nunable to repel him, and he was fought on the spot. Pompey had\r\nannounced to them, says Caesar, that the enemy's army would be turned\r\nby his cavalry, and suddenly, when they were fighting bravely, step by\r\nstep, they heard behind them the shouts of attack by the six cohorts\r\nof Caesar, two thousand men.\r\n\r\nDoes it seem an easy matter for such a force to ward off this menace?\r\nNo. The wing taken in rear in this way loses ground; more and more the\r\ncontagion of fear spreads to the rest. Terror is so great that they do\r\nnot think of re-forming in their camp, which is defended for a moment\r\nonly by the cohorts on guard. Just as at Cannae, their arms drop from\r\ntheir hands. But for the good conduct of the camp guards which\r\npermitted the fugitives to gain the mountains, the twenty-four\r\nthousand prisoners of the next day might have been corpses that very\r\nday.\r\n\r\nCannae and Pharsalus, are sufficient to illustrate ancient combat. Let\r\nus, however, add some other characteristic examples, which we shall\r\nselect briefly and in chronological order. They will complete our\r\ndata. [17]\r\n\r\nLivy relates that in an action against some of the peoples in the\r\nneighborhood of Rome, I do not recall now which, the Romans did not\r\ndare to pursue for fear of breaking their ranks.\r\n\r\nIn a fight against the Hernici, he cites the Roman horsemen, who had\r\nnot been able to do anything on horseback to break up the enemy,\r\nasking the consul for permission to dismount and fight on foot. This\r\nis true not only of Roman cavalrymen, for later on we shall see the\r\nbest riders, the Gauls, the Germans, the Parthanians even, dismounting\r\nin order really to fight.\r\n\r\nThe Volsci, the Latini, the Hernici, etc., combined to fight the\r\nRomans; and as the action nears its end, Livy relates: \"Finally, the\r\nfirst ranks having fallen, and carnage being all about them, they\r\nthrew away their arms and started to scatter. The cavalry then dashed\r\nforward, with orders not to kill the isolated ones, but to harass the\r\nmass with their arrows, annoy it, to delay it, to prevent dispersion\r\nin order to permit the infantry to come up and kill.\"\r\n\r\nIn Hamilcar's engagement against the mercenaries in revolt, who up to\r\nthen had always beaten the Carthaginians, the mercenaries endeavored\r\nto envelop him. Hamilcar surprised them by a new maneuver and defeated\r\nthem. He marched in three lines: elephants, cavalry and light\r\ninfantry, then heavily armed phalanxes. At the approach of the\r\nmercenaries who were marching vigorously towards him the two lines\r\nformed by the elephants, the cavalry and light infantry, turned about\r\nand moved quickly to place themselves on the flanks of the third line.\r\nThe third line thus exposed met a foe which had thought only of\r\npursuit, and which the surprise put to flight. It thus abandoned\r\nitself to the action of the elephants, horses and the light infantry\r\nwho massacred the fugitives.\r\n\r\nHamilcar killed six thousand men, captured two thousand and lost\r\npractically nobody. It was a question as to whether he had lost a\r\nsingle man, since there had been no combat.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Lake Trasimenus, the Carthaginians lost fifteen\r\nhundred men, nearly all Gauls; the Romans fifteen thousand and fifteen\r\nthousand prisoners. The battle raged for three hours.\r\n\r\nAt Zama, Hannibal had twenty thousand killed, twenty thousand\r\nprisoners; the Romans two thousand killed. This was a serious struggle\r\nin which Hannibal's third line alone fought. It gave way only under\r\nthe attack on its rear and flank by the cavalry.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Cynoscephalae, between Philip and Flaminius, Philip\r\npressed Flaminius with his phalanx thirty-two deep. Twenty maniples\r\ntook the phalanx from behind. The battle was lost by Philip. The\r\nRomans had seven hundred killed; the Macedonians eighty thousand, and\r\nfive thousand prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt Pydna, Aemilius Paulus against Perseus, the phalanx marched without\r\nbeing stopped. But gaps occurred from the resistance that it\r\nencountered. Hundreds penetrated into the gaps in the phalanx and\r\nkilled the men embarrassed with their long pikes. They were effective\r\nonly when united, abreast, and at shaft's length. There was frightful\r\ndisorder and butchery; twenty thousand killed, five thousand captured\r\nout of forty-four thousand engaged! The historian does not deem it\r\nworth while to speak of the Roman losses.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Aix against the Teutons, Marius surprised the\r\nTeutons from behind. There was frightful carnage; one hundred thousand\r\nTeutons and three hundred Romans killed. [18]\r\n\r\nIn Sulla's battle of Chaeronea against Archelaus, a general of\r\nMithridates, Sulla had about thirty thousand men, Archelaus, one\r\nhundred and ten thousand. Archelaus was beaten by being surprised from\r\nthe rear. The Romans lost fourteen men, and killed their enemies until\r\nworn out in pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Orchomenus, against Archelaus, was a repetition of\r\nChaeronea.\r\n\r\nCaesar states that his cavalry could not fight the Britons without\r\ngreatly exposing itself, because they pretended flight in order to get\r\nthe cavalry away from the infantry and then, dashing from their\r\nchariots, they fought on foot with advantage.\r\n\r\nA little less than two hundred veterans embarked on a boat which they\r\nran aground at night so as not to be taken by superior naval forces.\r\nThey reached an advantageous position and passed the night. At the\r\nbreak of day, Otacilius dispatched some four hundred horsemen and some\r\ninfantry from the Alesio garrison against them. They defended\r\nthemselves bravely; and having killed some, they rejoined Caesar's\r\ntroops without having lost a single man.\r\n\r\nIn Macedonia Caesar's rear-guard was caught by Pompey's cavalry at the\r\npassage of the Genusus River, the banks of which were quite steep.\r\nCaesar opposed Pompey's cavalry five to seven thousand strong, with\r\nhis cavalry of six hundred to one thousand men, among which he had\r\ntaken care to intermingle four hundred picked infantrymen. They did\r\ntheir duty so well that, in the combat that followed, they repulsed\r\nthe enemy, killed many, and fell back upon their own army without the\r\nloss of a single man.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Thapsus in Africa, against Scipio, Caesar killed ten\r\nthousand, lost fifty, and had some wounded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the battle under the walls of Munda in Spain, against one of\r\nPompey's sons, Caesar had eighty cohorts and eight thousand horsemen,\r\nabout forty-eight thousand men. Pompey with thirteen legions had sixty\r\nthousand troops of the line, six thousand cavalry, six thousand light\r\ninfantry, six thousand auxiliaries; in all, about eighty thousand men.\r\nThe struggle, says the narrator, was valiantly kept up, step by step,\r\nsword to sword. [19]\r\n\r\nIn that battle of exceptional fury, which hung for a long time in the\r\nbalance, Caesar had one thousand dead, five hundred wounded; Pompey\r\nthirty-three thousand dead, and if Munda had not been so near,\r\nscarcely two miles away, his losses would have been doubled. The\r\ndefensive works of Munda were constructed from dead bodies and\r\nabandoned arms.\r\n\r\nIn studying ancient combats, it can be seen that it was almost always\r\nan attack from the flank or rear, a surprise action, that won battles,\r\nespecially against the Romans. It was in this way that their excellent\r\ntactics might be confused. Roman tactics were so excellent that a\r\nRoman general who was only half as good as his adversary was sure to\r\nbe victorious. By surprise alone they could be conquered. Note\r\nXanthippe,--Hannibal--the unexpected fighting methods of the Gauls,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIndeed Xenophon says somewhere, \"Be it agreeable or terrible, the less\r\nanything is foreseen, the more does it cause pleasure or dismay. This\r\nis nowhere better illustrated than in war where every surprise strikes\r\nterror even to those who are much the stronger.\"\r\n\r\nBut very few fighters armed with cuirass and shield were killed in the\r\nfront lines.\r\n\r\nHannibal in his victories lost almost nobody but Gauls, his\r\ncannon-fodder, who fought with poor shields and without armor.\r\n\r\nNearly always driven in, they fought, nevertheless, with a tenacity\r\nthat they never showed under any other command.\r\n\r\nThucydides characterizes the combat of the lightly armed, by saying:\r\n\"As a rule, the lightly armed of both sides took to flight.\" [20]\r\n\r\nIn combat with closed ranks there was mutual pressure but little loss,\r\nthe men not being at liberty to strike in their own way and with all\r\ntheir force.\r\n\r\nCaesar against the Nervii, saw his men, who in the midst of the action\r\nhad instinctively closed in mass in order to resist the mass of\r\nbarbarians, giving way under pressure. He therefore ordered his ranks\r\nand files to open, so that his legionaries, closed in mass, paralyzed\r\nand forced to give way to a very strong pressure, might be able to\r\nkill and consequently demoralize the enemy. And indeed, as soon as a\r\nman in the front rank of the Nervii fell under the blows of the\r\nlegionaries, there was a halt, a falling back. Following an attack\r\nfrom the rear, and a melee, the defeat of the Nervii ensued. [21]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMORALE IN ANCIENT BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now know the morale and mechanism of ancient fighting; the word\r\nmelee employed by the ancients was many times stronger than the idea\r\nto be expressed; it meant a crossing of arms, not a confusion of men.\r\n\r\nThe results of battles, such as losses, suffice to demonstrate this,\r\nand an instant of reflection makes us see the error of the word melee.\r\nIn pursuit it was possible to plunge into the midst of the fugitives,\r\nbut in combat every one had too much need for the next man, for his\r\nneighbor, who was guarding his flanks and his back, to let himself be\r\nkilled out of sheer wantonness by a sure blow from within the ranks of\r\nthe enemy. [22]\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of a real melee, Caesar at Pharsalus, and Hannibal at\r\nCannae, would have been conquered. Their shallow ranks, penetrated by\r\nthe enemy, would have had to fight two against one, they would even\r\nhave been taken in rear in consequence of the breaking of their ranks.\r\n\r\nAlso has there not been seen, in troops equally reliable and\r\ndesperate, that mutual weariness which brings about, with tacit\r\naccord, falling back for a breathing spell on both sides in order\r\nagain to take up the battle?\r\n\r\nHow can this be possible with a melee?\r\n\r\nWith the confusion and medley of combatants, there might be a mutual\r\nextermination, but there would not be any victors. How would they\r\nrecognize each other? Can you conceive two mixed masses of men or\r\ngroups, where every one occupied in front can be struck with impunity\r\nfrom the side or from behind? That is mutual extermination, where\r\nvictory belongs only to survivors; for in the mix-up and confusion, no\r\none can flee, no one knows where to flee.\r\n\r\nAfter all, are not the losses we have seen on both sides demonstration\r\nthat there was no real melee?\r\n\r\nThe word is, therefore, too strong; the imagination of painters' and\r\npoets' has created the melee.\r\n\r\nThis is what happened:\r\n\r\nAt a charging distance troops marched towards the enemy with all the\r\nspeed compatible with the necessity for fencing and mutual aid. Quite\r\noften, the moral impulse, that resolution to go to the end, manifested\r\nitself at once in the order and freedom of gait. That impulse alone\r\nput to flight a less resolute adversary.\r\n\r\nIt was customary among good troops to have a clash, but not the blind\r\nand headlong onset of the mass; the preoccupation [23] of the rank was\r\nvery great, as the behavior of Caesar's troops at Pharsalus shows in\r\ntheir slow march, timed by the flutes of Lacedaemonian battalions. At\r\nthe moment of getting close to the enemy, the dash slackened of its\r\nown accord, because the men of the first rank, of necessity and\r\ninstinctively, assured themselves of the position of their supports,\r\ntheir neighbors in the same line, their comrades in the second, and\r\ncollected themselves together in order to be more the masters of their\r\nmovements to strike and parry. There was a contact of man with man;\r\neach took the adversary in front of him and attacked him, because by\r\npenetrating into the ranks before having struck him down, he risked\r\nbeing wounded in the side by losing his flank supports. Each one then\r\nhit his man with his shield, expecting to make him lose his equilibrium,\r\nand at the instant he tried to recover himself landed the blow. The men\r\nin the second line, back of the intervals necessary for fencing in the\r\nfirst, were ready to protect their sides against any one that advanced\r\nbetween them and were prepared to relieve tired warriors. It was the\r\nsame in the third line, and so on.\r\n\r\nEvery one being supported on either side, the first encounter was\r\nrarely decisive, and the fencing, the real combat at close quarters,\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nIf men of the first line were wounded quickly, if the other ranks were\r\nnot in a hurry to relieve or replace them, or if there was hesitation,\r\ndefeat followed. This happened to the Romans in their first encounters\r\nwith the Gauls. The Gaul, with his shield, parried the first thrust,\r\nbrought his big iron sword swooping down with fury upon the top of the\r\nRoman shield, split it and went after the man. The Romans, already\r\nhesitating before the moral impulse of the Gauls, their ferocious\r\nyells, their nudeness, an indication of a contempt for wounds, fell\r\nthen in a greater number than their adversaries and demoralization\r\nfollowed. Soon they accustomed themselves to this valorous but not\r\ntenacious spirit of their enemies, and when they had protected the top\r\nof their shields with an iron band, they no longer fell, and the roles\r\nwere changed.\r\n\r\nThe Gauls, in fact, were unable either to hold their ground against\r\nthe better arms and the thrusts of the Romans, or against their\r\nindividual superior tenacity, increased nearly tenfold by the possible\r\nrelay of eight ranks of the maniple. The maniples were self-renewing.\r\nWhereas with the Gauls the duration of the combat was limited to the\r\nstrength of a single man, on account of the difficulties of close or\r\ntumultuous ranks, and the impossibility of replacing losses when they\r\nwere fighting at close quarters.\r\n\r\nIf the weapons were nearly alike, preserving ranks and thereby\r\nbreaking down, driving back and confusing the ranks of the enemy, was\r\nto conquer. The man in disordered, broken lines, no longer felt\r\nhimself supported, but vulnerable everywhere, and he fled. It is true\r\nthat it is hardly possible to break hostile lines without doing the\r\nsame with one's own. But the one who breaks through first, has been\r\nable to do so only by making the foe fall back before his blows, by\r\nkilling or wounding. He has thereby raised his courage and that of his\r\nneighbor. He knows, he sees where he is marching; whilst the adversary\r\novertaken as a consequence of the retreat or the fall of the troops\r\nthat were flanking him, is surprised. He sees himself exposed on the\r\nflank. He falls back on a line with the rank in rear in order to\r\nregain support. But the lines in the rear give way to the retreat of\r\nthe first. If the withdrawal has a certain duration, terror comes as a\r\nresult of the blows which drive back and mow down the first line. If,\r\nto make room for those pushed back, the last lines turn their backs,\r\nthere is small chance that they will face the front again. Space has\r\ntempted them. They will not return to the fight.\r\n\r\nThen by that natural instinct of the soldier to worry, to assure\r\nhimself of his supports, the contagion of flight spreads from the last\r\nranks to the first. The first, closely engaged, has been held to the\r\nfight in the meantime, under pain of immediate death. There is no need\r\nto explain what follows; it is butchery. (Caedes).\r\n\r\nBut to return to combat.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the formation of troops in a straight line, drawn\r\nclose together, existed scarcely an instant. Moreover each group of\r\nfiles formed in action was connected with the next group; the groups,\r\nlike the individuals, were always concerned about their support. The\r\nfight took place along the line of contact of the first ranks of the\r\narmy, a straight line, broken, curved, and bent in different\r\ndirections according to the various chances of the action at such or\r\nsuch a point, but always restricting and separating the combatants of\r\nthe two sides. Once engaged on that line, it was necessary to face the\r\nfront under pain of immediate death. Naturally and necessarily every\r\none in these first ranks exerted all his energy to defend his life.\r\n\r\nAt no point did the line become entangled as long as there was\r\nfighting, for, general or soldier, the effort of each one was to keep\r\nup the continuity of support all along the line, and to break or cut\r\nthat of the enemy, because victory then followed.\r\n\r\nWe see then that between men armed with swords, it was possible to\r\nhave, and there was, if the combat was serious, penetration of one\r\nmass into the other, but never confusion, or a jumble of ranks, by the\r\nmen forming these masses. [24]\r\n\r\nSword to sword combat was the most deadly. It presented the most\r\nsudden changes, because it was the one in which the individual valor\r\nand dexterity of the combatant had the greatest and most immediate\r\ninfluence. Other methods of combat were simpler.\r\n\r\nLet us compare pikes and broadswords.\r\n\r\nThe close formation of men armed with pikes was irresistible so long\r\nas it was maintained. A forest of pikes fifteen to eighteen feet long\r\nkept you at a distance. [25] On the other hand it was easy to kill off\r\nthe cavalry and light infantry about the phalanx, which was an\r\nunwieldy mass marching with a measured step, and which a mobile\r\nbody of troops could always avoid. Openings in the phalanx might\r\nbe occasioned by marching, by the terrain, by the thousand accidents\r\nof struggle, by the individual assault of brave men, by the wounded\r\non the ground creeping under the high held pikes and cutting at the\r\nlegs of the front rank. Men in the phalanx could scarcely see and even\r\nthe first two lines hardly had a free position for striking. The men\r\nwere armed with long lances, useless at close quarters, good only for\r\ncombat at shaft's length (Polybius). They were struck with impunity by\r\nthe groups [26] which threw themselves into the intervals. And then,\r\nonce the enemy was in the body of the phalanx, morale disappeared\r\nand it became a mass without order, a flock of panic-stricken sheep\r\nfalling over each other.\r\n\r\nIn a mob hard-pressed men prick with their knives those who press\r\nthem. The contagion of fear changes the direction of the human wave;\r\nit bends back upon itself and breaks to escape danger. If, then, the\r\nenemy fled before the phalanx there was no melee. If he gave way\r\ntactically before it and availing himself of gaps penetrated it by\r\ngroups, still there was no melee or mixture of ranks. The wedge\r\nentering into a mass does not become intermingled with it.\r\n\r\nWith a phalanx armed with long pikes against a similar phalanx there\r\nwas still less confusion. They were able to stand for a long time, if\r\nthe one did not take the other in flank or in rear by a detached body\r\nof troops. In all ancient combat, even in victory achieved by methods\r\nwhich affected the morale, such methods are always effective, for man\r\ndoes not change.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to repeat that in ancient conflicts, demoralization\r\nand flight began in the rear ranks.\r\n\r\nWe have tried to analyze the fight of infantry of the line because its\r\naction alone was decisive in ancient combat. The light infantry of\r\nboth sides took to flight, as Thucydides states. They returned later\r\nto pursue and massacre the vanquished. [27]\r\n\r\nIn cavalry against cavalry, the moral effect of a mass charging in\r\ngood order was of the greatest influence. We rarely see two cavalry\r\norganizations, neither of which breaks before such reciprocal action.\r\nSuch action was seen on the Tecinus and at Cannae, engagements cited\r\nmerely because they are very rare exceptions. And even in these cases\r\nthere was no shock at full speed, but a halt face to face and then an\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nThe hurricanes of cavalry of those days were poetic figures. They had\r\nno reality. In an encounter at full speed, men and horses would be\r\ncrushed, and neither men nor horses wished such an encounter. The\r\nhands of the cavalrymen reined back, the instinct of men and horses\r\nwas to slacken, to stop, if the enemy himself did not stop, and to\r\nmake an about if he continued to advance. And if ever they met, the\r\nencounter was so weakened by the hands of the men, the rearing of the\r\nhorses, the swinging of heads, that it was a face to face stop. Some\r\nblows were exchanged with the sword or the lance, but the equilibrium\r\nwas too unstable, mutual support too uncertain for real sword play.\r\nMan felt himself too isolated. The moral pressure was too strong.\r\nAlthough not deadly, the combat lasted but a second, precisely because\r\nman felt himself, saw himself, alone and surrounded. The first men,\r\nwho believed themselves no longer supported, could no longer endure\r\nuneasiness: they wheeled about and the rest followed. Unless the enemy\r\nhad also turned, he then pursued at his pleasure until checked by\r\nother cavalry, which pursued him in turn.\r\n\r\nThere never was an encounter between cavalry and infantry. The cavalry\r\nharassed with its arrows, with the lance perhaps, while passing\r\nrapidly, but it never attacked.\r\n\r\nClose conflict on horseback did not exist. And to be sure, if the\r\nhorse by adding so much to the mobility of man gave him the means of\r\nmenacing and charging with swiftness, it permitted him to escape with\r\nlike rapidity when his menace did not shake the enemy. Man by using\r\nthe horse, pursuant to his natural inclination and sane reasoning,\r\ncould do as much damage as possible while risking the least possible.\r\nTo riders without stirrups or saddle, for whom the throwing of the\r\njavelin was a difficult matter (Xenophon), combat was but a succession\r\nof reciprocal harassings, demonstrations, menaces, skirmishes with\r\narrows. Each cavalry sought an opportunity to surprise, to intimidate,\r\nto avail itself of disorder, and to pursue either the cavalry or the\r\ninfantry. Then \"vae victis;\" the sword worked.\r\n\r\nMan always has had the greatest fear of being trampled upon by horses.\r\nThat fear has certainly routed a hundred thousand times more men than\r\nthe real encounter. This was always more or less avoided by the horse,\r\nand no one was knocked down. When two ancient cavalry forces wanted\r\nreally to fight, were forced to it, they fought on foot (Note the\r\nTecinus, Cannae, examples of Livy). I find but little real fighting on\r\nhorseback in all antiquity like that of Alexander the Great at the\r\npassage of the Granicus. Was even that fighting? His cavalry which\r\ntraversed a river with steep banks defended by the enemy, lost\r\neighty-five men; the Persian cavalry one thousand; and both were\r\nequally well armed!\r\n\r\nThe fighting of the Middle Ages revived the ancient battles except in\r\nscience. Cavalrymen attacked each other perhaps more than the ancient\r\ncavalry did, for the reason that they were invulnerable: it was not\r\nsufficient to throw them down; it was necessary to kill when once they\r\nwere on the ground. They knew, however, that their fighting on\r\nhorseback was not important so far as results were concerned, for when\r\nthey wished really to battle, they fought on foot. (Note the combat of\r\nthe Thirty, Bayard, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe victors, arrayed in iron from head to foot, lost no one, the\r\npeasants did not count. If the vanquished was taken, he was not\r\nmassacred, because chivalry had established a fraternity of arms\r\nbetween noblemen, the mounted warriors of different nations, and\r\nransom replaced death.\r\n\r\nIf we have spoken especially of the infantry fight, it is because it\r\nwas the most serious. On foot, on horseback, on the bridge of a\r\nvessel, at the moment of danger, the same man is always found. Any one\r\nwho knows him well, deduces from his action in the past what his\r\naction will be in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nUNDER WHAT CONDITIONS REAL COMBATANTS ARE OBTAINED AND HOW THE\r\nFIGHTING OF OUR DAYS, IN ORDER TO BE WELL DONE, REQUIRES THEM TO BE\r\nMORE DEPENDABLE THAN IN ANCIENT COMBAT\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us repeat now, what we said at the beginning of this study. Man\r\ndoes not enter battle to fight, but for victory. He does everything\r\nthat he can to avoid the first and obtain the second. The continued\r\nimprovement of all appliances of war has no other goal than the\r\nannihilation of the enemy. Absolute bravery, which does not refuse\r\nbattle even on unequal terms, trusting only to God or to destiny, is\r\nnot natural in man; it is the result of moral culture. It is\r\ninfinitely rare, because in the face of danger the animal sense of\r\nself-preservation always gains the upper hand. Man calculates his\r\nchances, with what errors we are about to see.\r\n\r\nNow, man has a horror of death. In the bravest, a great sense of duty,\r\nwhich they alone are capable of understanding and living up to, is\r\nparamount. But the mass always cowers at sight of the phantom, death.\r\nDiscipline is for the purpose of dominating that horror by a still\r\ngreater horror, that of punishment or disgrace. But there always comes\r\nan instant when natural horror gets an upper hand over discipline, and\r\nthe fighter flees. \"Stop, stop, hold out a few minutes, an instant\r\nmore, and you are victor! You are not even wounded yet,--if you turn\r\nyour back you are dead!\" He does not hear, he cannot hear any more. He\r\nis full of fear. How many armies have sworn to conquer or perish? How\r\nmany have kept their oaths? An oath of sheep to stand up against\r\nwolves. History shows, not armies, but firm souls who have fought unto\r\ndeath, and the devotion of Thermopylae is therefore justly immortal.\r\n\r\nHere we are again brought to the consideration of essential truths,\r\nenunciated by many men, now forgotten or unknown.\r\n\r\nTo insure success in the rude test of conflict, it is not sufficient\r\nto have a mass composed of valiant men like the Gauls or the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe mass needs, and we give it, leaders who have the firmness and\r\ndecision of command proceeding from habit and an entire faith in their\r\nunquestionable right to command as established by tradition, law and\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nWe add good arms. We add methods of fighting suitable to these arms\r\nand those of the enemy and which do not overtax the physical and moral\r\nforces of man. We add also a rational decentralization that permits\r\nthe direction and employment of the efforts of all even to the last\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWe animate with passion, a violent desire for independence, a\r\nreligious fanaticism, national pride, a love of glory, a madness for\r\npossession. An iron discipline, which permits no one to escape action,\r\nsecures the greatest unity from top to bottom, between all the\r\nelements, between the commanding officers, between the commanding\r\nofficers and men, between the soldiers.\r\n\r\nHave we then a solid army? Not yet. Unity, that first and supreme\r\nforce of armies, is sought by enacting severe laws of discipline\r\nsupported by powerful passions. But to order discipline is not enough.\r\nA vigilance from which no one may escape in combat should assure the\r\nmaintenance of discipline. Discipline itself depends on moral pressure\r\nwhich actuates men to advance from sentiments of fear or pride. But it\r\ndepends also on surveillance, the mutual supervision of groups of men\r\nwho know each other well.\r\n\r\nA wise organization insures that the personnel of combat groups\r\nchanges as little as possible, so that comrades in peace time\r\nmaneuvers shall be comrades in war. From living together, and obeying\r\nthe same chiefs, from commanding the same men, from sharing fatigue\r\nand rest, from cooeperation among men who quickly understand each other\r\nin the execution of warlike movements, may be bred brotherhood,\r\nprofessional knowledge, sentiment, above all unity. The duty of\r\nobedience, the right of imposing discipline and the impossibility of\r\nescaping from it, would naturally follow.\r\n\r\nAnd now confidence appears.\r\n\r\nIt is not that enthusiastic and thoughtless confidence of tumultous or\r\nunprepared armies which goes up to the danger point and vanishes\r\nrapidly, giving way to a contrary sentiment, which sees treason\r\neverywhere. It is that intimate confidence, firm and conscious, which\r\ndoes not forget itself in the heat of action and which alone makes\r\ntrue combatants.\r\n\r\nThen we have an army; and it is no longer difficult to explain how men\r\ncarried away by passions, even men who know how to die without\r\nflinching, without turning pale, really strong in the presence of\r\ndeath, but without discipline, without solid organization, are\r\nvanquished by others individually less valiant, but firmly, jointly\r\nand severally combined.\r\n\r\nOne loves to picture an armed mob upsetting all obstacles and carried\r\naway by a blast of passion.\r\n\r\nThere is more imagination than truth in that picture. If the struggle\r\ndepended on individuals, the courageous, impassioned men, composing\r\nthe mob would have more chance of victory. But in any body of troops,\r\nin front of the enemy, every one understands that the task is not the\r\nwork of one alone, that to complete it requires team work. With his\r\ncomrades in danger brought together under unknown leaders, he feels\r\nthe lack of union, and asks himself if he can count on them. A thought\r\nof mistrust leads to hesitation. A moment of it will kill the\r\noffensive spirit.\r\n\r\nUnity and confidence cannot be improvised. They alone can create that\r\nmutual trust, that feeling of force which gives courage and daring.\r\nCourage, that is the temporary domination of will over instinct,\r\nbrings about victory.\r\n\r\nUnity alone then produces fighters. But, as in everything, there are\r\ndegrees of unity. Let us see whether modern is in this respect less\r\nexacting than ancient combat.\r\n\r\nIn ancient combat there was danger only at close quarters. If the\r\ntroops had enough morale (which Asiatic hordes seldom had) to meet the\r\nenemy at broadsword's length, there was an engagement. Whoever was\r\nthat close knew that he would be killed if he turned his back;\r\nbecause, as we have seen, the victors lost but few and the vanquished\r\nwere exterminated. This simple reasoning held the men and made them\r\nfight, if it was but for an instant.\r\n\r\nNeglecting the exceptional and very rare circumstances, which may\r\nbring two forces together, action to-day is brought on and fought out\r\nfrom afar. Danger begins at great distances, and it is necessary to\r\nadvance for a long time under fire which at each step becomes heavier.\r\nThe vanquished loses prisoners, but often, in dead and in wounded, he\r\ndoes not lose more than the victor.\r\n\r\nAncient combat was fought in groups close together, within a small\r\nspace, in open ground, in full view of one another, without the\r\ndeafening noise of present day arms. Men in formation marched into an\r\naction that took place on the spot and did not carry them thousands of\r\nfeet away from the starting point. The surveillance of the leaders was\r\neasy, individual weakness was immediately checked. General\r\nconsternation alone caused flight.\r\n\r\nTo-day fighting is done over immense spaces, along thinly drawn out\r\nlines broken every instant by the accidents and the obstacles of the\r\nterrain. From the time the action begins, as soon as there are rifle\r\nshots, the men spread out as skirmishers or, lost in the inevitable\r\ndisorder of a rapid march, [28] escape the supervision of their\r\ncommanding officers. A considerable number conceal themselves; [29]\r\nthey get away from the engagement and diminish by just so much\r\nthe material and moral effect and confidence of the brave ones\r\nwho remain. This can bring about defeat.\r\n\r\nBut let us look at man himself in ancient combat and in modern. In\r\nancient combat:--I am strong, apt, vigorous, trained, full of\r\ncalmness, presence of mind; I have good offensive and defensive\r\nweapons and trustworthy companions of long standing. They do not let\r\nme be overwhelmed without aiding me. I with them, they with me, we are\r\ninvincible, even invulnerable. We have fought twenty battles and not\r\none of us remained on the field. It is necessary to support each other\r\nin time; we see it clearly; we are quick to replace ourselves, to put\r\na fresh combatant in front of a fatigued adversary. We are the legions\r\nof Marius, fifty thousand who have held out against the furious\r\navalanches of the Cimbri. We have killed one hundred and forty\r\nthousand, taken prisoner sixty thousand, while losing but two or three\r\nhundred of our inexperienced soldiers.\r\n\r\nTo-day, as strong, firm, trained, and courageous as I am, I can never\r\nsay; I shall return. I have no longer to do with men, whom I do not\r\nfear, I have to do with fate in the form of iron and lead. Death is in\r\nthe air, invisible and blind, whispering, whistling. As brave, good,\r\ntrustworthy, and devoted as my companions may be, they do not shield\r\nme. Only,--and this is abstract and less immediately intelligible to\r\nall than the material support of ancient combat,--only I imagine that\r\nthe more numerous we are who run a dangerous risk, the greater is the\r\nchance for each to escape therefrom. I also know that, if we have that\r\nconfidence which none of us should lack in action, we feel, and we\r\nare, stronger. We begin more resolutely, are ready to keep up the\r\nstruggle longer, and therefore finish it more quickly.\r\n\r\nWe finish it! But in order to finish it, it is necessary to advance,\r\nto attack the enemy, [30] and infantryman or troopers, we are naked\r\nagainst iron, naked against lead, which cannot miss at close range.\r\nLet us advance in any case, resolutely. Our adversary will not stand\r\nat the point-blank range of our rifle, for the attack is never mutual,\r\nwe are sure of that. We have been told so a thousand times. We have\r\nseen it. But what if matters should change now! Suppose the enemy\r\nstands at point-blank range! What of that?\r\n\r\nHow far this is from Roman confidence!\r\n\r\nIn another place we have shown that in ancient times to retire from\r\naction was both a difficult and perilous matter for the soldier.\r\nTo-day the temptation is much stronger, the facility greater and the\r\nperil less.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, combat exacts more moral cohesion, greater unity than\r\npreviously. A last remark on the difficulty of obtaining it will\r\ncomplete the demonstration.\r\n\r\nSince the invention of fire arms, the musket, the rifle, the cannon,\r\nthe distances of mutual aid and support have increased among the\r\ndifferent arms. [31]\r\n\r\nBesides, the facility of communications of all kinds permits the\r\nassembling on a given territory of enormous forces. For these reasons,\r\nas we have stated, battle fields have become immense.\r\n\r\nSupervision becomes more and more difficult. Direction being more\r\ndistant tends more often to escape from the supreme commanders and the\r\nsubordinate leaders. The certain and inevitable disorder, which a body\r\nof troops always presents in action, is with the moral effect of\r\nmodern appliances, becoming greater every day. In the midst of the\r\nconfusion and the vacillation of firing lines, men and commanding\r\nofficers often lose each other.\r\n\r\nTroops immediately and hotly engaged, such as companies and squads,\r\ncan maintain themselves only if they are well-organized and serve as\r\nsupports or rallying points to those out of place. Battles tend to\r\nbecome now, more than they have ever been, the battles of men.\r\n\r\nThis ought not to be true! Perhaps. But the fact is that it is true.\r\n\r\nNot all troops are immediately or hotly engaged in battle. Commanding\r\nofficers always try to keep in hand, as long as possible, some troops\r\ncapable of marching, acting at any moment, in any direction. To-day,\r\nlike yesterday, like to-morrow, the decisive action is that of formed\r\ntroops. Victory belongs to the commander who has known how to keep\r\nthem in good order, to hold them, and to direct them.\r\n\r\nThat is incontrovertible.\r\n\r\nBut commanders can hold out decisive reserves only if the enemy has\r\nbeen forced to commit his.\r\n\r\nIn troops which do the fighting, the men and the officers closest to\r\nthem, from corporal to battalion commander, have a more independent\r\naction than ever. As it is alone the vigor of that action, more\r\nindependent than ever of the direction of higher commanders, which\r\nleaves in the hands of higher commanders available forces which can be\r\ndirected at a decisive moment, that action becomes more preponderant\r\nthan ever. Battles, now more than ever, are battles of men, of\r\ncaptains. They always have been in fact, since in the last analysis\r\nthe execution belongs to the man in ranks. But the influence of the\r\nlatter on the final result is greater than formerly. From that comes\r\nthe maxim of to-day: The battles of men.\r\n\r\nOutside of the regulations on tactics and discipline, there is an\r\nevident necessity for combating the hazardous predominance of the\r\naction of the soldier over that of the commander. It is necessary to\r\ndelay as long as possible, that instant which modern conditions tend\r\nto hasten--the instant when the soldier gets from under the control of\r\nthe commander.\r\n\r\nThis completes the demonstration of the truth stated before: Combat\r\nrequires to-day, in order to give the best results, a moral cohesion,\r\na unity more binding than at any other time. [32] It is as true as it\r\nis clear, that, if one does not wish bonds to break, one must make\r\nthem elastic in order to strengthen them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPURPOSE OF THIS STUDY\r\nWHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE IT\r\n\r\n\r\nAny other deductions on this subject must come from the meditations of\r\nthe reader. To be of value in actual application such deductions\r\nshould be based upon study of modern combat, and that study cannot be\r\nmade from the accounts of historians alone.\r\n\r\nThe latter show the action of troop units only in a general way.\r\nAction in detail and the individual action of the soldier remain\r\nenveloped in a cloud of dust, in narratives as in reality. Yet these\r\nquestions must be studied, for the conditions they reveal should be\r\nthe basis of all fighting methods, past, present and future.\r\n\r\nWhere can data on these questions be found?\r\n\r\nWe have very few records portraying action as clearly as the report on\r\nthe engagement at the Pont de l'Hopital by Colonel Bugeaud. Such\r\nstories in even greater detail, for the smallest detail has its\r\nimportance, secured from participants and witnesses who knew how to\r\nsee and knew how to remember, are what is necessary in a study of the\r\nbattle of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe number of killed, the kind and the character of wounds, often tell\r\nmore than the longest accounts. Sometimes they contradict them. We\r\nwant to know how man in general and the Frenchman in particular fought\r\nyesterday. Under the pressure of danger, impelled by the instinct for\r\nself-preservation, did he follow, make light of, or forget the methods\r\nprescribed or recommended? Did he fight in the manner imposed upon\r\nhim, or in that indicated to him by his instinct or by his knowledge\r\nof warfare?\r\n\r\nWhen we have the answers to these questions we shall be very near to\r\nknowing how he will conduct himself to-morrow, with and against\r\nappliances far more destructive to-day than those of yesterday. Even\r\nnow, knowing that man is capable only of a given quantity of terror,\r\nknowing that the moral effect of destruction is in proportion to the\r\nforce applied, we are able to predict that, to-morrow less than ever\r\nwill studied methods be practicable. Such methods are born of the\r\nillusions of the field of fire and are opposed to the teachings of our\r\nown experience. To-morrow, more than ever, will the individual valor\r\nof the soldier and of small groups, be predominant. This valor is\r\nsecured by discipline.\r\n\r\nThe study of the past alone can give us a true perception of practical\r\nmethods, and enable us to see how the soldier will inevitably fight\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nSo instructed, so informed, we shall not be confused; because we shall\r\nbe able to prescribe beforehand such methods of fighting, such\r\norganization, such dispositions as are seen to be inevitable. Such\r\nprescriptions may even serve to regulate the inevitable. At any rate\r\nthey will serve to reduce the element of chance by enabling the\r\ncommanding officer to retain control as long as possible, and by\r\nreleasing the individual only at the moment when instinct dominates\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis is the only way to preserve discipline, which has a tendency to\r\ngo to pieces by tactical disobedience at the moment of greatest\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that the prescriptions in question have to do\r\nwith dispositions before action; with methods of fighting, and not\r\nwith maneuvers.\r\n\r\nManeuvers are the movements of troops in the theater of action, and\r\nthey are the swift and ordered movement on the scene of action of\r\ntactical units of all sizes. They do not constitute action. Action\r\nfollows them.\r\n\r\nConfusion in many minds between maneuvers and action brings about\r\ndoubt and mistrust of our regulation drills. These are good, very good\r\nas far as they go, inasmuch as they give methods of executing all\r\nmovements, of taking all possible formations with rapidity and good\r\norder.\r\n\r\nTo change them, to discuss them, does not advance the question one\r\nbit. They do not affect the problem of positive action. Its solution\r\nlies in the study of what took place yesterday, from which, alone, it\r\nis possible to deduce what will happen to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThis study must be made, and its result set forth. Each leader, whose\r\nworth and authority has been tested in war and recognized by armies,\r\nhas done something of the sort. Of each of these even might be said,\r\n\"He knew the soldier; he knew how to make use of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Romans, too, had this knowledge. They obtained it from continuous\r\nexperience and profound reflexion thereon.\r\n\r\nExperience is not continuous to-day. It must be carefully gathered.\r\nStudy of it should be careful and the results should stimulate\r\nreflexion, especially in men of experience. Extremes meet in many\r\nthings. In ancient times at the point of the pike and sword, armies\r\nhave conquered similar armies twice their size. Who knows if, in these\r\ndays of perfected long-range arms of destruction, a small force might\r\nnot secure, by a happy combination of good sense or genius with morale\r\nand appliances, these same heroic victories over a greater force\r\nsimilarly armed?[33]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the statements of Napoleon I, his assumption that victory\r\nis always on the side of the strongest battalions was costly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. MODERN BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Ancient and Modern Battle\r\n\r\nI have heard philosophers reproached for studying too exclusively man\r\nin general and neglecting the race, the country, the era, so that\r\ntheir studies of him offer little of real social or political value.\r\nThe opposite criticism can be made of military men of all countries.\r\nThey are always eager to expound traditional tactics and organization\r\nsuitable to the particular character of their race, always the bravest\r\nof all races. They fail to consider as a factor in the problem, man\r\nconfronted by danger. Facts are incredibly different from all\r\ntheories. Perhaps in this time of military reorganization it would not\r\nbe out of place to make a study of man in battle and of battle itself.\r\n\r\nThe art of war is subjected to many modifications by industrial and\r\nscientific progress. But one thing does not change, the heart of man.\r\nIn the last analysis, success in battle is a matter of morale. In all\r\nmatters which pertain to an army, organization, discipline and\r\ntactics, the human heart in the supreme moment of battle is the basic\r\nfactor. It is rarely taken into account; and often strange errors are\r\nthe result. Witness the carbine, an accurate and long range weapon,\r\nwhich has never given the service expected of it, because it was used\r\nmechanically without considering the human heart. We must consider it!\r\n\r\nWith improvement in weapons, the power of destruction increases, the\r\nmoral effect of such weapons increases, and courage to face them\r\nbecomes rarer. Man does not, cannot change. What should increase with\r\nthe power of material is the strength of organization, the unity of\r\nthe fighting machine. Yet these are most neglected. A million men at\r\nmaneuvers are useless, if a sane and reasoned organization does not\r\nassure their discipline, and thereby their reliability, that is, their\r\ncourage in action.\r\n\r\nFour brave men who do not know each other will not dare to attack a\r\nlion. Four less brave, but knowing each other well, sure of their\r\nreliability and consequently of mutual aid, will attack resolutely.\r\nThere is the science of the organization of armies in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nAt any time a new invention may assure victory. Granted. But\r\npracticable weapons are not invented every day, and nations quickly\r\nput themselves on the same footing as regards armament. The\r\ndetermining factor, leaving aside generals of genius, and luck, is the\r\nquality of troops, that is, the organization that best assures their\r\nesprit, their reliability, their confidence, their unity. Troops, in\r\nthis sense, means soldiers. Soldiers, no matter how well drilled, who\r\nare assembled haphazard into companies and battalions will never have,\r\nhave never had, that entire unity which is born of mutual\r\nacquaintanceship.\r\n\r\nIn studying ancient battle, we have seen what a terrible thing battle\r\nis. We have seen that man will not really fight except under\r\ndisciplinary pressure. Even before having studied modern battle, we\r\nknow that the only real armies are those to which a well thought out\r\nand rational organization gives unity throughout battle. The\r\ndestructive power of improved firearms becomes greater. Battle becomes\r\nmore open, hindering supervision, passing beyond the vision of the\r\ncommander and even of subordinate officers. In the same degree, unity\r\nshould be strengthened. The organization which assures unity of the\r\ncombatants should be better thought out and more rational. The power\r\nof arms increases, man and his weaknesses remain the same. What good\r\nis an army of two hundred thousand men of whom only one-half really\r\nfight, while the other one hundred thousand disappear in a hundred\r\nways? Better to have one hundred thousand who can be counted upon.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of discipline is to make men fight in spite of themselves.\r\nNo army is worthy of the name without discipline. There is no army at\r\nall without organization, and all organization is defective which\r\nneglects any means to strengthen the unity of combatants. Methods\r\ncannot be identical. Draconian discipline does not fit our customs.\r\nDiscipline must be a state of mind, a social institution based on the\r\nsalient virtues and defects of the nation.\r\n\r\nDiscipline cannot be secured or created in a day. It is an\r\ninstitution, a tradition. The commander must have confidence in his\r\nright to command. He must be accustomed to command and proud to\r\ncommand. This is what strengthens discipline in armies commanded by an\r\naristocracy in certain countries.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians do not neglect the homogeneity and consequent unity of\r\norganization. They recognize its value. Hessian regiments are\r\ncomposed, the first year, of one-third Hessians, two-thirds Prussians,\r\nto control the racial tendencies of troops of a recently annexed\r\ncountry; the second year, of two-thirds Hessians, one-third Prussians;\r\nthe third year, all Hessians with their own officers.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have shown us what happens in modern battle to large\r\narmies without cohesion. With them the lack of discipline and\r\norganization has had the inevitable result. Battle has been between\r\nhidden skirmishers, at long distance, and has lasted for days, until\r\nsome faulty movement, perhaps a moral exhaustion, has caused one or\r\nthe other of the opposing forces to give way.\r\n\r\nIn this American War, the melees of Agincourt are said to have\r\nreappeared, which merely means a melee of fugitives. But less than\r\never has there been close combat.\r\n\r\nTo fight from a distance is instinctive in man. From the first day he\r\nhas worked to this end, and he continues to do so. It was thought that\r\nwith long range weapons close combat might return. On the contrary\r\ntroops keep further off before its effects.\r\n\r\nThe primitive man, the Arab, is instability incarnate. A breath, a\r\nnothing, governs him at each instant in war. The civilized man, in\r\nwar, which is opposed to civilization, returns naturally to his first\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nWith the Arab war remains a matter of agility and cunning. Hunting is\r\nhis principal pastime and the pursuit of wild beasts teaches the\r\npursuit of man. General Daumas depicts Arabs as cavaliers. What more\r\nchivalrous warfare than the night surprise and sack of a camp! Empty\r\nwords!!\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that modern war is the most recondite of things,\r\nrequiring experts. War, so long as man risks his skin in it, will\r\nalways be a matter of instinct.\r\n\r\nAncient battle resembled drill. There is no such resemblance in modern\r\nbattle. This greatly disconcerts both officers and soldiers.\r\n\r\nAncient battles were picnics, for the victors, who lost nobody. Not so\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nArtillery played no part in ancient battle.\r\n\r\nThe invention of firearms has diminished losses in battle. The\r\nimprovement of firearms continues to diminish losses. This looks like\r\na paradox. But statistics prove it. Nor is it unreasonable.\r\n\r\nDoes war become deadlier with the improvement of weapons? Not at all.\r\nMan is capable of standing before a certain amount of terror; beyond\r\nthat he flees from battle. The battle of Pharsalus lasted some four\r\nhours. Caesar broke his camp, which is done in the morning; then the\r\nformation for battle; then the battle, etc. And he says that his\r\ntroops were tired, the battle having lasted up to noon. This indicates\r\nthat he considered it long.\r\n\r\nFor the middle ages, consult Froissart. The knights in the Battle of\r\nthe Thirty were armed for battle on foot which they preferred in a\r\nserious affair, that is to say in a restricted space. There was a\r\nhalt, a rest in the combat, when the two parties became exhausted. The\r\nBretons, at this rest, were twenty-five against thirty. The battle had\r\nlasted up to exhaustion without loss by the English! Without Montauban\r\nthe battle would have been terminated by complete and mutual\r\nexhaustion and without further losses. For the greater the fatigue,\r\nthe less strength remained for piercing the armor. Montauban was at\r\nthe same time felon and hero; felon because he did a thing not\r\npermitted by the code of combat; hero, because, if the Bretons had not\r\nably profited by the disorder, he would have been killed when he\r\nentered the English formation alone. At the end of the contest the\r\nBretons had four killed, the English eight. Four of the killed were\r\novercome by their armor.\r\n\r\nExplain how, under Turenne, men held much longer under fire than\r\nto-day. It is perfectly simple. Man is capable of standing before only\r\na certain amount of terror. To-day there must be swallowed in five\r\nminutes what took an hour under Turenne. An example will be given.\r\n\r\nWith the present arms, whose usage is generally known, the instruction\r\nof the soldier is of little importance. It does not make the soldier.\r\nTake as an example the case of the peasants of the Vendee. Their unity\r\nand not individual instruction made them soldiers, whose value could\r\nnot be denied. Such unity was natural in people of the same village of\r\nthe same commune, led in battle by their own lords, their own priests,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe greater the perfection of weapons, the more dreadful becomes\r\nmodern battle, and discipline becomes more difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe less mobile the troops, the deadlier are battles. Bayonet attacks\r\nare not so easily made to-day, and morale consequently is less\r\naffected, man fearing man more than death. Astonishing losses seem to\r\nhave been suffered without breaking by Turenne's armies. Were the\r\ncasualty reports submitted by the captains of those days correct?\r\n\r\nFrederick liked to say that three men behind the enemy were worth more\r\nthan fifty in front of him, for moral effect. The field of action\r\nto-day is more extensive than in Frederick's time. Battle is delivered\r\non more accidented terrain, as armies with great mobility do not need\r\nany particular terrain to fight on.\r\n\r\nThe nature of ancient arms required close order. Modern arms require\r\nopen order, and they are at the same time of such terrible power that\r\nagainst them too often discipline is broken. What is the solution?\r\nHave your combatants opened out? Have them well acquainted with each\r\nother so as to have unity. Have reserves to threaten with, held with\r\nan iron hand.\r\n\r\nModern weapons have a terrible effect and are almost unbearable by the\r\nnervous system. Who can say that he has not been frightened in battle?\r\nDiscipline in battle becomes the more necessary as the ranks become\r\nmore open, and the material cohesion of the ranks not giving\r\nconfidence, it must spring from a knowledge of comrades, and a trust\r\nin officers, who must always be present and seen. What man to-day\r\nadvances with the confidence that rigid discipline and pride in\r\nhimself gave the Roman soldier, even though the contest is no longer\r\nwith man but with fate?\r\n\r\nTo-day the artillery is effective at great distances. There is much\r\nliberty of movement for the different arms. The apparent liaison\r\nbetween arms is lessened. This has its influence on morale. There is\r\nanother advantage in reliable troops, in that they can be extended\r\nmore widely, and will consequently suffer smaller losses and be in\r\nbetter morale for close conflict.\r\n\r\nThe further off one is, the more difficult it is to judge of the\r\nterrain. Consequently the greater is the necessity for scouting, for\r\nreconnoitering the terrain by skirmishers. This is something that the\r\nDuke of Gramont forgot at Nordlingen, and which is often forgotten;\r\nbut it constitutes another important reason for the use of\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\nThe formation in rank is a disciplinary measure against the weakness\r\nof man in the face of danger. This weakness is greater to-day in that\r\nthe moral action of weapons is more powerful, and that the material\r\nrank has the inherent lack of cohesion of open order. However, open\r\norder is necessary to economize losses and permit the use of weapons.\r\nThus to-day there is greater necessity than ever for the rank, that is\r\nfor discipline, not for the geometrical rank. It is at the same time\r\nmore necessary and doubly difficult to attain.\r\n\r\nIn ancient battle unity existed, at least with the Greeks and the\r\nRomans. The soldier was known to his officer and comrades; they saw\r\nthat he fought.\r\n\r\nIn modern armies where losses are as great for the victor as for the\r\nvanquished, the soldier must more often be replaced. In ancient battle\r\nthe victor had no losses. To-day the soldier is often unknown to his\r\ncomrades. He is lost in the smoke, the dispersion, the confusion of\r\nbattle. He seems to fight alone. Unity is no longer insured by mutual\r\nsurveillance. A man falls, and disappears. Who knows whether it was a\r\nbullet or the fear of advancing further that struck him! The ancient\r\ncombatant was never struck by an invisible weapon and could not fall\r\nin this way. The more difficult surveillance, the more necessary\r\nbecomes the individuality of companies, sections, squads. Not the\r\nleast of their boasts should be their ability to stand a roll call at\r\nall times.\r\n\r\nThe ancients often avoided hand to hand conflict, so terrible were its\r\nconsequences. In modern combat, there never is hand to hand conflict\r\nif one stands fast.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day close combat tends to disappear. It is replaced by\r\nfire action; above all by the moral action of maneuvers. Dispersion\r\nbrings us back to the necessity for the unity which was an absolute\r\nnecessity in ancient battle.\r\n\r\nStrategy is a game. The first strategist, long before Napoleon, was\r\nHorace with his three enemies.\r\n\r\nThe size of the battle field permits, less than ever, holding units\r\ntogether; the role of the general is much more difficult: many more\r\nchances are left to fate. Thus the greater the necessity for the best\r\ntroops who know best their trade, who are most dependable and of\r\ngreatest fortitude. To diminish the effect of luck, it is necessary to\r\nhold longer, to wait for help from a distance. Battles resolve\r\nthemselves into battles of soldiers. The final decision is more\r\ndifficult to obtain. There is a strange similarity in battle at one\r\nleague to battle at two paces. The value of the soldier is the\r\nessential element of success. Let us strengthen the soldier by unity.\r\n\r\nBattle has more importance than ever. Communication facilities such as\r\nthe telegraph, concentration facilities such as the railroad, render\r\nmore difficult such strategic surprises as Ulm and Jena. The whole\r\nforces of a country can thus be united. So united, defeat becomes\r\nirreparable, disorganization greater and more rapid.\r\n\r\nIn modern combat the melee really exists more than in ancient battle.\r\nThis appears paradoxical. It is true nevertheless of the melee taken\r\nin the sense of a mixed up affair where it is infinitely difficult to\r\nsee clearly.\r\n\r\nMan, in the combat of our days, is a man who, hardly knowing how to\r\nswim, is suddenly thrown into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe good quality of troops will more than ever secure victory.\r\n\r\nAs to the comparative value of troops with cohesion and of new troops,\r\nlook at the Zouaves of the Guard or the Grenadiers at Magenta, and the\r\n55th at Solferino. [34]\r\n\r\nNothing should be neglected to make the battle order stronger, man\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Moral Elements in Battle\r\n\r\nWhen, in complete security, after dinner, in full physical and moral\r\ncontentment, men consider war and battle they are animated by a noble\r\nardor that has nothing in common with reality. How many of them,\r\nhowever, even at that moment, would be ready to risk their lives? But\r\noblige them to march for days and weeks to arrive at the battle\r\nground, and on the day of battle oblige them to wait minutes, hours,\r\nto deliver it. If they were honest they would testify how much the\r\nphysical fatigue and the mental anguish that precede action have\r\nlowered their morale, how much less eager to fight they are than a\r\nmonth before, when they arose from the table in a generous mood.\r\n\r\nMan's heart is as changeable as fortune. Man shrinks back, apprehends\r\ndanger in any effort in which he does not foresee success. There are\r\nsome isolated characters of an iron temper, who resist the tendency;\r\nbut they are carried away by the great majority (Bismarck).\r\n\r\nExamples show that if a withdrawal is forced, the army is discouraged\r\nand takes flight (Frederick). The brave heart does not change.\r\n\r\nReal bravery, inspired by devotion to duty, does not know panic and is\r\nalways the same. The bravery sprung from hot blood pleases the\r\nFrenchman more. He understands it, it appeals to his vanity; it is a\r\ncharacteristic of his nature. But it is passing; it fails him at\r\ntimes, especially when there is nothing for him to gain in doing his\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThe Turks are full of ardor in the advance. They carry their officers\r\nwith them. But they retreat with the same facility, abandoning their\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nMediocre troops like to be led by their shepherds. Reliable troops\r\nlike to be directed, with their directors alongside of them or behind.\r\nWith the former the general must be the leader on horseback; with the\r\nlatter, the manager.\r\n\r\nWarnery did not like officers to head a charge. He thought it useless\r\nto have them killed before the others. He did not place them in front\r\nand his cavalry was good.\r\n\r\nGeneral Leboeuf did not favor the proposed advance into battle with\r\nplatoon leaders in front of the center of their platoons. The fear\r\nexists that the fall of the captain will demoralize the rest. What is\r\nthe solution? Leboeuf must have known that if the officer is not in\r\nfront of his command, it will advance less confidently, that, with us,\r\nall officers are almost always in advance. Practice is stronger than\r\nany theory. Therefore fit theories to it. In column, put the chiefs of\r\nplatoon on the flank where they can see clearly.\r\n\r\nFrightfulness! Witness the Turks in the Polish wars. What gave power\r\nto the Turks in their wars with Poland was not so much their real\r\nstrength as their ferocity. They massacred all who resisted; they\r\nmassacred without the excuse of resistance. Terror preceded them,\r\nbreaking down the courage of their enemies. The necessity to win or to\r\nsubmit to extreme peril brought about cowardice and submission, for\r\nfear of being conquered.\r\n\r\nTurenne said, \"You tremble, body....\" The instinct of\r\nself-preservation can then make the strongest tremble. But they are\r\nstrong enough to overcome their emotion, the fear of advancing,\r\nwithout even losing their heads or their coolness. Fear with them\r\nnever becomes terror; it is forgotten in the activities of command. He\r\nwho does not feel strong enough to keep his heart from ever being\r\ngripped by terror, should never think of becoming an officer.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers themselves have emotion. The sense of duty, discipline,\r\npride, the example of their officers and above all their coolness,\r\nsustain them and prevent their fear from becoming terror. Their\r\nemotion never allows them to sight, or to more than approximately\r\nadjust their fire. Often they fire into the air. Cromwell knew this\r\nvery well, dependable as his troops were, when he said, \"Put your\r\ntrust in God and aim at their shoe laces.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is too true is that bravery often does not at all exclude\r\ncowardice, horrible devices to secure personal safety, infamous\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were not mighty men, but men of discipline and obstinacy.\r\nWe have no idea of the Roman military mind, so entirely different from\r\nours. A Roman general who had as little coolness as we have would have\r\nbeen lost. We have incentives in decorations and medals that would\r\nhave made a Roman soldier run the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nHow many men before a lion, have the courage to look him in the face,\r\nto think of and put into practice measures of self-defense? In war\r\nwhen terror has seized you, as experience has shown it often does, you\r\nare as before a lion. You fly trembling and let yourself be eaten up.\r\nAre there so few really brave men among so many soldiers? Alas, yes!\r\nGideon was lucky to find three hundred in thirty thousand.\r\n\r\nNapoleon said, \"Two Mamelukes held three Frenchmen; but one hundred\r\nFrench cavalry did not fear the same number of Mamelukes; three\r\nhundred vanquished the same number; one thousand French beat fifteen\r\nhundred Mamelukes. Such was the influence of tactics, order and\r\nmaneuver.\" In ordinary language, such was the great moral influence of\r\nunity, established by discipline and made possible and effective in\r\nbattle by organization and mutual support. With unity and sensible\r\nformation men of an individual value one-third less beat those who\r\nwere individually their betters. That is the essential, must be the\r\nessential, point in the organization of an army. On reflection, this\r\nsimple statement of Napoleon's seems to contain the whole of battle\r\nmorale. Make the enemy believe that support is lacking; isolate; cut\r\noff, flank, turn, in a thousand ways make his men believe themselves\r\nisolated. Isolate in like manner his squadrons, battalions, brigades\r\nand divisions; and victory is yours. If, on account of bad\r\norganization, he does not anticipate mutual support, there is no need\r\nof such maneuver; the attack is enough.\r\n\r\nSome men, such as Orientals, Chinese, Tartars, Mongols do not fear\r\ndeath. They are resigned to it at all times. Why is it that they can\r\nnot stand before the armies of the western people? It is lack of\r\norganization. The instinct of self-preservation which at the last\r\nmoment dominates them utterly, is not opposed by discipline. We have\r\noften seen fanatic eastern peoples, implicitly believing that death in\r\nbattle means a happy and glorious resurrection, superior in numbers,\r\ngive way before discipline. If attacked confidently, they are crushed\r\nby their own weight. In close combat the dagger is better than the\r\nbayonet, but instinct is too strong for such people.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the soldier capable of obedience and direction in action,\r\nis the sense of discipline. This includes: respect for and confidence\r\nin his chiefs; confidence in his comrades and fear of their reproaches\r\nand retaliation if he abandons them in danger; his desire to go where\r\nothers do without trembling more than they; in a word, the whole of\r\nesprit de corps. Organization only can produce these characteristics.\r\nFour men equal a lion.\r\n\r\nNote the army organizations and tactical formations on paper are\r\nalways determined from the mechanical point of view, neglecting the\r\nessential coefficient, that of morale. They are almost always wrong.\r\n\r\nEsprit de corps is secured in war. But war becomes shorter and shorter\r\nand more and more violent. Consequently, secure esprit de corps in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nMental acquaintanceship is not enough to make a good organization. A\r\ngood general esprit is needed. All must work for battle and not merely\r\nlive, quietly going through with drills without understanding their\r\napplication. Once a man knows how to use his weapon and obey all\r\ncommands there is needed only occasional drill to brush up those who\r\nhave forgotten. Marches and battle maneuvers are what is needed.\r\n\r\nThe technical training of the soldier is not the most difficult. It is\r\nnecessary for him to know how to use and take care of his weapon; to\r\nknow how to move to the right and to the left, forward, to the rear,\r\nat command, to charge and to march with full pack. But this does not\r\nmake the soldier. The Vendeans, who knew little of this, were tough\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to change the instruction, to reduce it to\r\nthe necessary minimum and to cut out all the superfluities with which\r\npeacetime laborers overload it each year. To know the essential well\r\nis better than having some knowledge of a lot of things, many of them\r\nuseless. Teach this the first year, that the second, but the essential\r\nfrom the beginning! Also instruction should be simple to avoid the\r\nmental fatigue of long drills that disgust everybody.\r\n\r\nHere is a significant sentence in Colonel Borbstaed's enumeration\r\nof the reasons for Prussian victory over the Austrians in 1866, \"It\r\nwas ... because each man, being trained, knew how to act promptly and\r\nconfidently in all phases of battle.\" This is a fact.\r\n\r\nTo be held in a building, at every minute of the day to have every\r\nmovement, every attitude under a not too intelligent surveillance is\r\nindeed to be harried. This incessant surveillance weakens the morale\r\nof both the watched and the watcher. What is the reason for this\r\nincessant surveillance which has long since exceeded shipboard\r\nsurveillance? Was not that strict enough?\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Material and Moral Effect\r\n\r\nThe effect of an army, of one organization on another, is at the same\r\ntime material and moral. The material effect of an organization is in\r\nits power to destroy, the moral effect in the fear that it inspires.\r\n\r\nIn battle, two moral forces, even more than two material forces, are\r\nin conflict. The stronger conquers. The victor has often lost by fire\r\nmore than the vanquished. Moral effect does not come entirely from\r\ndestructive power, real and effective as it may be. It comes, above\r\nall, from its presumed, threatening power, present in the form of\r\nreserves threatening to renew the battle, of troops that appear on the\r\nflank, even of a determined frontal attack.\r\n\r\nMaterial effect is greater as instruments are better (weapons, mounts,\r\netc.), as the men know better how to use them, and as the men are more\r\nnumerous and stronger, so that in case of success they can carry on\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nWith equal or even inferior power of destruction he will win who has\r\nthe resolution to advance, who by his formations and maneuvers can\r\ncontinually threaten his adversary with a new phase of material\r\naction, who, in a word has the moral ascendancy. Moral effect inspires\r\nfear. Fear must be changed to terror in order to vanquish.\r\n\r\nWhen confidence is placed in superiority of material means, valuable\r\nas they are against an enemy at a distance, it may be betrayed by the\r\nactions of the enemy. If he closes with you in spite of your\r\nsuperiority in means of destruction, the morale of the enemy mounts\r\nwith the loss of your confidence. His morale dominates yours. You\r\nflee. Entrenched troops give way in this manner.\r\n\r\nAt Pharsalus, Pompey and his army counted on a cavalry corps turning\r\nand taking Caesar in the rear. In addition Pompey's army was twice as\r\nnumerous. Caesar parried the blow, and his enemy, who saw the failure\r\nof the means of action he counted on, was demoralized, beaten, lost\r\nfifteen thousand men put to the sword (while Caesar lost only two\r\nhundred) and as many prisoners.\r\n\r\nEven by advancing you affect the morale of the enemy. But your object\r\nis to dominate him and make him retreat before your ascendancy, and it\r\nis certain that everything that diminishes the enemy's morale adds to\r\nyour resolution in advancing. Adopt then a formation which permits\r\nyour destructive agency, your skirmishers, to help you throughout by\r\ntheir material action and to this degree diminish that of the enemy.\r\n\r\nArmor, in diminishing the material effect that can be suffered,\r\ndiminishes the dominating moral effect of fear. It is easy to\r\nunderstand how much armor adds to the moral effect of cavalry action,\r\nat the critical moment. You feel that thanks to his armor the enemy\r\nwill succeed in getting to you.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that when a body actually awaits the attack of\r\nanother up to bayonet distance (something extraordinarily rare), and\r\nthe attacking troop does not falter, the first does not defend itself.\r\nThis is the massacre of ancient battle.\r\n\r\nAgainst unimaginative men, who retain some coolness and consequently\r\nthe faculty of reasoning in danger, moral effect will be as material\r\neffect. The mere act of attack does not completely succeed against\r\nsuch troops. (Witness battles in Spain and Waterloo). It is necessary\r\nto destroy them, and we are better at this than they by our aptitude\r\nin the use of skirmishers and above all in the mad dash of our\r\ncavalry. But the cavalry must not be treated, until it comes to so\r\nconsider itself, as a precious jewel which must be guarded against\r\ninjury. There should be little of it, but it must be good.\r\n\r\n\"Seek and ye shall find\" not the ideal but the best method that\r\nexists. In maneuvers skirmishers, who have some effect, are returned\r\nto ranks to execute fire in two ranks which never killed anybody. Why\r\nnot put your skirmishers in advance? Why sound trumpet calls which\r\nthey neither hear nor understand? That they do not is fortunate, for\r\neach captain has a different call sounded. Example: at Alma, the\r\nretreat, etc. [35]\r\n\r\nThe great superiority of Roman tactics lay in their constant endeavor\r\nto cooerdinate physical and moral effect. Moral effect passes; finally\r\none sees that the enemy is not so terrible as he appeared to be.\r\nPhysical effect does not. The Greeks tried to dominate. The Romans\r\npreferred to kill, and kill they did. They followed thereby the better\r\nmethod. Their moral effect was aided by their reliable and deadly\r\nswords.\r\n\r\nWhat moral force is worth to a nation at war is shown by examples.\r\nPichegru played the traitor; this had great influence at home and we\r\nwere beaten. Napoleon came back; victory returned with him.\r\n\r\nBut at that we can do nothing without good troops, not even with a\r\nNapoleon. Witness Turenne's army after his death. It remained\r\nexcellent in spite of conflict between and the inefficiency of its two\r\nleaders. Note the defensive retreat across the Rhine; the regiment in\r\nChampagne attacked in front by infantry and taken in the rear by\r\ncavalry. One of the prettiest feats of the art of war.\r\n\r\nIn modern battle, which is delivered with combatants so far apart, man\r\nhas come to have a horror of man. He comes to hand to hand fighting\r\nonly to defend his body or if forced to it by some fortuitous\r\nencounter. More than that! It may be said that he seeks to catch the\r\nfugitive only for fear that he will turn and fight.\r\n\r\nGuilbert says that shock actions are infinitely rare. Here, infinity\r\nis taken in its exact mathematical sense. Guilbert reduces to nothing,\r\nby deductions from practical examples, the mathematical theory of the\r\nshock of one massed body on another. Indeed the physical impulse is\r\nnothing. The moral impulse which estimates the attacker is everything.\r\nThe moral impulse lies in the perception by the enemy of the\r\nresolution that animates you. They say that the battle of Amstetten\r\nwas the only one in which a line actually waited for the shock of\r\nanother line charging with the bayonets. Even then the Russians gave\r\nway before the moral and not before the physical impulse. They were\r\nalready disconcerted, wavering, worried, hesitant, vacillating, when\r\nthe blow fell. They waited long enough to receive bayonet thrusts,\r\neven blows with the rifle (in the back, as at Inkermann). [36]\r\n\r\nThis done, they fled. He who calm and strong of heart awaits his\r\nenemy, has all the advantage of fire. But the moral impulse of the\r\nassailant demoralizes the assailed. He is frightened; he sets his\r\nsight no longer; he does not even aim his piece. His lines are broken\r\nwithout defense, unless indeed his cavalry, waiting halted, horsemen a\r\nmeter apart and in two ranks, does not break first and destroy all\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nWith good troops on both sides, if an attack is not prepared, there is\r\nevery reason to believe that it will fail. The attacking troops suffer\r\nmore, materially, than the defenders. The latter are in better order,\r\nfresh, while the assailants are in disorder and already have suffered\r\na loss of morale under a certain amount of punishment. The moral\r\nsuperiority given by the offensive movement may be more than\r\ncompensated by the good order and integrity of the defenders, when the\r\nassailants have suffered losses. The slightest reaction by the defense\r\nmay demoralize the attack. This is the secret of the success of the\r\nBritish infantry in Spain, and not their fire by rank, which was as\r\nineffective with them as with us.\r\n\r\nThe more confidence one has in his methods of attack or defense, the\r\nmore disconcerted he is to see them at some time incapable of stopping\r\nthe enemy. The effect of the present improved fire arm is still\r\nlimited, with the present organization and use of riflemen, to point\r\nblank ranges. It follows that bayonet charges (where bayonet thrusts\r\nnever occur), otherwise attacks under fire, will have an increasing\r\nvalue, and that victory will be his who secures most order and\r\ndetermined dash. With these two qualities, too much neglected with us,\r\nwith willingness, with intelligence enough to keep a firm hold on\r\ntroops in immediate support, we may hope to take and to hold what we\r\ntake. Do not then neglect destructive effort before using moral\r\neffect. Use skirmishers up to the last moment. Otherwise no attack can\r\nsucceed. It is true it is haphazard fire, nevertheless it is effective\r\nbecause of its volume.\r\n\r\nThis moral effect must be a terrible thing. A body advances to meet\r\nanother. The defender has only to remain calm, ready to aim, each man\r\npitted against a man before him. The attacking body comes within\r\ndeadly range. Whether or not it halts to fire, it will be a target for\r\nthe other body which awaits it, calm, ready, sure of its effect. The\r\nwhole first rank of the assailant falls, smashed. The remainder,\r\nlittle encouraged by their reception, disperse automatically or before\r\nthe least indication of an advance on them. Is this what happens? Not\r\nat all! The moral effect of the assault worries the defenders. They\r\nfire in the air if at all. They disperse immediately before the\r\nassailants who are even encouraged by this fire now that it is over.\r\nIt quickens them in order to avoid a second salvo.\r\n\r\nIt is said by those who fought them in Spain and at Waterloo that the\r\nBritish are capable of the necessary coolness. I doubt it\r\nnevertheless. After firing, they made swift attacks. If they had not,\r\nthey might have fled. Anyhow the English are stolid folks, with little\r\nimagination, who try to be logical in all things. The French with\r\ntheir nervous irritability, their lively imagination, are incapable of\r\nsuch a defense.\r\n\r\nAnybody who thinks that he could stand under a second fire is a man\r\nwithout any idea of battle. (Prince de Ligne).\r\n\r\nModern history furnishes us with no examples of stonewall troops who\r\ncan neither be shaken nor driven back, who stand patiently the\r\nheaviest fire, yet who retire precipitately when the general orders\r\nthe retreat. (Bismarck).\r\n\r\nCavalry maneuvers, like those of infantry, are threats. The most\r\nthreatening win. The formation in ranks is a threat, and more than a\r\nthreat. A force engaged is out of the hand of its commander. I know, I\r\nsee what it does, what it is capable of. It acts; I can estimate the\r\neffect of its action. But a force in formation is in hand; I know it\r\nis there, I see it, feel it. It may be used in any direction. I feel\r\ninstinctively that it alone can surely reach me, take me on the right,\r\non the left, throw itself into a gap, turn me. It troubles me,\r\nthreatens me. Where is the threatened blow going to fall?\r\n\r\nThe formation in ranks is a serious threat, which may at any moment be\r\nput into effect. It awes one in a terrible fashion. In the heat of\r\nbattle, formed troops do more to secure victory than do those actively\r\nengaged. This is true, whether such a body actually exists or whether\r\nit exists only in the imagination of the enemy. In an indecisive\r\nbattle, he wins who can show, and merely show, battalions and\r\nsquadrons in hand. They inspire the fear of the unknown.\r\n\r\nFrom the taking of the entrenchments at Fribourg up to the engagement\r\nat the bridge of Arcola, up to Solferino, there occur a multitude of\r\ndeeds of valor, of positions taken by frontal attack, which deceive\r\nevery one, generals as well as civilians, and which always cause the\r\nsame mistakes to be made. It is time to teach these folks that the\r\nentrenchments at Fribourg were not won by frontal attack, nor was the\r\nbridge of Arcola (see the correspondence of Napoleon I), nor was\r\nSolferino.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Hercule took fifty cavalry through Alpon, ten kilometers on\r\nthe flank of the Austrians at Arcola, and the position that held us up\r\nfor three days, was evacuated. The evacuation was the result of\r\nstrategic, if not of tactical, moral effect. General or soldier, man\r\nis the same.\r\n\r\nDemonstrations should be made at greater or less distance, according\r\nto the morale of the enemy. That is to say, battle methods vary with\r\nthe enemy, and an appropriate method should be employed in each\r\nindividual case.\r\n\r\nWe have treated and shall treat only of the infantryman. In ancient as\r\nin modern battle, he is the one who suffers most. In ancient battle,\r\nif he is defeated, he remains because of his slowness at the mercy of\r\nthe victor. In modern battle the mounted man moves swiftly through\r\ndanger, the infantryman has to walk. He even has to halt in danger,\r\noften and for long periods of time. He who knows the morale of the\r\ninfantryman, which is put to the hardest proof, knows the morale of\r\nall the combatants.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Theory of Strong Battalions\r\n\r\nTo-day, numbers are considered the essential. Napoleon had this\r\ntendency (note his strength reports). The Romans did not pay so much\r\nattention to it. What they paid most attention to was to seeing that\r\neverybody fought. We assume that all the personnel present with an\r\narmy, with a division, with a regiment on the day of battle, fights.\r\nRight there is the error.\r\n\r\nThe theory of strong battalions is a shameful theory. It does not\r\nreckon on courage but on the amount of human flesh. It is a reflection\r\non the soul. Great and small orators, all who speak of military\r\nmatters to-day, talk only of masses. War is waged by enormous masses,\r\netc. In the masses, man as an individual disappears, the number only\r\nis seen. Quality is forgotten, and yet to-day as always, quality alone\r\nproduces real effect. The Prussians conquered at Sadowa with made\r\nsoldiers, united, accustomed to discipline. Such soldiers can be made\r\nin three or four years now, for the material training of the soldier\r\nis not indeed so difficult.\r\n\r\nCaesar had legions that he found unseasoned, not yet dependable, which\r\nhad been formed for nine years.\r\n\r\nAustria was beaten because her troops were of poor quality, because\r\nthey were conscripts.\r\n\r\nOur projected organization will give us four hundred thousand good\r\nsoldiers. But all our reserves will be without cohesion, if they are\r\nthrown into this or that organization on the eve of battle. At a\r\ndistance, numbers of troops without cohesion may be impressive, but\r\nclose up they are reduced to fifty or twenty-five per cent. who really\r\nfight. Wagram was not too well executed. It illustrated desperate\r\nefforts that had for once a moral effect on an impressionable enemy.\r\nBut for once only. Would they succeed again?\r\n\r\nThe Cimbrians gave an example [37] and man has not changed. Who to-day is\r\nbraver than they were? And they did not have to face artillery, nor\r\nrifles.\r\n\r\nOriginally Napoleon found as an instrument, an army with good battle\r\nmethods, and in his best battles, combat followed these methods. He\r\nhimself prescribed, at least so they say, for he misrepresented at\r\nSaint Helena, the methods used at Wagram, at Eylau, at Waterloo, and\r\nengaged enormous masses of infantry which did not give material\r\neffect. But it involved a frightful loss of men and a disorder that,\r\nafter they had once been unleashed, did not permit of the rallying and\r\nreemployment that day of the troops engaged. This was a barbaric\r\nmethod, according to the Romans, amateurish, if we may say such a\r\nthing of such a man; a method which could not be used against\r\nexperienced and well trained troops such as d'Erlon's corps at\r\nWaterloo. It proved disastrous.\r\n\r\nNapoleon looked only at the result to be attained. When his\r\nimpatience, or perhaps the lack of experience and knowledge in his\r\nofficers and soldiers, forbade his continued use of real attack\r\ntactics, he completely sacrificed the material effect of infantry and\r\neven that of cavalry to the moral effect of masses. The personnel of\r\nhis armies was too changing. In ancient battle victory cost much less\r\nthan with modern armies, and the same soldiers remained longer in\r\nranks. At the end of his campaigns, when he had soldiers sixty years\r\nold, Alexander had lost only seven hundred men by the sword.\r\nNapoleon's system is more practicable with the Russians, who naturally\r\ngroup together, mass up, but it is not the most effective. Note the\r\nmass formation at Inkermann. [38]\r\n\r\nWhat did Napoleon I do? He reduced the role of man in battle, and\r\ndepended instead on formed masses. We have not such magnificent\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nInfantry and cavalry masses showed, toward the end of the Empire, a\r\ntactical degeneracy resulting from the wearing down of their elements\r\nand the consequent lowering of standards of morale and training. But\r\nsince the allies had recognized and adopted our methods, Napoleon\r\nreally had a reason for trying something so old that it was new to\r\nsecure that surprise which will give victory once. It can give victory\r\nonly once however, tried again surprise will be lacking. This was sort\r\nof a desperate method which Napoleon's supremacy allowed him to adopt\r\nwhen he saw his prestige waning.\r\n\r\nWhen misfortune and lack of cannon fodder oppressed him, Napoleon\r\nbecame again the practical man not blinded by his supremacy. His\r\nentire good sense, his genius, overcame the madness to conquer at all\r\nprice, and we have his campaign of 1814.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ambert says: \"Without military traditions, almost without a\r\ncommand, these confused masses (the American armies of the Civil War)\r\nstruck as men struck at Agincourt and Crecy.\" At Agincourt and Crecy,\r\nwe struck very little, but were struck a lot. These battles were great\r\nslaughters of Frenchmen, by English and other Frenchmen, who did not\r\ngreatly suffer themselves. In what, except in disorder, did the\r\nAmerican battles resemble these butcheries with the knife? The\r\nAmericans were engaged as skirmishers at a distance of leagues. In\r\nseeking a resemblance the general has been carried away by the mania\r\nfor phrase-making.\r\n\r\nVictory is always for the strong battalions. This is true. If sixty\r\ndetermined men can rout a battalion, these sixty must be found.\r\nPerhaps only as many will be found as the enemy has battalions (Note\r\nGideon's proportion of three hundred to thirty thousand of one to one\r\nhundred.) Perhaps it would be far and away better, under these\r\ncircumstances, to fight at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Combat Methods\r\n\r\nAncient battle was fought in a confined space. The commander could see\r\nhis whole force. Seeing clearly, his account should have been clear,\r\nalthough we note that many of these ancient accounts are obscure and\r\nincomplete, and that we have to supplement them. In modern battle\r\nnobody knows what goes on or what has gone on, except from results.\r\nNarrations cannot enter into details of execution.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare tales of feats of arms, narrated by the\r\nvictor (so-called) or the vanquished. It is hard to tell which account\r\nis truthful, if either. Mere assurance may carry weight. Military\r\npolitics may dictate a perversion of the facts for disciplinary, moral\r\nor political reasons. (Note Sommo-Sierra.)\r\n\r\nIt is difficult even to determine losses, the leaders are such\r\nconsummate liars. Why is this?\r\n\r\nIt is bewildering to read a French account and then a foreign account\r\nof the same event, the facts stated are so entirely different. What is\r\nthe truth? Only results can reveal it, such results as the losses on\r\nboth sides. They are really instructive if they can be gotten at.\r\n\r\nI believe that under Turenne there was not existent to the same degree\r\na national pride which tended to hide unpleasant truths. The troops in\r\ncontending armies were often of the same nation.\r\n\r\nIf national vanity and pride were not so touchy about recent\r\noccurrences, still passionately debated, numerous lessons might be\r\ndrawn from our last wars. Who can speak impartially of Waterloo, or\r\nWaterloo so much discussed and with such heat, without being ashamed?\r\nHad Waterloo been won, it would not have profited us. Napoleon\r\nattempted the impossible, which is beyond even genius. After a\r\nterrible fight against English firmness and tenacity, a fight in which\r\nwe were not able to subdue them, the Prussians appear. We would have\r\ndone no better had they not appeared, but they did, very conveniently\r\nto sustain our pride. They were confronted. Then the rout began. It\r\ndid not begin in the troops facing the Prussians but in those facing\r\nthe English, who were exhausted perhaps, but not more so than their\r\nenemies. This was the moral effect of an attack on their right, when\r\nthey had rather expected reinforcements to appear. The right conformed\r\nto the retrograde movement. And what a movement it was!\r\n\r\nWhy do not authorities acknowledge facts and try to formulate combat\r\nmethods that conform to reality? It would reduce a little the disorder\r\nthat bothers men not warned of it. They jump perhaps from the frying\r\npan into the fire. I have known two colonels, one of them a very brave\r\nman, who said, \"Let soldiers alone before the enemy. They know what to\r\ndo better than you do.\" This is a fine statement of French confidence!\r\nThat they know better than you what should be done. Especially in a\r\npanic, I suppose!\r\n\r\nA long time ago the Prince de Ligne justified battle formations, above\r\nall the famous oblique formation. Napoleon decided the question. All\r\ndiscussion of formations is pedantry. But there are moral reasons for\r\nthe power of the depth formation.\r\n\r\nThe difference between practice and theory is incredible. A general,\r\nwho has given directions a thousand times on the battle field, when\r\nasked for directions, gives this order, \"Go there, Colonel.\" The\r\ncolonel, a man of good sense, says, \"Will you explain, sir? What point\r\ndo you want me to guide on? How far should I extend? Is there anybody\r\non my right? On my left?\" The general says, \"Advance on the enemy,\r\nsir. It seems to me that that ought to be enough. What does this\r\nhesitation mean?\" But my dear general, what are your orders? An\r\nofficer should know where his command is, and the command itself\r\nshould know. Space is large. If you do not know where to send your\r\ntroops, and how to direct them, to make them understand where they are\r\nto go, to give them guides if necessary, what sort of general are you?\r\n\r\nWhat is our method for occupying a fortified work, or a line? We have\r\nnone! Why not adopt that of Marshal Saxe? Ask several generals how\r\nthey would do it. They will not know.\r\n\r\nThere is always mad impatience for results, without considering the\r\nmeans. A general's ability lies in judging the best moment for attack\r\nand in knowing how to prepare for it. We took Melegnano without\r\nartillery, without maneuver, but at what a price! At Waterloo the\r\nHougoumont farm held us up all day, cost us dear and disorganized us\r\ninto a mad mob, until Napoleon finally sent eight mortars to smash and\r\nburn the chateau. This is what should have been done at the\r\ncommencement of the general attack.\r\n\r\nA rational and ordered method of combat, or if not ordered, known to\r\nall, is enough to make good troops, if there is discipline be it\r\nunderstood. The Portuguese infantry in the Spanish War, to whom the\r\nEnglish had taught their method of combat, almost rivalled the English\r\ninfantry. To-day who has formulated method? Who has a traditional\r\nmethod? Ask the generals. No two will agree.\r\n\r\nWe have a method, a manner rather, that accords with the national\r\ntendency, that of skirmishers in large numbers. But this formation is\r\nnowhere formulated. Before a campaign it is decried. Properly so, for\r\nit degenerates rapidly into a flock of lost sheep. Consequently troops\r\ncome to the battle field entirely unused to reality. All the leaders,\r\nall the officers, are confused and unoriented. This goes so far that\r\noften generals are found who have lost their divisions or brigades;\r\nstaff officers who have lost their generals and their divisions both;\r\nand, although this is more easily understood, many company officers\r\nwho have lost their commands. This is a serious matter, which might\r\ncost us dear in a prolonged war in which the enemy gains experience.\r\nLet us hope that experience will lead us, not to change the principle,\r\nbut to modify and form in a practical way our characteristic battle\r\nmethod of escaping by advancing. The brochure of the Prince of Prussia\r\nshows that, without having fought us, the Prussians understand our\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nThere are men such as Marshal Bugeaud who are born warriors in\r\ncharacter, mental attitude, intelligence and temperament. They\r\nrecommend and show by example, such as Colonel Bugeaud's battles in\r\n1815 at the Hospital bridge, tactics entirely appropriate to their\r\nnational and personal characters. Note Wellington and the Duke of York\r\namong the English. But the execution of tactics such as Bugeaud's\r\nrequires officers who resemble their commanders, at least in courage\r\nand decisions. All officers are not of such temper. There is need then\r\nof prescribed tactics conforming to the national character, which may\r\nserve to guide an ordinary officer without requiring him to have the\r\nexceptional ability of a Bugeaud. Such prescribed tactics would serve\r\nan officer as the perfectly clear and well defined tactics of the\r\nRoman legion served the legion commander. The officer could not\r\nneglect them without failing in his duty. Of course they will not make\r\nhim an exceptional leader. But, except in case of utter incapacity\r\nthey will keep him from entirely failing in his task, from making\r\nabsurd mistakes. Nor will they prevent officers of Bugeaud's temper\r\nfrom using their ability. They will on the contrary help them by\r\nputting under their command men prepared for the details of battle,\r\nwhich will not then come to them as a surprise.\r\n\r\nThis method need not be as completely dogmatic as the Roman. Our\r\nbattle is too varying an affair. But some clearly defined rules,\r\nestablished by experience, would prevent the gross errors of\r\ninefficients. (Such as causing skirmishers to fall back when the\r\nformed rank fires, and consequently allowing them to carry with them\r\nin their retreat, the rank itself.) They would be useful aids to men\r\nof coolness and decision.\r\n\r\nThe laying down of such tactics would answer the many who hold that\r\neverything is improvised on the battle field and who find no better\r\nimprovisation than to leave the soldier to himself. (See above.)\r\n\r\nWe should try to exercise some control over our soldiers, who advance\r\nby flight (note the Vendeans) or escape by advancing, as you like. But\r\nif something unexpected surprises them, they flee as precipitately.\r\n\r\nInvention is less needed than verification, demonstration and\r\norganization of proper methods. To verify; observe better. To\r\ndemonstrate; try out and describe better. To organize, distribute\r\nbetter, bearing in mind that cohesion means discipline. I do not know\r\nwho put things that way; but it is truer than ever in this day of\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nWith us very few reason or understand reason, very few are cool. Their\r\neffect is negligible in the disorder of the mass; it is lost in\r\nnumbers. It follows that we above all need a method of combat, sanely\r\nthought out in advance. It must be based on the fact that we are not\r\npassively obedient instruments, but very nervous and restless people,\r\nwho wish to finish things quickly and to know in advance where we are\r\ngoing. It must be based on the fact that we are very proud people, but\r\npeople who would all skulk if we were not seen, and who consequently\r\nmust always be seen, and act in the presence of our comrades and of\r\nthe officers who supervise us. From this comes the necessity for\r\norganizing the infantry company solidly. It is the infantryman on whom\r\nthe battle has the most violent effect, for he is always most exposed;\r\nit is he therefore who must be the most solidly supported. Unity must\r\nbe secured by a mutual acquaintanceship of long standing between all\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nIf you only use combat methods that require leaders without fear, of\r\nhigh intelligence, full of good sense, of esprit, you will always make\r\nmistakes. Bugeaud's method was the best for him. But it is evident, in\r\nhis fight at the Hospital bridge that his battalion commanders were\r\nuseless. If he had not been there, all would have been lost. He alone,\r\nomnipresent, was capable of resolute blows that the others could not\r\nexecute. His system can be summed up in two phrases; always attack\r\neven when on the defensive; fire and take cover only when not\r\nattacked. His method was rational, considering his mentality and the\r\nexisting conditions, but in carrying it into execution he judged his\r\nofficers and soldiers by himself and was deceived. No dogmatic\r\nprinciples can be drawn from his method, nor from any other. Man is\r\nalways man. He does not always possess ability and resolution. The\r\ncommander must make his choice of methods, depending on his troops and\r\non himself.\r\n\r\nThe essential of tactics is: the science of making men fight with\r\ntheir maximum energy. This alone can give an organization with which\r\nto fight fear. This has always been true.\r\n\r\nWe must start here and figure mathematically. Mathematics is the\r\ndominant science in war, just as battle is its only purpose. Pride\r\ngenerally causes refusal to acknowledge the truth that fear of being\r\nvanquished is basic in war. In the mass, pride, vanity, is responsible\r\nfor this dissimulation. With the tiny number of absolutely fearless\r\nmen, what is responsible is their ignorance of a thing they do not\r\nfeel. There is however, no real basis but this, and all real tactics\r\nare based on it. Discipline is a part of tactics, is absolutely at the\r\nbase of tactics, as the Romans showed. They excelled the Gauls in\r\nintelligence, but not in bravery.\r\n\r\nTo start with: take battalions of four companies, four platoons each,\r\nin line or in column. The order of battle may be: two platoons\r\ndeployed as skirmishers, two companies in reserve, under command of\r\nthe battalion commander. In obtaining a decision destructive action\r\nwill come from skirmishers. This action should be directed by\r\nbattalion commanders, but such direction is not customary. No effect\r\nwill be secured from skirmishers at six hundred paces. They will\r\nnever, never, never, be nicely aligned in front of their battalions,\r\ncalm and collected, after an advance. They will not, even at\r\nmaneuvers. The battalion commander ought to be advanced enough to\r\ndirect his skirmishers. The whole battalion, one-half engaged,\r\none-half ready for any effort, ought to remain under his command,\r\nunder his personal direction as far as possible. In the advance the\r\nofficers, the soldiers, are content if they are merely directed; but,\r\nwhen the battle becomes hot, they must see their commander, know him\r\nto be near. It does not matter even if he is without initiative,\r\nincapable of giving an order. His presence creates a belief that\r\ndirection exists, that orders exist, and that is enough.\r\n\r\nWhen the skirmishers meet with resistance, they fall back to the\r\nranks. It is the role of reserves to support and reinforce the line,\r\nand above all, by a swift charge to cut the enemy's line. This then\r\nfalls back and the skirmishers go forward again, if the advance is\r\nresumed. The second line should be in the formation, battalions in\r\nline or in column, that hides it best. Cover the infantry troops\r\nbefore their entry into action; cover them as much as possible and\r\nby any means; take advantage of the terrain; make them lie down. This\r\nis the English method in defense of heights, instanced in Spain and at\r\nWaterloo. Only one bugle to each battalion should sound calls. What\r\nelse is there to be provided for?\r\n\r\nMany haughty generals would scream protests like eagles if it were\r\nsuggested that they take such precautions for second line battalions\r\nor first line troops not committed to action. Yet this is merely a\r\nsane measure to insure good order without the slightest implication of\r\ncowardice. [39]\r\n\r\nWith breech-loading weapons, the skirmishers on the defensive fire\r\nalmost always from a prone position. They are made to rise with\r\ndifficulty, either for retreat or for advance. This renders the\r\ndefense more tenacious....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nINFANTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Masses--Deep Columns.\r\n\r\nStudy of the effect of columns brings us to the consideration of mass\r\noperations in general. Read this singular argument in favor of attacks\r\nby battalions in close columns: \"A column cannot stop instantly\r\nwithout a command. Suppose your first rank stops at the instant of\r\nshock: the twelve ranks of the battalion, coming up successively,\r\nwould come in contact with it, pushing it forward.... Experiments made\r\nhave shown that beyond the sixteenth the impulsion of the ranks in\r\nrear has no effect on the front, it is completely taken up by the\r\nfifteen ranks already massed behind the first.... To make the\r\nexperiment, march at charging pace and command halt to the front rank\r\nwithout warning the rest. The ranks will precipitate themselves upon\r\neach other unless they be very attentive, or unless, anticipating the\r\ncommand, they check themselves unconsciously while marching.\"\r\n\r\nBut in a real charge, all your ranks are attentive, restless, anxious\r\nabout what is taking place at the front and, if the latter halts, if\r\nthe first line stops, there will be a movement to the rear and not to\r\nthe front. Take a good battalion, possessed of extraordinary calmness\r\nand coolness, thrown full speed on the enemy, at one hundred and\r\ntwenty steps to the minute. To-day it would have to advance under a\r\nfire of five shots a minute! At this last desperate moment if the\r\nfront rank stops, it will not be pushed, according to the theory of\r\nsuccessive impulses, it will be upset. The second line will arrive\r\nonly to fall over the first and so on. There should be a drill ground\r\ntest to see up to what rank this falling of the pasteboard figures\r\nwould extend.\r\n\r\nPhysical impulse is merely a word. If the front rank stops it will let\r\nitself fall and be trampled under foot rather than cede to the\r\npressure that pushes it forward. Any one experienced in infantry\r\nengagements of to-day knows that is just what happens. This shows the\r\nerror of the theory of physical impulse--a theory that continues to\r\ndictate as under the Empire (so strong is routine and prejudice)\r\nattacks in close column. Such attacks are marked by absolute disorder\r\nand lack of leadership. Take a battalion fresh from barracks, in light\r\nmarching order; intent only on the maneuver to be executed. It marches\r\nin close column in good order; its subdivisions are full four paces\r\napart. The non-commissioned officers control the men. But it is true\r\nthat if the terrain is slightly accidented, if the guide does not\r\nmarch with mathematical precision, the battalion in close column\r\nbecomes in the twinkling of an eye a flock of sheep. What would happen\r\nto a battalion in such a formation, at one hundred paces from the\r\nenemy? Nobody will ever see such an instance in these days of the\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nIf the battalion has marched resolutely, if it is in good order, it is\r\nten to one that the enemy has already withdrawn without waiting any\r\nlonger. But suppose the enemy does not flinch? Then the man of our\r\ndays, naked against iron and lead, no longer controls himself. The\r\ninstinct of preservation controls him absolutely. There are two ways\r\nof avoiding or diminishing the danger; they are to flee or to throw\r\none-self upon it. Let us rush upon it. Now, however small the\r\nintervals of space and time that separate us from the enemy, instinct\r\nshows itself. We rush forward, but ... generally, we rush with\r\nprudence, with a tendency to let the most urgent ones, the most\r\nintrepid ones, pass on. It is strange, but true, that the nearer we\r\napproach the enemy, the less we are closed up. Adieu to the theory of\r\npressure. If the front rank is stopped, those behind fall down rather\r\nthan push it. Even if this front rank is pushed, it will itself fall\r\ndown rather than advance. There is nothing to wonder at, it is sheer\r\nfact. Any pushing is to the rear. (Battle of Diernstein.)\r\n\r\nTo-day more than ever flight begins in the rear, which is affected\r\nquite as much as the front.\r\n\r\nMass attacks are incomprehensible. Not one out of ten was ever carried\r\nto completion and none of them could be maintained against\r\ncounter-attacks. They can be explained only by the lack of confidence\r\nof the generals in their troops. Napoleon expressly condemns in his\r\nmemoirs such attacks. He, therefore, never ordered them. But when good\r\ntroops were used up, and his generals believed they could not obtain\r\nfrom young troops determined attacks in tactical formation, they came\r\nback to the mass formation, which belongs to the infancy of the art,\r\nas a desperate resort.\r\n\r\nIf you use this method of pressing, of pushing, your force will\r\ndisappear as before a magician's wand.\r\n\r\nBut the enemy does not stand; the moral pressure of danger that\r\nprecedes you is too strong for him. Otherwise, those who stood and\r\naimed even with empty rifles, would never see a charge come up to\r\nthem. The first line of the assailant would be sensible of death and\r\nno one would wish to be in the first rank. Therefore, the enemy never\r\nmerely stands; because if he does, it is you that flee. This always\r\ndoes away with the shock. The enemy entertains no smaller anxiety than\r\nyours. When he sees you near, for him also the question is whether to\r\nflee or to advance. Two moral impulses are in conflict.\r\n\r\nThis is the instinctive reasoning of the officer and soldier, \"If\r\nthese men wait for me to close with them, it means death. I will kill,\r\nbut I will undoubtedly be killed. At the muzzle of the gun-barrel the\r\nbullet can not fail to find its mark. But if I can frighten them, they\r\nwill run away. I can shoot them and bayonet in the back. Let us make a\r\ntry at it.\" The trial is made, and one of the two forces, at some\r\nstage of the advance, perhaps only at two paces, makes an about and\r\ngets the bayonet in the back.\r\n\r\nImagination always sees loaded arms and this fancy is catching.\r\n\r\nThe shock is a mere term. The de Saxe, the Bugeaud theory: \"Close with\r\nthe bayonet and with fire action at close quarters. That is what kills\r\npeople and the victor is the one who kills most,\" is not founded on\r\nfact. No enemy awaits you if you are determined, and never, never,\r\nnever, are two equal determinations opposed to each other. It is well\r\nknown to everybody, to all nations, that the French have never met any\r\none who resisted a bayonet charge.\r\n\r\nThe English in Spain, marching resolutely in face of the charges of\r\nthe French in column, have always defeated them.... The English were\r\nnot dismayed at the mass. If Napoleon had recalled the defeat of the\r\ngiants of the Armada by the English vessels, he might not have ordered\r\nthe use of the d'Erlon column.\r\n\r\nBluecher in his instructions to his troops, recalled that the French\r\nhave never held out before the resolute march of the Prussians in\r\nattack column....\r\n\r\nSuvaroff used no better tactics. Yet his battalions in Italy drove us\r\nat the point of their bayonets.\r\n\r\nEach nation in Europe says: \"No one stands his ground before a bayonet\r\ncharge made by us.\" All are right. The French, no more than others,\r\nresist a resolute attack. All are persuaded that their attacks are\r\nirresistable; that an advance will frighten the enemy into flight.\r\nWhether the bayonet be fixed or in the scabbard makes no\r\ndifference....\r\n\r\nThere is an old saying that young troops become uneasy if any one\r\ncomes upon them in a tumult and in disorder; the old troops, on\r\nthe contrary, see victory therein. At the commencement of a war,\r\nall troops are young. Our impetuosity pushes us to the front like\r\nfools ... the enemy flees. If the war lasts, everybody becomes inured.\r\nThe enemy no longer troubles himself when in front of troops charging\r\nin a disordered way, because he knows and feels that they are moved as\r\nmuch by fear as by determination. Good order alone impresses the enemy\r\nin an attack, for it indicates real determination. That is why it is\r\nnecessary to secure good order and retain it to the very last. It is\r\nunwise to take the running step prematurely, because you become a\r\nflock of sheep and leave so many men behind that you will not reach\r\nyour objective. The close column is absurd; it turns you in advance\r\ninto a flock of sheep, where officers and men are jumbled together\r\nwithout mutual support. It is then necessary to march as far as\r\npossible in such order as best permits the action of the\r\nnon-commissioned officers, the action of unity, every one marching in\r\nfront of eye-witnesses, in the open. On the other hand, in closed\r\ncolumns man marches unobserved and on the slightest pretext he lies\r\ndown or remains behind. Therefore, it is best always to keep the\r\nskirmishers in advance or on the flanks, and never to recall them when\r\nin proximity to the enemy. To do so establishes a counter current that\r\ncarries away your men. Let your skirmishers alone. They are your lost\r\nchildren; they will know best how to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: there is no shock of infantry on infantry. There is no\r\nphysical impulse, no force of mass. There is but a moral impulse. No\r\none denies that this moral impulse is stronger as one feels better\r\nsupported, that it has greater effect on the enemy as it menaces him\r\nwith more men. From this it follows that the column is more valuable\r\nfor the attack than the deployed order.\r\n\r\nIt might be concluded from this long statement that a moral pressure,\r\nwhich always causes flight when a bold attack is made, would not\r\npermit any infantry to hold out against a cavalry charge; never,\r\nindeed, against a determined charge. But infantry must resist when it\r\nis not possible to flee, and until there is complete demoralization,\r\nabsolute terror, the infantry appreciates this. Every infantryman\r\nknows it is folly to flee before cavalry when the rifle is infallible\r\nat point-blank, at least from the rider's point of view. It is true\r\nthat every really bold charge ought to succeed. But whether man is on\r\nfoot or on horseback, he is always man. While on foot he has but\r\nhimself to force; on horseback he must force man and beast to march\r\nagainst the enemy. And mounted, to flee is so easy. (Remark by\r\nVarney).\r\n\r\nWe have seen then in an infantry mass those in rear are powerless to\r\npush those in front unless the danger is greater in rear. The cavalry\r\nhas long understood this. It attacks in a column at double distance\r\nrather than at half-distance, in order to avoid the frightful\r\nconfusion of the mass. And yet, the allurement of mathematical\r\nreasoning is such that cavalry officers, especially the Germans, have\r\nseriously proposed attacking infantry by deep masses, so that the\r\nunits in rear might give impulse to those in front. They cite the\r\nproverb, \"One nail drives the other.\" What can you say to people who\r\ntalk such nonsense? Nothing, except, \"Attack us always in this way.\"\r\n\r\nReal bayonet attacks occurred in the Crimean war. (Inkermann). [40]\r\nThey were carried out by a small force against a larger one. The power\r\nof mass had no influence in such cases. It was the mass which fell\r\nback, turned tail even before the shock. The troops who made the bold\r\ncharge did nothing but strike and fire at backs. These instances show\r\nmen unexpectedly finding themselves face to face with the enemy, at a\r\ndistance at which a man can close fearlessly without falling out on\r\nthe way breathless. They are chance encounters. Man is not yet\r\ndemoralized by fire; he must strike or fall back.... Combat at close\r\nquarters does not exist. At close quarters occurs the ancient carnage\r\nwhen one force strikes the other in the back.\r\n\r\nColumns have absolutely but a moral effect. They are threatening\r\ndispositions....\r\n\r\nThe mass impulse of cavalry has long been discredited. You have given\r\nup forming it in deep ranks although cavalry possesses a speed that\r\nwould bring on more of a push upon the front at a halt than the last\r\nranks of the infantry would bring upon the first. Yet you believe in\r\nthe mass action of infantry!\r\n\r\nAs long as the ancient masses marched forward, they did not lose a man\r\nand no one lay down to avoid the combat. Dash lasted up to the time of\r\nstopping; the run was short in every case. In modern masses, in French\r\nmasses especially, the march can be continued, but the mass loses\r\nwhile marching under fire. Moral pressure, continually exerted during\r\na long advance, stops one-half of the combatants on the way. To-day,\r\nabove all in France, man protests against such use of his life. The\r\nFrenchman wants to fight, to return blow for blow. If he is not\r\nallowed to, this is what happens. It happened to Napoleon's masses.\r\nLet us take Wagram, where his mass was not repulsed. Out of twenty-two\r\nthousand men, three thousand to fifteen hundred reached the position.\r\nCertainly the position was not carried by them, but by the material\r\nand moral effect of a battery of one hundred pieces, cavalry, etc.,\r\netc. Were the nineteen thousand missing men disabled? No. Seven out of\r\ntwenty-two, a third, an enormous proportion may have been hit. What\r\nbecame of the twelve thousand unaccounted for? They had lain down on\r\nthe road, had played dummy in order not to go on to the end. In the\r\nconfused mass of a column of deployed battalions, surveillance,\r\ndifficult enough in a column at normal distances, is impossible.\r\nNothing is easier than dropping out through inertia; nothing more\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nThis thing happens to every body of troops marching forward, under\r\nfire, in whatever formation it may be. The number of men falling out\r\nin this way, giving up at the least opportunity, is greater as\r\nformation is less fixed and the surveillance of officers and comrades\r\nmore difficult. In a battalion in closed column, this kind of\r\ntemporary desertion is enormous; one-half of the men drop out on the\r\nway. The first platoon is mingled with the fourth. They are really a\r\nflock of sheep. No one has control, all being mixed. Even if, in\r\nvirtue of the first impulse, the position is carried, the disorder is\r\nso great that if it is counter-attacked by four men, it is lost.\r\n\r\nThe condition of morale of such masses is fully described in the\r\nbattle of Caesar against the Nervii, Marius against the Cimbri. [41]\r\n\r\nWhat better arguments against deep columns could there be than the\r\ndenials of Napoleon at St. Helena?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Skirmishers--Supports--Reserves--Squares\r\n\r\nThis is singular. The cavalry has definite tactics. Essentially it\r\nknows how it fights. The infantry does not.\r\n\r\nOur infantry no longer has any battle tactics; the initiative of the\r\nsoldier rules. The soldiers of the First Empire trusted to the moral\r\nand passive action of masses. To-day, the soldiers object to the\r\npassive action of masses. They fight as skirmishers, or they march to\r\nthe front as a flock of sheep of which three-fourths seek cover\r\nenroute, if the fire is heavy. The first method, although better than\r\nthe second, is bad unless iron discipline and studied and practical\r\nmethods of fighting insure maintaining strong reserves. These should\r\nbe in the hands of the leaders and officers for support purposes, to\r\nguard against panics, and to finish by the moral effect of a march on\r\nthe enemy, of flank menaces, etc., the destructive action of the\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\nTo-day when the ballistic arm is so deadly, so effective, a unit which\r\ncloses up in order to fight is a unit in which morale is weakened.\r\n\r\nManeuver is possible only with good organization; otherwise it is no\r\nmore effective than the passive mass or a rabble in an attack.\r\n\r\nIn ancient combat, the soldier was controlled by the leader in\r\nengagements; now that fighting is open, the soldier cannot be\r\ncontrolled. Often he cannot even be directed. Consequently it is\r\nnecessary to begin an action at the latest possible moment, and to\r\nhave the immediate commanders understand what is wanted, what their\r\nobjectives are, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the modern engagement, the infantryman gets from under our control\r\nby scattering, and we say: a soldier's war. Wrong, wrong. To solve\r\nthis problem, instead of scattering to the winds, let us increase the\r\nnumber of rallying points by solidifying the companies. From them come\r\nbattalions; from battalions come regiments.\r\n\r\nAction in open order was not possible nor evident under Turenne. The\r\nmajority of the soldiers that composed the army, were not held near at\r\nhand, in formation. They fought badly. There was a general seeking for\r\ncover. Note the conduct of the Americans in their late war.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the legion of Marshal Saxe shows the strength of\r\nthe tendency toward shock action as opposed to fire action.\r\n\r\nThe drills, parades and firing at Potsdam were not the tactics of Old\r\nFritz. Frederick's secret was promptitude and rapidity of movement.\r\nBut they were popularly believed to be his means. People were fond of\r\nthem, and are yet. The Prussians for all their leaning toward parade,\r\nmathematics, etc., ended by adopting the best methods. The Prussians\r\nof Jena were taken in themselves by Frederick's methods. But since\r\nthen they have been the first to strike out in a practical way, while\r\nwe, in France, are still laboring at the Potsdam drills.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of generals who fought in the last wars, under real\r\nbattle conditions, ask for skirmishers in large units, well supported.\r\nOur men have such a strong tendency to place themselves in such units\r\neven against the will of their leaders, that they do not fight\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nA number of respectable authors and military men advocate the use of\r\nskirmishers in large bodies, as being dictated by certain necessities\r\nof war. Ask them to elucidate this mode of action, and you will see\r\nthat this talk of skirmishers in large bodies is nothing else but an\r\neuphemism for absolute disorder. An attempt has been made to fit the\r\ntheory to the fact. Yet the use of skirmishers in large bodies is\r\nabsurd with Frenchmen under fire, when the terrain and the sharpness\r\nof the action cause the initiative and direction to escape from the\r\ncommanders, and leave it to the men, to small groups of soldiers.\r\n\r\nArms are for use. The best disposition for material effect in attack\r\nor defense is that which permits the easiest and most deadly use of\r\narms. This disposition is the scattered thin line. The whole of the\r\nscience of combat lies then in the happy, proper combination, of the\r\nopen order, scattered to secure destructive effect, and a good\r\ndisposition of troops in formation as supports and reserves, so as to\r\nfinish by moral effect the action of the advanced troops. The proper\r\ncombination varies with the enemy, his morale and the terrain. On the\r\nother hand, the thin line can have good order only with a severe\r\ndiscipline, a unity which our men attain from pride. Pride exists only\r\namong people who know each other well, who have esprit de corps, and\r\ncompany spirit. There is a necessity for an organization that renders\r\nunity possible by creating the real individuality of the company.\r\n\r\nSelf-esteem is unquestionably one of the most powerful motives which\r\nmoves our men. They do not wish to pass for cowards in the eyes of\r\ntheir comrades. If they march forward they want to distinguish\r\nthemselves. After every attack, formation (not the formation of the\r\ndrill ground but that adopted by those rallying to the chief, those\r\nmarching with him,) no longer exists. This is because of the inherent\r\ndisorder of every forward march under fire. The bewildered men, even\r\nthe officers, have no longer the eyes of their comrades or of their\r\ncommander upon them, sustaining them. Self-esteem no longer impels\r\nthem, they do not hold out; the least counter-offensive puts them to\r\nrout.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the evening ought always to serve the day following;\r\nbut as the next day is never identical with the evening before, the\r\ncounsel of experience can not be applied to the latter. When confused\r\nbattalions shot at each other some two hundred paces for some time\r\nwith arms inferior to those of our days, flight commenced at the\r\nwings. Therefore, said experience, let us reenforce the wings, and the\r\nbattalion was placed between two picked companies. But it was found\r\nthat the combat methods had been transformed. The elite companies were\r\nthen reassembled into picked corps and the battalion, weaker than\r\never, no longer had reenforced wings. Perhaps combat in open order\r\npredominates, and the companies of light infantrymen being, above all,\r\nskirmishers, the battalion again is no longer supported. In our day\r\nthe use of deployed battalions as skirmishers is no longer possible;\r\nand one of the essential reasons for picked companies is the\r\nstrengthening of the battalion.\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked; Who saved the French army on the Beresina\r\nand at Hanau? The Guard, it is true. But, outside of the picked corps,\r\nwhat was the French army then? Droves, not troops. Abnormal times,\r\nabnormal deeds. The Beresina, Hanau, prove nothing to-day.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid-firing arms of infantry to-day, the advantage belongs\r\nto the defense which is completed by offensive movements carried out\r\nat opportune times.\r\n\r\nFire to-day is four or five times more rapid even if quite as\r\nhaphazard as in the days of muzzle loaders. Everybody says that this\r\nrenders impossible the charges of cavalry against infantry which has\r\nnot been completely thrown into disorder, demoralized. What then must\r\nhappen to charges of infantry, which marches while the cavalry\r\ncharges?\r\n\r\nAttacks in deep masses are no longer seen. They are not wise, and\r\nnever were wise. To advance to the attack with a line of battalions in\r\ncolumn, with large intervals and covered by a thick line of\r\nskirmishers, when the artillery has prepared the terrain, is very\r\nwell. People with common sense have never done otherwise. But the\r\nthick line of skirmishers is essential. I believe that is the crux of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this. It is simple prudence for the artillery to prepare\r\nthe infantry action by a moment's conversation with the artillery of\r\nthe enemy infantry. If that infantry is not commanded by an imbecile,\r\nas it sometimes is, it will avoid that particular conversation the\r\narguments of which would break it up, although they may not be\r\ndirected precisely in its direction. All other things being equal,\r\nboth infantries suffer the same losses in the artillery duel. The\r\nproportion does not vary, however complete the artillery preparation.\r\n\r\nOne infantry must always close with another under rapid fire from\r\ntroops in position, and such a fire is, to-day more than ever, to the\r\nadvantage of the defense. Ten men come towards me; they are at four\r\nhundred meters; with the ancient arm, I have time to kill but two\r\nbefore they reach me; with rapid fire, I have time to kill four or\r\nfive. Morale does not increase with losses. The eight remaining might\r\nreach me in the first case; the five or six remaining will certainly\r\nnot in the second.\r\n\r\nIf distance be taken, the leader can be seen, the file-closers see,\r\nthe platoon that follows watches the preceding. Dropping out always\r\nexists, but it is less extensive with an open order, the men running\r\nmore risks of being recognized. Stragglers will be fewer as the\r\ncompanies know each other better, and as the officers and men are more\r\ndependable.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to get the French infantry to make\r\nuse of its fire before charging. If it fires, it will not charge,\r\nbecause it will continue to fire. (Bugeaud's method of firing during\r\nthe advance is good.) What is needed, then, is skirmishers, who\r\ndeliver the only effective fire, and troops in formation who push the\r\nskirmishers on, in themselves advancing to the attack.\r\n\r\nThe soldier wants to be occupied, to return shot for shot. Place him\r\nin a position to act immediately, individually. Then, whatever he\r\ndoes, you have not wholly lost your authority over him.\r\n\r\nAgain and again and again, at drill, the officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficer ought to tell the private: \"This is taught you to serve you\r\nunder such circumstances.\" Generals, field officers, ought to tell\r\nofficers the same thing. This alone can make an instructed army like\r\nthe Roman army. But to-day, who of us can explain page for page, the\r\nuse of anything ordered by our tactical regulations except the school\r\nof the skirmisher? \"Forward,\" \"retreat,\" and \"by the flank,\" are the\r\nonly practical movements under fire. But the others should be\r\nexplained. Explain the position of \"carry arms\" with the left hand.\r\nExplain the ordinary step. Explain firing at command in the school of\r\nthe battalion. It is well enough for the school of the platoon,\r\nbecause a company can make use thereof, but a battalion never can.\r\n\r\nEverything leads to the belief that battle with present arms will be,\r\nin the same space of time, more deadly than with ancient ones. The\r\ntrajectory of the projectile reaching further, the rapidity of firing\r\nbeing four times as great, more men will be put out of commission in\r\nless time. While the arm becomes more deadly, man does not change, his\r\nmorale remains capable of certain efforts and the demands upon it\r\nbecome stronger. Morale is overtaxed; it reaches more rapidly the\r\nmaximum of tension which throws the soldier to the front or rear. The\r\nrole of commanders is to maintain morale, to direct those movements\r\nwhich men instinctively execute when heavily engaged and under the\r\npressure of danger.\r\n\r\nNapoleon I said that in battle, the role of skirmishers is the most\r\nfatiguing and most deadly. This means that under the Empire, as at\r\npresent, the strongly engaged infantry troops rapidly dissolved into\r\nskirmishers. The action was decided by the moral agency of the troops\r\nnot engaged, held in hand, capable of movement in any direction and\r\nacting as a great menace of new danger to the adversary, already\r\nshaken by the destructive action of the skirmishers. The same is true\r\nto-day. But the greater force of fire arms requires, more than ever,\r\nthat they be utilized. The role of the skirmisher becomes preeminently\r\nthe destructive role; it is forced on every organization seriously\r\nengaged by the greater moral pressure of to-day which causes men to\r\nscatter sooner.\r\n\r\nCommanders-in-chief imagine formed battalions firing on the enemy and\r\ndo not include the use of skirmishers in drill. This is an error, for\r\nthey are necessary in drill and everywhere, etc. The formed rank is\r\nmore difficult to utilize than ever. General Leboeuf used a very\r\npractical movement of going into battle, by platoons, which advance to\r\nthe battle line in echelon, and can fire, even if they are taken in\r\nthe very act of the movement. There is always the same dangerous\r\ntendency toward mass action even for a battalion in maneuver. This is\r\nan error. The principles of maneuver for small units should not be\r\nconfused with those for great units. Emperor Napoleon did not\r\nprescribe skirmishers in flat country. But every officer should be\r\nreduced who does not utilize them to some degree.\r\n\r\nThe role of the skirmisher becomes more and more predominant. He\r\nshould be so much the more watched and directed as he is used against\r\nmore deadly arms, and, consequently, is more disposed to escape from\r\nall control, from all direction. Yet under such battle conditions\r\nformations are proposed which send skirmishers six hundred paces in\r\nadvance of battalions and which give the battalion commander the\r\nmission of watching and directing (with six companies of one hundred\r\nand twenty men) troops spread over a space of three hundred paces by\r\nfive hundred, at a minimum. To advance skirmishers six hundred paces\r\nfrom their battalion and to expect they will remain there is the work\r\nof people who have never observed.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as combat by skirmishers tends to predominate and since it\r\nbecomes more difficult with the increase of danger, there has been a\r\nconstant effort to bring into the firing line the man who must direct\r\nit. Leaders have been seen to spread an entire battalion in front of\r\nan infantry brigade or division so that the skirmishers, placed under\r\na single command, might obey a general direction better. This method,\r\nscarcely practicable on the drill-ground, and indicating an absolute\r\nlack of practical sense, marks the tendency. The authors of new drills\r\ngo too far in the opposite direction. They give the immediate command\r\nof the skirmishers in each battalion to the battalion commander who\r\nmust at the same time lead his skirmishers and his battalion. This\r\nexpedient is more practical than the other. It abandons all thought of\r\nan impossible general control and places the special direction in the\r\nright hands. But the leadership is too distant, the battalion\r\ncommander has to attend to the participation of his battalion in the\r\nline, or in the ensemble of other battalions of the brigade or\r\ndivision, and the particular performance of his skirmishers. The more\r\ndifficult, confused, the engagement becomes, the more simple and clear\r\nought to be the roles of each one. Skirmishers are in need of a firmer\r\nhand than ever to direct and maintain them, so that they may do their\r\npart. The battalion commander must be entirely occupied with the role\r\nof skirmishers, or with the role of the line. There should be smaller\r\nbattalions, one-half the number in reserve, one-half as skirmisher\r\nbattalions. In the latter the men should be employed one-half as\r\nskirmishers and one-half held in reserve. The line of skirmishers will\r\nthen gain steadiness.\r\n\r\nLet the battalion commander of the troops of the second line entirely\r\noccupy himself with his battalion.\r\n\r\nThe full battalion of six companies is to-day too unwieldy for one\r\nman. Have battalions of four companies of one hundred men each, which\r\nis certainly quite sufficient considering the power of destruction\r\nwhich these four companies place in the hands of one man. He will have\r\ndifficulty in maintaining and directing these four companies under the\r\noperation of increasingly powerful modern appliances. He will have\r\ndifficulty in watching them, in modern combat, with the greater\r\ninterval between the men in line that the use of the present arms\r\nnecessitates. With a unified battalion of six hundred men, I would do\r\nbetter against a battalion of one thousand Prussians, than with a\r\nbattalion of eight hundred men, two hundred of whom are immediately\r\ntaken out of my control.\r\n\r\nSkirmishers have a destructive effect; formed troops a moral effect.\r\nDrill ground maneuvers should prepare for actual battle. In such\r\nmaneuvers, why, at the decisive moment of an attack, should you\r\nlighten the moral anxiety of the foe by ceasing his destruction, by\r\ncalling back your skirmishers? If the enemy keeps his own skirmishers\r\nand marches resolutely behind them, you are lost, for his moral action\r\nupon you is augmented by his destructive action against which you have\r\nkindly disarmed yourself.\r\n\r\nWhy do you call back your skirmishers? Is it because your skirmishers\r\nhinder the operation of your columns, block bayonet charges? One must\r\nnever have been in action to advance such a reason. At the last\r\nmoment, at the supreme moment when one or two hundred meters separate\r\nyou from the adversary, there is no longer a line. There is a fearless\r\nadvance, and your skirmishers are your forlorn hope. Let them charge\r\non their own account. Let them be passed or pushed forward by the\r\nmass. Do not recall them. Do not order them to execute any maneuver\r\nfor they are not capable of any, except perhaps, that of falling back\r\nand establishing a counter-current which might drag you along. In\r\nthese moments, everything hangs by a thread. Is it because your\r\nskirmishers would prevent you from delivering fire? Do you, then,\r\nbelieve in firing, especially in firing under the pressure of\r\napproaching danger, before the enemy? If he is wise, certainly he\r\nmarches preceded by skirmishers, who kill men in your ranks and who\r\nhave the confidence of a first success, of having seen your\r\nskirmishers disappear before them. These skirmishers will certainly\r\nlie down before your unmasked front. In that formation they easily\r\ncause you losses, and you are subjected to their destructive effect\r\nand to the moral effect of the advance of troops in formation against\r\nyou. Your ranks become confused; you do not hold the position. There\r\nis but one way of holding it, that is to advance, and for that, it is\r\nnecessary at all costs to avoid firing before moving ahead. Fire\r\nopened, no one advances further.\r\n\r\nDo you believe in opening and ceasing fire at the will of the\r\ncommander as on the drill ground? The commencement of fire by a\r\nbattalion, with the present arms especially, is the beginning of\r\ndisorder, the moment where the battalion begins to escape from its\r\nleader. While drilling even, the battalion commanders, after a little\r\nlively drill, after a march, can no longer control the fire.\r\n\r\nDo you object that no one ever gets within two hundred meters of the\r\nenemy? That a unit attacking from the front never succeeds? So be it!\r\nLet us attack from the flank. But a flank is always more or less\r\ncovered. Men are stationed there, ready for the blow. It will be\r\nnecessary to pick off these men.\r\n\r\nTo-day, more than ever, no rapid, calm firing is possible except\r\nskirmish firing.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of firing has reduced six ranks to two ranks. With\r\nreliable troops who have no need of the moral support of a second rank\r\nbehind them, one rank suffices to-day. At any rate, it is possible to\r\nawait attack in two ranks.\r\n\r\nIn prescribing fire at command, in seeking to minimize the role of\r\nskirmishers instead of making it predominate, you take sides with the\r\nGermans. We are not fitted for that sort of game. If they adopt fire\r\nat command, it is just one more reason for our finding another method.\r\nWe have invented, discovered the skirmisher; he is forced upon us by\r\nour men, our arms, etc. He must be organized.\r\n\r\nIn fire by rank, in battle, men gather into small groups and become\r\nconfused. The more space they have, the less will be the disorder.\r\n\r\nFormed in two ranks, each rank should be still thinner. All the shots\r\nof the second line are lost. The men should not touch; they should be\r\nfar apart. The second rank in firing from position at a supreme\r\nmoment, ought not to be directly behind the first. The men ought to be\r\necheloned behind the first. There will always be firing from position\r\non any front. It is necessary to make this firing as effective and as\r\neasy as possible. I do not wish to challenge the experiences of the\r\ntarget range but I wish to put them to practical use.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the present arms are more deadly than the ancient\r\nones; the morale of the troops will therefore be more severely shaken.\r\nThe influence of the leader should be greater over the combatants,\r\nthose immediately engaged. If it seems rational, let colonels engage\r\nin action, with the battalions of their regiment in two lines. One\r\nbattalion acts as skirmishers; the other battalion waits, formed ready\r\nto aid the first. If you do not wish so to utilize the colonels, put\r\nall the battalions of the regiment in the first line, and eventually\r\nuse them as skirmishers. The thing is inevitable; it will be done in\r\nspite of you. Do it yourself at the very first opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of replenishing the ammunition supply so quickly used up\r\nby the infantry, requires engaging the infantry by units only, which\r\ncan be relieved by other units after the exhaustion of the ammunition\r\nsupply. As skirmishers are exhausted quickly, engage entire battalions\r\nas skirmishers, assisted by entire battalions as supports or reserves.\r\nThis is a necessary measure to insure good order. Do not throw into\r\nthe fight immediately the four companies of the battalion. Up to the\r\ncrucial moment, the battalion commander ought to guard against\r\nthrowing every one into the fight.\r\n\r\nThere is a mania, seen in our maneuver camps, for completely covering\r\na battle front, a defended position, by skirmishers, without the least\r\ninterval between the skirmishers of different battalions. What will be\r\nthe result? Initially a waste of men and ammunition. Then, difficulty\r\nin replacing them.\r\n\r\nWhy cover the front everywhere? If you do, then what advantage is\r\nthere in being able to see from a great distance? Leave large\r\nintervals between your deployed companies. We are no longer only one\r\nhundred meters from the enemy at the time of firing. Since we are able\r\nto see at a great distance we do not risk having the enemy dash into\r\nthese intervals unexpectedly. Your skirmisher companies at large\r\nintervals begin the fight, the killing. While your advance companies\r\nmove ahead, the battalion commander follows with his formed companies,\r\ndefilading them as much as possible. He lets them march. If the\r\nskirmishers fight at the halt, he supervises them. If the commanding\r\nofficer wishes to reenforce his line, if he wants to face an enemy who\r\nattempts to advance into an interval, if he has any motive for doing\r\nit, in a word, he rushes new skirmishers into the interval. Certainly,\r\nthese companies have more of the forward impulse, more dash, if dash\r\nis needed, than the skirmishers already in action. If they pass the\r\nfirst skirmishers, no harm is done. There you have echelons already\r\nformed. The skirmishers engaged, seeing aid in front of them, can be\r\nlaunched ahead more easily.\r\n\r\nBesides, the companies thrown into this interval are a surprise for\r\nthe enemy. That is something to be considered, as is the fact that so\r\nlong as there is fighting at a halt, intervals in the skirmish lines\r\nare fit places for enemy bullets. Furthermore, these companies remain\r\nin the hands of their leaders. With the present method of reenforcing\r\nskirmishers--I am speaking of the practical method of the battlefield,\r\nnot of theory--a company, starting from behind the skirmishers\r\nengaged, without a place in which to deploy, does not find anything\r\nbetter to do than to mingle with the skirmishers. Here it doubles the\r\nnumber of men, but in doing so brings disorder, prevents the control\r\nof the commanders and breaks up the regularly constituted groups.\r\nWhile the closing up of intervals to make places for new arrivals is\r\ngood on the drill ground, or good before or after the combat, it never\r\nworks during battle.\r\n\r\nNo prescribed interval will be kept exactly. It will open, it will\r\nclose, following the fluctuations of the combat. But the onset, during\r\nwhich it can be kept, is not the moment of brisk combat; it is the\r\nmoment of the engagement, of contact, consequently, of feeling out. It\r\nis essential that there remain space in which to advance. Suppose you\r\nare on a plain, for in a maneuver one starts from the flat terrain. In\r\nextending the new company it will reenforce the wings of the others,\r\nthe men naturally supporting the flanks of their comrades. The\r\nindividual intervals will lessen in order to make room for the new\r\ncompany. The company will always have a well determined central group,\r\na rallying point for the others. If the interval has disappeared there\r\nis always time to employ the emergency method of doubling the ranks in\r\nfront; but one must not forget, whatever the course taken, to preserve\r\ngood order.\r\n\r\nWe cannot resist closing intervals between battalions; as if we were\r\nstill in the times of the pikemen when, indeed, it was possible to\r\npass through an interval! To-day, the fighting is done ten times\r\nfarther away, and the intervals between battalions are not weak\r\njoints. They are covered by the fire of the skirmishers, as well\r\ncovered by fire as the rest of the front, and invisible to the enemy.\r\n\r\nSkirmishers and masses are the formations for action of poorly\r\ninstructed French troops. With instruction and unity there would be\r\nskirmishers supported and formation in battalion columns at most.\r\n\r\nTroops in close order can have only a moral effect, for the attack, or\r\nfor a demonstration. If you want to produce a real effect, use\r\nmusketry. For this it is necessary to form a single line. Formations\r\nhave purely moral effect. Whoever counts on their material, effective\r\naction against reliable, cool troops, is mistaken and is defeated.\r\nSkirmishers alone do damage. Picked shots would do more if properly\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIn attacking a position, start the charge at the latest possible\r\nmoment, when the leader thinks he can reach the objective not all out\r\nof breath. Until then, it has been possible to march in rank, that is\r\nunder the officers, the rank not being the mathematical line, but the\r\ngrouping in the hands of the leader, under his eye. With the run comes\r\nconfusion. Many stop, the fewer as the run is shorter. They lie down\r\non the way and will rejoin only if the attack succeeds, if they join\r\nat all. If by running too long the men are obliged to stop in order to\r\nbreathe and rest, the dash is broken, shattered. At the advance, very\r\nfew will start. There are ten chances to one of seeing the attack\r\nfail, of turning it into a joke, with cries of \"Forward with fixed\r\nbayonet,\" but none advancing, except some brave men who will be killed\r\nuselessly. The attack vanishes finally before the least demonstration\r\nof the foe. An unfortunate shout, a mere nothing, can destroy it.\r\n\r\nAbsolute rules are foolish, the conduct of every charge being an\r\naffair requiring tact. But so regulate by general rules the conduct of\r\nan infantry charge that those who commence it too far away can\r\nproperly be accused of panic. And there is a way. Regulate it as the\r\ncavalry charge is regulated, and have a rearguard in each battalion of\r\nnon-commissioned officers, of most reliable officers, in order to\r\ngather together, to follow close upon the charge, at a walk, and to\r\ncollect all those who have lain down so as not to march or because\r\nthey were out of breath. This rearguard might consist of a small\r\nplatoon of picked shots, such as we need in each battalion. The charge\r\nought to be made at a given distance, else it vanishes, evaporates.\r\nThe leader who commences it too soon either has no head, or does not\r\nwant to gain his objective.\r\n\r\nThe infantry of the line, as opposed to elite commands, should not be\r\nkept in support. The least firm, the most impressionable, are thus\r\nsent into the road stained with the blood of the strongest. We place\r\nthem, after a moral anxiety of waiting, face to face with the terrible\r\ndestruction and mutilation of modern weapons. If antiquity had need of\r\nsolid troops as supports, we have a greater need of them. Death in\r\nancient combat was not as horrible as in the modern battle where the\r\nflesh is mangled, slashed by artillery fire. In ancient combat, except\r\nin defeat, the wounded were few in number. This is the reply to those\r\nwho wish to begin an action by chasseurs, zouaves, etc.\r\n\r\nHe, general or mere captain, who employs every one in the storming of\r\na position can be sure of seeing it retaken by an organized\r\ncounter-attack of four men and a corporal.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may have real supervision and responsibility in units\r\nfrom companies to brigades, the supporting troops ought to be of the\r\nsame company, the same battalion, the same brigade, as the case may\r\nbe. Each brigade ought to have its two lines, each battalion its\r\nskirmishers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe system of holding out a reserve as long as possible for\r\nindependent action when the enemy has used his own, ought to be\r\napplied downwards. Each battalion should have its own, each regiment\r\nits own, firmly maintained.\r\n\r\nThere is more need than ever to-day, for protecting the supporting\r\nforces, the reserves. The power of destruction increases, the morale\r\nremains the same. The tests of morale, being more violent than\r\npreviously, ought to be shorter, because the power of morale has not\r\nincreased. The masses, reserves, the second, the first lines, should\r\nbe protected and sheltered even more than the skirmishers.\r\n\r\nSquares sometimes are broken by cavalry which pursues the skirmishers\r\ninto the square. Instead of lying down, they rush blindly to their\r\nrefuge which they render untenable and destroy. No square can hold out\r\nagainst determined troops.... But!\r\n\r\nThe infantry square is not a thing of mechanics, of mathematical\r\nreasoning; it is a thing of morale. A platoon in four ranks, two\r\nfacing the front, two the rear, its flanks guarded by the extreme\r\nfiles that face to the flank, and conducted, supported by the\r\nnon-commissioned officers placed in a fifth rank, in the interior of\r\nthe rectangle, powerful in its compactness and its fire, cannot be\r\ndislodged by cavalry. However, this platoon will prefer to form a part\r\nof a large square, it will consider itself stronger, because of\r\nnumbers, and indeed it will be, since the feeling of force pervades\r\nthis whole force. This feeling is power in war.\r\n\r\nPeople who calculate only according to the fire delivered, according\r\nto the destructive power of infantry, would have it fight deployed\r\nagainst cavalry. They do not consider that although supported and\r\nmaintained, although such a formation seem to prevent flight, the very\r\nimpetus of the charge, if led resolutely, will break the deployment\r\nbefore the shock arrives. It is clear that if the charge is badly\r\nconducted, whether the infantry be solid or not, it will never reach\r\nits objective. Why? Moral reasons and no others make the soldier in a\r\nsquare feel himself stronger than when in line. He feels himself\r\nwatched from behind and has nowhere to flee.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Firing\r\n\r\nIt is easy to misuse breech-loading weapons, such as the rifle. The\r\nfashion to-day is to use small intrenchments, covering battalions. As\r\nold as powder. Such shelter is an excellent device on the condition,\r\nhowever, that behind it, a useful fire can be delivered.\r\n\r\nLook at these two ranks crouched under the cover of a small trench.\r\nFollow the direction of the shots. Even note the trajectory shown by\r\nthe burst of flame. You will be convinced that, under such conditions,\r\neven simple horizontal firing is a fiction. In a second, there will be\r\nwild firing on account of the noise, the crowding, the interference of\r\nthe two ranks. Next everybody tries to get under the best possible\r\ncover. Good-by firing.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to save ammunition, to get all possible efficiency\r\nfrom the arm. Yet the official adoption of fire by rank insures\r\nrelapsing into useless firing at random. Good shots are wasted, placed\r\nwhere it is impossible for them to fire well.\r\n\r\nSince we have a weapon that fires six times more rapidly than the\r\nancient weapon, why not profit by it to cover a given space with six\r\ntimes fewer riflemen than formerly? Riflemen placed at greater\r\nintervals, will be less bewildered, will see more clearly, will be\r\nbetter watched (which may seem strange to you), and will consequently\r\ndeliver a better fire than formerly. Besides, they will expend six\r\ntimes less ammunition. That is the vital point. You must always have\r\nammunition available, that is to say, troops which have not been\r\nengaged. Reserves must be held out. This is hard to manage perhaps. It\r\nis not so hard to manage, however, as fire by command.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of fire by rank? By command? It is impracticable\r\nagainst the enemy, except in extraordinary cases. Any attempt at\r\nsupervision of it is a joke! File firing? The first rank can shoot\r\nhorizontally, the only thing required; the second rank can fire only\r\ninto the air. It is useless to fire with our bulky knapsacks\r\ninterfering so that our men raise the elbow higher than the shoulder.\r\nLearn what the field pack can be from the English, Prussians,\r\nAustrians, etc.... Could the pack not be thicker and less wide? Have\r\nthe first rank open; let the second be checkerwise; and let firing\r\nagainst cavalry be the only firing to be executed in line.\r\n\r\nOne line will be better than two, because it will not be hindered by\r\nthe one behind it. One kind of fire is practicable and efficient, that\r\nof one rank. This is the fire of skirmishers in close formation.\r\n\r\nThe king's order of June 1st, 1776, reads (p. 28): \"Experience in war\r\nhaving proved that three ranks fire standing, and the intention of his\r\nmajesty being to prescribe only what can be executed in front of the\r\nenemy, he orders that in firing, the first man is never to put his\r\nknee on the ground, and that the three ranks fire standing at the same\r\ntime.\" This same order includes instructions on target practice, etc.\r\n\r\nMarshal de Gouvion-Saint Cyr says that conservatively one-fourth of\r\nthe men who are wounded in an affair are put out of commission by the\r\nthird rank. This estimate is not high enough if it concerns a unit\r\ncomposed of recruits like those who fought at Luetzen and Bautzen. The\r\nmarshal mentions the astonishment of Napoleon when he saw the great\r\nnumber of men wounded in the hand and forearm. This astonishment of\r\nNapoleon's is singular. What ignorance in his marshals not to have\r\nexplained such wounds! Chief Surgeon Larrey, by observation of the\r\nwounds, alone exonerated our soldiers of the accusation of\r\nself-inflicted wounds. The observation would have been made sooner,\r\nhad the wounds heretofore been numerous. That they had not been can be\r\nexplained only by the fact that while the young soldiers of 1813 kept\r\ninstinctively close in ranks, up to that time the men must have spaced\r\nthemselves instinctively, in order to be able to shoot. Or perhaps in\r\n1813, these young men might have been allowed to fire a longer time in\r\norder to distract them and keep them in ranks, and not often allowed\r\nto act as skirmishers for fear of losing them. Whilst formerly, the\r\nfire by rank must have been much rarer and fire action must have given\r\nway almost entirely to the use of skirmishers.\r\n\r\nFire by command presupposes an impossible coolness. Had any troops\r\never possessed it they would have mowed down battalions as one mows\r\ndown corn stalks. Yet it has been known for a long time, since\r\nFrederick, since before Frederick, since the first rifle. Let troops\r\nget the range calmly, let them take aim together so that no one\r\ndisturbs or hinders the other. Have each one see clearly, then, at a\r\nsignal, let them all fire at once. Who is going to stand against such\r\npeople? But did they aim in those days? Not so accurately, possibly,\r\nbut they knew how to shoot waist-high, to shoot at the feet. They knew\r\nhow to do it. I do not say they did it. If they had done so, there\r\nwould not have been any need of reminding them of it so often. Note\r\nCromwell's favorite saying, \"Aim at their shoe-laces;\" that of the\r\nofficers of the empire, \"Aim at the height of the waist.\" Study of\r\nbattles, of the expenditure of bullets, show us no such immediate\r\nterrible results. If such a means of destruction was so easy to\r\nobtain, why did not our illustrious forbears use it and recommend it\r\nto us? (Words of de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr.)\r\n\r\nSecurity alone creates calmness under fire.\r\n\r\nIn minor operations of war, how many captains are capable of\r\ntranquilly commanding their fire and maneuvering with calmness?\r\n\r\nHere is a singular thing. You hear fire by rank against cavalry\r\nseriously recommended in military lectures. Yet not a colonel, not a\r\nbattalion commander, not a captain, requires this fire to be executed\r\nin maneuvers. It is always the soldier who forces the firing. He is\r\nordered to shoot almost before he aims for fear he will shoot without\r\ncommand. Yet he ought to feel that when he is aiming, his finger on\r\nthe trigger, his shot does not belong to him, but rather to the\r\nofficer who ought to be able to let him aim for five minutes, if\r\nadvisable, examining, correcting the positions, etc. He ought, when\r\naiming, always be ready to fire upon the object designated, without\r\never knowing when it will please his commander to order him to fire.\r\n\r\nFire at command is not practicable in the face of the enemy. If it\r\nwere, the perfection of its execution would depend on the coolness of\r\nthe commander and the obedience of the soldier. The soldier is the\r\nmore easily trained.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians had fire by command in Italy against cavalry. Did they\r\nuse it? They fired before the command, an irregular fire, a fire by\r\nfile, with defective results.\r\n\r\nFire by command is impossible. But why is firing by rank at will\r\nimpossible, illusory, under the fire of the enemy? Because of the\r\nreasons already given and, for this reason: that closed ranks are\r\nincompatible with fire-arms, on account of the wounding caused by the\r\nlatter in ranks. In closed ranks, the two lines touching elbows, a man\r\nwho falls throws ten men into complete confusion. There is no room for\r\nthose who drop and, however few fall, the resulting disorder\r\nimmediately makes of the two ranks a series of small milling groups.\r\nIf the troops are young, they become a disordered flock before any\r\ndemonstration. (Caldiero, Duhesme.) If the troops have some\r\nsteadiness, they of themselves will make space: they will try to make\r\nway for the bullets: they will scatter as skirmishers with small\r\nintervals. (Note the Grenadier Guards at Magenta.)[42]\r\n\r\nWith very open ranks, men a pace apart, whoever falls has room, he is\r\nnoticed by a lesser number, he drags down no one in his fall. The\r\nmoral impression on his comrades is less. Their courage is less\r\nimpaired. Besides, with rapid fire everywhere, spaced ranks with no\r\nman in front of another, at least permit horizontal fire. Closed ranks\r\npermit it hardly in the first rank, whose ears are troubled by the\r\nshots from the men behind. When a man has to fire four or five shots a\r\nminute, one line is certainly more solid than two, because, while the\r\nfiring is less by half, it is more than twice as likely to be\r\nhorizontal fire as in the two-rank formation. Well-sustained fire,\r\neven with blank cartridges, would be sufficient to prevent a\r\nsuccessful charge. With slow fire, two ranks alone were able to keep\r\nup a sufficiently continuous fusillade. With rapid fire, a single line\r\ndelivers more shots than two with ancient weapons. Such fire,\r\ntherefore, suffices as a fusillade.\r\n\r\nClose ranks, while suitable for marching, do not lend themselves to\r\nfiring at the halt. Marching, a man likes a comrade at his side.\r\nFiring, as if he felt the flesh attracting the lead, he prefers being\r\nrelatively isolated, with space around him. Breech-loading rifles\r\nbreed queer ideas. Generals are found who say that rapid firing will\r\nbring back fire at command, as if there ever were such a thing. They\r\nsay it will bring back salvo firing, thus permitting clear vision. As\r\nif such a thing were possible! These men have not an atom of common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nIt is singular to see a man like Guibert, with practical ideas on most\r\nthings, give a long dissertation to demonstrate that the officers of\r\nhis time were wrong in aiming at the middle of the body, that is, in\r\nfiring low. He claims this is ridiculous to one who understands the\r\ntrajectory of the rifle. These officers were right. They revived the\r\nrecommendations of Cromwell, because they knew that in combat the\r\nsoldier naturally fires too high because he does not aim, and because\r\nthe shape of the rifle, when it is brought to the shoulder, tends to\r\nkeep the muzzle higher than the breech. Whether that is the reason or\r\nsomething else, the fact is indisputable. It is said that in Prussian\r\ndrills all the bullets hit the ground at fifty paces. With the arms of\r\nthat time and the manner of fighting, results would have been\r\nmagnificent in battle if the bullets had struck fifty paces before the\r\nenemy instead of passing over his head.\r\n\r\nYet at Mollwitz, where the Austrians had five thousand men disabled,\r\nthe Prussians had over four thousand.\r\n\r\nFiring with a horizontal sector, if the muzzle be heavy, is more\r\ndeadly than firing with a vertical sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Marches. Camps. Night Attacks.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that infantry ought always to fight in thin formation,\r\nscattered, it does not follow that it ought to be kept in that order.\r\nOnly in column is it possible to maintain the battle order. It is\r\nnecessary to keep one's men in hand as long as possible, because once\r\nengaged, they no longer belong to you.\r\n\r\nThe disposition in closed mass is not a suitable marching formation,\r\neven in a battalion for a short distance. On account of heat, the\r\nclosed column is intolerable, like an unventilated room. Formation\r\nwith half-distances is better. (Why? Air, view, etc.)\r\n\r\nSuch a formation prevents ready entry of the column into battle in\r\ncase of necessity or surprise. The half-divisions not in the first line\r\nare brought up, the arms at the order, and they can furnish either\r\nskirmishers or a reserve for the first line which has been deployed as\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\nAt Leuctra, Epaminondas diminished, by one-half, the depth of his men;\r\nhe formed square phalanxes of fifty men to a side. He could have very\r\nwell dispensed with it, for the Lacedaemonian right was at once thrown\r\ninto disorder by its own cavalry which was placed in front of that\r\nwing. The superior cavalry of Epaminondas overran not only the cavalry\r\nbut the infantry that was behind it. The infantry of Epaminondas,\r\ncoming in the wake of his cavalry finished the work. Turning to the\r\nright, the left of Epaminondas then took in the flank the\r\nLacedaemonian line. Menaced also in front by the approaching echelons\r\nof Epaminondas, this line became demoralized and took to flight.\r\nPerhaps this fifty by fifty formation was adopted in order to give,\r\nwithout maneuver, a front of fifty capable of acting in any direction.\r\nAt Leuctra, it simply acted to the right and took the enemy in the\r\nflank and in reverse.\r\n\r\nThick woods are generally passed through in close column. There is\r\nnever any opening up, with subsequent closing on the far side. The\r\nresulting formation is as confused as a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\nIn a march through mountains, difficult country, a bugler should be on\r\nthe left, at the orders of an intelligent officer who indicates when\r\nthe halt seems necessary for discipline in the line. The right\r\nresponds and if the place has been judged correctly an orderly\r\nformation is maintained. Keep in ranks. If one man steps out, others\r\nfollow. Do not permit men to leave ranks without requiring them to\r\nrejoin.\r\n\r\nIn the rear-guard it is always necessary to have pack mules in an\r\nemergency; without this precaution, considerable time may be lost. In\r\ncertain difficult places time is thus lost every day.\r\n\r\nIn camp, organize your fatigue parties in advance; send them out in\r\nformation and escorted.\r\n\r\nDefinite and detailed orders ought to be given to the convoy, and the\r\nchief baggage-master ought to supervise it, which is rarely the case.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to furnish mules to officers and replace them in case\r\nof loss or sickness. The officer overloads the mule and the Government\r\nloses more thereby than is generally understood. Convoys are endless\r\nowing to overloaded mules and stragglers. If furnished money to buy a\r\nmule the officer uses it economically because it is his. If mules are\r\nindividually furnished to officers instead of money, the officer will\r\ncare for his beast for the same reason. But it is better to give money\r\nonly, and the officer, if he is not well cared for on the march has no\r\nclaim against the Government.\r\n\r\nAlways, always, take Draconian measures to prevent pillage from\r\ncommencing. If it begins, it is difficult ever to stop it. A body of\r\ninfantry is never left alone. There is no reason for calling officers\r\nof that arm inapt, when battalions although established in position\r\nare not absolutely on the same line, with absolutely equal intervals.\r\nTen moves are made to achieve the exact alignment which the\r\ninstructions on camp movements prescribe. Yet designating a guiding\r\nbattalion might answer well enough and still be according to the\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nWhy are not night attacks more employed to-day, at least on a grand\r\nscale? The great front which armies occupy renders their employment\r\nmore difficult, and exacts of the troops an extreme aptitude in this\r\nkind of surprise tactics (found in the Arabs, Turcos, Spahis), or\r\nabsolute reliability. There are some men whose knowledge of terrain is\r\nwonderful, with an unerring eye for distance, who can find their way\r\nthrough places at night which they have visited only in the day time.\r\nUtilizing such material for a system of guides it would be possible to\r\nmove with certainty. These are simple means, rarely employed, for\r\nconducting a body of troops into position on the darkest night. There\r\nis, even, a means of assuring at night the fire of a gun upon a given\r\npoint with as much precision as in plain day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCAVALRY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Cavalry and Modern Appliances\r\n\r\nThey say that cavalry is obsolete; that it can be of no use in battles\r\nwaged with the weapons of today. Is not infantry affected in the same\r\nway?\r\n\r\nExamples drawn from the last two wars are not conclusive. In a siege,\r\nin a country which is cut off, one does not dare to commit the\r\ncavalry, and therefore takes from it its boldness, which is almost its\r\nonly weapon.\r\n\r\nThe utility of cavalry has always been doubted. That is because its\r\ncost is high. It is little used, just because it does cost. The\r\nquestion of economy is vital in peace times. When we set a high value\r\nupon certain men, they are not slow to follow suit, and to guard\r\nthemselves against being broken. Look at staff officers who are almost\r\nnever broken (reduced), even when their general himself is.\r\n\r\nWith new weapons the role of cavalry has certainly changed less than\r\nany other, although it is the one which is most worried about.\r\nHowever, cavalry always has the same doctrine: Charge! To start with,\r\ncavalry action against cavalry is always the same. Also against\r\ninfantry. Cavalry knows well enough today, as it has always known,\r\nthat it can act only against infantry which has been broken. We must\r\nleave aside epic legends that are always false, whether they relate to\r\ncavalry or infantry. Infantry cannot say as much of its own action\r\nagainst infantry. In this respect there is a complete anarchy of\r\nideas. There is no infantry doctrine.\r\n\r\nWith the power of modern weapons, which forces you to slow down if it\r\ndoes not stop you, the advance under fire becomes almost impossible.\r\nThe advantage is with the defensive. This is so evident that only a\r\nmadman could dispute it. What then is to be done? Halt, to shoot at\r\nrandom and cannonade at long range until ammunition is exhausted?\r\nPerhaps. But what is sure, is that such a state of affairs makes\r\nmaneuver necessary. There is more need than ever for maneuver at a\r\nlong distance in an attempt to force the enemy to shift, to quit his\r\nposition. What maneuver is swifter than that of cavalry? Therein is\r\nits role.\r\n\r\nThe extreme perfection of weapons permits only individual action in\r\ncombat, that is action by scattered forces. At the same time it\r\npermits the effective employment of mass action out of range, of\r\nmaneuvers on the flank or in the rear of the enemy in force imposing\r\nenough to frighten him.\r\n\r\nCan the cavalry maneuver on the battle field? Why not? It can maneuver\r\nrapidly, and above all beyond the range of infantry fire, if not of\r\nartillery fire. Maneuver being a threat, of great moral effect, the\r\ncavalry general who knows how to use it, can contribute largely to\r\nsuccess. He arrests the enemy in movement, doubtful as to what the\r\ncavalry is going to attempt. He makes the enemy take some formation\r\nthat keeps him under artillery fire for a while, above all that of\r\nlight artillery if the general knows how to use it. He increases the\r\nenemy's demoralization and thus is able to rejoin his command.\r\n\r\nRifled cannon and accurate rifles do not change cavalry tactics at\r\nall. These weapons of precision, as the word precision indicates, are\r\neffective only when all battle conditions, all conditions of aiming,\r\nare ideal. If the necessary condition of suitable range is lacking,\r\neffect is lacking. Accuracy of fire at a distance is impossible\r\nagainst a troop in movement, and movement is the essence of cavalry\r\naction. Rifled weapons fire on them of course, but they fire on\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nIn short, cavalry is in the same situation as anybody else.\r\n\r\nWhat response is there to this argument? Since weapons have been\r\nimproved, does not the infantryman have to march under fire to attack\r\na position? Is the cavalryman not of the same flesh? Has he less heart\r\nthan the infantryman? If one can march under fire, cannot the other\r\ngallop under it?\r\n\r\nWhen the cavalryman cannot gallop under fire, the infantryman cannot\r\nmarch under it. Battles will consist of exchanges of rifle shots by\r\nconcealed men, at long range. The battle will end only when the\r\nammunition is exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe cavalryman gallops through danger, the infantryman walks. That is\r\nwhy, if he learns, as it is probable he will, to keep at the proper\r\ndistance, the cavalryman will never see his battle role diminished by\r\nthe perfection of long range fire. An infantryman will never succeed\r\nby himself. The cavalryman will threaten, create diversions, worry,\r\nscatter the enemy's fire, often even get to close quarters if he is\r\nproperly supported. The infantryman will act as usual. But more than\r\never will he need the aid of cavalry in the attack. He who knows how\r\nto use his cavalry with audacity will inevitably be the victor. Even\r\nthough the cavalryman offers a larger target, long range weapons will\r\nparalyze him no more than another.\r\n\r\nThe most probable effect of artillery of today, will be to increase\r\nthe scattering in the infantry, and even in the cavalry. The latter\r\ncan start in skirmisher formation at a distance and close in while\r\nadvancing, near its objective. It will be more difficult to lead; but\r\nthis is to the advantage of the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nThe result of improving the ballistics of the weapon, for the cavalry\r\nas for the infantry (there is no reason why it should be otherwise for\r\nthe cavalry), will be that a man will flee at a greater distance from\r\nit, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nSince the Empire, the opinion of European armies is that the cavalry\r\nhas not given the results expected of it.\r\n\r\nIt has not given great results, for the reason that we and others\r\nlacked real cavalry generals. He is, it seems, a phenomenon that is\r\nproduced only every thousand years, more rarely than a real general of\r\ninfantry. To be a good general, whether of infantry or cavalry, is an\r\ninfinitely rare thing, like the good in everything. The profession of\r\na good infantry general is as difficult as, perhaps more difficult\r\nthan, that of a good cavalry general. Both require calmness. It comes\r\nmore easily to the cavalryman than to the foot soldier who is much\r\nmore engaged. Both require a like precision, a judgment of the moral\r\nand physical forces of the soldier; and the morale of the infantryman,\r\nhis constitution, is more tried than is the case with the horseman.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry general, of necessity, sees less clearly; his vision has\r\nits limits. Great cavalry generals are rare. Doubtless Seidlitz could\r\nnot, in the face of the development of cannon and rifle, repeat his\r\nwonders. But there is always room for improvement. I believe there is\r\nmuch room for improvement.\r\n\r\nWe did not have under the Empire a great cavalry general who knew how\r\nto handle masses. The cavalry was used like a blind hammer that\r\nstrikes heavily and not always accurately. It had immense losses. Like\r\nthe Gauls, we have a little too much confidence in the \"forward,\r\nforward, not so many methods.\" Methods do not hinder the forward\r\nmovement. They prepare the effect and render it surer and at the same\r\ntime less costly to the assailant. We have all the Gallic brutality.\r\n(Note Marignano, where the force of artillery and the possibility of a\r\nturning movement around a village was neglected). What rare things\r\ninfantry and cavalry generals are!\r\n\r\nA leader must combine resolute bravery and impetuosity with prudence\r\nand calmness; a difficult matter!\r\n\r\nThe broken terrain of European fields no longer permits, we are told,\r\nthe operation of long lines, of great masses of cavalry. I do not\r\nregret it. I am struck more with the picturesque effect of these\r\nhurricanes of cavalry in the accounts of the Empire than with the\r\nresults obtained. It does not seem to me that these results were in\r\nproportion to the apparent force of the effort and to the real\r\ngrandeur of the sacrifices. And indeed, these enormous hammers (a\r\nusual figure), are hard to handle. They have not the sure direction of\r\na weapon well in hand. If the blow is not true, recovery is\r\nimpossible, etc. However, the terrain does not to-day permit the\r\nassembling of cavalry in great masses. This compelling reason for new\r\nmethods renders any other reason superfluous.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the other reasons given in the ministerial observations\r\nof 1868, on the cavalry service, seems to me excellent. The\r\nimprovement of appliances, the extension of battle fields, the\r\nconfidence to the infantry and the audacity to the artillery that the\r\nimmediate support of the cavalry gives, demand that this arm be in\r\nevery division in sufficient force for efficient action.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, think it desirable for a cavalry regiment to be at the\r\ndisposal of a general commanding a division. Whatever the experiences\r\nof instruction centers, they can not change in the least my conviction\r\nof the merit of this measure in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Cavalry Against Cavalry\r\n\r\nCavalry action, more than that of infantry, is an affair of morale.\r\n\r\nLet us study first the morale of the cavalry engagement in single\r\ncombat. Two riders rush at each other. Are they going to direct their\r\nhorses front against front? Their horses would collide, both would be\r\nforced to their feet, while running the chance of being crushed in the\r\nclash or in the fall of their mounts. Each one in the combat counts on\r\nhis strength, on his skill, on the suppleness of his mount, on his\r\npersonal courage; he does not want a blind encounter, and he is right.\r\nThey halt face to face, abreast, to fight man to man; or each passes\r\nthe other, thrusting with the sabre or lance; or each tries to wound\r\nthe knee of the adversary and dismount him in this way. But as each is\r\ntrying to strike the other, he thinks of keeping out of the way\r\nhimself, he does not want a blind encounter that does away with the\r\ncombat. The ancient battles, the cavalry engagements, the rare cavalry\r\ncombats of our days, show us nothing else.\r\n\r\nDiscipline, while keeping the cavalrymen in the ranks, has not been\r\nable to change the instinct of the rider. No more than the isolated\r\nman is the rider in the line willing to meet the shock of a clash with\r\nthe enemy. There is a terrible moral effect in a mass moving forward.\r\nIf there is no way to escape to the right or to the left, men and\r\nhorses will avoid the clash by stopping face to face. But only\r\npreeminently brave troops, equally seasoned in morale, alike well led\r\nand swept along, animated alike, will meet face to face. All these\r\nconditions are never found united on either side, so the thing is\r\nnever seen. Forty-nine times out of fifty, one of the cavalry forces\r\nwill hesitate, bolt, get into disorder, flee before the fixed purpose\r\nof the other. Three quarters of the time this will happen at a\r\ndistance, before they can see each other's eyes. Often they will get\r\ncloser. But always, always, the stop, the backward movement, the\r\nswerving of horses, the confusion, bring about fear or hesitation.\r\nThey lessen the shock and turn it into instant flight. The resolute\r\nassailant does not have to slacken. He has not been able to overcome\r\nor turn the obstacles of horses not yet in flight, in this uproar of\r\nan impossible about face executed by routed troops, without being in\r\ndisorder himself. But this disorder is that of victory, of the\r\nadvance, and a good cavalry does not trouble itself about it. It\r\nrallies in advancing, while the vanquished one has fear at its heels.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there are few losses. The engagement, if there is one,\r\nis an affair of a second. The proof is that in this action of cavalry\r\nagainst cavalry, the conquered alone loses men, and he loses generally\r\nfew. The battle against infantry is alone the really deadly struggle.\r\nLike numbers of little chasseurs have routed heavy cuirassiers. How\r\ncould they have done so if the others had not given way before their\r\ndetermination? The essential factor was, and always is, determination.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry's casualties are always much less than those of the\r\ninfantry both from fire and from disease. Is it because the cavalry is\r\nthe aristocratic arm? This explains why in long wars it improves much\r\nmore than the infantry.\r\n\r\nAs there are few losses between cavalry and cavalry, so there is\r\nlittle fighting.\r\n\r\nHannibal's Numidians, like the Russian Cossacks, inspired a veritable\r\nterror by the incessant alarms they caused. They tired out without\r\nfighting and killed by surprise.\r\n\r\nWhy is the cavalry handled so badly?--It is true that infantry is not\r\nused better.--Because its role is one of movement, of morale, of\r\nmorale and movement so united, that movement alone, often without a\r\ncharge or shock action of any sort can drive the enemy into retreat,\r\nand, if followed closely, into rout. That is a result of the quickness\r\nof cavalry. One who knows how to make use of this quickness alone can\r\nobtain such results.\r\n\r\nAll writers on cavalry will tell you that the charge pushed home of\r\ntwo cavalry bodies and the shock at top speed do not exist. Always\r\nbefore the encounter, the weaker runs away, if there is not a face to\r\nface check. What becomes then of the MV squared? If this famous\r\nMV squared is an empty word, why then crush your horses under giants,\r\nforgetting that in the formula besides M there is V squared. In a\r\ncharge, there is M, there is V squared, there is this and that. There\r\nis resolution, and I believe, nothing else that counts!\r\n\r\nCohesion and unity give force to the charge. Alignment is impossible\r\nat a fast gait where the most rapid pass the others. Only when the\r\nmoral effect has been produced should the gait be increased to take\r\nadvantage of it by falling upon an enemy already in disorder, in the\r\nact of fleeing. The cuirassiers charge at a trot. This calm steadiness\r\nfrightens the enemy into an about face. Then they charge at his back,\r\nat a gallop.\r\n\r\nThey say that at Eckmuehl, for every French cuirassier down, fourteen\r\nAustrians were struck in the back. Was it because they had no\r\nback-plate? It is evident that it was because they offered their backs\r\nto the blows.\r\n\r\nJomini speaks of charges at a trot against cavalry at a gallop. He\r\ncites Lasalle who used the trot and who, seeing cavalry approach at a\r\ngallop, would say: \"There are lost men.\" Jomini insists on the effect\r\nof shock. The trot permits that compactness which the gallop breaks\r\nup. That may be true. But the effect is moral above all. A troop at\r\nthe gallop sees a massed squadron coming towards it at a trot. It is\r\nsurprised at first at such coolness. The material impulse of the\r\ngallop is superior; but there are no intervals, no gaps through which\r\nto penetrate the line in order to avoid the shock, the shock that\r\novercomes men and horses. These men must be very resolute, as their\r\nclose ranks do not permit them to escape by about facing. If they move\r\nat such a steady gait, it is because their resolution is also firm and\r\nthey do not feel the need of running away, of diverting themselves by\r\nthe unchecked speed of the unrestrained gallop, etc. [43]\r\n\r\nGalloping men do not reason these things out, but they know them\r\ninstinctively. They understand that they have before them a moral\r\nimpulse superior to theirs. They become uneasy, hesitate. Their hands\r\ninstinctively turn their horses aside. There is no longer freedom in\r\nthe attack at a gallop. Some go on to the end, but three-fourths have\r\nalready tried to avoid the shock. There is complete disorder,\r\ndemoralization, flight. Then begins the pursuit at a gallop by the men\r\nwho attacked at the trot.\r\n\r\nThe charge at a trot exacts of leaders and men complete confidence and\r\nsteadfastness. It is the experience of battle only that can give this\r\ntemper to all. But this charge, depending on a moral effect, will not\r\nalways succeed. It is a question of surprise. Xenophon [44] recommended,\r\nin his work on cavalry operations, the use of surprise, the use of the\r\ngallop when the trot is customary, and vice-versa. \"Because,\" he says,\r\n\"agreeable or terrible, the less a thing is foreseen, the more\r\npleasure or fright does it cause. This is nowhere seen better than in\r\nwar, where every surprise strikes terror even to the strongest.\"\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the gallop is and should be necessary in the\r\ncharge; it is the winning, intoxicating gait, for men and horses. It\r\nis taken up at such a distance as may be necessary to insure its\r\nsuccess, whatever it may cost in men and horses. The regulations are\r\ncorrect in prescribing that the charge be started close up. If the\r\ntroopers waited until the charge was ordered, they would always\r\nsucceed. I say that strong men, moved by pride or fear, by taking up\r\ntoo soon the charge against a firm enemy, have caused more charges to\r\nfail than to succeed. Keeping men in hand until the command \"charge,\"\r\nseizing the precise instant for this command, are both difficult. They\r\nexact of the energetic leader domination over his men and a keen eye,\r\nat a moment when three out of four men no longer see anything, so that\r\ngood cavalry leaders, squadron leaders in general are very rare. Real\r\ncharges are just as rare.\r\n\r\nActual shock no longer exists. The moral impulse of one of the\r\nadversaries nearly always upsets the other, perhaps far off, perhaps a\r\nlittle nearer. Were this \"a little nearer,\" face to face, one of the\r\ntwo troops would be already defeated before the first saber cut and\r\nwould disentangle itself for flight. With actual shock, all would be\r\nthrown into confusion. A real charge on the one part or the other\r\nwould cause mutual extermination. In practice the victor scarcely\r\nloses any one.\r\n\r\nObservation demonstrates that cavalry does not close with cavalry; its\r\ndeadly combats are those against infantry alone.\r\n\r\nEven if a cavalryman waits without flinching, his horse will wish to\r\nescape, to shrink before the collision. If man anticipates, so does\r\nthe horse. Why did Frederick like to see his center closed in for the\r\nassault? As the best guarantee against the instincts of man and horse.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry of Frederick had ordinarily only insignificant losses: a\r\nresult of determination.\r\n\r\nThe men want to be distracted from the advancing danger by movement.\r\nThe cavalrymen who go at the enemy, if left to themselves, would start\r\nat a gallop, for fear of not arriving, or of arriving exhausted and\r\nmaterial for carnage. The same is true of the Arabs. Note what\r\nhappened in 1864 to the cavalry of General Martineau. The rapid move\r\nrelieves anxiety. It is natural to wish to lessen it. But the leaders\r\nare there, whom experience, whom regulations order to go slowly, then\r\nto accelerate progressively, so as to arrive with the maximum of\r\nspeed. The procedure should be the walk, then the trot, after that the\r\ngallop, then the charge. But it takes a trained eye to estimate\r\ndistance and the character of the terrain, and, if the enemy\r\napproaches, to pick the point where one should meet him. The nearer\r\none approaches, the greater among the troops is the question of\r\nmorale. The necessity of arriving at the greatest speed is not alone a\r\nmechanical question, since indeed one never clashes, it is a moral\r\nnecessity. It is necessary to seize the moment at which the uneasiness\r\nof one's men requires the intoxication of the headlong charging\r\ngallop. An instant too late, and a too great anxiety has taken the\r\nupper hand and caused the hands of the riders to act on the horses;\r\nthe start is not free; a number hide by remaining behind. An instant\r\ntoo soon: before arrival the speed has slowed down; the animation, the\r\nintoxication of the run, fleeting things, are exhausted. Anxiety takes\r\nthe upper hand again, the hands act instinctively, and even if the\r\nstart were unhampered, the arrival is not.\r\n\r\nFrederick and Seidlitz were content when they saw the center of the\r\ncharging squadron three and four ranks deep. It was as if they\r\nunderstood that with this compact center, as the first lines could not\r\nescape to the right or left, they were forced to continue straight\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nIn order to rush like battering-rams, even against infantry, men and\r\nhorses ought to be watered and fresh (Ponsomby's cavalry at Waterloo).\r\nIf there is ever contact between cavalry, the shock is so weakened by\r\nthe hands of the men, the rearing of the horses, the swinging of\r\nheads, that both sides come to a halt.\r\n\r\nOnly the necessity for carrying along the man and the horse at the\r\nsupreme moment, for distracting them, necessitates the full gallop\r\nbefore attacking the enemy, before having put him to flight.\r\n\r\nCharges at the gallop of three or four kilometers, suppose horses of\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\nBecause morale is not studied and because historical accounts are\r\ntaken too literally, each epoch complains that cavalry forces are no\r\nlonger seen charging and fighting with the sword, that too much\r\nprudence dictates running away instead of clashing with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThese plaints have been made ever since the Empire, both by the\r\nallies, and by us. But this has always been true. Man was never\r\ninvulnerable. The charging gait has almost always been the trot. Man\r\ndoes not change. Even the combats of cavalry against cavalry today are\r\ndeadlier than they were in the lamented days of chivalry.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the infantry is always more difficult than that of the\r\ncavalry; the latter is simple. A cavalry repulsed and coming back in\r\ndisorder is a foreseen, an ordinary happening; it is going to rally at\r\na distance. It often reappears with advantage. One can almost say, in\r\nview of experience, that such is its role. An infantry that is\r\nrepelled, especially if the action has been a hot one and the cavalry\r\nrushes in, is often disorganized for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nEven authors who tell you that two squadrons never collide, tell you\r\ncontinually: \"The force of cavalry is in the shock.\" In the terror of\r\nthe shock, Yes. In the shock, No! It lies only in determination. It is\r\na mental and not a mechanical condition.\r\n\r\nNever give officers and men of the cavalry mathematical demonstrations\r\nof the charge. They are good only to shake confidence. Mathematical\r\nreasoning shows a mutual collapse that never takes place. Show them\r\nthe truth. Lasalle with his always victorious charge at a trot guarded\r\nagainst similar reasonings, which might have demonstrated to him\r\nmathematically that a charge of cuirassiers at a trot ought to be\r\nrouted by a charge of hussars at a gallop. He simply told them: \"Go\r\nresolutely and be sure that you will never find a daredevil determined\r\nenough to come to grips with you.\" It is necessary to be a daredevil\r\nin order to go to the end. The Frenchman is one above all. Because he\r\nis a good trooper in battle, when his commanders themselves are\r\ndaredevils he is the best in Europe. (Note the days of the Empire, the\r\nremarks of Wellington, a good judge). If moreover, his leaders use a\r\nlittle head work, that never harms anything. The formula of the\r\ncavalry is R (Resolution) and R, and always R, and R is greater than\r\nall the MV squared in the world.\r\n\r\nThere is this important element in the pursuit of cavalry by cavalry.\r\nThe pursued cannot halt without delivering himself up to the pursuer.\r\nThe pursuer can always see the pursued. If the latter halts and starts\r\nto face about the pursuer can fall upon him before he is faced, and\r\ntake him by surprise. But the pursued does not know how many are\r\npursuing him. If he alone halts two pursuers may rush on him, for they\r\nsee ahead of them and they naturally attack whoever tries to face\r\nabout. For with the about face danger again confronts them. The\r\npursuit is often instigated by the fear that the enemy will turn. The\r\nmaterial fact that once in flight all together cannot turn again\r\nwithout risking being surprised and overthrown, makes the flight\r\ncontinuous. Even the bravest flee, until sufficient distance between\r\nthem and the enemy, or some other circumstances such as cover or\r\nsupporting troops, permits of a rally and a return to the offensive.\r\nIn this case the pursuit may turn into flight in its turn.\r\n\r\nCavalry is insistent on attacking on an equal front. Because, if with\r\na broader front, the enemy gives way before it, his wings may attack\r\nit and make it the pursued instead of the pursuer. The moral effect of\r\nresolution is so great that cavalry, breaking and pursuing a more\r\nnumerous cavalry, is never pursued by the enemy wings. However the\r\nidea that one may be taken in rear by forces whom one has left on the\r\nflanks in a position to do so, has such an effect that the resolution\r\nnecessary for an attack under these circumstances is rare.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that Colonel A---- does not want a depth formation for\r\ncavalry, he who believes in pressure of the rear ranks on the first?\r\nIt is because at heart he is convinced that only the first rank can\r\nact in a cavalry charge, and that this rank can receive no impression,\r\nno speeding up, from those behind it.\r\n\r\nThere is debate as to the advantage of one or two ranks for the\r\ncavalry. This again is a matter of morale. Leave liberty of choice,\r\nand under varying conditions of confidence and morale one or the other\r\nwill be adopted. There are enough officers for either formation.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of cavalry to advance further than infantry and\r\nconsequently it exposes its flanks more. It then needs more reserves\r\nto cover its flanks and rear than does infantry. It needs reserves to\r\nprotect and to support the pursuers who are almost always pursued when\r\nthey return. With cavalry even more than infantry victory belongs to\r\nthe last reserves held intact. The one with the reserves is always the\r\none who can take the offensive. Tie to that, and no one can stand\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nWith room to maneuver cavalry rallies quickly. In deep columns it\r\ncannot.\r\n\r\nThe engagement of cavalry lasts only a moment. It must be reformed\r\nimmediately. With a roll call at each reforming, it gets out of hand\r\nless than the infantry, which, once engaged, has little respite. There\r\nshould be a roll call for cavalry, and for infantry after an advance,\r\nat each lull. There should be roll calls at drill and in field\r\nmaneuvers, not that they are necessary but in order to become\r\nhabituated to them. Then the roll call will not be forgotten on the\r\nday of action, when very few think of what ought to be done.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion and speed of cavalry action, man escapes more easily\r\nfrom surveillance. In our battles his action is increasingly\r\nindividual and rapid. The cavalryman should not be left too free; that\r\nwould be dangerous. Frequently in action troops should be reformed and\r\nthe roll called. It would be an error not to do so. There might be ten\r\nto twenty roll calls in a day. The officers, the soldiers, would then\r\nhave a chance to demand an accounting from each man, and might demand\r\nit the next day.\r\n\r\nOnce in action, and that action lasts, the infantryman of today\r\nescapes from the control of his officers. This is due to the disorder\r\ninherent in battle, to deployment, to the absence of roll calls, which\r\ncannot be held in action. Control, then, can only be in the hands of\r\nhis comrades. Of modern arms infantry is the one in which there is the\r\ngreatest need for cohesion.\r\n\r\nCavalry always fights very poorly and very little. This has been true\r\nfrom antiquity, when the cavalryman was of a superior caste to the\r\ninfantryman, and ought to have been braver.\r\n\r\nAnybody advancing, cavalry or infantry, ought to scout and reconnoiter\r\nas soon as possible the terrain on which it acts. Conde forgot this at\r\nNeerwinden. The 55th forgot it at Solferino. [45] Everybody forgets it.\r\nAnd from the failure to use skirmishers and scouts, come mistakes and\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry has a rifle for exceptional use. Look out that this\r\nexception does not become the rule. Such a tendency has been seen. At\r\nthe battle of Sicka, the first clash was marred by the lack of dash on\r\nthe part of a regiment of Chasseurs d'Afrique, which after being sent\r\noff at the gallop, halted to shoot. At the second clash General\r\nBugeaud charged at their head to show them how to charge.\r\n\r\nA young Colonel of light cavalry, asked carbines for his cavalry.\r\n\"Why? So that if I want to reconnoiter a village I can sound it from a\r\ndistance of seven or eight hundred meters without losing anybody.\"\r\nWhat can you say to a man advancing such ideas? Certainly the carbine\r\nmakes everybody lose common sense.\r\n\r\nThe work of light cavalry makes it inevitable that they be captured\r\nsometimes. It is impossible to get news of the enemy without\r\napproaching him. If one man escapes in a patrol, that is enough. If no\r\none comes back, even that fact is instructive. The cavalry is a\r\npriceless object that no leader wants to break. However it is only by\r\nbreaking it that results can be obtained.\r\n\r\nSome authors think of using cavalry as skirmishers, mounted or\r\ndismounted. I suppose they advance holding the horse by the bridle?\r\nThis appears to be an absurdity. If the cavalryman fires he will\r\nnot charge. The African incident cited proves that. It would be better\r\nto give the cavalryman two pistols than a carbine.\r\n\r\nThe Americans in their vast country where there is unlimited room,\r\nused cavalry wisely in sending it off on distant forays to cut\r\ncommunications, make levies, etc. What their cavalry did as an arm in\r\nbattle is unknown. The cavalry raids in the American war were part of\r\na war directed against wealth, against public works, against\r\nresources. It was war of destruction of riches, not of men. The\r\nraiding cavalry had few losses, and inflicted few losses. The cavalry\r\nis always the aristocratic arm which loses very lightly, even if it\r\nrisks all. At least it has the air of risking all, which is something\r\nat any rate. It has to have daring and daring is not so common. But\r\nthe merest infantry engagements in equal numbers costs more than the\r\nmost brilliant cavalry raid.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Cavalry Against Infantry\r\n\r\nCavalry knows how to fight cavalry. But how it fights infantry not one\r\ncavalry officer in a thousand knows. Perhaps not one of them knows. Go\r\nto it then gaily, with general uncertainty!\r\n\r\nA military man, a participant in our great wars, recommends as\r\ninfallible against infantry in line the charge from the flank, horse\r\nfollowing horse. He would have cavalry coming up on the enemy's left,\r\npass along his front and change direction so as to use its arms to the\r\nright. This cavalryman is right. Such charges should give excellent\r\nresults, the only deadly results. The cavalryman can only strike to\r\nhis right, and in this way each one strikes. Against ancient infantry\r\nsuch charges would have been as valuable as against modern infantry.\r\nThis officer saw with his own eyes excellent examples of this attack\r\nin the wars of the Empire. I do not doubt either the facts he cites or\r\nthe deductions he makes. But for such charges there must be officers\r\nwho inspire absolute confidence in their men and dependable and\r\nexperienced soldiers. There is necessary, in short, an excellent\r\ncavalry, seasoned by long wars, and officers and men of very firm\r\nresolution. So it is not astonishing that examples of this mode of\r\naction are rare. They always will be. They always require a head for\r\nthe charge, an isolated head, and when he is actually about to strike,\r\nhe will fall back into the formation. It seems to him that lost in the\r\nmass he risks less than when alone. Everybody is willing to charge,\r\nbut only if all charge together. It is a case of belling the cat.\r\n\r\nThe attack in column on infantry has a greater moral action than the\r\ncharge in line. If the first and second squadrons are repulsed, but\r\nthe infantry sees a third charging through the dust, it will say \"When\r\nis this going to stop?\" And it will be shaken.\r\n\r\nAn extract from Folard: \"Only a capable officer is needed to get the\r\nbest results from a cavalry which has confidence in its movement,\r\nwhich is known to be good and vigorous, and also is equipped with\r\nexcellent weapons. Such cavalry will break the strongest battalions,\r\nif its leader has sense enough to know its power and courage enough to\r\nuse this power.\"\r\n\r\nBreaking is not enough, and is a feat that costs more than it is worth\r\nif the whole battalion is not killed or taken prisoner, or at least if\r\nthe cavalry is not immediately followed by other troops, charged with\r\nthis task.\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo our cavalry was exhausted fruitlessly, because it acted\r\nwithout artillery or infantry support.\r\n\r\nAt Krasno, August 14, 1812, Murat, at the head of his cavalry could\r\nnot break an isolated body of ten thousand Russian infantry which\r\ncontinually held him off by its fire, and retired tranquilly across\r\nthe plain.\r\n\r\nThe 72nd was upset by cavalry at Solferino.\r\n\r\nFrom ancient days the lone infantryman has always had the advantage\r\nover the lone cavalryman. There is no shadow of a doubt about this in\r\nancient narrations. The cavalryman only fought the cavalryman. He\r\nthreatened, harassed, troubled the infantryman in the rear, but he did\r\nnot fight him. He slaughtered him when put to flight by other\r\ninfantry, or at least he scattered him and the light infantry\r\nslaughtered him.\r\n\r\nCavalry is a terrible weapon in the hands of one who knows how to use\r\nit. Who can say that Epaminondas could have defeated the Spartans\r\ntwice without his Thessalonian cavalry.\r\n\r\nEventually rifle and artillery fire deafen the soldier; fatigue\r\noverpowers him; he becomes inert; he hears commands no longer. If\r\ncavalry unexpectedly appears, he is lost. Cavalry conquers merely by\r\nits appearance. (Bismarck or Decker).\r\n\r\nModern cavalry, like ancient cavalry, has a real effect only on troops\r\nalready broken, on infantry engaged with infantry, on cavalry\r\ndisorganized by artillery fire or by a frontal demonstration. But\r\nagainst such troops its action is decisive. In such cases its action\r\nis certain and gives enormous results. You might fight all day and\r\nlose ten thousand men, the enemy might lose as many, but if your\r\ncavalry pursues him, it will take thirty thousand prisoners. Its role\r\nis less knightly than its reputation and appearance, less so than the\r\nrole of infantry. It always loses much less than infantry. Its\r\ngreatest effect is the effect of surprise, and it is thereby that it\r\ngets such astonishing results.\r\n\r\nWhat formation should infantry, armed with modern weapons, take to\r\nguard against flank attacks by cavalry? If one fires four times as\r\nfast, if the fire is better sustained, one needs only a quarter as\r\nmany men to guard a point against cavalry. Protection might be secured\r\nby using small groups, placed the range of a rifle shot apart and\r\nflanking each other, left on the flank of the advance. But they must\r\nbe dependable troops, who will not be worried by what goes on behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Armor and Armament\r\n\r\nAn armored cavalry is clearly required for moral reasons.\r\n\r\nNote this with reference to the influence of cuirassiers (armored\r\ncavalrymen) on morale. At the battle of Renty, in 1554, Tavannes, a\r\nmarshal, had with him his company armored in steel. It was the first\r\ntime that such armor had been seen. Supported by some hundreds of\r\nfugitives who had rallied, he threw himself at the head of his\r\ncompany, on a column of two thousand German cavalry who had just\r\nthrown both infantry and cavalry into disorder. He chose his time so\r\nwell that he broke and carried away these two thousand Germans, who\r\nfell back and broke the twelve hundred light horsemen who were\r\nsupporting them. There followed a general flight, and the battle was\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nGeneral Renard says \"The decadence of cavalry caused the disappearance\r\nof their square formations in battle, which were characteristic in the\r\nseventeenth century.\" It was not the decadence of the cavalry but the\r\nabandonment of the cuirass and the perfecting of the infantry weapon\r\nto give more rapid fire. When cuirassiers break through they serve as\r\nexamples, and emulation extends to others, who another time try to\r\nbreak through as they did.\r\n\r\nWhy cuirassiers? Because they alone, in all history, have charged and\r\ndo charge to the end.\r\n\r\nTo charge to the end the cuirassiers need only half the courage of the\r\ndragoons, as their armor raises their morale one half. But since the\r\ncuirassiers have as much natural courage as the dragoons, for they are\r\nall the same men, it is proper to count the more on their action.\r\nShall we have only one kind of cavalry? Which? If all our cavalry\r\ncould wear the cuirass and at the same time do the fatiguing work of\r\nlight cavalry, if all our horses could in addition carry the cuirass\r\nthrough such work, I say that there should be only cuirassiers. But I\r\ndo not understand why the morale given by the cuirass should be\r\nlightly done away with, merely to have one cavalry without the\r\ncuirass.\r\n\r\nA cavalryman armored completely and his horse partially, can charge\r\nonly at a trot.\r\n\r\nOn the appearance of fire arms, cavalry, according to General Ambert,\r\nan author of the past, covered itself with masses of armor resembling\r\nanvils rather than with cuirasses. It was at that time the essential\r\narm. Later as infantry progressed the tactics changed, it needed more\r\nmobility. Permanent armies began to be organized by the State. The\r\nState thought less of the skin of the individual than of economy and\r\nmobility and almost did away with cuirassiers. The cuirass has always\r\ngiven, and today more than ever it will give, confidence to the\r\ncavalryman. Courage, dash, and speed have a value beyond that of mere\r\nmass. I leave aside mathematical discussions which seem to me to have\r\nnothing in common with battle conditions. I would pick to wear the\r\ncuirass the best men in the army, big chested, red-blooded, strong\r\nlimbed, the foot chasseurs. I would organize a regiment of light\r\ncuirassiers for each of our divisions. Men and horses, such a cavalry\r\nwould be much more robust and active than our present cuirassiers. If\r\nour armored cavalry is worth more than any other arm by its dash in\r\nbattle, this cavalry would be worth twice as much. But how would these\r\nmen of small stature get into the saddle? To this serious objection I\r\nanswer, \"They will arrange it.\" And this objection, which I do not\r\nadmit, is the only one that can be made against the organization of a\r\nlight armored cavalry, an organization that is made imperative by the\r\nimprovement in weapons. The remainder of those chasseur battalions\r\nwhich furnish cuirassiers, should return to the infantry, which has\r\nlong demanded them, and hussars and dragoons, dismounted in the\r\nnecessary number will also be welcomed by the infantry.\r\n\r\nAs for the thrust, the thrust is deadlier than the cut. You do not\r\nhave to worry about lifting your arm; you thrust. But it is necessary\r\nthat the cavalryman be convinced that to parry a vertical cut is\r\nfolly. This can be done by his officers, by those who have had\r\nexperience, if there are any such in peace times. This is not easy.\r\nBut in this respect, as in all others, the advantage lies with the\r\nbrave. A cavalry charge is a matter of morale above all. It is\r\nidentical in its methods, its effects, with the infantry charge. All\r\nthe conditions to be fulfilled in the charge (walk, trot, gallop,\r\ncharge, etc.) have a reason bearing on morale. These reasons have\r\nalready been touched on.\r\n\r\nRoman discipline and character demand tenacity. The hardening of the\r\nmen to fatigue, and a good organization, giving mutual support,\r\nproduced that tenacity, against which the bravest could not stand. The\r\nexhausting method of powerful strokes used by the Gauls could not last\r\nlong against the skillful, terrible and less fatiguing method of\r\nfighting by the thrust.\r\n\r\nThe Sikh cavalrymen of M. Nolan armed with dragoon sabers sharpened by\r\nthemselves, liked the cut. They knew nothing about methods of\r\nswordsmanship; they did not practice. They said \"A good saber and a\r\nwillingness to use it are enough.\" True, True!\r\n\r\nThere is always discussion as to the lance or the saber. The lance\r\nrequires skillful vigorous cavalrymen, good horsemen, very well\r\ndrilled, very adroit, for the use of the lance is more difficult than\r\nthat of the straight sword, especially if the sword is not too heavy.\r\nIs not this an answer to the question? No matter what is done, no\r\nmatter what methods are adopted, it must always be remembered that our\r\nrecruits in war time are sent into squadrons as into battalions, with\r\na hasty and incomplete training. If you give them lances, most of them\r\nwill just have sticks in their hands, while a straight sword at the\r\nend of a strong arm is at the same time simple and terrible. A short\r\ntrident spear, with three short points just long enough to kill but\r\nnot only enough to go through the body, would remain in the body of\r\nthe man and carry him along. It would recoil on the cavalryman who\r\ndelivered the blow, he would be upset by the blow himself. But the\r\ndragoon must be supported by the saddle, and as he had kept hold of\r\nthe shaft he would be able to disengage the fork which had pierced the\r\nbody some six inches. No cavalry of equal morale could stand against a\r\ncavalry armed with such forked spears.\r\n\r\nAs between forks and lances, the fork would replace the lance. That\r\nis, of course, for beginners in mounted fencing. But the fork! It\r\nwould be ridiculous, not military!\r\n\r\nWith the lance one always figures without the horse, whose slightest\r\nmovement diverts the lance so much. The lance is a weapon frightful\r\neven to the mounted man who uses it properly. If he sticks an enemy at\r\nthe gallop, he is dismounted, torn off by the arm attached to the\r\nlance which remains in the body of his enemy.\r\n\r\nCavalry officers and others who seek examples in \"Victories and\r\nConquests,\" in official reports, in \"Bazancourt\" are too naive. It is\r\nhard to get at the truth. In war, in all things, we take the last\r\nexample which we have witnessed. And now we want lances, which we do\r\nnot know how to use, which frighten the cavalryman himself and pluck\r\nhim from the saddle if he sticks anybody. We want no more cuirasses;\r\nwe want this and that. We forget that the last example gives only a\r\nrestricted number of instances relating to the matter in question.\r\n\r\nIt appears, according to Xenophon, that it was not easy to throw the\r\ndart from horseback. He constantly recommends obtaining as many men as\r\npossible who know how to throw the dart. He recommends leaning well\r\nback to avoid falling from the horse in the charge. In reading\r\nXenophon it is evident that there was much falling from the horse.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in battle there is as great difficulty in handling the\r\nsaber as in handling the bayonet. Another difficulty for the\r\ncavalryman lies in the handling of the musket. This is seen in the\r\nhandling of the regulation weapon of the Spahis. There is only one\r\nimportant thing for the cavalryman, to be well seated. Men should be\r\non horseback for hours at a time, every day, from their arrival in the\r\norganization. If the selection of those who know something about\r\nhorses was not neglected in the draft, and if such men were, made\r\ncavalrymen, the practical training of the greater number would be much\r\nmore rapidly concluded. I do not speak of the routine of the stable.\r\nBetween mounted drills, foot drills might be gone through with in a\r\nsnappy, free fashion, without rigidity, with daily increasing speed.\r\nSuch drills would instruct cavalrymen more rapidly than the restricted\r\nmethod employed.\r\n\r\nA dragoon horse carries in campaign with one day's food three hundred\r\nand eight pounds, without food or forage two hundred and seventy seven\r\npounds. How can such horses carry this and have speed?\r\n\r\nSeek the end always, not the means! Make a quarter of your cavalrymen\r\ninto muleteers, a quarter of your horses into pack animals. You will\r\nthus secure, for the remaining three quarters unquestioned vigor. But\r\nhow will you make up these pack trains? You will have plenty of\r\nwounded horses after a week of campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nARTILLERY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf artillery did not have a greater range than the rifle, we could not\r\nrisk separating it far from its support, as it would have to wait\r\nuntil the enemy was but four or five hundred paces away to fire on\r\nhim. But the more its range is increased, the further away it can be\r\nplaced from its support.\r\n\r\nThe greater the range of artillery, the greater freedom of action from\r\nthe different arms, which no longer have to be side by side to give\r\nmutual support.\r\n\r\nThe greater the range of artillery, the easier it is to concentrate\r\nits fire. Two batteries fifteen hundred meters apart can concentrate\r\non a point twelve hundred meters in front of and between them. Before\r\nthe range was so long they had to be close together, and the terrain\r\ndid not always lend itself to this.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, do not support a piece by placing infantry just behind or\r\nalongside of it, as is done three-quarters of the time at maneuvers.\r\nOn the contrary hide the infantry to the right or left and far behind,\r\ncover it without worrying too much about distance and let the\r\nartillery call for help if they think that the piece is in danger of\r\nbeing lost. Why should infantry be placed too close, and consequently\r\nhave its advance demoralized? This will throw away the greatest\r\nadvantage that we Frenchmen have in defense, that of defending\r\nourselves by advancing, with morale unimpaired, because we have not\r\nsuffered heavy losses at a halt. There is always time to run to the\r\ndefense of artillery. To increase the moral effect advance your\r\nsupports in formation. Skirmishers can also be swiftly scattered among\r\nthe batteries. These skirmishers, in the midst of the guns will not\r\nhave to fear cavalry. Even if they are assailed by infantry it will\r\nnot be such a terrible thing. The engagement will merely be one\r\nbetween skirmishers, and they will be able to take cover behind the\r\npieces, firing against the enemy who is coming up in the open.\r\n\r\nGuibert, I believe, held that artillery should not worry whether it\r\nwas supported or not; that it should fire up to the last minute, and\r\nfinally abandon the pieces, which supporting troops might or might not\r\nrecapture. These supporting troops should not be too close. It is\r\neasier to defend pieces, to take them back even, by advancing on an\r\nenemy dispersed among them, than to defend them by standing fast after\r\nhaving participated in the losses suffered by the artillery under\r\nfire. (Note the English in Spain. The system of having artillery\r\nfollowed by infantry platoons is absurd.)\r\n\r\nArtillery in battle has its men grouped around the pieces, stationary\r\nassembly points, broadly distributed, each one having its commander\r\nand its cannoneers, who are always the same. Thus there is in effect a\r\nroll call each time artillery is put into battery. Artillery carries\r\nits men with it; they cannot be lost nor can they hide. If the officer\r\nis brave, his men rarely desert him. Certainly, in all armies, it is\r\nin the artillery that the soldier can best perform his duty.\r\n\r\nAs General Leboeuf tells us, four batteries of artillery can be\r\nmaneuvered, not more. That is all right. Here is the thing in a\r\nnut-shell. Four battalions is a big enough command for a colonel. A\r\ngeneral has eight battalions. He gets orders, \"General, do so and so.\"\r\nHe orders, \"Colonel, do so and so.\" So that without any maneuvers\r\nbeing laid down for more than four battalions, as many battalions as\r\nyou like can be maneuvered and drilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCOMMAND, GENERAL STAFF, AND ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of carefree generals, who are never worried nor\r\nharassed. They do not bother about anything. They say, \"I advance.\r\nFollow me.\" The result is an incredible disorder in the advance of\r\ncolumns. If ten raiders should fall on the column with a shout, this\r\ndisorder would become a rout, a disaster. But these gentlemen never\r\nbother with such an eventuality. They are the great men of the day,\r\nuntil the moment that some disaster overwhelms them.\r\n\r\nCavalry is no more difficult to work with than infantry. According to\r\nsome military authors, a cavalry general ought to have the wisdom of\r\nthe phoenix. The perfect one should have. So should the perfect\r\ninfantry general. Man on horseback and man afoot is always the same\r\nman. Only, the infantry general rarely has to account for the losses\r\nin his command, which may have been due to faulty or improper\r\nhandling. The cavalry general does have to do this. (We shall lay\r\naside the reasons why.) The infantry general has six chances for real\r\nbattle to one for the cavalry general. These are the two reasons why,\r\nfrom the beginning of a war, more initiative is found in infantry than\r\nin cavalry generals. General Bugeaud might have made a better cavalry\r\ngeneral than an infantry general. Why? Because he had immediate\r\ndecision and firm resolution. There is more need for resolution in the\r\ninfantryman than in the cavalryman. Why? There are many reasons, which\r\nare matters of opinion.\r\n\r\nIn short, the infantryman is always more tired than the cavalryman.\r\nHis morale is therefore harder to keep up. I believe therefore that a\r\ngood infantry general is rarer than one of cavalry. Also, the\r\nresolution of an infantry general does not have to last for a moment\r\nonly; it has to endure for a long, long time.\r\n\r\nGood artillery generals are common. They are less concerned with\r\nmorale than with other things, such as material results. They have\r\nless need to bother about the morale of their troops, as combat\r\ndiscipline is always better with them than with the other arms. This\r\nis shown elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBrigadier generals ought to be in their prescribed places. Very well,\r\nbut the most of them are not and never have been. They were required\r\nto be in place at the battle of Moscow, but, as they were so ordered\r\nthere, it is evident that they were not habitually in place. They are\r\nmen; and their rank, it seems to them, ought to diminish rather than\r\nincrease the risks they have to run. And, then, in actual engagement,\r\nwhere is their prescribed place?\r\n\r\nWhen one occupies a high command there are many things which he\r\ndoes not see. The general-in-chief, even a division commander, can\r\nonly escape this failing by great activity, moved by strict\r\nconscientiousness and aided by clairvoyance. This failing extends to\r\nthose about him, to his heads of services. These men live well, sleep\r\nwell; the same must be true of all! They have picked, well-conditioned\r\nhorses; the roads are excellent! They are never sick; the doctors must\r\nbe exaggerating sickness! They have attendants and doctors; everybody\r\nmust be well looked after! Something happens which shows abominable\r\nnegligence, common enough in war. With a good heart and a full belly\r\nthey say, \"But this is infamous, unheard of! It could not have\r\nhappened! It is impossible! etc.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day there is a tendency, whose cause should be sought, on the part\r\nof superiors to infringe on the authority of inferiors. This is\r\ngeneral. It goes very high and is furthered by the mania for command,\r\ninherent in the French character. It results in lessening the\r\nauthority of subordinate officers in the minds of their soldiers. This\r\nis a grave matter, as only the firm authority and prestige of\r\nsubordinate officers can maintain discipline. The tendency is to\r\noppress subordinates; to want to impose on them, in all things, the\r\nviews of the superior; not to admit of honest mistakes, and to reprove\r\nthem as faults; to make everybody, even down to the private, feel that\r\nthere is only one infallible authority. A colonel, for instance, sets\r\nhimself up as the sole authority with judgment and intelligence. He\r\nthus takes all initiative from subordinate officers, and reduces them\r\nto a state of inertia, coming from their lack of confidence in\r\nthemselves and from fear of being severely reproved. How many\r\ngenerals, before a regiment, think only of showing how much they know!\r\nThey lessen the authority of the colonel. That is nothing to them.\r\nThey have asserted their superiority, true or false; that is the\r\nessential. With cheeks puffed out, they leave, proud of having\r\nattacked discipline.\r\n\r\nThis firm hand which directs so many things is absent for a moment.\r\nAll subordinate officers up to this moment have been held with too\r\nstrong a hand, which has kept them in a position not natural to them.\r\nImmediately they are like a horse, always kept on a tight rein, whose\r\nrein is loosened or missing. They cannot in an instant recover that\r\nconfidence in themselves, that has been painstakingly taken away from\r\nthem without their wishing it. Thus, in such a moment conditions\r\nbecome unsatisfactory, the soldier very quickly feels that the hand\r\nthat holds him vacillates.\r\n\r\n\"Ask much, in order to obtain a little,\" is a false saying, a source\r\nof errors, an attack on discipline. One ought to obtain what one asks.\r\nIt is only necessary to be moderately reasonable and practical.\r\n\r\nIn following out this matter, one is astonished at the lack of\r\nforesight found in three out of four officers. Why? Is there anything\r\nso difficult about looking forward a little? Are three-quarters of the\r\nofficers so stupid? No! It is because their egoism, generally frankly\r\nacknowledged, allow them to think only of who is looking at them. They\r\nthink of their troops by chance perhaps, or because they have to.\r\nTheir troops are never their preoccupation, consequently they do not\r\nthink about them at all. A major in command of an organization in\r\nMexico, on his first march in a hot country, started without full\r\ncanteens, perhaps without canteens at all, without any provision for\r\nwater, as he might march in France. No officer in his battalion called\r\nhis attention to the omission, nor was more foresighted than he. In\r\nthis first march, by an entire lack of foresight in everything, he\r\nlost, in dead, half of his command. Was he reduced? No! He was made a\r\nlieutenant-colonel.\r\n\r\nOfficers of the general staff learn to order, not to command. \"Sir, I\r\norder,\" a popular phrase, applies to them.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune is not that there is a general staff, but that it has\r\nachieved command. For it always has commanded, in the name of its\r\ncommanders it is true, and never obeyed, which is its duty. It\r\ncommands in fact. So be it! But just the same it is not supposed to.\r\n\r\nIs it the good quality of staffs or that of combatants that makes the\r\nstrength of armies? If you want good fighting men, do everything to\r\nexcite their ambition, to spare them, so that people of intelligence\r\nand with a future will not despise the line but will elect to serve in\r\nit. It is the line that gives you your high command, the line only,\r\nand very rarely the staff. The staff, however, dies infrequently,\r\nwhich is something. Do they say that military science can only be\r\nlearned in the general staff schools? If you really want to learn to\r\ndo your work, go to the line.\r\n\r\nTo-day, nobody knows anything unless he knows how to argue and\r\nchatter. A peasant knows nothing, he is a being unskilled even in\r\ncultivating the soil. But the agriculturist of the office is a farmer\r\nemeritus, etc. Is it then believed that there is ability only in the\r\ngeneral staff? There is the assurance of the scholar there, of the\r\npedagogue who has never practiced what he preaches. There is book\r\nlearning, false learning when it treats of military matters. But\r\nknowledge of the real trade of a soldier, knowledge of what is\r\npossible, knowledge of blows given and received, all these are\r\nconspicuously absent.\r\n\r\nSlowness of promotion in the general staff as compared to its rapidity\r\nin the line might make many men of intelligence, of head and heart,\r\npass the general staff by and enter the line to make their own way. To\r\nbe in the line would not then be a brevet of imbecility. But to-day\r\nwhen general staff officers rank the best of the line, the latter are\r\ndiscouraged and rather than submit to this situation, all who feel\r\nthemselves fitted for advancement want to be on the general staff. So\r\nmuch the better? So much the worse. Selection is only warranted by\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nHow administrative deceits, in politics or elsewhere, falsify the\r\nconclusions drawn from a fact!\r\n\r\nIn the Crimea one hundred per cent. of the French operated upon\r\nsuccumbed, while only twenty-seven per cent. of the English operated\r\nupon died. That was attributed to the difference in temperament! The\r\ngreat cause of this discrepancy was the difference in care. Our\r\nnewspapers followed the self-satisfied and rosy statements given out\r\nby our own supply department. They pictured our sick in the Crimea\r\nlying in beds and cared for by sisters of charity. The fact is that\r\nour soldiers never had sheets, nor mattresses, nor the necessary\r\nchanges of clothes in the hospitals; that half, three-quarters, lay on\r\nmouldy straw, on the ground, under canvass. The fact is, that such\r\nwere the conditions under which typhus claimed twenty-five to thirty\r\nthousand of our sick after the siege; that thousands of pieces of\r\nhospital equipment were offered by the English to our Quartermaster\r\nGeneral, and that he refused them! Everybody ought to have known that\r\nhe would! To accept such equipment was to acknowledge that he did not\r\nhave it. And he ought to have had it. Indeed he did according to the\r\nnewspapers and the Quartermaster reports. There were twenty-five beds\r\nper hospital so that it could be said, \"We have beds!\" Each hospital\r\nhad at this time five hundred or more sick.\r\n\r\nThese people are annoyed if they are called hypocrites. While our\r\nsoldiers were in hospitals, without anything, so to speak, the English\r\nhad big, well-ventilated tents, cots, sheets, even night stands with\r\nurinals. And our men had not even a cup to drink from! Sick men were\r\ncared for in the English hospitals. They might have been in ours,\r\nbefore they died, which they almost always did.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we had the typhus and the English had not. That was\r\nbecause our men in tents had the same care as in our hospitals, and\r\nthe English the same care as in their hospitals.\r\n\r\nRead the war reports of supply departments and then go unexpectedly to\r\nverify them in the hospitals and storehouses. Have them verified by\r\ncalling up and questioning the heads of departments, but question them\r\nconscientiously, without dictating the answers. In the Crimea, in May\r\nof the first year, we were no better off than the English who\r\ncomplained so much, Who has dared to say, however, that from the time\r\nthey entered the hospital to the time that they left it, dead,\r\nevacuated, or cured, through fifteen or twenty days of cholera or\r\ntyphus, our men lay on the same plank, in the same shoes, drawers,\r\nshirts and clothing that they brought in with them? They were in a\r\nstate of living putrefaction that would by itself have killed well\r\nmen! The newspapers chanted the praises of the admirable French\r\nadministration. The second winter the English had no sick, a smaller\r\npercentage than in London. But to the eternal shame of the French\r\ncommand and administration we lost in peace time, twenty-five to\r\nthirty thousand of typhus and more than one thousand frozen to death.\r\nNevertheless, it appeared that we had the most perfect administration\r\nin the world, and that our generals, no less than our administration,\r\nwere full of devoted solicitude to provide all the needs of the\r\nsoldier. That is an infamous lie, and is known as such, let us hope.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have given us a good example. The good citizens have\r\ngone themselves to see how their soldiers were treated and have\r\nprovided for them themselves. When, in France, will good citizens lose\r\nfaith in this best of administrations which is theirs? When will they,\r\nconfident in themselves, do spontaneously, freely, what their\r\nadministration cannot and never will be able to do?\r\n\r\nThe first thing disorganized in an army is the administration. The\r\nsimplest foresight, the least signs even of order disappear in a\r\nretreat. (Note Russia-Vilna).\r\n\r\nIn the Crimea, and everywhere more or less, the doctor's visit was\r\nwithout benefit to the patient. It was made to keep up his spirits,\r\nbut could not be followed by care, due to lack of personnel and\r\nmaterial. After two or three hours of work, the doctor was exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn a sane country the field and permanent hospitals ought to be able\r\nto handle one-fifth of the strength at least. The hospital personnel\r\nof to-day should be doubled. It is quickly cut down, and it ought to\r\nhave time, not only to visit the sick, but to care for them, feed\r\nthem, dose and dress them, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND MILITARY INSTITUTIONS.\r\nNATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan's admiration for the great spectacles of nature is the admiration\r\nfor force. In the mountains it is mass, a force, that impresses him,\r\nstrikes him, makes him admire. In the calm sea it is the mysterious\r\nand terrible force that he divines, that he feels in that enormous\r\nliquid mass; in the angry sea, force again. In the wind, in the storm,\r\nin the vast depth of the sky, it is still force that he admires.\r\n\r\nAll these things astounded man when he was young. He has become old,\r\nand he knows them. Astonishment has turned to admiration, but always\r\nit is the feeling of a formidable force which compels his admiration.\r\nThis explains his admiration for the warrior.\r\n\r\nThe warrior is the ideal of the primitive man, of the savage, of the\r\nbarbarian. The more people rise in moral civilization, the lower this\r\nideal falls. But with the masses everywhere the warrior still is and\r\nfor a long time will be the height of their ideals. This is because\r\nman loves to admire the force and bravery that are his own attributes.\r\nWhen that force and bravery find other means to assert themselves, or\r\nat least when the crowd is shown that war does not furnish the best\r\nexamples of them, that there are truer and more exalted examples, this\r\nideal will give way to a higher one.\r\n\r\nNations have an equal sovereignty based on their existence as states.\r\nThey recognize no superior jurisdiction and call on force to decide\r\ntheir differences. Force decides. Whether or not might was right, the\r\nweaker bows to necessity until a more successful effort can be made.\r\n(Prud'homme). It is easy to understand Gregory VII's ideas on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn peace, armies are playthings in the hands of princes. If the\r\nprinces do not know anything about them, which is usually the case,\r\nthey disorganize them. If they understand them, like the Prince of\r\nPrussia, they make their armies strong for war.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia and the Prussian nobility, threatened by\r\ndemocracy, have had to change the passion for equality in their people\r\ninto a passion for domination over foreign nations. This is easily\r\ndone, when domination is crowned with success, for man, who is merely\r\nthe friend of equality is the lover of domination. So that he is\r\neasily made to take the shadow for the substance. They have succeeded.\r\nThey are forced to continue with their system. Otherwise their status\r\nas useful members of society would be questioned and they would perish\r\nas leaders in war. Peace spells death to a nobility. Consequently\r\nnobles do not desire it, and stir up rivalries among peoples,\r\nrivalries which alone can justify their existence as leaders in war,\r\nand consequently as leaders in peace. This is why the military spirit\r\nis dead in France. The past does not live again. In the spiritual as\r\nin the physical world, what is dead is dead. Death comes only with the\r\nexhaustion of the elements, the conditions which are necessary for\r\nlife. For these reasons revolutionary wars continued into the war with\r\nPrussia. For these reasons if we had been victorious we would have\r\nfound against us the countries dominated by nobilities, Austria,\r\nRussia, England. But with us vanquished, democracy takes up her work\r\nin all European countries, protected in the security which victory\r\nalways gives to victors. This work is slower but surer than the rapid\r\nwork of war, which, exalting rivalries, halts for a moment the work of\r\ndemocracy within the nations themselves. Democracy then takes up her\r\nwork with less chance of being deterred by rivalry against us. Thus we\r\nare closer to the triumph of democracy than if we had been victors.\r\nFrench democracy rightfully desires to live, and she does not desire\r\nto do so at the expense of a sacrifice of national pride. Then, since\r\nshe will still be surrounded for a long time by societies dominated by\r\nthe military element, by the nobility, she must have a dependable\r\narmy. And, as the military spirit is on the wane in France, it must be\r\nreplaced by having noncommissioned officers and officers well paid.\r\nGood pay establishes position in a democracy, and to-day none turn to\r\nthe army, because it is too poorly paid. Let us have well paid\r\nmercenaries. By giving good pay, good material can be secured, thanks\r\nto the old warrior strain in the race. This is the price that must be\r\npaid for security.\r\n\r\nThe soldier of our day is a merchant. So much of my flesh, of my\r\nblood, is worth so much. So much of my time, of my affections, etc. It\r\nis a noble trade, however, perhaps because man's blood is noble\r\nmerchandise, the finest that can be dealt in.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot says \"Get rich!\" That may seem cynical to prudes, but it is\r\ntruly said. Those who deny the sentiment, and talk to-day so loftily,\r\nwhat do they advise? If not by words, then by example they counsel the\r\nsame thing; and example is more contagious. Is not private wealth,\r\nwealth in general, the avowed ambition sought by all, democrats and\r\nothers? Let us be rich, that is to say, let us be slaves of the needs\r\nthat wealth creates.\r\n\r\nThe Invalides in France, the institutions for pensioners, are superb\r\nexhibits of pomp and ostentation. I wish that their founding had been\r\nbased on ideas of justice and Christianity and not purely on\r\nmilitary-political considerations. But the results are disastrous to\r\nmorality. This collection of weaklings is a school of depravity, where\r\nthe invalided soldier loses in vice his right to respect.\r\n\r\nSome officers want to transform regiments into permanent schools for\r\nofficers of all ranks, with a two-hour course each day in law,\r\nmilitary art, etc. There is little taste for military life in France;\r\nsuch a procedure would lessen it. The leisure of army life attracts\r\nthree out of four officers, laziness, if you like. But such is the\r\nfact. If you make an officer a school-boy all his life he will send\r\nhis profession to the devil, if he can. And those who are able to do\r\nso, will in general be those who have received the best education. An\r\narmy is an extraordinary thing, but since it is necessary, there\r\nshould be no astonishment that extraordinary means must be taken to\r\nkeep it up; such as offering in peace time little work and a great\r\ndeal of leisure. An officer is a sort of aristocrat, and in France we\r\nhave no finer ideal of aristocratic life than one of leisure. This is\r\nnot a proof of the highest ideals, nor of firmness of character. But\r\nwhat is to be done about it?\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that military spirit is lacking in our nation (and\r\nofficers are with greater difficulty than ever recruited in France) it\r\ndoes not follow that we shall not have to engage in war. Perhaps the\r\ncontrary is true.\r\n\r\nIt is not patriotic to say that the military spirit is dead in France?\r\nThe truth is always patriotic. The military spirit died with the\r\nFrench nobility, perished because it had to perish, because it was\r\nexhausted, at the end of its life. That only dies which has no longer\r\nthe sap of life, and can no longer live. If a thing is merely sick it\r\ncan return to health. But who can say that of the French nobility? An\r\naristocracy, a nobility that dies, dies always by its own fault;\r\nbecause it no longer performs its duties; because it fails in its\r\ntask; because its functions are of no more value to the state; because\r\nthere is no longer any reason for its existence in a society, whose\r\nfinal tendency is to suppress its functions.\r\n\r\nAfter 1789 had threatened our patriotism, the natural desire for\r\nself-protection revived the military spirit in the nation and in the\r\narmy. The Empire developed this movement, changed the defensive\r\nmilitary spirit to the offensive, and used it with increasing effect\r\nup to 1814 or 1815. The military spirit of the July Restoration was a\r\nreminiscence, a relic of the Empire, a form of opposition to\r\ngovernment by liberalism instead of democracy. It was really the\r\nspirit of opposition and not the military spirit, which is essentially\r\nconservative.\r\n\r\nThere is no military spirit in a democratic society, where there is no\r\naristocracy, no military nobility. A democratic society is\r\nantagonistic to the military spirit.\r\n\r\nThe military spirit was unknown to the Romans. They made no\r\ndistinction between military and civil duties. I think that the\r\nmilitary air dates from the time that the profession of arms became a\r\nprivate profession, from the time of the bravos, the Italian\r\ncondottieri, who were more terrifying to civilians than to the enemy.\r\nWhen the Romans said \"cedant arma togae,\" they did not refer to civil\r\nofficials and soldiers; the civil officials were then soldiers in\r\ntheir turn; professional soldiers did not exist. They meant \"might\r\ngives way to right.\"\r\n\r\nMachiavelli quotes a proverb, \"War makes thieves and peace has them\r\nhanged\" The Spaniards in Mexico, which has been in rebellion for forty\r\nyears, are more or less thieves. They want to continue to ply the\r\ntrade. Civil authority exists no longer with them, and they would look\r\non obedience to such an authority as shameful. It is easy to\r\nunderstand the difficulty of organizing a peaceful government in such\r\na country. Half the population would have to hang the other half. The\r\nother half does not want to be hanged.\r\n\r\nWe are a democratic society; we become less and less military. The\r\nPrussian, Russian, Austrian aristocracies which alone make the\r\nmilitary spirit of those states, feel in our democratic society an\r\nexample which threatens their existence, as nobility, as aristocracy.\r\nThey are our enemies and will be until they are wiped, out, until the\r\nRussian, Austrian and Prussian states become democratic societies,\r\nlike ours. It is a matter of time.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian aristocracy is young. It has not been degenerated by\r\nwealth, luxury and servility of the court. The Prussian court is not a\r\ncourt in the luxurious sense of the word. There is the danger.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Machiavellian doctrines not being forbidden to\r\naristocracies, these people appeal to German Jingoism, to German\r\npatriotism, to all the passions which move one people who are jealous\r\nof another. All this is meant to hide under a patriotic exterior their\r\nconcern for their own existence as an aristocracy, as a nobility.\r\n\r\nThe real menace of the day is czarism, stronger than the czars\r\nthemselves, which calls for a crusade to drive back Russia and the\r\nuncultured Slav race.\r\n\r\nIt is time that we understood the lack of power in mob armies; that we\r\nrecall to mind the first armies of the revolution that were saved from\r\ninstant destruction only by the lack of vigor and decision in European\r\ncabinets and armies. Look at the examples of revolutionaries of all\r\ntimes, who have all to gain and cannot hope for mercy. Since\r\nSpartacus, have they not always been defeated? An army is not really\r\nstrong unless it is developed from a social institution. Spartacus and\r\nhis men were certainly terrible individual fighters. They were\r\ngladiators used to struggle and death. They were prisoners, barbarian\r\nslaves enraged by their loss of liberty, or escaped serfs, all men who\r\ncould not hope for mercy. What more terrible fighters could be\r\nimagined? But discipline, leadership, all was improvised and could not\r\nhave the firm discipline coming down from the centuries and drawn from\r\nthe social institutions of the Romans. They were conquered. Time, a\r\nlong time, is needed to give to leaders the habit of command and\r\nconfidence in their authority--to the soldiers confidence in their\r\nleaders and in their fellows. It is not enough to order discipline.\r\nThe officers must have the will to enforce it, and its vigorous\r\nenforcement must instill subordination in the soldiers. It must make\r\nthem fear it more than they fear the enemy's blows.\r\n\r\nHow did Montluc fight, in an aristocratic society? Montluc shows us,\r\ntells us. He advanced in the van of the assault, but in bad places he\r\npushed in front of him a soldier whose skin was not worth as much as\r\nwas his. He had not the slightest doubt or shame about doing this. The\r\nsoldier did not protest, the propriety of the act was so well\r\nestablished. But you, officers, try that in a democratic army, such as\r\nwe have commenced to have, such as we shall later have!\r\n\r\nIn danger the officer is no better than the soldier. The soldier is\r\nwilling enough to advance, but behind his officer. Also, his comrades'\r\nskin is no more precious than is his, they must advance too. This very\r\nreal concern about equality in danger, which seeks equality only,\r\nbrings on hesitation and not resolution. Some fools may break their\r\nheads in closing in, but the remainder will fire from a distance. Not\r\nthat this will cause fewer losses, far from it.\r\n\r\nItaly will never have a really firm army. The Italians are too\r\ncivilized, too fine, too democratic in a certain sense of the word.\r\nThe Spaniards are the same. This may cause laughter, but it is true.\r\nThe French are indeed worthy sons of their fathers, the Gauls. War,\r\nthe most solemn act in the life of a nation, the gravest of acts, is a\r\nlight thing to them. The good Frenchman lets himself be carried away,\r\ninflamed by the most ridiculous feats of arms into the wildest\r\nenthusiasm. Moreover he interprets the word \"honor\" in a fashion all\r\nhis own. An expedition is commenced without sufficient reason, and\r\ngood Frenchmen, who do not know why the thing is done, disapprove. But\r\npresently blood is spilled. Good sense and justice dictate that this\r\nspilled blood should taint those responsible for an unjust enterprise.\r\nBut jingoism says \"French blood has been spilled: Honor is at stake!\"\r\nAnd millions of gold, which is the unit of labor, millions of men, are\r\nsacrificed to a ridiculous high-sounding phrase.\r\n\r\nWhence comes this tendency toward war which characterizes above all\r\nthe good citizen, the populace, who are not called upon personally to\r\nparticipate? The military man is not so easily swayed. Some hope for\r\npromotion or pension, but even they are sobered by their sense of\r\nduty. It comes from the romance that clothes war and battle, and that\r\nhas with us ten times more than elsewhere, the power of exciting\r\nenthusiasm in the people. It would be a service to humanity and to\r\none's people to dispell this illusion, and to show what battles are.\r\nThey are buffooneries, and none the less buffooneries because they are\r\nmade terrible by the spilling of blood. The actors, heroes in the eyes\r\nof the crowd, are only poor folk torn between fear, discipline and\r\npride. They play some hours at a game of advance and retreat, without\r\never meeting, closing with, even seeing closely, the other poor folks,\r\nthe enemy, who are as fearful as they but who are caught in the same\r\nweb of circumstance.\r\n\r\nWhat should be considered is how to organize an army in a country in\r\nwhich there is at the same time national and provincial feeling. Such\r\na country is France, where there is no longer any necessity for\r\nuniting national and provincial feeling by mixing up the soldiers. In\r\nFrance, will the powerful motif of pride, which comes from the\r\norganization of units from particular provinces, be useful? From the\r\nfusion of varying elements comes the character of our troops, which is\r\nsomething to be considered. The make-up of the heavy cavalry should be\r\nnoted. It has perhaps too many Germans and men from the northern\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nFrench sociability creates cohesion in French troops more quickly than\r\ncould be secured in troops in other nations. Organization and\r\ndiscipline have the same purpose. With a proud people like the French,\r\na rational organization aided by French sociability can often secure\r\ndesired results without it being necessary to use the coercion of\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nMarshal de Gouvion-Saint Cyr said, \"Experienced soldiers know and\r\nothers ought to know that French soldiers once committed to the\r\npursuit of the enemy will not return to their organization that day\r\nuntil forced back into it by the enemy. During this time they must be\r\nconsidered as lost to the rest of the army.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Empire, officers, trained in the wars of the\r\nRevolution by incessant fighting, possessed great firmness. No one\r\nwould wish to purchase such firmness again at the same price. But in\r\nour modern wars the victor often loses more than the vanquished, apart\r\nfrom the temporary loss in prisoners. The losses exceed the resources\r\nin good men, and discourage the exhausted, who appear to be very\r\nnumerous, and those who are skilled in removing themselves from\r\ndanger. Thus we fall into disorder. The Duke of Fezensac, testifying\r\nof other times, shows us the same thing that happens to-day. Also\r\nto-day we depend only on mass action, and at that game, despite the\r\ncleverest strategic handling, we must lose all, and do.\r\n\r\nFrench officers lack firmness but have pride. In the face of danger\r\nthey lack composure, they are disconcerted, breathless, hesitant,\r\nforgetful, unable to think of a way out. They call, \"Forward,\r\nforward.\" This is one of the reasons why handling a formation in line\r\nis difficult, especially since the African campaigns where much is\r\nleft to the soldier.\r\n\r\nThe formation in rank is then an ideal, unobtainable in modern war,\r\nbut toward which we should strive. But we are getting further away\r\nfrom it. And then, when habit loses its hold, natural instinct resumes\r\nits empire. The remedy lies in an organization which will establish\r\ncohesion by the mutual acquaintanceship of all. This will make\r\npossible mutual surveillance, which has such power over French pride.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that there are two kinds of war, that in open\r\ncountry, and in the plain, and that of posts garrisoning positions in\r\nbroken country. In a great war, with no one occupying positions, we\r\nshould be lost immediately. Marshal Saxe knew us well when he said\r\nthat the French were best for a war of position. He recognized the\r\nlack of stability in the ranks.\r\n\r\nOn getting within rifle range the rank formation tends to disappear.\r\nYou hear officers who have been under fire say \"When you get near the\r\nenemy, the men deploy as skirmishers despite you. The Russians group\r\nunder fire. Their holding together is the huddling of sheep moved by\r\nfear of discipline and of danger.\" There are then two modes of conduct\r\nunder fire, the French and the Russian.\r\n\r\nThe Gauls, seeing the firmness of the Roman formation, chained\r\nthemselves together, making the first rank unbreakable and tying\r\nliving to dead. This forbade the virtue they had not divined in the\r\nRoman formation, the replacement of wounded and exhausted by fresh\r\nmen. From this replacement came the firmness which seemed so striking\r\nto the Gauls. The rank continually renewed itself.\r\n\r\nWhy does the Frenchman of to-day, in singular contrast to the Gaul,\r\nscatter under fire? His natural intelligence, his instinct under the\r\npressure of danger causes him to deploy.\r\n\r\nHis method must be adopted. In view of the impossibility to-day of the\r\nRoman Draconian discipline which put the fear of death behind the\r\nsoldier, we must adopt the soldier's method and try to put some order\r\ninto it. How? By French discipline and an organization that permits of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBroken, covered country is adapted to our methods. The Zouaves at\r\nMagenta could not have done so well on another kind of ground. [46]\r\n\r\nAbove all, with modern weapons, the terrain to be advanced over must\r\nbe limited in depth.\r\n\r\nHow much better modern tactics fit the impatient French character! But\r\nalso how necessary it is to guard against this impatience and to keep\r\nsupports and reserves under control.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that German or Gallic cavalry was always better\r\nthan Roman cavalry, which could not hold against it, even though\r\ncertainly better armed. Why was this? Because decision, impetuosity,\r\neven blind courage, have more chance with cavalry than with infantry.\r\nThe defeated cavalry is the least brave cavalry. (A note for our\r\ncavalry here!) It was easier for the Gauls to have good cavalry than\r\nit is for us, as fire did not bother them in the charge.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman has more qualities of the cavalryman than of the\r\ninfantryman. Yet French infantry appears to be of greater value. Why?\r\nBecause the use of cavalry on the battlefield requires rare decision\r\nand the seizing of the crucial opportunity. If the cavalryman has not\r\nbeen able to show his worth, it is the fault of his leaders. French\r\ninfantry has always been defeated by English infantry. In cavalry\r\ncombat the English cavalry has always fled before the French in those\r\nterrible cavalry battles that are always flights. Is this because in\r\nwar man lasts longer in the cavalry and because our cavalrymen were\r\nolder and more seasoned soldiers than our infantry? This does not\r\napply to us only. If it is true for our cavalrymen, it is also true\r\nfor the English cavalrymen. The reason is that on the field of battle\r\nthe role of the infantryman against a firm adversary requires more\r\ncoolness and nerve than does the role of the cavalryman. It requires\r\nthe use of tactics based on an understanding of the national\r\ncharacteristics of ourselves and of our enemies. Against the English\r\nthe confidence in the charge that is implanted in our brains, was\r\ncompletely betrayed. The role of cavalry against cavalry is simpler.\r\nThe French confidence in the charge makes good fighting cavalry, and\r\nthe Frenchman is better fitted than any other for this role. Our\r\ncavalry charge better than any other. That is the whole thing, on the\r\nbattle field it is understood. As they move faster than infantry,\r\ntheir dash, which has its limits, is better preserved when they get up\r\nto the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe English have always fled before our cavalry. This proves that,\r\nstrong enough to hold before the moral impulse of our infantry, they\r\nwere not strong enough to hold before the stronger impulse of cavalry.\r\n\r\nWe ought to be much better cavalrymen than infantrymen, because the\r\nessential in a cavalryman is a fearless impetuosity. That is for the\r\nsoldier. The cavalry leader ought to use this trait without\r\nhesitation, at the same time taking measures to support it and to\r\nguard against its failings. The attack is always, even on the\r\ndefensive, an evidence of resolution, and gives a moral ascendancy.\r\nIts effect is more immediate with cavalry, because the movements of\r\ncavalry are more rapid and the moral effect has less time to be\r\nmodified by reflection. To insure that the French cavalry be the best\r\nin Europe, and a really good cavalry, it needs but one thing, to\r\nconform to the national temperament, to dare, to dare, and to advance.\r\n\r\nOne of the singular features of French discipline is that on the road,\r\nespecially in campaign the methods of punishment for derelictions\r\nbecome illusory, impractical. In 1859 there were twenty-five thousand\r\nskulkers in the Army in Italy. The soldier sees this immediately and\r\nlack of discipline ensues. If our customs do not permit of Draconian\r\ndiscipline, let us replace that moral coercion by another. Let us\r\ninsure cohesion by the mutual acquaintanceship of men and officers;\r\nlet us call French sociability to our aid.\r\n\r\nWith the Romans discipline was severest and most rigidly enforced in\r\nthe presence of the enemy. It was enforced by the soldiers themselves.\r\nTo-day, why should not the men in our companies watch discipline and\r\npunish themselves. They alone know each other, and the maintenance of\r\ndiscipline is so much to their interest as to encourage them to stop\r\nskulking. The twenty-five thousand men who skulked in Italy, all wear\r\nthe Italian medal. They were discharged with certificates of good\r\nconduct. This certificate, in campaign should be awarded by the squad\r\nonly. In place of that, discipline must be obtained somehow, and it is\r\nplaced as an additional burden on the officer. He above all has to\r\nuphold it. He is treated without regard for his dignity. He is made to\r\ndo the work of the non-commissioned officer. He is used as fancy\r\ndictates.\r\n\r\nThis cohesion which we hope for in units from squad to company, need\r\nnot be feared in other armies. It cannot develop to the same point and\r\nby the same methods with them as with us. Their make-up is not ours,\r\ntheir character is different. This individuality of squads and\r\ncompanies comes from the make-up of our army and from French\r\nsociability.\r\n\r\nIs it true that the rations of men and horses are actually\r\ninsufficient in campaign? This is strange economy! To neglect to\r\nincrease the soldier's pay five centimes! It would better his fare and\r\nprevent making of an officer a trader in vegetables in order to\r\nproperly feed his men. Yet millions are squandered each year for\r\nuniforms, geegaws, shakos, etc!\r\n\r\nIf a big army is needed, it ought to cost as little as possible.\r\nSimplicity in all things! Down with all sorts of plumes! Less\r\namateurs! If superfluous trimmings are not cut down it will be\r\nunfortunate! What is the matter with the sailor's uniform?\r\nInsignificant and annoying details abound while vital details of\r\nproper footgear and instruction, are neglected. The question of\r\nclothing for campaign is solved by adopting smocks and greatcoats and\r\nby doing away with headquarters companies! This is the height of\r\nfolly. I suppose it is because our present uniforms need specialists\r\nto keep them in condition, and smocks and greatcoats do not!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM ON INFANTRY FIRE\r\n[Written in 1869 (Editor's note)]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the history of the development of infantry fire is\r\nnone too plain, even though fire action to-day, in Europe, is almost\r\nthe sole means of destruction used by that arm.\r\n\r\nNapoleon said, \"The only method of fire to be used in war is fire at\r\nwill.\" Yet after such a plain statement by one who knew, there is a\r\ntendency to-day to make fire at command the basis of infantry battle\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\nIs this correct? Experience only can determine. Experience is gained;\r\nbut nothing, especially in the trade of war, is sooner forgotten than\r\nexperience. So many fine things can be done, beautiful maneuvers\r\nexecuted, ingenious combat methods invented in the confines of an\r\noffice or on the maneuver ground. Nevertheless let us try to hold to\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nLet us consider, in the study of any kind of fire, a succinct history\r\nof small arms; let us see what kind of fire is used with each weapon,\r\nattempting at the same time to separate that which has actually\r\nhappened from the written account.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Succinct History of the Development of Small Arms, from the\r\nArquebus to Our Rifle\r\n\r\nThe arquebus in use before the invention of powder gave the general\r\ndesign to fire arms. The arquebus marks then the transition from the\r\nmechanically thrown missile to the bullet.\r\n\r\nThe tube was kept to direct the projectile, and the bow and string\r\nwere replaced by a powder chamber and ignition apparatus.\r\n\r\nThis made a weapon, very simple, light and easy to charge; but the\r\nsmall caliber ball thrown from a very short barrel, gave penetration\r\nonly at short distances.\r\n\r\nThe barrel was lengthened, the caliber increased, and a more\r\nefficient, but a less convenient arm resulted. It was indeed\r\nimpossible to hold the weapon in aiming position and withstand the\r\nrecoil at the moment of firing.\r\n\r\nTo lessen recoil there was attached to the bottom of the barrel a hook\r\nto catch on a fixed object at the moment of discharge. This was called\r\na hook arquebus.\r\n\r\nBut the hook could only be used under certain circumstances. To give\r\nthe arm a point of support on the body, the stock was lengthened and\r\ninclined to permit sighting. This was the petrinal or poitrinal. The\r\nsoldier had in addition a forked support for the barrel.\r\n\r\nIn the musket, which followed, the stock was again modified and held\r\nagainst the shoulder. Further the firing mechanism was improved.\r\n\r\nThe arm had been fired by a lighted match; but with the musket, the\r\narm becoming lighter and more portable, there came the serpentine\r\nlock, the match-lock, then the wheel-lock, finally the Spanish lock\r\nand the flint-lock.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the flint-lock and the bayonet produced the rifle,\r\nwhich Napoleon regarded as the most powerful weapon that man\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nBut the rifle in its primitive state had defects. Loading was slow; it\r\nwas inaccurate, and under some circumstances it could not be fired.\r\n\r\nHow were these defects remedied?\r\n\r\nAs to the loading weakness, Gustavus Adolphus, understanding the\r\ninfluence on morale of rapid loading and the greater destruction\r\ncaused by the more rapid fire, invented the cartridge for muskets.\r\nFrederick, or some one of his time, the name marks the period, replaced\r\nwooden by cylindrical iron ramrods. To prime more quickly a conical\r\nfunnel allowed the powder to pass from the barrel into the firing-pan.\r\nThese two last improvements saved time in two ways, in priming and in\r\nloading. But it was the adoption of the breech-loader that brought the\r\ngreatest increase in rapidity of fire.\r\n\r\nThese successive improvements of the weapon, all tending to increase\r\nthe rapidity of fire, mark the most remarkable military periods of\r\nmodern times:\r\n\r\n   cartridges--Gustavus Adolphus\r\n   iron ramrod--Frederick\r\n   improved vent (adopted by the soldiers if not prescribed by\r\n     competent orders)--wars of the Republic and of the Empire\r\n   breech-loading--Sadowa.\r\n\r\nAccuracy was sacrificed to rapidity of fire. This will be explained\r\nlater. Only in our day has the general use of rifling and of elongated\r\nprojectiles brought accuracy to the highest point. In our times, also,\r\nthe use of fulminate has assured fire under all conditions.\r\n\r\nWe have noted briefly the successive improvements in fire arms, from\r\nthe arquebus to the rifle.\r\n\r\nHave the methods of employment made the same progress?\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Progressive Introduction of Fire-Arms Into the Armament of the\r\nInfantryman\r\n\r\nThe revolution brought about by powder, not in the art of war but in\r\nthat of combat, came gradually. It developed along with the\r\nimprovement of fire arms. Those arms gradually became those of the\r\ninfantryman.\r\n\r\nThus, under Francis I, the proportion of infantrymen carrying fire\r\narms to those armed with pikes was one to three or four.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the wars of religion arquebusiers and pikemen were\r\nabout equal in number.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIII, in 1643, there were two fire-arms to one pike; in\r\nthe war of 1688, four to one; finally pikes disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt first men with fire-arms were independent of other combatants, and\r\nfunctioned like light troops in earlier days.\r\n\r\nLater the pikes and the muskets were united in constituent elements of\r\narmy corps.\r\n\r\nThe most usual formation was pikes in the center, muskets on the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nSometimes the pikemen were in the center of their respective\r\ncompanies, which were abreast.\r\n\r\nOr, half the musketeers might be in front of the pikemen, half behind.\r\nOr again, all the musketeers might be behind the kneeling pikemen. In\r\nthese last two cases fire covered the whole front.\r\n\r\nFinally pike and musket might alternate.\r\n\r\nThese combinations are found in treatises on tactics. But we do not\r\nknow, by actual examples, how they worked in battle, nor even whether\r\nall were actually employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Classes of Fire Employed With Each Weapon\r\n\r\nWhen originally some of the infantry were armed with the long and\r\nheavy arquebus in its primitive state, the feebleness of their fire\r\ncaused Montaigne to say, certainly on military authority, \"The arms\r\nhave so little effect, except on the ears, that their use will be\r\ndiscontinued.\" Research is necessary to find any mention of their use\r\nin the battles of that period. [47]\r\n\r\nHowever we find a valuable piece of information in Brantome, writing\r\nof the battle of Pavia.\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis de Pescani won the battle of Pavia with Spanish\r\narquebusiers, in an irregular defiance of all regulation and tradition\r\nby employing a new formation. Fifteen hundred arquebusiers, the\r\nablest, the most experienced, the cleverest, above all the most agile\r\nand devoted, were selected by the Marquis de Pescani, instructed by\r\nhim on new lines, and practiced for a long time. They scattered by\r\nsquads over the battlefield, turning, leaping from one place to\r\nanother with great speed, and thus escaped the cavalry charge. By this\r\nnew method of fighting, unusual, astonishing, cruel and unworthy,\r\nthese arquebusiers greatly hampered the operations of the French\r\ncavalry, who were completely lost. For they, joined together and in\r\nmass, were brought to earth by these few brave and able arquebusiers.\r\nThis irregular and new method of fighting is more easily imagined than\r\ndescribed. Any one who can try it out will find it is good and useful;\r\nbut it is necessary that the arquebusiers be good troops, very much on\r\nthe jump (as the saying is) and above all reliable.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind, in noting the preceding, that there is\r\nalways a great difference between what actually occurred, and the\r\ndescription thereof (made often by men who were not there, and God\r\nknows on what authority). Nevertheless, there appears in these lines\r\nof Brantome a first example of the most destructive use of the rifle,\r\nin the hands of skirmishers.\r\n\r\nDuring the religious wars, which consisted of skirmishes and taking\r\nand retaking garrisoned posts, the fire of arquebusiers was executed\r\nwithout order and individually, as above.\r\n\r\nThe soldier carried the powder charges in little metal boxes hung from\r\na bandoleer. A finer, priming, powder was contained in a powder horn;\r\nthe balls were carried in a pouch. At the onset the soldier had to\r\nload his piece. It was thus that he had to fight with the match\r\narquebus. This was still far from fire at command.\r\n\r\nHowever this presently appeared. Gustavus Adolphus was the first who\r\ntried to introduce method and cooerdination into infantry fire. Others,\r\neager for innovations, followed in his path. There appeared\r\nsuccessively, fire by rank, in two ranks, by subdivision, section,\r\nplatoon, company, battalion, file fire, parapet fire, a formal fire at\r\nwill, and so many others that we can be sure that all combinations\r\nwere tried at this time.\r\n\r\nFire by ranks was undoubtedly the first of these; it will give us a\r\nline on the others.\r\n\r\nInfantry was formed six deep. To execute fire by rank all ranks except\r\nthe last knelt. The last rank fired and reloaded. The rank in front of\r\nit then rose and did the same thing, as did all other ranks\r\nsuccessively. The whole operation was then recommenced.\r\n\r\nThus the first group firing was executed successively by ranks.\r\n\r\nMontecuculli said, \"The musketeers are ranged six deep, so that the\r\nlast rank has reloaded by the time the first has fired, and takes up\r\nthe fire again, so that the enemy has to face continuous fire.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, under Conde and Turenne, we see the French army use only fire\r\nat will.\r\n\r\nIt is true that at this time fire was regarded only as an accessory.\r\nThe infantry of the line which, since the exploit of the Flemish, the\r\nSwiss and the Spaniards, had seen their influence grow daily, was\r\nrequired for the charge and the advance and consequently was armed\r\nwith pikes.\r\n\r\nIn the most celebrated battles of these times, Rocroi, Nordlingen,\r\nLens, Rethel and the Dunes, we see the infantry work in this way. The\r\ntwo armies, in straight lines, commenced by bombarding each other,\r\ncharged with their cavalry wings, and advanced with their infantry in\r\nthe center. The bravest or best disciplined infantry drove back the\r\nother, and often, if one of its wings was victorious, finished by\r\nrouting it. No marked influence of fire is found at this time. The\r\ntradition of Pescani was lost.\r\n\r\nNevertheless fire-arms improved; they became more effective and tended\r\nto replace the pike. The use of the pike obliged the soldier to remain\r\nin ranks, to fight only in certain cases, and exposed him to injury\r\nwithout being able to return blow for blow. And, this is exceedingly\r\ninstructive, the soldier had by this time an instinctive dislike of\r\nthis arm, which often condemned him to a passive role. This dislike\r\nnecessitated giving high pay and privilege to obtain pikemen. And in\r\nspite of all at the first chance the soldier threw away his pike for a\r\nmusket.\r\n\r\nThe pikes themselves gradually disappeared before firearms; the ranks\r\nthinned to permit the use of the latter. Four rank formation was used,\r\nand fire tried in that order, by rank, by two ranks, upright,\r\nkneeling, etc.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these attempts, we see the French army in combat, notably\r\nat Fontenoy, still using fire at will, the soldier leaving ranks to\r\nfire and returning to load.\r\n\r\nIt can be stated, in spite of numerous attempts at adoption, that no\r\nfire at command was used in battle up to the days of Frederick.\r\n\r\nAlready, under William, the Prussian infantry was noted for the\r\nrapidity and continuity of its fire. Frederick further increased the\r\nability of his battalions to fire by decreasing their depth. This\r\nfire, tripled by speed in loading, became so heavy that it gave\r\nPrussian battalions a superiority over others of three to one.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians recognized three kinds of fire, at a halt, in advancing,\r\nand in retreat. We know the mechanics of fire at a halt, the first\r\nrank kneeling. Of fire in advancing Guibert says: \"What I call\r\nmarching fire, and which anybody who thinks about it must find as ill\r\nadvised as I do, is a fire I have seen used by some troops. The\r\nsoldiers, in two ranks, fire in marching, but they march of course at\r\na snail's pace. This is what Prussian troops call fire in advancing.\r\nIt consists in combined and alternating volleys from platoons,\r\ncompanies, half battalions or battalions. The parts of the line which\r\nhave fired advance at the double, the others at the half step.\"\r\n\r\nIn other methods of fire, as we have said, the Prussian battalion was\r\nin three ranks; the first kneeling. The line delivered salvos, only at\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nHowever, the theory of executing fire by salvo in three ranks did not\r\nbother Frederick's old soldiers. We will see presently how they\r\nexecuted it on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, Europe was impressed with these methods and tended\r\nto adopt them. D'Argenson provided for them in the French army and\r\nintroduced fire at command. Two regulations prescribing this appeared,\r\nin 1753 and 1755. But in the war which followed, Marshal de Broglie,\r\nwho undoubtedly had experience and as much common sense as M.\r\nD'Argenson, prescribed fire at will. All infantry in his army was\r\npracticed in it during the winter of 1761-1762.\r\n\r\nTwo new regulations succeeded the preceding, in 1764 and 1776. The\r\nlast prescribed fire in three ranks at command, all ranks upright. [48]\r\n\r\nThus we come to the wars of the Revolution, with regulations calling\r\nfor fire at command, which was not executed in battle.\r\n\r\nSince these wars, our armies have always fought as skirmishers. In\r\nspeaking of our campaigns, fire at command is never mentioned. It was\r\nthe same under the Empire, in spite of numerous essays from the\r\nBoulogne school and elsewhere. At the Boulogne school, fire at command\r\nby ranks was first tried by order of Napoleon. This fire, to be\r\nparticularly employed against cavalry--in theory it is superb--does\r\nnot seem to have been employed Napoleon says so himself, and the\r\nregulations of 1832, in which some influence of soldiers of the Empire\r\nshould be found, orders fire in two ranks or at will, by bodies of\r\nmen, to the exclusion of all others.\r\n\r\nAccording to our military authority, on the authority of our old\r\nofficers, fire at command did not suit our infantry; yet it lived in\r\nthe regulations. General Fririon (1822) and de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr\r\n(1829) attacked this method. Nothing was done. It remained in the\r\nregulations of 1832, but without being ordered in any particular\r\ncircumstances. It appeared there for show purposes, perhaps.\r\n\r\nOn the creation of the chasseurs d'Orleans, fire by rank was revived.\r\nBut neither in our African campaigns nor in our last two wars in the\r\nCrimea and Italy can a single example of fire at command be found. In\r\npractice it was believed to be impracticable. It was known to be\r\nentirely ineffective and fell into disrepute.\r\n\r\nBut to-day, with the breech-loading rifle, there is a tendency to\r\nbelieve it practicable and to take it up with new interest. Is this\r\nmore reasonable than in the past? Let us see.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Methods of Fire Used in the Presence of the Enemy;\r\n     Methods Recommended or Ordered But Impractical.\r\n     Use and Efficacy of Fire at Command\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly at the Potsdam maneuvers the Prussian infantry used only\r\nsalvos executed admirably. An unbelievable discipline kept the soldier\r\nin place and in line. Barbaric punishments were incorporated in the\r\nmilitary code. Blows, the whip, executions, punished the slightest\r\nderelictions. Even N.C.O.'s were subjected to blows with the flat of\r\nthe sword. Yet all this was not enough on the field of battle; a\r\ncomplete rank of non-commissioned officer file closers was also needed\r\nto hold the men to their duty.\r\n\r\nM. Carion-Nisas said, \"These file-closers hook their halberds together\r\nand form a line that cannot be broken.\" In spite of all this, after\r\ntwo or three volleys, so says General Renard, whom we believe more\r\nthan charitable, there is no power of discipline which can prevent\r\nregular fire from breaking into fire at will.\r\n\r\nBut let us look further, into Frederick's battles. Let us take the\r\nbattle of Mollwitz, in which success was specifically laid to fire at\r\ncommand, half lost, then won by the Prussian salvos.\r\n\r\n\"The Austrian infantry had opened fire on the lines of the Prussians,\r\nwhose cavalry had been routed. It was necessary to shake them to\r\ninsure victory. The Austrians still used wooden ramrods. Their fire\r\ncame slowly, while the Prussian fire was thunderous, five or six shots\r\nto the rifle per minute. The Imperial troops, surprised and\r\ndisconcerted by this massed fire, tried to hurry. In their hurry many\r\nbroke their fragile ramrods. Confusion spread through the ranks, and\r\nthe battle was lost.\"\r\n\r\nBut, if we study actual conditions of the period, we see that things\r\ndid not happen in such an orderly sequence.\r\n\r\nFiring started, and it is said that it was long and deadly. The\r\nPrussians iron ramrods gave them the advantage 'over an enemy whose\r\nramrods were wooden, harder to manipulate and easily broken. However,\r\nwhen the order to advance was given to the Prussians, whole battalions\r\nstood fast; it was impossible to budge them. The soldiers tried to\r\nescape the fire and got behind each other, so that they were thirty to\r\nforty deep.\r\n\r\nHere are men who exhibit under fire an admirable, calm, an immovable\r\nsteadiness. Each instant they hear the dead heavy sound of a bullet\r\nstriking. They see, they feel, around them, above them, between their\r\nlegs, their comrades fall and writhe, for the fire is deadly. They\r\nhave the power in their hands to return blow for blow, to send back to\r\nthe enemy the death that hisses and strikes about them. They do not\r\ntake a false step; their hands do not close instinctively on the\r\ntrigger. They wait, imperturbably, the order of their chiefs--and what\r\nchiefs! These are the men who at the command \"forward,\" lack bowels,\r\nwho huddle like sheep one behind the other. Are we to believe this?\r\n\r\nLet us get to the truth of the matter. Frederick's veterans, in spite\r\nof their discipline and drill, are unable to follow the methods taught\r\nand ordered. They are no more able to execute fire at command than\r\nthey are to execute the ordered advance of the Potsdam maneuver field.\r\nThey use fire at will. They fire fast from instinct--stronger than\r\ntheir discipline--which bids them send two shots for one. Their fire\r\nbecomes indeed, a thunderous roll, not of salvos, but of rapid fire at\r\nwill. Who fires most, hits most, so the soldier figures. So indeed did\r\nFrederick, for he encouraged fire in this same battle of Mollwitz; he\r\nthereafter doubled the number of cartridges given the soldier, giving\r\nhim sixty instead of thirty.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if fire at command had been possible, who knows what\r\nFrederick's soldiers would have been capable of? They would have cut\r\ndown battalions like standing grain. Allowed to aim quietly, no man\r\ninterfering with another, each seeing clearly--then at the signal all\r\nfiring together. Could anything hold against them? At the first volley\r\nthe enemy would have broken and fled, under the penalty of\r\nannihilation in case they stayed. However, if we look at the final\r\nresult at Mollwitz, we see that the number of killed is about the same\r\non the side that used fire at command as on the side that did not. The\r\nPrussians lost 960 dead, the Austrians 966.\r\n\r\nBut they say that if fire was not more deadly, it was because\r\nsight-setting was then unknown. What if it was? There was no\r\nadjustment of fire perhaps, but there were firing regulations; aiming\r\nwas known. Aiming is old. We do not say it was practiced; but it was\r\nknown, and often mentioned. Cromwell often said, \"Put your confidence\r\nin God, my children, and fire at their shoe-laces.\"\r\n\r\nDo we set our sights better to-day? It is doubtful. If the able\r\nsoldiers of Cromwell, of Frederick, of the Republic and of Napoleon\r\ncould not set their sights--can we?\r\n\r\nThus this fire at command, which was only possible rarely and to\r\ncommence action, was entirely ineffective.\r\n\r\nHardy spirits, seeing the slight effect of long range firing in\r\nbattle, counselled waiting till the enemy was at twenty paces and\r\ndriving him back with a volley. You do not have to sight carefully at\r\ntwenty paces. What would be the result?\r\n\r\n\"At the battle of Castiglione,\" says Marshal Saxe, \"the Imperial\r\ntroops let the French approach to twenty paces, hoping to destroy them\r\nby a volley. At that distance they fired coolly and with all\r\nprecautions, but they were broken before the smoke cleared. At the\r\nbattle of Belgrade (1717) I saw two battalions who at thirty paces,\r\naimed and fired at a mass of Turks. The Turks cut them up, only two or\r\nthree escaping. The Turkish loss in dead was only thirty-two.\"\r\n\r\nNo matter what the Marshal says, we doubt that these men were cool.\r\nFor men who could hold their fire up to such a near approach of the\r\nenemy, and fire into masses, would have killed the front rank, thrown\r\nthe others into confusion, and would never have been cut up as they\r\nwere. To make these men await, without firing, an enemy at twenty or\r\nthirty paces, needed great moral pressure. Controlled by discipline\r\nthey waited, but as one waits for the roof to fall, for a bomb to\r\nexplode, full of anxiety and suppressed emotion. When the order is\r\ngiven to raise the arms and fire the crisis is reached. The roof\r\nfalls, the bomb explodes, one flinches and the bullets are fired into\r\nthe air. If anybody is killed it is an accident.\r\n\r\nThis is what happened before the use of skirmishers. Salvos were\r\ntried. In action they became fire at will. Directed against troops\r\nadvancing without firing they were ineffective. They did not halt the\r\ndash of the assault, and the troops who had so counted on them fled\r\ndemoralized. But when skirmishers were used, salvos became impossible.\r\nArmies who held to old methods learned this to their cost.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of the Revolution our troops, undrilled and not\r\nstrictly disciplined, could not fight in line. To advance on the\r\nenemy, a part of the battalion was detached as skirmishers. The\r\nremainder marched into battle and was engaged without keeping ranks.\r\nThe combat was sustained by groups fighting without formal order. The\r\nart was to support by reserves the troops advanced as skirmishers. The\r\nskirmishers always began the action, when indeed they did not complete\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTo oppose fire by rank to skirmishers was fools' play.\r\n\r\nSkirmishers necessarily opposed each other. Once this method was\r\nadopted, they were supported, reinforced by troops in formation. In\r\nthe midst of general firing fire at command became impossible and was\r\nreplaced by fire at will.\r\n\r\nDumouriez, at the battle of Jemmapes, threw out whole battalions as\r\nskirmishers, and supporting them by light cavalry, did wonders with\r\nthem. They surrounded the Austrian redoubts and rained on the\r\ncannoneers a hail of bullets so violent that they abandoned their\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians, astounded by this novel combat method, vainly\r\nreinforced their light troops by detachments of heavy infantry. Their\r\nskirmishers could not resist our numbers and impetuosity, and\r\npresently their line, beaten by a storm of bullets, was forced back.\r\nThe noise of battle, the firing, increased; the defeated troops,\r\nhearing commands no longer, threw down their arms and fled in\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nSo fire in line, heavy as it may be, cannot prevail against the power\r\nof numerous detachments of skirmishers. A rain of bullets directed\r\naimlessly is impotent against isolated men profiting by the slightest\r\ncover to escape the fire of their adversaries, while the deployed\r\nbattalions offer to their rifles a huge and relatively harmless\r\ntarget. The dense line, apparently so strong, withers under the deadly\r\neffect of the fire of isolated groups, so feeble in appearance.\r\n(General Renard.)\r\n\r\nThe Prussians suffered in the same way at Jena. Their lines tried fire\r\nat command against our skirmishers. You might as well fire on a\r\nhandful of fleas.\r\n\r\nThey tell us of the English salvos at Sainte-Euphemie, in Calabria,\r\nand later in Spain. In these particular cases they could be used,\r\nbecause our troops charged without first sending out skirmishers.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Sainte-Euphemie only lasted half an hour; it was badly\r\nconceived and executed, \"And if,\" says General Duhesme, \"the advancing\r\nbattalions had been preceded by detachments of skirmishers who had\r\nalready made holes in enemy ranks, and, on close approach, the heads\r\nof columns had been launched in a charge, the English line would not\r\nhave conserved that coolness which made their fire so effective and\r\naccurate. Certainly it would not have waited so long to loose its\r\nfire, if it had been vigorously harassed by skirmishers.\"\r\n\r\nAn English author, treating of the history of weapons, speaks of the\r\nrolling fire, well directed, of the English troops. He makes no\r\nmention of salvos. Perhaps we were mistaken, and in our accounts have\r\ntaken the fire of a battalion for the formal battalion fire at command\r\nof our regulations.\r\n\r\nThe same tendency appears more clearly in the work on infantry of the\r\nMarquis de Chambray, who knew the English army well. He says that the\r\nEnglish in Spain used almost entirely fire in two ranks. They employed\r\nbattalion fire only when attacked by our troops without skirmishers,\r\nfiring on the flanks of our columns. And he says \"The fire by\r\nbattalion, by half battalion and by platoon is limited to the target\r\nrange. The fire actually most used in war is that in two ranks, the\r\nonly one used by the French.\" Later he adds \"Experience proves fire in\r\ntwo ranks the only one to be used against the enemy.\" Before him\r\nMarshal Saxe wrote \"Avoid dangerous maneuvers, such as fire by\r\nplatoon, which have often caused shameful defeats.\" These statements\r\nare as true now as then.\r\n\r\nFire at command, by platoon, by battalion, etc., is used in case the\r\nenemy having repulsed skirmishers and arrived at a reasonable range\r\neither charges or opens fire for effect himself. If the latter, fire\r\nis reciprocal and lasts until one or the other gives way or charges.\r\nIf the enemy charges, what happens? He advances preceded by\r\nskirmishers who deliver a hail of bullets. You wish to open fire, but\r\nthe voices of your officers are lost. The noise of artillery, of small\r\narms, the confusion of battle, the shrieks of the wounded, distract\r\nthe soldiers' attention. Before you have delivered your command the\r\nline is ablaze. Then try to stop your soldiers. While there is a\r\ncartridge left, they will fire. The enemy may find a fold of ground\r\nthat protects him; he may adopt in place of his deployed order columns\r\nwith wide intervals between, or otherwise change his dispositions. The\r\nchanging incidents of battle are hidden by smoke and the troops in\r\nfront, from the view of the officers behind. The soldiers will\r\ncontinue to fire and the officers can do nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAll this has been said already, has been gone into, and fire at\r\ncommand has been abandoned. Why take it up again? It comes to us\r\nprobably from the Prussians. Indeed the reports of their general staff\r\non their last campaign, of 1866, say that it was very effectively\r\nemployed, and cite many examples.\r\n\r\nBut a Prussian officer who went through the campaign in the ranks and\r\nsaw things close up, says, \"In examining the battles of 1866 for\r\ncharacteristics, one is struck by a feature common to all, the\r\nextraordinary extension of front at the expense of depth. Either the\r\nfront is spun out into a single long thin line, or it is broken into\r\nvarious parts that fight by themselves. Above all the tendency is\r\nevident to envelop the enemy by extending the wings. There is no\r\nlonger any question of keeping the original order of battle. Different\r\nunits are confused, by battle, or even before battle. Detachments and\r\nlarge units of any corps are composed of diverse and heterogeneous\r\nelements. The battle is fought almost exclusively by columns of\r\ncompanies, rarely of half-battalions. The tactics of these columns\r\nconsists in throwing out strong detachments of skirmishers. Gradually\r\nthe supports are engaged and deployed. The line is broken, scattered,\r\nlike a horde of irregular cavalry. The second line which has held\r\nclose order tries to get up to the first promptly, first to engage in\r\nthe fight, also because they suffer losses from the high shots\r\ndirected at the first line. It suffers losses that are heavy as it is\r\ncompact and supports them with impatience as it does not yet feel the\r\nfever of battle. The most of the second line then forces entry into\r\nthe first, and, as there is more room on the wings, it gravitates to\r\nthe wings. Very often even the reserve is drawn in, entirely, or so\r\nlargely that it cannot fulfill its mission. In fact, the fighting of\r\nthe first two lines is a series of combats between company commands\r\nand the enemy each command faces. Superior officers cannot follow on\r\nhorseback all the units, which push ahead over all sorts of ground.\r\nThey have to dismount and attach themselves to the first unit of their\r\ncommand met. Unable to manipulate their whole command, in order to do\r\nsomething, they command the smaller unit. It is not always better\r\ncommanded at that. Even generals find themselves in this situation.\"\r\n\r\nHere is something we understand better. It is certainly what occurs.\r\n\r\nAs for the instances cited in the general staff reports, they deal\r\nwith companies or half-battalions at most. Not withstanding the\r\ncomplacency with which they are cited, they must have been rare, and\r\nthe exception should not be taken as establishing a rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Fire at Will--Its Efficacy\r\n\r\nThus fire at command, to-day as in the past, is impractical and\r\nconsequently not actually used in battle. The only means employed are\r\nfire at will and the fire of skirmishers. Let us look into their\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\nCompetent authorities have compiled statistics on this point.\r\n\r\nGuibert thinks that not over two thousand men are killed or wounded by\r\neach million cartridges used in battle.\r\n\r\nGassendi assures us that of three thousand shots only one is a hit.\r\n\r\nPiobert says that the estimate, based on the result of long wars, is\r\nthat three to ten thousand cartridges are expended for each man hit.\r\n\r\nTo-day, with accurate and long range weapons, have things changed\r\nmuch? We do not think so. The number of bullets fired must be compared\r\nwith the number of men dropped, with a deduction made for the action\r\nof artillery, which must be considered.\r\n\r\nA German author has advanced the opinion that with the Prussian needle\r\nrifle the hits are 60% of the shots fired. But then how explain the\r\ndisappointment of M. Dreyse, the happy inventor of the needle rifle,\r\nwhen he compared Prussian and Austrian losses. This good old gentleman\r\nwas disagreeably astonished at seeing that his rifle had not come up\r\nto his expectations.\r\n\r\nFire at will, as we shall presently show, is a fire to occupy the men\r\nin the ranks but its effect is not great. We could give many examples;\r\nwe only cite one, but it is conclusive.\r\n\r\n\"Has it not been remarked,\" says General Duhesme, \"that, before a\r\nfiring line there is raised a veil of smoke which on one side or the\r\nother hides the troops from view, and makes the fire of the best\r\nplaced troops uncertain and practically without effect? I proved it\r\nconclusively at the battle of Caldiero, in one of the successive\r\nadvances that occurred on my left wing. I saw some battalions, which I\r\nhad rallied, halted and using an individual fire which they could not\r\nkeep up for long. I went there. I saw through the smoke cloud nothing\r\nbut flashes, the glint of bayonets and the tops of grenadier's caps.\r\nWe were not far from the enemy however, perhaps sixty paces. A ravine\r\nseparated us, but it could not be seen. I went into the ranks, which\r\nwere neither closed nor aligned, throwing up with my hand the\r\nsoldiers' rifles to get them to cease firing and to advance. I was\r\nmounted, followed by a dozen orderlies. None of us were wounded, nor\r\ndid I see an infantryman fall. Well then! Hardly had our line started\r\nwhen the Austrians, heedless of the obstacle that separated us,\r\nretreated.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that had the Austrians started to move first, the\r\nFrench would have given way. It was veterans of the Empire, who\r\ncertainly were as reliable as our men, who gave this example of lack\r\nof coolness.\r\n\r\nIn ranks, fire at will is the only possible one for our officers and\r\nmen. But with the excitement, the smoke, the annoying incidents, one\r\nis lucky to get even horizontal fire, to say nothing of aimed fire.\r\n\r\nIn fire at will, without taking count of any trembling, men interfere\r\nwith each other. Whoever advances or who gives way to the recoil of\r\nhis weapon deranges the shot of his neighbor. With full pack, the\r\nsecond rank has no loophole; it fires in the air. On the range,\r\nspacing men to the extremity of the limits of formation, firing very\r\nslowly, men are found who are cool and not too much bothered by the\r\ncrack of discharge in their ears, who let the smoke pass and seize a\r\nloophole of pretty good visibility, who try, in a word, not to lose\r\ntheir shots. And the percentage results show much more regularity than\r\nwith fire at command.\r\n\r\nBut in front of the enemy fire at will becomes in an instant haphazard\r\nfire. Each man fires as much as possible, that is to say, as badly as\r\npossible. There are physical and mental reasons why this is so.\r\n\r\nEven at close range, in battle, the cannon can fire well. The gunner,\r\nprotected in part by his piece, has an instant of coolness in which to\r\nlay accurately. That his pulse is racing does not derange his line of\r\nsight, if he has will power. The eye trembles little, and the piece\r\nonce laid, remains so until fired.\r\n\r\nThe rifleman, like the gunner, only by will-power keeps his ability to\r\naim. But the excitement in the blood, of the nervous system, opposes\r\nthe immobility of the weapon in his hands. No matter how supported, a\r\npart of the weapon always shares the agitation of the man. He is\r\ninstinctively in haste to fire his shot, which may stop the departure\r\nof the bullet destined for him. However lively the fire is, this vague\r\nreasoning, unformed as it is in his mind, controls with all the force\r\nof the instinct of self preservation. Even the bravest and most\r\nreliable soldiers then fire madly.\r\n\r\nThe greater number fire from the hip.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the range is that with continual pressure on the trigger\r\nthe shot surprises the firer. But who practices it under fire?\r\n\r\nHowever, the tendency in France to-day is to seek only accuracy. What\r\ngood will it do when smoke, fog, darkness, long range, excitement, the\r\nlack of coolness, forbid clear sight?\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say, after the feats of fire at Sebastopol, in Italy,\r\nthat accurate weapons have given us no more valuable service than a\r\nsimple rifle. Just the same, to one who has seen, facts are facts.\r\nBut--see how history is written. It has been set down that the\r\nRussians were beaten at Inkermann by the range and accuracy of weapons\r\nof the French troops. But the battle was fought in thickets and wooded\r\ncountry, in a dense fog. And when the weather cleared, our soldiers,\r\nour chasseurs were out of ammunition and borrowed from the Russian\r\ncartridge boxes, amply provided with cartridges for round, small\r\ncalibered bullets. In either case there could have been no accurate\r\nfire. The facts are that the Russians were beaten by superior morale;\r\nthat unaimed fire, at random, there perhaps more than elsewhere, had\r\nthe only material effect.\r\n\r\nWhen one fires and can only fire at random, who fires most hits most.\r\nOr perhaps it is better said that who fires least expects to be hit\r\nmost.\r\n\r\nFrederick was impressed with this, for he did not believe in the\r\nPotsdam maneuvers. The wily Fritz looked on fire as a means to quiet\r\nand occupy the undependable soldiers and it proved his ability that he\r\ncould put into practice that which might have been a mistake on the\r\npart of any other general officer. He knew very well how to count on\r\nthe effect of his fire, how many thousand cartridges it took to kill\r\nor wound an enemy. At first his soldiers had only thirty cartridges.\r\nHe found the number insufficient, and after Mollwitz gave them sixty.\r\n\r\nTo-day as in Frederick's day, it is rapid random fire, the only one\r\npracticable, which has given prestige to the Prussians. This idea of\r\nrapid fire was lost after Frederick, but the Prussians have recovered\r\nit to-day by exercising common sense. However our veterans of the\r\nEmpire had preserved this idea, which comes from instinct. They\r\nenlarged their vents, scornful of flare backs, to avoid having to open\r\nthe chamber and prime. The bullet having a good deal of clearance when\r\nthe cartridge was torn and put in the gun, with a blow of the butt on\r\nthe ground they had their arms charged and primed.\r\n\r\nBut to-day as then, in spite of skill acquired in individual fire, men\r\nstop aiming and fire badly as soon as they are grouped into platoons\r\nto fire.\r\n\r\nPrussian officers, who are practical men, know that adjustment of\r\nsights is impracticable in the heat of action, and that in fire by\r\nvolleys troops tend to use the full sight. So in the war of 1866 they\r\nordered their men to fire very low, almost without sighting, in order\r\nto profit by ricochets.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Fire by Rank Is a Fire to Occupy the Men in Ranks\r\n\r\nBut if fire at will is not effective, what is its use? As we have\r\nalready said its use is to occupy the men in the ranks.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary fire the act of breathing alone, by the movement it\r\ncommunicates to the body greatly annoys men in firing. How then can it\r\nbe claimed that on the field of battle, in rank, men can fire even\r\nmoderately well when they fire only to soothe themselves and forget\r\ndanger?\r\n\r\nNapoleon said \"The instinct of man is not to let himself be killed\r\nwithout defending himself.\" And indeed man in combat is a being in\r\nwhom the instinct of self preservation dominates at times all other\r\nsentiments. The object of discipline is to dominate this instinct by a\r\ngreater terror of shame or of punishment. But it is never able\r\nentirely to attain this object; there is a point beyond which it is\r\nnot effectual. This point reached, the soldier must fire or he will go\r\neither forward or back. Fire is then, let us say, a safety vent for\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nIn serious affairs it is then difficult, if not impossible, to control\r\nfire. Here is an example given by Marshal Saxe:\r\n\r\n\"Charles XII, King of Sweden, wished to introduce into his infantry\r\nthe method of charging with the bayonet. He spoke of it often, and it\r\nwas known in the army that this was his idea. Finally at the battle\r\nof ---- against the Russians, when the fighting started he went to his\r\nregiment of infantry, made it a fine speech, dismounted before the\r\ncolors, and himself led the regiment to the charge. When he was thirty\r\npaces from the enemy the whole regiment fired, in spite of his orders\r\nand his presence. Otherwise, it did very well and broke the enemy. The\r\nking was so annoyed that all he did was pass through the ranks,\r\nremount his horse, and go away without saying a word.\"\r\n\r\nSo that, if the soldier is not made to fire, he will fire anyway to\r\ndistract himself and forget danger. The fire of Frederick's Prussians\r\nhad no other purpose. Marshal Saxe saw this. \"The speed with which the\r\nPrussians load their rifles,\" he tells us, \"is advantageous in that it\r\noccupies the soldier and forbids reflection while he is in the\r\npresence of the enemy. It is an error to believe that the five last\r\nvictories gained by the nation in its last war were due to fire. It\r\nhas been noted that in most of these actions there were more Prussians\r\nkilled by rifle fire than there were of their enemies.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be sad to think the soldier in line a firing machine. Firing\r\nhas been and always will be his principal object, to fire as many\r\nshots in as short a time as possible. But the victor is not always the\r\none who kills the most; he is fortunate who best knows how to overcome\r\nthe morale of his enemy.\r\n\r\nThe coolness of men cannot be counted on. And as it is necessary above\r\nall to keep up their morale one ought to try above all to occupy and\r\nsoothe them. This can best be done by frequent discharges. There will\r\nbe little effect, and it would be absurd to expect them to be calm\r\nenough to fire slowly, adjust their ranges and above all sight\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The Deadly Fire Is the Fire of Skirmishers\r\n\r\nIn group firing, when the men are grouped into platoons or battalions,\r\nall weapons have the same value, and if it is assumed to-day that fire\r\nmust decide engagements, the method of fighting must be adopted which\r\ngives most effect to the weapon. This is the employment of\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\nIt is this class of fire, indeed, which is deadliest in war. We could\r\ngive many examples but we shall be content with the two following\r\ninstances, taken from General Duhesme.\r\n\r\n\"A French officer who served with the Austrians in one of the recent\r\nwars,\" says General Duhesme, \"told me that from the fire of a French\r\nbattalion one hundred paces from them, his company lost only three or\r\nfour men, while in the same time they had had more than thirty killed\r\nor wounded by the fire of a group of skirmishers in a little wood on\r\ntheir flank three hundred paces away.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the passage of the Minico, in 1801, the 2nd battalion of the 91st\r\nreceived the fire of a battalion of Bussi's regiment without losing a\r\nman; the skirmishers of that same organization killed more than thirty\r\nmen in a few minutes while protecting the retreat of their\r\norganization.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire of skirmishers is then the most deadly used in war, because\r\nthe few men who remain cool enough to aim are not otherwise annoyed\r\nwhile employed as skirmishers. They will perform better as they are\r\nbetter hidden, and better trained in firing.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of fire giving advantages only in isolated fire, we may\r\nconsider that accurate weapons will tend to make fighting by\r\nskirmishers more frequent and more decisive.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, experience authorizes the statement that the use of\r\nskirmishers is compulsory in war. To-day all troops seriously engaged\r\nbecome in an instant groups of skirmishers and the only possible\r\nprecise fire is from hidden snipers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the military education which we have received, the spirit of\r\nthe times, clouds with doubt our mind regarding this method of\r\nfighting by skirmishers. We accept it regretfully. Our personal\r\nexperience being incomplete, insufficient, we content ourselves with\r\nthe supposition that gives us satisfaction. The war of skirmishers, no\r\nmatter how thoroughly it has been proven out, is accepted by\r\nconstraint, because we are forced by circumstance to engage our troops\r\nby degrees, in spite of ourselves, often unconsciously. But, be it\r\nunderstood, to-day a successive engagement is necessary in war.\r\n\r\nHowever, let us not have illusions as to the efficacy of the fire of\r\nskirmishers. In spite of the use of accurate and long range weapons,\r\nin spite of all training that can be given the soldier, this fire\r\nnever has more than a relative effect, which should not be\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe fire of skirmishers is generally against skirmishers. A body of\r\ntroops indeed does not let itself be fired on by skirmishers without\r\nreturning a similar fire. And it is absurd to expect skirmishers to\r\ndirect their fire on a body protected by skirmishers. To demand of\r\ntroops firing individually, almost abandoned to themselves, that they\r\ndo not answer the shots directed at them, by near skirmishers, but aim\r\nat a distant body, which is not harming them, is to ask an impossible\r\nunselfishness.\r\n\r\nAs skirmishers men are very scattered. To watch the adjustment of\r\nranges is difficult. Men are practically left alone. Those who remain\r\ncool may try to adjust their range, but it is first necessary to see\r\nwhere your shots fall, then, if the terrain permits this and it will\r\nrarely do so, to distinguish them from shots fired at the same time by\r\nyour neighbors. Also these men will be more disturbed, will fire\r\nfaster and less accurately, as the fight is more bitter, the enemy\r\nstauncher; and perturbation is more contagious than coolness.\r\n\r\nThe target is a line of skirmishers, a target offering so little\r\nbreadth and above all depth, that outside of point blank fire, an\r\nexact knowledge of the range is necessary to secure effect. This is\r\nimpossible, for the range varies at each instant with the movements of\r\nthe skirmishers. [49]\r\n\r\nThus, with skirmishers against skirmishers, there are scattered shots\r\nat scattered targets. Our fire of skirmishers, marching, on the target\r\nrange, proves this, although each man knows exactly the range and has\r\ntime and the coolness to set his sights. It is impossible for\r\nskirmishers in movement to set sights beyond four hundred meters, and\r\nthis is pretty extreme, even though the weapon is actually accurate\r\nbeyond this.\r\n\r\nAlso, a shot is born. There are men, above all in officer instructors\r\nat firing schools, who from poor shots become excellent shots after\r\nyears of practice. But it is impossible to give all the soldiers such\r\nan education without an enormous consumption of ammunition and without\r\nabandoning all other work. And then there would be no results with\r\nhalf of them.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we find that fire is effective only at point blank. Even in\r\nour last wars there have been very few circumstances in which men who\r\nwere favored with coolness and under able leadership have furnished\r\nexceptions. With these exceptions noted, we can say that accurate and\r\nlong range weapons have not given any real effect at a range greater\r\nthan point blank.\r\n\r\nThere has been put forward, as proof of the efficacy of accurate\r\nweapons the terrible and decisive results obtained by the British in\r\nIndia, with the Enfield rifle. But these results have been obtained\r\nbecause the British faced comparatively poorly armed enemies. They had\r\nthen the security, the confidence, the ensuing coolness necessary for\r\nthe use of accurate weapons. These conditions are completely changed\r\nwhen one faces an enemy equally well armed, who consequently, gives as\r\ngood as he gets.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Absolute Impossibility of Fire at Command\r\n\r\nLet us return to fire at command, which there is a tendency to-day to\r\nhave troops execute in line.\r\n\r\nCan regular and efficient fire be hoped for from troops in line? Ought\r\nit to be hoped for?\r\n\r\nNo, for man cannot be made over, and neither can the line.\r\n\r\nEven on the range or on the maneuver field what does this fire amount\r\nto?\r\n\r\nIn fire at command, on the range, all the men in the two ranks come to\r\nthe firing position simultaneously, everybody is perfectly quiet. Men\r\nin the front rank consequently are not deranged by their neighbors.\r\nMen in the second rank are in the same situation. The first rank being\r\nset and motionless they can aim through the openings without more\r\nannoyance than those in the first rank.\r\n\r\nFire being executed at command, simultaneously, no weapon is deranged\r\nat the moment of firing by the movements of the men. All conditions\r\nare entirely favorable to this kind of fire. Also as the fire is\r\nordered with skill and coolness by an officer who has perfectly\r\naligned his men (a thing rare even on the drill ground) it gives\r\npercentage results greater than that of fire at will executed with the\r\nminutest precautions, results that are sometimes astonishing.\r\n\r\nBut fire at command, from the extreme coolness that it demands of all,\r\nof the officer certainly more than of the soldier, is impracticable\r\nbefore the enemy except under exceptional circumstances of picked\r\nofficers, picked men, ground, distance, safety, etc. Even in maneuvers\r\nits execution is farcical. There is not an organization in which the\r\nsoldiers do not hurry the command to fire in that the officers are so\r\nafraid that their men will anticipate the command that they give it as\r\nrapidly as possible, while the pieces are hardly in firing position,\r\noften while they are still in motion.\r\n\r\nThe prescription that the command to fire be not given until about\r\nthree seconds after coming to the firing position may give good\r\nresults in the face of range targets. But it is not wise to believe\r\nthat men will wait thus for long in the face of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to speak of the use of the sight-leaf before the enemy,\r\nin fire attempted by the same officers and men who are so utterly\r\nlacking, even on the maneuver ground. We have seen a firing\r\ninstructor, an officer of coolness and assurance, who on the range had\r\nfired trial shots every day for a month, after this month of daily\r\npractice fire four trial shots at a six hundred meter range with the\r\nsight leaf at point blank.\r\n\r\nLet us not pay too much attention to those who in military matters\r\nbase everything on the weapon and unhesitating assume that the man\r\nserving it will adopt the usage provided and ordered in their\r\nregulations. The fighting man is flesh and blood. He is both body and\r\nsoul; and strong as the soul may often be it cannot so dominate the\r\nbody that there is no revolt of the flesh, no mental disturbance, in\r\nthe face of destruction. Let us learn to distrust mathematics and\r\nmaterial dynamics as applied to battle principles. We shall learn to\r\nbeware of the illusions drawn from the range and the maneuver field.\r\n\r\nThere experience is with the calm, settled, unfatigued, attentive,\r\nobedient soldier, with an intelligent and tractable man instrument in\r\nshort. And not with the nervous, easily swayed, moved, troubled,\r\ndistrait, excited, restless being, not even under self-control, who is\r\nthe fighting man from general to private. There are strong men,\r\nexceptions, but they are rare.\r\n\r\nThese illusions nevertheless, stubborn and persistent, always repair\r\nthe next day the most damaging injuries inflicted on them by reality.\r\nTheir least dangerous effect is to lead to prescribing the\r\nimpracticable, as if ordering the impracticable were not really an\r\nattack on discipline, and did not result in disconcerting officers and\r\nmen by the unexpected and by surprise at the contrast between battle\r\nand the theories of peace-time training.\r\n\r\nBattle of course always furnishes surprises. But it furnishes less in\r\nproportion as good sense and the recognition of the truth have had\r\ntheir effect on the training of the fighting man.\r\n\r\nMan in the mass, in a disciplined body organized for combat, is\r\ninvincible before an undisciplined body. But against a similarly\r\ndisciplined body he reverts to the primitive man who flees before a\r\nforce that is proved stronger, or that he feels stronger. The heart of\r\nthe soldier is always the human heart. Discipline holds enemies face\r\nto face a little longer, but the instinct of self-preservation\r\nmaintains its empire and with it the sense of fear.\r\n\r\nFear!\r\n\r\nThere are chiefs, there are soldiers who know no fear, but they are of\r\nrare temper. The mass trembles, for the flesh cannot be suppressed.\r\nAnd this trembling must be taken into account in all organization,\r\ndiscipline, formation, maneuver, movement, methods of action. For in\r\nall of these the soldier tends to be upset, to be deceived, to\r\nunder-rate himself and to exaggerate the offensive spirit of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nOn the field of battle death is in the air, blind and invisible,\r\nmaking his presence known by fearful whistlings that make heads duck.\r\nDuring this strain the recruit hunches up, closes in, seeking aid by\r\nan instinctive unformulated reasoning. He figures that the more there\r\nare to face a danger the greater each one's chances of escaping. But\r\nhe soon sees that flesh attracts lead. Then, possessed by terror,\r\ninevitably he retreats before the fire, or \"he escapes by advancing,\"\r\nin the picturesque and profound words of General Burbaki.\r\n\r\nThe soldier escapes from his officer, we say. Yes, he escapes! But is\r\nit not evident that he escapes because up to this moment nobody has\r\nbothered about his character, his temperament, the impressionable and\r\nexciteable nature of man? In prescribed methods of fighting he has\r\nalways been held to impossibilities. The same thing is done to-day.\r\nTo-morrow, as yesterday, he will escape.\r\n\r\nThere is of course a time when all the soldiers escape, either\r\nforward, or to the rear. But the organization, the combat methods\r\nshould have no other object than to delay as long as possible this\r\ncrisis. Yet they hasten it.\r\n\r\nAll our officers fear, quite justifiably from their experience, that\r\nthe soldier will too rapidly use his cartridges in the face of the\r\nenemy. This serious matter is certainly worthy of attention. How to\r\nstop this useless and dangerous waste of ammunition is the question.\r\nOur soldiers show little coolness. Once in danger they fire, fire to\r\ncalm themselves, to pass the time; they cannot be stopped.\r\n\r\nThere are some people you cannot embarrass. With the best faith in the\r\nworld they say, \"What is this? You are troubled about stopping the\r\nfire of your soldiers? That is not difficult. You find that they show\r\nlittle coolness, and shoot despite their officers, in spite even of\r\nthemselves? All right, require of them and their officers methods of\r\nfire that demand extremes of coolness, calm and assurance, even in\r\nmaneuver. They cannot give a little? Ask a lot and you will get it.\r\nThere you have a combat method nobody has ever heard of, simple,\r\nbeautiful, and terrible.\"\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a fine theory. It would make the wily Frederick who\r\nsurely did not believe in these maneuvers, laugh until he cried. [50]\r\n\r\nThis is to escape from a difficulty by a means always recognized as\r\nimpossible, and more impossible than ever to-day.\r\n\r\nFearing that the soldier will escape from command, can not better\r\nmeans be found to hold him than to require of him and his officer,\r\nimpracticable fire? This, ordered and not executed by the soldiers,\r\nand even by the officers, is an attack on the discipline of the unit.\r\n\"Never order the impossible,\" says discipline, \"for the impossible\r\nbecomes then a disobedience.\"\r\n\r\nHow many requisites there are to make fire at command possible,\r\nconditions among the soldiers, among their officers. Perfect these\r\nconditions, they say. All right, perfect their training, their\r\ndiscipline, etc.; but to obtain fire at command it is necessary to\r\nperfect their nerves, their physical force, their moral force, to make\r\nbronze images of them, to do away with excitement, with the trembling\r\nof the flesh. Can any one do this?\r\n\r\nFrederick's soldiers were brought, by blows of the baton, to a\r\nterrible state of discipline. Yet their fire was fire at will.\r\nDiscipline had reached its limits.\r\n\r\nMan in battle, let us repeat again, is a being to whom the instinct of\r\nself-preservation at times dominates everything else. Discipline,\r\nwhose purpose is to dominate this instinct by a feeling of greater\r\nterror, can not wholly achieve it. Discipline goes so far and no\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nWe cannot deny the existence of extraordinary instances when\r\ndiscipline and devotion have raised man above himself. But these\r\nexamples are extraordinary, rare. They are admired as exceptions, and\r\nthe exception proves the rule.\r\n\r\nAs to perfection, consider the Spartans. If man was ever perfected for\r\nwar it was he; and yet he has been beaten, and fled.\r\n\r\nIn spite of training, moral and physical force has limits. The\r\nSpartans, who should have stayed to the last man on the battle field,\r\nfled.\r\n\r\nThe British with their phlegmatic coolness and their terrible rolling\r\nfire, the Russians, with that inertia that is called their tenacity,\r\nhave given way before attack. The German has given way, he who on\r\naccount of his subordination and stability has been called excellent\r\nwar material.\r\n\r\nAgain an objection is raised. Perhaps with recruits the method may be\r\nimpracticable. But with veterans--But with whom is war commenced?\r\nMethods are devised precisely for young and inexperienced troops.\r\n\r\nThey ask, also, if the Prussians used this method of fire successfully\r\nin the last war, why should not we do as well? Supposing that the\r\nPrussians actually did use it, and this is far from being proved, it\r\ndoes not follow that it is practicable for us. This mania for\r\nborrowing German tactics is not new, although it has always been\r\nproperly protested against. Marshal Luchner said, \"No matter how much\r\nthey torment their men, fortunately they will never make them\r\nPrussians.\" Later de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr said, \"The men are drilled in\r\nvarious exercises believed necessary to fit them for war, but there is\r\nno question of adopting exercises to suit the French military genius,\r\nthe French character and temperament. It has not been thought\r\nnecessary to take this into account; it has been easier to borrow\r\nGerman methods.\"\r\n\r\nTo follow preconceived tactics is more the part of the phlegmatic\r\nGerman than it is ours. The Germans obey well enough, but the point is\r\nthat they try to follow tactics which are contrary to nature. The\r\nFrenchman cannot. More spontaneous, more exciteable and\r\nimpressionable, less calm and obedient, he has in our last wars\r\npromptly and completely violated both the letter and the spirit of the\r\nregulations. \"The German,\" said a Prussian officer, \"has sentiments of\r\nduty and obedience. He submits to severe discipline. He is full of\r\ndevotion, although not animated by a lively mind. Easy by nature,\r\nrather heavy than active, intellectually calm, reflective, without\r\ndash or divine fire, wishing but not mad to conquer, obeying calmly\r\nand conscientiously, but mechanically and without enthusiasm, fighting\r\nwith a resigned valor, with heroism, he may let himself be sacrificed\r\nuselessly, but he sells his life dearly. Without warlike tendencies,\r\nnot bellicose, unambitious, he is yet excellent war material on\r\naccount of his subordination and stability. What must be inculcated in\r\nhim is a will of his own, a personal impulse to send him forward.\"\r\nAccording to this unflattering portrait, which we believe a little\r\nextreme, even if by a compatriot, it is possible that the Germans can\r\nbe handled in tactics impossible with French. However, did they\r\nactually use these tactics? Remember the urgent warning of Bluecher to\r\nhis brigade commanders, not to let bayonet attacks break down into\r\nfusillades. Note the article in the present Prussian firing\r\nregulations, which prescribes trial shots before each fire delivered,\r\n\"so as to dissipate the kind of excitement that possesses the soldier\r\nwhen his drill has been interrupted for some time.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if fire at command was impossible with the ancient\r\nrifle, it is more so to-day, for the simple reason that trembling\r\nincreases as the destructive power increases. Under Turenne, lines\r\nheld longer than to-day, because the musket was in use and the battle\r\ndeveloped more slowly. To-day when every one has the rapid fire rifle,\r\nare things easier? Alas no! Relations between weapons and the man are\r\nthe same. You give me a musket, I fire at sixty paces, a rifle, at two\r\nhundred; a chessepot, at four hundred. But I have perhaps less\r\ncoolness and steadiness than at the old sixty paces, for with the\r\nrapidity of fire the new weapon is more terrible at four hundred\r\npaces, for me as well as for the enemy, than was the musket at sixty\r\npaces. And is there even more fire accuracy? No. Rifles were used\r\nbefore the French revolution, and yet this perfectly well known weapon\r\nwas very rarely seen in war, and its efficacy, as shown in those rare\r\ncases, was unsatisfactory. Accurate fire with it at combat distances\r\nof from two hundred to four hundred meters was illusory, and it was\r\nabandoned in favor of the old rifle. Did the foot chasseurs know fire\r\nat command? Picked troops, dependable, did they use it? Yet it would\r\nhave been a fine method of employing their weapons. To-day we have\r\nweapons that are accurate at six hundred to seven hundred meters. Does\r\nthat mean that accurate fire at seven hundred meters is possible? No.\r\nIf your enemy is armed as we are, fire at seven hundred meters will\r\nshow the same results that have been shown for four hundred meters.\r\nThe same losses will be suffered, and the coolness shown will be the\r\nsame--that is, it will be absent. If one fire three times as fast,\r\nthree times as many men will fall, and it will be three times as\r\ndifficult to preserve coolness. Just as formerly it was impossible to\r\nexecute fire at command, so it is to-day. Formerly no sight-setting\r\nwas possible; it is no better to-day.\r\n\r\nBut if this fire is impossible, why attempt it? Let us remain always\r\nin the realm of the possible or we shall make sad mistakes. \"In our\r\nart,\" said General Daine, \"theorists abound; practical men are very\r\nrare. Also when the moment of action arrives, principles are often\r\nfound to be confused, application impossible, and the most erudite\r\nofficers remain inactive, unable to use the scientific treasures that\r\nthey have amassed.\"\r\n\r\nLet us then, practical men, seek for possible methods. Let us gather\r\ncarefully the lessons of their experience, remembering Bacon's saying,\r\n\"Experience excels science.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix II\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Cavalry\r\n\r\nAn Extract from Xenophon.\r\n\r\n\"The unexpectedness of an event accentuates it, be it pleasant or\r\nterrible. This is nowhere seen better than in war, where surprise\r\nterrorizes even the strongest.\r\n\r\n\"When two armies are in touch or merely separated by the field of\r\nbattle, there are first, on the part of the cavalry, skirmishes,\r\nthrusts, wheels to stop or pursue the enemy, after which usually each\r\ngoes cautiously and does not put forth its greatest effort until the\r\ncritical part of the conflict. Or, having commenced as usual, the\r\nopposite is done and one moves swiftly, after the wheel, either to\r\nflee or to pursue. This is the method by which one can, with the least\r\npossible risk, most harm the enemy, charging at top speed when\r\nsupported, or fleeing at the same speed to escape the enemy. If it is\r\npossible in these skirmishes to leave behind, formed in column and\r\nunobserved four or five of the bravest and best mounted men in each\r\ntroop they may be very well employed to fall on the enemy at the\r\nmoment of the wheel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Marius Against the Cimbrians\r\n\r\nExtract from Plutarch's \"Life of Marius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boiorix, king of the Cimbrians, at the head of a small troop of\r\ncavalry, approached Marius' camp and challenged him to fix a day and\r\nplace to decide who would rule the country. Marius answered that\r\nRomans did not ask their enemies when to fight, but that he was\r\nwilling to satisfy the Cimbrians. They agreed then to give battle in\r\nthree days on the plain of Verceil, a convenient place for the Romans\r\nto deploy their cavalry and for the barbarians to extend their large\r\narmy. The two opponents on the day set were in battle formation.\r\nCatulus had twenty thousand three hundred men. Marius had thirty-two\r\nthousand, placed on the wings and consequently on either side of those\r\nof Catulus, in the center. So writes Sylla, who was there. They say\r\nthat Marius gave this disposition to the two parts of his army because\r\nhe hoped to fall with his two wings on the barbarian phalanxes and\r\nwished the victory to come only to his command, without Catulus taking\r\nany part or even meeting with the enemy. Indeed, as the front of\r\nbattle was very broad, the wings were separated from the center, which\r\nwas broken through. They add that Catulus reported this disposition in\r\nthe explanation that he had to make and complained bitterly of Marius'\r\nbad faith. The Cimbrian infantry came out of its positions in good\r\norder and in battle array formed a solid phalanx as broad as it was\r\nwide, thirty stades or about eighteen thousand feet. Their fifteen\r\nthousand horsemen were magnificently equipped. Their helmets were\r\ncrowned by the gaping mouths of savage beasts, above which were high\r\nplumes which looked like wings. This accentuated their height. They\r\nwere protected by iron cuirasses and had shields of an astonishing\r\nwhiteness. Each had two javelins to throw from a distance, and in\r\nclose fighting they used a long heavy sword.\r\n\r\n\"In this battle the cavalry did not attack the Romans in front, but,\r\nturning to the right they gradually extended with the idea of\r\nenclosing the Romans before their infantry and themselves. The Roman\r\ngenerals instantly perceived the ruse. But they were not able to\r\nrestrain their men, one of whom, shouting that the enemy was flying,\r\nled all the others to pursue. Meanwhile the barbarian infantry\r\nadvanced like the waves of a great sea.\r\n\r\n\"Marius washed his hands, raised them to heaven, and vowed to offer a\r\nhecatomb to the gods. Catulus for his part, also raised his hands to\r\nheaven and promised to consecrate the fortune of the day. Marius also\r\nmade a sacrifice, and, when the priest showed him the victim's\r\nentrails, cried, 'Victory is mine.' But, as the two armies were set in\r\nmotion, something happened, which, according to Sylla, seemed divine\r\nvengeance on Marius. The movements of such a prodigious multitude\r\nraised such a cloud of dust that the two armies could not see each\r\nother. Marius, who had advanced first with his troops to fall on the\r\nenemy's formation, missed it in the dust, and having passed beyond it,\r\nwandered for a long time in the plain. Meanwhile fortune turned the\r\nbarbarians toward Catulus who had to meet their whole attack with his\r\nsoldiers, among whom was Sylla. The heat of the day and the burning\r\nrays of the sun, which was in the eyes of the Cimbrians, helped the\r\nRomans. The barbarians, reared in cold wooded places, hardened to\r\nextreme cold, could not stand the heat. Sweating, panting, they shaded\r\ntheir faces from the sun with their shields. The battle occurred after\r\nthe summer solstice, three days before the new moon of the month of\r\nAugust, then called Sextilis. The cloud of dust sustained the Romans'\r\ncourage by concealing the number of the enemy. Each battalion\r\nadvancing against the enemy in front of them were engaged, before the\r\nsight of such a great horde of barbarians could shake them.\r\nFurthermore, hardship and hard work had so toughened them that in\r\nspite of the heat and impetuousness with which they attacked, no Roman\r\nwas seen to sweat or pant. This, it is said, is testified to by\r\nCatulus himself in eulogizing the conduct of his troops.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the enemy, above all the bravest, were cut to pieces, for, to\r\nkeep the front ranks from breaking, they were tied together by long\r\nchains attached to their belts. The victors pursued the fugitives to\r\ntheir entrenched camp.\r\n\r\n\"The Romans took more than sixty thousand Cimbrians prisoners, and\r\nkilled twice as many.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Battle of the Alma\r\n\r\nExtract from the correspondence of Colonel Ardant du Picq. A letter\r\nsent from Huy, February 9, 1869, by Captain de V----, a company\r\nofficer in the attack division.\r\n\r\n\"My company, with the 3rd, commanded by Captain D---- was designated to\r\ncover the battalion.\r\n\r\n\"At eight or nine hundred meters from the Alma, we saw a sort of wall,\r\ncrowned with white, whose use we could not understand. Then, at not\r\nmore than three hundred meters, this wall delivered against us a\r\nlively battalion fire and deployed at the run. It was a Russian\r\nbattalion whose uniform, partridge-gray or chestnut-gray color, with\r\nwhite helmet, had, with the help of a bright sun, produced the\r\nillusion. This, parenthetically, showed me that this color is\r\ncertainly the most sensible, as it can cause such errors. [51] We replied\r\nactively, but there was effect on neither side because the men fired\r\ntoo fast and too high.... The advance was then taken up, and I don't\r\nknow from whom the order can have come.... We went on the run, crossing\r\nthe river easily enough, and while we were assembling to scramble up\r\nthe hill we saw the rest of the battalion attacking, without order,\r\ncompanies mixed up, crying, 'Forward,' singing, etc. We did the same,\r\nagain took up the attack, and were lucky enough to reach the summit of\r\nthe plateau first. The Russians, astounded, massed in a square. Why? I\r\nsuppose that, turned on the left, attacked in the center, they thought\r\nthemselves surrounded, and took this strange formation. At this moment\r\na most inopportune bugle call was sounded by order of Major\r\nDe M---- commanding temporarily a battalion of foot chasseurs. This\r\nofficer had perceived the Russian cavalry in motion and believed that\r\nits object was to charge us, while, on the contrary it was maneuvering\r\nto escape the shells fired into it while in squadron formation by the\r\nMegere, a vessel of the fleet. This order given by bugle signal was\r\nexecuted as rapidly as had been the attack, such is the instinct of\r\nself-preservation which urges man to flee danger, above all when ordered\r\nto flee. Happily a level-headed officer, Captain Daguerre, seeing the\r\ngross mistake, commanded 'Forward' in a stentorian tone. This halted the\r\nretreat and caused us again to take up the attack. The attack made us\r\nmasters of the telegraph-line, and the battle was won. At this second\r\ncharge the Russians gave, turned, and hardly any of them were wounded\r\nwith the bayonet. So then a major commanding a battalion, without\r\norders, sounds a bugle call and endangers success. A simple Captain\r\ncommands 'Forward,' and decides the victory. This is the history of\r\nyesterday, which may be useful tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from this that, apart from the able conception of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, the detail of execution was abominable, and that\r\nto base on successes new rules of battle would lead to lamentable\r\nerrors. Let us sum up:\r\n\r\nFirst: A private chasseur d'Afrique gave the order to attack;\r\n\r\nSecond: The troops went to the attack mixed up with each other. We\r\nneeded nearly an hour merely to reform the brigade. This one called,\r\nthat one congratulated himself, the superior officers cried out, etc.,\r\netc.; there was confusion that would have meant disaster if the\r\ncavalry charge which was believed to threaten us, had been executed.\r\nDisorder broke out in the companies at the first shot. Once engaged,\r\ncommanders of organizations no longer had them in hand, and they\r\nintermingled, so that it was not easy to locate oneself;\r\n\r\nThird: There was no silence in ranks. Officers, non-commissioned\r\nofficers and soldiers commanded, shouted, etc.; the bugles sounded the\r\ncommands they heard coming from nobody knew where;\r\n\r\nFourth: There was no maneuvering from the first shot to the last. I do\r\nnot remember being among my own men; it was only at the end that we\r\nfound each other. Zouaves, chasseurs, soldiers of the 20th line formed\r\nan attack group--that was all. About four o'clock there was a first\r\nroll call. About a third of the battalion was missing at nine at night\r\nthere was a second roll call. Only about fifty men were missing,\r\nthirty of whom were wounded. Where the rest were I do not know.\r\n\r\nFifth: To lighten the men, packs had been left on the plain at the\r\nmoment fire opened, and as the operation had not been worked out in\r\nadvance, no measures were taken to guard them. In the evening most of\r\nthe men found their packs incomplete, lacking all the little\r\nindispensables that one cannot get in the position in which we were.\r\n\r\nIt is evidently a vital necessity to restrain the individual\r\ninitiative of subordinates and leave command to the chiefs, and above\r\nall to watch the training of the soldiers who are always ready, as\r\nthey approach, to run on the enemy with the bayonet. I have always\r\nnoted that if a body which is charged does not hold firm, it breaks\r\nand takes flight, but that if it holds well, the charging body halts\r\nsome paces away before it strikes. I shall tell you something notable\r\nthat I saw at Castel-Fidardo. They talk a lot of the bayonet. For my\r\npart I only saw it used once, in the night, in a trench. Also it is\r\nnoted that in the hospital, practically all the wounds treated were\r\nfrom fire, rarely from the bayonet.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Battle of the Alma\r\n\r\nExtract from the correspondence of Colonel A. du Picq. Letters dated\r\nin November, 1868, and February, 1869, sent from Rennes by Captain\r\nP---- of the 17th battalion of foot chasseurs, with remarks by the\r\ncolonel and responses of Captain P----.\r\n\r\nFirst letter from Captain P----\r\n\r\n\"... It is there that I had time to admire the coolness of my brave\r\nCaptain Daguerre, advancing on a mare under the enemy's eyes, and\r\nobserving imperturbable, like a tourist, all the movements of our\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n\"I will always pay homage to his calm and collected bravery....\"\r\n\r\nRemarks by the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Did not Captain Daguerre change the bugle call 'Retreat,' ordered\r\nby ---- to the bugle call 'Forward?'\"\r\n\r\nAnswer of Captain P----\r\n\r\n\"In fact, when protected in the wood by pieces of wall we were firing\r\non the Russians, we heard behind us the bugle sounding 'Retreat' at\r\nthe order of ----.

The Battle of Inkermann\r\n\r\nExtract from the correspondence of Colonel Ardant du Picq.\r\n\r\nFirst: Letter sent from Lyon, March 21, 1869, by Major de G----, 17th\r\nLine Regiment.\r\n\r\n\"... The 1st Battalion of the 7th Light Regiment had hardly arrived\r\nclose to the telegraph when it received a new order to rush to the\r\nhelp of the English army, which, too weak to hold such a large army,\r\nhad been broken in the center of its line and driven back on its\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\n\"The 1st Battalion of the 7th Light Regiment, Major Vaissier, had the\r\nhonor to arrive first in the presence of the Russians, after moving\r\nthree kilometers on the run. Received by the enthusiastic cheers of\r\nthe English, it formed for battle, then carried away by burning cries\r\nof 'Forward, with the bayonet' from its brave major it threw itself\r\nheadlong, on the Russian columns, which broke.\r\n\r\n\"For two hours the 1st Battalion of the 7th Light Regiment, a\r\nbattalion of the 6th Line Regiment, four companies of the 3rd\r\nBattalion of foot chasseurs, five companies of Algerian chasseurs held\r\nthe head of the Russian army which continued to debouch in massed\r\ncolumns from the ravine and plateau of Inkermann.\r\n\r\n\"Three times the battalion of the 7th Light Regiment was obliged to\r\nfall back some paces to rally. Three times it charged with the\r\nbayonet, with the same ardor and success.\r\n\r\n\"At four in the afternoon the Russians were in rout, and were pursued\r\ninto the valley of Inkermann.\r\n\r\n\"On this memorable day all the officers, non-commissioned officers and\r\nsoldiers of the 7th Light Regiment performed their duty nobly,\r\nrivalling each other in bravery and self-sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nSecond: Notes on Inkermann, which Colonel A. du Picq indicates come\r\nfrom the letters of Captain B---- (these letters are missing).\r\n\r\n\"In what formation were the Russians? In column, of which the head\r\nfired, and whose platoons tried to get from behind the mead to enter\r\ninto action?\r\n\r\n\"When Major Vaissier advanced was he followed by every one? At what\r\ndistance? In what formation were the attackers? in disordered masses?\r\nin one rank? in two? in mass? Did the Russians immediately turn tail,\r\nreceiving shots and the bayonet in the back? did they fall back on the\r\nmass which itself was coming up? What was the duration of this attack\r\nagainst a mass, whose depth prevented its falling back?\r\n\r\n\"Did we receive bayonet wounds?\r\n\r\n\"Did we fall back before the active reaction of the mass or merely\r\nbecause, after the first shock, the isolated soldiers fell back to\r\nfind companions and with them a new confidence?\r\n\r\n\"Was the second charge made like the first one? Was the 6th Line\r\nRegiment engaged as the first support of the 7th Light Regiment? How\r\nwere the Zouaves engaged?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The Battle of Magenta\r\n\r\nExtract from the correspondence of Colonel Ardant du Picq. Letters\r\nfrom Captain C----, dated August 23, 1868.\r\n\r\n\"At Magenta I was in Espinasse's division, of Marshal MacMahon's\r\ncorps. This division was on the extreme left of the troops that had\r\npassed the Ticino at Turbigo and was moving on Magenta by the left\r\nbank. Close to the village a fusillade at close range apprised us that\r\nthe enemy was before us. The country, covered with trees, hedges, and\r\nvines, had hidden them.\r\n\r\n\"Our 1st Battalion and the 2nd Foreign Regiment drove the Austrians\r\ninto Magenta.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of Zouaves, with which I was,\r\nremained in reserve, arms stacked, under control of the division\r\ncommander. Apparently quite an interval had been left between\r\nEspinasse's division and la Motterouge's, the 1st of the corps, and,\r\nat the moment of engagement, at least an Austrian brigade had entered\r\nthe gap, and had taken in flank and rear the elements of our division\r\nengaged before Magenta. Happily the wooded country concealed the\r\nsituation or I doubt whether our troops engaged would have held on as\r\nthey did. At any rate the two reserve battalions had not moved. The\r\nfusillade extended to our right and left as if to surround us; bullets\r\nalready came from our right flank. The General had put five guns in\r\nfront of us, to fire on the village, and at the same time I received\r\nthe order to move my section to the right, to drive off the invisible\r\nenemy who was firing on us. I remember that I had quit the column with\r\nmy section when I saw a frightened artillery captain run toward us,\r\ncrying 'General, General, we are losing a piece!' The general\r\nanswered, 'Come! Zouaves, packs off.' At these words, the two\r\nbattalions leaped forward like a flock of sheep, dropping packs\r\neverywhere. The Austrians were not seen at first. It was only after\r\nadvancing for an instant that they were seen. They were already\r\ndragging off the piece that they had taken. At the sight of them our\r\nmen gave a yell and fell on them. Surprise and terror so possessed the\r\nAustrians, who did not know that we were so near, that they ran\r\nwithout using their arms. The piece was retaken; the regimental\r\nstandard was captured by a man in my company. About two hundred\r\nprisoners were taken, and the Austrian regiment--Hartmann's 9th\r\nInfantry--was dispersed like sheep in flight, five battalions of them.\r\nI believe that had the country not been thick the result might have\r\nbeen different. The incident lasted perhaps ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\"The two battalions took up their first position. They had had no\r\nlosses, and their morale was in the clouds. After about an hour\r\nGeneral Espinasse put himself at the head of the two battalions and\r\nmarched us on the village. We were in column of platoons with section\r\nintervals. The advance was made by echelon, the 2nd Battalion in\r\nfront, the 3rd a little in rear, and a company in front deployed as\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\n\"At one hundred and fifty paces from the Austrians, wavering was\r\nevident in their lines; the first ranks threw themselves back on those\r\nin rear. At that instant the general ordered again, 'Come! Packs off.\r\nAt the double!' Everybody ran forward, shedding his pack where he was.\r\n\r\n\"The Austrians did not wait for us. We entered the village mixed up\r\nwith them. The fighting in houses lasted quite a while. Most of the\r\nAustrians retired. Those who remained in the houses had to surrender.\r\nI found myself, with some fifty officers and men, in a big house from\r\nwhich we took four hundred men and five officers, Colonel Hauser for\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion is that we were very lucky at Magenta. The thick country\r\nin which we fought, favored us in hiding our inferior number from the\r\nAustrians. I do not believe we would have succeeded so well in open\r\ncountry. In the gun episode the Austrians were surprised, stunned.\r\nThose whom we took kept their arms in their hands, without either\r\nabandoning them or using them. It was a typical Zouave attack, which,\r\nwhen it succeeds, has astonishing results; but if one is not lucky it\r\nsometimes costs dearly. Note the 3rd Zouaves at Palestro, the 1st\r\nZouaves at Marignano. General Espinasse's advance on the village, at\r\nthe head of two battalions, was the finest and most imposing sight I\r\nhave ever seen. Apart from that advance, the fighting was always by\r\nskirmishers and in large groups.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The Battle of Solferino\r\n\r\nExtract from the correspondence of Colonel Ardant du Picq. Letters\r\nfrom Captain C----.\r\n\r\n\"The 55th infantry was part of the 3rd division of the 4th corps.\r\n\r\n\"Coming out of Medole, the regiment was halted on the right of the\r\nroad and formed, as each company arrived, in close column. Fascines\r\nwere made.\r\n\r\n\"An aide-de-camp came up and gave an order to the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"The regiment was then put on the road, marched some yards and formed\r\nin battalion masses on the right of the line of battle. This movement\r\nwas executed very regularly although bullets commenced to find us.\r\nArms were rested, and we stayed there, exposed to fire, without doing\r\nanything, not even sending out a skirmisher. For that matter, during\r\nthe whole campaign, it seemed to me that the skirmisher school might\r\nnever have existed.\r\n\r\n\"Then up came a Major of Engineers, from General Niel, to get a\r\nbattalion from the regiment. The 3rd battalion being on the left\r\nreceived the order to march. The major commanding ordered 'by the left\r\nflank,' and we marched by the flank, in close column, in the face of\r\nthe enemy, up to Casa-Nova Farm, I believe, where General Niel was.\r\n\r\n\"The battalion halted a moment, faced to the front, and closed a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\"'Stay here,' said General Niel; 'you are my only reserve!'\r\n\r\n\"Then the general, glancing in front of the farm, said to the major,\r\nafter one or two minutes, 'Major, fix bayonets, sound the charge, and\r\nforward!'\r\n\r\n\"This last movement was still properly executed at the start, and for\r\nabout one hundred yards of advance.\r\n\r\n\"Shrapnel annoyed the battalion, and the men shouldered arms to march\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\"At about one hundred yards from the farm, the cry 'Packs down,' came\r\nfrom I do not know where. The cry was instantly repeated in the\r\nbattalion. Packs were thrown down, anywhere, and with wild yells the\r\nadvance was renewed, in the wildest disorder.\r\n\r\n\"From that moment, and for the rest of the day, the 3rd Battalion as a\r\nunit disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Toward the end of the day, after an attempt had been made to get the\r\nregiment together, and at the end of half an hour of backing and\r\nfilling, there was a roll-call.\r\n\r\n\"The third company of grenadiers had on starting off in the morning\r\none hundred and thirty-two to one hundred and thirty-five present. At\r\nthis first roll-call, forty-seven answered, a number I can swear to,\r\nbut many of the men were still hunting packs and rations. The next day\r\nat reveille roll-call, ninety-three or four answered. Many came back\r\nin the night.\r\n\r\n\"This was the strength for many days I still remember, for I was\r\ncharged with company supply from June 25th.\r\n\r\n\"As additional bit of information--it was generally known a few days\r\nlater that at least twenty men of the 4th company of grenadiers were\r\nnever on the field of battle. Wounded of the company, returned for\r\ntransport to Medole, said later that they had seen some twenty of the\r\ncompany together close to Medole, lying in the grass while their\r\ncomrades fought. They even gave some names, but could not name them\r\nall. The company had only been formed for the war on April 19th, and\r\nhad received that same day forty-nine new grenadiers and twenty-nine\r\nat Milan, which made seventy-eight recruits in two months. None of\r\nthese men were tried or punished. Their comrades rode them hard, that\r\nwas all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Mentana\r\n\r\nExtract from the correspondence of Colonel Ardant du Picq. Letters\r\nfrom Captain C----, dated August 23, 1868.\r\n\r\n\"November 3, at two in the morning, we took up arms to go to\r\nMonte-Rotondo. We did not yet know that we would meet the Garibaldians\r\nat Mentana.\r\n\r\n\"The Papal army had about three thousand men, we about two thousand\r\nfive hundred. At one o'clock the Papal forces met their enemies. The\r\nZouaves attacked vigorously, but the first engagements were without\r\ngreat losses on either side. There is nothing particular in this first\r\nepisode. The usual thing happened, a force advances and is not halted\r\nby the fire of its adversary who ends by showing his heels. The papal\r\nZouaves are marked by no ordinary spirit. In comparing them with the\r\nsoldiers of the Antibes legion, one is forced to the conclusion that\r\nthe man who fights for an idea fights better than one who fights for\r\nmoney. At each advance of the papal forces, we advanced also. We were\r\nnot greatly concerned about the fight, we hardly thought that we would\r\nhave to participate, not dreaming that we could be held by the\r\nvolunteers. However, that did not happen.\r\n\r\n\"It was about three o'clock. At that time three companies of the\r\nbattalion were employed in protecting the artillery--three or four\r\npieces placed about the battle-field. The head of the French column\r\nwas then formed by the last three companies of the battalion, one of\r\nthe 1st Line Regiment; the other regiments were immediately behind.\r\nColonel Fremont of the 1st Line Regiment, after having studied the\r\nbattle-field, took two chasseur companies, followed by a battalion of\r\nhis regiment and bore to the right to turn the village.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the 1st Line Regiment moved further to the right in the\r\ndirection of Monte-Rotondo, against which at two different times it\r\nopened a fire at will which seemed a veritable hurricane. Due to the\r\ndistance or to the terrain the material result of the fire seemed to\r\nbe negligible. The moral result must have been considerable, it\r\nprecipitated a flood of fugitives on the road from Mentana to\r\nMonte-Rotondo, dominated by our sharpshooters, who opened on the\r\nfugitives a fire more deadly than that of the chassepots. We stayed in\r\nthe same position until night, when we retired to a position near\r\nMentana, where we bivouacked.\r\n\r\n\"My company was one of the two chasseur companies which attacked on\r\nthe right with the 1st Line Regiment. My company had ninety-eight\r\nrifles (we had not yet received the chassepots). It forced the\r\nvolunteers from solidly held positions where they left a gun and a\r\nconsiderable number of rifles. In addition, it put nearly seventy men\r\nout of action, judging by those who remained on the field. It had one\r\nman slightly wounded, a belt and a carbine broken by bullets.\r\n\r\n\"There remained with the general, after our movement to the right,\r\nthree companies of chasseurs, a battalion of the 29th, and three of\r\nthe 59th. I do not include many elements of the Papal army which had\r\nnot been engaged. Some of my comrades told me of having been engaged\r\nwith a chasseur company of the 59th in a sunken road, whose sides had\r\nnot been occupied; the general was with this column. Having arrived\r\nclose to the village, some shots either from the houses or from enemy\r\nsharpshooters, who might easily have gotten on the undefended flanks,\r\nprovoked a terrible fusillade in the column. In spite of the orders\r\nand efforts of the officers, everybody fired, at the risk of killing\r\neach other, and this probably happened. It was only when some men, led\r\nby officers, were able to climb the sides of the road that this firing\r\nceased. I do not think that this was a well understood use of new\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"The fusillade of the 1st Line Regiment against Monte-Rotondo was not\r\nvery effective, I believe negligible. I do not refer to the moral\r\nresult, which was great.\r\n\r\n\"The Garibaldians were numerous about Monte-Rotondo. But the terrain\r\nlike all that around Italian villages was covered with trees, hedges,\r\netc. Under these conditions, I believe that the fire of sharpshooters\r\nwould have been more effective than volleys, where the men estimate\r\ndistances badly and do not aim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: General Daumas (Manners and Customs of Algeria).

They were\r\nbut a swarm of flies that always harasses and kills at the least\r\nmistake; elusive and perfect for a long pursuit and the massacre of\r\nthe vanquished to whom the Numidians gave neither rest nor truce.

In the battle of Pharsalus, the advice\r\ngiven by Triarius to Pompey's army, a counsel which was followed and\r\nwhich was from a man of experience, who had seen things close at hand,\r\nshows that the shock, the physical impulse of the mass was a by-word.\r\nThey knew what to think of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The individual advance, in modern battle, in the midst of blind\r\nprojectiles that do not choose, is much less dangerous than in ancient\r\ntimes, because it seldom goes up to the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt Pharsalus, the volunteer Crastinius, an old centurion, moved ahead\r\nwith about a hundred men, saying to Caesar: \"I am going to act,\r\ngeneral, in such a way that, living or dead, to-day you may have cause\r\nto be proud of me.\"\r\n\r\nCaesar, to whom these examples of blind devotion to his person were\r\nnot displeasing, and whose troops had shown him that they were too\r\nmature, too experienced, to fear the contagion of this example, let\r\nCrastinius and his companions go out to be killed.\r\n\r\nSuch blind courage influences the action of the mass that follows.\r\nProbably for that reason, Caesar permitted it. But against reliable\r\ntroops, as the example of Crastinius proves, to move ahead in this\r\nway, against the enemy, is to go to certain death.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The men of the maniple, of the Roman company, mutually gave\r\ntheir word never to leave ranks, except to pick up an arrow, to save a\r\ncomrade (a Roman citizen), or to kill an enemy.

The\r\nattack of the Swiss in a formation was ineffective, and they were\r\nthreatened with envelopment. But Arnold von Winkelried created a gap;\r\nthe Swiss penetrated and the massacre followed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: See Appendix II. (Historical documents.)

But what we find in the works of the best military\r\nauthorities, from Montecuculli to Marshal Saxe, is general opposition\r\nto the replacement of the pike by the rifle. All predicted the\r\nabandonment of the rifle for the pike, and the future always proved\r\nthem wrong. They ignored experience. They could not understand that\r\nstronger than all logic is the instinct of man, who prefers long\r\nrange to close fighting, and who, having the rifle would not let it\r\ngo, but continually improved it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The danger arising from this kind of fire, led to proposals\r\nto put the smallest men in the front rank, the tallest in the rear\r\nrank.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Nothing is more difficult than to estimate range; in nothing is\r\nthe eye more easily deceived. Practice and the use of instruments\r\ncannot make a man infallible. At Sebastopol, for two months, a\r\ndistance of one thousand to twelve hundred meters could not be\r\ndetermined by the rifle, due to inability to see the shots. For\r\nthree months it was impossible to measure by ranging shots, although\r\nall ranges were followed through, the distance to a certain battery\r\nwhich was only five hundred meters away, but higher and separated from\r\nus by a ravine. One day, after three months, two shots at five hundred\r\nmeters were observed in the target. This distance was estimated by\r\neverybody as over one thousand meters; it was only five hundred. The\r\nvillage taken and the point of observation changed, the truth became\r\nevident.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: His war instructions prove this. His best generals, Zieten,\r\nWarnery, knew of such methods, saw nothing practicable in them and\r\nguarded against them in war as indeed he did himself. But Europe\r\nbelieved him, tried to imitate his maneuvers on the field of battle,\r\nand aligned her troops to be beaten by him. This is what he was after.\r\nHe even deceived the Prussians. But they came back to sound methods\r\nafter 1808, in 1813 and afterwards.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: It is noted here that French uniforms are of an absurd color,\r\nserving only to take the eye at a review. So the chasseurs, in black,\r\nare seen much further than a rifleman of the line in his gray coat.\r\nThe red trousers are seen further than the gray--thus gray ought\r\nto be the basic color of the infantry uniform, above all that of\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\nAt night fall the Russians came up to our trenches without being seen\r\nby any one, thanks to their partridge-gray coats.]",
