While wandering through the famed and picturesque land\r\nof the Hellenes, rejoicing in the countless beauties of the islands of\r\nthe Ionian and Aegean seas or scaling the heights of Helicon and\r\nParnassus, all so redolent of the storied past, I saw on every side\r\ntangible evidence of that marvelous race of men and women whose\r\nmatchless achievements have been the delight and inspiration of the\r\nworld for nearly three thousand years. But it was especially while\r\ncontemplating, from the portico of the Parthenon, the magnificent vista\r\nwhich there meets the charmed vision, that I first fully experienced the\r\nspell of the favored land of Hellas, so long the home of beauty and of\r\nintellect. The scene before me was indeed enchanting beyond expression;\r\nfor, every ruin, every marble column, every rock had its history, and\r\nevoked the most precious memories of men of godlike thoughts and of\r\n\r\n    \"A thousand glorious actions that may claim\r\n    Triumphal laurels and immortal fame.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a tranquil and balmy night in midsummer. The sun, leaving a\r\ngorgeous afterglow, had about an hour before disappeared behind the\r\nazure-veiled mountains of Ithaca, where, in the long ago, lived and\r\nloved the hero and the heroine of the incomparable Odyssey. The full\r\nmoon, just rising above the plain of Marathon, intensified the witchery\r\nof that memorable spot consecrated by the valor of patriots battling\r\nvictoriously against the invading hordes of Asia. Hard by was the\r\nAreopagus, where St. Paul preached to the \"superstitious\" Athenians on\r\n\"The Unknown God.\" Almost adjoining it was the Agora, where Socrates was\r\nwont to hold converse with noble and simple on the sublimest questions\r\nwhich can engage the human mind. Not distant was the site of the\r\ncelebrated \"Painted Porch,\" where Zeno developed his famous system of\r\nethics. In another quarter were the shady walks of the Lyceum, where\r\nAristotle, \"the master of those who know,\" lectured before an admiring\r\nconcourse of students from all parts of Hellas. Farther afield, on the\r\nbanks of the Cephissus, was the grove of Academus, where the divine\r\nPlato expounded that admirable idealism which, with Aristotelianism, has\r\ncontrolled the progress of speculative thought for more than twenty\r\ncenturies, and enunciated those admirable doctrines which have become\r\nthe common heritage of humanity.\r\n\r\nBut where, in this venerable city--\"the eye of Greece, mother of arts\r\nand eloquence\"--was the abode of Aspasia, the wife of Pericles and the\r\ninspirer of the noblest minds of the Golden Age of Grecian civilization?\r\nWhere was that salon, renowned these four and twenty centuries as the\r\nmost brilliant court of culture the world has ever known, wherein this\r\ngifted and accomplished daughter of Miletus gathered about her the most\r\nlearned men and women of her time? Whatever the location, there it was\r\nthat the wit and talent of Attica found a congenial trysting-place, and\r\nhuman genius burst into fairest blossom. There it was that poets,\r\nsculptors, painters, orators, philosophers, statesmen were all equally\r\nat home. There Socrates discoursed on philosophy; there Euripides and\r\nSophocles read their plays; there Anaxagoras dilated upon the nature and\r\nconstitution of the universe; there Phidias, the greatest sculptor of\r\nall time, and Ictinus and Callicrates unfolded their plans for that\r\nsupreme creation of architecture, the temple of Athena Parthenos on the\r\nAcropolis. Like Michaelangelo, long centuries afterwards, who \"saw with\r\nthe eyes and acted by the inspiration\" of Vittoria Colonna, these\r\nmasters of Greek architecture and sculpture saw with the eyes and acted\r\nby the sublime promptings of Aspasia, who was the greatest patron and\r\ninspirer of men of genius the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nI felt then, as I feel now, that this superb monument to the virgin\r\ngoddess of wisdom and art and science was in great measure a monument to\r\nthe one who by her quick intelligence, her profound knowledge, her\r\ninspiration, her patronage, her influence, had so much to do with its\r\nerection--the wise, the cultured, the richly dowered Aspasia.\r\n\r\nThis thought it was that started the train of reflections on the\r\nintellectual achievements of women which eventually gave rise to the\r\nidea of writing a book on woman's work in things of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe following day, as I was entering the University of Athens, I noticed\r\nabove the stately portal a large and beautiful painting which, on\r\ninspection, proved, to my great delight, to be nothing less than a\r\npictorial representation of my musings the night before on the portico\r\nof the Parthenon. For there was Aspasia, just as I had fancied her in\r\nher salon, seated beside Pericles, and surrounded by the greatest and\r\nthe wisest men of Greece. \"This,\" I exclaimed, \"shall be the\r\nfrontispiece of my book; it will tell more than many pages of text.\" Nor\r\ndid I rest till I had procured a copy of this excellent work of art.\r\n\r\nShortly after my journey through Greece I visited the chief cities and\r\ntowns of Italy. I traversed the whole of Magna Graecia and, to enjoy the\r\nlocal color of things Grecian and breathe, as far as might be, the\r\natmosphere which once enveloped the world's greatest thinkers, I stood\r\non the spot in Syracuse where Plato discoursed on the true, the\r\nbeautiful and the good, before enthusiastic audiences of men and women,\r\nand wandered through the land inhabited by the ancient Bruttii, where\r\nPythagoras has his famous school of science and philosophy--a school\r\nwhich was continued after the founder's death by his celebrated wife,\r\nTheano. For in Crotona, as well as in Athens, and in Alexandria in the\r\ntime of Hypatia, women were teachers as well as scholars, and attained\r\nto marked distinction in every branch of intellectual activity.\r\n\r\nAs I visited, one after the other, what were once the great centers of\r\nlearning and culture in Magna Graecia, the idea of writing the book\r\naforementioned appealed to me more strongly from day to day, but it did\r\nnot assume definite form until after I had tarried for some weeks or\r\nmonths in each of the great university towns of Italy. And as I wended\r\nmy way through the almost deserted streets of Salerno, which was for\r\ncenturies one of the noblest seats of learning in Christendom, and\r\nrecalled the achievements of its gifted daughters--those wonderful\r\n_mulieres Salernitanae_, whose praises were once sounded throughout\r\nEurope, but whose names have been almost forgotten--I began to realize,\r\nas never before, that women of intellectual eminence have received too\r\nlittle credit for their contributions to the progress of knowledge, and\r\nshould have a sympathetic historian of what they have achieved in the\r\ndomain of learning.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until after I had visited the great university towns of\r\nBologna, Padua and Pavia, had become more familiar with their\r\nfascinating histories and traditions, and surveyed there the scenes of\r\nthe great scholastic triumphs of women as students and professors, that\r\nI fully realized the importance, if not the necessity, of such a work as\r\nI had in contemplation. For then, as when standing in silent meditation\r\non the pronaos of the Parthenon, the past seemed to become present, and\r\nthe graceful figures of those illustrious daughters of _Italia la\r\nBella_, who have conferred such honor on both their country and on\r\nwomankind throughout the world, seemed to flit before me as they\r\nreturned to and from their lecture halls and laboratories, where their\r\ndiscourses, in flowing Latin periods, had commanded the admiration and\r\nthe applause of students from every European country, from the Rock of\r\nCashel to the Athenian Acropolis.\r\n\r\nOnly then did the magnitude and the difficulty of my self-imposed task\r\nbegin to dawn upon me. I saw that it would be impossible, if I were to\r\ndo justice to the subject, to compass in a single volume anything like\r\nan adequate account of the contributions of women to the advancement of\r\ngeneral knowledge. I accordingly resolved to restrict my theme and\r\nconfine myself to an attempt to show what an important role women have\r\nplayed in the development of those branches of knowledge in which they\r\nare usually thought to have had but little part.\r\n\r\nThe subject of my book thus, by a process of elimination, narrowed its\r\nscope to woman's achievements in science. Many works in various\r\nlanguages had been written on what women had accomplished in art,\r\nliterature, and state-craft, and there was, therefore, no special call\r\nfor a new volume on any of these topics. But, with the exception of a\r\nfew brief monographs in German, French and Italian, and an occasional\r\nmagazine article here and there, practically nothing had been written\r\nabout woman in science. The time, then, seemed opportune for entering\r\nupon a field that had thus far been almost completely neglected; and,\r\nalthough I soon discovered that the labor involved would be far greater\r\nthan I had anticipated, I never lost sight of the work which had its\r\nvirtual inception in the peerless sanctuary of Pallas Athena in the\r\n\"City of the Violet Crown.\"\r\n\r\nDuties and occupations innumerable have retarded the progress of the\r\nwork. But not the least cause of delay has been the difficulty of\r\nlocating the material essential to the production of a volume that would\r\ndo even partial justice to the numerous topics requiring treatment. My\r\nexperience, _parva componere magnis_, was not unlike that of Dr.\r\nJohnson, who tells us in the preface to his _Dictionary of the English\r\nLanguage_, \"I saw that one inquiry only gave occasion to another, that\r\nbook referred to book, that to search was not always to find, and that\r\nthus to pursue perfection was, like the first inhabitants of Arcadia, to\r\nchase the sun, which, when they reached the hill where he seemed to\r\nrest, was still beheld at the same distance from them.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I have endeavored to give a place in this work to all women who\r\nhave achieved special distinction in science, it is not unlikely that I\r\nmay have inadvertently overlooked some, particularly among those of\r\nrecent years, who were deserving of mention. Should this be the case, I\r\nshall be grateful for information which will enable me to correct such\r\noversights and render the volume, should there be a demand for more than\r\none edition, more complete and serviceable. And, although I have striven\r\nto be as accurate as possible in all my statements, I can scarcely hope,\r\nin traversing so broad a field, to have been wholly successful. For all\r\nshortcomings, whether through omission or commission,\r\n\r\n          \"Quas aut incuria fudit,\r\n    Aut humana parum cavit natura,\"\r\n\r\nI crave the reader's indulgence, and trust that the present volume will\r\nhave at least the merit of stimulating some ambitious young Whewell to\r\nexplore more thoroughly the interesting field that I have but partially\r\nreconnoitred, and give us ere long an adequate and comprehensive history\r\nof the achievements of woman, not only in the inductive but in all the\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\n      I.

I\r\nshall relate how, in every department of natural knowledge, when not\r\ninhibited by her environment, she has been the colleague and the\r\nemulatress, if not the peer, of the most illustrious men who have\r\ncontributed to the increase and diffusion of human learning. But a\r\nproper understanding of this subject seems to require some preliminary\r\nsurvey of the many and diverse obstacles which, in every age of the\r\nworld's history, have opposed woman's advancement in general knowledge.\r\nWithout such preliminary survey it is impossible to realize the\r\nintensity of her age-long struggle for freedom and justice in things of\r\nthe mind or fully to appreciate the comparative liberty and advantages\r\nshe now enjoys in almost every department of intellectual activity.\r\nNeither could one understand why woman's achievements in science,\r\ncompared with those of men, have been so few and of so small import,\r\nespecially in times past, or why it is that, as a student of nature or\r\nas an investigator in the various realms of pure and applied science, we\r\nhear so little of her before the second half of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nTo exhibit the nature of the difficulties woman has had to contend with\r\nin every age and in every land, in order to secure what we now consider\r\nher inalienable rights to things of the mind, it is not necessary to\r\nreview the history of female education, or to enter into the details of\r\nher gradual progress forward and upward in the New and Old Worlds. But\r\nit is necessary that we should know what was the attitude of mankind\r\ntoward woman's education during the leading epochs of the world's\r\nhistory and what were, until almost our own day, the opinions of\r\nmen--scholars and rulers included--respecting the nature and the duties\r\nof woman and what was considered, almost by all, her proper sphere of\r\naction. Understanding the numerous and cruel handicaps which she had so\r\nlong to endure, the opposition to her aspirations which she had to\r\nencounter, even during the most enlightened periods of the world's\r\nhistory, and that, too, from those who should have been the first to\r\nextend to her a helping hand, we can the better appreciate the extent of\r\nher recent intellectual enfranchisement and of the value of the work she\r\nhas accomplished since she has been free to exercise those God-given\r\nfaculties which were so long held in restraint.\r\n\r\nThe first great bar to the mental development of woman was the assumed\r\nsuperiority of the male sex, the opinion, so generally accepted, that,\r\nin the scheme of creation, woman was but \"an accident, an imperfection,\r\nan error of nature\"; that she was either a slave conducing to man's\r\ncomfort, or, at best, a companion ministering to his amusement and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times she was regarded as man's inferior and relegated\r\nto a subordinate position in society. She was, so it was averred, but a\r\ndiminutive man--a kind of mean between the lord of creation and the rest\r\nof the animal kingdom. By some she was considered a kind of half man; by\r\nothers, as was cynically asserted, she was looked upon as a _mas\r\noccasionatus_--a man marred in the making. She was, both mentally and\r\nphysically, what Spencer would call a man whose evolution had been\r\narrested, while man, as in the modern language of Darwin, was a woman,\r\nwhose evolution had been completed.\r\n\r\nWhen such views prevailed, it was inevitable that, so long as physical\r\nforce was the _force majeure_, a woman should be relegated to the\r\nposition of a slave or to that of \"a mere glorified toy.\" Every man then\r\nsaid, in effect, if not in words, of the woman who happened to be in his\r\npower what Petruchio said of Katherine:\r\n\r\n    \"I will be master of what is mine own,\r\n    She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,\r\n    My household stuff, my field, my barn,\r\n    My horse, my ox, my ass, my everything.\"\r\n\r\nEven after civilization had superseded savagery and barbarism, it was\r\nstill inevitable, so long as such views found acceptance, that woman\r\nshould continue to be held in vassalage and ignorance and to suffer all\r\nthe disabilities and privations of \"the lesser man.\" She was studiously\r\nexcluded from civic and social functions and compelled to pass her life\r\nin the restricted quarters of the harem or gyneceum. This was the case\r\namong the Athenians, as well as among other peoples; for, during the\r\nmost brilliant period of their history, women, when not slaves or\r\nhetaerae, were considered simply child-bearers or housekeepers.[1] A\r\ngirl's education, when she received any at all, was limited to reading,\r\nwriting and music, and for a knowledge of these subjects she was\r\ndependent on her mother. From her earliest years the Athenian maiden was\r\nmade to realize that the great fountains of knowledge, which were\r\nalways available for her brothers, were closed to her. Her duty was to\r\nbecome proficient in the use of the needle and the distaff, and, later\r\non, to learn how to embroider, to ply the loom and make garments for\r\nherself and for the other members of her family.\r\n\r\nUntil she was seven years old, she was brought up with her brothers\r\nunder the eye of her mother. During this period of childhood she had a\r\ncertain amount of freedom, but, after her seventh year, she was kept in\r\nthe gyneconitis--women's quarters--\"under the strictest restraint, in\r\norder,\" as Xenophon informs us in his _Oeconomicus_, \"that she might\r\nsee as little, hear as little and ask as few questions as possible.\" On\r\nrare occasions she was permitted to be a spectator at a religious\r\nprocession, or to take part in certain of the choral dances that\r\nconstituted so important a part in the religious ceremonies of ancient\r\nGreece. Whether in public or in private, silence was always considered\r\nan imperative duty for a woman.\r\n\r\nBut more than this. Not only was she expected to observe silence\r\nherself, but she was also expected so to conduct herself that no one\r\nwould have occasion to speak about her. Pericles, in a celebrated\r\ndiscourse, gave expression to the prevailing opinion regarding this\r\nphase of female excellence when, on a notable occasion, he addressed to\r\na certain number of women the following words: \"Great will be your glory\r\nin not falling short of your natural character; and greatest will be\r\nhers who is least talked of among men whether for good or for evil.\"[2]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing observations it will be seen that the general\r\nattitude of the Athenians toward woman was anything but favorable to her\r\nintellectual development, or to her exerting any influence beyond the\r\nlimits of her own household. And what is said of the Greeks can be\r\naffirmed, with still greater emphasis, of the other nations of\r\nantiquity. Indeed, it can be safely asserted that, had they all entered\r\ninto a solemn compact systematically to discredit woman's mental\r\ncapacity and to repress all her noblest aspirations, they could not have\r\nsucceeded more effectually than by the methods they severally adopted.\r\nIn ancient Greece the condition of woman was little better than it is in\r\nIndia to-day under the law of Manu, where the husband, no matter how\r\nunworthy he may be, must be regarded by the wife as a god.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding the dominant force of public opinion and the\r\nstrange traditional prejudices that possessed for the majority of people\r\nall the semblance and commanding power of truth, woman was here and\r\nthere able to break through the barriers that impeded her progress in\r\nher quest of knowledge and to defy the social conventions that precluded\r\nher from being seen or heard in the intellectual arena.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most notable of Greek women to assert her\r\nindependence and to emerge from the intellectual eclipse which had so\r\nlong kept her sex in obscurity, was the Lesbian Sappho, who, as a lyric\r\npoet, stands, even to-day, without a superior. So great was her renown\r\namong the ancients that she was called \"The Poetess,\" as Homer was\r\ncalled \"The Poet.\" Solon, on hearing one of her songs sung at a banquet,\r\nbegged the singer to teach it to him at once that he might learn it and\r\ndie. Aristotle did not hesitate to endorse a judgment that ranked her\r\nwith Homer and Archilochus, while Plato, in his Phaedrus, exalts her\r\nstill higher by proclaiming her \"the tenth Muse.\" Horace and Ovid and\r\nCatullus strove to reproduce her passionate strains and rhythmic beauty;\r\nbut their efforts were little better than paraphrase and feeble\r\nimitation. Her features were stamped on coins, \"though she was but a\r\nwoman,\" and, after her death, altars were raised and temples erected in\r\nhonor of this \"flower of the Graces,\" of\r\n\r\n    \"That mighty songstress, whose unrivaled powers\r\n    Weave for the Muse a crown of deathless flowers.\"\r\n\r\nSecond only to the \"violet-crowned, pure, sweetly-smiling Sappho,\" as\r\nher rival, Alcaeus, calls her, were Gorgo, Andromeda and Corinna. The\r\nlast of these was the teacher of Pindar, the celebrated lyric poet, whom\r\nshe defeated five times in poetic contests in Thebes.[3] She was one of\r\nthe nine lyrical muses, corresponding to \"the celestial nine,\" who dwelt\r\non the sacred slopes of Helicon.[4] Telesilla and Praxilla were two\r\nothers. The last named was by her countrymen ranked with Anacreon.\r\n\r\nScarcely inferior to Corinna were those ardent pupils of Sappho, who had\r\nflocked from the sunny isles of the Aegean and the laurel-crowned hills\r\nof Greece around \"the fair-haired Lesbian\" in her island home, which\r\nwas, at the same time, a school of poetry and music. The most gifted of\r\nthese were Danophila, the Pamphylian, and Erinna, whose hexameters were\r\nsaid by the ancients to reveal a genius equal to that of Homer. She died\r\nat the early age of nineteen and has always excited a pathetic interest\r\nbecause, like so many others of her sex since her time--women and\r\nmaidens of the loftiest spiritual aspirations,--she was condemned to the\r\nspindle and the distaff when she wished to devote her life to the\r\nservice of the Muses. The following is her own epitaph:\r\n\r\n    \"These are Erinna's songs, how sweet, though slight!\r\n    For she was but a girl of nineteen years.\r\n    Yet stronger far than what most men can write;\r\n    Had death delayed, whose fame had equaled hers?\"\r\n\r\nNever before nor since did such a wave of feminine genius pass over the\r\nfragrant valleys and vine-clad plains of Greece. Never in any other\r\nplace or time shone so brilliant a galaxy of women of talent and\r\nimagination; never was there a more perfect flowering of female\r\nintelligence of the highest order. According to tradition, there\r\nappeared in the favored land of Hellas, when the entire population of\r\nthe country was not equal to that of a fair-sized modern city, within\r\nthe brief space of a century, no fewer than seventy-six women poets.\r\nWhen we remember that the Renaissance produced only about sixty female\r\npoets, though in a more extended territory and with a much larger\r\npopulation, and that none of them could approach the incomparable\r\nSappho, or even many of her pupils, in the perfection of their work, we\r\ncan realize the splendor of the achievements of the female intellect in\r\nthe Hellenic world during the golden age of feminine poetic art.[5]\r\n\r\nOne would think that this phenomenal outburst of mental vigor, and\r\nespecially the marvelous achievements of Sappho, Corinna and those of\r\ntheir pupils and followers, would have compelled the world for all\r\nsubsequent time to recognize the innate power of the female mind, and\r\nperceive the wisdom--not to say justice--of according to women the same\r\nadvantages for the development of their inborn gifts as were afforded to\r\nmen. They had proved that, under favorable conditions, there was\r\nessentially no difference between the male and the female intellect, and\r\nthat genius knows no sex. And this they demonstrated not only in poetry,\r\nbut also in philosophy and in other branches of human knowledge as well.\r\n\r\nAmong those who had especially distinguished themselves were Hipparchia,\r\nthe wife of the philosopher Crates; Themista, the wife of Leon and a\r\ncorrespondent of Epicurus, who was pronounced \"a sort of female Solon\";\r\nPerictione, a disciple of Pythagoras, who distinguished herself by her\r\nwritings on _Wisdom_ and _The Harmony of Woman_, and Leontium, a\r\ndisciple and companion of Epicurus, who wrote a work against\r\nTheophrastus, which was pronounced by Cicero a model of style.\r\n\r\nAnd was not the school of Pythagoras at Crotona continued after his\r\ndeath by his daughter and his wife, Theano? And did not this fact alone\r\nmanifest woman's capacity for abstract thought, as effectively as the\r\nLesbian school had demonstrated her talent for consummate verse?[6]\r\n\r\nBut it was all to no purpose. The comparative freedom and advantages\r\nwhich Sappho, Corinna and their friends had enjoyed was soon--for some\r\nreason scarcely comprehensible by us--taken from all the women of Greece\r\nexcept the peculiar class known in history as _hetaerae_--companions.\r\nThese we should now rank among the _demimonde_, but the Greek point of\r\nview was different from ours. The hetaerae were the friends and companions\r\nof the men who spent most of their time in public resorts, and they\r\naccompanied them to the gymnasium, to banquets, the games, to the\r\ntheater and other similar assemblies from which the wives and daughters\r\nof the Athenians, during the golden age of Greece, were rigorously\r\nexcluded. For so great was the seclusion in which the wives of the\r\nGreeks then lived that they never attended public spectacles and never\r\nleft the house, unless accompanied by a female slave. They were not\r\npermitted to see men except in the presence of their husbands, nor could\r\nthey have a seat even at their own tables, if their husbands happened to\r\nhave male guests.\r\n\r\nIt was by reason of this strict seclusion and the enforced ignorance to\r\nwhich they were subjected that we hear very little of the virtuous women\r\nof this period of Greek history. We have records of a few instances of\r\nfilial and conjugal affection, but, outside of this, the names of the\r\nwives and daughters of even the most distinguished citizens have long\r\nsince passed into oblivion. Only the hetaerae attracted public notice, and\r\nonly among them, during the period to which reference is now made, do we\r\nfind any women who achieved distinction by their intellectual\r\nattainments, or by the influence which they exerted over those with whom\r\nthey were associated.\r\n\r\nBut strange as it may appear, these extra-matrimonial connections, far\r\nfrom incurring the censure which they would now provoke, received the\r\ncordial recognition of both legislators and moralists, and even those\r\nwho were considered the most virtuous among men openly entered into\r\nthese relations without exposing themselves to the slightest stigma or\r\nreproach. Many of the hetaerae, contrary to what is sometimes thought,\r\nwere \"of highly moral character, temperate, thoughtful and earnest, and\r\nwere either unattached or attached to one man, and to all intents and\r\npurposes married. Even if they had two or three attachments but behaved\r\nin other respects with temperance and sobriety, such was the Greek\r\nfeeling in regard to their peculiar position that they did not bring\r\ndown upon themselves any censure from even the sternest of the Greek\r\nmoralists.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe most famous men of Greece, married as well as unmarried, had their\r\n\"companions,\" many of whom were as distinguished for their\r\naccomplishments as for their wit and beauty. Thus Epicurus had Leontium,\r\nMenander Glycera, Isocrates Metaneira, Aristotle Herpyllis, and Plato\r\nArchlanassa, while Aristippus, the philosopher, Diogenes, the cynic, and\r\nDemosthenes, the great orator, each had a companion bearing the name of\r\nLais.[8] More than this. So strongly had many of the hetaerae impressed\r\nthemselves on the esthetic sense of the beauty-loving Greeks that not a\r\nfew of them had statues erected in their honor, especially in Athens and\r\nCorinth, and thus shared in the honor that hitherto had been reserved\r\nexclusively for the goddess of beauty and love, fair Aphrodite.\r\n\r\nThe hetaerae from Ionia and Aetolia were particularly conspicuous for their\r\nintelligence and culture. And all of them, whencesoever they came,\r\nenjoyed unrestricted liberty and, unlike the wives of the citizens of\r\nAthens, had free access to the Portico and the Academy and the Lyceum,\r\nand were permitted to attend the lectures of the philosophers on the\r\nsame footing as the men. Thus, to mention only a few, Thais was a pupil\r\nof Alciphron, Nicarete of Stilpo, and Lasthenia of Plato.\r\n\r\nAnd so keen were their intellects and so marked was their progress in\r\nthe most abstract studies, that many of them were recognized as the most\r\ndistinguished pupils of their masters. This accounts, in part, for the\r\npopularity of their salons, at which were gathered the most eminent\r\nstatesmen, poets, artists, philosophers and orators of the day. The\r\nnearest approach in modern times to such trysting-places, where beauty,\r\nwit and talent found a congenial atmosphere, were the celebrated salons\r\nof Ninon de Lenclos, Mlle. de l'Espinasse and Mme. du Deffand. At these\r\nreunions were discussed, not only the news of the day, but also, and\r\nespecially, art, science, literature and politics, and always to the\r\nadvantage of both guests and hostesses.\r\n\r\nPossessing such freedom and enjoying such splendid opportunities for\r\nculture and intellectual advancement, it is not surprising that the\r\nhetaerae played so remarkable a role in the social and civic life of\r\nGreece, and that they were able to wield such influence over their\r\nassociates, and that they often attained even the highest royal honors.\r\nNor is it surprising to read in Plato's _Symposium_ the splendid tribute\r\nwhich Socrates renders to Diotima of Mantinea, when, in discussing the\r\ntrue nature of divine and eternal beauty, he speaks of her as his\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nMany of the hetaerae were not only the models but also the inspirers of\r\nthe most famous painters and sculptors of antiquity. Thus, Lais was the\r\ncompanion and inspirer of Apelles, the most noted painter of Greece,\r\nwhile Phryne, said to have been the most beautiful woman who ever lived,\r\nwas the inspirer of the peerless Praxitiles, who, in reproducing her\r\nform, succeeded in bequeathing to the world what was undoubtedly the\r\nmost lovely representation of \"the human form divine\" that ever came\r\nfrom a sculptor's chisel.[9]\r\n\r\nOn account of the relations of the hetaerae, especially those of the\r\nfourth and fifth centuries B.C., with the greatest men of their time,\r\nthe writers of antiquity thought them of sufficient importance to\r\npreserve their history. One author has left us an account of no fewer\r\nthan one hundred and thirty-five of them. But, of all those whose names\r\nhave come down to us, by far the most noted, accomplished and\r\ninfluential was the famous Aspasia of Miletus. In many respects she was\r\nthe most remarkable woman Greece ever produced. Of rare talent and\r\nculture, of extraordinary tact and finesse, of a fascinating personality\r\ncombined with the grace and sensibility of her sex, together with a\r\nmasculine power of intellect, \"this gracious Ionian,\" as has well been\r\nsaid, \"stands with Sappho on the pinnacle of Hellenic culture, each in\r\nher own field the highest feminine representative of an esthetic race.\"\r\n\r\nAt an early age she won the passionate love of the great statesman\r\nPericles, after which she entered upon that marvelous career which\r\nsecured for her a place in the front rank of the most eminent women of\r\nall time. \"Her house became the resort of all the great men of Athens.\r\nSocrates was often there. Phidias and Anaxagoras were intimate\r\nacquaintances, and probably Sophocles and Euripides were in constant\r\nattendance. Indeed, never had any woman such a salon in the whole\r\nhistory of man. The greatest sculptor that ever lived, the grandest man\r\nof all antiquity, philosophers and poets, sculptors and painters,\r\nstatesmen and historians, met each other and discussed congenial\r\nsubjects in her rooms. And probably hence has arisen the tradition that\r\nshe was the teacher of Socrates in philosophy and politics, and Pericles\r\nin rhetoric. Her influence was such as to stimulate men to their best,\r\nand they attributed to her all that was best in themselves. Aspasia\r\nseems especially to have thought earnestly on the duties and destiny of\r\nwomen. The cultivated men who thronged her assemblies had no hesitation\r\nin breaking through the conventionalities of Athenian society, and\r\nbrought their wives to the parties of Aspasia; and she discussed with\r\nthem the duties of wives. She thought they should be something more than\r\nmere mothers and housewives. She urged them to cultivate their minds,\r\nand be in all respects fit companions for their husbands.\"[10]\r\n\r\nShe is said to have written some of the best speeches of Pericles--among\r\nthem his noted funeral oration over those who had died in battle before\r\nthe walls of Potidaea. As to Socrates, he himself explicitly refers to\r\nher, in the _Memorabilia_, as his teacher. She is a notable character in\r\nthe Socratic dialogues and appears several times in those of Aeschines,\r\nwhile there is every reason to believe that she strongly influenced the\r\nviews of Plato, as expressed by him in the _Republic_ respecting the\r\nequality of woman with man.\r\n\r\nShe was continually consulted regarding affairs of state, and her\r\ninfluence in social and political matters was profound and far-reaching.\r\nThis is evidenced by the abuse heaped upon her by the comic dramatists\r\nof the time. Referring to the ascendancy which she had over Pericles,\r\nshe was called Dejanira, the wife of Hercules; Hera, the queen of the\r\ngods and wife of the Olympian Jove. It was asserted by her enemies that\r\nthe Samian war had been brought about at her instigation and that the\r\nPeloponnesian war had been undertaken to avenge an insult which had been\r\noffered her. These and similar statements which, when not absurd, were\r\ngreatly exaggerated, show the boundless influence she wielded over\r\nPericles, and what an important part she took in the government of\r\nGreece in the zenith of its glory.\r\n\r\nBut, however great her influence, we are warranted in asserting that it\r\nwas never exercised in an illegitimate manner. She was ever, as history\r\ninforms us, the good, the wise, the learned, the eloquent Aspasia. It\r\nwas her goodness, her wisdom, her rare and varied accomplishments, her\r\nclear insight and noble purposes that gave her the wonderful power she\r\npossessed and which enabled her, probably more than any one person, to\r\nmake the age of Pericles not only the most brilliant age of Greek\r\nhistory, but also the most brilliant age of all time.[11]\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the beneficent influence which Aspasia ever exerted\r\non those about her, notwithstanding the heroic efforts she had made to\r\nliberate her own sex from the restrictions that had so long harassed and\r\ndegraded it, the wives and daughters of the citizens of Athens were\r\nstill kept in almost absolute seclusion and denied the opportunities of\r\nmental culture which were so generously accorded the free-born hetaerae\r\nfrom Asia Minor and the islands of the Aegean. Socrates, as we learn from\r\nXenophon, asserted woman's equality with man, while Plato taught that\r\nmentally there was no essential difference between man and woman. He\r\nconcluded, accordingly, that women of talent should have the same\r\neducational advantages as men. In _The Republic_ as well as in the\r\n_Laws_, when he refers to education--which he would make compulsory for\r\n\"all and sundry, as far as possible\"--his views are far in advance of\r\nthose which have been entertained until the last half century. He would\r\nhave girls as well as boys thoroughly instructed in music and\r\ngymnastic--\"music for the mind and gymnastic for the body.\"[12]\r\n\r\nIn the _Laws_ he contends that \"women ought to share, as far as\r\npossible, in education and in other ways with men. For consider:--if\r\nwomen do not share in their whole life with men, then they must have\r\nsome other order of life.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he asserts \"Nothing can be more absurd than the practice which\r\nprevails in our own country of men and women not following the same\r\npursuits with all their strength and with one mind, for thus the state,\r\ninstead of being a whole, is reduced to a half.\"[13]\r\n\r\nIn _The Republic_ he expresses the same idea when he affirms that \"the\r\ngifts of nature are alike diffused in both\"--men and women--\"all the\r\npursuits of men are the pursuits of women.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThese opinions of Socrates and Plato are so at variance with those of\r\ntheir contemporaries, and so contrary to the custom that then obtained\r\nof excluding all but free-born hetaerae from the advantages of education\r\nand culture, that we cannot but think that they were due to the profound\r\ninfluence which had been exercised directly or indirectly by Aspasia on\r\nboth of these great philosophers. Be this as it may, neither the efforts\r\nof Aspasia nor the teachings of Socrates and Plato were able to remove\r\nthe bars to intellectual development from which the women of Greece had\r\nso long suffered. A change in customs and laws concerning the rigid,\r\noriental seclusion of women did not come until much later, and then it\r\nwas under a new regime--that of the Caesars--while complete equality of\r\nmen and women in school and college was not recognized until long\r\ncenturies afterward.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to speculate regarding what Greece would have become\r\nhad she developed her women as she developed her men. Never in the\r\nhistory of the world were there in any one city so many eminent\r\nmen--poets, orators, statesmen, painters, sculptors, architects,\r\nphilosophers--as in Athens, and yet not a single native-born Athenian\r\nwoman ever attained the least distinction in any department of art or\r\nscience or literature. We cannot conceive for a moment that Greece's\r\nfertility in great men and barrenness in great women was due to the fact\r\nthat the mothers of such illustrious men were ordinary housewives and\r\nentirely devoid of the talent and genius which gave immortality to their\r\ndistinguished sons. The careers of Aspasia and the achievements of\r\nSappho, Corinna, Myrtides, Erinna, Praxilla, Telesilla, Myrus, Anytae and\r\nNossidis, Theano and her daughter, to mention no others, absolutely\r\npreclude such an assumption.\r\n\r\nThe women in Greece, there can be no doubt about it, were as richly\r\nendowed by nature as were the men, and only lacked the opportunities\r\nthat men enjoyed to achieve, in every sphere of intellectual activity, a\r\ncorresponding measure of success. They were extraordinary types, these\r\nwomen of ancient Greece; for among them we find the dignified Roman\r\nmatron, the chatelaine of the Middle Ages, the brilliant woman of the\r\nRenaissance and the cultured mistress of the French _salon_. But all\r\ntheir talent, power and genius counted for naught.\r\n\r\nHad the civilization of Greece been a woman's civilization, as well as a\r\nman's civilization, had there been a federation of all the Greek states,\r\nas Aspasia seems to have striven for, instead of a number of small and\r\nindependent city-states; had the women of Hellas been allowed the same\r\nliberty of action in intellectual work as was granted to the Italian\r\nwomen during and after the revival of letters, and had they been\r\nencouraged to develop all their latent powers that were so\r\nsystematically suppressed, and to work in unison with the men for the\r\nwelfare and advancement of a united nation, it is difficult to imagine\r\nwhat a dazzling intellectual zenith a supremely gifted people, \"full\r\nsumm'd in all their powers,\" would have attained. Their capacity for\r\nwork and for achieving great things would have been doubled and their\r\npower as a political organization would have been practically\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\n\"We are the only women that bring forth men,\" said Gorgo, the wife of\r\nLeonidas. The Spartan mothers, who had more of liberty than their\r\nAthenian sisters, did, indeed, bring forth warriors of undying renown;\r\nbut it was the mothers of Athens who, notwithstanding all their\r\ngrievous disabilities, gave to the world all the greatest masters in\r\nart, literature, and philosophy--the men who through the ages have been\r\nthe leaders and the teachers of humanity, and who seem destined to hold\r\ntheir exalted position until the end of time.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the men of Greece to avail themselves of the immense\r\npotential power, which they always kept latent in their women, was the\r\noccasion of a terrible nemesis in the end. For this failure, coupled\r\nwith the frightful license introduced by a class of educated women, like\r\nthe hetaerae, without legal status or domestic ties, and the wave of\r\ncorruption that subsequently followed the advent of the countless\r\ndissolute women who flocked to the Hellenic cities from every part of\r\nthe East, paved the way for the nation's downfall and for its ultimate\r\nconquest by the resistless Roman legions that swept the once glorious\r\nbut ill-fated country of Pericles and Aspasia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN AND EDUCATION IN ANCIENT ROME\r\n\r\nThe condition of women in Rome, especially from 150 B.C. to 150 A.D.,\r\nwas quite different from what it was in Athens, even during her palmiest\r\ndays. Owing to the lack of authentic documents we know but little of the\r\nhistory of the Roman people during the first five hundred years of their\r\nexistence, but we do know that during this period many and important\r\nchanges were effected regarding the social and civil status of women.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the Roman matron had much more freedom than was\r\naccorded the Greek wife during the age of Pericles. Far from being kept\r\nin oriental seclusion, like her Athenian sister, she was at liberty to\r\nreceive and dine with the friends of her husband, and to appear in\r\npublic whenever she desired. She went to the theater and the Forum; she\r\ntook part in all reputable entertainment, whether public or private.\r\nBesides this, she had more and greater legal rights than Greek women\r\nhad ever known, and was treated rather as the peer and companion of man\r\nthan as his toy or his slave.\r\n\r\nBesides this, foreign women were never so conspicuous in Rome as in\r\nAthens. Even after Greece had become a Roman province, and after _Graecia\r\ncapta Romam cepit_--when Greek ideas and Greek customs were introduced\r\ninto the capital of the Roman world--it was still the Roman matron that\r\nwas supreme. And, although many Greek women, some of them of rare beauty\r\nand culture, found their way to Rome, especially under the empire, they\r\nwere always kept in the background and never succeeded in achieving\r\nanything approaching the ascendancy which distinguished them during the\r\ntime of Aspasia. Their influence in literature and politics was almost\r\n_nil_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the women of Rome, on the contrary, it may well be\r\nquestioned whether woman has ever wielded a greater influence than she\r\ndid during the three centuries that followed the reign of Augustus. But\r\nshe did not attain to this position of preeminence without a long and\r\nbitter struggle. Every advance toward the goal of social and\r\nintellectual equality was strenuously contested by the men, who wished\r\nto limit the activities of their wives to the spindle, the distaff and\r\nthe loom and the other occupations of the household. For, as in Greece,\r\nthe generally accepted view was that woman, in the language of Gibbon,\r\n\"was created to please and obey. She was never supposed to have reached\r\nthe age of reason or experience.\" And her noblest epitaph, it was\r\naverred, was couched in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"She was gentle, pious, loved her husband, was skillful at\r\n     the loom and a good housekeeper.\"[15]\r\n\r\nAs to her mental work, far from being considered on its own merits or as\r\na factor in the world's growth, it was flouted as\r\n\r\n    \"Mere woman's work\r\n    Expressing the comparative respect\r\n    Which means the absolute scorn.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as 450 B.C., when the laws of the Twelve Tables were\r\npromulgated, the girls of Rome received instruction in reading, writing\r\nand arithmetic. \"Up before dawn, with a lamp to light the way, and an\r\nattendant to carry her satchel, the little Roman maiden of seven years,\r\nor over, would trudge off to the portico where the schoolmaster wielded\r\nhis rod.[16] For some years this life continued, with but few holidays,\r\nand those far between, until she attained some proficiency in the\r\nrudiments. Then, most probably, her education in the scholastic sense\r\ncame to an end. Her brothers and boy schoolmates, if their parents\r\nwished it, could proceed from the primary school to the secondary, where\r\ngeography, history and ethics were taught; where the art of elocution\r\nwas assiduously practiced and the works of the great Greek and Roman\r\npoets were carefully read and expounded; but it was enough for the girl\r\nto have learned how to read, write and cipher; she had then to learn her\r\ndomestic duties.\"[17]\r\n\r\nWith the extension of the empire and the consequent enormous increase in\r\nwealth and the rapid progress in social and intellectual freedom, there\r\nwas a notable change in the character of the education given to women,\r\nat least to those of the wealthier and patrician families. This was, in\r\ngreat measure, due to the wave of Hellenism which, shortly after the\r\nconquest of Greece, broke upon the Roman capital with such irresistible\r\nforce. To the large and rapidly increasing number of women of keen\r\nintellect and lofty aspirations, whose minds had hitherto been confined\r\nto the comparatively barren field of Roman letters, the splendid\r\ncreations of Greek genius came as a revelation. To become thoroughly\r\nversed in Greek poetry and proficient in the teachings of Greek\r\nphilosophy was the ambition of scores of Roman women, who soon became\r\nnoted for the extent and variety of their attainments, as well as for\r\ntheir rare culture and charming personality.\r\n\r\nAmong the pioneers of the intellectual movement in Rome, and one of the\r\nmost beautiful types of the learned women of her time, was the\r\ncelebrated daughter of the elder Scipio Africanus--Cornelia, mother of\r\nthe Gracchi. She is famous on account of her devotion to her two sons,\r\nTiberius and Caius. She was their teacher; and it was her educated and\r\nrefined mind that, more than anything else, contributed to the formation\r\nof those splendid characters for which they were so highly esteemed by\r\ntheir countrymen. Plutarch informs us that these noble sons of a noble\r\nmother \"were brought up by her so carefully that they became beyond\r\ndispute the most accomplished of Roman youth; and, thus, they owed\r\nperhaps more to their excellent upbringing than to their natural\r\nparts.\"[18] One is not surprised to learn that this noble lady was\r\nalmost idolized by the Romans, and that they erected a statue to her\r\nwith the inscription, \"Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely less distinguished and accomplished was another Cornelia, the\r\nwife of Pompey, the Great. \"Besides her youthful beauty,\" writes\r\nPlutarch, in his _Life of Pompey_, \"she possessed other charms, for she\r\nwas well versed in literature, in playing on the lyre, and in geometry,\r\nand she had been used to listen to philosophical discourses with profit.\r\nBesides this, she had a disposition free from all affectation and\r\ndisplay of pedantry--blemishes which such acquirements usually breed in\r\nwomen.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThen there was the cultured and devoted Aurelia, the mother of Julius\r\nCaesar. It is safe to say that this eminent man was as much indebted to\r\nhis mother for his success and greatness as were Tiberius and Caius\r\nGracchus to the benign influence and careful teachings of the gentle and\r\nvirtuous Cornelia. Highly educated and of commanding personalities, both\r\nthese women, like many others of their time, contributed much to the\r\nmaking of Roman history by the success they achieved in molding the\r\ncharacters of some of the greatest men of their own or of any age.\r\n\r\nIt is a splendid tribute that Cicero, in his _Orator_, pays to Laelia\r\nwhen he tells of the purity of her language and the charm of her\r\nconversation. \"When I listen,\" he declares, \"to my mother-in-law,\r\nLaelia--for women preserve the traditional purity of accent the best\r\nbecause, being limited in their intercourse with the multitude, they\r\nretain their early impressions--I could imagine that I hear Plautus or\r\nNaevius speaking, the pronunciation is so plain and simple, so perfectly\r\nfree from all affectation and display; from which I infer that such was\r\nthe accent of her father and his ancestors--not harsh like the\r\npronunciation to which I have just referred, not broad nor rustic nor\r\nrugged, but terse, smooth and flowing.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the cultured and learned women who shed glory on\r\ntheir country by the refining influence which they exerted in the quiet\r\nand unostentatious precincts of the family circle. But there were others\r\nwho chose a wider field for their activities, and who, by reason of\r\ntheir unerring judgment, well-poised and highly cultivated minds, had so\r\nwon the confidence of the nation's greatest leaders that they were\r\nfrequently consulted on important affairs of state. Thus, Cicero tells\r\nus of an interview which he had at Antium with Brutus and Cassius.\r\nBesides the men, there were present on this occasion three women, who\r\ntook an active part in the discussion. These were Servilia, the mother\r\nof Brutus, Porcia, the wife of Brutus and the daughter of Cato, and\r\nTertulla, the wife of Cassius and sister of Brutus. The views of the\r\nwomen were not without effect, and so confident was Servilia of her\r\npower that she engaged to have a certain clause in one of the decrees of\r\nthe Senate expunged. This is but one of many similar instances which\r\nmight be adduced from the lives of the women of Rome who took an active\r\npart in politics. As we learn from Tacitus, their counsels and\r\nassistance were considered of peculiar value by the Commonwealth. For,\r\nwhen some of the sterner old moralists wished to exclude women from all\r\nparticipation in public affairs, the Senate, after a heated debate,\r\ndecided by a large majority that the cooperation of women in questions\r\nof administration, far from being a menace, as some contended, was so\r\nbeneficial to the state that it should be continued.\r\n\r\nAmong other noteworthy makers of Roman history, besides those just\r\nmentioned, is Livia, the wife of Augustus and the mother of Tiberius. So\r\ngreat was her influence and so persistent was her activity in government\r\naffairs, that it is sometimes asserted that she was the prime mover of\r\nmost of the public acts of both these rulers. This woman, whom Ovid\r\ndescribes as having the features of Venus and the manner of Juno, and\r\nwho, he declares, \"held her head above all vices,\" was credited with\r\nhaving the benevolence of Ceres, the purity of Diana and the wisdom and\r\ncraft of Minerva--\"a woman,\" as was said by one of her contemporaries,\r\n\"in all things more comparable to the gods than to men, who knew how to\r\nuse her power so as to turn away peril and advance the most deserving.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was the gracious, the virtuous, the self-sacrificing Octavia,\r\nsister of the Emperor Augustus, who was so successful in composing grave\r\ndifferences between her brother and her husband, and who so exerted her\r\ninfluence for peace during the troublous times in which she lived that\r\nshe lives in history as a peacemaker. In marked contrast to this gentle\r\nand sympathetic woman was the energetic and heroic Agrippina, the wife\r\nof Germanicus. In many respects she was the most commanding personality\r\nof her age, and exhibited in an eminent degree those sterling qualities\r\nwhich we are wont to associate with the strong, dignified, courageous\r\nwomen of ancient Rome, who gave to the world so many and so great men in\r\nevery sphere of human endeavor. \"She was,\" as Tacitus informs us, \"a\r\ngreater power in the army than legates and commanders, and she, a woman,\r\nhad quelled a mutiny which the emperor's authority could not check.\"[21]\r\nShe was, indeed, as has well been said, \"a woman to whom one might\r\naddress an epic but never a sonnet.\"\r\n\r\nI have referred to these distinguished women because they are\r\nembodiments of the best types of the noble, patrician families who made\r\nthe great Roman empire the admiration of all time, and because they\r\nexhibit the wonderful advance that had been made in the general status\r\nof women since the days of Pericles and Aspasia. I have referred to\r\nthem, also, to show what women are capable of achieving in the difficult\r\nand complicated affairs of public life, when they are accorded the\r\nnecessary freedom of action and when they are properly equipped for work\r\nby education and by association with men of learning and experience.\r\nComparing the secluded and illiterate Greek wife with the free and\r\nhighly accomplished Roman matron, we find almost as much difference\r\nbetween the two as there is between a child and a fully developed\r\nwoman--all the difference there was between the unsophisticated young\r\nwife, not quite fifteen, of whom Xenophon gives us such a charming\r\npicture,[22] and the highly educated and competent mother of the\r\nGracchi.\r\n\r\nOf the Greek maiden we are told that, before her marriage she \"had been\r\nmost carefully brought up to see and hear as little as possible and to\r\nask the fewest questions\"; that her whole experience before her marriage\r\n\"consisted in knowing how to take the wool and make a dress, and in\r\nseeing how her mother's handmaidens had their daily spinning tasks\r\nassigned to them.\" Cornelia, on the contrary, was not only, as we have\r\nseen, highly accomplished, but also one who, after her husband's death,\r\nwas quite prepared, as Plutarch assures us, to undertake the management\r\nof the extensive property which he left his family, and who, we may well\r\nbelieve, would also have been qualified, had the occasion demanded it,\r\nto perform with distinction the same duties that fell to the lot of the\r\ngifted wives of Germanicus and Augustus.\r\n\r\nNothing in the history of Greek and Roman womanhood more strikingly\r\nillustrates than the two instances given the vast difference in the\r\nstatus of the wives of Greece and Rome, or exhibits more clearly the\r\nadvantages accruing to early training and thorough mental development.\r\nIf there was any difference in talent or intellect between the Greek and\r\nthe Roman woman it was, so far as we can determine, in favor of the\r\nGreek. The sole reason, then, for such a marked difference in their\r\ncapacity for work and for achieving distinction in intellectual and\r\nadministrative fields of action arose from the lack of education in the\r\nAthenian wife and the fullest measure of educational freedom enjoyed by\r\nthe Roman. That Aspasia, in spite of all the odds against her, was able\r\nto rise to such a pinnacle of glory does not prove that she was the\r\nsuperior of her countrywomen--the mothers of the greatest poets, artists\r\nand philosophers of all time--but it exhibits rather her good fortune in\r\nbeing able to effect a partnership with the greatest statesman of\r\nGreece, and one who was at the same time fully able to appreciate all\r\nher rare mental attainments and give her marvelous genius free scope for\r\ndevelopment by cooperating with him in making the period during which he\r\nheld the reign of power the most brilliant one in the annals of human\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nPlato, referring to the oriental seclusion to which Athenian wives were\r\ncondemned, speaks of them as \"a race used to living out of the\r\nsunshine,\" and that, too, among a people that habitually lived out of\r\ndoors. We have already seen how much greater freedom Roman women enjoyed\r\nand how much more important was the role they played in public as well\r\nas private life; but we have not told all. They not only went to, but\r\npresided over, public games and religious ceremonies. They were admitted\r\nto aristocratic clubs and had, under the empire, a regular assembly or\r\nsenate of their own, known as the _Conventus Matronarum_. Hortensia, the\r\ndaughter of the great orator Hortensius, pleaded the cause of her sex\r\nbefore the tribunal of the triumvirs, and so eloquent and effective was\r\nher speech that she not only won her case, but also won the praise of\r\nthe critic, Quintilian, for her splendid oratorical effort.\r\n\r\nYet more. A certain woman in the Roman possessions in Africa had so\r\nimpressed her fellow citizens by her intellectual capacity and\r\nadministrative ability that she was chosen as one of the two chief\r\nmagistrates of the place. She is known in history as Messia Castula,\r\n_duumvira_. It is true that the men of the older school, who would limit\r\nwoman's activities to the distaff and the loom, strongly objected to the\r\nincreasing freedom and power of women, and endeavored to counteract\r\ntheir influence; but all to no purpose. And it was the crabbed old Cato,\r\nthe Censor, who growled in undisguised disgust:--\"We Romans rule over\r\nall men and our wives rule over us.\"\r\n\r\nBut great as were the freedom and educational advantages of the Roman\r\nwomen, the startling fact remains that, with the exception of a few\r\nfragmentary verses of slight merit and of questionable authenticity, we\r\nhave absolutely no tangible evidence of the Roman woman's literary\r\nability while under pagan influence. We have seen, in considering her\r\nintellectual attainments--especially after the introduction of Greek art\r\nand letters into the City of the Seven Hills--that every woman who\r\npretended to culture was obliged to be familiar with the Greek as well\r\nas with the Latin authors, that her education was deemed incomplete\r\nwithout a knowledge of Greek poetry, oratory, history and philosophy,\r\nbut the fact is indisputable that Roman women were not producers like\r\ntheir Greek sisters, and that in no instance did their productions reach\r\nanything like the supreme excellence of the creations of a Corinna or a\r\nSappho. There was, it is true, Sulpicia, of whom Martial writes: \"Let\r\nevery girl, whose wish it is to please a single man, read Sulpicia; let\r\nevery man, whose wish it is to please a single maid, read Sulpicia;\"\r\nbut, if the few amatory verses that are credited to her represent the\r\nhighest flights of the Roman women in the domain of poetry, then,\r\nindeed, were they far behind not only Sappho and Corinna, but also far\r\nbehind scores of their pupils. Martial does indeed speak of a young\r\nmaiden in whom were combined the eloquence of Plato with the austere\r\nphilosophy of the Porch, and who wrote verses worthy of a chaste Sappho;\r\nbut this was evidently a great exaggeration, for we have no other\r\nevidence of her existence.\r\n\r\nThe creative work of Roman women was, so far as we are able to judge,\r\nquite as limited in prose as it was in poetry. Agrippina, the mother of\r\nNero, was one of the few prose writers whose name has come down to us.\r\nFrom her memoirs it was that Tacitus received much of the material\r\nincorporated in his _Annals_.\r\n\r\nThat some of the women had literary ability of a high order is indicated\r\nby a letter of Pliny to one of his correspondents, in which occurs the\r\nfollowing passage:\r\n\r\n\"Pomponius Saturninus recently read me some letters which he averred had\r\nbeen written by his wife. I believed that Plautus or Terence was being\r\nread in prose. Whether they were really his wife's, as he maintains, or\r\nhis own, which he denies, he deserves equal honor, either because he\r\ncomposes them or because he has made his wife, whom he married when a\r\nmere girl, so learned and so polished.\"[23]\r\n\r\nScarcely less distinguished for her taste in literature, and for her\r\ntalent as a letter writer, was Pliny's wife, Calphurnia, who, at his\r\nrequest, wrote to him in his absence every day and sometimes even twice\r\na day. According to Cicero, his daughter Tulia was \"the best and most\r\nlearned of women\"; but her literary work, it is probable, did not extend\r\nmuch beyond her letters to her illustrious father. Nevertheless, what\r\nwould we not give to possess these letters--to have as complete a\r\ncollection of them as we have of those of the great orator and\r\nphilosopher. They would be of inestimable value and would be absolutely\r\nbeyond compare, except, possibly, with the letters of Mme. du Deffand or\r\nof Elizabeth Barrett Browning of a much later age.\r\n\r\nConsidering the number of educated women that lived in the latter days\r\nof the Republic and during the earlier part of the Empire, and their\r\nwell known culture and love of letters, it is reasonable to suppose that\r\nthey may have written much in both prose and verse of which we have no\r\nrecord. Literary productions must have more than ordinary value to\r\nsurvive two thousand years, and especially two thousand years of such\r\nrevolutions and upheavals as have convulsed the world since the time of\r\nthe _Pax Romana_, when all the world was at peace under Augustus.\r\n\r\nHow much of the literary work of the women of to-day will receive\r\nrecognition twenty centuries hence? Some of it may, it is true, find a\r\nplace in the fireproof libraries of the time; but who, outside of a few\r\nantiquarians, will take the trouble to read it or estimate its value? A\r\nfew anthologies containing our gems of prose and poetry will probably be\r\nall that our fortieth century readers will deem worthy of notice. In\r\nview of the chaotic condition of Europe for so many centuries, the\r\nwonder is not that we have so little of the literary remains of Greece\r\nand Rome, but rather that we have anything at all.\r\n\r\nAs one might expect, the literary women of Rome, as well as those who\r\nventured to take part in public affairs, had their critics. The\r\nsatirists of the time were as unsparing of their ridicule as they were\r\nlong afterward when Moliere wrote his _Femmes Savantes_ and his\r\n_Precieuses Ridicules_. And as for men of the old conservative type, a\r\nlearned woman was as much an object of horror as is a militant\r\nsuffragette in conservative England to-day. \"No learned wife for me,\"\r\nexclaims Martial, \"but rather a well-fed slave.\"[24]\r\n\r\nAnd Juvenal had no more love for educated women than have some of our\r\ncontemporaries for a blue-stocking housekeeper. He gives his opinion of\r\nthem in the following characteristic fashion:\r\n\r\n\"That woman is a worse nuisance than usual who, as soon as she reclines\r\non her couch, praises Virgil; makes excuses for doomed Dido; pits bards\r\nagainst one another and compares them, and weighs Homer and Mars in the\r\nbalance. Teachers of literature give way, professors are vanquished, the\r\nwhole mob is hushed, and so great is the torrent of words that no lawyer\r\nor auctioneer may speak, nor any other woman.\"[25]\r\n\r\nBut if learned women had their enemies and detractors they also had\r\nfriends and defenders. Among these was the Stoic philosopher, C.\r\nMusonius Rufus, who lived in the time of Nero. Like Plato, he contended\r\nthat women should have the same training as men and that the faculties\r\nof both should be equally developed. The gist of his teaching is\r\ncontained in the statement that:\r\n\r\n\"If the same virtues must pertain to men and women, it follows,\r\nnecessarily, that the same training and education must be suitable for\r\nboth.\"[26]\r\n\r\nOur brief sketch of women's work in ancient Rome would be incomplete\r\nwithout some reference to the famous _Ecclesia Domestica_--Church of the\r\nHousehold--on the Aventine, and the distinguished women who were its\r\nchief ornaments. During the time of Pope Damasus, and not long before\r\nthe sacking of Rome by Alaric, the _Ecclesia Domestica_ was a kind of\r\nconventual home to which had retired, or in which were frequently\r\ngathered, some of the most noble and learned women of the city. Among\r\nthe most notable of these were Marcella and her friends, Paula and\r\nEustochium.\r\n\r\nFor beauty of character and nobility of purpose and rare mental\r\nendowments they recall the best traditions of a Cornelia or a\r\nCalphurnia, while so great was their purity of life and so unbounded was\r\ntheir charity to the poor and suffering that they were honored by being\r\nnumbered among the saints of the early church. But what specially\r\ndistinguished them among all the great women of the Roman world was\r\ntheir great and varied learning. In this respect they probably were far\r\nin advance of all their predecessors. For, in addition to a thorough\r\nknowledge of Latin and Greek literature, history and philosophy, they\r\nhad, under the great theologian and orientalist, St. Jerome, become\r\nproficient in Hebrew and deeply versed in Scripture.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention should be made of Paula and her daughter Eustochium; for\r\nit is probable that, had it not been for their influence on Jerome, and\r\ntheir active cooperation in his great life work, we should not have the\r\nLatin version of the Scriptures that is to-day known as the Vulgate.\r\nThis is evinced from the letters of the saint himself and from what we\r\nknow of the lives of these two remarkable women, who, as St. Jerome\r\ninforms us in the epitaph which he had engraved on Paula's tomb in the\r\nChurch of the Nativity in Bethlehem, were descended from the Scipios,\r\nthe Gracchi and the Pauli on the mother's side, and on the father's side\r\nfrom the half-mythical kings of Sparta and Mycenae.[27]\r\n\r\nThey aided him not only by their sympathy and by purchasing for him,\r\noften at a great price, the manuscripts he needed for his colossal\r\nundertaking, but also assisted him by their thorough knowledge of Latin,\r\nGreek and Hebrew in translating the Sacred Books from the original\r\nHebrew into Latin. So great was Jerome's confidence in their scholarship\r\nand so high was his appreciation of their ability and judgment that he\r\ndid not hesitate to submit his translations to them for their criticism\r\nand approval. After he had completed his version of the first Book of\r\nKings, he turned it over to them, saying: \"Read my Book of Kings--read\r\nalso the Latin and Greek translations and compare them with my version.\"\r\nAnd they did read and compare and criticise. And more than this, they\r\nfrequently suggested modifications and corrections which the great man\r\naccepted with touching humility and incorporated in a revised copy.\r\n\r\nMore wonderful still, the Latin Psalter, as it has come down to us, is\r\nnot, as is generally supposed, the translation from the Hebrew of\r\nJerome, but rather a corrected version made from the Septuagint by his\r\nillustrious collaborators--Paula and Eustochium.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that no two women were ever engaged in a more\r\nimportant or more difficult literary undertaking--one requiring keener\r\ncritical sense or more profound learning--than were Paula and\r\nEustochium, or one in which their efforts were crowned with more\r\nbrilliant success than were those of these two supreme exemplars of the\r\ngrace, the knowledge, the culture, the refinement of Roman\r\nwomanhood--the crowning glories of womanhood throughout the ages.\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome showed his grateful recognition of the invaluable assistance\r\nreceived from his devoted and talented co-workers by dedicating to them\r\na great number of his most important books. This scandalized the\r\npharisaical men of the time, who looked askance at all learned women and\r\nresented particularly the preeminence given to Paula and her\r\naccomplished daughter. But their reproaches provoked a reply from the\r\nsaint that was worthy of the most chivalrous champion of woman, and\r\nrevealed, at the same time, all the nobility of soul of the roused \"Lion\r\nof Bethlehem.\" It is not only a defence of his course, but also a\r\nsplendid tribute to his two illustrious friends, and a tribute also to\r\nthe great and good women of all time.\r\n\r\n\"There are people, O Paula and Eustochium,\" exclaims the Christian\r\nCicero, vibrant with emotion and in a burst of eloquence that recalls\r\none of the burning philippics of Marcus Tullius, \"who take offence at\r\nseeing your names at the beginning of my works. These people do not know\r\nthat Olda prophesied when the men were mute; that while Barach was\r\natremble, Deborah saved Israel; that Judith and Esther delivered from\r\nsupreme peril the children of God. I pass over in silence Anna and\r\nElizabeth and the other holy women of the Gospel, but humble stars when\r\ncompared with the great luminary, Mary. Shall I speak now of the\r\nillustrious women among the heathen? Does not Plato have Aspasia speak\r\nin his dialogues? Does not Sappho hold the lyre at the same time as\r\nAlcaeus and Pindar? Did not Themista philosophize with the sages of\r\nGreece? And the mother of the Gracchi, your Cornelia, and the daughter\r\nof Cato, wife of Brutus, before whom pale the austere virtue of the\r\nfather and the courage of the husband--are they not the pride of the\r\nwhole of Rome? I shall add but one word more. Was not it women to whom\r\nour Lord first appeared after His resurrection? Yes, men could then\r\nblush for not having sought what the women had found.\"[28]\r\n\r\nTime has spared a joint letter of Paula and Eustochium to their friend\r\nMarcella--a letter which exhibits so well the rare culture and literary\r\nability of the writers that we cannot but lament that we have not more\r\nof the correspondence which was carried on between the learned inmates\r\nof the Church of the Household on the Aventine and Paula's convent home\r\nnear the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. Such a collection would be\r\nbeyond price, as it would complete the picture of the age so well\r\nsketched by St. Jerome; and, as a contribution to the literary world, it\r\nwould have a value not inferior to that of those exquisite classics of a\r\nlater age--the letters of Madame Sevigne to her daughter.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN AND EDUCATION DURING THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nThe period of nearly a thousand years intervening between the downfall\r\nof Rome in A.D. 476 and the taking of Constantinople by the Turks in\r\n1453 is usually known in history as the Middle Ages. By some it is\r\nconsidered as synonymous with the Dark Ages, because of the decline of\r\nlearning and civilization during this long interval of time. The former\r\ndesignation seems preferable, for, as we shall see, the latter is more\r\nor less misleading. During the \"wandering of the nations\" in the fourth\r\nand fifth centuries, and the long and fierce struggles between the\r\nbarbarian hordes from the north with the decadent peoples of the once\r\ngreat Roman empire, there was, no doubt, a partial eclipse of the sun of\r\ncivilization; but the consequent darkness was not so dense nor so\r\ngeneral and long-continued as is sometimes imagined. The progress of\r\nintellectual culture was, indeed, greatly retarded, but there was no\r\ntime when the light of learning was entirely extinguished. For even\r\nduring the most troublous times there were centers of culture in one\r\npart of Europe or another. At one time the center was in Italy, at\r\nanother in Gaul, and, at still another, it was in Britain or Ireland or\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nBut whether it was in the south, or the west or the north of Europe that\r\nletters flourished, it was always the convent or the monastery that was\r\nthe home of learning and culture. Within these holy precincts the\r\nliterary treasures of antiquity were preserved and multiplied. Here\r\nmonks and nuns labored and studied, always keeping lighted the sacred\r\ntorch of knowledge--_Et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt_--and\r\npassing it on to the generations that succeeded them. That any of the\r\ngreat literary masterpieces of Greece and Rome have come to us, in spite\r\nof the destructive agencies of time and the wreck of empires, is due\r\nwholly to the unremitting toil through long ages of the zealous and\r\nintelligent inmates of the cloister.\r\n\r\nOf the monastic institutions for men there is no occasion to speak,\r\nexcept in so far as they contributed to the intellectual advancement of\r\nwoman. In some cases the women of the cloister owed much to\r\necclesiastics for their literary training; but there are not wanting\r\ninstances in which the nuns took the lead in education and had the\r\ndirection of schools which gave to the church priests and bishops of\r\nrecognized scholarship.\r\n\r\nPractically the only schools for girls during the Middle Ages were the\r\nconvents. Here were educated rich and poor, gentle and simple. And in\r\nthese homes of piety and learning the inmates enjoyed a peace and a\r\nsecurity that it was impossible to find elsewhere. They were free from\r\nthe dangers and annoyances that so often menaced them in their own homes\r\nand were able to pursue their studies under the most favorable auspices.\r\n\r\nAmong the first convent schools to achieve distinction were those of\r\nArles and Poitiers in Gaul, in the latter part of the sixth century. The\r\nAbbess of Poitiers is known to us as St. Radegund. She not only had a\r\nknowledge of letters rare for her age, but wrote poems of such merit\r\nthat they were until recently accepted as the productions of her master,\r\nthe poet Fortunatus,[30] who subsequently became bishop of Poitiers.\r\n\r\nFar more notable, however, than the convents of Arles and Poitiers was\r\nthe celebrated convent of St. Hilda at Whitby. Hilda, the foundress and\r\nfirst abbess of Whitby, was a princess of the blood-royal and a\r\ngrand-niece of Edwin, the first Christian king of Northumbria. Her\r\nconvent and adjoining monastery for monks soon became the most noted\r\ncenter of learning and culture in Britain. And so great was her\r\nreputation for knowledge and wisdom that not only priests and bishops,\r\nbut also princes and kings sought her counsel in important matters of\r\nchurch and state.\r\n\r\nAs to the monks subject to her authority, she inspired them with so\r\ngreat a love of knowledge, and urged them to so thorough a study of the\r\nScriptures, that her monastery became, as Venerable Bede informs us, a\r\nschool not only for missionaries but for bishops as well. He speaks in\r\nparticular of six ecclesiastical dignitaries who were sent forth from\r\nthis noble institution--all of whom were bishops. Five of them he\r\ndescribes as men of singular merit and sanctity--\"_singularis meriti et\r\nsanctitatis viros_,\" while the sixth, he declared, was a man of rare\r\nability and learning--\"_doctissimus et excellentis ingenii_.\" Of this\r\nnumber was St. John of Beverly, who, we are told, \"attained a degree of\r\npopularity rare even in England, where the saints of old were so\r\nuniversally and so readily popular.\"[31] Hilda governed her double\r\nmonastery with singular wisdom and success; and, so great was the love\r\nand veneration she inspired among all classes that she merited the\r\nepithet of \"Mother of her Country.\"\r\n\r\nCelebrated, however, as Hilda was for her great educational work at\r\nWhitby, she is probably better known to the world as the one who first\r\nrecognized and fostered the rare gifts of the poet Caedmon. \"It is on the\r\nlips of this cowherd,\" as Montalembert beautifully expresses it, \"that\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon speech first bursts into poetry. Indeed, nothing in the\r\nwhole history of European literature is more original or more religious\r\nthan this first utterance of the English muse.\"[32]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hilda discovered the extraordinary poetic faculty of Caedmon,\r\nshe did not hesitate to regard it \"as a special gift of God, worthy of\r\nall respect and of the most tender care.\" And, in order that she might\r\nthe more readily develop the splendid talents of this literary prodigy,\r\nthe keen discerning abbess received Caedmon into the monastery of monks,\r\nand had him translate the entire Bible into Anglo-Saxon. \"As soon as the\r\nSacred Text was read for him he forthwith,\" as Bede declares, \"ruminated\r\nit as a clean animal ruminates its food, and transformed it into songs\r\nso beautiful that all who heard were delighted.\"\r\n\r\nAs his poetical faculty became more developed, his profoundly original\r\ngenius became more marked, and his inspiration more earnest and\r\nimpassioned. It was this Northumbrian cowherd, transformed into a monk\r\nof Whitby, who sang before the abbess Hilda the revolt of Satan and\r\nParadise Lost, a thousand years earlier than Milton, in verses which may\r\nstill be admired even beside the immortal poem of the British Homer. So\r\nremarkable, indeed, in some instances is the similarity in the\r\nproductions of the two poets that F. Palgrave, one of the most competent\r\nof English critics, does not hesitate to declare that certain of\r\nCaedmon's verses resembled so closely certain passages of the Paradise\r\nLost that some of Milton's lines seem almost like a translation from the\r\nwork of his distinguished predecessor. And M. Taine, in his _History of\r\nEnglish Literature_, referring to the \"string of short, accumulated,\r\npassionate images, like a succession of lightning flashes,\" of the old\r\nAnglo-Saxon poet, asserts that \"Milton's Satan exists in Caedmon's as the\r\npicture exists in the sketch.\"[33]\r\n\r\nWell could Caedmon's first biographer, the Venerable Bede, say of him,\r\n\"Many Englishmen after him have tried to compose religious poems, but no\r\none has ever equaled the man who had only God for a master.\" And not\r\nwithout warrant does the eloquent Montalembert, in the masterly work\r\njust quoted, pen the following statement: \"Apart from the interest which\r\nattaches to Caedmon from a historical and literary point of view, his\r\nlife discloses to us essential peculiarities in the outward organization\r\nand intellectual life of those great communities which in the seventh\r\ncentury studded the coast of Northumbria, and which, with all their\r\nnumerous dependents, found often a more complete development under the\r\ncrozier of such a woman as Hilda than under the superiors of the other\r\nsex.\"[34]\r\n\r\nSpace precludes my telling of other convents which were centers of\r\nliterary activity, and of nuns who distinguished themselves by their\r\nlearning and by the benign influence which they exerted far beyond the\r\nwalls of the cloister. I cannot, however, refrain from referring to that\r\ngroup of learned English nuns who are chiefly known by their Latin\r\ncorrespondence with St. Boniface, the Apostle of Germany, and by the\r\nassistance which they gave him in his arduous labors. Conspicuous among\r\nthese was St. Lioba, who, at the request of Boniface, left her home in\r\nEngland to found a convent at Bischopsheim in Germany, which, under the\r\ndirection of its learned and zealous abbess, soon became the most\r\nimportant educational center in that part of Europe. Teachers were\r\nformed here for other schools in Germany and Lioba's biographer tells us\r\nthat there were few _monasteria feminarum_--monasteries of women--within\r\nthe sphere of Boniface's missionary activities for which Lioba's pupils\r\nwere not sought as instructresses.\r\n\r\nLike her illustrious countrywoman, St. Hilda, the abbess of Bischopsheim\r\nwas the friend and counselor of spiritual and temporal rulers.\r\nCharlemagne, that eminent patron of scholars, had a great admiration for\r\nher and gave her many substantial proofs of his esteem and veneration.\r\n\"Princes,\" writes her biographer, \"loved her, noblemen received her, and\r\nbishops gladly entertained her and conversed with her on the Scriptures\r\nand on the institutions of religion, for she was familiar with many\r\nwritings and careful in giving advice. She was so bent on reading that\r\nshe never laid aside her book except to pray or to strengthen her slight\r\nframe with food or sleep.\"[35] She was thoroughly conversant with the\r\nbooks of the Old and the New Testaments and was, at the same time,\r\nfamiliar with the writings of the Fathers. It is not surprising, then,\r\nthat she was regarded as an oracle, and that all classes flocked to her\r\nas they did to the abbess of Whitby for guidance and assistance.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of the accomplishments and achievements of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon nuns just mentioned, it is evident that they were, of a\r\ntruth, women of exceptional worth and of sterling character. And it is\r\nequally clear that their pupils must have shared in the education and\r\nculture of their distinguished teachers.[36] Many of them, in addition\r\nto having a wide acquaintance with literature, sacred and profane, were\r\nalso mistresses of several languages. A woman's education, at this time,\r\nwas not complete unless she could write Latin and speak it fluently. The\r\nauthor of that most interesting early English work, _Ancren Riwle_--Rule\r\nof Anchoresses--presupposes in his auditors, for whose benefit his\r\ninstructions were given, a knowledge of Latin and French, as well as of\r\nEnglish. In certain convents Latin was almost the sole medium of\r\ncommunication,--to such an extent, indeed, that a special rule was made\r\nprohibiting \"the use of the Latin tongue except under special\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as the conventual system lasted the only schools for girls in\r\nEngland were the convent schools where, says Robert Aske, 'the daughters\r\nof gentlemen were brought up in virtue.' From an educational point of\r\nview, the suppression of the convents was decidedly a blunder.\" Thus\r\nwrites Georgiana Hill in her instructive work on _Women in English\r\nLife_, and there are, we fancy, but few readers of her instructive pages\r\nwho will not be inclined to agree with her conclusions.[37] Lecky speaks\r\nof the dissolution of convents at the time of the Reformation as \"far\r\nfrom a benefit to women or the world.\"[38] And Dom Gasquet declares\r\n\"that destruction by Henry VIII of the conventual schools where the\r\nfemale population, the rich as well as the poor, found their only\r\nteachers, was the absolute extinction of any systematic education of\r\nwomen for a long period.\"[39]\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The strangest and saddest result, consequent on the\r\nsuppression of the convents, was that men were made to profit by the\r\nloss which women had sustained. The revenues of the houses that were\r\nsuppressed had been intended for the sole use and behoof of women, and\r\nhad been administered by them in this sense for centuries. When they\r\nwere appropriated by Henry VIII, it never occurred to him or his\r\nministers to make any provision for the education of women in lieu of\r\nthat which had so ruthlessly been wrested from them. Thus the nunnery of\r\nSt. Radegund, together with its revenues and possessions, was\r\ntransformed into Jesus College, Cambridge, while from the suppressed\r\nconvents of Bromhall in Berkshire and Lillechurch in Kent funds were\r\nsecured for the foundation and endowment of St. John's College, also at\r\nCambridge. Similarly, the properties of other nunneries, large and\r\nsmall, were appropriated for the foundation of collegiate institutions\r\nat Oxford, all of which were for the benefit of men.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that, in a few short years, the great work of centuries\r\nwas undone and women were left little better educational facilities than\r\nwhen the Anglo-Saxon nuns began their noble work in a land that was\r\nenveloped in \"one dark night of unillumined barbarism.\"\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that Elizabeth, who was so highly educated, and\r\nwho did so much for the supremacy of her country on land and sea, would\r\nhave bethought herself of the necessity of doing something for the\r\neducation of her female subjects. But no. She did nothing for them, and\r\nthe founders of the endowed grammar schools, during her reign, gave\r\nnever a thought to the educational necessities of the girls. They made\r\nprovision only for the boys. In this respect, however, the \"Virgin\r\nQueen\" was but following in the footsteps of the male sovereigns and\r\nlegislators who had preceded her, and who, although affecting an\r\ninterest in having women \"sensible and virtuous, seem by their conduct\r\ntoward the sex to have entered into a general conspiracy to order it\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, when anything was achieved for the intellectual\r\nadvancement of women it was due either to private instruction or to the\r\nresult of a protracted struggle on the part of women themselves for what\r\nthey deemed their indefeasible rights. Had they relied on the\r\nspontaneous action of men and on legislation in favor of female\r\neducation to which men had given the initiative, they would to-day be in\r\nthe same condition of ignorance and seclusion and servitude as was the\r\nAthenian woman twenty-five centuries ago, and would occupy a status but\r\nlittle above that of the inmates of oriental harems and zenanas.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon nuns were, as we have seen, specially distinguished for\r\ntheir learning and for the splendid work they performed for the\r\neducation of their sex during the long period of the Middle Ages. But\r\nhowever great their preeminence in these respects, they were not without\r\nrivals. There were, besides the schools, already named, conducted by St.\r\nLioba and her companions, also flourishing schools in Germany under the\r\ndirection of native nuns, whose success as educators was as marked as\r\nthat of Lioba or Hilda, and who, in addition to their labors in the\r\nclass-room, achieved distinction by their productive work. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon convents developed few writers, whereas those of Germany\r\nproduced several who not only shed luster on their sex but who also\r\nshowed what woman is capable of accomplishing when accorded some measure\r\nof encouragement and full liberty of action.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted writers of her age was the famous nun of\r\nGandersheim, Hroswitha, who was born in the early part of the tenth\r\ncentury. She was the pupil of the abbess Gerberg, who was of royal\r\nlineage, and one of the most zealous promoters of learning and culture\r\nin Saxony during the forty-two years of her rule in the convent to which\r\nshe and her favorite pupil gave undying renown.\r\n\r\nHroswitha's literary work consists of legends and contemporary history\r\nin metrical form and of her dramas written in the style of Terence. As a\r\nwriter of history and legends she ranks with the best authors of her\r\ntime, while as a writer of dramas she stands absolutely alone. Hers,\r\nindeed, were the first dramatic compositions given to the world during\r\nthe long interval that elapsed between the last comedies of classic\r\nantiquity and the first of the miracle plays which had such a vogue\r\nbetween the twelfth and the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nHer dramas, which, of all her works, have attracted the most attention,\r\nare seven in number. They deal with the moral and mental conflicts which\r\ncharacterized the period of transition from heathendom to Christianity.\r\nSome of them exhibit poetic talent of a high order as well as the\r\ninspiration and courage of genius. They reveal also a wide acquaintance\r\nwith the classic authors of Rome and Greece, besides a knowledge of many\r\nof the Christian writers. They are, likewise, distinguished by\r\noriginality of treatment, complete mastery of the material used, as well\r\nas by genuine beauty of rhyme and rhythm. In form, all the plays\r\npreserve the simple directness of their model, Terence, while, in\r\nconception, they embody the noblest ideals of Christian teaching. In\r\nmarked contrast to her model, who invariably exhibits the frailties and\r\nlapses of woman, Hroswitha's plays turn on the resistance of her sex to\r\ntemptation, and on their steadfast adherence to duty and to vows\r\nvoluntarily assumed. A recent English writer, W. H. Hudson, in an\r\nappreciative estimate of the work of this learned Benedictine nun\r\nexpresses himself as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is on the literary side alone that Hroswitha belongs to the classic\r\nschool. The spirit and essence of her work belong entirely to the Middle\r\nAges; for beneath the rigid garb of a dead language\"--she wrote in\r\nLatin--\"beats the warm heart of a new era. Everything in her plays that\r\nis not formal but essential, everything that is original and individual,\r\nbelongs wholly to the Christianized Germany of the tenth century.\r\nEverywhere we can trace the influence of the atmosphere in which she\r\nlived; every thought and every motive is colored by the spiritual\r\nconditions of her time. The keynote of all her works is the conflict of\r\nChristianity with paganism; and it is worthy of remark that in\r\nHroswitha's hands Christianity is throughout represented by the purity\r\nand gentleness of woman, while paganism is embodied in what she\r\ndescribes as the vigor of men--_virile robur_.\"[40]\r\n\r\nAmong her legends the one entitled _The Lapse and Conversion of\r\nTheophilus_ has a special interest as being the precursor of the\r\nwell-known legend of Faust.\r\n\r\nIn Hroswitha's time, as in our own, there were people who were strongly\r\nopposed to the higher education of women. There were others who would\r\ndeny them even the elements of an education--who declared that they\r\nshould be taught anything rather than reading and writing, which were a\r\ncause of temptation and sin--that their knowledge should be confined\r\nsolely to the duties of an ordinary housewife, that their books should\r\nconsist solely of thimble, thread and needles--\"_Et leurs livres, un de,\r\ndu fil et des aguilles._\" Some, it is true, were willing to make an\r\nexception in favor of nuns; but, as to all others, the less they knew\r\nthe better it was for their spiritual, if not for their temporal,\r\nwelfare also.[41] To those who were thus minded, Hroswitha pithily\r\nreplied that it was not knowledge itself but the bad use of it that was\r\ndangerous--\"_Nec scientia scibilis Deum offendit, sed injustitia\r\nscientis._\"\r\n\r\nAmong other women who were Hroswitha's equals in knowledge, if not in\r\nliterary attainments, were several other nuns who illumined the closing\r\ncenturies of the Middle Ages. Chief among these were St. Hildegard, \"the\r\nsybil of the Rhine\"; Herrad, the noted author of the _Hortus\r\nDeliciarum--Garden of Delights_--and Matilda and Gertrude, those\r\nremarkable mystical writers, whose descriptions of heaven and hell so\r\nclosely resemble those in the _Divina Commedia_ that many writers are of\r\nthe opinion that the great Florentine poet must have been familiar with\r\nthe accounts which they gave of their visions.\r\n\r\nSt. Hildegard was for a third of a century the abbess of the convent of\r\nSt. Rupert at Bingen. So great was her reputation for sanctity and for\r\nthe extent and variety of her attainments that she was called \"the\r\nmarvel of Germany.\" She is without doubt one of the most beautiful and\r\nimposing as well as one of the greatest figures of the Middle\r\nAges--great beside such eminent contemporaries as Abelard, Martin of\r\nTours and Bernard of Clairvaux. People from all parts of the Christian\r\nworld sought her counsel; and her convent at Bingen became a Mecca for\r\nall classes and conditions of men and women. But nothing shows better\r\nthe immense influence which she wielded than her letters of which nearly\r\nthree hundred have been preserved.\r\n\r\nAmong her correspondents were people of the humble walks of life as well\r\nas the highest representatives of Church and State. There were simple\r\nmonks and noble abbots; dukes, kings and queens; archbishops and\r\ncardinals and no fewer than four Popes. Letters came to her from the\r\norient and the occident, from the patriarch of Jerusalem, from Queen\r\nBertha of Greece, from Frederick Barbarossa, Philip the Count of\r\nFlanders, St. Bernard, the professors of the University of Paris; from\r\nHenry II of England, and from his grand-daughter Eleonora, \"The Damsel\r\nof Brittany.\" It is safe to say that no woman during the Middle Ages\r\nexercised a wider or more beneficent influence than did this humble\r\nBenedictine abbess of Bingen on the Rhine and had unsought so large a\r\nnumber of distinguished correspondents. And, if we accept the criterion\r\nthat influence is measured by the number and nature of one's relations,\r\nit would be difficult to find in any age relations that were more select\r\nor more cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nBut her astonishing collection of letters is the slightest product of\r\nher intellectual activity. She is without doubt the most voluminous\r\nwoman writer of the Middle Ages. Her works on theology, Scripture and\r\nscience make no less than six or eight large octavo volumes. The\r\nBollandists, than whom there is no more competent authority, express\r\ntheir amazement at the amount and quality of Hildegard's work. Witness\r\nthe following language of one of their number: \"Although we may not be\r\nsurprised that our saint was interrogated regarding secret things by so\r\nmany men eminent both by reason of their dignity and their learning, I\r\nam nevertheless forced to recognize with stupefaction that a woman\r\nwithout instruction, and who had not acquired knowledge by study, was\r\nconsulted concerning the most difficult questions of theology and the\r\nmost subtle of Holy Scriptures, and that she gave, without hesitation,\r\nthe answers that were demanded by theology and Scripture.\"[42]\r\n\r\nIs it, then, surprising that the famous William of Auxerre, after a\r\ncritical examination of her works, should compare her with Peter\r\nLombard, the celebrated \"Master of the Sentences,\"[43] and one of the\r\nmost learned of the Schoolmen, and write that Hildegard is\r\n_Sententiarum Magistra_--Mistress of the Sentences--and that \"in her\r\nworks the words are not human but divine\"? Has any woman writer ever\r\nreceived higher praise, and from one so competent to express an opinion\r\nas the scholarly divine of Auxerre?\r\n\r\n\r\nHerrad, the gifted abbess of Hohenburg in Alsace, was a contemporary of\r\nHildegard, and, like her, was noted for her culture and wide range of\r\nknowledge. She is chiefly known for her _Hortus Deliciarum_, a\r\nremarkable work, encyclopaedic in character, which she wrote for the nuns\r\nof her convent and which was designed to embody in words and in pictures\r\nthe knowledge of her age.\r\n\r\nNothing that time has bequeathed to us gives us a clearer conception of\r\nthe manifold activities of a mediaeval nunnery, of the industry, talents\r\nand enthusiastic love of learning of its inmates, than Herrad's\r\nwonderful _Garden of Delights_. Nor is there any other work that gives\r\nus a better knowledge of the manners, customs and ideals of the twelfth\r\ncentury, or one that, in its particular sphere, is of more value to the\r\nstudent of art, philology and archaeology. It exhibits Herrad's intense\r\ninterest in the intellectual advancement of her nuns and pupils as well\r\nas her superior talent and acquirements. Unfortunately the manuscript\r\ncopy of this work was destroyed at the time of the bombardment of\r\nStrasburg by the Germans in 1870, and our knowledge of it is limited to\r\nportions of it which had previously been transcribed or to accounts left\r\nof it by those who had examined it before its destruction. Of such\r\nexceptional value was this unique work that the editor of the great\r\ncollection of pictures, which illustrates this remarkable book, does not\r\nhesitate to declare that \"Few illuminated manuscripts had acquired a\r\nfame so well deserved as the _Hortus Deliciarum_ of Herrad.\"[44]\r\n\r\nNo sketch, however brief, of the literary nuns of mediaeval Germany would\r\nbe complete without some reference to the learned religious of the\r\nconvent of Helfta, near Eisleben in Saxony. Of the abbess Gertrude we\r\nread that her enthusiasm for knowledge was so great that she not only\r\ninspired others with the same enthusiasm, but that she was an incessant\r\ncollector of books, which she had her nuns transcribe. Among her most\r\ndistinguished subjects were two religious by the name of Matilda, one of\r\nwhom was her sister, and a third, who, to distinguish her from the\r\nabbess, is known as \"Gertrude the Great.\"\r\n\r\nThe writings of these nuns were inspired by that great mystic movement\r\nwhich then prevailed in various parts of Europe and are among the most\r\nimpassioned productions of the age. For this reason they still have a\r\nspecial claim on the attention of students of art and literature, as\r\nwell as those of theology and mysticism. Impressed by the similarity of\r\ntheir ideas and descriptions as compared with those found in Dante's\r\ngreat masterpiece, there are not wanting scholars who contend that the\r\nprototype of the Matelda in the earthly paradise of the _Purgatorio_ was\r\nnone other than one of the Matildas of the famous convent of Helfta.[45]\r\n\r\nThe writings of Hroswitha, Hildegard, Herrad, Gertrude and the Matildas,\r\nto speak of no others, are the best evidence of the studious character\r\nof the nuns of mediaeval times, and of their devotion to the cause of\r\neducation. They command, likewise, our admiration for the system of\r\ntraining which made such development possible, and show that, in certain\r\ndepartments, the schools as then conducted were on as high a plane as\r\nany we have to-day.[46] They show us, too, that nuns and convent-bred\r\nwomen of the age in question were of quite different mental calibre from\r\nthat of the \"gentle lady of chivalry living in her bower, playing upon\r\nher lute and waiting patiently for the return of her triumphant\r\nknight,\" and quite different, too, from that of the castle\r\nlady-loves--whose sole attractions were often no more than youth and\r\nbeauty--who inspired the impassioned lyrics of troubadour and\r\nminnesinger.\r\n\r\nA recent writer sums up in a few words the status and the\r\naccomplishments of the lady of the abbey in the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"No institution of Europe has ever won for the lady the freedom and\r\ndevelopment that she enjoyed in the convent in early days. The modern\r\ncollege for women only feebly reproduces it, since the college for women\r\nhas arisen at a time when colleges in general are under a cloud. The\r\nlady-abbess, on the other hand, was part of the two great social forces\r\nof her time, feudalism and the Church. Great spiritual rewards and great\r\nworldly prizes were alike within her grasp. She was treated as an equal\r\nby the men of her class, as is witnessed by letters we still have from\r\npopes and emperors to abbesses. She had the stimulus of competition with\r\nmen in executive capacity, in scholarship, and in artistic production,\r\nsince her work was freely set before the general public; but she was\r\nrelieved by the circumstances of her environment from the ceaseless\r\ncompetition in common life of woman with woman for the favor of the\r\nindividual man. In the cloister of the great days, as on a small scale\r\nin the college for women to-day, women were judged by each other as men\r\nare everywhere judged by each other, for sterling qualities of head and\r\nheart and character.\"[47]\r\n\r\nNor is this all. Never was woman more highly honored, never was her\r\npower and influence greater than during the period of conventual life\r\nextending from Hilda of Whitby to Gertrude and the Matildas of Helfta,\r\nand especially during that golden period of monasticism and chivalry\r\nwhen cloister and court were the radiant centers of learning and\r\nculture. Abbesses took part in ecclesiastical synods and councils and\r\nassisted in the deliberations of national assemblies. In England, they\r\nranked with lords temporal and spiritual, and had the right to attend\r\nthe king's council or to send proxies to represent them, while in\r\nGermany, where they held property directly from the king or emperor,\r\nthey enjoyed the rights and privileges of barons and, as such, took part\r\nin the proceedings of the imperial diet either in person or through\r\ntheir accredited representatives. In Saxony, the abbesses had the right\r\nto strike coins bearing their own portraits, notably the abbesses of\r\nGandersheim and Quedlinburg. In England they were invested with\r\nextraordinary powers, and in certain cases owed obedience to none save\r\nthe Pope. In Kent abbesses, as representatives of religion, came\r\nimmediately after bishops.\r\n\r\nPossessing such power and prestige, it is not surprising to learn that\r\nabbesses wielded great influence in temporal as well as spiritual\r\nmatters; that it pervaded politics and extended to the courts of kings\r\nand emperors. Thus, Matilda, the abbess of Quedlinburg, together with\r\nAdelheid, the mother of Otto III who was but three years old at the time\r\nof his father's death, practically ruled the empire. At a later period\r\nduring the prolonged absence in Italy of Otto III, the control of\r\naffairs was entrusted to the abbess alone; and so successful was her\r\nadministration, and so vigorous were the measures which she adopted\r\nagainst the invading Wends, that she commanded the admiration of all. In\r\nview of these facts, the learned authoress of _Woman Under Monasticism_\r\nis fully warranted in declaring as she does \"The career open to the\r\ninmates of convents in England and on the Continent was greater than any\r\nother ever thrown open to women in the course of modern European\r\nhistory.\"[48]\r\n\r\n\"The educational influence of convents during centuries,\" continues the\r\nsame writer, \"cannot be rated too highly. Not only did their inmates\r\nattain considerable knowledge but education in a nunnery, as we see from\r\nChaucer and others, secured an improved standing for those who were not\r\nprofessed.\"[49] It prepared the way for, if it did not train, those\r\nhighly educated women who appeared during the time of the transition\r\nbetween the Middle Ages and what is now designated as the Modern Period.\r\n\r\nAmong these were Christine de Pisan, who was a prolific writer on many\r\nsubjects in both prose and verse, and who, it is said, was the first\r\nwoman to earn a livelihood by her pen.[50] There were also some of those\r\nremarkable women who lectured on law in the University of Bologna, among\r\nwhom were Bettina Gozzadini,[51] who, some writers will have it,\r\noccupied the chairs of law in her _alma mater_ as early as 1236, and the\r\ncelebrated Novella d'Andrea, of the following century, who frequently\r\nacted as a substitute for her father, a professor of canon law in the\r\nuniversity, and who, by reason of her varied and profound knowledge,\r\nheld a prominent place among the most learned men of her time. Both of\r\nthese noted women were worthy prototypes of that long list of learned\r\nItalian women who, during the Renaissance, won such honor for themselves\r\nand such undying glory for their country. Not less remarkable were\r\nseveral women of the school of Salerno, who, during its palmiest days,\r\ndistinguished themselves as teachers, writers and medical\r\npractitioners,[52] and the still more remarkable daughters of one\r\nMangord, a professor of Paris, whose daughters taught Sacred\r\nScripture.[53] There were few in number, it is true, but they were the\r\nworthy prototypes of those learned and brilliant women who achieved such\r\ndistinction and glory for their sex during that most interesting period\r\nof history known as the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN AND EDUCATION DURING THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nBy the Renaissance we understand not only a phase in the development of\r\nthe nations of Europe but also that period of transition between the\r\nmediaeval and the modern world during which the latent spiritual energies\r\nof the Middle Ages developed into the intellectual forces and moral\r\nhabits of thought which now pervade the civilized world. Various dates\r\nare assigned for its starting point. Among them is the fall of\r\nConstantinople in 1453, when there was a great influx of scholars from\r\nthe famed metropolis on the Bosphorus to the Italian peninsula, who\r\nbrought with them those forgotten treasures of science and literature\r\nwhich were so instrumental in producing that interesting phenomenon\r\nknown in history as the Revival of Learning. But whatever date be\r\nassigned for the beginning of the Renaissance, whether it be the year\r\nwhen Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turk or the fateful\r\nmillennial year which was to witness the termination of all things,\r\nthere certainly was never at any period a distinct breach of historical\r\ncontinuity between the old order and the new.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true of Italy where the Renaissance had its origin.\r\nFor here, during the entire mediaeval period, there never was a time when\r\nthe study of antiquity was completely neglected; when the traditions of\r\nthe old Roman culture had died out, or when the art and the literature\r\nof the classical ages of the past had ceased to exert an influence on\r\nartists and scholars. Ozanam was, then, right when he declared that the\r\nnight of the Dark Age, which in Italy intervened between \"the\r\nintellectual daylight of antiquity and the dawn of the Renaissance,\"\r\nwas, in reality, like \"one of those luminous nights in which the fading\r\nbrightness of evening is prolonged into the first beaming of the\r\nmorning.\"[54]\r\n\r\nSo much, indeed, was this the case that those who have made the most\r\nprofound study of the Middle Ages recognize a first Renaissance in the\r\ntwelfth century, which was not less real than the Renaissance _par\r\nexcellence_ of the fifteenth century, a renaissance which counts such\r\nmasters of Latinity as Abelard, John of Salisbury and Hildebert of\r\nTours, and such schools as that of Chartres, where classical Latin was\r\ntaught with as much thoroughness as in the great universities of Europe\r\nduring the brilliant age of the humanists. It was then, as Rashdall\r\ntruly observes, that \"a revival of architecture heralded, as it usually\r\ndoes, a wider revival of Art. The schools of Christendom became thronged\r\nas they were never thronged before. A passion for enquiry took the place\r\nof the old routine. The Crusades brought different parts of Europe into\r\ncontact with one another and into contact with the new world of the\r\nEast--with a new religion and a new philosophy, with the Arabic\r\nAristotle, with the Arabic commentators on Aristotle, and eventually\r\neven with Aristotle in the original Greek.\"[55]\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the Renaissance attained its culmination during the\r\nsecond half of the fifteenth century. It was during this period that\r\ngunpowder and printing with movable types were invented--the first\r\ncompletely revolutionizing the methods of warfare and the second\r\nmarvelously facilitating the diffusion of knowledge. And it was during\r\nthe same period also that Vasco da Gama doubled the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nthat Columbus crossed the Sea of Darkness and that Copernicus laid the\r\nfoundation of modern astronomy.\r\n\r\nBut this wonderful half-century constituted only a small portion of the\r\nperiod embraced by the Renaissance. From the fall of Constantinople\r\nuntil it attained the highest phase of development in England, the\r\nRenaissance covers a period of nearly two centuries. The progress of the\r\nintellectual and moral movement which it represented, from the land of\r\nits birth, to the northern and western parts of Europe, was\r\ncomparatively slow. Thus, while Italy was exhibiting the full effulgence\r\nof the re-birth, England was still in the feudal condition of the Middle\r\nAges. A striking illustration of this truth is seen in the fact that \"a\r\nbrother of the Black Prince banqueted with Petrarch in the palace of\r\nGaleazzo Visconti--that is to say, the founder of Italian humanism, the\r\nrepresentative of Italian despotic state-craft, and the companion of\r\nFroissart's heroes met together at a marriage feast.\" \"In Italy,\" as\r\nSymonds has shown, \"the keynote was struck by the _Novella_, as in\r\nEngland by the drama.\"[56] The supreme exponents of the Renaissance as\r\nmanifested in literature were, without doubt, Ariosto in Italy, Rabelais\r\nin France, Cervantes in Spain, Camoens in Portugal, Erasmus in the\r\nNetherlands and Shakespeare in England.\r\n\r\nConsidering the splendid achievements of men during the Renaissance in\r\nevery department of intellectual activity, one would imagine that women\r\nalso would have attained to a somewhat proportionate distinction, at\r\nleast in literature and the arts. But, outside of Italy, this was far\r\nfrom being the case. In France, Spain, Portugal and England there were,\r\nit is true, a certain number of women who won distinction by their\r\ntalents and learning, but these were the exceptions which but served to\r\nthrow into greater relief the prevailing ignorance of the great mass of\r\ntheir sex, which had few, if any, of the advantages of instruction, even\r\nin the most elementary branches of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Italian women, as we have already seen, had commanded marked\r\nrecognition for their talents and learning even before the close of the\r\nMiddle Ages. The most famous of these were among those who, having\r\nobtained the doctorate, became lecturers and professors in the great\r\nuniversity of Bologna. The existence and accomplishments of some of\r\nthese may, perhaps, be more or less legendary, but there can be no doubt\r\nthat many of them, some before the time of the Renaissance, had gained a\r\nEuropean reputation for the breadth and variety of their attainments.\r\nBut it was during the Renaissance that the remarkable flowering of the\r\nintellect of the Italian woman was seen at its best. While the women in\r\nthe other parts of Europe, especially in England and Germany, were\r\nsuffering the ill effects consequent on the suppression of the convents,\r\nwhich, for centuries, had been almost the only schools available for\r\ngirls, the women of Italy were taking an active part in the great\r\neducational movement inaugurated by the revival of learning, and winning\r\nthe highest honors for their sex in every department of science, art and\r\nliterature. Not since the days of Sappho and Aspasia had woman attained\r\nsuch prominence, and never were they, irrespective of class-condition,\r\naccorded greater liberty, privileges or honor. The universities, which\r\nhad been opened to them at the close of the Middle Ages, gladly\r\nconferred upon them the doctorate, and eagerly welcomed them to the\r\nchairs of some of their most important faculties. The Renaissance was,\r\nindeed, the heydey of the intellectual woman throughout the whole of the\r\nItalian peninsula--a time when woman enjoyed the same scholastic freedom\r\nas men, and when Mme. de Stael's dictum, _Le genie n'a pas de sexe_,\r\nexpressed a doctrine admitted in practice and not an academic theory.\r\n\r\nIt would require a large volume, or rather many volumes, to do justice\r\nto the learned women of Italy who conferred such honor upon their sex\r\nduring the period we are considering. Suffice it to mention a few of\r\nthose who achieved special distinction and whose memories are still\r\ngreen in the land which had been made so illustrious by their talent and\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThat which the modern reader finds the most surprising in the Italian\r\nwomen of the Renaissance is their enthusiasm for the _literae\r\nhumaniores_--the Latin and Greek classics--and the proficiency which so\r\nmany of them, even at an early age, attained in the literature and\r\nphilosophy of antiquity. It was no uncommon thing for a girl in her\r\nteens to write and speak Latin, while many of them were almost equally\r\nfamiliar with Greek.[57] Thus Laura Brenzoni, of Verona, had such a\r\nmastery of these two languages that she wrote and spoke them with ease,\r\nwhile Alessandra Scala was so familiar with them that she employed them\r\nin writing poetry. Lorenza Strozzi, who was educated in a convent and\r\neventually became a nun, was distinguished for her great versatility,\r\nfor her profound knowledge of science and art, as well as for her\r\nproficiency in Latin and Greek. Her Latin poems were so highly valued\r\nthat they were translated into foreign languages. Livia Chiavello, of\r\nFabriano, was celebrated as one of the most brilliant representatives of\r\nthe Petrarchan school. Her style was so pure and noble that, had\r\nPetrarch not lived, she alone would have upheld the honor of the vulgar\r\ntongue. So successful was Isotta of Rimini in the cultivation of the\r\nMuses that she was hailed as another Sappho. Cassandra Fedele, of\r\nVenice, deserved, according to Polizian, the noted Florentine humanist,\r\nto be ranked with that famous universal genius, Pico de la Mirandola. So\r\nextensive were her attainments that in addition to being a thorough\r\nmistress of Latin and Greek, she was likewise distinguished in music,\r\neloquence, philosophy and even theology. Leo X, Louis XII of France, and\r\nIsabella of Spain were eager to have her as an ornament for their\r\ncourts, but the Venetian senate was so proud of its treasure that it was\r\nunwilling to have her depart. Catarina Cibo, of Genoa, was another\r\nprodigy of learning; for, besides a knowledge of Latin and Greek,\r\nphilosophy and theology, she was well acquainted with Hebrew. Donna\r\nFelice Rasponi, of Ravenna, devoted herself to the study of Plato and\r\nAristotle, of Scripture and the Fathers. But, for the extent and variety\r\nof her attainments, Tarquinia Molza seems to have eclipsed all her\r\ncontemporaries. She had as teachers the ablest scholars of an age of\r\ndistinguished scholars. Not only did she excel in poetry and the fine\r\narts, but she also had a rare knowledge of astronomy and mathematics,\r\nLatin, Greek and Hebrew. And so great was the esteem in which she was\r\nheld that the senate of Rome conferred on her the singular honor of\r\nRoman citizenship, transmissible in perpetuity to her descendants. The\r\nSovereign Pontiff and the flower of the Roman prelacy begged her to take\r\nup her residence in the Eternal City, but she could not be prevailed\r\nupon to leave the land of her birth.\r\n\r\nIn the arts of sculpture and painting the women of Italy, during the\r\nRenaissance, were no less illustrious than they were in science,\r\nliterature and philosophy. Indeed, many of the treasures in the Italian\r\nchurches and art galleries that still delight all lovers of the\r\nbeautiful are from the chisel and the brush of women who achieved\r\ndistinction between three and four centuries ago.[58]\r\n\r\nProbably the most famous sculptress was Properzia de Rossi, whose\r\nability was so remarkable that she excited the envy of the men who were\r\nher competitors.[59] Among painters there was Suor Plantilla Nelli, who\r\nwas a nun and prioress in the convent of Santa Catarina in Florence.\r\nBoth Lanzi and Vasari bestow high praise on her work and declare some of\r\nher productions to be of rare excellence. There were also Maria Angela\r\nCrisculo, of whose splendid work many examples are still preserved in\r\nthe churches of Naples, and Lavinia Fontana of Bologna, who exhibited\r\nsuch extraordinary ability as an artist that some of her pictures passed\r\nfor the work of her great contemporary, Guido Reni.[60] Still more\r\nremarkable were the achievements of four sisters of the noted family\r\nAnguisciola of Cremona. So admirable was the work of the eldest sister,\r\nSofonisba, that Philip II invited her to his court in Spain, where she\r\nexcited the amazement of every one by the splendid canvases which she\r\nexecuted for her illustrious patron and for the members of the royal\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nOf the fifty female poets who flourished in Italy during the Renaissance\r\nthe most eminent were Gaspara Stampa, Veronica Gambara, and Vittoria\r\nColonna. Of such merit and exquisite finish were the productions of\r\ntheir Muse that they are still read with never failing pleasure. So\r\nhighly did Cardinal Bembo,--the famous \"dictator of letters\"--value the\r\nscholarship and critical acumen of Veronica Gambara that he never\r\npublished anything without previously submitting it to her judgment. But\r\nfar more eminent as a poet was the noble and accomplished Marchesa of\r\nPescara, Vittoria Colonna, who, on account of her talents and virtues,\r\nwas named _La Divina_. The friend and adviser of scholars and the\r\nconfidante of princes, she represented, as has truly been said, \"the\r\nbest phases of the Renaissance, its learning, its intelligence, its\r\nenthusiasm, its subtle Platonism, combined with a profound religious\r\nfaith and the trace of the mysticism of a simpler age.\" The chorus of\r\nuniversal praise which was sung by her contemporaries is well echoed by\r\nAriosto when he writes of her: \"She has not only made herself immortal\r\nby her beautiful style, of which I have heard not better, but she can\r\nraise from the tomb those of whom she speaks or writes and make them\r\nlive forever.\" But it was as the friend and inspirer of Michaelangelo\r\nthat she is best known to us to-day. \"Without wings,\" he writes to her,\r\n\"I fly with your wings; by your genius I am raised to the skies; in your\r\nsoul my thought is born.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those who specially distinguished themselves for their profound\r\nscholarship, as exhibited in the halls of universities, were Dorotea\r\nBucca, who occupied a chair of medicine in the University of Bologna,\r\nwhere, by reason of her rare eloquence and learning, she had students\r\nfrom all parts of Europe; Laura Ceretta, of Brescia, who, during seven\r\nyears, gave public lectures on philosophy; Battista Malatesta, of\r\nUrbino, who taught philosophy with such marked success that the most\r\ndistinguished professors of the day were forced to recognize themselves\r\nas her inferiors; and Fulvia Olympia Morati, who \"at the age of fourteen\r\nwrote Latin letters and dialogues in Greek and Latin in the style of\r\nPlato and Cicero,\" and who, when she was scarcely sixteen, \"was invited\r\nto give lectures in the University of Ferrara on the philosophical\r\nproblems of the _Paradoxes of Cicero_.\" So great, indeed, was her\r\nknowledge of the ancient languages that she was offered the\r\nprofessorship of Greek in the University of Heidelberg; but death cut\r\nshort her brilliant career before she could enter upon her duties in\r\nthis famed institution of learning. It was female professors of this\r\ntype--masters of Greek and Latin letters, who in the words of a recent\r\nwriter, \"sent forth from Italy such students as Moritz von Spiegelberg\r\nand Rudolph Agricola, to reform the instruction of Deventer and Zwoll\r\nand prepare the way for Erasmus and Reuchlin.\"\r\n\r\nIn the preceding list of learned women--and but a few only have been\r\nnamed of the many who in every city of importance conferred undying\r\nglory on their sex--it is clear that the Renaissance in Italy was,\r\nindeed, the golden age of women. Never in history had they greater\r\nfreedom of action in things of the mind; never were they, except\r\nprobably in the case of the English and German abbesses of the Middle\r\nAges, treated with more marked deference and consideration or fairness;\r\nnever were their efforts more highly appreciated or more generously\r\nrewarded, and never was their success more highly and enthusiastically\r\napplauded. Temporal and spiritual rulers, princes and cardinals, Popes\r\nand emperors vied with one another in paying just tribute to woman's\r\ngenius as well as to woman's virtue. The nun in the cloister as well as\r\nthe lady in the palace shared in the general enthusiasm for learning,\r\nand they enjoyed throughout the peninsula the same opportunities as men\r\nand received the same recognition for their work. Everywhere the\r\nintellectual arena was open to them on the same terms as to men.\r\nIncapacity and not sex was the only bar to entrance.\r\n\r\nBut the men of those days, especially scholars of the type of Bembo,\r\nPolitian and Ariosto, were liberal and broad-minded men, who never for a\r\nmoment imagined that a woman was out of her sphere or unsexed because\r\nshe wore a doctor's cap or occupied a university chair. And far from\r\nstigmatizing her as a singular or strong-minded woman, they recognized\r\nher as one who had but enhanced the graces and virtues of her sex by the\r\nadded attractions of a cultivated mind and a developed intellect. Not\r\nonly did she escape the shafts of satire and ridicule, which are so\r\nfrequently aimed at the educated woman of to-day, but she was called\r\ninto the councils of temporal and spiritual rulers as well.\r\n\r\nWoe betide the ill-advised misogynist who should venture to declaim\r\nagainst the inferiority of the female sex, or to protest against the\r\nhonors which an appreciative and a chivalrous age bestowed upon it with\r\nso lavish a hand. The women of Italy, unlike those of other nations,\r\nknew how to defend themselves, and were not afraid to take, when\r\noccasion demanded, the pen in self-defense. This is evidenced by\r\nnumerous works which were written in response to certain narrow-minded\r\npamphleteers--_miseri pedanti_, pitiful pedants,--who would have the\r\nactivities of women limited to the nursery or the kitchen.[61]\r\n\r\nA striking characteristic of these learned women was the entire absence\r\nof all priggism or pedantry. Whether lecturing on law or philosophy, or\r\ndiscoursing in Latin before Popes and cardinals, or taking part in\r\ndiscussions on art and literature with the eminent humanists of the day,\r\nthey ever retained that beautiful simplicity which gives such a charm to\r\ntrue greatness of mind and is the best index of true scholarship and\r\nnoble, symmetrical womanhood.\r\n\r\nNor did the rare intellectual attainments of these daughters of Italy\r\ndestroy that harmony of creation which, some will have it, is sure to be\r\njeopardized by giving women the same educational advantages as men. So\r\nfar was this from being the case that there were never more loyal and\r\nhelpful wives nor more devoted and stimulating mothers than there were\r\namong those women who wrote verses in the language of Sappho, or\r\ndelivered public addresses in the tongue of Cicero. Still less did their\r\nserious and long-protracted studies entail any of the dangers we hear so\r\nmuch of nowadays. The large and healthy families of many of them prove\r\nthat intellectual work, even of the highest order, is not incompatible\r\nwith motherhood; and still less that it, _per se_, conduces, as is so\r\noften asserted, to race-suicide. These facts are commended to the\r\nconsideration of our modern opponents of the higher education of women\r\nand to those militant conservatives and old-time reactionaries who are\r\nstill averse to opening the doors of some of our older universities to\r\nwomen--even such universities as Oxford, several of whose colleges were\r\nfounded on the revenues derived from suppressed educational institutions\r\nwhich had been built and used for generations for the sole behoof of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nBut distinguished as were the women of Italy for their culture and\r\nscholarship, they were yet more distinguished as patrons of learning, as\r\nleaders and inspirers of the eminent men who were the chief\r\nrepresentatives of the Renaissance. Reference has already been made to\r\nthe influence of Vittoria Colonna on Michaelangelo--\"who saw with her\r\neyes, acted by her inspiration, was lifted by her beyond the stars\"--but\r\nthis is only one of many similar instances that might be adduced.\r\nIndeed, to the student of the Italian Renaissance, the most interesting\r\nfeature of it was, not its women doctors and professors, but those noble\r\nand accomplished ladies who made the courts of Ferrara, Mantua, Milan\r\nand Urbino the most noted intellectual centers of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful ornaments of the first three courts were Renee,\r\nduchess of Ferrara; Isabella d'Este, marchioness of Mantua, and Beatrice\r\nd'Este, duchess of Milan. They were all women of exceptional learning\r\nand culture, and each was the center of a galaxy of talent such as is\r\nrarely witnessed in any one place.\r\n\r\nAmong the men attracted to their courts were the most illustrious\r\nscholars, artists, poets and musicians of the Renaissance. Here they\r\nfound congenial homes and breathed an atmosphere made fragrant by the\r\nappreciation shown by their charming hostesses for their power and\r\ngenius. Here they found inspiration and a stimulus that spurred them on\r\nto their greatest achievements. In Ferrara, where it was said that\r\n\"there were as many poets as there were frogs in the country round\r\nabout,\" were gathered the most gifted poets of the Renaissance who had\r\nbeen attracted there to recite their latest masterpieces. Among them\r\nwere Clement Marot, the first poet of modern France, and Ariosto, the\r\nimmortal author of _Orlando Furioso_. There were the great painters,\r\nTitian and Bellini, and the illustrious poet, Torquato Tasso, whose love\r\nsubsequently immortalized Renee's youngest daughter Leonora.\r\n\r\nA similar artistic and intellectual supremacy was held by Isabelle\r\nd'Este. For portrait painters she had Titian and Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nwhile, as decorators of her home, she had Bellini and Perugino, whose\r\ncompositions she herself arranged, even in the minutest details. So it\r\nwas likewise in the gay and brilliant court of Beatrice d'Este, in\r\nMilan,--a place where artists and scholars of all nationalities were\r\nalways sure of a cordial welcome.\r\n\r\nBut the ideal center of intellectual culture was the court of Urbino,\r\nthe central figure of which was the learned and accomplished Elizabetta\r\nGonzaga. This picturesque city of the eastern slope of the Apennines was\r\nthen to Italy what Athens had been to Greece in the days of Pericles;\r\nand Elizabetta was to its court what Aspasia was in her own matchless\r\nsalon--the magnet which attracted all the artists and men of letters of\r\nthe age.\r\n\r\nCastiglione, whose great work, _The Courtier_, was partly written as a\r\nmemorial of the peerless woman who inspired it, gives us a vivid picture\r\nof \"the fair ladies, with their quick intelligence and ready sympathy,\"\r\ndiscussing questions of art, literature, philosophy and Platonism, with\r\nthe most eminent scholars and artists of Europe. But Castiglione\r\nconfesses that he is unable to give us more than the mere outline of the\r\npicture. \"To paint the polished society of Urbino,\" as has been well\r\nsaid, \"we should need colors no palette contains--transparencies of the\r\nGrecian sky, the indigo of certain seas, the liquid azure of certain\r\neyes. For more than a century the court of Urbino was regarded as the\r\nsupreme exemplar. In the seventeenth century, the Hotel de Rambouillet\r\nwas still striving to make itself a copy of it; unluckily such things as\r\nthese are not easily copied.\"[62]\r\n\r\nWe are not surprised, then, at being told that \"men moulded by Italian\r\nladies\"--such ladies as graced the court of Urbino--\"could be\r\ndistinguished among a thousand.\" Still less are we surprised to note the\r\nimmense difference between the refined and brilliant discussions of _The\r\nCourtier_ as compared with the coarse tales of the _Decameron_ and\r\n_Heptameron_. And we can understand the marvelous influence which\r\nCastiglione's matchless work--inspired by the beloved Duchess\r\nElizabetta--had upon the masters of English literature--on Shakespeare,\r\nBen Jonson, Spenser, Marlow, Shelley.\r\n\r\nCardinal Bembo, who was one of the most assiduous frequenters of this\r\nfamous court, in writing of Elizabetta, does not hesitate to declare: \"I\r\nhave seen many excellent and noble women, and have heard of some who\r\nwere as illustrious for certain qualities, but in her alone among women,\r\nall virtues were united and brought together. I have never seen nor\r\nheard of any one who was her equal, and know very few who have even come\r\nnear her.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Castiglione's experience at the court of Urbino, where he was a\r\ndaily witness of the irresistible influence of Elizabetta, that made him\r\ngive expression to the sentiment, \"Man has for his portion physical\r\nstrength and external activities; all doing must be his, all inspiration\r\nmust come from woman.\" It was also this keen student of the mysterious\r\nworkings of woman's genius and of her secret, all-pervading influence,\r\nat times and in places least suspected, who penned the notable\r\nstatement--worthy of the Renaissance--\"Without women nothing is\r\npossible, either in military courage, or art, or poetry, or music, or\r\nphilosophy, or even religion. God is truly seen only through them.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few words are necessary to tell of the learned women of the\r\nRenaissance outside of Italy. On account of its intimate connection with\r\nthe Italian peninsula, Spain was the second country in Europe to\r\nexperience the effects of the new intellectual movement. Among the\r\neducated Italians whom Isabella, the Catholic, had attracted to her\r\ncourt were the brothers Geraldini, whom she appointed as teachers of her\r\nchildren. Of her daughter, Juana, Juan Vives, the eminent Spanish\r\nscholar, says she was able to make impromptu speeches in Latin, while\r\nCatherine, who became the wife of Henry VIII, excited the admiration of\r\nErasmus by the extent and accuracy of her knowledge. It was from\r\nSalamanca that Isabella summoned her own teacher of Latin, the learned\r\nBeatrix Galindo,[63] who was a professor of rhetoric in the university\r\nlong before Elizabeth of England had studied the language of Virgil\r\nunder Ascham.\r\n\r\nThen there was Francisca de Lebrixa who often filled the chair of her\r\nfather, who was professor of history and rhetoric in the University of\r\nAlcala, and Isabella Losa, of Cordova, who, among her other\r\nacquirements, counted a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. To his learned\r\ndaughters, Gregoria and Luisa, Antonio Perez, minister of Philip II,\r\nwrote saying: \"Do not imagine, when you are writing to me, that you are\r\naddressing Cicero or some Greek author; lower your style to my level.\"\r\nThere were also Isabella de Joya, who commented on Scotus Erigena;\r\nCatherine Ribera, the bard of love and faith; Dona Maria Pacheco de\r\nMendoza; Bernarda Ferreyra, to whom, on account of her rare scholarship,\r\nLopez de Vega dedicated his beautiful elegy _Phillis_; Juana Morella,\r\nwho, besides having a profound knowledge of music, philosophy, divinity\r\nand jurisprudence, was the mistress of fourteen languages; Juana de la\r\nCruz, the famous Mexican nun whose poetry of superior merit, as well as\r\nher exceptional attainments in many branches of knowledge, won for her\r\nthe epithet of the \"Tenth Muse\"; Luisa Sigea, who besides being a poet\r\nwas a mistress of the classical and several oriental languages,\r\nincluding Hebrew and Syro-Chaldaic, and other learned women whom \"no one\r\nwas astonished to see taking by main force the first rank in the spheres\r\nof literature, philosophy and theology.\"\r\n\r\nSo profoundly had the Renaissance affected the women of a limited circle\r\nin England, that Erasmus could declare without exaggeration: \"It is\r\ncharming to see the female sex demand classical instruction. The queen\r\nis remarkably learned and her daughter writes good Latin. The home of\r\nMore is truly the abode of the Muses.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen of whom Erasmus speaks is Catherine of Aragon, who was\r\neducated in Spain, who was a pupil of Vives, and who, besides having a\r\nthorough knowledge of Latin and Greek, was well acquainted with several\r\nmodern languages. The daughters of Sir Thomas More were among the most\r\nlearned women of their time and were, indeed, worthy of dwelling in \"the\r\nhome of the Muses.\"\r\n\r\nLady Jane Grey read Plato in the original at the age of thirteen.[64]\r\nAnne, Margaret and Jane Seymour were likewise celebrated for their\r\nknowledge of the classics, as were Anne Boleyn and Mary Stuart, who both\r\nreceived their education in France, and especially Queen Elizabeth, who\r\nwas not only one of the most learned women of her time but was probably\r\nalso the most learned queen England has ever produced. There were,\r\nhowever, no university professors or poets of eminence among the English\r\nwomen, as there were in Italy and Spain, and their creative work was\r\npractically nothing.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Hroswitha, Gertrude, the Matildas and Hildegard, the\r\nlearned woman has never been the ideal woman in Germany. When Olympia\r\nMorati was on her way from Ferrara to Heidelberg to take the chair of\r\nGreek, she found the daughters of professors and humanists devoting\r\nthemselves to sewing and embroidery instead of art and literature. Anna,\r\nthe eldest daughter of Melanchthon, was almost alone among the German\r\nwomen of the Renaissance who had a knowledge of Latin.\r\n\r\nIn France the most learned woman of her time was undoubtedly Margaret of\r\nAngouleme, queen of Navarre. So great was her knowledge and so\r\nenthusiastic was she in promoting the study of the Latin and Greek\r\nclassics that Michelet, with something of exaggeration, perhaps, calls\r\nher \"the amiable mother of the Renaissance in France.\"[65] She was noted\r\nfor her devotion to the study of Scripture and theology as well as Greek\r\nand Hebrew. She always had around her, or was in correspondence with,\r\nthe most distinguished scholars, poets, artists, philosophers and\r\ntheologians of the age, and undoubtedly did much, as a patroness of men\r\nof letters, toward furthering the literary movement in France. She is,\r\nhowever, chiefly known to modern readers by her _Heptameron_--a work\r\nwhich reveals too clearly the tastes of her associates and the manners\r\nand customs of the time.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Margaret of Navarre, there were but few literary\r\nwomen of more than ephemeral reputation during the French Renaissance.\r\nAmong these Louise Labe deserves mention, as she was the most\r\ndistinguished poetess in France during the sixteenth century.[66] She,\r\nlike Margaret, was the center of a coterie of men of letters; but the\r\nreunions over which she presided, as well as those of the author of the\r\n_Heptameron_, were entirely lacking in the dignity and refinement of\r\nthose of the polished court of Urbino in the days of the peerless\r\nElizabetta Gonzaga.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said respecting the rare learning of the women of the\r\nRenaissance, one might infer that women in general enjoyed special\r\neducational facilities during this period of intellectual activity.\r\nParadoxical as it may seem, the very contrary was the case. For, as\r\nhistory tells us, the education of the Renaissance was essentially\r\naristocratic. It was only for the women of the nobility and for the\r\nwives and daughters of scholars, while the great majority of the sex\r\nremained in a state of complete illiteracy.\r\n\r\nThe environment of the daughters of scholars was peculiarly favorable to\r\ntheir intellectual development, and learning was in a certain measure\r\ntheir natural heritage. They did not receive their education in schools,\r\nfor there were then few or no schools for girls, but from their fathers\r\nor from the men of letters who frequented their homes. A typical home of\r\nthis kind was that of the noted savant, Robert Estienne of Paris,\r\nprinter to Francis I. Here the language of conversation was Latin, not\r\nonly for the members of the family but also for the servants as\r\nwell.[67] Under such conditions we are not surprised to be informed\r\nthat the girls, as well as the boys, learned to speak Latin as well as\r\ntheir mother tongue. And listening, as they did, to the daily\r\ndiscussions on art and literature by the most learned men of a most\r\nlearned age, it was inevitable that they should acquire those vast\r\nstores of knowledge on all subjects that so excite the astonishment of\r\nour less studious women of to-day.\r\n\r\nWith the daughters of the nobility it was the same. In their youth they\r\nhad, under the paternal roof, the benefit of the instruction of the most\r\neminent masters of the time. And as they grew up their constant\r\nintercourse with learned men and the part they took in all literary and\r\nsocial assemblies, which were so prominent a feature of the period,\r\nenabled them to complete their education under the most favorable\r\nauspices, and to have, before they were out of their teens, a fund of\r\ninformation on all subjects that could not be obtained so well, even in\r\nthe best of our modern institutions of learning.\r\n\r\nIt was to these daughters of the elite--_ingenuae puellae_--that Erasmus\r\nand Vives addressed their treatises on education. They were the\r\nprivileged class at whose disposition were placed all the treasures of\r\nGreek and Latin letters. It was, then, an easy matter for them to write\r\npoetry and dissertations in the languages of Horace and Plato. And it\r\nwas often a necessity for them to speak Latin, for it was then the\r\nuniversal language of the learned--the language that was understood\r\neverywhere--in England as in Italy, in Germany as in France, in Flanders\r\nas well as in Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nIt was then that The Republic of Letters was a reality as never before;\r\nthat the man of letters was, of a truth, \"a citizen of the world\"; that\r\nhis country was wherever the cult of letters had priests or devotees. He\r\nwas what the ballad singer was during the Middle Ages, but with more\r\ndignity and seriousness. He was the agent and representative of\r\nintellectual life, the living symbol of the unity and solidarity of the\r\nhuman mind. And as in time he linked the past to the present so likewise\r\nin space he bound all peoples together and belonged equally to all. Such\r\nwas Erasmus of Holland, who was equally at home in France and\r\nSwitzerland, in Italy and England--everywhere received with the honor\r\naccorded to princes of the blood royal. Such was Vives, of Spain, the\r\nteacher of Catherine of Aragon, of Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII--at\r\none time professor in Louvain, at another in Oxford--always and\r\neverywhere an ardent exponent of humanism for women as well as for men.\r\nSuch was Politian and such were scores of his contemporaries, who\r\ncarried the torch of knowledge from castle to castle and from court to\r\ncourt, where maidens equally with youths enjoyed all the advantages\r\nderivable from the lessons of such distinguished teachers and such\r\neminent leaders of culture.\r\n\r\nFor it was a peculiarity of the scholar of the Renaissance that he was a\r\ngreat traveler--seeking knowledge wherever it was to be found--and\r\ncarrying it with him whithersoever he went. He journeyed from university\r\nto university, everywhere exchanging views with his intellectual\r\ncompeers, and everywhere diffusing the knowledge he had so laboriously\r\nacquired. The consequence was a wonderful uniformity of education among\r\nthe higher classes--among women as well as among men--something that was\r\nnever known before. Through the generally diffused knowledge of Latin,\r\nthe common literary medium of communication, all the nations of Europe,\r\neven those at war with one another, were brought together in an\r\nintellectual brotherhood and in a way which gave scholarship a power and\r\na prestige that accrued to the benefit of women and men alike.\r\n\r\nBut the educational advantages enjoyed by the women of the Renaissance\r\nwere not for the bourgeoisie--not for the daughters of peasants,\r\ntradesmen and artisans. They were solely, as has been stated, for the\r\nbenefit of the children of princes or of scholars--of those only who\r\ncould claim either nobility of birth or nobility of genius.[68] Even the\r\nmost zealous of the humanists would have been surprised if they had been\r\nasked to diffuse a portion of their light among the women of the masses.\r\nFor education, as they viewed it, was something solely for the\r\nelect--for ladies of the court and not for women of a lower condition.\r\nSo far as the rest of womankind was concerned, their occupation was\r\nlimited, according to a Breton saying, to looking after altar, hearth,\r\nand children--\"_La femme se doit garder l'autel, le feu, les enfants_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, too, that men began, especially in France and\r\nGermany, to revive the anti-feminist crusade which had so retarded the\r\nliterary movement among the women of ancient Greece and Rome. They\r\nrefused to hear women and intellect spoken of together. The Germans\r\nrecognized no intelligence in them apart from domestic duties, and\r\nseemed to belong to that strange race, that has not yet died out, which\r\nbelieves woman to be \"afflicted with the radical incapacity to acquire\r\nan individual idea.\" \"What the Italians called intelligence a German\r\nwould call tittle-tattle, trickery, the spirit of opposition. They\r\nrejected such gratifications and had no intention of allowing Delilah to\r\nshear them.\"[69]\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of Luther, the intellectual aspirations of women were\r\nnot only an absurdity, but were also a positive peril. \"Take them,\" he\r\nsays, \"from their housewifery and they are good for nothing.\" He treated\r\nthe humanist Vives, preceptor of Mary Tudor, as \"a dangerous spirit,\"\r\nbecause the learned Spaniard was an ardent advocate of the higher\r\neducation of women. As to abstract and severe studies they were for\r\ngirls, according to one of Luther's contemporaries, but \"vain and futile\r\nquackeries.\" For an accomplished woman to quote the Fathers or the\r\nancient classical writers was to provoke ridicule, because to do so was\r\nconsidered an indication of pedantry or affectation. Montaigne gave\r\nexpression to the age-old prejudice against woman by refusing to regard\r\nher as anything but a pretty animal, while Rabelais, the coryphaeus of\r\nthe French Renaissance, declared that \"Nature in creating woman lost the\r\ngood sense which she had displayed in the creation of all other things.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the views of the great leaders of thought and formers of\r\npublic opinion respecting the mental inferiority of woman--views which,\r\noutside of Italy, had, with few exceptions, the cordial approval of the\r\nsupercilious, cockahoop male--is it necessary to add that the\r\nRenaissance did nothing for popular education? The masses of women,\r\nespecially after the suppression of the convent schools in England and\r\nGermany, were, in many parts of Europe, and notably in the two countries\r\nmentioned, in a worse condition than they were during the Dark Ages.[70]\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN AND EDUCATION BETWEEN THE RENAISSANCE AND THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\r\n\r\nThe period following the Renaissance was not a brilliant one for woman,\r\nespecially outside of Italy. For in this favored land, even after the\r\ndecadence in literature that followed the glorious cinquecento,\r\nintellectual life opposed so effective a barrier to the forces of\r\nextinction which were at work in other parts of Europe, notably Germany\r\nand England, that there were still in every part of the peninsula from\r\nthe fertile plains of Lombardy to the sunny Ionian sea, learned and\r\ncultured women who were eager to emulate the achievements of their\r\nillustrious sisters of Italy's golden age of art, and letters. We do\r\nnot, it is true, find among them a Properzia de Rossi, a Veronica\r\nGambara, or a Vittoria Colonna; but we find many earnest and\r\nenthusiastic students in every department of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThat which most impresses the student of education during this period of\r\nItalian history is not the splendor of art and letters in court and\r\ncastle, which so dazzled Europe during the time of Renee of Ferrara and\r\nElizabetta Gonzaga of Urbino. We find, it is true, a goodly number of\r\nwomen who won distinction as poets and artists; but it is rather those\r\nwho were devoted to more serious studies that arrest our\r\nattention--women who attained eminence in physical and natural science,\r\nin mathematics, in the classical and oriental languages, in philosophy,\r\nlaw and theology. Space precludes the mention of more than a few of\r\nthese, but these few may be accepted as typical of many others almost\r\nequally distinguished.\r\n\r\nChief among those of whom their countrymen are specially proud are\r\nRosanna Somaglia Landi, of Milan, linguist and translator of Anacreon;\r\nMaria Selvaggia Borghini, of Pisa, translator of the works of\r\nTertullian; Eleonora Barbapiccola, of Salerno, who translated into\r\nItalian the _Principa Philosophiae_ of Descartes; Maria Angela\r\nArginghelli, of Naples, who was famed for her profound knowledge of\r\nphysics and the higher mathematics and who gave an Italian version of\r\nStephen Hales' _Vegetable Statics_. Then there was Clelia Grillo\r\nBorromeo, of Genoa, who was so distinguished in science, mathematics,\r\nmechanics and languages that a medal was struck in her honor bearing the\r\ninscription, _Gloria Genuensium_--glory of the Genoese; and the still\r\nmore famous Elena Cornaro Piscopia, of Venice, who was truly a prodigy\r\nof learning as well as a paragon of virtue. In addition to a knowledge\r\nof many modern, classical and oriental tongues, she exhibited remarkable\r\nproficiency in astronomy, mathematics, music, philosophy and theology.\r\nAfter a course of study in the University of Padua and after the usual\r\nexamination and discourse in classic Latin on some of the questions of\r\nAristotelian philosophy, she had the doctorate of philosophy conferred\r\non her in the cathedral of Padua, in the presence of thousands of\r\nlearned men and applauding students from all parts of Europe. But not\r\ncontent with conferring on this extraordinary woman the ring, wreath of\r\nlaurel and the ermine mozetta--the usual insignia of the doctorate--the\r\nUniversity, as a special mark of distinction, had a medal coined in\r\nhonor of the illustrious graduate bearing her effigy, with the words, as\r\nthe decree of the University expressed it, _ad perpetuam rei memoriam_.\r\nThat there was nothing superficial about this young woman's knowledge of\r\nlanguages, it suffices to state that she was able to speak Latin and\r\nGreek as fluently as her own Italian, and that so profound was her\r\nknowledge of divinity that there were many distinguished ecclesiastics\r\nin both Italy and France who favored conferring on her the doctorate in\r\ntheology.\r\n\r\nAmong other young women who obtained the doctorate in various\r\nuniversities were Maddalena Canedi-Noe and Maria Vittoria Dosi who,\r\nafter the usual course of study in the university of Bologna, obtained\r\nthe degree of doctor of civil law, and Maria Pellegrina Amoretti, who\r\nreceived the degree of doctor in both canon and civil law in the\r\nUniversity of Pavia and with it the doctor's cap--_berreto dottorale_.\r\nBut more remarkable for learning than any of these university graduates\r\nwas Maria Gaetana Agnesi, one of the most extraordinary women scholars\r\nof all time. On account of her wonderful knowledge of languages she was\r\ncalled \"The Oracle of Seven Tongues.\" This, however, is not her chief\r\ntitle to fame. It is rather her marvelous achievements in the domain of\r\nthe higher mathematics. After the appearance of her most noted work,\r\n_Instituzioni Analytiche_, she would at once have been elected a member\r\nof the French Academy of Sciences had not the laws of this learned body\r\nprecluded the admission of women.[71] That great Maecenas of learning,\r\nBenedict XIV, showed his appreciation of Maria Gaetana's exceptional\r\nattainments by appointing her--_motu proprio_--to the chair of higher\r\nmathematics in the University of Bologna. A similar honor had, in the\r\npreceding century, been conferred on Marta Marchina, of Naples, when, on\r\naccount of her rare knowledge of letters, philosophy and theology, she\r\nwas offered a chair in the Sapienza, in Rome, an honor which her modesty\r\nand love of retirement caused her to decline.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that women professors achieved distinction in the Italian\r\nuniversities even as early as the closing centuries of the Middle Ages.\r\nThe same was true during the Renaissance, and it has been equally true\r\nduring the period that has elapsed since the cinquecento.\r\n\r\nAmong the most eminent of those who taught in the universities were\r\nLaura Bassi, who had the chair of physics in the University of Bologna,\r\nand Clotilde Tambroni, professor of the Greek language and literature in\r\nthe same institution of learning. So thorough was her knowledge of the\r\nlanguage of Plato that it was the opinion of her contemporaries that\r\nthere were then only three persons in Europe who equaled her in her\r\nmastery of this classic tongue. It was this distinguished Hellenist who\r\ngraciously delivered the address when one of her countrywomen, Maria\r\ndalle Donne, received her doctorate in medicine and surgery. After her\r\ngraduation Dr. dalle Donne was given charge of a school for midwives in\r\nwhich she rendered the greatest service to her sex. Even the chair of\r\nanatomy in the University of Bologna was held by a woman, Anna\r\nMorandi-Menzolini, and her work was of the highest order. The same\r\nposition was held by another woman, Maria Petraccini-Terretti, in the\r\nUniversity of Ferrara.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between the attitude of the universities of Italy and\r\nthose of other parts of the world toward women as students and\r\nprofessors! For a thousand years the doors of the Italian universities\r\nhave been open to women, as well as to men; and for a thousand years\r\nwomen, as well as men, have received their degrees from these noble and\r\nliberal institutions, and occupied the most important positions in their\r\ngift, and that, too, with the approval and encouragement of both\r\nspiritual and temporal rulers. For these wise and broad-minded men did\r\nnot regard it unwomanly for Laura Bassi to teach physics, for Clotilde\r\nTambroni to teach Greek, for Dorotea Bucca to teach medicine, for Maria\r\nGaetana to teach differential and integral calculus, for Anna Morandi to\r\nteach anatomy, for Novella d'Andrea to teach canon law, or even, if we\r\nmay believe Denifle, one of the best of authorities, for the daughters\r\nof a Paris professor to teach theology.[72] Yes, what a contrast,\r\nindeed, between the Universities of Bologna and Padua, with their long\r\nand honored list of women graduates and professors, and the\r\nUniversities of Cambridge and Oxford from which women have always been\r\nand are still excluded, both as students and professors.\r\n\r\nContrast, also, the honors shown to women as students and professors of\r\nmedicine in Salerno, in the thirteenth century, with the riots excited\r\namong the chivalrous male students of the University of Edinburgh, when,\r\nless than a half century ago, seven young women applied for the\r\nprivilege of attending the courses of lectures on medicine and surgery\r\nin that institution. And contrast the sympathy and encouragement of\r\nItaly with the almost brutal opposition which women in our own country\r\nencountered when, but a few decades ago, they applied for admittance to\r\nthe medical schools of New York and Philadelphia. The difference between\r\nthe Italian and the Anglo-Saxon attitude toward women in the\r\nall-important matters in question requires no comment.[73]\r\n\r\nOne reason for the great difference between the women of Italy and those\r\nof other parts of Europe in the matter of higher education during the\r\nperiod we have been considering was the old Roman spirit of independence\r\nof the former and their always insisting on what they regarded as their\r\nnatural and indefeasible rights. Following the example of the matrons of\r\nancient Rome, they insisted on being treated as the equals of men, and,\r\nas a consequence, they demanded in the intellectual order all the\r\nadvantages that were accorded to men. They would never admit their\r\nmental inferiority to man, and woe betide the luckless wight who even\r\ninsinuated such inferiority. The shafts of satire and ridicule were at\r\nonce directed against him by a score of women who were able to use the\r\npen as well as, if not better than, himself. Sometimes, however, such an\r\none was taken seriously, and then the result was a book by some clever\r\nwoman to prove that there was no difference in the intellectual power of\r\nthe two sexes--that, if there was a difference, it was in favor of the\r\ngentler sex. There is quite a large number of such works in Italian; and\r\nit must be said that the women always met the arguments of their\r\nadversaries in a manner that does them the greatest credit.\r\n\r\nIt was probably because of their insistence on the equality of the\r\nsexes, as well as because of their achievements in every department of\r\nmental activity, that the educated women of Italy enjoyed so many\r\nprivileges denied their sisters in other parts of Europe. Thus, in\r\naddition to being treated as the equals of men in the universities, they\r\nmet them on an equal footing in the art, literary and scientific\r\nsocieties and academies, in the proceedings of which they always\r\nexhibited an active and enthusiastic interest. In these reunions the\r\nwomen gained strength of mind and independence of character from the\r\nmen, while the men imbibed refinement and gentleness from the women.\r\nCompare this condition with the systematic exclusion of women from\r\nsimilar societies in other countries--even in this twentieth century of\r\nours--and one of the not least potent reasons for the intellectual\r\nsupremacy of the women of Italy will be apparent.\r\n\r\nNext after Italy, France was the country in which, during the\r\npost-Renaissance period, women enjoyed the greatest advantages of mental\r\ndevelopment. But we look in vain, even during the age of Louis XIV, for\r\nthat flowering of the female intellect that, at the same period,\r\nrendered the daughters of Italy so famous. It is true that there was a\r\ncertain number of learned women in France during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and notably during the golden age of Louis XIV, for during this\r\nperiod the traditions of the Renaissance were perpetuated and there was\r\nstill a lingering love of letters, at least among certain classes of the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nProminent among those who attracted attention for their learning were\r\nGilberte and Jaqueline Pascal, of the celebrated convent of Port Royal;\r\nMarie-Eleanore de Rohan and Gabrielle de Rochechouart, both, like the\r\nPascal sisters, inmates of the cloister; Marie Cramoisy, wife of the\r\nfirst director of the royal printing office, and Mlle. de Luynes, a\r\nfriend of Pascal. All these counted among their attainments a writing\r\nknowledge of Latin, but were far from being able, like the Italian women\r\nabove mentioned, to speak it with the same fluency as they did their\r\nmother tongue.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the learned French women just named, there was Elisabeth\r\nde Rochechouart, a niece of Mme. de Montespan, who was able to read\r\nPlato in Greek, and Anne de Rohan, Princess of Guemene, who surprised\r\nher countrymen by studying Hebrew. Then there were Mme. de Grignan,\r\nMarie Dupre, Louise Serment, Anne de La Vigne, who, like the Princess\r\nPalatine, Elisabeth, and Christine of Sweden, were ardent disciples of\r\nDescartes, and took the lead among the _femmes philosophes_ of their\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut for profound and varied scholarship Mme. Dacier, the daughter of the\r\nerudite Tanquil Le Fevre, was the most famous of all the women of her\r\ntime in France. Possessed of rare power of eloquence and beauty of\r\nstyle, together with an extraordinary capacity for criticism, there was\r\nnot a man in Europe who did not respect her judgment in matters of\r\nliterature and culture. But that for which she was specially celebrated\r\nwas her exceptional knowledge of Latin and Greek. She not only\r\ntranslated the Iliad and the Odyssey but also several other of the\r\nancient classics. None of her contemporaries had a more thorough mastery\r\nof the tongues of Homer and Virgil, nor did any of her countrymen\r\ncontribute more than she toward the advancement of the knowledge of the\r\nliterature of ancient Greece and Rome. So highly prized was her version\r\nof the Iliad that it was translated by Ozell into English. Her version\r\nof Plato's Phaedo was also translated into English and published by a\r\nNew York bookseller more than a century after her death. The scholarly\r\nMenagius, in his _Historia Mulierum Philosopharum_, did not hesitate to\r\npronounce her the most learned woman of all time--_Feminarum quot sunt,\r\nquot fuere doctissima_.[74]\r\n\r\nTo Mme. de Maintenon, the morganatic wife of the Great Monarch, is due\r\nthe Institut de Saint-Cyr, the first state school for girls founded in\r\nFrance. It was, however, solely for the daughters of the nobility. And,\r\nalthough it was from the first under the direction of the foundress, a\r\nwoman who was before all else a teacher as well as one of the most\r\nenlightened women of the most literary and philosophic age France ever\r\nknew--the age when the French language was perfected, the age of the\r\nAcademy, of Boileau, Moliere, Racine, Bossuet, Descartes--the studies\r\nprescribed in this institution, which was under the special patronage of\r\nthe king, were of the most elementary character. They comprised reading,\r\nwriting, arithmetic, grammar, music, drawing, dancing, and the elements\r\nof history, mythology and geography. As to history, Mme. de Maintenon\r\nwas satisfied if the pupils of Saint-Cyr knew enough not to confound the\r\nkings of France with those of other nations, and were able to avoid\r\nmistaking a Roman emperor for the Emperor of China or Japan; or the King\r\nof Spain or England for the King of Persia or Siam. And yet, restricted\r\nas it was, her programme of studies was more complete than that of any\r\nother girls' school in the kingdom. One of her reasons for not insisting\r\non a more thorough course was that \"women never know but by halves, and\r\nthe little that they do know usually makes them proud, haughty and\r\ntalkative and disgusted with solid things.\"[75]\r\n\r\nIn Saint-Cyr, the best girls' school in the kingdom, there was not a\r\nword about the first principles of philosophy, nor about the physical\r\nand natural sciences recommended by Fenelon. The elements just referred\r\nto, combined with a goodly amount of esprit--_bien de l'esprit_--were\r\nconsidered quite sufficient to prepare the future wives of the nobility\r\nfor all the duties they would be called upon to perform.\r\n\r\nMme. de Maintenon had probably been unconsciously influenced by what she\r\nhad seen at the court of her liege lord, where the greater part of the\r\nwomen were extremely ignorant. Even Mme. de Montespan, the king's\r\nfavorite, and for years the leading figure at the court, was no\r\nexception. So ignorant was she that she was not even able to spell the\r\nsimplest and most common words.[76]\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with the most illustrious ladies of France. Many of them\r\nwere so devoid of instruction that they were unable either to read or to\r\nwrite. Even the teachers in Saint-Cyr were so deficient in the simplest\r\nrudiments of an education that Mme. de Maintenon found it necessary to\r\ncorrect their letters, in order to teach them the most essential rules\r\nof epistolary correspondence. In reality, the women of the age of Louis\r\nXIV did not trouble themselves about an education as we understand it.\r\nEndowed with esprit, with a natural and acquired taste for things\r\nintellectual, they were satisfied with such knowledge as they could\r\nglean from reading or conversation, and with comparatively few\r\nexceptions, showed no disposition to devote long years to study in\r\nschool, much less in a university, as did their sisters to the south of\r\nthe Alps.\r\n\r\nThe foundress of Saint-Cyr had likewise been influenced by her\r\nenvironment as well as by the court--an environment which was becoming\r\ndaily more and more unfavorable to the education, especially anything\r\napproaching the higher education, of women. A young woman's education\r\nwas considered complete when she was able to read, write, dance and play\r\nsome musical instrument. Anything more was deemed superfluous and\r\ndeserving of censure and ridicule rather than praise.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Moliere's two celebrated plays, _Les Femmes\r\nSavantes_ and _Les Precieuses Ridicules_, were given to the world. These\r\nwell-known productions, replete with the author's brightest flashes of\r\nwit, and abounding in his most effective shafts of satire, produced at\r\nonce an immense sensation. As soon as published, they were in the hands\r\nof everybody. Those who were opposed to the education of women--and the\r\nnumber was daily increasing--had recourse to them as to arsenals which\r\nsupplied them with just the arms they had so long needed to decide in\r\ntheir favor the long warfare which they had been conducting against the\r\ngentler sex. The views of the bourgeois Chrysale as expressed to his\r\nsister, Belise, were so in harmony with their own that they loved on\r\nevery occasion to repeat with him:\r\n\r\n                                    \"No,\r\n    It isn't decent, and for many reasons,\r\n    That womankind should study and know too much.\r\n    To teach her children what is right and wrong,\r\n    Manage her household, oversee her servants,\r\n    And keep expenses within bounds, should be\r\n    Her only study and philosophy.\r\n    Our fathers, on this point, showed great good sense;\r\n    They said a woman always knows enough\r\n    If but her understanding reaches\r\n    To telling, one from t'other, coat and breeches.\r\n    Their wives, who couldn't read, led honest lives,\r\n    Their households were their only learned theme,\r\n    And all their books were thimble, thread and needles.\r\n    With which they made their daughters' wedding outfits.\r\n    But now our women scorn to live like that;\r\n    They want to write and all be authoresses.\r\n    They think no knowledge is too deep for them.\"[77]\r\n\r\nMoliere's intention in writing these justly famous comedies was not, as\r\nis so often asserted, to ridicule women of learning, but only those\r\nsuperficial pedants who affected knowledge or loved to make a display of\r\nthe little knowledge they happened to possess. The result, however, was\r\nquite different from what had been intended, for the poet's pleasantries\r\nwere taken so seriously, that even women of real learning, in order to\r\navoid ridicule, were condemned to absolute silence. The comic dramatist,\r\nDestouches, expressed the prevailing opinion when he wrote:\r\n\r\n                              \"Une femme savante\r\n    Doit cacher son savoir, ou c'est une imprudente.\"[78]\r\n\r\nFew French women thereafter had the courage to defend their sex, as did\r\ntheir sisters in Italy, and the result was that, with a few exceptions,\r\nlike Mme. du Chatelet, Sophie Germain, and Mme. Lepaute, there were no\r\nmore learned women in France for fully two centuries.\r\n\r\nNever did satire and ridicule accomplish more, except probably in the\r\ncase of _Don Quixote_--that masterly creation of Cervantes which dealt\r\nthe death-blow to knight-errantry--than did _Les Femmes Savantes_ and\r\n_Les Precieuses Ridicules_. The learned woman became as much an object\r\nof derision in France as was the knight-errant in Spain.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, in the nature of the French woman, with all her\r\nvivacity and energy, to be suppressed entirely or to be relegated for\r\nlong to the background in things of the mind. But, not then daring to\r\nface the ridicule which was inevitable, if she devoted herself to\r\nscience or philosophy, she sought a substitute for her intellectual\r\nactivity in the salon.\r\n\r\nThe first salon was established by an Italian woman, the Marquise de\r\nRambouillet, in 1617, and was modeled after the famous reunions held at\r\nthe court of Urbino under Elizabetta Gonzaga, a century before. Although\r\nit never exhibited the splendor of its Italian prototype, the Hotel de\r\nRambouillet was for more than fifty years the most important literary\r\ncenter of the kind in France. Here, owing to the tact, esprit, and\r\nmagnetic personality of Mme. de Rambouillet, were gathered the most\r\ndistinguished men and women of the time. Among them were poets,\r\nphilosophers, statesmen, ecclesiastics and ladies of rank, whose names\r\nstill dazzle us by their brilliancy. Bossuet, Moliere, La Fontaine,\r\nCorneille and the great Conde were there; so were Flechier, Balzac,\r\nVoiture, Saint-Evremont, Descartes and La Rochefoucauld; and so, too,\r\nwere Mme. de Sevigne, the Duchess of Montpensier, Madeleine de Scudery,\r\nLa Comtesse de La Fayette, Charlotte de Montmorency, and Cardinal\r\nRichelieu who got from this noted salon the idea which led to his\r\ngreatest foundation--the French Academy.\r\n\r\nIt was Mme. de Rambouillet who, through her reunions in her exquisite\r\n_Chambre Bleue_, for the first time brought together elements that were\r\npreviously considered as belonging to different castes. It was she,\r\nalso, who created modern society with its purely intellectual hierarchy,\r\nby having the representatives of the nobility meet men of science and\r\nletters on an equal footing. It seems to us now the most natural thing\r\nin the world for a great savant, a great poet, or a great philosopher,\r\nto be received in the same salon with the Duchess of Montpensier--_La\r\nGrande Mademoiselle_--but it was far from being so when the brilliant\r\nyoung Italian matron--for she was a daughter of the noble Roman family\r\nof the Savelli--began her epoch-making work in the Hotel de Rambouillet,\r\nwhere, after overcoming countless difficulties and prejudices, she\r\neventually succeeded in bringing together, and in enlisting in a common\r\ncause, the nobility of birth and the nobility of intellect, and\r\nintroducing into the exclusive set of Paris the same kind of social\r\ncoteries that had so long been popular in Urbino and Ferrara.\r\n\r\nThe Hotel de Rambouillet was the exemplar of that long series of salons\r\nwhich, for two centuries, were the favorite trysting-places of the\r\ntalent, the wit, the beauty of Europe, and which exerted such a potent\r\ninfluence on society and on the progress of science and literature. The\r\nmistress of the salon was supreme, and she maintained her supremacy by\r\nher tact, sympathy, intelligence and mental alertness, rather than by\r\nlearning and superior mental power.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is a singular fact that very few of the _salonieres_ were\r\nlearned women. The most gifted and the most learned of them were Mlle.\r\nLespinasse, Mme. de Stael, and Mme. Swetchine. Mme. Geoffrin, who was of\r\nbourgeois origin, was so devoid of education that Voltaire said she was\r\nunable to write two lines correctly. And yet, despite her educational\r\nlimitations, she became, by her own unaided efforts, the queen of\r\nintellectual Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd, if we may judge by their portraits, most of the great leaders of\r\nsalons were homely, if not positively ugly, and many of them were\r\nadvanced in years. Thus, Mme. du Deffand--the female Voltaire--was\r\nsixty-eight years old and blind when her friendship with Horace Walpole,\r\none of the wittiest Englishmen who ever lived, began--a friendship that\r\nendured until her death at the age of eighty-three. The face of Mlle. de\r\nLespinasse was disfigured by small-pox and her eyesight was impaired;\r\nand yet, without rank, wealth or beauty, she was the pivot around which\r\ncircled the talent and fashion of Paris, and whose personal magnetism\r\nwas so great that the state, the church, the court, as well as foreign\r\ncountries, had their most distinguished representatives in her salon.\r\n\r\nHere she received and entertained her friends every evening from five\r\nuntil nine o'clock. \"It was,\" writes La Harpe, \"almost a title to\r\nconsideration to be received into this society.\" So great was the\r\ninfluence exerted by Mlle. de Lespinasse that she bent savants to her\r\nwill by the sheer force of genius. Her salon became known as \"the\r\nante-chamber of the French Academy\"; for it was asserted that half the\r\nacademicians of her time owed their fauteuils to her active canvass in\r\ntheir behalf. And so successful was she in opening the lips and minds of\r\nher habitues, whether an historian like Hume, a philosopher like\r\nCondillac, a statesman like Turgot, a mathematician like d'Alembert, a\r\nlitterateur like Marmontel or an encyclopedist like Condorcet, that it\r\nwas said of her that she made \"marble feel and matter think.\"\r\n\r\nShe was a veritable enchantress of the great and the learned of her\r\ntime. She did not, however, wield her magic wand through her learning,\r\nor the accident of birth, or the physical attractions of person, but\r\nsolely by reason of her wonderful vivacity, charm of mind, and exquisite\r\ntact, which consisted, as those who knew her well tell us, \"in the art\r\nof saying to each that which suits him,\" and in \"making the best of the\r\nminds of others, of interesting them, and of bringing them into play\r\nwithout any appearance of constraint or effort.\" This rare faculty it\r\nwas which secured for her a supremacy in the world of thought and action\r\nthat has been accorded to but few women in the world's history. Vibrant\r\nwith emotion and passion, she reminds one of the gifted but hapless\r\nHeloise. Marmontel, who had such a high opinion of her judgment that he\r\nsubmitted his works for her criticism, as Moliere had submitted his to\r\nNinon de Lenclos, describes her as \"the keenest intelligence, the most\r\nardent soul, the most inflammable imagination that has existed since\r\nSappho.\"\r\n\r\nBut aside from what she achieved indirectly through the habitues of her\r\nsalon, what has this supremely clever woman left to the world? Only a\r\nfew love letters to a heartless coxcomb.\r\n\r\nAnd what have the other noted salonieres from the time of the Marquise\r\nde Rambouillet to that of Mme. Swetchine--full two centuries--bequeathed\r\nto us that is worth preserving? With the exception of the works of Mme.\r\nde Stael, whom Lord Jeffrey declared to be \"the greatest female writer\r\nin any age or country,\" we have little more than certain _Memoires_ and\r\n_Correspondances_ whose chief claims to fame rest on the vivid pictures\r\nwhich they present of the manners and customs of the time and of the\r\ncelebrities who were regarded as the chief ornaments of the salons which\r\nthey severally frequented. Most of these works were posthumous; for few\r\nwomen, after Moliere's merciless scoring of learned women, had the\r\ncourage to appear in print. Even Mme. de Scudery, one of the most gifted\r\nand prolific writers of the period, gave her first novel to the world\r\nunder her brother's name. And so tabooed was female authorship that Mme.\r\nde La Fayette, one of the most brilliant of the _precieuses_, disclaimed\r\nall knowledge of her _Princesse de Cleves_, while her masterpiece,\r\n_Histoire d'Henriette d'Angleterre_, was not published until after her\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the period of the salon was for the most part a period\r\nof contrasts and contradictions. At first the better educated\r\n_salonieres_ were chiefly interested in belles-lettres. Then they\r\ndevoted themselves more to science and philosophy, and finally, during\r\nthe years immediately preceding the Revolution, they found their\r\ngreatest pleasure in politics. As for the men, while professing to adore\r\nwomen, they had little esteem for them, and still less respect. Often,\r\nit is true, the women who frequented the salons were deserving neither\r\nof respect nor of esteem.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith spoke of those under the old regime as \"women of brilliant\r\ntalents who violated all the common duties of life and gave very\r\npleasant little suppers.\" It was certainly true of many of them--even of\r\nsome of the most distinguished--such, for instance, as Mme. d'Epinay,\r\nMme. du Deffand, Ninon de Lenclos and Mme. Tencin, the mother of\r\nD'Alembert. There was little in their manner of life to distinguish them\r\nfrom the _hetaerae_ of ancient Athens, and it was probably owing to this\r\nfact, as well as their wit and brilliancy, that many of them attained\r\nsuch preeminence as social leaders. The statesmen, philosophers, men of\r\nscience and letters of France, like those of Greece more than two\r\nthousand years before, wanted distraction and amusement. That the\r\nmistresses of the salons should be women of learning was of little\r\nmoment. The all important thing for their habitues was that they should\r\nbe good entertainers--that they should be witty, tactful and\r\nsympathetic--and, if ignorant, that they should be brilliantly ignorant,\r\nand, at the same time, enchantingly frank and naive.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear there was as much hostility to learned women at\r\nthe close of the eighteenth century as there was in the time of Louis\r\nXIV. And the remarkable fact is that the strongest opponents of women's\r\neducation were found among the most prominent writers and scholars of\r\nthe day--men who, like their predecessors of old, based their opposition\r\non the assumed mental inferiority of woman. Thus, to Rousseau, woman was\r\nat best but \"an imperfect man,\" and, in many respects, little more than\r\n\"a grown-up child.\" Search after abstract and speculative truths,\r\nprinciples and axioms in science, \"everything that tends to generalize\r\nideas is outside of her competence.\" That means that women are to be\r\nexcluded from the study of mathematics and the physical sciences,\r\nbecause they are incapable of generalization, abstraction, and the\r\nmental concentration that these subjects demand. Even the masterpieces\r\nof literature, according to him, are beyond their comprehension. In a\r\nword, feminine studies, Rousseau will have it, should relate exclusively\r\nto practical and domestic matters and he endorses the words of Moliere\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    \"It is not seemly, and for many reasons,\r\n    That a woman should study and know so many things.\"\r\n\r\nDiderot, Montesquieu, Voltaire and the Encyclopedists share the views of\r\nRousseau. Diderot declares that serious studies do not comport with\r\nwoman's sex, while Montesquieu would limit female education to mere\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Antagonistic as these men were to the education of\r\nthe daughters of the nobility and the well-to-do, they were entirely\r\nopposed to the education of the children of the poor. \"The good of\r\nsociety,\" it was averred, \"demands that the instruction of the people\r\nextend not beyond their occupations.\" \"The poor,\" declares Rousseau,\r\n\"have no need of instruction,\" and Voltaire and the Encyclopedists say,\r\n\"Amen.\"[79]\r\n\r\nVery little need be said about the education of women in Germany during\r\nthe period we have been considering. When there was any at all, it was\r\nof the most rudimentary character, while as to books, they were limited\r\nto the kind recommended by Byron for the women of modern Greece--\"books\r\nof piety and cookery.\" The attitude of the Germans generally toward\r\nfemale education, for centuries past, was clearly defined by the Kaiser\r\nWilhelm II, when, a few years ago, he publicly stated: \"I agree with my\r\nwife. She says women have no business to interfere with anything\r\noutside of the four K's, that is, _Kinder_, _Kirche_, _Kueche_,\r\n_Kleider_--children, church, kitchen, clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThere was, however, during the period we are now considering, one\r\nremarkable example of a learned woman of Teutonic origin. This was the\r\nfamous Anna Maria van Schurman, who was one of the most gifted women\r\nthat ever lived. She was, probably, as near to being a universal genius\r\nas any one of her sex of whom we have knowledge. Artist, musician, poet,\r\nphilosopher, theologian, linguist, she was the admiration of the\r\nscholars of the world and the pride of the Low Countries--the land of\r\nher birth. She lived when Holland was in the van of human progress and\r\namidst of the splendors of the Dutch Renaissance. She was the friend and\r\ncorrespondent of the most distinguished scholars and most noted\r\ncelebrities of her time. Among these were Voet, Spanheim, Descartes,\r\nGassendi, Constantine Huyghens, Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, Queen\r\nChristina of Sweden, and Cardinal Richelieu. To go to the Netherlands,\r\nit was then said, without seeing Anna van Schurman, was like going to\r\nParis without seeing the king. She was hailed as \"The Tenth Muse,\" \"The\r\nSappho of Holland,\" \"The Oracle of Art,\" \"The Star of Utrecht.\"\r\n\r\nThat, however, which gave the greatest renown to the \"Learned Maid,\" as\r\nAnna was called, was her extraordinary knowledge of languages. For,\r\nbesides being proficient in the chief modern tongues of Europe, she was\r\nwell acquainted with Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Syro-Chaldaic and Ethiopic.\r\nThe oriental languages she studied as an aid to the better understanding\r\nof Holy Scripture.\r\n\r\nShe was the author of several works, among which was an Ethiopic grammar\r\nwhich was acclaimed by the professors of the Dutch universities as a\r\nmarvelous achievement. Her best known volume is designated _Opuscula_.\r\nIt was brought out by the Elzevirs in Leyden and went through several\r\neditions. It is composed of letters and short treatises in French,\r\nLatin, Greek and Hebrew--in verse as well as prose.\r\n\r\nOf more value, if less striking, than the productions named were the\r\n\"Learned Maid's\" writings in favor of the intellectual enfranchisement\r\nof her own sex. In a letter to Dr. Rivet, Professor of Theology in\r\nLeyden, she declares:\r\n\r\n\"My deep regard for learning, my conviction that equal justice is the\r\nright of all, impel me to protest against the theory which would allow\r\nonly a minority of my sex to attain to what is in the opinion of all men\r\nmost worth having. For, since wisdom is admitted to be the crown of\r\nhuman achievement, and is within every man's right to aim at in\r\nproportion to his opportunities, I cannot see why a young girl, in whom\r\nwe admit a desire of self-improvement, should not be encouraged to\r\nacquire the best that life affords.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who objected that the distaff and the needle were sufficient to\r\noccupy women's minds, Anna Maria made answer that the words of\r\nPlutarch--\"It becomes a perfect man to know what is to be known and to\r\ndo what is to be done\"--applied with equal truth to a perfect woman.[80]\r\n\r\nIn England, until the latter part of the nineteenth century, the\r\neducational status of women was but little better than in Germany.\r\nDuring the Stuart period schools for girls were so scarce that most of\r\nthose who received any education at all obtained it at home under\r\nprivate tutors. Even then it rarely embraced more than reading, writing,\r\nneedlework, singing, dancing and playing on the lute or virginal.[81]\r\n\r\nAs to the higher studies for women, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu writes as\r\nfollows: \"My sex is usually forbid studies of this nature and folly\r\nreckoned so much our proper sphere that we are sooner pardoned any\r\nexcesses of that than the least pretensions to reading or good sense. We\r\nare permitted no books but such as tend to the weakening or effeminating\r\nof the mind. Our natural defects are in every way indulged, and it is\r\nlooked upon as in a degree criminal to improve our reason or fancy we\r\nhave any.... There is hardly a creature in the world more despicable or\r\nmore liable to universal ridicule than that of a learned woman: these\r\nwords imply, according to the received sense, a tattling, impertinent,\r\nvain and conceited creature.\"[82]\r\n\r\nHigher studies for their daughters were regarded by the generality of\r\nmen, the same writer tells us, \"as great a profanation as the clergy\r\nwould do if the laity would presume to exercise the functions of the\r\npriesthood.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the handicaps suffered by the women of England in the\r\npursuit of knowledge, the same writer declares: \"We are educated in the\r\ngrossest ignorance, and no art is omitted to stifle our natural reason;\r\nif some few get above their nurses' instructions, our knowledge must be\r\nconcealed and be as useless to the world as gold in the mine.\"\r\n\r\nLord Chesterfield, in _His Letters to His Son_, expresses the opinion of\r\nhis contemporaries when he writes on the same subject as follows: \"Women\r\nare only children of a larger growth; they have an entertaining tattle,\r\nsometimes wit; but, for solid reasoning, good sense, I never in my life\r\nknew one who had it, or who reasoned or acted consequentially for\r\ntwenty-four hours together.... A man of sense only trifles with them,\r\nplays with them, humors and flatters them as he does a sprightly forward\r\nchild; but he neither consults them about nor trusts them with serious\r\nmatters, though he often makes them believe he does both, which is the\r\nthing in the world which they are proud of; for they love mightily to be\r\ndabbling in business, which, by the way, they always spoil, and, being\r\ndistrustful that men in general look upon them in a trifling light, they\r\nalmost adore that man who talks to them seriously and seems to consult\r\nand trust them.\"[83]\r\n\r\nAnd this was written by that \"mirror of politeness and chivalry\" whose\r\nname has for two centuries been synonymous with that of a perfect\r\ngentleman! And Lady Montagu was compelled to pen her caustic and\r\npathetic plaints during the age of Pope, Steele, Addison, Swift,[84]\r\nJohnson, Dryden and Goldsmith--the most brilliant pleiad of literary men\r\nthat England had known since the days of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nSo unnatural for women were literary and scientific pursuits regarded by\r\nall classes that the few who attained any eminence in them were classed\r\nas abnormal creatures who deserved no more consideration than did the\r\n_Precieuses_ across the Channel. And so great was the power of public\r\nsentiment against women writers that Fanny Burney was afraid to\r\nacknowledge the authorship of _Evelina_. Even in Jane Austen's days, the\r\nfeeling that a woman, in writing a book, was overstepping the\r\nlimitations of her sex was so pronounced that she never actually avowed\r\nthe authorship of those charming works which have been the delight of\r\nthree generations of readers. It was this same sentiment that caused the\r\nBronte sisters and George Eliot, as well as many other notable women, to\r\nwrite under pseudonyms. They feared to disclose their sex lest their\r\nworks, if known as the productions of women, should be _ipso facto_\r\nbranded as of inferior merit.\r\n\r\nDuring the period in question women fared no better in the United States\r\nthan in England. They were subject to the same educational debarment and\r\nwere the victims of the same snobbery and intolerance. The Pilgrim\r\nFathers and their descendants for many generations made no secret of\r\ntheir belief in the mental inferiority of woman, and applied to her the\r\ngospel of liberty contained in the following words of Eve to Adam as\r\ngiven in _Paradise Lost_:\r\n\r\n    \"My author and dispenser, what thou bidst\r\n    Unargued I obey; so God ordains;\r\n    God is thy law, thou mine: to know no more\r\n    Is woman's happiest knowledge and her praise.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Puritan of New England, as to the Puritan Milton, the relative\r\nattainments of woman and man were tersely expressed in Tennyson's\r\ncouplet:\r\n\r\n    \"She knows but matters of the house,\r\n    And he, he knows a thousand things.\"\r\n\r\nTo us one of the most astounding facts in the educational history of New\r\nEngland is the long time during which girls were without free school\r\nopportunities. Thus, although schools had been established within twenty\r\nyears after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, it was not until a\r\ncentury and a half later that their doors were opened to girls. The\r\npublic schools of Boston were established in 1642, but were not opened\r\nfor girls until 1789; and then only for instruction in spelling, reading\r\nand composition, and that but one half of the year. There was no high\r\nschool in Boston, the vaunted Athens of America, until 1852.\r\n\r\nHarvard College was founded in 1636 for the education of \"ye English and\r\nIndian youth of this country in knowledge and godlyness,\" but in this\r\ninstitution no provision was made for women and its doors are still\r\nclosed to them.\r\n\r\n\"The prevailing notion of the purpose of education,\" declares Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, in speaking of Harvard College, \"was attended with one\r\nremarkable consequence--the cultivation of the female mind was regarded\r\nwith utter indifference; as Mrs. Abigail Adams says in one of her\r\nletters, 'it was fashionable to ridicule learning.'\"[85]\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1865 that Matthew Vassar, \"recognizing in women the\r\nsame intellectual constitution as in man,\" founded the first woman's\r\ncollege in the United States. This was soon followed by similar\r\ninstitutions in various parts of this country and Europe. In less than\r\nten years thereafter Girton and Newnham colleges were founded at\r\nCambridge, England, in order that women might be enabled to enter upon a\r\nregular university career.\r\n\r\nIn all the universities of England, Scotland and Ireland, except Oxford,\r\nCambridge[86] and Trinity College, Dublin, women are now admitted to\r\nall departments, pass the same examinations as the men and receive the\r\nsame academic degrees. Germany, whose institutions for the higher\r\neducation of men have so long been justly famous, was exceedingly slow\r\nto open its universities to women, and then only after the most stubborn\r\nopposition of those who still maintained that the studies of women\r\nshould be limited to the three R's and their occupations confined to the\r\nfour K's. But even in this conservative country the cause of woman has\r\nat length triumphed, and she now enjoys educational advantages that a\r\nfew decades ago were deemed forever impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so it is in every civilized country. Woman's long struggle for\r\ncomplete intellectual freedom is almost ended, and certain victory is\r\nalready in sight. In spite of the sarcasm and ridicule of satirists and\r\ncomic poets, in spite of the antipathy of philosophers and the\r\nantagonism of legislators who persisted in treating women as inferior\r\nbeings, they are finally in view of the goal toward which they have\r\nthrough so many long ages been bending their best efforts. Moreover, so\r\neffective and so concentrated has been their work during recent years\r\nthat they have accomplished more toward securing complete intellectual\r\nenfranchisement than during the previous thirty centuries.\r\n\r\nFrom the former home of the Vikings to the romantic land of the Cid,\r\nfrom the capital of Holy Russia to the fair metropolis of the Golden\r\nGate, women are now welcomed to the very institutions from which but a\r\nfew years ago they were so systematically excluded. They attend the same\r\ncourses as men, pass the same examinations and receive the same degrees\r\nand honors. Their sex is no longer a bar to positions and employment\r\nthat only a generation ago were considered proper only for the proud\r\nand imperious male. They have proved beyond cavil that genius knows not\r\nsex, and that, given a fair opportunity, they are competent to achieve\r\nsuccess in every department of human effort.\r\n\r\nThus, to speak only of Europe, there are to-day women professors in the\r\nuniversities of Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Greece and Russia,\r\nas there have been in Italy since the closing years of the Dark Ages.\r\nThey lecture on science, literature, law and medicine, and in a manner\r\nto extort the admiration of their erstwhile antagonists. In Germany and\r\nHungary there are women chemists and architects, while it is a matter of\r\nrecord that the best construction work done on the trans-Siberian\r\nrailroad was that in charge of a woman engineer.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the marvelous change which has been brought about\r\nduring the last three-quarters of a century in the educational status of\r\nwoman, I can do no better than transcribe a few passages from a work by\r\nSir Walter Besant describing the transformation of woman during the\r\nreign of Queen Victoria; for it applies to all civilized countries as\r\nwell as to England.\r\n\r\n\"The young lady of 1837 has been to a fashionable school; she has\r\nlearned accomplishments, deportment and dress. She is full of sentiment;\r\nthere was an amazing amount of sentiment in the air about that time; she\r\nloves to talk and read about gallant knights, crusaders and troubadors;\r\nshe gently touches the guitar; her sentiment, or her little affectation,\r\nhas touched her with a graceful melancholy, a becoming stoop, a sweet\r\npensiveness. She loves the aristocracy, even although her home is in\r\nthat part of London called Bloomsbury, whither the belted earl cometh\r\nnot, even though her papa goes into the City; she reads a deal of\r\npoetry, especially those poems which deal with the affections, of which\r\nthere are many at this time. On Sunday she goes to church religiously\r\nand pensively, followed by a footman carrying her prayerbook and a long\r\nstick; she can play on the guitar and the piano a few easy pieces which\r\nshe has learned. She knows a few words of French, which she produces at\r\nfrequent intervals; as to history, geography, science, the condition of\r\nthe people, her mind is an entire blank; she knows nothing of these\r\nthings. Her conversation is commonplace, as her ideas are limited; she\r\ncan not reason on any subject whatever because of her ignorance; or, as\r\nshe herself would say, because she is a woman. In her presence, and\r\nindeed in the presence of ladies generally, men talk trivialities. There\r\nwas indeed a general belief that women were creatures incapable of\r\nargument, or of reason, or of connected thought. It was no use arguing\r\nabout the matter. The Lord had made them so. Women, said the\r\nphilosophers, can not understand logic; they see things, if they do see\r\nthem at all, by instinctive perception. This theory accounted for\r\neverything, for those cases when women undoubtedly did 'see things.'\r\nAlso it fully justified people in withholding from women any kind of\r\neducation worthy the name. A quite needless expense, you understand.\"\r\n\r\nHer amusements, we are told, were \"those of an amateur--a few pieces on\r\nthe guitar and the piano and some slight power of sketching or flower\r\npainting in water-colors.\" The literature she read \"endeavored to mold\r\nwoman on the theory of recognized intellectual inferiority to man. She\r\nwas considered beneath him in intellect as in physical strength; she was\r\nexhorted to defer to man; to acknowledge his superiority; not to show\r\nherself anxious to combat his opinions....\r\n\r\n\"This system of artificial restraints certainly produced faithful wives,\r\ngentle mothers, loving sisters, able housewives. God forbid that we\r\nshould say otherwise, but it is certain that the intellectual\r\nattainments of women were then what we should call contemptible, and the\r\nrange of subjects of which they knew nothing was absurdly narrow and\r\nlimited. I detect the woman of 1840 in the character of Mrs. Clive\r\nNewcome, and, indeed, in Mrs. George Osborne, and in other familiar\r\ncharacters of Thackeray.\"\r\n\r\nThen Sir Walter, turning to the young Englishwoman of 1897, thus\r\ndescribes her:\r\n\r\n\"She is educated. Whatsoever things are taught to the young man are\r\ntaught to the young woman; the keys of knowledge are given to her; she\r\ngathers of the famous tree; if she wants to explore the wickedness of\r\nthe world she can do so, for it is all in the books. The secrets of\r\nnature are not closed to her; she can learn the structure of the body if\r\nshe wishes. The secrets of science are all open to her if she cares to\r\nstudy them.\r\n\r\n\"At school, at college, she studies just as the young man studies, but\r\nharder and with greater concentration. She has proved her ability in the\r\nHonors Tripos of every branch; she has beaten the senior wrangler in\r\nmathematics; she has taken a 'first-class' in classics, in history, in\r\nscience, in languages. She has proved, not that she is a man's equal in\r\nintellect, though she claims so much, because she has not yet advanced\r\nany branch of learning, of science, one single step, but she has proved\r\nher capacity to take her place beside the young men who are the flower\r\nof their generation--the young men who stand in the first class of\r\nhonors when they take their degree....\r\n\r\n\"Personal independence--that is the keynote of the situation. Mothers no\r\nlonger attempt the old control over their daughters; they would find it\r\nimpossible. The girls go off by themselves on their bicycles; they go\r\nabout as they please; they neither compromise themselves nor get talked\r\nabout; for the first time in man's history it is regarded as a right and\r\nproper thing to trust a girl as a boy insists upon being trusted. Out of\r\nthis personal freedom will come, I dare say, a change in the old\r\nfeelings of young man to maiden. He will not see in her a frail, tender\r\nplant which must be protected from cold winds; she can protect herself\r\nperfectly well. He will not see in her any longer a creature of sweet\r\nemotions and pure aspirations, coupled with a complete ignorance of the\r\nworld, because she already knows all that she wants to know....\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the greatest change is that woman now does thoroughly what\r\nbefore she only did as an amateur.\"[87]\r\n\r\nYes, the world is beginning at last to realize the truth of the\r\nproposition which the learned Maria Gaetana Agnesi so eloquently\r\ndefended nearly two centuries ago--to wit, that nature has endowed the\r\nfemale mind with a capacity for all knowledge, and that, in depriving\r\nwomen of an opportunity of acquiring knowledge, men work against the\r\nbest interests of the public weal.[88]\r\n\r\nWe are at the long last near that millennium which Emerson had in mind\r\nwhen, in 1822, he predicted \"a time when higher institutions for the\r\neducation of young women would be as needful as colleges for young\r\nmen\"--that millennium for which women have hoped and striven ever since\r\nSappho sang and Aspasia inspired the brightest, the noblest minds of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Demosthenes _In Neaeram_, 122. [Greek: Tas men gar hetairas hedones\r\nhenek' echomen, tas de pallakas tes kath' hemeran therapeias tou\r\nsomatos, tas de gynaikas tou paidopoieisthai gnesios kai ton endon\r\nzylaka pisten echein].\r\n\r\nAs indicative of the comparative value of men and women, as members of\r\nsociety, in the estimation of the Greeks, Euripides makes Iphigenia give\r\nutterance to the following sentiment:\r\n\r\n    \"More than a thousand women is one man\r\n    Worthy to see the light of life.\"\r\n\r\n[2] [Greek: Tes te gar, hyparchouses zuseos me cheirosi genesthai hymin\r\nmegale e doxa' kai hes an ep' elachiston aretes peri e psogou en arsesi\r\nkleos e.] Thucidides, _History of the Peloponnesian War, II_, 45.\r\n\r\n\"Phidias,\" Plutarch tells us in his _Conjugal Precepts_, \"made the\r\nstatue of Venus at Elis with one foot on the shell of a tortoise, to\r\nsignify two great duties of a virtuous woman, which are to keep at home\r\nand be silent. For she is only to speak to her husband or by her\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Ariosto, referring to the undying fame of Sappho and Corinna,\r\nexpresses himself in words as beautiful as they are true, as witness the\r\nfollowing couplet:\r\n\r\n    Saffo e Corinna, perche furon dotte,\r\n    Splendono illustri, e mai non veggon notte.\r\n\r\n             --ORLANDO FURIOSO, Canto XX, strophe I.\r\n\r\n[4] The nine \"Terrestrial Muses\" were Sappho, Erinna, Myrus, Myrtis,\r\nCorinna, Telesilla, Praxilla, Nossis and Anyta.\r\n\r\nThe Greek poet Antipater embodies the names of the \"Terrestrial Nine\" in\r\nan epigram which is well rendered in the appended Latin translation:\r\n\r\n    Has divinis linguis Helicon nutrivit mulieres\r\n      Hymnis, et Macedon Pierias scopulus,\r\n    Prexillam, Myro, Anytae os, foeminam Homerum,\r\n      Lesbidum Sappho ornamentum capillatarum.\r\n    Erinnam, Telesillam nobilem, teque Corinna,\r\n      Strenuum Palladis scutum quae cecinit.\r\n    Nossidem muliebri lingua, et dulsisonam Myrtin,\r\n      Omnes immortalium operatrices librorum.\r\n    Novem quidem Musas magnum coelum, novem vero illas\r\n      Terra genuit hominibus, immortalem laetitiam.\r\n\r\n[5] Cf. _Poetriarum octo, Erinnae, Myrus, Mytidis, Corinnae, Telesillae,\r\nPraxillae, Nossidis, Anytae fragmenta et elogia_, by J.

One of them, apparently a\r\nnative of Corinth, was celebrated throughout Greece as the most\r\nbeautiful woman of her age.\r\n\r\n[9] For information respecting the hetaerae the reader is referred to the\r\n_Letters_ of Alciphron, to Lucian's _Dialogues_ on courtesans, and more\r\nparticularly to the _Deipnosophists_ of Athenaeus, Chap. XIII. See also\r\n_The Lives and Opinions of the Ancient Philosophers_, by Diogenes\r\nLaertius, Bohn Edition, London.\r\n\r\n[10] Donaldson, op. cit., pp. 61 and 62.\r\n\r\nAdolph Schmidt, one of the late biographers of Aspasia, accepts these\r\nstatements as true and credits to Aspasia the making of both Pericles\r\nand Socrates. His views are also shared by other modern writers who have\r\nmade a special study of the subject.\r\n\r\nAccording to some writers an indirect allusion to Aspasia's intellectual\r\nsuperiority is found in the _Medea_ of Euripedes in the following verses\r\nof the women's chorus:\r\n\r\n    \"In subtle questions I full many a time\r\n    Have heretofore engaged, and this great point\r\n    Debated, whether woman should extend\r\n    Her search into abstruse and hidden truths.\r\n    But we too have a Muse, who with our sex\r\n    Associates to expound the mystic lore\r\n    Of wisdom, though she dwell not with us all.\"\r\n\r\n[11] It is proper to add that certain modern writers will not admit that\r\nAspasia was ever an hetaera in the sense of being a courtesan. After\r\nPericles had divorced his first wife, he lived with Aspasia as his\r\nsecond wife, to whom he was devoted and faithful until death. According\r\nto Greek law, which forbade Athenian citizens to marry foreign women, he\r\ncould not be her legal husband; but, there can be no doubt that he\r\nalways treated her with all the respect and affection due to a wife. His\r\ndying words: \"Athens entrusted her greatness and Aspasia her happiness\r\nto me,\" clearly evince her nobility of character and the place she must\r\never have occupied in the great statesman's heart.\r\n\r\nThe most important notices in ancient writings, respecting Aspasia, are\r\nfound in Plutarch's _Pericles_, Xenophon's _Memorabilia_ of Socrates and\r\nPlato's _Menexenus_. Among the most valuable of modern works on the same\r\nsubject is _Aspasie de Milet_, by L. Becq de Fouquieres, Paris, 1872.\r\nCf. also _Aspasie et le Siecle de Pericles_, Paris, 1862; _Histoire des\r\nDeux Aspasies_, by Le Comte de Bievre, Paris, 1736, and A. Schmidt's\r\n_Sur l'Age de Pericles_, 1877-79.\r\n\r\n[12] Under the term music, Plato, like his contemporaries, included\r\nreading, writing, literature, mathematics, astronomy and harmony. It was\r\nopposed to gymnastic as mental to bodily training. Both music and\r\ngymnastic, however, were intended for the benefit of the soul.\r\n\r\n[13] _The Dialogues of Plato, Laws_, VII, 805, Jowett's translation, New\r\nYork, 1892.\r\n\r\n[14] Op. cit., _The Republic_, V, 451 et seq. and 466.\r\n\r\n[15] It was the boast of the Emperor Augustus that all his clothes were\r\nwoven by his wife, sister or daughter. Suetonius, in his _Lives of the\r\nTwelve Caesars_, informs us that this great master of the world _filiam\r\net neptes ita instituit ut etiam lanificio assuefaceret_.\r\n\r\n[16] This type of the old Roman schoolmaster is alluded to in the\r\nfollowing well known verses of Martial:\r\n\r\n    \"Quid tibi nobiscum est, ludi scelerate magister,\r\n      Invisum pueris virginibusque caput?\r\n    Nondum cristati rupere silentia Galli\r\n      Murmure jam saevo verberibusque tonas.\"\r\n\r\n                       --Lib. IX, 79.\r\n\r\nwhich have been rendered as follows:\r\n\r\n    Despiteful pedant, why dost me pursue,\r\n    Thou head detested by the younger crew?\r\n    Before the cock proclaims the day is near\r\n    Thy direful threats and lashes stun my ear.\r\n\r\nMartial elsewhere refers to \"Ferulaeque tristes, sceptra\r\npedagogorum\"--melancholy rods, sceptres of pedagogues--and it appears\r\nfrom one of Juvenal's satires that \"to withdraw the hand from the rod\"\r\nwas a phrase meaning \"to leave school.\"\r\n\r\n[17] _Woman Through the Ages_, Vol. I, pp. 110, 111, by Emil Reich,\r\nLondon, 1908.\r\n\r\nSchoolhouses among the Romans, as well as among the Greeks, were quite\r\ndifferent from our modern, well-equipped buildings. Usually, at least,\r\nin earlier times, instruction was given in the open air, in some quiet\r\nstreet corner or in _tabernae_--sheds or lean-tos--as in certain\r\nMohametan countries to-day. Horace refers to this in _Epistola_ XX, Lib.\r\nI, when he writes:\r\n\r\n    \"Ut pueros elementa docentem\r\n    Occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus.\"\r\n\r\nIn such schools the pupils sat on the floor or the bare ground, or, if\r\nthe lessons were given on the street, they sat on the stones. There were\r\nno desks, or, if there were any benches, they had no backs. The pupils\r\nwere, therefore, perforce obliged to write on their knees.\r\n\r\nCf. _Historical Survey of Pre-Christian Education_, pp. 278 and 346, by\r\nS. S. Laurie, London, 1900.\r\n\r\n[18] Cf. his _Tiberius Gracchus_.

A fame ne\r\ndoit-on apprendre lettre ni escrire, si ce n'est especiaument pour estre\r\nnonain, car par lire et escrire, de fame sont maint mal avenu.\"\r\n\r\n[42] _Opera Omnia S.

Schmelzeis, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1878.\r\n\r\n[43] It was Peter Lombard, whose _Sentences_ \"became the very canon of\r\northodoxy for all succeeding ages,\" who, in marked contrast with those\r\nof ancient and modern times that regarded woman as the inferior or slave\r\nof man, asserted her equality with him in a sentence that should be\r\nwritten in letters of gold. \"Woman,\" he declares, _Sententiarum_, Lib.\r\nII, Disp. 18, \"was not taken from the head of man, for she was not\r\nintended to be his ruler, nor from his foot, for she was not intended to\r\nbe his slave, but from his side, for she was intended to be his\r\ncompanion and comfort.\"\r\n\r\nIn this view the great Schoolman but follows the teachings of St.\r\nAugustine. For in his commentary, _De Genesi ad Litteram_, Lib. 9, Cap.\r\n13, the learned bishop of Hippo writes: \"Quia igitur viro nec domina nec\r\nancilla parabatur, sed socia, nec de capite, nec de pedibus, sed de\r\nlatere fuerat producenda, ut juxta se producendam cognosceret, quam de\r\nsuo latere sumptam didecisset.\" Again the same illustrious doctor\r\ndeclares that woman was formed from man's side in order that it might be\r\nmanifest that she was created to be united with him in love--in\r\nconsortium creabatur dilectionis.\r\n\r\n[44] Cf. _Hortus Deliciarum_, by Herrad de Lansberg, folio with one\r\nhundred and ten plates, Strasburg, 1901, and _Herrade de Landsberg_, by\r\nCharles Schmidt, Strasburg.\r\n\r\nThe erudite academician, Charles Jourdain, says of Herrad's great work\r\n\"L'encyclopedie qu'on lui doit, _l'Hortus Deliciarum_, embrasse toutes\r\nles parties des connaissances humaines, depuis la science divine jusqu'a\r\nl'agriculture et la metrologie, et on s'etonne a bon droit qu'un tel\r\nouvrage, qui supposait une erudition si variee et si methodique, soit\r\nsorti d'une plume feminine. Quelle impression produirait aujourd'hui\r\nl'annonce d'une encyclopedie qui aurait pour auteur une simple,\r\nreligieuse? Parlerons-nous des femmes du monde?

While Scripture and the writing of the\r\nFathers of the Church at all times formed the groundwork of monastic\r\nstudies, Cicero at this period was read by the side of Boethus, Virgil\r\nby the side of Martianus Capella, Terence by the side of Isidore of\r\nSeville. From remarks made by Hroswitha we see that the coarseness of\r\nthe Latin dramatists made no reason for their being forbidden to nuns,\r\nthough she would have seen it otherwise; and, Herrad was so far\r\nimpressed by the wisdom of the heathen philosophers of antiquity that\r\nshe pronounced this wisdom to be the 'product of the Holy Spirit also.'\r\nThroughout the literary world, as represented by convents, the use of\r\nLatin was general, and made possible the even spread of culture in\r\ndistricts that were widely remote from each other and practically\r\nwithout intercourse.\"\r\n\r\n[47] _The Lady_, p. 71, by Emily James Putnam, New York, 1910.\r\n\r\n[48] Eckenstein, op. cit., p. 478.\r\n\r\n[49] Ut.

Compare the attitude of the school of Salerno towards\r\nwomen with that of the University of London, eight hundred years later.\r\nWhen, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, women applied to\r\nthis university for degrees in medicine, they were informed, as H.\r\nRashdall writes in _The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages_, Vol.\r\nII, Part II, p. 712, Oxford, 1895, that \"the University of London,\r\nalthough it had been empowered by Royal Charter to do all things that\r\ncould be done by any University, was legally advised that it could not\r\ngrant degrees to women without a fresh Charter, because no University\r\nhad ever granted such degrees.\" Cf. also Haeser's _Lehrbuch der\r\nGeschichte der Medicin_, Band I, p. 645, et seq., Jena, 1875.

In later years all three enjoyed great\r\ncelebrity for their learning, and were, like Battista di Montefeltro,\r\nwomen of genuine humanist sympathies. Cecelia Gonzaga's scholarship was\r\nin no wise inferior to that of her learned brothers, who were among the\r\nmost noted students of the famous Casa Zoyosa in Mantua, where Vittorino\r\nda Feltre achieved such distinction as an educator in the early part of\r\nthe Italian Renaissance. The learned Italian writer, Sabbadini,\r\nbeautifully expressed the relation of women to Humanism, when he\r\ndeclares, in his _Vida di Guarino, \"L'Humanismo si sposa alla gentilezza\r\nfeminile_,\"--humanism weds feminine gentility.\r\n\r\n[58] Among them are the pictures of Caterina Vigri, which are preserved\r\nin the Pinacoteca of Bologna and in the Academia of Venice.\r\n\r\n[59] No less an authority than the illustrious sculptor, Canova,\r\ndeclared that her early death was one of the greatest losses ever\r\nsuffered by Italian art.\r\n\r\n[60] It was also said of the Venetian artist, Irene di Spilimbergo, that\r\nher pictures were of such excellence that they were frequently mistaken\r\nfor those of her illustrious master, Titian.\r\n\r\n[61] Among these works may be mentioned _Il Merito delle Donne_, by\r\nModesta Pozzo di Zorgi, Venice, 1600; _La Nobilita e l'Excellenza delle\r\nDonne_, by Lucrezia Marinelli, Venice, 1601; _De Ingenii Muliebris ad\r\nDoctrinam et Meliores Litteras Aptitudine_, by Anna van Schurman,\r\nLeyden, 1641; _Les Dames Illustres_, by Jaquette Guillame, Paris, 1665,\r\nand _L'Egalite des Hommes et des Femmes_, by Marie le Jars de Gournay,\r\nParis, 1622. The last named work was by the celebrated _fille\r\nd'alliance_--adopted daughter--of Montaigne. It is to her that we owe\r\nthe _textus receptus_ of the _Essais_ of the illustrious litterateur.\r\n\r\n[62] _The Women of the Renaissance_, p. 290, by R. de Maulde la\r\nClaviere, New York, 1901.\r\n\r\n[63] Called _La Latina_, because of her thorough knowledge of the Latin\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n[64] The famous Hellenist, Roger Ascham, tells of his astonishment on\r\nfinding Lady Jane Grey, when she was only fourteen years of age, reading\r\nPlato's Phaedo in Greek, when all the other members of the family were\r\namusing themselves in the park. On his inquiry why she did not join the\r\nothers in their pastime, she smilingly replied: \"I wit all their sport\r\nin the park is but a shadow to that pleasure I find in Plato. Alas, good\r\nfolk, they never knew what true pleasure meant.\"\r\n\r\n[65] To the poet Ronsard, she was a woman beyond compare, as is evinced\r\nby the following lines of a pastoral ode addressed to her:\r\n\r\n    \"La Royne Marguerite,\r\n    La plus belle fleur d'elite\r\n    Qu'onques la terre enfanta.\"\r\n\r\n[66] Cf. Oeuvres de Lovize Labe, nouvelle edition emprimee en caracteres\r\ndits de civilite, Paris, 1871.\r\n\r\n[67] The French poet, Jean Dorat, who was then professor of Latin in the\r\nCollege de France, expresses this fact in the following strophe:\r\n\r\n    \"Nempe uxor, ancillae, clientes, liberi,\r\n      Non segnis examen domus,\r\n    Quo Plautus ore, quo Terentius, solent\r\n      Quotidiane loqui.\"\r\n\r\n[68] A prominent writer of the time, Jean Bouchet, expressed the\r\nprevailing opinion regarding the education of the women of the masses in\r\nthe following quaint sentence: \"Je suis bien d'opinion que les femmes de\r\nbas estat, et qui sont contrainctes vaquer aux choses familieres et\r\ndomestiques, ne doivent vaquer aux lettres, parce que c'est chose\r\nrepugnante a rusticite; mais, les roynes, princesses et aultres dames\r\nqui ne se doib vent pour reverence de leur estat, appliquer a mesnage.\"\r\nCf. Rousellot's _Histoire de l'Education des Femmes en France_, Tom. I,\r\np. 109, Paris, 1883.\r\n\r\nHis ideal of a woman of the peasant type was apparently Joan of Arc,\r\nwho, according to her own declaration, did not know a from b--\"_elle\r\ndeclarait ne savoir ni a ni b_.\"\r\n\r\n[69] Claviere, op. cit., p. 415.\r\n\r\n[70] The noted English divine, Thomas Fuller, chaplain to Charles II,\r\nrecognized the irreparable loss to women occasioned by the destruction\r\nof the nunneries by the Reformers. \"There were,\" he tells us in his\r\nquaint language, \"good she schools wherein the girls and maids of the\r\nneyghborhood were taught to read and work.... Yea, give me leave to say,\r\nif such feminine foundations had still continued, ... haply the weaker\r\nsex, besides the avoiding modern inconveniences, might be heyghtened to\r\na higher perfection than hitherto hath been attained.\" _Church History_,\r\nVol. III, p. 336, 1845.\r\n\r\n[71] M. Thureau Dangin, the perpetual secretary of the French Academy,\r\nwrote, \"La tradition ne veut pas d'academiciennes.\"\r\n\r\n[72] Carlyle, in a lecture on Dante, and the _Divina Commedia_, declares\r\nthat \"Italy has produced a greater number of great men than any other\r\nnation, men distinguished in art, thinking, conduct, and everywhere in\r\nthe departments of intellect.\" He could with equal truth have said that\r\nItaly has produced more great women than any other nation.\r\n\r\n[73] _Medical Women_, p. 63, et seq., by Sophia Jex-Blake, Edinburgh,\r\n1886, and _Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women_,\r\nChap.

Dacier was a remarkable exception chiefly because she was the\r\ndaughter and pupil of one Hellenist before becoming the wife of another.\r\n\r\n[75] _Lettres et Entretiens sur l'Education de Filles_, Tom. I, pp.\r\n225-231.\r\n\r\nCompare this superficial course of study at Saint-Cyr with the elaborate\r\ncourse mapped out by Lionardo d'Arezzo in a letter addressed to the\r\nillustrious lady, Baptista Malatesta. In the broad programme of\r\neducation for women recommended by this eminent man of letters, \"poet,\r\norator, historian, and the rest, all must be studied, each must\r\ncontribute a share. Our learning thus becomes full, ready, varied,\r\nelegant, available for action or for discourse on all subjects.\"\r\n\r\nLionardo's curriculum of studies for women was quite as comprehensive as\r\nthat required for men, \"with perhaps a little less stress upon rhetoric\r\nand more upon religion. There was no assumption that a lower standard of\r\nattainment is inevitably a consequence of smaller capacity.\"\r\n\r\nNor was this thorough study of letters by the women of Italy\r\n\"unfavorably regarded by social opinion\"; neither did it introduce \"a\r\nnew standard of womanly activity. Women, indeed, at this epoch, seem to\r\nhave preserved their moral and intellectual balance under the stress of\r\nthe new enthusiasm better than men. The learned ladies were, in actual\r\nlife, good wives and mothers, domestic and virtuous women of strong\r\njudgment and not seldom of marked capacity in affairs.\" Cf. _Vittorino\r\nda Feltre and Other Humanist Educators_, pp. 122, 132, 197, by W. H.\r\nWoodward, Cambridge, 1905.\r\n\r\n[76] Thus, in a letter of hers to Mme. de Lauzun occurs a sentence like\r\nthe following: \"Il lia sy lontant que je n'ay antandu parler de vous.\"\r\nThe duchess of Monpensier, daughter of Gaston d'Orleans, in a letter to\r\nher father exhibits a similar ignorance of her own language, when she\r\nwrites: \"J'ai cru que Votre Altesse seret bien ese de savoir sete\r\nistoire.\" Quoted by Rousselot in his _Histoire de l'Education des Femmes\r\nen France_, Tom. I, p. 287.\r\n\r\n[77] _Les Femmes Savantes_, Act II, Scene 7.\r\n\r\n[78] Destouches, in his _L'Homme singulier_, makes one of his female\r\ncharacters, who loves study, speak in the following pathetic fashion:\r\n\r\n    \"A learned woman ought--so I surmise--\r\n    Conceal her knowledge, or she'll be unwise.\r\n    If pedantry a mental blemish be\r\n    At all times outlawed by society,\r\n    If 'gainst a pedant all the world inveighs,\r\n    Shall pass unchecked in woman pedant's ways?\r\n    I hold it sure, condemned my sex is quite\r\n    To trifling nothings as its sole birthright;\r\n    Ridiculous 'tis thought outside its 'sphere';\r\n    The learned woman dare not such appear;\r\n    Nay, she must even cloak her brilliancy\r\n    So envy leave in peace stupidity;\r\n    Must keep the level of the common kind,\r\n    To subjects commonplace devote her mind,\r\n    And treating these she must be like the rest.\r\n    Lo, in such garb refinement must be dressed:\r\n    That knowledge shall not make her seem unwise,\r\n    She must herself in foolishness disguise.\"\r\n\r\n                       --Act III, Scene 7.\r\n\r\n[79] No one, however, went so far in his opposition to the education of\r\nwomen as the notorious Silvain _Marechal_, the author of _Projet d'une\r\nLoi portant Defense d'Apprendre a Lire aux Femmes_, who would have a law\r\npassed forbidding women to learn to read. He maintained that a knowledge\r\nof science and letters interfered with their being good housekeepers.\r\n\"Reason,\" he avers, \"does not approve of women studying chemistry. Women\r\nwho are unable to read make the best soup. I would rather,\" he declares\r\nin the words of Balzac, \"have a wife with a beard than a wife who is\r\neducated.\" See pp. 40, 50 and 51, of the edition of this strange work,\r\npublished at Brussels, 1847.\r\n\r\n[80] In her _Problema Practicum_, addressed to Dr. Rivet, Anna van\r\nSchurman states and develops in true syllogistic form a series of\r\npropositions in defense of her thesis in favor of the higher education\r\nof women. Two of these propositions are here given as illustrative of\r\nher points of view:\r\n\r\nI. Cui natura inest scientiarum artiumque desiderium, ei conveniunt\r\nscientiae et artes. Atque feminae natura inest scientiarum artiumque\r\ndesiderium. Ergo.\r\n\r\nII Quidquid intellectum hominis perficit et exornat, id femmae Christianae\r\nconvenit.

To keepe account of all things, to know the\r\ncondition of the poultry--for it misbecomes no woman to be a hen-wife.\r\nTo know how to order your clothes and with frugality to mend them and to\r\nbuy but what is necessary with ready money. To love to keep at home.\"\r\nHow like the German four K's and the words on the sarcophagus of a Roman\r\nmatron--_lanifica_, _frugi_, _domiseda_--a diligent plyer of the\r\ndistaff, thrifty and a stay-at-home.\r\n\r\n[82] _The Letters and Works of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu_, Vol. II, p.\r\n5, Bohn Edition, 1887.\r\n\r\n[83] Letter XLIX, London, Sept. 5, O. S., 1748.\r\n\r\nWalpole, writing in 1773, makes the following curious declaration: \"I\r\nmade a discovery--Lady Nuneham is a poetess, and writes with great ease\r\nand sense some poetry, but is as afraid of the character, as if it was a\r\nsin to make verses.\" And Lord Granville tells us of an eminent statesman\r\nand man of letters who, in the early part of the last century, was so\r\ntroubled on discovering in his daughter a talent for poetry that he\r\n\"appealed to her affection for him, and made a request to her never to\r\nwrite verses again. He was not afraid of her becoming a good poetess,\r\nbut he was afraid of the disadvantages which were likely to be suffered\r\nby her, if she were supposed to be a lady of literary attainments.\"\r\n\r\n[84] It was Swift who had such a low opinion of woman's intellect that\r\nin writing to one of his fair correspondents he told her that she could\r\n\"never arrive in point of learning to the perfection of a schoolboy.\"\r\nLady Pennington, strange to say, seems to have shared his views, for in\r\na manual of advice to young ladies, she declares: \"A sensible woman will\r\nsoon be convinced that all the learning the utmost application can make\r\nher master of will be in many points inferior to that of the schoolboy.\"\r\n\"At the time the Tatler first appeared in the female world any\r\nacquaintance with books was distinguished only to be censured,\" and it\r\nwas then considered \"more important for a woman to dance a minuet well\r\nthan to know a foreign language.\"\r\n\r\n[85] The wife of President John Adams, descended from the most\r\nillustrious colonial families, writing in 1817, regarding the\r\neducational opportunities of the girls of her time and rank, expressed\r\nherself as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Female education in the best families went no farther than writing and\r\narithmetic, and, in some few and rare instances, music and dancing.\"\r\nAccording to her grandson, Charles Francis Adams, \"The only chance for\r\nmuch intellectual improvement in the female sex was to be found in the\r\nfamilies of the educated class, and in occasional intercourse with the\r\nlearned of the day. Whatever of useful instruction was secured in the\r\npractical conduct of life came from maternal lips; and, what of farther\r\nmental development depended more upon the eagerness with which the\r\ncasual teachings of daily conversation were treasured up than upon any\r\nlabor expended purposely to promote it.\" _Familiar Letters of John Adams\r\nand His Wife, Abigail Adams, During the Revolution, With a Memoir of\r\nMrs. Adams_, by Charles Francis Adams, pp. X and XI, New York, 1876.\r\n\r\n[86] When the students of Girton and Newnham in 1897, after passing the\r\nCambridge examinations--many of them with the highest honors--applied\r\nfor degrees, \"the undergraduate world was stirred to a fine frenzy of\r\nwrath against all womankind,\" and an astonished world saw re-enacted\r\nscenes scarcely less disgraceful than those which characterized the\r\nriotous demonstrations which, seventeen years before, had greeted seven\r\nyoung women at the portals of the University of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n[87] _The Queen's Reign_, Chap. V, London, 1897.\r\n\r\n[88] Proposition third, of her _Propositiones Philosophicae_, Milan,\r\n1738, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Optime etiam de universa Philosophia infirmiorem sexum meruisse nullus\r\ninfirmabitur; nam praeter septuaginta fere eruditissimas, Mulieres, quas\r\nrecenset Menagius, complures alias quovis tempore floruisse novimus, quae\r\nin philosophicis disciplinis maximam ingenii laudem sunt assecutae.

This\r\nthing is not to say ne to sustayne. That the woman apayreth by conynge\r\nit is not well to beleve. As the proverb saythe, 'that nature gyveth may\r\nnot be taken away.'\"\r\n\r\nThe book from which this remarkable quotation is taken is a translation\r\nof Christine de Pisan's _La Cite des Dames_, which was written early in\r\nthe fifteenth century. It is a capital defence against the slanderers of\r\nthe gentler sex and an armory of arguments for all time against those\r\nmen who declare that \"women are fit for nothing but to bear children and\r\nspin.\" It shows conclusively that conynge--knowledge--far from tending\r\nto injure women's character--apayre theyr condycyons--as was asserted by\r\nChristine's antagonists, contributes, on the contrary, to elevate and\r\nennoble them and to render them better mothers and more useful members\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that it was written five hundred years ago, and\r\nnotwithstanding its \"antiquated allegorical dress and its quaint\r\npre-Renaissance notions of history,\" it is in many of its aspects a\r\nsurprisingly modern production. The line of argument adopted by the\r\nwriter is virtually the same as that which is adopted to-day in the\r\ndiscussion of the same questions which are so ably treated in this\r\nlong-forgotten book[89] and show that Christine de Pisan was in every\r\nway a worthy champion of her sex.\r\n\r\nNo woman of her time was more competent to discuss the capacity of her\r\nsex for science as well as for other intellectual pursuits than was this\r\nlearned daughter of Italy. She was not only a woman of profound and\r\nvaried knowledge, but was also, as stated in the preceding chapter, the\r\nfirst woman to earn her living by her pen. Besides writing _The City of\r\nLadies_ and more verses--mostly ballads and virelays--than are contained\r\nin the _Divina Commedia_, she was also the author of many other works on\r\nthe most diverse subjects. She is best known to historians as the author\r\nof _Livre des Fais et Bonnes Meurs du sage Roy Charles V_, which is a\r\ngraphic account of the court and policy of this monarch, and of the\r\n_Livre des Faits d'Armes et de Chevalerie_. The latter work is not, as\r\nmight be imagined from its title, a collection of tales of chivalry,\r\nbut, incredible as it may seem, a profound and systematic treatise on\r\nmilitary tactics and international law. It deals with \"many topics of\r\nthe highest policy, from the manners of a good general and the minutiae\r\nof siege operations to the wager of battle, safe-conducts and letters of\r\nmarque,\" and was deemed so important by Henry VII that at his expressed\r\ndesire it was translated into English and published by Caxton under the\r\ntitle of _The Boke of Fayettes of Armes and Chyvalrye_. Even so late as\r\nthe time of Henry VIII it was regarded as an authoritative manual on the\r\ntopics treated.\r\n\r\nSo great, indeed, was the extent and variety of Christine's attainments,\r\nso thoroughly had she studied the Latin and Greek authors, sacred and\r\nprofane, and so profound was her knowledge of all the subjects which she\r\ndealt with in her numerous books that \"one cannot but feel a certain\r\nastonishment when one finds in a woman in the fourteenth century an\r\nerudition such as is hardly possessed by the most laborious of men.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we read the eloquent plea which this learned woman of five\r\ncenturies ago makes in behalf of her sex, when we note the examples she\r\nquotes of women \"illumined of great sciences,\" and consider the\r\narguments by which she demonstrated the capacity of women for all\r\nscientific pursuits, we can easily fancy that we are reading the brief\r\nof some modern exponent of the woman's rights movement and are almost\r\ndisposed to believe that La Bruyiere was right when he declared, _Les\r\nanciens ont tout dit_. For so cogent is Christine's reasoning and so\r\nthoroughly does she traverse her subject from every point of view that\r\nshe has left later writers little to add to the controversy except\r\nmatters of detail which were not available in her time.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of Christine's _Cyte of Ladyes_, \"in which,\"\r\naccording to our mediaeval paragon, \"women, hitherto scattered and\r\ndefenceless, were forever to find refuge against all their slanderers,\"\r\nin spite of the fact that the foundations of this city were laid by\r\nReason, that its walls and cloisters were built on Righteousness, and\r\nits battlements and high towers on Justice, in spite of the fact that\r\nthe material entering into its construction was \"stronger and more\r\ndurable than any marble,\" and that it was, as our author declares, \"a\r\ncity right fair, without fear and of perpetual during to the world--a\r\ncity that should never be brought to nought,\" Christine's work was soon\r\nlost sight of, and the right of women to the same intellectual\r\nadvantages as men was as strongly denied as it had been before she had\r\nso valiantly championed their cause, and denied, too, on the assumed\r\nground of their innate incapacity.\r\n\r\nIt mattered not that during the succeeding centuries other women took up\r\nthe cause for which the author of _La Cite des Dames_ had so nobly\r\nbattled; it mattered not that countless women in every civilized country\r\nof the globe distinguished themselves by their achievements in every\r\ndepartment of science and gave evidence of talent and genius of the\r\nhighest order; it mattered not that chivalrous representatives of the\r\nsterner sex, like John Stuart Mill, came forward to plead the case of\r\nthat half of humanity which had so long been held in cruel subjection.\r\nThe attitude of the world toward the intellectually disfranchised sex\r\nremained unchanged almost until our own time.\r\n\r\nBut, although women now enjoy advantages in the pursuit of science which\r\nwere undreamed of only a generation ago, the age-old prejudices\r\nrespecting woman's mental powers and her capacity for the more abstract\r\nbranches of science still prevail. It is useless to cite instances of\r\nwomen who have attained eminence in astronomy, mathematics, archaeology,\r\nor in any other science whatever. Such instances, we are assured, are\r\nonly exceptions and prove nothing. Men like Lombroso are willing to\r\nadmit the existence of an occasional woman of talent, but they deny the\r\nexistence of genius in one who is truly a womanly woman.[90] For, with\r\nGoncourt, they flippantly assert, _Il n'y a pas de femmes de genie:\r\nlorsqu'elles sont des genies, elles sont des hommes_--there are no women\r\nof genius; when they have genius they are men.\r\n\r\nThe reasons that now influence men for affirming the intellectual\r\ndisparity of the sexes are, it must be observed, quite different from\r\nwhat they were in the time of Christine de Pisan--quite different from\r\nwhat they were half a century ago. Our forebears, in their endless\r\ndisputations regarding woman's mental inferiority, based their arguments\r\non _a priori_ deductions, or on metaphysical considerations which proved\r\nnothing and which were often irrelevant, if not absurd.\r\n\r\nThus the Aristotelians, accepting as true the doctrine of the four\r\nelements as well as the superimposed doctrine of the four elemental\r\nqualities, sought to explain the properties of all compound bodies by\r\nthese primal qualities. In this way they explained the various virtues\r\nof drugs and medicines. And by the same process of reasoning they\r\nexplained the assumed difference between male and female brains. They\r\nassumed, to begin with, that there was a difference between the\r\nintellectual capacities of men and women. They then assumed that this\r\ndifference in capacity was due to the difference in character and\r\ntexture of the female as compared with those of the male brain. They\r\nnext further assumed that the doctrines of the four elements and of the\r\nfour elemental qualities were established beyond question, and then\r\nassumed again that the reason of woman's inferior capacity was due to\r\nthe fact that her brain was moister and softer, and, therefore, more\r\nimpressionable than that of man. No wonder that the old Spanish\r\nBenedictine, Benito Jeronimo Feijoo, in his chivalrous _Defensa de la\r\nMujer_, lost all patience with such fantastic theorizers and wrote: \"Did\r\nI write ... to display my wit, I could easily, by deducting a chain of\r\nconsequences from received principles, shew that man's understanding,\r\nweighed in the balance with female capacity, would be found so light as\r\nto kick the beam.\"[91]\r\n\r\nAbandoning the Aristotelian method of envisaging the question under\r\ndiscussion, our modern philosophers have recourse to the recent\r\nsciences of biology and psycho-physiology to prove what they, too,\r\nassume to be true--viz., woman's incurable mental weakness. Like their\r\npredecessors, they are dominated by passion, prejudice, the errors of\r\ncountless centuries, and, like them, they approach the subject on which\r\nthey are to pronounce judgment, with minds warped by long ages of\r\nimperious instincts, ignorant preconceptions and social bias. They will\r\nquote the opinions of Proudhon and Schopenhauer--as if they had the\r\nvalue of mathematical demonstrations--on the mental inferiority of\r\nwomen, and will declare with unblushing assurance that no woman has ever\r\nproduced a single work of any kind of enduring worth. With the German\r\npessimist, they will blatantly declare, taken as a whole, \"women are and\r\nremain thoroughgoing Philistines and quite incurable.\"[92] With the\r\nFrench socialist they will assert, as if it were an axiomatic truth,\r\nthat \"thought in every living being is proportional to force\"--that\r\n\"physical force is not less necessary for thought than for muscular\r\nlabor.\"\r\n\r\nThey have apparently no more doubt respecting the truth of these\r\nassumptions than had their predecessors, the Aristotelians, respecting\r\ntheir assumptions of the four elements and their first qualities. Their\r\nprocess of reasoning is somewhat as follows: \"Woman is smaller and\r\nweaker than man. This is a matter of simple observation, confirmed by\r\nthe teachings of physiology. Therefore, woman is physically and\r\nintellectually inferior to man. Therefore she is incapable of any of\r\nthose great conceptions and achievements in science or philosophy which\r\nhave so distinguished the male sex in every age of the world's history.\r\nThat she is thus weaker and inferior physically and intellectually and\r\nforever incapacitated from successfully competing with man in the\r\nintellectual arena is a fatality for which, we are gravely told, there\r\nis no remedy, and to which women, consequently, must resign themselves\r\nas to one of the inexorable laws of nature.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to cite a more preposterous example of\r\nratiocination. If it were true that there is a necessary relation\r\nbetween vigor of body and vigor of mind; that mental power is\r\nproportional to physical power; that thought is but a special form of\r\nenergy and capable of transformation, like heat, light and electricity;\r\nthat it, like the various physical forces, has its chemical and\r\nmechanical equivalents; that psychic work corresponds to a certain\r\namount of chemical or thermic action; that intellectual capacity in man\r\nis proportional to muscular strength; it would follow that the great\r\nleaders of thought and action through the ages have been Goliaths in\r\nstature and Herculeses in strength. But so far is this conclusion from\r\nbeing warranted that it is almost the reverse of the truth. For many, if\r\nnot the majority, of the great geniuses of the world in every age have\r\nbeen either men of small frame or men of delicate and precarious health.\r\n\r\nAmong the men of genius who were noted for their diminutive stature were\r\nPlato, Aristotle, Alexander the Great, Archimedes, Epicurus, Horace,\r\nAlbertus Magnus, Montaigne, Lipsius, Spinoza, Erasmus, Lalande, Charles\r\nLamb, Keats, Balzac and Thiers. Many others were remarkable for their\r\nspare form. Among these in the prime of life were Aristotle,\r\nDemosthenes, Cicero, St. Paul, Kepler, Pascal, Boileau, Fenelon,\r\nD'Alembert, Napoleon, Lincoln and Leo XIII. Others, like Aesop,\r\nBrunelleschi, Leopardi, Magliabecchi, Parini, Scarron, Talleyrand, Pope,\r\nGoldsmith, Byron, Sir Walter Scott, to mention only a few of the most\r\neminent, were either hunchbacked, lame, rachitic or clubfooted.\r\n\r\nOthers, still, were the victims of chronic ill health, or of nervous\r\ndisorders of the most serious character. Virgil was of a delicate and\r\nfrail constitution. He essayed the bar, but shrank from it and turned to\r\nthe \"contemplation of diviner things.\" Nor was Horace, though less\r\ncompletely a recluse and more of a _bon vivant_, a strong man. Both of\r\nthem, as scholars will remember, sought the couch, while Maecenas went\r\noff to the tennis court. Pope's life, says Johnson, was a long disease.\r\nJohnson himself, though large and muscular, had queer health and a\r\ntormenting constitution. Schiller wrote most of his best work while\r\nstruggling against a painful malady, and Heine's \"mattress grave\" is\r\nproverbial. France furnishes an excellent example in Pascal.[93]\r\n\r\nSome of the most noted leaders of thought in our own era were likewise\r\nchronic invalids. Among these were the scholarly theologian, E. B.\r\nPusey, and J. A. Symonds, the historian of the Renaissance. There was\r\nalso Herbert Spencer, who was frequently forced by nervous breakdowns to\r\ntake long periods of absolute rest. More remarkable still was the case\r\nof the famous naturalist, Charles Darwin. \"It is,\" writes his son, \"a\r\nprincipal feature of his life that for nearly forty years he never knew\r\none day of the health of ordinary men, and that thus his life was one\r\nlong struggle against the weariness and the strain of sickness.\"[94]\r\nBut, notwithstanding his continued ill health and the spinal anemia from\r\nwhich he suffered, he was able to conduct those epoch-making researches\r\nwhich put him in the forefront of men of science, and to write those\r\nfamous books which have completely revolutionized our views of nature\r\nand nature's laws.\r\n\r\nBut a still more remarkable illustration of the fact that there is no\r\nnecessary relation between muscular and mental power, between physical\r\nwell-being and intellectual energy, is afforded by the illustrious\r\ndiscoverer of the world of the infinitely little, Louis Pasteur.\r\nStricken by hemiplegia shortly after he had begun those brilliant\r\ninvestigations which have rendered him immortal, he remained affected by\r\npartial paralysis until the end of his life. His friends had reason to\r\nfear that this attack, even if he should survive it, would weaken or\r\nextinguish his spirit of initiative, if it did not make further work\r\nentirely impossible. But this was far from the case. For a quarter of a\r\ncentury he continued with unabated activity those marvelous labors which\r\nare forever associated with his name. And it was after, not before, his\r\nmisfortune that he made his most famous discoveries in the domain of\r\nmicrobian life, and placed in the hands of physicians and surgeons those\r\ninfallible means of combatting disease which have made him one of the\r\ngreatest benefactors of suffering humanity. The complete separation of\r\nthe intellectual from the motor faculties was never more clearly\r\nexhibited than in this case, nor was it ever more completely\r\ndemonstrated by an experiment, whose validity no one could question,\r\nthat power of mind does not necessarily depend on strength or health of\r\nbody. It proved, also, in the most telling manner that it is not\r\nmuscular but psychic force which avails most, whether to the individual\r\nor to society. And it showed, at the same time, the utter absurdity of\r\nthose theories which would fatally connect intellectual with physical\r\ndebility in woman, and would forever adjudge the physically weaker sex\r\nto be of hopeless inferiority in all things of the mind.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of men achieving renown, notwithstanding ill health,\r\nmay likewise be affirmed of women. The case of Elizabeth Barrett\r\nBrowning is scarcely less remarkable than that of Darwin. In spite of\r\nbeing a chronic invalid the greater part of her life, she attained a\r\nposition in letters reached by but few of her contemporaries. The same\r\nalmost may be said of the three Bronte sisters. The deadly seeds of\r\nconsumption were sown in their systems in early youth, but, although\r\nfully aware that life had \"passed them by with averted head,\" they\r\nwere, through their indomitable wills, able to send forth from their\r\nbleak home in the wild Yorkshire moors works of genius that still\r\ninstruct and delight the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is clear that valetudinarianism, if it prove\r\nanything, proves not that it renders intellectual effort impossible, but\r\nthat it serves as a discipline for the soul. It forces the mind to\r\nhusband its strength, and thus enables it to accomplish by economy and\r\nconcentration of effort that which the same mind in a healthy body, with\r\nthe distractions of society and the allurements of life, would be unable\r\nto accomplish. It exemplifies in the most striking manner the truth of\r\nwhat Socrates says in Plato's _Republic_ about the beneficent action of\r\nthe \"bridle of Theages,\" preventing an infirm friend of his from\r\nembracing politics and keeping him true to his first love--philosophy.\r\n\r\nFailing to show any necessary connection between superior physique and\r\nintellectual capacity, between health of body and mental activity,\r\nbetween the amount of food consumed and the degree of intelligence, the\r\nclass of thinkers whose theories are now under consideration found\r\nthemselves forced to abandon the argument based on robust health and\r\nphysical strength and seek elsewhere for support of their views. This,\r\nthey soon announced, was found in the greater cranial capacity and\r\ngreater brain weight of the male as compared with that of the female.\r\nFollowing up this fancied clew, anthropologists the world over began\r\nmeasuring skulls and weighing brains in order to determine the supposed\r\nratio of sex-difference.\r\n\r\nThe results of these investigations were far from corroborating the\r\npreconceived notions of those who had fancied a necessary correlation\r\nbetween mental capacity and size of cranium, between the weight of\r\nencephalon and degree of intelligence. For it was soon discovered that\r\ncranial capacity depended on many causes--many of them unknown--and that\r\npeople having the largest skulls were often far from being the ones\r\ndowered with the greatest intellectual power. It was found, for\r\ninstance, that climate was a determining factor--that the inhabitants of\r\nnorthern regions have larger heads than those who live farther south.\r\nThus the Lapps, in proportion to their stature, have the largest heads\r\nin Europe. After these come in order the Scandinavians, the Germans, the\r\nFrench, the Italians, the Arabs.\r\n\r\nIt was found also that the least cranial capacity of the ancient\r\nEgyptians coincides with the most brilliant period of their\r\ncivilization--that of the eighteenth dynasty. Measurements of skulls\r\nunearthed at Pompeii showed that the heads of the Romans who lived two\r\nthousand years ago were larger than the heads of the Romans of to-day.\r\nSimilarly, the skulls of the lake-dwellers of Switzerland were larger\r\nthan those of the Swiss people of the present time, while the average\r\ncircumference of the skulls measured in the catacombs of Paris is more\r\nthan an inch greater than that of the Parisians who have died during the\r\nlast half century. The circumference of the skulls of a large number of\r\nmound-builders, excavated some years ago near Carrollton, Illinois,\r\nexceeded that of the average head of white men in New York of our day by\r\nnearly three inches. This shows that the culture of the white race\r\nduring long centuries has not developed its cranial capacity to equal\r\nthat of the uncultured Indians who flourished in the Mississippi valley\r\nuntold generations ago.\r\n\r\nThe skulls of Quaternary men were likewise very voluminous, although\r\nthey belonged to a race whose mental manifestations were infantile in\r\nthe extreme. Even the celebrated Engis skull, one of the most ancient in\r\nexistence, has been described by the late Professor Huxley as well\r\nformed and considerably larger than the average of the European skulls\r\nof to-day, not only in the width and height of the forehead, but also in\r\nthe cubic capacity of the whole. Furthermore, the eminent craniologist,\r\nBroca, has proved that the illiterate peasants of Auvergne have a much\r\ngreater cranial capacity than that of the learned and cultured denizens\r\nof Paris. And, as if to show conclusively that there is no necessary\r\nconnection between intellectual capacity and size of cranium, authentic\r\nmeasurements disclose the fact that some of the most gifted men the\r\nworld has known had small heads. Among these were Dante and Voltaire.\r\nThe skull of the latter is one of the smallest which has thus far been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said regarding the relation of cranial volume to\r\nintellectual capacity, as revealed by the measurements of the skulls of\r\nancient and modern, savage and civilized peoples may likewise be\r\npredicated of the differences in the sizes of the crania of men and\r\nwomen. No argument as to the greater or less intelligence of either sex\r\ncan be based on mere craniometric determinations. \"At the best, cranial\r\ncapacity is but a rough indication of brain size; and to measure brain\r\nsize by the external size of the skull furnishes still rougher and more\r\nfallacious approximations, since the male skull is more massive than the\r\nfemale.\"\r\n\r\nEven the slight morphological differences between male and female\r\nskulls--some anthropologists deny that there are any at all--afford no\r\nmore ground for conclusions in favor of the superiority of one or the\r\nother sex than the relative differences in size. Such trifling\r\ndifferences as do exist exhibit, as Virchow has pointed out, an\r\napproximation of men to the savage, simian and senile type, and an\r\napproach of women to the infantile type. Havelock Ellis, commenting on\r\nthis difference, pertinently remarks, \"It is open to a man in a\r\nPharisaic mood to thank God that his cranial type is far removed from\r\nthe infantile. It is equally open to woman in such a mood to be thankful\r\nthat her cranial type does not approach the senile.\"[95]\r\n\r\nBut much stress as has been laid on physical power, health and cranial\r\ncapacity, as determining factors of intellectual capacity and sexual\r\ndifferences, far greater stress has been laid on conclusions deducible\r\nfrom the relative brain weights of different classes of people as well\r\nas of different sexes. It was assumed that by a critical study of the\r\nbrain, by careful weighings of many brains of both sexes and of many\r\nraces, it would be easy to secure conclusive evidence that the size and\r\nweight of the brain increase with the amount of intelligence of the\r\nindividual. It was also assumed that function not only makes the organ,\r\nbut also develops it. Brain became synonymous with mind. A large brain\r\nimplied vigor of thought; a small brain was evidence of mental\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\nPhysiology had demonstrated unquestionably that the muscles of the body\r\nare enlarged by exercise. It was assumed by those who are wont to\r\nmeasure mind in terms of matter that the brain, being the organ of\r\nthought, was also developed by exercise. It was also assumed that the\r\ndevelopment of the brain was in a direct ratio to its activity. The\r\ngreater its activity the greater its mass, and the greater the mass the\r\ngreater the degree of intelligence. In other words, it was assumed that\r\nthere was an exact and invariable proportion between weight of brain and\r\namount of brain power.\r\n\r\nNone of the theories which have already been adverted to have been so\r\nfull of assumptions and prejudices or vitiated by so many fallacies and\r\nover-hasty generalizations as this. No subject has possessed a greater\r\nfascination for anthropologists, and no subject has been prolific in\r\nmore diverse and conflicting conclusions. Many men of science who, in\r\nother matters, were noted for their care in weighing evidence, before\r\nformulating theories, completely lost the scientific spirit when they\r\nbegan to weigh brains and to draw conclusions respecting the relations\r\nof brain weight and mental power, and to establish ratios between the\r\ncharacter of the convolutions of the organ of thought and the degree of\r\nintelligence of its possessor.\r\n\r\nContrary to what is generally believed, a large brain is not always an\r\nindication of superior capacity or intelligence. There have been, it is\r\ntrue, a number of men of genius who were the possessors of large brains,\r\nbut there have also been others whose brains were of but medium weight.\r\n\r\nThe largest known brains of intellectual workers were those of Cuvier,\r\nthe noted zoologist, and Turgenieff, the distinguished novelist. The\r\nbrain of the Frenchman weighed 1830 grams, while that of the Russian\r\ntotaled 2012 grams. Among other large brains--even larger than\r\nCuvier's--were those of a bricklayer, which weighed 1900 grams, and of\r\nan ordinary laborer, which reached 1924 grams. The largest brains on\r\nrecord were that of an ignorant laborer named Rustan, which weighed 2222\r\ngrams; that of a weak-minded London newsboy, which weighed 2268 grams,\r\nand that of a twenty-one-year-old epileptic idiot, which had the unheard\r\nof weight of 2850 grams.[96]\r\n\r\nThe seven largest recorded female brains were three weighing 1580 grams\r\neach, one of which belonged to a medical student of marked ability,\r\nwhile the other two belonged to quite undistinguished women. There were\r\ntwo others weighing 1587 each, one of which belonged to an insane woman.\r\nStill heavier than these by far were the brains of an insane woman who\r\ndied of consumption, and of a dwarfed Indian squaw. The brain of the\r\nfirst weighed 1742 grams; while that of the second was no less than 2084\r\ngrams.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing examples it is evident that a large brain is far from\r\nbeing a certain index of mental capacity or of superior intelligence. It\r\nis frequently the very reverse. If, for instance, it fail to receive\r\nthe necessary supply of blood, it will be inert or disordered and will\r\nprove to be a dangerous possession rather than a precious endowment.\r\nEpileptics usually have brains that are large relatively to the size of\r\nthe body. And, while it is probably true that the great thinkers and men\r\nof action of the world have, in most instances, had comparatively large\r\nbrains, it is also true that the brain weights of but few of them\r\nexceeded 1500 grams, while those of many fall below 1200 grams.\r\n\r\nThus the brain of Gambetta, \"the foremost Frenchman of his time,\"\r\nweighed only 1159 grams, while the weight of the brain of Napoleon I was\r\n1502 grams--barely equal to that of a negro described by the\r\nanthropologist Broca, and but little superior to that of a Hottentot\r\nmentioned by Dr. Jeffries Wyman.[97]\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Joseph Simms found the average brain weight of sixty\r\npersons who were either imbeciles, idiots, criminals or men of ordinary\r\nmind to be 1792 grams, while that of sixty famous men was 1454 grams, a\r\ndifference in favor of men not noted for intellectual greatness of 338\r\ngrams. These figures are far from showing that large brains are a\r\nnecessary concomitant of mental capacity.\r\n\r\nIn view of these and many similar facts, we are not surprised that the\r\neminent German anatomist and anthropologist, Rudolph Wagner, should\r\ndeclare that \"very intelligent men do not differ strikingly in brain\r\nweight from less gifted men,\" and that the noted French physician,\r\nEsquirol, should assert that \"no size or form of head or brain is\r\nincident to idiocy or superior talent.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as civilized races are concerned, there can be no doubt that the\r\nabsolute weight of the male is greater than that of the female brain.\r\nAccording to the investigations of seven of the most notable\r\nanthropologists, who have given special attention to the subject under\r\nconsideration, and who, collectively, have carefully weighed many\r\nthousands of brains, the average brain weight of men in Europe is 1381\r\ngrams, while that of women is 1237 grams. This shows a difference\r\nbetween the average weight of the brain in man and woman of 144 grams.\r\n\r\nBut, if it must be conceded that the absolute weight of man's brain is\r\ngreater than woman's, is it likewise true that the relative weight is\r\ngreater? This is a question which demands an answer, as it is impossible\r\nto come to any just conclusion respecting the intellectual capacity of\r\nwoman expressed in terms of brain weight, unless we can affirm with\r\ncertainty that men's brains are relatively, as well as absolutely,\r\nlarger than those of women.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the relative weight of brain in man implies a term of\r\ncomparison. Several methods of estimating the sexual proportions of\r\nbrain mass have been suggested, but only two of them have met with any\r\nfavor. These are determining the ratio of brain weight to body weight or\r\nbody height.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations of anthropologists of acknowledged\r\nauthority, the average brain weight of woman is to that of man in\r\nEngland and France as 90 is to 100. The average stature of men and women\r\nin the same countries is as 93 to 100. This gives man an excess of brain\r\nweight over that of woman of something more than an ounce. But this\r\nslight difference in weight has been considered sufficient to constitute\r\nit \"a fundamental sexual distinction.\" When, however, it is considered\r\nthat men are not only taller but also larger than women, this apparent\r\nadvantage of an ounce in favor of the male entirely disappears, and the\r\nresult is that the relative amount of brain mass in the two sexes is\r\npractically equal.\r\n\r\nBecause of the manifest inaccuracy of the stature criterion, many\r\neminent anthropologists have prepared to estimate sexual differences in\r\nbrain weight by adopting the method based on the ratio of brain mass to\r\nbody weight. According to this method, women are found to possess\r\nbrains which are equal to or even somewhat larger than those of men. If\r\nthe comparative excess of non-vital tissue in the form of fat in woman\r\nbe eliminated and estimates be based only on the active organic mass of\r\nher body, as compared with the same mass in man, the excess of brain\r\nweight in woman over that in man will be still more marked.\r\n\r\nA careful study, then, of the brain as a whole, far from proving woman's\r\ninferiority to man, rather proves her superiority. The same may be said\r\nregarding sexual distinctions based on certain parts of the brain.\r\n\r\nSome years ago it was positively asserted that the development of the\r\nfrontal lobe exhibited a pronounced difference in the two sexes. It was\r\nsaid to be much greater in man than in woman and was regarded as a\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of the male sex. This was in keeping with\r\nthe generally accepted assumption that this portion of the brain is the\r\nseat of the higher intellectual processes. Further investigation,\r\nhowever, showed that there was practically no sexual difference in the\r\nfrontal lobe of the brain, or, if there was a difference, it was\r\nprobably in favor of woman.\r\n\r\nIt has also become recognized that there is no valid reason for\r\nconsidering the anterior portion of the brain as the seat of the higher\r\nmental functions. It is possible, but in the present state of science it\r\ncan neither be affirmed nor denied. So far as our present knowledge\r\ngoes, it seems more likely that the whole of the brain, especially the\r\nsensori-motor regions of its middle part, have a part in mental\r\noperations. At all events, it can certainly be affirmed that Huschke's\r\ndistinction of man and woman into _homo frontalis et homo parietalis_ is\r\nutterly devoid of foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nMany anthropologists have fancied that a certain index of the degree of\r\nintelligence is to be found in the convolutions of the brain. The\r\ntortuous foldings of the female brain, it is asserted, are less ample,\r\nless pronounced and less beautiful. \"Behold,\" they exclaim, \"a most\r\npositive evidence of inferiority.\" These men overlook the fact that\r\ncertain animals, notably the elephant and divers species of cetaceans,\r\nhave cerebral convolutions that are more complex than those of man. If,\r\nthen, brain convolutions were, as claimed, a certain index of the degree\r\nof intelligence, the whale or the elephant, and not man--_pace_\r\nShakespeare--would be \"the paragon of animals.\"\r\n\r\nBut men of science are by no means at one on this alleged sexual\r\ndifference in brain convolutions. On the contrary, there are many\r\neminent physiologists and anatomists who contend that the superficies of\r\nbrain convolutions in women is relatively greater than in men. For those\r\nwho believe--and they are probably the majority at present--that the\r\nseat of mental activity is in the gray matter of the brain, this greater\r\nbrain surface, due to its convolutions, would be a decided compensation\r\nfor woman's relatively smaller brain volume.[98]\r\n\r\nIn whatever way, then, we consider the brains of men and women, whether\r\nwe compare the ratio of brain weight to height of body or to weight of\r\nbody, or compare the relative amounts of gray matter in the two sexes,\r\nthe advantage, in spite of her smaller body, is distinctly in favor of\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding considerations it seems clear that there is no ground\r\nfrom the point of view of brain anatomy for considering one sex as\r\nsuperior to the other. They evince, too, that quality as well as\r\nquantity of brain tissue must be considered in all our discussions on\r\nthe relations between the volume of brain and the intelligence of its\r\npossessor. Whales and elephants have much larger brains than men, but\r\nthey nevertheless stand far below him in intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, also, that the brain is not only an organ of\r\nmental function. It is likewise the center of the entire nervous system,\r\nand its volume, therefore, must correspond with the size and number of\r\nnerve trunks under its control. In man, as in animals, the brain\r\nelements are to a great extent but sensori-motor delegates whose\r\nfunction is the regulation and government of every part of the body. The\r\nsuperior size of the whale's brain, as compared with that of man, can\r\nreadily be understood when we reflect on the much greater amount of\r\nterritory which these sensori-motor delegates represent. When this fact\r\nis borne in mind it will be found that the whale's brain, relatively to\r\nthat of man, is extremely small. For while the ratio of man's brain\r\nweight to that of his body is as 1 to 36, the ratio of the whale's brain\r\nweight to its immense body is but 1 to 3,000.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence that quality often counts for more than quantity, brain\r\nanatomists would do well to reflect on the marvelous intelligence\r\ndisplayed by ants and termites, those mites of animated nature which so\r\nexcited the admiration of the naturalist Pliny and caused Darwin to\r\ndeclare, \"The brain of an ant is one of the most marvelous atoms of\r\nmatter in the world, perhaps more so than the brain of man.\"[99]\r\n\r\nMoreover, when discussing the relative brain weights of the two sexes,\r\nwe must not lose sight of the fact that we have, with the solitary\r\nexception of the eminent Russian mathematician, Sonya Kovalevsky,[100]\r\nno record of the brain weights of any eminently intellectual woman. The\r\nbrains of scores of men of genius and exceptional mentality have been\r\nweighed, but we are utterly ignorant of the weight of brain of such\r\nwomen as Maria Gaetana Agnesi, Madame de Stael, Maria Theresa, Sophie\r\nGermain, George Sand, Harriet Martineau, George Eliot, Eleanor Ormerod,\r\nMary Somerville, and others of the same caliber. The only data so far\r\navailable, regarding the average brain weight of women, are such as have\r\nbeen obtained from the inmates of hospitals, prisons and pauper\r\ninstitutions. And yet we are asked to accept the average based on such\r\ndata as a fair term of comparison with the average male brain weight as\r\nincreased by the superior weight of brain of such men as Cuvier and\r\nTurgenieff. And this is called science![101]\r\n\r\nThe attempt, then, to prove by weighing and measuring and studying\r\nbrains that man is the intellectual superior of woman has been an\r\nignominious failure. The old belief that woman is by nature and cerebral\r\norganization less intelligent than man is not borne out by the\r\ninvestigations of those best qualified to pronounce an opinion on the\r\nsubject. To assert, as so many do, that woman was created man's\r\nintellectual inferior is begging the question. Science can adduce no\r\nproof of such a gratuitous statement. Broca, the most eminent of French\r\nanthropologists, regarded as an absurdity the attempt to establish a\r\nnecessary relation between the development of intelligence and the\r\nvolume and weight of the encephalon. With the ripe knowledge of his\r\nmature years he was inclined to believe that the apparent difference in\r\nintelligence in the two sexes was owing, not to a difference of brain\r\norganization, but rather to a difference of education, physical as well\r\nas mental, and that, with equal opportunities for intellectual and\r\nphysical development, the present sexual differences that we have been\r\nconsidering--differences which are due not to nature but to the long\r\nages of restraint and subjection under which women have lived--would\r\ngradually be lessened, and that men and women would eventually approach\r\nthat equality which characterizes them in the state of nature.[102]\r\n\r\nRealizing the impossibility of arriving, by the study of brain sizes and\r\nstructure, at any satisfactory conclusion respecting the relative\r\nintellectual capacities of men and women, seekers after truth cast about\r\nfor other methods that were free from the errors and fallacies of those\r\nwhich had proved so unreliable. The attempt to base the alleged mental\r\ninferiority of woman upon the facial angle of Camper, the metafacial\r\nangle of Serres, the craniofacial angle of Huxley, the sphenoidal angle\r\nof Welcker, or the nasobasal angle of Virchow had issued in utter\r\nfailure, and had proved for the thousandth time that it is easier to\r\nformulate theories than to establish their validity. It was evident,\r\nnotwithstanding the assertions of certain materialistic theorists, that\r\nthe brain did not secrete thought as the liver secretes bile; it was\r\nevident, too, that intelligence could not be estimated in terms of any\r\nkind of mechanical units. Psycho-physiologists had no sort of\r\ndynamometer for measuring brain power as they would measure muscular\r\nenergy. By means of the plethysmograph they might determine the amount\r\nof blood sent to the brain in a given time, but they had no psychometer\r\nof any description which would enable them to estimate the quantity,\r\nmuch less the quality, of psychic force such a blood supply was\r\ncompetent to produce.\r\n\r\nMany, of course, still remained adherents of the old view that woman\r\nmust ever remain the mental inferior of man because she is by nature\r\nphysically weaker. These persons, however, seemed to lose sight of the\r\nfact that women who lead a rational life--who are not the slaves of\r\nfashion or the victims of luxury--have little to complain of on the\r\nscore of physical weakness. This is evidenced by the life and habits of\r\nthe women of the people, as well as by the tasks performed by women\r\namong savage tribes, who in health and strength are little, if at all,\r\ninferior to their male companions.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Huxley, in referring to this subject, exhibited his\r\nusual acumen and sanity in such matters when he indited the following\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\"We have heard a great deal lately about the physical disabilities of\r\nwomen. Some of these alleged impediments, no doubt, are really inherent\r\nin their organization, but nine-tenths of them are artificial--the\r\nproducts of their mode of life. I believe that nothing would tend so\r\neffectually to get rid of these creations of idleness, weariness and\r\nthat 'over-stimulation of the emotions' which in plainer spoken days\r\nused to be called wantonness, than a fair share of healthy work,\r\ndirected toward a definite object, combined with an equally fair share\r\nof healthy play, during the years of adolescence; and those who are best\r\nacquainted with the acquirements of an average medical practitioner will\r\nfind it hardest to believe that the attempt to reach that standard is\r\nlike to prove exhausting to an ordinarily intelligent and well-educated\r\nwoman.\"[103]\r\n\r\nSubstantially the same views are held by Mrs. Henry Fawcett and Dr. Mary\r\nPutnam Jacobi, whose rare experience and knowledge give their opinions\r\non the subject under consideration special weight and value.\r\n\r\nAfter men of science had tried the various theories above enumerated and\r\nfound them wanting, they finally bethought themselves of investigating\r\nthe relative intellectual standing of male and female students in\r\ncoeducational institutions, and inquiring into their comparative\r\ncapacity for different branches of knowledge, as made known by their\r\nprofessors and by the results of oral and written examinations.\r\nConsidering the simplicity of this method and the fact that it is the\r\nmore rational way to reach reliable conclusions, the wonder is that it\r\nwas not thought of sooner. It excludes the bias of prepossessions and\r\npreconceived theories and lends itself to the discussion of results\r\nbased on incontestable facts.\r\n\r\nThe first coeducational institution in which the intellectual capacity\r\nof women, in competition with men, was fairly tested was, strange to\r\nsay, in the Royal College of Science for Ireland. This was somewhat more\r\nthan half a century ago. When the time of examinations came, both the\r\nmen and women students were handed the same examination papers. At the\r\npublic distribution of prizes, at the close of the session, \"the\r\nladies,\" in the words of a Dublin paper, \"vindicated the genius of their\r\nsex by carrying off the highest prizes.\" In zoology, botany, physics,\r\nchemistry and mathematics they proved themselves the peers, and\r\nfrequently the superiors, of their male competitors.\r\n\r\n\"The success of the female students disturbed, of course, very much the\r\npreconceived notions of some people, who had always taken for granted\r\nthat the female intellect was inferior to the male; and, not being able\r\nto combat the stubborn facts that appeared from time to time in the\r\nnewspapers, when the results of the examinations were published, they\r\ntried to account for them.\"[104]\r\n\r\nThese cavillers, however, soon discovered that there was no way of\r\naccounting for the disconcerting fact which confronted them, except by\r\nconfessing that their theory regarding the mental inferiority of women\r\nwas not substantiated by fact. This unexpected demand for the\r\nunconditional surrender of their long-cherished theory of male\r\nsuperiority was a crushing and humiliating blow to their pride of\r\nintellect, but there was no remedy for it, nor was it accompanied by any\r\nbalm of consolation that they, at the time, felt disposed to regard as\r\nadequate compensation for their lost prestige--a prestige which their\r\noverweening sex had claimed from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nSimilar experiments under even more trying conditions were subsequently\r\nmade in the United States and in other parts of the world, and\r\neverywhere with the same results. In the universities of Switzerland,\r\nFrance, England, Germany and Russia women, when given a fair\r\nopportunity, were able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of all\r\nunprejudiced judges that the long-vaunted superiority of the male\r\nintellect was a myth; that intelligence, like genius, has no sex.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and comprehensive investigations ever\r\nundertaken regarding this long-debated question was made some years ago\r\nby Arthur Kirchhoff, an enterprising German journalist.[105] It\r\nconsisted in collecting and collaborating the opinions of more than a\r\nhundred of the most distinguished professors of the Fatherland, besides\r\nthe opinions of a number of eminent writers and teachers in girls' high\r\nschools. These constitute a volume of nearly four hundred pages, and\r\nembody the views on the capacity of woman for science of professors of\r\ntheology, jurisprudence, anatomy, physiology, surgery, psychology,\r\nhistory, gynecology, psychiatry, philology, philosophy, art,\r\nmathematics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, zoology, botany, geology,\r\npaleontology and technology. The investigation, indeed, covered every\r\nbranch of knowledge and evoked the deliberate views of those who were\r\nlooked upon as the leading representatives of German thought and\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThis book possesses a special value from the fact that, of all peoples\r\nin Europe, the Germans have been the most refractory to the claims of\r\nwomen to be received at the universities on the same footing as men. The\r\nGerman professors, naturally, share the conservatism of their\r\ncountrymen, and, like them, are wedded to routine when there is question\r\nof introducing innovations into their social, political or educational\r\nsystems. One would anticipate, then, that, when called upon to give\r\ntheir honest opinions respecting the intellectual capacity of women, as\r\ncompared with that of men, their answer would be decidedly in favor of\r\nthe sterner sex. \"For,\" they will ask, \"have not all the achievements in\r\nscience which have given the Fatherland such prestige in the eyes of the\r\nworld been due entirely to men? Have the women of Germany ever\r\nundertaken the solution of any great scientific problem, or have they\r\never made any notable contribution to scientific advancement? They have\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding all these facts, notwithstanding all traditions and\r\nprejudices and social bias, the unexpected has happened, even in\r\nconservative, old-fashioned Germany. The German professor may be\r\ntenacious of preconceived views; he may be a stickler for ancient\r\ncustoms and usages; nevertheless, when he is called upon to give a\r\nquestion a categorical answer which can be arrived at by observation or\r\nexperiment, he may generally, in spite of his likes or dislikes, be\r\ncounted on to give a decision in accord with the principles of\r\nlegitimate induction. He may have his prejudices--and who has not?--but,\r\nwhen one appeals to him in the name of science and justice, he will\r\nrarely be found wanting. Regardless of all personal consideration, he\r\nwill feel that loyalty to science, of which he is the avowed devotee,\r\nrequires him to consider a question proposed to him as he would a\r\nscientific problem--something to be decided solely by such evidence as\r\nmay be available.\r\n\r\nTo the exceeding gratification of the believers in the intellectual\r\nequality of the sexes, this proved to be the case in Herr Kirchhoff's\r\ninvestigation. The answers of the German professors, contrary to what\r\nmost people would have anticipated, were, by a surprising majority, in\r\nfavor of women. But their answers were in keeping with the changed\r\neducational conditions in Germany, as well as in other parts of the\r\ncivilized world. Had Herr Kirchhoff undertaken his investigation a few\r\ndecades earlier, the result would undoubtedly have been different, for\r\nwomen were then excluded from the universities and the professors had\r\nnot had an opportunity of accurately testing their intellectual\r\ncapacities. But having, during the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, had them as students in their lecture halls and laboratories,\r\nwhere they were able to study their mental powers and determine the\r\nvalue of their work by strict scientific methods, they were in a better\r\nposition to express an opinion on the question at issue than would, a\r\nfew years previously, have been possible.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, even the declared enemies of the woman's movement among the\r\nGerman professorate were forced to admit the intellectual equality of\r\nthe two sexes. For they, too, as well as men of science in other parts\r\nof Europe, had been measuring skulls and weighing brains; they, too, had\r\nbeen studying woman's mental caliber in the light of the new psychology;\r\nthey, too, had been watching her work in the various departments of the\r\nuniversity; and, notwithstanding all their observations and experiments,\r\nthey were unable to detect any difference between men and women in brain\r\norganization or in intellectual capacity. And, as might have been\r\nforeseen, results harmonized perfectly with those arrived at by\r\ninvestigators in other parts of the world--namely, that in things of the\r\nmind there is perfect sexual equality.\r\n\r\nAmong the hundred and more professors whose opinions are given in Herr\r\nKirchhoff's book there were, of course, a few who were not prepared to\r\nsubscribe to the findings of the great majority of their colleagues. But\r\nthe reasons they assign for dissent were, at least in some instances,\r\nlittle better founded than that of a certain professor of chemistry in\r\nthe University of Geneva, who, a few years ago, gravely declared that\r\nwomen have no aptitude for science because, forsooth, in chemical\r\nmanipulations they break more test-tubes than men. Verily, \"a Daniel\r\ncome to judgment.\"\r\n\r\nWhat probably more deeply impressed the German professors than anything\r\nelse was the marked talent and taste of many of the women students for\r\nthe abstract sciences, especially for the higher mathematics. For it had\r\nalways been asserted that these branches of knowledge were beyond\r\nwoman's capacity and that she had an instinctive antipathy for abstruse\r\nreasoning and for abstractions of all kinds. When, however, they\r\ndiscovered women whose delight was to discuss the theory of elliptic\r\nfunctions or curves defined by differential equations; when they found a\r\nmathematical genius like Sonya Kovalevsky speculating on the fourth\r\ndimension, and carrying away from the mathematicians of the world the\r\nmost coveted prize of the French Academy of Sciences, they were forced\r\nto confess that another of their illusions was dissipated, and to\r\nacknowledge that they had no longer anything on which to base their long\r\nand fondly cherished opinion of the mental inequality of the sexes.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the extraordinary change that had been effected among\r\nthe conservative Germans in the course of a few years respecting their\r\nattitude toward the admission of the \"Academic Woman\" to the\r\nuniversities, and, consequently, toward her intellectual capacity, it\r\nwill suffice to reproduce a sentence from the elaborately expressed\r\nopinion of Dr. Julius Bernstein, professor of physiology in the\r\nUniversity of Halle. \"After reflection on the subject,\" he declares, \"I\r\nam convinced that neither God nor religion, neither custom nor law, and\r\nstill less science, warrants one in maintaining any essential difference\r\nin this respect between the male and the female sex.\"[106]\r\n\r\nThe controversy of centuries regarding woman's intellectual capacity was\r\nnow virtually settled beyond all peradventure. Woman had conquered, and\r\nher final victory had been won in the heart of the enemy's country, yea,\r\neven in what was thought to be the impregnable fortress of her\r\nrelentless foes. It was achieved where the proud Teuton male had\r\nimagined that he was unapproachable and beyond compare--in the\r\nlaboratories and lecture rooms of his great universities--more\r\nirresistible, in his estimation, than the Kaiser's trained legions in\r\nbattle array.\r\n\r\nIt finally dawned upon the leaders of thought in the Fatherland, as it\r\nhad but shortly before dawned upon philosophers and men of science in\r\nother lands, that the reputed sexual difference in intelligence was not\r\ndue to difference in brain size or brain structure, or innate power of\r\nintellect, but rather to some other factors which had been neglected, or\r\noverlooked, as being unessential or of minor importance. These factors,\r\non further investigation, proved to be education and opportunity.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1869 that keen observer and philosopher, John Stuart\r\nMill, had expressed himself on the subject in the following words: \"Like\r\nthe French compared with the English, the Irish with the Swiss, the\r\nGreeks or Italians compared with the German races, so women compared\r\nwith men may be found, on the average, to do the same things with some\r\nvariety in the particular kind of excellence. But that they would do\r\nthem fully as well, on the whole, if their education and cultivation\r\nwere adapted to correcting instead of aggravating the infirmities\r\nincident to their temperament, I see not the smallest reason to\r\ndoubt.\"[107]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a better illustration of the sluggishness\r\nof the male as compared with the female mind than the tardiness of men\r\nof science in arriving at a sane conclusion respecting the subject of\r\nthis chapter. For five hundred years ago Christine de Pisan arrived at\r\nthe same conclusion which the learned professors of Germany reached only\r\nin the last decade of the nineteenth century. Discussing in _La Cite des\r\nDames_ the question at issue she writes as follows: \"I say to thee\r\nagain, and doubt never the contrary, that if it were the custom to put\r\nthe little maidens to the school, and they were made to learn the\r\nsciences as they do to the men-children, that they should learn as\r\nperfectly, and they should be as well entered into the subtleties of all\r\nthe arts and sciences as men be. And peradventure, there should be more\r\nof them, for I have teached heretofore that by how much women have the\r\nbody more soft than the men have, and less able to do divers things, by\r\nso much they have the understanding more sharp there as they apply it.\"\r\n\r\nChristine de Pisan's statement is virtually a challenge demanding the\r\nsame educational opportunities for women as were accorded to men. But it\r\nwas a challenge that men did not see fit to accept until full five\r\ncenturies had elapsed, and until it was no longer possible to deny\r\ngiving satisfaction to the long-aggrieved half of humanity. It was also\r\nan appeal to experiment and an appeal, likewise, to the teachings of\r\nhistory in lands where women have enjoyed the same educational\r\nadvantages as men.\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed the many disabilities which so long retarded woman's\r\nintellectual advancement, and considered some of the objections which\r\nwere urged against her capacity for scientific pursuits, we are now\r\nprepared to consider the appeal of Christine de Pisan and deal with it\r\non its merits. This we shall do by a brief survey of woman's\r\nachievements in the various branches of science in which she has been\r\naccorded the same intellectual opportunities that were so long the\r\nexclusive privilege of her male compeer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] An edition of this work, based on an old manuscript in La\r\nBibliotheque Nationale of Paris, in French, is announced to appear in\r\nFrance at an early date.

Women, it was averred, could readily assimilate what is\r\nconcrete, but, like children, they have a natural repugnance for\r\neverything which is abstract. They are competent to discuss details and\r\nto deal with particulars, but become hopelessly lost when they attempt\r\nto generalize or deal with universals.\r\n\r\nDe Lamennais shares Kant's opinion concerning woman's intellectual\r\ninferiority and does not hesitate to express himself on the subject in\r\nthe most unequivocal manner. \"I have never,\" he writes, \"met a woman who\r\nwas competent to follow a course of reasoning the half of a quarter of\r\nan hour--_un demi quart d'heure_. She has qualities which are wanting in\r\nus, qualities of a particular, inexpressible charm; but, in the matter\r\nof reason, logic, the power to connect ideas, to enchain principles of\r\nknowledge and perceive their relationships, woman, even the most highly\r\ngifted, rarely attains to the height of a man of mediocre capacity.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in the past that such views found acceptance. They\r\nprevail even to-day to almost the same extent as during the ages of\r\nlong ago. How far they have any foundation in fact can best be\r\ndetermined by a brief survey of what woman has achieved in the domain of\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nAthenaeus, a Greek writer who flourished about A.D. 200, tells us in his\r\n_Deipnosophistae_ of several Greek women who excelled in mathematics, as\r\nwell as philosophy, but details are wanting as to their attainments in\r\nthis branch of knowledge. If, however, we may judge from the number of\r\nwomen--particularly among the hetaerae--who became eminent in the various\r\nschools of philosophy, especially during the pre-Christian era, we must\r\nconclude that many of them were well versed in geometry and astronomy as\r\nwell as in the general science of numbers. Menagius declares that he\r\nfound no fewer than sixty-five women philosophers mentioned in the\r\nwritings of the ancients[108]; and, judging from what we know of the\r\ncharacter of the studies pursued in certain of the philosophical\r\nschools, especially those of Plato[109] and Pythagoras, and the\r\nenthusiasm which women manifested in every department of knowledge,\r\nthere can be no doubt that they achieved the same measure of success in\r\nmathematics as in philosophy and literature.[110]\r\n\r\nThe first woman mathematician, regarding whose attainments we have any\r\npositive knowledge, is the celebrated Hypatia, a Neo-platonic\r\nphilosopher, whose unhappy fate at the hands of an Alexandrian mob in\r\nthe early part of the fifth century has given rise to many legends and\r\nromances which have contributed not a little toward obscuring the real\r\nfacts of her extraordinary career. She was the daughter of Theon, who\r\nwas distinguished as a mathematician and astronomer and as a professor\r\nin the school of Alexandria, which was then probably the greatest seat\r\nof learning in the world. Born about the year 375 A. D., she at an early\r\nage evinced the possession of those talents that were subsequently to\r\nrender her so illustrious. So great indeed was her genius and so rapid\r\nwas her progress in this branch of knowledge under the tuition of her\r\nfather that she soon completely eclipsed her master in his chosen\r\nspecialty.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe--although the fact is not definitely\r\nestablished--that she studied for a while in Athens in the school of\r\nphilosophy conducted by Plutarch the Younger and his daughter\r\nAsclepigenia. After her return from Athens, Hypatia was invited by the\r\nmagistrates of Alexandria to teach mathematics and philosophy. Here in\r\nbrief time her lecture room was filled by eager and enthusiastic\r\nstudents from all parts of the civilized world. She was also gifted with\r\na high order of eloquence and with a voice so marvelous that it was\r\ndeclared to be \"divine.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding her much vaunted beauty, nothing certain is known, as\r\nantiquity has bequeathed to us no medal or statue by which we could form\r\nan estimate of her physical grace. But, be this as it may, it is certain\r\nthat she commanded the admiration and respect of all for her great\r\nlearning, and that she bore the mantle of science and philosophy with so\r\ngreat modesty and self-confidence that she won all hearts. A letter\r\naddressed to \"The Muse,\" or to \"The Philosopher\"--[Greek: Te\r\nPhilosopho]--was sure to be delivered to her at once. Small wonder,\r\nthen, to find a Greek poet inditing to her an epigram containing the\r\nfollowing sentiment:\r\n\r\n\"When I see thee and hear thy word I thee adore; it is the ethereal\r\nconstellation of the Virgin, which I contemplate, for to the heavens thy\r\nwhole life is devoted, O august Hypatia, ideal of eloquence and\r\nwisdom's immaculate star.\"[111]\r\n\r\nBut it was as a mathematician that Hypatia most excelled. She taught not\r\nonly geometry and astronomy, but also the new science of algebra, which\r\nhad but a short time before been introduced by Diophantus. And, singular\r\nto relate, no further progress was made in the mathematical sciences, as\r\ntaught by Hypatia, until the time of Newton, Leibnitz and\r\nDescartes,--more than twelve centuries later.\r\n\r\nHypatia was the author of three works on mathematics, all of which have\r\nbeen lost, or destroyed by the ravages of time. One of these was a\r\ncommentary on the _Arithmetica_ of Diophantus. The original treatise--or\r\nrather the part which has come down to us--was found about the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century in the Vatican Library, whither it had probably\r\nbeen brought after Constantinople had fallen into the possession of the\r\nTurks. This valuable work, as annotated by the great French\r\nmathematicians Bachet and Fermat, gives us a good idea of the extent of\r\nHypatia's attainments as a mathematician.\r\n\r\nAnother of Hypatia's works was a treatise on the _Conic Sections_ by\r\nApollonius of Perga--surnamed \"The Great Geometer.\" Next to Archimedes,\r\nhe was the most distinguished of the Greek geometricians; and the last\r\nfour books of his conics constitute the chief portions of the higher\r\ngeometry of the ancients. Moreover, they offer some elegant geometrical\r\nsolutions of problems which, with all the resources of our modern\r\nanalytical method, are not without difficulty. The greater part of this\r\nprecious work has been preserved and has engaged the attention of\r\nseveral of the most illustrious of modern mathematicians--among them\r\nBorelli, Viviani, Fermat, Barrow and others. The famous English\r\nastronomer, Halley, regarded this production of Apollonius of such\r\nimportance that he learned Arabic for the express purpose of translating\r\nit from the version that had been made into this language.\r\n\r\nA woman who could achieve distinction by her commentaries on such works\r\nas the _Arithmetica_ of Diophantus, of the _Conic Sections_ of\r\nApollonius, and occupy an honored place among such mathematicians as\r\nFermat, Borelli, and Halley, must have had a genius for mathematics, and\r\nwe can well believe that the glowing tributes paid by her contemporaries\r\nto her extraordinary powers of intellect were fully deserved. If, with\r\nPascal, we see in mathematics \"the highest exercise of the\r\nintelligence,\" and agree with him in placing geometers in the first rank\r\nof intellectual princes--_princes de l'esprit_--we must admit that\r\nHypatia was indeed exceptionally dowered by Him whom Plato calls \"The\r\nGreat Geometer.\"\r\n\r\nThere is still a third work of this ill-fated woman that deserves\r\nnotice--namely, her _Astronomical Canon_, which dealt with the movements\r\nof the heavenly bodies. It is the general opinion that this was but a\r\ncommentary on the tables of Ptolemy, in which event it is still possible\r\nthat it may be found incorporated in the work of her father, Theon, on\r\nthe same subject.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her works on astronomy and mathematics, Hypatia is\r\ncredited with several inventions of importance, some of which are still\r\nin daily use. Among these are an apparatus for distilling water, another\r\nfor measuring the level of water, and a third an instrument for\r\ndetermining the specific gravity of liquids--what we should now call an\r\nareometer. Besides these apparatus, she was likewise the inventor of an\r\nastrolabe and a planisphere.\r\n\r\nOne of her most distinguished pupils was the eminent Neo-platonist\r\nphilosopher, Synesius, who became the Bishop of Ptolemais in the\r\nPentapolis of Libya. His letters constitute our chief source of\r\ninformation respecting this remarkable woman. Seven of them are\r\naddressed to her, and in four others he makes mention of her. In one of\r\nthem he writes: \"We have seen and we have heard her who presides at the\r\nsacred mysteries of philosophy.\" In another he apostrophizes her as \"My\r\nbenefactress, my teacher,--_magistra_--my sister, my mother.\"\r\n\r\nIn science Hypatia was among the women of antiquity what Sappho was in\r\npoetry and what Aspasia was in philosophy and eloquence--the chiefest\r\nglory of her sex. In profundity of knowledge and variety of attainments\r\nshe had few peers among her contemporaries, and she is entitled to a\r\nconspicuous place among such luminaries of science as Ptolemy, Euclid,\r\nApollonius, Diophantus and Hipparchus.[112]\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret to the admirers of this favored daughter of the\r\nMuses that she is absent from Raphael's _School of Athens_; but, had her\r\nachievements been as well known and appreciated in his day as they are\r\nnow, we can readily believe that the incomparable artist would have\r\nfound a place for her in this masterpiece with the matchless form and\r\nfeatures of his beloved Fornarina.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Hypatia the science of mathematics remained\r\nstationary for many long centuries. Outside of certain Moors in Spain,\r\nthe only mathematicians of note in Europe, until the Renaissance, were\r\nGerbert, afterward Pope Silvester II, and Leonardo da Pisa. The first\r\nwoman to attract special attention for her knowledge of mathematics was\r\nHeloise, the noted pupil of Abelard. According to Franciscus Ambrosius,\r\nwho edited the works of Abelard and Heloise in 1616, the famous prioress\r\nof The Paraclete was a prodigy of learning, for besides having a\r\nknowledge of Latin, Greek and Hebrew, which was something extremely rare\r\nin her time, she was also well versed in philosophy, theology and\r\nmathematics, and inferior in these branches only to Abelard himself, who\r\nwas probably the most eminent scholar of his age.[113]\r\n\r\nMany Italian women, as we have seen in a preceding chapter, were noted\r\nfor their proficiency in the various branches of mathematics. Some of\r\nthe most distinguished of them flourished during the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. Among these were Elena Cornaro Piscopia,\r\ncelebrated as a linguist as well as a mathematician; Maria Angela\r\nArdinghelli, translator of the _Vegetable Statics_ of Stephen Hales;\r\nCristina Roccati, who taught physics for twenty-seven years in the\r\nScientific Institute of Rovigo, and Clelia Borromeo, fondly called by\r\nher countrymen _gloria Genuensium_--the glory of the Genoese. In\r\naddition to a special talent for languages, she possessed so great a\r\ncapacity for mathematics and mechanics that no problem in these sciences\r\nseemed to be beyond her comprehension.[114] Then there was also Diamante\r\nMedaglia, a mathematician of note, who wrote a special dissertation on\r\nthe importance of mathematics in the curriculum of studies for women,\r\n_Alle matematiche, alle matematiche prestino l'opera loro le donne, onde\r\nnon cadano in crassi paralogismi_--\"To mathematics, to mathematics,\"\r\nshe cries, \"let women devote attention for mental discipline.\"[115]\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious, by far, of the women mathematicians of Italy was\r\nMaria Gaetana Agnesi, who was born in Milan in 1718 and died there at\r\nthe age of eighty-one. At an early age she exhibited rare intelligence\r\nand soon distinguished herself by her extraordinary talent for\r\nlanguages. At the age of five she spoke French with ease and\r\ncorrectness, while only six years later she was able to translate Greek\r\ninto Latin at sight and to speak the former as fluently as her own\r\nItalian. At the early age of nine she startled the learned men and women\r\nof her native city by discoursing for an hour in Latin on the rights of\r\nwomen to the study of science. This discourse--_Oratio_--was not, as\r\nusually stated, her own composition, but a translation from the Italian\r\nof a discourse written by her teacher of Latin. That a child of nine\r\nyears should speak in the language of Cicero for a full hour before a\r\nlearned assembly and without once losing the thread of her discourse\r\nwas, indeed, a wonderful performance, and we are not surprised to learn\r\nthat she was regarded by her countrymen as an infant prodigy.[116]\r\n\r\nIn addition to Italian, French, Latin and Greek, she was acquainted with\r\nGerman, Spanish and Hebrew. For this reason she was, like Elena Cornaro\r\nPiscopia, the famous \"Venetian Minerva,\" called Oracolo\r\nSettilingue--Oracle of Seven Languages.[117]\r\n\r\nBut it was in the higher mathematics that Maria Gaetana was to win her\r\nchief title to fame in the world of learning. So successful had she been\r\nin her prosecution of this branch of science that she was, at the early\r\nage of twenty, able to enter upon her monumental work--_Le Instituzioni\r\nAnalitiche_--a treatise in two large quarto volumes on the differential\r\nand integral calculus. To this difficult task she devoted ten years of\r\narduous and uninterrupted labor. And if we may credit her biographer,\r\nshe consecrated the nights as well as the days to her herculean\r\nundertaking. For frequently, after working in vain on a difficult\r\nproblem during the day, she was known to bound from her bed during the\r\nnight while sound asleep and, like a somnambulist, make her way through\r\na long suite of rooms to her study, where she wrote out the solution of\r\nthe problem and then returned to her bed. The following morning, on\r\nreturning to her desk, she found, to her great surprise, that while\r\nasleep she had fully solved the problem which had been the subject of\r\nher meditations during the day and of her dreams during the night. Could\r\nthe psychiatrist who so loves to deal with obscure mental phenomena find\r\na more interesting case to engage his attention or one more worthy of\r\nthe most careful investigation?\r\n\r\nFinally Maria Gaetana's _opus majus_ was completed and given to the\r\npublic. It would be impossible to describe the sensation it produced in\r\nthe learned world. Everybody talked about it; everybody admired the\r\nprofound learning of the author, and acclaimed her: \"Il portento del\r\nsesso, unico al Mondo\"--the portent of her sex, unique in the world. By\r\na single effort of her genius she had completely demolished that fabric\r\nof false reasoning which had so long been appealed to as proof positive\r\nof woman's intellectual inferiority, especially in the domain of\r\nabstract science. Maria Gaetana's victory was complete, and her victory\r\nwas likewise a victory for her sex. She had demonstrated once for all,\r\nand beyond a quirk or quibble, that women could attain to the highest\r\neminence in mathematics as well as in literature, that supreme\r\nexcellence in any department of knowledge was not a question of sex but\r\na question of education and opportunity, and that in things of the mind\r\nthere was essentially no difference between the male and the female\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nThe world saw in Agnesi a worthy accession to that noble band of gifted\r\nwomen who count among their number a Sappho, a Corinna, an Aspasia, a\r\nHypatia, a Paula, a Hroswitha, a Dacier, an Isabella Rosales who, in the\r\nsixteenth century, successfully defended the most difficult theological\r\ntheses in the presence of Paul III and the entire college of cardinals.\r\nAnd so delighted were the women--especially those in Italy--with the\r\nsignal triumph of their eminent sister that they defied the traducers\r\nof their sex--_muliebris sapientiae infensissimis hostibus_--to continue\r\nany longer their unreasonable campaign against the rights of women which\r\nwere based on the intellectual equality of the two sexes.\r\n\r\nSo highly did the French Academy of Science value Agnesi's achievement\r\nthat she would at once have been made a member of this learned body had\r\nit not been against the constitutions to admit a woman to membership. M.\r\nMotigny, one of the committee appointed by the Academy to report on the\r\nwork, in his letter to the author, among other things, writes: \"Permit\r\nme, Mademoiselle, to unite my personal homage to the plaudits of the\r\nentire Academy. I have the pleasure of making known to my country an\r\nextremely useful work which has long been desired, and which has\r\nhitherto\"--both in France and in England--\"existed only in outline. I do\r\nnot know any work of this kind which is clearer, more methodic or more\r\ncomprehensive than your _Analytical Institutions_. There is none in any\r\nlanguage which can guide more surely, lead more quickly, and conduct\r\nfurther those who wish to advance in the mathematical sciences. I admire\r\nparticularly the art with which you bring under uniform methods the\r\ndivers conclusions scattered among the works of geometers and reached by\r\nmethods entirely different.\"\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the exceptional merit of Agnesi's work, even long\r\nafter its publication in 1748, it suffices to state that the second\r\nvolume of the_ Instituzioni Analitiche_ was translated into French in\r\n1775 by Antelmy and annotated by the Abbe Bossuet, a member of the\r\nFrench Academy and a collaborator of D'Alembert on the mathematical part\r\nof the famous _Encyclopedie_.\r\n\r\nA still greater proof of the estimation in which Agnesi's work was held\r\nby men of science is the fact that it was translated in its entirety\r\ninto English by the Rev. John Colton, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics\r\nin the University of Cambridge, and published in 1801, fifty-two years\r\nafter it had appeared in Italian. His impression of the methods followed\r\nby the Milanese _savante_ was so favorable that, in the words of a\r\ncontemporary writer, it \"gave rise to his very spirited resolution of\r\nlearning a new language at an advanced period of life, that he might\r\nmake himself perfect master of them.\"[118]\r\n\r\nGratifying, however, as were the tributes of admiration and appreciation\r\nwhich came to Agnesi from all quarters, from learned societies, from\r\neminent mathematicians, from sovereigns--the Empress Maria Theresa sent\r\nher a splendid diamond ring and a precious crystal casket bejeweled with\r\ndiamonds--that which touched her most deeply was, undoubtedly, the\r\nrecognition which she received from the great Maecenas of his age, Pope\r\nBenedict XIV. As Cardinal Lambertini and Archbishop of Bologna, he had\r\ntaken a conspicuous part in the honors showered on Laura Bassi when she\r\nreceived her doctorate, and was specially delighted when she was made\r\nprofessor of physics in his favored university. Being himself familiar\r\nwith the higher mathematics, he recognized at once the exceptional merit\r\nof Maria Gaetana's work and showed his appreciation of it not only by\r\nletters and presents, but also by having her, _motu proprio_, appointed\r\nby the Bolognese senate as professor of higher mathematics in the\r\nUniversity of Bologna.\r\n\r\nIn advising her of this appointment, he writes her that he had in view\r\nthe honor of the University in which he had always taken a special\r\ninterest, and that the appointment carried with it no obligation of\r\nthanks on her part but rather on his--_che porta seco ch'ella non deve\r\nringraziar Noi, ma che Noi dobbiamo ringraziar lei_. The interest that\r\nthis wise and broad-minded pontiff exhibited in the advancement of\r\nlearned women and the rewards he was ever ready to accord to their\r\nachievements in science and literature--especially in the cases of Laura\r\nBassi and Maria Gaetana Agnesi--is in keeping with the policy pursued by\r\nhis predecessors, and accounts in great measure for that large number of\r\nlearned women in Italy who, since the opening of the first universities,\r\nhave been the glory of their sex and country.\r\n\r\nBut ardent as was the desire of the Supreme Pontiff to have Agnesi\r\noccupy the chair of mathematics, and numerous as were the appeals of her\r\nfriends and the members of the university faculty to have her accept the\r\nappointment that carried with it such signal honor, she could never be\r\ninduced to leave her beloved Milan. For, after completing her\r\nmasterpiece, she resolved to retire from the world and devote the rest\r\nof her life to the care of the poor, the sick and the helpless in her\r\nnative city. She did not, however, as is so frequently asserted, enter\r\nthe convent and become a nun.[119] During many years after her\r\nretirement from the world, she lived in her own home, a part of which\r\nshe had converted into a hospital. During the last fifteen years of her\r\nlife she had charge of the Pio Albergo Trivulzio--a large institution\r\nfounded by Prince Trivulzio for the aged poor who were without home or\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nShe had devoted ten years of the flower of her life to the writing of\r\nher _Instituzioni Analitiche_--prepared primarily for the benefit of one\r\nof her brothers who had a taste for mathematics--and, after it was\r\nfinished, she entered upon that long career of heroic charity which was\r\nterminated only at her death at the advanced age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\nOne loves to speculate regarding Maria Gaetana's possible achievements\r\nif she had continued during the rest of her life that science in which,\r\nduring a few short years, she had won such distinction. She had made her\r\nown the discoveries of Newton, Leibnitz, Roberval, Fermat, Descartes,\r\nRiccati, Euler, the brothers Bernouilli, and had mastered the entire\r\nscience of mathematics then known. Her pinions were trimmed for essaying\r\nloftier flights than any hitherto attempted, and her intellect was\r\nprepared, as one of her scientific friends expressed it, \"for fixing the\r\nlimits of the infinite.\" But while the world of science was still\r\nsounding her praises and predicting for her still greater triumphs in\r\nthe field of analysis, it learned with surprise and sorrow that she had\r\nbid adieu to those studies in which she had achieved such extraordinary\r\nsuccess, and had consecrated her life to the service of the poor and the\r\nafflicted. She disappeared completely from those literary and scientific\r\nreunions where she had so long been the most conspicuous figure, and was\r\nthenceforth known only as the ministering angel of the suffering and the\r\nabandoned. For half a century hers was a life of the most heroic charity\r\nand self-abnegation. Very readily, therefore, we can understand why a\r\nrecent representative of the scientific world should desire to see her\r\nname placed on the calendar of saints.[120]\r\n\r\nHad Agnesi devoted her entire life to science instead of abandoning it\r\njust when she was prepared to do her best work, she might to-day be\r\nranked among such supreme mathematicians as Lagrange, Monge, Laplace and\r\nthe Bernouillis, all of whom were her contemporaries. Even as it was,\r\nshe has been placed beside Cardan, Leibnitz and Euler for her remarkable\r\npowers of analysis of infinitesimals, while the best proof of the\r\nliterary value of her _Instituzioni Analitiche_ is the fact that it has\r\nbeen selected by the famous society Della Crusca as a _testo di\r\nlingua_--a work considered as a classic of its kind and used in the\r\npreparation of the great authoritative dictionary of the Italian\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nBut by consecrating herself to charity she probably accomplished far\r\nmore for humanity and for the well-being of her sex than if she had\r\nelected to continue her work in the higher mathematics. There had been\r\nmany learned women in Italy before her time and many since; many who\r\nwere distinguished as Hellenists, as Latinists, as polyglots, as\r\nmathematicians--women like the Roccati, the Borghini, the Brassi, the\r\nArdinghelli, the Barbapiccola, the Caminer Turra, the Tambroni; but\r\nMaria Gaetana Agnesi surpasses them all, not only in knowledge, but as a\r\npotent influence for the diffusion of culture and the spirit of\r\nbrotherhood, for the expansion of benevolence and charity, and, above\r\nall, for the elevation of woman. She was also, as her latest and best\r\nbiographer beautifully expresses it, \"an inspired _condottiera_ who, in\r\nthe field of civility, anticipated the conquests of these latter days.\"\r\nShe was, indeed, as her epitaph informs us, _pietate_, _doctrina_,\r\n_beneficentia insignis_, and as such she will live in the memory of our\r\nrace as long as men shall admire genius and love virtue.\r\n\r\nIn the year following the publication of Agnesi's _Instituzioni\r\nAnalitiche_ was recorded the premature and tragic death of the\r\ndistinguished French mathematician, the Marquise Emilie du Chatelet. She\r\nhas been described as a \"thinker and scientist, precieuse and pedant,\r\nbut not the less a coquette--in short, a woman of contradictions.\"[121]\r\nTo most readers she is better known by reason of her liaison with\r\nVoltaire, of whom she is regarded as a mere satellite, than for her work\r\nin science. But she was far more than a satellite that shone by the\r\nlight received from the sage of Ferney. For there can be no doubt that\r\nshe was a highly gifted woman who, besides having a thorough knowledge\r\nof several languages, including Latin, possessed a special talent for\r\nmathematics. It was said of her that \"she read Virgil, Pope and algebra\r\nas others read novels,\" and that she was able \"to multiply nine figures\r\nby nine others in her head.\" No less an authority than the illustrious\r\nAmpere declared her to be \"a genius in geometry.\"\r\n\r\nAmong her teachers in mathematics were Clairaut, Koenig, Maupertuis,\r\nPere Jaquier and Jean Bernouilli, the immediate predecessors of such\r\ndistinguished mathematicians as Monge, Lagrange, d'Alembert and Laplace.\r\nAt her Chateau of Cirey, where she and Voltaire spent many years\r\ntogether, she was visited by learned men from various parts of Europe.\r\nAmong these was the Italian scholar, Francisco Algarotti, who was the\r\nauthor of a work entitled _Newtonism for Women_. And as Mme. du Chatelet\r\nwas an ardent admirer of Newton, the author of the _Principia_ soon\r\nbecame a strong bond of union between her and the brilliant Italian. She\r\ncalled the savants who frequented her chateau at Cirey the _Emiliens_\r\nand purposed writing memoirs to be entitled _Emiliana_--a design,\r\nhowever, which she was never able to execute.\r\n\r\nThe first work of importance from the pen of the Marquise was entitled\r\n_Institutions de Physique_. In it she gave an exposition of the\r\nphilosophy of Leibnitz and dissertations on space, time and force. In\r\nthe discussion of the last topic she seems to have anticipated some of\r\nthe later conclusions of science respecting the nature of energy.\r\n\r\nHer most noted achievement, however, was her translation of Newton's\r\n_Principia_, the first translation into French of this epoch-making\r\nwork. To translate this masterpiece from its original Latin, it was\r\nnecessary that the Marquise, in order to make it intelligible to others,\r\nshould have a thorough understanding of it herself. To the translation\r\nshe added a commentary, which shows that Mme. du Chatelet had a\r\nmathematical mind of undoubted power. She labored assiduously on this\r\ngreat undertaking for many years and completed it only shortly before\r\nher death; but it was not published until ten years after her demise.\r\n\r\nIn his _Elogie Historique_ on the Marquise's translation of the\r\n_Principia_, Voltaire, in his usual flamboyant style, declares \"Two\r\nwonders have been performed: one that Newton was able to write this\r\nwork, the other that a woman could translate and explain it.\" In an\r\neffort to express in a single sentence all his admiration for his\r\ntalented friend he does not hesitate to state: \"Never was woman so\r\nlearned as she, and never did anyone less deserve that people should say\r\nof her, 'She is a learned woman.'\" Again he refers to her with\r\ncharacteristic Frenchiness as \"a woman who has translated and explained\r\nNewton, in one word a very great man--_en un mot un tres grand\r\nhomme_.\"[122]\r\n\r\nBut, although the extent of her attainments and her ability as a\r\nmathematician were unquestionable, she fell far short of her great\r\ncontemporary, Gaetana Agnesi, both in the depth and breadth of her\r\nscholarship and in her power of infinitesimal analysis. As to her moral\r\ncharacter, she was infinitely inferior to the saintly savante of\r\nMilan. She was by inclination and profession an Epicurean and an\r\navowed sensualist. In her little treatise, _Reflexions sur le\r\nBonheur_--Reflections on Happiness--she unblushingly asserts \"that we\r\nhave nothing to do in this world except procure for ourselves agreeable\r\nsensations.\" Considering her profligate life, bordering at times on\r\nutter _abandon_, we are not surprised that one of her countrymen has\r\ncharacterized her as \"_Femme sans foi, sans moeurs, sans pudeur_,\"--a\r\nwoman without faith, without morals, without shame.[123]\r\n\r\nAnna Barbara Reinhardt of Winterthur in Switzerland was another woman of\r\nexceptional mathematical talent. She is remarkable for having extended\r\nand improved the solution of a difficult problem that specially engaged\r\nthe attention of Maupertuis. According to so competent an authority as\r\nJean Bernouilli, she was the superior, as a mathematician, of the\r\nMarquise de Chatelet.\r\n\r\nOf a more original and profound mathematical mind was Sophie Germain, a\r\ncountrywoman of the Marquise du Chatelet. Hers was the glory of being\r\none of the founders of mathematical physics. A pupil of Lagrange and a\r\nco-worker with Biot, Legendre, Poisson and Lagrange, she has justly been\r\ncalled by De Prony \"the Hypatia of the nineteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nHer success, however, was not achieved without overcoming many and great\r\ndifficulties. In the first place, she had to overcome the opposition of\r\nher family, who were decidedly averse to her studying mathematics. \"Of\r\nwhat use,\" they asked, \"was geometry to a girl?\" But in trying to\r\nextinguish her ardor for mathematics they but augmented it. Alone and\r\nunaided she read every work on mathematics she could find. The study of\r\nthis science had such a fascination for her that it became a passion. It\r\noccupied her mind day and night. Finally her parents, becoming alarmed\r\nabout her health and resolved to force her to take the necessary repose,\r\nleft her bedroom without fire or light, and even removed from it her\r\nclothing after she had gone to bed. She feigned to be resigned; but when\r\nall were asleep, she arose and, wrapping herself in quilts and blankets,\r\nshe devoted herself to her favorite studies, even when the cold was so\r\nintense that the ink was frozen in her ink-horn. Not infrequently she\r\nwas found in the morning chilled through, having been so engrossed in\r\nher studies that she was not aware of her condition. Before such a\r\ndetermined will, so extraordinary for one of her age, the family of the\r\nyoung Sophie had the wisdom to permit her to dispose of her time and\r\ngenius according to her own pleasure. And they did well. Like the great\r\ngeometer of Syracuse, Archimedes, who had ever been her inspiration in\r\nthe study of mathematics, she would have died rather than abandon a\r\nproblem which, for the time being, engaged her attention.\r\n\r\nShe first attracted the attention of savants by her mathematical theory\r\nof Chladni's figures. By the order of Napoleon, the Academy of Science\r\nhad offered a prize for the one who would \"Give the mathematical theory\r\nof the vibration of elastic surfaces and compare it with the results of\r\nexperiment.\" Lagrange declared the problem insoluble without a new\r\nsystem of analysis, which was yet to be invented. The consequence was\r\nthat no one attempted its solution except one who, until then, was\r\nalmost unknown in the mathematical world; and this one was Sophie\r\nGermain.\r\n\r\nGreat was the surprise of the savants of Europe when they learned that\r\nthe winner of the _grand prix_ of the Academy was a woman. She became at\r\nonce the recipient of congratulations from the most noted mathematicians\r\nof the world. This eventually brought her into scientific relations with\r\nsuch eminent men as Delambre, Fourier, Cauchy, Ampere, Navier,\r\nGauss[124] and others already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1816, after eight years of work on the problem, that her last\r\nmemoir on vibrating surfaces was crowned in a public seance of the\r\n_Institut de France_. After this event Mlle. Germain was treated as an\r\nequal by the great mathematicians of France. She shared their labors and\r\nwas invited to attend the sessions of the _Institut_, which was the\r\nhighest honor that this famous body had ever conferred on a woman.\r\n\r\nThe noted mathematician, M. Navier, was so impressed with the\r\nextraordinary powers of analysis evinced by one of Mlle. Germain's\r\nmemoirs on vibrating surfaces that he did not hesitate to declare that\r\n\"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman\r\nwas able to write.\"\r\n\r\nBiot, in the _Journal de Savants_, March, 1817, writes that Mlle.\r\nGermain is probably the one of her sex who has most deeply penetrated\r\nthe science of mathematics, not excepting Mme. du Chatelet, _for here\r\nthere was no Clairaut_.[125]\r\n\r\nLike Maria Gaetana Agnesi, Mlle. Germain was endowed with a profoundly\r\nphilosophical mind as well as with a remarkable talent for mathematics.\r\nThis is attested by her interesting work entitled _Considerations\r\nGenerales sur l'Etat des Sciences et des Lettres aux Differentes Epoques\r\nde Leur Culture_. All things considered, she was probably the most\r\nprofoundly intellectual woman that France has yet produced. And yet,\r\nstrange as it may seem, when the state official came to make out the\r\ndeath certificate of this eminent associate and co-worker of the most\r\nillustrious members of the French Academy of Sciences he designated her\r\nas a _rentiere_--_annuitant_--not as a _mathematicienne_. Nor is this\r\nall. When the Eiffel tower was erected, in which the engineers were\r\nobliged to give special attention to the elasticity of the materials\r\nused, there were inscribed on this lofty structure the names of\r\nseventy-two savants. But one will not find in this list the name of that\r\ndaughter of genius, whose researches contributed so much toward\r\nestablishing the theory of the elasticity of metals,--Sophie Germain.\r\nWas she excluded from this list for the same reason that Agnesi was\r\nineligible to membership in the French Academy--because she was a\r\nwoman? It would seem so. If such, indeed, was the case, more is the\r\nshame for those who were responsible for such ingratitude toward one who\r\nhad deserved so well of science, and who by her achievements had won an\r\nenviable place in the hall of fame.[126]\r\n\r\nFour years after the birth of Sophie Germain was born in Jedburgh,\r\nScotland, one whom an English writer has declared was \"the most\r\nremarkable scientific woman our country has produced.\" She was the\r\ndaughter of a naval officer, Sir William Fairfax; but is best known as\r\nMary Somerville. Her life has been well described as an \"unobtrusive\r\nrecord of what can be done by the steady culture of good natural powers\r\nand the pursuit of a high standard of excellence in order to win for a\r\nwoman a distinguished place in the sphere naturally reserved for men,\r\nwithout parting with any of those characteristics of mind, or character,\r\nor demeanor which have ever been taken to form the grace and the glory\r\nof womanhood.\"[127]\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of her youth were not conducive to scientific pursuits.\r\nOn the contrary, they were entirely unfavorable to her manifest\r\ninclinations in that direction. Having scarcely any of the advantages of\r\na school education, she was obliged to depend almost entirely on her own\r\nunaided efforts for the knowledge she actually acquired. She, like\r\nSophie Germain, was essentially a self-made woman; and her success was\r\nachieved only after long labor and suffering and in spite of the\r\npersistent opposition of family and friends.\r\n\r\nWhen she was about fifteen years old, the future Mrs. Somerville\r\nreceived her first introduction to mathematics; and then, strange to\r\nsay, it was through a fashion magazine. At the end of a page of this\r\nmagazine, \"I read,\" writes Mrs. Somerville, \"what appeared to me to be\r\nsimply an arithmetical question; but in turning the page I was surprised\r\nto see strange-looking lines mixed with letters, chiefly X's and Y's,\r\nand asked 'What is that?'\" She was told it was a kind of arithmetic,\r\ncalled algebra.\r\n\r\nHer interest was at once aroused; and she resolved forthwith to seek\r\ninformation regarding the curious lines and letters which had so excited\r\nher curiosity. \"Unfortunately,\" she tells us, \"none of our acquaintances\r\nor relatives knew anything of science or natural history; nor, had they\r\ndone so, should I have had courage to ask of them a question, for I\r\nshould have been laughed at.\"\r\n\r\nFinally she was able to secure a copy of a work on algebra and a Euclid.\r\nAlthough without a teacher she immediately applied herself to master the\r\ncontents of these two works, but she had to do so by stealth in bed\r\nafter she had retired for the night. When her father learned of what was\r\ngoing on, he said to the girl's mother, \"Peg, we must put a stop to\r\nthis, or we shall have Mary in a straightjacket one of these days.\" The\r\nmother, who had no more sympathy with her daughter's scientific pursuits\r\nthan had the father, and, fully convinced, like the great majority of\r\nher sex, that woman's duties should be confined to the affairs of the\r\nhousehold, strove to divert her daughter's mind from her \"unladylike\"\r\npursuits. But her efforts were ineffectual. The young woman, in spite of\r\nall obstacles and opposition, contrived to continue her cherished\r\nstudies; and, through her uncle, the Rev. Dr. Somerville, afterward her\r\nfather-in-law, she was able to become proficient in both Latin and\r\nGreek. When she was thirty-three years of age she became the happy\r\npossessor of a small library of mathematical works. \"I had now,\" she\r\nwrites, \"the means, and pursued my studies with increased assiduity;\r\nconcealment was no longer necessary, nor was it attempted. I was\r\nconsidered eccentric and foolish, and my conduct was highly disapproved\r\nof by many, especially by some members of my own family.\"[128]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1827, Mrs. Somerville received a letter from Lord Brougham,\r\nwho had heard of her remarkable acquirements, begging her to prepare for\r\nEnglish readers a popular exposition of Laplace's great work--_Mecanique\r\nCeleste_. She was overwhelmed with astonishment at this request, for her\r\nmodesty made her diffident of her powers; and she felt that her\r\nself-acquired knowledge of science was so far inferior to that of\r\nuniversity men that it would be sheer presumption for her to undertake\r\nthe task proposed to her. She was, however, finally persuaded to make\r\nthe attempt, with the proviso that her manuscript should be consigned to\r\nthe flames unless it fulfilled the expectations of those who urged its\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIn less than a year her work, to which she gave the name of _The\r\nMechanism of the Heavens_, was ready for the press. But it was far more\r\nthan a translation and epitome, as originally intended by its projector,\r\nLord Brougham; for, in addition to the views of Laplace, it contained\r\nthe independent opinions of the translator respecting the propositions\r\nof the illustrious French savant. No sooner was the work published than\r\nMrs. Somerville found herself famous. She had, as Sir John Herschel\r\nexpressed it, \"written for posterity,\" and her book placed her at once\r\namong the leading scientific writers and thinkers of the day. She was\r\nelected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society at the same\r\ntime as Caroline Herschel, they being the first two women thus honored.\r\nHer bust, by Chantry, was placed in the great hall of the Royal Society,\r\nand she was made a member of many other scientific societies in Europe\r\nand America. In recognition of her services to science she was granted\r\nby the government a pension of L200 a year--a sum which was shortly\r\nafterward increased to L300. In addition to all this, Mrs. Somerville\r\nhad the satisfaction of learning that her work was so highly esteemed by\r\nDr. Whewell, the great master of Trinity, that it was, chiefly on his\r\nrecommendation, introduced as a textbook in the University of Cambridge\r\nand prescribed as \"an essential work to those students who aspire to the\r\nhighest places in the examinations.\" What Mme. du Chatelet had done for\r\nNewton, Mrs. Somerville did for Laplace.\r\n\r\nAmong other books from the pen of this highly gifted woman is her\r\n_Connection of the Physical Sciences_ and a work entitled _Physical\r\nGeography_, which, together with the _Mechanism of the Heavens_, was the\r\nobject of the \"profound admiration\" of Humboldt. Then there is a number\r\nof very abstruse monographs on mathematical subjects, one of which is a\r\ntreatise of two hundred and forty-six pages _On Curves and Surfaces of\r\nHigher Orders_, which, she tells us, she \"wrote _con amore_ to fill up\r\nher morning hours while spending the winter in Southern Italy.\"\r\n\r\nHer last work was a treatise _On Molecular and Microscopic Science_\r\nembodying the most recondite investigations on the subject. This book,\r\nbegun after she had passed her eightieth birthday, occupied her for many\r\nyears and was not ready for publication until she was close upon her\r\nninetieth year. Her last occupations, continued until the day of her\r\ndeath at the advanced age of ninety-two, were the reading of a book on\r\n_Quaternions_ and the review and completion of a volume _On the Theory\r\nof Differences_.\r\n\r\nLike her illustrious friend, the great Humboldt, Mary Somerville was\r\npossessed of extraordinary physical vigor, and, like him, she retained\r\nher mental powers unimpaired until the last. And like her great rival in\r\nmathematics, Maria Gaetana Agnesi, she was always \"beautifully womanly.\"\r\nHer scientific and literary occupations did not cause her to neglect\r\nthe duties of her household or to disregard \"the graceful and artistic\r\naccomplishments of an elegant woman of the world.\" Her daughter Martha\r\nwrites of her: \"It would be almost incredible were I to describe how\r\nmuch my mother contrived to do in the course of the day. When my sister\r\nand I were small children, although busily engaged in writing for the\r\npress, she used to teach us for three hours in the morning, besides\r\nmanaging her house carefully, reading the newspapers--for she was always\r\na keen and, I must add, a liberal politician--and the most important new\r\nbooks on all subjects, grave and gay. In addition to this, she freely\r\nvisited and received her friends.... Gay and cheerful company was a\r\npleasant relaxation after a hard day's work.\"[129]\r\n\r\nThe life of Mary Somerville, like that of Gaetana Agnesi, proves that\r\nthe pursuit of science is not, as so often asserted, incompatible with\r\ndomestic and social duties. It also disposes of the fallacy, so\r\ngenerally entertained, that intellectual labor is detrimental to the\r\nhealth of women and antagonistic to longevity. The truth is that it is\r\nyet to be demonstrated that intellectual work, even of the severest\r\nkind, is, _per se_, more deleterious to women than to those of the\r\nstronger sex.\r\n\r\nScarcely less remarkable as a mathematician was Mrs. Somerville's\r\ndistinguished contemporary, Janet Taylor, who was known as the \"Mrs.\r\nSomerville of the Marine World.\" She was the author of numerous works on\r\nnavigation and nautical astronomy which in their day were highly prized\r\nby seafaring men. In recognition of her valuable services to the marine\r\nworld she was placed on the civil list of the British government.\r\n\r\nAs an eminent mathematician as well as a \"representative of the highest\r\nintellectual accomplishments to which women have attained,\" Sonya\r\nKovalevsky will ever occupy an honored place among the votaries of\r\nscience. In many respects this richly endowed daughter of Holy Russia\r\nwas _par excellence_ the woman of genius of the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nShe was born in Moscow in 1850, but although her career was brief it was\r\none of meteoric splendor. At an early age she exhibited an unusual\r\ntalent for mathematics and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Not\r\nbeing able to obtain in her own country the educational advantages she\r\ndesired, she resolved at the age of eighteen to go to Germany with a\r\nview of pursuing her studies there under more favorable auspices.\r\n\r\nShe first matriculated in the University of Heidelberg, where she spent\r\ntwo years in studying mathematics under the most eminent professors of\r\nthat famous old institution. Thence she went to Berlin. She could not\r\nenter the University there, as its doors were closed to female students;\r\nbut she was fortunate enough to prevail on the illustrious Professor\r\nWeierstrass, regarded by many as the father of mathematical analysis, to\r\ngive her private lessons. He soon discovered to his astonishment that\r\nthis child-woman had \"the gift of intuitive genius to a degree he had\r\nseldom found among even his older and more developed students.\" Under\r\nthis eminent mathematician Sonya spent about three years, at the end of\r\nwhich period she was able to present to the University of Goettingen\r\nthree theses which she had written under the direction of her professor.\r\nThe merit of her work and the testimonials which she was able to present\r\nfrom Weierstrass, Kirchhoff and others were of such supreme excellence\r\nthat she was exempted from an oral examination and was enabled, by a\r\nvery special privilege, to receive her doctorate without appearing in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nNot long after receiving her doctor's degree--one of the first to be\r\ngranted to a woman by a German university--she was offered the chair of\r\nhigher mathematics in the University of Stockholm. She was the first\r\nwoman in Europe, outside of Italy, to be thus honored. But her\r\nappointment had to be made in the face of great opposition. No other\r\nuniversity, it was urged by the conservatives, had yet offered a\r\nprofessor's chair to a woman. Strindberg, one of the leaders of modern\r\nSwedish literature, wrote an article in which he proved, \"as decidedly\r\nas that two and two make four, what a monstrosity is a woman who is a\r\nprofessor of mathematics, and how unnecessary, injurious and out of\r\nplace she is.\"[130]\r\n\r\nThe fame that came to Sonya through her achievements in the German and\r\nSwedish universities was immensely enhanced when, on Christmas eve,\r\n1888, \"at a solemn session of the French Academy of Sciences, she\r\nreceived in person the _Prix Bordin_--the greatest scientific honor\r\nwhich any woman had ever gained; one of the greatest honors, indeed, to\r\nwhich any one can aspire.\"\r\n\r\nShe became at once the heroine of the hour and was thenceforth \"a\r\nEuropean celebrity with a place in history.\" She was feted by men of\r\nscience whithersoever she went and hailed by the women of the world as\r\nthe glory of her sex and as the most brilliant type of intellectual\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\nMme. Kovalevsky's printed mathematical works embrace only a few memoirs\r\nincluding those which she presented for her doctorate and for the _Prix\r\nBordin_. But brief as they are, all of these memoirs are regarded by\r\nmathematicians as being of special value. This is particularly true of\r\nthe memoirs, which secured for her the _Prix Bordin_; for it contains\r\nthe solution of a problem that long had baffled the genius of the\r\ngreatest mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe prize had been opened to the competition of the mathematicians of\r\nthe world, and the astonishment of the committee of the French Academy\r\nwas beyond expression when it was found that the successful contestant\r\nwas a woman.[131]\r\n\r\nEveryone admired her varied and profound knowledge, but, above all, her\r\namazing powers of analysis. A German mathematician, Kronecker, did not\r\nhesitate to declare that \"the history of mathematics will speak of her\r\nas one of the rarest investigators.\"[132]\r\n\r\nShortly before her premature death, she had planned a great work on\r\nmathematics. All who are interested in the intellectual capacities and\r\nachievements of woman must regret that she was unable to complete what\r\nwould undoubtedly have been the noblest monument of woman's scientific\r\ngenius. She was then in the prime of life and perfectly equipped for the\r\nwork she had in mind. Considering the extraordinary receptive and\r\nproductive power of this richly dowered woman, there can be little\r\ndoubt, had she lived a few years longer, that she would have produced a\r\nwork that would have caused her to be ranked among the greatest\r\nmathematicians of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to record that this woman of masculine mind, masculine\r\nenergy and masculine genius, far from being mannish or unwomanly, was,\r\non the contrary, a woman of a truly feminine heart; and that, although a\r\ngiantess in intellectual attainments, she was in grace and charm and\r\ndelicacy of sentiment one of the noblest types of beautiful womanhood.\r\nShe could with the greatest ease turn from a lecture on _Abel's\r\nFunctions_ or a research on Saturn's rings to the writing of verse in\r\nFrench or of a novel in Russian or to collaborating with her friend, the\r\nDuchess of Cajanello, on a drama in Swedish, or to making a lace collar\r\nfor her little daughter, Fouzi, to whom she was most tenderly\r\nattached.[133]\r\n\r\nLittle more than a quarter of a century has elapsed since Strindberg,\r\nexpressing the sentiment of the great majority of the men of his time,\r\ndeclared that a woman professor of mathematics is a monstrosity. But\r\nduring this short period what a change has been effected in the attitude\r\nof the world toward women who devote themselves to the study and the\r\nteaching of science! Women mathematicians are found to-day in all\r\ncivilized countries, and no sane person now considers it any more\r\n\"unwomanly\" or more \"monstrous\" for them to study or teach mathematics\r\nthan for them to teach music or needlework. Yet more. They are now\r\nfrequent contributors to mathematical magazines and to the official\r\nbulletins of learned societies, and not infrequently they are on the\r\neditorial staffs of publications devoted exclusively to mathematics.\r\nThey are also found as computers in some of the largest astronomical\r\nobservatories, where the speed and accuracy of their work have evoked\r\nthe most favorable comment.\r\n\r\nOf women in America, who have distinguished themselves by their work in\r\nthe higher mathematics, it suffices to mention the name of Miss\r\nCharlotte Angas Scott, recently deceased, who was for years professor of\r\nmathematics in the College of Bryn Mawr. Her writings on various\r\nproblems of the higher mathematics show that she faithfully followed in\r\nthe footsteps of her illustrious predecessors,--Hypatia, Agnesi, du\r\nChatelet, Germain, Somerville and Kovalevsky.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[108] \"Ipse mulieres Philosophas in libris Veterum sexaginta quinque\r\nreperi,\" _Historia Mulierum Philosopharum_, p. 3, Amstelodami, 1692.\r\n\r\n[109] Plato had inscribed above the entrance of his school, [Greek:\r\nOudeis ageometretos eisito].

Ligier, Dijon,\r\n1879.\r\n\r\n[113] Ambrosius in his preface to the works of Abelard and Heloise\r\nrefers to the latter as \"Clarum sui sexus sidus et ornamentum,\" and\r\ndeclares \"necnon mathesin, philosophiam et theologiam a viro suo edocta,\r\nillo solo minor fuit.\"\r\n\r\n[114] Mazzuchelli says of her in his _Museo_, \"Sembra non avervi nella\r\nNatura cosa la piu intralciata ed oscura nelle storie, ne finalemente la\r\npiu astrusa nelle matematiche e nelle mecchaniche, che a lei conta non\r\nsia e palese, e che sfugga la capacita del suo spirito.\" _Dizionario\r\nBiografico_, Vol. I, p. 122, by Ambrogio Levati, Milano, 1821.\r\n\r\n[115] _Delle Donne Illustri Italiane del XIII al XIX Secolo_, p. 268,\r\nRoma.\r\n\r\n[116] The full title of this celebrated discourse is _Oratio qua\r\nostenditur Artium liberalium studia a Faemineo sexu neutiquam abhorere,\r\nhabita a Maria de Agnesis Rhetoricae Operam Dante, Anno aetatis suae nono\r\nnondum exacto, die 18, Augusti, 1727_. It is found at the end of a work\r\nentitled _Discorsi Academici di varj autori Viventi intorno agli Stuj\r\ndelle Donne in Padova_, 1729. This subject, it may be remarked,\r\nfrequently engaged the attention of Maria Gaetana as she advanced in\r\nyears, for we find it among the questions discussed in her\r\n_Propositiones Philosophicae_, pp. 2 and 3, Mediolani, 1738.\r\n\r\n[117] M. Charles de Brosses, in his _Lettres Familieres ecrites de\r\nl'Italie en 1739 et 1740_, speaks of Agnesi in terms that recall the\r\nmarvelous stories which are related of Admirable Crichton and Pico della\r\nMirandola. \"She appeared to me,\" he tells us, \"something more\r\nstupendous--_una cosa piu stupenda_--than the Duomo of Milan.\" Having\r\nbeen invited to a _conversazione_ for the purpose of meeting this\r\nwonderful woman, the learned Frenchman found her to be a \"young lady of\r\nabout eighteen or twenty.\" She was surrounded by \"about thirty people\r\n... many of them from different parts of Europe.\" The discussion turned\r\non various questions of mathematics and natural philosophy.\r\n\r\n\"She spoke,\" writes de Brosses, \"wonderfully well on these subjects,\r\nthough she could not have been prepared beforehand any more than we\r\nwere. She is much attached to the philosophy of Newton; and, it is\r\nmarvelous to see a person of her age so conversant with such abstruse\r\nsubjects. Yet, however much I was surprised at the extent and depth of\r\nher knowledge, I was still more amazed to hear her speak Latin ... with\r\nsuch purity, ease and accuracy, that I do not recollect any book in\r\nmodern Latin written in so classical a style as that in which she\r\npronounced these discourses.... The conversation afterwards became\r\ngeneral, everyone speaking in the language of his own country, and she\r\nanswering in the same language; for, her knowledge of languages is\r\nprodigious.\"\r\n\r\n[118] At the conclusion of an elaborate review of Colton's translation\r\nof Agnesi's _Instituzioni Analitiche_ in the _Edinburgh Review_ for\r\nJanuary, 1804, the writer expresses himself as follows: \"We cannot take\r\nleave of a work that does so much honor to female genius, without\r\nearnestly recommending the perusal of it to those who believe that great\r\ntalents are bestowed by nature exclusively on man, and who allege that\r\nwomen, even in their highest attainments, are to be compared only to\r\n_grown children_, and have, in no instance, given proofs of original and\r\ninventive powers, of a capacity for patient research, or for profound\r\ninvestigation. Let those who hold these opinions endeavor to follow the\r\nauthor of the _Analytical Institutions_ through the long series of\r\ndemonstrations, which she has contrived with so much skill and explained\r\nwith such elegance and perspicuity. If they are able to do so, and to\r\ncompare her work with others of the same kind, they will probably\r\nretract their former opinions, and acknowledge that, in one instance at\r\nleast, intellectual powers of the highest order have been lodged in the\r\nbrain of a woman.\r\n\r\n\"At si gelidus obstiterit circum praecordia sanguis; and if they are\r\nunable to attend this illustrious female in her scientific excursions,\r\nof course, they will not see the reasons for admiring her genius that\r\nothers do; but they may at least learn to think modestly of their own.\"\r\n\r\n[119] It is surprising how many legends have obtained respecting the\r\nlife of Agnesi after the publication of her _Instituzioni Analitiche_.\r\nThus, the writer of the article in the _Edinburgh Review_, above quoted,\r\ndeclares that \"she retired to a convent of _blue nuns_,\"--a statement\r\nthat has frequently been repeated in many of our most noted\r\nencyclopedias.\r\n\r\nIn a _Prospetto Biografico delle Donne Italiane_, written by G. C.\r\nFacchini and published in Venice in 1824, it is stated that Maria\r\nGaetana was selected by the Pope to occupy \"the chair of mathematics\r\nwhich had been left vacant by the death of her father,\" while Cavazza in\r\nhis work _\"Le Scuole dell,\" Antico Studio Bolognese_, pp. 289-290,\r\npublished in Milan in 1896, assures us that Gaetana Agnesi taught\r\nanalytical geometry in the University of Bologna for full forty-eight\r\nyears. The facts are that neither the father nor the daughter ever\r\ntaught even a single hour either in this or in any other university.

How many men are there who give more advanced\r\nmathematical courses than these?\r\n\r\n[133] To a friend, who expressed surprise at her fluttering to and fro\r\nbetween mathematics and literature, she made a reply which deserves a\r\nplace here, as it gives a better idea than anything else of the\r\nwonderful versatility of this gifted daughter of Russia. \"I understand,\"\r\nshe writes, \"your surprise at my being able to busy myself\r\nsimultaneously with literature and mathematics. Many who have never had\r\nan opportunity of knowing any more about mathematics confound it with\r\narithmetic, and consider it an arid science. In reality, however, it is\r\na science which requires a great amount of imagination, and one of the\r\nleading mathematicians of our century states the case quite correctly\r\nwhen he says that it is impossible to be a mathematician without being a\r\npoet in soul. Only, of course, in order to comprehend the accuracy of\r\nthis definition, one must renounce the ancient prejudice that a poet\r\nmust invent something which does not exist, that imagination and\r\ninvention are identical. It seems to me that the poet has only to\r\nperceive that which others do not perceive, to look deeper than others\r\nlook. And the mathematician must do the same thing. As for myself, all\r\nmy life I have been unable to decide for which I had the greater\r\ninclination, mathematics or literature. As soon as my brain grows\r\nwearied of purely abstract speculations it immediately begins to incline\r\nto observations on life, to narrative, and _vice versa_, everything in\r\nlife begins to appear insignificant and uninteresting, and only the\r\neternal, immutable laws of science attract me. It is very possible that\r\nI should have accomplished more in either of these lines, if I had\r\ndevoted myself exclusively to it; nevertheless, I cannot give up either\r\nof them completely.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Ellen Key's _Biography of the Duchess of Cajanello_, quoted in Anna\r\nLeffler's biography of Sonya Kovalevsky, ut sup, pp. 317-318.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nUrania, the muse of astronomy, was a woman; and, although most of her\r\ndevotees have been men, the number of the gentler sex who have achieved\r\nsuccess in the cultivation of the science of the stars has been much\r\nlarger than is usually supposed.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that woman's interest in astronomy dates back\r\nto early Egyptian and Babylonian times when the star-gazers in the\r\nfertile valley of the Nile and on the broad plains of Chaldea were so\r\nactive, and when they made so many important discoveries respecting the\r\nlaws and movements of the heavenly bodies. According to Plutarch,\r\nAganice, the daughter of Sesostris, King of Egypt, tried to predict\r\nfuture events by the aid of celestial globes and by the study of the\r\nconstellations. Her observations, however, were in the interests of\r\nastrology rather than of astronomy, as we now understand the science.\r\n\r\nThe first woman whose name has come down to us, who deserved to be\r\nregarded as an astronomer, was most probably Aglaonice, the daughter of\r\nHegetoris of Thessaly. By means of the lunar cycle known as the Saros, a\r\nperiod discovered by the Chaldean astronomers and embracing a little\r\nmore than eighteen years, during which the eclipses of the moon and sun\r\nrecur in nearly the same order as during the preceding period, this\r\nGreek woman was able to predict eclipses. The people among whom she\r\nlived regarded her as a sorceress; but she flouted them all, and\r\ndeclared that she was able to make the sun and moon disappear at will.\r\n\r\nThe first woman, however, to attain eminence as an astronomer was\r\nundoubtedly Hypatia, that universal genius of the ancient world, who\r\nseemed equally at home in literature, philosophy and mathematics, and\r\nwho may justly be regarded as one of the most highly gifted women that\r\nhas ever lived. In Alexandria, where she was born and lived, this\r\naccomplished daughter of Theon taught not only philosophy, but also\r\nalgebra, geometry and astronomy. One of her pupils, Synesius, who became\r\nBishop of Ptolemais, informs us that she was the inventor of two\r\nimportant astronomical instruments: an astrolabe and a planisphere. In\r\naddition to two mathematical works, a _Treatise on the Conics of\r\nApollonius_ and a _Commentary on the Arithmetic of Diophantus_, which\r\nwas in reality a treatise on algebra, she was the author of an\r\n_Astronomical Canon_, which contained tables regarding the movements of\r\nthe heavenly bodies. It is generally supposed that this was an original\r\nwork; but there are some who think it was but a commentary on the tables\r\nof Ptolemy. In this latter case Hypatia's work may still exist in\r\nconnection with that of her father, Theon, on the same subject.[134]\r\n\r\nIf the works of Hypatia had not been destroyed by the ravages of time,\r\nthey would undoubtedly prove that she fully merited all the encomiums\r\nbestowed on her by antiquity for her genius; and they would also prove,\r\nwe may well believe, that she deserved to be ranked not only with the\r\neminent mathematicians upon whose works she commented, but also with\r\nsuch masters of astronomic science as Ptolemy, Eratosthenes and\r\nAristarchus.\r\n\r\nAfter the tragic death of Hypatia many centuries elapsed before any\r\nother woman attracted attention for her work in astronomy. Indeed, so\r\nneglected was the study of the heavens between the time of Hypatia and\r\nthe Arab prince and astronomer, Albategni, who flourished during the\r\nlatter part of the ninth century and the early part of the tenth, that\r\nonly eight observations, it is asserted, were recorded during this long\r\nperiod. The works and observations of Albategni, it may be remarked,\r\nhave a particular interest from the fact that they form a connecting\r\nlink between those of the Alexandrine astronomers and those of modern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nAntoine Hamilton, in his _Gaufrey_--a parody on _The Thousand and One\r\nNights_--tells of a Saracen princess, _Fleur d'Epine_, who, before she\r\nwas fifteen years of age, was able not only to speak Latin and Romance,\r\nbut who was also \"better acquainted than any woman in the world with the\r\nmovements of the stars and the moon.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Et du cours des etoiles et de la lune luisant\r\n    Savoit moult plus que fame de chest siecle vivant.\"\r\n\r\nIf any woman between the time of Hypatia and Galileo deserved such high\r\npraise for her astronomical knowledge it was certainly Saint Hildegard,\r\nthe famous Benedictine abbess of Bingen on the Rhine. She has well been\r\ncalled \"the marvel of the twelfth century,\" not only on account of her\r\nsanctity, but also on account of her extraordinary attainments in every\r\nbranch of knowledge then cultivated.\r\n\r\nWhen treating of the sun, Hildegard tells us that it is in the center of\r\nthe firmament and holds in place the stars that gravitate around it, as\r\nthe earth attracts the creatures which inhabit it. This view of a\r\ntwelfth century nun is indeed remarkable. For, in her time, the earth\r\nwas by everyone considered as the center of the firmament, while\r\nuniversal gravitation--the sublime discovery of Newton--had not as yet\r\nentered into the scientific theories of that epoch.\r\n\r\nHildegard likewise anticipates subsequent discoveries regarding the\r\nalternation of the seasons. \"If,\" she writes, \"it is cold in the winter\r\ntime on the part of the earth which we inhabit, the other part must be\r\nwarm, in order that the temperature of the earth may always be in\r\nequilibrium.\" That she should have arrived at this conclusion before\r\nnavigators had visited the southern hemisphere is truly\r\nastonishing.[135]\r\n\r\n\"The stars,\" she continues, \"have neither the same brightness nor the\r\nsame size. They are kept in their course by a superior body.\" Here again\r\nis her idea of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nThese stars, she further declares, are not immovable, but they traverse\r\nthe firmament in its entirety. And to make clearer her conception of the\r\nmotion of the stars, she compares this motion to that of the blood in\r\nthe veins. To hear one of this early period speaking of blood coursing\r\nthrough the veins and thus traversing the whole body of man seems to\r\npresage, in a remarkable manner, the beautiful discoveries of Cesalpino\r\nand Harvey regarding the circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated astronomer of the early Renaissance was John Mueller,\r\nof Koenigsburg, better known as Regiomontanus. In his observatory in\r\nNuremberg he was ably assisted by his wife who exhibited a special\r\ninterest in astronomy. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sophia\r\nBrahe, the youngest sister of Tycho Brahe, following in the footsteps of\r\nher illustrious brother, attained great celebrity as an astronomer.\r\n\r\nMore distinguished for her astronomical work than either of these two\r\nwomen was Maria Cunitz, a Silesian, who, from her tenderest years,\r\ndisplayed extraordinary zeal for study and who eventually became\r\nmistress of seven languages, among which were Latin, Greek and Hebrew.\r\nShe also cultivated poetry, music and painting; but her favorite studies\r\nwere mathematics and astronomy. At the solicitation of her husband, she\r\nundertook the preparation of an abridgment of the _Rudolphine Tables_.\r\nHer work, under the name of _Urania Propitia_, was published after her\r\ndeath by her husband, and gained for the talented authoress the name of\r\n\"The second Hypatia.\"[136]\r\n\r\nShortly after the completion of _Urania Propitia_, a French woman,\r\nJeanne Dumee, distinguished herself by writing a work on the theory of\r\nCopernicus entitled _Entretiens sur l'Opinion de Copernic Touchant la\r\nMobilite de la Terre_. So far as known, this work was never published,\r\nbut the original manuscript is still preserved in the National Library\r\nof Paris. The authoress deems it necessary it apologize for writing on a\r\nsubject that is usually considered foreign to her sex and to explain why\r\nshe was ambitious to discuss questions to which the women of her time\r\nnever gave any thought. It was that she might \"prove to them that they\r\nare not incapable of study, if they wish to make the effort, because\r\nbetween the brain of a woman and that of a man there is no\r\ndifference.\"[137]\r\n\r\nHow often before had not women endeavored to prove the equality of brain\r\npower of the two sexes, and how often since have they bent their efforts\r\nin this direction! And yet the majority of men still remain skeptical\r\nabout such equality.\r\n\r\nAmong the contemporaries of Jeanne Dumee were two other women who gained\r\nmore than ordinary distinction by their attainments in astronomy. These\r\nwere Mme. de la Sabliere, in France, and Maria Margaret Kirch, of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nMme. de la Sabliere evinced from an early age a special aptitude for\r\nscience, especially for physics and astronomy. She studied mathematics\r\nunder the eminent mathematician, Roberval, and at the age of thirty was\r\nfamous. Her home became the resort of learned and eminent men, including\r\nsome of the most noted characters of the age. Among these was Sobieski,\r\nKing of Poland. But it is as the friend and protectress of La Fontaine\r\nand as the object of Boileau's satire that she is best known.\r\n\r\nFor a woman to devote herself to the study of science so soon after the\r\nappearance of Moliere's _Les Femmes Savantes_ argued more than ordinary\r\ncourage. But for her to become distinguished for her scientific\r\nacquirements was almost tantamount to defying public opinion. The great\r\nmajority of men had come to regard learned women in the same light as\r\nthose who were so mercilessly derided in the _Precieuses Ridicules_; and\r\nthey had, accordingly, no hesitation in treating them as unbearable\r\npedants. No one could have made less parade of her learning than Mme. de\r\nla Sabliere, or striven more successfully to conceal her admirable\r\ngifts. But this was not sufficient. She was known to have devoted\r\nspecial study to science, particularly to astronomy, and this was\r\nsufficient to make her the target of the satirists of her time.\r\n\r\nBy an act that wounded the self-love of Boileau this Venus Urania, as\r\nshe has been called, soon found herself the victim of the satirist's\r\nwell-directed shafts. The poet does not name her, but refers to her as\r\n\r\n                                  \"Cette savante\r\n    Qu'estime Roberval et que Sauveur frequente----\"\r\n\r\nthis learned woman whom Roberval esteems and whom Sauveur frequents. And\r\nwith the view of pricking the object of his spleen in her most sensitive\r\npart, he tells, in his _Satire contre les Femmes_, how she, with\r\nastrolabe in hand, spends her nights in making observations of the\r\nplanet Jupiter and how this occupation has had the effect of weakening\r\nher sight and ruining her complexion.[138]\r\n\r\nMme. de la Sabliere does not, however, seem to have been greatly\r\nperturbed by the ungracious effusions of the satirist, for she continued\r\nher cultivation of astronomy as before the poet's ill-natured outburst.\r\nShe probably found ample compensation in the writings of La Fontaine,\r\nwho addressed her as his muse and proclaimed her as one in whom were\r\ncombined manly beauty and feminine grace--_beaute d'homme avec grace de\r\nfemme_.\r\n\r\nMaria Kirch, born at Panitch, near Leipsic, in 1670, was the wife of a\r\nBerlin astronomer, Gottfried Kirch. After her marriage she, like her\r\nthree sisters-in-law, became her husband's pupil in astronomy. In 1702,\r\nas his assistant in observations and calculations, she was fortunate\r\nenough to discover a comet. She was the friend of Leibnitz, and was by\r\nhim presented to the court of Prussia. It is a matter of regret to those\r\nof her own sex that this comet was not, as it should have been, named\r\nafter its discoverer.\r\n\r\nThe death of Herr Kirch, which took place in 1710, caused no\r\ninterruption in Frau Kirch's astronomical occupations. Among the\r\nevidences of her activity is a work which she wrote in 1713 on the\r\nconjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the year following. In our day the\r\nconjunction of planets is for the laity a mere matter of curiosity,\r\nwhile for professional astronomers it is quite devoid of particular\r\ninterest. But it was not so in the time of Maria Kirch, for then\r\nastronomy was so intimately associated with astrology that mankind\r\nattributed to such special positions of the planets a certain occult and\r\ncapricious influence on the destiny of the earth and its inhabitants. As\r\ntheoretical astronomy progressed, such erroneous notions were\r\nabandoned, because it was then recognized that the conjunction of the\r\nsuperior planets was not something fortuitous, but something that was\r\nreproduced at fixed periods by the known movements of these bodies.\r\nWriters on the subject made it a point to warn the public that they had\r\nnothing in common with astrologers. Among these was Christopher Thurm,\r\nwho published a work on the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 1681.\r\nSimilarly, the book of Maria Kirch contains only astronomical\r\ncalculations and nothing more--a fact that redounds to the honor of the\r\nauthor and to the age in which she lived.\r\n\r\nThe daughters of Maria Kirch, even long after their mother's death,\r\ncontinued to occupy themselves with astronomy. They calculated for the\r\nBerlin Academy of Sciences its _Almanac_ and _Ephemeris_, which were\r\namong the sources of revenue of this learned body.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period a number of French and Italian astronomers had\r\nfemale collaborators in their own families. Celsus, the celebrated\r\nprofessor of Upsala, and a pupil of the son of Gottfried Kirch, had been\r\naccorded a most cordial reception, while passing through Paris on his\r\nway to Bologna, by De L'Isle who had a sister who was devoted to\r\nastronomy. On his arrival in Italy he found that his new master, the\r\ndirector of the observatory at Bologna, had two sisters, Teresa and\r\nMaddalena, both of great learning, who, like their brother, were engaged\r\nin the study of the heavens and collaborated with him in the preparation\r\nof the _Ephemeris_ of Bologna. This caused Celsus, in a letter to Kirch,\r\nto declare \"I begin to believe that it is the destiny of all the\r\nastronomers whom I have had the honor of becoming acquainted with during\r\nmy journey to have learned sisters. I have also a sister, although not a\r\nvery learned one. To preserve the harmony, we must make an astronomer of\r\nher.\"[139]\r\n\r\nThe Polish astronomer, Hevilius, who had an observatory at Dantzig, is\r\nnoted for having made the most accurate observations that had been known\r\nbefore the adaptation of the telescope to astronomical instruments. He\r\nis also noted for his _Prodromus Astronomiae_, a catalogue of 1,888\r\nstars; for his _Selenographia_, containing accurate descriptions and\r\ndrawings of the moon in her different phases and librations, and for his\r\n_Machina Coelestis_, which contained the results of forty years of\r\nobservations and labor. Much of his success and eminence, however, was\r\ndue to his intelligent and devoted wife, Elizabeth, who, during\r\ntwenty-seven years, was a zealous collaborator and should share the\r\ncredit usually given to her husband. It was she who, after his death,\r\nedited and published their joint work, the _Prodromus Astronomiae_.\r\n\r\nAmong the women most distinguished in the eighteenth century for\r\nastronomical pursuits was the Marquise du Chatelet, who was likewise\r\nfamous for her knowledge of mathematics. It was she who accomplished the\r\ndifficult task of translating Newton's _Principia_ into French. \"This\r\ntranslation,\" writes Voltaire, \"which the most learned men of France\r\nshould have made and which the others should study, was undertaken by a\r\nwoman and completed to the astonishment and glory of her country.\"[140]\r\n\r\nFrance was at this time devoted to the doctrines of Descartes and to his\r\ntheory of elementary vortices; and Voltaire, who had been deeply\r\nimpressed by the admirable simplicity of Newton's theory of universal\r\nattraction as a means of explaining the seemingly complex motions of\r\nthe heavenly bodies, resolved to make his countrymen acquainted with the\r\nteachings of the great English geometer and, at the same time, dethrone\r\nDescartes in the French Academy. It was, indeed, a huge undertaking;\r\nbut, thanks to the ability which Mme. du Chatelet displayed in\r\ntranslating and elucidating Newton's immortal masterpiece, he lived to\r\nsee his dream realized.\r\n\r\nHow proud Mme. du Chatelet's countrywomen must have been of her! How\r\nthey must have rejoiced in her success and acclaimed her as the\r\nintellectual glory of her sex! How they must have pointed to her work as\r\na triumphant refutation of the age-old belief in woman's incapacity for\r\nmathematics and all abstract science! How they must have been elated to\r\nfind one of their number successfully executing a task which would have\r\ntaxed the powers of the most eminent mathematicians of France! How they\r\nmust have associated her truly notable performance with similar\r\nachievements of Hypatia and Maria Gaetana Agnesi and discerned in it\r\nconcrete evidence of the falsity of all those imputations of mental\r\ninferiority which had been fostered by \"man's huge egotism and woman's\r\ncarefully coddled superstition.\" How they must have been encouraged by\r\nher achievement and spurred on to emulate her by similar contributions\r\nto the advancement of science!\r\n\r\nThat is what we think now; but the light and frivolous women who\r\nconstituted the leaders of society in Mme. du Chatelet's day, and who\r\nwere devoured by envy and jealousy of one who was so much their superior\r\nin intellect were not so minded. Far from sympathizing with her work,\r\nthey proved to be her most virulent critics and most pronounced enemies.\r\nNeither Moliere nor Boileau could have heaped more ridicule on the\r\npedantic women of their time than was meted out to the translator of the\r\n_Principia_ by certain noble dames of provincial chateaux or by\r\ndistinguished habituees of prominent Parisian salons.\r\n\r\nThus the petulant _ennuyee_, Mme. de Stael, in a letter to her friend,\r\nMme. du Deffand, writing of Mme. du Chatelet, who was then her guest at\r\nSceaux, tells us that \"she is now passing in review her principles. This\r\nis a task she performs every year, else they might, perhaps, make their\r\nescape and run to such a distance that she would never be able to\r\nrecover any of them. I verily believe that they are in durance vile\r\nwhile in her possession, as they were certainly not born with her. She\r\ndoes well to keep a strict watch over them.\"[141]\r\n\r\nAnd, in her turn, Mme. du Deffand, who was wont to pose as the intimate\r\nfriend of Mme. du Chatelet, did not hesitate to write and circulate a\r\npen portrait of this friend--and that after the unhappy woman was in her\r\ngrave--which for bitter reviling and brutal villification has probably\r\nnever been equalled. A witty Frenchman observed of this portrait that it\r\nreminded him of an observation once made by a medical acquaintance of\r\nhis concerning one of his patients: \"'My friend fell ill; I attended\r\nhim. He died; I dissected him.'\"[142]\r\n\r\nAmong other women astronomers of the eighteenth century who deserve\r\nmention are Mme. du Pierry, the Duchesse Louise of Saxe-Gotha, and Mme.\r\nHortense Lepaute.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lalande, Mme. du Pierry was the first woman professor of\r\nastronomy in Paris. He dedicated to her his _Astronomie des Dames_, and\r\nincorporated in his own works many of her memoirs on astronomical\r\nsubjects. She devoted much time to calculating eclipses with a view to\r\naccurately determining the motion of the moon, and was, besides, the\r\nauthor of numerous astronomical tables which exhibit patient research\r\nand unquestioned skill.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse Louise had a great reputation as a rapid and accurate\r\ncomputer, and was celebrated for the number and variety of her\r\ncomputations. Her modesty, however, prevented her from publishing\r\nanything or even having her work quoted.\r\n\r\nConsidering, however, the amount and character of her work, the most\r\neminent woman astronomer that France has yet produced was, without\r\ndoubt, Mme. Hortense Lepaute, the wife of the royal clockmaker of\r\nFrance. She first distinguished herself by her investigations on the\r\noscillations of pendulums of different lengths, an account of which is\r\nto be found in her husband's valuable work, _Traite d'Horlogerie_,\r\npublished in 1755.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 Lalande, who was then the Director of the Paris Observatory,\r\nengaged Mme. Lepaute and the celebrated mathematician, Clairaut, to\r\ndetermine the amount of the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn on Halley's\r\ncomet, whose return was expected in that year. So difficult was this\r\nproblem, and so numerous were the complications involved, that Lalande\r\nfrankly confesses that he would not have dared to undertake its solution\r\nwithout Mme. Lepaute's assistance. For it necessitated calculating for\r\nevery degree, and for one hundred and fifty years the distances and\r\nforces of each of the planets with reference to the comet. \"It would be\r\ndifficult,\" declares Lalande, \"to realize the courage which this\r\nenterprise required, if one did not know that for more than six months\r\nwe calculated from morning until night, sometimes even at meals, and\r\nthat at the end of this enforced labor I was stricken by a malady which\r\naffected me during the rest of my life.\" Clairaut was so impressed by\r\nMme. Lepaute's energy and skill during this time that he declared \"her\r\nardor was surprising,\" and he did not hesitate to call her _La savante\r\ncalculatrice_--the learned computer.[143]\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of 1762 also engaged Mme. Lepaute's attention, as did also\r\nthe annular eclipse of 1764. The latter was a curious phenomenon for\r\nFrance, as it had never before been observed. Mme. Lepaute calculated it\r\nfor the whole of Europe and published a chart showing its path for every\r\nquarter of an hour. She also published another chart for Paris, in which\r\nwere exhibited the different phases of the eclipse.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the different eclipses which she had calculated, Mme.\r\nLepaute recognized the advantage of having a table of parallactic\r\nangles. She accordingly prepared a very extended table of this kind\r\nwhich was published by the French government. Besides this table, she\r\nwas the author of numerous memoirs on astronomical subjects. Among them\r\nwas one embracing calculations based on all the observations which had\r\nbeen made on the transit of Venus in 1761.\r\n\r\n\"In 1759,\" again writes Lalande, \"I was given charge of the\r\n_Connaissance des Temps_, a work which the Academy of Sciences published\r\nevery year for the use of astronomers and navigators, the calculations\r\nfor which gave occupation to several persons. I had the good fortune to\r\nfind in Mme. Lepaute a co-worker without whom I should not have been\r\nable to undertake the labor required. She continued in this occupation\r\nuntil 1774, when another Academician assumed this laborious task. But\r\nshe thereupon began work on the _Ephemeris_, of which the seventh volume\r\nin quarto, which appeared in 1774, goes to 1784, and of which the\r\neighth, published in 1783, extends to the year 1792. In this latter\r\nvolume she made, unaided, all the computations for the sun, the moon and\r\nall the planets.\r\n\r\n\"This long series of calculations finally enfeebled her eyesight, which\r\nhad been excellent, and she was in the last years of her life obliged to\r\ndiscontinue them.\"[144]\r\n\r\nIn view of her extraordinary and long-continued work in her chosen\r\nspecialty, M. Lalande was quite warranted in stating that \"Mme. Lepaute\r\nis the only woman in France who has acquired veritable knowledge in\r\nastronomy; and she is now replaced only by Mme. du Pierry, who has\r\npublished divers astronomical calculations, and who has deserved to have\r\ndedicated to her _L'Astronomie des Dames_, which appeared in 1786.\"\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that the beautiful Japan Rose--originally\r\ncalled _Pautia_, but changed to _Hortensia_ by Jussieu--was named after\r\nthis distinguished woman. It is also gratifying to be assured that her\r\nengrossing work in astronomy in no wise caused her to neglect her home\r\nduties or to lose that sweetness of character and delicacy of refinement\r\nfor which she was noted before she entered upon the absorbing and taxing\r\ncareer of astronomical computer.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Lalande's nephew, Mme. Lefrancais de Lalande, proved herself\r\nin many respects a worthy successor of Mme. Lepaute. \"My niece,\" writes\r\nher uncle, Jerome Lalande, \"aids her husband in his observations and\r\ndraws conclusions from them by calculation. She has reduced the\r\nobservations of ten thousand stars, and prepared a work of three hundred\r\npages of horary tables--an immense work for her age and sex. They are\r\nincorporated in my _Abrege de Navigation_.\r\n\r\n\"She is one of the rare women who have written scientific books. She has\r\npublished tables for finding the time at sea by the altitude of the sun\r\nand stars. These tables were printed in 1791 by the order of the\r\nNational Assembly.... In 1799 she published a catalogue of ten thousand\r\nstars, reduced and calculated.\"\r\n\r\nThis distinguished observer and computer had a daughter in whom her\r\ngrand-uncle was particularly interested. \"This daughter of astronomy,\"\r\nhe tells us, \"was born the twentieth of January, 1790, the day on which\r\nwe at Paris saw for the first time the comet which Miss Caroline\r\nHerschel had just discovered. The child was accordingly named Caroline;\r\nher godfather was Delambre.\"\r\n\r\nThe discoverer of the comet referred to was, in many ways, a most\r\nremarkable woman. She was the sister of Sir William Herschel, the\r\nillustrious pioneer of modern physical astronomy and the virtual founder\r\nof sidereal science, as we know it to-day. She was also the aunt of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, who was the only rival of his uncle, Sir William, as an\r\nexplorer of the heavens.\r\n\r\nBut she was far more than a mere relative of these immortal leaders in\r\nastronomic science. She herself was an astronomer of distinction, and\r\nis known, in the annals of astronomy, as the discoverer of no fewer than\r\neight comets. Great, however, as was her skill as an observer and\r\ncomputer, it was as her brother's assistant that she is entitled to the\r\nmost distinction. Her affection for him was as unbounded as her devotion\r\nto his life work was abiding and productive of great results. For fifty\r\nyears, after joining him in England--they both had been born and bred in\r\nHanover--she was ever at his side, to assist him in his labors and to\r\ncheer him by her words of counsel and encouragement. She helped him to\r\ngrind and polish the mirrors that were used in his epoch-making\r\nreflectors. This was a most arduous task; for, at that time, there was\r\nno machinery sufficiently exact for grinding specula, and, as a\r\nconsequence, the work had all to be done by hand. So interested was the\r\ngreat astronomer in his work, when polishing his larger specula, that he\r\nforgot all about the passage of time, and on these occasions his sister\r\nwas constantly obliged, as she herself informs us, \"to feed him by\r\nputting the victuals by bits into his mouth by way of keeping him\r\nalive.\" When finishing his seven-foot reflector he was on one occasion\r\nfound so intent on his work that \"he had not taken his hands from it for\r\nsixteen hours together.\"\r\n\r\nIn our day, when all kinds of astronomical apparatus are made by\r\nmachinery, it is difficult for us to realize what stupendous labor was\r\nrequired to produce those giant telescopes with which the Herschels made\r\ntheir great discoveries and by which they, at the same time,\r\nrevolutionized the science of the stars. For they had not only to design\r\nand make the specula, but also the mountings of the mirrors as well.\r\nAnd, in order to obtain the money required for material and workmen,\r\nthey were obliged to make telescopes for sale. This meant an immense\r\nloss of precious time that would otherwise have been devoted to the\r\nstudy of the heavens.\r\n\r\nAfter long years of struggle, during which the devoted brother and\r\nsister overcame countless difficulties of every kind, their condition\r\nwas somewhat ameliorated by financial aid from the government and by\r\nWilliam's appointment to the position of astronomer royal with a salary\r\nof L200 a year. When Sir William Watson heard that this limited sum had\r\nbeen granted by George III to the discoverer of Georgium Sidus--the\r\nplanet now known as Uranus--he exclaimed, \"Never bought monarch honor so\r\ncheap.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Caroline was appointed as assistant to her brother at\r\na salary of L50 a year. This we should now consider but a nominal sum,\r\nbut she managed to live on it. When she received the first quarterly\r\npayment of twelve pounds she wrote in her memoirs, \"It was the first\r\nmoney I ever in all my lifetime thought myself to be at liberty to spend\r\nto my liking.\" Her appointment as assistant to her brother is notable\r\nfrom the fact that she was the first woman in England, if not in the\r\nworld, to hold such a position in the government service.\r\n\r\nMiss Herschel held this official appointment until Sir William's death\r\nin 1822. When not acting as her brother's assistant or secretary, she\r\ndevoted her time to what she quaintly called \"minding the heavens.\" It\r\nwas during this period that she made her most important discoveries. As\r\nassistant, however, to so indefatigable an observer as Sir William\r\nHerschel, she had but little time for sweeping the heavens, for, when at\r\nhome, Sir William \"was invariably accustomed to carry on his\r\nobservations until day-break, circumstances permitting, without regard\r\nto seasons; it was the business of his assistant to note the clocks and\r\nto write down the observations from his dictations as they were made.\r\nSubsequently she assisted in the laborious numerical calculations and\r\nreductions, so that it was only during his absence from home or when any\r\nother interruption of his regular course of observation occurred that\r\nshe was able to devote herself to the Newtonian sweeper, which she used\r\nto such good purpose. Besides the eight comets by her discovered, she\r\ndetected several remarkable nebulae and clusters of stars, previously\r\nunnoticed, especially the superb nebulae known as No. 1, Class V, in Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel's catalogue. Long practice taught her to make light of\r\nher work. 'An observer at your twenty-foot when sweeping,' she wrote\r\nmany years after, 'wants nothing but a being who _can_ and _will_\r\nexecute his commands with the quickness of lightning; for you will have\r\nseen that in many sweeps six or twice six objects have been secured and\r\ndescribed in one minute of time.'\"[145]\r\n\r\nIt was her quick, intelligent action, combined with a patience,\r\nenthusiasm and powers of endurance that were most extraordinary, that\r\nmade Caroline Herschel so valuable as an assistant to her brother, and\r\nenabled him to achieve the unique position which is his among the\r\nworld's greatest astronomers. Had she been able to devote all her time\r\nto \"minding the heavens,\" it is certain that she would have made many\r\nmore discoveries than are now credited to her; but her service to\r\nastronomy would have been less than it was as the auxiliary of her\r\nillustrious brother. No two ever did better \"teamwork\"; no two were ever\r\nmore devoted to each other or exhibited greater enthusiasm in the task\r\nto which they so heroically devoted their lives.[146]\r\n\r\nIn addition to her arduous and engrossing duties as secretary and\r\nassistant to her brother, Caroline found time to prepare a number of\r\nworks for the press. Among these were a _Catalogue of Eight Hundred and\r\nSixty Stars Observed by Flamsteed but not Included in the British\r\nCatalogue_ and _A General Index of Reference to Every Observation of\r\nEvery Star in the Above-mentioned British Catalogue_. She had the honor\r\nof having these two works published by the Royal Society. Another, and a\r\nmore valuable work, was _The Reduction and Arrangement in the Form of\r\nCatalogue, in Zones, of All the Star-Clusters and Nebulae Observed by Sir\r\nW. Herschel in His Sweeps_. It was for this catalogue that a gold medal\r\nwas voted to her by the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828--a production\r\nthat was characterized as \"a work of immense labor\" and \"an\r\nextraordinary monument to the unextinguished ardor of a lady of\r\nseventy-five in the cause of abstract science.\" To her nephew, Sir John\r\nHerschel, it proved invaluable, as it supplied the needful data \"when he\r\nundertook the review of the nebulae of the northern hemisphere.\" It was\r\nalso a fitting prelude to Sir John's _Cape Observations_, a copy of\r\nwhich great work she received from her nephew nearly twenty years\r\nsubsequently, after he had completed his famous observations of the\r\nsouthern heavens in his observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\"By a most striking and happy coincidence,\" writes Mrs. John Herschel,\r\n\"she, whose unflagging toil had so greatly contributed to its successful\r\nprosecution in the hands of her beloved brother, lived to witness its\r\ntriumphant termination through the no less persistent industry and\r\nstrenuous labor of his son; and her last days were crowned by the\r\npossession of the work which brought to its glorious conclusion Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel's vast undertaking--_The Survey of the Heavens_.\"\r\n\r\nThat Miss Herschel's labors in the cause of astronomy were appreciated\r\nby her contemporaries is evidenced by the honors of which she was the\r\nrecipient. The first of these honors came in the form of a gold medal,\r\nunanimously awarded by the Royal Astronomical Society for her reduction\r\nof twenty-five hundred nebulae \"discovered by her illustrious brother,\r\nwhich may be considered as the completion of a series of exertions\r\nprobably unparalleled either in magnitude or importance in the annals of\r\nastronomical labor.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion, when referring to the immensity of the task\r\nwhich Sir William Herschel had undertaken, that the vice-president of\r\nthe society paid a deserving tribute to the great astronomer's devoted\r\nsister, in which is found the following statement:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Herschel it was who by right acted as his amanuensis; she it was\r\nwhose pen conveyed to paper his observations as they issued from his\r\nlips; she it was who noted the right ascensions and polar distances of\r\nthe objects observed; she it was who, having passed the night near the\r\ninstrument, took the rough manuscripts to her cottage at the dawn of day\r\nand produced a fair copy of the night's work on the following morning;\r\nshe it was who planned the labor of each succeeding night; she it was\r\nwho reduced every observation, made every calculation; she it was who\r\narranged everything in systematic order; and she it was who helped him\r\nto obtain his imperishable name.\"[147]\r\n\r\nBesides this gold medal from the Royal Astronomical Society, Miss\r\nHerschel also received two others, one from the King of Denmark and the\r\nother from the King of Prussia. The latter was accompanied by a most\r\neulogistic letter from Alexander von Humboldt, who informed her that the\r\nmedal was awarded her \"in recognition of the valuable services rendered\r\nby her as the fellow worker of her immortal brother, Sir William\r\nHerschel, by discoveries, observations and laborious calculations.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1835, when she was eighty-five years of age, Miss Herschel had the\r\nsignal honor of being elected, along with Mrs. Somerville, an honorary\r\nmember of the Royal Astronomical Society. As they were the first two\r\nwomen in England to receive such recognition for their contributions to\r\nscience, it seems desirable to reproduce here an extract from the report\r\nof the council of the society regarding the bestowal of an honor which\r\nmarked so distinct a change in England of the attitude that should be\r\ntaken toward women who excelled in intellectual achievements. The\r\nextract reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your council has no small pleasure in recommending that the names of\r\ntwo ladies distinguished in different walks of astronomy be placed on\r\nthe list of honorary members. On the propriety of such a step, in an\r\nastronomical point of view, there can be but one voice; and your council\r\nis of the opinion that the time is gone by when either feeling or\r\nprejudice, by whichever name it may be proper to call it, should be\r\nallowed to interfere with the payment of a well-earned tribute of\r\nrespect. Your council has hitherto felt that, whatever might be its own\r\nsentiment on the subject, or however able and willing it might be to\r\ndefend such a measure, it had no right to place the name of a lady in a\r\nposition the propriety of which might be contested, though upon what it\r\nmight consider narrow grounds and false principles. But your council has\r\nno fear that such a difference could now take place between any men\r\nwhose opinion could avail to guide the society at large; and, abandoning\r\ncompliment on the one hand and false delicacy on the other, submits\r\nthat, while the tests of astronomical merit should in no case be applied\r\nto the works of a woman less severely than to those of a man, the sex of\r\nthe former should no longer be an obstacle to her receiving any\r\nacknowledgment which might be held due to the latter. And your council,\r\ntherefore, recommends this meeting to add to the list of honorary\r\nmembers the names of Miss Caroline Herschel and Mrs. Somerville, of\r\nwhose astronomical knowledge, and of the utility of the ends to which it\r\nhas been applied, it is not necessary to recount the proofs.\"[148]\r\n\r\nThree years after this splendid recognition of Miss Herschel's\r\nastronomical labors she was elected an honorary member of the Royal\r\nIrish Academy.\r\n\r\nBut exceptional as were the honors conferred on her by sovereigns and\r\nlearned societies, none of them afforded her the extreme satisfaction\r\nthat she experienced on the receipt of a copy, shortly before her death,\r\nof her nephew's epochal _Cape Observations_; for, as has well been said,\r\n\"nothing in the power of man to bestow could have given such pleasure on\r\nher death-bed as this last crowning completion of her brother's work.\"\r\nWe are told that a copy, just from the press, of his immortal work, _De\r\nOrbium Celestium Revolutionibus_, in which he had established the\r\nheliocentric theory of the planetary system, was placed in the hands of\r\nCopernicus on the day of his death, just a few hours before he expired.\r\nHe seemed conscious of what it was; but, after touching it and\r\ncontemplating it for a moment, he lapsed into a state of insensibility\r\nwhich soon terminated in death. With Miss Herschel the case was\r\ndifferent. Although in her ninety-seventh year, she still retained\r\npossession of all her faculties and was fully able to appreciate the\r\nvolume which told of the crowning of her brother's life work--a volume\r\nwhich must have given her additional satisfaction when she recalled her\r\nfifty years of loyal service at her brother's side as his associate and\r\nministering angel in the greatest work ever undertaken by a single man\r\nin the history of astronomy.\r\n\r\nCaroline Herschel died at the advanced age of ninety-seven years and ten\r\nmonths, retaining to the last her interest in astronomy which had\r\noccupied her mind for more than three-quarters of a century.\r\n\r\nHer epitaph, composed by herself, is engraved on a heavy stone slab\r\nwhich covers her grave and contains the following words: \"The eyes of\r\nher who is glorified were here below turned to the starry heavens. Her\r\nown discoveries of comets and her participation in the immortal labors\r\nof her brother, William Herschel, bear witness of this to future ages.\"\r\n\r\nSpace precludes any extended reference to Miss Herschel's distinguished\r\nassociate in the Royal Astronomical Society, Mrs. Somerville, whose\r\nmasterly translation and exposition of Laplace's _Mecanique Celeste_\r\nsecured for her so enviable a place among the mathematicians of her\r\ntime, and placed all English students of mathematical astronomy under\r\nsuch deep obligations. It is true that she ever manifested a lively\r\ninterest in celestial phenomena; but it is rather as a mathematician\r\nthan as an astronomer that she will be remembered by the devotees of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe first American woman to win distinction in astronomy was Miss Maria\r\nMitchell. Born in the island of Nantucket in 1818, she, at an early age,\r\ndisplayed remarkable talent for astronomy and mathematics. Her first\r\ninstructor was her father, who, besides being a school teacher, had\r\nfrom his youth been an enthusiastic student of astronomy, and that, too,\r\nat a time when very little attention was given to its study in this\r\ncountry, and when the observatory of Harvard College consisted of only a\r\nlittle projection to an old mansion in Cambridge, in which there was a\r\nsmall telescope.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirteen little Maria counted seconds by the chronometer\r\nfor her father while he observed the annular eclipse of the sun in 1831;\r\nand from that time on she was his assiduous co-worker in the study of\r\nthe heavens. After teaching school for some years, she became the\r\nlibrarian of the Nantucket Atheneum, a position which she held for\r\nnearly twenty years. Here she continued the study of her favorite\r\nscience, and read all the books on astronomy which she could obtain. It\r\nwas during this period that she read Bowditch's translation of Laplace's\r\n_Mecanique Celeste_ and Gauss's _Theoria Motus Corporum Caelestium_ in\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of October 1, 1847, she was the discoverer of a comet\r\nthat attracted great attention because it secured for her a medal\r\noffered by the King of Denmark in 1831 for the first one who should\r\ndiscover a telescopic comet. The same comet was observed by Father de\r\nVico in Rome two days subsequently, by Dawes in England on October\r\nseventh, and by Madame Ruemker, wife of the director of the observatory\r\nof Hamburg, on the eleventh of the same month. As there was no Atlantic\r\ncable in those days, it was not known who was the fortunate winner of\r\nthe prize until nearly a year afterward, when word was received from\r\nDenmark announcing that the priority of Miss Mitchell's discovery had\r\nbeen recognized and that she would be the recipient of the prize, which,\r\nfor a while, it was thought would go to De Vico or Madame Ruemker.[149]\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Miss Mitchell was appointed a compiler for the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_, a position she held for nineteen years. During the same period\r\nshe was employed by the United States Coast Survey.\r\n\r\nWhen Vassar College was opened in 1865 for the higher education of\r\nwomen, Miss Mitchell was called to fill the chair of astronomy and to be\r\nthe first director of the observatory. In this position she soon\r\nsucceeded in giving astronomy a prominence that it never had had before\r\nin any other college for women, and in but few for men.\r\n\r\nMiss Mitchell was a member of several learned societies and the author\r\nof a number of papers containing the results of her observations on\r\nJupiter and Saturn and their satellites. But she is notable chiefly for\r\nbeing the first woman astronomer in the United States and for training\r\nup a number of young women who have followed in her footsteps as\r\nenthusiastic astronomers. She held her position at Vassar until 1889,\r\nwhen she died, a few months before her seventy-first birthday.\r\n\r\nSince the pioneer days of Miss Caroline Herschel, the number of women\r\nthroughout the world who have achieved distinction in astronomy has\r\nrapidly augmented. One of the most noted of these was Caterina\r\nScarpellini, niece of Feliciano Scarpellini, professor of astronomy in\r\nRome, restorer of the Academy of the Lyncei, and founder of the\r\nCapitoline Observatory. Born in 1808, she manifested at an early age a\r\ndecided taste for astronomy, which was carefully developed by her uncle.\r\nShe it was who organized the Meteorologico Ozonometric station in Rome\r\nand edited its monthly bulletin. She exhibited a special interest in\r\nshooting stars and prepared the first catalogue of these meteors\r\nobserved in Italy. In 1854 she discovered a comet. She has also left\r\nvaluable studies on the probable influence of the moon on\r\nearthquakes--studies which brought her distinction from several of the\r\nlearned societies of Europe. In 1872 the Italian government decreed her\r\na gold medal for her statistical labors in science. Since her death her\r\ncountrymen have recognized the value of her contributions to science by\r\nerecting a statue to her memory.\r\n\r\nAnother woman who has won enduring fame in the annals of astronomy is\r\nMiss Dorothea Klumpke, of San Francisco. While yet quite young, she and\r\nher sisters were taken to Europe to be educated. There she soon became\r\nproficient in a number of languages, and then devoted herself to the\r\nstudy of mathematics and astronomy. After securing her baccalaureate and\r\nlicentiate in Paris, she applied for admission as a student to the Paris\r\nobservatory. \"The directors of the observatory consulted the statutes.\r\nNo woman had hitherto proposed herself as a colleague, but there was no\r\nrule opposing it. They themselves approved, and gave her a telescope to\r\nmake her own observations. After a time she completed the work begun by\r\nMme. Kovalevsky on the rings of Saturn, which she made the subject of\r\nher thesis, and, when she had become Doctor of Science, she was given a\r\ndecoration by the Institute and made an _Officier de l'Academie_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Klumpke had brilliantly defended her thesis in the Sorbonne,\r\nM. Darboux, the president of the jury, complimented the young American\r\ndoctor on her splendid work and concluded a notable address in her honor\r\nin the following laudatory words:\r\n\r\n\"The great names of Galileo, of Huyghens, of Cassini, of Laplace,\r\nwithout speaking of those of my illustrious colleagues and friends, are\r\nattached to the history of every serious step forward made in this\r\nattractive and difficult theory of Saturn's rings. Your work constitutes\r\nanother valuable contribution to the same subject and places you in an\r\nhonorable rank beside those women who have consecrated themselves to the\r\nstudy of mathematics. In the last century Maria Agnesi gave us a\r\ntreatise on the differential and integral calculus. Since then Sophie\r\nGermain, as remarkable for her literary and philosophical talent as for\r\nher faculty for mathematics, won the esteem of the great geometricians\r\nwho honored our country at the commencement of this century. It is but a\r\nfew years since the Academy awarded one of its most beautiful prizes\r\nwhich will place the name of Mme. Kovalevsky beside those of Euler and\r\nLagrange in the history of discoveries relative to the theory of the\r\nmovement of a solid body about a fixed point.... And you, mademoiselle,\r\nyour thesis is the first which a woman has presented and successfully\r\ndefended before our faculty for the degree of doctor in mathematics. You\r\nworthily open the way, and the faculty unanimously makes haste to\r\ndeclare you worthy of obtaining the degree of doctor.\"\r\n\r\nBesides her thesis just referred to, Miss Klumpke is the author of\r\nnumerous communications to scientific journals and learned societies\r\nregarding her researches on the spectra of stars and meteorites and\r\nother allied subjects. For many years she was at the head of the bureau\r\nin the Paris Observatory for measuring the photographic plates that are\r\nto be used in the large catalogue of stars and map of the heavens which\r\nare to constitute the crowning achievements of the International\r\nAstronomical Congress. She was the first woman to be elected a member of\r\nthe Astronomical Society of France, and the character of her work as an\r\nobserver as well as a computer has given her an enviable position among\r\nthe astronomers of the world.[150]\r\n\r\nIn America another woman has won renown among astronomers by\r\nsuccessfully executing the same kind of work as was entrusted to Miss\r\nDorothea Klumpke in Paris. For many years Mrs. W. Fleming, with her\r\nlarge corps of women assistants, had charge of the immense collection of\r\nastronomical photographs in the Observatory of Harvard University. To\r\nher and her staff were assigned the reductions and measurements of the\r\nphotographic and photometric work done in Cambridge and Arequipa, Peru.\r\nShe was singularly successful in her studies of photographic plates and\r\nmade many discoveries which astronomers regard of the greatest\r\nimportance. By such studies she and her assistants detected many new\r\nnebulae, double and variable stars, besides spectra of different types\r\nand of rare interest. In addition to this they examined and classified\r\ntens of thousands of photographs of stellar spectra, a labor which\r\ninvolved countless details of reduction and measurements of exceeding\r\ndelicacy and skill.\r\n\r\nA complete list of the women who, during the past half century, have\r\ndevoted themselves to the study of astronomy and who have contributed to\r\nits advancement by their observations and writings would be a very long\r\none. Among those, however, whose labors have attracted special notice,\r\nmention must be made of the Misses Antonia C. Maury, Florence Cushman,\r\nLouisa D. Wells, Mabel C. Stephens, Eva F. Leland, Anna Winlock, Annie\r\nJ. Cannon and Henrietta S. Leavitt, all of whom are on the staff of the\r\nHarvard Observatory.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there are many women who occupy important positions as\r\nprofessors or assistant professors in our colleges and universities.\r\nChief among these in the United States are Sarah F. Whiting, of\r\nWellesley; Mary W. Whitney, of Vassar; Mary E. Boyd, of Smith; Susan\r\nCunningham, of Swarthmore, and Annie S. Young, of Mt. Holyoke. Nor must\r\nwe forget such able computers as Mrs. Margaretta Palmer, of Yale, and\r\nMiss Hanna Mace, the clever assistant of the late Simon Newcomb in the\r\nNaval Observatory in Washington.\r\n\r\nIn the Old World among the women who, during the last few decades, have\r\nmaterially contributed to the progress of astronomy, either as observers\r\nand computers or as writers, are Miss Alice Everett, who has done\r\nsplendid work in the observatories of Greenwich and Potsdam, Misses M.\r\nA. Orr, Mary Ashley, Alice Brown, Mary Proctor--daughter of the late\r\nastronomer, R. A. Proctor--Agnes M. and Ellen M. Clerke, and Lady\r\nHuggins, of England; Mmes. Jansen, Faye, and Flammarion, in France; the\r\nCountess Bobinski, in Russia; and Miss Pogson, in the Observatory of\r\nMadras, India.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is but just to observe that women's work in astronomy\r\nhas by no means been confined to their contributions as observers,\r\nwriters and computers. Reference must also be made to the financial aid\r\nwhich they have given to various observatories and learned societies for\r\nthe furtherance of astronomical research both in the New and the Old\r\nWorld. It must suffice here to recall the endowment at Harvard\r\nUniversity of the Henry Draper Memorial, by Mrs. Henry Draper, in order\r\nthat the work of photographing stellar spectra, which occupied her\r\nhusband's later years, might be continued under the most favorable\r\nauspices, and the munificent sum of fifty thousand dollars given by Miss\r\nC. Bruce, of New York, for the construction of a large telescope\r\nespecially designed for photographing faint stars and nebulae. The\r\nphotographs taken with this instrument will be used in the preparation\r\nof the great chart of the heavens which is to be the joint production of\r\nthe chief observatories of the world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[134] Cf. the preceding chapter, p. 140.

Her\r\nmanner of dressing her hair, her adornments, her top-knots, her jewelry,\r\nall are in profusion; but, as she wishes to be lovely in spite of\r\nnature, and as she wishes to appear magnificent in spite of fortune, she\r\nis obliged, in order to obtain superfluities, to go without necessaries\r\nsuch as under-garments and other trifles.\r\n\r\n\"She was born with sufficient intellect, and the desire to appear as\r\nthough she had a great deal made her prefer to study the most abstract\r\nsciences rather than more general and pleasant branches of knowledge.\r\nShe thought she would gain a greater reputation by this peculiarity and\r\na more decided superiority over other women.\r\n\r\n\"She did not limit herself to this ambition. She wished to be a princess\r\nas well, and she became so, not by the grace of God nor by that of the\r\nKing, but by her own act. This absurdity went on like the others. One\r\nbecame accustomed to regard her as a princess of the theatre, and one\r\nalmost forgot that she was a woman of rank.\r\n\r\n\"Madame worked so hard to appear what she was not that no one knew what\r\nshe really was. Even her faults were perhaps not natural. They may have\r\nhad something to do with her pretensions, her want of respect with\r\nregard to the state of princess, her dullness in that of _savante_, and\r\nher stupidity in that of a _jolie femme_.\r\n\r\n\"However much of a celebrity Mme. du Chatelet may be, she would not be\r\nsatisfied if she were not celebrated, and that is what she desired in\r\nbecoming the friend of M. de Voltaire. To him she owes the _eclat_ of\r\nher life, and it is to him that she will owe immortality.\" See _Lettres\r\nde la Marquise du Deffand a Horace Walpole_, Tom. I, pp. 200-201, Paris,\r\n1824.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to this atrocious caricature, it is but due to the memory\r\nof Mme. du Chatelet to give her portrait by Voltaire, to whom she was\r\never the beautiful, the charming Urania, the\r\n\r\n                    \"Vaste et puissante genie,\r\n    Minerve de la France, immortelle Emilie.\"\r\n\r\nIt is contained in the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"L'esprit sublime et la delicatesse,\r\n    L'oubli charmante de sa propre beaute\r\n    L'amitie tendre et l'amour emporte\r\n      Sont les attraits de ma belle maitresse.\"\r\n\r\nIf the whole truth were known, it would, doubtless, be found somewhere\r\nbetween the above extreme and contradictory views, and the cause of the\r\ncaustic statements of Mesdames de Stael and du Deffand would probably be\r\nfound to be quite accurately expressed in the first part of Voltaire's\r\n_Epistle on Calumny_, which was written about the beginning of his\r\nparticular relationship with \"the divine Emilie.\" The first lines of\r\nthis epistle, as translated by Smollett, are:\r\n\r\n    \"Since beautiful, 'twill be your fate,\r\n    Emelia, to incur much hate;\r\n    Almost one-half of human race\r\n    Will even curse you to your face;\r\n    Possesst of genius, noblest fire,\r\n    With fear you will each breast inspire;\r\n    As you too easily confide,\r\n    You'll often be betrayed, belied;\r\n    You ne'er of virtue made parade,\r\n    To hypocrites no court you've paid,\r\n    Therefore, of Calumny beware,\r\n    Foe to the virtuous and the fair.\"\r\n\r\n[143] In his work on _Comets_, Clairaut at first gave Mme. Lepaute full\r\ncredit for her work which had been of such inestimable service to\r\nhimself; but, in order to gratify a woman who, having pretensions\r\nwithout knowledge, was very jealous of the superior attainments of Mme.\r\nLepaute, he had the weakness subsequently to suppress his generous\r\ntribute to merit. Commenting on this strange conduct of his assistant,\r\nLalande expresses himself as follows: \"We know that it is not rare to\r\nsee ordinary women depreciate those who have knowledge, tax them with\r\npedantry and contest their merit in order to avenge themselves upon them\r\nfor their superiority. The latter are so few in number that the others\r\nhave almost succeeded in making them conceal their acquirements.\"\r\n\r\n[144] _Bibliographie Astronomique_, pp. 676-687, par Jerome de la Lande,\r\nParis, 1803.\r\n\r\n[145] _Memoirs and Correspondence of Caroline Herschel_, p. 144, by Mrs.\r\nJohn Herschel, London, 1879.\r\n\r\n[146] So sensitive was Miss Herschel in her old age regarding the\r\nreputation of her brother, William, who had always been her idol and the\r\none in whom she had concentrated all her affection, that she came to\r\nlook askance at every person and thing that seemed calculated to dull\r\nthe glory of his achievements. Thus her niece, in writing to Sir John\r\nHerschel, after her death, declares: \"She looked upon progress in\r\nscience as so much detraction from her brother's fame; and, even your\r\ninvestigations would have become a source of estrangement had she been\r\nwith you.\" In a letter to Sir John Herschel, written four years before\r\nher death, she exhibits, in an amusing fashion, her jealous spirit anent\r\nthe great telescope of Lord Rosse. \"They talk of nothing here at the\r\nclubs,\" she writes, \"but of the great mirror and the great man who made\r\nit. I have but one answer for all--_Der Kerl ist ein Narr_--the fellow\r\nis a fool.\"\r\n\r\nEven \"Every word said in her own praise seemed to be so much taken away\r\nfrom the honour due to her brother. She had lived so many years in\r\ncompanionship with a truly great man, and in the presence of the\r\nunfathomable depths of the starry heavens, that praise of herself seemed\r\nchildish exaggeration.\" And notwithstanding the honor and recognition\r\nwhich she received from learned men and learned societies for her truly\r\nremarkable astronomical labors, her dominant idea was always the\r\nsame--\"I am nothing. I have done nothing. All I am, all I know, I owe to\r\nmy brother. I am only a tool which he shaped to his use--a well-trained\r\npuppy-dog would have done as much.\" Op. cit., pp. IX, 335 and 346.\r\n\r\n[147] Op. cit., p. 224.\r\n\r\n[148] _Memoirs and Correspondence of Caroline Herschel_, ut. sup., pp.\r\n226-227.\r\n\r\n[149] _Maria Mitchell, Life, Letters and Journals_, compiled by Phebe\r\nMitchell Kendall, p. 267 et seq., Boston, 1896.\r\n\r\n[150] Miss Klumpke, the reader may be interested in knowing, belongs to\r\na singularly gifted family. Her sister, Augusta, is a distinguished\r\nphysician and an authority on nervous diseases. Hers is the glory to be\r\nthe first woman permitted, after an exceptionally severe examination, to\r\nserve as _interne_ in the Paris hospitals. Julia, her youngest sister,\r\nwho achieved distinction as a violinist with Ysaye, was one of the first\r\nto pass the examination required of women entering the Paris _Lycees_,\r\nwhile Anna, the eldest, has won fame as an artist, and as the friend,\r\nheiress and executrix of France's famous daughter, Rosa Bonheur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN PHYSICS\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysics, being one of the inductive sciences, received little attention\r\nuntil modern times. True, the Greeks were familiar with some of the\r\nfundamental facts of the mechanics of solids and fluids, and had some\r\nnotions respecting the various physical forces; but their knowledge of\r\nwhat until recently was known as natural philosophy was extremely\r\nlimited. Aristotle, Pythagoras and Archimedes were among the most\r\nsuccessful investigators of their time respecting the laws and\r\nproperties of matter, and contributed materially to the advancement of\r\nknowledge regarding the phenomena of the material universe; but the sum\r\ntotal of their information of what we now know as physics could be\r\nembodied in a few pages.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing facts, we should not expect to find women\r\nengaged in the study, much less in the teaching, of physical science\r\nduring ancient times. And yet, if we are to credit Boccaccio, who bases\r\nhis statements on those of early Greek writers, there was at least one\r\nwoman that won distinction by her knowledge of natural philosophy as\r\nearly as the days of Socrates. In his work, _De Laudibus Mulierum_,\r\nwhich treats of the achievements of some of the illustrious\r\nrepresentatives of the gentler sex, the genial author of the _Decameron_\r\ngives special praise to one Arete of Cyrene for the breadth and variety\r\nof her attainments. She was the daughter of Aristippus, the founder of\r\nthe Cyrenaic school of philosophy, and is represented as being a\r\nveritable prodigy of learning. For among her many claims to distinction\r\nshe is said to have publicly taught natural and moral philosophy in the\r\nschools and academies of Attica for thirty-five years, to have written\r\nforty books, and to have counted among her pupils one hundred and ten\r\nphilosophers. She was so highly esteemed by her countrymen that they\r\ninscribed on her tomb an epitaph which declared that she was the\r\nsplendor of Greece and possessed the beauty of Helen, the virtue of\r\nThirma, the pen of Aristippus, the soul of Socrates, and the tongue of\r\nHomer.[151]\r\n\r\nThis is high praise, indeed, but, when we recollect that Arete lived\r\nduring the golden age of Greek learning and culture, that she had\r\nexceptional opportunities of acquiring knowledge in every department of\r\nintellectual effort; when we recall the large number of women who, in\r\ntheir time, distinguished themselves by their learning and\r\naccomplishment, and reflect on the advantages they enjoyed as pupils of\r\nthe ablest teachers of the Lyceum, the Portico, and the Academy; when we\r\nremember further that they lived in an atmosphere of intelligence such\r\nas has since been unknown; when we call to mind the signal success that\r\nrewarded the pursuit of knowledge by the scores of women mentioned by\r\nAthenaeus and other Greek writers; when we peruse the fragmentary notices\r\nof their achievements as recorded in the pages of more recent\r\ninvestigators regarding the educational facilities of a certain class\r\nof women living in Athens and the eminence which they attained in\r\nscience, philosophy and literature, we can realize that the character\r\nand amount of Arete's work as an author and as a teacher have not been\r\noverestimated.\r\n\r\nLiving in an age of prodigious mental activity, when women, as well as\r\nmen, were actuated by an abiding love of knowledge for its own sake,\r\nthere is nothing surprising in finding a woman like Arete commanding the\r\nadmiration of her countrymen by her learning and eloquence. For was not\r\nthe learned and eloquent Aspasia her contemporary? And did not Theano,\r\nthe wife of Pythagoras, take charge of her husband's school after his\r\ndeath; and does not antiquity credit her with being not only a\r\nsuccessful teacher of philosophy, but also a writer of books of\r\nrecognized value? Such being the case, what is there incredible in the\r\nstatements made by ancient writers regarding the literary activity of\r\nArete, and about her eminence as a teacher of science and philosophy?\r\nShe was but one of many of the Greek women of her age that won renown by\r\ntheir gifts of intellect and by their contributions to the educational\r\nwork of their time and country.\r\n\r\nBetter known than Arete, but probably not superior to her as a teacher\r\nor writer, was the illustrious Hypatia of Alexandria. She, too, like her\r\ndistinguished predecessor in Athens, was an instructor in natural\r\nphilosophy, as well as other branches of science. Of her we know more\r\nthan we do of the daughter of Aristippus, but even our knowledge of the\r\nacquisitions and achievements of Hypatia is, unfortunately, extremely\r\nmeager. We do, however, know from the historian, Socrates, and from\r\nSynesius, bishop of Ptolemais, who was her pupil, that she was one of\r\nthe most richly dowered women of all time. Born and educated in\r\nAlexandria when its schools and scholars were the most celebrated in the\r\nworld, she was even at an early age regarded as a marvel of learning.\r\nFor, not satisfied with excelling her father, Theon, in mathematics, of\r\nwhich he was a distinguished professor, she, as Suidas informs us,\r\ndevoted herself to the study of philosophy with such success that she\r\nwas soon regarded as the ablest living exponent of the doctrines of\r\nPlato and Aristotle. \"Her knowledge,\" writes the historian, Socrates,\r\n\"was so great that she far surpassed all the philosophers of her time.\r\nAnd succeeding Plotinus, in the Platonic school which he had founded in\r\nthe city of Alexandria, she taught all the branches of philosophy with\r\nsuch signal success that students flocked to her in crowds from all\r\nparts.\"[152] Her home, as well as her lecture room, was the resort of\r\nthe most noted scholars of the day, and was, with the exception of the\r\nLibrary and the Museum, the most frequented intellectual center of the\r\ngreat city of learning and culture. Small wonder, then, that her\r\ncontemporaries lauded her as an oracle and as the most brilliant\r\nluminary in Alexandria's splendid galaxy of thinkers and\r\nscholars--_sapientis artis sidus integerrimum_.\r\n\r\nAmong the many inventions attributed to Hypatia, besides the planisphere\r\nand astrolabe which she designed for the use of astronomers, are several\r\nemployed in the study of natural philosophy. Probably the most useful of\r\nthese is an areometer mentioned by her pupil Synesius. He calls it a\r\nhydroscope and describes it as having the form and size of a flute, and\r\ngraduated in such wise that it can be used for determining the density\r\nof liquids. That Hypatia was thoroughly familiar with the science of\r\nnatural philosophy, as then known, there can be no doubt. That she also\r\ncontributed materially to its advancement, as well as to that of\r\nastronomy, in which she always exhibited a special interest, there is\r\nevery reason to believe.[153]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Hypatia, the study of natural philosophy was almost\r\nentirely neglected for more than a thousand years. The first woman in\r\nmodern times to attract attention by her discussion of physical problems\r\nwas the famous Marquise du Chatelet, although she was better known as a\r\nmathematician and as the translator into the French of Newton's\r\n_Principia_. In her chateau at Cirey she had a well-equipped physical\r\ncabinet in which she took special delight. But in her time, as in that\r\nof Hypatia, natural philosophy was far from being the broad experimental\r\nscience which it has become through the marvelous discoveries made in\r\nheat, light, electricity and magnetism during the last hundred years, as\r\nwell as through those countless brilliant investigations which have led\r\nup to our present doctrine of the correlation and conservation of the\r\nvarious physical forces. There was then no occasion for those delicate\r\ninstruments of precision which are now found in every physical\r\nlaboratory by means of which the man of science is able to investigate\r\nphenomena and determine laws that were quite unknown until a few years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Mme. du Chatelet, as during the century following,\r\nnatural philosophy consisted rather in the mechanical and mathematical\r\nthan in the physical study of nature. This is illustrated by the title\r\nof the great work on the translation of which she spent the best years\r\nof her life--Newton's immortal _Philosophiae Naturalis Principia\r\nMathematica_.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise's first scientific work was an investigation regarding the\r\nnature of fire. The French Academy of Sciences had offered a prize for\r\nthe best memoir on the subject. Among the contestants for the coveted\r\nhonor were the chatelaine of Cirey and the celebrated Swiss\r\nmathematician, Leonard Euler. The Marquise was unsuccessful in the\r\ncontest, but her paper was of such value that the eminent physicist and\r\nastronomer, Arago, was able to characterize it as an \"elegant piece of\r\nwork, embracing all the facts relating to the subject then known to\r\nscience and containing among the experiments suggested one which proved\r\nso fecund in the hands of Herschel.\" In this remarkable _Memoire sur le\r\nFeu_, which is printed in the _Collections_ of the Academy, the Marquise\r\nanticipates the results of subsequent researches of others by\r\nmaintaining that both heat and light have the same cause, or, as we\r\nshould now say, are both modes of motion.\r\n\r\nThe second book written by this remarkable woman is entitled\r\n_Institutions de Physique_, and was dedicated to her son, for whose\r\nbenefit it was primarily written. It deals specially with the philosophy\r\nof Leibnitz and discusses such questions as force, time and space. Her\r\nviews respecting the nature of the force called _vis viva_, which was\r\nmuch discussed in her time, are of particular interest, as they are not\r\nonly opposed to those which were held by Descartes and Newton, but also\r\nbecause they are in essential accord with those now accepted in the\r\nworld of science.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, the Marquise du Chatelet deservedly takes high\r\nrank in the history of mathematical physics. In this department of\r\nscience she has had few, if any, superiors among her own sex. And, when\r\nwe recollect that she labored while the foundations of dynamics were\r\nstill being laid, we shall more readily appreciate the difficulties she\r\nhad to contend with and the distinct service which her researches and\r\nwritings rendered to the cause of natural philosophy among her\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe first woman to occupy a chair of physics in a university was the\r\nfamous daughter of Italy, Laura Maria Catarina Bassi. She was born in\r\nBologna in 1711--but five years after the birth of Madame du\r\nChatelet--and from her most tender years she exhibited an exceptional\r\nfacility for the acquisition of knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter she had, through the assistance of excellent masters, become\r\nproficient in French and Latin, she took up the study of logic,\r\nmetaphysics and natural philosophy. In all these branches of learning\r\nher progress was so rapid that it far exceeded the fondest expectations\r\nof her parents and teachers. Thanks to a wonderful memory and a highly\r\ndeveloped reasoning faculty, she was able, while still a young maiden,\r\nto prove herself the possessor of knowledge that is ordinarily obtained\r\nonly in the maturity of age and after long years of systematic study.\r\n\r\nWhen she had attained the twenty-first year of her age she was induced\r\nby her family and friends--much against her own inclination, however--to\r\ntake part in a public disputation on philosophy. Her entering the lists\r\nagainst some of the most distinguished scholars of the time was made the\r\noccasion for an unusual demonstration in her honor. The hall of the\r\nuniversity in which such intellectual jousts were generally held was too\r\nsmall for the multitude that was eager to witness the young girl's\r\nformal appearance among the scholars and the notables of the old\r\nuniversity city. It was, accordingly, arranged that the disputation\r\nshould be held in the great hall of the public Palace of the Senators.\r\n\r\nAmong the vast assemblage present at the disputation were Cardinal\r\nGrimaldi, the papal legate; Cardinal Archbishop Lambertini, afterwards\r\nPope Benedict XIV; the gonfalonier, senators, literati from far and\r\nnear, leading members of the nobility and representatives of all the\r\nreligious orders.\r\n\r\nWhen the argumentation began the young girl found herself pitted against\r\nfive of the most distinguished scholars of Bologna. But she was fully\r\nequal to the occasion and passed the ordeal to which she was subjected\r\nin a manner that excited the admiration and won the plaudits of all\r\npresent. Cardinal Lambertini was so impressed with the brilliant defence\r\nwhich she had made against the five trained dialecticians and the\r\nevidence she gave of varied and profound learning that he paid her a\r\nspecial visit the next day in her own home to renew his congratulations\r\non her signal triumph and to encourage her to continue the prosecution\r\nof her studies.\r\n\r\nIn less than a month after this interesting event Laura Bassi, in\r\nresponse to the expressed desire of the whole of Bologna, presented\r\nherself as a candidate for the doctorate in philosophy. This was the\r\noccasion for a still more brilliant and imposing ceremony. It was held\r\nin the spacious Hall of Hercules in the Communal Palace, which was\r\nmagnificently decorated for the splendid function. In addition to the\r\ndistinguished personages who had been spectators of the fair student's\r\ntriumph a few weeks before, there was present in the vast audience the\r\nnoted French ecclesiastic, Cardinal Polignac, who was on his way from\r\nRome to France.\r\n\r\nThe heroine of the hour, dressed in a black gown, was ushered into the\r\ngreat hall, preceded by two college beadles and accompanied by two of\r\nthe most prominent ladies of the Bolognese nobility. She was given a\r\nseat between the chancellor and the prior of the university, who, in\r\nturn, were flanked by the professors and officials of the institution.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual preliminaries of the function were over the prior of the\r\nuniversity, Doctor Bazzani, rose and pronounced an eloquent discourse in\r\nLatin to which Laura made a suitable response in the same language. She\r\nwas then crowned with a laurel wreath exquisitely wrought in silver, and\r\nhad thrown round her the _vajo_, or university gown, both symbols of the\r\ndoctorate. After this the young doctor proceeded to where the three\r\ncardinals were seated, and in delicately chosen words, also in Latin,\r\nexpressed to them her thanks for the honor of their presence. All then\r\nwithdrew to the apartments of the gonfalonier, where refreshments were\r\nserved in sumptuous style, after which the young _Laureata_, accompanied\r\nby a numerous cortege and applauded by the entire city, was escorted to\r\nher home.\r\n\r\nSo profound was the impression made on the university senate by the deep\r\nerudition of Laura Bassi that it was eager to secure her services in its\r\nteaching body. But, before she could be offered a chair in the\r\ninstitution, long-established custom required that she should pass a\r\npublic examination on the subject matter which she was to teach. Five\r\nexaminers were chosen by lot, and all of them proved to be men whose\r\nnames, says Fantuzzi, \"will always be held by our university in glorious\r\nremembrance.\" They had all to promise under oath that the candidate for\r\nthe chair should have no knowledge before the examination of the\r\nquestions which were to be asked, and that the test of the aspirant's\r\nqualifications to fill the position sought should be absolutely free\r\nfrom any suspicion of favoritism or partiality.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulties she had to confront, Laura acquitted\r\nherself with even greater credit than on former occasions of a similar\r\ncharacter. There was no question in the mind of any one present at the\r\nexamination of the candidate's ability to fill the chair of physics, and\r\nit was, accordingly, offered to her by acclamation.\r\n\r\nThe first public lecture of the gifted young _dottoressa_ was made the\r\noccasion of a demonstration such as the old walls of the university had\r\nrarely witnessed. Her lecture room was thronged by the elite of the\r\ncity, as well as by a large class of enthusiastic students. All were\r\ncharmed by her eloquence and amazed at the complete mastery she evinced\r\nof the subject she had selected for discussion. From that day forth her\r\nreputation as a scholar and a teacher was established, and her lectures\r\nwere attended by appreciative students from all parts of Europe. She\r\nwas especially popular with the students from Greece, Germany and\r\nPoland, and her popularity, far from waning, waxed greater with the\r\npassing years.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Laura's entering upon her professional career the senate\r\nof Bologna had a medal coined in her honor, on the obverse of which was\r\nher name and effigy, while on the reverse there was an image of Minerva,\r\nwith the inscription, _Soli cui fas vidisse Minervam_.\r\n\r\nFar from interrupting her studies, which had hitherto been the joy of\r\nher life, Laura's university work gave new zest to the literary and\r\nscientific pursuits which had always such a fascination for her. Among\r\nthe subjects that specially engaged her attention were studies so\r\ndiverse as Greek and the higher mathematics. She was particularly\r\ninterested in the great physico-mathematical work of Newton, and did not\r\nrest until she had thoroughly mastered the contents of his epoch-making\r\n_Principia_.\r\n\r\nA few years after she had become a member of the university faculty\r\nLaura was a European celebrity, and no one eminent by learning or birth\r\npassed through Bologna without availing himself of the opportunity of\r\nmaking the acquaintance of so extraordinary a woman. Men of science and\r\nletters vied with princes and emperors in doing honor to one who was\r\nlooked upon by many as being, like Arete of old, endowed with a soul and\r\na genius far above that of ordinary mortals, and as being the possessor\r\nof a talent that indicated something superhuman.\r\n\r\nLaura Bassi was in constant correspondence with the most celebrated\r\nscholars of Europe, and more especially with those who had attained\r\neminence in her special line of work. Among the letters received from\r\nher illustrious correspondents were two from Voltaire. They were written\r\nshortly after the author had been refused admittance into the French\r\nacademy. He then bethought himself of securing membership in the Academy\r\nof Sciences of Bologna. This, he reasoned, would be a splendid tribute\r\nto the versatility of his genius and would, at the same time, be a\r\nbiting satire on the demigods of French literature who had dared to\r\nexclude him from their society.\r\n\r\nThat he might not meet the same refusal on the part of the Academy of\r\nBologna as he had experienced in Paris, Voltaire determined not to rely\r\nentirely on the good will of the male members of the Bolognese academy.\r\nHe accordingly resolved to enlist the services of Laura Bassi, who was\r\none of the leading members of this distinguished body, and trust to her\r\ninfluence in his behalf on the hearts of her colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe first letter, written in Italian, is so characteristic of the writer\r\nthat it will bear reproduction.\r\n\r\n\"Most Illustrious Lady,\" he writes from Paris, the 23d of November,\r\n1744, \"I have been wishing to journey to Bologna in order to be able one\r\nday to tell my countrymen I have seen Signora Bassi; but, being deprived\r\nof this honor, let it at least be permitted me to place at your feet\r\nthis philosophic homage and to salute the honor of her age and of women.\r\nThere is not a Bassi in London, and I should be more happy to be a\r\nmember of the Academy of Bologna than of that of the English, although\r\nit has produced a Newton. If your protection should obtain for me this\r\ntitle, of which I am so ambitious, the gratitude of my heart will be\r\nequal to my admiration for yourself. I beg you to excuse the style of a\r\nforeigner who presumes to write you in Italian, but who is as great an\r\nadmirer of yours as if he were born in Bologna.\"\r\n\r\nThe second letter of Voltaire is in response to one received from Laura\r\nBassi announcing that he had been elected to membership in the Bologna\r\nAcademy. The first sentence of it suffices to indicate its tenor.\r\n\"Nothing,\" he writes, \"was ever more grateful to me than to receive from\r\nyour hand the first advice that I had the honor, by means of your favor,\r\nof being united by this new link to one who had already bound me to her\r\ncar by all the chains of esteem and admiration.\"[154]\r\n\r\nLike so many of her gifted sisters of sunny Italy, Laura was in every\r\nway \"a perfect woman nobly planned.\" Of a deeply religious nature, she\r\nwas as pious as she was intelligent, and was throughout her life the\r\ndevoted friend of the poor and the afflicted. The mother of twelve\r\nchildren, she never permitted her scientific and literary work to\r\nconflict with her domestic duties or to detract in the least from the\r\nsingular affection which so closely united her to her husband and\r\nchildren. She was as much at home with the needle and the spindle as she\r\nwas with her books and the apparatus of her laboratory. And she was\r\nequally admirable whether superintending her household, looking after\r\nher children, entertaining the great and the learned of the world, or in\r\nholding the rapt attention of her students in the lecture room. She was,\r\nindeed, a living proof that higher education is not incompatible with\r\nwoman's natural avocations; and that cerebral development does not lead\r\nto race suicide and all the other dire results attributed to it by a\r\ncertain class of our modern sociologists and anti-feminists.\r\n\r\nConsidering her manifold duties as a professor in the university and the\r\nmother of a large family, it was scarcely to be expected that Laura\r\nBassi would have much time for writing for the press. She was, however,\r\nable to devote some of her leisure moments to the cultivation of the\r\nMuses, of whom, Fantuzzi informs us, she was a favorite. Her verses, as\r\nwell as her contributions to the science of physics, are scattered\r\nthrough various publications, but they suffice to show that the accounts\r\nof her transmitted to us by her contemporaries were not\r\nexaggerated.[155]\r\n\r\nA learned French traveler who visited Laura in Bologna describes her as\r\nhaving a face that was sweet, serious and modest. Her eyes were dark and\r\nsparkling, and she was blessed with a powerful memory, a solid judgment,\r\nand a ready imagination. \"She conversed fluently with me in Latin for an\r\nhour with grace and precision. She is very proficient in metaphysics;\r\nbut she prefers modern physics, particularly that of Newton.\"\r\n\r\nHow many of our college women of to-day could readily carry on a\r\nconversation in Latin, if this were the sole medium of communication, or\r\ndiscuss the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle in the tongue of Cicero,\r\nor give public lectures on the physico-mathematical discoveries of\r\nDescartes and Newton in what was the universal language of the learned\r\nworld, even less than a century ago?\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be inferred from the foregoing statements\r\nregarding the great intellectual capacity of Laura Bassi or the\r\nenthusiastic demonstrations that were so frequently made in her honor\r\nthat she was unique in this respect among her countrywomen. Special\r\nattention has been called to her as a type of the large number of her\r\nsex who, by their learning and culture, graced the courts and honored\r\nthe universities of her country for full ten centuries. Scarcely had\r\ndeath removed Laura Bassi from a career in which for twenty-eight years\r\nshe had won the plaudits of the whole of Europe, when the University of\r\nBologna welcomed to its learned halls two other women who, in their\r\nrespective lines of research, were fully as eminent as their departed\r\ncountrywoman. These were Maria dalle Donne, for whom Napoleon\r\nestablished a chair of obstetrics, and Clotilda Tambroni, the famous\r\nprofessor of Greek, of whom a noted Hellenist declared, \"Only three\r\npersons in Europe are able to write Greek as well as she does, and not\r\nmore than fifteen are able to understand her.\"\r\n\r\nBurckhardt, in his thoughtful work on the culture of the Italian\r\nRenaissance, has a paragraph which expresses, in a few words, what was\r\nalways the attitude of the Italian father toward the education of his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\"The education of the woman of the upper class was absolutely the same\r\nas that of the man. The Italian of the Renaissance did not for a moment\r\nhesitate to give his son and daughter the same literary and\r\nphilosophical training. He considered the knowledge of the works of\r\nantiquity life's greatest good, and he could not, therefore, deny to\r\nwoman participation in such knowledge. Hence the perfection attained by\r\nthe daughters of noble families in writing and speaking Latin.\"[156]\r\n\r\nThis attitude of the members of the nobility toward the education of\r\ntheir daughters was essentially the same as that of the universities of\r\nItaly toward women who had a thirst for knowledge. For from the dawn of\r\nlearning in Salerno to the present there never was a time when women\r\nwere not as cordially welcomed to the universities as students and\r\nprofessors as were the men; and never a time when the merit of\r\nintellectual work was not determined without regard to sex.\r\n\r\nIn Bologna, where were passed the sixty-seven years of her mortal life,\r\nthe name of Laura Bassi, like that of her illustrious colleague, Luigi\r\nGalvani, is one to conjure with, and a name that is still pronounced\r\nwith respect and reverence. Her last resting place is in the Church of\r\nCorpus Domini, the same sacred shrine in which were deposited all that\r\nwas mortal of the renowned discoverer of galvanic electricity.[157]\r\n\r\nTwo years after Signora Bassi was gathered to her fathers there was born\r\nnear Edinburgh to a Scotch admiral, Sir William George Fairfax, an\r\ninfant daughter who was destined to shed as much luster on her sex in\r\nthe British Isles as the incomparable Laura Bassi had diffused on\r\nwomankind in Italy during her brilliant career in \"Bologna, the\r\nlearned.\" She is known in the annals of science as Mary Somerville, and\r\nwas in every way a worthy successor of her famous sister in Italy, both\r\nas a woman and as a votary of science.\r\n\r\nAlthough her chief title to fame is her notable work in mathematical\r\nastronomy, especially her translation of Laplace's _Mechanique Celeste_,\r\nshe is likewise to be accorded a prominent place among scientific\r\ninvestigators for her contributions to physics and cognate branches of\r\nknowledge. Chief among these are her works on the _Connection of the\r\nPhysical Sciences_ and _Physical Geography_. As to the last production,\r\nno less an authority than Alexander von Humboldt pronounced it an exact\r\nand admirable treatise, and wrote of it as \"that excellent work which\r\nhas charmed and instructed me since its first appearance.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter from the illustrious German savant to the gifted authoress\r\nof the two last-named volumes occurs the following paragraph: \"To the\r\ngreat superiority you possess and which has so nobly illustrated your\r\nname on the high regions of mathematical analysis, you add, Madam, a\r\nvariety of information in all parts of physics and descriptive natural\r\nhistory. After the _Mechanism of the Heavens_, the philosophical\r\n_Connection of the Physical Sciences_ has been the object of my profound\r\nadmiration.... The author of the vast _Cosmos_ should more than any one\r\nelse salute the _Physical Geography_ of Mary Somerville.... I know of\r\nno work on physical geography in any language that can compare with\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the other works by Mrs. Somerville, treating of physical subjects\r\nor of subjects intimately related to physics are _The Form and Rotation\r\nof the Earth_, _The Tides of the Ocean and Atmosphere_, and an abstruse\r\ninvestigation _On Molecular and Microscopic Science_. The last volume\r\nwas published in 1869, when its author was near her ninetieth year, and\r\nbore as its motto St. Augustine's sublime words: _Deus magnus in magnis,\r\nmaximus in minimis_--God is great in great things, greatest in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Somerville's death, in 1872, at the advanced age of\r\nninety-two, the number of women who devoted themselves to the study and\r\nteaching of physics was greatly augmented. The brilliant success of\r\nLaura Bassi and Mary Somerville had not been without results, and their\r\nnotable achievements as authors and teachers had the effect of\r\nstimulating women everywhere to emulate their example, and encouraging\r\nthem to devote more attention to a branch of science which, until then,\r\nhad been regarded by the general public as beyond the sphere and\r\ncapacity of what was assumed to be the intellectually weaker sex.\r\n\r\nOne of the most eminent scientific women of the present day in England\r\nis Mrs. Ayrton, the wife of the late Professor W. E. Ayrton, the\r\nwell-known electrician. Her chosen field of research, like that of her\r\nhusband, has been electricity, in which she has achieved marked\r\ndistinction. Her investigations on the electric arc and on the sand\r\nripples of the seashore won for her the first medal ever awarded to a\r\nwoman by the Royal Society. When, however, in 1902, she was formally\r\nnominated for fellowship in this same society, she failed of election\r\nbecause the council of the society discovered that \"it had no legal\r\npower to elect a married woman to this distinction.\"\r\n\r\nHow different it was in the case of Laura Bassi, who was an active\r\nmember of all the leading scientific and literary societies of Italy,\r\nwhere from time immemorial women have been as cordially welcomed to\r\nmembership in its learned societies as to the chairs of its great\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nThe list of the women who in Europe and America are now engaged in\r\nphysical research and in teaching physics in schools and colleges is a\r\nlong one, and the work accomplished by them is, in many cases, of a high\r\norder of merit. It is only, indeed, during the present generation that\r\nsuch work has been made generally accessible to them; and, considering\r\nthe success which has already attended their efforts in this branch of\r\nscience, we have every reason to believe that the future will bring\r\nforth many others of their sex who will take rank with such intellectual\r\nluminaries as Hypatia, Mme. du Chatelet, Laura Bassi and Mary\r\nSomerville.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[151] \"Publice philosophiam naturalem et moralem in scholis Academiisque\r\nAtticis docuit haec foemina annis XXXV, libros composuit XL, discipulos\r\nhabuit philosophos CX, obiit anno aetatis LXXVII, cui tale Athenienses\r\nstatuere epitaphium:\r\n\r\n    Nobilis hic Arete dormit, lux Helladis, ore\r\n      Tyndaris at tibi par, Icarioti, fide.\r\n    Patris Aristippi calamumque animamque dederunt,\r\n      Socratis huic linguam Maeonidaeque Dii.\"\r\n\r\n               --Boccaccio, _De Laudibus Mulierum_, Lib.

I, pp. 384-391, and\r\nMazzuchelli's _Gli Scrittori d'Italia_, Vol. II, Part I, pp. 527-529,\r\nBrescia, 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first woman deserving special mention in the history of chemistry is\r\nthe wife of the immortal Lavoisier, the most famous of the founders of\r\nmodern chemical science. While yet in her teens, this remarkable woman\r\ngave evidence of exceptional intelligence and will power. She was\r\nthoroughly devoted to her husband, and had the greatest admiration for\r\nhis genius. Her highest ambition was to prove herself worthy of him and\r\nto render herself competent to assist him in those investigations that\r\nhave given him such imperishable renown. With this end in view, she\r\nlearned Latin and English, and she thus became an accomplished\r\ntranslator from these languages of any chemical works which might aid\r\nher spouse in his epoch-making researches. It was she who translated for\r\nhim the chemical memoirs of Cavendish, Henry, Kirwan, Priestly and other\r\nnoted English scientific investigators.\r\n\r\nArthur Young, well known in his day as a traveler and author, who in\r\n1787 made the acquaintance of Madame Lavoisier, describes her as a woman\r\nfull of animation, good sense and knowledge. In referring to a breakfast\r\nshe had given him, he declares that \"unquestionably the best part of the\r\nrepast was her conversation on Kirwan's _Essay on Phlogiston_, which she\r\nwas then translating, and on other subjects which a woman of sense,\r\nworking in the laboratory of her husband, knows so well how to make\r\ninteresting.\"\r\n\r\nShe was an ardent co-worker with her husband in his laboratory and\r\nmaterially aided him in his labors. Under his direction she wrote the\r\nresults of the experiments that were made, as is evidenced by the\r\nrecords of his work. As a pupil of the illustrious painter, David, she\r\nwas naturally skillful in drawing. Besides this, she was a good\r\nengraver, and it is to her that are due the illustrations in Lavoisier's\r\ngreat _Traite de Chimie_, which contributed so much toward\r\nrevolutionizing the science of chemistry. It was, indeed, the first work\r\nthat deserved to be regarded as a textbook of modern chemistry. Among\r\nher drawings are two of special interest. They represent her as seated\r\nat a table in the laboratory, taking notes, while her husband and his\r\nassistant, Seguin, are making an experiment on the phenomena of\r\nrespiration.[158]\r\n\r\nAll Mme. Lavoisier's writings testify to her great admiration of the\r\ngenius of her husband. Intimately associated with him in his work, she\r\ncombatted for the triumph of his ideas and sought to make converts to\r\nthem. One of her most notable converts was the Swiss chemist, de\r\nSaussure. \"You have, Madame,\" he writes her, \"triumphed over my doubts,\r\nat least in the matter of phlogiston, which is the principal object of\r\nthe interesting work of which you have done me the honor of sending me a\r\ncopy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Lavoisier's tragic death on the guillotine, it was his devoted\r\nwife who edited his _Memoirs on Chemistry_, of which Lavoisier had\r\nhimself projected the publication. The two volumes constituting this\r\nwork were not for sale, but were gratuitously distributed by the\r\nbereaved widow among the most eminent scientific men of the epoch.\r\nCuvier, in acknowledging the receipt of these precious memoirs,\r\ndeclares: \"All the friends of science are under obligations to you for\r\nyour sorrowful determination to publish this collection of papers and to\r\npublish them as they were written--a melancholy monument of your loss\r\nand theirs--a loss which humanity will feel for centuries.\"\r\n\r\nTo realize the importance of the work in which Mme. Lavoisier\r\nparticipated, it suffices to recall the fact that her husband, as one of\r\nthe creators of modern chemistry, was the first to demonstrate the\r\nexistence of the law of the conservation of matter, which declares that\r\nin all chemical changes nothing is lost and nothing is created. The\r\nco-discoverer with Scheele and Priestly of oxygen, he was the first one\r\nto exhibit the role of this important element in the phenomena of\r\ncombustion and respiration and the first, also, to lay the foundations\r\nof a chemical nomenclature. We are not, then, surprised to learn that\r\nMme. Lavoisier's salon, even long after her lamented husband's death,\r\nwas frequented by the most eminent savants of the time. For here were\r\ngathered such scientific luminaries as Cuvier, Laplace, Arago, Lagrange,\r\nProny, Berthollet, Delambre, Biot, Humboldt, and others scarcely less\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of Mme. Lavoisier's work in the laboratory of her\r\nhusband, little was accomplished by women in chemistry for more than\r\nhalf a century. The reason was simple. Chemistry was not a part of the\r\ncurriculum of studies for girls either in Europe or America. Even\r\n\"during the sixties,\" writes a teacher of one of the prominent female\r\nseminaries of the United States, \"the study of chemistry was mostly\r\nconfined to the textbook, supplemented once a year by a course of\r\nlectures from an itinerant expert, who with his tanks of various gases\r\nproduced highly spectacular effects.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one recollects that the first institution in America--Vassar--for\r\nthe higher education of women was not opened until 1865, one will\r\nunderstand that there were previously to this date few opportunities for\r\nwomen to study either chemistry or any of the other sciences.\r\n\r\nThe first scientific institution to open its doors to women was the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. This was on May 11, 1876, when\r\nthe governing board of the institute decided that \"hereafter special\r\nstudents in chemistry shall be admitted without regard to sex.\" In less\r\nthan a year after this event every department of this institution was\r\nopen to women, and any one who could pass the requisite examination was\r\nadmitted as a student.\r\n\r\nFive years, however, before women were formally admitted to the courses\r\nof chemistry an energetic young graduate from Vassar, eager to devote\r\nher life to the pursuit of science, had, as an exceptional favor, been\r\nallowed to enter the Institute as a special student in chemistry. As she\r\nwas the first woman in the United States to enter a strictly\r\nprofessional scientific school, her entrance marks the beginning of a\r\nnew epoch in the history of female education. The name of this ardent\r\nvotary of science was Miss Ellen Swallow, better known to the world as\r\nMrs. Ellen H. Richards.\r\n\r\nMrs. Richards had not devoted herself long to the study of her favorite\r\nscience before she resolved to apply the knowledge thus gained to the\r\nproblems of daily life. She saw, among other things, the necessity of a\r\ncomplete reform in domestic economy, and resolutely set to work to have\r\nher views adopted and put in practice. She was, in consequence, one of\r\nthe first leaders of the crusade in behalf of pure food, and her\r\nlectures and books on this all-important subject contributed greatly\r\ntoward the diffusion of exact knowledge respecting the dangers lurking\r\nin unwholesome food.\r\n\r\nShe was likewise one of the first to apply the science of chemistry to\r\nan exhaustive study of the science of nutrition--to the study of food\r\nand the proper preparation of food materials. In this she was eminently\r\nsuccessful, and was able to achieve for home economics what the\r\nillustrious Liebig had many years before accomplished for agricultural\r\nchemistry--put it on a firm and lasting basis. To her the kitchen was\r\nthe center and source of political economy.\r\n\r\nThe facts of science, indeed, were to Mrs. Richards more than mere\r\nuncorrelated facts. They are potential agencies of service, and their\r\nchief value consists in their enabling us to control our environment in\r\nsuch wise as to secure the maximum of physical well being. Hence her\r\nconstant insistence on personal cleanliness, on the cleanliness of food,\r\nof the house we live in, and, above all, of the kitchen. Hence, also,\r\nher preaching, in season and out of season, on the necessity of pure\r\nair, pure water and abundance of vitalizing sunshine.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, then, wonder that sanitary chemistry eventually became the\r\nlife work of Mrs. Richards, and that, when the course of sanitary\r\nengineering was inaugurated in the Institute of Technology--the first\r\ncourse of its kind in the world--she became an important agent in its\r\ndevelopment and contributed immensely to its popularity and prestige.\r\n\r\nShe held the position of instructor of sanitary chemistry in the\r\ninstitute for twenty-seven years. During this time she trained a large\r\nnumber of young men in her chosen specialty, and these, after\r\ngraduating, engaged in similar work in various parts of the New and the\r\nOld World.\r\n\r\nThe branch of sanitary chemistry to which Mrs. Richards devoted most\r\nattention was air, water and sewage analysis. In this she was a\r\nrecognized expert, and her advice and services were sought in all parts\r\nof the country. During the last three years of her life she acted,\r\naccording to her own testimony, as general sanitary adviser to no fewer\r\nthan two score corporations and schools. In addition to this she was\r\nalso during this brief period consulted on the subject of foods by\r\nnearly two hundred educational and other institutions.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, constituted the greatest contribution of Mrs. Richards to\r\nthe public health was the part she took in the great sanitary survey of\r\nthe waters of the State of Massachusetts. During this long and\r\nlaborious investigation she analyzed more than forty thousand samples of\r\nwater. These analyses exhibited the condition of the water from all\r\nparts of the state during all seasons of the year and were of the\r\ngreatest value in solving a number of important problems in state\r\nsanitation.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the drafts made on her time and energy by her\r\nclasswork in the laboratory and her occupation as sanitary engineer for\r\nscores of public and private institutions, she still found leisure to\r\nengage in many important movements which had in view the public health\r\nand the betterment of sanitary conditions in city and country. It is\r\nsafe to say that no one ever put her knowledge of chemical science to\r\nmore practical use or made it more perfectly subserve the public weal\r\nthan did Mrs. Richards. To spread among the masses a knowledge of the\r\nprinciples of sanitation, to make them realize how indispensable to\r\nhealth are pure food, pure water, pure air and life-giving sunshine was\r\nher great mission in life, and in this she displayed an energy and a\r\ntireless zeal which were an inspiration to all with whom she came into\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nThis indefatigable woman, it is proper to record here, might have\r\ndistinguished herself as a discoverer in chemical science had she\r\nelected to devote her life to original research rather than to utilizing\r\nthe knowledge already available for the welfare of her fellows. Thus,\r\nafter a careful analysis of the rare mineral samarskite, she found an\r\ninsoluble residue which led her to believe might contain unknown\r\nelements. This view she repeatedly expressed to her co-workers in the\r\nlaboratory. But she was unwilling to take from what she regarded more\r\nimportant work the time necessary for making investigations which might\r\nhave given her undying fame as a discoverer. For not long afterward this\r\ninsoluble residue, in the hands of two French chemists, yielded the\r\nexceedingly rare elements, samarium and gadolinium.\r\n\r\nAnother chemist of a less altruistic nature than Mrs. Richards would not\r\nhave resisted the temptation to achieve distinction in the domain of\r\noriginal research. But where there was so much suffering to be relieved\r\nand so much ignorance to be removed regarding the most fundamental\r\nprinciples of sanitation, this philanthropic woman preferred to put to\r\npractical use what she called \"the considerable body of useful knowledge\r\nnow lying on our shelves.\"\r\n\r\nHer duty, as she conceived it, is well indicated in the following\r\nparagraph, taken from a thoughtful discussion by her of the subject of\r\nhome economics a short time before her death in 1911. \"The sanitary\r\nresearch worker in laboratory and field,\" she declares, \"has gone nearly\r\nto the limit of his value. He will soon be smothered in his own work, if\r\nno one takes it. Meanwhile children die by the thousands; contagious\r\ndiseases take toll of hundreds; back alleys remain foul and the streets\r\nare unswept; school-houses are unwashed and danger lurks in the drinking\r\ncups and about the towels. Dust is stirred up each morning with the\r\nfeather duster to greet the warm, moist noses and throats of the\r\nchildren. To the watchful expert it seems like the old cities dancing\r\nand making merry on the eve of a volcanic outbreak.\"[159]\r\n\r\nFrom the day in 1873 when Mrs. Richards received from the Institute of\r\nTechnology the degree of Bachelor of Science--a degree which made her\r\nnot only the first woman graduate of this institution, but also the\r\nfirst graduate in the United States of a strictly scientific seat of\r\nlearning--the number of women who have devoted themselves to chemical\r\npursuits is legion. They are now found in every civilized country in\r\nboth hemispheres and their number is daily increasing. They are\r\neverywhere doing excellent work as teachers in classrooms and\r\nlaboratories and holding their own with men as chemical experts in\r\nmanufacturing establishments and government institutions. Many of them\r\nhave done original work of a high order, and distinguished themselves by\r\ntheir valuable contributions to contemporary chemical literature. Space,\r\nhowever, precludes more than a general reference to their achievements,\r\nfor the names only of those who have done meritorious work in chemistry\r\nwould make a very long list.\r\n\r\nPassing over, then, all the lesser feminine lights in chemistry who, in\r\nvarious fields of activity, have rendered such distinct service during\r\nthe past generation, we come to one who for nearly two decades has stood\r\nin the forefront of the great chemists of the world. This is that\r\nrenowned daughter of Poland, Mme. Marie Klodowska Curie, whose name will\r\nalways be identified with some of the most remarkable discoveries which\r\nhave ever been made in the long-continued study of the material\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nMarie Klodowska was born in Warsaw, in 1868. Her father was a professor\r\nof chemistry in the university of the former Polish capital; and it is\r\nundoubtedly from him that his brilliantly dowered daughter has inherited\r\nher love of chemistry and her extraordinary genius for scientific\r\nresearch. Owing to the paltry salary he received, Professor Klodowska\r\nwas obliged to make little Marie his laboratory assistant while she was\r\nquite a young girl. Instead, then, of playing with tops and dolls, her\r\ntime was occupied in cleaning evaporating dishes and test tubes and in\r\nassisting her father to prepare for his lectures and experiments. And it\r\nwas thus that, at an early age, she acquired a taste for that science in\r\nwhich she was subsequently to achieve such world-wide fame.\r\n\r\nWhile still a young woman, her love of science drew her to Paris, where\r\nshe arrived with only fifty francs in her purse. But, possessed of\r\ndauntless courage and unfaltering perseverance, she was prepared to make\r\nany sacrifice in the pursuit of knowledge.\r\n\r\nHer first home in the gay French metropolis was a poorly furnished\r\ngarret in an obscure part of the city, and her diet was for so long a\r\ntime restricted to black bread and skimmed milk that she afterward\r\navowed that she had to cultivate a taste for wine and meat. And so\r\nintensely cold was her cheerless room in winter that the little bottle\r\nof milk which was daily left at her door was speedily congealed. At this\r\ntime the poor girl was living on less than ten cents a day, but still\r\ncherishing all the while the fond hope that she might eventually secure\r\na position as a student assistant in some good chemical laboratory.\r\n\r\nAfter a long struggle with poverty and after countless disappointments\r\nin quest of a position where she could gratify her ambition as a student\r\nof chemistry, she finally found occupation as a poorly paid assistant in\r\nthe laboratory conducted by Professor Lipmann. She was not, however, at\r\nwork a week before this distinguished investigator recognized in the\r\nyoung woman one whose knowledge of chemistry and faculty for original\r\nresearch were far above the average. She was accordingly transferred\r\nwithout delay from the menial employment in which she had been engaged\r\nand given every possible facility for prosecuting work as an original\r\ninvestigator.\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after this event that Marie Klodowska met the noted\r\nsavant, Pierre Curie. He was not long in discovering in her a kindred\r\nspirit--one who, besides having exceptional talent in experimental\r\nchemistry, was actuated by an ardent love of science. It was then that\r\nhe determined to make her his wife. A single sentence in a letter he\r\nwrote at this time to the object of his admiration and affection\r\nreveals, better than anything else, the devotion of this matchless pair\r\nin the cause of science. \"What a great thing it would be,\" he exclaims,\r\n\"to unite our lives and work together for the sake of science and\r\nhumanity.\" These simple words were the keynote to the ideal life led by\r\nthis incomparable couple during the eleven years they worked together\r\nin perfect unity of thought and aspiration before the sudden and\r\npremature extinction of the husband's life gave such a shock to the\r\nentire scientific world.\r\n\r\nAfter her marriage the gifted young Polish woman had reached the goal of\r\nher ambition. She was able to devote herself exclusively to what was\r\nhenceforth to constitute her life work in one of the best laboratories\r\nof Paris, that of the Ecole de Physique et de Chimie, and that, too, in\r\ncollaboration with her husband, from whom she was never separated during\r\nthe entire period of their married life for even a single day.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Mme. Curie had her interest aroused by the\r\nbrilliant discoveries of Roentgen and Becquerel regarding radiant matter.\r\nAfter a long series of carefully conducted experiments on the compounds\r\nof uranium and thorium, she, with the intuition of genius, opened up to\r\nthe world of science an entirely new field of research. But she soon\r\nrealized that the labor involved in the investigations which she had\r\nplanned was entirely beyond the capacity of any one person. It was then\r\nthat she succeeded in enlisting her husband's interest in the\r\nundertaking which was to lead to such marvelous results.\r\n\r\nConfining their work to a careful analytical study of the residue of the\r\nfamous Bohemian pitchblend--an extremely complex mineral, largely\r\ncomposed of oxide of uranium--they soon found themselves confronted by\r\nmost extraordinary radio-active phenomena. Continuing their researches,\r\ntheir labor was rewarded by the discovery of a new element which Mme.\r\nCurie, in her enthusiasm, named in honor of the land of her birth,\r\npolonium.\r\n\r\nAs their investigations progressed, they became correspondingly\r\ndifficult. They were dealing with substances which exist in pitchblend\r\nresidue only in infinitesimal quantities--not more than three troy grams\r\nto the ton. The difficulties they had to contend with were enough to\r\ndiscourage the stoutest heart. Few believed in their theories, while\r\nthe majority of those who had some intimation of the character of their\r\nwork were persuaded that they were pursuing a phantom. But the\r\nindefatigable pair toiled on day and night and continued their\r\nexperiments through long years of poverty and deferred hopes.\r\n\r\nConsidering the herculean task in which they were engaged for so many\r\nyears, we scarcely know which to admire most, their clearness of vision,\r\nwhich made them divine success; their profound knowledge, which guided\r\nthem in the choice of reagents; or the indomitable perseverance which\r\ncharacterized them in their laborious task and in the countless\r\nsacrifices which they were obliged to make before their efforts were\r\ncrowned with success.\r\n\r\nDuring this long search into the inner heart of nature, Pierre Curie was\r\noften so discouraged and depressed that, had he not been sustained by\r\nhis more sanguine wife, he would time and again have given up his\r\ninvestigations in despair. But Marie Curie never faltered. She never\r\nlost faith in their theories or confidence in the outcome of their great\r\nundertaking. Before her deft hands and fertile brain difficulties\r\nvanished as if under the magic wand of Prospero.\r\n\r\nAt length, after countless experiments of the most delicate character,\r\nafter bringing to bear on the solution of the problem before them the\r\nmost refined methods of chemical analysis, they were rewarded by one of\r\nthe most extraordinary discoveries recorded in the annals of science.\r\nWith the announcement of the discovery of radium, the Curies sprang into\r\nworld-wide fame, and the name of the wonderful woman who had been the\r\nprime mover in the supreme achievement was on every lip. Pierre Curie\r\nhimself declared that more than half of the epochal discovery belonged\r\nto his wife. It was she who began the work. It was she who, after her\r\nmarriage, enlisted in it the cooperation of her husband. It was she\r\nwhose invincible patience and persistence--typical of the noblest\r\nrepresentatives of her race--supported him during periods of doubt and\r\ndespondency and fanned his flagging spirits to new endeavor. It can\r\nindeed be truthfully asserted that had it not been for her penetrating\r\nintelligence, her tenacity of purpose and her keenness of vision, which\r\nwere never at fault, the great victory which crowned their efforts would\r\nnever have been achieved.[160]\r\n\r\nCompare their work with that which was accomplished by their illustrious\r\npredecessors, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, and his wife, a century\r\nearlier. The latter, by their discovery of and experiments with oxygen,\r\nwere able to explain the until then mysterious phenomena of combustion\r\nand respiration and to coordinate numberless facts which had before\r\nstood isolated and enigmatic. But the reverse was the case in the\r\ndiscovery of that extraordinary and uncanny element, radium. It\r\ncompletely subverted many long-established theories and necessitated an\r\nentirely new view of the nature of energy and of the constitution of\r\nmatter. A substance that seemed capable of emitting light and heat\r\nindefinitely, with little or no appreciable change or transformation,\r\nappeared to sap the very foundations of the fundamental principle of the\r\nconservation of energy.\r\n\r\nSubsequent investigations seemed only to render \"confusion worse\r\nconfounded.\" They appeared to justify the dreams of the alchemists of\r\nold, not only regarding the transmutation of metals but also respecting\r\nthe elixir of life. For was not this apparently absurd idea vindicated\r\nby the observed curative properties--bordering almost on the\r\nmiraculous--this marvelous element was reputed to possess! Its virtues,\r\nit was averred, transcended the fabled properties of the famous red\r\ntincture and the philosopher's stone combined, and many were prepared to\r\nfind in it a panacea for the most distressing of human ailments, from\r\nlupus and rodent ulcer to cancer and other frightful forms of morbid\r\ndegeneration.[161]\r\n\r\nAnd the end is not yet. Continued investigations, made in all parts of\r\nthe world since the discovery of radium by the Curies, have but\r\nemphasized its mysterious properties, and compelled a revision of many\r\nof our most cherished theories in chemistry, physics and astronomy. No\r\none single discovery, not even Pasteur's far-reaching discovery of\r\nmicrobic life, it may safely be asserted, has ever been more subversive\r\nof long-accepted views in certain domains of science, or given rise to\r\nmore perplexing problems regarding matters which were previously thought\r\nto be thoroughly understood.\r\n\r\nNever in the entire history of science have the results of a woman's\r\nscientific researches been so stupendous or so revolutionary. And never\r\nhas any one achievement in science reflected more glory on womankind\r\nthan that which is so largely due to the genius and the perseverance of\r\nMme. Curie.\r\n\r\nAfter their startling discovery, honors and tributes to their genius\r\ncame in rapid succession to the gifted couple. On the recommendation of\r\nthe venerable British savant, Lord Kelvin, they were awarded the Davy\r\ngold medal by the Royal Society. Shortly after this they shared with M.\r\nH. Becquerel in the Nobel prize for physics bestowed on them by Sweden.\r\nThen came laggard France with its decoration of the Legion of Honor. But\r\nit was offered only to the man. There was nothing for the woman. Pierre\r\nCurie showed his spirit and chivalry by declining to accept the\r\nproffered honor unless his wife could share it with him. His answer was\r\nsimple, but its meaning could not be mistaken. \"This decoration,\" he\r\nsaid, \"has no bearing on my work.\"[162]\r\n\r\nShortly after her husband's death Mme. Curie was appointed as his\r\nsuccessor as special lecturer in the Sorbonne. This was the first time\r\nthat this conservative old university ever invited a woman to a full\r\nprofessorship. But she soon showed that she was thoroughly competent to\r\nfill the position with honor and eclat. She has the elite of society and\r\nthe world's most noted men of science among her auditors. The crowned\r\nheads of the Old World eagerly seek an opportunity to witness her\r\nexperiments and hear her discourse on what is by all odds the most\r\nmarvelous element in nature.\r\n\r\nMme. Curie has not allowed her lectures in the Sorbonne to interfere\r\nwith the continuation of the researches which have won for her such\r\nworld-wide renown. Since the sudden taking off of her husband by a\r\npassing truck on a Paris bridge, she has succeeded in isolating both\r\nradium and polonium--only the chlorides and bromides of these elements\r\nwere previously known--besides doing other work scarcely less\r\nremarkable. And besides all this, she has also found time to write a\r\nconnected account of her investigations under the title of _Traite de\r\nRadio-Activite_--a work that reflects as much honor on her sex as did\r\n_Le Instituzioni Analitiche_ of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, which won for her,\r\nthrough that celebrated patron of learning, Benedict XIV, the chair of\r\nhigher mathematics in the University of Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe list of learned societies to which Mme. Curie belongs is an extended\r\none. To mention only a few, she is an honorary or foreign member of the\r\nLondon Chemical Society, the Royal Institution of Great Britain, the\r\nRoyal Swedish Academy, the American Chemical Society, the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, and the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St.\r\nPetersburg. From the universities of Geneva and Edinburgh she has\r\nreceived the honorary degree of doctor.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 she received the Gegner prize from the French Academy of\r\nSciences for her elaborate researches on the magnetic properties of iron\r\nand steel, as also for her investigations relating to radio-activity.\r\nThe same prize was again awarded to her in 1900, and still again in\r\n1903. With her husband she received in 1901 the La Caze prize of ten\r\nthousand francs; and in 1903 she received a part of the Osiris prize of\r\nsixty thousand francs. Since her husband's death in 1906 Mme. Curie has\r\nbeen awarded the coveted Nobel prize in chemistry, which was placed in\r\nher hand by the King of Sweden on December 11, 1911--a prize which\r\nincreased the exchequer of the fair recipient by nearly two hundred\r\nthousand francs. Having before been the beneficiary of the Nobel prize\r\nfor physics, in conjunction with her husband and M. H. Becquerel, Mme.\r\nCurie is thus the first person to be twice singled out for the world 's\r\nhighest financial recognition of scientific research.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to enumerate all the medals and prizes and honors\r\nwhich have come to this remarkable woman from foreign countries. But she\r\nhas doubtless been the recipient of more trophies of undying fame\r\nduring the last decade and a half than any other one person during the\r\nsame brief period of intellectual activity. And all these tokens of\r\nrecognition of genius were showered upon her not because she was a\r\nwoman, but in spite of this fact. Had she been a man, she would have\r\nbeen honored with the other distinctions which tradition and prejudice\r\nstill persist in denying to one of the proscribed sex, no matter how\r\ngreat her merit or how signal her achievements.\r\n\r\nAt a recent scientific congress, held in Brussels, it was decided to\r\nprepare a standard of measurement of radium emanations. It was the\r\nunanimous opinion of the congress that Mme. Curie was better equipped\r\nthan any other person for establishing such a standard; and she was\r\naccordingly requested to undertake the delicate and difficult task--a\r\ncommission which she executed to the satisfaction of all concerned.\r\n\r\nThis unit of measurement, it is gratifying to learn, will be known as\r\nthe curie--a word which will enter the same category as the volt, the\r\nohm, the ampere, the farad, and a few others which will perpetuate the\r\nnames of the world's greatest geniuses in the domain of experimental\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nWhen, not long since, there was a vacancy among the immortals of the\r\nFrench Academy, there was a generally expressed desire that it should be\r\nfilled by one who was universally recognized as among the foremost of\r\nliving scientists. The name of Mme. Curie trembled on every lip; and the\r\nhope was entertained that the Academy would honor itself by admitting\r\nthe world-famed savante among its members. Considering her achievements,\r\nshe had no competitor, and was, in the estimation of all outside of the\r\nAcademy, the one person in France who was most deserving of the coveted\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nBut no. She was a woman; and for that reason alone she was excluded from\r\nan institution the sole object of whose establishment was the reward of\r\nmerit and the advancement of learning. The age-old prejudice against\r\nwomen who devote themselves to the study of science, or who contribute\r\nto the progress of knowledge, was still as dominant as it was in the\r\ndays of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, a century and a half before. Mme. Curie,\r\nlike her famous sister in Italy, might win the plaudits of the world for\r\nher achievements; but she could have no recognition from the one\r\ninstitution, above all others, that was specially founded to foster the\r\ndevelopment of science and literature, and to crown the efforts of those\r\nwho had proven themselves worthy of the Academy's highest honor. The\r\nattitude of the French institution toward Mme. Curie was exactly like\r\nthat of the Royal Society of Great Britain when Mrs. Ayrton's name was\r\nup for membership. The answer to both applicants was in effect, if not\r\nin words, \"No woman need apply.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one reads of the sad experiences of Mme. Curie and Mrs. Ayrton with\r\nthe learned societies of Paris and London, one instinctively asks, \"When\r\nwill the day come when women, in every part of the civilized world,\r\nshall enjoy all the rights and privileges in every field of intellectual\r\neffort which have so long been theirs in the favored land of Dante and\r\nBeatrice--the motherland of learned societies and universities?\" For not\r\nuntil the advent of the day when such exclusive organizations as\r\nthe Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences, such\r\nultra-conservative universities as Oxford and Cambridge shall admit\r\nwomen on the same footing as men, will these institutions be more than\r\nhalf serving the best interests of humanity.[163]\r\n\r\nWomen, it is true, are now eligible to many literary and scientific\r\nassociations from which they were formerly debarred, and are, in most\r\ncountries, admitted to colleges and universities whose portals were\r\nclosed to them until only a few years ago; but until they shall be\r\nwelcomed to all universities and all societies whose objects are the\r\nadvancement of knowledge, until they shall participate in the\r\nadvantages and prestige accruing from connection with these\r\norganizations, they will have reason to feel that they are not yet in\r\nthe full possession of the intellectual advantages for which they have\r\nso long yearned--that they have been but partially liberated from that\r\neducational disqualification in which they have been held during so many\r\nlong centuries of deferred hopes and fruitless struggles.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] _Lavoisier 1743-1794, d'apres sa Correspondence, Ses Manuscrits,\r\nSes Papiers de Famille et d'Autres Documents Inedits_, p. 42 et seq.,\r\npar E.

Curie, in an article which she wrote shortly after her\r\ndiscovery of radium, shows that she possesses a genius for inductive\r\nscience of the highest type. \"It was at the close of the year 1897,\" she\r\nwrites, \"that I began to study the compounds of uranium, the properties\r\nof which had greatly attracted my interest. Here was a substance\r\nemitting spontaneously and continually radiations similar to Roentgen\r\nrays, whereas ordinarily, Roentgen rays can be produced only in a vacuum\r\ntube with the expenditure of electrical energy. By what process can\r\nuranium furnish the same rays without expenditure of energy and without\r\nundergoing apparent modification? Is uranium the only body whose\r\ncompounds emit similar rays? Such were the questions I asked myself; and\r\nit was while seeking to answer them that I entered into the researches\r\nwhich have led to the discovery of radium.\" _Radium and Radio-Activity\r\nin The Century Magazine_, for January, 1904.\r\n\r\n[161] _Notice sur Pierre Curie_, p. 20 et seq., by M. D. Gernez, Paris,\r\n1907, and _Le Radium, Son Origine et ses Transformations_, by M. L.\r\nHoullerigue, in _La Revue de Paris_, May 1, 1911.\r\n\r\n[162] The day following Pierre Curie's refusal of the decoration offered\r\nby the Government, the elder of his two daughters, little Irene, climbed\r\nupon her father's knee and put a red geranium in the lapel of his coat.\r\n\"Now, papa,\" she gravely remarked, \"you are decorated with the Legion of\r\nHonor.\" \"In this case,\" the fond father replied, \"I make no objection.\"\r\n\r\n[163] A few days before Mme. Curie's name was to come before the Academy\r\nof Sciences as a candidate for membership, the French Institute in its\r\nquarterly plenary meeting of the five academies, of which the Institute\r\nis composed, decided by a vote of ninety to fifty-two against the\r\neligibility of women to membership, and put itself on record in favor of\r\nthe \"immutable tradition against the election of women, which it seemed\r\neminently wise to respect.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on this decision of The Immortals, a writer in the well-known\r\nEnglish magazine, _Nature_, under date of January 12, 1911, penned the\r\nfollowing pertinent paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"It remains to be seen what the Academy of Sciences will do in the face\r\nof such an expression of opinion. Mme. Curie is deservedly popular in\r\nFrench scientific circles. It is everywhere recognized that her work is\r\nof transcendent merit, and that it has contributed enormously to the\r\nprestige of France as a home of experimental inquiry. Indeed, it is not\r\ntoo much to say that the discovery and isolation of the radio-active\r\nelements are among the most striking and fruitful results of a field of\r\ninvestigation preeminently French. If any prophet is to have honour in\r\nhis own country--even if the country be only the land of his\r\nadoption--surely, that honour ought to belong to Mme. Curie. At this\r\nmoment, Mme. Curie is without doubt, in the eyes of the world, the\r\ndominant figure in French chemistry. There is no question that any man\r\nwho had contributed to the sum of human knowledge what she has made\r\nknown, would years ago have gained that recognition at the hands of his\r\ncolleagues, which Mme. Curie's friends are now desirous of securing for\r\nher. It is incomprehensible, therefore, on any ethical principles of\r\nright and justice that, because she happens to be a woman, she should be\r\ndenied the laurels which her preeminent scientific achievement has\r\nearned for her.\"\r\n\r\nCompare this frank and honest statement with that of a contributor,\r\nabout the same date, to _La Revue du Monde_, of Paris. Guided by his\r\nmyopic vision and diseased imagination, this writer discerns in the\r\nadmittance of women into the grand old institution of Richelieu and\r\nNapoleon the imminent triumph of what Prudhon called pornocracy and the\r\neventual opening of the portals of the Palais Mazarin to representatives\r\nof the type of Lais and Phryne, on the Hellenic pretext that \"Beauty is\r\nthe supreme merit.\"\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying, however, to the friends of woman's cause to learn that\r\nMme. Curie's candidacy was defeated by only two votes. Her competitor,\r\nM. Branly, received thirty votes against the Polish woman's\r\ntwenty-eight. She thus fared far better than did Mme. Pauline Savari,\r\nwho aspired to the fauteuil made vacant by the death of Renan, regarding\r\nwhose candidature the Academy curtly declared, \"Considering that its\r\ntraditions do not permit it to examine this question, the Academy passes\r\nto the order of the day.\" Thus, it will be seen that, in spite of the\r\nlong-continued opposition to women members, the French Academy is more\r\nthan likely to offer its next vacant chair to the pride and glory of\r\nPoland,--the immortal discoverer of radium and polonium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN THE NATURAL SCIENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose that women, who are such lovers of nature,\r\nhave always had a greater or less interest in the natural sciences,\r\nespecially in botany and zoology; but the fact remains that the first\r\none of their sex to write at any length on the various kingdoms of\r\nnature was that extraordinary nun of the Middle Ages, St. Hildegard, the\r\nlearned abbess of the Benedictine convent of St. Rupert, at Bingen on\r\nthe Rhine. Of an exceptionally versatile and inquiring mind, her range\r\nof study and acquirement was truly encyclopaedic. In this respect she was\r\nthe worthy forerunner of Albert the Great, the famous _Doctor\r\nUniversalis_ of Scholasticism.\r\n\r\nAlthough St. Hildegard has much to say about nature in several of her\r\nworks, the one of chiefest interest to us as an exposition of the\r\nnatural history of her time is her treatise entitled _Liber Subtilitatum\r\nDiversarum Naturarum Creaturarum_. It is usually known by its more\r\nabbreviated name, _Physica_, and, considering the circumstances under\r\nwhich it was written, is, in many ways, a most remarkable production. It\r\nconsists of nine books treating of minerals, plants, fishes, birds,\r\ninsects and quadrupeds. The book on plants is composed of no fewer than\r\ntwo hundred and thirty chapters, while that on birds contains\r\nseventy-two chapters.\r\n\r\nIn reading Hildegard's descriptions of animated nature we are often\r\nreminded of Pliny's great work on natural history; but, so far as known,\r\nthere is no positive evidence that the learned religieuse had any\r\nacquaintance whatever with the writings of the old Roman naturalist. Had\r\nshe had, the general tenor of her work would have been quite different\r\nfrom what it actually is.\r\n\r\nThe mystery, then, is, what were the sources of _Physica_? Some have\r\nfancied that Hildegard in preparing this made use of the writings not\r\nonly of Pliny and Virgil, but also of those of Macer, Constantinus\r\nAfricanus, Walafrid Strabo, Isodore of Seville, and other writers who\r\nwere in great vogue during the Middle Ages. The general consensus of\r\nopinion, however, of those who have carefully studied this interesting\r\nproblem is that the gentle nun was not acquainted with any of the\r\nauthors named, except, possibly, Isodore of Seville, whose works were\r\nall held in high esteem, especially during the period of Hildegard's\r\ngreatest literary activity.\r\n\r\nHildegard's _Physica_ has a special value for philologists, as well as\r\nfor students of natural history, for it contains the German names of\r\nplants still used by the people of the Fatherland seven hundred years\r\nafter they were penned by the painstaking abbess of St. Rupert's.[164]\r\n\r\nReferring to the Saint's work entitled _De Natura Hominis, Elementorum,\r\nDiversarumque Creaturarum_--a treatise on the nature of man, the\r\nelements and divers created things--no less an authority than Dr.\r\nCharles Daremberg declares that it will always hold an important place\r\nin the history of medical art and of inanimate and animate\r\nnature--_insignis semper locus debetitur in artis medicae rerumque\r\nnaturalium historia_.[165]\r\n\r\nHe even goes further and affirms that Hildegard was familiar with\r\nnumerous facts of science regarding which other mediaeval writers were\r\nentirely ignorant. More than this. She was acquainted with many of\r\nnature's secrets which were unknown to men of science until recent\r\ntimes, and which, on being disclosed by modern researches, have been\r\nproclaimed to the world as new discoveries.[166]\r\n\r\nOne reason why St. Hildegard's writings on botany, zoology and\r\nmineralogy are not better known is that few students care to make the\r\neffort to master her voluminous works. They require long and assiduous\r\nstudy and a knowledge of her peculiarities of style and expression which\r\nis acquired only after patient and persistent labor. But the labor is\r\nnot in vain, as is evidenced by the numerous monographs which have\r\nappeared in recent years, especially in Germany, on the scientific works\r\nof this marvelous nun of the twelfth century. All things considered, the\r\nAbbess of Bingen may be said to hold the same position in the natural\r\nsciences of her time as was held in the physical and mathematical\r\nsciences seven hundred years earlier by the illustrious Hypatia of\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of St. Hildegard, full six centuries elapsed before any\r\none of her sex again achieved distinction in the domain of natural\r\nscience. And then, strange to relate, the first woman who won fame by\r\nher knowledge of science and by her contributions to it, did so in the\r\nfield where a woman would, one would think, be least disposed to\r\nexercise her talent and least likely to find congenial work. It was in\r\nthe then comparatively new science of human anatomy--a science which had\r\nbeen inaugurated in the famous medical schools of Salerno and which was\r\nsubsequently so highly developed in the great University of Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe name of this remarkable woman was Anna Morandi Manzolini. She was\r\nborn in 1716 in Bologna, where, after a brilliant career in her favorite\r\nbranch of science, she died at the age of fifty-eight. She held the\r\nchair of anatomy in the University of Bologna for many years, and is\r\nnoted for a number of important discoveries made as the result of her\r\ndissections of cadavers.\r\n\r\nBut she won a still greater title to fame by the marvelous skill which\r\nshe exhibited in making anatomical models out of indurated wax. They\r\nwere so carefully fashioned that some of them could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from the parts of the body from which they were modeled.\r\nAs aids in the study of anatomy they were most highly valued and eagerly\r\nsought for on all sides. The collection which she made for her own use\r\nwas, after her death, acquired by the Medical Institute of Bologna and\r\nprized as one of its most precious possessions.\r\n\r\nThree years after her demise, Luigi Galvani, professor of anatomy in the\r\nsame university in which Anna had achieved such fame, made use of these\r\nwax models for a course of lectures on the organs and structure of the\r\nhuman body.\r\n\r\nThese famous models, first perfected by Anna Manzolini, were the\r\narchetypes of the exquisite wax models of Vassourie as well as of the\r\nunrivaled _papier-mache_ creations of Dr. Auzoux and of all similar\r\nproductions now so extensively used in our schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nEven during the lifetime of the gifted modeler there were demands for\r\nspecimens of her work from all parts of Italy. From many cities in\r\nEurope, even from London and St. Petersburg, she received the most\r\nflattering offers for her services. So eager was Milan to have her\r\naccept a position which had been offered her that the city authorities\r\nsent her a blank contract and begged her to name her own conditions. But\r\nshe could never be induced to leave the home of her childhood and the\r\ncity which had witnessed and applauded her triumphs of maturer years.\r\n\r\nMen of learning and eminence, on passing through Bologna, invariably\r\nmade it a point to call on the learned _professora_ in order to make her\r\nacquaintance and to see her wonderful anatomical collection, which was\r\ncelebrated throughout Europe as _Supellex Manzoliniana_. Among these\r\nvisitors was Joseph II of Austria. So greatly was His Majesty impressed\r\nby Anna's rare intellectual attainments and by her marvelous skill in\r\nreproducing the various parts of the \"human form divine\" that he could\r\nnot take leave of her without showing his appreciation of them by\r\nloading her with gifts worthy of a sovereign.[167]\r\n\r\nA contemporary of Anna Manzolini, who also distinguished herself in the\r\npreparation of anatomical models, was the French woman, Mlle. Biheron.\r\nHer facsimiles of parts of the human body were, according to Mme. de\r\nGenlis, so true to nature that they could not be distinguished from the\r\noriginals. This led the facetious Chevalier Ringle, after examining a\r\nspecimen of her handiwork, to declare, \"Verily, it is so perfect that it\r\nlacks only the odor of the natural object.\"\r\n\r\nWhile yet prince royal, Gustavus of Sweden visited the French Academy of\r\nSciences in Paris. Here he was entertained by a number of experiments in\r\nanatomy. The demonstrator was Mlle. Biheron, who is said to have had a\r\nveritable passion for both anatomy and surgery. So impressed was\r\nGustavus with the extraordinary skill and knowledge of this gifted\r\ndaughter of France that he offered her the position of demonstrator of\r\nanatomy in the royal University of Sweden.\r\n\r\nOther branches of science, apparently quite as alien as anatomy to\r\nwomen's taste and talent, are mineralogy and metallurgy. Yet as early as\r\nthe first half of the seventeenth century, the Baroness de Beausoleil\r\nhad achieved a great reputation by her investigations into the mineral\r\ntreasures of France. Indeed, she may, strange as it may appear, be\r\nregarded as the first mining engineer of her native land. She details\r\nthe qualifications of a mining engineer and tells us he must, among\r\nother things, be well versed in chemistry, mineralogy, geometry,\r\nmechanics and hydraulics. As for herself, she assures us that she\r\ndevoted thirty years of unremitting study to these divers branches.\r\n\r\nTo Mme. de Beausoleil is also attributed the glory of awakening her\r\ncountrymen's interest in the mineral resources of France, and of showing\r\nthem how their proper exploitation would inure not only to the credit of\r\nthe nation abroad but also to its prosperity at home.\r\n\r\nShe was the author of two works which prove that she was a woman of rare\r\nattainments combined with exceptional breadth of view and political\r\nacumen. She was deeply concerned in the development of the mineral\r\nresources of her country and foresaw how greatly they could be made to\r\ncontribute to the augmentation of the nation's finances.\r\n\r\nHer work entitled _La Restitution de Pluton_ is a report on the mines\r\nand ore deposits of France, and is a document as precious as it is\r\ncurious. It was addressed to Cardinal Richelieu, and shows how the\r\nFrench monarch could, if the subterranean treasures of the country were\r\nproperly developed, become the greatest ruler in Christendom and his\r\nsubjects the happiest of all peoples.\r\n\r\nAnother report by this energetic and enthusiastic woman is in the same\r\nstrain. In it she proves how the King of France, by utilizing the\r\nunderground riches of his country, could make himself and his people\r\nindependent of all other nations.[168]\r\n\r\nIn these two productions Mme. de Beausoleil treats of the science of\r\nmining, the different kinds of mines, the assaying of ores and the\r\ndivers methods of smelting them, as well as of the general principles of\r\nmetallurgy, as then understood. But, unlike the majority of her\r\ncontemporaries, this enlightened woman had no patience with those who\r\nbelieved that the earth's hidden treasures could not be discovered\r\nwithout recourse to magic or to the aid of demons. She was unsparing in\r\nher ridicule of those who had faith in the existence of gnomes and\r\nkobolds, or thought that ore deposits could be located only by\r\ndivining-rods or similar foolish contrivances which were relics of an\r\nignorant and superstitious age.\r\n\r\nThe same century that witnessed the exploring activity of the Baroness\r\nde Beausoleil saw the beginnings of the notable achievements of a\r\ndaughter of Germany, well known in the annals of science as Maria\r\nSibylla Merian. Born in Frankfort in 1647, she died in Amsterdam in\r\n1717, after a somewhat checkered career, most of which was devoted to\r\nthe pursuit of natural history. So fond was she of flowers and insects\r\nthat it is said they told her all their secrets.\r\n\r\nAfter having familiarized herself with the fauna and flora of her native\r\nland, she proceeded to investigate the collections of the principal\r\nEuropean cabinets of natural history. This only fired her ambition to\r\nsee more of the world and study Nature where she is seen in her greatest\r\nsplendor and luxuriance.\r\n\r\nShe accordingly resolved to undertake a journey to the equatorial\r\nregions of South America. Such a voyage can now be made with comparative\r\nease, but in her days it was fraught with discomforts and dangers of all\r\nkinds, and one that no woman thought to venture on unless obliged to do\r\nso by stern necessity.\r\n\r\nBut she was set on investigating animals and plants in their own\r\nhabitats in the glorious and exuberant flora of the tropics and,\r\naccompanied by her two daughters, Helena and Dorothea, she embarked for\r\nSurinam. Here, assisted by her daughters, who, like their mother, were\r\nboth skillful artists, the intrepid naturalist spent two years in\r\nstudying the wonders of plant and animal life that everywhere greeted\r\nher delighted vision. All the time not occupied in research work was\r\ndevoted to sketching and painting those superb insects that are so\r\nabundant in tropical fields and forests.[169]\r\n\r\nReturning to Holland with her precious scientific treasures, she began\r\nthe preparation of a work that will long endure as a monument to her\r\nknowledge and industry. It was a magnificent volume in folio on the\r\ninsects of Surinam. It appeared simultaneously in Dutch and Latin, and\r\nwas subsequently translated into French.\r\n\r\nIn illustrating this sumptuous work, Frau Merian was greatly assisted by\r\nher younger daughter, Dorothea. The etchings and hand-colored\r\nreproductions of the gorgeous butterflies and flowers of Surinam\r\ncommanded universal admiration, and marked a new epoch in book-making.\r\nEven to-day this noble volume is eagerly sought by both book-lovers and\r\nmen of science, for it is not only a work of rare conception and beauty\r\nbut also one of exceptional accuracy in illustration and statement of\r\nfact.[170]\r\n\r\nBesides etchings of multiform insects, lizards and batrachians\r\nindigenous to Dutch Guiana, there were in this unique volume carefully\r\nexecuted illustrations of plants and trees peculiar to tropical America,\r\nsuch as vanilla, cacao, and the species of manihot which constitutes the\r\nstaff of life of so large a portion of the population in the basins of\r\nthe Amazon and the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nA new and enlarged edition of this work was published after Frau\r\nMerian's death by her daughter Dorothea. The same gifted daughter showed\r\nher interest in her parent's work and her devotion to her memory by\r\nbringing out a beautifully illustrated edition of her mother's earliest\r\nwork which treated of the wonderful life-history of silkworms.[171]\r\n\r\nThe century following that which had celebrated the scientific triumphs\r\nof Maria Merian found in Josephine Kablick, born in 1787 in Hohenelbe,\r\nBohemia, a woman who was destined to prove a worthy successor, as a\r\nnature-student, of the noted daughter of Frankfort-on-the-Main.\r\n\r\nFrom her tenderest years she exhibited a passionate love for every form\r\nof plant life. In addition to this, she had, while yet young, the good\r\nfortune of studying under the best botanists of her time.\r\n\r\nSoon she became an enthusiastic collector and was in a short time the\r\nhappy possessor of a herbarium which contained many new species of\r\nplants which she had discovered during her frequent botanical\r\nexcursions. From making collections for her private herbarium, she was\r\ngradually led to make collections for the schools and colleges of her\r\nnative country, as well as for the museums and learned societies of\r\nvarious parts of Europe. Many public institutions owed to her cordial\r\ncooperation some of the choicest treasures in their herbaria, and not a\r\nfew botanical writers of her day found in her an intelligent and\r\nsympathetic collaborator.\r\n\r\nBut Frau Kablick's interest in nature was not confined to plants. She\r\nwas an assiduous student of paleontology as well as of botany, and the\r\nmany fossil animals and plants named in her honor testify to her success\r\nin the pursuit of her favorite branches of science.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of the conventional blue-stocking about this ardent\r\nvotary of nature. Strong and healthy, neither wind nor rain interfered\r\nwith her fieldwork in botany or paleontology. It was her greatest\r\npleasure to roam through dark forests and scale high mountains in search\r\nof new species of plants and fossils. And the success which rewarded her\r\nefforts was such that the old and trained naturalists among her male\r\nfriends had reason to envy her good fortune as an explorer.\r\n\r\nBut Frau Kablick never permitted her frequent excursions, or her\r\ndevotion to science, to cause her to neglect the duties of her\r\nhousehold. Fortunately, her husband was also an ardent student of\r\nnature, and while his wife was devoting her attention to botany and\r\npaleontology, he was making investigations in zoology and mineralogy.\r\nThey spent fifty happy years together in the pursuit of science and\r\ntheir joint efforts contributed not a little toward the advancement of\r\nthe branches of science to which they had devoted their lives with such\r\nwell-directed effort and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAs the fruitful life of Josephine Kablick who had shed such luster on\r\nher sex in Bohemia was drawing to a close, a young woman in Germany,\r\nAmalie Dietrich by name, was preparing herself to fill the void which\r\nwould be occasioned by her predecessor's death. Her first love, as a\r\nyoung girl, was plant life, and this was subsequently accentuated by her\r\nhusband, who was not only a botanist himself but also one who belonged\r\nto a distinguished family of botanists.\r\n\r\nA keen observer and an indefatigable collector, Frau Dietrich soon\r\nbecame known throughout Europe as a botanist of marked ability and\r\ndaring. She was wont, unaccompanied, to climb the highest peaks of the\r\nSalzburg Alps, and spend entire weeks there seeking new species of\r\nAlpine flora. During the day she explored the deep ravines and clambered\r\nalong the brambly ledges of beetling precipices, and during the night\r\nshe sought shelter and repose in the humble hut of some hospitable\r\nherdsman.\r\n\r\nValuable, however, as was Amalie Dietrich's work in the Austrian Alps,\r\nit was but a preparation for that which some years later she was to\r\nenter upon in far-off Australia. Here she devoted twelve of the best\r\nyears of her life to the cultivation of botany in the virgin soil of\r\nQueensland. Here, too, she surprised everyone by her venturesome spirit\r\nno less than by her irrepressible zeal in making collections. Heedless\r\nof danger, she plunged quite alone into the wilderness and spent days\r\nand weeks at a time with the wild aborigines.\r\n\r\nBut she secured what she went in quest of,--a large and valuable\r\ncollection of plants, containing many new and interesting species.\r\nBesides these, she was able to bring back with her to Europe a large\r\nmass of zoological specimens as well as countless domestic utensils and\r\nimplements of warfare and husbandry employed by the savages among whom\r\nshe so frequently journeyed and with whose manners and customs she\r\neventually became so familiar.\r\n\r\nModest and trustworthy, Frau Dietrich had a host of friends in the\r\nscientific world, and the number of plants which bear her name are not\r\nonly a tribute to her worth, but a striking evidence of the extent of\r\nher activity in the pursuit of the science which became the absorbing\r\npassion of her life.[172]\r\n\r\nOf Russian women who have become specially noted for their contributions\r\nto natural science, a very prominent place must be assigned to Sophia\r\nPereyaslawzewa. After receiving the doctorate of science in the\r\nUniversity of Zurich, she became director of the biological station at\r\nSebastopol, a position she held with great eclat during twelve years.\r\nHere she made numerous important researches on manifold forms of marine\r\nlife and prepared many works for the press in German and French, as well\r\nas in her native Russian. Her _Monographie de Turbellaries de la Mer\r\nNoire_, a large and beautifully illustrated volume published at Odessa\r\nin 1892, placed her at once among biologists of the first rank. Indeed,\r\nso meritorious was this production of the talented daughter of Holy\r\nRussia that the Congress of Naturalists in 1893 did not hesitate to\r\nrecognize its exceptional value by conferring on the fair authoress a\r\nspecial prize.\r\n\r\nThis gifted biologist has since rendered distinct service in the cause\r\nof science by her explorations of the Gulf of Naples and the coasts of\r\nFrance. Her activity is prodigious, and the long list of books and\r\nmonographs which she has published on the lower forms of marine life in\r\nthe Black and Mediterranean seas shows that she has a capacity for work\r\nthat is truly extraordinary.\r\n\r\nHere is, probably, the place to make mention of a woman of encyclopaedic\r\nmind, Clemence Augustine Royer, who was born in 1830 in Nantes, France.\r\nShe wrote on such a variety of subjects that it is difficult to classify\r\nher. She was in no sense of the word a specialist, and she seems by\r\ntemperament to have been averse to confining herself to any one branch\r\nof knowledge.\r\n\r\nHer first work to attract particular attention was one on a topic\r\nconnected with political economy. A prize had been offered for the\r\ndiscussion of this subject, and the little French woman acquitted\r\nherself so well that she had the honor of sharing the prize with the\r\nnoted Proudhon. She has also written many works on philosophy and\r\nphysics. Among these are two which attracted considerable notice at the\r\ntime of their publication. In one of them she attacks the positivism of\r\nComte; in the other she assails Laplace's hypothesis regarding the\r\norigin of the material universe.\r\n\r\nBut the work which made her famous, particularly in France, was her\r\ntranslation into French in 1862 of Darwin's _Origin of Species_. It is\r\nsafe to say that this version created as much of a sensation in France\r\nas the original had caused in Great Britain and America. Her preface to\r\nthe work of the English naturalist, in which she indicates the results\r\nwhich flow from an acceptance of the transformist theory, created a\r\nveritable storm in both religious and scientific circles.\r\n\r\nSo gratified was Madame Royer by the impression made by this preface and\r\nso pleased was she with the controversy which she had started, that she\r\nexpanded her summary of the theory of evolution as therein given and\r\npublished it in 1870 under the title of _Origine de l'Homme et de\r\nSocietes_. This production was so revolutionary in character and so\r\nsubversive of teachings long held sacred that it provoked an indignant\r\nprotest from all quarters, and the author was at once ranked with such\r\nradical exponents of the new science as Voght, Buechner and Haeckel.\r\n\r\nAfter the appearance of this production, she wrote numerous other works,\r\nseveral of them on subjects relating to natural science, especially in\r\nits connection with anthropology and prehistoric archaeology. And so\r\ngreat was her breadth of view and so exceptional was her grasp of all\r\nsubjects discussed by her that Renan declared of her, _Elle est presque\r\nun homme de genie_--She is almost a man of genius.\r\n\r\nMme. Royer was frequently spoken of as a candidate for the French\r\nInstitute, but she was so well aware of the prejudices against the\r\nadmission of women to membership in this learned body that she never\r\nallowed herself to consider the proposal seriously. She was certainly a\r\nbrainy woman, and in her own department of intellectual effort she\r\nexhibited as much talent as did George Sand and Mme. de Stael in\r\nliterature and history.\r\n\r\nAn entirely different type of woman from the radical and disputatious\r\nMme. Royer was the charming and cultured lady, Miss Eleanor Ormerod, her\r\ncontemporary, who, in her chosen department of science, won both fame\r\nand the lasting gratitude of her fellowmen.\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod, unlike Mme. Royer, was preeminently a specialist, and the\r\nbranch of science in which she achieved distinction was entomology, or\r\nrather that branch of it known as economic entomology. From her\r\nchildhood she manifested an unusual interest in all forms of insects,\r\nbut particularly in those which are serviceable to mankind or are\r\ndestructive to farms and gardens, orchards and forests.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the gratification of her peculiar bent of mind, nearly\r\nhalf of Miss Ormerod's life was spent in a locality which was specially\r\nfavorable to the study of insects which are obnoxious to the gardener,\r\nthe farmer and the forester. This was at the confluence of the Wye and\r\nthe Severn, where her father owned a large landed estate, part of which\r\nwas under cultivation and part wood and park land.\r\n\r\nHere the young girl made her first collection of insects, and here she\r\nbegan her studies on the cause and nature of the parasitic attacks upon\r\ncrops. Here she first realized the frightful ravages that were\r\noccasioned by the manifold insect pests that infest not only trees,\r\nshrubs, cereals and vegetables, but also flocks and herds as well. And\r\nhere, too, she resolved to devote her life to devising preventive and\r\nremedial treatment for the evils which were robbing the husbandman of so\r\ngreat a part of the fruits of his toil.\r\n\r\nAfter taking this generous resolution, the life of our young heroine\r\nwas, like that of Liebig and Pasteur, devoted to the welfare of her\r\nfellowmen. And like these noble benefactors of their race, her thought\r\nwas always how she might prevent the losses and increase the products of\r\nthe tillers of the soil. Entomology with her was not mere\r\nnomenclature--a knowledge of strange and fantastic names, which, with\r\nthe ignorant, constitutes a distinction--but one of the most practical\r\nand useful of the sciences.\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod might, had she so elected, have won fame as a systematic\r\nentomologist and as a distinguished contributor to the already long list\r\nof genera and species of insects. She might have devoted herself to\r\ntheoretical work, or bent her energies towards the general advancement\r\nof the science, like Fabricius, Swammerdam, Westwood and Burnmeister;\r\nbut she preferred to forego all the glory that might accrue from\r\npursuing such a course, and to direct her efforts in such wise as to be\r\nof most service to humanity.\r\n\r\nLike the great Pasteur, after his long and laborious experimental\r\nresearches on silkworm diseases, Miss Ormerod could, at the end of her\r\nillustrious career, declare with truth: \"The results which I have\r\nobtained are, perhaps, less brilliant than those which I might have\r\nanticipated from researches pursued in the field of pure science, but I\r\nhave the satisfaction of having served my country in endeavoring, to the\r\nbest of my ability, to discover the remedy for great misery. It is to\r\nthe honor of a scientific man that he values discoveries which at their\r\nbirth can only obtain the esteem of his equals, far above those which at\r\nonce conquer the favor of the crowd by the immediate utility of their\r\napplication; but, in the presence of misfortune, it is equally an honor\r\nto sacrifice everything in the endeavor to relieve it.\"[173]\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod's labors were not, it is true, instrumental in rescuing\r\nfrom destruction a nation's chief industries, as were Pasteur's in the\r\ncase of his famous researches on the phyloxera of the grape vine or the\r\npebrine of the silkworm. Nor had they to do with such frightful\r\nindustrial disturbances as have frequently been occasioned by rinderpest\r\nor by the potato blight in Ireland in 1845.\r\n\r\nThis is true in so far as any one pest is concerned. But when one\r\nreflects on the scope of Miss Ormerod's investigations and considers how\r\nfar-reaching were her researches and how many and diverse industries\r\nwere embraced by the remedial and prophylactic measures which she\r\nproposed, one cannot but realize the immense importance of her\r\nlife-work.\r\n\r\nThe fact that her activities were confined chiefly to old and well-known\r\npests--insects from which the farmer and the gardener and the forester\r\nhad suffered for centuries, and which they had come to regard as\r\nnecessary and inevitable evils--does not detract from the merit and the\r\nvalue of her labors. That she should have taken up a work which affected\r\nso many people and have been so successful in abating, or in entirely\r\nremoving evils which had so long afflicted agriculturists and\r\nstock-growers, shows that she was a woman of rare courage and\r\ndetermination as well as one of invincible persistence and of\r\nintellectual resources of a very high order.\r\n\r\nDuring more than a quarter of a century Miss Ormerod devoted practically\r\nthe whole of her time to the study of economic entomology and to\r\nspreading a knowledge of it among her countrymen. From 1877 to 1898 she\r\npublished annual reports on injurious insects and sent them broadcast\r\nthroughout Great Britain and her colonies. In addition to this she wrote\r\na number of manuals and textbooks on insects injurious to food crops,\r\nforest trees, orchards and bush fruits.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. She also prepared for gratuitous distribution a large\r\nnumber of four-page leaflets on the most common farm pests. Of the\r\nleaflet, for instance, on the warble-fly, its life-history, methods of\r\nprevention and remedy, no less than a hundred and seventy thousand\r\ncopies were printed. And so great was the demand for her leaflet on the\r\ngooseberry red spider that a single mail brought her an order for three\r\nthousand copies.\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod, it is proper to state here, received no remuneration\r\nwhatever for her great services to the public. On the contrary, she gave\r\nnot only all her time gratuitously, but bore a great part of the expense\r\nof printing and distributing her publications. The amount of good she\r\nthus did unaided and alone cannot be estimated.\r\n\r\nIn her leaflet on the warble-fly, also known as bot-fly, she estimates\r\nthe annual damage to the stock-growers of the United Kingdom from this\r\npest at from L3,000,000 to L4,000,000. The losses due to fruit, grain\r\nand vegetable insects of various kinds, before she began her insect\r\ncrusade, were much greater. In Great Britain and her colonies they\r\namounted to very many millions of pounds sterling every year.[174]\r\n\r\nAnd most of these losses, as she demonstrated, were preventable by\r\nsimple precautions which she eventually succeeded in inducing the people\r\nto adopt. How much she was instrumental in saving annually to the\r\nfarmers and gardeners of England by her writings and lectures can only\r\nbe imagined, but the sum must have been immense.\r\n\r\nWhen we recollect that Miss Ormerod accomplished all her work before it\r\noccurred to the English Board of Agriculture to appoint a government\r\nentomologist, we shall realize what a pioneer she was in the career in\r\nwhich she achieved such distinction and through which she conferred such\r\ninestimable benefits upon her fellows.\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod's entomological publications, especially her annual\r\nreports, brought her into relations with people of all classes\r\nthroughout the whole world. Her correspondence, in consequence, was\r\nenormous, and not infrequently amounted to from fifty to a hundred\r\nletters a day. The great entomologists of Europe and America held her in\r\nthe highest esteem, and had implicit faith in her judgment in all\r\nmatters pertaining to her specialty.\r\n\r\nOne day she would receive a letter from an English gardener begging for\r\na remedy against the strawberry beetle. The next day she would have a\r\nsimilar letter regarding mite-galls on black currants, or pea-weevil\r\nlarvae or clover-eel worms. Again there would be a communication from\r\nNorway requesting advice about the Hessian fly, or from Argentina asking\r\ninformation concerning a certain kind of destructive grass beetle, or\r\nfrom India appealing for help against a pernicious species of forest\r\nfly, or from South Africa seeking a relief from the boot-beetle. And\r\nstill again, she was consulted by her foreign correspondents about\r\ntermites, which were causing havoc among the young cocoa trees of\r\nCeylon, or about certain peculiar species of Australian larvae, or about\r\nthe devastating action of the pine beetle in the Scotch forests, or\r\nabout the wheat midge and antler moth in Finland.\r\n\r\nOne day she had a communication from the Austrian Embassy regarding a\r\nbeetle that was eating the oats about Constantinople, and not long\r\nafterwards she received a letter from the Chinese Minister in London\r\nbegging for information as to how to prevent the ravages of certain\r\nnoxious bugs in the lee-chee orchards of China.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these facts it is not surprising that Miss Ormerod became\r\nan active and valued colleague of some of England's most noted\r\nscientific men. Professor Huxley said of her in connection with certain\r\nwork performed by her as a member of one of the committees to which he\r\nbelonged that \"she knew more about the business\" than all the rest put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod's services and attainments, it is gratifying to note, were\r\nnot without recognition in high quarters. Besides being in constant\r\ncorrespondence with the most eminent entomologists of the world,\r\nconsulting entomologist to the Royal Agricultural Society of England and\r\nexaminer in agricultural entomology in the University of Edinburgh, she\r\nwas a member of many learned societies in both the Old and the New\r\nWorld. She was also the recipient of many medals, two of which came from\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe honor, however, which gave her the most pleasure was the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws, which was conferred on her by the University of\r\nEdinburgh. It was the first time this old and conservative institution\r\nthus honored a woman, but in honoring Miss Ormerod it honored itself as\r\nwell.[175]\r\n\r\nBut when one considers the magnitude of Miss Ormerod's services to her\r\ncountry and to the world, when one reflects on the tens of millions of\r\npounds sterling which she saved to the British Empire by her researches\r\nand writings, these honors seem trivial and unworthy of the great nation\r\nwhich she so signally benefited. If any of her countrymen had labored so\r\nlong and so successfully and made so many sacrifices for the welfare of\r\nthe nation as she had, he would have been knighted or ennobled. But\r\nage-long prejudices and traditions will not yet permit England to bestow\r\nthe same honors on women as on men, no matter how brilliant their\r\nattainments or how distinguished their services to the crown and to\r\nhumanity. Recognition of this kind may possibly come as one of the\r\ndesirable innovations of the twentieth century. No lover of fair play\r\ncan deny \"'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.\"[176]\r\n\r\nThe names of the women in the United States who have become prominent by\r\ntheir researches and writings in the various branches of the natural\r\nsciences would make a long list. And when one recalls the fact that it\r\nwas only in the latter part of the nineteenth century that American\r\nwomen were afforded an opportunity to study science, it is a matter of\r\nsurprise that the list is so extended. For practically no provision was\r\nmade for the serious pursuit by them of the natural sciences until the\r\nopening of Vassar College in 1865, and it was not until the closing\r\nyears of the century that the portals of many men's colleges were\r\nunlocked and thrown open to the hitherto proscribed sex. Considering all\r\nthe obstacles they had to overcome, the ignorance, the prejudice, the\r\nopposition of all kinds they had to combat in the United States, women\r\nhave already accomplished wonders and bid fair to achieve much more in\r\nthe near future.\r\n\r\nNow almost every educational institution in the land, private or state,\r\nhas one or more women professors or associate professors. They teach all\r\nthe branches of the natural sciences that are taught by their male\r\ncolleagues,--botany, geology, mineralogy, zoology, anatomy, bacteriology\r\nand all the numerous subdivisions of these sciences,--and they teach\r\nthem with success and eclat.\r\n\r\nThey also occupy responsible scientific positions in various state and\r\nfederal institutions. Thus one woman has been the principal of the\r\nDenver School of Mines, while another has been the state entomologist\r\nfor Missouri. Women are also found doing important work in the National\r\nMuseum, in the Smithsonian Institution, and in the Agricultural\r\nDepartment in Washington, as well as in the various museums, botanical\r\ngardens and public laboratories of the country from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nAmong those who have deserved well of science in the United States by\r\ntheir investigations and writings are Olive Thorne Miller and Florence\r\nMerriam in ornithology; Susanna Phelps Gage, Dr. Ida H. Hyde, Mary H.\r\nHinckley, Cornelia M. Clapp, Edith J. and Agnes M. Claypole in biology;\r\nRose S. Eigenman in icthyology; Edith M. Patch, Elizabeth W. Peckham,\r\nEmily A. Smith, Cora H. Clarke, J. M. Arms Sheldon, Mary Treat, Mary E.\r\nMurfeldt, Annie T. Slosson in entomology; Elizabeth G. Britton and Clara\r\nE. Cummings in cryptogamic botany; Sarah A. Plummer Lemmon, Katherine E.\r\nGolden, Alice Eastman and Almira Lincoln Phelps in general botany; Ada\r\nD. Davidson, Ella F. Boyd and Florence Bascom in geology. Besides these,\r\nspecial mention should also be made of Dr. Julia W. Snow for her work on\r\nthe microscopical forms of fresh-water algae; Anna Botsford Comstock for\r\nher contributions to our knowledge of microscopic insects; Katherine J.\r\nBush for her monographs on shallow and deep-water molusca; Harriet\r\nRandolph and Fannie E. Langdon for their studies on worms, and Katherine\r\nFoot for her papers on cellular morphology. Particularly notable, too,\r\nis the work that has been done on marine invertebrates by Mary J.\r\nRathbun in the United States National Museum and by Florence Wambaugh\r\nPatterson in vegetable physiology and pathology in the Department of\r\nAgriculture in Washington.\r\n\r\nBut much as the women just named deserve recognition for their\r\nachievements in the various branches of science to which they have\r\nseverally devoted themselves, the one who will always be specially\r\nremembered, not only for her valuable contributions to divers branches\r\nof natural science, but also for her labors in behalf of higher female\r\neducation--particularly as president of Radcliffe College--is Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Cary Agassiz, the wife of the celebrated Swiss-American\r\nnaturalist, who gave such an impetus to the study of natural science in\r\nthe United States, and whose influence on the general advancement of\r\nscience in all its departments has proved so enduring and so\r\nfar-reaching. As an inspirer of and collaborator with her gifted\r\nhusband, Mrs. Agassiz deserves a large page in the annals of science,\r\nwhile as an enthusiastic student of nature and as one who communicated\r\nher enthusiasm to her students, and at the same time held up before them\r\nthe highest ideals of womanhood, she is sure of a portion of that\r\nimmortality which has been decreed to her illustrious life-partner, Jean\r\nLouis Agassiz.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would not be complete without some reference to that large\r\nclass of women travelers who, directly or indirectly, have contributed\r\nso much to the advancement of the natural sciences. The gifted Roumanian\r\nwriter and traveler, Princess Helena Kolzoff Massalsky,--better known\r\nunder her pseudonym, Doria d'Istria,--somewhere expresses the opinion\r\nthat a woman traveler admirably supplements the scientific work of the\r\nmale explorer by bringing to it aptitudes that the latter does not\r\npossess. For she notes many things in nature, as well as in the national\r\nlife and popular customs of the countries which she traverses, which\r\nescape the more hebetudinous perceptions of men, and thus a vast field,\r\nthat would otherwise remain unknown, is opened to observation and\r\ncritical study.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted travelers of her sex in the nineteenth century was\r\nthe famous Ida Pfeiffer, of Austria. During the years intervening\r\nbetween 1842 and 1858, the date of her death, she traveled nearly two\r\nhundred thousand miles and, in so doing, visited nearly every quarter of\r\nthe globe. When one recalls the difficulties and discomforts of\r\ntransportation in the early part of the last century, as compared with\r\nour present facilities and conveniences, and bears in mind the fact that\r\nher traveling expenses for an entire year were less than those of a\r\nLamartine or a Chateaubriand for a single week, we must admit that her\r\nachievements were, indeed, extraordinary.\r\n\r\nBesides being the author of numerous books which had for many years a\r\ngreat vogue--books which, by reason of the keen observations and the\r\nabsolutely truthful narratives of their author, are still of special\r\nvalue to the student of geography and ethnology--she made collections\r\nillustrative of botany, mineralogy and entomology which were\r\nsubsequently secured for the British Museum and other similar\r\ninstitutions in Europe.\r\n\r\nNo one more highly appreciated Frau Pfeiffer's efforts in behalf of\r\nscience than did the illustrious Alexander von Humboldt, whose\r\nfriendship was one of the greatest joys of this remarkable woman's life.\r\nThrough his recommendation and that of the noted geographer, Karl\r\nRitter, she was made an honorary member of the Geographical Society of\r\nBerlin. Besides this, the King of Prussia conferred on her the gold\r\nmedal for arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nThree other women, all representatives of Great Britain, likewise\r\ndeserve notice for their extensive travels and the interesting and\r\ninstructive accounts which they published of them. These are Constance\r\nGordon Cumming, Isabella Bird Bishop and Amelia B. Edwards.\r\n\r\nMore notable in many respects than these three distinguished women were\r\nMiss Mary H. Kingsley and Madame Octavie Coudreau. For their\r\ncontributions to science and for their daring adventures in savage\r\nlands, they have won for themselves an unique position among women\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\nMiss Kingsley--the niece of the well-known writer and naturalist,\r\nCharles Kingsley--exhibited much of her uncle's literary ability and\r\nlove of nature. So complete was her intellectual grasp of the most\r\ndifficult problems, and so rare was her overflowing sympathy for all of\r\nGod's creatures, that she was well described as possessing \"the brain of\r\na man and the heart of a woman.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to get at first-hand information that was necessary to complete\r\na work which her father, George Kingsley, had, owing to his premature\r\ndeath, left unfinished, she determined to visit that part of West Africa\r\n\"where all authorities agreed that the Africans were at their wildest\r\nand worst.\" Accompanied only by the natives, she travelled among\r\ncannibals, pushed her way through mangrove swamps and pestilential\r\nmorasses. She spent months in a canoe exploring the territory watered by\r\nthe Calabar and Ogowe rivers, often in imminent peril of death from wild\r\nanimals or wilder men.\r\n\r\nWhen not studying the manners and customs of the native tribes, she was\r\nhunting fishes and reptiles in streams and quagmires and collecting\r\ninsects in the weird, grim twilight of the equatorial forest with its\r\ninextricable tangle of creepers, its great hanging tapestries of vines\r\nand flowers, its myriads of bush-ropes, suspended from the summits of\r\ntall buttressed trees, \"some as straight as plumb lines, others coiled\r\nround and intertwined among each other until one could fancy one was\r\nlooking on some mighty battle between armies of gigantic serpents that\r\nhad been arrested at its height by some mighty spell.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of Miss Kingsley's wanderings in this dark and uncanny\r\nwilderness and among the savage tribes visited by her were her two\r\ninstructive volumes entitled _Travels in West Africa_ and _West African\r\nStudies_. In addition to these two works from her pen there are\r\ndeposited in the British Museum an interesting collection of insects,\r\nfishes and reptiles--many of them new species and some of them named in\r\nher honor--which testifies to her activity as a collector and her\r\nenthusiasm as a naturalist.\r\n\r\nHer brilliant and useful career was cut short in Cape Colony, whither\r\nshe had gone as an army nurse during the Boer war. In view of her\r\nachievements one is not surprised to learn that her countrymen regarded\r\nher premature taking-off as a national misfortune. The noblest monument\r\nto her memory is \"The Mary Kingsley Society of West Africa,\" whose\r\nobject is to carry on, as far as may be, the beneficent work she began\r\non the West African coast and to accomplish for English rule in this\r\npart of the world what the \"Royal Asiatic Society\" has achieved for\r\nBritish administration in India.\r\n\r\nMadame Coudreau is designated in _Qui Etes-Vous_--the French Who's\r\nWho--as an _exploratrice_. This well characterizes her; for, if not the\r\nfirst woman explorer by profession, she is certainly the most energetic\r\nand successful.\r\n\r\nHer first work was in French Guiana, under instructions from the\r\ncolonial minister of France. This was in 1894. The following year she\r\nbegan the scientific exploration of the province of Para in northern\r\nBrazil, in collaboration with her husband, Henri Coudreau, who had\r\npreviously distinguished himself by his achievements as a writer and as\r\nan explorer in French Guiana. The fruit of their joint work from 1895 to\r\n1899 was six quarto volumes profusely illustrated by photographs which\r\nthey had taken and by carefully executed charts of the various rivers\r\nwhich they had explored.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the exploration of the Trombetas, a tributary of the\r\nAmazon, Henri Coudreau was taken seriously ill, and, after a few days'\r\nstruggle against the disease with which he was stricken, he expired in\r\nthe depths of the forest primeval, where he was buried by his desolate\r\nand disconsolate widow. After such a calamity any other woman would\r\nhave left the tropics at once and returned to her home and friends. Not\r\nso Mme. Coudreau. With matchless courage and determination she buried\r\nher grief in the work in which her husband had been so interested, and,\r\nafter completing the unfinished survey, published the results of this\r\nexpedition under the title _Voyage au Trombetas_.\r\n\r\nHaving completed this work, she was engaged by the states of Para and\r\nAmazonas to explore a number of other rivers in the vast territory known\r\nas Amazonia. This commission involved the most arduous and dangerous\r\nkind of labor and was a task which few men would have been willing to\r\nundertake. It is doubtful if any other woman would have ventured on such\r\nan expedition, and it is quite certain that no other one could have been\r\nfound that was so well equipped for this herculean undertaking or who\r\nwould have carried it to a more successful issue.\r\n\r\nMme. Coudreau was in the service of Amazonia, in the capacity of\r\nofficial explorer, from 1899 to 1906. Most of this time she spent in a\r\ncanoe on the affluents of the Amazon, or in her tent in the dense\r\nforests under the equator. Her only companions were negroes, or Indians,\r\nor Brazilian halfbreeds who served her as porters, cooks and boatmen.\r\nFrequently they were in the forest wilds for many months at a time and\r\nfar away from every vestige of civilized life. As it was impossible to\r\ntake sufficient provisions with them to last them during the whole of\r\ntheir journey, they had to depend on wild fruits and such fish and game\r\nas they were able to secure. Often they were forced to live for weeks at\r\na time on an unchanging diet of manioc and tapir meat.\r\n\r\nBut their sufferings were not confined to hunger and disagreeable--often\r\nindigestible--food. There were the heavy steaming atmosphere and the\r\nbroiling rays of a superheated sun, especially when reflected from the\r\nmirror-like surface of lake or river, which were so debilitating and\r\nexhausting that physical exertion of any kind was at times almost\r\nimpossible. There were also the torrential and incessant rains--making\r\nit impossible for them to cook their food or dry their clothing--which\r\nadded to their miseries whether in camp or in their canoe.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as were their trials on the river, they were trifling in\r\ncomparison with those in the woods. Here locomotion was impeded by\r\ntangled undergrowth which was bound together by strands of lianas and\r\nthorny vines which constituted an impenetrable barrier until a passage\r\nwas hewn through it with a machete. Under foot was a yielding morass\r\nwhich threatened to absorb them. Overhead were countless chigoes,\r\ngarapatas and fire-ants which infested the body or buried themselves in\r\nthe flesh. Or there were clouds of mosquitoes which gave no rest day or\r\nnight. And worst of all was the ever-present danger of fever and\r\ndysentery, not to speak of the dread diseases so common in certain\r\nsections of the equatorial regions. It was then that Mme. Coudreau had\r\nto act the part of a physician, as well as of a leader, even though she\r\nwas at the time such a sufferer herself that she was barely able to\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nTo make matters still more difficult for Mme. Coudreau, her employees at\r\ntimes, especially when under the influence of liquor which they\r\ncontrived to obtain some way or other, became mutinous and refused to\r\naccompany her to the end of her journey. At other times the expedition\r\nwas halted by their fear of wild beasts or savage Indians, or by\r\nimaginary evils of many kinds, suggested to them by their superstitious\r\nminds. On such occasions Mme. Coudreau never failed to show herself a\r\nborn leader of men, for she invariably--alone as she was with a crew who\r\nwere often half savages--was successful in suppressing incipient\r\nrebellion and in restoring obedience and order.[177]\r\n\r\nContinually confronted, as she was, by such trials and difficulties,\r\nprivations and dangers, one would imagine that the delicately reared\r\nFrenchwoman would have sought immediate release from an engagement that\r\nnecessitated so much exposure and suffering and sought surcease of\r\nsorrow in the distractions and gaieties of pleasure-loving Paris.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was farther from her thoughts. Intrepid and\r\nresourceful, she feared no danger and hesitated before no difficulty,\r\nhowever great. As an explorer she was as venturesome as Crevaux and as\r\nconscientious as La Condamine. Like them, who were both her countrymen,\r\nshe spent many years of her life in the equinoctial regions, and, like\r\nthem, she contributed immensely to our knowledge of the Land of the\r\nSouthern Cross.\r\n\r\nNever did the tropics have a greater fascination for anyone than for\r\nMme. Coudreau. During the twelve years she spent there, exploring its\r\nrivers and traversing its interminable forests, the spell of Amazonia\r\nwas ever upon her and was never broken, even for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" she writes, \"loved everything in Amazonia, the great majestic\r\nwoodland and the mysterious virgin forest, the beautiful rivers with\r\ntheir traitorous waters and thundering cataracts, the suffocating air\r\nand the perfumed breeze, the burning sun and the sweet freshness of\r\nnight, the impressive voice of the wind among the trees and the\r\ntorrential rain. And, contrary to the usual custom of man of bringing\r\neverything under his domination, it is I who have become a captive of\r\nthis savage life which I love, and have permitted it to take possession\r\nof all my soul and all my will.\"[178]\r\n\r\nElsewhere she declares: \"In the solitude of the virgin forest I am calm,\r\ntranquil, experience no ennui and am almost merry. When I am obliged to\r\nleave the great woodland the power to struggle grows less in me. I\r\nbecome of an excessive sensibility. I feel more keenly life's blows. I\r\nam not armed for elbowing my way and making a place for myself in the\r\nsunshine. I neither love nor understand anything except my virgin\r\nforest. There, indeed, I suffer from the inclemency of the weather, from\r\nhunger, from sickness; but these are only physical sufferings and are\r\nsoon forgotten, while moral and interior pains, on the contrary, are\r\nineradicable.\"[179]\r\n\r\nAnd still again she tells us: \"The solitude of the virgin forest has\r\nbecome a necessity for me; it attracts me by its mysterious silence, and\r\nonly in the great woods have I the impression of being at home.\"[180]\r\n\r\nCan we wonder that such an ardent lover of Nature and such a strenuous\r\nvotary of science was able to forget herself in her work and was able,\r\nnotwithstanding her toils and her sufferings, to produce six quarto\r\nvolumes of reports, in as many years, on the unexplored regions which\r\nshe had so carefully surveyed and charted? Can we be surprised that her\r\nlabors received due recognition from learned societies in both the New\r\nand the Old World, and that she was acclaimed as an explorer who had\r\nrendered distinct service to the cause of natural science, as well as to\r\ngeography?[181]\r\n\r\nWhen we recall the labors of this lone daughter of France in the wilds\r\nof the tropics, with no one to communicate with except her\r\nhalf-civilized servants and boatmen, we instinctively hark back to days\r\nnot long past and estimate the enormous progress women have made in\r\nsocial and intellectual freedom within but a few decades.\r\n\r\nOwing to the policy of repression which so long prevailed regarding the\r\nintellectual efforts of women, and the social obstacles which prevented\r\nthem from publicly acknowledging the offspring of their genius, women\r\nlike the Bronte sisters, George Sand and George Eliot were compelled to\r\nconceal their identity under male designations. Because it was\r\nconsidered immodest for a woman to appear before the public as an\r\nauthor, Lady Nairne, after Burns, the most popular song writer in\r\nScotland, felt obliged to keep secret the authorship of her beautiful\r\npoems.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, family honor made it incumbent on Fanny Mendelssohn to\r\nrefrain from publishing her musical compositions under her own name.\r\nAccordingly, they appeared along with those of her brother Felix, and so\r\nsimilar are they in color and sentiment to his own productions that they\r\nare indistinguishable from them, unless the author's signature be\r\nattached. To satisfy an inane public opinion, they long contributed \"to\r\nswell the volume of her brother's fame,\" and there is reason to believe\r\nthat some of them still appear under his name at the present day.\r\n\r\nYes, truly, when one recalls these and similar facts, one cannot help\r\nexclaiming: \"What a marvelous change in the attitude of the world toward\r\nwomen within the memories of those still living!\" Women like Miss\r\nOrmerod, Miss Kingsley and Mme. Coudreau would have been ostracized if\r\nthey had dared to attempt, in the days of Lady Nairne, the Bronte\r\nsisters and Fanny Mendelssohn, what they may now do not only without\r\ncensure but without exciting more than passing comment. The ban has been\r\nlifted from what was for ages tabu for women, and the sphere of their\r\nintellectual activities is now almost coextensive with that of the\r\nsterner sex. Not only does society no longer point the finger of scorn\r\nat the woman naturalist or the woman explorer, but it showers honors on\r\nher while living and erects monuments to her memory when dead. A great\r\nchange, indeed, and one long and ardently desired. Verily, _tempora\r\nmutantur, nos et mutamur in illis_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[164] In his erudite work, _Geschichte der Botanik_, Vol. III, p. 517,\r\nKoenigsberg, 1856, Ernest H. F. Meyer gives in a few words his estimate\r\nof the excellence of Hildegard's _Physica_: \"Aber als ehrwuerdiges\r\nDenkmal des Alterthums und einer zu jener Zeit nicht gemeinen\r\nNaturkentniss empfehlen sich zumal deutschen Naturforschern ihre vier\r\nBuecher der _Physica_.... Denn nicht nur der deutsche Botaniker und\r\nZoologe finden in ihrer Physik fast die ersten rohen Anfaenge\r\nvaterlaendische Naturforshung, auch dem Artzt bietet sic fuer jene Zeit\r\nueberraschende Erscheinung dar, eine nicht von Dioskorides abgeleitete,\r\nsondern unverkennbar aus der Volksueberlieferung geschoepfte\r\nHeilmittellehre; und der Sprachforscher stoesst im lateinischen Text\r\nbeinahe Zeile um Zeile auf deutsche Ausdruecke seltener Sprachformen.\"\r\n\r\n[165] Hildegardis _Opera Omnia_, p. 1122, Migne's Edition, Paris, 1882.\r\n\r\n[166] \"Constat permulta S. Hildegardi nota jam fuisse, quae caeteri medii\r\naevi scriptores nescierunt, quaeque sagaces demum recentiorum temporum\r\nindagatores reperierunt ac tamquam nova ventitarunt.\" Ibid. Dr. Karl\r\nJessen, in his thoughtful _Botanik der Gegenwart und Vorzeit in\r\nCulturhistorischer Entwickelung_, p. 123, Leipzig, 1864, expresses\r\nhimself on the extraordinary medical knowledge of the abbess of Bingen\r\nas follows: \"Wer deutsche Volkarznei studieren will, der studiere\r\nHildegard und er wird Respect davor bekommen.\"\r\n\r\n[167] _Compendio Storico della Scuola Anatomica di Bologna_, p. 358, by\r\nMichele Medici, Bologna, 1857, and _Notizie degli Scrittori Bolognesi_,\r\nTom. VI, p. 113, by Giovanni Fantuzzi, Bologna, 1788.\r\n\r\nCertain writers tell us of another woman who distinguished herself in\r\nanatomy in the early part of the fourteenth century. Her name was\r\nAlessandra Giliani, who is said to have been a pupil and an assistant of\r\nthe celebrated Mondino, father of modern anatomy. In addition to\r\npossessing great skill in dissection, she is reputed to have devised a\r\nmeans of drawing the blood from the veins and arteries--even the most\r\nminute--and then filling them with variously colored liquids which\r\nquickly solidified. By this means, we are told, she was able to exhibit\r\nthe circulatory system in all its details and complexity, and to have\r\nalways on hand, for purposes of instruction, a model that was absolutely\r\ntrue to nature.\r\n\r\nHow much truth there may be in these statements regarding a young girl,\r\nwho was only nineteen when she died, is difficult to determine. Medici,\r\nin concluding his account of her and referring to the inscription on her\r\ntomb, which seems to authenticate all the claims made for her, expresses\r\nhimself as follows: \"In quoting this document, I do not intend that my\r\nreaders shall accord to it a credence that I myself abstain from giving\r\nit, but only that they may know of it, if for no other reason than to\r\nsatisfy their curiosity.\" Op. cit., pp. 30 and 362, note I. Should the\r\ntraditions regarding this precocious girl be verified, it would be most\r\ngratifying to the people of Bologna, for it would add one more to the\r\nlong list of her illustrious women.\r\n\r\n[168] The titles of the two works of this remarkable woman are of\r\nsufficient interest to be given in full. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Veritable Declaration de la Decouverte des Mines et Minieres par le\r\nMoyen desquelles Sa Majeste et Sujets se peuvent passer des Pays\r\nEtrangers_, Paris, 1632.\r\n\r\n2. _La Restitution de Pluton a Mgr. l'Eminent Card. de Richelieu, des\r\nMines et Minieres de France, cachees jusqu'a present au Ventre de la\r\nTerre, par la Moyen desquelles les Finances de sa Majeste seront\r\nbeaucoup plus Grandes que celles de tous les Princes Chrestiens et ses\r\nSujets plus Heureux de tous les Peuples._ Paris, 1640.\r\n\r\n[169] _Die Verdienste der Frauen um Naturwissenschaft and Heilkunde_, p.\r\n169, von Dr. C. F. Harless, Goettingen, 1830.\r\n\r\n[170] The Latin title of this interesting work is _De Generatione et\r\nMetamorphose Insectorum Surinamensium_, Amsterdam, 1705.\r\n\r\n[171] The Latin edition of this work is entitled _Erucarum Ortus,\r\nAlimenta et Paradoxa Metamorphosis_, Amsterdam, 1718. It was afterwards\r\ntranslated into French and published under the title _Histoire des\r\nInsectes de l'Europe_.\r\n\r\n[172] _Die Leistungen der deutschen Frau in den letzen vierhundert\r\nJahren auf wissenschaftlichem Gebiebte_, p. 85, von Elise Oelsner,\r\nGuhrau, 1894.\r\n\r\n[173] In his preface to _Les Maladies des Vers a Soie_.\r\n\r\n[174] It is estimated that the loss to the United States from cattle\r\nticks alone is $100,000,000 a year. According to the year-book of the\r\nAgricultural Department for 1904, the annual losses to agriculture from\r\ndestructive insects reach the enormous sum of $420,000,000.\r\n\r\n[175] The dean of the law faculty in presenting Miss Ormerod to the\r\nvice-chancellor on this occasion and speaking before an audience of\r\nthree thousand people said, among other things: \"The preeminent position\r\nwhich Miss Ormerod holds in the world of science is the reward of\r\npatient study and unwearying observation. Her investigations have been\r\nchiefly directed towards the discovery of methods for the prevention of\r\nthe ravages of those insects which are injurious to orchard, field and\r\nforest. Her labors have been crowned with such success, that she is\r\nentitled to be hailed as the protectress of agriculture and the fruits\r\nof the earth--a beneficent Demeter of the nineteenth century.\" _Eleanor\r\nOrmerod, Economic Entomologist, Autobiography and Correspondence_,\r\nEdited by Robert Wallace, p. 96, London, 1904.\r\n\r\n[176] _The Canadian Entomologist_, September, 1901, in an obituary\r\nnotice of Miss Ormerod, well voiced the high appreciation in which she\r\nwas held throughout the civilized world in the following paragraph:\r\n\"Miss Ormerod was one of the most remarkable women of the latter half of\r\nthe nineteenth century and did more than any one else in the British\r\nIsles to further the interests of farmers, fruit-growers and gardeners\r\nby making known to them methods for controlling and subduing their\r\nmultiform insect pests. Her labors were unwearied and unselfish; she\r\nreceived no remuneration for her services, but cheerfully expended her\r\nprivate means in carrying out her investigations and publishing their\r\nresults. We know not now by whom in England this work can be continued;\r\nit is not likely that anyone can follow in the unique path laid out by\r\nMiss Ormerod; we may, therefore, cherish the hope that the Government of\r\nthe day will hold out a helping hand and establish an entomological\r\nbureau for the lasting benefit of the great agricultural interests of\r\nthe country.\" Professor J. Ritzema Bos, the distinguished entomologist\r\nof Holland, had no hesitation in proclaiming Miss Ormerod the first\r\neconomic entomologist in England and one of the most famous economic\r\nentomologists in the world.\r\n\r\n[177] The following dialogue between Mme. Coudreau and one of her\r\nboatmen, Joas-Felix, who was the spokesman of his companions,\r\nillustrates not only the bravery of the daring explorer, but also the\r\npusillanimity of her half-breed personnel when in the depths of the\r\nforest at night:\r\n\r\n\"'Madam has no fear?'\r\n\r\n\"'Fear of what?'\r\n\r\n\"'Of tigers.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, it is not of tigers that I have fear.'\r\n\r\n\"'Of Indians?'\r\n\r\n\"'Neither have I fear of Indians.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then, madam, it is something which is in the woods, which we do not\r\nknow, that can harm us.'\r\n\r\n\"'You know very well what frightens me. I am afraid that the bats will\r\nattack my chickens during the night. If you hear them making a noise you\r\nmust get up.'\r\n\r\n\"I laugh heartily in observing their astonished look and ask myself how\r\nmen whose consciences are stained with many bloody crimes can have fear\r\nhere. Joas-Felix gives me the explanation:\r\n\r\n\"'Madam makes game of us. None the less, madam, I am a man in the city\r\nand in the savanna. With my poignard and machete I fear nothing, neither\r\nman nor beast. But here, madam, where everything is dark, even in the\r\ndaytime; where an enemy may be lying in wait for us behind every tree;\r\nit is not the same thing. It would be impossible for me to live in the\r\nforest. One cannot see far enough in it.'\r\n\r\n\"Now I understand better their terror. The mysterious depth of the\r\nvirgin forest impresses them. The opaque obscurity of the night in the\r\nunderwood contrasts too strongly with the moonlit savanna where they\r\nhave been reared. The low and sombre vault of the woods oppresses them\r\nand they imagine they are going to be crushed. They lose their heads and\r\nsee in every tree a phantom enemy. To reason with them is useless, for\r\nwhen fear takes possession of them, there is nothing to be done.\"\r\n_Voyage au Maycuru_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[178] _Voyage au Maycuru_, p. 1, Paris, 1903.\r\n\r\n[179] _Voyage au Rio Curua_, p. 85, Paris, 1903.\r\n\r\n[180] Ibid., p. 1.\r\n\r\n[181] In order that the reader may realize the immense extent of\r\nterritory that was covered by this strenuous woman's explorations,\r\nduring the twelve years she spent in Amazonia, it suffices to give the\r\ntitles of her books, all of which are profusely illustrated by\r\nphotographs taken by herself and by accurate charts of rivers, whose\r\ncourses were previously almost unknown.\r\n\r\nThe books written in collaboration with her husband are _Voyage au\r\nTapajos_, _Voyage au Xingu_, _Voyage au Tocantins-Araguaya_, _Voyage au\r\nItaboca et a l'Etacayuna_, _Voyage entre Tocantins et Xingu_, _et Voyage\r\nau Yamunda_.\r\n\r\nThe books written by Mme. Coudreau after her husband's death are _Voyage\r\nau Trombetas_, _Voyage au Cumina_, _Voyage au Rio Curua_, _Voyage a la\r\nMapuera_ and _Voyage au Maycuru_.\r\n\r\nWhen one remembers that many of the watercourses here named would be\r\nconsidered large rivers outside of South America; that, notwithstanding\r\ntheir countless rapids and waterfalls, necessitating numberless\r\nportages, Mme. Coudreau explored all these rivers from their embouchures\r\nto as near their sources as the water would carry her rude dugouts, we\r\ncan form some idea of the miles she traveled and of the stupendous labor\r\nthat was involved in making these long journeys in the sweltering and\r\ndebilitating and insect-laden atmosphere of the Amazon basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs woman was the first nurse, so was she also the first practitioner of\r\nthe healing art. Among savages the world over it is the women, in the\r\ngreat majority of cases, who have the care of the sick and wounded, and\r\nwho, by reason of their superior knowledge of simples for the cure of\r\ndiseases, occupy the position of doctors. In certain parts of the\r\nuncivilized world there are, it is true, shamans or medicine men; but\r\nthese are conjurers or exorcists, who profess to expel disease, or\r\nrather the evil spirits causing the disease, by sorcery or incantation,\r\nrather than physicians who essay to cure ailments or relieve suffering\r\nby the use of substances which experience has showed to possess remedial\r\nproperties. In a word, the shaman is a kind of a religious functionary\r\nwho imposes on the ignorance of his tribe and who holds his position by\r\nthe fear he excites, and not by any knowledge he possesses of the\r\nhealing art. It was the same, we may believe, in the early history of\r\nour race--women, and not men, were the first physicians; and they were\r\nalso most probably the first surgeons.\r\n\r\nAccording to Greek mythology, the god of the medical art was Aesculapius,\r\na male; but his six daughters, as antiquity beautifully expressed it,\r\nwere not only goddesses but were also medical mistresses--_artifices\r\nmedici_--of suffering humanity. Of these Hygiea was specially\r\ndistinguished as the goddess of health, or, rather, as the conserver of\r\ngood health, while Panacea was invoked as the restorer of health after\r\nit had been impaired or lost.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful pictures in the Iliad is that representing the\r\ndaughter of Augea, King of the Epei, caring for the wounded and\r\nsuffering Greeks on the plain before Troy. She was:\r\n\r\n    \"His eldest born, hight Agamede, with golden hair,\r\n    A leech was she, and well she knew all herbs on ground that grew.\"\r\n\r\nNothing deterred by the din of battle around her, she provided cordial\r\npotions for the disabled warrior and prepared\r\n\r\n    \"The gentle bath and washed their gory wounds.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a beautiful prototype of another ministering angel in the same land\r\nnearly thirty centuries later, amid similar scenes of suffering--of one\r\nwho, though unsung by immortal bard, the world will never let die--the\r\ncourageous, the self-sacrificing Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\nThat there were in Greece from the earliest times numerous women\r\npossessed of a high degree of medical skill is evidenced by many of the\r\nancient writers. They were what we would call medical herbalists, and\r\nnot a few of them exhibited a natural genius for determining the\r\ncurative virtues of rare plants and a remarkable sagacity in preparing\r\nfrom them juices, infusions and soothing anodynes. Others there were\r\nwho, in addition to evincing the cunning of leechcraft in the\r\ntherapeutic art, were distinguished for nimble hands in treating painful\r\nlesions and festering sores, and who, when occasion required, were\r\nexperts in \"quickly drawing the barb from the flesh and healing the\r\nwound of the soldier.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Odyssey special mention is made of the surpassing expertness of\r\nthe Egyptian female leech, Polydamna, whose name signifies the subduer\r\nof many diseases. The land of the Nile, the poet tells us, \"teems with\r\ndrugs,\" and\r\n\r\n    \"There ev'ry man in skill medicinal\r\n    Excels, for these are sons of Paeon all.\"\r\n\r\nIn this favored cradle of civilization, to which Greece owed so much of\r\nits knowledge and culture, there were many women who, like Polydamna,\r\nachieved distinction in the healing art, and many, too, we have reason\r\nto think, who communicated their knowledge to their sisters in the fair\r\nland of Hellas.\r\n\r\nBut not only were there in Greece women physicians like Agamede, who\r\nwere noted for their general medicinal knowledge and practice, but there\r\nwere also others who made a specialty of treating ailments peculiar to\r\ntheir own sex. This we learn from a passage in the _Hippolytus_ of\r\nEuripides, wherein the nurse of Phaedra addressed the suffering queen in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n                                \"If under pains\r\n    Thou labor, such as may not be revealed,\r\n    To succor thee thy female friends are here.\r\n    But if the other sex may know thy sufferings\r\n    Let the physician try his healing art.\"\r\n\r\nMore positive information, however, is afforded us by the ancient Roman\r\nauthor Hyginus, who, in writing of the Greek maiden, Agnodice, tells us\r\nhow the medical profession was legalized for all the free-born women of\r\nAthens. Instead of a literal translation of Hyginus, the version of his\r\nstory is given in the quaint language of one Mrs. Celleor, a noted\r\nmidwife in the reign of James II.\r\n\r\n\"Among the subtile Athenians,\" writes Mrs. Celleor, \"a law at one time\r\nforbade women to study or practice medicine or physick on pain of death,\r\nwhich law continued some time, during which many women perished, both in\r\nchild-bearing and by private diseases, their modesty not permitting them\r\nto admit of men either to deliver or cure them. But God finally stirred\r\nup the spirit of Agnodice, a noble maid, to pity the miserable condition\r\nof her own sex, and hazard her life to help them; which, to enable\r\nherself to do, she apparelled her like a man and became the scholar of\r\nHierophilos, the most learned physician of the time; and, having learnt\r\nthe art, she found out a woman that had long languished under private\r\ndiseases, and made proffer of her service to cure her, which the sick\r\nperson refused, thinking her to be a man; but, when Agnodice discovered\r\nthat she was a maid, the woman committed herself into her hands, who\r\ncured her perfectly; and after her many others, with the like skill and\r\nindustry, so that in a short time she became the successful and beloved\r\nphysician of the whole sex.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that Agnodice was a woman \"she was like to be\r\ncondemned to death for transgressing the law--which, coming to the ears\r\nof the noble women, they ran before the Areopagites, and, the house\r\nbeing encompassed by most women of the city, the ladies entered before\r\nthe judges and told them they would no longer account them for husbands\r\nand friends, but for cruel enemies, that condemned her to death who\r\nrestored to them their health, protesting they would all die with her if\r\nshe were put to death. This caused the magistrates to disannul the law\r\nand make another, which gave gentlewomen leave to study and practice all\r\nparts of physick to their own sex, giving large stipends to those that\r\ndid it well and carefully. And there were many noble women who studied\r\nthat practice and taught it publicly in their schools as long as Athens\r\nflourished in learning.\"[182]\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Agnodice many Greek women won distinction in medicine,\r\nsome as practitioners in the healing art, others as writers on medical\r\nsubjects. Nor were their activities confined to the land of Hellas. They\r\nwere also found succoring the infirm and instructing the poor and\r\nignorant in Italy, Egypt and Asia Minor. Among these was Theano, the\r\nwife of Pythagoras, who, after her husband's death, assumed charge of\r\nhis school of philosophy, and who, like her husband and teacher, was\r\ndistinguished for her attainments in medicine. The names of many others\r\noccur in the pages of Hippocrates, Galen and Pliny; and frequent\r\nreferences are made to the works and prescriptions of women doctors who\r\nenjoyed more than ordinary celebrity during their time. Of these female\r\npractitioners many confined their practice to the diseases of women and\r\nchildren, while others excelled in surgery and pharmacy, as well as in\r\ngeneral medical practice.\r\n\r\nAmong the medical women whom antiquity especially honored, particularly\r\nduring the Greco-Roman period, were Origenia, Aspasia--not the famous\r\nwife of Pericles--and Cleopatra, who was not, however, as is often\r\nasserted, the ill-fated queen of Egypt. Likewise deserving of special\r\nmention was Metradora, of whom there is still preserved in Florence a\r\nmanuscript work on the diseases of women,[183] and Antiochis, to whom\r\nher admiring countrymen erected a statue bearing the following\r\ninscription: \"Antiochis, daughter of Diodotos of Tlos; the council and\r\nthe commune of the city of Tlos, in appreciation of her medical ability,\r\nerected at their own expense this statue in her honor.\"\r\n\r\nPliny, the naturalist, felicitates the Romans on having been for nearly\r\nsix hundred years free from the brood of doctors. These he does not\r\nhesitate to berate roundly. His statement regarding the non-existence of\r\nphysicians, it must be observed, is somewhat exaggerated. It is true\r\nthat during the first five centuries there were no professional doctors\r\nwho lived entirely on their practice. There were, however, many men who\r\nhad by long experience gained an extensive knowledge of drugs and\r\nsimples, and who were able to dress wounds and treat diseases with\r\nconsiderable success.\r\n\r\nThe first Greek freeman to practice medicine in Rome was one Archagatos,\r\nabout two centuries B.C. He was soon followed by one of his countrymen\r\nnamed Asclepiades. These two soon built up a great reputation as\r\nsuccessful practitioners, and were held in the highest esteem by the\r\npeople of Rome. In consequence of this and of the favorable conditions\r\noffered foreigners for the practice of the healing art, there was soon a\r\nlarge influx of physicians and surgeons from Greece, not only into Rome\r\nbut also into other parts of Italy.\r\n\r\nNot long after the arrival of Greek doctors in the capital of the Roman\r\nworld we learn of certain women physicians in Rome who were held in high\r\nrepute. Among these were Victoria and Leoparda, both mentioned by the\r\nmedical writer, Theodorus Priscianus. To Victoria, Priscianus dedicates\r\nthe third book of his _Rerum Medicarum_, and in the preface to this book\r\nhe refers to her as one who has not only an accurate knowledge of\r\nmedicine, but also as one who is a keen observer and experienced\r\npractitioner.\r\n\r\nThe word _medica_, which occurs in Latin authors of the classical\r\nperiod, testifies to the existence of the woman doctor as early as the\r\nage of Augustus.\r\n\r\nBut the most important documents bearing on women physicians, not only\r\nin the city of Rome but also in Italy, Gaul and the Iberian peninsula,\r\nare the large body of epigraphic monuments which have recently been\r\nbrought to light, and which prove beyond all doubt that women were not\r\nonly obstetricians, but that they were successful practitioners in the\r\nentire field of medical art. Thus a funeral tablet found in Portugal\r\ntells of a woman who was a most excellent physician--_medica\r\noptima_--while another describes the deceased not only as a woman\r\nincomparable for her virtues, but also as a mistress of medical\r\nscience, _antistes disciplinae in medicina fuit_.\r\n\r\nThe Greek word for _medica_--_iatromaia_--occasionally found in some of\r\nthe inscriptions, seems to refer specially to women of Greek origin or\r\nbirth. This is particularly true of a monument erected to one Valiae, who\r\nis designated as _Kalista iatromaia_--the best doctor.[184]\r\n\r\nAmong the many women who became converts to Christianity during the\r\nearly ages of the church a goodly number were physicians. Unfortunately,\r\nour information respecting these votaries of the healing art is not as\r\ncomplete as we could wish. One of the most noted of them is St.\r\nTheodosia, whose name is given in the Roman martyrology for the\r\ntwenty-ninth of May. She was the mother of the martyr, St. Procopius,\r\nand was distinguished for her knowledge of medicine and surgery, both of\r\nwhich she practiced in Rome with the most signal success. She died a\r\nheroic death by the sword during the persecution of Diocletian.\r\n\r\nAnother woman who was as eminent for her knowledge of medicine as for\r\nher holiness of life was St. Nicerata, who lived in Constantinople\r\nduring the reign of the emperor Arcadius. She is said to have cured St.\r\nJohn Chrysostom of an affection of the stomach from which he was a\r\nsufferer.\r\n\r\nTo the Roman lady Fabiola, remarkable as the daughter of one of the most\r\nillustrious patrician families of Rome, but more remarkable for her\r\nsanctity and her boundless charity toward the poor, was due the erection\r\nof the first hospital--a noble structure which she founded in Ostia, at\r\nthe mouth of the Tiber, which was then the port of entry to the capital\r\nof the Roman empire. Here the noble matron received the poor and\r\nsuffering from all parts, and did everything in her power to afford\r\nthem succor in their wants and infirmities.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us now, when hospitals and charitable institutions\r\nof all kinds are so common, to understand what an innovation Fabiola's\r\nunheard-of institution was considered by her contemporaries. For her\r\nmethod of treating the needy and the suffering was as different from\r\nthat which had hitherto obtained as were the debasing lessons of\r\nheathendom from the elevating precepts of the Gospels.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the news of this godlike work was soon wafted to the\r\nuttermost bounds of the earth; that, in the words of St. Jerome, \"summer\r\nshould announce in Britain what Egypt and Parthia had learned in the\r\nspring.\" No wonder that the same eloquent hermit of Bethlehem should\r\nproclaim the foundress of this home of the indigent and the afflicted to\r\nbe \"the glory of the church, the astonishment of the Gentiles, the\r\nmother of the poor and the consolation of the saints.\" No wonder that,\r\nin contemplating her countless acts of charity, he should ignore the\r\nfact that Fabiola was a daughter of the Fabii and a descendant of the\r\nrenowned Quintus Maximus, who, by his sage counsel, had saved his\r\ncountry from her enemies, and that, recalling the words of Virgil, he\r\nshould declare: \"If I had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths and\r\niron lungs, I should not be able to enumerate all the maladies to which\r\nFabiola gave the most prodigal care and tenderness--to the extent even\r\nof making the poor who were in health envy the good fortune of those who\r\nwere sick.\"[185] No wonder that Fabiola's funeral, which brought\r\ntogether the whole of Rome, was more like an apotheosis than the\r\ntransfer of the remains of the deceased to their last resting-place, and\r\nthat Jerome should declare, \"the glory of Furius and Papirius and\r\nScipio and Pompey, when they triumphed over the Gauls, the Sammites,\r\nNumantia and Pontus\" was less than that which was spontaneously accorded\r\nto Fabiola, the solace of the sick and the comforter of the distressed.\r\nFor she had in her hospital at Ostia established a type of institution\r\nthat was to effect more for ameliorating the condition of suffering\r\nhumanity than anything that had before been dreamed of; something that\r\nwas to contribute immensely to the efforts of physicians and surgeons in\r\nminimizing the sad ravages of wounds and disease; something whose\r\nbeneficent effects were to be felt through the centuries and in every\r\npart of the world down to the wards of the military hospital at Scutari,\r\nguarded by the watchful eyes of Florence Nightingale, and to the\r\nleper-tenanted lazarettos, blessed by the ministrations of Father Damien\r\nand the Sisters of Charity, on the desolate shores of plague-stricken\r\nMolokai.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Roman empire and through the long period of the\r\nMiddle Ages, when the monasteries and convents were almost the only\r\ncenters of learning and culture for the greater part of Europe, the\r\npractice of medicine was to a great extent in the hands of monks and\r\nnuns. For every religious house was then a hospital as well as a school,\r\na place where drugs and ointments were compounded and distributed, as\r\nwell as a place where manuscripts were transcribed and illuminated. At a\r\ntime when there were but few professional physicians and when these few\r\nwere widely separated from one another, the only places where the poor\r\ncould always be sure to find free medical treatment as well as abundant\r\nalms were those sanctuaries of knowledge and charity where the love of\r\none's neighbor was never lost sight of in the love of science and\r\nliterature. And during this time, too, the care of the sick was regarded\r\nas a duty incumbent on everyone, but particularly on those devoted to\r\nthe service of God in religion. It was considered, above all, as a duty\r\ndevolving on women, especially on the lady in the castle and on the nun\r\nin the convent.\r\n\r\nThe old romance of _Sir Isumbras_ gives us a charming picture of the\r\nnuns of long ago receiving the wounded knight and ministering unto him\r\nuntil he was made whole and strong, as witness the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"The nonnes of him they were full fayne,\r\n    For that he had the Saracenes slayne\r\n      And those haythene houndes.\r\n    And of his paynnes sare ganne them rewe.\r\n    Ilke a day they made salves new\r\n      And laid them till his woundes;\r\n    They gave him metis and drynkis lythe,\r\n    And heled the knyghte wunder swythe.\"\r\n\r\nSo universally during mediaeval times was the healing art considered as\r\npertaining to woman's calling that it became a part of the curriculum in\r\nconvent schools; and no girl's education was considered complete unless\r\nshe had an elementary knowledge of medicine and of that part of surgery\r\nwhich deals with the treatment of wounds. For during those troublous\r\ntimes a woman was liable to be called upon at any time to nurse the sick\r\nwayfarer or dress the wounds of those who had been maimed in battle or\r\nin the tourney.\r\n\r\nIllustrations of these facts are found in many of the romances and\r\nfabliaux of the Middle Ages. Thus, when a sick or wounded man was given\r\nhospitality in a chateau or castle it was not the seigneur, but his wife\r\nand daughters, as being better versed in medicine and surgery, who acted\r\nas nurses and doctors and took entire charge of the patient until his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nIn the exquisite little story of _Aucassin et Nicolette_, the heroine is\r\npictured as setting the dislocated shoulder of her lover in the\r\nfollowing simple but touching language:\r\n\r\n\"Nicolette searched his hurt, and perceived that his shoulder was out of\r\njoint. She handled it so deftly with her white hands, and used such\r\nskillful surgery that, by the grace of God, who loveth all true lovers,\r\nthe shoulder came back to its place. Then she plucked flowers and fresh\r\ngrasses and green leafage, and bound them tightly about the setting with\r\nthe hem torn from her shift, and he was altogether healed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the mediaeval Latin poem, _Waltharius_, written by a German monk,\r\nEkkehard, reference is made to a sanguinary contest in which one of the\r\ncombatants falls to the earth seriously wounded. Seeing this,\r\nAlpharides, in a loud voice, summons a young girl, who timidly comes\r\nforward and dresses the unfortunate man's wound.[186]\r\n\r\nStill more to our purpose is a passage from the famous epic poem,\r\n_Tristan and Isolde_, written by _Godfrey of Strasburg_, in which\r\nIsolde, accompanied by her mother and cousin, is represented as\r\nadministering restoratives to Tristan, who had fallen exhausted after\r\nhis combat with the dragon. It shows that women, in accompanying an army\r\nto the field of battle, always went provided with bandages and\r\nmedicaments for dressing wounds and fractured limbs. Similarly Angelica,\r\nin _Orlando Furioso_, and Ermina, in _Jerusalem Delivered_, are\r\nportrayed as surgeons with deftness of hand and leeches with rare\r\nknowledge and skill.\r\n\r\nThe frequent introduction of women doctors into the poems and romances\r\nof the Middle Ages would of itself, if other evidence were wanting,\r\nsuffice to show what an important role women played in medicine and\r\nsurgery at a time when, in many parts of Europe, women were far better\r\neducated and far more cultured than men--\"when the knights and barons of\r\nFrance and Germany were inclined to look upon reading and writing as\r\nunmanly and almost degrading accomplishments, fit only for priests or\r\nmonks, and especially for priests or monks not too well born.\"[187]\r\n\r\nIn the instances just quoted, as well as those mentioned by Homer and\r\nEuripides, the writers do no more than faithfully reflect conditions\r\nwhich then obtained, and truthfully report what were the occupations of\r\nwomen when their status was so different from what it is to-day. But,\r\nfortunately, we do not have to rely on works of the imagination for our\r\nknowledge respecting the women practitioners of the healing art, either\r\nduring the Homeric period or during that which intervened between the\r\ndownfall of Rome and the dawn of the Renaissance. For the history of\r\nmedicine during mediaeval times affords too many examples of women who\r\nbecame famous for their knowledge of medicine, as well as for their\r\nsuccess in surgical and medical practice, to leave any doubt about the\r\nmatter. Besides this, we have still the writings of many of these women,\r\nand are thus able to judge of their competency in those branches of\r\nknowledge on which they shed so great luster.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted of them was the Benedictine abbess, St. Hildegard,\r\nof Bingen on the Rhine, who was eminent not only as a theologian but\r\nalso as a writer whose treatises on various branches of science are\r\njustly regarded as the most important productions of the kind during the\r\nMiddle Ages prior to the time of Albertus Magnus. Besides this, she not\r\nonly wrote many books on _materia medica_, on pathology, physiology and\r\ntherapeutics, but, as a practitioner, she gloriously sustained the best\r\ntraditions of her sex in both theoretical and practical medicine.\r\n\r\nHer work entitled _Liber Simplicis Medicinae_, which deals with what in\r\nthe Saint's time was called \"simples\"--for the belief was then current\r\nthat each plant or herb was or provided a specific for some\r\ndisease--contains accounts of many plants used in _materia medica_, as\r\nwell as statements of their importance in therapeutics. Her descriptions\r\noften indicate an observer of exceptionally keen perception and one\r\nwhose knowledge of science was far in advance of her epoch. The same\r\nobservations may be made respecting Hildegard 's work, _Liber Compositae\r\nMedicinae_, in which she treats of the causes, signs and treatment of\r\ndiseases.[188]\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable, in many respects, is a treatise in nine books,\r\nentitled _Physica_ or _Liber Subtilitatum Diversarum Naturarum\r\nCreaturarum_, which, among other things, treats of the various elements,\r\nof plants, trees, minerals, fish, birds, quadrupeds, and of the manner\r\nin which they may be of service to man. Of so great importance was this\r\nbook considered that several editions of it were printed as early as the\r\nsixteenth century. No less an authority than the late Rudolph Virchow,\r\nthe founder of cellular pathology, characterizes it as an early _materia\r\nmedica_, curiously complete, considering the age to which it\r\nbelongs.[189] And Haeser, in his history of medicine, directs attention\r\nto the historical value of the book, declaring it to be \"an independent\r\nGerman treatise, based chiefly on popular experience.\"\r\n\r\nDr. F. A. Reuss, of the University of Wuertzburg, at the conclusion of\r\nhis _Prolegomena_ to the _Physica_ published in Migne's _Patrologia_,\r\nexpresses himself as follows regarding the writings and medical\r\nknowledge of the illustrious abbess of Bingen: \"Among all the saintly\r\n_religieuses_ who, during the Middle Ages, practiced medicine or wrote\r\ntreatises on it, the first, without contradiction, is Hildegard.\r\nAccording to the monk Theodoric, who was an eye witness, she had to so\r\nhigh a degree the gift of healing that no sick person had recourse to\r\nher without being restored to health. There is among the books of this\r\nprophetic virgin a work which treats of physics and medicine. Its title\r\nis _De Natura Nominis Elementorum Diversarumque Creaturarum_, and it\r\nembodies, as the same Theodoric fully explains, the secrets of nature\r\nwhich were revealed to the saint by the prophetic spirit. All who wish\r\nto write the history of the medical and natural sciences should read\r\nthis book, in which the holy virgin, initiated into all the secrets of\r\nnature which were then known, and having received special assistance\r\nfrom above, thoroughly examines and scrutinizes all that which was,\r\nuntil then, buried in darkness and concealed from the eyes of mortals.\r\nIt is certain that Hildegard was acquainted with many things of which\r\nthe doctors of the Middle Ages were ignorant, and which the\r\ninvestigators of our own age, after rediscovering them, have announced\r\nas something entirely new.\"[190]\r\n\r\nThe life and works of St. Hildegard throw a flood of light on many\r\nsubjects that have long been veiled in mystery. It explains why the\r\nconvents of the later Middle Ages were so famed as curative centers and\r\nwhy the sick flocked to them for relief from far and near. It reveals\r\nthe real agencies employed in effecting the extraordinary cures that\r\nwere reported in so many religious houses--cures so extraordinary that\r\nthey were usually regarded by the multitude as miraculous--and discloses\r\nthe secret of the success of so many nuns in the alleviation of physical\r\nand mental sufferings. It was not because they were thaumaturges, but\r\nbecause they were good nurses, and because of their thorough knowledge\r\nof the healing art, that they were able to diagnose and prescribe for\r\ndiseases of all kinds with a success which, in the estimation of the\r\nmultitude, savored of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nThere was also another reason for the fame of convents as sanctuaries of\r\nhealth. They were usually situated in healthy locations where there was\r\nan abundance of pure water, fresh air and cheerful sunshine. Then there\r\nwere likewise a wholesome diet, good sanitary conditions, and, above\r\nall, regularity of life.\r\n\r\nThe same can be said of the hospitals connected with the convents. They\r\nwere not like some of the public hospitals of the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries in many of the large cities of Europe--repulsive,\r\nprison-like structures, with narrow windows and devoid of light and air\r\nand the most necessary hygienic appliances--institutions that were\r\nhospitals in name, but which were in reality too frequently breeding\r\nplaces of disease and death.[191]\r\n\r\nUnlike these, the hospitals presided over by nuns of the type of\r\nHildegard were splendid roomy structures with large windows and\r\nabundance of light, pure air, with special provisions for the privacy of\r\nthe patients, and with sanitary arrangements that not only precluded the\r\ndissemination of disease but which contributed materially to those\r\nmarvelous cures which the good people of the time attributed to\r\nsupernatural agencies rather than to the medical knowledge and skill of\r\nthe devoted nuns,[192] who were the real conquerors of disease and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut the inmates of the cloister were not the only women who, during the\r\nMiddle Ages, achieved distinction by their writings on medical subjects\r\nand by their signal success in the practice of the healing art. In\r\nvarious parts of Europe, but especially in Italy and France, there were\r\nat this time among women, outside as well as inside convent walls, many\r\ndaughters of Aesculapius and sisters of Hygeia who stood in such high\r\nrepute among their contemporaries that they received the same honors and\r\nemoluments as were accorded to their masculine colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly the case in Salerno, which was the venerated\r\nmother of all Christian medical schools, and which, for nine centuries,\r\nwas universally regarded as \"the unquestioned fountain and archetype of\r\northodox medicine.\" Situated on the Gulf of Salerno, and laved by the\r\ncerulean waters of the Tyrrhenian sea, the _Civitas Hippocratica_, as it\r\nwas called on its medals, rejoiced in a salubrious climate, and was\r\ncelebrated throughout the world as the \"City sacred to Phoebus, the\r\nsedulous nurse of Minerva, the fountain of physic, the votary of\r\nmedicine, the handmaid of Nature, the destroyer of disease and the\r\nstrong adversary of death.\"[193] For to this favored city flocked from\r\nall quarters the lame and the halt and those afflicted with the tortures\r\nof disease and the disabilities of advancing years. The noble and the\r\nsimple, crowned heads as well as the poorest of the poor, were found\r\nthere, all of them in quest of life's most precious boon--health and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nNever did the far-famed sanctuary of the god of medicine in Epidaurus\r\nwitness such an influx of invalids as gathered in the hospitals of\r\nSalerno and pressed through the streets of the Hippocratic city, seeking\r\nthe aid of those doctors whose marvelous cures had given them a\r\nworld-wide reputation. Small wonder, then, that the _Regimen Santatis\r\nSalernitanum_--that famous code of health of the school of Salerno--has\r\nbeen translated into almost all the languages of modern Europe, and that\r\nsince 1480 no fewer than two hundred and fifty editions of it have been\r\npublished. \"Not to have been familiar with it from beginning to end, not\r\nto have been able to quote it orally as occasion might require, would,\r\nduring the Middle Ages, have cast serious suspicion upon the\r\nprofessional culture of any physician.\"[194] But the noblest claims of\r\nthe Hippocratic city to the gratitude of humanity yet remain to be told.\r\nA German traveler in the thirteenth century wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Laudibus aeternum nullum negat esse Salernum\r\n    Illuc pro morbis totus circumfluit orbis.\"[195]\r\n\r\nThis was because Salerno was universally recognized as the \"day star\"\r\nand \"morning glory\" of the best culture in the healing art, and, still\r\nmore, because of the thorough instruction she gave in her schools of\r\nmedicine and the preeminence she so long held in every department of\r\nmedical lore.\r\n\r\nThe course of study in medicine was long and thorough, and the candidate\r\napplying for a degree had to pass a rigid examination and give proof not\r\nonly of his proficiency in every branch of the healing art, but also of\r\nperfect acquaintance with the various branches of science and letters as\r\nwell. At the time of Frederick II, who organized all the different\r\nschools of Salerno into a single university, a three years' course in\r\nphilosophy and literature was required before one could present himself\r\nfor entrance into the school of medicine. The courses in medicine lasted\r\nfive years, at least, after which a year of practice with an old\r\nphysician was required. In addition to this, if the candidate wished to\r\npractice surgery he was obliged to devote one year to the study of human\r\nanatomy and to the dissection of human bodies. Considering the progress\r\nof knowledge since the time of Frederick II, it must be admitted that\r\nthe legal requirements enforced by the faculty of Salerno compare\r\nfavorably with those of the best of our medical schools of to-day.\r\n\r\nStill more to the credit of Salerno, long known as the Athens of the\r\ntwo Sicilies, was her boundless liberality toward scholarship and\r\nculture regardless of sex. For, with a chivalrous admiration for\r\nintellect, wherever found, and with a sense of intellectual justice that\r\nhas put to shame all medical schools outside of Italy, until less than\r\nfifty years ago, the school of Salerno was the first to throw open its\r\nportals to women as well as men, and give to an admiring world a number\r\nof women--those celebrated _mulieres Salernitanae_--who were eminent not\r\nonly as physicians, but also as professors of the theory and practice of\r\nmedicine. For this reason, if for no other, it can be truly affirmed\r\nthat \"No school of medicine in any age or country, if only for this, can\r\never over-peer her in renown; and, even as formerly in the universities\r\nof Europe, at the bare mention of the name of the learned Cujacius,\r\nevery scholar instinctively uncovered himself, so at the very name of\r\nSalernum, the fount and nurse of rational medicine, every physician\r\nshould recall her memory 'with mute thanks and secret ecstasy' as among\r\nthe most spotless and venerated chapters in the history of his\r\nart.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThe most noted professor and successful practitioner among the women of\r\nSalerno was Trotula, wife of the distinguished physician, John\r\nPlatearius, and a member of the old noble family of the Ruggiero. She\r\nflourished during the eleventh century and enjoyed a reputation as a\r\nphysician that was not inferior to that of the most noted doctors of her\r\ntime. Besides occupying a chair in the school of medicine and having an\r\nextensive practice, she was the author of many works on medicine which\r\nhad a great vogue among her contemporaries. Some of them, especially\r\nthose relating to diseases of her own sex,[197] were published several\r\ntimes after the invention of printing, and many manuscript copies of her\r\nworks are still found in various libraries of Europe. But she did not\r\nconfine her practice to the diseases of women. She was also well versed\r\nin general medicine and exhibited, besides, as her works testify, marked\r\nskill as a surgeon in many cases that would even now be considered as\r\npeculiarly difficult of treatment.\r\n\r\nOne of her books was entitled _De Compositione Medicamentorum_--the\r\nCompounding of Medicaments--and it was this work, doubtless, that gave\r\nher much of the fame she enjoyed beyond the confines of Italy.\r\nRuteboeuf, a noted French trouvere of the thirteenth century, gives us\r\na quaint picture of a scene frequently witnessed in his day. Crowds were\r\nfrequently attracted by herbalists--venders of simples--who, stationed\r\nat street corners or in other public places, near tables covered with a\r\ncloth of flaring colors, were wont to descant, somewhat after the style\r\nof certain of our patent-medicine hawkers and quack-salvers, upon the\r\nextraordinary curative properties of the various drugs and panaceas\r\nwhich they had for sale.\r\n\r\n\"Good people,\" one of these traveling herb doctors would begin, \"I am\r\nnot one of those poor preachers, nor one of those poor herbalists who\r\ncarry boxes and sachets and spread them out on a carpet. No, I am a\r\ndisciple of a great lady named Madame Trotte of Salerno, who performs\r\nsuch marvels of every kind. And know ye that she is the wisest woman in\r\nthe four quarters of the world.\"\r\n\r\nOrdericus Vitalis, an English Benedictine monk, in his _Historia\r\nEcclesiastica_, tells us of the impression made by Trotula on Rudolfo\r\nMalacorona, one of those famous itinerant scholars of the Middle Ages,\r\nwho spent their lives in wandering from one university to another in\r\npursuit of knowledge. He had been a student from his youth and was a man\r\nof remarkable attainments in every department of learning. After\r\nvisiting and conferring with the learned men of the most celebrated\r\nuniversities of France and Italy, he finally arrived at Salerno, where,\r\nhe informs us, he found no one who could cope with him in disputation\r\nexcept _quandam sapientem matronam_--a certain very learned woman.[198]\r\nThis was Trotula, who, by reason of the extraordinary cures she\r\neffected, was known among her contemporaries as _magistra operis_--a\r\nconsummate practitioner. When, however, we consider the thorough course\r\nof study that every one aspiring to a degree in medicine was obliged to\r\ncomplete, women as well as men, it is not so surprising that Trotula\r\nshould be regarded both as a learned woman and as a successful\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nAmong other women doctors who did honor to Salerno and whose names have\r\ncome down to us were three who are known in history as Abella, Rebeca de\r\nGuarna and Mercuriade. All of them achieved a great reputation by their\r\nwritings on medical subjects, especially Mercuriade, who distinguished\r\nherself in surgery as well as in medicine. Still another woman deserving\r\nspecial mention is Francesca, wife of Matteo de Romana, of Salerno.\r\nAfter passing a very severe examination before a board composed of\r\nphysicians and surgeons, she was accorded the doctorate in surgery. An\r\nofficial document of the time referring to this event reads as follows:\r\n\"Whereas the laws permit women to practice medicine, and whereas, from\r\nthe viewpoint of good morals, women are best adapted to the treatment of\r\ntheir own sex, we, after having received the oath of fidelity, permit\r\nthe said Francesca to practice the said art of healing,\" etc.[199]\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts above mentioned regarding the University of\r\nSalerno--the excellence of its work, its liberality and breadth of view,\r\nits attitude toward the higher education of women, and its preeminence\r\nfor so many centuries as a school of medicine--is it surprising that it\r\nwas, until comparatively recent times, considered \"the _mater et caput_\r\nof medical authority in ethical matters,\" and that, so late as 1748, the\r\nMedical Faculty of Paris should address an official letter to the\r\nfaculty of Salerno requesting its judgment regarding the rights of\r\nprecedence as between physicians and surgeons? But what is surprising,\r\nand what, too, passes all understanding, is that the University of\r\nLondon, after being empowered by royal charter to do all things that\r\ncould be done by any university, was legally advised that it could not\r\ngrant degrees to women without a fresh charter, because no university\r\nhad ever granted such degrees.[200]\r\n\r\nWhile women were winning such laurels in Salerno in every department of\r\nthe healing art, their sisters north of the Alps were not idle. As early\r\nas 1292 there were in Paris no less than eight women doctors--called\r\n_miresses_ or _mediciennes_--whose names have come down to us, not to\r\nspeak of those who practiced in other parts of France. There was also a\r\ncertain number of women who devoted themselves to surgery and called by\r\nthe old Latin authors of the time _cyrurgiae_.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, however, conditions for studying and practicing medicine and\r\nsurgery were far from being as favorable to women as they were in\r\nSalerno. As there were no schools open to them for the study of these\r\nbranches, they had to depend entirely for such knowledge as they were\r\nable to acquire on the aid they could get from practicing doctors, the\r\nreading of medical books and their own experience. The consequence was\r\nthat they were not at all so well equipped for their work as were the\r\nwomen who enjoyed all the exceptional advantages offered the students at\r\nSalerno. None of them was noted for scholarship, none of them was a\r\nwriter of books, and only one of them--Jacobe Felicie, about whom more\r\npresently--rose above mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the great difference between the conditions of the women\r\ndoctors of Paris and those of Salerno is not far to seek. The Faculty of\r\nMedicine in Paris was, from the beginning of its existence, unalterably\r\nopposed to female medical practitioners. As early as 1220 it promulgated\r\nan edict prohibiting the practice of medicine by any one who did not\r\nbelong to the faculty, and, according to its constitutions and by-laws,\r\nonly unmarried men were eligible to membership.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the edict remained a dead letter. But eventually, as the\r\nfaculty grew in power and influence, it was able to enforce the\r\nobservance of its decrees. One of its first victims was Jacobe Felicie,\r\njust mentioned, who was hailed before court for practicing medicine in\r\ncontravention of its edict issued many years before.\r\n\r\nJacobe Felicie was a woman of noble birth, and had won distinction by\r\nher success in the healing art. As the testimony at her trial revealed,\r\nshe never treated the sick for the sake of gain. In nearly all cases the\r\nsick who had addressed themselves to her had been abandoned by their own\r\nphysicians. All the witnesses who had been called testified that they\r\nhad been cured by Jacobe Felicie, and all expressed their deepest\r\ngratitude to her for her care and devotion. But, in spite of all these\r\nfacts, and in spite of the brilliant defence that this worthy woman\r\nmade, she was condemned to pay a heavy fine--condemned because, as the\r\nindictment read, she had presumed to put her sickle into the harvest of\r\nothers-_falcem in messem mittere alienam_--and this was a crime.[201]\r\nThe faculty was a close corporation and insisted that its members should\r\nhave a monopoly of all the honors and emoluments that were to accrue\r\nfrom the treatment of the sick and suffering. What a curious\r\nadumbration of similar proceedings within the memory of many still\r\nliving!\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of Jacobe Felicie recalls that of Agnodice in Greece\r\nlong ages before. And the plea urged for the necessity of a female\r\nphysician--that many a woman would rather die than reveal the secrets of\r\nher infirmity to a man[202]--was the same as that offered by the women\r\nof Athens before the council of the Areopagus. It was the same agonizing\r\ncry that had been heard thousands of times before and which has been\r\nheard thousands of times since. Isabella of Castile was not the first of\r\nthe long list of victims who, for lack of a doctor of their own sex,\r\nhave been sacrificed through womanly modesty, and, more's the pity, she\r\nwill not be the last.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the women of France, the result of the prosecution of\r\nMme. Felicie was the very reverse of that instituted against Agnodice;\r\nfor the latter came off victorious, while the former was condemned and\r\npunished. So crushing was the blow dealt to women practitioners, outside\r\nof obstetrics, that they did not recover from its effects for more than\r\nfive hundred years. For it was not until 1868 that the Ecole de Medicine\r\nof Paris opened its doors to women, and it was not until nearly twenty\r\nyears later that female physicians were able to enter the hospitals of\r\nthe French capital as _internes_.[203]\r\n\r\nUntil quite recent years there is very little to be said of women\r\nphysicians in England and Germany. Their practice, outside of that of\r\ncertain herb doctors, was confined chiefly to midwifery. There was no\r\nprovision made in either of these countries for the education of women\r\nin medicine and surgery, and such a thing as a college where they could\r\nreceive instruction in the healing art was unknown. It is true that an\r\necclesiastical law of Edgar, King of England, permitted women as well as\r\nmen to practice medicine, but this law was subsequently abolished by\r\nHenry V.[204]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII a law was again enacted in favor of women\r\nphysicians; for at that time an act was passed for the relief and\r\nprotection of \"Divers honest psones, as well men as women, whom God\r\nhathe endued with the knowledge of the nature, kind and operacon of\r\ncerteyne herbes, rotes and waters, and the using and ministering them to\r\nsuche as be payned with customable diseases, for neighbourhode and\r\nGoddes sake and of pitie and charitie, because _that_ 'The Companie and\r\nFellowship of Surgeons of London, _mynding only their owne lucres and\r\nnothing the profit or case of the diseased or patient_, have sued, vexed\r\nand troubled' the aforesaid 'honest psones,' who were henceforth to be\r\nallowed 'to practyse, use and mynistre in and to any outwarde sore,\r\nswelling or disease, any herbes, oyntments, bathes, pultes\r\nor emplasters, according to their cooning, experience and\r\nknowledge--without sute, vexation, penaltie or loss of their\r\ngoods.'\"[205]\r\n\r\nThe italicized words in this quotation prove that the women doctors of\r\nEngland had the same difficulties as their sisters in France, and that\r\nthe real reason of the opposition of the male practitioners was that\r\nthey wished to monopolize the practice of medicine. They, like the\r\nmedical faculty of Paris, strenuously objected to women \"putting the\r\nsickle into their harvest,\" and they, accordingly, left nothing undone\r\nto circumvent the intrusion of those whom they always regarded as\r\nundesirable competitors.\r\n\r\nIt was argued by the men that women, to begin with, lacked the strength\r\nand capacity necessary for medical practice. It was also urged that it\r\nwas indelicate and unwomanly for the gentler sex to engage in the\r\nhealing art, and that, for their own good, they should be excluded from\r\nit at all costs. Those who were willing to waive these objections\r\ncontended that women had not the knowledge necessary for the profession\r\nof medicine and should be excluded on the score of ignorance. When women\r\nsought to qualify themselves for medical practice by seeking instruction\r\nunder licenced practitioners or in medical schools, they found a deaf\r\near turned to their requests. The doctors declined to teach them and the\r\nmedical schools, one and all, closed their doors against them.\r\n\r\nThus it was that in England, France and Germany the practice of medicine\r\nand surgery was always practically in the hands of men until only a\r\ngeneration ago. Even the English midwives gradually \"fell from their\r\nhigh estate,\" and were left far behind the female obstetricians of\r\nGermany and France. For these two countries can point to a number of\r\nmidwives who, by their knowledge, successful practice, and the books\r\nthey wrote, achieved a celebrity that still endures.\r\n\r\nChief among these in Germany were Regina Joseph von Siebold, her\r\ndaughter Carlotta, and Frau Teresa Frei, all of whom, in the early part\r\nof the last century, enjoyed an enviable reputation in the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe first named, after following a course of lectures on physiology and\r\nthe diseases of women and children, and passing a brilliant examination\r\nin the medical college of Darmstadt, devoted herself to the practice of\r\nobstetrics, and with so great success that the University of Giessen in\r\n1819 conferred on her the degree of doctor of obstetrics. Her daughter,\r\nCarlotta, after studying obstetrics under her mother, went to the\r\nUniversity of Goettingen, where she devoted herself to physiology,\r\nanatomy and pathology. After passing an examination and successfully\r\ndefending a number of theses in the University of Giessen, she was also\r\nproclaimed a doctor of obstetrics. At a later date Frau Frei received a\r\nsimilar degree.[206]\r\n\r\nMore noted as _accoucheuses_ and gynecologists than the three\r\ndistinguished women just mentioned were Mme. Marie Louise La Chapelle\r\nand Mme. Marie Bovin, who, shortly after the French Revolution, entered\r\nupon those wonderful careers in their chosen specialties which have\r\ngiven them so unique a place in the annals of medicine.\r\n\r\nMme. La Chapelle was particularly celebrated for the numerous\r\nimprovements she effected in lying-in hospitals, for the large number of\r\nskilled midwives whom she furnished, not only to France, but also to the\r\nwhole of Europe, and, above all, for the excellent treatises which she\r\nwrote on obstetrics, which gave her a reputation second to none among\r\nher contemporaries, men or women. Her _Pratique des Accouchements_, in\r\nthree volumes, based on the immense number of fifty thousand cases at\r\nwhich she presided, reveals an operator of rarest skill and genius. This\r\nproduction was long regarded as a standard work on the topics discussed,\r\nand for years exerted an immense influence in the medical world.\r\n\r\nLess skillful as an operator, but of greater ability as a doctor than\r\nMme. La Chapelle, was her illustrious contemporary, Mme. Bovin.\r\nPossessing extraordinary insight as an investigator and marvelous\r\nsagacity as a diagnostician, Mme. Bovin achieved the distinction of\r\nbeing the first really great woman doctor of modern times. Her marvelous\r\nsuccess as a practitioner--Dupuytren said she had an eye at the tip of\r\nher finger--her extended knowledge of the entire range of gynecology,\r\nbut above all her numerous treatises on the subject matter of her life\r\nwork, gave her a prestige that none of her sex had ever before enjoyed,\r\nand commanded the admiration of the doctors of the world. Her _Memorial\r\nde l'Art des Accouchements_ passed through many editions and was\r\ntranslated into several European languages. And so highly were her\r\nscientific attainments valued in Germany that the University of Marburg\r\nrecognized them by conferring on her--_honoris causa_--the degree of\r\ndoctor of medicine and, had its rules permitted the admission of women,\r\nthe Royal Academy of Medicine would have honored her with a place among\r\nits members. She was also the recipient of many other honors, besides\r\nbeing a member of several learned societies. But the greatest monument\r\nto her genius is a large illustrated treatise in two volumes, in which\r\nshe exhibits a wonderful knowledge of anatomy, physiology, surgery,\r\npathology and therapeutics. It gave her a large following in Germany as\r\nwell as in France, and there were not wanting distinguished German\r\n_accoucheurs_ who followed Mme. Bovin's teachings to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable German and French women just named were all practically\r\nself-made women. They won fame as they had acquired knowledge--chiefly\r\nby courage, in spite of the countless obstacles that beset their paths.\r\nThey owed nothing to schools or universities, nothing to government\r\npatronage or assistance, nothing to the medical fraternity as a whole.\r\nUniversities would not admit them to their lecture rooms or\r\nlaboratories, and the various medical faculties opposed them as\r\nintruders into their jealously guarded domain, and as competitors whose\r\naspirations were to be frustrated, whatever the means employed. It is\r\ntrue that, when some of the women mentioned had won world-wide renown by\r\ntheir achievements, they were made the recipients of belated honors by\r\ncertain universities and learned societies; but these societies and\r\nuniversities were then honoring themselves as much as the women who\r\nreceived their degrees and diplomas of membership.\r\n\r\nHow different it was in Italy, which, since the fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire, has ever been in the van of civilization, and which has always\r\ncontinued the best traditions of Graeco-Roman learning and\r\nculture--Italy, which has been the home of such supreme masters of\r\nliterature, science, art as Dante, Petrarch, Galileo, Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nRaphael, Michaelangelo, Brunelleschi--Italy, the mother of universities,\r\nthe birthplace of the Renaissance, and the recognized leader of\r\nintellectual progress among the nations of the world. Here in the\r\nfavored land of the Muses and the Graces, women enjoyed all the rights\r\nand privileges accorded to men; here the doors of schools and\r\nuniversities were open to all regardless of sex; and art, science,\r\nliterature, law, medicine, jurisprudence counted its votaries among\r\nwomen as well as among men; here, far from encountering jealousy and\r\nopposition in the pursuit of knowledge or in the practice of the\r\nprofessions, women never found aught but generous emulation and\r\nsympathetic cooperation.\r\n\r\nFor a thousand years women were welcomed into the arena of learning and\r\nculture on the same footing as men. In Salerno, Bologna, Padua, Pavia,\r\nthey competed for the same honors and were contestants for the same\r\nprizes that stimulated the exertions of the sterner sex. Position and\r\nemolument were the guerdons of merit and ability, and the victor,\r\nwhether man or woman, was equally acclaimed and showered with equal\r\nhonor. Women asked for no favors in the intellectual arena and expected\r\nnone. All they desired were the same opportunities and the same\r\nprivileges as were granted the men, and these were never denied them.\r\nFrom the time when Trotula taught in Salerno to the present, when\r\nGiuseppina Catani is professor of general pathology in the medical\r\nfaculty of Bologna, the women of Italy always had access to the\r\nuniversities and were at liberty to follow any course of study they\r\nmight elect. We thus find them achieving distinction in civil and canon\r\nlaw, in medicine, in theology even, as well as in art, science,\r\nliterature, philosophy and linguistics. No department of knowledge had\r\nany terrors for them, and there was none in which some of them did not\r\nwin undying fame. They held chairs of language, jurisprudence,\r\nphilosophy, physics, mathematics, medicine and anatomy, and filled these\r\npositions with such marked ability that they commanded the admiration\r\nand applause of all who heard them.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to tell of the triumphs of the women professors in\r\nthe Italian universities, or to recount the achievements of those who\r\nwere honored with degrees within their classic walls. Let it suffice to\r\nrecall the names of a few of those who won renown in medicine and\r\nsurgery and whose names are still in their own land pronounced with\r\nrespect and veneration.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted practitioners in Southern Italy, after the death\r\nof Trotula and her compeers, was one Margarita, who had studied medicine\r\nin Salerno. One of her patients was no less a personage than Ladislaus,\r\nKing of Naples. Among those that had diplomas for the practice of\r\nsurgery were Maria Incarnata, of Naples, and Thomasia de Matteo, of\r\nCastro Isiae.\r\n\r\nThat women enjoyed in Rome the same privileges in the practice of\r\nmedicine and surgery as their sisters in the southern part of the\r\npeninsula is manifest from an edict issued by Pope Sixtus IV in\r\nconfirmation of a law promulgated by the Medical Faculty of Rome, which\r\nreads as follows: \"No man or woman, whether Christian or Jew, unless he\r\nbe a master or a licentiate in medicine, shall presume to treat the\r\nhuman body either as a physician or as a surgeon.\"[207]\r\n\r\nIn central and northern Italy--in Florence, Turin, Padua, Venice--as\r\nwell as in the southern part, we find constantly recurring instances of\r\nwomen practicing medicine and surgery and winning for themselves an\r\nenviable reputation as successful practitioners.\r\n\r\nBut after the decline of Salerno, consequent on the establishment by\r\nFrederick II of a school of medicine in Naples, the great center of\r\nmedicine and surgery, as of civil and canon law, was Bologna.[208] So\r\nrenowned did it become as a teaching and intellectual center that it\r\nwas, as Sarti informs us, known throughout Europe as _Civitas\r\nDocta_--the learned city--and _Mater Studiorum_--the mother of studies.\r\nOn its coins were stamped the words _Bononia Docet_--Bologna\r\nteaches--and on the city seal, which is still used for certain public\r\ndocuments, were the words _Legum Bononia Mater_--Bologna, the Mother of\r\nLaws.\r\n\r\nHere, more than in Salerno, more than in any other city in the world,\r\nwas, for long centuries, witnessed a blooming of female genius that has,\r\nsince the time of Gratian and Irnerius, given the University of Bologna\r\npreeminence in the estimation of all friends of woman's education and\r\nwoman's culture. For here, within the walls of what was for centuries\r\nthe most celebrated university in Christendom, women had, for the first\r\ntime, an opportunity of devoting themselves at will to the study of any\r\nand all branches of knowledge. And it can be truthfully affirmed that no\r\nseat of learning can point to such a long list of eminent scholars and\r\nteachers among the gentler sex as is to be found on the register of\r\nBologna's famous university. For here, to name only a few, achieved\r\ndistinction, either as students or as professors, such noted women as\r\nBitisia Gozzadina, Bettina and Novella Calendrini, Dorotea Bocchi,\r\nGiovanna and Maddalena Bianchetti, Virginia Malvezzi, Maria Vittoria\r\nDosi, Elisabetta Sirani, Ippolita Grassi, Properzia de Rossi, Maria\r\nMastellagri, Laura Bassi, Maddelena Noe-Candedi, Clotilda Tambroni and\r\nAnna Manzolini. In this honor list we have a group of savantes that\r\nwere famed throughout Europe for their attainments in law, philosophy,\r\nscience, ancient and modern languages, medicine, and surgery--the\r\nrivals, and sometimes the superiors, in scholarship of the ablest men\r\namong their distinguished colleagues.\r\n\r\nIt would be a pleasure to recount the achievements of these justly\r\ncelebrated daughters of Italy; but lack of space precludes the mention\r\nof more than one of them. This was Maria dalle Donne, who was born of\r\npoor peasants near Bologna, and who at an early age exhibited\r\nintelligence of a superior order. After pursuing her studies under the\r\nablest masters, she obtained from the University of Bologna, _maxima cum\r\nlaude_, the degree of doctor in philosophy and medicine. On account of\r\nher knowledge of surgery, as well as of medicine, she was soon afterward\r\nput in charge of the city's school for midwives. When Napoleon, in 1802,\r\npassed through Bologna he was so struck by the exceptional ability of\r\nthe young _dottoressa_ that, on the recommendation of the savant\r\nCaterzani, he had instituted for her in the university a chair of\r\nobstetrics--a position which she held until the time of her death, in\r\n1842, with the greatest credit to herself and to the institution with\r\nwhich she was identified.\r\n\r\nMaria dalle Donne is a worthy link between that long line of women\r\ndoctors, beginning with Trotula, who have so honored their sex in Italy,\r\nand those still more numerous practitioners in the healing art who,\r\nshortly after her death, began to spring up in all parts of the\r\ncivilized world.[209]\r\n\r\nFor it was about this time that the movement which had long been\r\nagitated in behalf of the higher education of women began suddenly to\r\nassume extraordinary vitality, not only throughout Europe but in America\r\nas well. And to no women did this movement appeal so strongly as to\r\nthose who had long been looking forward to an opportunity to qualify\r\nthemselves for the learned professions, especially medicine. No sooner\r\ndid they descry the first flush of dawn on their long-deferred hopes\r\nthan they began to consider ways and means for putting their fondly\r\nnurtured projects into execution.\r\n\r\nSeven years, almost to the day, after the death of Maria dalle Donne,\r\nMiss Elizabeth Blackwell, a young woman in America, of English birth,\r\ndecided to enter college with a view of studying medicine and surgery.\r\nBut, at the very outset, she encountered all kinds of unforeseen\r\ndifficulties--difficulties that would have caused a less courageous and\r\ndetermined woman to give up her plans in despair. She was told, in the\r\nfirst place, that it was highly improper for a woman to study medicine\r\nand that no decent woman would think of becoming a medical practitioner.\r\nAs to a lady studying or practicing surgery that, of course, was out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nBut a more serious obstacle than the conventionalities in the case was\r\nthe difficulty of finding a medical college that was willing to admit a\r\nwoman to its lecture rooms and laboratories. Miss Blackwell applied to\r\nmore than a dozen of the leading institutions of America, and received\r\na positive refusal to her request. Finally, when hope had almost\r\nvanished, she received word from a small college in Geneva, New York,\r\nannouncing that her application had been favorably considered and that\r\nshe would be admitted as a student whenever she presented herself.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the faculty of the college was opposed to the young\r\nwoman's admission, but wished to escape the odium incident to a direct\r\nrefusal by referring the question to the class with a proviso which, it\r\nwas believed, would necessarily exclude her. \"But in this it was greatly\r\nsurprised and disappointed. For the entire medical class, to the number\r\nof about one hundred and fifty, decided unanimously in favor of the fair\r\napplicant's admission. And they did more than this. They put themselves\r\non record regarding the equality of educational opportunities for women\r\nand men in a way that must have put their timid professors to shame.\r\nTheir resolution, accompanying an invitation to the young woman to\r\nbecome a member of the student body, was worded as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, That one of the radical principles of a republican\r\ngovernment is the universal education of both sexes; that to every\r\nbranch of scientific education the door should be equally open to all;\r\nthat the application of Elizabeth Blackwell to become a member of our\r\nclass meets our entire approbation, and, in extending our unanimous\r\ninvitation, we pledge ourselves that no conduct of ours shall cause her\r\nto regret her attendance at this institution.'\"\r\n\r\nThe students were as good as their word. Their conduct, as Miss\r\nBlackwell wrote years afterward, was always admirable and that of \"true\r\nChristian gentlemen.\" But the women of Geneva were shocked at the female\r\nmedical student. They stared at her as a curious animal; and the theory\r\nwas fully established that she was \"either a bad woman, whose designs\r\nwould gradually become evident, or that, being insane, an outbreak of\r\ninsanity would soon be apparent.\"[210]\r\n\r\nIn due time Miss Blackwell finished her course in medicine and surgery,\r\nand graduated at the head of her class. The orator of the day, who was a\r\nmember of the faculty, naturally referred to the new departure that had\r\nbeen made--the admission of a woman for the first time to a complete\r\nmedical education--and among other things declared that the experiment,\r\nof which every member of the faculty was proud, \"had proved that the\r\nstrongest intellect and nerve and the most untiring perseverance were\r\ncompatible with the softest attributes of feminine delicacy and\r\ngrace.\"[211]\r\n\r\nThe awarding of the degree of M.D. for the first time to a woman in\r\nAmerica excited general comment and widespread interest, not only in the\r\nUnited States, but in Europe as well. The public press was not\r\nunfavorable in its opinion of the new departure, and even _Punch_ could\r\nnot resist writing some verses, sympathetic, albeit humorous, in honor\r\nof the fair M.D.[212]\r\n\r\nAfter spending some time abroad studying in the great hospitals of\r\nEurope, Miss Blackwell started the practice of medicine in New York\r\nCity. At first, as she declares in her autobiographical sketches, it was\r\n\"very difficult, though steady, uphill work. I had,\" she tells us, \"no\r\nmedical companionship, the profession stood aloof, and society was\r\ndistrustful of the innovation.\"\r\n\r\nThe aloofness of the profession arose from a dread of successful\r\nrivalry, and the men did not wish to encourage \"the invasion by women of\r\ntheir own preserves.\" \"You cannot expect us,\" one of them frankly\r\nadmitted to her, \"to furnish you with a stick to break our heads with.\"\r\n\r\nBut, undeterred by opposition, Miss Blackwell continued her work, daily\r\nmaking converts to the new movement and receiving substantial aid, as\r\nwell as sympathetic cooperation, from many people, both men and women,\r\nprominent in society and public life. In 1854 she started a free\r\ndispensary for poor women. Three years later she founded a hospital for\r\nwomen and children, where young women physicians as well as patients\r\ncould be received. These were the humble beginnings of the present\r\nflourishing institutions known as the New York Infirmary and the College\r\nfor Women. And in less than ten years after her graduation, Miss\r\nBlackwell saw the new departure in medical practice successfully\r\nestablished, not only in New York, but also in other large cities of the\r\nUnited States. In 1869 the early pioneer medical work by women in\r\nAmerica was completed.\r\n\r\n\"During the twenty years which followed the graduation of the first\r\nwoman physician, the public recognition of the justice and advantage of\r\nsuch a measure had steadily grown. Throughout the northern states the\r\nfree and equal entrance of women into the profession of medicine was\r\nsecured. In Boston, New York and Philadelphia special medical schools\r\nfor women were sanctioned by the legislatures, and in some\r\nlong-established colleges women were received as students in the\r\nordinary classes.\"[213]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the women in Europe were not idle nor heedless of the example\r\nset by their brave sisters in America. The University of Zurich threw\r\nopen its portals to women, and was soon followed by those of Bern and\r\nGeneva. The first woman to obtain a degree in medicine in Zurich--it was\r\nin 1867--was Nadejda Suslowa, a Russian. She was soon followed by scores\r\nof others from Europe and America, who found greater advantages and more\r\nsympathy in Swiss universities than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Medico-Chirurgical Academy of St. Petersburg conferred the\r\ndegree of M.D. upon Madame Kaschewarow, the first female candidate for\r\nthis honor. When her name was mentioned by the dean it was received with\r\nan immense storm of applause which lasted several minutes. The ceremony\r\nof investing her with the insignia of her dignity being over, her fellow\r\nstudents and colleagues lifted her on a chair and carried her with\r\ntriumphant shouts throughout the halls.\r\n\r\nThe first woman graduate from the University of France was Miss\r\nElizabeth Garrett, of England. She received her degree in medicine in\r\n1870, and the following year the same institution conferred the doctor's\r\ndegree on Miss Mary C. Putnam, of New York.\r\n\r\nAfter these precedents had been established, the universities of the\r\nvarious countries on the continent, following the examples set by those\r\nin the United States and Switzerland, opened one after the other their\r\ndoors to women, and in most of them accorded them all the privileges of\r\n_cives academici_ enjoyed by the men.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain held out against the new movement long after most of the\r\ncontinental countries had fallen into line, nor did she surrender until\r\nafter a protracted and bitter fight, during which the men leading the\r\nopposition exhibited evidences of selfishness and obscurantism that now\r\nseem incredible.\r\n\r\nThe leader in Great Britain of pioneer medical work for women was Miss\r\nSophia Jex-Blake, whose academic pathway was beset with difficulties far\r\nsterner than had in the United States confronted her friend and\r\ncolleague, Miss Blackwell.\r\n\r\nHearing much of the tolerance and liberality of the University of\r\nLondon, she applied to it for admission as a student, but was informed\r\nat once that the charter of the institution \"had purposely been so\r\nworded as to exclude the possibility of examining women for medical\r\ndegrees.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this rebuff she made application to the University of Edinburgh,\r\nwhich, like the other Scotch universities, had always boasted of its\r\nbroad-mindedness and freedom from educational trammels. She was received\r\nprovisionally, and was, after a while, joined by six other women who had\r\nin view the same object as herself. For a time, notwithstanding\r\nopposition from certain quarters, everything was quiet and apparently\r\nsatisfactory. But the gathering storm soon broke, and the seven young\r\nwomen, as they were one day entering the university gates, were actually\r\nmobbed by a ruffianly band of students who had all along been opposed to\r\nthe presence of women in the class and lecture rooms. They pelted the\r\nhelpless females with street mud and hurled at them all the vile\r\nepithets and heaped upon them all the abuse that their foul tongues\r\ncould command. These outrageous proceedings on the part of the rabble of\r\nrowdies were allowed to continue for several days, and, had it not been\r\nfor a brave band of chivalrous young Irishmen among the students, who\r\nformed themselves into a bodyguard for the protection of their fair\r\nclassmates, and were, in consequence, known as \"The Irish Brigade,\" the\r\nhapless women students would not have escaped bodily harm. What a marked\r\ncontrast between the conduct toward Miss Blackwell of the gallant\r\nstudents of the modest little American town and that of the cowardly\r\nruffians of the vaunted \"Athens of the North!\"\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. The seven young women in question had matriculated\r\nas students of the university with the understanding that they were to\r\nhave all the rights and privileges of the male students. But after the\r\ndisgraceful conduct of the mob just referred to, they discovered that\r\nthe authorities of the university were prepared to break faith with\r\nthem, and prevent them from getting their coveted degrees, and thus\r\ndebar them from all chance of medical practice.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the university was induced to annul its contract, after\r\nthe women on their part had fully complied with all its stipulations,\r\nsoon became apparent. It was purely and simply to make it impossible for\r\nwomen to secure a license as medical practitioners. Both in and outside\r\nof Edinburgh the conviction daily grew stronger that women doctors were\r\na menace to the monopoly so long enjoyed by the medical fraternity, and\r\nthat the movement in their favor should be crushed by fair means or foul\r\nbefore it got beyond control. The _Spectator_ made this clear by stating\r\nat the time of the controversy that \"every profession in this\r\ncountry\"--England--\"is more or less of a trades union,\" and yet the\r\nmembers of these professions \"would shake their heads and prate about\r\nthe necessity of stamping out trades unionism among workmen.\" \"Women,\"\r\nwhined one of the doctors, \"would snatch the bread from the mouths of\r\npoor practitioners.\" Another doctor who had championed the cause of\r\nwomen physicians, when commenting on the hypocritical objection that it\r\nwas unbecoming for women to practice medicine or surgery, expressed the\r\nsame idea in other words. \"It appears,\" he declared, \"that it is most\r\nbecoming and proper for a woman to discharge all the duties which are\r\nincidental to our profession for thirty shillings a week; but, if she is\r\nto have three or four guineas a day for discharging the same duties,\r\nthen they are immoral and immodest and unsuited to the soft nature that\r\nshould characterize a lady.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Jex-Blake and her companions learned that the university was\r\ndetermined to refuse them the degrees to which they were entitled, they\r\nbrought suit against it for breach of contract. But, after a long and\r\nexpensive trial, the judge rendered a decision against them. They then\r\nappealed to Parliament, and, after a protracted and strenuous campaign\r\non the part of friends whom they had enlisted in their cause, they saw\r\ntheir opponents not only dragged at the chariot wheels of progress but\r\nforced to help to turn them; for, in 1878, after nearly ten years of a\r\npersistent, continuous struggle such as had rarely been witnessed in\r\nwoman's long battle for things of the mind--a struggle in which the\r\nintrepid, dauntless Miss Jex-Blake \"made the greatest of all the\r\ncontributions to the end attained\"--the women of Great Britain had the\r\nsupreme satisfaction of winning what was probably the most glorious\r\nvictory which their sex had ever won.[214] The war was over and\r\nhenceforward they were free--as were their sisters in other parts of the\r\nworld--as the women in Italy had been for a thousand years--to devote\r\nthemselves at will to the study and practice of the healing art without\r\nlet or hindrance.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful change has taken place in the medical world almost\r\nwithin the space of a single generation! The tiny grain of mustard that\r\nwas sown by two lone women, the Misses Blackwell and Jex-Blake, in their\r\nchosen field of effort has grown and \"waxed a great tree.\" Women\r\ndoctors are now found in all parts of the civilized world and are\r\nnumbered by thousands. And so great has been their professional success,\r\nso widespread is the desire to secure their services, especially in\r\ncountries like America and England, where opposition was in the\r\nbeginning especially bitter, that the proportion of women practitioners\r\nin medicine and surgery is now regarded as the best index of a nation's\r\nenlightenment.\r\n\r\nThe healing art of Greece and Rome has broadened out into the noble\r\nsciences of medicine and surgery of to-day. For, based as they now are\r\non the sciences of chemistry, botany, biology, hygiene, physiology,\r\nanatomy and bacteriology, which have all witnessed such extraordinary\r\ndevelopments during the last half century, they both deserve a\r\npreeminent place in the history of the sciences. And the success which\r\nhas crowned woman's efforts in surgery and medicine is not only a\r\nconclusive indication of her capacity, so long denied by her\r\nself-interested opponents, but also the most convincing indication that\r\nshe is at last properly occupied in a field of activity from which she\r\nwas too long excluded. Her contributions as writer and investigator\r\ntoward the progress of both sciences, even during the short time in\r\nwhich she has been able to give proof of her ability, have been notable\r\nand augur well for the share she will have in their future advancement.\r\nBut more important still is the refining influence she has already\r\nexerted on both professions, and the relief she has been able to afford\r\nto countless thousands of her own sex who would otherwise have been the\r\nvoluntary victims of untold misery. Women doctors are, indeed, not only\r\nworthy representatives of Aesculapia Victrix and of the two sciences\r\nwhich they have so elevated and so ennobled, but are also ministering\r\nangels to poor, suffering humanity comparable only with the heroic\r\nSisters of Charity and the devoted nurses of the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[182] Quoted in _Medical Women_, p. 11, by Sophia Jex-Blake, M.

This was due not only to shockingly\r\nunsanitary conditions, but also to inordinate overcrowding. A large\r\nproportion of the beds, incredible as it may seem, were purposely made\r\nfor four patients, and six were frequently crowded into them. \"The\r\nextraordinary spectacle was then to be seen of two or three small-pox\r\ncases, or several surgical cases, lying on one bed.\" John Howard, in his\r\n_Prisons and Hospitals_, pp. 176-177.

Dom Gasquet in his _English Monastic Life_, p.\r\n175, tells us that in the Wiltshire convents \"the young maids learned\r\nneedlework, the art of confectionery, surgery--for anciently there were\r\nno apothecaries or surgeons; the gentlewomen did cure their poor\r\nneighbors--physic, drawing, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[206] The first woman to receive the doctorate of medicine in Germany\r\nwas Frau Dorothea Christin Erxleben. Hers, however, was a wholly\r\nexceptional case, and required the intervention of no less a personage\r\nthan Frederick the Great. In 1754, Frau Erxleben, who had made a\r\nthorough course of humanities under her father, presented herself before\r\nthe faculty of the University of Halle, where she passed an oral\r\nexamination in Latin which lasted two hours. So impressed were the\r\nexaminers by her knowledge and eloquence that they did not hesitate to\r\nadjudge her worthy of the coveted degree, which was accorded her by\r\nvirtue of a royal edict.\r\n\r\nHer reception of the doctorate was made the occasion of a most\r\nenthusiastic demonstration in her honor. Felicitations poured in upon\r\nher from all quarters in both prose and verse. One of them, in lapidary\r\nstyle, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Stupete nova litteraria,\r\n    In Italia nonnumquam,\r\n    In Germania nunquam\r\n    Visa vel audita\r\n    At quo rarius eo carius.\"\r\n\r\nThis, freely translated, adverts to the fact that an event, which before\r\nhad been witnessed only in Italy, was then being celebrated in Germany\r\nfor the first time, and was, for that very reason, specially deserving\r\nof commemoration.\r\n\r\n[207] \"Nemo masculus aut foemina, seu Christianus vel Judaeus, nisi\r\nMagister vel Licentiatus in Medicina foret, auderet humano corpori\r\nmederi in physica vel in chyrurgia.\" Marini, _Archiatri Pontifici_, Tom.\r\nI, p. 199, Roma, 1784.\r\n\r\n[208] Thomas Aquinas, the Angel of the Schools, who had taught in\r\nSalerno, and was well acquainted with the leading universities of\r\nEurope, was wont to say \"Quattuor sunt urbes caeteris praeeminentes,\r\nParisius in Scientiis, Salernum in Medicinis, Bononia in legibus,\r\nAurelianis in actoribus--\" there are four preeminent cities: Paris, in\r\nthe sciences; Salerno, in medicine; Bologna, in law; Orleans, in actors.\r\nOp. 17. _De Virtutibus et Vitiis_, Cap. ult.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval poet, Galfrido, expressed the same idea in verse when he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    \"In morbis sanat medici virtute Salernum\r\n    Aegros: in causis Bononia legibus armat\r\n    Nudos: Parisius dispensat in artibus illos\r\n    Panes, unde cibat robustos: Aurelianis\r\n    Educat in cunis actorum lacte tenellos.\"\r\n\r\n[209] It may be remarked that it was a woman, Lady Mary Montagu, who\r\nintroduced inoculation with small-pox virus into Western Europe, and\r\nthat it was also a woman--a simple English milkmaid--who communicated to\r\nJenner the information which led to his discovery of a prophylactic\r\nagainst small-pox. But of far greater importance was the introduction\r\ninto Europe of that priceless febrifuge and antiperiodic--chinchona\r\nbark. This was due to the Countess of Chinchon, vicereine of Peru.\r\nHaving been cured by its virtues of an aggravated case of tertian fever\r\nin 1638, while living in Lima, she lost no time, on her return to Spain,\r\nin making known to the world the marvelous curative properties of the\r\nprecious quinine-producing bark. The powder made from the bark was most\r\nappropriately called _Pulvis Comitessae_--the countess's powder--and by\r\nthis name it was long known to druggists and in commerce. Thanks to\r\nLinnaeus, the memory of the gracious lady will always be kept green,\r\nbecause her name is now borne by nearly eight score species of the\r\nbeautiful trees which constitute the great and incomparable genus\r\nChinchona.

In\r\nits restricted sense, however, it dates back to the beginning of the\r\nItalian Renaissance. For it was at this period that the collector's zeal\r\nbegan to manifest itself, and that were brought together those priceless\r\ntreasures of ancient art which are to-day the pride of the museums of\r\nRome and Florence. It was then that Pope Sixtus IV and Julius II, his\r\nnephew, laid the foundations of the great museums of the Capitol and the\r\nVatican, and enriched them with such famous masterpieces as the Ariadne,\r\nthe Nile, the Tiber, the Laocoon and the Apollo Belvidere. Their example\r\nwas quickly followed by such cardinals as Ippolito d'Este, Fernando de'\r\nMedici, and by representatives of the leading princely houses of the\r\nItalian peninsula. In rapid succession the palaces of the Borghese,\r\nChigi, Pamphili, Ludovisi, Barbarini and Aldobrandini became filled with\r\nthe choicest Greek and Roman antiques. In the course of time many of\r\nthese treasures found their way to the museums of Venice, Madrid, Paris,\r\nMunich and Dresden, while still others were purchased by wealthy art\r\nconnoisseurs in various parts of Europe and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning these antiques in marble and bronze were used chiefly\r\nfor decorative purposes. \"Courts, stairs, fountains, galleries and\r\npalaces were adorned with statues, busts, reliefs and sarcophagi applied\r\nin such a manner as to become incorporated in contemporary art and\r\nthereby to gain fresh life.\"[215]\r\n\r\nThese treasures of antiquity, statues, bas-reliefs, mosaics, coins,\r\nmedals, busts, sarcophagi, and productions of ceramic art, although at\r\nfirst used almost exclusively for decorating palaces and villas and\r\nenriching museums, were eventually to become of inestimable value in the\r\nstudy of the history of art and the civilization of Greece and Rome, as\r\nwell as of the various nations of antiquity with which they had come\r\ninto contact. Besides this, they supplied the necessary raw material not\r\nonly for classical archaeology, but also for that more comprehensive\r\nscience of archaeology which deals with the art, the architecture, the\r\nlanguage, the literature, the inscriptions, the manners, customs and\r\ndevelopment of our race from prehistoric times until the present day.\r\n\r\nAmong the women who took a prominent part in collecting material toward\r\nthe advancement of archaeologic science were those illustrious ladies--as\r\ncelebrated for their knowledge and culture as for their noble lineage\r\nand their patronage of men of letters--who presided over the brilliant\r\ncourts of Urbino, Mantua, Milan and Ferrara.\r\n\r\nPreeminent among these were Elizabetta Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, and\r\nIsabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua. The palace of the former--\"that\r\npeerless lady who excelled all others in excellence\"--was famous for its\r\nprecious antiques in bronze and marble, but above all for its superb\r\ncollection of rare old books and manuscripts in Greek, Latin and Hebrew.\r\n\r\nIsabella d'Este, who was through life the most intimate friend of\r\nElizabetta Gonzaga, was acclaimed by her contemporaries as \"the first\r\nlady in the world.\" She was a true daughter of the Renaissance, in the\r\nheart of which she was brought up; and \"the small, passing incidents of\r\nher everyday life are to us memorials of the classic age when the gods\r\nof Parnassus walked with men.\"[216] She was an even more enthusiastic\r\ncollector than the Duchess of Urbino, and her magnificent palace in\r\nMantua was filled with the choicest works of Greek and Roman art that\r\nwere then procurable.\r\n\r\nShe has been described as one who secured everything to which she took a\r\nfancy. She had but to hear of the discovery of a beautiful antique, a\r\nrare work in bronze or marble uncovered by the spade of the excavator,\r\nwhen she forthwith made an effort to procure it for her priceless\r\ncollection. If that was not possible, she would not rest until she could\r\nsecure something else even more precious. She aimed at supremacy in\r\neverything artistic and intellectual, and would be content with nothing\r\nshort of perfection. Hence it is that her collection of antiques, like\r\nthose of her friend, the Duchess of Urbino, is rightly regarded as\r\nhaving been of singular value in preparing the way for the foundation of\r\nscientific archaeology--a foundation that was laid by the eminent German\r\nscholar, Winckelmann, in the eighteenth century by the publication of\r\nhis masterly work--_History of the Art of Antiquity_.\r\n\r\nThe first woman of eminence to take an active part in archaeologic\r\nexcavation was the youngest sister of Napoleon Bonaparte, \"the\r\nbeautiful, clever and ambitious Caroline.\" When Joachim Murat became\r\nking of Naples, after his brother-in-law, Joseph Bonaparte, had in 1808\r\nbeen transferred to the throne of Spain, his wife, Queen Caroline, gave\r\nat once a new impetus to the work of the excavation of Pompeii along the\r\nlines planned a few years before by the eminent Neapolitan scholar,\r\nMichele Arditi. She exhibited the keenest interest in the work, and the\r\nnotable discoveries which were made under her inspiring supervision of\r\nthis important undertaking show how much classical archaeology owes to\r\nher intelligent and munificent patronage.\r\n\r\nQueen Caroline proved her interest in the excavations that were to\r\ncontribute so much to our knowledge of antiquity \"by appearing\r\nfrequently at Pompeii and stimulating the workmen to greater efforts.\r\nShe frequently spent entire days, during the great heat of summer, at\r\nthe excavations, to encourage the lazy workmen and to reward them in the\r\nevent of success. The funds were increased so as to make the employment\r\nof six hundred men possible. The Street of Tombs was next uncovered,\r\nforming a complete and solemn picture, greatly impressing the beholder\r\neven to-day. For the first time a complete outline of an ancient\r\nmarketplace and its surroundings could be obtained. The market, closed\r\nand inaccessible to wheeled traffic, was surrounded by a colonnade\r\nfilled with monuments, with the great temple in the background, and\r\nbeyond the arcades were other temples or public buildings, among the\r\nprincipal being the stately Basilica. Constant and increased efforts\r\nwere thus crowned by important results. The Queen did not withhold\r\ngenerous assistance. The French architect, Fr. Mazois, received from her\r\nfifteen hundred francs while preparing his monumental work at\r\nPompeii.\"[217]\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that Queen Caroline's archaeological work at\r\nPompeii was as far-reaching in its results as was that of her\r\nillustrious brother in the land of the Pharaohs. It drew in the most\r\nimpressive manner the attention of the world to the vast treasures of\r\nart which lay concealed under the earth-covered ruins of the once noted\r\ncities of the ancient world, and stimulated scholars and learned\r\nsocieties to undertake similar researches in Sicily, Greece,\r\nMesopotamia, Asia Minor, and the almost forgotten islands of the Aegean\r\nSeas.\r\n\r\nWhile this energetic sister of the great Napoleon was occupied in\r\nbringing to light those priceless treasures of art which had for\r\nseventeen centuries lain beneath the ashes of Vesuvius, a bright,\r\nrefined, _spirituelle_ young girl, born in Dublin and bred in England,\r\nwas unconsciously preparing herself for a brilliant career in the branch\r\nof archaeology known as Christian iconography. Her name was Anna Murphy,\r\nbetter known to the world as Mrs. Jameson. At an early age she gave\r\nevidence of unusual intelligence, and she had hardly attained to\r\nwomanhood when she was noted for her knowledge of languages and for her\r\nremarkable attainments in art and literature. Numerous journeys to\r\nFrance, Italy and Germany and a systematic study in the great museums\r\nand art galleries of these countries, but, above all, her association\r\nwith the most distinguished scholars of Europe, completed her education\r\nand prepared her for those splendid works on Christian art which have\r\nmade her name a household word throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jameson was a prolific writer, but those of her works on which her\r\nfame chiefly rests are the ones which are classed under the general\r\ntitle, _Sacred and Legendary Art_. They treat of God the Father and Son,\r\nof the Madonna and the Saints, as illustrated in art from the earliest\r\nages to modern times. So masterly and exhaustive was her treatment of\r\nthe difficult subjects discussed in this _chef d'oeuvre_ of hers that\r\nno less an authority than the eminent German archaeologist, F. X. Kraus,\r\nwrites of this elaborate production as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Neither before nor since has the subject matter of this work been\r\nhandled with such skill and thoroughness. The older iconographic works\r\nwere mere dilettanteism. For the first time since classical archaeology\r\nhad applied the principles of modern criticism to Greek and Roman\r\niconography, and had presented an example of scientific treatment free\r\nfrom such reproach, was a serious iconography of our early Christian\r\nmonuments possible. Mrs. Jameson was the first to attempt this on a\r\nlarge scale. It was clear to her--and here lay the advance which her\r\nwork reveals--that in order to accomplish her colossal task two things\r\nmust be realized. She must not build on a foundation of material that is\r\nimperfect or brought together in a haphazard way. She must not only see\r\nand test everything available in the way of monuments, but she must\r\nlikewise place the productions of literature and poetry beside those of\r\nthe plastic arts. It was clear to her, also, that, in this case, one\r\nwould throw light on the other, and that the investigator who would lay\r\nclaim to the name of archaeologist must, moreover, study the spirit of a\r\npeople in all its monumental and literary manifestations.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Jameson strove to learn the mind and the mode of early Christian\r\ntimes from the works of the Fathers. She saw in the hymns of the Middle\r\nAges and in the writings of the mystics the sources of the art ideas\r\nwhich disclose themselves in the wall and glass paintings of our\r\ncathedrals and in the entrancing creation of a Fiesole. She had also the\r\nspecial advantage of being thoroughly imbued with Dante's ideas of the\r\nplastic arts of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\"And all this is evidenced in a form which exhibits neither dry\r\ndissertation nor wearisome nomenclature. Each of her articles is a\r\nlittle essay. It teaches us what place the Madonna, or St. Catherine, or\r\nsome other saint has held in the memory and in the imagination of past\r\ncenturies. We behold the sainted forms flitting before our eyes in all\r\nthe charm of poetic perfection which was given them by the childlike\r\nphantasy of the Middle Ages, and in all the power which they exercised\r\nover men's minds, and which, however we may view the religious side of\r\nthe question, certainly had the effect of creating forms of infinite\r\nbeauty and pictures of unspeakable reality.\"[218]\r\n\r\nWhen we recollect that Mrs. Jameson achieved so much before the\r\nfoundations of Christian archaeology had been fully laid; before de\r\nRossi's monumental publications had supplied the means of interpreting\r\nearly Christian sculpture; before critics and archaeologists were at one\r\nregarding the significance of early Christian and Middle Age symbolism,\r\nor agreed on the principles that were to guide to a correct\r\nunderstanding of the pictures of Roman and Gothic art, and while\r\nstudents were yet in ignorance as to the real influence of Byzantine art\r\non that of western Europe, we cannot but wonder at the courage and the\r\nenergy of this gifted woman in undertaking and in bringing to a happy\r\nissue a work which, even to-day, with all our increased facilities and\r\ngreater array of facts, would be considered a herculean task.\r\n\r\nAs we read her admirable volumes on _Sacred and Legendary Art_ we can,\r\nas did a close friend of hers, see the enraptured author \"kindle into\r\nenthusiasm amidst the gorgeous natural beauty, the antique memorials and\r\nthe sacred Christian relics of Italy,\" and we are prepared to believe,\r\nwith the same friend, that there was not \"a cypress on the Roman hills,\r\nor a sunny vine overhanging the southern gardens, or a picture in those\r\nvast somber galleries of foreign palaces, or a catacomb spread out, vast\r\nand dark, under the martyr churches of the City of the Seven Hills,\r\nwhich was not associated with some vivid flashes of her intellect and\r\nimagination.\" And we can also understand how \"the strange, mystic\r\nsymbolism of the early mosaics was a familiar language to her,\" and why\r\nshe should experience special delight when she found herself \"on the\r\npolished marble of the Lateran floor or under the gorgeously somber\r\ntribune of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, reading off the quaint\r\nemblems or expounding the pious thoughts of more than a thousand years\r\nago.\"[219]\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that Queen Victoria recognized the surpassing\r\nmerits of this noble woman by placing her on the civil list, and that\r\nour own Longfellow was able to say of her masterpiece, _Sacred and\r\nLegendary Art_, \"It most amply supplies the cravings of the religious\r\nsentiment of the spiritual nature within.\"\r\n\r\nA countrywoman of Mrs. Jameson and her contemporary, who also deserves\r\nan honorable place in the literature of archaeology, is Louise Twining.\r\nAlthough inferior in intellectual attainments and literary activity to\r\nthe accomplished author of _Sacred and Legendary Art_, her two works on\r\n_Types and Figures of the Bible Illustrated by Art_ and _Symbols and\r\nEmblems of Early Mediaeval Christian Art_ have given her a well-deserved\r\nreputation on the Continent as well as in the British Isles. The latter\r\nvolume Mrs. Jameson herself declares in her _Legends of the Madonna_ to\r\nbe \"certainly the most complete and useful book of the kind which I know\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\nA third woman who has won fame for her sex in the island kingdom in the\r\ndomain of archeology is Miss Margaret Stotes. Her activities, however,\r\nhave been chiefly confined to the antiquities of Ireland, on which she\r\nis a recognized authority.\r\n\r\nThe notable part she took in editing Lord Dunraven's great work, _Notes\r\non Irish Architecture_, established her reputation on a firm basis.\r\nAmong her other important works are _Early Christian Art in Ireland_ and\r\n_Christian Inscriptions in the Irish Language_, chiefly collected and\r\ndrawn by George Petrie, one of the annual volumes of the Royal\r\nHistorical and Archaeological Association of Ireland. This work has\r\njustly been described as an epoch-making contribution to Christian\r\nepigraphy and to our rapidly developing knowledge of Keltic language\r\nand literature. The learned Dr. Krauss, than whom there is no more\r\ncompetent judge, in referring to this splendid performance, does not\r\nhesitate to affirm, \"No man could have done better than this brave\r\ncollege girl, whom I would wish to greet across the Channel with a\r\ncordial _Macte virtute_.\"\r\n\r\nThe women archaeologists so far mentioned, with the exception of Queen\r\nCaroline Murat, were conspicuous as writers rather than active\r\ninvestigators in the field. There have been, however, quite a number who\r\nhave won distinction as \"archaeologists of the spade\"--women who, either\r\nalone or with their husbands, have superintended excavations in\r\ndifferent lands, which have yielded results of untold scientific value.\r\nAmong the most conspicuous of these are Mme. Sophia Schliemann, Mme.\r\nDieulafoy and the enterprising Yankee girl, Miss Harriet A. Boyd.\r\n\r\nOf these the first named is the wife of the late Dr. Henry Schliemann,\r\nwho immortalized himself by his famous excavations at Troy, Tiryns and\r\nMycenae--enterprises which solved for us the great problem of nearly\r\nthirty centuries and demonstrated in the most startling manner \"the\r\ntruth of the foundations on which was framed the poetical conception\r\nthat has for thousands of years called forth the enchanted delight of\r\nthe educated world.\" During his meteoric career as an archaeologist,\r\nSchliemann was able to realize the dreams of his youth, and succeeded in\r\nunveiling the mystery that had so long hung over Sacred Ilios, and to\r\ngive the heroes of the Iliad a local habitation on the rediscovered\r\nPlain of Troy. And his glorious achievements we must credit largely to\r\nthat brave and devoted woman--his wife--who was ever at his side to\r\nshare in his trials and labors and to raise his drooping spirits in\r\nhours of depression, or when hostile criticism treated him as a\r\nvisionary in the pursuit of a chimera.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schliemann is a Greek lady who was born and bred under the shadow\r\nof the Acropolis and a worthy descendant of those proud Athenian women\r\nwho wore the golden grasshopper in their hair as a sign that they were\r\nnatives of the City of the Violet Crown. She was not only dowered with\r\nintellectual gifts of a high order, but she was also her husband's most\r\ncongenial companion and sympathetic friend in all his literary work,\r\nwhile she was his very right hand in those glorious enterprises at\r\nHissarlik and Mycenae, which secured for both of them undying fame.\r\n\r\nDr. Schliemann was the first to attest the never-failing assistance\r\nwhich he received from this noble woman who, as he informs us, was \"a\r\nwarm admirer of Homer\" and \"with glad enthusiasm\" joined her husband in\r\nexecuting the great work which he had conceived in his early boyhood.\r\nUsually they worked together, but at times Mrs. Schliemann superintended\r\na gang of laborers at one spot while the Doctor was occupied at another\r\nin the immediate vicinity. Thus it was she who excavated the heroic\r\ntumulus of Batieia in the Troad--that Batieia who, according to Homer,\r\nwas a queen of the Amazons and undertook a campaign against Troy.[220]\r\n\r\nMme. Jane Dieulafoy is noted as the collaborator of her husband, Marcel\r\nDieulafoy, in the important archaeological mission to Persia that was\r\nentrusted to him by the French government. The results of this mission,\r\nin which Mme. Dieulafoy had a conspicuous part, were published in Paris\r\nin 1884 in five octavo volumes.\r\n\r\nIt was during this expedition to the ancient empire of Cyrus and\r\nArtaxerxes that this indefatigable couple became interested in the ruins\r\nof Susa, the ancient capital of the Persian kings. On their return to\r\nFrance they succeeded in securing money and supplies for conducting\r\nexcavations among these ruins which, in the end, yielded results which\r\nwere, in some respects, as important as those which rewarded the labors\r\nof the Schliemanns in Greece and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nSo completely had Susa--the City of the Lilies--been buried and\r\nforgotten for nearly two thousand years that even its site was almost as\r\nmuch a matter of dispute as was that of ancient Troy. And yet it was one\r\nof the greatest and richest cities of antiquity--the city of Esther and\r\nDaniel, the city of the mighty Assuerus who reigned from India even unto\r\nEthiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces--the city where the\r\ngreat Alexander celebrated his nuptials with Statira, the daughter of\r\nDarius, with a magnificent festival at which, according to Plutarch,\r\n\"there were no fewer than nine thousand guests, to each of which he gave\r\na golden cup for the libations.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1884, the two brave and venturesome explorers were on their\r\nway to Susa with high hopes, but not without a full knowledge of the\r\ndifficulties and dangers that they would have to confront among the\r\nfanatical nomads of Arabistan, where the very name of Christian inspires\r\nrage and horror. It meant, as Mme. Dieulafoy herself tells us, \"to\r\ncross the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf\r\nand the deserts of Elam three times in less than a year; to pass whole\r\nweeks without undressing; to sleep on the bare ground; to struggle\r\nnights and days against robbers and thieves; to cross rivers without a\r\nbridge; to suffer heat, rain, cold, mists, fever, fatigue, hunger,\r\nthirst, the stings of divers insects; to lead this hard and perilous\r\nexistence without being guided by any interest other than the glory of\r\none's country.\"[221]\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of all the opposition which they encountered among\r\nthe fanatical Mussulmans of Arabistan and of the dreadful sufferings\r\nincident to living in a desert where it was at times impossible to\r\nsecure the necessaries of life, their mission was successful, and their\r\naccount of their finds in the ancient capital of Elam was as thrilling\r\nin its way as anything reported of the excavations at Troy or Pompeii.\r\nTheir splendid collection of specimens of ancient Persian art and\r\narchitecture, now on exhibition in the Museum of the Louvre, testifies\r\nto the successful issue of their expedition and to their indomitable\r\nenergy in conducting researches under the most untoward\r\nconditions.[222] So highly did the French government value the part\r\nMme. Dieulafoy had taken in this arduous enterprise that it conferred on\r\nher a distinction rarely awarded to a woman for scientific work--that of\r\nChevalier of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nAs an archaeologist, the gifted and energetic American woman, Miss\r\nHarriet Boyd--now Mrs. C. H. Hawes--has achieved an international\r\nreputation for her remarkable excavations in the island of Crete. She is\r\na frequent contributor to archaeological journals; but it is upon her\r\nsplendid work in the field that her fame will ultimately rest.\r\n\r\nHer first work of importance was undertaken as Fellow of the American\r\nSchool of Classical Studies at Athens. This was in 1900, and the field\r\nof her investigations was the Isthmus of Hierapetra in Crete. Here she\r\nexcavated numerous tombs and houses of the early Geometric Period,\r\n_circa_ 900 B.C., and paved the way for those brilliant discoveries\r\nwhich rewarded her labors during the following three years.\r\n\r\nThe investigations conducted during these three years under Miss Boyd's\r\ndirections yielded results of transcendent value. Assisted by three\r\nyoung American women--the Misses B. E. Wheeler, Blanche E. Williams, and\r\nEdith H. Hall--she superintended the work of more than a hundred native\r\nemployees whom she had on her payroll. By good fortune in the choice of\r\na site for excavation and by well-directed efforts she was soon able to\r\nunearth one of the oldest of Cretan cities and to expose to view the\r\nruins of what was probably one of the ninety cities which Homer tells us\r\nin his Odyssey graced the land of Crete--\"a fair land and a rich, in the\r\nmidst of a wine-dark sea.\"\r\n\r\nSo remarkable were the finds in this long-buried Minoan town and so well\r\npreserved are its general features that it has justly been called the\r\nCretan Pompeii. It antedates by long centuries the oldest cities of\r\nGreece and was a flourishing center of commerce ages before the heroes\r\nof the Iliad battled on the plains of Troy.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that the extraordinary discoveries made by\r\nthis enterprising Yankee girl at Gournia, no less than those made by\r\nBritish and Italian archaeologists at Knossos and Phaestos, have\r\ncompletely revolutionized our ideas respecting the state of culture of\r\nthe inhabitants of Crete during the second and third millenia before the\r\nChristian era. They have thrown a flood of light on the origins of\r\nMediterranean culture, and have, at the same time, supplied material for\r\na study of European civilization that was before entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nAn enduring monument to Miss Boyd's ability as an archaeologist is her\r\nnotable volume containing an account of her excavations at Gournia,\r\nVasilike and other prehistoric sites on the Isthmus of Hierapetra. It\r\nwill bear comparison with any similar productions by the Schliemanns or\r\nthe Dieulafoys. A later work on _Crete, the Forerunner of Greece_, which\r\nshe wrote in collaboration with her husband, Mr. C. H. Hawes, is also a\r\nproduction of recognized merit. As a study on the origin of Greek\r\ncivilization it opens up many new vistas in pre-history and illumines\r\nmany questions that were before involved in mystery.\r\n\r\nBesides Mrs. Hawes, three other American women have achieved marked\r\ndistinction by their archaeological researches. These are Mrs. Sarah\r\nYorke Stevenson, Miss Alice C. Fletcher and Mrs. Zelia Nuttall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stevenson has long been identified with the progress of\r\narchaeological research, especially with that in Egypt and the\r\nMediterranean. A prominent member of many learned societies, she is\r\nlikewise a writer and lecturer of note. She enjoys the distinction of\r\nbeing the first woman whose name appears as a lecturer on the calendar\r\nof the University of Harvard. In acknowledgment of her scholarly ability\r\nand eminent services in the development of its Department of Archaeology,\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania has conferred upon her the honorary\r\ndegree of Doctor of Science.\r\n\r\nThat American women have not been behind their sisters in Europe in\r\ntheir enthusiasm for archaeological investigation is evinced by the\r\nresearches and writings of Miss Alice C. Fletcher and Mrs. Zelia\r\nNuttall, both of whom enjoy an international reputation in the learned\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMiss Fletcher's chosen field of labor has been in ethnology and\r\nanthropology. Her studies of the folk lore and the manners and customs\r\nof various tribes of North American Indians have a distinct and\r\npermanent value, while those of her contributions which have been\r\npublished by the Smithsonian Institution and the Bureau of\r\nEthnology--contributions based on personal knowledge of a long residence\r\namong the tribes she writes about--show that she has exceptional talent\r\nfor the branches of archaeology to which she has devoted many years of\r\nearnest and successful study.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nuttall is the daughter of an American mother and an English\r\nfather. Thanks to the care that was bestowed on her education by her\r\nparents and to her long residence in the different countries of Europe,\r\nshe is proficient in seven languages. This knowledge of tongues has been\r\nof inestimable advantage to her in her researches in European libraries\r\nand in those historical and archaeological investigations which have\r\nrendered her famous. She has devoted special attention to the early\r\nhistory, languages, religions and calendar systems of the primitive\r\ninhabitants of Mexico and Central America, in all of which she is a\r\nrecognized authority.\r\n\r\nWhen, some years ago, the mysterious ruins of Mexico began to attract\r\nthe special attention of archaeologists, Mrs. Nuttall was selected by the\r\nUniversity of California as the field director of the commission which\r\nit sent to pursue archaeological researches in this Egypt of the New\r\nWorld. A more competent or a more enthusiastic director could not have\r\nbeen chosen. Her finds in the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon at\r\nTeotihuacan and elsewhere in our sister republic were especially\r\nimportant. In recognition of her achievements President Porfirio Diaz\r\nnominated Mrs. Nuttall honorary professor in the Mexican National\r\nMuseum. She was also offered the position of curator of the\r\narchaeological Museum of Mexico; but this office she declined. She holds\r\nmembership in a large number of learned societies in America and Europe\r\nand is a frequent contributor to numerous magazines on historical and\r\narchaeological subjects. She has had the good fortune to discover a\r\nnumber of important manuscripts illustrating the early history of\r\nMexico. Chief among these are a Hispano-American manuscript which she\r\ndug out of one of the libraries of Madrid and another which was found in\r\na private collection in England and reproduced in facsimile in this\r\ncountry. In honor of its fair discoverer it is now known as the Codex\r\nNuttall, and is regarded by experts as one of the most precious records\r\nof ancient Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably Mrs. Nuttall's most valuable contribution to\r\narchaeological science is her erudite work entitled _The Fundamental\r\nPrinciples of Old and New World Civilizations_. It is a comparative\r\nresearch based on a study of the ancient Mexican, religious,\r\nsociological and calendar systems, and represents thirteen years of\r\nassiduous labor. It is a worthy monument to the scientific ability of\r\nthis gifted Americanist, and one which brilliantly illumines some of the\r\nmost controverted points of comparative archaeology.\r\n\r\nThe Nestor of women archaeologists is Donna Ersilia\r\nCaetani-Bovatelli--the daughter of the famous Dante scholar, the late\r\nDuke Don Michel Angelo Caetani-Sermonetta. Since the days of Boniface\r\nVIII, whom Dante scornfully denounced as _lo principe de' Pharisei_, the\r\nfamily of the Caetani has been one of the most illustrious of the Roman\r\nnobility, and is to-day ranked with those of the Colonna and Orsini.\r\n\r\nBesides his thorough knowledge of Dante, whose _Divina Commedia_ he\r\nregarded as the great artistic production of the human mind--a work\r\nwhich he knew by heart--the Duke of Sermonetta was deeply versed in\r\nphilology and archaeology. No one was more familiar with the history and\r\nantiquities of Rome than he was, nor a greater friend and patron of\r\nscholars of every nationality. The Palazzo Caetani was the resort of not\r\nonly the savants of Rome, but also and especially of those who gathered\r\nfrom all quarters of the world to study the rich collections of\r\nantiquities for which the Eternal City is so famous. Here the ablest\r\nauthorities in history and archaeology discussed the latest discoveries\r\namong the ruins of Greece and Asia Minor, and the most recent finds in\r\nthe Forum or amidst the crumbling ruins of the palaces of the Caesars.\r\n\r\nHaving such a father and brought up in such an environment it is not\r\nsurprising that Donna Ersilia acquired at an early age that taste for\r\narchaeology which was, as events proved, to constitute the chief\r\noccupation of her long and busy life. Having enjoyed and studied\r\nliterature and the languages under the best masters in Rome, she was\r\nthoroughly prepared for the work of deciphering Greek and Latin\r\ninscriptions and for an intelligent study of the ancient monuments of\r\nItaly and Hellas.\r\n\r\nHer learned countryman, A. de Gubernatis, assures us that she has such a\r\nthorough knowledge of Latin and Greek that she writes both with ease and\r\nelegance, and that she is endowed with an admirable memory for philology\r\nand archaeology. Besides being a mistress of several modern languages,\r\nshe is also familiar with Sanscrit.\r\n\r\nSince the death of her husband, in 1879, she has devoted all her time,\r\noutside of that given to the care and education of her children, to the\r\npursuit of classical archaeology, in which she has long been regarded as\r\nan authority of the first order. Her salon, unlike those of the\r\nfrivolous leaders of high life, has for many years been the favorite\r\nrendezvous in Rome of learned men and women from every clime. Here were\r\nseen the noted historians Gregorovius, Theodore Mommsen, and Giovanni\r\nBattista de Rossi, the illustrious founder of Christian archaeology. Here\r\nthe representatives of the French, German and American schools of\r\narchaeology meet to exchange views on their favorite science and to find\r\ninspiration in the knowledge and enthusiasm of their gifted hostess, who\r\nalways takes an active part in their recondite discussions, and never\r\nfails to contribute her share to these meetings, which have contributed\r\nso much toward the advancement of science and the history of antiquity.\r\nWhether the discussion turn on the deciphering of an ancient text, the\r\ninscription of a monument or a recently excavated sarcophagus, Donna\r\nErsilia's opinion is eagerly sought, and her judgment is generally\r\nunerring.\r\n\r\nThis cultured and erudite daughter of sunny Italy has been a prolific\r\nwriter on her favorite branch of research. Besides contributing to such\r\npublications as the _Nuova Antologia_ and the bulletins of the\r\narchaeological commissions in Rome, she has found time to prepare for the\r\npress a number of volumes of the highest value on divers questions of\r\nRoman and Greek archaeology.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, in this connection, to note the fact that, after Mme.\r\nCurie had been refused admittance into the French Academy, one of the\r\nmembers of this institution, who had voted against her on the ground\r\nthat she was a woman, had occasion to attend a meeting of the Academy of\r\nthe Lincei in Rome, an association which plays the same role in Italy as\r\ndoes the French Academy in France, and found, to his astonishment, that\r\nthe dean of the department of archaeology, as well as the presiding\r\nofficer of some of the most important meetings of the academy, was a\r\nwoman. She was no other than Donna Ersilia Caetani-Bovatelli, the\r\nlearned and gracious scion of an honored race. So taken aback was the\r\nGallic opponent of _feminisme_ that he could but exclaim: \"_Diable!_\r\nthey order things differently in Italy from what we do in _la belle\r\nFrance_.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering their attainments and achievements, the two women who occupy\r\nthe highest place as archaeologists in the English-speaking world are\r\nMrs. Agnes Smith Lewis and Margaret Dunlop Gibson. They are the twin\r\ndaughters of the Rev. John Smith, an English clergyman, and have long\r\nenjoyed an enviable reputation among Scriptural scholars and\r\nOrientalists.\r\n\r\nDuring their youth they had the advantage of instruction under the best\r\nmasters, and, among other things, acquired a wide knowledge of the\r\nmodern and classical languages. Subsequent study and frequent visits to\r\nGreece and the Orient made them proficient in modern Greek, Arabic,\r\nHebrew and Syriac. Becoming interested in the search for ancient\r\nmanuscripts, they resolved to make the long and arduous journey to the\r\nGreek convent of St. Catherine on Mt. Sinai.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of January, 1892, these two brave and enterprising\r\nwomen left Suez for their destination in the heart of the Arabian\r\ndesert. They were accompanied only by their dragoman and Bedouin\r\nservants. Eleven camels carried the two travelers, their baggage, tents\r\nand provisions for fifty days. They had laid in supplies not only for\r\nthe two or three weeks they were to spend on the way to and from Sinai,\r\nbut also for the month they expected to remain at the Convent of St.\r\nCatherine.\r\n\r\nArriving at the end of their journey, they were most cordially received\r\nby the monks, who afforded them every facility for examining the\r\ntreasures of their unique and venerable library. They immediately set to\r\nwork, and before they left the room in which the manuscripts were\r\npreserved they had made one of the most remarkable finds of the century.\r\nFor, in closely inspecting a dirty, forbidding old manuscript whose\r\nleaves had probably not been turned for centuries, they discovered a\r\npalimpsest, of which the upper writing contained the biographies of\r\nwomen saints, while that beneath proved to be one of the earliest copies\r\nof the Syriac Gospels, if not the very earliest in existence.\r\n\r\nNo find since the celebrated discovery by Tischendorf of the Sinaitic\r\nCodex, in the same convent nearly fifty years before, ever excited such\r\ninterest among Scriptural scholars or was hailed with greater\r\nrejoicings. It was by all Biblical students regarded as an invaluable\r\ncontribution to Scriptural literature, and as a find which \"has doubled\r\nour sources of knowledge of the darkest corner of New Testament\r\ncriticism.\" To distinguish it from the _Codex Sinaiticus_, the precious\r\nmanuscript brought to light by Mrs. Lewis has been very appropriately\r\nnamed after the fortunate discoverer, and will hereafter be known as the\r\nCodex Ludovicus.[223]\r\n\r\nAnother find of rare importance made by the gifted twin sisters was a\r\nPalestinian Syriac lectionary similar to the hitherto unique copy in the\r\nLibrary of the Vatican. A special interest attaches to this lectionary\r\nfrom the fact that it is written in the language that was most probably\r\nspoken by our Lord.\r\n\r\nAmong other notable discoveries of Mrs. Lewis and her sister during the\r\nfour visits[224] which they made to Mt. Sinai and Palestine between the\r\nyears 1892 and 1897 were a number of manuscripts in Arabic and a portion\r\nof the original Hebrew manuscript of Ecclesiastes which was written\r\nabout 200 B.C. Previously the oldest copies of this book of the Old\r\nTestament were the Greek and Syriac versions.\r\n\r\nWhat is specially remarkable about the discoveries made by Mrs. Lewis\r\nand Mrs. Gibson is that they were able to make so many valuable finds\r\nafter the convent library at Mt. Sinai had been so frequently examined\r\nby previous scholars. The indefatigable Tischendorf made three visits to\r\nthis library and had but one phenomenal success. But neither \"he nor any\r\nof the other wandering scholars who have visited the convent attained,\"\r\nas has been well said, \"to a tithe of the acquaintance with its\r\ntreasures which these energetic ladies possess.\"\r\n\r\nBut more remarkable than the mere discovery of so many invaluable\r\nmanuscripts, which was, of course, an extraordinary achievement, is the\r\nfact that these manuscripts, whether in Syriac, Arabic or Hebrew, have\r\nbeen translated, annotated and edited by these same scholarly women.\r\nAlready more than a score of volumes have come from their prolific pens,\r\nall evincing the keenest critical acumen and the highest order of\r\nBiblical and archaeological scholarship. The reader who desires a popular\r\naccount of their famous discoveries should by all means read Mrs.\r\nGibson's entertaining volume, _How the Codex Was Found_, and Mrs. Lewis'\r\ncharming little work entitled, _In the Shadow of Sinai_. As to those\r\nmen--and the species is yet far from extinct--who still doubt the\r\ncapacity of women for the higher kinds of intellectual effort, let them\r\nglance at the pages of the numerous volumes given to the press by these\r\nrichly dowered women under the captions of _Studia Sinaitica_ and _Horae\r\nSemiticae_; and, if they are able to comprehend the evidence before them,\r\nthey will be forced to admit that the long-imagined difference between\r\nthe intellectual powers of men and women is one of fancy and not one of\r\nreality.[225]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, strange to relate, while Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. Gibson were\r\nelectrifying the learned world by their achievements in the highest\r\nform of scholarship, the slow-moving University of Cambridge was gravely\r\ndebating \"whether it was a proper thing to confer degrees upon women,\"\r\nand preparing to answer the question in the negative. The fact that\r\nthere were \"representatives of the unenfranchised sex at their gates who\r\nhad gathered more laurels in the field of scholarship than most of those\r\nwho belong to the privileged sex\" did not appeal to the university dons\r\nor prevent them from putting themselves on record as favoring a\r\ncondition of things which, at this late age of the world, should be\r\nexpected only among the women-enslaving followers of Mohammed.\r\n\r\nThe saying that \"a prophet hath no honor in his own country\" was\r\nfulfilled to the letter in the case of the two women who had shed such\r\nluster on the land of their birth. While foreign institutions were vying\r\nwith one another in showering honors on the two brilliant Englishwomen,\r\nwith whose praises the whole world was resounding, the University of\r\nCambridge was silent. The University of St. Andrews conferred on them\r\nthe degree of LL.D., while conservative old Heidelberg, casting aside\r\nits age-old traditions, made haste to honor them with the degree of\r\nDoctor of Divinity. In addition to this, Halle made Mrs. Lewis a Doctor\r\nof Philosophy. One would have thought that sheer shame, if not patriotic\r\nspirit, would have compelled the university in whose shadows the two\r\nwomen had their home, and in which Mrs. Lewis' husband had held for\r\nyears an official appointment, to show itself equally appreciative of\r\nsuperlative merit and equally ready to reward rare scholarship,\r\nregardless of the sex of the beneficiaries. But no. The illustrious\r\narchaeologists and Biblical scholars were women, and this fact alone was\r\nin the estimation of the Cambridge authorities enough to withhold from\r\nthem that recognition which was so spontaneously accorded them by the\r\ngreat universities of the Continent.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only instance of the kind. While the celebrated twin\r\nsisters just referred to were so materially contributing to our\r\nknowledge of Biblical lore, another Englishwoman, Jane E. Harrison, who\r\nlived within hearing of the church bells of Cambridge, was lecturing to\r\ndelighted audiences in Newnham College on the history, mythology and\r\nmonuments of ancient Athens, and writing those learned works on the\r\nreligion and antiquities of Greece which have given her so conspicuous a\r\nplace among modern archaeologists.[226] But, as in the case of her\r\ndistinguished neighbors, the discoverers of the _Codex Ludovicus_, the\r\ndegrees she was honored with came not from Cambridge, with which,\r\nthrough her fellowship in Newnham, she was so closely connected.\r\n\r\nAnd while this gifted lady was deserving so well of science and\r\nliterature, the undergraduate students of Cambridge, following the cue\r\ngiven by the twenty-four hundred graduates who had just rejected the\r\nproposal to give honorary degrees to women who could pass the required\r\nexaminations, were giving an exhibition of rowdyism which far surpassed\r\nthat which, a few years before, had so disgraced the University of\r\nEdinburgh, when the same question of degrees for women was under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of an eye witness of the turbulent scene at\r\nCambridge, \"The undergraduate students appeared to be, as a body,\r\nviciously opposed to the proposal to give degrees to women, and became\r\nfairly riotous. They hooted those who supported the reform and fired\r\ncrackers even in the Senate House and made the night lurid with bonfires\r\nand powder. They put up insulting effigies of girl students, and such\r\nmottoes as 'Get you to Girton, Beatrice. Get you to Newnham. Here is no\r\nplace for maids!'\"\r\n\r\nVerily, when such scenes are possible in one of the world's great\r\nintellectual centers--a place where, above all others, women should\r\nreceive due recognition for their contributions toward the progress of\r\nknowledge--one is constrained to declare that what we call civilization\r\nis still far from the ideal. And, when one witnesses the total\r\nindifference of institutions like Cambridge and the French Academy to\r\nthe splendid achievements of women like Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. Gibson and Mme.\r\nCurie, one cannot but exclaim in words Apocalyptic: \"How long, O Lord,\r\nholy and true,\" is this iniquitous discrimination against one-half of\r\nour race to endure? O Lord, how long?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[215] A.

Referring to the\r\nsufferings and privations which they endured during their third year's\r\nwork at Hissarlik, Dr. Schliemann writes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My poor wife and myself, therefore, suffered very much since the icy\r\nnorth wind, which recalls Homer's frequent mention of the blasts of\r\nBoreas, blew with such violence through the chinks of our house-walls,\r\nwhich were made of planks, that we were not even able to light our lamps\r\nin the evening, while the water which stood near the hearth froze into\r\nsolid masses. During the day we could, to some degree, bear the cold by\r\nworking in the excavations; but, in the evenings, we had nothing to keep\r\nus warm except our enthusiasm for the great work of discovering Troy.\"\r\n\r\nSo high was Dr. Schliemann's opinion of his wife's ability as an\r\narchaeologist that he entrusted to her--as well as to their daughter,\r\nAndromache, and son, Agamemnon--the continuation of the work which death\r\nprevented him from completing.\r\n\r\n[221] See Mme. Dieulafoy's graphic account of the expedition in a work\r\nwhich has been translated into English under the title, _At Susa, the\r\nAncient Capital of the Kings of Persia, Narrative of Travel Through\r\nWestern Persia and Excavations Made at the Site of the Lost City of the\r\nLilies, 1884-1886_, Philadelphia, 1890.\r\n\r\nSee also her other related work--crowned by the French\r\nAcademy--entitled, _La Perse, La Chaldee et la Susiane_, Paris, 1887.\r\n\r\n[222] Among the specimens secured were two of extraordinary beauty and\r\ninterest. One of them is a beautiful enameled frieze of a lion and the\r\nother, likewise a work in enamel, represents a number of polychrome\r\nfigures of the Immortals--the name given to the guards of the Great\r\nKings of Persia. Both are truly magnificent specimens of ceramic art,\r\nand compare favorably with anything of the kind which antiquity has\r\nbequeathed to us. Commenting on the pictures of the Persian guards, Mme.\r\nDieulafoy writes: \"Whatever their race may be, our Immortals appear fine\r\nin line, fine in form, fine in color and constitute a ceramic work\r\ninfinitely superior to the bas-reliefs, so justly celebrated, of Lucca\r\ndella Robbia.\" Op. cit., p. 222.\r\n\r\n[223] One passage in this codex bears so strongly on a leading argument\r\nof this work that I cannot resist the temptation to give it with Mrs.\r\nLewis' own comment:\r\n\r\n\"The piece of my work,\" she writes, _In the Shadow of Sinai_, p. 98 et\r\nseq., \"which has given me the greatest satisfaction, consists in the\r\ndecipherment of two words in John IV, 27. They were well worth all our\r\nvisits to Sinai, for they illustrate an action of our Lord which seems\r\nto be recorded nowhere else, and which has some degree of inherent\r\nprobability from what we know of His character. The passage is 'His\r\ndisciples came and wondered that with the women he was _standing and\r\ntalking_'....\r\n\r\n\"Why was our Lord standing? He had been sitting on the wall when the\r\ndisciples left Him; and, we know that He was tired. Moreover, sitting is\r\nthe proper attitude for an Easterner when engaged in teaching. And an\r\nordinary Oriental would never rise of his own natural free will out of\r\npoliteness to a woman. It may be that He rose in His enthusiasm for the\r\ngreat truths He was uttering; but, I like to think that His great heart,\r\nwhich embraced the lowest of humanity, lifted Him above the restrictions\r\nof His race and age, and made Him show that courtesy to our sex, even in\r\nthe person of a degraded specimen, which is considered among all really\r\nprogressive peoples to be a mark of true and noble manhood. To shed even\r\na faint light upon that wondrous story of His tabernacling amongst us is\r\nan inestimable privilege and worthy of all the trouble we can possibly\r\ntake.\"\r\n\r\n[224] Mrs. Gibson, unaccompanied by her sister, has since made two more\r\nvisits to Mt. Sinai in order to complete the work so auspiciously begun.\r\n\r\n[225] The following partial list of the works of these erudite twins on\r\nsubjects connected with Scripture and Oriental literature gives some\r\nidea of their extraordinary attainments and of their prodigious activity\r\nin researches that are usually considered entirely foreign to the tastes\r\nand aptitudes of women.\r\n\r\n_Some Pages of the Four Gospels Retranscribed From the Sinaitic\r\nPalimpsest_, with a translation of the whole text by Agnes Smith Lewis.\r\n\r\n_An Arabic Version of St. Paul's Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians,\r\nGalatians and part of Ephesians._ Edited from a ninth century MS. by\r\nMargaret Dunlop Gibson.\r\n\r\n_Apocrypha Sinaitica._ Containing the Anaphora Pilati in Syriac and\r\nArabic: the Syriac transcribed by J.

Ryssel, in the _Schweizerische\r\nTheologische Zeitschrift_, XVI, Jahrgang, 1899.\r\n\r\n[226] For an evidence of this learned lady's competency to deal with the\r\nmost recondite stores of history and archaeology, the reader is referred\r\nto two of her later works, viz., _Primitive Athens as Described by\r\nThucydides_, Cambridge, 1906, and _Prolegomena to the Study of Greek\r\nReligion_, Cambridge University Press, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWOMEN AS INVENTORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There have been very learned women as there have been women warriors,\r\nbut there have never been women inventors.\"[227] Thus wrote Voltaire\r\nwith that flippancy and cocksureness which was so characteristic of the\r\nauthor of the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_--a man who was ever ready to\r\ngive, offhand, a categorical answer to any question that came before him\r\nfor discussion. His countryman, Proudhon, expressed the same opinion in\r\nother words when he wrote, _Les femmes n'ont rien invente, pas meme leur\r\nquenouille_--women have invented nothing, not even their distaff.\r\n\r\nHad these two writers thoroughly sifted the evidence available, even in\r\ntheir day, for a proper consideration of this interesting subject, they\r\nwould, both of them, have reached a very different conclusion from that\r\nwhich is expressed in the sentences just quoted. Had they consulted the\r\nrecords of antiquity, they would have learned that most of the earliest\r\nand most important inventions were attributed to women; and, had they\r\nstudied the reports of explorers among the savage tribes of the modern\r\nworld, they would have found that these early legends and traditions\r\nregarding the inventions of women were fully confirmed by what was being\r\ndone in their own time. Man's first needs were food, shelter and\r\nclothing; and tradition in all parts of the world is unanimous in\r\nascribing to woman the invention, in essentially their present forms, of\r\nall the arts most conducive to the preservation and well-being of our\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, the inventors of specially\r\nuseful things were, as a reward of their deserts, enrolled among the\r\ngods, as were certain heroes among the ancient Greeks and Romans.\r\nForemost among these was Isis, who laid the foundation of agriculture by\r\nthe introduction of the culture of wheat and other cereals. Before her\r\ntime the Egyptians lived on roots and herbs. In lieu of these crude\r\narticles of food, Isis gave them bread and other more wholesome\r\naliments. She invented the process of making linen and was the first to\r\napply a sail to the propulsion of a boat. To her also was attributed the\r\nart of embalming, the discovery of many medicines and the beginnings of\r\nEgyptian literature.\r\n\r\nEven more prominent was Pallas Athene, one of the greatest divinities of\r\nthe Greeks. Virgil, in his _Georgics_, invokes her as\r\n\r\n    \"Inventor, Pallas, of the fatt'ning oil,\r\n    Thou founder of the plow and the plowman's toil.\"\r\n\r\nBut not only was she regarded as the _oleae inventrix_-inventress of the\r\nolive--as Virgil phrases it, but also as the inventor of all\r\nhandicrafts, whether of women or men. Like Isis, she was deemed the\r\noriginator of agriculture and many of the mechanic arts. But, above all,\r\nshe was the inventor of musical instruments and those plastic and\r\ngraphic arts which have for ages placed Greece in the forefront of\r\ncivilization and culture.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning it was woman who first made use of wool and flax for\r\ntextile fabrics; and of this prehistoric woman one can affirm what\r\nSolomon, in his _Book of Proverbs_, said of the virtuous woman of his\r\nday:\r\n\r\n    \"She seeketh wool and flax and worketh diligently with her hands;\r\n    She layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff.\"\r\n\r\nShe was also the first one to weave cotton and silk. It was Mama Oclo,\r\nthe wife of Manco Capac, as the Inca historian, Garcilasso de la Vega,\r\ntells us, who taught the women of ancient Peru \"to sew and weave cotton\r\nand wool and to make clothes for themselves, their husbands and\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was a woman, Se-ling-she, the wife of the emperor, Hwang-te, who\r\nlived nearly three thousand years before Christ, to whom the most\r\nancient Chinese writers assign the discovery of silk. Her name is\r\nperpetuated in the name China, the goddess of silkworms, and under this\r\nappellation she still receives divine honors.\r\n\r\nThe preparation and weaving of silk were introduced into Japan by four\r\nChinese girls, and the new industry soon became there, as in China, one\r\nof the chief sources, as it is to-day, of the country's wealth. To\r\nperpetuate the memory of these four pioneer silk weavers the grateful\r\nJapanese erected a temple in their honor in the province of Setsu.\r\n\r\nAccording to tradition, the eggs of the silk moth and the seed of the\r\nmulberry tree were conveyed to India, concealed in the lining of her\r\nheaddress, by a Chinese princess. She was thus instrumental in\r\nestablishing in the region watered by the Indus and the Ganges the same\r\nindustry which her countrywomen had introduced into the Land of the\r\nRising Sun.\r\n\r\nCashmere shawls and attar of roses, the costliest of perfumes, are\r\nattributed to an Indian empress, Nur Mahal, whom her husband, in view of\r\nher achievements, as well as on account of his passionate love for her,\r\ncalled \"The Light of the World.\"[228]\r\n\r\nAnd what shall we say of those exquisite creations of woman's brain and\r\nhand--needle-point and pillow lace? These two inventions, like the\r\nmanufacture of silk, have given employment to tens of thousands of women\r\nthroughout the world; and, in such countries as Italy, Belgium and\r\nFrance, where lace-making has received special attention, they have for\r\ncenturies been most prolific sources of revenue. Silk fabrics in ancient\r\nRome were worth their weight in gold. The finest specimens of point lace\r\nare, even to-day, as highly prized as precious stones, and, like the\r\ngreat masterpieces of plastic art, are handed down as heirlooms from\r\ngeneration to generation. In no other instance, except possibly in the\r\nhairspring of a watch, is there such an extraordinary difference in\r\nvalue between the raw material and the finished product as there is in\r\nthe case of the finest thread lace.\r\n\r\nA great sensation was caused in Italy a few decades ago when a humble\r\nworkwoman, Signora Bassani, succeeded in rediscovering the peculiar\r\nstitch of the celebrated Venetian point, which had been lost for\r\ncenturies. She was at once granted a patent for her invention, which was\r\nby her countrymen regarded as an event of national importance.\r\n\r\nAfter painting and sculpture, probably no art has contributed more to\r\nthe development of the esthetic sense among the nations of the world\r\nthan has the art whose chief tools are the needle and the bobbin in the\r\ndeft hands of a beauty-loving woman. If the name of the first lace-maker\r\nhad not been lost in the mists of antiquity, it is reasonable to suppose\r\nthat she, too, would long since have had a monument erected to her\r\nmemory, as well as the weavers of silk and makers of attar of roses and\r\ncashmere shawls. She was surely as deserving of such an honor.\r\n\r\nMore conclusive information respecting woman as an inventor is, strange\r\nas it may appear, afforded by a systematic study of the various races of\r\nmankind which are still in a state of savagery. Such a study discloses\r\nthe interesting fact that woman, contrary to the declaration of\r\nProudhon, has not only been the inventor of the distaff, but that she\r\nhas furthermore--pace Voltaire--been the inventor of all the peaceful\r\narts of life, and the inventor, too, of the earliest forms of nearly all\r\nthe mechanical devices now in use in the world of industry.\r\n\r\nArchitecture, as well as many other things, was credited by the ancient\r\nGreeks to Minerva. This was a poetical way of stating the fact--now\r\ngenerally accepted by men of science--that women were the first\r\nhomemakers. But the first home was a very simple and a very humble\r\nstructure. When not a cave, it was a simple shelter made of bark or\r\nskins, sufficient to afford protection to the mother and her child.\r\nSubsequently it was a lodge made of earth, of stone or wattle work or\r\nadobe.\r\n\r\nWomen were, in the light of anthropology, as well as in that of\r\nmythology and tradition, the first to discover the nutritive and\r\nmedicinal values of fruits, seeds, nuts, roots and vegetables. They were\r\nconsequently the first gardeners and agriculturists and the first to\r\nbuild up a materia medica. While men were engaged in the chase or in\r\nwarfare, women were gradually perfecting those divers domestic arts\r\nwhich, in the course of time, became their recognized specialties. They\r\nsoon found that it was better to cultivate certain food plants and\r\ntrees than to depend on them for nourishment in the wild state. This was\r\nparticularly true in the case of such useful and widely distributed\r\nspecies as wheat, rice, maize, the yam, potato, banana and cassava.\r\n\r\nAt first most of these food products were used in the raw state, but\r\nwoman's quick inventive genius was not long in making one of the most\r\nimportant and far-reaching discoveries--a method for producing fire. In\r\na certain sense this was the greatest discovery ever made, and the\r\nGreeks showed their appreciation of the value of it by asserting that\r\nfire was stolen from heaven. Considering its multifarious uses in\r\nheating and cooking, thereby immensely adding to the comfort and\r\nwell-being of primitive man, we are not surprised that in certain parts\r\nof the world fire has always been considered something sacred, and that\r\nthe old Romans instituted Vestal Virgins, and the ancient Peruvians\r\nVirgins of the Sun, to preserve this precious element and have it ever\r\nready when required for sacrifice or for any of their various liturgical\r\nfunctions. If any one ever deserved a \"monument more durable than\r\nbronze,\" it was the woman who, \"on the edge of time,\" first drew the\r\nPromethean spark from a piece of pyrites by striking it with flint or\r\nproduced it by the friction of two pieces of wood.\r\n\r\nAfter building a home and establishing in it a fireplace for the\r\npreparation of food, woman's next concern was to secure more raiment\r\nthan was afforded by the traditional fig leaf. This she found in the\r\nbark of certain trees, in the fiber of hemp and cotton and in the wool\r\nof sheep and goats. With these and her distaff she spun thread, and from\r\nthe thread thus obtained she was by means of her primitive\r\nloom--likewise her invention--able to provide all kinds of textile\r\nfabrics for clothing for herself and family.\r\n\r\nBut there was much more to invent before the home of primitive man, or\r\nrather primitive woman, could be considered as fairly equipped.\r\nFurniture and culinary utensils were required, and these, too, were\r\nprovided by the deft and cunning fingers of woman. She was the first\r\npotter and the first basketmaker; and anyone who has lived among the\r\nsavages of any land, especially among the aborigines in the interior of\r\nSouth America, knows what an important part is played in domestic\r\neconomy by native basketry and ceramic ware. Both of these articles were\r\nat first of the simplest character, but woman's innate esthetic sense\r\nsoon enabled her to produce those highly ornate specimens of pottery and\r\nbasketry that are so highly prized in the public and private collections\r\nof this country and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first device for converting grain into flour was, like the many\r\nother articles already named, the invention of woman. Whether the simple\r\nmortar and pestle of the North American Indian, or the Mexican metate\r\nand muller, or the Irish quern, it was, in every case, the product of\r\nwoman's brain and handiwork, as it was also the basal prototype of our\r\nmost improved types of flouring mills. And so was the soapstone pot--the\r\npredecessor of the iron or brass kettle--a woman's invention, as well as\r\nmany similar contrivances for preparing food.\r\n\r\nBut what is probably the most remarkable culinary invention of woman in\r\nthe state of savagery is her unique contrivance for converting the\r\npoisonous root of the _manihot utilissima_--the staple food of tropical\r\nAmerica--into a wholesome and nutritious aliment. It is a bag, called\r\n_matapi_, which serves both as a press and as a sieve. For the\r\ninhabitants of the vast basins of the Amazon and the Orinoco, where the\r\nchief articles of diet are derived from the manihot and the plantain,\r\nthis invention of woman is the most important ever made and ranks in\r\nimportance with the discovery by the same skilled food purveyor of the\r\ndietetic value of manihot itself.\r\n\r\nThe first knife was a woman's invention, as the arrow-head and the spear\r\npoint were the inventions of her hunter husband. It was in the beginning\r\na most primitive implement; but, whether in the form of a simple flake\r\nof flint of obsidian, or in that of an Eskimo ulu--the woman's knife--it\r\nwas the archetype of all the forms of cutlery now in use. With this rude\r\nknife the primitive housewife skinned and carved the game brought to her\r\nby her male companion. With it she scraped the interior of the hide and\r\ncut it up into articles of clothing. She was thus the first furrier and\r\ntailor. With it she made the first sandals and moccasins, and, in doing\r\nso, became the first shoemaker and the original St. Crispin.\r\n\r\nTo woman, the originator of the first home, is due also the invention of\r\nthe oven and the chimney. She was also the first maker of salt--that\r\nall-important condiment and sanitary agent--and the first to obtain\r\nnitre from wood ashes. She was the first engineer, as is evinced in her\r\ninvention of the parbuckle and in the bamboo conduit, which was the\r\npredecessor of the great canals of Babylonia[229] and the imposing\r\naqueducts of ancient Rome.\r\n\r\nImportant, however, as are all the foregoing inventions, we must not\r\nforget what was an equally important contribution by woman to the\r\nwelfare and progress of our race--the domestication of animals. No\r\ndiscovery after that of artificially producing fire has contributed more\r\ntoward the development of our race than the taming of milk- and\r\nfleece-bearing animals, like the cow, the sheep, the goat and the llama,\r\nor of burden-bearing animals, like the horse, the ass, the camel and the\r\nreindeer, or of hunting and watching animals like the faithful,\r\nubiquitous dog. For, in the first place, the domestication of these\r\nsupremely useful animals diminished man's labor as burden bearers. It\r\nlikewise supplemented the fecundity of women and facilitated the\r\nmultiplication of the race, because it supplied to the child a\r\nnourishment that previously could be obtained only from the mother, who\r\nhad been obliged to suckle her young several years longer than was\r\nnecessary after the friendly goat and cow came to her aid. Still another\r\nconsequence of the domestication of animals was that it immensely\r\ndiminished the amount of woman's care and labor, afforded her the\r\nnecessary leisure to develop the arts of refinement, and stimulated\r\nintellectual growth in a way that otherwise would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is often stated by certain writers who love to indulge in fanciful\r\nspeculations that women inventors got their ideas as home builders and\r\nweavers and potters from nest-building birds, from web-weaving spiders,\r\nand from clay workers like termites and mud wasps. Be this as it may,\r\nthe fact remains in all its inspiring truth that, in the matter of\r\nindustrialism, as opposed to the militancy of man, we can unhesitatingly\r\ndeclare, with Virgil, _Dux femina facti_--woman was the leader in all\r\nthe arts of peace--arts which have been slowly perfected through the\r\nages until they present the extraordinary development which we now\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the splendid porcelain wares of Meissen and Sevres,\r\nor the countless varieties of cutlery produced in the factories of\r\nSheffield, or the beautiful textile fabrics from the looms of Lowell and\r\nManchester, or the delicate silks woven in the famous establishments of\r\nLombardy and Southern France, or the countless forms of footwear made in\r\nLynn and Chicago, or the exquisite furs brought from Siberia and the\r\nPribyloff Islands, and dyed in Leipsic and London, or the astonishing\r\noutput of food products from the factories of Pittsburgh and the immense\r\nroller mills of Minneapolis, we little think that the colossal wheels\r\nof these vast and varied industries were set in motion by the inventive\r\ngenius of woman in the dim and distant prehistoric past.\r\n\r\nAnd yet such is the case. Her handiwork from the earliest pottery may be\r\ntraced through its manifold stages from its first rude beginnings to the\r\nmost gorgeous creations of ceramic art. The primeval knife of flint or\r\nobsidian has become the keen tool of tempered steel; the simple distaff\r\nhas issued in the intricate Jacquard loom; the metate and pestle\r\nactuated by a woman's arm have, by a long process of evolution,\r\ndeveloped into our mammoth roller mills impelled by water power, steam\r\nor electricity.[230]\r\n\r\nBut these extraordinary changes from the rude implements of prehistoric\r\ntime to the complicated machinery of the present is but a change of\r\nkind, not one of principle. It is a change due to specialization of work\r\nwhich became possible only when men, liberated from the avocations of\r\nhunting and warfare, were able to take up the occupations of women, and\r\ndevelop them in the manner with which we are now familiar.\r\n\r\nWhy men, rather than women, should have achieved this work of\r\nspecialization; whether it was due to social causes or to woman's\r\nphysical and mental organization, or to these various factors combined,\r\nwe need not inquire; but such is the fact. Whereas in primitive times\r\nevery woman having a home was a cook, a butcher, a baker, a potter, a\r\nweaver, a cutler, a miller, a tanner, a furrier, an engineer, man, in\r\nassuming the work which was originally exclusively feminine and\r\nperformed by one and the same person, has subdivided and specialized by\r\nimproved forms of machinery and otherwise, so that what is now done is\r\naccomplished more rapidly and to better purpose, and with\r\ncorrespondingly greater results in the development of industry and in\r\nthe progress of civilization.\r\n\r\nAnd the remarkable fact is that many of the most important of these\r\nimprovements due to specialization have been made within the memory of\r\nthose yet living, while still others have been originated in quite\r\nrecent years. Nevertheless, great as has been the work of specialization\r\nand coordination in every department of human industry during the last\r\nfew decades, it is, to judge by the reports of the Patent Office, as yet\r\nin little more than its initial stage.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared for the consideration of the part woman has taken in\r\nthis specializing movement and for a discussion of her share in modern\r\ninventions and in the improvements of those manifold inventions which\r\nwere due to her genius and industry untold ages ago. Considering the\r\nshort time during which her inventive mind has been specially active,\r\nand the many handicaps which have been imposed on her, the wonder is not\r\nthat she has achieved so little in comparison with man, but rather that\r\nshe has accomplished so much.\r\n\r\nThe first woman to receive a patent in the United States was Mary Kies.\r\nIt was issued May 5, 1809, for a process of straw-weaving with silk or\r\nthread. Six years later Mary Brush was granted a patent for a corset. It\r\nseems to have been quite satisfactory, for no other patent for this\r\narticle of feminine attire was issued to a woman until 1841, when one\r\nwas granted to Elizabeth Adams. During the thirty-two years which\r\nelapsed between the issuing of a patent to Mary Kies and Elizabeth\r\nAdams, but twenty other patents were granted to women. The chief of\r\nthese were for weaving hats from grass, manufacturing moccasins,\r\nwhitening leghorn straw, for a sheet-iron shovel, a cook stove and a\r\nmachine for cutting straw and fodder.\r\n\r\nDuring the decade following 1841, fourteen patents were issued to as\r\nmany different women. Among the articles patented by them were an\r\nice-cream freezer, a weighing scale and a fan attachment for a rocking\r\nchair. It was not recorded, however, that this last invention, valuable\r\nas it was apparently, ever became particularly popular. But by far the\r\nmost remarkable of woman's inventions during this period was a submarine\r\ntelescope and lamp, for which a patent was awarded in 1845 to Sarah\r\nMather.\r\n\r\nFrom 1851 to 1861, twenty-eight patents were issued to women--just twice\r\nthe number awarded them during the preceding decade. Most of these\r\npatents were for articles of domestic use or feminine apparel. Four of\r\nthem, however, comprised a scale for instrumental music, for mounting\r\nfluid lenses, a fountain pen and an improvement in reaping and mowing\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nThe following decade is remarkable for the wonderful increase in the\r\nnumber of inventions due to women, for there was a sudden jump from\r\ntwenty-eight to four hundred and forty-one patents awarded them between\r\nthe years 1861 and 1871. Women now began to have confidence in their\r\ninventive faculties, and, no longer content with exercising their genius\r\non articles of clothing and culinary utensils, sewing, washing and\r\nchurning machines, they began to devote their attention to objects that\r\nwere entirely foreign to their ordinary home activities. This is clearly\r\nevinced by the patents they obtained for such inventions as improvements\r\nin locomotive wheels, devices for reducing straw and other fibrous\r\nsubstances for the manufacture of paper pulp, improvements in corn\r\nhuskers, low-water indicators, steam and other whistles, corn plows, a\r\nmethod of constructing screw propellers, improvements in materials for\r\npacking journals and bearings, in fire alarms, thermometers, railroad\r\ncar heaters, improvements in lubricating railway journals, in conveyors\r\nof smoke and cinders for locomotives, in pyrotechnic night signals,\r\nburglar alarms, railway car safety apparatus, in apparatus for punching\r\ncorrugated metals, desulphurizing ores and other similar inventions in\r\nthe domain of mechanical engineering, inventions that, at first blush,\r\nwould seem to be quite alien to the genius and capacity of woman.\r\n\r\nFrom now on women's inventions in the United States increased at an\r\nextraordinary rate, for from 1871 until July 1, 1888, when the first\r\ngovernment report was made on the patents issued to women inventors, she\r\nhad to her credit nearly two thousand inventions, many of which were of\r\nprime importance.[231]\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years following 1888 she was awarded twenty-five\r\nhundred and twenty-six patents--more than the total number that had been\r\ngranted her during the preceding seventy-nine years. Between 1895 and\r\n1910, three thousand six hundred and fifteen more patents were placed to\r\nher credit, making a grand total for her first century of inventive\r\nachievement of eight thousand five hundred and ninety-six patents. No\r\nPatent Office reports are available since 1910, but the number of\r\ninventions for which women have received patents since Mary Kies was\r\nawarded hers on May 5, 1809, for \"straw-weaving with silk or thread,\"\r\ncannot be far from ten thousand. This fact will, doubtless, be a\r\nrevelation to that large class of men who still seem to share the views\r\nof Voltaire and Proudhon that women are incapable of inventing even the\r\nsimplest article of domestic use.\r\n\r\nThe following story well illustrates the prevailing ignorance regarding\r\nthe part women have taken in the invention of certain articles that are\r\nso common that most people think they were never patented.\r\n\r\n\"I was out driving once with an old farmer in Vermont,\" writes Mrs. Ada\r\nC. Bowles, \"and he told me, 'You women may talk about your rights, but\r\nwhy don't you invent something?' I answered, 'Your horse's feed bag and\r\nthe shade over his head were both of them invented by women.' The old\r\nfellow was so taken aback that he was barely able to gasp, 'Do tell!'\"\r\n\r\nHad he investigated further he would have found that the flynet on his\r\nhorse's back, the tugs and other harness trimmings, the shoes on his\r\nhorse's feet[232] and the buggy seat he then occupied were all the\r\ninventions of women. He would, doubtless, also have discovered that the\r\ncurrycomb he had used before starting out on his drive, as well as the\r\nsnap hook of the halter and the checkrein and the stall unhitching\r\ndevice were likewise the inventions of members of that sex whose\r\ncapacity he was so disposed to depreciate; for women have been awarded\r\npatents--in some instances several of them--for all the articles that\r\nhave been mentioned. He might furthermore have learned that the fellies\r\nin his buggy wheels and his daughter's side saddle had been made under\r\nwomen's patents; and that, to complete his surprise and confusion, the\r\nleather used in his harness had been sewn by a machine patented by a\r\nwoman who was not only an inventor but who was also for many years the\r\nmanager and proprietor of a large harness factory in New York City.\r\n\r\nWhat particularly arrests one's attention in reading the Patent Office\r\nreports is not only the large number of inventions by women, but also\r\nthe very wide range of the devices which they embrace. It is not\r\nsurprising to find them inventing and improving culinary utensils, house\r\nfurniture and furnishings, toilet articles, wearing apparel and\r\nstationery, trunks and bags, toys and games, designs for printed and\r\ntextile fabrics, for boxes and baskets, screens, awnings, baby carriers,\r\nmusical instruments, appliances for washing and cleaning, attachments\r\nfor bicycles and type-writing machines, art, educational and medical\r\nappliances; for these things are in keeping with their proper _metier_;\r\nbut it is surprising for those who are not familiar with the history of\r\nmodern inventions to learn of the share women have had in inventing and\r\nimproving agricultural implements, building appurtenances, motors of\r\nvarious kinds, plumbing apparatus, theatrical stage mechanisms, and,\r\nabove all, countless railway appliances from a coupling or fender to an\r\napparatus for sanding railroad tracks, or a device for unloading\r\nboxcars.\r\n\r\nThose who are still of the opinion of Voltaire and Proudhon--and their\r\nname is legion--respecting woman's inventive powers, might be willing to\r\naccord to her the capacity to design a new form of clothes pin, or hair\r\ncrimper, or rouge pad, or complexion mask, or powder puff, or baby\r\njumper; but they would limit her ability to contrivances of this\r\ncharacter. But what would these same people say if they were told that\r\nover and above the things just mentioned for which many women have\r\nactually received patents, the much depreciated female sex had been\r\ngranted patents for locomotive wheels, stuffing boxes, railway car\r\nsafety apparatus, life rafts, cut-offs for hydraulic and other engines,\r\nstreet cars, mining machines, furnaces for smelting ores,\r\nsound-deadening attachments for railway cars, feed pumps and transfer\r\napparatus for traction cars, machines for driving hoops on to barrels,\r\napparatus for destroying vegetation on and removing snow from railroads,\r\ncoke crushers, artificial stone compositions, elevated railways, new\r\nforms of cattle cars, dams and reservoirs, welding seams of pipes and\r\nhardening iron, alloys for bell metal and alloys to resemble silver,\r\nmethods of refining and hardening copper, processes for concentrating\r\nores, improvement in elevators and designs for raising sunken vessels?\r\nAnd yet, incredible as it may appear to these scoffers at woman's\r\ngenius, patents for all these inventions, methods and processes--many\r\nof them of exceeding value--and for hundreds of others of a similar\r\nnature, have been issued to women during recent years. And the activity\r\nof the fair inventors, far from abating, is becoming daily more\r\npronounced, and promises to reward their efforts with far greater\r\ntriumphs. Indeed, women are becoming so active in the numerous fields of\r\ninvention--even in such unlikely ones as metallurgy and civil,\r\nmechanical and electrical engineering--that they bid fair to rival men\r\nin what they have long regarded as their peculiar specialty.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a woman in New York was granted two patents, one for a process\r\nof malting beer and the other for hooping malt liquors. These\r\ninventions, however, are not so foreign to the avocation of woman as\r\nthey at first appear. For, if we may believe the teachings of ethnology\r\nand prehistoric archaeology in this matter, women were the first brewers.\r\nThe one, therefore, who two decades ago secured the two patents just\r\nmentioned was but taking up anew an occupation in which her sex\r\nfurnished the first invention many thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nAn instructive fact touching woman's inventive achievements is that her\r\nfullest success is coincident with her enlarged opportunities for\r\neducation, and began with the breaking down of the prejudices which so\r\nlong existed against her having anything to do with the development of\r\nthe mechanical or industrial arts. When one recollects that the public\r\nschools of Boston, established in 1642, were not open to girls until a\r\ncentury and a half later, and then only for the most elementary branches\r\nand for but one-half the year; and that girls did not have the benefit\r\nof a high school education in the center of New England culture until\r\n1852; and when one furthermore recalls the attitude of the general\r\npublic toward women and girls extending their activities beyond the\r\nnursery and the kitchen, it is easy to understand that there was not\r\nmuch encouragement for them to exercise their inventive talent, even if\r\nthey had felt an inclination to do so.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Miss Margaret Knight, of Boston, who in 1871 was\r\nawarded a valuable patent for making a paper-bag machine is a case in\r\npoint and well illustrates some of the difficulties that women inventors\r\nhad to contend with only a few decades ago.\r\n\r\n\"As a child,\" she writes to a friend, \"I never cared for the things that\r\ngirls usually do; dolls never had any charms for me. I couldn't see the\r\nsense of coddling bits of porcelain with senseless faces; the only\r\nthings I wanted were a jackknife, a gimlet and pieces of wood. My\r\nfriends were horrified. I was called a tomboy, but that made very little\r\nimpression on me. I sighed sometimes because I was not like other girls,\r\nbut wisely concluded that I couldn't help it, and sought further\r\nconsolation from my tools. I was always making things for my brothers.\r\nDid they want anything in the line of playthings, they always said,\r\n'Mattie will make them for us.' I was famous for my kites, and my sleds\r\nwere the envy and admiration of all the boys in town. I'm not surprised\r\nat what I've done; I'm only sorry I couldn't have had as good a chance\r\nas a boy, and have been put to my trade regularly.\"\r\n\r\nEven after she had demonstrated her skill as an inventor, Miss Knight\r\nhad to encounter the skepticism of the workmen to whom she entrusted the\r\nmanufacture of her machines. They questioned her ability to superintend\r\nher own work, and it was only her persistency and remarkable competency\r\nthat ultimately converted their incredulity into respect and admiration.\r\n\r\nSince women have come into the possession of greater freedom than they\r\nformerly enjoyed, and have been afforded better opportunities of\r\ndeveloping their inventive faculties, many of them have taken to\r\ninvention as an occupation, and with marked success. They find it the\r\neasiest and most congenial way of earning a livelihood, and not a few\r\nof them have been able thereby to accumulate comfortable fortunes,\r\nbesides developing industries that have given employment to thousands of\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\nThus the straw industry in the United States is due to Miss Betsy\r\nMetcalf, who, more than a century ago, produced the first straw bonnet\r\never manufactured in this country. Since then the industry which this\r\nwoman originated has assumed immense proportions. The number of straw\r\nhats now made in Massachusetts alone, not to speak of those annually\r\nmanufactured elsewhere, runs into the millions.\r\n\r\nScarcely less wonderful is the industry developed by Miss Knight,\r\nalready mentioned, through her marvelous invention for manufacturing\r\nsatchel-bottom paper bags. Many men had previously essayed to solve the\r\nproblem which she attacked with such signal success, but all to no\r\npurpose. So valuable was her invention considered by experts that she\r\nrefused fifty thousand dollars for it shortly after taking out her\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nOften what are apparently the most trivial inventions prove the most\r\nlucrative. Thus, a Chicago woman receives a handsome income for her\r\ninvention of a paper pail. A woman in San Francisco invented a baby\r\ncarriage, and received fourteen thousand dollars for her patent. The\r\ngimlet-pointed screw, which was the idea of a little girl, has realized\r\nto its patentee an independent fortune. Still more remarkable is the\r\nBurden horseshoe machine, the invention of a woman, which turns out a\r\ncomplete horseshoe every three seconds and which is said to have\r\neffected a saving to the public of tens of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe cotton gin, one of the most useful and important of American\r\ninventions--a machine that effected a complete revolution in the cotton\r\nindustry throughout the world--is due to a woman, Catherine L. Greene,\r\nthe wife of General Nathaniel Greene, of Revolutionary fame. After she\r\nhad fully developed in her own mind a method for separating the cotton\r\nfrom its seed, which was after her husband's death, she intrusted the\r\nmaking of the machine to Eli Whitney, who was then boarding with her,\r\nand who had a Yankee's skill in the use of tools. Whitney was several\r\ntimes on the point of abandoning as impossible the task which had been\r\nassigned to him, but Mrs. Greene's faith in ultimate success never\r\nwavered, and, thanks to her persistence in the work and the putting into\r\nexecution of her ideas, her great undertaking was finally crowned with\r\nsuccess. She did not apply for a patent for her invention in her own\r\nname, because so opposed was public opinion to woman's having part in\r\nmechanical occupation that she would have exposed herself to general\r\nridicule and to a loss of position in society. The consequence was that\r\nWhitney--her employee--got credit for an invention which, in reality,\r\nbelonged to her. She was, however, subsequently able to retain a\r\nsubordinate interest in it through her second husband, Mr. Miller.\r\n\r\nThis is only one of many instances in which patents, taken out in the\r\nname of some man, are really due to women. The earliest development of\r\nthe mower and reaper, as well as the clover cleaner, belongs to Mrs. A.\r\nH. Manning, of Plainfield, New Jersey. The patent on the clover cleaner\r\nwas issued in the name of her husband; but, as he failed to apply for a\r\npatent for the mower and reaper, his wife was, after his death, robbed\r\nof the fruit of her brain by a neighbor, whose name appears on the list\r\nof patentees of an invention which originated with Mrs. Manning.\r\n\r\nA few years ago men of science awoke to the startling fact that the\r\nearth's supply of nitrates was being rapidly exhausted. It was then\r\nrealized that, unless some new store of this essential fertilizer could\r\nbe found, it would soon be impossible to provide the food requisite for\r\nthe world's teeming millions. What was to be done? Never was a more\r\nimportant problem presented to science for solution, and never did\r\nscience more quickly and efficaciously respond. It was soon recognized\r\nthat the earth's atmosphere was the only available storehouse for the\r\nmuch-needed nitrogen. Forthwith scientists and inventors the world over\r\nproceeded to tap this source of supply and to convert its vast stores of\r\nnitrogen into the nitrates which are so indispensable to vegetable life.\r\n\r\nTo form some idea of the importance of the problem and the urgency of\r\nits solution, it may be stated that the amount of fertilizer required\r\nfor the cotton crop alone in the Southern States in 1911 was no less\r\nthan three million tons. What, then, must have been the total amount\r\nused through the world for cereals and other crops that need constant\r\nfertilizing? The famous nitrate deposits of Chili could supply only a\r\nsmall fraction of the stupendous amount required, and they, according to\r\nrecent calculations, cannot continue to meet the present demands on them\r\nfor more than a hundred years longer, at most.\r\n\r\nThe process involved, when once conceived, was simple enough, for it\r\nmerely required the conversion of the nitrogen of the air into nitric\r\nacid, which in turn was employed in the production of nitrate of lime.\r\nBut, simple as it was, mankind had to wait a long time for its\r\norigination, and action was taken only when necessity compelled. At\r\npresent there are numerous nitrate factories in France, Germany,\r\nAustria, Sweden, Norway and the United States, and the output is already\r\nenormous and constantly increasing. Electricity, that mysterious force\r\nwhich has so frequently come to man's assistance during the last few\r\ndecades, is the agent employed.\r\n\r\nBut who was the originator of the idea of utilizing the atmosphere for\r\nthe production of nitrates? Who took out the first patent for a process\r\nfor making nitrates by using the nitrogen of the air? It was a\r\nFrenchwoman--Mme. Lefebre, of Paris--long since forgotten. As early as\r\n1859 she obtained a patent in England for her invention, but, as the\r\nneed of fertilizers was not so urgent then as it is now, it was allowed\r\nto drop into oblivion, and the matter was not again taken up until a\r\nhalf-century later, when others secured the credit for an idea which was\r\nfirst conceived by a woman who happened to have the misfortune to live\r\nfifty years in advance of her time.\r\n\r\nIt were easy to extend the list of important inventions due to women and\r\nof patents which were issued in the name of their husbands or other men;\r\nto tell of inventions, too, of whose fruits, because they happened to be\r\nhelpless or inexperienced women, the real patentees were often robbed;\r\nbut the foregoing instances are quite sufficient to show what woman's\r\nkeen inventive genius is capable of achieving in spite of all the\r\nrestrictions put on her sex, and in spite of her lack of training in the\r\nmechanic arts.\r\n\r\nHad women, since the organization of our Patent Office, enjoyed all the\r\neducational opportunities possessed by men; had they received the same\r\nencouragement as the lordly sex to develop their inventive faculties;\r\nhad the laws of the country accorded them the rewards to which their\r\nlabor and genius entitled them, they would now have far more inventions\r\nto their credit than those indicated in our government reports; and they\r\nwould, furthermore, be able to point to far more brilliant achievements\r\nthan have heretofore, under the unfavorable conditions under which they\r\nwere obliged to work, been possible. But when we recall all the\r\nobstacles they have had to overcome and remember also the fact that most\r\nof the patents referred to in the preceding pages have been secured by\r\nwomen living in the United States--little being said of the modern\r\ninventions of women in foreign countries--we can see that their record\r\nis indeed a splendid one, that their achievements are not only worthy of\r\nall praise, but also a happy augury for the future. When they shall have\r\nthe same freedom of action as men in all departments of activity in\r\nwhich they exhibit special aptitude, when they shall have the same\r\nadvantages of training and equipment and the prospect of the same\r\nemoluments as the sterner sex for the products of their brainwork and\r\ncraftsmanship, then may we expect them to achieve the same distinction\r\nin the mechanic arts as has rewarded their efforts in science and\r\nliterature; and then, too, may we hope to see them once more regain\r\nsomething of that supremacy in invention which was theirs in the early\r\nhistory of our race.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[227] \"On a vu des femmes tres savantes, comme en fut des guerrieres,\r\nmais il n'y en eut jamais d'inventrices.\" _Dictionnaire Philosophique,\r\nsub voce Femmes._ Condorcet, in commenting on this statement, remarks\r\nthat \"if men capable of invention were alone to have a place in the\r\nworld, there would be many a vacant one, even in the academies.\"\r\n\r\n[228] That marvelous structure known as the Taj Mahal--India's noblest\r\ntribute to the grace and goodness of Indian womanhood--is sometimes said\r\nto be a monument to the memory of Nur Mahal. This is not the case. This\r\nmatchless gem of architecture--\r\n\r\n    \" ... The proud passion of an emperor's love\r\n    Wrought into living stone, which gleams and soars\r\n    With body of beauty shrining soul and thought.\"\r\n\r\nis a monument to Nur Mahal's niece and successor as empress,\r\nMumtaz-Mahal--The Crown of the Palace--who, like her aunt, was a woman\r\nof rare beauty and talent and endeared herself to her people by her\r\nsplendid qualities of mind and heart.\r\n\r\n[229] The inventor of canals as well as of bridges over rivers and\r\ncauseways over morasses was, according to Greek historians, the famous\r\nAssyrian queen, Semiramis, the builder of Babylon with its wonderful\r\nhanging gardens.\r\n\r\n[230] Among the works which treat of the subject-matter of the foregoing\r\npages the reader may consult with profit, _Woman's Share in Primitive\r\nCulture_, by O. T. Mason, London, 1895; _Man and Woman_, the\r\nintroductory chapter, by Havelock Ellis, London, 1898; and _Histoire\r\nNouvelle des Arts et des Sciences_, by A. Renaud, Paris, 1878.\r\n\r\n[231] Cf. _Women Inventors to whom patents have been granted by the\r\nUnited States Government, Compiled under the Direction of the\r\nCommissioner of Patents_, Washington, 1888. See also subsequent reports\r\nof the Patent Office.\r\n\r\n[232] To one woman, Mary E. Poupard, of London, England, were granted in\r\na single year no less than three patents for horse-shoes--two of the\r\npatents being for sectional and segmental horse-shoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWOMEN AS INSPIRERS AND COLLABORATORS IN SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting literary figures of the fifth century was\r\nCaius Apollinaris Sidonius, who, after holding a number of important\r\ncivil offices, became the bishop of Clermont. The most valuable of his\r\nextant works are his nine books of letters which are a mine of\r\ninformation respecting the history of his age and the manners, customs\r\nand ideals of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn one of these letters, addressed to Hesperius, a young friend of his\r\nwho exhibited special talent in polite literature, he expresses a\r\nsentiment which applies as well to the votary of science as to the man\r\nof letters. Referring to the assistance which women had given to their\r\nhusbands and friends in their studies, he conjures him to remember that\r\nin days of old it was the wont of Martia, Terentia, Calpurnia,\r\nPudentilla and Rusticana to hold the lamp while their husbands,\r\nHortensius, Cicero, Pliny, Apuleius and Symmachus, were reading and\r\nmeditating.[233]\r\n\r\nThis picture of women as light-bearers to the great orators and\r\nphilosophers just named is symbolic of them as the helpmates and\r\ninspirers of men in every field of human activity and in every age of\r\nthe world's history. Always and everywhere, when permitted to occupy the\r\nsame social plane as men, women have been not only as lamps unto the\r\nfeet and as lights unto the paths of their male compeers in the ordinary\r\naffairs of life, but have also been their guiding stars and ministering\r\nangels in the highest spheres of intellectual effort.\r\n\r\nFor nearly fifteen centuries St. Jerome has had the gratitude of the\r\nchurch for his masterly translation, known as the Vulgate, of the Hebrew\r\nScriptures. But, had it not been for his two noble friends, Paula and\r\nEustochium, who were as eminent for their intellectual attainments as\r\nthey were for their descent from the most distinguished families of Rome\r\nand Greece, there would have been no Vulgate. For they were not only his\r\ninspirers in this colossal undertaking, but they were his active and\r\nzealous collaborators as well.\r\n\r\nDante and Petrarch are acclaimed as the morning stars of modern\r\nliterature, but both of them owed their immortality to the inspiration\r\nof two pure-minded and noble-hearted women.\r\n\r\nIn the concluding paragraph of his Vita Nuova--the most beautiful love\r\nstory ever written--Dante records his purpose to say of his inspirer,\r\nthe gentle, gracious Beatrice Portinari, \"what was never said of any\r\nwoman.\" The outcome of this exalted purpose was the Divina Commedia, the\r\nworld's greatest literary masterpiece.\r\n\r\nPetrarch, the father of humanism, is the first to give Laura de Noves\r\ncredit for his attainments as a poet. In one of his poems he sings:\r\n\r\n    \"Blest be the year, the month, the hour, the day,\r\n    The season and the time, and point of space,\r\n    And blest the beauteous country and the place\r\n    Where first of two eyes I felt the sway.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere in one of his prose dialogues with St. Augustine he declares,\r\n\"Whatever you see in me, be it little or much, is due to her; nor would\r\nI ever have attained to this measure of name and fame unless she had\r\ncherished by those most noble influences that my feeble implanting of\r\nvirtues which nature had placed in this breast.\"[234]\r\n\r\nA no less remarkable inspirer, but in an entirely different sphere of\r\nactivity, was the devout and spotless Italian maiden, Chiara Schiffi,\r\nbetter known as St. Clara. She was, as is well known, the ardent\r\ncooperator of St. Francis Assisi in his great work of social and\r\nreligious reform which has contributed so much toward the welfare of\r\nhumanity. But it is not generally known what an important part she had\r\nin this great undertaking, and how she sustained the Poverello during\r\nlong hours of trial and hardship. It was during these periods of care\r\nand struggle that we see how courageous and intrepid was \"this woman who\r\nhas always been represented as frail, emaciated, blanched like a flower\r\nof the cloister.\"\r\n\r\n\"She defended Francis not only against others but also against himself.\r\nIn those hours of dark discouragement which so often and so profoundly\r\ndisturb the noblest souls and sterilize the grandest efforts, she was\r\nbeside him to show the way. When he doubted his mission and thought of\r\nfleeing to the heights of repose and solitary prayer, it was she who\r\nshowed him the ripening harvest with no reapers to gather it in, men\r\ngoing astray with no shepherd to herd them, and drew him once again into\r\nthe train of the Galilean, into the number of those who give their\r\nlives as a ransom for many.\"[235]\r\n\r\nIt is under the shade of the olive trees of St. Damian, with his\r\nsister-friend Clara caring for him, \"that he composes his finest work,\r\nthat which Ernest Renan called the most perfect utterance of modern\r\nreligions sentiment, _The Canticle of the Sun_.\"[236]\r\n\r\nThis canticle, however, beautiful as it is, lacks, as has well been\r\nremarked, one strophe. \"If it was not upon Francis' lips, it was surely\r\nin his heart:\"\r\n\r\n    \"Be praised, Lord, for Sister Clara;\r\n    Thou hast made her silent, active, and sagacious,\r\n    And, by her, thy light shines in our hearts.\"[237]\r\n\r\nIt was through the inspiration and influence of Theodora that the famous\r\nChurch of St. Sophia, that matchless poem in marble and gold, that\r\nimperishable monument to the glory of the true God, came into existence.\r\nIt was through her that Justinian conceived the idea of those _Pandects_\r\nand _Institutes_ which constitute the greatest glory of his reign, and\r\nwhich are the basis of the _Code Napoleon_ and of all modern\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIt was to Vittoria Colonna that Michaelangelo dedicated many of the most\r\nexquisite productions of his peerless genius. \"He saw,\" as has been\r\nsaid, \"with her eyes and acted by her inspiration.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost every one of Chopin's compositions was inspired by women, and a\r\nlarge proportion of them are dedicated to them. The same may be said of\r\nMozart, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Beethoven, Weber, Schumann and other\r\nillustrious composers. All these sons of genius believed with\r\nCastiglione that \"all inspiration must come from woman;\" that she had\r\nbeen expressly created and sent into the world to inspire them with\r\nintelligence and creative power.\r\n\r\nM. Claviere declares that \"There is hardly a philosopher or a poet of\r\nthe sixteenth century whose pages are not illuminated or gladdened by\r\nthe smile of some high-born lady.\"[238]\r\n\r\nWhat the brilliant Frenchman says of the influence of woman on the poets\r\nand philosophers of a single century could with equal truth be said of\r\nthe poets and philosophers of every century from Anacreon and Plato to\r\nthe present day. And, still more, it can be predicated of woman's\r\ninspiration and influence in every department of intellectual effort, in\r\nart and architecture, in music and literature, in science in all its\r\ndepartments, whether deductive or inductive.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said, \"Were history to be rewritten, with due regard to\r\nwomen's share in it, many small causes, heretofore disregarded, would be\r\nfound fully to explain great and unlooked-for results.... For it is not\r\nin outward facts, nor great names, nor noisy deeds, nor genealogies of\r\ncrowned heads, nor in tragic loves, nor ambitious or striking heroism,\r\nnor crime, that we find proofs of the constant and secret working\r\nwhereby woman most effectually asserts herself. Certainly she has played\r\nher part in the outward and visible history of the world, but in that\r\nhistory which is told and written, which is buried in archives and\r\nrevivified in books, woman's part is always small when set beside that\r\nof her companion, man. She contributes but little, and at this she may\r\nsurely rejoice, to the tales of battles and treaties of successions and\r\nalliances, of violence, fraud, suspicions and hatreds. But if the inward\r\nhistory of human affairs could be described as fully as the outward\r\nfacts; if the story of the family could be told together with the story\r\nof the nation; if human thoughts could with certainty be divined from\r\nhuman deeds, then the chief figure in this history of sentiment and\r\nmorals would certainly be that of Woman the Inspirer.\"[239]\r\n\r\nThis same statement would hold equally good if applied to the part taken\r\nby women in the history of science. Their achievements have, in most\r\ncases, been so overshadowed by those of men that their work has been\r\nusually regarded as a negligible quantity. But when one considers the\r\nmainsprings of actions, and examines the silent undercurrents which\r\nescape the notice of the superficial observer, one finds, as in social\r\nand political history, that the most important scientific investigations\r\nare often conducted, and the most momentous discoveries are made, in\r\nconsequence of the promptings of some devoted woman friend, or in virtue\r\nof the still, small voice of a cherished wife, or sister, who prefers to\r\nremain in the background in order that all the glory of achievement may\r\nredound to the man.\r\n\r\nThere have been, it may safely be asserted, few really eminent men in\r\nscience, as there have been few really eminent men in art or letters, or\r\nin the great reform and religious movements of the world, who have not\r\nbeen assisted by some woman light-bearer, as were Hortensius by Martia,\r\nTully by Terentia and Pliny by Calpurnia. There have been few that have\r\nnot, during hours of doubt and discouragement, been sustained and\r\nstimulated as was Francis by Clara, and Jerome by Paula and Eustochium.\r\nAnd there have been still fewer who have not had, like Petrarch and\r\nDante, their Laura or their Beatrice of whom each could say:\r\n\r\n    \"This is the beacon guides to deeds of worth,\r\n    And urges me to see the glorious goal:\r\n    This bids me leave behind the vulgar throng.\"\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have had notable examples of women whose\r\nbeneficent influence and cooperation have enabled distinguished men of\r\nscience to achieve results that would otherwise have been impossible.\r\nAmong these--to mention only a few--were Mme. Lavoisier and Mme. Curie\r\nin chemistry, Mme. Lapaute and Miss Herschel in astronomy, Mrs. Agassiz\r\nand Mme. Coudreau in natural science and exploration, Mme. Schliemann\r\nand Mme. Dieulafoy in archaeology.\r\n\r\nOne of the most illustrious women inspirers of France was Catherine de\r\nParthenay, who, after attaining womanhood, became the brilliant Princess\r\nde Rohan, and was recognized as one of the most learned and most\r\nremarkable women of the sixteenth century. As a young girl she exhibited\r\nrare intelligence and displayed special aptitude for the exact sciences.\r\nFor this reason her mother saw to it that her child had the benefit of\r\ninstruction under the ablest masters that could be secured.\r\n\r\nThe most noted of these was Francois Viete, the learned French\r\nmathematician, who is justly regarded as the father of modern algebra.\r\nIn his day, especially in the higher classes of society, the education\r\ngiven to women was often more thorough than that afforded to men. For\r\nthis reason, too, women not infrequently became distinguished in\r\nastronomy, which was then usually known under the name of astrology.\r\n\r\nViete, in initiating his gifted pupil into the principles of this\r\nscience, became himself so enthusiastic a student of astronomy that he\r\ndetermined to prepare an elaborate work on the subject--something on the\r\nplan of the _Almagest_ of Ptolemy--a work which he designated\r\n_Harmonicum Celeste_.\r\n\r\nIn order that the instruction given his pupil might not be lacking in\r\nprecision, Viete wrote out, with the most scrupulous care, the lessons\r\ndesigned for her benefit. The manuscripts containing these lessons were\r\nlong preserved among the family archives, but nearly all of them were\r\nunfortunately consigned to the flames during the French Revolution in\r\n1793.\r\n\r\nNo one was more interested in Viete's mathematical researches--those\r\nresearches which have rendered him so famous in the history of\r\nscience--than was the Princess de Rohan. The former pupil was the first\r\nto receive notice of her distinguished master's discoveries and the\r\nfirst to congratulate him on his success.\r\n\r\nIt was to this cherished pupil, who always remained his friend and\r\nbenefactress, that Viete dedicated his important work on mathematical\r\nanalysis entitled _In Artem Analyticam Isagoge_. The words of the\r\ndedication are a tribute to the learning and the genius of the pupil as\r\nwell as an expression of the gratitude of the teacher. It reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"It is to you especially, august daughter of Melusine, that I am\r\nindebted for my proficiency in mathematics, to attain which I was\r\nencouraged by your love for this science, as well as your great\r\nknowledge of it, and by your mastery of all other sciences, which one\r\ncannot too much admire in a person of your noble lineage.\"[240]\r\n\r\nMore interesting, and at the same time more pathetic, were the relations\r\nof an Italian nun, Sister Maria Celeste, and the man whom Byron so\r\nhappily designates as\r\n\r\n    \"The starry Galileo, with his woes.\"\r\n\r\nSister Celeste, who was a Franciscan nun in the convent of St. Matthew,\r\nin Arcetri, was the great astronomer's eldest and favorite daughter.\r\nThey were greatly attached to each other, and the gentle religieuse was\r\nnot only her father's confidante and consoler in the hours of trial and\r\naffliction, but was also his inspirer and ever-vigilant guardian angel.\r\nShe watched over him, not as a daughter over a father, but as a mother\r\nwatches over an only son.[241]\r\n\r\nAll this is beautifully exhibited in her one hundred and twenty-four\r\nletters which were published in 1891 for the first time. A few of these\r\nletters, it is true, were published as early as 1852 by Alberi, in his\r\nedition of the complete works of Galileo, and others were given to the\r\npress at subsequent dates; but the world had to wait more than two and a\r\nhalf centuries for a complete collection of all the known letters of\r\nthis remarkable daughter of an illustrious sire.\r\n\r\nThese documents are precious for the insight they give into the sterling\r\ncharacter of a noble woman, but they are beyond price as sources of\r\ninformation respecting the tenderly affectionate relations which existed\r\nbetween her and one of the foremost men of science, not only of his own\r\nage, but of all time. They show how he made her his confidante in all\r\nhis undertakings, and how she was his amanuensis, his counselor, his\r\ninspirer; how her love was an incentive to the work that won for him\r\nundying fame; how she was his support and comfort when suffering from\r\nthe jealousy of rivals or the enmity of those who were opposed to his\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\nThese letters cover a period of nearly eleven years--the most momentous\r\nyears of her father's busy and troubled life. Now playful, quaint,\r\nelfish, then serious, vivid, confidential, they show that the writer's\r\nintelligence was as rare as her nature was loyal and affectionate. At\r\ntimes she half-apologizes for the length of a letter, \"but you must\r\nremember,\" she adds in excuse, \"that I must put into this paper\r\neverything that I should chatter to you in a week.\"\r\n\r\nNo daughter was ever prouder of her father or loved him with a more\r\nabounding love. \"I pride myself,\" she says, \"that I love and revere my\r\ndearest father more, by far, than others love their fathers, and I\r\nclearly perceive that, in return, he far surpasses the greater part of\r\nother fathers in the love which he has for me, his loved daughter.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was ill she prepared dishes and confections that she knew would\r\ntempt his appetite. But she was not satisfied with looking after the\r\nwelfare of his body, for she took occasion to send with the cakes and\r\npreserved fruits a sermonette for the benefit of his soul.\r\n\r\nAn extract from one of her letters gives an insight into the character\r\nof this devoted daughter, who, Galileo says in a letter to his friend,\r\nElia Diodati, \"was a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness and most\r\ntenderly attached to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the preserved citron you ordered,\" she writes him on the nineteenth\r\nof December, 1625, \"I have only been able to do a small quantity. I\r\nfeared the citrons were too shriveled for preserving, and so they\r\nproved. I send two baked pears for these days of vigil. But the greatest\r\ntreat of all I send you is a rose, which ought to please you extremely,\r\nseeing what a rarity it is at this season. And with the rose you must\r\naccept its thorns, which represent the bitter passion of Our Lord, while\r\nthe green leaves represent the hope we may entertain that, through the\r\nsame sacred passion, we, having passed through the darkness of this\r\nshort winter of our mortal life, may attain to the brightness and\r\nfelicity of an eternal spring in heaven, which may our gracious God\r\ngrant us through His mercy.\"[242]\r\n\r\nShe always insists upon his keeping her fully informed about his studies\r\nand discoveries. She is particular, also, about receiving without delay\r\ncopies of his latest publications. \"I beg you,\" she writes in one of her\r\nletters, \"to be so kind as to send me that book of yours which has just\r\nbeen published, _Il Saggiatore_, so that I may read it; for I have a\r\ngreat desire to see it.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, after his difficulties with the Holy Office, when\r\nshe fancies her father is not keeping her fully informed about the\r\nsubject matter of his writings, she implores him to tell her on what\r\ntopic he is engaged, \"if,\" she archly adds, \"it be something I can\r\nunderstand and you are not afraid that I will blab.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on still another occasion Sister Celeste reminds her father of a\r\npromise of his to send her a small telescope. From this we should infer\r\nthat she desired to repeat the observations on the heavenly bodies that\r\nhad created such a sensation in the learned world, and which had given\r\noccasion for such acrimonious controversy.\r\n\r\nIn one of her earlier letters Sister Celeste calls her father's\r\nattention to a promise of his to spend an afternoon with her and her\r\nsister Arcangela, also a nun in the same convent. And, referring to one\r\nof the regulations of the Franciscan cloister, she playfully observes:\r\n\"You will be able to sup in the parlor, since the excommunication is for\r\nthe table cloth\"--O Sister Celeste!--\"and not for the meats thereon.\"\r\n\r\nWhat would one not give for a stenographic report of the conversations\r\nheld that afternoon in the convent garden of Arcetri, as father and\r\ndaughters leisurely strolled through the peaceful enclosure, all quite\r\noblivious of the fleeting hours? How interesting would be a faithful\r\nrecord of the confidences exchanged at the frugal meal in the evening in\r\nthe humble parlor of S. Matteo! We would willingly exchange many of the\r\nfamous _Dialoghi di Galileo Galilei_ for a verbatim report of what\r\npassed between Sister Celeste and the father whom she so idolized.[243]\r\n\r\nJudging from her letters, she had many questions to ask him about his\r\nstudies, his experiments, his discoveries, his books, as well as about\r\nmore personal and domestic matters.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no documentary proof of the fact, yet there is every\r\nreason to believe that Galileo had taken personal charge of the\r\neducation of this, his favorite daughter. She shared his taste for\r\nscience and inherited not a little of his genius. Such being the case,\r\nwe may well believe that a faithful account of their conversations of\r\nthat day would be not only of surpassing interest, but would also throw\r\na flood of light on many questions now ill understood. They would\r\ncertainly tend to fill up the numerous lacunae caused by the\r\ndisappearance of the letters of Galileo, which he wrote in answer to\r\nthose of his ever-cherished daughter.[244]\r\n\r\nThey would also show more clearly than any facts now available what an\r\nunbounded influence the gentle nun had over the greatest intellect of\r\nhis time, and would, more clearly than anything in her correspondence,\r\nexhibit Sister Celeste as the efficient co-worker and the abiding\r\ninspirer of the father of modern physics and astronomy.\r\n\r\nBut, although we have no record of this soul-communion between father\r\nand daughter on the occasion in question; although we are deprived of\r\nthe invaluable letters which he wrote in reply to hers, we are,\r\nnevertheless, from the evidence at hand, justified in regarding this\r\nunique pair as being ever one in heart, aspirations and ideals, and\r\ncomparable in their mutual influence on each other with any of those\r\nfamous men and women who, through achievement on the one side and\r\ninspiration and collaboration on the other, have ever been recognized as\r\nthe greatest benefactors of their race.\r\n\r\nOne of Galileo's countrymen, G. B. Clemente de Nelli, was right when he\r\ndeclared that, had it not been for the assistance and consolation which\r\nhe received from Sister Celeste, Galileo would have succumbed to the\r\nblows that were showered upon him during the most trying part of his\r\ncareer. An indication of this is given in one of the letters written by\r\nSister Celeste in the last year of her life.\r\n\r\nWhile in a fit of despondency and imagining his friends had forgotten\r\nhim, Galileo, in a moment of bitterness, wrote in a letter to his\r\ndaughter: \"My name is erased from the book of the living.\" \"Nay,\" came\r\nat once Sister Celeste's cheering reply, \"say not that your name is\r\nstruck _de libro viventium_, for it is not so; neither in the greater\r\npart of the world nor in your own country. Indeed, it seems to me that,\r\nif for a brief moment your name and fame were clouded, they are now\r\nrestored to greater brightness, at which I am much astonished, for I\r\nknow that generally _Nemo propheta acceptus est in patria sua_. I am\r\nafraid, however, if I begin quoting Latin, I shall fall into some\r\nbarbarism. But, of a truth, you are loved and esteemed here more than\r\never.\"[245]\r\n\r\nHow much Sister Celeste was to her father in every way was not known\r\nuntil after her premature death in her thirty-fourth year. He was never\r\nthe same man afterward. Disconsolate and broken, he fancied he heard the\r\nvoice of the daughter he so fondly loved resounding through the house.\r\nBrooding over his great loss, the heart-broken old man writes to a\r\nfriend in words of infinite pathos, \"_Mi sento continuamente chiamare\r\ndella mia diletta figlioula_--I continually hear myself called by my\r\ndearly beloved daughter.\" The eighth of January, 1642, he answered her\r\ncall and went to join her in a better world.\r\n\r\nTwo other noted investigators, one of them a contemporary of Galileo,\r\nowed much to the inspiration and encouragement which they received from\r\nwomen. These were Descartes and Leibnitz. And the women that had the\r\nmost influence on them were representatives of royal families, who were\r\nfamous in their day for their love and knowledge and the extent of their\r\nintellectual attainments.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted of these was Elizabeth of Bohemia, Princess\r\nPalatine. She was the favorite pupil of Descartes, and it was to her\r\nthat he dedicated his great work, _Principia Philosophiae_. She, he\r\ndeclared, understood him better than any one else he had ever met, for\r\n\"in her alone were united those generally separated talents for\r\nmetaphysics and for mathematics which are so characteristically\r\noperative in the Cartesian system.\"[246]\r\n\r\nTo this earnest student who was always absorbed in the mysteries of\r\nmetaphysics and the problems of geometry, Descartes could refuse\r\nnothing. When distance separated them he continued his instructions by\r\ncorrespondence. One of the results of this correspondence was his\r\ntreatise on _Passions de l'Ame_, in which he develops certain ethical\r\nviews suggested by the _Vita Beata_ of Seneca.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished pupil of Descartes who exercised a marked\r\ninfluence over him was the celebrated daughter of Gustavus Adolphus,\r\nQueen Christine of Sweden. A mistress of many languages and an ardent\r\nvotary of science, she was a munificent patron of scientific men, a\r\ngreat number of whom she had attracted to her court. The most\r\ndistinguished of these was Descartes, to whom she was deeply attached,\r\nand with whom she had planned great things for science in Sweden, when\r\nhis career was cut short by a premature death.\r\n\r\nNot the least influence on the intellectual life of Leibnitz was Sophia\r\nCharlotte, Queen of Prussia and mother of Frederick the Great. She was\r\nthe niece of Descartes' illustrious friend, Elizabeth of Bohemia, and,\r\nas the pupil of Leibnitz, quite as gloriously associated as had been her\r\naunt with the father of Cartesianism.\r\n\r\nLeibnitz was as distinguished by genius as his royal pupil was by birth.\r\nBesides being eminent as a philosopher and a statesman, he shared with\r\nNewton the honor of discovering the calculus. Huxley pronounced him \"a\r\nman of science, in the modern sense, of the first rank,\" while the King\r\nof Prussia declared of him, \"He represents in himself a whole academy.\"\r\nThrough the cooperation of Sophia Charlotte he founded the Berlin\r\nAcademy of Sciences. For her he wrote one of the most notable of his\r\nproductions--his famed _Theodicy_.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to estimate the influence of this learned queen on\r\nLeibnitz, but it was undoubtedly greater than any other single influence\r\nwhatever. Her death was the greatest loss he ever suffered, and when she\r\nwas no more, the beautiful Berlin suburb, Charlottenburg--named after\r\nher--where he had been so happy in reading and philosophizing with his\r\nillustrious pupil, lost all attraction for him.\r\n\r\nA more striking illustration of woman's helpfulness is afforded in the\r\ncase of Francois Huber, the celebrated Swiss naturalist. Although blind\r\nfrom his seventeenth year, he was able to carry on researches requiring\r\nthe keenest eyesight and the closest observation. This he was able to do\r\nthrough the affectionate cooperation of his devoted wife, Marie Aimee.\r\n\r\nWhen her friends tried to dissuade her from marrying Huber, to whom she\r\nhad been engaged for some time, saying he had become blind, her reply\r\nwas worthy of her generous and noble nature: \"He then needs me more than\r\never.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the forty years of their married life her tenderness and devotion\r\nto her husband were as unfailing as they were inspiring. He worked\r\nthrough the eyes and hands of his wife as if they were his own. She was\r\nhis reader, his observer, his secretary, his enthusiastic collaborator\r\nin all those investigations that have rendered him so famous. The blind\r\nman devised the experiments to be made, and the quick-witted wife\r\nexecuted them and recorded the observations which supplied the material\r\nfor his epoch-making work on bees, entitled _Nouvelles Observations sur\r\nles Abeilles_. So accurate are his descriptions of the habits of the\r\nwinged creatures, to the study of which he devoted the best years of his\r\nlife, that one would think his great work was the production, not of a\r\nman who had been blind for a quarter of a century, when he wrote it, but\r\nof one who was gifted with exceptional keenness of vision and powers of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\"As long as she lived,\" exclaimed the great naturalist after his trusty\r\nAimee's death, \"I was not sensible of the misfortune of being blind.\"\r\nNay, more. During her lifetime, when, though sightless, he was always so\r\nhappy in his work, he went so far as to aver that he would be miserable\r\nwere he to recover his eyesight. \"I should not know,\" he declared, \"to\r\nwhat an extent a person in my condition could be beloved. Besides, to\r\nme, my wife is always young, fresh and pretty, which is no light\r\nmatter.\" He could truly say of her, as Wordsworth said of his sister\r\nDorothy,\r\n\r\n    \"She gave me eyes, she gave me ears,\r\n\r\n    ...*...*...*...*\r\n\r\n    And love and thought and joy.\"\r\n\r\nWe hear much of the achievements of Galvani and Faraday in the domain of\r\nelectricity and electromagnetism, but little is said of the women to\r\nwhom they were so greatly indebted for their success and fame.\r\n\r\nIt was Galvani's wife who first directed his attention to the\r\nconvulsions of a frog's leg when placed near an electrical machine. This\r\ninduced him to make those celebrated investigations which led to the\r\nfoundation of a new science which has ever since been identified with\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Marcet's works on science--especially her _Conversations on\r\nChemistry_--that inspired Faraday with a love of science and blazed for\r\nhim that road in chemical and physical experimentation which led to\r\nsuch marvelous results. He was always proud to call her his first\r\nteacher, and never hesitated to attribute to her that taste for\r\nscientific research for which he became so preeminent. And it was his\r\ndevoted wife who was not only a helpmate but a soulmate as well for\r\nnearly half a century, that had very much to do with the splendid\r\ndevelopment of the germ which had been placed in his youthful mind by\r\nMrs. Marcet.\r\n\r\nThe same may likewise be asserted of the wives of two distinguished\r\ngeologists--Charles Lyell and Xavier Hommaire de Hell. Mrs. Lyell was\r\nintimately associated with her husband in all his scientific\r\nundertakings, and her ready intellect contributed immensely toward\r\nsecuring for him that enviable position which he attained of being the\r\npremier geologist of his century. Mme. Hommaire de Hell deserves special\r\nmention in the history of geology for the invaluable assistance which\r\nshe gave her husband in the scientific exploration of the basin of the\r\nCaspian Sea. Not only did she share his labors and perils in this then\r\nwild part of the world, and collaborate with him in the preparation of\r\nthe report for which the French government conferred on him the Cross of\r\nthe Legion of Honor, but she also wrote unaided the two descriptive\r\nvolumes of their great work, _Steppes de la Mer Caspienne_. Her part of\r\nthis great undertaking received the special commendation of M.\r\nVillemain, who was the minister of public instruction, and had she not\r\nbelonged to the disenfranchized sex, she, too, would have been decorated\r\nwith the Cross of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nAll the world has heard of the daring explorations of Baker and\r\nLivingstone in the Dark Continent, but how few are aware of the\r\nimportant part taken in their great enterprises by their devoted and\r\nheroic wives? Sir Samuel Baker immortalized himself by discovering Lake\r\nAlbert Nyanza, one of the main sources of the Nile, but in attaining\r\nthis goal, which other explorers had in vain essayed to reach, he was\r\nnot alone. The companion of his triumph, as of his trials and hardships,\r\nwas Lady Baker, a woman who, although delicately reared, was as brave in\r\npresence of danger as she was resourceful in trials and difficulties.\r\nMore than once her husband owed his life to her intrepidity and presence\r\nof mind, when confronted by the treacherous savages of equatorial\r\nAfrica; and, if he achieved success where others failed, it was in no\r\nslight measure due to her tact, her energy and perseverance in what\r\nseemed at times a forlorn hope. \"She had learned Arabic with him in a\r\nyear of necessary but wearisome delay; her mind traveled with his mind\r\nas her feet had followed his footsteps.\" And, when after preliminary\r\ntoils without number, after braving dangers from climate, disease and\r\nruthless savages, they finally stood on the shore of that unknown sea\r\nwhich was then first beheld by English eyes, she could, in contemplating\r\ntheir achievements of which Albert Nyanza was the crowning glory,\r\nexclaim with exaltation and truth, \"_Quorum pars magna fui._\"\r\n\r\nWhen Livingstone lost, in the unexplored valley of the Zambesi, the\r\nfaithful wife who had been his inspiring companion in his wanderings in\r\ndarkest Africa, he lost completely that enthusiasm for deeds of high\r\nemprise that before had been one of his leading characteristics. Writing\r\nto his distinguished friend, Sir Roderick Murchison, he mournfully\r\ndeclares: \"I must confess this heavy stroke quite takes the heart out of\r\nme. Everything that has happened only made me more determined to\r\novercome all difficulties; but after this sad stroke I feel crushed and\r\nvoid of strength.... I shall do my duty still, but it is with a darkened\r\nhorizon that I again set about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe noted English naturalist, Frank Buckland, in speaking of the aid\r\nafforded by his gifted mother to her distinguished husband, Dr.\r\nBuckland, writes as follows: \"During the long period that Dr. Buckland\r\nwas engaged in writing the book which I now have the honor of editing,\r\nmy mother sat up night after night, for weeks and months consecutively,\r\nwriting to my father's dictation; and this often until the sun's rays,\r\nshining through the shutters at early morn, warned the husband to cease\r\nfrom thinking and the wife to rest her weary hand.\r\n\r\n\"Not only with the pen did she render material assistance, but her\r\nnatural talent in the use of her pencil enabled her to give accurate\r\nillustrations and finished drawings, many of which are perpetuated in\r\nDr. Buckland's works. She was also particularly clever and neat in\r\nmending broken fossils. There are many specimens in the Oxford Museum,\r\nnow exhibiting their natural forms and beauty, which were restored by\r\nher perseverance to shape from a mass of broken and almost comminuted\r\nfragments. It was her occupation also to label the specimens, which she\r\ndid in a particularly neat way; and there is hardly a fossil or a bone\r\nin the Oxford Museum which has not her handwriting upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding her devotion to her husband's pursuits, she did not\r\nneglect the education of her children, but occupied her mornings in\r\nsuperintending their instruction in sound and useful knowledge. The\r\nsterling value of her labors they now, in after life, fully appreciate,\r\nand feel most thankful that they were blessed with so good a\r\nmother.\"[247]\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the influence and cooperation of the women already\r\nnamed may, with equal truth, be affirmed of numberless others of recent\r\nas well as of earlier date. It is particularly true of the wife of the\r\nnaturalist Heller and of the great astronomer, Kepler. It is true of the\r\nwife of the illustrious mathematician, the Marquis de l'Hopital. She not\r\nonly shared her husband's talent for mathematics, but was of special\r\nassistance to him in preparing for the press his important _Analyse des\r\nInfiniment Petits_. It is true of the wife of Asaph Hall, the\r\nillustrious discoverer of the satellites of Mars. Often he was on the\r\npoint of abandoning the quest of these diminutive moons--which no one\r\nhad ever seen but which his calculations led him to believe really\r\nexisted--but he was encouraged by Mrs. Hall to continue his\r\nobservations, with the result that his labors and vigils were at last\r\nrewarded by the startling discovery of Deimos and Phobos.\r\n\r\nAnd there is Mme. Pasteur, who, in her way, was quite as important a\r\nfactor in the scientific career of her immortal husband as were the\r\nwomen just mentioned in the lives of their husbands, to whose triumphs\r\nthey so materially contributed.\r\n\r\nOne of the great Frenchman's biographers has truly declared that \"it is\r\nimpossible rightly to appreciate Pasteur's life without some\r\nunderstanding of the immense assistance which he received in his home.\r\nWhether in discussing forms of crystals, watching over experiments,\r\nshielding her husband from all the daily fret of life, or busy at the\r\ncustomary evening task of writing to his dictation, Madame Pasteur was\r\nat once his most devoted assistant and incomparable companion. His\r\nsurroundings at home were entirely subordinated to his scientific life,\r\nand his family shared with him both his trials and his triumphs. At the\r\ntime when Pasteur was engrossed with the study of anthrax, and, after\r\nmany difficulties and disappointments, had at length succeeded in\r\npreparing a vaccine against it, he at once hurried from the laboratory\r\nto communicate his great discovery first to his wife and daughter.\"[248]\r\n\r\nIt was particularly during his long and arduous researches on the\r\ndisease of silkworms that Pasteur found his wife's aid of incalculable\r\nvalue. For Mme. Pasteur and her daughter then constituted themselves\r\nveritable silkworm rearers. They collected mulberry leaves, sorted\r\nlarvae, and were unremitting in their labors during the continuance of\r\nthis memorable investigation. And not only in the silk-producing\r\ndistricts of Southern France were they thus occupied, but also in a\r\nspecial laboratory in Ecole Normale, after their return to Paris.\r\n\r\nAnd, when in the midst of these researches, on the successful outcome of\r\nwhich hinged one of the greatest sources of national wealth, the\r\nindefatigable savant was stricken with paralysis and his life was for a\r\nwhile despaired of, it was again his devoted helpmate that afforded him\r\nsolace in suffering and exercised a supervision over those experiments\r\nwhich the great man was still conducting almost in the presence of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThat Pasteur's life was prolonged for a quarter of a century after the\r\nterrible attack of hemiplegia in 1868, that he was able to unravel the\r\ndeep mysteries of microbian life, that he was able to make discoveries\r\nwhose economical value to France was, in the estimation of Professor\r\nHuxley, more than sufficient to liquidate the immense indemnity of five\r\nbillion francs exacted from his country by Germany at the termination of\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war, that he was able, especially during these\r\nfruitful twenty-five years, to render his \"scientific life like a\r\nluminous trail in the great night of the infinitely little in those\r\nultimate abysses of being where life is born,\" was, in great measure,\r\ndue to the unceasing care, the untiring vigilance and the sympathetic\r\ncollaboration of one of the most devoted of wives and most noble and\r\nwhole-souled of women.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the influence and helpfulness of Mme. Pasteur can\r\nbe asserted with even greater truth of Elizabeth Agassiz and of Caroline\r\nHerschel. For these two women, apart from the assistance they gave to a\r\nloved husband and an idolized brother, in the labors that made them so\r\nfamous, both achieved distinction for their contributions to the\r\nsciences which they individually cultivated with such splendid results.\r\nAnd had they elected to devote all their time to scientific research,\r\ninstead of giving the greater part of it to those to whom they were so\r\ndevotedly attached, who can tell how much more brilliant would have been\r\ntheir achievements and how much greater would have been the fame they\r\nwould have won for themselves. Both of them were dowered in an eminent\r\ndegree with taste and talent for science, and had they chosen to make it\r\nthe sole object of their life work, there can be no doubt that their\r\npersonal contributions to natural history and astronomy would have been\r\nfar greater than they were. As it was, they were so overshadowed by\r\nthose for whom they labored with such unselfishness and loyalty that the\r\nreal value of their work is too often forgotten when there is question\r\nof the scientific triumphs of Louis Agassiz and Sir William Herschel.\r\n\r\nBut they willed it so. They gladly effaced themselves that those whom\r\nthey loved with such a deep and abiding love might shine the more\r\nbrightly in the firmament of science. They preferred to spend and be\r\nspent in strengthening the great workers and leaders with whose lives\r\ntheir own were so thoroughly identified--\"Inspiring them with courage,\r\nkeeping faith in their own ideas alive, in days of darkness\r\n\r\n    'When all the world seems adverse to desert.'\"\r\n\r\nBoth of these noble women had the same quality in common--absolute\r\ndevotion and unswerving faith in those to whose success and happiness\r\nthey had dedicated their lives. They sought nothing for themselves, they\r\nthought nothing of themselves. They both had, to borrow the idea of\r\nanother, an intense power of sympathy, a generous love of giving\r\nthemselves to the service of others, which enabled them to transfuse the\r\nforce of their own personality into the objects to which they dedicated\r\ntheir powers.\r\n\r\nIn the preface of the joint work of Mr. and Mrs. Agassiz entitled _A\r\nJourney in Brazil_, that delightful volume which throws such a flood of\r\nlight on the fauna and flora of the Amazon valley, occur the following\r\nsignificant words regarding the share each had in producing the book:\r\n\"Our separate contributions have become so closely interwoven that we\r\nshould hardly know how to disconnect them.\" So was it with all their\r\nundertakings. There was the same common interest, the same unity of\r\npurpose, the same unselfish devotion to the cause of science during\r\nthose long years of toil which were so prolific in results of supreme\r\nimportance. Reading between the lines in _A Journey in Brazil_, and in\r\n_Louis Agassiz, His Life and Correspondence_, written by Mrs. Agassiz,\r\nwe can easily fancy that the great naturalist owed as much, if not more,\r\nto his wife's never-failing sympathy and inspiration as to her active\r\ncooperation in his work, and we are ready to apply to her the words of\r\nLongfellow when he sings:\r\n\r\n    \"And whenever the way seemed long,\r\n      Or his heart began to fail,\r\n    She would sing a more wonderful song\r\n      Or tell a more wonderful tale.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Caroline Herschel as a helper and sustainer of her illustrious\r\nbrother, too much cannot be said. \"In the days when he gave up a\r\nlucrative career that he might devote himself to astronomy, it was owing\r\nto her thrift and care that he was not harassed by the rankling\r\nvexations of money matters. She had been his helper and assistant when\r\nhe was a leading musician; she became his helper and assistant when he\r\ngave himself up to astronomy. By sheer force of will and devoted\r\naffection she learned enough of mathematics and of methods of\r\ncalculation, which to those unlearned seem mysteries, to be able to\r\ncommit to writing his researches. She became his assistant in the\r\nworkshop; she helped him to grind and polish his mirrors; she stood\r\nbeside his telescope in the nights of midwinter, to write down his\r\nobservations when the very ink was frozen in the bottle. She kept him\r\nalive by her care; thinking nothing of herself, she lived for him. She\r\nloved him and believed in him, and helped him with all her heart and\r\nwith all her strength. She might have become a distinguished woman on\r\nher own account, for with the seven-foot Newtonian sweeper given her by\r\nher brother she discovered eight comets first and last. But the pleasure\r\nof seeking and finding for herself was scarcely tested. She 'minded the\r\nheavens' for her brother; she worked for him, not for herself, and the\r\nunconscious self-denial with which she gave up 'her own pleasure in the\r\nuse of her sweeper' is not the least beautiful picture in her\r\nlife.\"[249]\r\n\r\nWhile recounting the achievements of women who directly or indirectly\r\ncontributed to our knowledge of the earth and what it contains we cannot\r\nforget what the world owes to the gracious and glorious Isabella of\r\nCastile. For it is to her probably as much as to Columbus that a new\r\ncontinent was discovered at the close of the fifteenth century. For,\r\nwhile the doctors of Salamanca--most of whom were what Galileo called\r\n\"paper philosophers,\" men who fancied that a correct knowledge of the\r\nphysical universe was to be obtained by a collation of ancient\r\ntexts--were denouncing the great navigator as an idle dreamer, and\r\nquoting the ill-founded notions of Pliny and Aristotle to prove the\r\nimpossibility of his carrying out his project, Isabella was quietly\r\nrevolving in her own mind the reasons which Columbus had adduced in\r\nfavor of his great enterprise. Having satisfied herself that his views\r\nwere sufficiently probable to justify action, she was prepared to make\r\nany sacrifices to have his plans executed. The result of her decision is\r\nbut another illustration of the value of woman's quick intuition, as\r\nagainst the slow reasoning processes of philosophers and men of science.\r\n\r\nAgain, while considering what women have accomplished for the\r\nadvancement of science by inspiration and collaboration, we must not\r\nlose sight of what they have done by suggestion. For, as John Stuart\r\nMill well observes: \"It no doubt often happens that a person who has not\r\nwidely and accurately studied the thoughts of others on a subject has by\r\nnatural sagacity a happy intuition which he can suggest but cannot\r\nprove, which yet, when matured, may be an important addition to\r\nknowledge: but, even then, no justice can be done to it until some other\r\nperson, who does possess the previous acquirements, takes it in hand,\r\ntests it, gives it a scientific or practical form, and fits it into its\r\nplace among the existing truths of philosophy or science. Is it supposed\r\nthat such felicitous thoughts do not occur to women? They occur by\r\nhundreds to every woman of intellect; but they are mostly lost for want\r\nof a husband or friend who has the other knowledge which can enable him\r\nto estimate them properly and bring them before the world; and, even\r\nwhen they are brought before it, they usually appear as his ideas, not\r\ntheir real author's. Who can tell how many of the original thoughts put\r\nforth by male writers belong to a woman by suggestion, to themselves\r\nonly by verifying and working out? If I may judge by my own case, a very\r\nlarge proportion indeed.\"[250]\r\n\r\nNor should we forget those active and energetic women--and their number\r\nis much greater than is ordinarily supposed--whose husbands, although\r\noften endowed with genius of the highest order, were indolent by\r\ntemperament and disorderly and unmethodical by nature. Such men would,\r\nin the majority of cases, have run to seed had not their genius been\r\ngiven special force and impulse by their vigorous and methodical\r\nhelpmates. Sir William Hamilton, the most learned philosopher of the\r\nScottish school, is a striking instance in point; for it was due almost\r\nentirely to the stimulation he received from his ever active wife that\r\nhe was always kept keyed up to his fullest working capacity as a\r\nphilosopher and became recognized the world over as one of the\r\ncommanding intellects of his age.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Hamilton,\" writes Professor Veitch in his _Memoir of Sir William\r\nHamilton,_ \"had a power of keeping her husband up to what he had to do.\r\nShe contended wisely against a sort of energetic indolence which\r\ncharacterized him, and which, while he was always laboring, made him apt\r\nto put aside the task actually before him, sometimes diverted by\r\nsubjects of inquiry suggested in the course of study on the matter in\r\nhand, sometimes discouraged by the difficulty of reducing to order the\r\nimmense mass of materials he had accumulated in connection with it.\r\nThen her resolution and cheerful disposition sustained and refreshed\r\nhim, and never more so than when, during the last twelve years of his\r\nlife, his bodily strength was broken and his spirit, though languid, yet\r\nceased not from mental toil. The truth is that Sir William's marriage,\r\nhis comparatively limited circumstances, and the character of his wife\r\nsupplied to a nature that would have been contented to spend its mighty\r\nenergies in work that brought no reward but in the doing of it, and that\r\nmight never have been made publicly known or available, the practical\r\nforce and impulse which enabled him to accomplish what he actually did\r\nin literature and philosophy. It was this influence, without doubt,\r\nwhich saved him from utter absorption in his world of rare, noble and\r\nelevated but ever-increasingly unattainable ideas. But for it the serene\r\nsea of abstract thought might have held him becalmed for life; and, in\r\nthe absence of all utterance of definite knowledge of his conclusions,\r\nthe world might have been left to an ignorant and mysterious wonder\r\nabout the unprofitable scholar.\"[251]\r\n\r\nWhat has been so far said, important as it is, does not tell the whole\r\nstory of woman's influence on men of science, and consequently on the\r\nprogress of science. We should not have an adequate conception of women\r\nas inspirers and collaborators if we did not advert to certain faculties\r\nwhich they usually possess in a more eminent degree than the most of\r\nmen. It is a well-known fact that in many of the affairs of life women\r\nare more practical, have more tact, and possess keener and quicker\r\nperceptions than men. They are, too, more ideal, more romantic and more\r\nenthusiastic.\r\n\r\nMen of science in their investigations usually proceed by the slow and\r\nlaborious process of collecting facts and collating phenomena, either by\r\nobservation or experiment, or both, and, from the observed facts and\r\nphenomena, they formulate a law which explains and correlates them. This\r\nis known as induction, a method which proceeds from facts to ideas.\r\n\r\nWomen, on the contrary, are rather disposed to proceed from ideas to\r\nfacts; to explain phenomena from ideas which already exist in the mind,\r\nwithout having recourse to the slow process of induction. This is the\r\ndeductive method, and is the very reverse of that employed by the\r\naverage man of science. It would, however, be a mistake to maintain that\r\nthe inductive method is always employed, for such is not the case. More\r\nthan a half a century ago the historian, Buckle, in a notable lecture\r\ndelivered in the Royal Institution of Great Britain, directed attention\r\nto the fact that some of the greatest scientific discoveries had been\r\nmade by the deductive method.\r\n\r\nOne of these was Newton's epoch-making discovery of universal\r\ngravitation. While sitting in a garden he saw an apple fall, and this\r\nsimple fact caused him to advance from idea to idea, and to be carried,\r\nby what Tyndall loved to call \"the scientific use of the imagination,\"\r\ninto the distant realms of space. And, heedless of the operations of\r\nnature, neither observing nor experimenting, the great philosopher, by\r\npure _a priori_ reasoning, \"completed the most sublime and majestic\r\nspeculation that it ever entered into the heart of man to conceive.\" \"It\r\nwas,\" as Buckle well observes, \"the triumph of an idea. It was the\r\naudacity of genius.\" It was also the triumph of the deductive method in\r\nthe solution of a problem that one not a genius could have worked out\r\nonly by the long and toilsome process of induction.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the great law of metamorphosis in plants, \"according to which\r\nthe stamens, pistils, corollas, bracts, petals and so forth, of every\r\nplant, are simply modified leaves,\" was discovered not by an inductive\r\ninvestigator, but by a poet. \"Guided by his brilliant imagination, his\r\npassion for beauty and his exquisite conception of form which supplied\r\nhim with ideas,\" Germany's greatest poet, Goethe, by reasoning\r\ndeductively, was able to generalize a law which lesser minds could never\r\nhave arrived at except through the application of the inductive method.\r\n\r\nSo also was it in the science of crystallography. Its foundations were\r\nlaid, not by a mineralogist nor a mathematician, as one would suppose,\r\nbut by one of strong imagination and marked poetic temperament. Like\r\nGoethe, Hauey was led by his ideas of beauty and symmetry to work\r\ndeductively on the problem before him. Descending from ideas to facts,\r\nhe finally succeeded, after a long series of subsequent labors, in\r\nreading \"the riddle which had baffled his able but unimaginative\r\npredecessors.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the possession of this deductive faculty, so characteristic of men\r\nof genius--their ability to reach conclusions directly, as great\r\nmathematicians perceive inferences which those less gifted reach only\r\nafter pages of elaborate calculations--which enable women, \"not indeed\r\nto make scientific discoveries, but to exercise the most momentous and\r\nsalutary influence over the method by which scientific discoveries are\r\nmade.\" For, as Buckle points out, men of science are too inclined to\r\nemploy the inductive method to the exclusion of the deductive.[252] They\r\nhave become slaves to the tyranny of facts, and, as such, are\r\nincompetent to further the progress of science as they would by using\r\nboth methods instead of one. And their slavery would be still more\r\ncomplete and ignominious were it not for the great though unconscious\r\nservice to science rendered by women who have kept alive the deductive\r\nhabit of thought. \"Their turn of thought, their habits of mind, their\r\nconversation, their influence, insensibly extending over the whole\r\nsurface of society and frequently penetrating its intimate structure,\r\nhave, more than all other things put together, tended to raise us up\r\ninto an ideal world, lift us from the dust in which we are too prone to\r\ngrovel, and develop in us those germs of imagination which even the most\r\nsluggish and apathetic understandings in some degree possess.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing observations it is manifest that the best results to\r\nscience are secured when men and women work together--men supplying the\r\nslow, logical reasoning power, women the vivid, far-reaching\r\nimagination; men generalizing from facts, women from ideas; men working\r\nchiefly by induction, women principally by deduction. For thus\r\ncollaborating, each with his or her predominant faculties, the two\r\ncombined possess in a measure the elements which go to make up a man or\r\nwoman of genius and which enable them to achieve far more for the\r\nadvancement of science than would otherwise be possible.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever given more eloquent expression to this truth than John\r\nStuart Mill, who was as keen as an observer as he was profound as a\r\nthinker. Writing on the subject under discussion, he does not hesitate\r\nto say: \"Hardly anything can be of greater value to a man of theory and\r\nspeculation who employs himself, not in collecting materials of\r\nknowledge by observation, but in working them up by processes of thought\r\ninto comprehensive truths of science and laws of conduct, than to carry\r\non his speculations in the companionship and under the criticism of a\r\nreally superior woman. There is nothing comparable to it for keeping his\r\nthoughts within the limits of real things and the actual facts of\r\nnature. A woman seldom runs wild after an abstraction.... Women's\r\nthoughts are thus as useful in giving reality to those of thinking men\r\nas men's thoughts in giving width and largeness to those of women. In\r\ndepth, as distinguished from breadth, I greatly doubt if even now women,\r\ncompared with men, are at any disadvantage.\"[253]\r\n\r\nWe have already learned, from his own avowal, how much Mill was beholden\r\nto his wife for her active cooperation in the production of those works\r\nof his which have exerted so profound an influence on many phases of\r\nmodern thought. A more striking illustration of the value of woman's\r\nassistance, but in the domain of biology, is found in the biography of\r\nthe late Professor Huxley. By those who know this distinguished man of\r\nscience--so remarkable for his intellectual vigor--only from his\r\nwritings, the impression would be gleaned that he was one of the most\r\nindependent of thinkers, and that his utterances on all subjects were\r\nabsolutely personal and entirely unmodified by suggestion or criticism\r\nfrom any quarter.\r\n\r\nHow far this view is from being correct is found in the statement by his\r\nson that his father \"invariably submitted his writings to the criticism\r\nof his wife before they were seen by any other eye. To her judgment was\r\ndue the toning down of many a passage which erred by excess of vigor,\r\nand the clearing up of phrases which would be obscure to the public. In\r\nfact, if any essay met with her approval, he felt sure it would not fail\r\nof its effect when published.\"[254] She was not only his \"help and stay\r\nfor forty years; in his struggles ready to counsel, in adversity to\r\ncomfort,\" but, over and above this, she was \"the critic whose judgment\r\nhe valued above almost any, and whose praise he cared most to win\"--the\r\nother self who made his life work possible.[255]\r\n\r\nAn intelligent, sympathetic pair of this kind--and this, as we have\r\nseen, is but one of a multitude which illuminates and beautifies the\r\nhistory of science--are competent to achieve wonders. They are like \"the\r\ntwo-celled heart beating with one full stroke\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Two plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss\r\n    Of science, and the secrets of the mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman is then truly, as De Lamennais in Scriptural phrases has it,\r\n\"Man's companion, man's assistant, bone of his bone and flesh of his\r\nflesh,\" and, in her sublime and endearing character so complete in every\r\nrelation of life, she fully answers to the beautiful characterization\r\nwhich Adam, in _Paradise Lost_, gives of his beloved Eve:\r\n\r\n                \"So absolute she seems,\r\n        And in herself complete, so well to know\r\n    Her own, that what she wills to do or say\r\n    Seems wisest, virtuosest, discreetest, best.\r\n\r\n    ...*...*...*...*\r\n\r\n    Authority and reason on her wait,\r\n\r\n    ...*...*...*...*\r\n\r\n    * * * and, to consummate all,\r\n    Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat\r\n    Build in her loveliest, and create an awe\r\n    About her, as a guard angelic plac'd.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[233] Sis oppido meminens quod olim Martia Hortensio, Terentia Tullio,\r\nCalpurnia Plinio, Pudentilla Apuleio, Rusticana Symmacho legentibus\r\nmeditantibusque candelas and candelabra tenuerunt.

How much more\r\ninteresting Dr. Johnson's incidental admission, 'I have a strong\r\ninclination, Sir, to do nothing to-day,' is to us now than many of his\r\nmore formal utterances. And, in reality, is it the personal element\r\nalone that is in the long run perennial? The wise may prate as they will\r\nabout the importance of maintaining the continuity of history and of\r\nhanding on the torch of science. The world cares for none of these\r\nthings; they interest only some few political economists and laborious\r\nmen. What does the crowd and poor little Tom Jones and his nestful, for\r\ninstance, care about the fact that Cheops was--at any rate by courteous\r\ntradition--a mighty man of valor of such an era and land? But little Tom\r\nJones and the rest of us would become mightily interested in this misty\r\nmonster of many traditions, could we learn in some magical way all he\r\nthought, hated and loved in his inmost heart of hearts.\" _The National\r\nReview_, p. 461, June, 1889.\r\n\r\n[244] The Duke of Peiresc, in a letter to Gassendi, regarding Galileo,\r\nrefers to certain letters--tres belles epistres--of the great\r\nphilosopher, \"a une sienne fille religieuse sur le sujet mesme des\r\nmatieres traictees en son dernier livre.\" This shows that Sister Celeste\r\nwas kept fully informed by her father respecting the nature and contents\r\nof his various works while he was preparing them for the press. It\r\nimplies, likewise, that she was not only interested in them in a general\r\nway, but that she was able to read them intelligently and appreciate\r\nthem as well.\r\n\r\nHow fondly Galileo treasured the letters written him by this daughter of\r\npredilection is made known to us by Sister Celeste herself, when she\r\ntells him in one of her letters \"Resto confusa sentendo ch'ella conservi\r\nle mie lettere, e dubito che il grande affeto que mi porta gliele\r\ndimonstri piu compita di quello che sono.\" Op. cit., p. 317.\r\n\r\n[245] Op. cit., p. 404.\r\n\r\n[246] In the dedication of his _Principles of Philosophy_ he addresses\r\nhis young friend and pupil in the following words: \"Je puis dire avec\r\nverite que je ne jamais rencontre que le seul esprit de votre altesse\r\nauquel l'un et l'autre\"--metaphysics and mathematics--\"fut egalement\r\nfacile; ce qui fait quo j'ai une tres juste raison de l'estimer\r\nincomparable.\"\r\n\r\n[247] _Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to Natural\r\nTheology_, by William Buckland, p. xxxvi, London, 1858.\r\n\r\n[248] _Pasteur_, by Mr. and Mrs. Percy Frankland, p. 26 et seq., London,\r\n1898. A French writer referring to this happy discovery expresses\r\nhimself as follows: \"Quand Pasteur trouva le vaccin de charbon, il\r\nremonta triomphant de son laboratoire et les larmes lui vinrent aux yeux\r\nen embrassant sa femme et sa fille auxquelles annoncait sa victoire.\"\r\n_Revue Encyclopedique_, p. 20, Jan. 15, 1895.\r\n\r\n[249] _Memoir and Correspondence of Caroline Herschel_, London, 1879,\r\npp. vi and vii, by Mrs. John Herschel. Cf. Chap. IV of this Vol.\r\n\r\n[250] _The Subjection of Women_, pp. 98, 99, London, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe idea herein expressed is beautifully accentuated in the touching\r\ndedication to the author's work On Liberty, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"To the beloved and deplored memory of her who was the inspirer, and in\r\npart the author, of all that is best in my writings--the friend and wife\r\nwhose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement, and\r\nwhose approbation was my chief reward--I dedicate this volume. Like all\r\nthat I have written for many years, it belongs as much to her as to me;\r\nbut the work as it stands has had, in a very insufficient degree, the\r\ninestimable advantage of her revision, some of the most important\r\nportions having been reserved for a more careful re-examination, which\r\nthey are now never destined to receive. Were I but capable of\r\ninterpreting to the world one-half the great thoughts and noble feelings\r\nwhich are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater\r\nbenefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything I can write,\r\nunprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe chivalrous sentiments expressed in this generous tribute by one of\r\nthe deepest thinkers of his time, to the memory of his noble and gifted\r\nlife-companion, extravagant as they may seem, are but echoes of similar\r\nsentiments often voiced before by the world's greatest leaders of\r\nthought and science.\r\n\r\n[251] _Memoir of Sir William Hamilton_, by John Veitch, p. 136 et seq.,\r\nEdinburgh, 1869.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said that women, unlike men, are indifferent to fame.\r\nThis may be true so far as they are personally concerned; but it is\r\ncertainly not true of them in regard to their husbands, or the men for\r\nwhom they have a genuine affection. This is abundantly proved by the\r\nlives of Mme. Huber, Mme. Pasteur, Caroline Herschel and Lady Hamilton,\r\nnot to name others who have been mentioned in the foregoing pages. After\r\nSir William Hamilton, at the age of fifty-six, had been stricken by\r\nhemiplegia on the right side, as the result of over-work, his faithful\r\nwife became for twelve years eyes, hands and even mind for him. She read\r\nand consulted books for him, and helped him to prepare his lectures and\r\nthe works which have given him such celebrity. \"Everything that was sent\r\nto the press and all the courses of lectures were written by her, either\r\nto dictation or from copy.\" And when we remember that the lectures and\r\nbooks were of the most abstruse character and that Lady Hamilton was\r\nassociated with her husband in his recondite work throughout his long\r\nand brilliant career, we must confess that her conduct was not only\r\nheroic to a degree, but also that the fame of the one she loved was to\r\nher a matter of the deepest concern.\r\n\r\n[252] \"Induction is, indeed, a mighty weapon laid up in the armory of\r\nthe human mind, and by its aid great deeds have been accomplished and\r\nnoble conquests have been won. But in that armory there is another\r\nweapon, I will not say of stronger make, but certainly of keener edge;\r\nand, if that weapon had been oftener used during the present and\r\npreceding century, our knowledge would be far more advanced than it\r\nactually is. If the imagination had been more cultivated, if there had\r\nbeen a closer union between the spirit of poetry and the spirit of\r\nscience, natural philosophy would have made greater progress, because\r\nnatural philosophers would have taken a higher and more successful aim,\r\nand would have enlisted on their side a wider range of human\r\nsympathies.\" Buckle: _The Influence of Women on the Progress of\r\nKnowledge_.\r\n\r\n[253] _The Subjection of Women_, ut sup., p. 87.\r\n\r\n[254] _Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley_, by his son Leonard\r\nHuxley, Vol. I, p. 324, New York, 1900.\r\n\r\n[255] Ibid., p. 39, Vol. II, p. 458.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF WOMEN IN SCIENCE:\r\n\r\nSUMMARY AND EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nSaint-Evremond, the first great master of the genteel style in French\r\nliterature, who was equally noted as a brilliant courtier, a graceful\r\nwit, a professed Epicurean, and who exerted so marked an influence on\r\nthe writings of Voltaire and the essayists of Queen Anne's time, gives\r\nus in one of his desultory productions an entertaining disquisition on\r\n_La femme qui ne se trouve point et ne se trouvera jamais_--the woman\r\nwho is not and never will be found. The caption of this singular essay\r\nadmirably expresses the idea that the majority of mankind has, even\r\nuntil the present day, held respecting woman in science. For them she\r\nwas non-existent. Nature, in their view, had disqualified her for\r\nserious and, above all, for abstract science. Never, therefore, in the\r\nopinion of these solemn wiseacres, had been found or could be found a\r\nwoman who had achieved distinction in science.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters show how ill-founded is such a view regarding\r\nwoman in times past. For that half of humanity which has produced such\r\nscientific luminaries as Aspasia, Laura Bassi, Maria Gaetana Agnesi,\r\nSophie Germain, Mary Somerville, Caroline Herschel, Sonya Kovalevsky,\r\nAgnes S. Lewis, Margaret Dunlop Gibson, Eleanor Ormerod and Mme.\r\nCurie--to mention no others--is far from exhibiting any evidence of\r\nintellectual disqualification and still farther from warranting any one\r\nfrom declaring that the successful pursuit of science is entirely\r\nbeyond the mental powers of womankind.\r\n\r\nThe preceding pages, likewise, afford an answer to those who insist on\r\nwoman's incapacity for scientific pursuits, and point to the small\r\nnumber of those that have attained eminence in any of the branches of\r\nscience; who continue to assert that the women named are but exceptions\r\nto the rule of the hopeless inferiority of their sex, and that no\r\nconclusions can be deduced from the paucity of women who have risen\r\nabove the intellectual level of their less fortunate or less highly\r\ndowered sisters. They further show that, until the last few decades,\r\nwoman's environment was rarely if ever favorable to her pursuit of\r\nscience. From the days of Aspasia until the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century she was discriminated against by law, custom and\r\npublic opinion. Save only in Italy, she was excluded from the\r\nuniversities and from learned societies in which she might have had an\r\nopportunity of developing her intellect. In other countries her social\r\nostracism in all that pertained to mental development was so complete\r\nand universal that she rarely had an opportunity of making a trial of\r\nher powers or exhibiting her innate capacity. The consequence was that\r\nher mind remained in a condition of comparative atrophy--a condition\r\nthat gave rise to that long prevalent belief in woman's intellectual\r\ninferiority to man and her natural incapacity for everything that is not\r\nlight or frivolous.\r\n\r\nPractically all that women have achieved in science, until very recent\r\nyears, has been accomplished in defiance of that conventional code which\r\ncompelled them to confine their activities to the ordinary duties of the\r\nhousehold. The lives and achievements of the eminent mathematicians,\r\nSophie Germain and Mary Somerville, are good illustrations of the truth\r\nof this assertion. It was only their persistence in the study of their\r\nfavorite branch of science, in spite of the opposition of their family\r\nand friends, and in spite of what was considered taboo for their sex by\r\nthe usages and ordinances of society, that they were able to attain that\r\neminence in the most abstruse of the sciences which won for them the\r\nplaudits of the world. Both were virtually self-made women. Deprived of\r\nthe advantages of a college or university education, and denied the\r\nstimulus afforded by membership in learned scientific associations, they\r\nnevertheless succeeded by their own unaided efforts in winning a place\r\nof highest honor in the Walhalla of men of science.\r\n\r\nM. Alphonse de Candolle, in his great work, _Histoire des Sciences et\r\ndes Savants depuis Deux Siecles_, devotes only two pages to the\r\nconsideration of woman in science. She is, to him, a negligible\r\nquantity. And, although a professed man of science, he repeats, without\r\nany scientific warrant whatever, all the gratuitous statements of his\r\npredecessors regarding the superficial character of the female mind, \"a\r\nmind,\" he will have it, which \"takes pleasure in ideas that are readily\r\nseized by a kind of intuition;\" a mind \"to which the slow methods of\r\nobservation and calculation by which truth is surely arrived at are not\r\npleasing. Truths themselves,\" the Swiss savant continues, \"independent\r\nof their nature and possible consequences--especially general truths\r\nwhich have no relation to a particular person--are of small moment to\r\nmost women. Add to this a feeble independence of opinion, a reasoning\r\nfaculty less intense than in man, and, finally, the horror of doubt,\r\nthat is, a state of mind in which all research in the sciences of\r\nobservation must begin and often end. These reasons are,\" according to\r\nde Candolle, \"more than sufficient to explain the position of women in\r\nscientific pursuits.\"[256]\r\n\r\nThey certainly are more than sufficient to explain their position if we\r\nchoose to accept the author's method of determining one's attainments in\r\nthe realm of science. His chief test of one's eminence in science is\r\nthe number of learned societies to which one belongs. For De Candolle,\r\nmembership in one or more such bodies is _prima facie_ evidence of\r\nspecial distinction in some branch of science. But \"We,\" he declares,\r\n\"do not see the name of any woman on the lists of learned men connected\r\nwith the principal academies. This is not due entirely to the fact that\r\nthe customs and regulations have made no provision for their admission,\r\nfor it is easy to assure one's self that no person of the feminine sex\r\nhas ever produced an original scientific work which has made its mark in\r\nany science and commanded the attention of specialists in science. I do\r\nnot think it has ever been considered desirable to elect a woman a\r\nmember of any of the great scientific academies with restricted\r\nmembership.\"[257]\r\n\r\nWhen De Candolle insisted on membership in learned societies as a\r\nnecessary indication of scientific eminence, he must have known, what\r\neverybody knew, that such exclusive societies as the French Academy of\r\nSciences and the Royal Society of Great Britain have always been dead\r\nset against the admission of women members. It is difficult to imagine\r\nthat the learned author of the _History of Science and Scientists_ was\r\nentirely ignorant of the exclusion from the French Academy of Maria\r\nGaetana Agnesi solely because she was a woman. And he must have been\r\naware that, had it not been for her sex, Sophie Germain would have been\r\naccorded a fauteuil in the same society for her remarkable\r\ninvestigations in one of the difficult departments of mathematical\r\nphysics. He must likewise have been cognizant of the attitude of such\r\norganizations as the Royal Society toward women, no matter how\r\nmeritorious their achievements in science.\r\n\r\nAccording to De Candolle's criterion, such women as Mme. Curie, Sonya\r\nKovalevsky, Eleanor Ormerod, Agnes S. Lewis, Margaret Dunlop Gibson have\r\naccomplished nothing worthy of note because, forsooth, their names are\r\nnot found on the rolls of membership of the Royal Society or the French\r\nAcademy of Sciences--associations whose constitutions have been\r\npurposely so framed as to exclude women from membership. It would,\r\nindeed, be difficult to instance a more unfair or a more unscientific\r\ntest of woman's eminence in science, and that, too, proposed by one who\r\nis supposed to be actuated in his judgments by rigorously scientific\r\nmethods. Had any of the women named belonged to the male sex, there\r\nnever would have been any question of their fitness to become members of\r\nthe societies in question. This is particularly true of Mme. Curie, who,\r\nin the estimation of the world, has done more to enhance the prestige of\r\nFrench science than any man of the present generation--a statement that\r\nis sufficiently justified by the fact that she is the only one so far\r\nwho has twice, in competition with the greatest of the world's men of\r\nscience, succeeded in carrying away the great Nobel prize.[258]\r\n\r\nNot only have men, from time immemorial, been wont to point to woman's\r\nincapacity for science as evidenced by the small number of those who\r\nhave achieved distinction in any of its branches, but they have also\r\ntaken a special pleasure in directing attention to the fact that no\r\nwoman has ever given to the world any of the great creations of genius,\r\nor been the prime-mover in any of the far-reaching discoveries which\r\nhave so greatly contributed to the weal, the advancement and the\r\nhappiness of our race.\r\n\r\nNo one, probably, has expressed himself on this subject in a more\r\npositive or characteristic fashion than the noted litterateur and\r\nphilosopher, Count Joseph de Maistre. Writing from St. Petersburg to his\r\ndaughter, Constance, he says: \"Voltaire, according to what you\r\naffirm--for as to me, I know nothing, as I have not read all his works,\r\nand have not read a line of them during the last thirty years--says that\r\nwomen are capable of doing all that men do, etc. This is merely a\r\ncompliment paid to some pretty woman, or, rather, it is one of the\r\nhundred thousand and thousand silly things which he said during his\r\nlifetime. The very contrary is the truth. Women have produced no _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ of any kind whatsoever. They have been the authors neither\r\nof the _Iliad_, nor the _Aeneid_, nor the _Jerusalem Delivered_, nor\r\n_Phedre_, nor _Athalie_ nor _Rodogune_, nor _The Misanthrope_, nor\r\n_Tartufe_, nor _The Joueur_, nor _The Pantheon_, nor _The Church of St.\r\nPeter's_, nor the _Venus de' Medici_, nor the _Apollo Belvidere_, nor\r\nthe _Principia_, nor the _Discourse on Universal History_, nor\r\n_Telemachus_. They have invented neither algebra nor the telescope, nor\r\nachromatic glasses nor the fire engine, nor hose-machines, etc.\"[259]\r\n\r\nAll this is true, but what does it prove? It does not prove, as is so\r\nfrequently assumed, woman's lesser brain power or inferior\r\nintelligence. It does not prove--as the learned Frenchman and those who\r\nare similarly minded would have us believe--her incapacity for the\r\nhighest flights of genius in every sphere of intellectual effort. Such\r\nassumptions are entirely negatived by woman's past achievements in all\r\ndepartments of art, literature and science.\r\n\r\nFar from making the inference that De Maistre wished his daughter to\r\ndraw from his letter, we should, from what we know of woman's ability as\r\ndisclosed in the foregoing chapters, hesitate to set a limit to her\r\npowers, or to declare apodictically that she could not have been the\r\nauthor of works of as great merit as most of those--if not all of\r\nthem--mentioned as among men's supreme achievements. The simple fact\r\nthat Mme. Curie and Sonya Kovalevsky were able, in sciences usually\r\nconsidered beyond female intelligence, to wrest from their male\r\ncompetitors the most coveted prizes within the gift of the Nobel Prize\r\nCommission and the French Academy of Sciences, demonstrates completely\r\nthat woman's assumed incapacity for even the most recondite scientific\r\npursuits is a mere figment of the masculine imagination.\r\n\r\nWhat women have done \"that at least, if nothing else,\" as John Stuart\r\nMill aptly observes, \"it is proved they can do. When we consider how\r\nsedulously they are all trained away from, instead of being trained\r\ntoward, any of the occupations or objects reserved for men, it is\r\nevident that I am taking very humble ground for them, when I rest their\r\ncase on what they have actually achieved. For, in this case, negative\r\nevidence is worth little, while any positive evidence is conclusive. It\r\ncannot be inferred to be impossible that a woman should be a Homer, or\r\nan Aristotle, or a Michaelangelo, or a Beethoven, because no woman has\r\nyet actually produced works comparable to theirs in any of those lines\r\nof excellence. This negative fact at most leaves the question uncertain\r\nand open to psychological discussion. But it is quite certain that a\r\nwoman can be a Queen Elizabeth or a Deborah or a Joan of Arc, since this\r\nis not inference but a fact.\"[260]\r\n\r\nIn like manner it is quite certain that, in spite of all kinds of\r\ndisabilities and prejudices and adverse legislation, there have been a\r\nlarge number of women who, in every department of intellectual activity,\r\nhave achieved marked distinction and won imperishable renown for their\r\nproscribed sex. It is a fact, which admits of no question, that,\r\nnotwithstanding their being debarred from all the educational advantages\r\nso generously lavished upon the dominant sex, women have since the days\r\nof Sappho and Hypatia shown themselves the equals and often the\r\nsuperiors of men in the highest and noblest spheres of mental\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, what, we may ask, would have been the result had\r\nwomen, from that splendid Heroic Period of which Homer sings until the\r\npresent, enjoyed all the opportunities of mental development of which\r\nmen have systematically claimed the exclusive privilege?[261] What would\r\nnow be their condition if, from the days of the Muses--who were but\r\nlearned women apotheosized--women had never been deprived of their\r\nintellectual birthright and had been permitted to continue in the path\r\nso auspiciously blazed by Corinna--the victor over Pindar--and Arete,\r\nthe splendor of Greece and the possessor of the mind of Socrates and the\r\ntongue of Homer? What would not now be their intellectual\r\nefflorescence, if Plato's dream of twenty-three centuries ago of giving\r\nwomen equal rights with men in all things of the mind could have been\r\nrealized; if those ardent female disciples of his, who so lovingly\r\nfollowed him through the streets of Athens--\"the home of the\r\nintellectual and the beautiful\"--and hung on his lips during his\r\nmatchless discourses in the groves of the Academy and on the banks of\r\nthe Ilyssus, could have continued that race of intellect and genius\r\nwhich was the admiration and the inspiration of all Hellas during the\r\nmost brilliant period of its marvelous history?\r\n\r\nSpeculating only on what the gifted daughters of Greece might have\r\nachieved, we may easily believe that they would have kept pace with\r\ntheir most highly gifted countrymen, and that, following in the\r\nfootsteps of Sappho and the other Muses of the \"Terrestrial Nine,\" they\r\nwould have been worthy rivals of Homer, Pindar and Aeschylus, and would\r\nhave occupied a prominent place in that brilliant galaxy of genius\r\ncomposed of such luminaries as Anaxagoras, Sophocles, Euclid,\r\nArchimedes, Theophrastus, Polygnotus, Diophantus, Pausanias and\r\nThucydides.\r\n\r\nTo those who base their opinions on what so long has been the absurdly\r\nanomalous condition of women and who, in formulating their theories of\r\nhuman progress, completely ignore the fundamental laws of heredity, such\r\nconjectures will seem extravagant, if not chimerical. But, when one\r\nbears in mind the universal fact that offspring, whatever the sex,\r\ninherits its characteristics and its powers from both parents alike;\r\nthat the soul, unlike the body, has no sex, and that, so far as\r\nlegitimate indications from the teachings of biology and psychology can\r\nserve as a guide, there is no valid reason for asserting the mental\r\nsuperiority of man over woman, one will be obliged to confess that these\r\nsurmises are far from being either fanciful or preposterous.\r\n\r\nIt is then the veriest sophism to predicate woman's incapacity for\r\nscience and for intellectual achievements of the highest order on what\r\nshe has not accomplished in the past, or on the comparatively limited\r\nnumber of her contributions to the advancement of knowledge; for up till\r\nthe present she has, for the most part, been but a dwarf of the\r\ngynaeceum,\r\n\r\n    \"Cramp'd under worse than South-sea isle taboo.\"\r\n\r\nHad men been compelled to labor under similar conditions, it is doubtful\r\nif they would have accomplished any more than women have now to their\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nConsidering woman's past achievements in science, as well as in other\r\ndepartments of knowledge; considering her present opportunities for\r\ndeveloping her long-hampered faculties, and considering, especially, the\r\nmany new social and economic adjustments which have been made within the\r\nlast half century, in consequence of the greatly changed conditions of\r\nmodern life, it requires no prophetic vision to forecast what share the\r\ngentler sex will have in the future advancement of science. That it will\r\nbe far greater than it has been hitherto there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt. That the number of savantes of the type of Maria Gaetana Agnesi,\r\nSonya Kovalevsky and Mme. Curie will be greatly enlarged there is every\r\nreason to believe. That among these coming votaries of science there\r\nwill be more than one woman who, even in the most abstruse sciences,\r\nwill stand\r\n\r\n    \"Upon an even pedestal with man,\"\r\n\r\nseems to be assured by the achievements of many who are now so\r\nmaterially adding to the sum of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nIs it probable that the future will bring forth women whose achievements\r\nin science will rank with those of Euler, Faraday, Liebig, Leverrier,\r\nChampollion and Geoffry Saint-Hillaire? It would be a rash man who would\r\nanswer in the negative. We cannot, as De Maistre seems to do, reason\r\nfrom what they have not done--when everything was against them--to what\r\nthey may do when conditions shall, in every way, be as favorable to them\r\nas they always have been to the dominant sex.\r\n\r\nStill rasher would be the man who would attempt to prove the negative of\r\nthis question. Mere _a priori_ arguments, based on preconceived bias or\r\non the vague and groundless impression that woman is essentially and\r\nhopelessly the intellectual inferior of man, have no more value than\r\ngratuitous opinions. The unprejudiced seeker after truth will insist on\r\na demonstration based on incontrovertible facts. He will appeal to\r\nhistory to learn what the sex has already accomplished, and to science\r\nto inquire if there be anything in the female brain to differentiate it\r\nfrom that of the male, or to preclude woman from attaining the highest\r\nrank in the activities of the intellect.\r\n\r\nThe result of such an investigation will, I think, cause even the most\r\nbiased person to suspend judgment, if it does not induce him to align\r\nhimself with those who, finding no differences in the mental endowments\r\nof the sexes, have reached the conclusion that the day will come, and,\r\nmayhap, in the near future, when the achievements of women will be on a\r\npar with those of man. The facts stated in the preceding chapters seem,\r\nnot unreasonably, to point to such a conclusion, if, indeed, they do not\r\nwarrant it as a necessary inference.\r\n\r\nA few considerations germane to this discussion will illustrate the\r\ndanger of forming hasty judgments regarding questions like the one under\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nDuring the last hundred years no country in the world has done more for\r\nthe education of the masses than the United States. Everything that\r\nmoney could purchase and ingenuity suggest has been adopted to develop\r\nthe minds and stimulate the latent talents and genius of our youth. From\r\nthe primary schools to the highest and best equipped universities, a\r\nspecial premium has been put on success in study, and the highest\r\nrewards have awaited those who should make any notable contribution\r\ntowards the advancement of knowledge. But, notwithstanding all the\r\neducational advantages our people have enjoyed and all the encouragement\r\nthey have received to achieve something of supreme excellence, our great\r\ncountry with its teeming millions attracted from the most gifted nations\r\nof the Old World has not yet produced a single man who has attained the\r\nhighest rank in either literature or art or science. Far from having a\r\npreeminent master of song like Homer or Dante, we have not even a poet\r\napproaching Goethe or Tasso or Camoens. We have no Cervantes, no Milton,\r\nno Racine, no Moliere. America has produced no Raphael or Michaelangelo;\r\nno Mozart or Wagner or Tschaikovsky. Nor has it given us a Descartes, a\r\nLeibnitz, a Newton or a Darwin. Would any one, from this complete\r\nabsence in America of representatives of the highest order in\r\nliterature, art and science, ever dream of concluding that we shall\r\nnever have such favorite sons of genius and such giants of intellect?\r\nDoes our comparative intellectual sterility in the past, and in a\r\ncountry which seemed specially adapted to foster genius and attainments\r\nof the highest order, justify any one in inferring that the days of\r\ngreat geniuses, like the days of demigods, are gone never to return?\r\n\r\nAnd yet the number of men in our broad commonwealth who, during the past\r\nhundred years, have enjoyed such signal opportunities for attaining\r\ndistinction in every domain of intellectual effort is incomparably\r\ngreater than that of all the women so favored since the earliest days of\r\nhuman history. If, from the first flowering of Greek culture to the\r\npresent day, as many millions of women had enjoyed all the transcendent\r\nadvantages of education as have been in the United States so lavishly\r\naccorded to the same number of millions of men, who will say that very\r\nmany of them would not have attained a much higher rank in science, as\r\nwell as in art and literature, than has yet been reached by any man that\r\nAmerica has yet produced? Who even, on the evidence now available, would\r\nbe warranted in denying that at least some of these millions of women\r\nmight have attained the very highest rank in every department of\r\nintellectual achievement?\r\n\r\nGray, in his _Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard_, muses on the\r\npotential statesmen and the \"mute, inglorious Miltons\" of those\r\ncountless multitudes who, for lack of opportunity to develop their\r\ninborn gifts, were condemned to pass their lives in obscurity and die,\r\n\"to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\" But how much more truthfully could his\r\nwords have been applied to that much larger number of women of rare\r\nmental powers to whose eyes knowledge\r\n\r\n                                \"Her ample page\r\n    Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll,\"\r\n\r\nand whose God-given genius was ruthlessly suppressed from the cradle to\r\nthe grave?\r\n\r\nWe are still in ignorance as to many of the conditions which are\r\nessential to the development of genius and which contribute to its\r\nloftiest flights. We have yet to learn how far the efflorescence of the\r\nhuman mind is aided and modified by heredity, environment, atmosphere,\r\nas well as by education, encouragement and other stimuli equally potent.\r\n\r\nBut we do know that Germany, in spite of its famed universities and its\r\nfeverish intellectual activity in many departments of knowledge, had to\r\nwait many long dreary centuries before it could point to a Goethe, a\r\nSchiller, a Humboldt, a Bach, or a Beethoven. We know that France--so\r\nlong the reputed center of culture--has so far produced no great epic\r\npoet, no Cervantes, no Murillo. But shall we affirm that she will never\r\ngive to the world imperishable works like _Paradise Lost_, _Don Quixote_\r\nor the _Immaculate Conception_? We know that Athens, which during the\r\nmost brilliant period of its history counted only fifty-four hundred\r\nfree-born citizens--less than the population of a small modern town--was\r\nable to produce within a very brief epoch more men of supreme\r\ndistinction than all the rest of Europe from the Age of Pericles until\r\nthe dawn of the Renaissance. Hers is still the art of the world, the\r\nliterature of the world, the philosophy of the world, the culture of the\r\nworld. For twenty-five centuries her canons of taste and beauty have\r\nguided poets, orators, artists; and her matchless productions have been\r\nthe inspiration, as they have been the despair, of the greatest geniuses\r\nof our modern world.\r\n\r\nHad the women of Greece not been put under constraint just as they were\r\nbeginning to exhibit the splendid results of their intellectual\r\nactivities; had they been encouraged to develop to the utmost their\r\nrichly-dowered minds, as were the men, a far larger number of them, no\r\ndoubt, would have been as successful in carrying off coveted prizes in\r\nthe intellectual arena as was Corinna in her contests with Pindar. And\r\nthey would, likewise, as we may easily conceive, have greatly added to\r\nthe number of masterpieces of Greek intellect in science as well as in\r\nart and letters.\r\n\r\nBut the opportunity for women to test their powers, which was so\r\nwantonly snatched from their sisters in the Hellenic world, seems again\r\nto be offered to their sex. This opportunity, as has been stated, is due\r\nchiefly to their persistence in claiming the same right as men to\r\nintellectual development as well as to the countless proofs they have\r\ngiven that their demands are founded on reason and justice. What shall\r\nbe the outcome of the new opportunity for woman to prove her capacity as\r\ncompared with man's in things of the intellect remains to be seen, but,\r\nfrom indications she has during recent years given of her powers in\r\nevery branch of scientific inquiry, there can be little doubt that it\r\nwill be of such character as to place woman on a higher intellectual\r\nplane than she has yet occupied. In physical strength and in the rougher\r\nconflicts with the world she will doubtless always remain \"the lesser\r\nman,\" but, once she feels in full possession of liberty\r\n\r\n          \"To burgeon out of all\r\n    Within her,\"\r\n\r\nshe will duly justify her advocates who throughout the centuries have\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n    \"Maintaining that with equal husbandry\r\n    The woman were an equal to the man.\"\r\n\r\nNot the least of the contributing factors to woman's intellectual\r\ngrowth, and especially to her future achievements in science, are the\r\nrecent adjustments for women in social and economical conditions brought\r\nabout chiefly by far-reaching changes in the industrial world. Even so\r\nlate as the last half of the nineteenth century the energies of women,\r\nwhen they were not engaged in the kitchen or the nursery, were spent on\r\nthe domestic loom, spinning wheel and the knitting needle. All the\r\nvarious processes from carding the wool to making it into clothing for\r\nall the members of the family were in the hands of the housewife.\r\nReady-made clothing was far from being as common and inexpensive as it\r\nis now. Canned foods and cereals, which do away with so much of the\r\ndrudgery of the kitchen, were unknown. Electricity, which has proved to\r\nbe such a remarkable aid in every modern home, was little more than a\r\nmysterious force that was utilized in the electric telegraph. Most of\r\nthe domestic labor-saving machines were still in their infancy and\r\npossessed by but few people. Large fortunes were confined to only a\r\nfavored few in our great metropolises. The mass of the people was\r\npreoccupied with the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nBut science, the spirit of invention and the advent of the age of\r\nmachinery have completely changed the conditions of life which obtained\r\nbut a generation ago. They have not only opened up for women countless\r\noccupations that were undreamed of in their mother's time, but have also\r\ngiven to tens of thousands of them the necessary means and leisure to\r\nindulge their tastes for study and research and enabled an ever\r\nincreasing number of them to realize their aspirations for achieving\r\ndistinction in the divers departments of scientific research.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of this marked change in the intellectual activity of\r\nwomen, we need only consider what an important part they now take in our\r\npresent prodigious literary output, as compared with their share in\r\nsimilar work but a few decades ago. As authors, as writers and readers\r\nin the editorial rooms of our leading periodicals, as contributors to\r\nlearned journals and reviews dealing with every branch of science, even\r\nthe most abstruse, they now occupy a conspicuous place and are doing\r\nwork that is quite as creditable as that of men.\r\n\r\nAnd it is no longer necessary, in deference to public sentiment, for\r\nthem to write under a pseudonym, for it is no longer considered\r\nunfeminine, as it was in the time of the Bronte sisters, for women to\r\nacknowledge themselves the authors of books or of articles in magazines.\r\nIf they elect to devote their lives to literary or scientific work, they\r\nwill not be deterred from so doing by what Mrs. Grundy may say, or by\r\nthe fear that some feeble imitator of Moliere may dub them as\r\n_Precieuses Ridicules_. The value of their productions, like those of\r\nmen, is gauged solely by merit and not by any narrow-minded\r\nconsiderations of the author's sex.\r\n\r\nSo also will it be in all other occupations where women choose to gain\r\ntheir livelihood by devoting themselves to scientific pursuits rather\r\nthan to manual labor or to secretarial work in the counting-room. There\r\nare positions open for them in colleges, universities and the\r\ngovernment service where, as professors or experts in every branch of\r\nscience, their talents have full liberty of action and where they have\r\nthe same opportunity of achieving distinction in their chosen life-work\r\nas have their male colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn Germany there are to-day a million more women than men. It is the\r\nsame in England. In France the number of women who are widows or\r\nunmarried or divorcees or mothers with full-grown children aggregates no\r\nless than four and a half millions. A similar condition obtains in other\r\nparts of Europe. A large percentage of this number is without home ties\r\nand, as the old fields of labor are no longer open to women, they are\r\nforced to find new ones. They naturally demand the privilege of\r\nexercising their talents in occupations which are most congenial to\r\nthem. Many have no inclination for any of the avocations in the\r\nindustrial or commercial world, but have a very decided inclination as\r\nwell as talent for scientific pursuits. Hence the ever-increasing number\r\nof women who seek employment in chemical and biological laboratories, in\r\nmuseums and astronomical observatories, as well as aspire to\r\nprofessorships of science in schools and colleges. From this large\r\nnumber of votaries of science some are sure to achieve distinction in\r\ntheir calling and to contribute materially to the advancement of\r\nknowledge. In the course of time the number of those, like Mme. Curie,\r\nMme. Coudreau, Mary Kingsley, Sonya Kovalevsky, Eleanor Ormerod,\r\nCaroline Herschel, Zelia Nuttall, Harriet Boyd Hawes, Donna Eersilia\r\nBovatillo, Sophie Pereyaslawewa--to name only a few--who will become\r\nprominent as chemists, explorers, naturalists, mathematicians,\r\nentomologists, astronomers, archaeologists, biologists will be vastly\r\nincreased, for women will find a greater stimulus for such work and more\r\nnumerous demands for their service in the constantly expanding sphere of\r\nscientific research.\r\n\r\nMany women will, doubtless, become specialists in some specific branch\r\nof science, particularly if they have a genuine love for it, or be fired\r\nby an ambition to achieve fame as discoverers. But it is not probable\r\nthat they will ever specialize to the same extent as men do. For men\r\nscientific work has to a large extent become a _metier_, and success, as\r\nin industry, depends on a division of labor. Hence it is that their\r\nfield of investigation is daily becoming more and more circumscribed.\r\nThis is observable in all the sciences, but especially in such\r\nall-embracing sciences as chemistry, biology, and archaeology. A man now\r\ndoes well if he master a single branch of any of these sciences, and is\r\nhailed as exceptionally fortunate if he succeed in making some notable\r\ndiscovery in his limited field of research. So great, indeed, has been\r\nthe activity of scientific men in every department of science during the\r\nlast half century, and so thoroughly have they explored the most hidden\r\nrecesses of nature, that it, at times, seems as if there were but little\r\nleft to discover. A prominent scientist recently well expressed the\r\ndifficulty of making any striking additions to our knowledge of nature\r\nby asserting that all great discoveries would hereafter be made in the\r\nsixth place of decimals. This statement is well illustrated by the\r\ndelicate experiments that were required to isolate such rare elements as\r\nradium, polonium, helium and neon, which occur only in infinitesimal\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nWhile men of science will be forced to continue as specialists as long\r\nas the love of fame, to consider no other motives of research, continues\r\nto be a potent influence in their investigations, it is probable that\r\nwomen will have less love for the long and tedious processes involved in\r\nthe more difficult kinds of specialization. They will, it seems likely,\r\nbe more inclined to acquire a general knowledge of the whole circle of\r\nthe sciences--a knowledge that will enable them to take a comprehensive\r\nsurvey of nature. And it will be fortunate for themselves, as well as\r\nfor the men who must perforce remain specialists, if they elect to do\r\nso. For nothing gives falser views of nature as a whole, nothing more\r\nunfits the mind for a proper apprehension of higher and more important\r\ntruths, nothing more incapacitates one for the enjoyment of the\r\nmasterpieces of literature or the sweeter amenities of life, than the\r\nnarrow occupation of a specialist who sees nothing in the universe but\r\nelectrons, microbes and protozoa.\r\n\r\nBut just at the critical moment, when men of science would rather\r\ndiscover a process than a law, when they are so preoccupied with the\r\ninfinitely little that they lose sight of the cosmos as a whole; when\r\ntheir attention is so riveted on particular phenomena that they will no\r\nlonger have aptitude for rising from effects to causes; when they cease\r\nto have any interest in general ideas and stray away from the guidance\r\nof the true philosophic spirit; when, like Plato's cave men, they have\r\nso long groped in darkness that their powers of vision are impaired,\r\nthen it is that woman, \"The herald of a brighter race,\" comes to the\r\nrescue and holds up to their astonished gaze the picture of an ideal\r\nworld whose existence they had almost forgotten. For women, as a rule,\r\nlove science for its own sake, and, unlike the specialists in question,\r\nthey are, in its pursuit, rarely actuated by any selfish or mercenary\r\ninterests, or by the hope of financial reward. Precise and never-ending\r\nobservations with the microscope and spectroscope, which at best give\r\nthem but a superficial knowledge of certain details of science, while it\r\nleaves them in ignorance of the greater and better part of it, do not\r\nappeal to them. They prefer general ideas to particular facts, and love\r\nto roam over the whole realm of science rather than confine themselves\r\nto one of its isolated corners.\r\n\r\n\"Women,\" writes M. Etienne Lamy, the distinguished French Academician,\r\n\"group themselves at the center of human knowledge, whereas men disperse\r\nthemselves towards its outer boundaries. While men are always pushing\r\nanalysis to its utmost limits, women are seeking a synthesis. While men\r\nare becoming more technical, women are becoming more intellectual. They\r\nare better placed to observe the correlations of the different sciences,\r\nand to subordinate them to the common and unique source of truth from\r\nwhich they all descend. We seem, indeed, to be approaching a time when\r\nwomen will become the conservers of general ideas.\"[262]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter reference was made to the fact that women are\r\nnaturally inclined to adopt the deductive method in their search for\r\ntruth when men would employ only the inductive method. This disposition\r\nof theirs to arrive at conclusions by a kind of intuition, coupled with\r\ntheir more pronounced idealism, is sure to react favorably on men, and\r\nprevent them from becoming so involved in mere facts and phenomena as to\r\ncause them to forget that it is as important to reason well as to\r\nobserve well--that the fundamental principles of a true philosophy are\r\nquite as necessary for the eminent man of science as they are to the\r\ntrustworthy historian or commanding statesman.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it is clear that man's ideal of the woman of\r\nthe future will be quite different from what it was but a little more\r\nthan a century ago, when Dr. Johnson could say that \"any acquaintance\r\nwith books,\" among women, \"was distinguished only to be censured.\" It\r\nwill be quite different from the ideal woman, as portrayed by poets and\r\nnovelists, for centuries past. For among the thousands of women painted\r\nby our leading writers of fiction, poets and dramatists there are few,\r\nif any, outside of those sketched by Tennyson in _The Princess_, who are\r\ndistinguished for their learning or for their love of intellectual\r\npursuits. Even Portia, Shakespeare's most learned woman, was, according\r\nto her own confession, but\r\n\r\n    \"An unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpracticed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the heroines of the novelist, far from being women who had a thirst\r\nfor knowledge, or were eager\r\n\r\n                    \"To sound the abyss\r\n    Of science and the secrets of the mind,\"\r\n\r\nwere those only whose chief attractions were physical graces and charms,\r\naffectionate natures, brilliant wit together with \"sweet laughs for\r\nbird-notes and blue eyes for a heaven.\"\r\n\r\nNow, however, that women after ages of struggle are beginning to\r\nexperience a sense of intellectual freedom before unknown, and to exult\r\nin the fact that\r\n\r\n    \"Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed\";\r\n\r\nnow that they are, for the first time, beginning, in every civilized\r\nnation, to realize their age-long aspirations for unimpeded opportunity\r\nin all the activities of the intellect; now that they are no longer\r\n\r\n                  \"Dismiss'd in shame to live\r\n    No wiser than their mothers, household stuff,\r\n    Live chattels, ***\r\n    *** laughing-stocks of Time,\"\r\n\r\nwe may expect soon to see a marked change in the character of the ideal\r\nwoman as depicted in literature and as desired by the intelligent\r\nportion of mankind.\r\n\r\nWhat woman's liberation from intellectual bondage and her freedom to\r\ndevote herself to scientific pursuits mean for the future of humanity it\r\nis difficult at present adequately to forecast. That it will contribute\r\nimmensely to the betterment of social conditions and to the elevation of\r\nthe masses of humanity, there can be no doubt. Setting free the\r\nimprisoned energies of one half of our race, means more than doubling\r\nmankind's capacity for advancement. For the failure to utilize woman's\r\nvast energies, pining for an outlet, acted as a drag on man's own\r\npotentialities, and thus retarded to an untold extent the world's\r\nadvancement. In times past, as has aptly been said, \"an enormous part of\r\nthe brain power of mankind has been spent or wasted in smiting the\r\nPhilistines hip and thigh, and an enormous part of the brain power of\r\nwomankind has been spent in cajoling Sampson.\"\r\n\r\nIt will mean that the women of the future will be more suitable\r\ncompanions for the rapidly increasing number of highly educated men of\r\nscience; that having their intellects developed _pari passu_ with those\r\nof men, they will be able to sympathize with the noblest aims of their\r\nhusbands and assist them in their most important undertakings, as did\r\nthe wives of Huber, Lavoisier, Pasteur, Huxley, Louis Agassiz and others\r\nscarcely less renowned in the annals of science. It will mean that they\r\nwill not only share in the joys and the sorrows of their\r\nlife-companions, but that they will also have a part in their thoughts,\r\ntheir studies, their labors, their achievements. For one should bear in\r\nmind that the first essential to a perfect union of hearts is a perfect\r\nharmony of minds. Where neither husband nor wife is educated, the\r\nvirtues may suffice for companionship, but where the man is educated and\r\nthe woman ignorant, there are sooner or later estrangements and the wife\r\nbecomes little better than an old Japanese conception of her, \"a cook\r\nwithout pay,\" or a pasha's toy for an idle hour. Chrysalde in Moliere's\r\n_L'Ecole des Femmes_, declares:\r\n\r\n    \"Qu'il est assez ennuyeux, que je crois,\r\n    D'avoir toute sa vie une bete avec soi.\"\r\n\r\nA briefer and truer statement of the evils of unequal intellectual\r\nmating was never penned.[263] Men of intelligence are no longer, like\r\nRousseau, satisfied with an ignorant domestic for a wife, and still less\r\nare they disposed with Schopenhauer to regard woman as an incurable\r\nPhilistine, and as a mere intermediary between a child and a man. They\r\nhave learned by sad experience that it is contrary both to justice and\r\npublic policy to impose artificial restrictions on the acquisition of\r\nknowledge by women, or to close to the vigorous and capable\r\nrepresentatives of their sex careers which are open to the weakest and\r\nmost incompetent men. History has taught them that the fall of Greece\r\nand Rome was owing to the failure of these nations to make due provision\r\nfor the mental development of women.\r\n\r\nAnd women know that it was because of the inability of the wives of the\r\nAthenians to enter into the thoughts of their highly educated husbands\r\nand to sympathize with their aims and appreciate their achievements that\r\ncaused the men to leave them in their solitude and seek in the\r\ncompanionship of the hetaerae the intellectual atmosphere which was\r\nwanting in their own homes. They know, too, that the lack of knowledge\r\nin the wife and the absence of virtue in the hetaerae, which brought such\r\ndisasters on the most learned and most cultured of nations are still\r\nevils to be guarded against, and that one of the means over and above\r\nmoral rule and revealed truth of safe-guarding their own interests and\r\npreserving the sanctity of the home is to make themselves by knowledge\r\nand culture the intellectual equals of their consorts.\r\n\r\nThey realize also that if they are to attain the highest measure of\r\nsuccess as wives and mothers, a broad and thorough education--a\r\nknowledge of science, as well as familiarity with art and literature and\r\nthe teachings of religion--is essential to them for their children's\r\nsake. It is said that\r\n\r\n    \"The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world,\"\r\n\r\nbut how much truer is it that \"The domestic hearth is the first of\r\nschools, and the best of lecture-rooms; for here the heart will\r\ncooperate with the mind, the affections with the reasoning power.\" It is\r\nonly when the mothers of this, the woman's century, shall dispute with\r\nmen the primacy of erudition--when they shall prove their mastery of\r\nthose newer sciences by which our age sets such great store--when they\r\nshall possess\r\n\r\n    \"Seraphic intellect and force\r\n        To seize and throw the doubts of man\";\r\n\r\nthat their grown-up sons will have the same confidence in their\r\nintelligence as they now have in their hearts. Then only will mothers be\r\nproperly equipped for developing the character of their children; for\r\ninspiring them with a love of the true, the beautiful and the good; for\r\nstimulating their talents and aiding them to attain to all the\r\nsublimities of knowledge; for assisting them in doubt and despondency\r\nand firing them with an ambition to strive for supreme excellence in all\r\nthat makes for the nobility of manhood and the glory of womanhood; for\r\nmaking them, as Beatrice made Dante after he was renewed and purified\r\nin the waters of Eunoe, \"fit to mount up to the stars.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_Puro e disposto a salire alle stelle._\"\r\n\r\nThe romantic idea of treating woman as a clinging vine, and thus\r\neliminating half the energies of humanity, is rapidly disappearing and\r\ngiving place to the idea that the strong are for the strong--the\r\nintellectually strong; that the evolution of the race will be complete\r\nonly when men and women shall be associated in perfect unity of purpose,\r\nand shall, in fullest sympathy, collaborate for the attainment of the\r\nhighest and the best. Then, indeed, will man's helpmate become to him\r\nand to his children\r\n\r\n    \"More rich than pearls of Ind or gold of Ophir,\r\n    And in her sex more wonderful and rare.\"\r\n\r\nThen will men and women for the first time fully supplement each other\r\nin their aspirations and endeavors and realize somewhat of that oneness\r\nof heart and mind which was so beautifully adumbrated in Plato's\r\nandrogyn. Then will the world witness the return of another Golden\r\nAge--the Golden Age of Science--the Golden Age of cultured, noble,\r\nperfect womanhood. Then to all who really think and love will be\r\nmanifest the clearness and power of vision of England's great poet\r\nlaureate when in matchless numbers he sings:\r\n\r\n    \"The woman's cause is man's; they rise or sink\r\n    Together, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free.\r\n\r\n    ...*...*...*...*\r\n\r\n    For woman is not undevelopt man\r\n    But diverse: could we make her as the man,\r\n    Sweet Love were slain; his dearest bond is this,\r\n    Not like to like, but like in difference.\r\n    Yet in the long years liker must they grow;\r\n    The man be more of woman, she of man;\r\n    He gain in sweetness and in moral height,\r\n    Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;\r\n    She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,\r\n    Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;\r\n    Till at the last she set herself to man,\r\n    Like perfect music unto noble words;\r\n    And as these twain, upon the skirts of Time,\r\n    Sit side by side, full-summ'd in all their powers,\r\n    Dispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,\r\n    Self-rev'rent each, and reverencing each,\r\n    Distinct in individualities,\r\n    But like each other ev'n as those who love,\r\n    Then comes the statelier Eden back to men;\r\n    Then reign the world's great bridals chaste and calm;\r\n    Then springs the crowning race of human-kind.\r\n    May these things be!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[256] _Histoire des Sciences et des Savants_, p. 271, Geneve-Bale, 1885.\r\n\r\n[257] Ibid., p. 270.\r\n\r\n[258] A writer in the English magazine, _Nature_, under date of January\r\n12, 1911, when the European press was discussing Mme. Curie's claims to\r\nmembership in the French Academy of Sciences, makes the following sane\r\nobservations on the admission of women to the various academies of the\r\nFrench Institute:\r\n\r\n     \"There may be room for difference of opinion as to the\r\n     wisdom or expediency of permitting women to embark on the\r\n     troubled sea of politics, or of allowing them a determinate\r\n     voice in the settlement of questions which may affect the\r\n     existence or the destiny of a nation; but surely there ought\r\n     to be no question that in the peaceful walks of art,\r\n     literature and science, there should be the freest possible\r\n     scope extended to them, and that, as human beings, every\r\n     avenue to distinction and success should unreservedly be\r\n     open to them.\r\n\r\n     \"All academies tend to be conservative and to move slowly;\r\n     they are the homes of privilege and of vested interest. Some\r\n     of them incline to be reactionary. They were created by men\r\n     for men and for the most part at a time when women played\r\n     little or no part in those occupations which such societies\r\n     were intended to foster and develop. But the times have\r\n     changed. Women have gradually won for themselves their\r\n     rightful position as human beings. We have now to recognize\r\n     that academies as seats of learning were made for humanity\r\n     and that, as members of the human race, women have the right\r\n     to look upon their heritage and property no less than men.\r\n     This consummation may not at once be reached, but, as it is\r\n     based upon reason and justice, it is certain to be attained\r\n     eventually.\"\r\n\r\nA fortnight later the same magazine contained a second article, in which\r\nthe matter is treated in an equally manly fashion.\r\n\r\n\"As scientific work,\" the writer pertinently observes, \"must ultimately\r\nbe judged by its merits, and not by the nationality or sex of its\r\nauthor, we believe that the opposition to the election of women into\r\nscientific societies will soon be seen to be unjust and detrimental to\r\nthe progress of natural knowledge. By no pedantic reasoning can the\r\nrejection of a candidate for membership of a scientific society be\r\njustified, if the work done places the candidate in the leading position\r\namong other competitors. Science knows no nationality and should\r\nrecognize no distinction of sex, color or creed among those who are\r\ncontributing to its advancement. Believing that this is the conclusion\r\nto which consideration of the question must inevitably lead, we have\r\nconfidence that the doors of all scientific societies will eventually be\r\nopen to women on equal terms with men.\"\r\n\r\n[259] _Lettres et Opuscules Inedits du Comte Joseph de Maistre_, Tom. I,\r\np. 194, Paris, 1851.\r\n\r\nIt was this same brusque and original writer who asserted that \"science\r\nwas a most dangerous thing for women; that no woman should study science\r\nunder penalty of becoming ridiculous and unhappy; that a coquette can\r\nmore readily get married than a savante.\" And he it was who declared\r\nthat women who attempted to emulate men in the pursuit of science are\r\nmonkeys and _donne barbute_--bearded women--and who designated Mme. de\r\nStael as \"_la science en jupons, une impertinente femelette_\"--science\r\nin petticoats, a silly, impertinent female.\r\n\r\nHe, however, met an opponent worthy of his steel in the person of the\r\neloquent bishop of Orleans, Mgr. Dupanloup. In a lengthy and brilliant\r\ncritique of De Maistre's views he shows them to be untenable, if not\r\nridiculous. \"I by no means,\" he writes, \"agree with M. de Maistre that\r\n'_la science en jupons_,' as he calls it, or talents of any kind\r\nwhatsoever, militates in the slightest against a woman being a good wife\r\nor a good mother. Quite the contrary.\" And considering woman as the\r\ncompanion and aid of man--_socia et adjutorium_--he expresses a view\r\nwhich is quite the opposite of that championed by his distinguished\r\nadversary for, in words precise and pregnant, he asserts that the\r\neducation of women cannot be too consistent, too serious, and too\r\nsolid--\"_L'education des femmes ne saurait etre trop suivie, trop\r\nserieuse et trop forte._\" _La Femme Studieuse_, p. 160, Paris, 1895.\r\n\r\n[260] _The Subjection of Women_, p. 81, London, 1909.\r\n\r\n[261] The late Mr. Gladstone asserts that \"It would be hard to discover\r\nany period of history or country of the world, not being Christian, in\r\nwhich they\"--women--\"stood so high as with the Greeks of the Heroic\r\nAge\"--when the position of the Greek woman was so remarkable and \"so\r\nelevated, both absolutely and in comparison with what it became in the\r\nHistoric Ages of Greece and Rome amidst their elaborate civilization.\"\r\n_Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age_, Vol. II, p. 479 et seq., Oxford,\r\n1858. Cf. also the same author's _Juventus Mundi_, p. 405 et seq.,\r\nLondon, 1869.\r\n\r\n[262] _La Femme de Demain_, pp. 45, 46, Paris, 1912.\r\n\r\n[263] Dr. Johnson expressed the same sentiment when he declared that a\r\nman of sense should meet a suitable companion in a wife. \"It was a\r\nmiserable thing,\" he asserted in characteristic fashion, \"when the\r\nconversation could only be such as whether the mutton should be boiled\r\nor roasted, and a probable dispute about that.\"\r\n\r\nSidney Smith, in a forceful and trenchant essay _On the Education of\r\nWomen_, written for the _Edinburgh Review_ a century ago, gives it as\r\nhis deliberate opinion that \"The instruction of women improves the stock\r\nof natural talents, and employs more minds for the instruction and\r\namusement of the world; it increases the pleasures of society by\r\nmultiplying the topics upon which the two sexes take a common interest;\r\nand makes marriage an intercourse of understanding as well as of\r\naffection by giving dignity and importance to the female character. The\r\neducation of women favors public morals; it provides for every season of\r\nlife as well as for the brightest and the best; and leaves a woman when\r\nshe is stricken by the hand of time, not as she now is, destitute of\r\neverything and neglected by all, but with the full power and the\r\nsplendid attractions of knowledge,--diffusing the elegant pleasures of\r\npolite literature, and receiving the just homage of learned and\r\naccomplished men.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the oft repeated commonplace of noodledom that higher education\r\nputs an end to domestic economy and deteriorates the noblest qualities\r\nof womanhood, the same clear-headed writer asks: \"Can anything ... be\r\nmore perfectly absurd than to suppose that the care and perpetual\r\nsolicitude which a mother feels for her children, depends upon her\r\nignorance of Greek or mathematics; and that she would desert an infant\r\nfor a quadratic equation--that Cimmerian ignorance can aid parental\r\naffection, or the circle of the arts and sciences produce its\r\ndestruction--that the moment you suffer women to eat of the tree of\r\nknowledge the rest of the family will very soon be reduced to the same\r\nkind of aerial and unsatisfactory diet?\"\r\n\r\nStill more insistent on the necessity of the broadest and deepest\r\neducation for woman--education in science as well as in art and\r\nliterature--is the Most Rev. Archbishop, J. L. Spalding, who by his\r\nwriting and lectures has done so much for the cause of the higher\r\neducation of both men and women. In an eloquent and pregnant discourse,\r\npronounced in the Church of the Gesu in Rome, in March, 1900, he told\r\nhis vast audience--composed of the elite of the Eternal City--that:\r\n\r\n\"If we are to have a race of enlightened, noble, and brave men, we must\r\ngive to woman the best education it is possible for her to receive. She\r\nhas the same right as man to become all that she may be, to know\r\nwhatever may be known, to do whatever is fair and just and good. In\r\nsouls there is no sex. If we leave half the race in ignorance, how shall\r\nwe hope to lift the other half into the light of truth and love? Let\r\nwoman's mental power increase, let her influence grow, and more and more\r\nshe will stand by the side of man as a helper in all his struggles to\r\nmake the will of God prevail. From the time the Virgin Mother held the\r\nInfant Saviour in her arms, to this hour, woman has been the great lover\r\nof Christ and the unweary helper of His little ones; and the more we\r\nstrengthen and illumine her, the more we add to her sublime faith and\r\ndevotion the power of knowledge and culture, the more efficaciously\r\nshall she work to purify life, to make justice, temperance, chastity,\r\nand love prevail. She is more unselfish, more capable of enthusiasm for\r\nspiritual ends, she has more sympathy with what is beautiful, noble, and\r\ngodlike than man; and the more her knowledge increases, the more shall\r\nshe become a heavenly force to help spread God's kingdom on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nPARTIAL LIST OF THE WORKS QUOTED OR REFERRED TO IN THE TEXT\r\n\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ, MRS.
