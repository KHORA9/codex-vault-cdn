Huxley\r\n\r\n\r\n1863\r\n\r\n\r\n[entire page is illustration with caption as follows]\r\n\r\nSkeletons of the GIBBON. ORANG. CHIMPANZEE. GORILLA. MAN.\r\n'Photographically reduced from Diagrams of the natural size (except\r\nthat of the Gibbon, which was twice as large as nature), drawn by Mr.\r\nWaterhouse Hawkins from specimens in the Museum of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE MAN-LIKE APES\r\n\r\nAncient traditions, when tested by the severe processes of modern\r\ninvestigation, commonly enough fade away into mere dreams: but it is\r\nsingular how often the dream turns out to have been a half-waking one,\r\npresaging a reality. Ovid foreshadowed the discoveries of the geologist:\r\nthe Atlantis was an imagination, but Columbus found a western world: and\r\nthough the quaint forms of Centaurs and Satyrs have an existence only\r\nin the realms of art, creatures approaching man more nearly than they\r\nin essential structure, and yet as thoroughly brutal as the goat's\r\nor horse's half of the mythical compound, are now not only known, but\r\nnotorious.\r\n\r\nI have not met with any notice of one of these MAN-LIKE APES of earlier\r\ndate than that contained in Pigafetta's 'Description of the Kingdom\r\nof Congo,' [1] drawn up from the notes of a Portuguese sailor, Eduardo\r\nLopez, and published in 1598. The tenth chapter of this work is entitled\r\n\"De Animalibus quae in hac provincia reperiuntur,\" and contains a brief\r\npassage to the effect that \"in the Songan country, on the banks of the\r\nZaire, there are multitudes of apes, which afford great delight to the\r\nnobles by imitating human gestures.\" As this might apply to almost any\r\nkind of apes, I should have thought little of it, had not the brothers\r\nDe Bry, whose engravings illustrate the work, thought fit, in their\r\neleventh 'Argumentum,' to figure two of these \"Simiae magnatum\r\ndeliciae.\" So much of the plate as contains these apes is faithfully\r\ncopied in the woodcut (Fig. 1), and it will be observed that they\r\nare tail-less, long-armed, and large-eared; and about the size of\r\nChimpanzees.\r\n\r\nIt may be that these apes are as much figments of the imagination of the\r\ningenious brothers as the winged, two-legged, crocodile-headed dragon\r\nwhich adorns the same plate; or, on the other hand, it may be that the\r\nartists have constructed their drawings from some essentially faithful\r\ndescription of a Gorilla or a Chimpanzee. And, in either case, though\r\nthese figures are worth a passing notice, the oldest trustworthy and\r\ndefinite accounts of any animal of this kind date from the 17th century,\r\nand are due to an Englishman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SIMIAE MAGNATUM DELICIAE.--De Bry, 1598.]\r\n\r\nThe first edition of that most amusing old book, 'Purchas his\r\nPilgrimage,' was published in 1613, and therein are to be found many\r\nreferences to the statements of one whom Purchas terms \"Andrew Battell\r\n(my neere neighbour, dwelling at Leigh in Essex) who served under Manuel\r\nSilvera Perera, Governor under the King of Spaine, at his city of Saint\r\nPaul, and with him went farre into the countrey of Angola\"; and again,\r\n\"my friend, Andrew Battle, who lived in the kingdom of Congo many\r\nyeares,\" and who, \"upon some quarell betwixt the Portugals (among whom\r\nhe was a sergeant of a band) and him, lived eight or nine moneths in\r\nthe woodes.\" From this weather-beaten old soldier, Purchas was amazed\r\nto hear \"of a kinde of Great Apes, if they might so bee termed, of the\r\nheight of a man, but twice as bigge in feature of their limmes, with\r\nstrength proportionable, hairie all over, otherwise altogether like\r\nmen and women in their whole bodily shape. [2] They lived on such wilde\r\nfruits as the trees and woods yielded, and in the night time lodged on\r\nthe trees.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract is, however, less detailed and clear in its statements\r\nthan a passage in the third chapter of the second part of another\r\nwork--'Purchas his Pilgrimes,' published in 1625, by the same\r\nauthor--which has been often, though hardly ever quite rightly, cited.\r\nThe chapter is entitled, \"The strange adventures of Andrew Battell,\r\nof Leigh in Essex, sent by the Portugals prisoner to Angola, who lived\r\nthere and in the adjoining regions neere eighteene yeeres.\" And the\r\nsixth section of this chapter is headed--\"Of the Provinces of Bongo,\r\nCalongo, Mayombe, Manikesocke, Motimbas: of the Ape Monster Pongo, their\r\nhunting: Idolatries; and divers other observations.\"\r\n\r\n\"This province (Calongo) toward the east bordereth upon Bongo, and\r\ntoward the north upon Mayombe, which is nineteen leagues from Longo\r\nalong the coast.\r\n\r\n\"This province of Mayombe is all woods and groves, so over-growne that\r\na man may travaile twentie days in the shadow without any sunne or heat.\r\nHere is no kind of corne nor graine, so that the people liveth onely\r\nupon plantanes and roots of sundrie sorts, very good; and nuts; nor any\r\nkinde of tame cattell, nor hens.\r\n\r\n\"But they have great store of elephant's flesh, which they greatly\r\nesteeme, and many kinds of wild beasts; and great store of fish. Here is\r\na great sandy bay, two leagues to the northward of Cape Negro, [3] which\r\nis the port of Mayombe. Sometimes the Portugals lade logwood in this\r\nbay. Here is a great river, called Banna: in the winter it hath no\r\nbarre, because the generall winds cause a great sea. But when the sunne\r\nhath his south declination, then a boat may goe in; for then it is\r\nsmooth because of the raine. This river is very great, and hath many\r\nilands and people dwelling in them. The woods are so covered with\r\nbaboones, monkies, apes and parrots, that it will feare any man to\r\ntravaile in them alone. Here are also two kinds of monsters, which are\r\ncommon in these woods, and very dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest of these two monsters is called Pongo in their language,\r\nand the lesser is called Engeco. This Pongo is in all proportion like a\r\nman; but that he is more like a giant in stature than a man; for he is\r\nvery tall, and hath a man's face, hollow-eyed, with long haire upon his\r\nbrowes. His face and eares are without haire, and his hands also. His\r\nbodie is full of haire, but not very thicke; and it is of a dunnish\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n\"He differeth not from a man but in his legs; for they have no calfe.\r\nHee goeth alwaies upon his legs, and carrieth his hands clasped in the\r\nnape of his necke when he goeth upon the ground. They sleepe in the\r\ntrees, and build shelters for the raine. They feed upon fruit that they\r\nfind in the woods, and upon nuts, for they eate no kind of flesh. They\r\ncannot speake, and have no understanding more than a beast. The people\r\nof the countrie, when they travaile in the woods make fires where they\r\nsleepe in the night; and in the morning when they are gone, the Pongoes\r\nwill come and sit about the fire till it goeth out; for they have no\r\nunderstanding to lay the wood together. They goe many together and kill\r\nmany negroes that travaile in the woods. Many times they fall upon the\r\nelephants which come to feed where they be, and so beate them with their\r\nclubbed fists, and pieces of wood, that they will runne roaring away\r\nfrom them. Those Pongoes are never taken alive because they are so\r\nstrong, that ten men cannot hold one of them; but yet they take many of\r\ntheir young ones with poisoned arrowes.\r\n\r\n\"The young Pongo hangeth on his mother's belly with his hands fast\r\nclasped about her, so that when the countrie people kill any of the\r\nfemales they take the young one, which hangeth fast upon his mother.\r\n\r\n\"When they die among themselves, they cover the dead with great heaps of\r\nboughs and wood, which is commonly found in the forest.\" [4]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear difficult to identify the exact region of which\r\nBattell speaks. Longo is doubtless the name of the place usually spelled\r\nLoango on our maps. Mayombe still lies some nineteen leagues northward\r\nfrom Loango, along the coast; and Cilongo or Kilonga, Manikesocke, and\r\nMotimbas are yet registered by geographers. The Cape Negro of Battell,\r\nhowever, cannot be the modern Cape Negro in 16 degrees S., since Loango\r\nitself is in 4 degrees S. latitude. On the other hand, the \"great river\r\ncalled Banna\" corresponds very well with the \"Camma\" and \"Fernand Vas,\"\r\nof modern geographers, which form a great delta on this part of the\r\nAfrican coast.\r\n\r\nNow this \"Camma\" country is situated about a degree and a-half south of\r\nthe Equator, while a few miles to the north of the line lies the Gaboon,\r\nand a degree or so north of that, the Money River--both well known to\r\nmodern naturalists as localities where the largest of man-like Apes\r\nhas been obtained. Moreover, at the present day, the word Engeco, or\r\nN'schego, is applied by the natives of these regions to the smaller of\r\nthe two great Apes which inhabit them; so that there can be no rational\r\ndoubt that Andrew Battell spoke of that which he knew of his own\r\nknowledge, or, at any rate, by immediate report from the natives of\r\nWestern Africa. The \"Engeco,\" however, is that \"other monster\" whose\r\nnature Battell \"forgot to relate,\" while the name \"Pongo\"--applied\r\nto the animal whose characters and habits are so fully and carefully\r\ndescribed--seems to have died out, at least in its primitive form and\r\nsignification. Indeed, there is evidence that not only in Battell's\r\ntime, but up to a very recent date, it was used in a totally different\r\nsense from that in which he employs it.\r\n\r\nFor example, the second chapter of Purchas' work, which I have just\r\nquoted, contains \"A Description and Historicall Declaration of the\r\nGolden Kingdom of Guinea, etc. etc. Translated from the Dutch, and\r\ncompared also with the Latin,\" wherein it is stated (p. 986) that--\r\n\r\n\"The River Gaboon lyeth about fifteen miles northward from Rio de Angra,\r\nand eight miles northward from Cape de Lope Gonsalves (Cape Lopez),\r\nand is right under the Equinoctial line, about fifteene miles from St.\r\nThomas, and is a great land, well and easily to be knowne. At the mouth\r\nof the river there lieth a sand, three or foure fathoms deepe, whereon\r\nit beateth mightily with the streame which runneth out of the river into\r\nthe sea. This river, in the mouth thereof, is at least four miles broad;\r\nbut when you are about the Iland called 'Pongo', it is not above two\r\nmiles broad.... On both sides the river there standeth many trees....\r\nThe Iland called 'Pongo', which hath a monstrous high hill.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 2.--The Orang of Tulpius, 1641.]\r\n\r\nThe French naval officers, whose letters are appended to the late M.\r\nIsidore Geoff. Saint Hilaire's excellent essay on the Gorilla [5], note\r\nin similar terms the width of the Gaboon, the trees that line its banks\r\ndown to the water's edge, and the strong current that sets out of it.\r\nThey describe two islands in its estuary;--one low, called Perroquet;\r\nthe other high, presenting three conical hills, called Coniquet; and\r\none of them, M. Franquet, expressly states that, formerly, the Chief of\r\nConiquet was called 'Meni-Pongo', meaning thereby Lord of 'Pongo'; and\r\nthat the 'N'Pongues' (as, in agreement with Dr. Savage, he affirms\r\nthe natives call themselves) term the estuary of the Gaboon itself\r\n'N'Pongo'.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy, in dealing with savages, to misunderstand their\r\napplications of words to things, that one is at first inclined to\r\nsuspect Battell of having confounded the name of this region, where his\r\n\"greater monster\" still abounds, with the name of the animal itself. But\r\nhe is so right about other matters (including the name of the \"lesser\r\nmonster\") that one is loth to suspect the old traveller of error; and,\r\non the other hand, we shall find that a voyager of a hundred years'\r\nlater date speaks of the name \"Boggoe,\" as applied to a great Ape, by\r\nthe inhabitants of quite another part of Africa--Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nBut I must leave this question to be settled by philologers and\r\ntravellers; and I should hardly have dwelt so long upon it except for\r\nthe curious part played by this word 'Pongo'in the later history of the\r\nman-like Apes.\r\n\r\nThe generation which succeeded Battell saw the first of the man-like\r\nApes which was ever brought to Europe, or, at any rate, whose visit\r\nfound a historian. In the third book of Tulpius' 'Observationes\r\nMedicae', published in 1641, the 56th chapter or section is devoted to\r\nwhat he calls 'Satyrus indicus', \"called by the Indians Orang-autang or\r\nMan-of-the-Woods, and by the Africans Quoias Morrou.\" He gives a very\r\ngood figure, evidently from the life, of the specimen of this animal,\r\n\"nostra memoria ex Angola delatum,\" presented to Frederick Henry Prince\r\nof Orange. Tulpius says it was as big as a child of three years old, and\r\nas stout as one of six years: and that its back was covered with black\r\nhair. It is plainly a young Chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the existence of other, Asiatic, man-like Apes became\r\nknown, but at first in a very mythical fashion. Thus Bontius (1658)\r\ngives an altogether fabulous and ridiculous account and figure of an\r\nanimal which he calls \"Orang-outang\"; and though he says \"vidi Ego cujus\r\neffigiem hic exhibeo,\" the said effigies (see Fig. 6 for Hoppius' copy\r\nof it) is nothing but a very hairy woman of rather comely aspect, and\r\nwith proportions and feet wholly human. The judicious English anatomist,\r\nTyson, was justified in saying of this description by Bontius, \"I\r\nconfess I do mistrust the whole representation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to the last mentioned writer, and his coadjutor Cowper, that we\r\nowe the first account of a man-like ape which has any pretensions\r\nto scientific accuracy and completeness. The treatise entitled,\r\n\"'Orang-outang, sive Homo Sylvestris'; or the Anatomy of a Pygmie\r\ncompared with that of a 'Monkey', an 'Ape', and a 'Man',\" published by\r\nthe Royal Society in 1699, is, indeed, a work of remarkable merit, and\r\nhas, in some respects, served as a model to subsequent inquirers. This\r\n\"Pygmie,\" Tyson tells us \"was brought from Angola, in Africa; but was\r\nfirst taken a great deal higher up the country\"; its hair \"was of a\r\ncoal-black colour and strait,\" and \"when it went as a quadruped on all\r\nfour, 'twas awkwardly; not placing the palm of the hand flat to the\r\nground, but it walk'd upon its knuckles, as I observed it to do when\r\nweak and had not strength enough to support its body.\"--\"From the top\r\nof the head to the heel of the foot, in a strait line, it measured\r\ntwenty-six inches.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 3 and 4.--The 'Pygmie' reduced from Tyson's figures\r\n1 and 2, 1699.]\r\n\r\nThese characters, even without Tyson's good figures (Figs. 3 and\r\n4), would have been sufficient to prove his \"Pygmie\" to be a young\r\nChimpanzee. But the opportunity of examining the skeleton of the very\r\nanimal Tyson anatomised having most unexpectedly presented itself to\r\nme, I am able to bear independent testimony to its being a veritable\r\n'Troglodytes niger' [6], though still very young. Although fully\r\nappreciating the resemblances between his Pygmie and Man, Tyson by no\r\nmeans overlooked the differences between the two, and he concludes his\r\nmemoir by summing up first, the points in which \"the Ourang-outang or\r\nPygmie more resembled a Man than Apes and Monkeys do,\" under forty-seven\r\ndistinct heads; and then giving, in thirty-four similar brief\r\nparagraphs, the respects in which \"the Ourang-outang or Pygmie differ'd\r\nfrom a Man and resembled more the Ape and Monkey kind.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a careful survey of the literature of the subject extant in\r\nhis time, our author arrives at the conclusion that his \"Pygmie\" is\r\nidentical neither with the Orangs of Tulpius and Bontius, nor with the\r\nQuoias Morrou of Dapper (or rather of Tulpius), the Barris of d'Arcos,\r\nnor with the Pongo of Battell; but that it is a species of ape probably\r\nidentical with the Pygmies of the Ancients, and, says Tyson, though it\r\n\"does so much resemble a 'Man' in many of its parts, more than any of\r\nthe ape kind, or any other 'animal' in the world, that I know of: yet by\r\nno means do I look upon it as the product of a 'mixt' generation--'tis a\r\n'Brute-Animal sui generis', and a particular 'species of Ape'.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of \"Chimpanzee,\" by which one of the African Apes is now so\r\nwell known, appears to have come into use in the first half of the\r\neighteenth century, but the only important addition made, in that\r\nperiod, to our acquaintance with the man-like apes of Africa is\r\ncontained in 'A New Voyage to Guinea', by William Smith, which bears the\r\ndate 1744.\r\n\r\nIn describing the animals of Sierra Leone, p. 51, this writer says:--\r\n\r\n\"I shall next describe a strange sort of animal, called by the white men\r\nin this country Mandrill [7], but why it is so called I know not, nor\r\ndid I ever hear the name before, neither can those who call them so\r\ntell, except it be for their near resemblance of a human creature,\r\nthough nothing at all like an Ape. Their bodies, when full grown, are as\r\nbig in circumference as a middle-sized man's--their legs much shorter,\r\nand their feet larger; their arms and hands in proportion. The head is\r\nmonstrously big, and the face broad and flat, without any other hair but\r\nthe eyebrows; the nose very small, the mouth wide, and the lips thin.\r\nThe face, which is covered by a white skin, is monstrously ugly, being\r\nall over wrinkled as with old age; the teeth broad and yellow; the hands\r\nhave no more hair than the face, but the same white skin, though all\r\nthe rest of the body is covered with long black hair, like a bear. They\r\nnever go upon all fours, like apes; but cry, when vexed or teased, just\r\nlike children....\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Facsimile of William Smith's figure of the\r\n\"Mandrill,\" 1744.]\r\n\r\n\"When I was at Sherbro, one Mr. Cummerbus, whom I shall have occasion\r\nhereafter to mention, made me a present of one of these strange animals,\r\nwhich are called by the natives Boggoe: it was a she-cub, of six months'\r\nage, but even then larger than a Baboon. I gave it in charge to one of\r\nthe slaves, who knew how to feed and nurse it, being a very tender sort\r\nof animal; but whenever I went off the deck the sailors began to teaze\r\nit--some loved to see its tears and hear it cry; others hated its snotty\r\nnose; one who hurt it, being checked by the negro that took care of it,\r\ntold the slave he was very fond of his country-woman, and asked him\r\nif he should not like her for a wife? To which the slave very readily\r\nreplied, 'No, this no my wife; this a white woman--this fit wife for\r\nyou.' This unlucky wit of the negro's, I fancy, hastened its death, for\r\nnext morning it was found dead under the windlass.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith's 'Mandrill,' or 'Boggoe,' as his description and figure\r\ntestify, was, without doubt, a Chimpanzee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--The Anthropomorpha of Linnaeus.]\r\n\r\nLinnaeus knew nothing, of his own observation, of the man-like Apes of\r\neither Africa or Asia, but a dissertation by his pupil Hoppius in the\r\n'Amoenitates Academicae' (VI. 'Anthropomorpha') may be regarded as\r\nembodying his views respecting these animals.\r\n\r\nThe dissertation is illustrated by a plate, of which the accompanying\r\nwoodcut, Fig, 6, is a reduced copy, The figures are entitled (from left\r\nto right) 1. 'Troglodyta Bontii'; 2. 'Lucifer Aldrovandi'; 3. 'Satyrus\r\nTulpii'; 4. 'Pygmaeus Edwardi'. The first is a bad copy of Bontius'\r\nfictitious 'Ourang-outang,' in whose existence, however, Linnaeus\r\nappears to have fully believed; for in the standard edition of the\r\n'Systema Naturae', it is enumerated as a second species of Homo; \"H.\r\nnocturnus.\" 'Lucifer Aldrovandi' is a copy of a figure in Aldrovandus,\r\n'De Quadrupedibus digitatis viviparis', Lib. 2, p. 249 (1645), entitled\r\n\"Cercopithecus formae rarae 'Barbilius' vocatus et originem a china\r\nducebat.\" Hoppius is of opinion that this may be one of that cat-tailed\r\npeople, of whom Nicolaus Koping affirms that they eat a boat's crew,\r\n\"gubernator navis\" and all! In the 'Systema Naturae' Linnaeus calls it\r\nin a note, 'Homo caudatus', and seems inclined to regard it as a third\r\nspecies of man. According to Temminck, 'Satyrus Tulpii' is a copy of\r\nthe figure of a Chimpanzee published by Scotin in 1738, which I have\r\nnot seen. It is the 'Satyrus indicus' of the 'Systema Naturae', and\r\nis regarded by Linnaeus as possibly a distinct species from 'Satyrus\r\nsylvestris'. The last, named 'Pygmaeus Edwardi', is copied from the\r\nfigure of a young \"Man of the Woods,\" or true Orang-Utan, given in\r\nEdwards' 'Gleanings of Natural History' (1758).\r\n\r\nBuffon was more fortunate than his great rival. Not only had he the rare\r\nopportunity of examining a young Chimpanzee in the living state, but\r\nhe became possessed of an adult Asiatic man-like Ape--the first and the\r\nlast adult specimen of any of these animals brought to Europe for\r\nmany years. With the valuable assistance of Daubenton, Buffon gave\r\nan excellent description of this creature, which, from its singular\r\nproportions, he termed the long-armed Ape, or Gibbon. It is the modern\r\n'Hylobates lar'.\r\n\r\nThus when, in 1766, Buffon wrote the fourteenth volume of his great\r\nwork, he was personally familiar with the young of one kind of African\r\nman-like Ape, and with the adult of an Asiatic species--while the\r\nOrang-Utan and the Mandrill of Smith were known to him by report.\r\nFurthermore, the Abbe Prevost had translated a good deal of Purchas'\r\nPilgrims into French, in his 'Histoire generale des Voyages' (1748), and\r\nthere Buffon found a version of Andrew Battell's account of the Pongo\r\nand the Engeco. All these data Buffon attempts to weld together into\r\nharmony in his chapter entitled \"Les Orang-outangs ou le Pongo et le\r\nJocko.\" To this title the following note is appended:--\r\n\r\n\"Orang-outang nom de cet animal aux Indes orientales: Pongo nom de cet\r\nanimal a Lowando Province de Congo.\r\n\r\n\"Jocko, Enjocko, nom de cet animal a Congo que nous avons adopte. 'En'\r\nest l'article que nous avons retranche.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was that Andrew Battell's \"Engeco\" became metamorphosed into\r\n\"Jocko,\" and, in the latter shape, was spread all over the world, in\r\nconsequence of the extensive popularity of Buffon's works. The\r\nAbbe Prevost and Buffon between them, however, did a good deal more\r\ndisfigurement to Battell's sober account than 'cutting off an article.'\r\nThus Battell's statement that the Pongos \"cannot speake, and have no\r\nunderstanding more than a beast,\" is rendered by Buffon \"qu'il ne peut\r\nparler 'quoiqu'il ait plus d'entendement que les autres animaux'\"; and\r\nagain, Purchas' affirmation, \"He told me in conference with him, that\r\none of these Pongos tooke a negro boy of his which lived a moneth with\r\nthem,\" stands in the French version, \"un pongo lui enleva un petit negre\r\nqui passa un 'an' entier dans la societe de ces animaux.\"\r\n\r\nAfter quoting the account of the great Pongo, Buffon justly remarks,\r\nthat all the 'Jockos' and 'Orangs' hitherto brought to Europe were\r\nyoung; and he suggests that, in their adult condition, they might be as\r\nbig as the Pongo or 'great Orang'; so that, provisionally, he regarded\r\nthe Jockos, Orangs, and Pongos as all of one species. And perhaps this\r\nwas as much as the state of knowledge at the time warranted. But how\r\nit came about that Buffon failed to perceive the similarity of Smith's\r\n'Mandrill' to his own 'Jocko,' and confounded the former with so\r\ntotally different a creature as the blue-faced Baboon, is not so easily\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later Buffon changed his opinion, [8] and expressed his\r\nbelief that the Orangs constituted a genus with two species,--a large\r\none, the Pongo of Battell, and a small one, the Jocko: that the small\r\none (Jocko) is the East Indian Orang; and that the young animals from\r\nAfrica, observed by himself and Tulpius, are simply young Pongos.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Dutch naturalist, Vosmaer, gave, in 1778, a very\r\ngood account and figure of a young Orang, brought alive to Holland, and\r\nhis countryman, the famous anatomist, Peter Camper, published (1779)\r\nan essay on the Orang-Utan of similar value to that of Tyson on the\r\nChimpanzee. He dissected several females and a male, all of which, from\r\nthe state of their skeleton and their dentition, he justly supposes to\r\nhave been young. However, judging by the analogy of man, he concludes\r\nthat they could not have exceeded four feet in height in the adult\r\ncondition. Furthermore, he is very clear as to the specific distinctness\r\nof the true East Indian Orang.\r\n\r\n\"The Orang,\" says he, \"differs not only from the Pigmy of Tyson and from\r\nthe Orang of Tulpius by its peculiar colour and its long toes, but\r\nalso by its whole external form. Its arms, its hands, and its feet are\r\nlonger, while the thumbs, on the contrary, are much shorter, and the\r\ngreat toes much smaller in proportion.\" [9] And again, \"The true Orang,\r\nthat is to say, that of Asia, that of Borneo, is consequently not the\r\nPithecus, or tailless Ape, which the Greeks, and especially Galen,\r\nhave described. It is neither the Pongo nor the Jocko, nor the Orang\r\nof Tulpius, nor the Pigmy of Tyson,--'it is an animal of a peculiar\r\nspecies', as I shall prove in the clearest manner by the organs of voice\r\nand the skeleton in the following chapters\" (l. c. p. 64).\r\n\r\nA few years later, M. Radermacher, who held a high office in the\r\nGovernment of the Dutch dominions in India, and was an active member of\r\nthe Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, published, in the second part\r\nof the Transactions of that Society, [10] a Description of the Island\r\nof Borneo, which was written between the years 1779 and 1781, and, among\r\nmuch other interesting matter, contains some notes upon the Orang. The\r\nsmall sort of Orang-Utan, viz. that of Vosmaer and of Edwards, he says,\r\nis found only in Borneo, and chiefly about Banjermassing, Mampauwa,\r\nand Landak. Of these he had seen some fifty during his residence in the\r\nIndies; but none exceeded 2 1/2 feet in length. The larger sort, often\r\nregarded as a chimaera, continues Radermacher, would perhaps long\r\nhave remained so, had it not been for the exertions of the Resident at\r\nRembang, M. Palm, who, on returning from Landak towards Pontiana, shot\r\none, and forwarded it to Batavia in spirit, for transmission to Europe.\r\n\r\nPalm's letter describing the capture runs thus:--\"Herewith I send your\r\nExcellency, contrary to all expectation (since long ago I offered more\r\nthan a hundred ducats to the natives for an Orang-Utan of four or five\r\nfeet high) an Orang which I heard of this morning about eight o'clock.\r\nFor a long time we did our best to take the frightful beast alive in the\r\ndense forest about half way to Landak. We forgot even to eat, so anxious\r\nwere we not to let him escape; but it was necessary to take care that\r\nhe did not revenge himself, as he kept continually breaking off heavy\r\npieces of wood and green branches, and dashing them at us. This game\r\nlasted till four o'clock in the afternoon, when we determined to shoot\r\nhim; in which I succeeded very well, and indeed better than I ever shot\r\nfrom a boat before; for the bullet went just into the side of his chest,\r\nso that he was not much damaged. We got him into the prow still living,\r\nand bound him fast, and next morning he died of his wounds. All Pontiana\r\ncame on board to see him when we arrived.\" Palm gives his height from\r\nthe head to the heel as 49 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Pongo Skull, sent by Radermacher to Camper,\r\nafter Camper's original sketches, as reproduced by Lucae.]\r\n\r\nA very intelligent German officer, Baron Von Wurmb, who at this time\r\nheld a post in the Dutch East India service, and was Secretary of the\r\nBatavian Society, studied this animal, and his careful description of\r\nit, entitled \"Beschrijving van der Groote Borneosche Orang-outang of de\r\nOost-Indische Pongo,\" is contained in the same volume of the Batavian\r\nSociety's Transactions. After Von Wurmb had drawn up his description he\r\nstates, in a letter dated Batavia, Feb. 18, 1781, [11] that the specimen\r\nwas sent to Europe in brandy to be placed in the collection of the\r\nPrince of Orange; \"unfortunately,\" he continues, \"we hear that the ship\r\nhas been wrecked.\" Von Wurmb died in the course of the year 1781, the\r\nletter in which this passage occurs being the last he wrote; but in his\r\nposthumous papers, published in the fourth part of the Transactions of\r\nthe Batavian Society, there is a brief description, with measurements,\r\nof a female Pongo four feet high.\r\n\r\nDid either of these original specimens, on which Von Wurmb's\r\ndescriptions are based, ever reach Europe? It is commonly supposed\r\nthat they did; but I doubt the fact. For, appended to the memoir 'De\r\nl'Ourang-outang,' in the collected edition of Camper's works, tome i.,\r\npp. 64-66, is a note by Camper himself, referring to Von Wurmb's papers,\r\nand continuing thus:--\"Heretofore, this kind of ape had never been known\r\nin Europe. Radermacher has had the kindness to send me the skull of one\r\nof these animals, which measured fifty-three inches, or four feet five\r\ninches, in height. I have sent some sketches of it to M. Soemmering at\r\nMayence, which are better calculated, however, to give an idea of the\r\nform than of the real size of the parts.\"\r\n\r\nThese sketches have been reproduced by Fischer and by Lucae, and bear\r\ndate 1783, Soemmering having received them in 1784. Had either of Von\r\nWurmb's specimens reached Holland, they would hardly have been unknown\r\nat this time to Camper, who, however, goes on to say--\"It appears that\r\nsince this, some more of these monsters have been captured, for an\r\nentire skeleton, very badly set up, which had been sent to the Museum\r\nof the Prince of Orange, and which I saw only on the 27th of June, 1784,\r\nwas more than four feet high. I examined this skeleton again on the\r\n19th December, 1785, after it had been excellently put to rights by the\r\ningenious Onymus.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears evident, then, that this skeleton, which is doubtless that\r\nwhich has always gone by the name of Wurmb's Pongo, is not that of the\r\nanimal described by him, though unquestionably similar in all essential\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nCamper proceeds to note some of the most important features of this\r\nskeleton; promises to describe it in detail by-and-bye; and is evidently\r\nin doubt as to the relation of this great 'Pongo' to his \"petit Orang.\"\r\n\r\nThe promised further investigations were never carried out; and so it\r\nhappened that the Pongo of Von Wurmb took its place by the side of\r\nthe Chimpanzee, Gibbon, and Orang as a fourth and colossal species\r\nof man-like Ape. And indeed nothing could look much less like the\r\nChimpanzees or the Orangs, then known, than the Pongo; for all the\r\nspecimens of Chimpanzee and Orang which had been observed were small of\r\nstature, singularly human in aspect, gentle and docile; while Wurmb's\r\nPongo was a monster almost twice their size, of vast strength and\r\nfierceness, and very brutal in expression; its great projecting muzzle,\r\narmed with strong teeth, being further disfigured by the outgrowth of\r\nthe cheeks into fleshy lobes.\r\n\r\nEventually, in accordance with the usual marauding habits of the\r\nRevolutionary armies, the 'Pongo' skeleton was carried away from Holland\r\ninto France, and notices of it, expressly intended to demonstrate its\r\nentire distinctness from the Orang and its affinity with the baboons,\r\nwere given, in 1798, by Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier.\r\n\r\nEven in Cuvier's 'Tableau Elementaire', and in the first edition of his\r\ngreat work, the 'Regne Animal', the 'Pongo' is classed as a species of\r\nBaboon. However, so early as 1818, it appears that Cuvier saw reason to\r\nalter this opinion, and to adopt the view suggested several years before\r\nby Blumenbach, [12] and after him by Tilesius, that the Bornean Pongo is\r\nsimply an adult Orang. In 1824, Rudolphi demonstrated, by the condition\r\nof the dentition, more fully and completely than had been done by his\r\npredecessors, that the Orangs described up to that time were all young\r\nanimals, and that the skull and teeth of the adult would probably be\r\nsuch as those seen in the Pongo of Wurmb. In the second edition of the\r\n'Regne Animal' (1829), Cuvier infers, from the 'proportions of all the\r\nparts' and 'the arrangements of the foramina and sutures of the head,'\r\nthat the Pongo is the adult of the Orang-Utan, 'at least of a very\r\nclosely allied species,' and this conclusion was eventually placed\r\nbeyond all doubt by Professor Owen's Memoir published in the 'Zoological\r\nTransactions' for 1835, and by Temminck in his 'Monographies de\r\nMammalogie'. Temminck's memoir is remarkable for the completeness of the\r\nevidence which it affords as to the modification which the form of the\r\nOrang undergoes according to age and sex. Tiedemann first published an\r\naccount of the brain of the young Orang, while Sandifort, Muller and\r\nSchlegel, described the muscles and the viscera of the adult, and gave\r\nthe earliest detailed and trustworthy history of the habits of the great\r\nIndian Ape in a state of nature; and as important additions have been\r\nmade by later observers, we are at this moment better acquainted with\r\nthe adult of the Orang-Utan, than with that of any of the other greater\r\nman-like Apes.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly the Pongo of Wurmb; [13] and it is as certainly not the\r\nPongo of Battell, seeing that the Orang-Utan is entirely confined to the\r\ngreat Asiatic islands of Borneo and Sumatra.\r\n\r\nAnd while the progress of discovery thus cleared up the history of the\r\nOrang, it also became established that the only other man-like Apes in\r\nthe eastern world were the various species of Gibbon--Apes of smaller\r\nstature, and therefore attracting less attention than the Orangs, though\r\nthey are spread over a much wider range of country, and are hence more\r\naccessible to observation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the geographical area inhabited by the 'Pongo' and Engeco of\r\nBattell is so much nearer to Europe than that in which the Orang and\r\nGibbon are found, our acquaintance with the African Apes has been of\r\nslower growth; indeed, it is only within the last few years that the\r\ntruthful story of the old English adventurer has been rendered fully\r\nintelligible. It was not until 1835 that the skeleton of the adult\r\nChimpanzee became known, by the publication of Professor Owen's\r\nabove-mentioned very excellent memoir 'On the osteology of the\r\nChimpanzee and Orang', in the 'Zoological Transactions'--a memoir which,\r\nby the accuracy of its descriptions, the carefulness of its comparisons,\r\nand the excellence of its figures, made an epoch in the history of our\r\nknowledge of the bony framework, not only of the Chimpanzee, but of all\r\nthe anthropoid Apes.\r\n\r\nBy the investigations herein detailed, it became evident that the old\r\nChimpanzee acquired a size and aspect as different from those of the\r\nyoung known to Tyson, to Buffon, and to Traill, as those of the old\r\nOrang from the young Orang; and the subsequent very important researches\r\nof Messrs. Savage and Wyman, the American missionary and anatomist, have\r\nnot only confirmed this conclusion, but have added many new details.\r\n[14]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting among the many valuable discoveries made by\r\nDr. Thomas Savage is the fact, that the natives in the Gaboon country at\r\nthe present day, apply to the Chimpanzee a name--\"Enche-eko\"--which is\r\nobviously identical with the \"Engeko\" of Battell; a discovery which has\r\nbeen confirmed by all later inquirers. Battell's \"lesser monster\" being\r\nthus proved to be a veritable existence, of course a strong presumption\r\narose that his \"greater monster,\" the 'Pongo,' would sooner or later\r\nbe discovered. And, indeed, a modern traveller, Bowdich, had, in 1819,\r\nfound strong evidence, among the natives, of the existence of a second\r\ngreat Ape, called the 'Ingena,' \"five feet high, and four across the\r\nshoulders,\" the builder of a rude house, on the outside of which it\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Dr. Savage had the good fortune to make another and most\r\nimportant addition to our knowledge of the man-like Apes; for, being\r\nunexpectedly detained at the Gaboon river, he saw in the house of the\r\nRev. Mr. Wilson, a missionary resident there, \"a skull represented\r\nby the natives to be a monkey-like animal, remarkable for its\r\nsize, ferocity, and habits.\" From the contour of the skull, and the\r\ninformation derived from several intelligent natives, \"I was induced,\"\r\nsays Dr. Savage (using the term Orang in its old general sense) \"to\r\nbelieve that it belonged to a new species of Orang. I expressed this\r\nopinion to Mr. Wilson, with a desire for further investigation; and, if\r\npossible, to decide the point by the inspection of a specimen alive or\r\ndead.\" The result of the combined exertions of Messrs. Savage and Wilson\r\nwas not only the obtaining of a very full account of the habits of\r\nthis new creature, but a still more important service to science, the\r\nenabling the excellent American anatomist already mentioned, Professor\r\nWyman, to describe, from ample materials, the distinctive osteological\r\ncharacters of the new form. This animal was called by the natives of\r\nthe Gaboon \"Enge-ena,\" a name obviously identical with the \"Ingena\"\r\nof Bowdich; and Dr. Savage arrived at the conviction that this last\r\ndiscovered of all the great Apes was the long-sought \"Pongo\" of Battell.\r\n\r\nThe justice of this conclusion, indeed, is beyond doubt--for not only\r\ndoes the 'Enge-ena' agree with Battell's \"greater monster\" in its hollow\r\neyes, its great stature, and its dun or iron-grey colour, but the only\r\nother man-like Ape which inhabits these latitudes--the Chimpanzee--is\r\nat once identified, by its smaller size, as the \"lesser monster,\" and is\r\nexcluded from any possibility of being the 'Pongo,' by the fact that\r\nit is black and not dun, to say nothing of the important circumstance\r\nalready mentioned that it still retains the name of 'Engeko,' or\r\n\"Enche-eko,\" by which Battell knew it.\r\n\r\nIn seeking for a specific name for the \"Enge-ena,\" however, Dr. Savage\r\nwisely avoided the much misused 'Pongo'; but finding in the ancient\r\nPeriplus of Hanno the word \"Gorilla\" applied to certain hairy savage\r\npeople, discovered by the Carthaginian voyager in an island on the\r\nAfrican coast, he attached the specific name \"Gorilla\" to his new ape,\r\nwhence arises its present well-known appellation. But Dr. Savage, more\r\ncautious than some of his successors, by no means identifies his ape\r\nwith Hanno's \"wild men.\" He merely says that the latter were \"probably\r\none of the species of the Orang;\" and I quite agree with M. Brulle, that\r\nthere is no ground for identifying the modern 'Gorilla' with that of the\r\nCarthaginian admiral.\r\n\r\nSince the memoir of Savage and Wyman was published, the skeleton of\r\nthe Gorilla has been investigated by Professor Owen and by the late\r\nProfessor Duvernoy, of the Jardin des Plantes, the latter having further\r\nsupplied a valuable account of the muscular system and of many of\r\nthe other soft parts; while African missionaries and travellers have\r\nconfirmed and expanded the account originally given of the habits of\r\nthis great man-like Ape, which has had the singular fortune of being\r\nthe first to be made known to the general world and the last to be\r\nscientifically investigated.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries and a half have passed away since Battell told his stories\r\nabout the 'greater' and the 'lesser monsters' to Purchas, and it has\r\ntaken nearly that time to arrive at the clear result that there are\r\nfour distinct kinds of Anthropoids--in Eastern Asia, the Gibbons and the\r\nOrangs; in Western Africa, the Chimpanzees and the Gorilla.\r\n\r\nThe man-like Apes, the history of whose discovery has just been\r\ndetailed, have certain characters of structure and of distribution in\r\ncommon. Thus they all have the same number of teeth as man--possessing\r\nfour incisors, two canines, four false molars, and six true molars in\r\neach jaw, or 32 teeth in all, in the adult condition; while the milk\r\ndentition consists of 20 teeth--or four incisors, two canines, and four\r\nmolars in each jaw. They are what are called catarrhine Apes--that\r\nis, their nostrils have a narrow partition and look downwards;\r\nand, furthermore, their arms are always longer than their legs, the\r\ndifference being sometimes greater and sometimes less; so that if\r\nthe four were arranged in the order of the length of their arms in\r\nproportion to that of their legs, we should have this series--Orang (1\r\n4/9:1), Gibbon (1 1/4:1), Gorilla (1 1/5:1), Chimpanzee (1 1/16:1). In\r\nall, the fore limbs are terminated by hands, provided with longer or\r\nshorter thumbs; while the great toe of the foot, always smaller than in\r\nMan, is far more movable than in him and can be opposed, like a thumb,\r\nto the rest of the foot. None of these apes have tails, and none of them\r\npossess the cheek pouches common among monkeys. Finally, they are all\r\ninhabitants of the old world.\r\n\r\nThe Gibbons are the smallest, slenderest, and longest-limbed of the\r\nman-like apes: their arms are longer in proportion to their bodies than\r\nthose of any of the other man-like Apes, so that they can touch the\r\nground when erect; their hands are longer than their feet, and they are\r\nthe only Anthropoids which possess callosities like the lower monkeys.\r\nThey are variously coloured. The Orangs have arms which reach to the\r\nankles in the erect position of the animal; their thumbs and great toes\r\nare very short, and their feet are longer than their hands. They are\r\ncovered with reddish brown hair, and the sides of the face, in adult\r\nmales, are commonly produced into two crescentic, flexible excrescences,\r\nlike fatty tumours. The Chimpanzees have arms which reach below the\r\nknees; they have large thumbs and great toes, their hands are longer\r\nthan their feet; and their hair is black, while the skin of the face\r\nis pale. The Gorilla, lastly, has arms which reach to the middle of the\r\nleg, large thumbs and great toes, feet longer than the hands, a black\r\nface, and dark-grey or dun hair.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose which I have at present in view, it is unnecessary that\r\nI should enter into any further minutiae respecting the distinctive\r\ncharacters of the genera and species into which these man-like Apes\r\nare divided by naturalists. Suffice it to say, that the Orangs and the\r\nGibbons constitute the distinct genera, 'Simia' and 'Hylobates'; while\r\nthe Chimpanzees and Gorillas are by some regarded simply as\r\ndistinct species of one genus, 'Troglodytes'; by others as distinct\r\ngenera--'Troglodytes' being reserved for the Chimpanzees, and 'Gorilla'\r\nfor the Enge-ena or Pongo.\r\n\r\nSound knowledge respecting the habits and mode of life of the man-like\r\nApes has been even more difficult of attainment than correct information\r\nregarding their structure.\r\n\r\nOnce in a generation, a Wallace may be found physically, mentally, and\r\nmorally qualified to wander unscathed through the tropical wilds of\r\nAmerica and of Asia; to form magnificent collections as he wanders;\r\nand withal to think out sagaciously the conclusions suggested by his\r\ncollections: but, to the ordinary explorer or collector, the dense\r\nforests of equatorial Asia and Africa, which constitute the favourite\r\nhabitation of the Orang, the Chimpanzee, and the Gorilla, present\r\ndifficulties of no ordinary magnitude: and the man who risks his life by\r\neven a short visit to the malarious shores of those regions may well\r\nbe excused if he shrinks from facing the dangers of the interior; if he\r\ncontents himself with stimulating the industry of the better seasoned\r\nnatives, and collecting and collating the more or less mythical reports\r\nand traditions with which they are too ready to supply him.\r\n\r\nIn such a manner most of the earlier accounts of the habits of the\r\nman-like Apes originated; and even now a good deal of what passes\r\ncurrent must be admitted to have no very safe foundation. The best\r\ninformation we possess is that, based almost wholly on direct European\r\ntestimony respecting the Gibbons; the next best evidence relates to\r\nthe Orangs; while our knowledge of the habits of the Chimpanzee and the\r\nGorilla stands much in need of support and enlargement by additional\r\ntestimony from instructed European eye-witnesses.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be convenient in endeavouring to form a notion of what\r\nwe are justified in believing about these animals, to commence with the\r\nbest known man-like Apes, the Gibbons and Orangs; and to make use of the\r\nperfectly reliable information respecting them as a sort of criterion of\r\nthe probable truth or falsehood of assertions respecting the others.\r\n\r\nOf the GIBBONS, half a dozen species are found scattered over the\r\nAsiatic islands, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and through Malacca, Siam,\r\nArracan, and an uncertain extent of Hindostan, on the main land of Asia.\r\nThe largest attain a few inches above three feet in height, from the\r\ncrown to the heel, so that they are shorter than the other man-like\r\nApes; while the slenderness of their bodies renders their mass far\r\nsmaller in proportion even to this diminished height.\r\n\r\nDr. Salomon Muller, an accomplished Dutch naturalist, who lived for many\r\nyears in the Eastern Archipelago, and to the results of whose personal\r\nexperience I shall frequently have occasion to refer, states that the\r\nGibbons are true mountaineers, loving the slopes and edges of the hills,\r\nthough they rarely ascend beyond the limit of the fig-trees. All day\r\nlong they haunt the tops of the tall trees; and though, towards evening,\r\nthey descend in small troops to the open ground, no sooner do they spy\r\na man than they dart up the hill-sides, and disappear in the darker\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nAll observers testify to the prodigious volume of voice possessed by\r\nthese animals. According to the writer whom I have just cited, in one of\r\nthem, the Siamang, \"the voice is grave and penetrating, resembling the\r\nsounds goek, goek, goek, goek, goek ha ha ha ha haaaaa, and may easily\r\nbe heard at a distance of half a league.\" While the cry is being\r\nuttered, the great membranous bag under the throat which communicates\r\nwith the organ of voice, the so-called \"laryngeal sac,\" becomes greatly\r\ndistended, diminishing again when the creature relapses into silence.\r\n\r\nM. Duvaucel, likewise, affirms that the cry of the Siamang may be heard\r\nfor miles--making the woods ring again. So Mr. Martin [15] describes the\r\ncry of the agile Gibbon as \"overpowering and deafening\" in a room, and\r\n\"from its strength, well calculated for resounding through the vast\r\nforests.\" Mr. Waterhouse, an accomplished musician as well as zoologist,\r\nsays, \"The Gibbon's voice is certainly much more powerful than that of\r\nany singer I have ever heard.\" And yet it is to be recollected that this\r\nanimal is not half the height of, and far less bulky in proportion than,\r\na man.\r\n\r\nThere is good testimony that various species of Gibbon readily take to\r\nthe erect posture. Mr. George Bennett, [16] a very excellent observer,\r\nin describing the habits of a male 'Hylobates syndactylus' which\r\nremained for some time in his possession, says: \"He invariably walks in\r\nthe erect posture when on a level surface; and then the arms either hang\r\ndown, enabling him to assist himself with his knuckles; or what is more\r\nusual, he keeps his arms uplifted in nearly an erect position, with the\r\nhands pendent ready to seize a rope, and climb up on the approach of\r\ndanger or on the obtrusion of strangers. He walks rather quick in the\r\nerect posture, but with a waddling gait, and is soon run down if, whilst\r\npursued, he has no opportunity of escaping by climbing.... When he walks\r\nin the erect posture he turns the leg and foot outwards, which occasions\r\nhim to have a waddling gait and to seem bow-legged.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Burrough states of another Gibbon, the Horlack or Hooluk: \"They\r\nwalk erect; and when placed on the floor, or in an open field, balance\r\nthemselves very prettily, by raising their hands over their head and\r\nslightly bending the arm at the wrist and elbow, and then run tolerably\r\nfast, rocking from side to side; and, if urged to greater speed, they\r\nlet fall their hands to the ground, and assist themselves forward,\r\nrather jumping than running, still keeping the body, however, nearly\r\nerect.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat different evidence, however, is given by Dr. Winslow Lewis:\r\n[17]\r\n\r\n\"Their only manner of walking was on their posterior or inferior\r\nextremities, the others being raised upwards to preserve their\r\nequilibrium, as rope-dancers are assisted by long poles at fairs.\r\nTheir progression was not by placing one foot before the other, but\r\nby simultaneously using both, as in jumping.\" Dr. Salomon Muller also\r\nstates that the Gibbons progress along the ground by a short series of\r\ntottering jumps, effected only by the hind limbs, the body being held\r\naltogether upright.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Martin (l. c. p. 418), who also speaks from direct observation,\r\nsays of the Gibbons generally:\r\n\r\n\"Pre-eminently qualified for arboreal habits, and displaying among the\r\nbranches amazing activity, the Gibbons are not so awkward or embarrassed\r\non a level surface as might be imagined. They walk erect, with a\r\nwaddling or unsteady gait, but at a quick pace; the equilibrium of the\r\nbody requiring to be kept up, either by touching the ground with the\r\nknuckles, first on one side then on the other, or by uplifting the arms\r\nso as to poise it. As with the Chimpanzee, the whole of the narrow, long\r\nsole of the foot is placed upon the ground at once and raised at once,\r\nwithout any elasticity of step.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Gibbon ('H. pileatus'), after Wolf.]\r\n\r\nAfter this mass of concurrent and independent testimony, it cannot\r\nreasonably be doubted that the Gibbons commonly and habitually assume\r\nthe erect attitude.\r\n\r\nBut level ground is not the place where these animals can display their\r\nvery remarkable and peculiar locomotive powers, and that prodigious\r\nactivity which almost tempts one to rank them among flying, rather than\r\namong ordinary climbing mammals.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin (l.c. p. 430) has given so excellent and graphic an account\r\nof the movements of a 'Hylobates agilis', living in the Zoological\r\nGardens, in 1840, that I will quote it in full:\r\n\r\n\"It is almost impossible to convey in words an idea of the quickness and\r\ngraceful address of her movements: they may indeed be termed aerial, as\r\nshe seems merely to touch in her progress the branches among which she\r\nexhibits her evolutions. In these feats her hands and arms are the\r\nsole organs of locomotion; her body hanging as if suspended by a rope,\r\nsustained by one hand (the right for example) she launches herself, by\r\nan energetic movement, to a distant branch, which she catches with the\r\nleft hand; but her hold is less than momentary: the impulse for the next\r\nlaunch is acquired: the branch then aimed at is attained by the right\r\nhand again, and quitted instantaneously, and so on, in alternate\r\nsuccession. In this manner spaces of twelve and eighteen feet are\r\ncleared, with the greatest ease and uninterruptedly, for hours together,\r\nwithout the slightest appearance of fatigue being manifested; and it\r\nis evident that, if more space could be allowed, distances very greatly\r\nexceeding eighteen feet would be as easily cleared; so that Duvaucel's\r\nassertion that he has seen these animals launch themselves from one\r\nbranch to another, forty feet asunder, startling as it is, may be well\r\ncredited. Sometimes, on seizing a branch in her progress, she will throw\r\nherself, by the power of one arm only, completely round it, making a\r\nrevolution with such rapidity as almost to deceive the eye, and continue\r\nher progress with undiminished velocity. It is singular to observe how\r\nsuddenly this Gibbon can stop, when the impetus given by the rapidity\r\nand distance of her swinging leaps would seem to require a gradual\r\nabatement of her movements. In the very midst of her flight a branch is\r\nseized, the body raised, and she is seen, as if by magic, quietly seated\r\non it, grasping it with her feet. As suddenly she again throws herself\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\n\"The following facts will convey some notion of her dexterity and\r\nquickness. A live bird was let loose in her apartment; she marked its\r\nflight, made a long swing to a distant branch, caught the bird with one\r\nhand in her passage, and attained the branch with her other hand; her\r\naim, both at the bird and at the branch, being as successful as if\r\none object only had engaged her attention. It may be added that she\r\ninstantly bit off the head of the bird, picked its feathers, and then\r\nthrew it down without attempting to eat it.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion this animal swung herself from a perch, across a\r\npassage at least twelve feet wide, against a window which it was thought\r\nwould be immediately broken: but not so; to the surprise of all, she\r\ncaught the narrow framework between the panes with her hand, in an\r\ninstant attained the proper impetus, and sprang back again to the cage\r\nshe had left--a feat requiring not only great strength, but the nicest\r\nprecision.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gibbons appear to be naturally very gentle, but there is very\r\ngood evidence that they will bite severely when irritated--a female\r\n'Hylobates agilis' having so severely lacerated one man with her long\r\ncanines, that he died; while she had injured others so much that, by\r\nway of precaution, these formidable teeth had been filed down; but, if\r\nthreatened, she would still turn on her keeper. The Gibbons eat insects,\r\nbut appear generally to avoid animal food. A Siamang, however, was seen\r\nby Mr. Bennett to seize and devour greedily a live lizard. They commonly\r\ndrink by dipping their fingers in the liquid and then licking them. It\r\nis asserted that they sleep in a sitting posture.\r\n\r\nDuvaucel affirms that he has seen the females carry their young to the\r\nwaterside and there wash their faces, in spite of resistance and cries.\r\nThey are gentle and affectionate in captivity--full of tricks and\r\npettishness, like spoiled children, and yet not devoid of a certain\r\nconscience, as an anecdote, told by Mr. Bennett (l. c. p. 156), will\r\nshow. It would appear that his Gibbon had a peculiar inclination for\r\ndisarranging things in the cabin. Among these articles, a piece of soap\r\nwould especially attract his notice, and for the removal of this he\r\nhad been once or twice scolded. \"One morning,\" says Mr. Bennett, \"I\r\nwas writing, the ape being present in the cabin, when casting my eyes\r\ntowards him, I saw the little fellow taking the soap. I watched him\r\nwithout his perceiving that I did so: and he occasionally would cast a\r\nfurtive glance towards the place where I sat. I pretended to write; he,\r\nseeing me busily occupied, took the soap, and moved away with it in his\r\npaw. When he had walked half the length of the cabin, I spoke quietly,\r\nwithout frightening him. The instant he found I saw him, he walked back\r\nagain, and deposited the soap nearly in the same place from whence he\r\nhad taken it. There was certainly something more than instinct in that\r\naction: he evidently betrayed a consciousness of having done wrong both\r\nby his first and last actions--and what is reason if that is not an\r\nexercise of it?\"\r\n\r\nThe most elaborate account of the natural history of the ORANG-UTAN\r\nextant, is that given in the \"Verhandelingen over de Natuurlijke\r\nGeschiedenis der Nederlandsche overzeesche Bezittingen (1839-45),\" by\r\nDr. Salomon Muller and Dr. Schlegel, and I shall base what I have to\r\nsay, upon this subject almost entirely on their statements, adding, here\r\nand there, particulars of interest from the writings of Brooke, Wallace,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nThe Orang-Utan would rarely seem to exceed four feet in height, but the\r\nbody is very bulky, measuring two-thirds of the height in circumference.\r\n[18]\r\n\r\nThe Orang-Utan is found only in Sumatra and Borneo, and is common in\r\nneither of these islands--in both of which it occurs always in low, flat\r\nplains, never in the mountains. It loves the densest and most sombre of\r\nthe forests, which extend from the sea-shore inland, and thus is found\r\nonly in the eastern half of Sumatra, where alone such forests occur,\r\nthough, occasionally, it strays over to the western side.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is generally distributed through Borneo, except in\r\nthe mountains, or where the population is dense. In favourable places,\r\nthe hunter may, by good fortune, see three or four in a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. An adult male Orang-utan, after Muller and\r\nSchlegel.]\r\n\r\nExcept in the pairing time, the old males usually live by themselves.\r\nThe old females, and the immature males, on the other hand, are often\r\nmet with in twos and threes; and the former occasionally have young\r\nwith them, though the pregnant females usually separate themselves, and\r\nsometimes remain apart after they have given birth to their offspring.\r\nThe young Orangs seem to remain unusually long under their mother's\r\nprotection, probably in consequence of their slow growth. While\r\nclimbing, the mother always carries her young against her bosom, the\r\nyoung holding on by his mother's hair. [19] At what time of life the\r\nOrang-Utan becomes capable of propagation, and how long the females go\r\nwith young, is unknown, but it is probable that they are not adult until\r\nthey arrive at ten or fifteen years of age. A female which lived for\r\nfive years at Batavia, had not attained one-third the height of the wild\r\nfemales. It is probable that, after reaching adult years, they go on\r\ngrowing, though slowly, and that they live to forty or fifty years. The\r\nDyaks tell of old Orangs, which have not only lost all their teeth, but\r\nwhich find it so troublesome to climb, that they maintain themselves on\r\nwindfalls and juicy herbage.\r\n\r\nThe Orang is sluggish, exhibiting none of that marvellous activity\r\ncharacteristic of the Gibbons. Hunger alone seems to stir him to\r\nexertion, and when it is stilled, he relapses into repose. When the\r\nanimal sits, it curves its back and bows its head, so as to look\r\nstraight down on the ground; sometimes it holds on with its hands by\r\na higher branch, sometimes lets them hang phlegmatically down by its\r\nside--and in these positions the Orang will remain, for hours together,\r\nin the same spot, almost without stirring, and only now and then giving\r\nutterance to its deep, growling voice. By day, he usually climbs from\r\none tree-top to another, and only at night descends to the ground, and\r\nif then threatened with danger, he seeks refuge among the underwood.\r\nWhen not hunted, he remains a long time in the same locality, and\r\nsometimes stops for many days on the same tree--a firm place among its\r\nbranches serving him for a bed. It is rare for the Orang to pass the\r\nnight in the summit of a large tree, probably because it is too windy\r\nand cold there for him; but, as soon as night draws on, he descends from\r\nthe height and seeks out a fit bed in the lower and darker part, or\r\nin the leafy top of a small tree, among which he prefers Nibong Palms,\r\nPandani, or one of those parasitic Orchids which give the primeval\r\nforests of Borneo so characteristic and striking an appearance. But\r\nwherever he determines to sleep, there he prepares himself a sort of\r\nnest: little boughs and leaves are drawn together round the selected\r\nspot, and bent crosswise over one another; while to make the bed soft,\r\ngreat leaves of Ferns, of Orchids, of 'Pandanus fascicularis', 'Nipa\r\nfruticans', etc., are laid over them. Those which Muller saw, many of\r\nthem being very fresh, were situated at a height of ten to twenty-five\r\nfeet above the ground, and had a circumference, on the average, of\r\ntwo or three feet. Some were packed many inches thick with 'Pandanus'\r\nleaves; others were remarkable only for the cracked twigs, which, united\r\nin a common centre, formed a regular platform. \"The rude 'hut',\" says\r\nSir James Brooke, \"which they are stated to build in the trees, would be\r\nmore properly called a seat or nest, for it has no roof or cover of any\r\nsort. The facility with which they form this nest is curious, and I had\r\nan opportunity of seeing a wounded female weave the branches together\r\nand seat herself, within a minute.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dyaks the Orang rarely leaves his bed before the sun\r\nis well above the horizon and has dissipated the mists. He gets up about\r\nnine, and goes to bed again about five; but sometimes not till late in\r\nthe twilight. He lies sometimes on his back; or, by way of change, turns\r\non one side or the other, drawing his limbs up to his body, and resting\r\nhis head on his hand. When the night is cold, windy, or rainy, he\r\nusually covers his body with a heap of 'Pandanus', 'Nipa', or Fern\r\nleaves, like those of which his bed is made, and he is especially\r\ncareful to wrap up his head in them. It is this habit of covering\r\nhimself up which has probably led to the fable that the Orang builds\r\nhuts in the trees.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Orang resides mostly amid the boughs of great trees, during\r\nthe daytime, he is very rarely seen squatting on a thick branch,\r\nas other apes, and particularly the Gibbons, do. The Orang, on the\r\ncontrary, confines himself to the slender leafy branches, so that he\r\nis seen right at the top of the trees, a mode of life which is closely\r\nrelated to the constitution of his hinder limbs, and especially to\r\nthat of his seat. For this is provided with no callosities, such as are\r\npossessed by many of the lower apes, and even by the Gibbons; and those\r\nbones of the pelvis, which are termed the ischia, and which form the\r\nsolid framework of the surface on which the body rests in the sitting\r\nposture, are not expanded like those of the apes which possess\r\ncallosities, but are more like those of man.\r\n\r\nAn Orang climbs so slowly and cautiously, [20] as, in this act, to\r\nresemble a man more than an ape, taking great care of his feet, so that\r\ninjury of them seems to affect him far more than it does other apes.\r\nUnlike the Gibbons, whose forearms do the greater part of the work,\r\nas they swing from branch to branch, the Orang never makes even the\r\nsmallest jump. In climbing, he moves alternately one hand and one foot,\r\nor, after having laid fast hold with the hands, he draws up both feet\r\ntogether. In passing from one tree to another, he always seeks out a\r\nplace where the twigs of both come close together, or interlace. Even\r\nwhen closely pursued, his circumspection is amazing: he shakes the\r\nbranches to see if they will bear him, and then bending an overhanging\r\nbough down by throwing his weight gradually along it, he makes a bridge\r\nfrom the tree he wishes to quit to the next. [21]\r\n\r\nOn the ground the Orang always goes laboriously and shakily, on all\r\nfours. At starting he will run faster than a man, though he may soon be\r\novertaken. The very long arms which, when he runs, are but little bent,\r\nraise the body of the Orang remarkably, so that he assumes much the\r\nposture of a very old man bent down by age, and making his way along by\r\nthe help of a stick. In walking, the body is usually directed straight\r\nforward, unlike the other apes, which run more or less obliquely;\r\nexcept the Gibbons, who in these, as in so many other respects, depart\r\nremarkably from their fellows.\r\n\r\nThe Orang cannot put its feet flat on the ground, but is supported upon\r\ntheir outer edges, the heel resting more on the ground, while the curved\r\ntoes partly rest upon the ground by the upper side of their first joint,\r\nthe two outermost toes of each foot completely resting on this surface.\r\nThe hands are held in the opposite manner, their inner edges serving as\r\nthe chief support. The fingers are then bent out in such a manner that\r\ntheir foremost joints, especially those of the two innermost fingers,\r\nrest upon the ground by their upper sides, while the point of the free\r\nand straight thumb serves as an additional fulcrum.\r\n\r\nThe Orang never stands on its hind legs, and all the pictures,\r\nrepresenting it as so doing, are as false as the assertion that it\r\ndefends itself with sticks, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe long arms are of especial use, not only in climbing, but in the\r\ngathering of food from boughs to which the animal could not trust his\r\nweight. Figs, blossoms, and young leaves of various kinds, constitute\r\nthe chief nutriment of the Orang; but strips of bamboo two or three\r\nfeet long were found in the stomach of a male. They are not known to eat\r\nliving animals.\r\n\r\nAlthough, when taken young, the Orang-Utan soon becomes domesticated,\r\nand indeed seems to court human society, it is naturally a very wild and\r\nshy animal, though apparently sluggish and melancholy. The Dyaks\r\naffirm, that when the old males are wounded with arrows only, they will\r\noccasionally leave the trees and rush raging upon their enemies, whose\r\nsole safety lies in instant flight, as they are sure to be killed if\r\ncaught. [22]\r\n\r\nBut, though possessed of immense strength, it is rare for the Orang to\r\nattempt to defend itself, especially when attacked with fire-arms. On\r\nsuch occasions he endeavours to hide himself, or to escape along the\r\ntopmost branches of the trees, breaking off and throwing down the boughs\r\nas he goes. When wounded he betakes himself to the highest attainable\r\npoint of the tree, and emits a singular cry, consisting at first of\r\nhigh notes, which at length deepen into a low roar, not unlike that of a\r\npanther. While giving out the high notes the Orang thrusts out his lips\r\ninto a funnel shape; but in uttering the low notes he holds his mouth\r\nwide open, and at the same time the great throat bag, or laryngeal sac,\r\nbecomes distended.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Dyaks, the only animal the Orang measures his strength\r\nwith is the crocodile, who occasionally seizes him on his visits to the\r\nwater side. But they say that the Orang is more than a match for his\r\nenemy, and beats him to death, or rips up his throat by pulling the jaws\r\nasunder!\r\n\r\nMuch of what has been here stated was probably derived by Dr. Muller\r\nfrom the reports of his Dyak hunters; but a large male, four feet high,\r\nlived in captivity, under his observation, for a month, and receives a\r\nvery bad character.\r\n\r\n\"He was a very wild beast,\" says Muller, \"of prodigious strength, and\r\nfalse and wicked to the last degree. If any one approached he rose up\r\nslowly with a low growl, fixed his eyes in the direction in which he\r\nmeant to make his attack, slowly passed his hand between the bars of his\r\ncage, and then extending his long arm, gave a sudden grip--usually at\r\nthe face.\" He never tried to bite (though Orangs will bite one another),\r\nhis great weapons of offence and defence being his hands.\r\n\r\nHis intelligence was very great; and Muller remarks, that though the\r\nfaculties of the Orang have been estimated too highly, yet Cuvier, had\r\nhe seen this specimen, would not have considered its intelligence to be\r\nonly a little higher than that of the dog.\r\n\r\nHis hearing was very acute, but the sense of vision seemed to be less\r\nperfect. The under lip was the great organ of touch, and played a very\r\nimportant part in drinking, being thrust out like a trough, so as\r\neither to catch the falling rain, or to receive the contents of the half\r\ncocoa-nut shell full of water with which the Orang was supplied, and\r\nwhich, in drinking, he poured into the trough thus formed.\r\n\r\nIn Borneo the Orang-Utan of the Malays goes by the name of \"Mias\" among\r\nthe Dyaks, who distinguish several kinds as 'Mias Pappan', or 'Zimo',\r\n'Mias Kassu', and 'Mias Rambi'. Whether these are distinct species,\r\nhowever, or whether they are mere races, and how far any of them are\r\nidentical with the Sumatran Orang, as Mr. Wallace thinks the Mias Pappan\r\nto be, are problems which are at present undecided; and the variability\r\nof these great apes is so extensive, that the settlement of the question\r\nis a matter of great difficulty. Of the form called \"Mias Pappan,\"\r\nMr. Wallace [23] observes, \"It is known by its large size, and by the\r\nlateral expansion of the face into fatty protuberances, or ridges, over\r\nthe temporal muscles, which has been mis-termed 'callosities', as they\r\nare perfectly soft, smooth, and flexible. Five of this form, measured\r\nby me, varied only from 4 feet 1 inch to 4 feet 2 inches in height, from\r\nthe heel to the crown of the head, the girth of the body from 3 feet to\r\n3 feet 7 1/2 inches, and the extent of the outstretched arms from 7 feet\r\n2 inches to 7 feet 6 inches; the width of the face from 10 to 13\r\n1/4 inches. The colour and length of the hair varied in different\r\nindividuals, and in different parts of the same individual; some\r\npossessed a rudimentary nail on the great toe, others none at all; but\r\nthey otherwise present no external differences on which to establish\r\neven varieties of a species.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, when we examine the crania of these individuals, we find\r\nremarkable differences of form, proportion, and dimension, no two being\r\nexactly alike. The slope of the profile, and the projection of the\r\nmuzzle, together with the size of the cranium, offer differences as\r\ndecided as those existing between the most strongly marked forms of the\r\nCaucasian and African crania in the human species. The orbits vary in\r\nwidth and height, the cranial ridge is either single or double, either\r\nmuch or little developed, and the zygomatic aperture varies considerably\r\nin size. This variation in the proportions of the crania enables\r\nus satisfactorily to explain the marked difference presented by the\r\nsingle-crested and double-crested skulls, which have been thought to\r\nprove the existence of two large species of Orang. The external surface\r\nof the skull varies considerably in size, as do also the zygomatic\r\naperture and the temporal muscle; but they bear no necessary relation to\r\neach other, a small muscle often existing with a large cranial surface,\r\nand 'vice versa'. Now, those skulls which have the largest and strongest\r\njaws and the widest zygomatic aperture, have the muscles so large that\r\nthey meet on the crown of the skull, and deposit the bony ridge which\r\nsupports them, and which is the highest in that which has the\r\nsmallest cranial surface. In those which combine a large surface with\r\ncomparatively weak jaws, and small zygomatic aperture, the muscles, on\r\neach side, do not extend to the crown, a space of from l to 2 inches\r\nremaining between them, and along their margins small ridges are formed.\r\nIntermediate forms are found, in which the ridges meet only in the\r\nhinder part of the skull. The form and size of the ridges are therefore\r\nindependent of age, being sometimes more strongly developed in the less\r\naged animal. Professor Temminck states that the series of skulls in the\r\nLeyden Museum shows the same result.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace observed two male adult Orangs (Mias Kassu of the Dyaks),\r\nhowever, so very different from any of these that he concludes them to\r\nbe specifically distinct; they were respectively 3 feet 8 1/2 inches\r\nand 3 feet 9 1/2 inches high, and possessed no sign of the cheek\r\nexcrescences, but otherwise resembled the larger kinds. The skull has\r\nno crest, but two bony ridges, 1 3/4 inches to 2 inches apart, as in\r\nthe 'Simia morio' of Professor Owen. The teeth, however; are immense,\r\nequalling or surpassing those of the other species. The females of both\r\nthese kinds, according to Mr. Wallace, are devoid of excrescences, and\r\nresemble the smaller males, but are shorter by 1 1/2 to 3 inches, and\r\ntheir canine teeth are comparatively small, subtruncated and dilated\r\nat the base, as in the so-called 'Simia morio', which is, in all\r\nprobability, the skull of a female of the same species as the\r\nsmaller males. Both males and females of this smaller species are\r\ndistinguishable, according to Mr. Wallace, by the comparatively large\r\nsize of the middle incisors of the upper jaw.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, no one has attempted to dispute the accuracy of\r\nthe statements which I have just quoted regarding the habits of the two\r\nAsiatic man-like Apes; and if true, they must be admitted as evidence,\r\nthat such an Ape--\r\n\r\n    Firstly, May readily move along the ground in the erect, or\r\n    semi-erect, position, and without direct support from its arms.\r\n\r\n    Secondly, That it may possess an extremely loud voice, so loud as to\r\n    be readily heard one or two miles.\r\n\r\n    Thirdly, That it may be capable of great viciousness and violence\r\n    when irritated: and this is especially true of adult males.\r\n\r\n    Fourthly, That it may build a nest to sleep in.\r\n\r\nSuch being well established facts respecting the Asiatic Anthropoids,\r\nanalogy alone might justify us in expecting the African species to offer\r\nsimilar peculiarities, separately or combined; or, at any rate, would\r\ndestroy the force of any attempted 'a priori' argument against such\r\ndirect testimony as might be adduced in favour of their existence. And,\r\nif the organization of any of the African Apes could be demonstrated to\r\nfit it better than either of its Asiatic allies for the erect position\r\nand for efficient attack, there would be still less reason for doubting\r\nits occasional adoption of the upright attitude or of aggressive\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Tyson and Tulpius downwards, the habits of the young\r\nCHIMPANZEE in a state of captivity have been abundantly reported and\r\ncommented upon. But trustworthy evidence as to the manners and customs\r\nof adult anthropoids of this species, in their native woods, was almost\r\nwanting up to the time of the publication of the paper by Dr. Savage,\r\nto which I have already referred; containing notes of the observations\r\nwhich he made, and of the information which he collected from sources\r\nwhich he considered trustworthy, while resident at Cape Palmas, at the\r\nnorth-western limit of the Bight of Benin.\r\n\r\nThe adult Chimpanzees measured by Dr. Savage, never exceeded, though the\r\nmales may almost attain, five feet in height.\r\n\r\n\"When at rest, the sitting posture is that generally assumed. They\r\nare sometimes seen standing and walking, but when thus detected,\r\nthey immediately take to all fours, and flee from the presence of the\r\nobserver. Such is their organization that they cannot stand erect, but\r\nlean forward. Hence they are seen, when standing, with the hands clasped\r\nover the occiput, or the lumbar region, which would seem necessary to\r\nbalance or ease of posture.\r\n\r\n\"The toes of the adult are strongly flexed and turned inwards, and\r\ncannot be perfectly straightened. In the attempt the skin gathers into\r\nthick folds on the back, shewing that the full expansion of the foot,\r\nas is necessary in walking, is unnatural. The natural position is on all\r\nfours, the body anteriorly resting upon the knuckles. These are greatly\r\nenlarged, with the skin protuberant and thickened like the sole of the\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\"They are expert climbers, as one would suppose from their organization.\r\nIn their gambols they swing from limb to limb to a great distance, and\r\nleap with astonishing agility. It is not unusual to see the 'old\r\nfolks' (in the language of an observer) sitting under a tree regaling\r\nthemselves with fruit and friendly chat, while their 'children' are\r\nleaping around them, and swinging from tree to tree with boisterous\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n\"As seen here, they cannot be called 'gregarious', seldom more than\r\nfive, or ten at most, being found together. It has been said, on good\r\nauthority, that they occasionally assemble in large numbers, in gambols.\r\nMy informant asserts that he saw once not less than fifty so engaged;\r\nhooting, screaming, and drumming with sticks upon old logs, which is\r\ndone in the latter case with equal facility by the four extremities.\r\nThey do not appear ever to act on the offensive, and seldom, if ever\r\nreally, on the defensive. When about to be captured, they resist by\r\nthrowing their arms about their opponent, and attempting to draw him\r\ninto contact with their teeth.\" (Savage, l. c. p. 384.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to this last point Dr. Savage is very explicit in another\r\nplace: \"Biting\" is their principal art of defence. I have seen one man\r\nwho had been thus severely wounded in the feet.\r\n\r\n\"The strong development of the canine teeth in the adult would seem\r\nto indicate a carnivorous propensity; but in no state save that of\r\ndomestication do they manifest it. At first they reject flesh, but\r\neasily acquire a fondness for it. The canines are early developed, and\r\nevidently designed to act the important part of weapons of defence. When\r\nin contact with man almost the first effort of the animal is--'to bite'.\r\n\r\n\"They avoid the abodes of men, and build their habitations in trees.\r\nTheir construction is more that of 'nests' than 'huts', as they have\r\nbeen erroneously termed by some naturalists. They generally build not\r\nfar above the ground. Branches or twigs are bent, or partly broken,\r\nand crossed, and the whole supported by the body of a limb or a crotch.\r\nSometimes a nest will be found near the 'end' of a 'strong leafy branch'\r\ntwenty or thirty feet from the ground. One I have lately seen that could\r\nnot be less than forty feet, and more probably it was fifty. But this is\r\nan unusual height.\r\n\r\n\"Their dwelling-place is not permanent, but changed in pursuit of food\r\nand solitude, according to the force of circumstances. We more often\r\nsee them in elevated places; but this arises from the fact that the\r\nlow grounds, being more favourable for the natives' rice-farms, are the\r\noftener cleared, and hence are almost always wanting in suitable trees\r\nfor their nests.... It is seldom that more than one or two nests are\r\nseen upon the same tree, or in the same neighbourhood: five have been\r\nfound, but it was an unusual circumstance.\"...\r\n\r\n\"They are very filthy in their habits.... It is a tradition with the\r\nnatives generally here, that they were once members of their own\r\ntribe; that for their depraved habits they were expelled from all\r\nhuman society, and, that through an obstinate indulgence of their\r\nvile propensities, they have degenerated into their present state and\r\norganization. They are, however, eaten by them, and when cooked with the\r\noil and pulp of the palm-nut considered a highly palatable morsel.\r\n\r\n\"They exhibit a remarkable degree of intelligence in their habits, and,\r\non the part of the mother, much affection for their young. The second\r\nfemale described was upon a tree when first discovered, with her mate\r\nand two young ones (a male and a female). Her first impulse was to\r\ndescend with great rapidity, and make off into the thicket, with her\r\nmate and female offspring. The young male remaining behind, she soon\r\nreturned to the rescue. She ascended and took him in her arms, at which\r\nmoment she was shot, the ball passing through the forearm of the young\r\none, on its way to the heart of the mother....\r\n\r\n\"In a recent case, the mother, when discovered, remained upon the tree\r\nwith her offspring, watching intently the movements of the hunter. As he\r\ntook aim, she motioned with her hand, precisely in the manner of a human\r\nbeing, to have him desist and go away. When the wound has not proved\r\ninstantly fatal, they have been known to stop the flow of blood by\r\npressing with the hand upon the part, and when this did not succeed, to\r\napply leaves and grass.... When shot, they give a sudden screech, not\r\nunlike that of a human being in sudden and acute distress.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary voice of the Chimpanzee, however, is affirmed to be hoarse,\r\nguttural, and not very loud, somewhat like \"whoo-whoo.\" (l. c. p. 365).\r\n\r\nThe analogy of the Chimpanzee to the Orang, in its nest-building habit\r\nand in the mode of forming its nest, is exceedingly interesting; while,\r\non the other hand, the activity of this ape, and its tendency to bite,\r\nare particulars in which it rather resembles the Gibbons. In extent of\r\ngeographical range, again, the Chimpanzees--which are found from Sierra\r\nLeone to Congo--remind one of the Gibbons, rather than of either of the\r\nother man-like apes; and it seems not unlikely that, as is the case with\r\nthe Gibbons, there may be several species spread over the geographical\r\narea of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe same excellent observer, from whom I have borrowed the preceding\r\naccount of the habits of the adult Chimpanzee, published fifteen years\r\nago, [24] an account of the GORILLA, which has, in its most essential\r\npoints, been confirmed by subsequent observers, and to which so very\r\nlittle has really been added, that in justice to Dr. Savage I give it\r\nalmost in full.\r\n\r\n\"It should be borne in mind that my account is based upon the statements\r\nof the aborigines of that region (the Gaboon). In this connection,\r\nit may also be proper for me to remark, that having been a missionary\r\nresident for several years, studying, from habitual intercourse, the\r\nAfrican mind and character, I felt myself prepared to discriminate and\r\ndecide upon the probability of their statements. Besides, being familiar\r\nwith the history and habits of its interesting congener ('Trog. niger',\r\nGeoff.), I was able to separate their accounts of the two animals,\r\nwhich, having the same locality and a similarity of habit, are\r\nconfounded in the minds of the mass, especially as but few--such as\r\ntraders to the interior and huntsmen--have ever seen the animal in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--The Gorilla (after Wolff).]\r\n\r\n\"The tribe from which our knowledge of the animal is derived, and whose\r\nterritory forms its habitat, is the 'Mpongwe', occupying both banks of\r\nthe River Gaboon, from its mouth to some fifty or sixty miles upward....\r\n\r\n\"If the word 'Pongo' be of African origin, it is probably a corruption\r\nof the word 'Mpongwe', the name of the tribe on the banks of the Gaboon,\r\nand hence applied to the region they inhabit. Their local name for the\r\nChimpanzee is 'Enche-eko', as near as it can be Anglicized, from which\r\nthe common term 'Jocko' probably comes. The Mpongwe appellation for its\r\nnew congener is 'Enge-ena', prolonging the sound of the first vowel, and\r\nslightly sounding the second.\r\n\r\n\"The habitat of the 'Enge-ena' is the interior of lower Guinea, whilst\r\nthat of the 'Enche-eko' is nearer the sea-board.\r\n\r\n\"Its height is about five feet; it is disproportionately broad across\r\nthe shoulders, thickly covered with coarse black hair, which is said to\r\nbe similar in its arrangement to that of the 'Enche-eko'; with age it\r\nbecomes grey, which fact has given rise to the report that both animals\r\nare seen of different colours.\r\n\r\n\"'Head'.--The prominent features of the head are, the great width and\r\nelongation of the face, the depth of the molar region, the branches\r\nof the lower jaw being very deep and extending far backward, and the\r\ncomparative smallness of the cranial portion; the eyes are very large,\r\nand said to be like those of the Enche-eko, a bright hazel; nose broad\r\nand flat, slightly elevated towards the root; the muzzle broad, and\r\nprominent lips and chin, with scattered gray hairs; the under lip highly\r\nmobile, and capable of great elongation when the animal is enraged, then\r\nhanging over the chin; skin of the face and ears naked, and of a dark\r\nbrown, approaching to black.\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable feature of the head is a high ridge, or crest of\r\nhair, in the course of the sagittal suture, which meets posteriorily\r\nwith a transverse ridge of the same, but less prominent, running round\r\nfrom the back of one ear to the other. The animal has the power of\r\nmoving the scalp freely forward and back, and when enraged is said to\r\ncontract it strongly over the brow, thus bringing down the hairy\r\nridge and pointing the hair forward, so as to present an indescribably\r\nferocious aspect.\r\n\r\n\"Neck short, thick, and hairy; chest and shoulders very broad, said to\r\nbe fully double the size of the Enche-ekos; arms very long, reaching\r\nsome way below the knee--the fore-arm much the shortest; hands very\r\nlarge, the thumbs much larger than the fingers....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Gorilla walking (after Wolff).]\r\n\r\n\"The gait is shuffling; the motion of the body, which is never upright\r\nas in man, but bent forward, is somewhat rolling, or from side to side.\r\nThe arms being longer than the Chimpanzee, it does not stoop as much in\r\nwalking; like that animal, it makes progression by thrusting its arms\r\nforward, resting the hands on the ground, and then giving the body a\r\nhalf jumping half swinging motion between them. In this act it is\r\nsaid not to flex the fingers, as does the Chimpanzee, resting on its\r\nknuckles, but to extend them, making a fulcrum of the hand. When it\r\nassumes the walking posture, to which it is said to be much inclined, it\r\nbalances its huge body by flexing its arms upward.\r\n\r\n\"They live in bands, but are not so numerous as the Chimpanzees: the\r\nfemales generally exceed the other sex in number. My informants all\r\nagree in the assertion that but one adult male is seen in a band; that\r\nwhen the young males grow up, a contest takes place for mastery, and the\r\nstrongest, by killing and driving out the others, establishes himself as\r\nthe head of the community.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Savage repudiates the stories about the Gorillas carrying off women\r\nand vanquishing elephants and then adds:\r\n\r\n\"Their dwellings, if they may be so called, are similar to those of\r\nthe Chimpanzee, consisting simply of a few sticks and leafy branches,\r\nsupported by the crotches and limbs of trees: they afford no shelter,\r\nand are occupied only at night.\r\n\r\n\"They are exceedingly ferocious, and always offensive in their habits,\r\nnever running from man, as does the Chimpanzee. They are objects of\r\nterror to the natives, and are never encountered by them except on\r\nthe defensive. The few that have been captured were killed by elephant\r\nhunters and native traders, as they came suddenly upon them while\r\npassing through the forests.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that when the male is first seen he gives a terrific yell,\r\nthat resounds far and wide through the forest, something like kh-ah!\r\nkh-ah! prolonged and shrill. His enormous jaws are widely opened at each\r\nexpiration, his under lip hangs over the chin, and the hairy ridge\r\nand scalp are contracted upon the brow, presenting an aspect of\r\nindescribable ferocity.\r\n\r\n\"The females and young, at the first cry, quickly disappear. He then\r\napproaches the enemy in great fury, pouring out his horrid cries in\r\nquick succession. The hunter awaits his approach with his gun extended:\r\nif his aim is not sure, he permits the animal to grasp the barrel, and\r\nas he carries it to his mouth (which is his habit) he fires. Should the\r\ngun fail to go off, the barrel (that of the ordinary musket, which is\r\nthin) is crushed between his teeth, and the encounter soon proves fatal\r\nto the hunter.\r\n\r\n\"In the wild state, their habits are in general like those of the\r\n'Troglodytes niger', building their nests loosely in trees, living\r\non similar fruits, and changing their place of resort from force of\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Savage's observations were confirmed and supplemented by those of\r\nMr. Ford, who communicated an interesting paper on the Gorilla to\r\nthe Philadelphian Academy of Sciences, in 1852. With respect to the\r\ngeographical distribution of this greatest of all the man-like Apes, Mr.\r\nFord remarks:\r\n\r\n\"This animal inhabits the range of mountains that traverse the interior\r\nof Guinea, from the Cameroon in the north, to Angola in the south, and\r\nabout 100 miles inland, and called by the geographers Crystal Mountains.\r\nThe limit to which this animal extends, either north or south, I am\r\nunable to define. But that limit is doubtless some distance north of\r\nthis river [Gaboon]. I was able to certify myself of this fact in a late\r\nexcursion to the head-waters of the Mooney (Danger) River, which comes\r\ninto the sea some sixty miles from this place. I was informed (credibly,\r\nI think) that they were numerous among the mountains in which that river\r\nrises, and far north of that.\r\n\r\n\"In the south, this species extends to the Congo River, as I am told by\r\nnative traders who have visited the coast between the Gaboon and that\r\nriver. Beyond that, I am not informed. This animal is only found at\r\na distance from the coast in most cases, and, according to my best\r\ninformation, approaches it nowhere so nearly as on the south side of\r\nthis river, where they have been found within ten miles of the sea.\r\nThis, however, is only of late occurrence. I am informed by some of the\r\noldest Mpongwe men that formerly he was only found on the sources of the\r\nriver, but that at present he may be found within half-a-day's walk of\r\nits mouth. Formerly he inhabited the mountainous ridge where Bushmen\r\nalone inhabited, but now he boldly approaches the Mpongwe plantations.\r\nThis is doubtless the reason of the scarcity of information in years\r\npast, as the opportunities for receiving a knowledge of the animal have\r\nnot been wanting; traders having for one hundred years frequented this\r\nriver, and specimens, such as have been brought here within a year,\r\ncould not have been exhibited without having attracted the attention of\r\nthe most stupid.\"\r\n\r\nOne specimen Mr. Ford examined weighed 170 lbs., without the thoracic,\r\nor pelvic, viscera, and measured four feet four inches round the chest.\r\nThis writer describes so minutely and graphically the onslaught of the\r\nGorilla--though he does not for a moment pretend to have witnessed the\r\nscene--that I am tempted to give this part of his paper in full, for\r\ncomparison with other narratives:\r\n\r\n\"He always rises to his feet when making an attack, though he approaches\r\nhis antagonist in a stooping posture.\r\n\r\n\"Though he never lies in wait, yet, when he hears, sees, or scents\r\na man, he immediately utters his characteristic cry, prepares for an\r\nattack, and always acts on the offensive. The cry he utters resembles\r\na grunt more than a growl, and is similar to the cry of the Chimpanzee,\r\nwhen irritated, but vastly louder. It is said to be audible at a great\r\ndistance. His preparation consists in attending the females and young\r\nones, by whom he is usually accompanied, to a little distance. He,\r\nhowever, soon returns, with his crest erect and projecting forward,\r\nhis nostrils dilated, and his under-lip thrown down; at the same time\r\nuttering his characteristic yell, designed, it would seem, to terrify\r\nhis antagonist. Instantly, unless he is disabled by a well directed\r\nshot, he makes an onset, and, striking his antagonist with the palm of\r\nhis hands, or seizing him with a grasp from which there is no escape, he\r\ndashes him upon the ground, and lacerates him with his tusks.\r\n\r\n\"He is said to seize a musket, and instantly crush the barrel between\r\nhis teeth.... This animal's savage nature is very well shown by the\r\nimplacable desperation of a young one that was brought here. It was\r\ntaken very young, and kept four months, and many means were used to tame\r\nit; but it was incorrigible, so that it bit me an hour before it died.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ford discredits the house-building and elephant-driving stories, and\r\nsays that no well-informed natives believe them. They are tales told to\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nI might quote other testimony to a similar effect, but, as it appears to\r\nme, less carefully weighed and sifted, from the letters of MM. Franquet\r\nand Gautier Laboullay, appended to the memoir of M. I. G. St. Hilaire,\r\nwhich I have already cited.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind what is known regarding the Orang and the Gibbon, the\r\nstatements of Dr. Savage and Mr. Ford do not appear to me to be justly\r\nopen to criticism on 'a priori' grounds. The Gibbons, as we have seen,\r\nreadily assume the erect posture, but the Gorilla is far better fitted\r\nby its organization for that attitude than are the Gibbons: if the\r\nlaryngeal pouches of the Gibbons, as is very likely, are important\r\nin giving volume to a voice which can be heard for half a league, the\r\nGorilla, which has similar sacs, more largely developed, and whose\r\nbulk is fivefold that of a Gibbon, may well be audible for twice\r\nthat distance. If the Orang fights with its hands, the Gibbons and\r\nChimpanzees with their teeth, the Gorilla may, probably enough,\r\ndo either or both; nor is there anything to be said against either\r\nChimpanzee or Gorilla building a nest, when it is proved that the\r\nOrang-Utan habitually performs that feat.\r\n\r\nWith all this evidence, now ten to fifteen years old, before the world\r\nit is not a little surprising that the assertions of a recent traveller,\r\nwho, so far as the Gorilla is concerned, really does very little more\r\nthan repeat, on his own authority, the statements of Savage and of Ford,\r\nshould have met with so much and such bitter opposition. If subtraction\r\nbe made of what was known before, the sum and substance of what M. Du\r\nChaillu has affirmed as a matter of his own observation respecting the\r\nGorilla, is, that, in advancing to the attack, the great brute beats his\r\nchest with his fists. I confess I see nothing very improbable, or very\r\nmuch worth disputing about, in this statement.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other man-like Apes of Africa, M. Du Chaillu tells\r\nus absolutely nothing, of his own knowledge, regarding the common\r\nChimpanzee; but he informs us of a bald-headed species or variety, the\r\n'nschiego mbouve', which builds itself a shelter, and of another rare\r\nkind with a comparatively small face, large facial angle, and peculiar\r\nnote, resembling \"Kooloo.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Orang shelters itself with a rough coverlet of leaves, and the\r\ncommon Chimpanzee, according to that eminently trustworthy observer\r\nDr. Savage, makes a sound like \"Whoo-whoo,\"--the grounds of the summary\r\nrepudiation with which M. Du Chaillu's statements on these matters have\r\nbeen met are not obvious.\r\n\r\nIf I have abstained from quoting M. Du Chaillu's work, then, it is\r\nnot because I discern any inherent improbability in his assertions\r\nrespecting the man-like Apes; nor from any wish to throw suspicion\r\non his veracity; but because, in my opinion, so long as his narrative\r\nremains in its present state of unexplained and apparently inexplicable\r\nconfusion, it has no claim to original authority respecting any subject\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nIt may be truth, but it is not evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: REGNUM CONGO: hoc est VERA DESCRIPTIO REGNI AFRICANI\r\nQUOD TAM AB INCOLIS QUAM LUSITANIS CONGUS APPELLATUR, per Philippum\r\nPigafettam, olim ex Edoardo Lopez acroamatis lingua Italica excerpta,\r\nnum Latio sermone donata ab August.

Mr. Spencer St. John, however, in his 'Life\r\nin the Forests of the Far East', tells us of an Orang of \"5 ft. 2 in.,\r\nmeasuring fairly from the head to the heel,\" 15 in. across the face, and\r\n12 in. round the wrist.

I never observed the slightest attempt at defence, and the wood\r\nwhich sometimes rattled about our ears was broken by their weight, and\r\nnot thrown, as some persons represent. If pushed to extremity, however,\r\nthe 'Pappan' could not be otherwise than formidable, and one unfortunate\r\nman, who, with a party, was trying to catch a large one alive, lost two\r\nof his fingers, besides being severely bitten on the face, whilst the\r\nanimal finally beat off his pursuers and escaped.\" Mr. Wallace, on the\r\nother hand, affirms that he has several times observed them throwing\r\ndown branches when pursued. \"It is true he does not throw them 'at' a\r\nperson, but casts them down vertically; for it is evident that a bough\r\ncannot be thrown to any distance from the top of a lofty tree. In one\r\ncase a female Mias, on a durian tree, kept up for at least ten minutes a\r\ncontinuous shower of branches and of the heavy, spined fruits, as large\r\nas 32-pounders, which most effectually kept us clear of the tree she\r\nwas on. She could be seen breaking them off and throwing them down with\r\nevery appearance of rage, uttering at intervals a loud pumping grunt,\r\nand evidently meaning mischief.\"--\"On the Habits of the Orang-Utan,\"\r\n'Annals of Nat.
