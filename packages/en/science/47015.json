Five times during that\r\nperiod Mars has approached the earth within suitable scanning distance\r\nand been subjected to careful and prolonged scrutiny. Familiarity with\r\nthe subject, improved telescopic means, and long-continued training\r\nhave all combined to increased efficiency in the procuring of data and\r\nto results which have been proportionate. A mass of new material has\r\nthus been collected,—some of it along old lines, some of it in lines\r\nthat are themselves new,—and both have led to the same outcome. In\r\naddition to thus pushing inquiry into advanced portions of the subject,\r\nstudy has been spent in investigation of the reality of the phenomena\r\nupon which so much is based, and in testing every theory which has been\r\nsuggested to account for them. From diplopia to optical interference,\r\neach of these has been examined and found incompatible with the\r\nobservations. The phenomena are all they have been stated to be, and\r\nmore. Each step forward in observation has confirmed the genuineness of\r\nthose that went before.\r\n\r\nTo set forth science in a popular, that is, in a generally\r\nunderstandable, form is as obligatory as to present it in a more\r\ntechnical manner. If men are to benefit by it, it must be expressed to\r\ntheir comprehension. To do this should be feasible for him who is\r\nmaster of his subject and is both the best test of, and the best\r\ntraining to, that post. Especially vital is it that the exposition\r\nshould be done at first hand; for to describe what a man has himself\r\ndiscovered comes as near as possible to making a reader the\r\nco-discoverer of it. Not only are thus escaped the mistaken glosses of\r\nsecond-hand knowledge, but an aroma of actuality, which cannot be\r\nfiltered through another mind without sensible evaporation, clings to\r\nthe account of the pioneer. Nor is it so hard to make any well-grasped\r\nmatter comprehensible to a man of good general intelligence as is\r\ncommonly supposed. The whole object of science is to synthesize, and so\r\nsimplify; and did we but know the uttermost of a subject we could make\r\nit singularly clear. Meanwhile technical phraseology, useful as\r\nshorthand to the cult, becomes meaningless jargon to the uninitiate and\r\nis paraded most by the least profound. But worse still for their employ\r\nsymbols tend to fictitious understanding. Formulæ are the anæsthetics\r\nof thought, not its stimulants; and to make any one think is far better\r\nworth while than cramming him with ill-considered, and therefore\r\nindigestible, learning.\r\n\r\nEven to the technical student, a popular book, if well done, may yield\r\nmost valuable results. For nothing in any branch of science is so\r\nlittle known as its articulation,—how the skeleton of it is put\r\ntogether, and what may be the mode of attachment of its muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n     PREFACE                                                      vii\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\n                            NATURAL FEATURES\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER\r\n\r\n     I.

The leaving familiar sights and faces to push forth into the\r\nunknown has with magnetic force drawn the bold to great endeavor and\r\nfired the thought of those who stayed at home. Spur to enterprise since\r\nman first was, this spirit has urged him over the habitable globe.\r\nLinked in part to mere matter of support it led the more daring of the\r\nAryans to quit the shade of their beech trees, reposeful as that\r\numbrage may have been, and wander into Central Asia, so to perplex\r\nphilologists into believing them to have originated there; it lured\r\nColumbus across the waste of waters and caused his son to have carved\r\nupon his tomb that ringing couplet of which the simple grandeur still\r\nstirs the blood:—\r\n\r\n                  Á CASTILLA Y Á LEON\r\n                  NUEVO MONDO DIÓ COLON;\r\n\r\n                  (To Castile and Leon beyond the wave\r\n                  Another world Columbus gave;)\r\n\r\nit drove the early voyagers into the heart of the vast wilderness,\r\nthere to endure all hardship so that they might come where their kind\r\nhad never stood before; and now it points man to the pole.\r\n\r\nSomething of the selfsame spirit finds a farther field today outside\r\nthe confines of our traversable earth. Science which has caused the\r\nworld to shrink and dwindle has been no less busy bringing near what in\r\nthe past seemed inaccessibly remote. Beyond our earth man’s penetration\r\nhas found it possible to pierce, and in its widening circle of research\r\nhas latterly been made aware of another world of strange enticement\r\nacross the depths of space. Planetary distances, not mundane ones, are\r\nhere concerned, and the globe to be explored, though akin to, is yet\r\nvery different from, our own. This other world is the planet Mars.\r\nSundered from us by the ocean of ether, a fellow-member of our own\r\ncommunity of matter there makes its circuit of the sun upon whose face\r\nfeatures show which stamp it as cognate to that on which we live. In\r\nspite of the millions of miles of intervening matterless void, upon it\r\nmarkings can be made out that distantly resemble our earth’s topography\r\nand grow increasingly suggestive as vision shapes them better; and yet\r\namong the seemingly familiar reveal aspects which are completely\r\nstrange. But more than this: over the face of it sweep changes that\r\nshow it to be not a dead but a living world, like ours in this, and\r\nluring curiosity by details unknown here to further exploration of its\r\nunfamiliar ground.\r\n\r\nTo observe Mars is to embark upon this enterprise; not in body but in\r\nmind. Though parted by a gulf more impassable than any sea, the\r\ntelescope lets us traverse what otherwise had been barred and lands us\r\nat last above the shores we went forth to seek. Real the journey is,\r\nthough incorporeal in kind. Since the seeing strange sights is the\r\nessence of all far wanderings, it is as truly travel so the eye arrive\r\nas if the body kept it company. Indeed, sight is our only far viatic\r\nsense. Touch and taste both hang on contact, smell stands indebted to\r\nthe near and even hearing waits on ponderable matter where sound soon\r\ndissipates away; only sight soars untrammeled of the grosser adjunct of\r\nthe flesh to penetrate what were otherwise unfathomable space.\r\n\r\nWhat the voyager thus finds himself envisaging shares by that very fact\r\nin the expansion of the sense that brought him there. No longer tied by\r\nmeans of transport to seas his sails may compass or lands his feet may\r\ntread, the traveler reaches a goal removed in kind from his own\r\nhabitat. He proves to have adventured, not into unknown parts of a\r\nknown world, but into one new to him in its entirety. In extent alone\r\nhe surveys what dwarfs the explorer’s conquests on Earth. But size is\r\nthe least of the surprises there in store for him. What confronts his\r\ngaze finds commonly no counterpart on Earth. His previous knowledge\r\nstands him in scant stead. For he faces what is so removed from every\r\nday experience that analogy no longer offers itself with safety as a\r\nguide. He must build up new conceptions from fresh data and slowly\r\nproceed to deduce the meaning they may contain. Science alone can help\r\nhim to interpretation of what he finds, and above all must he wean\r\nhimself from human prejudice and earthbound limitation. For he deals\r\nhere with ultramundane things. With just enough of cosmogony in common\r\nto make decipherment not despairable this world is yet so different\r\nfrom the one he personally knows as to whet curiosity at every turn. He\r\nis permitted to perceive what piques inquiry and by patient adding of\r\npoint to point promises at last a rational result.\r\n\r\nLike mundane exploration, it is arduous too; _ad astra per aspera_ is\r\nhere literally true. For it is a journey not devoid of hardship and\r\ndiscomfort by the way. Its starting-point preludes as much. To get\r\nconditions proper for his work the explorer must forego the haunts of\r\nmen and even those terrestrial spots found by them most habitable.\r\nAstronomy now demands bodily abstraction of its devotee. Its deities\r\nare gods that veil themselves amid man-crowded marts and impose\r\nwithdrawal and seclusion for the prosecution of their cult as much as\r\nany worshiped for other reason in more primeval times. To see into the\r\nbeyond requires purity; in the medium now as formerly in the man. As\r\nlittle air as may be and that only of the best is obligatory to his\r\nenterprise, and the securing it makes him perforce a hermit from his\r\nkind. He must abandon cities and forego plains. Only in places raised\r\nabove and aloof from men can he profitably pursue his search, places\r\nwhere nature never meant him to dwell and admonishes him of the fact by\r\nsundry hints of a more or less distressing character. To stand a mile\r\nand a half nearer the stars is not to stand immune.\r\n\r\nThus it comes about that today besides its temples erected in cities,\r\nmonasteries in the wilds are being dedicated to astronomy as in the\r\npast to faith; monasteries made to commune with its spirit, as temples\r\nare to communicate the letter of its law. Pioneers in such profession,\r\nthose already in existence are but the precursors of many yet to come\r\nas science shall more and more recognize their need. Advance in\r\nknowledge demands what they alone can give. Primitive, too, they must\r\nbe as befits the still austere sincerity of a cult, in which the\r\nsimplest structures are found to be the best.\r\n\r\nStill the very wildness of the life their devotee is forced to lead has\r\nin it a certain fittingness for his post in its primeval detachment\r\nfrom the too earthbound, in concept as in circumstance. Withdrawn from\r\ncontact with his kind, he is by that much raised above human prejudice\r\nand limitation. To sally forth into the untrod wilderness in the cold\r\nand dark of a winter’s small hours of the morning, with the snow feet\r\ndeep upon the ground and the frosty stars for mute companionship, is\r\nalmost to forget one’s self a man for the solemn awe of one’s\r\nsurroundings. Fitting portal to communion with another world, it is\r\nthrough such avenue one enters on his quest where the common and\r\nfamiliar no longer jostle the unknown and the strange. Nor is the\r\nstillness of the stars invaded when some long unearthly howl, like the\r\nwail of a lost soul, breaks the slumber of the mesa forest, marking the\r\nprowling presence of a stray coyote. Gone as it came, it dies in the\r\ndistance on the air that gave it birth; and the gloom of the pines\r\nswallows up one’s vain peering after something palpable, their tops\r\nalone decipherable in dark silhouette against the sky. From amid\r\nsurroundings that for their height and their intenancy fringe the\r\nabsolute silence of space the observer must set forth who purposes to\r\ncross it to another planetary world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hermitage_]\r\n\r\nBut the isolation of his journey is not always so forbidding. His\r\ncoming back is no less girt with grandeur of a different though equally\r\ndetached a kind. Even before the stars begin to dim in warning to him\r\nto return, a faint suffusion as of half-suspected light creeps into the\r\nborder of the eastern sky. Against it, along the far pine-clad horizon,\r\nmesa after mesa in shaggy lines of sentineling earth, stands forth dark\r\nmarshaled in the gloom, informed with prescience of what is soon to\r\ncome. Imperceptibly the pallor grows, blanching the face of night and\r\none by one extinguishing the stars. Slowly then it takes on color,\r\ntingeing ever so faintly to a flush that swells and deepens as the\r\nminutes pass. One had said the sky lay dreaming of the sun in pale\r\nimagery at first that gathers force and feeling till the dreamer turns\r\nthus rosy red in slumbering supposition of reality. Then the blush dies\r\nout. The crimson fades to pink, the pink to ashes. The stars have\r\ndisappeared and yet it is not day. It is the supreme moment of the\r\ndawn, the hush with which the Earth awaits its full awakening. For now\r\nagain the color gathers in the east, not with the impalpable suffusion\r\nit had before but nearer and more vivid. No longer reflectively remote,\r\nrays imminent of the sun strike the upper air, the most adventurously\r\nrefrangible turning the underside of a few stray clouds into flame-hued\r\nbars of glowing metal. They burn thus in the silent east first red,\r\nthen orange, and then gold, each spectral tint in prismatic revelation\r\ncoming to join the next till in a sudden blinding burst of splendor the\r\nsolar disk tops the horizon’s rim.\r\n\r\nNot less impressive is the journey when the afternoon watch has\r\nreplaced the morning vigil by the drawing of the planet nearer to the\r\nsun. Lost in the brilliance of the dazzling sky, the planet lies hid\r\nfrom the senses’ search. The quest were hopeless did not the mind guide\r\nthe telescope to its goal. To theory alone is it visible still, and so\r\nto its predicted place the observer sets his circles, and punctual to\r\nthe prophecy the planet swings into the field of view. One must be\r\ndulled by long routine to such mastery of mind not to have the act\r\nitself clothe with a sense of charmed withdrawal the object of his\r\nquest.\r\n\r\nSo much and more there are of traveler’s glimpses by the way,\r\ncompensation that offsets the frequent discomfort, and even balking of\r\nhis purpose by inopportune cloud. For the best of places is not\r\nperfect, and a storm will sometimes rob him of a region he wished to\r\nsee. He must learn to wait upon his opportunities and then no less to\r\nwait for mankind’s acceptance of his results; for in common with most\r\nexplorers he will encounter on his return that final penalty of\r\npenetration, the certainty at first of being disbelieved.\r\n\r\nIn such respect he will be even worse off than were the other world\r\ndiscoverers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. For they at least\r\ncould offer material proof of things that they had seen. Dumb Indians\r\nand gold spoke more convincingly than the lips of the great navigators.\r\nTo astronomy, too, that other world was due. Without a knowledge of the\r\nearth’s shape and size got from Francisco of Pisa, Columbus had never\r\nadventured himself upon the deep. But more than this, an astronomer it\r\nwas, in the person of Americus Vespucius, who first discovered the new\r\nworld, by recognizing it as such; Columbus never dreaming he had\r\nlighted upon a world that was new. Nor does it impair one jot or tittle\r\nof his glory that he knew it not. Nothing can deprive him of the\r\nimperishable fame of launching forth into the void in hope of a beyond,\r\nthough he found not what he sought but something stranger still.\r\n\r\nSo, curiously, has it been with the trans-etherian. To Schiaparelli the\r\nrepublic of science owes a new and vast domain. His genius first\r\ndetected those strange new markings on the Martian disk which have\r\nproved the portal to all that has since been seen, and his courage in\r\nthe face of universal condemnation led to exploration of them. He made\r\nthere voyage after voyage, much as Columbus did on Earth, with even\r\nless of recognition from home. As with Columbus, too, the full import\r\nof his great discovery lay hid even to him and only by discoveries\r\nsince is gradually resulting in recognition of another sentient world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           A DEPARTURE-POINT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the character of the travel is distinctive, so the outcome of the\r\nvoyage is unique. If he choose his departure-point aright, the observer\r\nwill be vouchsafed an experience without parallel on Earth. To select\r\nthis setting-out station is the first step in the journey upon which\r\neverything depends. For it is essential to visual arrival that a\r\ndeparture-point be taken where definition is at its best. Now, so far\r\nas our present knowledge goes, the conditions most conducive to good\r\nseeing turn out to lie in one or other of the two great desert belts\r\nthat girdle the globe. Many of us are unaware of the existence of such\r\nbelts and yet they are among the most striking features of physical\r\ngeography. Could we get off our globe and view it from without we\r\nshould mark two sash-like bands of country, to the poleward side of\r\neither tropic, where the surface itself lay patently exposed. Unclothed\r\nof verdure themselves they would stand forth doubly clear by contrast.\r\nFor elsewhere cloud would hide to a greater or less extent the actual\r\nconfiguration of the Earth’s topography to an observer scanning it from\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nOne of these sash-like belts of desert runs through southern\r\nCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, the Sahara, Arabia Petræa and the\r\nDesert of Gobi; the other traverses Peru, the South African veldt, and\r\nWestern Australia. They are desert because in them rain is rare; and\r\neven clouds seldom form. In a twofold way they conduce to astronomic\r\nends. Absence of rain makes primarily for clear skies and secondarily\r\nfor steady air; and the one of these conditions is no less vital to\r\nsight than the other. Water vapor is a great upsetter of atmospheric\r\nequilibrium and commotion in the air the spoiler of definition. Thus\r\nfrom the cloudlessness of their skies man finds in them most chance of\r\nuninterrupted communion with the stars, while by suitably choosing his\r\nspot he here obtains as well that prime desideratum for planetary work,\r\nas near a heavenly equanimity in the air currents over his head as is\r\npractically possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that these regions are desert they are less frequented of\r\nman, and the observer is thus perforce isolated by the nature of the\r\ncase, the regions best adapted to mankind being the least suited to\r\nastronomic observations. In addition to what nature has thus done in\r\nthe matter, humanity has further differentiated the two classes of\r\nsights by processes of its own contriving. Not only is civilized man\r\nactively engaged in defacing such part of the Earth’s surface as he\r\ncomes in contact with, he is equally busy blotting out his sky. In the\r\nlatter uncommendable pursuit he has in the last quarter of a century\r\nmade surprising progress. With a success only too undesirable his\r\nhabitat has gradually become canopied by a welkin of his own\r\nfashioning, which has rendered it largely unfit for the more delicate\r\nkinds of astronomic work. Smoke from multiplying factories by rising\r\ninto the air and forming the nucleus about which cloud collects has\r\njoined with electric lighting to help put out the stars. These\r\nconcomitants of advancing civilization have succeeded above the dreams\r\nof the most earth-centred in shutting off sight of the beyond so that\r\ntoday few city-bred children have any conception of the glories of the\r\nheavens which made of the Chaldean shepherds astronomers in spite of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe old world and the new are alike affected by such obliteration. Long\r\nago London took the lead with fogs proverbial wholly due to smoke, fine\r\nparticles of solid matter in suspension making these points of\r\ncondensation about which water vapor gathers to form cloud. With the\r\nincrease of smoke-emitting chimneys over the world other centres of\r\npopulation have followed suit till today Europe and eastern North\r\nAmerica vie with each other as to which sky shall be the most\r\nobliterate. Even when the obscuration is not patent to the layman it is\r\nevident to the meteorologist or astronomer. By a certain dimming of the\r\nblue, smoke or dust reveals its presence high up aloft as telltalely as\r\nif the thing itself were visible. Some time since the writer had\r\noccasion to traverse Germany in summer from Göttingen to Cologne and in\r\nso doing was impressed by a cloudiness of the sky he felt sure had not\r\nexisted when he knew it as a boy. For the change was too startling and\r\nextensive to be wholly laid to the score of the brighter remembrances\r\nof youth. On reaching Cologne he mentioned his suspicion to Klein, only\r\nto find his own inference corroborated; observations made twenty years\r\nago being impracticable today. Two years later in Milan Celoria told\r\nthe same story, the study of Mars having ceased to be possible there\r\nfor like cause. Factory smoke and electric lights had combined to veil\r\nthe planet at about the time Schiaparelli gave up his observations\r\nbecause of failing sight. With a certain poetic fitness the sky had\r\nitself been blotted just at the time the master’s eye had dimmed.\r\n\r\nAmerica is not behind in this race for sky extinction. In the\r\nneighborhood of its great cities and spreading into the country round\r\nabout the heavens have ceased to be favorable to research. Not till we\r\npass beyond the Missouri do the stars shine out as they shone before\r\nthe white man came.\r\n\r\nFew astronomers even fully appreciate how much this means, so used does\r\nman get to slowly changing conditions. It amounts, indeed, between\r\nWashington and Arizona to a whole magnitude in the stars which may be\r\nseen. At the Naval Observatory of the former sixty-four stars were\r\nmapped in a region where with a slightly smaller glass one hundred and\r\nseventy-two were charted at Flagstaff.\r\n\r\nBesides their immediate use as observing stations these desert belts\r\npossess mediate interest on their own account in a branch of the very\r\nstudy their cloudlessness helps to promote, the branch here considered,\r\nthe study of the planet Mars. They help explain what they permit to be\r\nvisible. For in the physical history of the Earth’s development they\r\nare among the latest phenomena and mark the beginning of that stage of\r\nworld evolution into which Mars is already well advanced. They are\r\nsymptomatic of the passing of a terraqueous globe into a purely\r\nterrestrial one. Desertism, the state into which every planetary body\r\nmust eventually come and for which, therefore, it becomes necessary to\r\ncoin a word, has there made its first appearance upon the Earth.\r\nStanding as it does for the approach of age in planetary existence, it\r\nmay be likened to the first gray hairs in man. Or better still it\r\ncorresponds to early autumnal frost in the passage of the seasons. For\r\nthe beginning to age in a planet means not decrepitude in its\r\ninhabitants but the very maturing of this its fruit. Evolution of mind\r\nin its denizens continues long after desolation in their habitat has\r\nset in. Indeed, advance in brain-power seriously develops only when\r\nmaterial conditions cease to be bodily propitious and the loss of\r\ncorporeal facilities renders its acquisition necessary to life.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance, distant but distinctive, of the climatic conditions\r\nnecessary on earth for the best scanning of Mars with those which prove\r\nto be actually existent on that other world has a bearing on the\r\nsubject worth considerable attention. It helps directly to an\r\nunderstanding and interpretation of the Martian state of things. Though\r\npartial only, the features and traits of our arid zones are\r\nsufficiently like what prevails on Mars to make them in some sort\r\nexponent of physical conditions and action there. Much that is hard of\r\nappreciation in a low, humid land shows itself an everyday possibility\r\nin a high and dry one. The terrible necessity of water to all forms of\r\nlife, animal or vegetal, so that in the simple thought of the\r\naborigines rain is the only god worth great propitiation upon the due\r\nobservance of which everything depends, brings to one a deeper\r\nrealization of what is really vital and what but accessory at best. One\r\nbegins to conceive what must be the controlling principle of a world\r\nwhere water is only with difficulty to be had, and rain unknown.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the fundamental importance of water, the relative\r\nirrelevancy of some other conditions usually deemed indispensable to\r\norganic existence there find illustration too. On the high plateau of\r\nnorthern Arizona and on the still higher volcanic cones that rise from\r\nthem as a base into now disintegrating peaks, the thin cold air proves\r\nno bar to life. To the fauna there air is a very secondary\r\nconsideration to water, and because the latter is scarce in the\r\nlowlands and more abundant higher up, animals ascend after it, making\r\ntheir home at unusual elevations with no discomfort to themselves. Deer\r\nrange to heights where the barometric pressure is but three fifths that\r\nof their generic habitat. Bear do the like, the brown bear of northern\r\nAmerican sea-level being here met with two miles above it. Nor is\r\neither animal a depauperate form. Man himself contrives to live in\r\ncomfort and propagate his kind where at first he finds it hard to\r\nbreathe. Nor are these valiant exceptions; as Merriam has ably shown in\r\nhis account of the San Francisco peak region for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution—a most interesting report, by the way—the other animals\r\nare equally adaptive to the zones of more northern latitudes on the\r\nAmerican continent, zones paralleled in their flora and fauna by the\r\nzones of altitude up this peak. All which shows that paucity of air is\r\nnothing like the barrier to life we ordinarily suppose and is not for\r\nan instant to be compared with dearth of water. If in a comparatively\r\nshort time an animal or plant accustomed to thirty inches of barometric\r\npressure can contrive to subsist sensibly unchanged at eighteen, it\r\nwould be rash to set limits to what time may not do. And this the more\r\nfor another instructive fact discovered in this region by Merriam: that\r\nthe existence of a species was determined not by the mean temperature\r\nof its habitat but by the maximum temperature during the time of\r\nprocreation. A short warm season in summer alone decides whether the\r\nspecies shall survive and flourish; that it has afterward to hibernate\r\nfor six months at a time does not in the least negative the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The San Francisco Peaks_]\r\n\r\nThat the point of departure should thus prove of twofold importance,\r\nspeeding the observer on his journey and furnishing him with a _vade\r\nmecum_ on arrival, is as curious as opportune. Without such\r\nfurtherance, to the bodily eye on the one hand and the mind’s eye on\r\nthe other, the voyage were less conclusive in advent and less\r\nsatisfactory in attent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n              A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF PAST MARTIAN DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Mars discovery has from the start waited on apparent disk. To this\r\nend every optical advance has contributed from the time of Galileo’s\r\nopera-glass to the present day. For apparent distance stands determined\r\nby the size of the eye. But although it is the telescopic eye that has\r\nincreased, not the distance that has diminished, the effect has been\r\nkin to being carried nearer the planet and so to a scanning of its disk\r\nwith constantly increasing particularity. Mankind has to all intents\r\nand purposes been journeying Marsward through the years. Any historic\r\naccount of the planet, therefore, becomes a chronicle of seeming bodily\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no vivider way of making this evident and at the same time no\r\nbetter preface to the present work could be devised than by putting\r\nbefore the eye in orderly succession the maps made of Mars by the\r\nleading areographers of their day, since the planet first began to be\r\ncharted sixty-five years ago. The procedure is as much as possible like\r\nstanding at the telescope and seeing the phenomena steadily disclose.\r\n\r\nSeen thus in order the facts speak for themselves. They show that from\r\nfirst to last no doubt concerning what was seen existed in the minds of\r\nthose competent to judge by systematic study of the planet at first\r\nhand, and furthermore, from their mutual corroboration, that this\r\nconfidence was well placed. For, far from there being any conflict of\r\nauthorities in the case, those entitled to an opinion in the matter\r\nprove singularly at one.\r\n\r\nBeginning with Maedler in 1840 the gallery of such portraitures of the\r\nplanet comprises those by Kaiser, Green and Schiaparelli, continued\r\nsince Schiaparelli’s time by the earlier ones of the present writer. To\r\nthis list has been added one by Flammarion, which though not solely\r\nfrom his own work gives so just a representation of what was known at\r\nthe date, 1876, as to merit inclusion. The remarkable drawings of Dawes\r\nand the excellent ones of Lockyer in 1862-1864 were never combined into\r\nmaps by the observers, and though the former’s were so synthesized by\r\nProctor in 1867, the result was conformed to what Proctor thought ought\r\nto be and so is not really a transcript of the drawings themselves.\r\n\r\nEach of the maps presented marked in its day the point areography had\r\nreached; and each tells its own story better than any amount of text.\r\nThey are all made upon Mercator’s projection and omit in consequence\r\nthe circumpolar regions. The later ones give, too, only so much of the\r\nsurface as was shown at the opposition they record, for Mars, being\r\ntipped now one way, now another, regards the earth differently\r\naccording to its orbital position. In comparing them, therefore, the\r\nequator must be taken for medial line. Mercator’s projection has been\r\nthe customary one for portraying Mars except for such oppositions as\r\nchiefly disclose the arctic pole. And this, too, with a certain poetic\r\nfitness. For it comes by right of priority to delineation of a new\r\nworld; seeing that Mercator was the first to represent in a map the\r\nmundane new world in its entirety, by the rather important addition of\r\nNorth America to the southern continent already known, and to give the\r\nwhole the title America with ‘Ame’ at the top of the map and ‘rica’ at\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the maps it is to be remembered that they are what we\r\nshould call upside down, south standing at the top and north at the\r\nbottom. Inverted they show because this is the way the telescopic\r\nobserver always sees the planet. The disk would seem unnatural to\r\nastronomers were it duly righted. Just the same do men in the southern\r\nhemisphere look at our own Earth topsy-turvy according to our view, the\r\nSun being to the north of them and the cold to the south. Certain\r\nlandmarks distinguishable in all the maps may serve for specific\r\nintroduction. The V-shaped marking on the equator pointing to the north\r\nis the Syrtis Major, the first marking ever made out upon the planet\r\nand drawn by the great Huyghens in 1659. The isolated oval patch in\r\nlatitude 26° south is the Solis Lacus, the pupil of the eye of Mars;\r\nwhile the forked bay on the equator, discovered by Dawes, is the\r\nSabaeus Sinus, the dividing tongue of which, the Fastigium Aryn, has\r\nbeen taken for the origin of longitudes on Mars.\r\n\r\nTwelve maps go to make the series. They are as follows:—\r\n\r\n                            MAKER                    DATE\r\n                    I. Map of Beer and Maedler       1840\r\n                   II.

To no one will their\r\ninter-resemblance seem more salient than to draughtsmen themselves. For\r\nnone know better how surprisingly, even when two men have the same\r\nthing under their very noses to copy, their two versions will differ.\r\nJudgment of position and of relative size is one cause of variation;\r\nfocusing of the attention on different details another. What slight\r\ndiscrepancies affect the maps are traceable to these two human\r\nimperfections. Maps IV and V make a case in point: it was to his\r\nnew-found canals that Schiaparelli gave heed to the neglect of a due\r\ntoning of his map; while Green, less keen-eyed but more artistic,\r\nmissed the delicate canaliform detail to make a speaking portraiture of\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nAmid the remarkable continuity of progression here shown, in which each\r\nmap will be seen to be at once a review and an advance, we may,\r\nnevertheless, distinguish three stages in the perception of the\r\nphenomena. Thus we may mark:—\r\n\r\n  I. A period of recognition of larger markings\r\n       only;                                         1840-1877\r\n\r\n II. A period of detection of canals intersecting\r\n       the bright regions or lands;                  1877-1892\r\n\r\nIII. A period of detection of canals traversing\r\n       the ‘seas’ and of oases scattered over\r\n       the surface;                                  1892-1905\r\n\r\nEach period is here represented by four charts; and each expresses the\r\nresult of a more minute and intimate acquaintance with the disk than\r\nwas possible to the one that went before. To realize, however, how\r\naccurate each was according to his lights it is only necessary to have\r\nthe seeing grow steadily better some evening as one observes. He will\r\nfind himself recapitulating in his own person the course taken by\r\ndiscovery for all those who went before, and in the lapse of an hour\r\nlive through the observational experience of sixty years; in much the\r\nsame way that the embryological growth of an individual repeats the\r\ndevelopment historically of the race.\r\n\r\nTwo verses of Ovid, which the poet puts into the mouth of Pythagoras,\r\noutline with something like prophetic utterance the special discoveries\r\nwhich mark the three periods apart. Ovid makes Pythagoras say of the\r\nthen world:—\r\n\r\n            Vidi ego, quod fuerat quondam solidissima tellus\r\n            Esse fretum; vidi factas ex aequore terras;\r\n\r\n                                         —OVID, _Metamorphoses_ XV, 262.\r\n\r\n            (Where once was solid ground I’ve seen a strait;\r\n            Lands I’ve seen made from out the sea.)\r\n\r\nTrue as the verses are of Earth, the poet could not have penned them\r\notherwise had he meant to record the course of astronomic detection on\r\nMars. For they sound like a presentiment of the facts. A surface\r\nthought at first to be part land, part water; the land next seen to be\r\nseamed with straits; and lastly the sea made out to be land. Such is\r\nthe history of the subject, and words could not have summed it more\r\nsuccinctly. “Vidi ego, quod fuerat quondam solidissima tellus esse\r\nfretum” rings like Schiaparelli’s own announcement of the discovery of\r\nthe ‘canals.’ Indeed, I venture to believe he would have made it had he\r\nchanced to recall the verse. So “vidi factas ex aequore terras” tells\r\nwhat has since been learned of the character of the seas.\r\n\r\nOf the three periods the first was that of the main or fundamental\r\nmarkings only. It came in with Beer and Maedler, the inaugurators of\r\nareography. That they planned and executed their survey with but a\r\nfour-inch glass shows that there is always room for genius at the top\r\nof any profession and that instruments are not for everything in its\r\ninstrumentality. Up to their day the reality of the planet’s features\r\nhad been questioned by some people in spite of having been certainly\r\nseen and drawn by Huyghens and others. Beer and Maedler’s labors proved\r\nthem permanent facts beyond the possibility of dispute.\r\n\r\nThe second period was the period of the discovery of the now famous\r\ncanals,—a new era in the study of Mars opened by Schiaparelli in 1877\r\n(Map V). Unsuspicious of what he was to stumble on, he seized the then\r\nfavorable opposition to make, as he put it, a geodetic survey of the\r\nplanet’s surface. He hoped this undertaking feasible to the accuracy of\r\nmicrometric measurement. His hopes did not belie him. He found that it\r\nwas possible to measure his positions with sufficient exactness to make\r\na skeleton map on which to embody the markings in detail—and thus to\r\ngive his map vertebrate support. But in the course of his work he\r\nbecame aware of hitherto unrecognized ligaments connecting the seas\r\nwith one another. Instead of displaying a broad unity of face the\r\nbright areas appeared to be but groundwork for streaks. The streaks\r\ntraversed them in all directions, tesselating the continents into a\r\ntilework of islands. Such mosaic was not only new, but the fashion of\r\nthe thing was of a new order or kind. Straits, however, Schiaparelli\r\nconsidered them and gave them the name _canali_, or channels. How\r\nunfamiliar and seemingly impossible the new detail was is best\r\nevidenced by the prompt and unanimous disbelief with which it was met.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map I. Beer and Maedler, 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map II. Kaiser, 1864.\r\n\r\n(From Flammarion’s _Mars_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map III. Résumé by Flammarion, 1876.\r\n\r\n(From Flammarion’s _Mars_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map IV. Green, 1877.\r\n\r\n(From Flammarion’s _Mars_.)]\r\n\r\nUnmoved by the universal scepticism which rewarded what was to prove an\r\nepoch-making discovery, Schiaparelli went on, in the judgment of his\r\ncritics, from bad to worse—for in 1879 (Map VI) he took up again his\r\nscrutiny of the planet to the detecting of yet more particularity. He\r\nre-observed most of his old canals and discovered half as many more;\r\nand as his map shows he perceived an increased regularity in his lines.\r\n\r\nIn 1881-1882 (Map VII) he attacked the planet again and with results\r\nyet further out of the common. His lines were still there with more\r\nbeside. If they had looked strange before, they now appeared positively\r\nunnatural. Not content with a regularity which seemed to the sceptics\r\nto preclude their being facts, he must needs see them now in duplicate.\r\nTo the eyes of disbelief this was the crowning stroke of factitiousness.\r\n\r\nIn consequence no end of adverse criticism was heaped upon his\r\nobservations by those who could not see. But curiously enough,—what\r\ndid not attract attention,—the blindness of the critics was as much\r\nmental as bodily. For they failed to perceive that the very\r\nunnaturalness which seemed to them to discredit his observations really\r\nproved their genuineness. His discoveries were so amazing that any\r\nchange in strangeness simply went to confirm the universal scepticism\r\nand clouded logic. Yet properly viewed, a pregnant deduction stands\r\nforth quite clearly on a study of the maps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map V. Schiaparelli, 1877.\r\n\r\n(From Schiaparelli’s _Memoria_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map VI. Schiaparelli, 1879.\r\n\r\n(From Schiaparelli’s _Memoria_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map VII. Schiaparelli, 1881.\r\n\r\n(From Schiaparelli’s _Memoria_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map VIII. Schiaparelli, 1884.\r\n\r\n(From Schiaparelli’s _Memoria_.)]\r\n\r\nOn comparing maps V, VI and VII an eye duly directed is struck by a\r\ndifference in the aspect of the lines. In his first map the ‘canals’\r\nare depicted simply as narrow winding streaks, hardly even roughly\r\nregular and by no means such departures from the plausible as to lie\r\nwithout the communicatory pale. Indeed, to a modern reader prepared\r\nbeforehand for geometric construction they will probably appear no\r\n‘canals’ at all. Certainly the price of acceptance was not a large one\r\nto pay. But like that of the Sibylline Books it increased with putting\r\noff. What he offered the public in 1879 was much more dearly to be\r\nbought. The lines were straighter, narrower, and in every way less\r\nnatural than they had seemed two years before. In 1881-1882 they\r\nprogressed still more in unaccountability. They had now become regular\r\nrule and compass lines, as straight, as even, and as precise as any\r\ndraughtsman could wish and quite what astronomic faith did not desire.\r\nHaving thus donned the character, they nevermore put it off.\r\n\r\nNow, this curious evolution in depiction points, rightly viewed, to an\r\nabsence of design. It shows that Schiaparelli started with no\r\npreconceived idea on the subject. On the contrary, it is clear that he\r\nshared to begin with the prevailing hesitancy to accept anything out of\r\nthe ordinary. Nor did he overcome his reluctance except as by degrees\r\nhe was compelled. For the canals did not change their characteristics\r\nfrom one opposition to another; the eye it was that learned to\r\ndistinguish what it saw, and the brain made better report as it grew\r\nfamiliar with the messages sent it. In other words, it is patent from\r\nthese successive maps that the geometrical character of the ‘canals’\r\nwas forced upon Schiaparelli by the things themselves, instead of\r\nbeing, as his critics took for granted, foisted on them by him. We have\r\nsince seen the regularity of the canals so undeniably that we are not\r\nnow in need of such inferential support to help us to the truth; but\r\ntoo late, as it is, to be of controversial moment the deduction is none\r\nthe less of some corroboratory force.\r\n\r\nWith the third period enters what has been done since Schiaparelli’s\r\ntime. For that master was obliged, from failing sight, to close his\r\nwork with the opposition of 1890. In 1892 W. H. Pickering at Arequipa\r\nwas the chief observer of the planet and made two important\r\ndiscoveries: one was the detection of small round spots scattered over\r\nthe surface of the planet and connected with the canal system; the\r\nother the perception of what seemed to him more or less irregular lines\r\ntraversing the Mare Erythraeum. Both were notable detections. The first\r\nset of phenomena he called lakes, the second river-systems, sometimes\r\nschematically ‘canals,’ but without committing himself to canaliform\r\ncharacteristics as his drawings make clear. The same phenomena were\r\nseen at that opposition at the Lick, by Schaeberle, Barnard and others,\r\nand called streaks. These discoveries took from the _maria_ their\r\nsupposed character of seas—a most important event in knowledge of Mars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map IX. Lowell, 1894.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map X. Lowell, 1896.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map XI. Lowell, 1901.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map XII. Lowell, 1905.]\r\n\r\nThe next advance was the detection at Flagstaff in 1894 of their\r\ncanaliform characteristics by my then assistant Mr. Douglass, who in\r\nplace of the irregular streaks and river-systems of his predecessors\r\nfound the seas to be crossed by lines as regular and as regularly\r\nconnected as the canals in the light regions. To him they appeared\r\nbroad and ill defined, but so habitually did to him the canals in the\r\nlight areas, while for directness and uniformity the one set showed as\r\ngeometrically perfect as the other. All the dark _maria_ of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere he found to be laced with them and that they formed\r\na network over the dark regions, counterparting that over the light.\r\nStill more significant was the fact that their points of departure\r\ncoincided with the points of arrival of the bright-region canals, so\r\nthat the two connected to form in its entirety a single system. After\r\nthe publication of his results (Lowell Observatory Annals, Volume I,\r\n1895) Schiaparelli identified some of those in the Syrtis with what he\r\nhad himself seen there in 1888 (_Memoria_, VI, 1899), though his own\r\nhad not been sufficiently well seen of him to impress him as canals.\r\n\r\nOf other additions to our knowledge since made by the writer the\r\npresent book treats; as also of the theory they originally suggested to\r\nhim and which his later observations have only gone to confirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                             THE POLAR CAPS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as magnification gives Mars a disk that disk shows\r\nmarkings, white spots crowning a globe spread with blue-green patches\r\non an orange ground. The smallest telescope is capable of this far-off\r\nrevelation; while with increased power the picture grows steadily more\r\narticulate and full. With a two and a quarter inch glass the writer saw\r\nthem thirty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nAfter the assurance that markings exist the next thing to arrest\r\nattention is that these markings move. The patches of color first made\r\nout by the observer are shortly found by him to have shifted in place\r\nupon the planet. And this not through mistake on his part but through\r\nmethod in the phenomena; for all do it alike. In orderly rotation the\r\nfeatures make their appearance upon the body’s righthand limb (in the\r\ntelescopic image), travel across the central meridian of the disk and\r\nvanish over its lefthand border. One follows another, each rising,\r\nculminating and setting in its turn under the observer’s gaze. A\r\nconstantly progressing panorama passes majestically before his sight,\r\nnew objects replacing the old with a march so steady and withal so\r\nswift that a few minutes will suffice to mark unmistakably the fact of\r\nsuch procession. But for all this ceaseless turning under his gaze,\r\nafter a certain lapse of time it is evident that the same features are\r\nbeing shown him over again. With such recognition of recurrence comes\r\nthe first advance toward acquaintance with the Martian world. For that\r\nin all their journeying their configuration alters not, proves them\r\npermanent in place, part and parcel of the solid surface of that other\r\nglobe. This surface, then, lies exposed to view and by its turning\r\nshows itself subject, like our earth, to the vicissitudes of day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn such self-exposure Mars differs from all the four great planets,\r\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Features, indeed, are apparent on\r\nthe first two of these globes and dimly on the other two as well, but\r\nthey lack the stability of the Martian markings. They are forever\r\nexchanging place. In the case of Jupiter what we see is undoubtedly a\r\ncloud-envelop through which occasional glimpses may possibly be caught\r\nof a chaotic nucleus below. With Saturn it is the same; and the\r\nevidence is that the like is true of Uranus and Neptune. What goes on\r\nunder their great cloud canopies we can only surmise. With Mars,\r\nhowever, we are not left to imagination in the matter but so far as our\r\nmeans permit can actually observe what there takes place. Except for\r\ndistance, which, through science, year by year grows less, it is as if\r\nwe hovered above the planet in a balloon, with its various features\r\nspread out to our gaze below.\r\n\r\nAttention shows these areographic features to be on hand with punctual\r\nprecision for their traverse of the disk once every twenty-four hours\r\nand thirty-seven minutes. For over two hundred years this has been the\r\ncase, their untiring revolutions having been watched so well that we\r\nknow the time they take to the nicety of a couple of hundredths of a\r\nsecond. We thus become possessed of a knowledge of the length of the\r\nMartian day and it is not a little interesting to find that it very\r\nclosely counterparts in duration our own, being only one thirty-fifth\r\nthe longer of the two. We also find from the course the markings pursue\r\nthe axis about which they turn; and just as the period of the rotation\r\ntells us the length of the Martian day so the tilt of the axis, taken\r\nin connection with the form of the orbit, determines the character of\r\nthe Martian seasons. Here again we confront a curious resemblance in\r\nthe circumstances of the two planets, for the tilt of the equator to\r\nthe plane of the orbit is with Mars almost precisely what it is for the\r\nEarth. The more carefully the two are measured the closer the\r\nsimilitude becomes. Sir William Herschel made the Martian 28°,\r\nSchiaparelli reduced this to 25°, and later determination by the writer\r\nputs it nearer 24°. The latter is the one now adopted in the British\r\nNautical Almanac for observers of the planet. This is a very close\r\nparallelism indeed; so that in general character the Martian seasons\r\nare nearly the counterpart of ours. In length, however, they differ;\r\nfirst because the year of Mars is almost double the length of the\r\nterrestrial one and secondly because from the greater ellipticity of\r\nMars’ orbit the seasons are more unequal than is the case with us, some\r\nbeing run through with great haste, others being lingered on a\r\ndisproportionate time. It is usual on the Earth to consider spring as\r\nthe period from the vernal equinox, about March 21, to the summer\r\nsolstice, about June 20; summer as lasting thence to the autumnal\r\nequinox; autumn from this latter date, about September 20, to the\r\nwinter solstice on December 21; and winter from that point on to the\r\nnext spring equinox again. On this division our seasons in the northern\r\nhemisphere last respectively: spring, 91 days; summer, 92 days; autumn,\r\n92 days; and winter, 90 days. On Mars these become, reckoned in our\r\ndays: spring, 199 days; summer 183 days; autumn, 147 days; and winter,\r\n158 days. If we had counted them in Martian days they would have\r\ntotaled about one thirty-fifth less in number each.\r\n\r\nIn its days and seasons, then, Mars is wonderfully like the Earth;\r\nexcept for the length of the year we should hardly know the difference\r\nin reckoning of time could we some morning wake up there instead of\r\nhere. Only in one really unimportant respect should we feel strange; in\r\nmonths we should find ourselves turned topsy-turvy. But lunations have\r\nnothing to do with climate nor with the alternation between night and\r\nday; and in these two important respects we should certainly feel at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThough the axis could be determined by the daily march of any marking\r\nand thus the planet’s tropic, temperate and polar regions marked out,\r\nthe process is made easier by the presence of white patches covering\r\nthe planet’s poles and known, in consequence, as the polar caps. It is\r\nfrom measures of the patches that the position of the Martian poles has\r\nactually been determined. These polar caps are exactly analogous in\r\ngeneral position to those which bonnet our own Earth. They reproduce\r\nthe appearance of the ice and snow of our arctic and antarctic regions\r\nseen from space, in a very remarkable manner. In truth they are things\r\nof note in more ways than one and would claim precedence on many\r\ncounts. Priority of recognition, however, alone entitles them to\r\npremier consideration. Among the very first of the disk’s detail to be\r\nmade out by man, they justly demand description first.\r\n\r\nWith peculiar propriety the polar caps have thus the _pas_. Not only do\r\nthey stand first in order of visibility, but they prove to occupy a\r\nlike position logically when it comes to an explanation of the planet’s\r\npresent physical state. It is not matter of hazard that the most\r\nevident of all the planet’s markings should also be the most\r\nfundamental, the fountainhead from which everything else flows. It is\r\nof the essence of the planet’s condition and furnishes the key to its\r\ncomprehension. The steps leading to this conclusion are as interesting\r\nas they are cogent. They start at the polar caps’ visibility. For their\r\nsize first riveted man’s attention and then attention to them disclosed\r\nthat most vital of the characteristics of the planet’s surface: change.\r\n\r\nJust as almost all of the features we note are permanent in place,\r\nshowing that they belong to the surface, so are they all impermanent in\r\ncharacter. Change is the only absolutely unchanging thing except\r\nposition about the features the planet presents to view. It was in the\r\naspect of the polar caps that this important fact first came to light.\r\nNot only did they thus initially instance a general law, they have\r\nturned out to make it; for by themselves changing they largely cause\r\nchange in all the rest. But for a long time they alone exemplified its\r\nworkings. To Sir William Herschel we owe the first study of their\r\nchange in aspect. This eminent observer noted that their varying size\r\nwas subject to a regular rhythmic wax and wane timed to the course of\r\nthe seasons of the planet’s year. The caps increased in the winter of\r\ntheir hemisphere and decreased in its summer and being situate in\r\nopposite hemispheres they did this alternately with pendulum-like\r\nprecision. His observations were soon abundantly confirmed, for the\r\nphenomena take place upon a vast scale and are thus easy of\r\nrecognition. At their maximum spread the caps cover more than one\r\nhundred times as much ground as when they have shrunk to their minimum.\r\nIn the depth of winter they stretch over much more than the polar zone,\r\ncoming down to 60° and even 50° of latitude north or south as the case\r\nmay be, thence melting till by midsummer they span only five or six\r\ndegrees across.\r\n\r\nIn this they bear close analogue to the behavior of our own. Ours would\r\nshow not otherwise were they viewed from the impersonal standpoint of\r\nspace. Very little telescopic aid suffices to disclose the Martian\r\npolar phenomena in this their more salient characteristics and convince\r\nan observer of their likeness to those of the earth. Any one may note\r\nwhat is there going on by successive observations of the planet with a\r\nthree-inch glass. Nor is the change by any means slow. A few days at\r\nthe proper Martian season, or at most a couple of weeks, produces\r\nconspicuous and conclusive alterations in the size of these nightcaps\r\nof the planet’s winter sleep. Resembling our own so well they were\r\nearly surmised to be of like constitution and composed, therefore, of\r\nice and snow. Plausible on its face, this view of them was generally\r\nadopted and common sense has held to it ever since. It has encountered,\r\nof course, opposition, partly from very proper conservatism, but\r\nchiefly from that earth-centred philosophy which has doubted most\r\nadvances since Galileo’s time, and carbonic acid has been put forward\r\nby this school of sceptics to take its place. We shall critically\r\nexamine both objections; the latter first, because a certain physical\r\nfact enables us to dispose of it at once. In casual appearance there is\r\nnot much to choose between the rival candidates of common sense and\r\nuncommon subtlety, water and frozen carbonic acid gas, both being\r\nsuitably white and both going and coming with the temperature. But,\r\nupon closer study, in one point of behavior the two substances act\r\nquite unlike, and had half the ingenuity been expended in testing the\r\ntheory as in broaching it this fact had come to light to the suggestors\r\nas it did upon examination to the writer and had served as a touchstone\r\nin the case. At pressures of anything like one atmosphere or less\r\ncarbonic acid passes at once from the solid to the gaseous state.\r\nWater, on the other hand, lingers in the intermediate stage of a\r\nliquid. Now, as the Martian cap melts it shows surrounded by a deep\r\nblue band which accompanies it in its retreat, shrinking to keep pace\r\nwith the shrinkage in the cap. This is clearly the product of the\r\ndisintegration since it waits so studiously upon it. The substance\r\ncomposing the cap, then, does not pass instantaneously or anything like\r\nit from the solid to the gaseous condition.\r\n\r\nThis badge of blue ribbon about the melting cap, therefore,\r\nconclusively shows that carbonic acid is not what we see and leaves us\r\nwith the only alternative we know of: water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                       BEHAVIOR OF THE POLAR CAPS\r\n\r\n\r\nAssured by physical properties that our visual appearances are quite\r\ncapable of being what they seem we pass to the phenomena of the cap\r\nitself. Like as are the polar caps of the two planets at first regard,\r\nupon further study very notable differences soon disclose themselves\r\nbetween the earthly and the Martian ones; and these serve to give us\r\nour initial hint of a different state of things over there from that\r\nwith which we are conversant on Earth.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the limits between which they fluctuate are out of all\r\nproportion greater on Mars. It is not so much in their maxima that the\r\nice-sheets of the two planets vary. Our own polar caps are much larger\r\nthan we think; indeed, we live in them a good fraction of the time. Our\r\nwinter snows are in truth nothing but part and parcel of the polar cap\r\nat that season. Now, in the northern hemisphere snow covers the ground\r\nat sea-level more or less continuously down to 50° of latitude. It\r\nstretches thus far even on the western flanks of the continents, while\r\nin the middle of them and on their eastern sides it extends ten degrees\r\nfarther yet during the depth of winter. So that we have a polar cap\r\nwhich is then ninety degrees across. In our southern hemisphere it is\r\nmuch the same six months later, in the corresponding winter of its year.\r\n\r\nOn Mars at their winter maxima the polar caps extend over a similar\r\nstretch of latitude. They do so, however, unequally. The southern one\r\nis considerably the larger. In 1903, 136 days after the winter\r\nsolstice, in the Martian calendar February 27, it came down in\r\nlongitude 225° to 44° of latitude and may be taken to have then\r\nmeasured ninety-three degrees across; in 1905, 121 days after the same\r\nsolstice, it stretched in longitude 235° to latitude 42°, and 158 days\r\nlater, in longitude 221° to latitude 41°; values which, supposing it to\r\nhave been round, imply for it a diameter on these occasions of\r\nninety-six and ninety-seven degrees. It was then February 20 and March\r\n10 respectively of the Martian year. These determinations of its size\r\nat the two oppositions agree sufficiently well considering the great\r\ntilt away from us of the south pole at the time and the horizonward\r\nforeshortening of the edge of the snow. It seems from a consensus of\r\nthe measures to have been some five degrees wider in 1903 than in 1905,\r\nwhich may mean a colder winter preceding the former date. The cap was\r\nstill apparently without a dark contour in both years, showing that it\r\nhad not yet begun to melt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: South Polar Cap.\r\n\r\n(Lowell Observatory, 1905.)]\r\n\r\nLess has been learnt of the northern cap. In 1896-1897 when it was\r\nsimilarly presented skirting the other rim of the disk, a gap occurred\r\nin the observations corresponding to the time by Martian months between\r\nFebruary 24 and March 22. On the former date the cap came down only to\r\nlatitude 55° in longitude 352°; on the subsequent one and for several\r\ndays after the latitude of the southern limit of the snow was such as\r\nto imply a breadth to it of about eighty degrees. The cap was now\r\nbordered by a dark line, proving that melting had already set in. It\r\ncannot, however, at its maximum have covered much more country than\r\nthis, in view of its lesser extent on February 24.\r\n\r\nFair as our knowledge now is of the dimensions of the Martian polar\r\ncaps at their maxima, we have much more accurate information with\r\nregard to their minima, and this, too, was obtained much earlier. That\r\nwe should first have known their smallest rather than their greatest\r\nextent with accuracy may appear surprising, exactly the opposite being\r\nour knowledge of our own. It is not, however, so surprising as it\r\nappears, inasmuch as it is an inevitable consequence of the planet’s\r\naspect with regard to the sun. When the tilt of the axis inclines one\r\nhemisphere toward the sun, that hemisphere’s polar cap must melt and\r\ndwindle, while at the same time it is the one best seen, the other\r\nbeing turned away from the sun and therefore largely from us as well;\r\nso that even such part of the latter as is illumined lies low down\r\ntoward the horizon of the disk where a slight change of angle means a\r\ngreat difference in size.\r\n\r\nIt has thus come about that both the south and the north polar caps\r\nhave been repeatedly well seen and measured at their minimum; and the\r\nmeasures for different Martian years agree well with one another. For\r\nthe northern cap six degrees in diameter is about the least value to\r\nwhich it shrinks. The south one becomes even smaller, being usually not\r\nmore than five degrees across, while in 1894 it actually vanished, a\r\nthing unprecedented. Its absence was detected by Douglass at Flagstaff\r\nand shortly after the announcement of its disappearance the fact was\r\ncorroborated by Barnard at the Lick. The position the cap would have\r\noccupied was at the time better placed for observation in America than\r\nin Europe, inasmuch as the cap is eccentrically situated with regard to\r\nthe geographic pole and its centre was then well on the side of the\r\ndisk presented to us while in Europe it was turned away. This, together\r\nwith the fact that it undoubtedly came and went more than once about\r\nthis time, accounts for its disappearance not having been recognized\r\nthere, haze left by it having apparently been mistaken for the cap\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North Polar Cap.\r\n\r\n(Lowell Observatory, 1905.)]\r\n\r\nOn Earth the minima are much larger. In the northern hemisphere the\r\nline of perpetual snow or pack-ice in longitude 50° east runs about on\r\nthe 80° parallel, including within it the southern end of Franz Joseph\r\nLand. Opposite this, in longitude 120° west, above the North American\r\ncontinent, it reaches down lower still to 75°. So that the cap is then\r\nfrom twenty to thirty degrees in diameter. In the southern hemisphere\r\nit is even larger. In longitude 170° west the land was found by Ross to\r\nbe under perpetual snow in latitude 72°. Cook had reached in longitude\r\n107° east an impassable barrier of ice in latitude 70° 23′. The season\r\nwas then midsummer, January 30. So that we are perhaps justified in\r\nconsidering 71° south as about the average limit of perpetual snow or\r\npaleocrystic ice. This would make the southern cap at its minimum\r\nthirty-eight degrees across. Pack-ice with open spots extends still\r\nfarther north. The Pagoda in 1845 was stopped by impenetrable pack-ice\r\nin south latitude 68° and the Challenger in 1874 encountered the pack\r\nin latitude 65° on the 19th of February, which corresponds about to our\r\n19th of August, the time at which the sea should be most open. The\r\nlimit of perpetual snow is thus lower in the southern than in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Here again, then, the two minima differ, but in\r\nthe reverse way from what they do on Mars.\r\n\r\nFrom this we perceive that the variations in size of the caps are much\r\nmore striking on Mars than on the Earth and that these are due chiefly\r\nto the difference in the minima, the maxima not varying greatly.\r\n\r\nTo explain these interesting diversities of behavior in the several\r\npolar caps we shall have to go back a little in general physics in\r\norder to get a proper take off. It is a curious concomitant of the law\r\nof gravity that the amount of heat received by a planet in passing from\r\nany point of its path to a point diametrically opposite is always the\r\nsame no matter what be the eccentricity of the orbit. Thus, a planet\r\nhas as many calories falling upon it in travelling from its vernal\r\nequinox to its autumnal as from the autumnal to the vernal again,\r\nalthough the time taken in the one journey be very different from that\r\nof the other. This is due to the fact that the angle swept over by the\r\nradius vector, that is, the imaginary bond between it and the sun, is\r\nat all points proportional to the amount of heat received; just as it\r\nis of the gravity undergone, the two forces radiating into space as the\r\ninverse square of the distance. Thus the heat received by a point or a\r\nhemisphere, through any orbital angle, is independent of the\r\neccentricity of the orbit.\r\n\r\nBut it is not independent of the axial tilt. For the force of the sun’s\r\nrays is modified by their obliquity. The amount of heat received at any\r\npoint in consequence of the tilt turns upon the position of the point,\r\nand for any hemisphere taken as a whole it depends upon the degree to\r\nwhich the pole is tilted to the source of heat. In consequence of being\r\nmore squarely presented to its beams, the hemisphere which is directed\r\ntoward the sun and therefore is passing through its summer season gets\r\nfar more insolation than that which is at the same time in the depth of\r\nits winter. For a tilt of twenty-four degrees, the present received\r\nvalue for the axis of Mars, the two hemispheres so circumstanced get\r\namounts of heat respectively in the proportion of sixty-three to\r\nthirty-seven.\r\n\r\nBut, though the summer and winter insolation thus differ, they are the\r\nsame for each hemisphere in turn. Consequently the mere amount of heat\r\nreceived cannot be the cause of any differences detected between the\r\nrespective maxima and minima of the two polar caps. If heat were a\r\nsubstance which could be stored up instead of being a mode of motion,\r\nthe effect produced would be in accordance with the quantity applied\r\nand the two caps would behave alike. As it is the total amount has very\r\nlittle to say in the matter.\r\n\r\nNot the amount of heat but the manner in which this heat is made at\r\nhome is responsible for the difference we observe. Now, though the\r\ntotal amount is the same in passing from the vernal to the autumnal\r\nequinox as from the autumnal to the vernal, the time during which it is\r\nreceived in either case varies from one hemisphere to the other. It is\r\nsummer in the former while it is winter in the latter and the\r\ndifference in the length of the two seasons due to the eccentricity of\r\nthe orbit makes a vast difference in the result. Winter affects the\r\nmaxima, summer the minima, attained. Of these opposite variations\r\npresented to us by the two caps, the maxima, the one most difficult to\r\ndetect, is the easiest to explain, for the difference in the maxima\r\nseems to be due to the surpassing length of the antarctic night.\r\n\r\nOwing to the eccentricity of the orbital ellipse pursued by Mars and to\r\nthe present position of the planet’s solstices, the southern hemisphere\r\nis farther away from the sun during its winter and is so for a longer\r\ntime. The seasons are in length, for the northern hemisphere: spring,\r\n199 days; summer, 183 days; autumn, 147 days; and winter, 158 days;\r\nwhile for the southern hemisphere they are: spring, 147 days; summer,\r\n158 days; autumn, 199 days; and winter, 183 days. The arctic polar\r\nnight is thus 305 of our days long; the antarctic, 382. Thus for 77\r\nmore days than happens to its fellow the southern pole never sees the\r\nsun. Now, since the total sunlight from equinox to equinox is the same\r\nin both hemispheres, its distribution by days must be different. In the\r\nsouthern hemisphere the same amount is crowded into a smaller compass\r\nin the proportion of 305 to 382; that being that hemisphere’s relative\r\nratio of days. But since during winter the cap increases, there is a\r\ndaily excess of accumulation over dissipation of snow and each\r\ntwenty-four hours must on the average add its tithe to the sum total.\r\nSince the northern days are the warmer each adds less than do the\r\nsouthern ones; and furthermore there are fewer of them. On both these\r\nscores the amount of the deposition about the northern pole should be\r\nless than about the southern one. Consequently, the snow-sheet there\r\nshould be the less extensive and show a relatively smaller maximum,\r\nwhich explains what we see.\r\n\r\nWith the minima the action is otherwise. Inasmuch as the greater heat\r\nreceived during the daylight hours by the southern hemisphere is\r\nexactly offset by the shortness of its season, it would seem at first\r\nas if there could be no difference in the total effect upon the two\r\nice-caps.\r\n\r\nBut further consideration discloses a couple of factors which might,\r\nand possibly do, come in to qualify the action and account for the\r\nobserved effect. One is that though the total amount of heat received\r\nis the same, the manner of its distribution differs in the two\r\nhemispheres. In the northern one the time from vernal to autumnal\r\nequinox is 382 days against 305 in the southern. Consequently, the\r\naverage daily heat is then five fourths more intense in the southern\r\nhemisphere. Indeed, it is even greater than this and nearer four\r\nthirds, because the melting occurs chiefly in the spring and in the\r\nfirst two months of summer when the contrast in length of season\r\nbetween the two hemispheres is at its greatest. Now, a few hotter days\r\nmight well work more result than many colder ones. And this would be\r\nparticularly true of Mars where the mean temperature is probably none\r\ntoo much above the freezing-point to start with. Ice consumes so much\r\ncaloric in the process of turning into any other state, laying it by in\r\nthe form of latent heat before it can turn into water and then so much\r\nmore before this water can be converted into steam that a good deal has\r\nto be expended on it before getting any perceptible result. Once\r\nobtained, however, the heat is retained with like tenacity. So that the\r\nprocess works to double effect! If sufficient heat be received the ice\r\nis first melted, then evaporated and finally formed into a layer of\r\nhumid air, the humidity of which keeps it warm. Dry air is unretentive\r\nof heat, moist air the opposite. And for the melting of the ice-cap to\r\nproceed most effectively the temperature that laps it about must be as\r\nhigh as possible and kept so as continuously as may be. If between days\r\nit be allowed to fall too low at night much caloric must needs be\r\nwasted in simply raising the ice again to the melting-point. This a\r\nblanket of warm air tends to prevent, and this again is brought about\r\nby a few hot days rather than by many colder ones. It is not all the\r\nheat received that becomes effective but the surplus heat above a\r\ncertain point. The gain in continuity of action thus brought about is\r\nsomewhat like that exhibited between the running of an express and an\r\naccommodation train. To reach its destination in a given time the\r\nformer requires far less power because it does not have to get up speed\r\nagain after each arrest. Thus the whole effect in melting the snow\r\nwould be greater upon that hemisphere whose summer happens to be the\r\nmore intense.\r\n\r\nThe greater swing in size of the cap most exposed to the effects of the\r\neccentricity is, then, the necessary result of circumstances when the\r\nprecipitation is not too great to be nearly carried off by the\r\nsubsequent dissipation. This is the state of things on Mars and the\r\nsecond of the factors above referred to. On the Earth as we have seen\r\nthe polar caps are somewhat larger at their maximum and very much so at\r\ntheir minimum. Now, this is just what should happen were the\r\nprecipitation increased. Suppose, for example, that the amount of\r\nprecipitation were to increase while the amount of summer melting\r\nremained the same, and this would be the case if the vapor in the air\r\naugmented for one cause or another, and the result of each fresh\r\ndeposit was locked up in snow. After a certain point the cap would grow\r\nin depth rather than in extension; the winter deposit would be thicker\r\nbut the summer evaporation would remain the same. Now, if this\r\noccurred, it is evident that the minimum size of the cap would increase\r\nrelatively much faster than the maximum, and furthermore, that the\r\nrelative increase of the minimum in the two caps would be greatest for\r\nthat which had seasons of extremes. The result we see in the case of\r\nthe Earth. In the arctic cap, where in consequence of the eccentricity\r\nof the orbit the winter is shorter, the maximum is less than in the\r\nantarctic and this extra amount of precipitation cannot be wholly done\r\naway with in its intenser summer, so that the minimum too is greater\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWe reach, then, this interesting conclusion. We find that eccentricity\r\nof orbit by itself not only causes no universal glaciation in the\r\nhemisphere which we should incidentally suppose likely to show it, but\r\nactually produces the opposite result, in more than offsetting by\r\nsummer proximity what winter distance brings about. To cause extensive\r\nglaciation we must have, in addition to favorable eccentricity, a large\r\nprecipitation. With these two factors combined we get an ice age, but\r\nnot otherwise. The result has an important bearing on geologic glacial\r\nperiods and their explanation.\r\n\r\nOnce formed, an ice-sheet cools everything about it and chills the\r\nclimate of its hemisphere. It is a perpetual storehouse of cold. Mars\r\nhas no such general glaciation in either hemisphere, and the absence of\r\nit, which is due to lesser precipitation, together with the clearness\r\nof its skies, accounts for the warmth which the surface exhibits and\r\nwhich has been found so hard hitherto to interpret. Could our earth but\r\nget rid of its oceans, we too might have temperate regions stretching\r\nto the poles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                       MARTIAN POLAR EXPEDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPolar expeditions exert an extreme attraction on certain minds, perhaps\r\nbecause they combine the maximum of hardship with the minimum of\r\nheadway. Inconclusiveness certainly enables them to be constantly\r\nrenewed, without loss either of purpose or prestige. The fact that the\r\npole has never been trod by man constitutes the lodestone to such\r\nundertakings; and that it continues to defy him only whets his endeavor\r\nthe more. Except for the demonstration of the polar drift-current\r\nconceived of and then verified by Nansen, very little has been added by\r\nthem to our knowledge of the globe. Nor is there specific reason to\r\nsuppose that what they might add would be particularly vital. Nothing\r\nout of the way is suspected of the pole beyond the simple fact of being\r\nso positioned. Yet for their patent inconclusion they continue to be\r\nsent in sublime superiority to failure.\r\n\r\nMartian polar expeditions, as undertaken by the astronomer, are the\r\nantipodes of these pleasingly perilous excursions in three important\r\nregards, which if less appealing to the gallery commend themselves to\r\nthe philosopher. They involve comparatively little hardship; they have\r\naccomplished what they set out to do; and the knowledge they have\r\ngleaned has proved fundamental to an understanding of the present\r\nphysical condition of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe antithesis in pole-pursuing between the two planets manifests\r\nitself at the threshold of the inquiry, in the relative feasibility\r\nwith which the phenomena on Mars may be scanned. For, curiously enough,\r\ninstead of being the pole and its surrounding paleocrystic ice which\r\nremains hidden on Mars, it is rather the extreme extent of its\r\nextension and the lowest latitudinal deposit of frost which lies\r\nshrouded in mystery. The difficulty there is not to see the pole but to\r\nsee in winter the regions from which our own expeditions set out. And\r\nthis because the poles are well displayed to us at times which are\r\nneither few nor very far between; while favorable occasions for marking\r\nthe edge of the caps when at their greatest have neither proved so\r\nnumerous nor so favorable. The tilt of the planet’s axis when\r\nconveniently placed for human observation has been the cause of the one\r\ndrawback; the planet’s meteorological condition in those latitudes at\r\nthat season the reason for the other.\r\n\r\nWhat knowledge we have of the size of the caps in degrees upon the\r\nsurface of the planet at this their extreme equatorward extension has\r\nbeen given in the last chapter. Their aspect at the time together with\r\nwhat that aspect betokens was not there touched upon. With it,\r\ntherefore, and the peculiarities it presents to view we shall begin our\r\naccount of the caps’ annual history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: South Polar Cap in winter.]\r\n\r\nWhen first the hemisphere, the pole of which has for half a Martian\r\nyear been turned away from the sun, begins to emerge from its long\r\nhibernation, the snow-cap which covers it down even to temperate\r\nregions presents an undelimited expanse of white, the edges of which\r\nmerge indistinguishably into the groundwork color of the regions round\r\nabout. Of a dull opaque hue along its border, its contour is not sharp\r\nbut fades off in a fleecy fringe without hard and fast line of\r\ndemarcation. Such notably was the aspect of the north temperate zone in\r\n1896 when, tilted as it then was away from us into a mere northern\r\nhorizon of the planet’s limb, it showed prior to the definite\r\nrecognition of the north polar cap in August of that year, and such too\r\nwas the look of the disk’s southern edge both before and after the\r\nfirst certain detection of the southern cap in 1903 and 1905. Each was\r\nthen in the depth of winter. For in Martian chronology the season\r\ncorresponded in each at the time to what we know in our northern\r\nhemisphere as the latter part of February and the early part of March\r\nand the appearance of the planet’s surface in both was not unlike what\r\nwe know at the same season in latitude 45°. Indeed, there is reason to\r\nsuppose bad weather there then and the extreme fringe, from the pale\r\ntint it exhibited, to have been cloud rather than snow.\r\n\r\nIt is quite in keeping with what we know on earth or can conceive of\r\nelsewhere that such aspect should characterize the cap at or near the\r\nattainment of its greatest development. Whether it were not yet quite\r\narrived at this turning-point of its career or had but slightly passed\r\nit a vagueness of outline would in either event proclaim the fact. For\r\nwere the frost still depositing, the cap’s edge would show indefinite;\r\nand on the other hand had it just begun to melt, evaporation would give\r\nit an undefined edge before the melting water had gathered in\r\nsufficient quantities to be itself noticeable.\r\n\r\nIts behavior subsequent to recognition bore out the inference from its\r\naspect when it first appeared. While for many days prior to its coming\r\nunmistakably into view it was impossible to say whether what was seen\r\nof the southern cap in 1903 and 1905 was cloud or snow; so even after\r\nit had definitely disclosed itself it continued to play at odds with\r\nthe observer. Showing sharp at the edges one day it would appear but\r\nhazily defined the next, thus clearly demonstrating itself to be at the\r\nthen unstable acme of its spread. Such a state of things we are only\r\ntoo familiar with in our own March weather when after days of sunshine\r\nthat have melted off the winter’s white and fringed it with rivulets\r\nand awakening grass, a snow-storm falling upon it powders the ground\r\nagain that was beginning to be bare and at one stroke extends the\r\ndomain of the snow while mystifying the actual limits it may be said to\r\noccupy. The same condition of things, then, is not unknown on Mars, and\r\nto fix the precise date of so wavering a phenomenon is not so much\r\nmatter of difficult observation as of physical impossibility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hellas in winter.]\r\n\r\nNor is the southern cap, at this the height of its winter expansion,\r\nconfined strictly to its own proper limits. Faint extensions, now so\r\nconnected with its main body as to form part and parcel of it, now so\r\ndetached and dull of tint as to make the observer doubtful of the exact\r\nrelationship, are generally to be seen attendant on it. Hellas in\r\nwinter is much given to such questionable garb, and has in consequence\r\nbeen mistaken by more than one observer for the cap itself, appearing\r\nas it does well upon the southern limb and being often the only region\r\nto show white. Indeed, frost-bound as it then is, to consider it the\r\npolar cap, though possibly geographically incorrect, may\r\nclimatologically be sustainable. Its northern extremity extends down to\r\nlatitude 30°, a pretty low latitude for frost. Still such equatorward\r\nextension is not without corroborating parallel. In 1903, at what was\r\nin Martian dates April 26, the whole of the region south of the Solis\r\nLacus and the Nectar showed white, with a whiteness which may as well\r\nhave been hoarfrost as cloud. Now, the Nectar runs east and west in\r\nlatitude 28°. So that in this instance, too, it is possible that arctic\r\nconditions knocked at the very doors of the tropics. Encroachment of\r\nthe sort is equivalent to snow in Cairo and permanent snow at that; not\r\nan occasional snow flurry, but something to linger on the ground and\r\nstay visible sixty millions of miles away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White south of Nectar and Solis Lacus.]\r\n\r\nKnowledge of either cap in this the midwinter of its year has been a\r\nmatter of the most recent oppositions of the planet. Up to within the\r\nlast few years our acquaintance with either cap was chiefly confined to\r\nthe months,—one might almost say the weeks,—immediately surrounding\r\nthe summer solstice of its respective hemisphere. The behavior of the\r\ncaps during the rest of their career was largely unknown to us, from\r\nthe very disadvantageous positions they occupied at the times the\r\nplanet was nearest to the earth. Beginning with 1894, however, our\r\nknowledge of both has been much extended, by a proportionate extension\r\nof the period covered by the observations. It used to be thought\r\nimpracticable to observe the planet far on either side of opposition;\r\nnow it is observed from as much as four months before that event to the\r\nsame period after it. The result is a systematic series of observations\r\nwhich in many ways has given unexpected insight into Martian\r\nconditions. One of the benefits secured has been the lengthening of the\r\nperiod of study of the cap’s career, a pushing of inquiry farther back\r\ninto its spring history and a longer lingering with it in its autumnal\r\nrebuilding. Yet up to the very last opposition a gap in its chronology\r\nstill remained between February 25 and April 1. The opposition of 1905\r\nhas bridged this hiatus and brought us down to the latter date, at\r\nwhich the melting of the cap begins in earnest.\r\n\r\nFrom this point, April 1 on, we have abundant evidence of the cap’s\r\nbehavior. Its career now for some time is one long chronicle of\r\ncontraction. Like Balzac’s _Peau de Chagrin_ it simply shrinks, giving\r\nout of its virtue in the process. The cap proceeds to dwindle almost\r\nunder the observer’s eye till, from an enormous white counterpane\r\nspread over all the polar and a large part of the temperate zone, its\r\narea contracts to but the veriest nightcap of what it was before. From\r\nseventy degrees across it becomes sixty, then fifty, then forty, till\r\nby the middle of the Martian May it has become not more than thirty\r\ndegrees in diameter. During this time, from the moment the melting\r\nbegan in good earnest, the retreating white is girdled by a dark band,\r\nof a blue tint, which keeps pace with the edge of the cap, shrinking as\r\nit shrinks, and diminishing in width as the volume of the melting\r\ndecreases.\r\n\r\nAfter the melting has been for some time under way and the cap has\r\nbecome permanently bordered by its dark blue band a peculiar phenomenon\r\nmakes its appearance in the cap itself. This is its fission into one or\r\nmore parts. The process begins by the appearance of dark rifts which,\r\nstarting in from the cap’s exterior, penetrate into its heart until at\r\nlast they cleave it in two. Rifts have been seen by several observers\r\nand in both caps; and what is most suggestive they always appear in the\r\nsame places, year after year. Sometimes oppositions elapse between\r\ntheir several detections for they are not the least difficult of\r\ndetail; but when they are caught, they prove to lie just where they did\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe permanency in place of the rifts, a characteristic true of them\r\nall, shows them to be of local habit. Thus the rift of 1884 and 1897\r\nreappeared again to another observer in the same position in 1901. They\r\nare, therefore, features of, or directly dependent on, the surface of\r\nthe planet. But it will not do from this fact to infer that they are\r\nexpressive of depressions there. The evidence is conclusive that great\r\nirregularities of surface do not exist on Mars. As we shall see when we\r\ncome to consider the orology of the planet it is certain that\r\nelevations there of over two or three thousand feet in altitude are\r\nabsent. Differences of temperature, able to explain a melting of the\r\nice in one locality coincidentally with its retention in an adjacent\r\none, must in consequence be unknown. And this much more conclusively\r\nthan at first appears, for the reason that the smaller the planet’s\r\nmass the less rapidly does its blanket of air thin out in ascent above\r\nthe surface. This is in consequence of the greater pull the larger body\r\nexerts and the greater density it imparts to a compressible gas like\r\nour atmosphere. Gravity acts like any force producing pressure and by\r\nit the envelope of air is squeezed into a smaller compass. But as this\r\nis done throughout the atmospheric layer it means a more rapid\r\nrarefaction as one leaves the body. The action is such that the height\r\nnecessary to reach an analogic density varies inversely as the gravity\r\nof the mass. In consequence of this, to compass a relative thermometric\r\nfall for which a moderate difference of elevation would suffice on\r\nEarth, an immoderate one must be made on Mars. For gravity there being\r\nbut three eighths what it is here, eight thirds the rise must be made\r\nto attain a proportionate lowering of temperature. This fact renders\r\nthe above argument against elevation and depression being the cause of\r\nthe phenomenon three times as cogent as it otherwise would be.\r\n\r\nWith so gradual a gradient in barometric pressure there and so low a\r\nset of contour lines, altitude must be a negligible factor in Martian\r\nsurface meteorologic phenomena. Both density and temperature can be but\r\nlittle affected by such cause, and we must search elsewhere for\r\nexplanation of what surface peculiarities we detect.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rifts themselves, from being lines which penetrate the\r\ncap from its periphery in toward its centre, end by traversing it in\r\nits entirety and separating portions which, becoming outlying\r\nsubsidiary patches, themselves proceed to dwindle and eventually\r\ndisappear. The rifts usually take their rise from such broader parts of\r\nthe cap-encircling blue belt as make beads upon that cordon and are\r\nclearly spots where the product of the melting of the cap is either\r\nspecially collected, or produces its most visible effect.\r\n\r\nSo far the description might apply with substantial accuracy to either\r\ncap. Yet the conduct of the two is in some ways diverse and begins to\r\naccentuate itself from this point on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Northern Cap hooded with vapor.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time that the north polar cap reaches a diameter of about\r\ntwenty-five degrees, a singular change steals over it. From having been\r\nup to then of a well-defined outline it now proceeds to grow hazy and\r\nindistinct all along its edge. This change in its character at the same\r\nperiod of its career has been quite noticeable at each of the three\r\nlast oppositions, so that small doubt remains that the metamorphosis is\r\na regularly recurrent one in the history of the cap. Coincident with\r\nthe obliteration of its contour, its dimensions seemingly enlarge. It\r\nis as if a hood had been drawn over the cap of a dull white different\r\nfrom the dazzling brilliance of the cap itself and covering more\r\nground. Such is probably what occurs; with vapor for veil. The\r\nexcessive melting of the cap produces an extensive evaporation which\r\nthen in part condenses to be deposited afresh, in part remains as a\r\ncovering, shutting off from our view the outlines of the cap itself. It\r\nwould seem that at this time the cap melts faster than the air can\r\ncarry it off. A sort of steaming appears to be going on, taking place\r\n_in situ_. For it clearly is not wafted away. The time of its coming\r\ntoo is significant. For the season is May 15, the height of time for a\r\nspring haze to set in. Then later it dissipates with the same quiet\r\nindefiniteness with which it gathered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Northern Cap unmasked.]\r\n\r\nIt is some time in Martian June before the spring haze clears away, and\r\nwhen it does go, only a tiny polar cap stands revealed beneath it, from\r\nsix to eight degrees across, or from a tenth to a fifteenth of what it\r\nwas when it passed into its curious spring chrysalis. The date of\r\nemergence varies. In 1903 it occurred early, the haze not being marked\r\nafter June 3, though recurring again at intervals for a day or so. In\r\n1905 it was later; perceptibly thin after June 21 it did not certainly\r\nclear away till June 9 and came back again on July 16 and possibly on\r\nthe 25th.\r\n\r\nThese vicissitudes of aspect give us glimpses into a sweet\r\nunreasonableness in Martian weather which makes it seem more akin to\r\nour own. And this on two counts, diurnal and annual. From day to day\r\natmospheric conditions shift for purely local cause; while,\r\nfurthermore, successive Martian years are not alike. In some the season\r\nis early; in others late. So that Mars is no more exempt than are we\r\nfrom the wantonness of weather.\r\n\r\nClearly disclosed thus reduced to its smallest possible terms it\r\nremains for some months of our days, for six weeks of its own. During\r\nthat period it continues practically unchanged, neither increasing nor\r\ndecreasing significantly in size, nor altering notably in aspect.\r\nMeasures of the drawings of it then make it from five to eight degrees\r\nacross and it is possible that it really fluctuates between narrow\r\nlimits, though its clear-cut outline at all times renders the variation\r\ndifficult to explain. We are not so near it as we could wish; for on\r\nthese occasions even at their best it is over two hundred times as\r\ndistant as the moon and the greatest magnification possible still\r\nleaves it a hundred thousand miles away.\r\n\r\nTo the south polar cap a somewhat similar history attaches, but with a\r\ndifference. In its case no such regularly recurrent spring haze has yet\r\nbeen noted. The melting of this cap would seem to be of a more orderly\r\nnature than its fellow and not to outdo what can conveniently be\r\ncarried off.\r\n\r\nThat an excess of evaporation should not take place is the more\r\npeculiar from the fact that at its maximum it is the larger of the two\r\nand therefore has the greater quantity of matter to get rid of. Its\r\nsummer, also, is shorter than the arctic one, so that it has the less\r\ntime to dispose of its accumulations. The only other respect in which\r\nit seems to be differently circumstanced from its antipodes is in the\r\ncharacter of its surroundings. About it are large blue-green areas\r\nwhich with intermissions stretch down in places to within less than ten\r\ndegrees of the equator; whereas the other pole is continuously\r\nencircled for long distances by practically uninterrupted ochre. The\r\ncharacter of the environment seems thus the only thing that can account\r\nfor the difference in behavior and this proves the more plausible when\r\nwe come to consider what those two classes of regions respectively\r\nrepresent.\r\n\r\nIn other ways as well the southern cap is the more self-contained. The\r\nrifts, indeed, break it up into separate portions and these in part\r\nremain as outlying detachments of the main body, as was notably the\r\ncase in 1877 and in 1894, but they hardly have the permanency and\r\nimportance of those similarly formed about the arctic pole. Nothing\r\nantarctic for instance compares with the subsidiary patch of the north\r\npolar regions lying in longitude 206°, which both in Schiaparelli’s\r\ntime, and during the late oppositions as well was almost as fixed a\r\nfeature of the arctic zone as the cap proper. Not quite so constant,\r\nhowever, and not so solid-looking a landmark is this patch for all its\r\nextent, which nearly equals the area of the more legitimate portion. It\r\nbears on its face a more pallid complexion as if it were thinner, and\r\nthis is borne out by the fact that it occasionally disappears, an event\r\nwhich so far at least has never befallen the northern cap itself.\r\n\r\nLess constant the southern one is to its own minimum than the northern.\r\nIn some seasons, in most in fact, it reaches like the other a more or\r\nless definite limit of diminution which it does not pass. But this is\r\nnot always the case. In 1894 it disappeared entirely at the height of\r\nits midsummer. The season was probably unusually hot then in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere of Mars.\r\n\r\nIn position the caps have something to say about physiographic\r\nconditions. Both caps at their minima are then irregular and the centre\r\nof the south one is markedly eccentric to the areographic pole. It lies\r\nsome six degrees north along the thirtieth meridian. The northern one\r\nis also probably eccentric, but much less so, with a divergence not\r\nmuch exceeding a degree and of doubtful orientation. Not only are both\r\ncaps not upon their respective poles but they are not opposite each\r\nother, the one lying in longitude 30°, the other in 290°. This speaks,\r\nof course, for local action. In some wise this must depend on the\r\nconfiguration of the surface, yet so far as markings go there is\r\nnothing to show what the dependence is.\r\n\r\nThe eccentring of the caps is paralleled by the like state of things on\r\nearth. The pole of cold does not coincide in either hemisphere with the\r\ngeographic pole. On the earth its position is largely determined by the\r\ndistribution of the land-masses. Continents are not such equalizers of\r\nheat as oceans because of their conductivity on the one hand and their\r\nimmobility on the other. In winter they part with their heat more\r\nquickly and convection currents cannot supply the loss. This accounting\r\nfor thermal pole eccentricity is inapplicable to Mars because of the\r\nabsence there of bodies of water. And it is significant that the degree\r\nthe earthly poles of cold are out much exceeds what is the case on\r\nMars. Possibly areas of vegetation there replace to some effect areas\r\nof water. It is certainly in favor of this view that the arctic regions\r\nthere are more desert than the antarctic and that the north pole of\r\ncold occupies more squarely the geographic pole.\r\n\r\nNot till 1903 did the actual starting again of either cap chance to be\r\nseen. Nor was this, indeed, a matter of hazard but of persistent\r\ninquiry by observation prolonged after the planet had got so far away\r\nthat its scanning had hitherto been discontinued. Such search beyond\r\nthe customary limits of observation was essential to success, because\r\nof the relation of the axial tilt to the position of the planet in its\r\norbit. At an opposition well placed for nearness, the tilt is such as\r\nlargely to hide the pole and to present the polar regions too obliquely\r\nto view for effective scanning. This is true both of the arctic and the\r\nantarctic regions in turn. For the Martian axis being inclined somewhat\r\nas our own is to the plane of the planet’s orbit, we at times see well\r\nand at times but poorly the arctic or antarctic zones.\r\n\r\nThe cap, the starting to form of which was thus caught, was the arctic\r\none; the date 128 days after the northern summer solstice, or\r\nthereabouts, for as is perhaps natural the advent of the phenomenon\r\npartook of the wavelike advance of such things familiar on earth, an\r\nadvance succeeded by a recession and then followed by another advance.\r\nSo much is proof of local weather there as here. Hoar-frost was\r\nsuccessively deposited and then melted off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deposition of frost.]\r\n\r\nWhat is significant, the deposition of the frost took place\r\nsimultaneously over large areas. The very first patch of it, in about\r\nlongitude 320°, extended at one stroke down to latitude 55°. For it\r\nactually crossed the Pierius somewhat to the south. A second patch\r\nstretched to the east of the cap. Two wings these made to the kernel of\r\ncap itself. Through the wings could be marked the line of the canal:\r\nthe Pierius upon the one side, the Enipeus upon the other. Such\r\nvisibility of the canals through the white stretches proved the white\r\nnot to be due to cloud suspended between us and them, but a surface\r\ndeposit which found no lodgment upon the canals themselves. The same\r\navoidance of dark markings was evidenced by the showing of the dark rim\r\nround the cap’s kernel. Now, if the deposit were indeed hoarfrost, this\r\nfailure to find permanent foothold on the dark markings is what we\r\nshould expect to witness. For whether they were vegetation or water,\r\nequally in either case the frost would melt from them first. Probably\r\nthey were both vegetal, though some doubt might exist about the latter,\r\nthe band around the kernel. It was then August 20 in that hemisphere.\r\n\r\nSuch deposition over great stretches of country is perhaps not so\r\nsurprising as it appears at first sight when seen from without in its\r\ntotality. After all, something not unlike it occurs in our snow-storms\r\nwhen hundreds of square miles are whitened at once. Furthermore, with\r\nan atmosphere as thin as Mars seems to possess the temperature must be\r\nperilously near the freezing-point in the arctic and subarctic regions\r\nat the close of summer.\r\n\r\nSteadily, with intermissions, the white sheet increased until even the\r\ndark border to the cap became obliterate, the kernel showing at first\r\nthrough the veil like the ghost of what it had been, and then ceasing\r\nto be visible at all, its delimitations being buried under deeper and\r\ndeeper depositions of frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First northern snow.]\r\n\r\nThe perennial portion of the cap was thus merged in the new-fallen\r\nsnow. This marked the on-coming of the arctic winter in full force and\r\nhappened even before the polar sun had wholly set. For the pole did not\r\nenter into the shadow till two of our months later, the autumnal\r\nequinox occurring 183 days after the summer solstice or 55 days after\r\nthe first fall of frost. Then the pole passed into its star-strewn\r\narctic night, a polar night of twice the duration of our own and the\r\ncircumpolar regions entered upon their long hibernation of ten of our\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                              WHITE SPOTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the polar caps proper and to the subsidiary polar\r\npatches that often in late summer flank them round about, other white\r\nspots may from time to time be seen upon the disk. In appearance these\r\ndiffer in no respect, so far as observed, from the arctic subsidiary\r\nsnow-fields. Of the same pure argent, they sparkle on occasion in like\r\nmanner with the sheen of ice. Equally with the polar caps they remain\r\npermanent in place during the period of their visibility and are\r\nthemselves long-lived. Though by no means perpetual their duration is\r\nreckoned by weeks and even months, and they recur with more or less\r\npersistency at successive Martian years. That, when seen, they show in\r\nparticular positions apparently unaffected by diurnal change precludes\r\ntheir being clouds, and this fact taken in connection with the\r\ncharacter of their habitat is the puzzling point about them. For they\r\naffect chiefly the north tropic belt. They, or at least their nuclei,\r\nare small, about two or three degrees in diameter, and are not\r\nparticularly easy of detection as a rule, though certain larger ones\r\nare at times conspicuous. Chromatic, rather than formal, definition is\r\nnecessary to their bringing out, as is witnessed by the superb colors\r\nthe disk presents at the times when they are best seen. It is then that\r\nMars puts on the look of a fire-opal.\r\n\r\nThe first such spot to be noticed was one which Schiaparelli detected\r\nin 1879, at the second opposition in which he studied the planet. He\r\ncalled it the Nix Olympica, showing that he recognized in it a\r\ncousinship to the polar snows. Yet it lay in latitude 20° north,\r\nlongitude[1] 131°, in the midst of the ochre stretches of that part of\r\nthe disk. It was a small roundish white speck of not more than two\r\nthirds the diameter of the polar cap. Reseen by him in 1881, it failed\r\nto appear at subsequent oppositions and was not caught again until\r\n1888. Then once more it vanished, not to be detected anew till many\r\nyears after at Flagstaff, coming out rather surprisingly in 1903. It\r\nshowed, however, in the same place as before; so that its position but\r\nnot its existence is permanent.\r\n\r\nA similar but smaller patch was apparent to Schiaparelli at the same\r\nopposition of 1879. This one which he styled the Nix Atlantica lay\r\nbetween the Thoth and the Syrtis Major. It was about half the size of\r\nthe Nix Olympica and has never since been seen, though it should have\r\nbeen had it continued to be what it then was.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White in Elysium.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, phenomena of the sort undetected of Schiaparelli\r\nhave been remarked at Flagstaff. On May 18, 1901, I was suddenly struck\r\nby the singular whiteness of the southeast corner of Elysium where that\r\nregion bordered the Trivium. Elysium has a way of being bright but not\r\nwith such startling intensity as this spot presented nor in so\r\nrestricted an area as was here the case. The spot was so much whiter\r\nthan anything I had ever previously seen outside the polar caps that it\r\narrested my attention at once. And this the more that I had observed\r\nthis same part of the planet the day before and perceived nothing out\r\nof the ordinary. Once detected, however, the spot continued visible.\r\nThe next day it was there with equal conspicuousness, and now thrust an\r\narm across the Cerberus, entirely obliterating the canal for the space\r\nof several degrees. In this salience it remained day after day till the\r\nregion passed from sight, to reappear with it six weeks later when the\r\nregion again rounded into view. The hour of the Martian day seemed to\r\nmake no difference in its visibility. It was seen from early morning\r\ntill Martian afternoon, as late as the phase permitted. Clearly there\r\nwas nothing diurnal about its revealing, and it lasted for at least\r\nthree months and a half, until the planet got so far away that\r\nobservations were discontinued.\r\n\r\nIt was to all appearances and intents snow. But now comes the singular\r\nfact about it. It lay within ten degrees of the equator and showed from\r\nthe end of June to the latter part of August. To our ideas there could\r\nbe no more inopportune place or time for such an exhibition. For it\r\ncannot have been due to a snow-capped peak, as we know for certain that\r\nthere are no mountains in this, or in any other, part of the planet.\r\nBesides, it had not appeared in previous Martian years; which it\r\ninfallibly would have done had it been a peak. Indeed, it baffles\r\nexplanation beyond any Martian phenomenon known to me. It seems\r\ndirectly to contradict every other detail presented by the disk.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is thus unique in kind; it is not, however, unique as a\r\nspecimen of its kind. The eastern coast of Aeria where that region\r\nborders the Syrtis Major is prone to a brilliance of the same sort. It\r\nis a narrow belt of country that shows thus, nothing but the coastline\r\nitself, but this for a considerable distance stretching several hundred\r\nmiles in length. It has stood out saliently bright now at every\r\nopposition which I have observed, beginning with 1894. Sometimes it has\r\nbeen described in the notes as bright simply, sometimes as white, and\r\nonce, in 1901, as glistening at one point like ice. Yet when upon the\r\nterminator it has never stood forth as a mountain range should have\r\ndone to declare its character.\r\n\r\nIt has been evident regardless apparently of the Martian season. In\r\n1894 it was bright from October 25 to January 16 (Martian chronology);\r\nin 1896, from December 22 to January 7; in 1901, from July 13 to the\r\n15th; in 1903, at about the same date and so in 1905. It was whitest\r\nduring the latter oppositions, showing that the effect is most marked\r\nin its midsummer. All of the above instances of extra-polar white have\r\nbeen located within the tropics. Examples of the same thing, however,\r\noccur in the north temperate zone. Tempe, a region just to the west of\r\nthe Mare Acidalium, is exceedingly given to showing a small white spot\r\nclose upon the Mare’s border in latitude 50° north. This spot, too, on\r\noccasion glitters as it were with ice. It is also at times very small.\r\nSo that whereas much of Tempe is by nature bright but a small kernel of\r\nit is dazzling.\r\n\r\nThe list might be easily extended from the record book. Thus on March 1\r\nand 2, 1903, the disk showed speckled with minute white spots, one in\r\nArcadia in latitude 41° north, one in Tharsis near the equator, a third\r\njust north of the Phoenix Lucus in 10° south, and a fourth, the Nix\r\nOlympica, and on April 11, a glittering pin-point starred like a\r\ndiamond the centre of the Pons Hectoris. On both these occasions the\r\nMartian season was summer; July 9 for the latter, June 21 for the\r\nformer date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White in the Pons Hectoris.]\r\n\r\nAs one approaches the north pole spots of like character become more\r\nnumerous. Especially are such visible north of the Mare Acidalium in\r\nthe arctic region thereabout, from 63° to 75° north.\r\n\r\nFrom so widespread a set of instances the only explanation which seems\r\nto fit the phenomena is that the mean temperature of Mars is low, not\r\nvery much above freezing, and that whatever causes a local fall in the\r\ntemperature results in hoar-frost. Such an explanation accords well\r\nwith the distance of the planet from the sun and the thinness of its\r\natmosphere. At the same time it shows that the mean temperature over\r\nthe greater part of the planet the greater part of the time is above\r\nthe freezing-point and that consequently it is no bar to vegetation of\r\na suitable sort.\r\n\r\nThat the hoar-frost should be found even at the equator may perhaps be\r\ndue to the very thinness of the air-covering of Mars, which would tend\r\nto make the actual insolation more of a factor than it is with us, and\r\nby the great length of the Martian seasons. In midsummer the greatest\r\ninsolation occurs in the arctic and temperate, not in the tropic\r\nregions; on the other hand, an atmosphere tends to accumulate heat for\r\nthe tropics. With us the latter factor is prepotent; it would be less\r\neffective on Mars. Then again the double duration of summer would tend\r\nto emphasize insolation as the important factor in the matter. But it\r\nis possible that greater deposition plays a part in the matter. On\r\nearth the rainfall is greatest near the equator and something of the\r\nsort may be true of the zones of moisture on Mars. That the most\r\nstriking spots are found to the west of large dark areas may in this\r\nconnection have a meaning inasmuch as, such regions being\r\nvegetation-covered, the air over them is probably more moisture-laden.\r\n\r\nOne point about the position of the spots is of moment: they have all\r\nbeen found in the northern hemisphere or within ten degrees of it in\r\nthe southern equatorial region. This seems at first a question of\r\nhemispheres; but when we consider that the light areas of the surface\r\nare chiefly in the boreal hemisphere and in the south tropic belt, we\r\nperceive that it may be rather the character of the surface there than\r\nthe particular hemisphere in the abstract that is decisive in the\r\nmatter. Nevertheless, the austral hemisphere is the hemisphere of\r\nextremes, possessing a shorter, hotter summer and a longer, colder\r\nwinter than its antipodes. This would not favor sporadic small\r\ndepositions of frost in summer so much as would a climate of a more\r\nmean temperature.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative lack of atmospheric covering over the planet we\r\nshould expect the nights to prove decidedly cool, while the days were\r\nfairly warm. Of this we have perhaps evidence in a singular aspect\r\nshown by the Mare Acidalium in June, 1903. The account of it in the\r\nAnnals reads thus: “On May 22 an interesting and curious phenomenon\r\npresented itself. On that day, so soon as the Mare Acidalium had well\r\nrounded the terminator on to the disk, at λ352°, the whole of its\r\ncentral part showed white, the edges of the marking alone remaining as\r\na shell to this brilliant core. So striking was the effect that beside\r\nappearing in the drawing it found echo in the notes. The next day no\r\nmention is made of it, and a drawing made under λ20° shows the Mare as\r\nusual and the bright spot in Tempe in its customary place. Neither was\r\nanything of the sort noticed on the 24th and 25th. But on the 26th, the\r\nday of the projection (upon the terminator), the effect of the 23d\r\nreappeared, the longitude of the centre being 332°. Fortunately on that\r\nday a further drawing was secured which enabled its subsequent behavior\r\nto be followed. Made three hours later than the other, the longitude of\r\nthe centre being 13°, this drawing shows the Mare well on the disk, its\r\nwhole area as dark as usual and with Tempe bright to the right of it\r\ntoward the terminator. The terminator in question was the sunrise one,\r\nand we are offered two suppositions in explanation of the phenomenon:\r\neither the white was due to a morning deposition of hoar-frost which\r\ndissipated as the sun got up, or obliquity rendered some superficial\r\ndeposit visible which more vertical vision hid. That the former\r\ninference is the more probable seems hinted at by the simultaneous\r\nappearance from the 19th to the 26th of other areas of white between\r\nthe Mare and the pole. May 26 was 88 days after the northern summer\r\nsolstice, and corresponded to July 31 on the earth.” Annals, Volume\r\nIII, §564.\r\n\r\nIn this connection mention may pertinently be made of Schiaparelli’s\r\nrepeated observation of regions that whiten with obliquity, a\r\nproclivity to which he particularly noticed Hellas and certain\r\n‘islands’ in the Mare Erythraeum to be prone. Here as with the Mare\r\nAcidalium we certainly seem to be envisaging cases of matutinal frost\r\nmelted by midday under the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Martian longitudes are now reckoned from the Fastigium Aryn, the\r\n  mythologic cupola of the world, a spot easy of recognition because\r\n  making the tongue in the jaws of the Sabaeus Sinus. It further\r\n  commends itself because of lying within a degree of the equator. The\r\n  longitudes are reckoned thence westward all the way round, or to 360°.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                          CLIMATE AND WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn gazing at the successive phases presented by the polar caps as their\r\nannual history unrolls itself to view, beginning with vast white cloaks\r\nthat in winter hide so effectively the planet’s shoulders, to little\r\nround knobs that in summer sit like guardsmen’s caps more or less askew\r\nupon the poles, the bodily eye sees only the glisten of far-off snow.\r\nThe mind’s eye, however, perceives something more: the conviction they\r\ncarry of the presence of an atmosphere surrounding the planet. Elusive\r\nas water vapor is to sight for its transparency and to spectroscopic\r\ndetermination for its earthly omnipresence, recognition of its\r\nexistence elsewhere by deduction raises such reasoning at once to a\r\nmore conspicuous plane than it might otherwise assume. Especially is\r\nthis true where the deduction is itself conclusive, as is here the\r\ncase. For it depends on phenomena not its own, but which are in their\r\nturn dependent on it. We are not even beholden to any knowledge of the\r\nsubstance composing the caps for the fundamental inference that an\r\natmosphere surrounds them. Whatever that substance were, the fact that\r\nthe caps dissipate and reform shows us with absolute certainty that\r\nthey pass into the gaseous state, to be later solidified afresh. This\r\ngas constitutes of itself an atmosphere; while another phenomenon, to\r\nwit, their blue girdles as they melt, affirming their substance to be\r\nsnow and ice, enables us to precise the fact that this gas is water\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\nFrom such premise given us by the polar caps we are able to infer much\r\nmore by the help of the kinetic theory of gases. But the speed of\r\nparting by a planet with its gases is conditioned by the mean speed of\r\neach gas. Water vapor will, therefore, go before nitrogen, oxygen or\r\ncarbonic acid gas. If, then, we find it present over the surface of a\r\nplanet we are assured of the possibility that the other three may be\r\nthere too, and from the similarity of matter in space strong reason to\r\nsuspect that they actually are.\r\n\r\nCorroborative evidence of the accuracy of the deduction as to the\r\npresence of a Martian air is shown in several other ways; in the\r\nexistence of clouds to begin with. Rare as they are, these certainly\r\nfloat at times over parts of the planet, although it is doubtful\r\nwhether they can then be seen. Fortunately for assurance we have other\r\nways of ascertaining their presence than that of obscuration. Nor is it\r\nof account to the argument that they should be few and far between, as\r\nthey unquestionably are. One single instance of such mediumistic\r\nsupport is enough to support the theory of a medium; and that instance\r\nhas been more than once observed.\r\n\r\nDirect evidence of atmosphere is further forthcoming in the limb-light.\r\nThis phenomenon might be described as a brilliant obscuration. It is a\r\ncirclet of illumination that swamps the features as they near the full\r\nedge of the disk, the limb of the planet as it is called. Obliteration\r\nof the sort is evident, more or less markedly, at all times, and is not\r\ndue to foreshortening, as the broadest areas are affected. The fading\r\nout of the detail at the limb suggests nothing so much as a veil drawn\r\nbetween us and it, lighter in tint than what it covers. Such a veil can\r\nbe none other than air or the haze and cloud that air supports. From\r\nits effect, impartial in place and partial in character, cloud is\r\ninadmissible as a cause and we are left with air charged with dust or\r\nvapor in explanation. Obscuration due to it should prove most dense at\r\nthe limb, since there the eye has to penetrate a greater depth of it;\r\njust as on the earth our own air gives azure dimness to the distance in\r\ndeepened tinting as the mountains lie remote.\r\n\r\nAnother bit of evidence lies in the apparent detection of a twilight\r\narc. In 1894 measures made of the polar and equatorial diameters of the\r\nplanet showed certain systematic residuals left after all known\r\ncorrections had been applied. The only thing which would account for\r\nthem was the supposition that a twilight arc had been unconsciously\r\nseen and as unconsciously measured. In delicate quantities of the sort\r\ntoo great reliance cannot be put, but if the residuals be not referable\r\nto other cause they give us not only further evidence of an atmosphere,\r\nbut at the same time our only hint of that atmosphere’s extent. From\r\nthem it would seem that the air must be rare, not more than about four\r\ninches of barometric pressure, as we reckon it, and probably less; a\r\nthin, high air more rarefied than prevails upon our highest mountain\r\ntops.\r\n\r\nCorroborative of this is the aspect of the planet. From the general\r\nlook of the disk a scant covering of air is inferable. For one of the\r\nstriking things about the planet’s features is their patent exposure to\r\nour sight. Except in the winter time of its hemisphere or in the spring\r\nafter the greatest melting of the polar cap, nothing seems to stand in\r\nour way of an uninterrupted view of the surface, whether in the arctic,\r\ntemperate, or tropic zones. From the openness of its expression,\r\nhowever, too much case should not be made as we really know but little\r\nof how an atmosphere-enshrouded planet would look. We find no\r\ndifficulty in seeing objects a hundred miles away across the surface of\r\nthe earth and yet the thickness of the air strata in such horizontal\r\ntraversing is many fold what it is when we look directly up. It is also\r\nout of all proportion laden with dust and smoke. In the purer regions\r\nof the earth, a clear air imposes but little bar to sight, and conjures\r\nup far things startlingly distinct.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, every evidence points to a thin air upon Mars: _a priori_\r\nreasoning, indirect deduction and direct sight. Now, from a thinness of\r\natmosphere it would follow, other things equal, that the climate was\r\ncold. About this there has been much question, but less of answering\r\nreply. From the distance of the planet from the sun it is certain less\r\nheat is received by it than falls upon the earth in something like the\r\nratio of one to two. But that the amount effective is as the amount\r\nreceived is far from sure. The available heat is much affected by the\r\nmanner of its reception. A blanket of air acts like the glass of a\r\nconservatory, letting the light rays in, but hindering the heat rays\r\nout. The light rays falling on the ground or the air are transformed\r\ninto heat rays that, finding the return journey less easy, are\r\nconsequently trapped. All substances are thus calorifiers, but water\r\nvapor is many times more potent than ordinary air to heat-ensnaring. A\r\nhumid air has a hothouse tang to it most perceptible. Now, what the\r\nrelative percentage of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere may be we\r\ndo not know.\r\n\r\nThe thinness of the Martian air has caused it to be likened to that\r\nupon our highest mountain peaks which are in large part covered with\r\nperpetual snow. But the comparison is not well founded. A peak differs\r\nmaterially from a plateau in the countenance it gives to the heat\r\nfalling upon it. On a plateau each warmed acre of ground helps the\r\nretention of heat by its neighbor; while in addition to being destitute\r\nof side support the higher winds generated about an isolated peak blow\r\nits own caloric away. Still less does any analogy hold between the two\r\nwhen the plateau is a world-wide one.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it is evident glosses are possible upon the\r\nbald idea of a much lower temperature prevailing on the Martian surface\r\nthan on the earth’s. Doubtless the theoretic cold has been greatly\r\noverdone. Reversely, recent observations tend to lower the apparent\r\ntemperature disclosed by the features of the disk, and between the\r\nrising of the theoretic and the falling of the observed we are left\r\nwith a very reasonable compromise and reconcilement as the result.\r\n\r\nThe various look and behavior of the surface of Mars point to a mean\r\ntemperature colder than that of the earth, but above the freezing-point\r\nof water; for regions, at least, outside of the polar caps and during\r\nall but the winter months. Except at certain special spots, and\r\npossibly even there, frost is unknown at all times within the tropics\r\nand except in winter in temperate latitudes. These anomalous\r\nlocalities, mentioned in the preceding chapter, may be said to be the\r\nexceptions that prove the rule of general non-glaciation. For if they\r\nbe snow, they stand witness to its absence elsewhere upon the disk, and\r\nif they are not, they testify the more emphatically to the same effect.\r\n\r\nAs between different parts of the surface, the tilt of the Martian axis\r\nand the greater length of the Martian seasons, the one the same as, the\r\nother the double of, our own, tend to an accentuation of the heat in\r\nthe temperate and arctic or antarctic zones. The greatest insolation on\r\nearth is not, as we might suppose, at the equator, but at the parallels\r\nof 43.°5 north and south; even the poles themselves receiving a quarter\r\nas much heat again on midsummer day as ever falls to the lot of the\r\nline. This broad physical fact is equally true of Mars, while in the\r\nmatter of consecutive exposure Mars in summer outdoes the earth. For\r\nthe longer the seasons, the more nearly does the effective heat\r\napproach the received amount. Thus both on the score of heat received\r\nand of heat husbanded these zones must be relatively warm. And this\r\nshows itself in the look of the surface. In summer it is clearly warmer\r\nwithin the polar regions than is the case on earth, to judge by the\r\neffect. In winter the cold is doubtless proportionately severe.\r\n\r\nFor the diurnal range of temperature we have less data. There is\r\nevidence pointing to chilly nights, but it is meagre, and we are left\r\nto fall back on the cold of our deserts at night for analogic condition\r\nof the state of things over the Martian desert levels after the sun\r\ngoes down.\r\n\r\nIf we are uncertain of the precise character of the Martian climate, we\r\nknow on the other hand a good deal about the Martian weather. A\r\npleasing absence of it over much of the planet distinguishes Martian\r\nconditions from our own. That we can scan the surface as we do without\r\npractical interruption day in and day out proves the weather over it to\r\nbe permanently fair. In fact a clear sky, except in winter, and in many\r\nplaces even then, is not only the rule, but the rule almost without\r\nexceptions. In the early days of Martian study cases of obscuration\r\nwere recorded from time to time by observers, in which portions of the\r\ndisk were changed or hidden as if clouds were veiling them from view.\r\nMore modern observations fail to support this deduction, partly by\r\nabsence of instances, partly by other explanation of the facts.\r\nCertainly the recorded instances are very rare. Indeed, occasions of\r\nthe sort must to any Martians be events, since only one possible\r\nexample has presented itself to me during the course of my\r\nobservations, extending more or less over eleven years. Even in this\r\ncase there was no obliteration, though a certain whiteness overspread\r\nan area near the equator temporarily. Position seemed to point to its\r\nidentity with a cloud which made its appearance about that time upon\r\nthe terminator, and lasted for some thirty-six hours. The cloud,\r\nhowever, showed evidence of being, not the kind with which we are\r\nfamiliar, but a dust-storm, in keeping, indeed, with the desert region\r\n(Chryse) in which it originated.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of sporadic disturbance of the sort the whole\r\nsurface of the planet outside the immediate vicinity of the polar caps\r\nseems free from cloud or mist and to lie perpetually unveiled to space.\r\nIn the neighborhood of the caps, however, and especially round about\r\ntheir edge, a very distinct pearly appearance is presented during the\r\nmonths at which the cap is at its maximum, or in other words, in the\r\ndepth of its winter. Of a dull white hue and indefinite contour the\r\nphenomenon suggests cloud. Where it lies spread no markings are\r\nvisible; an absence explicable by obscuration due an interposed medium,\r\nbut equally well by seasonal non-existence of the markings themselves,\r\nwhich from the general behavior of these markings we know to be to some\r\nextent certainly the fact. Of the regions where the effect is\r\nnoticeable, Hellas is the most striking. So conspicuously white during\r\nthe winter of the southern hemisphere as to have been often mistaken\r\nfor the polar cap, its ghost shows thus almost regularly every Martian\r\nyear. What is as suggestive as it is striking, the blanching is\r\nconfined to the solid circle constituting Hellas and does not extend\r\ninto the dark regions by which it is circumscribed. Hellas is as\r\nself-contained when thus powdered as when, in its normal ochre or\r\nabnormal red, it stretches like a broad buckler across the body of the\r\ndisk. That the land there lies at a higher level than its surroundings\r\nis pretty certain, but that the difference can amount to enough to\r\nexplain its silveriness as ice is improbable. In latitude Hellas is\r\ndistinctly temperate, lying between the parallels of 55° and 30°; but\r\non Mars this is no warrant of a like climate. Again, though close on\r\nthe south to what constitutes the polar cap, it does not strictly form\r\npart of that cap, but occupies both in position and in kind a something\r\nintermediary between the frost-bound regions of periodic snow and the\r\nwarmer ones of perpetual sunshine. It seems to be afflicted with the\r\nwinter weather of the north of Europe, and to owe its pearly look at\r\nsuch times to the same cloud canopy that then distressingly covers\r\nthose inclement lands.\r\n\r\nSimilar in behavior to it is the long chain of so-called islands that,\r\nbeginning southwest of Thaumasia, runs thence westward even to the\r\neastern edge of Hellas. These belt the planet in a west-northwesterly\r\ndirection by a strip of territory from ten to fifteen degrees wide, the\r\nmedial line of which begins at 55° south and ends in about 40°. They\r\nare parted from the main bright areas by blue-green ‘seas’ of about the\r\nsame width as themselves, the Mare Sirenum, the Mare Cimmerium and Mare\r\nTyrrhenum. These ‘seas’ the white that covers the ‘islands’ never\r\ncrosses; though the continent, as we may call it for convenience,\r\ndescends at the east to 30° south. Since the ‘seas’ are not seas, the\r\ncause which might bound the snow, were they such, cannot be the cause\r\nhere. Nevertheless, they have an effect of some sort on the isothermal\r\nlines as is shown not only by latitudinal comparison with the state of\r\nthings in Hellas, but with that in Thaumasia as well. For 30° south is\r\nalso the limit apparently of the white on Thaumasia, where ochre desert\r\nstretches ten degrees farther south still; the region in its southern\r\npart being white-mantled, in its northern part not. Here again, then,\r\nthe ochre areas make exception to what affects the blue-green ones.\r\nClearly the blue-green regions temper the action of what gives them\r\nwintry cloak. But why they should do this is not easy to explain on any\r\nsupposition terrestrial or marine. Bodies of water tend to foster the\r\nformation of clouds; so, less markedly, do areas of vegetation. Neither\r\nthe old ideas, then, nor the new lend themselves in explanation. It may\r\nbe that while we here seem to be envisaging cloud we are in reality\r\nlooking at hoar-frost. On the other hand, light cloud would show less,\r\nsuperposed over a dark background, than over an ochre one; and this,\r\nthe simplest of all explanations, may be the true one. It is facts like\r\nthese that intrigue us in the study of the Martian surface by revealing\r\nconditions which render offhand analogy with the earth unsafe. Indeed,\r\nwe are more sure of some things which appear too strange to be true\r\nthan of others so simple on their face as to enlist belief. Among the\r\nmost difficult and perplexing are meteorological problems like the\r\nabove. Here we can only say provisionally that while cloud best answers\r\nto the appearance, frost best fits the cause. For vegetation might melt\r\nfrost, yet not dissipate cloud. By raising our conception of the mean\r\ntemperature the facts can, however, be reconciled and this is probably\r\nthe solution of the difficulty after all.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in the annual history of the polar caps a dimness somewhat\r\ndifferent affects the northern cap in May and June. After the melting\r\nof the cap is well under way a haziness sets in along its edge which\r\nbefuddles its outline and effectually hides what is going on within it.\r\nWhen at last the screen clears away the cap is found to be reduced to\r\nits least dimensions. Such obstructing sheet looks to be more of the\r\nnature of mist caused by the excessive melting of the cap.\r\nUnfortunately, there are here no patches of blue-green to test a\r\npossible partiality in its behavior over such tracts; nor has similar\r\naction ever yet been remarked in the case of the cap of the southern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nRegular recurrence at the appropriate season of the planet’s year,\r\ntogether with extensive action at the time, takes this springtide mist\r\nto some extent out of the domain of weather into that of climate. For\r\nit prevails all round the cap and repeats itself in place as each fresh\r\nspring comes on. At least it has done so for the past three oppositions\r\nat which it has been possible to observe well the arctic zones. It is\r\nthus both general in its application and fixed in its behavior.\r\nNevertheless, it betrays something of the fickleness which\r\ncharacterizes that more inconstant thing: weather. For it comes and\r\ngoes, one thinks for good, only to find it there again some days later.\r\nNot less captious is the meteorologic action shown in the making of the\r\nnew polar cap. When the northern one starts to form, vast areas of\r\nfrost are deposited in a single night. These, however, are not\r\npermanent. The ground thus covered is during the next few days again\r\npartially laid bare. Then a new fall occurs, hiding the surface a\r\nlittle more completely than before, and the lost domain is more than\r\nregained. By such wavelike advance and recession the tide of frost\r\ncreeps over and submerges the arctic regions as the late summer passes\r\ninto the autumn. In this alternate coming and going with succeeding\r\ndays, we have an unsteadfastness of action most fittingly paralleled by\r\nour own weather. It would seem that local causes there as here are\r\nsuperposed upon the orderly progress of the seasons and though at the\r\non-coming of the autumn the cold is steadily gathering strength,\r\nnevertheless warm days occur now and then to stay its hand, only to be\r\nsucceeded in their turn by frosts more biting than before. Even on Mars\r\nnothing in the way of weather is absolutely predicable but\r\nimpredicability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                          MOUNTAINS AND CLOUD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all ways but one our scrutiny of the planet is confined to such view\r\nas we might get of it from the car of a balloon poised above it in\r\nspace; from which disadvantage-point we should see the surface only as\r\na map spread out below us, a matter of but two dimensions. The\r\nexception consists in the observation of what are called projections;\r\nirregularities visible when the disk is gibbous upon that edge of the\r\nplanet where the light fades off. Striking phenomena in themselves they\r\nare of particular value for what may be deduced from them. For by them\r\nwe are afforded our only opportunity of gaining knowledge of the\r\nsurface other than in plan and thus of determining between peak,\r\nplateau, or plain that to a bird’s-eye view alike lie flattened out to\r\none dead level.\r\n\r\nIt might at first be thought that our best chance of noting any\r\nelevations or depressions of the Martian surface lay in catching that\r\nsurface in profile, by scanning the bright edge of it which stands\r\nsharp-cut against the sky and is called the limb. For this is\r\npractically what we do on earth when we mark a mountain against the\r\nhorizon and measure its height by triangulation. Unfortunately the\r\nmethod fails in the case of Mars because of the great distance we are\r\naway. Unless the planet were distinctly more generously equipped than\r\nthe earth in the matter of mountains, nothing could be hoped from so\r\nforthright an envisaging. So relatively insignificant to the size of\r\nits globe is the relief of the earth’s surface that an orange skin\r\nwould seem grossly rough by comparison. The same proves true for Mars.\r\nWith the greatest magnification we can produce, the Martian limb still\r\nappears perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\nLuckily, while direct vision is thus impossible, oblique illumination\r\nenables us to get an insight into the character of the surface we had\r\notherwise been denied. When mountains or valleys chance to lie upon the\r\nboundary of light and darkness, the rim of the disk known as the\r\nterminator in contradistinction to the limb where the surface itself\r\ncomes to an end, they make their presence evident through an indirect\r\nspecies of magnification, the elongate effect of oblique lighting. With\r\na practical instance of it every one is familiar who has walked by\r\nnight along a road imperfectly starred at intervals by electric lights.\r\nStartled between posts by what seemed deep holes and high furrows he\r\nhas involuntarily imitated a spavined horse for fear of stubbing his\r\ntoes, only to encounter when his foot fell a surface on contact\r\nsurprisingly smooth. The slant illumination by lengthening the shadows\r\nhad painfully deceived him into exaggerated inference of irregularity.\r\nWhat proves disturbing to a wayfarer misguided by arc lights is made to\r\ndo the eye service when it comes to planetary interpretation. On the\r\nboundary of light and shade, those parts of the surface where it is\r\nsunrise or sunset upon the planet, the sun’s rays fall so athwartwise\r\nas to throw enormous shadows from quite small elevations to an eye so\r\nplaced as to view the surface with anything approaching\r\nperpendicularity. A mountain mass there will thus proclaim itself by\r\nprotracted profile upon the plain in hundredfold magnification.\r\nSimilarly a peak there will advertise its height by catching the coming\r\nor holding the lingering light at many times the distance of its own\r\nelevation away from the night side of the planet. Here, if anywhere,\r\nthen, could mountains be expected to disclose themselves, and here,\r\nwhen existent, they have as a matter of fact been found.\r\n\r\nOur own moon offers us the first and easiest example of such\r\nvicariously visible relief. When the moon is near the quarter, and for\r\nthree or four days on either side of that, a keen eye can usually\r\ndetect one or more knobs, like warts, projecting from its terminator,\r\neasily distinguished from the limb both by reason of being less bright\r\nand of being bounded by a semi-ellipse instead of a semicircle. If a\r\ntelescope or even an opera-glass be substituted for the eye, it is\r\npossible to see what causes them; the knob resolves itself into the\r\nilluminated rim of a crater separated from the main body of the visible\r\nmoon by the seemingly black void of space. The peak has caught the\r\nsunlight, while its foot and the country between it and the illuminated\r\nsurface still lies shrouded in shadow.\r\n\r\nFrom measurement of the distance the sun-tipped peak seems to stand\r\naloof from the line where the plain itself is touched by the light, the\r\nheight of it above that plain may be calculated. In this way have been\r\nfound the heights of the mountains of the moon. Incidentally, brain\r\noutstrips brawn. For pinnacles no Lunarian could scale, both for their\r\nprecipitous inaccessibility and their loftiness, man has measured\r\nwithout so much as setting foot upon their globe. At each lunar sunrise\r\nand again at lunar sunset these old crater walls show their crescent\r\ncoronets tipped the reverse way; and peaks higher than the Himalayas\r\nmake gigantic gnomons of themselves with hands outstretched to grasp\r\nthe plains.\r\n\r\nIn this manner a lunar peak of fifteen thousand feet shows its presence\r\nto the unaided eye. With so much for starting-point we can calculate\r\nhow low an elevation could similarly be made out on Mars under a like\r\nphase illumination. Now, in spheres of different diameters the distance\r\nout from the terminator for a given height is as the square root of the\r\ndiameter. Mars has about twice the size of the Moon. In consequence, if\r\nwe saw the planet at the same distance off as the Moon, the height of a\r\npeak upon it sufficient to cast an equal shadow or be seen at an equal\r\nseparation from the terminator need be but two thirds as high. To see\r\nit thus equidistant a power of 250 or 300 is necessary, dependent on\r\nthe opposition. Twice this power may at times be used, and by the same\r\nreasoning this would reduce the height sufficient to show by four or to\r\nsomething like 2500 feet. This, then, would be the theoretic limit of\r\nthe visible, a limit needing to be somewhat increased because of the\r\nimperfection of our air.\r\n\r\nHaving found thus what should be visible on Mars we turn now to see\r\nwhat is. At once we find ourselves confronted with a very unlunar state\r\nof things. Common upon the face of the Moon, excrescences of the\r\nterminator are rare on Mars. The first ever seen was detected by a\r\nvisitor at the Lick Observatory in 1888. Since then they have been\r\nrepeatedly noticed both at the Lick and elsewhere. But although\r\nobservers are now on the watch for them, they are not very frequently\r\nchronicled because not of everyday occurrence. Much depends upon the\r\nopposition; some approaches of the planet proving more prolific of them\r\nthan others. How rare they are, however, may be gathered from the fact\r\nthat the last three oppositions have disclosed but one apiece.\r\n\r\nAn account of the great projection of May 25, 1903, will give an idea\r\nof the extent and interest of the phenomenon and will serve to show to\r\nwhat cause we must attribute all such that have been visible on Mars,\r\nfor the behavior of this one was typical of the class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Projection on terminator.]\r\n\r\nAbout half past eight o’clock in the evening of May 26, 1903, Mr. V. M.\r\nSlipher, astronomer at Flagstaff, shortly after taking over the\r\ntelescope then directed upon Mars, suddenly noticed a large projection\r\nabout halfway up the terminator of the planet. He at once sent word of\r\nthe fact and the observatory staff turned out to see it, for a\r\nprojection has for workers on Mars the like interest that a new comet\r\npossesses for astronomers generally. In this case the phenomenon was\r\nspecially potent in that it was the first to be detected that year. Its\r\nsingularity was amply seconded by its size. For it was very large, its\r\nextent both in length and height being excessive. When I first saw it,\r\nthe projection consisted of an oval patch of light, a little to the\r\nnorth of the centre of the phase ellipse lying parallel to the\r\nterminator but parted from it by darkness to the extent of half the\r\nprojection’s own width. It made thus not simply an excrescence but a\r\ndetached islet of light. It was easily seen by all those present and\r\nwas carefully studied from that time on by Mr. Slipher and me. Both of\r\nus made drawings of it alternately at intervals, as well as micrometer\r\nmeasures of its position.\r\n\r\nNext to its great size, the most striking feature about it was its\r\ncolor. This, instead of being white or whitish, was ochre orange, a hue\r\nclosely assimilated to the tint of the subjacent parts of the disk,\r\nwhich was the region known as Chryse. This distinctive complexion it\r\nkept throughout the period of its apparition. At the same time Baltia,\r\na region to the north of it and synchronously visible close upon the\r\nterminator, showed whitish. The seeing was good enough to disclose the\r\nPhison and Euphrates double, the power a magnification of 310 and the\r\naperture the full aperture of the 24-inch objective.\r\n\r\nFrom the time it was first seen the detached patch of light crept in\r\ntoward the disk, the illuminated body of the planet. Four minutes after\r\nI noted it the dark space separating it from the nearest point of the\r\nterminator had sensibly lessened. So it continued, with some\r\nfluctuations intrinsic to the atmospheric difficulties of observations\r\ngenerally and to the smallness of the object itself, to become\r\ngradually less and less salient. It lasted for about forty minutes from\r\nthe moment it had first appeared to Mr. Slipher and then passed from\r\nsight to leave the edge of the planet smooth and commonplace again.\r\n\r\nThe measures made on it showed that it lay when first seen in longitude\r\n39°.7, latitude 18°.5 north, and that its highest point stood seventeen\r\nmiles above the surface of the planet. It was three hundred miles long.\r\nThese are my own figures, from which Mr. Slipher’s do not substantially\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\nThe return of the part of the planet where it had been seen was eagerly\r\nawaited the night after by both observers, to see if it would bring the\r\nprojection with it. For only once a day is the same region of Mars\r\nsimilarly presented. But in order not to miss the projection, should it\r\nbe ahead of time, observations were begun before it was due. Shortly\r\nafter they were started, there appeared higher up the terminator and\r\ntherefore farther north than had been the case the night before, a\r\nsmall projection. It was with difficulty made out and its position\r\nmeasured. Without careful watching it must have been missed altogether.\r\nAs it was, it differed in every respect from that of the preceding day.\r\nIt was not nearly so high, not nearly so large, and lay in a different\r\nplace on the planet, being now in longitude 31°.7, latitude 25°.5.\r\nEither the two, therefore, were totally different things or the\r\nprojection had moved in the elapsed interval of time over seven degrees\r\nof latitude and eight degrees of longitude, a distance of three hundred\r\nand ninety miles in twenty-four hours. Where the previous projection\r\nhad been nothing showed. On the following night, May 28, no trace of\r\nanything unusual could be seen anywhere.\r\n\r\nWe are now concerned to inquire to what this series of appearances\r\ncould have been due. The first observers of projections on Mars had\r\nunhesitatingly attributed them to the same cause that produces\r\nprojections on the Moon, to wit, mountains. Such they were held to be\r\nin France and at the Lick. This view, however, was in 1892 disputed by\r\nW. H. Pickering who considered them to be not mountains, but cloud. And\r\nthis view was strongly supported by A. E. Douglass in a discussion of a\r\nlarge number of them observed in 1894 at Flagstaff. The mountain theory\r\nof their generation was finally shown to be untenable and their\r\nascription to cloud conclusively proved to be the correct solution by\r\nthe observations of a remarkable one made in December, 1900, and the\r\ncareful study to which by the writer they were subjected. We shall now\r\nexplain how this was done and we will begin by pointing out that the\r\nfact that only a single specimen of the phenomenon was visible at each\r\nof the three oppositions of 1900, 1903, and 1905 was itself conclusive,\r\nrightly viewed, of their non-mountainous character. This conclusion\r\nfollows at once from the isolateness of the phenomenon. For a mountain\r\ncannot change its place. Now, the shift in the aspect presented by the\r\nplanet’s disk from one night to the next is not sufficient to alter\r\nperceptibly the appearance shown by anything upon its edge on the two\r\noccasions. If, then, a peak stood out upon it one evening, the peak\r\nshould again show salient when the region reached the same position\r\nupon the succeeding night. That nothing then was seen where something\r\nhad previously been visible proved the phenomenon not that of a\r\nmountain peak, since what produced the projection was clearly not fixed\r\nin place and therefore not attached to the soil. Now the only other\r\nthing capable of catching the light before it reached the surface would\r\nbe something suspended in the air, that is, a cloud. Deduction,\r\ntherefore, from the rarity of the phenomenon alone showed that the\r\nprojections must be clouds.\r\n\r\nTheir behavior in detail entirely corroborates this deduction from\r\ntheir intermittence. Such was shown by the action of the projection of\r\nDecember 6, 1900, as set forth in a paper before the American\r\nPhilosophical Society and such again by that of the one of May 26,\r\n1903, as we shall now note. To begin with, we notice that the\r\nprojection seen on May 26 was not found either _in situ_ or in size on\r\nMay 27 and had wholly vanished on May 28, though the seeing was\r\nsubstantially the same if not better on the two nights succeeding that\r\nof its original detection. Hence in its own instance this projection\r\nproved an alibi irreconcilable with the character of a mountain mass.\r\nBut it did more. It not only was not on the second evening what and\r\nwhere it had been on the first, but the remains of it visible on the\r\nsecond occasion showed clearly that it had moved in the meantime.\r\nFurthermore it was disappearing as it went, for it was very much\r\nsmaller after the lapse of twenty-four hours. The something that caused\r\nit was not only not attached to the soil, but was moving and\r\ndissipating as it moved. Only one class of bodies known to us can\r\naccount for these metamorphoses and that is: cloud.\r\n\r\nBut what kind of cloud are we to conceive it to be? Our ordinary vapor\r\nclouds are whitish and this would be still more their color could they\r\nbe looked at from above. The Martian cloud was not white but tawny, of\r\nthe tint exhibited by a cloud of dust. Nor could this color have very\r\nwell been lent it by its sunrise position, for other places equally\r\nsituated to be tinged by the hues of that time of day, Baltia to wit,\r\nshowed distinctly white. So that we must suppose it to be what it\r\nlooked, a something of the soil, not beholden to atmospheric tinting\r\nfor its hue; a vast dust-cloud traveling slowly over the desert and\r\nsettling slowly again to the ground.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same general course of drifting disappearance was taken\r\nby the projection of December 7 and 8, 1900. And this, too, stood an\r\nunique apparition in the annals of its opposition. Clouds, then, and\r\nnot mountains are the explanation of the projections on Mars, differing\r\nthus completely from the lunar ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                          THE BLUE-GREEN AREAS\r\n\r\n\r\nDescending now equatorwards from the polar regions, and their in part\r\npaleocrystic, in part periodic, coating of ice, we come out upon the\r\ngeneral uncovered expanse of the planet which in winter comprises\r\nrelatively less surface than on Earth, but in summer relatively more.\r\nForty degrees and eighty-six degrees may be taken as the mean hiemal\r\nand æstival limits respectively of the snow on Mars; forty-five and\r\nseventy-five as those of the Earth. Whatever ground is thus bared of\r\nsuperficial covering on Mars lies fully exposed to view, thanks to the\r\nabsence of obscuring cloud; and it is at once evident that the terrane\r\nis diversified, patches of blue-green alternating with stretches of\r\nreddish ochre. Of the two opaline tints the reddish ochre predominates,\r\nfully five eighths of the disk being occupied by it.\r\n\r\nIt was early evident in the study of the surface of Mars that its\r\nochreish disk was not spotless. Huyghens in 1659 saw the Syrtis Major.\r\nFrom this first fruit of areography dates, indeed, the initial\r\nrecognition of the planet’s rotation; for on noting that the marking\r\nchanged its place, he inferred a turning of the planet upon itself in\r\nabout twenty-four hours. Thirteen years later he observed and drew it\r\nagain and this time in company with the polar cap. Again, after eleven\r\nmore years, he depicted it for the third time, and now so changed\r\nbecause of the different tilt of the planet toward the earth that it\r\nmay be doubted whether Huyghens himself recognized it for the same. But\r\nthat he drew it correctly a globe of Mars will at once show.\r\n\r\nFrom such small beginning did areography progress to the perception of\r\npermanent patches of a sombre hue distributed more or less irregularly\r\nover the disk. Impressing the observers simply as dark at first, they\r\nlater came to be recognized as possessing color, a blue-green, which\r\ncontrasted beautifully with the reddish ochre of the rest of the\r\nsurface. Cassini, Maraldi, Bianchini, Herschel, Schroeter, all saw\r\nmarkings which they reproduced. Finally, with Beer and Maedler, came\r\nthe first attempt at a complete geography. In and out through the ochre\r\nwas traced the blue; commonly in long Mediterraneans of shade, but here\r\nand there in isolated Caspians of color. With our modern telescopic\r\nmeans the dark patches are easily visible, the very smallest glass\r\nsufficing to disclose them. When thus shown they much resemble in\r\ncontour the dark patches on the face of the Moon as seen with the naked\r\neye. Now these patches were early taken for lunar seas and received\r\nnames in keeping with the conception; as the Sea of Serenity, the Sea\r\nof Vapors, and so forth. Following the recognition of a like\r\nappearance, like appellatives were given to the Martian markings; and\r\nthe Mare Sirenum, or Sea of the Sirens, the Mare Cimmerium, and others\r\nsufficiently proclaim what was thought of them at the time they were\r\nthus baptized. Indeed, if a general similarity be any warrant for a\r\ngeneric name they were not at the time ill-termed. For, common to all\r\nthree bodies, the Earth, the Moon, and the planet Mars, is the\r\nfiguration of their surfaces into light areas and dark. In the Martian\r\ndisk, as in the lunar one, we seem to be looking at a cartographic\r\npresentation of some strange geography suspended in the sky; the first\r\ngeneric difference between the two being that the chart is done in\r\nchiaroscuro for the Moon, in color for Mars. On mundane maps, we know\r\nthe dusky washes for oceans; so on the Moon it was only natural to\r\nconsider their counterparts as _maria_; and on Mars as ‘seas.’ Nor did\r\nthe blue-green hue of the Martian ones detract from the resemblance.\r\n\r\nBut in something other than color these markings are alike. In fact,\r\ncolor could hardly be excuse for considering the lunar _maria_ what\r\ntheir name implies, for distinctive tint is lacking in them, even to\r\nthe naked eye. It was in form that the likeness lay. Their figures were\r\nsuch as our own oceans show; and allowing for a sisterly contrast amid\r\na sisterly resemblance, the lunar _maria_ or the Martian seas might\r\nwell have been of similar origin to those with which our schoolboy\r\nstudy of atlases had made us familiar. Thus did similarity in look\r\nsuggest similarity in origin, and intuitive recognition clothe its\r\nobjects with the same specific name.\r\n\r\nConsiderable assumption, however, underlay the pleasing simplicity of\r\nthe correlation on other grounds, consequent not so much upon any lack\r\nof astronomic knowledge as, curiously, upon a dearth of knowledge of\r\nourselves. We know how other bodies look to us, but we ignore how we\r\nlook to them. It is not so easy to see ourselves as others see us; for\r\na far view may differ from a near one, and a matter of inclination\r\ngreatly alter the result. Owing both to distance and to tilt we lack\r\nthat practical acquaintance with the aspect of our own oceans viewed\r\nfrom above, necessary to definite predication of their appearance\r\nacross interplanetary space. Our usual idea is that seas show dark, but\r\nit is also quite evident that under some circumstances they appear the\r\ncontrary. It all depends upon the position of the observer and upon the\r\nposition of the Sun. Their usual ultramarine may become even as molten\r\nbrass from indirect reflection; while on direct mirroring, they give\r\nback the Sun with such scarce perceptible purloining of splendor as to\r\npresent a dazzling sheen not to be gazed upon without regret. Canopied\r\nby a welkin they assume its leaden hue, while at the same time, their\r\nshores, less impressionable to borrowed lighting, show several tints\r\ndarker than themselves. Surfaces so sensitive to illumination hardly\r\nadmit of more accusable tint than a chameleon. Nevertheless, we are\r\nprobably justified in our conviction that perpendicularly visaged, they\r\nwould on the whole outdo in sombreness land round about them, and so be\r\nevident as dusky patches against a brighter ground.\r\n\r\nOne phenomenon we might with some confidence look to see exhibited by\r\nthem were they oceans, and that is the reflected image of the Sun\r\nvisible as a burnished glare at a calculable point. Specular reflection\r\nof the sort was early suggested in the case of Mars, and physical\r\nephemerides for the planet registered for many years the precise spot\r\nwhere the starlike image should be sought. But it was never seen. Yet\r\nnot till the marine character of the Martian seas had been otherwise\r\ndisproved was the futile quest for it abandoned. Indeed, it was a tacit\r\nrecognition that our knowledge had advanced when this column in the\r\nephemeris was allowed to lapse.\r\n\r\nOn this general marine ascription doubt was first cast in the case of\r\nthe Moon. So soon as the telescope came to be pointed at our satellite,\r\nit was evident that the darker washes were not water surfaces at all,\r\nbut very palpably plains. Long low ridges of elevation stood out upon\r\nthem like prairie swells, which grew in visible relief according to the\r\nslanting character of the illumination. Cracks or rills, too, appeared\r\nnear their edges and craters showed in their very midst. Patently solid\r\nthey betrayed their constitution not only by diverse topography but by\r\ndiversified tint. All manner of shades of neutral tone mottled their\r\nsurface, from seeming porphyry to chalk. Belief perforce departed when\r\nthe telescope thus pricked the bubble, evaporating as the water itself\r\nhad done long before.\r\n\r\nSo much was known before the Mars’ markings were named. Nevertheless,\r\nhumanity, true to its instincts, promptly proceeded to commit again the\r\nsame mistake, and, cheerfully undeterred by the exposure of its errors\r\nin the case of the Moon, repeated the christening in the case of Mars.\r\nSo sure was it of its ground that what it saw was not ground, that\r\nthough the particular appellatives of the several seas were constantly\r\naltered, rebaptisms, while changing the personal, kept the generic\r\nname. Dawes’ Ocean, for example, later became l’Ocean Newton and later\r\nstill the Mare Erythraeum, but remained set down as much a sea as\r\nbefore. About thirteen years ago, however, what had befallen the seas\r\nof the Moon, befell those of Mars: the loss of their character. It was\r\nfirst recognized through a similar exposure; but the fact was led up to\r\nand might have been realized in consequence of quite a different line\r\nof evidence. The initial thing to cast doubt upon the seas being what\r\nthey seemed to be was the detection of change in their aspect. That the\r\ndetection was not made much earlier than actually happened shows how a\r\nphenomenon may elude observation if scrutiny be not persistent, and its\r\nresults from time to time not carefully compared. Schiaparelli was the\r\none who first noticed variation in the look of the seas, and the\r\ndiscovery was as much due to the assiduity with which he followed the\r\nplanet opposition after opposition as to the keenness with which he\r\nscanned it. The noting of change in the blue-green areas constituted,\r\nin fact, one of the first fruits of systematic study of the planet.\r\nChange in configuration, that is, alteration of area, preceded in\r\nrecognition alteration of tint. Thus the Syrtis Major showed larger to\r\nhim in 1879 than it had in 1877. This was natural; difference of degree\r\nbeing a more delicate matter to perceive than its effect upon extent.\r\nFrom change of area his perception went on to change of tone. In his\r\nown words, what he noticed was this: _Memoria_, VI, 1888, “No less\r\ncertain is it that, from one opposition to another, one notices in the\r\nseas, very remarkable alterations of tone. Thus the regions called Mare\r\nCimmerium, Mare Sirenum, and Solis Lacus, which during the years 1877\r\nto 1879 could be numbered among the most sombre on the planet, during\r\nthe succeeding oppositions became less and less black, and in 1888 were\r\nof a light gray hardly sufficient to render them visible in the oblique\r\nposition in which all three found themselves.... On the other hand, at\r\nthe very same moment, the Mare Acidalium and the Lacus Hyperboreus\r\nshowed very dark; the latter indeed appeared nearly black, although\r\nseen as tilted as the Syrtis and the equatorial bays. The condition of\r\nthe regions called seas is therefore not constant: so much is\r\nunquestionable. Perhaps the change produced in them has to do with the\r\nseason of the planet’s year.”\r\n\r\nHolding as he did the then prevailing view that the blue-green regions\r\nwere bodies of water, he regarded those of intermediate tint as vast\r\nmarshes or swamps, and he accounted for change of hue in them as due to\r\ninundations and occasions of drying up. In consequence of losing their\r\nwater, the seas, he thought, had in places become so shallow that the\r\nbottom showed through.\r\n\r\nPlausible on the surface, this theory breaks down so soon as it is\r\nsubjected to quantitative criticism. For the moment we try to track the\r\nwater, we detect the inadequacy of the clew. The enormous areas over\r\nwhich the phenomenon occurs necessitates the establishing an alibi for\r\nall the lost water that has gone. Drying up on such a scale would mean\r\nthe removal of many feet of liquid over hundreds of thousands of miles\r\nin extent. To produce any such change in appearance as we witness, even\r\non the supposition that these seas were none too deep to start with,\r\nwould involve lowering the level of the water by from five to twenty\r\nfeet throughout two thirds of the whole surface of the southern\r\nhemisphere. This would leave a heap of waters to be accounted for,\r\nbewildering in its immensity. The myriad tons of it must be disposed\r\nof; either by drainage into other regions or by being caught up into\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency it might seem at first as if the polar cap of the\r\nopposite hemisphere offered itself as a possible reservoir for the\r\nmomentarily superfluous fluid. But such hoped-for outlet to the problem\r\nis at once closed by the simple fact that when the lightening of the\r\ndark regions of the southern hemisphere takes place, the opposite polar\r\ncap has already attained its maximum; in fact, has already begun to\r\nmelt. It, therefore, absolutely refuses to lend itself to any such\r\nservice. This was not known to Schiaparelli’s time, the observations\r\nwhich have established it, by recording more completely the history of\r\nthe cap, having since been made. Indeed, it was not known even at the\r\ntime when the writer, in 1894, showed the impossibility of the transfer\r\non other grounds; to wit, on the fact of no commensurate concomitant\r\ndarkening of the surface elsewhere and on the manifest non-complicity,\r\nif not impotency, of the Martian atmosphere in the process. The\r\ntransference of the water to other dark patches in the northern\r\nhemisphere fails of sufficiency of explanation because of the limited\r\nextent of such areas on that side of the globe; while the air is quite\r\nas incapable of carrying away any such body of liquid, though the whole\r\nof it were at the saturation-point, not to mention that there exists no\r\nsign of the attempt. The reader will find this reasoning set forth in\r\n_Mars_, published eleven years ago. He will now note, from what has\r\nbeen said above about the northern polar cap, that continued\r\nobservations since have resulted in opening up another line of proof\r\nwhich has only strengthened the conclusion there reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lines in dark area.]\r\n\r\nThe _coup de grâce_, however, to the old belief was given when the\r\nsurface of the dark areas was found to be traversed by permanent lines\r\nby Pickering and Douglass. Continued observation showed these lines to\r\nbe unchangeable in place. Now permanent lines cannot exist on bodies of\r\nwater, and in consequence the idea that what we looked on there were\r\nwater surfaces had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThus we now know that the markings on both the Moon and Mars which have\r\nbeen called _maria_ are not in reality seas. Yet we shall do well still\r\nto keep the old-fashioned sonorous names, Mare Erythraeum, Mare\r\nSirenum, and their fellows, because it is inconvenient to change;\r\nwhile, if we please, we may see in their consecrated Latin couching the\r\nfit embalming in a dead language of a conception that itself is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                               VEGETATION\r\n\r\n\r\nSince closer acquaintance takes from the _maria_ their character of\r\nseas, we are led to inquire again into their constitution. Now, when we\r\nset ourselves to consider to what such appearances could be due we note\r\nsomething besides sea, which forms a large part of our earth’s surface,\r\nand would have very much what we suppose the latter’s aspect from afar\r\nto be, not only in tone, but in tint. This something is vegetation.\r\nSeen from a height and mellowed by atmospheric distance, great forests\r\nlose their green to become themselves ultramarine.\r\n\r\nTo dispossess a previous conception is difficult, but so soon as we\r\nhave put the idea of seas out of our heads a vegetal explanation proves\r\nto satisfy the phenomena, even at first glance, better than water\r\nsurfaces. In their color, blue-green, the dark areas exactly typify the\r\ndistant look of our own forests; whereas we are not at all sure that\r\nseas would. From color alone we are more justified in deeming them\r\nvegetal than marine. But the moment we go farther into the matter the\r\nmore certain we become of being upon the right road. With increased\r\ndetection the markings they reveal and the metamorphoses they undergo,\r\nwhile pointing away from water, point as directly to vegetation. All\r\nthe inexplicabilities which the supposition of water involves find\r\ninstant solution on the theory of vegetal growth. The non-balancing of\r\nthe areas of shading in their shift from one part of the disk to\r\nanother, no longer becomes a circumstance impossible to explain, but a\r\nnecessary consequence of their new-found character, denoting the time\r\nnecessary for vegetation to sprout. The change of hue of vast areas\r\nfrom blue-green to ochre no longer presupposes the bodily transference\r\nof thousands of tons of substance, but the quiet turning of the leaf\r\nunder autumnal frosts. Even the fact that they occupy those regions\r\nmost fitted by figure to contain oceans fits in with the same\r\nconception. For that the Martian equivalents of forest and moorland,\r\ntree and grass, should grow now in the lowest parts of the planet’s\r\nsurface is what might not unreasonably be expected from the very fact\r\nof their being low, since what remained of the water would tend both on\r\nthe surface and in the air to drain into them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mare Erythræum\r\n\r\nMartian date. December 30]\r\n\r\nFor the change in question to be vegetal it must occur at the proper\r\nseason of the planet’s year. This we must now consider. We have said\r\nthat Schiaparelli detected change in the blue-green regions and\r\nsuspected this change of seasonal affiliation. He inferred this from\r\npiecing together the aspects of different seasons of different years as\r\nshown in consecutive Martian oppositions. To mark it actually take\r\nplace in a single Martian year came later. In 1894, at Flagstaff, the\r\nsouthern hemisphere was presented during its late spring and early\r\nsummer; it was observed, too, for many of our months in succession.\r\nDuring this time the planet was specially well circumstanced for study\r\nof the change in that hemisphere, both by reason of the appositeness of\r\nthe season and of the unusual size of the disk. Advantage was taken of\r\nthe double event to a recording of the consecutive appearances certain\r\nregions underwent, and the contrasted states thus exhibited were such\r\nas clearly to betoken the action of seasonal change. What Schiaparelli\r\nhad thus ably inferred from diverse portions of different Martian years\r\nwas in this case shown occurring in one and the same semestral cycle.\r\n\r\nUsually the change of hue seems essentially one of tone; the blue-green\r\nfades out, getting less and less pronounced, until in extreme cases\r\nonly ochre is left behind. It acts as if the darker color were\r\nsuperimposed upon the lighter and could be to a greater or less extent\r\nremoved. This is what Schiaparelli noted and what was seen in 1894 at\r\nFlagstaff. Three views _en suite_ of the chain of changes then observed\r\nare shown in _Mars_, the region known as Hesperia being central in\r\neach. Comparison of the three discloses a remarkable metamorphosis in\r\nthat “promontory,” a rise into visibility by a paling of its\r\ncomplexion. Nor is the contrast confined to it; changes as salient will\r\nbe noticed in the pictures over the other parts of the disk.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances, however, of a metamorphosis so much more\r\nstrange as to deserve exposition in detail; one where not tone simply\r\nis involved, but where a quite new tint has surprisingly appeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mare Erythræum\r\n\r\nMartian date. January 16]\r\n\r\nOn April 19, 1903, when, after being hidden for thirty days, owing to\r\nthe different rotation periods of the two planets, the Mare Erythraeum,\r\nthe largest blue-green region of the disk and lying in the southern\r\nhemisphere, rounded again into view, a startling transformation stood\r\nrevealed in it. Instead of showing blue-green as usual, and as it had\r\ndone six weeks before, it was now of a distinct chocolate-brown. It had\r\nbeen well seen at its previous presentation, so that no doubt existed\r\nof its then tint. At that time the Martian season corresponded to\r\nDecember 30 in our calendar. Eighteen Martian days had since elapsed,\r\nand it was now January 16 there. The metamorphosis had taken place,\r\ntherefore, shortly after the winter solstice of that part of the\r\nplanet. The color change that had supervened proved permanent. For the\r\nnext night the region showed the same brown hue, and so it continued to\r\nappear throughout the days that it was visible. Two months passed, and\r\nthen the chocolate hue had vanished,—gone as it had come,—and the\r\n_mare_ had resumed its usual tint, except for being somewhat pale at\r\nthe south. It had come to be February 21 on Mars. Timed and tabulated,\r\nthe metamorphosis through which the _mare_ passed stands out thus:—\r\n\r\n                          MARE ERYTHRAEUM 1903\r\n\r\n  ============+================+=============+==================\r\n              | DAYS BEFORE OR |             |\r\n              |  AFTER SUMMER  |             |\r\n    MUNDANE   |   SOLSTICE     |   MARTIAN   |\r\n     DATE     | (BEFORE =  -   |    DATE     |    ASPECT\r\n              |  AFTER  =  +)  |             |\r\n  ------------+----------------+-------------+------------------\r\n  February 16 |      -10       | December 16 | Blue-green\r\n  March 20    |      +22       | January 1   | Blue-green\r\n  April 19    |       52       | January 16  | Chocolate\r\n  April 22    |       55       | January 18  | Chocolate\r\n  May 26      |       89       | February 4  | Faint chocolate\r\n  May 30      |       93       | February 6  | Faint chocolate\r\n  June 30     |      123       | February 22 | Faint blue-green\r\n  July 7      |      130       | February 25 | Faint blue-green\r\n  ============+================+=============+==================\r\n\r\nThe culmination of the transformation seems to have taken place about\r\n60 days after the southern winter solstice, or in the depth of the\r\nMartian winter of that hemisphere. This is certainly just the time at\r\nwhich vegetation should be at its deadest.\r\n\r\nThe northern and southern portions of the _mare_ did not behave alike\r\nin taking on the chocolate tint. From the notes made about them during\r\nthe opposition it appears that the latter was later than the former in\r\nundergoing the metamorphosis, as will be seen from the following depth\r\nof the blue green estimated in percentages shown at different dates,\r\ncalling the deepest tone ever exhibited by it unity.\r\n\r\n  =========+==========+=========+=========+==========+==========\r\n   MARTIAN | DECEMBER | JANUARY | JANUARY | FEBRUARY | FEBRUARY\r\n    DATE,  |   (16)   |   (1)   |  (17)   |   (5)    |   (24)\r\n  ---------+----------+---------+---------+----------+----------\r\n           |     %    |    %    |    %    |     %    |     %\r\n  Northern |    50    |   50    |    0    |    25    |    50\r\n  Southern |    50    |   50    |    0    |     0    |    25\r\n  =========+==========+=========+=========+==========+==========\r\n\r\nFrom this table we may place the lowest point of the blue-green tint as\r\nreached about the 22d of January for the northern, the 5th of February\r\nfor the southern, part. This would indicate that the wave of returning\r\ngrowth came from the north, not the south; an important fact, as we\r\nshall see later in studying the action of the canals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mare Erythræum\r\n\r\nMartian date. February 1]\r\n\r\nAt the next opposition, in 1905, a recurrence of the transformation was\r\nwatched for, and not in vain. It occurred, however, somewhat later in\r\nthe Martian season. On December 27 of the planet’s current year the\r\nMare Erythraeum was still as usual, blue-green, nothing out of the\r\nordinary being remarked in it; and so it was on its January 17,\r\nalthough the southern edge was darker than the northern. It looked\r\ncertainly as if the metamorphosis were this year to be omitted. But\r\nsuch was not the case. When the region again came round, on February 1\r\nof the Martian calendar, there the strange tint was as unmistakable as\r\nit had been on its original occurrence. Not only was the Mare\r\nErythraeum so colored, but on February 5 (Martian) the northern portion\r\nof the Mare Cimmerium was observed to be similarly affected. In the\r\nMare Erythraeum the anomalous chocolate hue was confined to a belt\r\nbetween the latitudes of 10° and 20° south of the equator; in the Mare\r\nCimmerium it stretched a little higher, from 10° at the west to 25° at\r\nthe east. It is noteworthy that the southern portion of the latter\r\nshowed blue at the time the northern showed brown. Then the\r\nmetamorphosis proceeded as shown in the following table:—\r\n\r\n                          MARE ERYTHRAEUM 1905\r\n\r\n  ===========+======================+=============+=================\r\n             |   DAYS AFTER WINTER  |             |\r\n   MUNDANE   | SOLSTICE OF SOUTHERN |   MARTIAN   |    ASPECT\r\n     DATE    |       HEMISPHERE     |    DATE     |\r\n  -----------+----------------------+-------------+-----------------\r\n  January 25 |          12          | December 27 | Blue-green\r\n  March 6    |          52          | January 16  | Blue-green\r\n  April 4    |          81          | January 31  | Chocolate\r\n  April 12   |          89          | February 4  | Chocolate\r\n  April 30   |         107          | February 13 | Faint chocolate\r\n  May 8      |         115          | February 17 | Faint chocolate\r\n  May 12     |         119          | February 19 | Faint blue-green\r\n  June 11    |         149          | March 6     | Faint blue-green\r\n  June 15    |         153          | March 8     | Faint blue-green\r\n  July 16    |         184          | March 23    | Pale bluish green\r\n  ===========+======================+=============+==================\r\n\r\nHere, as in 1903, a chromatic rise and fall is evident; the culmination\r\nof the change occurring in Martian early February about ninety days\r\nafter the winter solstice. That it was not of long duration is also\r\nindicated. If we examine the evidence for the two portions of the\r\n_mare_ separately, the northern and the southern, as in 1903, we find\r\nit as follows:—\r\n\r\n  =========+==========+=========+==========+==========+=======+========\r\n           |          |         |          |          |       |\r\n   MARTIAN | DECEMBER | JANUARY | FEBRUARY | FEBRUARY | MARCH | MARCH\r\n    DATE,  |   (27)   |  (16)   |    (2)   |   (16)   |  (7)  |  (23)\r\n  ---------+----------+---------+----------+----------+-------+--------\r\n           |     %    |     %   |     %    |     %    |   %   |    %\r\n  Northern |    50    |    50   |     0    |    10    |  25   |   30\r\n  Southern |    50    |    50   |    20    |    20    |  25   |   30\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n\r\nHere again a slight retardation in the advent of the metamorphosis is\r\nobservable in the southern portion.\r\n\r\nThere would seem to be a difference in the time of the change between\r\nthe two years of fifteen days, 1905 being by that much the later. But\r\nwith points of reference themselves thirty days apart, it is possible\r\nthe two more nearly coincided than here appears.\r\n\r\nUnlike the ochre of the light regions generally, which suggest desert\r\npure and simple, the chocolate-brown precisely mimicked the complexion\r\nof fallow ground. When we consider the vegetal-like blue-green that it\r\nreplaced, and remember further the time of year at which it occurred\r\nupon both these Martian years, we can hardly resist the conclusion that\r\nit was something very like fallow field that was there uncovered to our\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mare Erythræum\r\n\r\nMartian date. February 21]\r\n\r\nFrom the recurrence of the phenomenon on two successive years, it is\r\nlikely that it annually takes place. That it is seasonal can scarcely\r\nbe doubted from the timeliness of its occurrence, and that different\r\nportions of its terrane successively underwent their metamorphosis\r\nshows further that it followed a law peculiar to the planet, to which\r\nwe shall be introduced when we come to consider the phenomena of the\r\ncanals.\r\n\r\nInstances of relative hue in different dark patches corroboratory of\r\nseasonal variation, and therefore of vegetal constitution, might easily\r\nbe adduced. Thus, in 1905 during the summer of the northern hemisphere,\r\nthe Mare Acidalium was notably darker than the Mare Erythraeum to the\r\nnorth of it, which is what the law of seasonal variation would require,\r\nsince it was June in the one, December in the other at the time. But we\r\nneed not to add example to example or proof to proof, for there are no\r\nphenomena that contradict it. We conclude, therefore, that the\r\nblue-green areas of Mars are not seas, but areas of vegetation. Just as\r\nreasoning to a negative result drifts us to the first conclusion, so\r\nreasoning to a positive one lands us at the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                   TERRAQUEOUSNESS AND TERRESTRIALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the vanishing of its seas we get for the first time solid ground\r\non which to build our Martian physiography. The change in _venue_ from\r\noceans to land has produced a complete alteration in our judgment of\r\nthe present state of the planet. It destroys the analogy which was\r\nsupposed to exist between Mars and our earth, and by abolishing the\r\nactuality of oceans there, seems, metaphorically, to put us at first\r\nall the more at sea in our attempt to understand the planet. But looked\r\nat more carefully, it turns out to explain much that was obscure, and\r\nin so doing gives us at once a wider view of the history of planetary\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nThe trait concerned is cosmic. Study of the several planets of our\r\nsolar system, notably the Earth, Moon, and Mars, reveals tolerably\r\nlegibly an interesting phase of a planet’s career, which apparently\r\nmust happen to all such bodies, and evidently has happened or is\r\nhappening to these three: the transition of its surface from a\r\nterraqueous to a purely terrestrial condition. The terraqueous state is\r\nwell exhibited by our own earth at the moment, where lands and oceans\r\nshare the surface between them. The terrestrial is exemplified by both\r\nthe Moon and Mars, on whose surfaces no bodies of water at present\r\nexist. That the one state passes by process of development into the\r\nother I shall now give my reasons for believing.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the appearance of the dark markings both on the Moon\r\nand Mars hints that though seas no longer, they were seas once upon a\r\ntime. On the moon, not only does their shape suggest this previous\r\ncondition, but the smooth and even look of their surfaces adds to the\r\ncogency of the inference. More important, however, than either of these\r\ncharacteristics, and confirmatory of both, is the fact that the great\r\ntracts in question seem to lie below the level of the corrugated\r\nsurface, which is thickly strewn with volcanic cones. Their level and\r\ntheir levelness fay in explanation into one another. The first makes\r\npossible the former presence of water; the second speaks of its effect.\r\nFor their flat character hints that these areas were held down at the\r\ntime when the other parts of the surface were being violently thrown\r\nup. That they can themselves be cooled lava flows, their extent and\r\nposition seem enough to negative; to say nothing of the fact that they\r\nshould in that case lie above, not below, the general level. Something,\r\ntherefore, covered them during the moon’s eruptive youth and\r\ndisappeared later. Such superincumbence may well have been water, under\r\nwhich the now great plains lay then as ocean bottoms. Deep-sea\r\nsoundings in our own oceans betray an ocean floor of the same extensive\r\nsort, diversified as on the moon. To call the lunar _maria_ seas may\r\nnot be so complete a misnomer after all; but only a resurrecting in\r\nepitaph what was the truth in its day.\r\n\r\nOnly doubtfully offered here for the Moon, for Mars the inference seems\r\nmore sure. Here again the dark regions not only look as they should had\r\nthey had an earlier history, but they, too, seem to lie below the level\r\nof the surface round about. When they pass over the terminator they\r\ninvariably show as flattenings upon it, as if a slice of the surface\r\nhad been pared off. Such profile in such pass is what ground at a lower\r\nlevel would present. Undoubtedly a part of the seeming depression is\r\ndue to relative absence of irradiation consequent upon a more sombre\r\ntint, but loss of light hardly seems capable of the whole effect. In\r\nthe case of Mars, then, as with the Moon, a mistaken inference builded\r\nbetter than it knew, if, indeed, we should rightly consider an\r\ninference to be mistaken which on half data lands us at the right door.\r\n\r\nFrom the aspects of the dark regions we are led, then, to regard Mars\r\nas having passed through that stage of existence in which the earth\r\nfinds itself at the moment, the stage at which oceans and seas form a\r\nfeature of its landscape and an impediment to subjugation of its\r\nsurface in its entirety. What once were ocean beds have become ocean\r\nbottoms devoid of that which originally filled them.\r\n\r\nThat the process of parting with a watery envelop is an inevitable\r\nconcomitant of the evolution of a planet from chaos to world, we do not\r\nhave to go so far afield as Mars and the Moon for testimony. Scrutiny\r\nreveals as much in the history of our own globe. Two signposts of the\r\npast, one geologic, the other paleontologic, point unmistakably in this\r\ndirection. The geologic guides us the more directly to the goal.\r\n\r\nStudy of the earth’s surface reveals the preponderating encroachment of\r\nthe land upon the sea since both began to be, and demonstrates that,\r\nexcept for local losses, the oceans have been contracting in size from\r\narchaic times. So much is evidenced by the successive places upon which\r\nmarine beds have been laid down. This suggests itself at once as a\r\ntheoretic probability to one considering the matter from a cosmic\r\nstandpoint, and it is therefore the more interesting and conclusive\r\nthat, from an entirely different departure-point, it should have been\r\none of the pet propositions of the late Professor Dana, who worked out\r\nconclusively the problem for North America, and published charts\r\ndetailing the progressive making of that continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of North America at the close of Archæan time,\r\nshowing approximately the areas of dry land. (From Dana’s “Manual of\r\nGeology.”)]\r\n\r\nSo telling is this reclaiming by nature of land from the sea that it\r\nwill be well to follow Dana a little into detail, as the details show\r\neffectively the continuity of the process acting through æons of\r\ngeologic time. At the beginning of the Archæan age, or, in other words,\r\nat the epoch when stratified beds were first laid down, the earth\r\nreached a turning-point in its history. Erosion, superficial and\r\nsub-aërial, then set in to help restrict the domain of the sea. At this\r\njuncture North America consisted of a sickle of terrane inclosing\r\nHudson’s Bay and coming down at its apex to a point not much removed\r\nfrom where Ottawa now stands, in about latitude 45°—a Labradorian\r\nNorth America only. This, the kernel of the future continent, curiously\r\nsymbolized the form that continent was later to take. For its eastern\r\nedge was roughly parallel to the present Atlantic coastline, although\r\nmuch within and to the north of it, while its western one was similarly\r\naligned afar off to the now Pacific slope. Besides this continent\r\nproper, the Appalachian, Rocky Mountain, Sierra Nevada, and Sierra\r\nMadre chains stood out of the ocean in long, narrow ridges of detached\r\nland, outlining in skeleton the bones of the continent that was to be.\r\nThe Black Hills of Dakota and other highlands made here and there\r\nislets in the sea.\r\n\r\nMuch the same backbone-showing of continents yet to be filled out was\r\ntrue of Europe, Asia, and South America. In Europe the northern\r\ncountries constituted all that could be called continental land. Most\r\nof Norway, Sweden, Finland, Lapland, existed then, while the northern\r\nhalf of Scotland, the outer Hebrides, portions of Ireland, England,\r\nFrance, and Germany stood out as detached islands. From this, which is\r\na fair sample of the proportion of land then to land now over the other\r\ncontinents so far as they are geologically known, we turn to consider\r\nmore in detail the history of North America.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Upper Silurian period came in, the Appalachian\r\nhighlands there had been greatly extended and joined to the Labradorian\r\nmainland by continuous territory; otherwise, no important addition had\r\noccurred, though islands emerged in Ohio, Kentucky, and Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North America at the opening of the Upper Silurian.\r\n(From Dana’s “Manual of Geology.”)]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Carbonic era what are now the Middle states\r\nhad begun to fill up from the north, and Newfoundland, from a small\r\nisland in the Upper Silurian, had become a great promontory of\r\nLabrador, while the Eastern states region and Nova Scotia had risen\r\ninto being. The movements closing Paleozoic time upheaved from low\r\nislands the Appalachian chain. The earth’s crust here crumpled by\r\ncontraction upon itself; and the movement ended, as Dana says, by\r\nmaking dry land of the whole eastern half of the continent, along\r\nsubstantially its present lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of North America after the Appalachian Revolution.\r\n(From Dana’s “Manual of Geology.”)]\r\n\r\nMesozoic time was the period of the making of the West. It was an era\r\nof deposition and coincident subsidence, when the western land had its\r\nnose just above water at one moment to be submerged the next. Though on\r\nthe whole this part of the continent was emerging, the fact was that,\r\nsynchronously with the sinking of the sea, much of the land from time\r\nto time sank too. The contraction which raised the Appalachian Mountains\r\nat the beginning of the period and that of the Rockies at its close\r\noverdid the necessities of the case and caused subsidence elsewhere.\r\nThe southeastern portion of the continent suffered most, the West on\r\nthe whole materially gaining. In the Triassic and Jurassic eras the\r\ngain was pronounced; it occurred in the Cretaceous also, but with much\r\nalternation of loss. Finally, at the close of the Cretaceous, the\r\ncontinent, except for a prolonged Gulf of Mexico and vast internal\r\nlakes, was substantially complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North America in the Cretaceous period. (From Dana’s\r\n“Manual of Geology.”)]\r\n\r\nThe filling up of these lakes and the reclaiming of land from the Gulf\r\nof Mexico constituted the land-making work of Tertiary times. The\r\nextent of the lakes in the Eocene era is held to show that the general\r\nlevel of the mountain plateau was low and rose later. So that the gain\r\nby the land at this time was greater than the map allows to appear. By\r\nthe beginning of the Quaternary epoch the continents had assumed their\r\npresent general area, and since then their internal features have alone\r\nsuffered change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of North America, showing the parts under water in\r\nthe Tertiary Era; the vertically lined is the Eocene. (From Dana’s\r\n“Manual of Geology.”)]\r\n\r\nA similar rising from the sea fell to the lot of Europe, though it has\r\nnot been detailed with so much care. The skeleton of that continent was\r\nat the beginning of depositary time much what it is to-day, but a great\r\ninland sea occupied the centre of it, which, as time went on, was\r\ngradually silted in and evaporated away, notably during the Upper\r\nSilurian period.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is pretty clear that, side by side with alternating\r\nrisings and sinkings of the land, there was a tolerably steady gain in\r\nthe contest by which dry ground dispossessed the sea. We may, of\r\ncourse, credit this to a general deepening of the ocean bottoms due to\r\ncrumpling of the crust, but we may also impute it to a loss of water,\r\nand that the latter is, at least for a part, in the explanation the\r\ncondition of the Moon and Mars makes probable.\r\n\r\nPaleontology has the same story of reclamation to tell as geology, and\r\nwith as much certainty, though its evidence is circumstantial instead\r\nof direct and speaks for the growing importance of the land in the\r\nglobe’s economy since the beginning of depositary time, and thus\r\ninferentially to its increasing extent. Fossil remains of the plants\r\nand creatures that have one after the other inhabited the earth show\r\nthat the land has been steadily rising both in floral and faunal\r\nestimation as a habitat from the earliest ages to the present day. The\r\nrecord lies imprinted in the strata consecutively laid down, and except\r\nfor gaps reads as directly on in bettering domicile as in evolutionary\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn Archæan times we find no undisputed evidence of life either vegetal\r\nor animal. But beds of graphite and of limestone point to the possible\r\nexistence of both. Even anthracite has been found in Archæan rocks in\r\nNorway and also in Rhode Island. Whether Dawson’s Eozoon Canadense be a\r\nrhizopod or a crystal, doctors of science disagree. Dana, while\r\nadmitting nothing specific, deems it antecedently probable that algæ\r\nand later microscopic fungi related to bacteria existed then, living in\r\nwater well up toward the boiling-point. Indeed, it is practically\r\ncertain that invertebrate life existed, because of its already\r\nwell-developed character in the next era. The like antedating is\r\ninferable for the whole record of the rocks. Relatively their history\r\nis undoubtedly fairly accurate, but absolutely it must be shifted\r\nbodily backward into the next preceding era to correspond with fact not\r\nyet unearthed.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Cambrian, when first the existence of life becomes a\r\ncertainty, that life, so far as known, was wholly invertebrate and\r\nwholly marine; rhizopods (probably), sponges and corals, echinoderms,\r\nworms, brachiopods, mollusks, and crustaceans grew amid primitive\r\nseaweed and have left their houses in the shape of shells while\r\nperishing themselves. Their tracks too have thus survived. The\r\ntrilobites, crustaceans somewhat resembling our horseshoe crab, were\r\nthe lords of the Cambrian seas and marked the point to which organic\r\nevolution had then attained. Their aquatic character as well as their\r\nsimple type is shown by their thoracic legs having each a natatory\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nIn the next era, the Lower Silurian, the fauna and flora were still\r\nmarine, although of a higher order than before, and in the Trenton\r\nperiod, the upper part of the era, the earliest vertebrates, fishes,\r\ncome upon the scene: ganoids and possibly sharks. Nothing terrestrial\r\nof this period has yet with certainty been unearthed in America. Europe\r\nwould seem to have either been more advanced then or better studied\r\nsince, for there the first plant higher than a seaweed has been dug up,\r\none of a fresh-water genus betokening the land; while in keeping with\r\nthis the first insect, an hemipter, also has been disinterred. Both the\r\ngeography and the life of the Eopaleozoic period Dana styles\r\n“thalassic.”\r\n\r\nNeopaleozoic time, beginning with the Upper Silurian, marked the\r\nemergence of the continents, and following them the emergence of life\r\nfrom the water on to this land. In the lower beds of the Upper Silurian\r\nin America we find only the aquatic forms of previous strata, but in a\r\nhigher one we come in marshes upon plants related to the equiseta or\r\nhorsetails. In England land plants appear for the first time in these\r\nlatest Silurian beds and in the schists of Angers have been preserved\r\nferns. In both the old world and the new fossil fishes are found and\r\nthe oldest terrestrial species of scorpions. But the great bulk of\r\nforms was still marine; corals, crinoids, brachiopods, trilobites\r\nconstituting the principal inhabitants. At this time the seas were\r\nwarm, having much the same temperature between 65° and 80° north as\r\nbetween 30° and 45°; the prevalence of a general temperate tropicality\r\nbeing shown by the fact that the common tropical chain corals lived in\r\nlatitude 82° north.\r\n\r\nIn the Devonian era, the Old Red Sandstone, fishes grew and multiplied,\r\nincreasing in size apparently through the era, and in the last period\r\nof it reaching their culminating point. These pelagic vertebrates much\r\nsurpassed in structure the terrestrial population of the time, which\r\nwas of a low type and consisted of invertebrates such as myriapods,\r\nspiders, scorpions, and insects; for the land was only making. In the\r\nmid-Devonian, forests of a primitive kind covered such country as there\r\nwas, an amphibious land, composed of jungles and widespread marshes.\r\nTree ferns made the bulk of the vegetation, but among them grew also\r\ncycads and yews. Mammoth may-flies flitted through the gloom of these\r\nold forests, but no vertebrate as yet had left the sea.\r\n\r\nFollowing upon the Old Red Sandstone were laid down the Carbonic\r\nstrata, and with the Carbonic entered upon the scene the advance scouts\r\nof an army of progress evolutionarily impelled to spy out the land—the\r\nfirst amphibians. They made their début in the Subcarboniferous section\r\nof the era, the oldest of the three periods into which the Carbonic is\r\ndivided, crawling out of the sea to return again and leaving but\r\nfootprints at first on the sands of time. In the second period, the\r\nCoal-measures proper, they ventured so far as to leave their skeletons\r\non terra firma, or rather infirma, while their tracks there show them\r\nto have been now in great numbers. In this manner the ancestors of the\r\noldest land inhabitants began to struggle out of the sea. In the\r\nPermian, the third and latest period of paleozoic times, we find their\r\ndescendants established in their new habitat, for in it we come upon\r\nthe first reptiles. Such possession marks a distinct step up in\r\nfunction as in fact, for while amphibians visited dry land, reptiles\r\nmade it their home. The getting out of the water had now, in the case\r\nof the more evolved forms, become an accomplished fact. The reptiles\r\nwere, indeed, the lowest and most generalized of their class,\r\nRhynchocephalians, “beak-headed” species that by their teeth proclaim\r\ntheir marine origin and their relationship to the great amphibians that\r\nstill felt undecided where to stay. Meanwhile, in Europe dragon-flies,\r\ntwo feet across, possessed the air; while amphibians there, as here,\r\nancestrally preceded reptiles in occupying the land.\r\n\r\nMesozoic times were, _par excellence_, the age of monsters; for the\r\nTriassic (the New Red Sandstone), Jurassic and Cretaceous eras marked\r\nthe reign of the reptiles. Great dinosaurs sleep still in the Triassic\r\nstrata of the Atlantic border and in the Jurassic of the Western\r\nstates, to be unearthed from time to time and be given mausolea in our\r\nmuseums. Gigantic they were and very literally possessed the earth. In\r\nEurope they were substantially as in America during these mesozoic\r\neras, and showed their dominance by long survival in time as well as\r\nworld-wide distribution in space; for they lived all the way from\r\nKansas to New Zealand and from the Trias to the Upper Cretaceous. It is\r\nsupposed by Professor Osborn that many of them, like the herbivorous\r\nbrontosaurus, waded in marshes, not wholly unlike in habit to the\r\nmodern hippopotamus. Others were land-stalking carnivores, like the\r\nmegalosaurs of a little later date. Of enormous size, the largest\r\nexceeded any animal which has ever lived, the whales alone excepted;\r\nthe biggest, the atlantosaurus and the brontosaurus, reaching a length\r\nof sixty feet. For all their bulk they had scant brains, just enough to\r\nenable them to feed and wallow, probably. It is interesting to note\r\nthat many of the reptiles, the less adventurous, apparently reverted to\r\nthe sea. For though the crocodilians existed already in the Trias, the\r\nplesiosaurians did not come in till the Middle Trias in Europe, and the\r\nsea-serpents (mosasaurus) till the Upper Cretaceous.\r\n\r\nThough the dinosaurs dominated life in those days, higher forms, their\r\ndescendants, unnoticed were gradually creeping in, eventually to\r\nsupplant them. For brain was making its way unobtrusively in the\r\nearliest of the mammals, diminutive creatures at first and of the\r\nlowest type. First appearing in the Trias as something approaching the\r\nmissing link between reptiles and mammals, they later developed into\r\nmonotremes and marsupials, not rising in differentiation above the\r\nlatter order to the end of Mesozoic times. And this both in the old\r\nworld and the new. In the Jurassic, too, flying lizards and the first\r\nbirds appeared, showing their pedigree in their teeth.\r\n\r\nWith Cenozoic times we come upon the first true or placental mammals\r\nwith their culmination up to date in man. In the Eocene they were of a\r\nprimitive type; they were also of a comprehensive one, fitted to eat\r\nanything. From this they specialized, some evolving and some on the\r\nwhole devolving; the whale, for instance, taking to the water in the\r\nEocene through the same degenerate proclivity that had characterized\r\nthe sea-saurians ages before. The earth was growing colder, though\r\nstill fairly warm, and with the fall in temperature the higher types of\r\nlife antithetically rose, evolution gradually fitting them to cope with\r\nmore advanced conditions. In this manner did the land supplant the sea\r\nas the essential feature of the earth’s surface, first, in coming into\r\nbeing, and then, by offering conditions fraught with greater\r\npossibilities, as the habitat of the most advanced forms of life, both\r\nplants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of advance in evolution was largely due to the fact\r\nthat the land did thus supplant the sea. Spontaneous variation, the as\r\nyet unexplained _primum mobile_ in the genesis of species, is probably\r\nto be referred to chemism and is likely later to receive its solution\r\nat the hands of that science. In the meanwhile it is evident that\r\nunless the variation obtain encouragement from the environment no\r\nadvance in type occurs. Now the land offers to an organism sufficiently\r\nevolved to benefit by it, opportunities the sea does not possess. First\r\nof these, undoubtedly, is the care it enables to be given to the young.\r\nTo cast one’s brood upon the waters is not the best method of insuring\r\nits bringing up. There is too much of the uncertainties of wave and\r\ncurrent to make the process a healthy one, and even when attached to\r\nrocks and seaweed, the attachment to a mother is to be preferred.\r\nWithout a period of infancy, when the young is unable to do for itself,\r\nno great development is possible. In the only striking exception, the\r\ncase of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, size has probably counted\r\nfor much in the matter, while the development of the cetaceans is far\r\nbehind that of the majority of land mammals.\r\n\r\nChange of place, not in distance, but in variety, is another factor.\r\nThe sea is same as a habitat, one square mile of it being much like\r\nanother, except for gradually changing temperature. The land, on the\r\nother hand, from its accidented surface, presents all manner of\r\ndiversity in the conditions. And the more varied the conditions to\r\nwhich the organism is exposed, the greater its own complexity must be\r\nto enable it to meet them.\r\n\r\nThat the terrestrial stage of planetary development is subsequent to\r\nthe terraqueous one, and must of necessity succeed it if the latter\r\never exist on a body, follows from the loss of internal heat on the one\r\nhand and from the kinetic theory of gases on the other. To which of the\r\ntwo to attribute the lion’s share in the business is matter for doubt;\r\nbut that both must be concerned in it we may take for certain.\r\n\r\nSo long as the internal heat suffices to keep the body fluid, the\r\nliquid itself sees to it that all interstices are filled. As the heat\r\ndissipates, the body begins to solidify, starting with the crust. For\r\ncosmic purposes it undoubtedly still remains plastic, but cracks of\r\nrelatively small size are both formed and persist. Into these the\r\nsurface water seeps. With continued refrigeration the crust thickens,\r\nmore cracks are opened and more water given lodgment within, to the\r\nimpoverishment of the seas. The process would continue till the\r\npressure of the crust itself rendered plastic all that lay below,\r\nbeyond which, of course, no fissures could be formed. How competent to\r\nswallow all the seas such earth cuticle cracks may be we ignore; for we\r\ncannot be said to know much of the process. We can only infer that to a\r\ncertain extent internal absorption of surface seas must mark a stage of\r\nthe evolution by which a star becomes a world and then an inert mass,\r\none of the dark bodies of which space is full.\r\n\r\nOf the other means we know more. We are certain that it must take\r\nplace, though we are in doubt as to the amount it has already\r\naccomplished. This method of depletion is by the departure of the water\r\nin the form of gas, in consequence of the molecular motions. If we knew\r\nthe temperature and the age of Mars and also the amount of atmosphere\r\noriginally surrounding it, we could possibly predicate its state.\r\nReversely, we can infer something as to age and temperature from its\r\npresent condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                        THE REDDISH-OCHRE TRACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth for their evidence and their extent the great ochre stretches of\r\nthe disk claim attention first. Largely unchangeable, these show\r\nessentially the same day after day and from the year’s beginning to its\r\nend. In hue they range from sand color to a brick red; some parts of\r\nthe planet being given to the one tint, some to the other. It is to the\r\nlatter that the fiery tint of Mars to the naked eye is due. The\r\ndifferences in complexion are local and peculiar, both in place and\r\ntime. For though saffron best paints the greater part of the light\r\nareas, certain localities present at times a red like that of our red\r\nsandstone. Hellas is one of these ruddy regions and Aeria another. It\r\nis only on occasion that they thus show, and to what to assign their\r\nvariability is as yet matter of conjecture. Possibly it is owing to\r\nMartian meteorologic condition; possibly to something else. But\r\nwhatever its origin, the change is not so much contradictory of, as\r\nsupplementary to, the general fact of unalterableness, which is after\r\nall the basic trait about them and the keynote to their condition.\r\n\r\nLand the ochre regions have generally been taken for, and land they\r\nstill make good their claim to be considered. For the better they are\r\nseen, the greater the ground for the belief. Indeed, they seem to be\r\nnothing but ground, or, in other words, deserts. Their color first\r\npoints them out for such. The pale salmon hue, which best reproduces in\r\ndrawings the general tint of their surface, is that which our own\r\ndeserts wear. The Sahara has this look; still more it finds its\r\ncounterpart in the far aspect of the Painted Desert of northern\r\nArizona. To one standing on the summit of the San Francisco Peaks and\r\ngazing off from that isolated height upon this other isolation of\r\naridity, the resemblance of its lambent saffron to the telescopic tints\r\nof the Martian globe is strikingly impressive. Far forest and still\r\nfarther desert are transmuted by distance into mere washes of color,\r\nthe one robin’s-egg blue, the other roseate ochre, and so bathed, both,\r\nin the flood of sunshine from out a cloudless burnished sky that their\r\ntints rival those of a fire-opal. None otherwise do the Martian colors\r\nstand out upon the disk at the far end of the journey down the\r\ntelescope’s tube. Even in its mottlings the one expanse recalls the\r\nother. To the Painted Desert its predominating tint is given by the new\r\nred sandstone of the Trias, the stratum here exposed; and this shows in\r\nall its pristine nakedness because of the lack of water to clothe it\r\nwith any but the sparsest growth. Limestones that crop out beside it\r\nare lighter yellow, whitish and steel-gray, and seen near give the\r\nterrane the look of a painter’s palette. Seen from far they have rather\r\nthe tint of sand; and the one effect, like the other, is Martian in\r\nlook. And as if to assimilate the two planetary appearances the more,\r\nthe thread of blue-green that attention traces athwart the Painted\r\nDesert marks the line of cottonwoods along the banks of the Little\r\nColorado River—deserts both, if look be any guarantee of character,\r\nwith verdure banding them.\r\n\r\nIn other ways these earthly deserts offer a parallel to the Martian. No\r\ndesert on the Earth is absolutely devoid of life of some kind, vegetal\r\nand animal. The worst conditioned are not what one is taught in\r\nchildhood to believe a desert to be—a vast waste of sand, with a camel\r\nand a palm thrown in to heighten the sterility. In all Saharas outside\r\nof the pages of the school books some vegetation grows, though it is\r\ncommonly not of a kind to boast of, being rather a _succés d’estime_,\r\nas sagebrush, cacti, and the like. But what is of interest here in the\r\nconnection is its color. For it is commonly of a more ochreish tint\r\nthan usual, in keeping with its surroundings, a paling out of the green\r\nto something more tawny, indicating a relative reduction of the\r\nchlorophyll and an increase of the lipochromes in the tissues of the\r\nplant, since the one gives the green tint to the leaves, the other the\r\nyellow. As this vegetation, poor as it is, has its annual history, it\r\nmust alter the look of the desert at times and produce precisely those\r\nslight variations in tint observable on Mars in like circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona desert dates from no further back than early Tertiary\r\ntimes, as the limestone of the Cretaceous there present shows. Water\r\nthen stretched where desert now is, and the limestone beds were laid\r\ndown in it. How old the Martian Saharas are we have no means of\r\nknowing. But one thing we may predicate about both: a desert is not an\r\noriginal, but an acquired, condition of a planet’s surface,\r\ndemonstrably so in the case of a planet which has had a sedimentary\r\nepoch in its life-history. In the Arizona desert the surface is\r\ncomposed of depositary rocks of Mesozoic times, except where lava\r\nstreams have flowed down over it since then. The land, then, was once\r\nunder water, and cannot but have been fertile for some time after it\r\nemerged.\r\n\r\nBut we are not left to inference in the matter, however good that\r\ninference may be. A little to the south of the Painted Desert, in the\r\nmidst of the barren plateau of northern Arizona, of which the former\r\nmakes a part, stand the remains of a petrified forest. Huge chalcedony\r\ntrunks of trees, so savingly transmuted into stone that their genus is\r\nstill decipherable, lie scattered here over the barren ground in waste\r\nprofusion, one of them still spanning a cañon just as it fell in that,\r\nto it, destructive day of a far prehistoric past. The rock stratum on\r\nwhich their remains lie is of Triassic and Cretaceous times and the\r\npetrifications show that in the Cretaceous a stately forest overspread\r\nthe land. In those days at least the spot was fertile where now sparse\r\nsagebrush and cacti find a living hard. Not here alone where the blocks\r\nare so conspicuous as to invite their carrying away is a former\r\nflourishing growth of vegetation attested, but over large adjoining\r\nareas of desert search has brought the like past tenancy to light.\r\nFragments of what once were trees have been picked up in the Little\r\nColorado basin and in the neighborhood of Ash Fork, on both sides, that\r\nis, of the present forest crown that covers the higher part of the\r\nplateau from which rise the San Francisco Peaks. In the blue distance\r\nthe mountains look down verdure-clad upon a now encircling waste, but\r\none which in earlier eras was as pine-bearing as they. Their lofty\r\noasis is all that is now left of a once fertile country; the retreat of\r\nthe trees up the slopes in consequence of a diminishing rainfall, until\r\na rise of two thousand feet from what once was timber-land is necessary\r\nto reach the tree-line of today, being typical of desert lands, and\r\ntestifying to greater aqueous affluence in the past. In the same manner\r\nstreams descend from the cedar-clad range of the Lebanon to lose\r\nthemselves in the Arabian desert just without the doors of Damascus;\r\nand Palestine has desiccated within history times. Palestine, a land\r\nonce flowing with milk and honey, can hardly flow poor water now, and\r\nfurnishes another straw to mark the ebbing of the water supply.\r\n\r\nThis making of deserts is not a sporadic, accidental, or local matter,\r\nalthough local causes have abetted or hindered it. On the contrary, it\r\nis an inevitable result of planetary evolution, a phase of that\r\nevolution which follows from what has been said in Chapter XII on the\r\nabandonment of a planet by its water. Deserts are simply another sign\r\nof the same process. The very aging which began by depriving a body of\r\nits seas takes from it later its forest and its grass. A growing\r\nscarcity of water is bound to depauperate the one, as it depletes the\r\nother. We have positive proof of the action in our own deserts. For\r\nthese bear testimony, in places at least, to not having always been so,\r\nbut to have gradually become so within relatively recent times. But we\r\nhave more general proof of the action from the position occupied on the\r\nearth’s surface by its deserts.\r\n\r\nThe significant fact about the desert-making so stealthily going on is\r\nthat only certain zones of the earth’s surface are affected. Those\r\nbelting the two tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, for several degrees on\r\neither side of them, most exhibit the phenomenon. Such positioning of\r\nthe deserts is not due to chance. Directly, of course, desertism is due\r\nto dearth of rain. This in turn depends on the character and condition\r\nof the winds. If a wind laden with moisture travel into a colder region\r\nof the globe, its moisture is precipitated in rain and we have a\r\nfertile country; if it voyage into a warmer clime it takes up what\r\nlittle moisture may be there already and a desert is the result.\r\n\r\nNow our system of winds is such as to produce a fall of rain for the\r\ndifferent latitudes, as tabulated by Supan, thus:—\r\n\r\n Zone          I     40°N-27°N Little rain in summer but much in winter.\r\n              II     27 N-19 N Little rain at all seasons.\r\n             III     19 N- 7 N Little rain in winter but much in summer.\r\n              IV      7 N- 1 N Abundant rain at all seasons.\r\n               V      1 N-17 S Little rain in winter but much in summer.\r\n              VI     17 S-30 S Little rain at all seasons.\r\n             VII     30 S-35 S Little rain in summer but much in winter.\r\n\r\nZones II and VI, the zones of minimum rainfall, are also those in which\r\nthe deserts occur. The northern one traverses southern California,\r\nArizona, New Mexico, the Sahara, Arabia, and the Desert of Gobi; the\r\nsouthern, Peru, the South African veldt, and central Australia. The\r\nbelts are wavy bands which by their form betray both a general\r\nunderlying trend to drought at these parallels and also the effect of\r\nlocal topography in the matter.\r\n\r\nFrom being distributed thus in belts, it is evident that the deserts\r\nare general globe phenomena, and from their being found only in the\r\nzones of least rainfall, that the earth has itself entered, though not\r\nfar as yet, upon the desert stage of its history. Once begun, the\r\ndesert areas must perforce spread as water becomes scarce, invading and\r\noccupying territory in proportion as the rainfall there grows small.\r\n\r\nNow the axial tilt of Mars is almost exactly the same as that of our\r\nEarth, the latest determinations from the ensemble of measures giving\r\n24° for it. Here, then, we have initial conditions reproducing those of\r\nthe earth. But from the smaller size of the planet that body would age\r\nthe earlier, since it would lose its internal heat the more rapidly,\r\njust as a small stone cools sooner than a larger one. On general\r\nprinciples, therefore, it should now be more advanced in its planetary\r\ncareer. In consequence, desertism should have overtaken more of its\r\nsurface than has yet happened on earth, and instead of narrow belts of\r\nsterility we should expect to find there Saharas of relatively vast\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nNow, such a state of things is precisely what the telescope reveals.\r\nThe ochre tracts occupy nine tenths of the northern hemisphere and a\r\nthird of the southern. Three fifths, therefore, of the whole surface of\r\nthe planet is a desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Desert areas.]\r\n\r\nOf cosmic as well as of particular import is the correlation thus made\r\nevident between the physical principles that effect the aging of a\r\nplanet and the aspect Mars presents. Experimental corroboration of\r\nthose laws is thus afforded, while, reversely, confidence in their\r\napplicability is increased. With continued observation the planet\r\nappears more desiccate as improved conditions bring it nearer. Dry land\r\nas it was thought to be proves even drier, something which lacks water\r\nfor the ordinary necessities of a living world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Desert areas.]\r\n\r\nThe picture the planet offers to us is thus arid beyond present\r\nanalogue on Earth. Pitiless as our deserts are, they are but faint\r\nforecasts of the state of things existent on Mars at the present time.\r\nOnly those who as travelers have had experience of our own Saharas can\r\nadequately picture what Mars is like and what so waterless a condition\r\nmeans. Only such can understand what is implied in having the local and\r\navoidable thus extended into the unescapable and the world-wide; and\r\nwhat a terrible significance for everything Martian lies in that single\r\nword: _desert_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                                SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, now, we review with the mind’s eye the several features of Mars\r\nwhich we have surveyed with the bodily one, we shall be surprised to\r\nfind to what they commit us. Suggestive as each is considered by\r\nitself, the _ensemble_ into which they combine proves of multiplicate\r\nforce in its implication. For each turns out to fit into place in one\r\nconsistent whole, a scheme of things in which are present all the\r\nconditions necessary to the existence and continuance of those\r\nprocesses which constitute what we call life. In short, we are\r\nconducted with a cogency, which grows as we consider it, to the\r\nconclusion that Mars is habitable.\r\n\r\nTwo ways of appreciating this cogency are open to us. We may treat it\r\nwith the simple reasoning of common-sense, as we should a dissected map\r\nor a piece of machinery in which we realize we are right when the\r\nseveral parts at last fit together and the picture stands revealed or\r\nthe machine works. Or we may subject the evidence to quantitative\r\nestimates for and against by the doctrine of probabilities, and thus\r\nevaluate the chances of its being correct. Consciously or\r\nunconsciously, this is what we are about in our decisions every day of\r\nour lives. At the one end of the line are those skillful judgments\r\nwhere the balance is so keen-edged that the least overweight on the one\r\nside dips the scales to a conclusion. At the other extremity stand\r\nthose deductions which we usually speak of as proved, such as the law\r\nof gravitation. But both assurances rest really upon probability and\r\ndiffer only in degree. What we mean by proof of anything is that a\r\nsupposition advanced to account for it explains all the facts and is\r\nnot opposed to any of them, and that the balance of probability in\r\nconsequence is very largely in its favor.\r\n\r\nNow, if several pieces of evidence, distinct in their origin, concur to\r\na given conclusion, the probability that that conclusion is correct is\r\nfar greater than what results from each alone; and mounts up soon to\r\nsomething much exceeding what bettors at races call certainty odds.\r\nHowever unversed the average man may be in calculating the probability,\r\nhe recognizes the fact in his dealings with his fellows by the way he\r\nattaches weight to concurrent testimony. It is such concurrent evidence\r\nthat we have now to consider. To this end we will marshal the several\r\nfacts ascertained in a summarized list for their easier intercomparison.\r\n\r\nThese facts are:—\r\n\r\n(1) Mars turns on its axis in 24 h. 37 m. 22.65 s. with reference to\r\nthe stars, and in 24 h. 39 m. 35.0 s. (as a mean) with regard to the\r\nSun. Its day, therefore, is only about forty minutes longer than ours.\r\n\r\n(2) Its axis is tilted to the plane of its orbit by about 23° 59′ (most\r\nrecent determination, 1905). This gives the planet seasons almost the\r\ncounterpart of our own in character; but in length nearly double ours,\r\nfor\r\n\r\n(3) Its year consists of 687 of our days, 669 of its own.\r\n\r\n(4) Polar caps are plainly visible which melt in the Martian summer to\r\nform again in the Martian winter, thus implying the presence of a\r\nsubstance deposited by cold.\r\n\r\n(5) As the polar caps melt, they are bordered by a blue belt, which\r\nretreats with them. This excludes the possibility of their being formed\r\nof carbon dioxide, and shows that of all the substances we know the\r\nmaterial composing them must be water.\r\n\r\n(6) In the case of the southern cap, the blue belt has widenings in it\r\nin places. These occur where the blue-green areas bordering upon the\r\npolar cap are largest.\r\n\r\n(7) The extensive shrinkage of the polar snows shows their quantity to\r\nbe inconsiderable, and points to scanty deposition due to dearth of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n(8) The melting takes place locally after the same general order and\r\nmethod, Martian year after year, both in the south cap,\r\n\r\n(9) And in the north one. This is evidenced by the recurrence of rifts\r\nin the same places annually in each. The water thus let loose can,\r\ntherefore, be locally counted on.\r\n\r\n(10) That the south polar cap is given to greater extremes than the\r\nnorth one, implies again, in view of the eccentricity of the orbit and\r\nthe tilt of the axis, that deposition in both caps is light.\r\n\r\n(11) The polar seas at the edges of the caps being temporary affairs,\r\nthe water from them must be fresh.\r\n\r\n(12) The melting of the caps on the one hand and their reforming on the\r\nother affirm the presence of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, of\r\nwhatever else that air consist.\r\n\r\n(13) Since water vapor is present, of which the molecular weight is 18,\r\nit follows from the kinetic theory of gases that nitrogen, oxygen, and\r\ncarbonic acid, of molecular weights 28, 32, and 38 respectively, are\r\nprobably there, too, owing to being heavier.\r\n\r\n(14) The limb-light bears testimony to this atmosphere.\r\n\r\n(15) The planet’s low albedo points to a density for the atmosphere\r\nvery much less than our own.\r\n\r\n(16) The apparent evidence of a twilight goes to confirm this.\r\n\r\n(17) Permanent markings show upon the disk, proving that the surface\r\nitself is visible.\r\n\r\n(18) Outside of the polar cap the disk is divided into red-ochre and\r\nblue-green regions. The red-ochre stretches have the same appearance as\r\nour deserts seen from afar,\r\n\r\n(19) And behave as such, being but little affected by change.\r\n\r\n(20) The blue-green areas were once thought to be seas. But they cannot\r\nbe such, because they change in tint according to the Martian season,\r\nand the area and amount of the lightening is not offset at the time by\r\ncorresponding darkening elsewhere;\r\n\r\n(21) Nor by any augmentation of the other polar cap or precipitation\r\ninto cloud. It cannot, therefore, be due to shift of substance.\r\n\r\n(22) Furthermore, they are all seamed by lines and spots darker than\r\nthemselves which are permanent in place; so that there can be no bodies\r\nof water on the planet.\r\n\r\n(23) On the other hand, their color, blue-green, is that of vegetation;\r\nthis regularly fades out, as vegetation would, to ochre for the most\r\npart, but in places changes to a chocolate-brown.\r\n\r\n(24) The change that comes over them is seasonal in period, as that of\r\nvegetation would be.\r\n\r\n(25) Each hemisphere undergoes this metamorphosis in turn.\r\n\r\n(26) That it is recurrent is again proof positive of an atmosphere.\r\n\r\n(27) The changes are metabolic, since those in one direction are later\r\nreversed to a restoration of the original status. Anabolic as well as\r\nkatabolic processes thus go on there; that is, growth as well as decay\r\ntakes place. This proves them of vegetal origin.\r\n\r\n(28) The existence of vegetation shows that carbonic acid, oxygen, and\r\nundoubtedly nitrogen, are present in the Martian atmosphere, since\r\nplants give out oxygen and take in carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n(29) The changes in the dark areas follow upon the melting of the polar\r\ncaps, not occurring until after that melting is under way;\r\n\r\n(30) And not immediately then, but only after the lapse of a certain\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n(31) Though not seas now, from their look the dark areas suggest old\r\nsea bottoms, and when on the terminator appear as depressions (whether\r\nbecause really at a lower level or because of less illumination is not\r\ncertain).\r\n\r\n(32) That they are now the parts of the planet to support vegetation\r\nhints the same past office, as water would naturally drain into them.\r\nThat such a metamorphosis should occur with planetary aging is in\r\nkeeping with the kinetic theory of gases.\r\n\r\n(33) Terminator observations prove conclusively that there are no\r\nmountains on Mars, but that the surface is surprisingly flat.\r\n\r\n(34) But they do reveal clouds which are usually rare and are often, if\r\nnot always, dust-storms.\r\n\r\n(35) White spots are occasionally visible, lasting unchanged for weeks,\r\nin the tropic and temperate regions, showing that the climate is\r\napparently cold,\r\n\r\n(36) But at the same time proving that most of the surface has a\r\ntemperature above the freezing-point.\r\n\r\n(37) In winter the temperate zones are more or less covered by a\r\nwhitish veil, which may be hoar-frost or may be cloud.\r\n\r\n(38) A spring haze surrounds the north polar cap during the weeks that\r\nfollow its most extensive melting.\r\n\r\n(39) Otherwise the Martian sky is perfectly clear; like that of a dry\r\nand desert land.\r\n\r\nThe way in which these thirty-nine articles fit into one another to a\r\nmortised whole is striking enough at first sight, but becomes more and\r\nmore impressive the more one considers it. For some are due to one kind\r\nof observation, some to another. In the taking they are unrelated; yet\r\nin the result they agree. Equally pregnant is the history of their\r\nacquisition. Most of them were detected as the outcome of observations\r\nat the opposition of 1894, and led to the theory which was published in\r\nthe writer’s first book on the subject. Others are the result of the\r\nfive oppositions that have since occurred. These have proved entirely\r\ncorroborative of the previous ones and of the theory then deduced, and\r\nthat in two distinct ways: first, by the accumulated evidence they have\r\nbrought to the matter along the old lines; and, secondly, by what they\r\nhave revealed in new directions. Of these thirty-nine articles of\r\nMartian scientific faith in observation or deduction, (9), (10), (21),\r\n(22), (25), (27), (28), (30), (33), (35), (36), and (38) are in whole\r\nor part new. That continued scrutiny is thus corroborative of the\r\nearlier results, both along the old and along new lines of\r\ninvestigation, warrants additional confidence in the conclusion.\r\n\r\nConsidering, now, these counts, we see that they make reasonably\r\nevident on Mars the presence of:—\r\n\r\n1. Days and seasons substantially like our own;\r\n\r\n2. An atmosphere containing water vapor, carbonic acid, and oxygen;\r\n\r\n3. Water in great scarcity;\r\n\r\n4. A temperature colder than ours, but above the Fahrenheit\r\nfreezing-point, except in winter and in the extreme polar regions;\r\n\r\n5. Vegetation.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost of these is air. In order to make it possible for\r\nvital processes of any sort to take place, the body of a planet must be\r\nclothed with an atmosphere, by the modesty of nature, the old\r\nastronomers would have said. Such a covering subserves two purposes: it\r\nkeeps out the cold of space, thus permitting the maintenance of a\r\ntemperature sufficient to support life, and it affords a medium through\r\nwhich metabolism can go on.\r\n\r\nNow the presence of air is attested first and foremost by the fact of\r\nchange in the Martian markings, (12), (13), (26), (28), and (35). The\r\nchanges observed are conspicuous; are both inorganic (in the case of\r\nthe polar caps), (12), (13), and (35), and metabolic or organic, (26)\r\nand (28), (in the case of the blue-green areas); that is, they consist\r\nof building up as well as of pulling down and are planet-wide in\r\noccurrence. Such changes could not occur in the absence of an\r\natmosphere. They show that this atmosphere consists of water vapor,\r\n(5), carbonic acid, and oxygen, (28).\r\n\r\nThe limb-light, the apparent evidence of a twilight arc and the\r\nplanet’s low albedo indicate that this atmosphere is thin. The\r\nappearance of the surface, (35), suggests cold, indicative again of a\r\nthin air. Such tenuity is in accord with what _a priori_ principles\r\nwould lead us to expect, and tends to show that reliance on general\r\nprinciples is here not misplaced, a point of some interest.\r\n\r\nLastly, the occurrence of clouds, (34), visibly floating and traveling\r\nover the surface, and haze at times, (38), proves in another way the\r\nexistence of the medium in which alone this could be possible.\r\n\r\nWater is the next substance vital to planetary life. As to its actual\r\npresence the polar caps, (4)-(12), have most to say; as to its relative\r\nabsence, the rest of the disk, (17)-(22). The forthright conception of\r\nthe polar caps as composed of snow and ice is borne out by further\r\ninvestigation into what could cause the observed phenomenon. Carbonic\r\nacid, the only other substance we know capable in any way of resembling\r\nwhat we see, turns out not capable of producing one important detail of\r\nthe caps’ appearance, the blue band, (5), which accompanies them in\r\ntheir retreat. Water alone could do this.\r\n\r\nThe melting of the caps shows that water vapor must be a constituent of\r\nthe Martian atmosphere. Moreover, as the molecular weight of water\r\nvapor is less than that of oxygen or nitrogen or carbon dioxide, if the\r\nformer can exist in the atmosphere of the planet, _a fortiori_ must\r\nthese other gases. So that from this we have knowledge of the\r\npossibility of the presence of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide\r\nthere. From (28) we saw that their actual existence is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe next step is the ascertainment that the water is in very small\r\namount. The extensive melting of the caps, (7), shows their quantity to\r\nbe inconsiderable, which is the first fact pointing to a dearth of\r\nwater. The second comes from the aspect and behavior of the\r\nreddish-ochre regions which proclaim them deserts, (18) and (19); the\r\nthird from the detection of the character of the blue-green areas as\r\nnot seas, (20), (21), and (22). In several different ways, study of\r\nthese regions asserts their non-aquatic constitution, the easiest to\r\nappreciate being that they are traversed by permanent dark lines and\r\nother equally sedentary markings, (22). No bodies of water, therefore,\r\nare to be seen outside of the ephemeral polar seas, immediately\r\nsurrounding the caps as they melt.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the third presence on Mars indicative of a living\r\nworld: vegetation. The other two spoke of substances necessary to life,\r\nthe premises in the case, this one of organic existence itself, its\r\nconclusion. The evidence consists of static testimony from the look of\r\nthe blue-green areas, (23), and of kinematic derived from their\r\nbehavior, (24), (25), (26), and (27). Vegetation would present exactly\r\nthe appearance shown by them, and nothing that we know of but\r\nvegetation could. But suggestive as their appearance is, it is as\r\nnothing compared with the cogent telltale character of their behavior.\r\nThe seasonal change that sweeps over them is metabolic, constructive as\r\nwell as destructive, that is, and proclaims an organic constitution for\r\nthem such as only vegetation could produce. In tint their metamorphoses\r\nare those of the same substance. For the blue-green lapses into ochre\r\nand revives again to blue-green just as vegetation does on our own\r\nEarth at the proper season of the year, taking both the Sun and the\r\nadvent of water into the reckoning. Furthermore, certain of the largest\r\ndark areas turn to a chocolate-brown at times, which is the color of\r\nfallow ground and suggestive, at least, as occurring where the\r\nblue-green at other seasons is the most pronounced. Lastly, the change\r\noccurs at the epoch at which, from a knowledge of the melting of the\r\npolar caps, theory demonstrates that it ought to take place if it be\r\ndue to the action of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThat this was the case was evident from much less information than is\r\nforthcoming today; but what is significant, each new fact discovered\r\nabout the planet goes to show that it is unquestionably true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n                          NON-NATURAL FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                               THE CANALS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the detection of the main markings that diversify the surface of\r\nMars we now pass to a discovery of so unprecedented a character that\r\nthe scientific world was at first loath to accept it. Only persistent\r\ncorroboration has finally broken down distrust; and, even so, doubt of\r\nthe genuineness of the phenomena still lingers in the minds of many who\r\nhave not themselves seen the sight because of the inherent difficulty\r\nof the observations. For it is not one where confirmation may be\r\nsummoned in the laboratory at will, but one demanding that the watcher\r\nshould wait upon the sky, with more than ordinary acumen. This\r\nlatter-day revelation is the discovery of the canals.\r\n\r\nQuite unlike in look to the main features of the planet’s face is this\r\nsecond set of markings which traverse its disk, and which the genius of\r\nSchiaparelli disclosed. Unnatural they may well be deemed; for they are\r\nnot in the least what one would expect to see. They differ from the\r\nfirst class, not in degree, but in kind; and the kind is of a wholly\r\nunparalleled sort. While the former bear a family resemblance to those\r\nof the earth; the latter are peculiar to Mars, finding no counterpart\r\nupon the earth at all.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the mystery came about in this wise, and will be\r\nrepeated for him who is successful in his search. When a fairly acute\r\neyed observer sets himself to scan the telescopic disk of the planet in\r\nsteady air, he will, after noting the dazzling contour of the white\r\npolar cap and the sharp outlines of the blue-green seas, of a sudden be\r\nmade aware of a vision as of a thread stretched somewhere from the\r\nblue-green across the orange areas of the disk. Gone as quickly as it\r\ncame, he will instinctively doubt his own eyesight, and credit to\r\nillusion what can so unaccountably disappear. Gaze as hard as he will,\r\nno power of his can recall it, when, with the same startling\r\nabruptness, the thing stands before his eyes again. Convinced, after\r\nthree or four such showings, that the vision is real, he will still be\r\nleft wondering what and where it was. For so short and sudden are its\r\napparitions that the locating of it is dubiously hard. It is gone each\r\ntime before he has got its bearings.\r\n\r\nBy persistent watch, however, for the best instants of definition,\r\nbacked by the knowledge of what he is to see, he will find its coming\r\nmore frequent, more certain and more detailed. At last some\r\nparticularly propitious moment will disclose its relation to well-known\r\npoints and its position be assured. First one such thread and then\r\nanother will make its presence evident; and then he will note that each\r\nalways appears in place. Repetition _in situ_ will convince him that\r\nthese strange visitants are as real as the main markings, and are as\r\npermanent as they.\r\n\r\nSuch is the experience every observer of them has had; and success\r\ndepends upon the acuteness of the observer’s eye and upon the\r\npersistence with which he watches for the best moments in the steadiest\r\nair. Certain as persistence is to be rewarded at last, the difficulty\r\ninherent in the observations is ordinarily great. Not everybody can see\r\nthese delicate features at first sight, even when pointed out to them;\r\nand to perceive their more minute details takes a trained as well as an\r\nacute eye, observing under the best conditions. When so viewed,\r\nhowever, the disk of the planet takes on a most singular appearance. It\r\nlooks as if it had been cobwebbed all over. Suggestive of a spider’s\r\nweb seen against the grass of a spring morning, a mesh of fine\r\nreticulated lines overspreads it, which with attention proves to\r\ncompass the globe from one pole to the other. The chief difference\r\nbetween it and a spider’s work is one of size, supplemented by greater\r\ncomplexity, but both are joys of geometric beauty. For the lines are of\r\nindividually uniform width, of exceeding tenuity, and of great length.\r\nThese are the Martian canals.\r\n\r\nTwo stages in the recognition of the reality confront the persevering\r\nplodder: first, the perception of the canals at all; and, second, the\r\nrealization of their very definite character. It is wholly due to lack\r\nof suitable conditions that the true form of the Martian lines is\r\nusually missed. Given the proper prerequisites of location or of eye,\r\nand their pencil-mark peculiarity stands forth unmistakably confessed.\r\nIt is only where the seeing or the sight is at fault that the canals\r\neither fail to show or appear as diffuse streaks, the latter being a\r\nhalfway revelation between the reality and their not being revealed at\r\nall. Much misconception exists on this point. It has been supposed that\r\nimproved atmospheric conditions simply amount to bringing the object\r\nnearer by permitting greater magnification without altering the hazy\r\nlook of its detail.[2] Not so. They do much more than this. They steady\r\nthe object much as if a page of print from being violently shaken\r\nshould suddenly be held still. The observer would at once read what\r\nbefore had escaped him for being a blur. So is it with the canals. In\r\nreality, pencilings of extreme tenuity, the agitations of our own air\r\nspread them into diffuse streaks; an effect of which any one may assure\r\nhimself by sufficiently rapid motion of a drawing in which they are\r\ndepicted sharp and distinct, when he will see them take on the streaky\r\nlook. As the writer has observed them under both aspects, and has seen\r\nthem pass from the indefinite to the defined as the seeing improved, he\r\nhas had practical proof of the fact, and this not once, but an untold\r\nnumber of times.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric conditions far superior to what are good enough for most\r\nastronomic observations are needed for such planetary decipherment, and\r\nthe observer experienced in the subject eventually learns how\r\nall-important this is. Under these conditions the testimony of his own\r\neyesight upon the character of these markings is definite and complete.\r\nAnd the first trait that then emerges from confusion is that the\r\nmarkings are _lines_; not simply lines in the sense that any\r\nsufficiently narrow and continuous marking may so be called, but lines\r\nin the far more precise sense in which geometry uses the term. They are\r\nfurthermore straight lines. As Schiaparelli said of them: they look to\r\nhave been laid down by rule and compass. The very marvel of the sight\r\nhas been its own stumbling-block to recognition, joined to the\r\ndifficulty of its detection. For not only is the average observatory\r\nnot equipped by nature for the task, but what is not good air often\r\nmasquerades as such. Trains of air waves exist at times so fine as to\r\nconfuse this detail, or even to obliterate it entirely; while at the\r\nsame time they leave the disk seemingly sharp-cut, with the result that\r\none not well versed in such vagaries thinks to see well when in truth\r\nhe is debarred from seeing at all. When study of the conditions finally\r\nends in putting him upon the right road, the sight that rewards him can\r\nhardly be too graphically described.\r\n\r\nNext to the fact that they are _lines_, definiteness of direction is\r\nthe chief of their characteristics to strike the observer. The lines\r\nrun straight throughout their course. This is absolutely true of ninety\r\nper cent of them, and practically so of the remaining ten per cent,\r\nsince the latter curve in an equally symmetric manner. Such directness\r\nhas I know not what of immediate impressiveness. Quite unlike the\r\naspect of the main markings, which show a natural irregularity of\r\noutline, these lines offer at the first glance a most unnatural\r\nregularity of look. Nothing on Earth of natural origin on such a scale\r\nbears them analogue. Nor does any other planet show the like. They are,\r\nin fact, distinctively Martian phenomena. This is the first point in\r\nwhich they differ from the markings we have hitherto described. The\r\nothers were generic planetary features; these are specific ones,\r\npeculiar to Mars.[3]\r\n\r\nEqually striking is the uniform width of each line from its beginning\r\nto its end, as it stands out there upon the disk. The line varies not\r\nin size throughout its course any more than it deviates in direction.\r\nIt counterfeits a telegraph wire stretched from point to point. Like\r\nthe latter seen afar, the width, too, is telegraphic. For it is not so\r\nmuch width as want of it that is evident. Breadth is inferable solely\r\nfrom the fact that the line is seen at all, and relative size by\r\ndifference of insistency. Indeed, the apparent breadth has been\r\nsteadily contracting as the instrumental, atmospheric, and personal\r\nconditions have improved. All three of the factors have conduced to\r\nsuch emaceration, but the middle one the most. For the air waves spread\r\nevery marking, and the effect is relatively greatest upon those which\r\nare most slender. As the currents of condensation and rarefaction pulse\r\nalong, their denser and their thinner portions refract the rays on\r\neither side of their true place, and thus at the same time confuse a\r\nmarking and broaden it. The consequence is that the better the\r\natmospheric conditions and the more that has been learned about\r\nutilizing them, the finer the lines have shown themselves to be.\r\n\r\nHerein we have a specific intrinsic difference between the fundamental\r\nfeatures and these lines: the main markings have extension in two\r\ndimensions, the latter in one.\r\n\r\nDistinctive as they thus are, they have, in keeping with their\r\nappearance, been given a distinctive name, that of canal. Useful as the\r\nname is and, as we shall later see, applicable, it must not be supposed\r\nthat what we see are such in any simple sense. No observer of them has\r\never considered them canals dug like the Suez Canal or the phœnix-like\r\nPanama one. This supposition is exclusively of critic creation.\r\n\r\nTheir precise width is not precisable. They show no measurable breadth\r\nand their size, therefore, admits for certain only of an outside limit.\r\nThey cannot be wider than a determinable maximum, but they may be much\r\nless than this. The sole method of estimating their width is by\r\ncomparison of effect with a wire of known caliber at a known distance.\r\nFor this purpose a telegraph wire was stretched against the sky at\r\nFlagstaff, and the observers, going back upon the mesa, observed and\r\nrecorded its appearance as their stations grew remote. It proved\r\nsurprising at what great distances a slender wire could be made out\r\nwhen thus projected against the sky. The wire in the experiment was but\r\n0.0726 of an inch in diameter and yet could be seen with certainty at a\r\ndistance of 1800 feet, at which point its diameter subtended only 0.69\r\nof a second of arc. How small this quantity is may be appreciated from\r\nits taking more than ninety such lines laid side by side to make a\r\nwidth divisible by the eye. Such slenderness at the then distance of\r\nMars would correspond, under the magnification commonly used, only to\r\nthree quarters of a mile. Theoretically, then, a line three quarters of\r\na mile wide there should be visible to us. Practically, both light and\r\ndefinition is lost in the telescope, and it would be nearer the mark to\r\nconsider in such case two miles as the limit of the perceptible. With\r\nthe planet nearer than this, as is often the case, the width which\r\ncould be seen would be proportionally lessened. Perhaps we shall not be\r\nfar astray if we put one mile as the limiting width which could be\r\nperceived on Mars at present, with distance at its least and definition\r\nat its best.\r\n\r\nThat so minute a quantity should be visible at all is due to the line\r\nhaving a sensible length and by summation of sensations causing to rise\r\ninto consciousness what would otherwise be lost. A stimulus too feeble\r\nto produce an effect upon a single retinal rod becomes recognizable\r\nwhen many in a row are similarly excited.\r\n\r\nThe experiment furnished another criterion, of importance as regards\r\nthe supposition that the lines on Mars are illusory. It showed that\r\nbrain-begotten impressions of wires that did not exist could be told\r\nfrom the real thing when the wire subtended 0.69 of a second of arc or\r\nmore; that below this the outside stimulus was too weak to differ\r\nrecognizably from optic effects otherwise produced; while when the real\r\nwire was diminished to 0.59′′, it could not be seen at all. Now, the\r\nmajority of lines on Mars so far recognized and mapped lie in strength\r\nof impression far above the superior limit of 0.69′′. To one versed in\r\nMartian canal detection there is no possibility of self-deception in\r\nthe case, the canals being very much more salient objects to an expert\r\nthan those who have not seen them suppose. For it must not be imagined\r\nthat, when one knows what to be on the lookout for, they are the\r\ndifficult objects they seem to the tyro. Just as the satellites of Mars\r\nwere easily seen once they were discovered, so with these lines.\r\n\r\nA mile or two we may take, then, with safety as the smallest width for\r\none of the lines. The greatest was got by comparing what is by far the\r\nlargest canal, the Nilosyrtis, with the micrometer thread. From such\r\ndetermination it appeared that this canal was from 25 to 30 miles wide.\r\nBut it is questionable whether the Nilosyrtis can properly be termed a\r\ncanal, so much does it exceed the rest. It is certainly far larger than\r\nthe majority of them. From comparative estimates between its size and\r\nthat of the others, 15 to 20 miles for the width of the larger of the\r\nMartian canals seems the most probable value, and 2 or 3 miles only of\r\nthe more diminutive of those so far detected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing the Eumenides-Orcus.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the length of the canals is relatively enormous.\r\nWith them 2000 miles is common; while many exceed 2500, and the\r\nEumenides-Orcus is 3540 miles from the point where it leaves the Phœnix\r\nLake to the point where it enters the Trivium Charontis. This means\r\nmuch more on Mars than it would on Earth, owing to the smaller size of\r\nthe planet. Such a length exceeds a third of the whole circumference of\r\nits globe at the equator. But what is still more remarkable, throughout\r\nthe whole of the long course taken by the canal, it swerves neither to\r\nthe right nor to the left of the great circle joining the two points.\r\n\r\nOf these several peculiarities of the individual canal it is difficult\r\nto know to which to allot the palm for oddity,—great circle\r\ndirectness, excessive length, want of width, or striking uniformity.\r\nEach is so anomalously unnatural as to have received the approving\r\nstamp of incredulity. Yet so much, wonderful as it is, is encountered\r\non the very threshold of the subject.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  M. l’abbé Moreux.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  As some misrepresentation has been made on this subject through\r\n  misapprehension of the writer’s observations on Venus and Mercury, it\r\n  may be well to state that the tenuous markings on both these other\r\n  planets entirely lack the unnatural regularity distinguishing the\r\n  canals of Mars. The Venusian lines are hazy, ill-defined, and\r\n  non-uniform; the Mercurian broken and irregular, suggesting cracks.\r\n  Neither resemble the Martian in marvelous precision, and have never\r\n  been called canals by the writer nor by Schiaparelli, but solely by\r\n  those who have not seen them and have misapprehended their character\r\n  and look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                              THEIR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch more stands beyond. For, outdoing in suggestiveness the individual\r\ntraits of the lines, is the relation shown by them to one another. It\r\nis the communal characteristics of the phenomenon that are most\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nThe individual peculiarities of the lines impress themselves at once;\r\nthe communal, only as the result of experience, collation, and thought.\r\nAs the observer becomes trained, the more lines he is able to make out,\r\nuntil they fairly seam the whole surface of the light areas of the\r\nplanet. Their name collectively is legion; while to name them\r\nindividually is fast getting, for the number detected, to be\r\nimpossible. As with the increasing family of asteroids, figures alone\r\nwill prove adequate to the task.\r\n\r\nInterdependence, not independence, marks the attitude of the canals.\r\nEach not only proceeds with absolute directness from one point to\r\nanother, but at its terminals it meets canals which have come there\r\nwith like forthrightness from other far places upon the planet. Nor is\r\nit two only that thus come together at a common junction. Three, four,\r\nfive,—up to as many as fourteen,—thus make rendezvous, and it is a\r\npoor junction that cannot show at least six or seven. The result is a\r\nnetwork which triangulates the surface of the planet like a geodetic\r\nsurvey into polygons of all shapes and sizes, the Arian areolas. The\r\nsize of the pieces forming this tesselate ground depends solely upon\r\nthe fineness of the definition. With every increase in the power of\r\nseeing, each areola is cut into still smaller portions, usually by\r\nconnection between its corners. Thus a polygon or rhombus is split into\r\ntriangles which may themselves be divided in like manner, the mosaic\r\nbreaking into bits, the sides of which, however, always remain\r\nclean-cut.\r\n\r\nFrom this arrangement it is at once evident that the canals are not\r\nfortuitously placed. That lines should thus meet exactly and in numbers\r\nat particular points, and only there, shows that their locating is not\r\nthe outcome of chance. If very thin rods be thrown haphazard over a\r\nsurface, the probability that more than two will cross at the same\r\npoint is vanishingly small. Increasingly assured is it that this would\r\nnot happen generally. The result we see is therefore not a matter of\r\nchance, but of some law working to that end.\r\n\r\nTo the detection of what that law is precedes the easier ascertainment\r\nof what it is not. The lines, for example, cannot be rivers, which was\r\nthe first explanation offered of them by Proctor many years ago,\r\nbecause of their peculiar straightness. Nor can they be channels, the\r\nname given to them by Schiaparelli, except in the non-committal sense\r\nin which he used the term. For here again their geometric regularity is\r\nbar to any estuary-like hypothesis. For quite another reason they\r\ncannot be cracks, because of their uniform size throughout. Their\r\nunbroken character is another fatal objection to the same suggestion.\r\nFor cracks in ground never pursue for any great distance a continuous\r\ncourse, any more than they keep uniform or straight. The state of an\r\nold ceiling is a case in point. When it breaks, it does so in fissures\r\nthat proceed a certain way, then give out to be continued by others\r\nroughly parallel to the first, but parted from them. The same character\r\nis shown by the rills on the moon. The ‘Straight Wall,’ so called, is\r\ncomposed of three such sections, and the little rill to the right of\r\nit, west of Birt, of four.\r\n\r\nThus were they seen at Flagstaff, and as, to the writer’s knowledge,\r\nthey have not been so depicted elsewhere, the fact may serve to give\r\nsome idea of the definition there.\r\n\r\nThat the underlying cause is not explosion or contraction is also\r\nevidenced by the canals collectively as well as individually, their\r\narrangement into a system, for cracks, however produced, could only\r\noriginate from certain centres and could not fit into those starting\r\nfrom others, as the canals invariably do. For each canal goes as\r\nundeviatingly to one terminal as it left forthrightly from another. If\r\none wishes to see what explosion or contraction can do, he has only to\r\nlook at the moon through an opera-glass, when he will be shown a very\r\ndifferent sight from what the drawings of Mars detail. Thus just as,\r\nconsidered individually, the lines cannot be watercourses because of\r\ntheir straightness, so they cannot be cracks because of dovetailing\r\ninto one another.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they form a system shows that whatever caused them\r\noperated over the whole planet, linked in cause as in effect throughout\r\neach section. This at once negatives any purely physical cause of which\r\nwe have cognizance. For upon a globe still so subject to physical\r\nvicissitude as Mars by its aspect shows itself to be, latitude must\r\ntell in the phenomena its zones exhibit. Polar snows that wax and wane\r\nspeak of arctic conditions very diverse from temperate and tropic\r\nstates, and what would affect the one could not influence the other.\r\nYet the mesh rises superior to zonal solicitation as to local barrier.\r\nIt is not something dependent either on the temperament or the\r\ncomplexion of the globe’s different parts. It transcends surface\r\nrestriction and becomes planet-wide in its working. The importance of\r\nthis omnipresence dilates in meaning as one dwells in thought upon it.\r\n\r\nUbiquitous as it is, the mesh which thus covers the Martian surface\r\nlike a veil spread completely over it, is unlike a veil in being of\r\nirregular texture. Not only are the interstices of various shape and\r\npattern, but the mesh itself is of locally differing size. Though the\r\nthreads are straight and uniform throughout, they are not all alike,\r\nbesides being unsymmetrically interwoven. Some are at least of ten\r\ntimes the coarseness of others, and from this fact and the bo-peep\r\neffect of our air waves all are not visible at once. In consequence the\r\nnetwork is not so impressive at first glance as it becomes upon a\r\nsynthesis of the observations. When this is done, the surface proves to\r\nbe fairly evenly cut up, as recourse to the maps printed in this volume\r\nwill amply demonstrate. These maps, as on page 31, are made from the\r\nresults of but one opposition, and as at each opposition some zone is\r\nin a more canal-showing state than others, owing to the Martian season\r\nat the time, a still greater uniformity in canal distribution results\r\nfrom a blending of many.\r\n\r\nFrom the completeness of the mesh, it follows that in the course taken\r\nseverally by the canals no one direction preponderates over another.\r\nConsidered by and large, the canals seem to be equally distributed\r\nround the compass points; and this at all longitudes and nearly all\r\nlatitudes. Tropic, temperate, and even arctic canals show a pleasing\r\nimpartiality in the matter of the course pursued. The only exceptions\r\noccur in the neighborhood of the pole. There a slight tendency may be\r\nseen to a north and south setting.\r\n\r\nThough so much is visible in a general way from the map, it is of\r\ninterest to go into the subject with more particularity and to that end\r\nto show it statistically. The several canals traversing each zone were\r\ntherefore counted, and the area of the zone computed. The manner of\r\ncanal distribution thus found is given in the following table, in the\r\nsecond column of which stand the areas of the several zones upon the\r\nplanet, each ten degrees wide, except the one next the snow, and in the\r\nthird the number of canals found traversing them, reduced to\r\npercentages of the 0°-10° zone. A fourth column shows the total length\r\nof the canals in each zone, those from 0° to 20° being taken from the\r\n1896 globe, those from 20° to 90° from the 1903. This is in order to\r\nannul the effect of the seasons upon the showing of the canals as much\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n  ===============+===============+===============+===============\r\n       ZONE      |     AREA      | NO.

Much the same result is got\r\nif we take the actual canal-lengths in each zone, as the fourth column\r\nshows. The crowding of the canals poleward is marked. The canals,\r\ntherefore, are phenomena that stand in peculiar relationship to the\r\npolar cap. This corroborates the inference about them due to their\r\nrunning out of the edge of the snow. They not only emanate from it, but\r\nthey do so in numbers surpassing what is elsewhere observable over the\r\ndisk.\r\n\r\nOtherwise is it with their departure-points. These are not scattered\r\nhaphazard over the surface, but bear to its general features definite\r\nrelations. If we consider the map, obliterating the lines, and then\r\nseek to connect the most salient points of the planet’s topography by\r\ndirect avenues of communication, we shall find that our putative lines\r\nfall exactly where the real ones occur. For the most part, the real\r\nlines emanate from well-marked indentations in the dark regions, fitted\r\nby natural position for departure-points, what, if these were seas, we\r\nshould call their most conspicuous bays. They thus leave in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere the deeper folds of the great diaphragm, for the\r\nmost part; though on occasion they run out of them where they will.\r\nFrom equally conspicuous points in the dark northern areas other lines\r\nproceed; while in the centre of the continents, the canals make for\r\nmore or less salient spots, small patches of shading like the Trivium\r\nor the Wedge of Casius, or simply round black radiants, like the Luci\r\nIsmenii.\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that the lines are locally dependent upon the\r\ngeneral topography of the fundamental features of the surface. For\r\nsome reason they connect the very points most suggestive of\r\nintercommunication. As from their characteristics it is perfectly\r\nevident that the lines are neither rivers nor cracks, it follows that\r\nsuch a communicating habit is of the most telltale character. To be\r\nso dissimilar in kind from the main markings and yet so dependent\r\nupon them, hints that their positioning occurred after the formation\r\nof the main features themselves. We reach thus from the look of the\r\nlines and their location a most striking deduction, that the lines\r\nare not coeval with the main markings, but have come into being later\r\nand with reference to the general topography of the planet. The\r\nnetwork is not only a mesh _de facto_, then, but one _de jure_,\r\nwhich, subsequent to the fashioning of the seas and continents and\r\nwhat these have now become, has been superposed upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                        GEMINATION OF THE CANALS\r\n\r\n\r\nFraught with more difficulty than the detection of the lines alone is\r\nthe next discovery made upon the disk: the recognition of pairs of\r\nlines traversing it.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, while Schiaparelli was engaged in scrutinizing the strange\r\n_canali_ he had discovered on the planet the opposition before, he was\r\nsuddenly surprised to mark one of them double. Two closely parallel\r\nlines confronted him where but a single one had previously stood. So\r\nunaccountable did the sight seem, that he hesitated to credit what he\r\nsaw, being minded to attribute the vision to illusion of some sort and\r\nthe more so that it was not renewed. While he was still wondering what\r\nit meant, the planet parted company with the Earth, carrying its enigma\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nWhen the two bodies again drew near to one another in 1882,\r\nSchiaparelli set himself to watch for a recurrence of the strange\r\nphenomenon. Before long it came, and more bewilderingly than at first;\r\nfor not one canal alone, but a score of them now showed in duplicate,\r\neach presenting to his astonished gaze twin lines perfectly matched and\r\npreserving throughout their distance apart. Suspecting diplopia or some\r\nother optical trick, he tried various eyepieces to a test of the cause\r\nbut to no change in the effect. The twin lines continued visible, do\r\nwhat he would, insisting on their own reality in spite of all\r\nsolicitation to merge. How cautious he was in the matter, and how\r\nunwilling at first to believe the evidence of his eyes, is shown by the\r\ncare he took to guard against deception. It was not until he had\r\nassured himself of the reality of the phenomena that he believed what\r\nhe had seen.\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that my first experience of the thing was almost equally\r\nstartling, so unexpected was it and so exceedingly sharp was the\r\ndefinition at the time. It was in an autumn early twilight, through air\r\nalmost perfectly still, as the light went out of the sky and the\r\nmarkings on the planet began to come forth that the Phison of a sudden\r\nshowed in duplicate to me, clear-cut upon the disk, its twin lines like\r\nthe rails of a railway track traversing Aeria. Not more vivid do those\r\nof our transcontinental tracks appear as one sees them stretching off\r\ninto the distance upon our Western plains. More impressive was the\r\nsight from the fact that I was not looking for it. It simply suddenly\r\nstood forth, this strange parallelism of pencil lines. My surprise\r\nmatched the wonder of the sight.\r\n\r\nSince then I have witnessed it several hundred times, but never with\r\nmore absolute certainty than at that first fortunate revelation. To\r\nthis distinctness is due the amazement it then aroused. Not simply\r\nbecause of its surpassing novelty, but for the insistence with which it\r\nproclaimed itself was the effect to be ascribed. Less well seen, doubt\r\nhad robbed it of its full surprise. It requires as a rule steady\r\ndefinition for its initial unmistakable showing, if one would be\r\ninstantly convinced. Except for such it is not usually easy to the\r\nunpracticed, though often discernible to the expert after it has once\r\nbeen seen. But that it is real no one who had had a good view of the\r\nsight could doubt; still less after the experience had been repeated\r\nover and over again.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to take place is this: where previously a single\r\npencil-like line joined two well-known points upon the disk, twin\r\nlines, the one the replica of the other, stand forth in its stead. The\r\ntwo lines of the pair are but a short distance apart, are of the same\r\nsize, of the same length, and absolutely equidistant throughout their\r\ncourse. It is as if a second line had in some way been mysteriously\r\nadded to the first since the latter was last seen some weeks before.\r\nThis in a word is the phenomenon, technically called the gemination of\r\nthe canals, which has since its discovery called forth so much comment.\r\nIt is not in reality quite as simple or as sudden as it seems, but this\r\nwas the way in which the phenomenon was first seen and in which it\r\nstill continues to be criticised.\r\n\r\nSelf-assertive of reality, the double lines are patently objective to\r\nhim who is fortunate enough to see them well. Nevertheless the great\r\ndifficulty of detecting them, and the still greater difficulty of\r\nconceiving how such things can be, has led many not versed in the\r\nsubject to disbelieve and from that to attempt to explain the sight as\r\nillusory. Scepticism seeks self-justification; what is hard of\r\nacceptance for its strangeness begetting hypotheses of committed error\r\nwhich find easy credence for their comforting conservatism. Several\r\nsuch have in consequence been propounded to account for the double\r\ncanals. There is the diplopic theory which credits them to\r\nnon-focusing; the interferential theory which would make them optical\r\nproducts of the telescope; and the illusion theory which would have\r\nthem quite simply imaginary.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as in any research the assurance that a phenomenon is real is\r\nthe first point about it to be established, it is a scientist’s duty,\r\nnot only to scan the phenomena with jealous care to that end, but to\r\nscrutinize every theory which would seek otherwise to account for\r\nthem—the testing such being only second in importance to observing the\r\nthings themselves. Accordingly I have examined each of the optical\r\ntheories that have been advanced and critically compared what they\r\nassert and require with the results of observation. The outcome of this\r\nresearch has proved as negativing to any other origin for the double\r\ncanals than reality as direct observations at the telescope are\r\npositive on the point. To show this I shall review each in its\r\nconsequences, confronting it with what the telescope has to say on the\r\nsubject; for it is of the pith of the matter that the reality should be\r\nas demonstrable on demand as on sight. Furthermore, I shall do this\r\nbefore embarking on the general account of these strange things,\r\nbecause it is vital to any interest that one should be assured from the\r\nstart of the truth of what he is to read. The preface may seem to him\r\nabstruse and prosy, but it will introduce him to some curious optical\r\nproperties and will eventually enhance his concern by proving to him\r\nthat what reads like fiction is all the more wonderful for being fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _I. The Diplopic Theory_\r\n\r\nDiplopia is the property of seeing double with one eye. Surprising as\r\nit sounds it is an effect not unknown to students of optics, though it\r\nusually requires training to produce. It is possible only when the eye\r\nis not focused on the object, and is not always possible then. From my\r\nexperiments its feasibility seems to depend upon whether the focus be\r\nbeyond or before what it should be. If the eye be focused for a point\r\nbeyond the object, the object is doubled, if for a point this side of\r\nit, the latter is simply blurred. When the double is formed, the amount\r\nof the separation of the two images is a function of the distance the\r\nfocus is out. The greater the discrepancy, the wider apart is the\r\nensuing double. Nor does the image, of a line, for example, stop at\r\ndoubling. After a certain breadth of separation is reached a third line\r\nappears, bisecting the interval between the other two. With yet greater\r\nwidening the third line itself splits into a pair and so the resolution\r\ngoes on. In my own experiments I have gone so far as to suspect a fifth\r\nline. Far from being unconscious, the process of producing the\r\nphenomenon is, with some people, of difficult accomplishment. Mr.\r\nLampland, for instance, of the Flagstaff Observatory, to whom we owe\r\nthe first photographing of the canals, and who sees the doubles of Mars\r\nwithout difficulty, has hitherto found diplopic vision an impossible\r\nfeat. Even with the most practiced diplopia is never unconscious except\r\nwhen the object viewed, as a micrometer wire, has nothing to locate it\r\nin space. Now, the diplopic theory of the double canals supposes that\r\nin all cases the eye of the observer is thus unconsciously out of focus.\r\n\r\nTo this method of their manufacture the telescopic phenomena prove\r\nunamenable on five counts.\r\n\r\n1. Focusing the eye on an object is now a reflex action, so automatic\r\nhas it become; in consequence one is commonly directly conscious when\r\nan object is not in focus, always so when the object presents detail.\r\nWere such not the case we should never, except by chance, see anything\r\ndefined. Observing through a telescope, after a modicum of practice,\r\ndiffers in no respect from observing in everyday life. Consequently,\r\nthat an experienced observer should not know his business in so primary\r\na matter is preposterous. One may or may not believe that “the undevout\r\nastronomer is mad,” but that the perpetually unfocused one would be is\r\nbeyond debate.\r\n\r\n2. Generically unlikely, the failure to focus is here specifically out\r\nof the question. For the observer does not use the canals to focus on\r\nfor the simple reason that he cannot. Like all delicate detail, the\r\ndoubles appear not continuously but by flashes of revelation, according\r\nas the atmospheric waves permit of passage undisturbed. To focus on\r\nthem would be next to impossible even were it resorted to—which it\r\nnever is. By the exponents of the theory this important fact is\r\noverlooked: the unforeseen showing of the canals and therefore the\r\nabsolute lack of complicity of the eye in the matter. What one focuses\r\non is the look of the main markings of the disk. Now, to suppose an\r\nobserver systematically out in his perceptions of so featureful a\r\nplanet as that of Mars, so that he does not know when he sees its image\r\nsharp, implies a lack of knowledge of astronomic observation in the\r\nsupposer.\r\n\r\n3. Study by the writer shows the width of a given double canal to be\r\nconstant for a given date. Within the errors of perception or recording\r\nthe twin lines are always at the same epoch the same distance apart.\r\nThe greater the number of determinations made, the nearer the result\r\napproaches to this mean; and the greater the care used in delineation,\r\nthe less each value departs from it.\r\n\r\nNow, if the thing were a matter of mistaken focusing, an eye could not\r\nbe thus true to its own mistakes. If it were out in its focus by a\r\ncertain amount at one time, it would be likely to be out by a different\r\namount at another. So that by the very terms of its making a diplopic\r\ndouble would be sure to vary. Indeed, in laboratory experiments it is\r\nimpossible to prevent it. For the eye rests itself automatically by\r\nchange of focus, and if it be not consciously kept awry it reverts as\r\nnear to the true focus as it can of its own accord.\r\n\r\n4. Diplopia might be a respecter of persons, but it certainly could not\r\nbe one of canals. For a given observer it must be objectively general\r\nin its application to the same class of objects. Consequently, if the\r\ndoubling were diplopic, all canals inclined at the same angle to the\r\nvertical—for the tilt might affect the result were the eye\r\nastigmatic—should be similarly affected. Parallel canals should\r\nparallel each other’s action. With the Martian doubles this is not the\r\ncase. Of two canals similarly inclined the one will be double, the\r\nother not, at the same instant and under conditions that are alike. And\r\nthis persistently. For gemination is an attribute of certain canals and\r\nnever of others. At a given season of the Martian year, some canals are\r\nregularly double, some invariably single. Night after night and\r\npresentation after presentation these idiosyncrasies are preserved: the\r\ndoubles, always pairs, the single, always alone. Nor does the strength\r\nof the line affect the action. The single canals are some of them\r\nstronger, some of them weaker, than the doubles seen at the same time.\r\n\r\n5. If of diplopic origin the mean width of all the doubles should be\r\nthe same. For though the diplopic width would vary for a given canal\r\naccording to the moment, a sufficient number of views would yield a\r\nmean width which would be the same for all. Tilt apart, the mean width\r\nof one canal would be that of another. Among Martian doubles, on the\r\ncontrary, I have found the width to be a specific property of the\r\nparticular canal. Each has its own mean width regardless of\r\ninclination, and this individual width differs as between one and\r\nanother by as much as five to two, or, if we consider such canals as\r\nthe Nilokeras I and II, by more than ten to two.\r\n\r\nAny one of these five points is fatal to the theory; _a fortiori_ all.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _II. The Interference Theory_\r\n\r\nFrom the wave propagation of light it follows that the image of a\r\nbright line made by a lens is not itself a simple bright line but a\r\nbright band flanked by alternate dark and bright ones. It has,\r\ntherefore, been suggested that a bright medial line is here concerned\r\nand that the double canal is the first of its dark pair of outriders.\r\nBut the suggestion does not bear scrutiny.\r\n\r\n1. It presupposes a central streak brighter than the rest of the disk\r\nto give birth to the twin dark lines. This should itself be visible in\r\nthe image; but no such bright backbone is seen.\r\n\r\n2. It demands a perfectly definite width of separation for a given\r\naperture—which is not that observed.\r\n\r\n3. It makes the width a function of the aperture, decreasing as this\r\nincreases—which is not sustained by observation. Different apertures\r\nproduce no effect on the widths of the Martian doubles, as the writer\r\nhas shown (Lowell Observatory Bulletin, No. 5) by a change of aperture\r\nfrom twenty-four to six inches.\r\n\r\n4. Under like optical conditions the optically produced doubles would\r\nbe all of a width; while the Martian ones show idiosyncratic widths,\r\neach peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _III. The Illusion Theory_\r\n\r\nKnown also as the Small Boy Theory from the ingenuous simplicity on\r\nwhich it rests, this theory attacks the reality of the doubles by\r\nquestioning that of the canals _en bloc_. Because some boys from the\r\nGreenwich (Reform or) Charity School, set to copy a canal-expurgated\r\npicture of the planet, themselves supplied the lines which had\r\npreceptorily been left out, the Martian canals have been denied\r\nexistence; which is like saying that because a man may see stars\r\nwithout scanning the heavens, therefore those in the sky do not exist.\r\nAs to the instructions the boys received we are left in the dark. It\r\nlooks as if some leading questions had unconsciously been put to them.\r\nAt all events, English charity boys would seem to be particularly\r\npliant to such imagination, for when Flammarion retried the experiment\r\nwith French schoolboys, and even inserted spaced dots for the canals in\r\nthe copy, not a boy of them drew an illusory line.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, this is one of those deceptive half-truths which is so\r\nmuch more deleterious than an unmitigated mistake. Under certain\r\ncircumstances it is quite possible to perceive illusory lines, due\r\neither to shadings otherwise unmarked and thus synthesized or to\r\nimmediately precedent retinal impressions transferred to places where\r\nthey do not belong by rapid motion of the eye, as I had myself\r\ndiscovered before the English experiment had been tried. But, as I have\r\nalso found out, these effects are produced only at the limit of vision,\r\nand in that limbo of uncertainty the whole art of the observer consists\r\nin learning to distinguish the true from the false. Strength of\r\nimpression, renewed effect _in situ_, and a peculiar sense of reality\r\nor the reverse enable him to adjudge the two. More experience than the\r\nboys possessed would have helped them to part the sheep from the goats.\r\nBut, furthermore, and fatally to the theory here in question, the\r\nMartian canals when well seen are not at the limit of vision as its\r\nframers supposed, but well within that boundary of doubt; so that the\r\npremise upon which the whole theory rests gives way. Under good\r\natmospheric conditions the canals are comparable for conspicuousness to\r\nmany of the well-recognized Fraunhofer lines and are just as certainly\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThus each attempt to prove the doubles non-objective turns out when\r\nspecifically examined to be inconsistent with the facts. With the\r\nassurance of their reality thus made doubly sure, we pass to\r\nconsideration of the things themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                           THE DOUBLE CANALS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nRightly viewed, no more subtle tribute could be paid to the remarkable\r\ncharacter of the phenomenon of gemination than the scepticism with\r\nwhich it was immediately received and which it still continues to\r\nelicit. That the sight should be regarded as illusory speaks for its\r\nsurpassing strangeness; and so far as oddity goes the encomium is\r\ncertainly deserved. Of the bizarre features of this curiously marked\r\ndisk, the double canals were at the time of their discovery the\r\nculmination, and though things stranger still if possible have since\r\nbeen seen there, it is not wonderful that doubt should still\r\nincredulously stare. If the mere account of them reads like romance, to\r\nsee them is an experience.\r\n\r\nNothing astronomical that I have ever seen has been so startlingly\r\nimpressive as my first view of a double canal. Even in narration the\r\nthing justifies its effect. For a double canal consists of a pair of\r\ntwin dark filaments, perfectly parallel throughout their course and\r\ninclosing between them ground of the same ochreish cast as that which\r\nlies without. Only on occasion is this tint of their midway departed\r\nfrom, and then only toward a darkening, never toward a lightening of\r\nit. Except for appearing paired, the lines resemble precisely the usual\r\nsingle canals. In length they vary from a few hundred to a few thousand\r\nmiles, while in width each component, for narrowness, hardly permits of\r\ndefinite ascription.\r\n\r\nCompared for strength with the usual canal the lines of a double seem\r\nto hold on the average an intermediate position between the larger and\r\nthe smaller of the single canals so far detected. Owing, however, to\r\nthe massed effect of the pair by reason of their closeness, they have\r\nan advantage in showing over the singles of two to one. And this\r\nrenders them among the most conspicuous and important meshes of the\r\ncanal network.\r\n\r\nLike the single canals, they vary in strength with the Martian time of\r\nyear; at certain seasons developing into heavy pencil lines and at\r\nothers fading away to the merest gossamers, only just discernible like\r\ncobwebs stretched across the face of the planet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the individual constituent lines vary in aspect and never rise\r\nat their most to cognizable breadth, the distance parting their\r\ncentres, or the width of the double, is quite measurable. The only\r\ndifficulty in the way of its determination lies in the absence of a\r\nprocurable unit small enough to mete it. The usual spider-threads of\r\nthe micrometer are colossal in comparison with these filaments and\r\npresent a standard only analogic at best. Nevertheless, by means of the\r\nfinest threads that could be got, estimates of the distance between the\r\npairs were made at Flagstaff in 1905, and the results agree as closely\r\nas the means permit with those got by measurement of the doubles as\r\ndepicted in the drawings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Martian doubles.]\r\n\r\nOf what they look like, the following illustrations give a fair idea,\r\nonly that instead of being more geometrically regular in the drawing\r\nthan in reality the fact is the other way. Freehand draftsmanship at\r\nthe telescope is incapable of rendering their ruled effect. No railway\r\nmetals could be laid down with more precision. As to their size, the\r\nfollowing figures derived from a typical double canal, the Phison, give\r\nsome conception. This great artery of intercommunication between the\r\nSabaeus Sinus and the Nilosyrtis is, roughly speaking, 2250 miles long;\r\nthe distance between the centres of the two constituents is about 130\r\nmiles, and each line is perhaps 20 miles in breadth, when at its\r\nmaximum strength. The pair follow, apparently, the arc of a great\r\ncircle from the Portus Sigaeus on the Mare Icarium to the Pseboas Lucus\r\nin latitude 40° north. The Portus Sigaeus consists of two little nicks\r\nin the coastline, looking like the carets one makes in checking off\r\nitems down a list, if the space between the down and up strokes were\r\nthen filled in; the Pseboas Lucus, on the other hand, is a large round\r\ndot like a small ink spot. To these two differently appearing spots,\r\nthe twin lines of the Phison behave differently. While each line leaves\r\ncentrally its own caret of the Portus Sigaeus at the south, at the\r\nnorth each touches peripherally the Pseboas Lucus, on the east and west\r\nsides respectively, the two thus just holding the Lucus between them.\r\nIn position the lines are invariable, though in visibility not.\r\nSometimes only one is seen, sometimes both show faintly, and sometimes\r\nboth are conspicuously strong. The delicacy of the observations by\r\nwhich this detail was established is second only to its importance. It\r\ndestroys at a stroke all possibility of diplopic unreality, since were\r\nthat the fact the Pseboas Lucus should be doubled, which it is not. At\r\nthe same time it opens vistas into the true construction of the things\r\nthemselves, at present more suggestive than satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Martian doubles (corroborating the above).]\r\n\r\nIn the great circle character of its course the Phison is quite normal.\r\nThe majority of the double canals pursue the like method, running\r\nstraight over the surface from one point to another, the constituents\r\nremaining equidistant throughout. But such forthrightness of direction,\r\nthough the rule, is not without exceptions. The Thoth-Nepenthes, for\r\nexample, sweeps round in a seemingly continuous curve to the\r\nwest-southwest from the Aquae Calidae to the Lucus Moeris like some\r\nmighty bow perpetually bent. Nevertheless its lines are no less careful\r\nfor all their curving to keep their distance from one end to the other\r\nof their course. The quality of being paired rises superior to change\r\nof direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nNow, the first point to be noticed about the doubles is that\r\nbilateralism, or the quality of being double, is not a universal trait\r\nof the canals, either actually or potentially; it is not even a general\r\none. Out of the four hundred canals seen at Flagstaff, only fifty-one\r\nhave at any time displayed the quality; that is, one eighth roughly of\r\nthe whole number observed. This point is most important; for the fact\r\nis of itself enough to disprove any optical origin for the phenomenon.\r\nThe characteristic of doubling so confidently ascribed by those who\r\nhave not seen it to general optical or ocular principles proves thus\r\nthe exception, not the rule, with the canals, and by so doing disowns\r\nthe applicability of any merely optical solution. We shall encounter\r\nmany more equally prohibitive bars to illusory explanation before we\r\nhave done with the doubles, but it is interesting to meet one in this\r\nmanner at the very threshold of the subject.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the characteristic when possessed is persistent in\r\nthe particular canal, _in posse_ if not _in esse_. Once shown by a\r\ncanal, that canal may confidently be looked to at a proper time to\r\ndisclose it again. In short, bilateralism, or the state of being dual,\r\nis an inherent attribute of the individual canal, as idiosyncratic to\r\nit as position and size.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of canals possessing this property, so far as they have\r\nbeen detected at Flagstaff to date, number fifty-one if we include in\r\nthe list wide parallels like the Nilokeras I and II. Eight of these\r\nwere observed in 1894; nineteen more were added in 1896, making\r\ntwenty-seven; in 1901 the total was raised to thirty; in 1903 to\r\nforty-eight; and in 1905 to fifty-one. Arranged by years they are\r\ntabulated below, where the numeral to the left registers for each its\r\nfirst recording and the position held by it in the list. The starred\r\ncanals much exceed the others in width, and possibly denote a different\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\n              DATE                   CONFUSED\r\n              1894\r\n\r\n           1.

Naarmalcha\r\n\r\nIn spite of possessing the property of pairing, a canal may not always\r\nexhibit it. To the production of the phenomenon the proper time is as\r\nessential as the property itself. So far as a primary scanning or first\r\napproximation is capable of revealing, a canal will be single at one\r\nMartian season and double at another. Thus these canals alternated in\r\ntheir state to Schiaparelli and for the earlier of his own observed\r\noppositions to the writer. In consequence Schiaparelli deemed\r\ngemination a process which the canal periodically underwent. Three\r\nstages in the development were to him distinguishable: the single\r\naspect, a short confused aspect, and the clearly dual one.\r\n\r\nIn the single state the canal remained most of the time. It then\r\nunderwent a chrysalid stage of confusion to emerge of a sudden into a\r\nperfect pair. Furthermore, he noted the times at which the pairing took\r\nplace, to the formulating of a law in the case—derived from the\r\nobservations of more than one opposition. His law was that the\r\ngemination occurred, on the average, three months (ours) after the\r\nsummer solstice of the northern hemisphere, lasted four to five months,\r\nthen faded out to begin afresh one month after the vernal equinox of\r\nthe same hemisphere and continue for four months more. Expressed in\r\nMartian seasonal chronology, the periods would be about half as long.\r\nAt certain times then the most pronounced specimens of doubles showed\r\nobstinately single, while the periodic metamorphosis that transformed\r\nthem into duplicates was timed to the changes of the planet’s year.\r\nGemination, then, was a seasonal phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAdvance in our knowledge of the phenomenon since Schiaparelli’s time,\r\nwhile still showing the thing to be of seasonal habit, has changed our\r\nconception of it. It now appears that in some cases certainly, and\r\npossibly in all, the dual aspect is not a temporary condition, but the\r\ndiffering pronouncement of a permanent state, the fact of gemination so\r\ncalled being confined to a filling out of what is always skeletonly\r\nthere. As the canals have come to be better seen, the three stages of\r\nexistence have in some cases become recognizable as only different\r\ndegrees in discernment of an essential double condition; the single\r\nappearance being due to the relative feebleness of one of the\r\nconstituents and the confused showing to the weakness of both, which\r\nare then the more easily blurred by the air waves. In certain canals\r\nthe last few oppositions, 1901, 1903, and 1905, have disclosed this\r\nunmistakably to be the case, as with the Phison and Euphrates, for\r\nexample. With them the double character has been continuously visible,\r\nappearing not only when by Schiaparelli’s law it should, but at the\r\ntimes when it should not; only on these latter occasions it was harder\r\nto see, whence the reason it was previously missed. So that further\r\nscrutiny, while in no sense discrediting the earlier observations, has\r\nextended to them some modification, and disclosed the underlying truth\r\nto be the varying visibility, the thing itself, except for strength in\r\npart or whole, persisting the same. Improvement in definition has\r\nlowered the see-level to revelation of continuous presence of the dual\r\nstate. It is only on occasion that the improvement is sufficient for\r\nthe thing when at its feeblest to loom thus above the horizon of\r\ncertainty; yet at such moments of a rise in the seeing it is enough to\r\nallow it to be glimpsed. Thus it fared with the Adamas at the\r\nopposition of 1903, with the Gigas, and with many another in years gone\r\nby. Separation has come with training and generally in the case of the\r\nwider doubles, which leads one to infer that ease of resolution is\r\nlargely responsible for assurance of the permanency of the dual state.\r\nPerplexing exceptions, however, remain, so that it is possible at\r\npresent only to predicate the principal of most of the double canals\r\nbut not of all. Leaving the exceptions out of account for the moment,\r\nwe pass to those general characteristics which are intimately linked\r\nwith what has just been said.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the act of getting into a state antedates the fact of being\r\nthere, it is logical to let the description of the first precede. An\r\naccount of the process of gemination may thus suitably come before that\r\nof its result.\r\n\r\nFlux, affecting the double canals in whole or part, is the cause of the\r\napparent gemination. According as the flux is partitive or total is a\r\nsingle or a dual state produced. At the depth of its inconspicuousness\r\nthe canal may cease to be visible at all; this occurs when both lines\r\nfade out. On the other hand, the one line may outfade the other, and we\r\nare presented with a seemingly single canal, at this its minimum\r\nshowing. In such seasons of debility the one line may appear and the\r\nother not, or occasionally the other show and the one not, according to\r\nthe air waves of the moment. It is at these times that the double\r\nsimulates a single canal, and unless well seen and carefully watched\r\nmight easily masquerade successfully as such. The Hiddekel in the depth\r\nof its dead season is peculiarly given to this alternately partitive\r\npresentation. As the flux comes on, one or both lines feel it. If one\r\nonly we are likely to have a confused canal; if both, a difficult\r\ndouble. The strength of the lines increases until at last both attain\r\ntheir maximum, and the canal stands revealed an unmistakable pair, the\r\ntwo lines paralleling one another in appearance as in position.\r\n\r\nAt the canal’s maximum and minimum the equality of its two constituents\r\nis chiefly to be remarked, though it occurs on other occasions as well.\r\nBut, what is significant, when the two differ it is always the same one\r\nthat outdoes its fellow. It may be the right-hand twin in one pair, the\r\nleft-hand one in another; but whichever it be, for the particular canal\r\nits preëminence is invariable. It is this canal which, except for\r\nadventitious help or hindrance from the air-waves, alone shows when the\r\ndouble assumes the seemingly single state. We may therefore call it the\r\noriginal canal, the other being dubbed the duplicate. In some cases it\r\nhas been possible to decide which is which. It might seem at first\r\nsight as if this point should always be ascertainable. But the\r\ndetermination is more dilemmic than appears, not from any difficulty in\r\nseeing the canal, but from the absence of distinguishing earmark at its\r\nend. In a long stretch of commonplace coast, the precise point of\r\nembouchure of a solitary canal cannot be so certainly fixed as to be\r\ndecisive later between two which show close together in the same\r\nlocality. It is only where some landmark points the canal’s terminal\r\nthat the problem admits of definite solution. This telltale tag may be\r\na bay like the Margaritifer Sinus, or double gulfs like the Sabaeus\r\nSinus, or portions of a marking not too large to permit of partitive\r\nlocation like the Mare Acidalium, or a canal connection like the\r\nTacazze which prolongs the one line and not the other. In these and\r\nsimilar instances the two lines become capable of identification, and\r\nin such manner have been found those comprised in the following list:—\r\n\r\n  ===================+===================+================\r\n                     |                   |    DATE OF\r\n  DOUBLE CANAL       | ORIGINAL  LINE    | ASCERTAINMENT\r\n  -------------------+-------------------+----------------\r\n  Phison             | The Eastern       |     1894\r\n  Euphrates          | The Western       |     1894\r\n  Titan              | The Western       |     1896\r\n  Hiddekel           | The Eastern       |     1896\r\n  Gihon              | The Western       |     1896\r\n  Gigas              | The Northwestern  |     1896\r\n  Djihoun            | The Western       |     1901\r\n  Laestrygon         | The Eastern       |     1903\r\n  Nilokeras I and II | The Northern      |     1903\r\n  Astaboras          | The Southern      |     1903\r\n  Jamuna             | The Eastern       |     1905\r\n  Ganges             | The Western       |     1905\r\n  ===================+===================+================\r\n\r\nIn this list of originals the canals stand chronologically marshaled\r\naccording to date of detection. The Phison and Euphrates were the first\r\nto permit of intertwin identification in 1894, while the Jamuna and\r\nGanges were the last to be added to the column in 1905. The list is not\r\nlong, though the time taken to compile it was. In the case of the\r\nGanges and the Jamuna, for example, although suspected for some time on\r\ntheoretic grounds, it was only at the opposition just passed that the\r\nfact was observationally established. In his _Memoria_ V, Schiaparelli\r\nhas a list of similar detection, and if the present list be compared\r\nwith his, the two having been independently made, the concordance of\r\nthe result will prove striking, corroborative as it is of both. For the\r\nnecessary observations are very difficult.\r\n\r\nHaving thus realized the original by means of its superior showing, and\r\nthen identified it by its position, it is suggestive to discover that\r\nthe duplicate betrays its subordinate character, not only by its\r\nrelative insignificance, but by its secondary position as well. The\r\noriginal always takes its departure from some well-marked bay,\r\nseemingly designated by nature as a departure-point, or from a caret\r\nbelonging clearly to itself; the adjunct, on the other hand, leaves\r\nfrom some neighboring undistinguished spot, as in the case of the\r\nadditional Djihoun, or makes use of a neighbor’s caret, as in the case\r\nof the second Phison and the supplementary Euphrates. In either case it\r\nplays something of the part of an afterthought; and yet the postscript\r\nwhen finished reads as an integral part of the letter. An example will\r\nserve to make the connection evident while leaving the character of the\r\nconnection as cryptic as ever.\r\n\r\nIn the long stretch of Aerial coastline bounding the Mare Icarium,\r\nwhich sweeps with the curve of a foretime beach from the Hammonis Cornu\r\nto the tip of the Edom Promontory, there stand halfway down its\r\nfar-away seeming sea-front two little nicks or indentations. Even in\r\npoor seeing they serve to darken this part of the coast while in good\r\ndefinition they come out as miniature caret-like bays. They are the\r\nPortus Sigaei, and mark the spots where the Phison and the Euphrates\r\nrespectively leave the coast. About four degrees apart, the eastern\r\nmakes embouchure to the original Phison, the western to the original\r\nEuphrates, and each in some mysterious manner is associated not only in\r\nposition but in action with the canal itself. In the single state each\r\ncanal leaves the Mare from this its own caret, the Phison proceeding\r\nthence northeast down the disk, the Euphrates nearly due north, so that\r\nstarting four degrees apart at the south they are forty degrees asunder\r\nat their northern termini. Clearly at these latter points they are not\r\neven neighbors, and except for the accident of close approach at their\r\nother ends have nothing in common anywhere. And yet when gemination\r\ntakes place a curious thing occurs: each borrows its neighbor’s\r\nterminal as departure-point for its own duplicate canal. Having thus\r\ngot its base the replica proceeds to parallel its own original canal\r\nwithout the least reference to the other canal whose own caret it has\r\nso cuckoo-wise appropriated. What the Phison thus does to the\r\nEuphrates, the Euphrates returns the compliment by doing to the Phison.\r\nIn this manner is produced an interrelation which suggests, without\r\nnecessarily being, an original community of interest; suggests it on\r\nits face and yet appears to be rather of the nature of an adaptation to\r\nsubsequent purposes of a something aboriginally there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mouths of Euphrates and Phison._\r\n\r\n_June. 1903._]\r\n\r\nThat such latter-day appropriation is the fact is clearly hinted by the\r\nbehavior of another understudy of an original canal, in this case the\r\nduplicate of the Djihoun, which in consequence of the position of its\r\noriginal finds no neighboring embouchure already convenient to its use.\r\nThe single or original Djihoun leaves the tip of the needle-pointed\r\nMargaritifer Sinus, which serves a like end to the Oxus and the Indus,\r\nboth single canals. The Sinus is itself a single bay, and so large that\r\nfor many degrees its shores on both sides converge smoothly to their\r\nsharp apex. Because of this probably, the coast in the immediate\r\nneighborhood is without canal connection, no canal being known along\r\neither side till one reaches the Hydraotes at the Aromaticum\r\nPromontorium, which marks the western limit of the gulf. The\r\nconsequence is that when the Djihoun doubles, the duplicate canal, not\r\nhaving any terminus ready to its hand, has to make one for itself by\r\nsimply running into the Margaritifer Sinus, some distance up its\r\neastern side. It thus advertises its adjunctival character, and at the\r\nsame time the general fact that a neighbor’s terminus, though used from\r\npreference, when convenient, is not an essential in the process.\r\nGemination occurs of its own initiative, but is conditioned by\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nWhether one canal shows thus to the exclusion of the other, or whether\r\nboth stand so confused as not to be told apart, the fact remains that\r\nthe double is not always recognizable as such. If we turn to the list\r\nof the doubles on page 222, we shall note that the same canals were not\r\nalways seen in the dual condition at successive oppositions. Some,\r\nindeed, are so emphatically of the habit as to appear year after year\r\nin a paired state, but others are not so constant to their\r\npossibilities. Now, when it is remembered that at different oppositions\r\nwe view Mars at diverse seasons of its tropical year, we see that this\r\nmeans that the phenomenon is seasonal; and furthermore that its\r\nexhibition depends upon the canal’s position. Gemination, like the\r\nshowing or non-showing of the single canal, is conditioned by the place\r\nof the canal upon the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nTurning from such generic characteristics to more specific traits, the\r\nfirst thing to strike an attentive observer is that the doubles differ\r\nin width; that they are not mensurably alike in the property they hold\r\nin common of being paired. In some the twin lines are obviously farther\r\napart than in others, and the relation persists however repeated the\r\nobservations. Of two doubles the one will always surpass its fellow.\r\nThis contrasted individuality first struck me in the Phison and the\r\nEuphrates; and from the first moment at which these doubles showed as\r\nsuch. The Phison pair seemed perceptibly the narrower of the two. A\r\nlike distinction was evident at the next opposition and the next; in\r\nfact, at every succeeding one to the present day. Nor was the\r\nrecognition of the fact confined to me. If we turn to Schiaparelli’s\r\nMemoriae we shall find that that master had registered the same\r\nidiomatic width for the two canals from first to last throughout his\r\nlong series of records. The observation thus made proved to apply to\r\neach and all of these curious twins.\r\n\r\nDiversity in width for different doubles appears plainly in drawings\r\nwhere more than one double is depicted. As an example, two drawings are\r\nhere given in the text, made, the one on July 13, 1905, λ15°, and the\r\nother on July 20, λ313°. In them the Phison, Euphrates, Djihoun, and\r\nThoth appear contrasted as unmistakably as either of them does with the\r\nsingle canals apparent at the same time. That this drawing is typical\r\nis borne out by all the best measures of the several doubles as seen at\r\nsuccessive oppositions, and marshaled in the subjoined list. How truly\r\nindividual the quality is stands proved by the relative values in\r\ndifferent years which are even more accordant than the absolute ones.\r\n\r\nThe canals were:—\r\n\r\n  =======================+=====================\r\n                         |        WIDTH\r\n                         +------+-------+------\r\n                         | 1903 |  1905 | MEAN\r\n  -----------------------+------+-------+------\r\n   1.

The widths\r\ngiven are those when the canal was at or sufficiently near its full\r\nstrength, and are measured from the centres of the constituents. We\r\nnotice two points: the agreement of the same canal with itself and its\r\nsystematic disagreement with others. But what is especially to the\r\npoint, if we compare the values found at successive oppositions, we\r\nfind that for different canals the values agree in their difference.\r\nThis shows that each of these values is, in most cases if not in all, a\r\nnorm for that particular canal; a value distinctive of it and to which\r\nit either absolutely or relatively conforms. In other words, the width\r\nof the gemination is a personal peculiarity of the particular canal, as\r\nmuch an idiosyncrasy of it as its position on the planet.\r\n\r\nTwo general classes may be distinguished; those up to about five\r\ndegrees in width apart and those above this figure. Whether such very\r\nwidely separated lines as go to make up the second class, such as the\r\nNilokeras I and II, constitutes a double is a debatable point.\r\nSchiaparelli thought they did, and so classed them. To me it did not at\r\nfirst occur so to consider them, and in some instances, such as the\r\nHelicon I and II, later observations seem to justify the omission. With\r\nthe Nilokeras I and II the outcome seems the other way. The reasons for\r\ndistrust of a physical relation between the constituents is not so much\r\nthe distance separating them, nor any lack of parallelism, as the\r\nself-sufficient manner in which they show alone. Even this, however,\r\ntends to be recognized in the narrower pairs as they come to be better\r\nseen. It may be that width alone is wholly competent to selective\r\nshowing. For the farther apart two lines are on the planet, the more\r\nopportunity is afforded the air waves to disclose the one without the\r\nother, a relative revelation which is constantly happening to detail in\r\ndifferent parts of the disk. As long as any doubt exists of a physical\r\ncommunity of interest, it seems best to distinguish such possibly\r\nmerely parallel canals by suffixed numerals.\r\n\r\nOf this class of doubles is the Nilokeras I and II. So wide is it that\r\nMr. Lampland succeeded in photographing it as such, the two\r\nconstituents showing well separated, and if it prove a true double it\r\nwill be the first Martian double to leave its impress on a sensitive\r\nplate. Although separated by four hundred miles of territory, the two\r\nlines are parallel so far as observation can detect, which, of course,\r\nis not so very easy with the lines so far apart. In the country between\r\none crosswise canal certainly lies, the Phryxus, and much shading thus\r\nfar unaccounted for. Recent discoveries, however, point to the cause of\r\nsuch shading as lines imperfectly seen. For in some cases the lines\r\nhave actually disclosed themselves, and warrant us in believing that it\r\nis only imperfect seeing that keeps the others hid. Of the pair the\r\nNilokeras I is itself double, curiously reproducing what sometimes is\r\nseen in the case of double stars, one of whose components turns out to\r\nbe itself a binary. The second line of the Nilokeras I lies close to\r\nits primary on the north, and was on the only occasion of its detection\r\nthe merest of gossamers, while the Nilokeras I itself stood out strong\r\nand dark. Thus do these Martian details increase and multiply in\r\nintricacy the better the seeing brings them out.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the other doubles, the doubles proper so to speak, there\r\nis every indication of a physical bond between the pair. What that bond\r\nmay be is another matter and seems to be of different divulging,\r\naccording to the particular instance. At one end of the subject, both\r\nas the widest of these doubles and one of the most important, stands\r\nthe Ganges. The components of the canal are 5°.1 apart. This great\r\nwidth, joined to the fact of scant extension, gives the canal a stocky\r\naspect, its breadth being but one sixth of its length. Its width draws\r\nattention to it while the phenomena it exhibits intrigue curiosity.\r\n\r\nAs early as the first opposition of my observations in 1894, the canal,\r\nas it underwent the process of doubling, showed phases of peculiarity.\r\nIt was first caught by me as a double over toward the terminator, or\r\nfading edge of the disk; then as it was brought nearer the centre by\r\nthe gaining upon the longitudes, showed as a broad swath of shading of\r\na width apparently equal to any it later exhibited. In this appearance\r\nit continued for some months, and then in October began to show a\r\nclarification toward the centre. Once started, the lightening of its\r\nmidway advanced till at last, on November 13, it stood out an\r\nunmistakable double, the two lines standing where the edges of the\r\nswath had previously been. Had the observations here been all that one\r\ncould wish, the method of gemination would have been certain and of\r\ngreat interest. Unfortunately, the observations left much to be\r\ndesired, and those repeated in 1896-1897 and 1901 were of like\r\ndoubtfulness. A period of swarthy confusion preceded the plainly dual\r\nstate, but whether the double simply clarified or widened as well it\r\nwas not possible to assure one’s self. That the canal exhibited plainly\r\nthe effects of seasonal development was as unmistakable as the steps\r\nthemselves were open to ambiguity. In 1903 the canal was at its minimum\r\nand hardly to be made out. It seemed then to show an actual change in\r\nwidth coincident with alteration of visibility. But this, too, could\r\nnot be predicated with certainty. It was also surmisable that the\r\nwesternmost line was the one from which the development proceeded.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 much more was made out about it, training in the subject and\r\nincreased proximity of the planet contributing to the result. It now\r\nbecame clear to me that the canal did develop from the western side;\r\nfor the western edge made a dark line of definite boundary from which\r\nshading proceeded to the eastern side, where it faded almost\r\nimperceptibly off with no defined line to mark its limit. That this\r\nshading gradually darkened was evident, but that when it could be seen\r\nat all it extended to the extreme limit of the eventual double,\r\nrestricted the character if not the fact of an actual widening. At this\r\nopposition, too, the canal passed through its period of minimum\r\nvisibility and was then seen, whenever it could be caught, as a\r\nconfused swath of full width. In the case of this canal, then, a\r\nwidening in the sense of a bodily separation of two lines seems\r\ninadmissible. On the other hand, the gradual darkening of the swath,\r\nand especially the advance of the darkening from the western side,\r\npoints to an interesting process there taking place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peculiar development of the Ganges.]\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the series stands the Djihoun. As the Ganges is\r\nthe widest of the instantly impressive doubles, so the Djihoun is the\r\nnarrowest the eye has so far been able to make out. Only two fifths of\r\nthe width of the Ganges pair, this slender double is very nearly at the\r\nlimit of resolvability. So well proportioned are its lines to the space\r\nbetween them, however, that in ease of recognition it surpasses many\r\nwider pairs. In form, too, it is distinctive, turning by a graceful\r\ncurve the trend of the Margaritifer Sinus into the Lucus Ismenius. With\r\nits fundamental branch—the northern of the two—it joins what is\r\nevidently the main line of the Protonilus—also the northern one—to\r\nthe Margaritifer Sinus’s tip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Djihoun, the narrowest double.]\r\n\r\nIt differs from the Ganges in some other important particulars besides\r\nwidth. In its case no band of shading distinguishes it at any time. It\r\nhas always been two lines whenever it has been seen other than as a\r\nsingle penciling; the only confusion about it being evidently our own\r\natmosphere’s affair. These two lines, furthermore, have showed, within\r\nthe errors of observation, always the same distance apart. So that not\r\nonly no change of intercommunication between the lines but no change in\r\ntheir places apparently occurs.\r\n\r\nBetween these extremes in width, two hundred miles more or less for the\r\nGanges and seventy-five miles for the Djihoun, the distance parting the\r\npairs of most of the double canals lies. From 3° to 3°.2 on the planet\r\nmay be taken as that of the average; the degrees denoting latitudinal\r\nones on the surface of Mars, the length of which is equal to\r\nthirty-seven of our English statute miles.\r\n\r\nMost of the canals conform apparently to the type of the Djihoun rather\r\nthan to that of the Ganges. Careful consideration of them fails to find\r\nany increase or decrease of distance, between the pairs of the same\r\ncanal at different times, which cannot be referred to errors inevitable\r\nto observation of such minute detail. In short, the double is made by\r\nthe addition of a second line in a particular position and not by a\r\ngrowth out to it of a line coincident to begin with with the first.\r\n\r\nI have said that the average width between the two lines of the doubles\r\nwas about 3°. It must not be supposed that this average width denotes\r\nanything more than an average; or, in other words, that it denotes\r\nanything in the nature of a norm. The remark is important in view of a\r\nsuggestion which I have heard made that we have here a system based on\r\nfundamental Martian units, in which, or in multiples of which, the\r\ndimensions of the canals are implicitly expressed. Such, however, does\r\nnot seem to be the case. In some instances, indeed, we have certain\r\nevidence to the contrary and that the width of the double is\r\nconditioned solely by antecedent place. The Phison and Euphrates offer\r\na case in point. These two important arteries in duplicate leave, as we\r\nsaw, from two carets in the Mare Icarium, the Portus Sigaei, held in\r\ncommon tenancy by both. Each pair then proceeds down the disk inclined\r\nat its own particular angle to the meridian in order to reach by a\r\ngreat circle course a certain spot; the Pseboas Lucus in one case, the\r\nLuci Ismenii in the other. As one of these angles is thirty-five\r\ndegrees while the other is only three, they must, from the\r\ncircumstances of their setting out, have not only different widths, but\r\nwidths determinately different in advance, since each is, roughly\r\nspeaking, foreshortened by the degree of divergence from the meridian.\r\nThe one, therefore, must be about four degrees to the other’s something\r\nless than three and a half. This is what they actually are as\r\ndetermined by measurement from observation. That the calculated value\r\nagrees with that found from observation helps certify to a community of\r\nstarting-points, but it completely does away with comprehensive design\r\nin the question of their widths. For if the one were so settled, the\r\nother could not be.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the next example seems to deny it to both. This example occurs,\r\ntoo, not far away from the scene of the first, in the twin bays of the\r\nSabaeus Sinus, from which depart, _mutatis mutandis_, the double\r\nHiddekel and the two Gihon. These twin gulfs bear so little imprint of\r\nbeing other than natural formations, that they have been universally\r\nand very likely quite rightly taken for such ever since Dawes\r\ndiscovered them in 1859, long before things like canals were dreamed\r\nof. It is strange that when the Hiddekel and the Gihon were found by me\r\nto be double in 1897, with a branch of both leading from each bay, the\r\nconnection between the sceptically scouted doubles and the thoroughly\r\nbelieved-in bays should have been apparent. For to link a ghost to\r\nmateriality, if it does not discredit the materiality, serves to\r\nsubstantialize the ghost. Furthermore, it shows that in this case\r\nneither the one double nor the other can have had its width engineered\r\non any preconceived scale, unless the twin bays be themselves so\r\naccounted for. So that it seems useless to seek for cryptic standards\r\nin the canals or to think to find them a measure of value from the fact\r\nof their being a medium of exchange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sabaeus Sinus, embouchure for the double Hiddekel\r\nand Gihon.]\r\n\r\nA third instance of the same thing in the case of the Ganges and the\r\nJamuna was proved at the last opposition after having long been\r\nsuspected without my being able to make sure of it. These instances,\r\ntaken in connection with the wide range of values in the widths\r\npresented by different canals, serve to show that the distance between\r\nthe twin lines is an individual characteristic of the particular canal,\r\nand further to point to its cause, in some cases certainly and possibly\r\nin all, as topographical. The duplicate line makes a convenience of a\r\nneighbor, and suits its distance from its fellow to friendly\r\nfeasibility. To cut a ‘canal’ to conform to the country seems logical\r\nif not obligatory, and quite in keeping with the nomenclature of the\r\nsubject; but here the starting-point appears to be the only thing\r\nconsidered—the canal once safely launched being left to shift, or\r\nrather not shift, for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nTopography thus introduced to our notice for its effect on the breadth\r\nof the doubles proves upon inspection to be of extended application to\r\nthe whole subject. Examined for position these canals turn out to have\r\nsomething to say for themselves bearing on the question of their origin\r\nand office.\r\n\r\nWith regard to position, probably the first query to suggest itself to\r\nan investigator to ask is of the direction in which they run. Is there\r\na preponderance manifest in them for one direction over another? Do\r\nthey show an inclination to the vertical, to the horizontal, or to some\r\ntilt between? To answer this we may box the compass, and taking the\r\nfour cardinal points with the twelve next most important points between\r\nfor sectional division segregate the doubles according to their\r\nindividual trend. As we have no means of determining in which sense any\r\ndirection is to be taken,—if indeed it is not to be taken alternately\r\nin each,—we get eight compartments into one or the other of which all\r\nthe doubles must fall.

That\r\nthis seems to mean something the nearly equal pairing of quadrantal\r\npoints goes to show. Thus:—\r\n\r\n  N. & S. and E. & W. inclined canals number                 7 +  6 = 13\r\n\r\n  N.

A trend to the westward would\r\nbe given a particle descending from the north to the equator by the\r\nplanet’s rotation, thus turning it southwesterly; and one to the west\r\nto a particle travelling equatorwards from the south, turning it\r\nnorthwesterly. As the doubles lie in the northern hemisphere, either in\r\nwhole or part, to the extent of 93%, this might account for the\r\npreponderating tilt to the east of north and west of south exhibited by\r\nthem. It would correspond with the lines of flow.\r\n\r\nTo see whether this be so we will take only those double canals that\r\nlie exclusively in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively,\r\nand note those in the former that trend to the west of south as against\r\nthose that run to the east of it, and _vice versa_ in the southern. In\r\nthe northern the proportion of the westerly to the easterly ones is 17\r\nto 4; in the southern, 1 to 0 the other way.\r\n\r\nOf those whose course is common to both hemispheres we find for the\r\nratio of the southwesterly to the southeasterly 8 to 7. But the\r\nproportion of the course of these canals in the two hemispheres is on\r\nthe side of this same ratio.\r\n\r\nFrom their direction we now pass to consideration of their distribution\r\nin longitude. It appears that some meridians are more favored than\r\nothers. The hemisphere which has the Syrtis Major for centre is more\r\nprolific in them than its antipodes. From longitude 80° to 200° there\r\nare ten doubles, from 200° to 320° twenty-four, and from 320° to 80°\r\nseventeen; or, roughly, in the proportion of 2, 5, and 3. That this\r\ndistribution means anything by itself is doubtful; it is much more\r\nlikely to be a general topographical consequence of their distribution\r\nin another direction, which proves to be highly significant and which\r\nwe shall now expose—that of latitude.\r\n\r\nIf we separate the surface into zones, each ten degrees wide, and count\r\nthe doubles found traversing in whole or part the several zones, we\r\nfind the following arrangement:—\r\n\r\nColumn Headings:\r\n  A = At Opposition of 1903 Alone\r\n  B = At All Oppositions so far observed at Flagstaff\r\n\r\n ===========================================================+=====+=====\r\n                 Double Canals of Mars                      |     |\r\n            arranged according to Latitude                  |  A  |  B\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------+-----+-----\r\n                                                            |     |\r\n Between 30° S. and 20° S.

Such a distribution is\r\nnot in proportion to the areas of the zones, which though diminishing\r\ntoward the poles do so at no such rate. The surface included between\r\nthe equator and 40° of latitude is 65% of the hemisphere, whereas the\r\nfraction of the number of doubles found there is 93%. The doubles are,\r\nthen, an equatorial feature of the planet, confined to the tropic and\r\ntemperate belts.\r\n\r\nTo perceive the tropical character of the doubles in another way we\r\nhave but to consider the zonal distribution of the single canals.\r\nUnlike the former the latter do not thin out as one advances toward the\r\npoles; since in the arctic regions single canals bemesh the surface as\r\nmeticulously as elsewhere. It is only that they there replace the\r\ndoubles; or, not to put the cart before the horse, it is the doubles\r\nthat in part replace the singles in the tropics. And that this\r\narrangement has something physical behind it by way of cause is\r\ncuriously shown by two canals, the Arnon and the Kison, which are\r\nneither of the one kind nor yet the other, but a cross between the two.\r\nFor the Arnon and the Kison are convergent doubles; the two lines of\r\nthe Kison leaving a common point at the edge of the polar cap and\r\nseparating as they travel south, while the two Arnon take up and\r\ncontinue the divergence, connecting at last with the parallel pair of\r\nthe Euphrates. These canals thus make transition between the true\r\ndoubles and the true singles, and may be looked upon as endowed with\r\nthe potentialities of both. From their association with the double\r\nEuphrates, it is clear that the transition between the two forms is not\r\nonly formal but physical, and that the stopping of the dual condition\r\nat the fortieth parallel is not the outcome of chance.\r\n\r\nIt may occur to the thoughtful that the doubles appear confined to the\r\nmore tropical portions of the planet because of a better presentation\r\nof those zones, the reader supposing the planet to be seen axised\r\nperpendicularly to the plane of sight, as geographies represent the\r\nearth’s globe. The supposition, however, is erroneous. We sometimes see\r\nthe planet so, but more often not. Such is the tilt of the Martian axis\r\nto the plane of the Martian ecliptic that the different zones are\r\nrarely seen on an even keel, so to speak, their aspects shifting\r\ntotally from one opposition to another. What shows in mid-disk on one\r\noccasion may be forty-eight degrees removed from it at another, a\r\ndistance amounting to three-quarters of the way from apparent equator\r\nto apparent pole.\r\n\r\nThus the double canals are for some intrinsic reason equatorial\r\nfeatures of the planet as opposed to polar ones. And this not simply\r\nbecause of greater space there. Duality is a result of conditions\r\nintrinsic to the several localities. What the cause may be is related\r\nto the character of the things themselves, which we shall later\r\nconsider. For the moment we may note that the fact disposes quietly of\r\nthe diplopic theory of their manufacture. For, for diplopic doubles to\r\nshow such respect for the equator would betoken a courtesy in them to\r\nbe commended of Sydney Smith.\r\n\r\nBut this is not their only geographic bias. In addition to not being\r\npartial to the poles, the double canals show a certain exclusiveness\r\ntoward the dark areas generally. Not only do they avoid the arctic and\r\nantarctic zones entirely, but they largely shun the blue-green regions.\r\nIn these but two suspicions of doubles occur, in the Aonium Sinus,\r\nalthough single canals there are as numerous as anywhere else on the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although they avoid running through them, they run from\r\nthem in a manner that is marked. Proceeding from the great diaphragm\r\nare no less than 28 out of the 53 doubles. Connecting directly with\r\nthese are 17 more; while the remaining 8 are also associated through\r\nthe intermediarism of dark areas, the Solis Lacus and the Trivium.\r\n\r\nIn like relation to dark regions, they are limited on the north by the\r\nMare Acidalium, the Propontis, the Wedge of Casius and their\r\ninterconnecting bands, the Pierius, Callirrhoe, Helicon. In this manner\r\ndo they form a broad girdle round the planet’s waist, leaving the polar\r\nextremities bare.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Very wide and possibly not of the same class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                       CANALS IN THE DARK REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeen years after the recognition of the canals in the light\r\nregions occurred another important event, the discovery of a similar\r\nset in the dark ones. The detection of these markings in the dark areas\r\nwas a more difficult feat than the perceiving of those in the light,\r\nand in consequence was later accomplished. Also was it one where\r\nrecognition came by degrees.\r\n\r\nI have previously pointed out what this discovery did for the\r\nseas—nothing less than the taking away of their character in a\r\ngenerally convincing manner. To one who had carefully considered the\r\nmatter, the seas had indeed already lost it, as was shown in Chapter X,\r\nbut to those who had not these canals presented a very instant proof of\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nFrom such not wholly supererogatory service they went on to furnish\r\nunlooked-for help in other directions. Their discovery showed in the\r\nfirst place that no part of the planet’s surface was free from canal\r\ntriangulation.\r\n\r\nBut it did more than this. For these canals in the dark regions left\r\nthe edge of the ‘continents’ at the very points where the canals of the\r\nlight regions entered them, which fact proved for them a community of\r\ninterest with the latter. Such continuation was highly significant,\r\nsince it linked the two together into a single system, compassing the\r\nwhole surface of the planet. Starting from the places where the\r\nlight-region canals come out upon the great girdle of seas that\r\nstretches all round the planet, most of the new canals headed toward\r\nthe passes between the islands south, as nearly polewards as\r\ncircumstances of local topography would permit. In the broader expanses\r\nof the Syrtis Major and the Mare Erythraeum, besides main arteries\r\nothers went to spots in their midst after the same fashion as those of\r\nthe light regions. These spots differed in no way apparently from their\r\nfellow oases elsewhere. From a spot in the centre of the Syrtis three\r\ngreat lines thus traveled south: the Dosaron, heading straight up the\r\nSyrtis on the meridian till it struck the northernmost point of Hellas;\r\nthe Orosines, inclined more to the right, passing through the dark\r\nchannel to the west of that land and so proceeding south; and lastly\r\nthe Erymanthus turning eastward till it brought up finally at the\r\nHesperidum Lucus. Where, on the other hand, the long chain of lighter\r\nland, called by Schiaparelli islands, and stretching from the Solis\r\nLacus region westward to Hellas, offered only here and there an exit,\r\nthe canals made for these exits. The canals in the Mare Sirenum, the\r\nMare Cimmerium, and the Mare Tyrrhenum struck more or less diagonally\r\nacross those seas from their northern termini to the entrances of the\r\nstraits between the islands, thus lacing the seas in the way a sail is\r\nrolled to its spar. From the exact manner in which they connected with\r\nthe light-region canals they proved the two to be part and parcel of\r\none system, which in its extension was planet-wide and therefore\r\nproportionately important. Whatever of strange interest the curious\r\ncharacteristics of the canals themselves suggested was now greatly\r\nincreased by this addition; for the solidarity of the phenomenon\r\naffected the cogency of any argument derived from it.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 only the dark areas of the southern hemisphere were found to be\r\nthus laced with lines. For then so great was the tilt of the planet’s\r\nsouth pole toward the earth, that while those zones were well displayed\r\nthe dark patches of the northern hemisphere were more or less hull-down\r\nover the disk’s northern horizon.\r\n\r\nContrast was the open sesame to their detection. When the _maria_ show\r\ndark, the lines are lost in the sombreness of the background. As the\r\nmaria lighten the lines come out. Such was amply witnessed by the\r\neffect in 1894 and 1896. In 1894 I found it impossible to perceive\r\nthem, except where the Padargus crossed Atlantis, for the hue of the\r\n_maria_ themselves was then very dark. In 1896, on the other hand, I\r\nsaw them without difficulty. What is also of interest: so soon as seen\r\nthey appeared small, without haziness or distention.\r\n\r\nAs the oppositions succeeded one another the northern regions rose into\r\nview, and with their appearance came the detection in them of the same\r\nphenomena. No large dark areas like the diaphragm exist there, but the\r\nsmaller patches of blue-green which bestrew them proved to be similarly\r\nmeshed. At first canals were evident upon their peripheries, contouring\r\nthem about; then the bodies themselves of the patches showed\r\ngrid-ironed by lines.\r\n\r\nThe Mare Acidalium with its adjuncts, the Lucus Niliacus on the south\r\nand the Lacus Hyperboreus on the north, thus stood out in 1901. On a\r\nparticularly good evening of definition at the end of May, the Mare\r\nsuddenly made background for a sunburst of dark rays, six of them in\r\nall radiating from a point between it and the Lacus Hyperboreus.\r\nConsidering how sombre the Mare was at the time, this was as remarkable\r\na vision as it was striking to see. Although at the moment the sight\r\nwas of the nature of a revelation, these lines have been amply verified\r\nsince, as the Martian season has proved more propitious.\r\n\r\nSimilar decipherment has befallen all the other patches of blue-green\r\nin the northern hemisphere; these having shown themselves first\r\ncircumscribed and then traversed by canals. Interesting instances were\r\nthe Wedge of Casius and the Propontis. These markings, first perceived\r\nyears ago as mere patches of shading, then partially resolved by\r\nSchiaparelli, now stood revealed as a perfect network of lines and\r\nspots. So many of both kinds of their detail occupied the ground that\r\nto identify them all was matter of exceeding difficulty. The outcome is\r\nshown in the diagrammatic representations opposite and on page 256.\r\nThese drawings disclose better than any description the mass of detail\r\nof which the patches are in reality composed, and serve to convey an\r\nidea of the complexity involved. If the general canal system seems\r\nintricate, here is something which exceeds that as much again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Propontis, 1905.]\r\n\r\nThe extension in this manner of the curious triangulation of the light\r\nareas into and through all the dark areas as well, by thus spreading\r\nthe field of its operations over both terranes complexioned so unlike,\r\ngreatly increases the cogency of the deduction that this detail is of\r\nlater origin than the background upon which it rests. That the mesh of\r\nlines covers not only the ochre stretches of the disk, but the\r\nblue-green parts as well, makes it still more certain that it is not a\r\nsimple physical outcome of the fundamental forces that featured the\r\nplanet’s face. For in that case it could not with such absolute\r\nimpartiality involve both alike. Thus here, again, we find\r\ncorroboration by later observations of what earlier ones established.\r\n\r\nA last link in the chain of canal sequences remains to be recorded.\r\nJust as the lines in the dark regions continued those in the light, so\r\nthey themselves turned out to be similarly prolonged and in no less\r\nsuggestive a manner. For when the north polar zone came to be\r\ndisplayed, canals were evident there, continuing those in the other\r\nzones and running at their northern ends into dark spots at the edge of\r\nthe polar cap. Here, then, we have the end of the whole system, or more\r\nproperly its origin, in the polar snows. The significance of this will\r\nbe seen from other phenomena, to a consideration of which we now\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                                 OASES\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to be caught of the details of this most curious network that\r\nmeshes the surface of Mars was a set of phenomena stranger even than\r\nthe lines; to wit, dark round dots standing at their intersections.\r\nMore difficult to make out than the lines, they were in consequence\r\ndetected thus later by fifteen years. Once discovered, however, it\r\nbecame possible to trace their unconscious recognition back in time.\r\nThus Schiaparelli told the writer in 1895, apropos of those found at\r\nFlagstaff, that he had himself suspected them but could not make sure.\r\nSome of them stand figured in his _Memoria Sesta_ dealing with the\r\nopposition of 1888, but not published till 1899. In such posthumous\r\nrecognition, as one may call it, the spots repeated the history of the\r\ncanals. For Schiaparelli had himself pointed out a similar preconscious\r\nvisioning of the canals in the delicate pencilings of Dawes and the\r\nstreaks of Lockyer, Kaiser, and Secchi, now translatable as\r\nrepresenting the Phison, the Euphrates, and half a dozen other canals\r\nimperfectly seen. That both the canals and the oases were thus sketched\r\nbefore they were seen well enough to be definitely discovered is to an\r\nunprejudiced mind among their strongest credentials to credit.\r\n\r\nNor was Schiaparelli the sole person thus to get proof before letter.\r\nOne of their very earliest portrayals appears in a drawing by Otto\r\nBoeddicker, made on December 26, 1881, where the Pseboas Lucus is\r\nclearly represented. In a still more imperfect manner some of the spots\r\nhad been adumbrated and their shadows drawn long before that. Thus they\r\nmay be deciphered as the cause of patches drawn by Dawes in 1864,\r\nthough none of them were in any definite sense detected till 1879, and\r\nonly then so ill defined that their true character was not apparent. As\r\npatches they are still commonly seen at observatories where the\r\nobservational conditions are not of the best and the study of the\r\nplanet not systematically enough pursued to have them disclose their\r\ntrue shape and size.\r\n\r\nThe history of their detection is resumed in the experience of the\r\nindividual observer. During the course of my own observations I have\r\nhad occasion to notice the several stages in recognition of the spots\r\nwhich have marked their chronologic career. As with the lines, three\r\nstages in the appearance of the spots may be remarked: first, where the\r\nscattering of the rays is so wide that dilution prevents anything from\r\nbeing seen; second, where the commotion being less the object appears\r\nas a gray patch; and third, where in comparative quiet it condenses\r\ninto a black dot. For the two former our own air waves are to blame. In\r\ncoursing waves of condensation and rarefaction they spread the image of\r\nthe spot as they do that of the canal. Then as the currents calm the\r\nspot shrinks to its normal proportions, and in so doing darkens in\r\nconsequence of being less widely diffused. Thus the evolution in\r\nperception which may take place in the course of an hour for a\r\nparticular observer represents exactly what has occurred in the person\r\nof the race by the improvement in observational methods and sites.\r\n\r\nThat the spots, although wider than the canals, remained longer hidden\r\nfrom human sight, is due to the optico-physic fact that a tenuous line\r\nmay be perceived _owing to its length_ when a dot of the same diameter\r\nwould be invisible. Summation of impressions is undoubtedly the cause\r\nof this. The mere fact that a row of retinal cones is struck, although\r\neach be but feebly affected, is sufficient to raise the sum total into\r\nthe sphere of consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage of their visibility, the spots are in danger of\r\nmistake with the smaller true patches of sombre hue which fleck the\r\nnorthern hemisphere of the planet and from which they differ totally in\r\nkind, totally so far as our present perception goes. Such true patches\r\nconsist of a groundwork of shading, upon which, indeed, are superposed\r\nthe usual network of lines and spots. Prominent as instances of them\r\nare the Trivium Charontis, the Wedge of Casius, and the Mare Acidalium.\r\nWith patches of the sort the spots proper must not be confounded.\r\n\r\nClose treading on the heels of the detection of lines athwart the seas\r\ncame the recognition of spots there likewise. At the opposition of\r\n1896-1897 the number was added to; and so the tale has been steadily\r\nincreased. Their number as found at Flagstaff up to the present time,\r\nthat is, to the close of the opposition of 1905, is 186; of which 121\r\nlie in the light regions, 42 in the dark areas of the southern\r\nhemisphere, and 23 in the smaller sombre patches of the northern zones.\r\n\r\nFrom their relationships and behavior it became apparent that the spots\r\nwere not lakes but something which answered much more nearly to oases.\r\n\r\nOf the spots three kinds may be distinguished: the large, the little,\r\nand the less, if by the latter term it may be permitted to denote what\r\nhas but collateral claim to be included and yet demands a certain\r\nrecognition. For though not spots like the others, the members of the\r\nthird class have certain traits in common with them while differing\r\nradically in others.\r\n\r\nTo the kind called large belong the greater number of spots so far\r\nfound upon the disk. They are large only by comparison with the little.\r\nFor they measure according to my latest determinations but seventy-five\r\nor one hundred miles in diameter; on the planet some two degrees\r\nacross. Sizable black pin-heads, it is their tone that chiefly catches\r\nthe eye, for they are commonly the darkest markings on the disk.\r\nAgainst the ochre stretches they appear black, and even in the midst of\r\nthe dark areas they stand out almost as much contrasted with their\r\nsurroundings as these do with the light regions themselves. About a\r\nhundred and forty are now known. Those in the light areas were\r\ndiscovered first; those in the dark regions being harder to see.\r\n\r\nOf this first kind are such spots as the Pseboas Lucus, the Aquae\r\nCalidae, the Lacus Phoenicis, and the Novem Viae; or, in English, the\r\nGrove of Pseboas, the Hot Springs, the Phœnix Lake, and the Nine Ways,\r\nto mention no more. That they bear dissimilar names implies no\r\ndissimilarity in structure. The phenomena are all remarkably alike, and\r\nclearly betoken one and the same class of objects; differing between\r\nthemselves at most in size and importance.\r\n\r\nIn form they all seem to be round. They certainly appear so, and were\r\nit not that retinal images of small areas tend to assume this shape\r\nmight implicitly be credited with being what they seem. The reason for\r\noptical circularity probably resides in the shape of the retinal cones\r\nand in their patterning into a mosaic floor. So that unless a\r\nsufficient number of cones be struck the image takes on to\r\nconsciousness a roughly circular figure—whether it be so in fact or\r\nnot. In the present case, however, they seem to be too well seen for\r\nself-deception of the sort.\r\n\r\nThe little are distinguished from the large by being pin-points instead\r\nof pin-heads. They are most minute; from fifteen to twenty-five miles\r\nin diameter only. That anything except size distinguishes the two apart\r\nis from their look improbable. In color or rather tone,—for\r\ndistinctive color is of such minute objects unpredicable,—they would\r\nseem to be alike. Such is also the case with their distribution and\r\ndetail association.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fons Immortalis, June 19.]\r\n\r\nTo the second class belong the Fons Juventae,—Schiaparelli’s Fountain\r\nof Youth,—the Fons Immortalis in Elysium in 1905, and the Gygaea\r\nPalus, besides many more. These are all pin-points, just upon the limit\r\nof vision, and noteworthy chiefly for being visible at all. All those\r\ndetected so far lie not very distant from the equator, which may or may\r\nnot be a matter of accident. It is not one of perception, since this\r\npart of the planet was not the best place for observation at the time\r\nthey were discovered. To make out one of these little dots is a\r\npeculiarly pleasing bit of observation, as it requires particularly\r\ngood definition. One might almost take them for fly-specks upon the\r\nimage did they not move with the disk. They have no perceptible size\r\nand yet are clearly larger in diameter than the canals which run into\r\nthem; which proves how very slender the latter must be.\r\n\r\nVery early in the detection of the spots it became evident that they\r\nwere not scattered haphazard over the surface, but that on the contrary\r\nthey were never found except at the meeting-points of the lines. From\r\nthis it must not be supposed, as has been done, that the spots are\r\nmerely optical reinforcements of the lines at their crossings due to\r\nthe more crowded character there of the lines themselves. That they are\r\nnot such is demonstrated by the existence of crossings where, either\r\ntemporarily or permanently, none appear; which shows that they are far\r\ntoo well seen for any such illusion about them to be possible. At these\r\ncrossings the lines traverse one another without thickening, whether\r\nthey be single or double lines. The spots, on the other hand, are much\r\nwider than the lines, giving a beaded look to the threads. In short,\r\nthey are the knots to the canal network. All the more important\r\njunctions are characterized by their presence. Such starred junctions\r\nare not confined to the ochre regions; they dot the light and the dark\r\nareas with equal impartiality, thus showing themselves to be\r\nindependent of the nature of the ground where large stretches of\r\ncountry are concerned. On the other hand, they appear to be unusually\r\nnumerous in the smaller, isolated, dark areas of the northern\r\nhemisphere, such as the Trivium, the Mare Acidalium, the Propontis, and\r\nthe Wedge of Casius. Here they crowd; and one cannot avoid the\r\ninference that their plentifulness in these regions is not due to\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Utopia regio—1903._]\r\n\r\nTo the large spots, those of the first class, fall the places of\r\nintersection of the largest and most numerous canals, while the little\r\nspots make termini to fainter lines, ones that bear to them a like\r\nratio of unimportance. Spots and lines are thus connected not simply in\r\nposition but in size. The one is clearly dependent on the other, the\r\nimportance of the centre being gauged by the magnitude of its\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact of association we now pass to the manner of it, which is\r\nquite as remarkable. The position of the spot relative to its tributary\r\ncanals depends upon the character of the connecting lines. If the canal\r\nbe single it runs, so far as may be judged, straight into the middle of\r\nthe oasis, or, in other words, the oasis is symmetrically disposed\r\nabout its end. This is true of the greater number of the large spots\r\nand of all the little ones, since the latter have as connections only\r\nsingle canals.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a double canal arriving at a spot, a different and most\r\ncurious dependence is observable. This fact I first noticed in a\r\ngeneral way at the opposition of 1896-1897, the initial appearance of\r\nit being presented on September 30, 1896, by the Coloe Palus and the\r\nPhison. It was again visible in the case of the spots in the Trivium at\r\nthe time the canals leading to that place doubled in March, 1897. But\r\nthe exact nature of the phenomenon was not fully appreciated till 1903,\r\nwhen the thing was seen so well as to appear cut on copper plate. It\r\nwas this: the spot is exactly embraced between the two arms of the\r\ndouble canal. It is, moreover, seemingly perfectly round and just fits\r\nin between the parallel lines. The Ascraeus Lucus was the first spot\r\nthat showed thus in association with the double Gigas. Others followed\r\nsuit in so showing, several specimens presenting themselves so well as\r\nto leave no doubt of the precise connection. The sight presented by\r\nsuch a spot and its incasing double is a beautiful bit of detail,\r\nperhaps the most beautiful so far to be seen upon the Martian disk. The\r\ndistinctness with which it stands out on occasion suggests a steel\r\nengraving, and shows how clear-cut the Martian features really are when\r\nour own air ceases from troubling and allows them to be at rest.\r\nIncidentally, we may note that this phenomenon alone serves to disprove\r\nthe diplopic theory of the production of the double canals. For if a\r\ndouble were a single line seen out of focus, any spot upon it should be\r\ndoubled too.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ascraeus Lucus and Gigas.—March. 2. 1903._]\r\n\r\nIt may seem to the reader as if what was seen in 1903 was but an\r\nunimportant advance over the observed phenomena of 1896-1897. Not so,\r\nhowever. For with the earlier instances it was not possible to be sure\r\nof the precise limits of the spot with regard to the double. The Coloe\r\nPalus, on the one hand, did not fill all the space apparently between\r\nthe double Phison; while the Lucus Ismenius more than did so with the\r\ndouble Euphrates. To have set down the different appearances to\r\ninsufficient definition would have been a great mistake, as subsequent\r\nobservation has served to show. The Lucus Ismenius instances this. In\r\n1896-1897 it was seen terminating the Euphrates, blocking all the space\r\nbetween the two lines and extending a little upon either side of them.\r\nNow, from its appearance in 1901 it was evident that the effect had\r\nbeen produced by twin spots lying along the Deuteronilus, the axis\r\njoining them being perpendicular to the Euphrates. In 1903 the relation\r\nwas still better explained by what appeared then, when not only did the\r\ntwo spots stand out, but the Euphrates showed with a line running\r\ncentrally into each.\r\n\r\nAlthough originally seen by Schiaparelli as a single spot and so at\r\nfirst seen by me, better acquaintance with the disk disclosed to both\r\nobservers its really dual character. As this pair has persisted through\r\nall three of the most recent oppositions, it seems fairly certain that\r\nit is always of this character, and more fitting, therefore, to give it\r\nthe plural appellative. This is the single instance of a double oasis.\r\nThere are many that lie close together and might be taken as such; but\r\nthis is the only one where the connection is intrinsic. According to\r\nmeasures of the drawings of 1905 extending through six presentations,\r\nthe distance between the twin oases is 4°.2.\r\n\r\nTheir relation to the canals which run into them is of the most\r\ncomplicated description and of the most suggestive character. For to\r\nthe twin spots converge no less than seven double canals, one\r\nwedge-shaped pair and three single canals, a most goodly number of\r\ncommunication lines. Four of the double canals run into the oases with\r\none line to each; these canals are the Astaboras, the Naarmalcha, the\r\nEuphrates, and the Hiddekel. Three doubles, the Protonilus, the\r\nDjihoun, and the Deuteronilus, embrace the oases between their two\r\nlines, while, in the singles, the canal connects with one or other of\r\nthe twins, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nNow, there is method as to which of the doubles shall straddle, which\r\nembrace, the two Ismenii. Those which leave the place parallel or\r\nnearly so to the direction joining the Luci, inclose them both; those\r\nof which the setting forth is at an angle to this direction depart,\r\neach line of the pair, from the eastern and the western spot\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peculiar association of the Luci Ismenii with double\r\ncanals.]\r\n\r\nConsider, now, the disposition of these seven pairs of lines. All of\r\nthem lie in one semicircle about the Luci, beginning with the\r\nProtonilus on the east and ending with the Deuteronilus on the west.\r\nFurthermore, all follow approximately arcs of great circles, except the\r\nDjihoun, and all send one of their twin lines to one Lucus, one to the\r\nother. The data are enough to make this statement possible. Although\r\nthe west line of the Naarmalcha has not been caught entering its oasis,\r\nthe east one has been seen to enter the other, and the width of the\r\ndouble shows that the west one must enter the corresponding spot. In\r\nthe case of the Astaboras the double has only been observed as far as\r\nthe Vexillum, but the south line has continued on to the west Ismenius,\r\nand here again the width makes it certain that were the canal double\r\nthroughout, the other line must enter the east Ismenius. From the base\r\nline of the Proto-Deuteronilus the inclinations of the seven pairs are\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n                   Protonilus          0° Due East\r\n                   Astaboras          40° North of East\r\n                   Naarmalcha         70° North of East\r\n                   Euphrates          80° North of West\r\n                   Hiddekel           55° North of West\r\n                   Djihoun             0° North of West\r\n                   Deuteronilus        0° Due West\r\n\r\nNow, the width between the two lines of the four canals to the east\r\nincreases regularly from the Protonilus round; the Protonilus being the\r\nnarrowest double, the Astaboras the next, the Naarmalcha the next, and\r\nthe Euphrates the widest. And from the width between the twin oases, it\r\nwould seem that they severally enter the centres of them. What takes\r\nplace in the case of the Hiddekel, which is wider than its tilt would\r\nimply, and in the Djihoun, which is narrower, is not so clear. But that\r\nthey enter the oases in some place is certain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lucus Ismenius. March 1903._]\r\n\r\nThe spots make common termini for all the canals of a given\r\nneighborhood. In other words, canals converge to the places occupied by\r\nthe spots and do not cross haphazard according to the laws of chance.\r\nOnly one instance exists where a spot fails to gather to itself the\r\nwhole sheaf of canals and even there it collects all but two. This\r\nanomaly is the Pseboas Lucus. The peculiarity of this oasis is that it\r\nlies not on, but just off, the Protonilus. That it does so is exceeding\r\ncurious, considering that it is the sole example of such extra-canaline\r\nposition. Strictly speaking, it is not the Protonilus but the point\r\nwhere the Protonilus turns into the Nilosyrtis to which it stands thus\r\nneighboringly aloof. And this may explain the anomaly. For the\r\nNilosyrtis has not the full geometric regularity of the normal canal,\r\nand seems to have been a more or less fundamental feature of the region.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the Lucus has the form and possesses the canal\r\nconnections appropriate to its state. It is apparently round, and lies\r\nbetween the twin lines of the Phison and also between those of the\r\nVexillum.\r\n\r\nNot far from the Pseboas Lucus are to be found all the examples of the\r\nthird class of spots; for so far they have not been observed outside of\r\nAeria, a region peculiarly peopled by double canals. With double canals\r\nthey are necessarily associated, inasmuch as they consist of shading in\r\nthe form of a square or parallelogram, filling the deltas between two\r\npairs that cross. Thus have shown the Coloe Palus at the crossing of\r\nthe double Phison with the double Astaboras, and the Juturna Fons where\r\nthe double Sitacus traverses the double Euphrates.\r\n\r\nAt these same places a fourth kind is sometimes noticeable: a\r\nfour-square set of pin-points or a two-square set of the same at the\r\ncorners of the line-made parallelogram. This kind may well be\r\nsynchronous with the third, though it has only been noticed at\r\nconsecutive presentations. The third, however, has no observed\r\ndependence upon the first or second classes. And this serves to make\r\nmore probable the true objectivity of the circular and the square\r\nfigures respectively shown by each.\r\n\r\nThe spots apparent in the dark regions do not appreciably differ in\r\neither size or shape from the bulk of those visible in the light.\r\nEqually with them they seem to be round, small, and nearly black. They\r\nwould seem, too, in the great diaphragm—or larger contiguous sombre\r\nregion—to be equally plentifully distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n              CARETS ON THE BORDERS OF THE GREAT DIAPHRAGM\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctionally related to the canal system, and yet in look and location\r\ncontrasted with its other details, is a further set of markings,\r\ndetected by me in 1894, and reseen at subsequent oppositions since,\r\nalong the north border of the southern seas. They lie upon what used to\r\nbe thought the continental coastline, the fringing edge of that almost\r\ncontinuous band of shading that belts the Martian globe throughout the\r\nsouthern subtropic zone and called by Schiaparelli the great diaphragm.\r\nThe terrane lends itself to the appellative, forming, as it does, a\r\ndark dividing strip of country between the brilliant reddish-ochre\r\nhemisphere on the north and the half-toned islands to the south of it.\r\nBy Schiaparelli it was thought to be one long Mediterranean, and though\r\nits marine character is now disproved, that it lies lower than the\r\nbright ochre regions is likely. To this difference of level is probably\r\ndue the peculiar phenomenon which there manifested itself to careful\r\nscrutiny in 1894. For it was there only that it occurred.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon in question consisted of nicks in the coastline, of\r\ntriangular shape and filled with shading. They occurred at intervals\r\nalong it and were of the general form of carets, such marks as one\r\nmakes in checking items down a list. Their position was always where a\r\ncanal debouched from the diaphragm upon its career across the open\r\ncontinent. The canal itself was by no means necessarily visible. On the\r\ncontrary, at first it was usually absent. Such was the case with those\r\nmarking the departure-points of the Phison and Euphrates and of the\r\nAmenthes and Lethes, which appeared, without being well defined, from\r\nthe moment the planet came to be scanned.\r\n\r\nOne by one these carets stood out to view, punctuating the points where\r\ncanals later were to show or terminating those that already existed.\r\nStrung thus with them at intervals was the whole coastline of the\r\ndiaphragm, beginning with the Mare Icarium and stretching round through\r\nthe Mare Tyrrhenum, Mare Cimmerium, Mare Sirenum, and Mare Erythraeum\r\nto the Mare Icarium again. As the planet got nearer to the earth their\r\npeculiar shape began to define itself, and it was again in the case of\r\nthose giving origin to the Phison and Euphrates that the recognition\r\ncame first. What had appeared earlier simply as a spot now stood out as\r\ntwo triangular notches, indenting the coast and giving exit at their\r\napices, the eastern one to the Phison, the western to the Euphrates.\r\nThese were the things, then, that had constituted the Portus Sigaeus of\r\nSchiaparelli.\r\n\r\nCommonly the carets lie at the bottom of well-marked bays, as, for\r\nexample, those terminating the Syrtis Minor and the Sinus Titanum. But\r\nfrequently they are placed in the very midst of a long and otherwise\r\nunaccented coast, as is the case in mid-course of the Mare Cimmerium\r\nand the Mare Sirenum. Yet in no instance is the thing unassociated with\r\na canal. In every case one or more canals leave the caret for their\r\nlong traverse down the disk.\r\n\r\nThis is not their only canal connection. When the canals in the dark\r\nregions came to be discovered, each of them was found by me, as nearly\r\nas difficult observations would permit, to be associated with the caret\r\nupon its other side. Thus the lacing of the Mare Cimmerium and Sirenum\r\nused them as its reeving-points. Similarly those at the mouths of the\r\nPhison and Euphrates did duty likewise to the Maesolus and the Ion. In\r\nsuch manner the carets stood in dual relation to canals; subserving a\r\npurpose to the light-region canals on the one hand and to the\r\ndark-region ones on the other. In a way the caret, then, holds the same\r\nposition toward the canals that do the spots in the light or dark\r\nregions. Like them it is a canal-distribution point. Unlike them,\r\nhowever, in shape it is triangular instead of round, and we are piqued\r\nto inquire to what cause it can owe its different contour. The answer\r\nseems to lie in the character of the locality, not simply in its\r\ncomplexion. For the spots in both the northern and the southern dark\r\npatches are as circular as those standing in the light, whether they\r\nlie in the centre or upon the edges of them. The edges of the northern\r\npatches, however, and the other sides of the southern ones do not\r\npresent the clear-cut character of the northern coast of the diaphragm.\r\nWhere they seem to be definitely bounded they are so by darker canals.\r\nThis hints that their contours are not defined by antithesis of level,\r\nwhile that of the northern coast of the great diaphragm is. Difference\r\nof altitude is then concerned in their constitution; the canal system\r\nhere falls to a lower level, and these triangular spots instead of\r\nround ones are the result. Topographic only, such explanation leads the\r\nway to a more teleologic one, and serves even on first acquaintance to\r\nstir curiosity to some satisfying cause.\r\n\r\nSuggestive in several ways for its resemblance to the carets is another\r\ndetail not far distant from the Portus Sigaei, the twin-forked Sabaeus\r\nSinus. Curiously enough, this feature of Mars, which has been well\r\nknown and recognized ever since the eagle-eyed Dawes detected it more\r\nthan forty years ago, proves to be a sort of connecting link between\r\nthe main markings and the details of more modern detection. The\r\ntwin-forked Sabaeus Sinus, as its name implies, is of the form of a\r\ndouble bay; was considered to be one in fact so long as the _maria_\r\nwere held to be seas. It straddles the point of land which, called the\r\nFastigium Aryn, has been taken for the Greenwich of Martian longitudes.\r\nEach ‘bay’—not in truth a bay at all—indents the ochre in an acute\r\ntriangle, from the tip of which many canals proceed like the rays of a\r\nfan from a holding hand. Both tips are darker than the main body of the\r\ndark _mare_ from which they proceed. They thus recall in general\r\ncharacter the carets. They further reproduce specifically the Portus\r\nSigaei, for they give origin to two doubles, the Gihon and the\r\nHiddekel, in exactly the same manner that the two nicks of the Portus\r\nSigaei do to the Phison and Euphrates. Nor are their tips much farther\r\napart than those of the Portus, five degrees measuring the spread of\r\nthe one and four degrees that of the other respectively; the reason for\r\ntheir earlier discovery lying in their greater size. They thus perform\r\nthe same office as the Portus Sigaeus, are quite comparable to it in\r\nwidth, and differ in shape only as a larger and more acute triangle\r\ndiffers from a smaller and blunter one. Undreamt of by Dawes and\r\nunheeded since, they were the first hint to the world of the duality\r\nwhich forms so strangely pervasive a feature of the canal system of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThus the carets stand connected with the canals quite as intimately as\r\nthe oases but in a significantly different manner. For, in addition to\r\ntheir intermediary standing between the light regions and the dark,\r\ntheir relation to the doubles is peculiar. An instance is offered by\r\nthe double Euphrates and another by the Ganges. The Euphrates, as we\r\nsaw in Chapter XVIII, leaves the Portus Sigaei at the south, one line\r\nleaving each caret centrally, so that each caret is concerned only with\r\nits own line and has no connection with its fellow. At their northern\r\nends both lines have similarly each its own Lucus Ismenius. The like\r\nseems to be true of the Ganges. Similarly the twin Titan, have each its\r\nown. Such twin duty in the matter of doubles seems to be the rule with\r\nthe carets, even more so than with the oases; and this is probably from\r\nthe fact that the coastline is of more limited extent than the interior.\r\n\r\nAltogether the carets offer to our inspection glosses in finer print\r\nupon the general text of the canals. Thought upon what they show takes\r\nus a step farther toward the solution of the strange riddle of this\r\nother world, a riddle which he who runs may not read, still less scout,\r\nand which only reasoning, without prejudice or partiality, can unravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                        THE CANALS PHOTOGRAPHED\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotography holds to-day a place of publicity in the exposition of the\r\nstars. Directed by Draper to the heavens thirty-four years ago, the\r\ncamera recorded then the first picture ever taken of the moon. From\r\nthis initial peering into celestial matters, practice has progressed\r\nuntil now the dry plate constitutes one of the most formidable engines\r\nin astronomic research. Not most effectively, however, in the field\r\nwhich might have been predicted. Beautiful as the lunar presentment\r\nwas, as a presentiment of what was coming, it pointed astray. For it is\r\nnot in lunar portrayal, superbly as its crater walls in crescent\r\nchiaroscuro or its crags that cast their tapering shadows athwart the\r\ndial of its plains stand out in the latest photographs of our\r\nsatellite, that the camera’s greatest service has since been done.\r\nImpressive as they are, these pictorial triumphs are chiefly popular,\r\nand appeal on their face to layman and scientist alike. Not in the\r\nnearest to us of the orbs of heaven, but in the most remote has\r\ncelestial photography’s most prolific field been found to lie. Its\r\nprovince has proved preëminently the stars, especially the farthest\r\noff, and that star-dust, the nebulæ, from out of which the stars are\r\nmade. Reason for this explains at once its efficiency and its\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\nIts rival, of course, is the eye. It is as regards the eye that its\r\ncomparative merits or demerits stand to be judged. Now, thus viewed,\r\nits superiority in one respect is unquestionable; it simply states\r\nfacts. But though it cannot misinform, it can color its facts by giving\r\nundue prominence to the effect of some rays and suppressing the\r\nevidence of others, so that its testimony is not, it must be\r\nremembered, always in accord with that of human vision. Speaking\r\nbroadly, however, it is so little complicated a machine as to register\r\nits results with more precision than the retina. The evidence of the\r\ncamera has thus one important advantage over other astronomic\r\ndocuments: it is impersonally trustworthy in what it states. Bias it\r\nhas none, and its mistakes are few. Imperfections, indeed, affect it,\r\nbut they are of purely physical occasion and may be eliminated or\r\naccounted for as well by another as by the photographer himself.\r\n\r\nIn trustworthiness, then, so far as it goes, it stands commended; not\r\nso much may be said of its ability. This depends upon the work to which\r\nit is put. In certain lines it asserts preëminence; in certain others\r\nit is so far behind as to be out of the race. The reason for both is\r\none and the same, for, as the French would say: It has the faults of\r\nits quality. The very trait that fits it for one function, bars it from\r\nthe other. This excellence is that by which the tortoise outstripped\r\nthe hare,—a plodding perseverance. Far less sensitive than the retina\r\nthe dry plate has one advantage over its rival,—its action is\r\ncumulative. The eye sees all it can in the twentieth of a second; after\r\nthat its perception, instead of increasing, is dulled, and no amount of\r\napplication will result in adding more. With the dry plate it is the\r\nreverse. Time works for, not against it. Within limits, themselves\r\nlong, light affects it throughout the period it stands exposed and,\r\nroughly speaking, in direct ratio to the time elapsed. Thus the camera\r\nis able to record stars no human eye has ever caught and to register\r\nthe structure of nebulæ the eye tries to resolve in vain.\r\n\r\nWhere illumination alone is concerned the camera reigns supreme; not so\r\nwhen it comes to a question of definition. Then by its speed and\r\nagility the eye steps into its place, for the atmosphere is not the\r\nvoid it could be wished, through which the light-waves shoot at will.\r\nPulsing athwart it are air-waves of condensation and rarefaction that\r\nnow obstruct, now further, the passage of the ray. By the nimbleness of\r\nits action the eye cunningly contrives to catch the good moments among\r\nthe poor and carry their message to the brain. The dry plate by its\r\nslowness is impotent to follow. To register anything, it must take the\r\nbad with the better to a complete confusion of detail. For the\r\nair-waves throw the image first to one place and then to another, to a\r\nblotting of both.\r\n\r\nAll of which renders the stars, where lighting counts for so much and\r\nform for so little, the peculiar province of celestial photography.\r\nWith the study of the surfaces of the planets the exact contrary is the\r\ncase. With most of them illumination is already to be had in abundance;\r\ndefinition it is that is desired. What succeeds so excellently with the\r\nstars is here put to it to do anything at all. At its best, the camera\r\nis hopelessly behind the eye when it comes to the decipherment of\r\nplanetary detail. To say that the eye is ten times the more perceptive\r\nis not to overstep the mark. To try, therefore, here to supplant the\r\neye by the camera is time thrown away.\r\n\r\nOf scant importance to the expert in such matters as Mars, there is a\r\nside of the subject in which service might be hoped of it: that of\r\nelementary exposition. Congenitally incapable of competing with the eye\r\nin discovery, the most that, by any possibility, could be looked for\r\nwould be a recording of the coarser details after the fact. For this\r\nreason it had long been a purpose at Flagstaff to photograph some at\r\nleast of the canals. But the project seemed chimerical. To get an image\r\nsuitable at all some seconds of exposure would be required, and during\r\nsuch time the shifting air-waves would blur the very detail desired to\r\nbe got. It was a problem of essential premises mutually annihilative.\r\nThe more the would-be photographer should avoid the one; the more he\r\nwould fall into the other.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the thing was tried in 1901. In 1903 the subject was taken\r\nup by Mr. Lampland, then new at the observatory. The results were\r\nbetter than those of two years before, the images more clear-cut but\r\nstill incommunicable of canals. Still they were satisfactory enough to\r\nspur to increased endeavor, and during the following interopposition\r\npreparations were made to grapple with the planet as successfully as\r\ncould be devised at its next return. This happened in May, 1905. It\r\nthen showed a disk only 17′′ in diameter, or 1/120 that of the\r\nmoon,—and this disk Mr. Lampland attacked with the 24-inch and a\r\nnegative amplificator that increased the focal length of the former to\r\n143 feet. At such focus the planet’s image was received upon the plate.\r\nEverything that could conduce to success had been put in requisition.\r\nTo this end of better definition the color curve of the objective was\r\nfirst got, and for it a special color screen constructed by Wallace. In\r\nspite of its name no achromatic is so in fact, but brings rays of\r\ndifferent tint to different focus. The color curve shows where these\r\nseverally lie, and the color screen, a chemically tinted piece of\r\nglass, is to absorb all those which would blur the image by having a\r\ndifferent focus from the ones retained. Next, all manner of plates were\r\ntried. For in these again it was necessary to reconcile two\r\ncontradictory characters, a rapid plate and a well-defining one. For\r\nthe coarser the grain the speedier the plate; and coarse grain\r\ndisfigures the detail. Both qualities on so small an image were\r\nobligatory and yet both could not be got. Then the clock had to be as\r\nsmooth-running as possible. So by a suggestion of Mr. Cogshall’s one\r\nwas obtained that filled this requisite, a new form of conical\r\npendulum. Upon this a further refinement was practiced. Ordinarily\r\nclockwork is timed to follow the stars; this was altered to follow the\r\nplanet, and so keep it more nearly motionless while its picture was\r\nbeing taken. Then the device of capping down the telescope to suit the\r\nair-waves, which had been found so effective to the bringing out of\r\nfine detail, was put in practice. Lastly, all developers were tried,\r\nand those found suited to the finest work were used.\r\n\r\nMany pictures were taken on each plate one after the other, both to\r\nvary the exposure and to catch such good moments as might chance. Seven\r\nhundred images were thus got in all; the days of best definition alone\r\nbeing utilized. The eagerness with which the first plate was scanned as\r\nit emerged from its last bath may be imagined, and the joy when on it\r\nsome of the canals could certainly be seen. There were the old\r\nconfigurations of patches, the light areas and the dark, just as they\r\nlooked through the telescope, and never till then otherwise seen of\r\nhuman eye, and there more marvelous yet were the grosser of those lines\r\nthat had so piqued human curiosity, the canals of Mars. He who ran\r\nmight now read, so that he had some acquaintance with photography. By\r\nMr. Lampland’s thought, assiduity, and skill, the seemingly impossible\r\nhad been done.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial success was thus assured, plates were taken at other\r\npoints around the planet and other well-known features came out;\r\n“continents” and “seas,” “canals” and “oases,” the curious geography of\r\nthe planet printed for the first time by itself in black and white. By\r\nchance on one of the plates a temporal event was found registered too,\r\nthe first snowfall of the season, the beginning of the new polar cap,\r\nseen visually just before the plate happened to be put in and\r\nreproduced by it unmistakably. Upon the many images thirty-eight canals\r\nwere counted in all, and one of them, the Nilokeras, double. Thus did\r\nthe canals at last speak for their own reality themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART III\r\n\r\n                          THE CANALS IN ACTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                           CANALS: KINEMATIC\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far in our account of the phenomena we have regarded the lines, the\r\nspots, and everything that is theirs solely from the point of view of\r\ntheir appearance at any one time. In other words, we have viewed them\r\nonly from a static standpoint. In this we have followed the course of\r\nthe facts, since in this way were the canals first observed. We now\r\ncome to a different phase of the matter,—the important disclosure,\r\nwith continued looking, that these strange things show themselves to be\r\nsubject to change. That is, they take on a kinematic character. This at\r\nonce opens a fresh field of inquiry concerning them and widens the\r\nhorizon of research. It increases the complexity of the problem, but at\r\nthe same time makes it more determinate. For while it greatly augments\r\nthe number of facts which must be collected toward an explanation of\r\nwhat the things are, these once acquired, it narrows the solution which\r\ncan apply to them.\r\n\r\nThe fact of change in the Martian markings forces itself upon any one\r\nwho will diligently study the planet. He will be inclined at first to\r\nattribute it to observational mistakes of his own or his predecessor’s\r\nmaking, preferably the latter. But eventually his own delineations will\r\nprove irreconcilable with one another, and he will then realize the\r\ninjustice of his inference and will put the cause, where indeed it\r\nrightly belongs, on the things themselves. Confronted by this fact he\r\nwill the more fully appreciate how long and systematic must be the\r\nstudy of him who would penetrate the planet’s peculiarity. Just as the\r\nrecognition of something akin to seasonal change came to Schiaparelli,\r\nbecause of his attending to the planet with an assiduity unknown to his\r\npredecessors; so it became evident that to learn the laws of these\r\nchanges and from them the meaning of the markings, there was necessary\r\nas full and as continuous a record of them as it was possible to\r\nobtain. For this end it was not enough to get observations from time to\r\ntime, however good these might be, but to secure as nearly as might be\r\na complete succession of such, day after day, month after month, and\r\nopposition after opposition. The outcome justified the deduction. And\r\nit is specially gratifying to realize that to no one have the method\r\nand the results thus obtained appealed with more force than to\r\nSchiaparelli himself.\r\n\r\nPerseverance in scanning the disk long after the casual observer had\r\nconsidered it too far away for observational purposes, resulted in\r\nSchiaparelli’s detection of the canals, and this through a\r\ncharacteristic of theirs destined to play a great part in their\r\nhistory, their susceptibility to change. He tells us in his _Memoria I_\r\nhow Aeria and the adjoining regions showed blank of any markings while\r\nthe planet was near in 1877 and the disk large and well shown, and then\r\nhow, to his surprise, as the planet got farther away and the disk\r\nshrank, lines began to come out in the region with unmistakable\r\ncertainty. Thus to the very variability which had hidden them to others\r\nwas due in Schiaparelli’s hands their initial recognition.\r\n\r\nFlux affecting the canals was apparent from the outset of my own\r\nobservations. No less the subject of transformation than the large dark\r\nregions was the network of tenuous lines that overspread them. At times\r\nthey were very hard to make out, and then again they were comparatively\r\neasy. Distance, instead of rendering them more difficult, frequently\r\ndid the reverse. Nor was the matter one of veiling. Neither our own\r\natmosphere nor that of Mars showed itself in any way responsible for\r\ntheir temporary disappearance. It was not always when our atmospheric\r\nconditions were best that the lines stood out most clearly, and as to\r\nMartian meteorology there was no sign that it had anything whatever to\r\ndo with the obliteration. Long before the canals were dreamt of,\r\nveiling by Martian clouds or mist had been considered the cause of\r\nthose changes in the planet’s general features, which are too extensive\r\nand deep-toned wholly to escape observation even though none too\r\nclearly seen. It was early evident to me that they were not the cause\r\nof general topographic change, and equally clearly as inoperative in\r\nthose that affected the canals. In short, nothing extrinsic to the\r\ncanal caused its disappearance; whatever the change was, its action lay\r\nintrinsic to the canal itself.\r\n\r\nOn occasion canals in whole regions appeared to be blotted out. The\r\nmost careful scrutiny would fail to disclose them, where some time\r\nbefore they had been perfectly clear. And this though distance was at\r\nits minimum and definition at its best. Even the strongest marked of\r\nthe strange pencil lines would show at times only as ghosts of their\r\nformer selves, while for their more delicate companions it taxed one’s\r\nfaith to believe that they could ever really have existed. Illumination\r\nwas invoked to account for this, and plays a part in the effect\r\nundoubtedly. For at plumb opposition the centre of the disk for two or\r\nthree years has shown less detail than before and after that event.\r\nThis is probably due not, as with the moon, to the withdrawal of\r\nshadows, but to the greater glare to which the disk is then subjected.\r\nBut this is not the chief cause of the change.\r\n\r\nStill more striking and unaccountable was the fact that each canal had\r\nits own times and seasons for showing or remaining hid. Each had its\r\nentrances upon the scene and its exits from it. What dated the one left\r\nanother unaffected. The Nilokeras was to be seen when the Chrysorrhoas\r\nwas invisible, and the Jamuna perfectly evident when the Indus could\r\nscarcely be made out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing seasonal change.\r\n\r\nI.]\r\n\r\nSo much shows in the two drawings here reproduced. The increase of the\r\nGanges and the advent of the Chrysorrhoas are noticeable in the second\r\nover the first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing seasonal change.\r\n\r\nII.]\r\n\r\nSeasonal changes seemed the only thing to account for the phenomena.\r\nAnd in a general sense this was undoubtedly the explanation. To learn\r\nmore about the matter, to verify it if it existed, and to particularize\r\nit if possible, I determined to undertake an investigation permitting\r\nof quantitative precision in the case. A method of doing this occurred\r\nto me which would yield results deserving of consideration from the\r\namount of data upon which each was based and capable of being compared\r\nwith one another upon an equal footing from which relative information\r\ncould be derived. It seemed wise to determine from the drawings the\r\ndegree of visibility of a given canal at different seasons of the\r\nMartian year, and then to do this for every important canal during the\r\nsame period of time. The great number of the drawings suggested this\r\nuse to which they might be put. For from a great accumulation of data a\r\nset of statistics on the subject could be secured in which accident or\r\nbias would be largely eliminated and the telling effect of averages\r\nmake itself felt.\r\n\r\nTo render this possible it was necessary that the drawings should be\r\nalike numerous, consecutive, and extended in time. These conditions\r\nwere fulfilled by the drawings made by me at the opposition of 1903.\r\nThree hundred and seventy-two drawings had then been secured, and they\r\ncovered between them a period of six months and a half. They were also\r\nas consecutive as it was possible to secure. During a part of the\r\nperiod the planet was seen and drawn at every twenty-four hours, from\r\nApril 5, namely, to May 26, or for forty-six consecutive days. Though\r\nthe rest of the time did not equal this perfection, no great gap\r\noccurred, and one hundred and forty-three nights were utilized in all.\r\nFurthermore, as these drawings were all made by one man, the personal\r\nequation of the observer—a very important source of deviation where\r\ndrawings are to be compared—was eliminated.\r\n\r\nBut even this does not give an idea of the mass of the data. For by the\r\nmethod employed about 100 drawings were used in the case of each canal,\r\nand as 109 canals were examined this gave 10,900 separate\r\ndeterminations upon which the ultimate result depended. That each of\r\nthese determinations was independent of the others will appear from a\r\ndescription of the method itself on which the investigation was\r\nconducted. To understand that method one must begin a little way back.\r\n\r\nAs the two planets, Mars and the Earth, turn on their axes the parts of\r\ntheir surfaces they present to each other are constantly changing. For\r\na feature on Mars to be visible from a given post on earth, observer\r\nand observed must confront each other, and, furthermore, it must be day\r\nthere when it is night here. But, as Mars takes about forty minutes\r\nlonger to turn than the Earth, such confronting occurs later and later\r\neach night by about forty minutes, until finally it does not occur at\r\nall while Mars is suitably above the horizon; then the feature passes\r\nfrom sight to remain hidden till the difference of the rotations brings\r\nit round into view again. There are thus times when a given region is\r\nvisible, times when it is not, and these succeed each other in from\r\nfive to six weeks, and are called presentations. For about a fortnight\r\nat each presentation a region is centrally enough placed to be well\r\nseen; for the rest of the period either ill-placed or on the other side\r\nof the planet.\r\n\r\nIf a marking were always salient enough it would appear in every\r\ndrawing made of the disk during the recurrent fortnights of its\r\ndisplay. If it were weaker than this, it might appear on some drawings\r\nand not on others, dependent upon its own strength and upon the\r\ndefinition at the moment, and we should have a certain percentage of\r\nvisibility for it at that presentation. While if it changed in strength\r\nbetween one presentation and the next, the percentage of its recording\r\nwould change likewise. Definition of course is always varying, but if\r\nits value be noted at the time of each drawing this factor may be\r\nallowed for more or less successfully. Making such allowance, together\r\nwith other corrections to produce extrinsic equality, such as the\r\nplanet’s distance, which we need not enter upon here, we are left with\r\nonly the marking’s intrinsic visibility to affect the percentages; that\r\nis, the percentages tell of the changes it has successively undergone\r\nand give us a history of its wax and wane.\r\n\r\nFrom drawings accurately made it is possible to add to the accuracy of\r\nthe percentage by noting in each, not only the presence or absence of\r\nthe marking, but the degree of strength with which it is represented.\r\nThis was done on the final investigation in the present case, and it\r\nwas interesting to note how little difference it made in the result.\r\n\r\nThe longitude of each canal was known, and the longitude of the central\r\nmeridian of each drawing was always calculated and tabulated with the\r\ndrawing, so that it was possible to tell which drawings might have\r\nshown the canal. Only when the position of the canal was within a\r\ncertain number of degrees of the centre of the drawing (60°) was the\r\ndrawing used in the result, allowance being duly made for the loss upon\r\nthe phase side. Each drawing, it should be remembered, was as nearly an\r\ninstantaneous picture of the disk as possible. It covered only a few\r\nminutes of observation, and was made practically as if the observer had\r\nnever seen the planet before. In other words, the man was sunk in the\r\nmanner. Such mental effacement is as vital to good observation as\r\nmental assertion is afterward to pregnant reasoning. For a man should\r\nbe a machine in collecting his data, a mind in coördinating them. To\r\nreverse the process, as is sometimes done, is not conducive to science.\r\n\r\nWhen the successive true percentages of visibility of a given canal had\r\nthus been found, they were plotted vertically at points along a\r\nhorizontal line corresponding in distance from the origin to the number\r\nof days after (or before) the summer solstice of the Martian northern\r\nhemisphere. The horizontal distance thus measured the time while the\r\nvertical height gave the relative visibility. The points so plotted\r\nwere then joined by a smooth curve. This curve reproduced the\r\ncontinuous change in visibility undergone by the canal during the\r\nperiod under observation. It gave a graphic picture of the canal’s\r\nchange of state. It seemed, therefore, proper to call it the canal’s\r\ncartouche or sign manual.\r\n\r\nIn this manner were obtained the cartouches of 109 canals. Now, as the\r\npresence or absence of any canal in any drawing was entirely\r\nirrespective of the presence or absence of another, each such datum\r\nspoke only for itself, and was an entirely independent observation. The\r\nwhole investigation thus rested on 10,900 completely separate\r\ndeterminations, each as unconditioned by the others as if it existed\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAs every factor outside of the canal itself which could affect the\r\nlatter’s visibility was taken account of, and the correction due to it\r\nas nearly as possible applied before the cartouches were deduced, the\r\nlatter represent the visibility of the canal _due to intrinsic change\r\nalone_. In other words, they give not the apparent only but the real\r\nhistory of the canal for the period concerned.\r\n\r\nImportant disclosures result from inspection of the cartouches. This we\r\nshall perceive by considering what different curves mean in the case.\r\nIf the canal were an unchangeable phenomenon, for any reason whatever,\r\nits cartouche would be a _straight line parallel to the horizon_ of the\r\ndiagram. This is evident from the fact that the visibility would then\r\nnever vary. If, on the other hand, it were waxing and waning, and the\r\nwax or wane were uniform, the cartouche would be a straight line\r\n_inclined to the horizontal_; rising if the canal were increasing,\r\nfalling when it decreased. Lastly, if the rate of change itself varied,\r\nthe cartouche would be a curve concave or convex to the line denoting\r\nthe time, according as the rate of change of the growth or decay grew\r\ngreater or less.\r\n\r\nTo see this the more clearly, we may set over against the cartouche the\r\ncanal character it signalizes:—\r\n\r\n           Cartouche.

Thus the cartouches reveal to us the complete\r\nhistory of the canals,—what changes they underwent and the times at\r\nwhich these occurred. The cartouche, then, is the graphic portrayal of\r\nthe canal’s behavior. It not only distinguishes at once between the\r\ndead and the living, as we may call the effect of intrinsic change, but\r\nit tells the exact character of this change,—the way it varied from\r\ntime to time, the epoch at which the development was at its minimum or\r\nits maximum for any given canal, and lastly, its actual strength at any\r\ntime, thus giving its relative importance in the canal system. For the\r\nheight of the curve above the diagrammatic horizon marks the absolute\r\nas well as the relative visibility and enables us to rank the canals\r\nbetween themselves.\r\n\r\nNow, the first point it furnishes a criterion for is the real or\r\nillusory character of the canals. If a line be due to illusion, whether\r\noptical or physical, it can vary only from extrinsic cause, since it\r\nhas no intrinsic existence. If, therefore, all extrinsic cause be\r\nallowed for, the cartouche of this ghost must needs be a _horizontal\r\nstraight line_. Even if the extrinsic factors to its production be\r\nimperfectly accounted for, their retention could only cause systematic\r\nvariations from the straight line in all the lines, which would\r\nthemselves vary systematically, and these factors could therefore be\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nThis criterion is absolute. Unless all the cartouches were\r\napproximately straight lines, no illusion theory of any kind whatever\r\ncould explain the facts. Even then the lines might all be real; for\r\nunchangeable reality would produce the same effect on the cartouches as\r\nillusion. In the case therefore of horizontal straight line cartouches,\r\nwe should have no guarantee on that score of reality or illusion; but,\r\non the other hand, curves or inclined straight lines in them would be\r\ninstantly fatal to all illusion theories.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the 109 cartouches obtained in 1903, the first point to\r\nstrike one’s notice is that all but three of them are curves and that\r\neven these three must be accepted with a caveat. Here, then, the\r\ncartouches dispose once and for all of any and every illusion theory.\r\nThey show conclusively that the canals are real objects which wax and\r\nwane from some intrinsic cause.\r\n\r\nThe second result afforded by the cartouches is not of a destructive,\r\nnegative character,—however valuable the destruction of bars to\r\nknowledge may be,—but of a constructive, positive one. It does not,\r\nlike the first, follow from mere inspection, but is brought to light\r\nonly by comparison of all the cartouches. In a positive way, therefore,\r\nits testimony is as conclusive as it was in a negative direction. For\r\nthat 10,900 separate and independent data should result in a general\r\nlaw of development through either conscious or unconscious bias, when\r\nthose data would have to be combined in so complicated a manner for the\r\nresult to emerge as is here the case, is impossible. Chance could not\r\ndo it and consciousness would require a coördinate memory, to which\r\nMurphy’s nine games of chess at once would be child’s play.\r\n\r\nOf the 109 canals examined 106 showed by their cartouches that they had\r\nbeen during the whole or a part of the period in a state of change. But\r\nthe change was not the same for all. In some the minimum came early; in\r\nothers, late. Some decreased to nothing and stayed there; others\r\nincreased from zero and were increasing still at the time observations\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nLatitude proved the means of bringing comparative order out of the\r\nchaos. When the canals were ranged according to their latitude on the\r\nplanet, a law in their development came to light. To understand it, the\r\ncircumstances under which the canals were presented must be considered\r\nas regards the then season of the planet’s year. In 1903 the planet\r\npassed on February 28 through the point of its orbit where the summer\r\nsolstice of the northern hemisphere occurs. One hundred and twenty-six\r\ndays later took place the first snowfall in the arctic and subarctic\r\nregions, an event that denoted the beginning of the new polar cap; from\r\nwhich date the snow there gradually increased. Its autumnal equinox the\r\nplanet did not reach till August 29. Now, the canals were observed from\r\nthirty-six days before the summer solstice of the northern hemisphere\r\nto one hundred and forty-seven days after that event. We may tabulate\r\nthe dates as follows:—\r\n\r\n  ================+===========+================\r\n     DAY FROM     |  VERNAL   | CORRESPONDING\r\n  SUMMER SOLSTICE | LONGITUDE | DATE ON EARTH\r\n  ----------------+-----------+----------------\r\n        -30       |    77°    |    June 9\r\n          0       |    90°    |    June 22\r\n        +30       |   103°    |    July 6\r\n        +60       |   117°    |    July 20\r\n        +90       |   131°    |    August 4\r\n       +120       |   146°    |    August 20\r\n       +150       |   162°    |    September 5\r\n  ================+===========+================\r\n\r\nThe vernal longitude is the longitude of the planet in its orbit\r\nreckoned from the vernal equinox. From the table it appears that the\r\ncartouches cover the development of the canals from about June 6 to\r\nSeptember 1 of the Martian northern hemisphere for the current but to\r\nus undated year, _ab Marte condita_.\r\n\r\nThe 109 canals included all the more conspicuous canals on the planet\r\nat that opposition, all those that lent themselves by the sufficient\r\nfrequency with which they were seen to a statistical result. They lay\r\nspread all the way between the edge of the polar cap in latitude 87°\r\nnorth to the extreme limit south, at which the then tilt of the north\r\npole toward the earth permitted of canal recognition. This southern\r\nlimit was in about latitude 35° south. Farther south than this vision\r\nbecame too oblique, amounting as it did, with an adverse tilt of\r\ntwenty-five degrees to start with, to something over sixty degrees, for\r\ndetection of such fine markings to be possible. Between the two limits\r\nthus imposed, by the perpetual snow on the one side and the\r\nobservational tilt on the other, the 109 canals were distributed by\r\nzones as follows:—\r\n\r\n  =================+===============+===========\r\n      ZONE         |   LATITUDE    | NUMBER OF\r\n                   |               |  CANALS\r\n  -----------------+---------------+-----------\r\n  North Polar      | 87° N.-78° N. |     1\r\n  Arctic           | 78° N.-66° N. |     9\r\n  Sub-Arctic       | 66° N.-51° N. |     9\r\n  North Temperate  | 51° N.-37° N. |    11\r\n  North Sub-Tropic | 37° N.-24° N. |    18\r\n  North Tropic     | 24° N.-12° N. |    21\r\n  North Equatorial | 12° N.- 0° N. |    14\r\n  South Equatorial |  0° N.-12° S. |    17\r\n  South Tropic     | 12° S.-24° S. |     7\r\n  South Sub-Tropic | 24° S.-37° S. |     2\r\n  =================+===============+===========\r\n\r\nAs the latitude of a canal in the investigation was taken as that of\r\nits mid-point, such being the mean value of its successive parts, the\r\nlatitudes about which information was obtained lay within the limits\r\ngiven above, the most northern canal, the Jaxartes N having for its\r\nmid-latitude 78° north, and the most southern, the Nectar, that of 27°\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe zones comprised each a belt of territory about thirteen degrees\r\nwide, the first being less solely because in part occupied by the\r\npermanent polar cap.\r\n\r\nThe curves of all the canals in a given zone have been combined into a\r\nmean curve or cartouche for that zone; and then the cartouches for the\r\nseveral zones have been represented and ranged according to latitude on\r\nthe accompanying plate. Consideration of these mean canal cartouches is\r\nvery instructive. In the first place not one of them is a straight\r\nline, either horizontal or inclined. All are curves and, with the\r\nexception of the top one, all show a minimum or lowest point during the\r\nperiod under observation. From this point they rise with the time, or\r\nto the right on the plate. A black star marks this minimum, and is\r\nfound farther and farther to the right as one goes down the plate; that\r\nis, as one travels from the neighborhood of the arctic regions down to\r\nthe equator and then over into the planet’s southern hemisphere.\r\nDrawing now a line approximately through the stars and remembering that\r\nthe minimum means the date at which the canal started to develop, we\r\nsee that the canal development began at the border of the north polar\r\ncap and thence continued down the disk over the planet’s surface, as\r\nfar as observation permitted the surface to be seen, which was some\r\nthirty-five degrees into the other hemisphere. This is the first broad\r\nfact disclosed by the cartouches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _MEAN CANAL CARTOUCHES_\r\n\r\nP.L.]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the development took place at an approximately uniform\r\nrate. This is shown by the fact that the line passing through the black\r\nstars is approximately straight; for such straightness means that\r\nprogression down the disk as measured by the latitude bore throughout\r\nthe same ratio to the time elapsed.\r\n\r\nLooking at them again we notice that the three topmost cartouches,\r\nthose of the north polar, arctic, and sub-arctic canals respectively,\r\ndip at the right before the end of the observations, while the other\r\nseven were still rising when those observations were brought to a\r\nclose. A reason for this, or at least a significant coincidence, is to\r\nbe found in the dotted line pendent from the top of the table and\r\nlabelled “First Frosts.” This dotted line denotes the date at which the\r\nfirst extensive frost occurred in the polar regions; for even before\r\nthis time patches of white had appeared north of the Mare Acidalium,\r\ndenoting the on-coming of the cold. The frost did not last but came and\r\nwent and came again just as it does on earth, growing more insistent\r\nand long-lived at each fresh fall. Its sphere of operation was confined\r\nto the three zones in question. Even these zones it by no means\r\ncovered, merely blotching them in places with fungi-like patches of\r\nfrost. Beyond them south it never extended during the period of the\r\nobservations; indeed, it hardly entered the sub-arctic zone at all at\r\nthis very beginning of the polar winter. For it was only August 20\r\nthen. The coincidence of the isotherm as betrayed by the deposition of\r\nfrost with the dividing line between the canal-development curves that\r\ndip down at this season and those that still continue to rise is\r\nsuggestive.\r\n\r\nIt becomes all the more so when the three cartouches are considered\r\nseriatim. The most polewards, the north polar one, had sunk to zero\r\nsometime before the first extensive frost occurred; the second, the\r\narctic, did so later than its northern neighbor, probably just before\r\nthe epoch in question; while the third, practically outside the zone of\r\ndeposition, was behind both the others in its descent. Inspection of\r\nthe drawings upon which the cartouches are based confirms an inference\r\ndeduced from this: that it was cold that killed, not frost that\r\ncovered, them, which was responsible for their obliteration. The\r\ndrawings show that the canals ceased to be seen before the white\r\npatches were evident. Now this would be the exact behavior of\r\nvegetation. It would be killed, turned brown by freezing, and so\r\nrendered invisible to us against its ochre desert background, before\r\nthe cold had grown intense enough to cover that ground with a solid\r\nwhite carpet of frost. At the opposition of 1905, however, the extreme\r\nnorthern canals were visible after the snow had covered all the country\r\nabout them, being evident as lines threading the new cap.\r\n\r\nThese three cartouches furthermore show each a maximum, and what is\r\nsignificant the maximum occurs later in time for each, according as the\r\nzone lies remote from the pole. A red star marks this maximum and shows\r\nthat the time of greatest development for the three zones was\r\nrespectively:—\r\n\r\n         41 days after the summer solstice for the North Polar.\r\n         61 days after the summer solstice for the Arctic.\r\n         95 days after the summer solstice for the Sub-Arctic.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to the other curves, those that were unaffected by cold.\r\nThough in these the minima themselves show the law of latitudinal\r\nprogression, the wavelike character of the advance is even better\r\ndisclosed by the curves. As the eye follows them down the page, the\r\nadvance of the wave to the right is plainly apparent. The slope of the\r\nwave is much the same for all, implying that a like force was at work\r\nsuccessively down the latitudes.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed next that in all the mean cartouches the gradient is\r\ngreater after the minimum than before it. The curves fall gently to\r\ntheir lowest points and rise more steeply from them. Such profile\r\nindicates that the effects of a previous force were slowly dying out\r\ndown to the minimum and that then an impulse started in to act afresh.\r\nThis explains the attitude of the canals that died out. In them the\r\neffect of the old force shows as in the others, but no impulse came in\r\ntheir case to resuscitation.\r\n\r\nIt seems possible to trace this force to an origin at the south. For\r\nbeginning with the north sub-tropic zone the gradient on the left shows\r\nless and less steep southward to the south sub-tropic zone. Such a\r\ndying-down swell is what should be looked for in an impulse which had\r\ntravelled from the south northward, since the wave would affect the\r\nmore northern zones last, and less of a calm period would intervene\r\nbetween the two impulses from opposite poles.\r\n\r\nThe cartouches, then, state that the canals began to develop after the\r\ngreatest melting of the polar cap had occurred; that this development\r\nproceeded down the latitudes to the equator, and then not stopping\r\nthere advanced up the latitudes of the other hemisphere. In the next\r\nplace they show that in the arctic region the development was arrested\r\nand devolution or decay set in as it began to get cold there, the most\r\nnorthern canals being affected first. Finally, that a similar wave of\r\nevolution had occurred from the opposite pole some time before and had\r\nthen passed away. And this evidence of the cartouches is direct, and\r\nindependent of any theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                           CANAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n                        _Individually Instanced_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an interesting instance of the law of development we may take the\r\ncareer of the Brontes during this same Martian year; the Brontes\r\nwitnessing individually to the same evolutionary process that the\r\ncanals collectively exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe Brontes is one of the most imposing canals upon the planet. It is\r\nnot so much its length which renders it a striking object, though this\r\nlength is enough to entitle it to consideration, being no less than\r\n2440 miles. Its direction is what singles it out to notice, for it runs\r\nalmost north and south. For this reason it swings into a position to\r\nhold the centre of the stage for a time with the precision of a\r\nmeridian, as the planet’s rotation turns its longitude into view. The\r\npoints which it connects help also to add to its distinction. For the\r\nSinus Titanum at its southern end and the Propontis at its northern are\r\nboth among the conspicuous points of the disk. The latter is but twelve\r\ndegrees farther east than the former, while it is sixty-six degrees\r\nfarther north. This long distance,—from nearly the line of the tropics\r\nin the southern hemisphere to mid-temperate regions of the\r\nnorthern,—the canal runs in an absolutely straight course.\r\n\r\nIts north and south character commends it for any investigation of\r\ncanal development, since it runs in the general direction that\r\ndevelopment takes. Its great latitudinal stretch further fits it for a\r\nrecorder of changes sweeping down the disk; so that both in direction\r\nand length it stands well circumstanced for a measure of latitudinal\r\nvariations. The fact that it is usually a fairly conspicuous canal does\r\nnot detract from its virtue in this respect. It was first recognized at\r\nFlagstaff in 1894. But once realized, so to speak, it was possible to\r\nidentify it with a canal seen by Schiaparelli and supposed by him to be\r\nthe Titan; indeed, it played hide and seek with that canal throughout\r\nhis drawings. In 1894 both it and the Titan were so well seen that its\r\nseparate existence was unmistakable, causing it to be both recognized\r\nand named. It is, like the Titan, one of the sheaf of canals descending\r\nthe disk from the Sinus Titanum, and lies just to the east of the Titan\r\nin the bunch. In 1896 it was also prominent; and at both these\r\noppositions most so from its southern end, its northern one being more\r\nor less indefinite, especially in 1894.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 it was not the same. Instead of being the conspicuous canal it\r\nhad been in earlier years, it was now so faint as with difficulty to be\r\nmade out. It remained so to the close of observations. It was now under\r\nsuspicion. Its behavior in 1896-1897 had led to the supposition that\r\nnot only were seasonal changes taking place in it, but that those\r\nchanges were such as to point to a law in the case with which its\r\nconduct in 1901 fayed in. The suspicion did not, however, become a\r\ncertainty till the opposition of 1903. The length of time during which\r\nthe disk was then kept under scrutiny resulted in the method of its\r\nmetamorphosis being discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I. February 25.]\r\n\r\nAt the very start of observations its longitude chanced to be nearly\r\ncentral and it was made out; but so far off was the planet that only\r\nits northern part could be detected, because, as afterward appeared,\r\nthis part was the stronger, the canal being decidedly inconspicuous,\r\nwhereas other canals, the northern and even the Pallene and the Dis,\r\nwere strongly marked. At the next presentation the planet was nearer,\r\nand details previously hidden for the distance now came out. Among them\r\nwas the Brontes, which, showing better than in January, could be traced\r\nall the way to the Sinus Titanum. A drawing (I) made on February 25 and\r\nreproduced in the text shows its appearance at the time. Its emergence\r\nunder neared conditions only served to accentuate its relative\r\ninconspicuousness, for it showed now notably inferior to the northern\r\ncanals, and this not only in the matter of general visibility, but in\r\nthe character it displayed. It was a line of hazy definition,\r\ncontrasting thus with the sharp dark forms of its northern neighbors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II. March 30.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III. April 3.]\r\n\r\nAs the planet steadily approached the earth, and the canals to the\r\nnorth became better and better seen, the Brontes instead of sharing in\r\nthe general improvement did exactly the opposite. It grew less visible\r\nwhen it should have grown more so, if distance had been the cause of\r\nits appearance. It was now only to be seen at the north, even when it\r\nwas seen at all; a state of things exemplified in Drawings II and III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV. May 4.]\r\n\r\nAs the planet now went away and detail should have dimmed, the Brontes\r\nproceeded to do the opposite. One had almost said it was actuated by a\r\nspirit of contrariety. For now when it had reason to grow faint it grew\r\nin conspicuousness; just as, before, when it should have become\r\nevident, it had declined. Distinctly farther off and smaller as the\r\nplanet was at the next presentation, the Brontes had clearly developed\r\nboth in tone and in the amount of it visible. This was in May (Drawings\r\nIV and V). In June bad seeing prevented good observations, but in July,\r\nDrawing VI, when the region again came round, the Brontes, in spite of\r\nthe then greatly increased distance, asserted itself so strongly that\r\neven in not very good seeing its presence could not be passed by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V. May 7.]\r\n\r\nThis contrariety of behavior had about it one very telling feature.\r\nThat the canal waxed or waned in exact opposition to distance and even\r\ntoward the last to seeing too, showed conclusively that neither\r\ndistance nor definition could in any way be held responsible for its\r\nmetamorphoses. A very fortunate circumstance, this of the observations,\r\nfor it directly eliminated size of disk, phase, and seeing, for which\r\ncorrection are none too easy to make, and which in the minds of the\r\nsceptical could always remain as unexplained possibilities of error.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI. July 18.]\r\n\r\nThe mean-canal cartouches show synthetically, and all the more\r\nconclusively for being composite, the laws of the flux of the canals.\r\nSomething more of vividness, however, is imparted by the actual look of\r\none of the constituents during the process. It is the difference\r\nbetween seeing a composite picture made from a given group of men and\r\nthe gazing on the actual features of any one of them. So much is gained\r\nby the drawings across the page of the Brontes at different stages of\r\nits evolution during the period here concerned. But in another way,\r\ntoo, the one canal may be made to yield a more lifelike representation\r\nof the process than a number taken together are capable of affording.\r\nIn the mean-canal cartouches each canal is treated as an entity; but it\r\nis possible to consider a canal by parts, and by so doing to see it in\r\naction, as it were. It occurred to me to treat the Brontes in this way.\r\nFor this purpose I divided the canal into sections, five of them in\r\nall, between the point where it left the Propontis, at a spot called\r\nthe Propropontis, to where it ended in the Sinus Titanum. The first,\r\nthe most northern, extended as far as Semnon Lucus, the southernmost\r\noutpost of the Propontis congeries of spots. The second continued on\r\nfrom these to Eleon, the junction where the Erebus crossed. The third\r\nthence to Utopia, where the canal met the Orcus; the fourth to an\r\narbitrary point in latitude 8° south, and the fifth and last to the\r\nSinus Titanum. The lengths of these sections were respectively: 12°,\r\n16°, 15°, 12°, and 13°. Each of the sections was then treated as if it\r\nwere a separate canal and its cartouche found. To the cartouches’\r\ndetermination there were available drawings:\r\n\r\n  January 21-25          12 drawings.\r\n  February 23-March 2    15 drawings.\r\n  March 28-April 5       14 drawings.\r\n  April 26-May 8         27 drawings.\r\n  June 3-16               6 drawings.\r\n  July 11-21             16 drawings.\r\n                         -------------------\r\n                         90 drawings in all.\r\n\r\nThe cartouches are given in the plate opposite, which is constructed\r\nprecisely like the one for the mean canal cartouches presented on page\r\n298. The mid-latitude of the section and its mid-longitude are given in\r\nthe margin with its description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONTES\r\n\r\nShowing Successive Development South\r\n\r\n_January to July, 1903_\r\n\r\nP.L.]\r\n\r\nExamining them now we note a family resemblance between the successive\r\ncartouches. All sink slowly on the left to rise sharply from their\r\nlowest point to the right. Such resemblance betokens the action of one\r\nand the same cause.\r\n\r\nNext, although the curves are resemblant, each has been, as it were,\r\nsheered to the right as one reads down; that is, the action took place\r\nlater and later as the latitude was north.\r\n\r\nLastly, the dying out of a previous impulse can be traced in the\r\ncartouches, which shows that the canals were quickened six months\r\npreviously from the south polar cap, as they were now being quickened\r\nfrom the north polar one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                       HIBERNATION OF THE CANALS\r\n\r\n\r\nConnected with the conduct of the canals is a phenomenon, examples of\r\nwhich were early noted in a general way by Schiaparelli and later, but\r\nof which the full import and exhibition only came to light during the\r\nopposition of 1903 by a very striking metamorphosis: what may be called\r\nthe hibernation of a canal for a longer or shorter term of years. What\r\nobservation discloses is certainly curious. For several successive\r\noppositions a canal will be seen in a definite locality, as regular in\r\nseasonal recurrence as it is permanent in place, a well-recognized\r\nfeature of the disk. Then to one’s surprise, with the next return of\r\nthe planet, it will fail to appear, and will proceed to remain\r\nobliterate without assignable cause for many Martian years, until as\r\nunexpectedly it will be found what and where it was before. Neither to\r\ndeposition of hoar-frost, such as frequently whitens whole regions of\r\nMars, nor to other circumstances can be attributed its disappearance.\r\nWithout apparent reason it simply ceases to be and then as simply comes\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nSuch bopeep behavior is quite beyond and apart from the seasonal change\r\nin visibility, to which all the canals are by their nature subject. For\r\nbeing creatures of the semi-annual unlocking of the water congealed\r\nabout the polar caps, they quicken into growth and visibility, each in\r\nits season, and as regularly die out again. Different, however, is the\r\nphenomenon to which I now refer. In it not a seasonal but a secular\r\nchange is concerned. The season proper to the canal’s increase will\r\nrecur in due course, and the canals round about it will start to life,\r\nyet the canal remains unquickened. Nothing responds where in years the\r\nresponse was immediate and invariable. The canal lies dormant spite of\r\nseasonal solicitation to stir.\r\n\r\nSuch curious hibernation was early hinted to the keenness of\r\nSchiaparelli, and most incomprehensible as well as difficult of\r\nverification at that stage the phenomenon was. That the absence was a\r\nfact, however, he assured himself, although he was not able to prove an\r\nalibi. But at the last opposition an event of the sort occurred which,\r\nfrom the length of time the planet was kept under observation, combined\r\nwith continued suitableness of the seeing, unmasked the process. In the\r\nlight of what then happened, taken in connection with the side-lights\r\nthrown upon it by the canal’s past and by the knowledge we have\r\nmeanwhile gained of the planet’s physical condition, the riddle of the\r\nphenomenon may in part at least be read, and most interesting and\r\ninstructive the reading proves to be.\r\n\r\nAmong the initial canals detected by Schiaparelli, in 1877, was a\r\ntricrural set of lines recalling the heraldic design of three flexed\r\nlegs joined equiangularly above the knees. It lay to the east of the\r\nSyrtis Major, and he called its three members the Thoth, the Triton,\r\nand the Nepenthes. Starting from the head of his gulf of Alcyonius, at\r\na point now known to be occupied by the oasis called Aquae Calidae, the\r\nThoth started south inclining westward as it went, till in longitude\r\n267° and latitude 15° north, it met the Triton, which had come from the\r\nSyrtis Minor with similar westward inclination. To the same point in\r\nthe same manner came the Nepenthes. Part way along the course of the\r\nlatter was to be seen a small dark spot, the Lucus Moeris, which he\r\nestimated at four degrees in diameter. Some of the markings were easier\r\nthan others, the easiest of all being the Lucus Tritonis, a largish\r\ndark spot at the common intersection of all three canals; but that none\r\nof the markings were remarkably difficult is sufficiently shown by\r\ntheir detection at this early stage of Schiaparelli’s observations. It\r\nis worth noting also that he discovered the southern ones first; the\r\nThoth not being seen till March, 1878. As his then recognition of these\r\ncanals witnesses, they must have been among the most evident on the\r\ndisk. And the point is emphasized by the fact that he failed at this\r\nopposition to detect the Phison and the Euphrates as separate markings.\r\n\r\nMuch the same the three canals appeared to him at the next opposition\r\nof 1879, the Thoth being seen at its several presentations from October\r\n5, 1879, to January 11, 1880.\r\n\r\nAt the next opposition a noteworthy alteration occurred, the full\r\nsignificance of which escaped recognition. Schiaparelli saw, at the\r\nplace where the Thoth had been, two lines which he took for a\r\ngemination of that canal, one of which followed the course of the old\r\nThoth, while the other went straight from the Sinus Alcyonius to the\r\nLittle Syrtis, or, more precisely, to the junction of the Triton and\r\nthe Lethes. It was not the Thoth, however, but something unsuspected,\r\nof more importance.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the Thoth showed really double, the western line being much the\r\nstronger, “una delle piu grosse linee que si vedessero sul disco.” That\r\nneither branch went farther than the meeting-place with the Nepenthes\r\nargues that it was indeed the Thoth that was seen. Schiaparelli himself\r\nhad no doubt on the subject, although he drew the double canal he saw\r\ndue north and south from the tip of the Sinus Alcyonius to the\r\njunction, but nevertheless along the 263° meridian.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 and 1888 the system was in all essentials, what it had been in\r\n1877 and 1879, except that the Thoth and Nepenthes were double and were\r\nmore minutely seen.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a system of canals and spots which for six Martian\r\nyears had been a persistent and substantially invariable feature of the\r\nMartian surface. Any changes in it had been of a secondary order of\r\nimportance, while its general visibility was of the first. It is\r\npossible, then, to judge of my perplexity when in beginning my\r\nobservations in 1894 no sign of the system could I detect. Of neither\r\nthe Thoth, the Triton, the Nepenthes, nor the Lucus Moeris was there\r\ntrace. And yet, from the other canals visible, it was evident that the\r\ndisk was quite as well seen as it had been by Schiaparelli. Not only\r\nwere practically all his canals there, but many much smaller ones were\r\nto be made out. And the same was true of the spots, a host of such not\r\nfigured by him appearing here and there over the planet’s surface.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. Instead of the Thoth, another canal showed straight\r\ndown the disk from the Syrtis Minor to the Aquae Calidae. This canal\r\nwas as unmistakable as the Thoth had been before to Schiaparelli. It\r\nwas among the first to be detected, and continued no less conspicuous\r\nto the end, the dates at which it was seen being July 10, August 14,\r\nand October 21. I called it the Amenthes, identifying it with the canal\r\nso named in Schiaparelli’s chart published in _Himmel und Erde_, of the\r\n_ensemble_ of his observations from 1877 to 1888. But in his Memoirs he\r\nnever called it so, seeing it, indeed, only in 1881-1882, and deeming\r\nit then the Thoth. Nevertheless, in 1894, it was the conspicuous canal\r\nof the region, and, what is more, had come, as it proved, to stay.\r\n\r\nThe invisibility of the Thoth continued for me the same during the\r\nsucceeding oppositions of 1896-1897 and 1901. At the former opposition\r\nI drew it in 1896 on July 28, August 26, September 2, October 5-9,\r\nseeing it single; and in 1897 on January 12-19, February 21, and March\r\n1. It was single but with suspicions of doubling in January, and was\r\nindubitably double in February. As for the Thoth, I had come to\r\nconsider it and the Amenthes one, attributing their diversity of\r\ndepiction to errors in drawing. For while the Thoth remained\r\nobstinately invisible, the Amenthes presented itself as substitute so\r\ninsistently as to make one of the most obvious canals upon the disk.\r\n\r\nOne exception only was there to this state of things. On June 16, 1901,\r\nmy notes contain this adumbration of a something else: “Amenthes\r\nsometimes appeared with a turn to it two-thirds way up; two canals\r\nconcave to the Syrtis Major.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amenthes alone in February.]\r\n\r\nSo matters opened at the opposition of 1903. With the advent of the\r\nplanet and the presentation in due course of Libya in February, the\r\nAmenthes duly appeared, much as it had showed at the opposition before,\r\nonly less salient. It was a confused and seemingly narrower double.\r\nSuspected on the 16th of that month, it was definitely seen from the\r\n18th to the 23d. Of the Thoth no mention is made either in the notes or\r\nin the drawings. When the region came round again, in March, the\r\nAmenthes was still there, showing more feebly, however, than it had in\r\nFebruary, in spite of better seeing and the fact that the planet had\r\nconsiderably neared. Clearly the canal was fading out; a fact further\r\nwitnessed to by the following note made on March 25: “Throughout this\r\nopposition thus far the dark triangle tipped by Aquae Calidae has been\r\nsharply divided in intensity from the Amenthes, which is very narrow\r\nand exceedingly faint.” Still was there no trace of the Thoth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amenthes feebler and still alone in March.]\r\n\r\nWith the April presentation entered a new order of things. When the\r\nregion first became visible, on the 16th, the Amenthes could still be\r\nseen and alone; but on the 19th, as the relative falling back of the\r\nMartian longitudes swung the region nearer the centre of the disk, the\r\nThoth appeared alongside of it. On the 20th the Thoth showed alone.\r\nUnmistakable it was and just as Schiaparelli had drawn it, accompanied\r\nby the Triton and the curved Nepenthes. The thing was a revelation.\r\nWhat before I had seen only in the spirit of another’s drawings stood\r\nthere patent to me in the body of my own; while the Amenthes, to which\r\nI had so long been accustomed, had vanished into thin air. Only a trace\r\nof it was now and then to be made out. So startlingly strange was the\r\nmetamorphosis that I could not at first trust my eyes, and questioned\r\nthe broken line, which had replaced the straight, for some ocular\r\ndeception. But nothing I could do would rectify it. The Amenthes was\r\ngone and the Thoth stood in its stead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Appearance of Thoth with Triton and curved Nepenthes.\r\nAmenthes vanished. April 20.]\r\n\r\nAt the next presentation, May 26 to June 8, the phenomena were\r\nrepeated, and with increasing clarity. And then of a sudden, on May 29,\r\nI saw the long-given-up Lucus Moeris. There it was indubitably. And its\r\ndefiniteness was the most astonishing part of the affair. It was no\r\nquestion of difficult detection. Indeed, I had not been on the lookout\r\nfor it, having searched the region too often fruitlessly before to have\r\nleft incentive to search again. And so, when I was not searching, the\r\nthing of its own accord stepped forth to sight. It was a small round\r\ndot, like to any other oasis, and showed, as it were, a black pearl\r\npendent by the Nepenthes from the Syrtis’s ear. For the Libyan bay made\r\na dark projection of the sort high up on the Syrtis’s eastern side,\r\nfrom which the Nepenthes, precisely as Schiaparelli had drawn it,\r\ncurved down to the point where the Thoth and Triton met. All three\r\ncanals were geminated, the gemination being about three degrees wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Advent of the Lucus Moeris. May 29.]\r\n\r\nAnd now occurred the last act in the drama. In July the Amenthes\r\nreappeared, showing alongside of the Thoth-Nepenthes, and thus removing\r\nany possible doubt as to their separate identity. It had, indeed,\r\nbecome the stronger of the two, having gained in strength in the\r\ninterval between June and July and the Thoth-Nepenthes having lost. The\r\nlines were in process of relapsing into the _status quo ante_. Had\r\nthese three presentations not been watched, the brief apparition of the\r\nThoth-Nepenthes had been missed and with it the revealing of its\r\ncurious character, and of certain deductions thereupon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amenthes with Thoth-Nepenthes. July.]\r\n\r\nFirst among these is a truth of which I have long been convinced; to\r\nwit, that when a seeming discordance arises between the portrayals of a\r\ncanal, it is commonly not a case of mistake nor of change, but one of\r\nseparate identity. The canal has not shifted its place, nor has an\r\nerror been committed; the fact is that one canal has been observed at\r\none time, another at another.\r\n\r\nSo it was here, and thus were the old and the new observations\r\nreconciled. There had been no mistake in either. Two separate canals\r\naccounted for the discrepancy, and only an unfounded distrust of the\r\naccuracy possible in such observations was to blame for any failure to\r\nrecognize the fact.\r\n\r\nNow, scrutiny of the notes upon the appearance of the two canals,\r\ntogether with their labeling by the seasonal longitudes of the planet\r\nat the dates they were made, discloses a curious relation between the\r\ntwo. The seasonal longitudes are important, as they date the phenomena\r\naccording to the Martian calendar. Ordered thus, the successive aspects\r\nreveal first a seasonal change in each canal and then over and above\r\nthis a secular one. And this secular change was such as to cause the\r\ntwo canals to alternate in visibility. When the one was present the\r\nother was not, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCARTOUCHES\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nCURVES OF VISIBILITY\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nAMENTHES, THOTH AND THEIR COMBINATION.]\r\n\r\nWe shall see this more clearly and at the same time bring out a curious\r\nrelation between the two systems, the broken bow of the\r\nThoth-Nepenthes-Triton and the straight arrow of the Amenthes, while\r\nlooking at the cartouches of the Thoth, the Amenthes, and a combination\r\nof both given in the plate on previous page.\r\n\r\nThe antithetical character of the two canals is apparent. But what is\r\nfurther interesting, the combination cartouche of both bears a singular\r\nresemblance to that of the mean canal of the north tropic zone, the\r\nzone to which both canals belong. Here, then, is a combination which is\r\nperfectly regular while each of its constituents is anomalous.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to something as important: at the opposition of 1905\r\nthe curious alternation metamorphosis was enacted anew. The Amenthes\r\nappeared, disappeared to be replaced by the Thoth, and then reappeared\r\nagain beside the other. This corroboration of behavior showed the\r\nprevious observations to have been due to no mistake, and only served\r\nto deepen the interest in this last and more singular phase of canal\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                     ARCTIC CANALS AND POLAR RIFTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLast in time but not least in importance of the details of canal\r\ndevelopment to be detected is one that connects these strange features\r\ndirectly with the melting of the polar caps. The cartouches showed that\r\nsuch connection was to be inferred; the facts now to be recorded depict\r\nit by an identity of place between certain phenomena of the two\r\nsubjects following one another in order of time.\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1897, while scanning the planet, I was suddenly ware of a\r\nrift in the north polar cap. It ran a little to the west of south from\r\nwhere it started in at the cap’s edge and went clean through to the\r\nlimb, the pole being then slightly tilted away from us. At the time it\r\nseemed to be the first rift ever seen in that cap; but on opening a\r\nlittle later Schiaparelli’s _Memoria Quarta_, which had just arrived,\r\nthe first thing my eye fell on was a drawing of a rift in the north\r\npolar cap observed by him when the planet had held the like attitude\r\ntoward the Earth thirteen years before. Reference to its longitude\r\nshowed it to be the identical rift, seen again after all these years\r\nand the only one so far seen in the northern cap.\r\n\r\nAt the next opposition more rifts were detected, one in especial on\r\nDecember 27, running from Arethusa Lucus, then upon the edge of the\r\ncap, athwart the snow in a northwesterly direction.\r\n\r\nIn the forepart of the opposition of 1901, which in its Martian season\r\ncorresponded to that in 1897, when the rift had been observed, many\r\nrifts were detected in the cap, and among them one traversing the cap\r\nnorth-northeasterly in longitude 136°.\r\n\r\nSo far the season when the cap had been observed was that when the\r\nrifts were in process of forming. The ground they and the snow-cap\r\ncovered had not yet at any opposition been uncovered.\r\n\r\nIt was only when my observations began in the latter half of the\r\nopposition of 1901 that, the season on Mars having so far advanced, all\r\nsnow in those latitudes had melted. Then appeared, however, the canal\r\nHippalus, an arctic canal of some importance, lying on that part of the\r\nplanet previously occupied by the polar cap. When later studying the\r\nobservations on the rifts I remembered this canal, and turning to the\r\ndrawing made some months before to compare the two critically,\r\ndiscovered that the canal occupied the precise position held earlier by\r\nthe rift. One had said the rift had never vanished, but that the white\r\nsurrounding it had simply turned to ochre. Here, then, was a striking\r\ncoincidence of place, too exact to be the result of chance.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the identity, I examined all the other rifts seen early in\r\n1901, comparing them with the arctic canals seen later, to the finding\r\nof no less than five cases of the same coinciding positions.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the identification here made of an arctic canal with\r\na previous rift in the polar cap has led me to make a list of the\r\ncanals thus identified at this opposition.\r\n\r\n ==========+===========================+=============================\r\n           |    VISIBLE AS A RIFT      |   VISIBLE AS A CANAL\r\n ----------+---------------------------+-----------------------------\r\n Hypanis   | January 1 and February 4  | April 18 (?), May 20, 22,\r\n           |                           |   27, June 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 25\r\n Hippalus  | January 19 and February 4 | April 18, May 27\r\n Rhombites | February 4                | May 27\r\n Python    | February 20               | March 31\r\n Zygatis   | January 18, 19            | May 7, June 3 to 8\r\n ==========+===========================+=============================\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why these canals do not appear recorded at the March\r\npresentation as either the one phenomenon or the other, the answer is\r\ntwofold. First, because they showed as shadings lost amidst a shaded\r\nmass; and, secondly, the observations at several oppositions indicate a\r\ngreat amount of haze over the region at that season of the Martian year.\r\n\r\nWe may now go back to the very first rift, that of 1897. The Martian\r\nseason grew later with each succeeding opposition, and it so chanced,\r\nabetted by this fact, that the delaying snow was never seen covering\r\nthat part of the planet again and so, of course, not the rift. The\r\nMartian summer in those high latitudes came on, and with it brought the\r\ngreat arctic canal, the Jaxartes, into conspicuousness. The canal in\r\nconsequence had been observed for some time before it proclaimed itself\r\nthe apotheosis of a rift and that of the first and most important rift\r\nof all. Comparison of position, however, entirely confirmed the\r\nconjecture and added another and the most striking of all to the list.\r\n\r\nThese six canals, on the whole the largest which run into the northern\r\ncap, have thus a dual character. Starting originally as rifts, they\r\nlater come out unmistakably as canals. So that we may say in general\r\nthat the two phenomena are different seasonal states of the same thing.\r\nThis instantly explains the rifts, the origin of which we found of so\r\ndifficult, not to say impossible, interpretation before in these pages,\r\nand incidentally it confirms what we deduced on other grounds as the\r\ncharacter of the canals; to wit, strips of vegetation. For if the cap\r\ncovered desert and fertility alike, it is precisely over the latter\r\nthat it would first melt.\r\n\r\nVegetation has the property of melting snow. The metabolism of the\r\nplant, like that of the animal, though in a less degree, generates\r\ncaloric. A living animal is warm, even the so-called cold-blooded ones,\r\nin some sort, and a growing plant is too. The chemic processes\r\nconcerned give off heat, though in such small quantities that we are\r\noften not aware of it. While the plant lies dormant it stays cold, but\r\nthe moment its sap begins to run under the rays of the spring sun it\r\nrises in temperature above its winter surroundings. All it needs to\r\nthis awakening is sun and water, and both it gets in its place in the\r\npolar cap after the passing of the vernal equinox. The time, therefore,\r\nis suitable, for it is not till after that equinox is passed that any\r\nof the above phenomena occur. In consequence the snow about it melts\r\nand the plants themselves show as dark rifts splitting the cap.\r\n\r\nThis quite unexpected identity of two seemingly diverse phenomena, and\r\nthe unsolicited support its only explanation lends to the general\r\ntheory, is an instance of what is constantly occurring as observation\r\nof the planet is pushed farther and farther. Facts every little while\r\narise which prove to fit into place in the scheme when neither the\r\nfacts nor their fitness could have been foreseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                            OASES: KINEMATIC\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject to change also are the oases; and in the same manner apparently\r\nas the canals. They grow less evident at a like season of the Martian\r\nyear. They do this seemingly by decreasing in size. Whereas in the full\r\nexpanse of their maturity they show as round spots of appreciable\r\ndiameter, as the season wanes they contract to the smallest discernible\r\nof dots. All but the kernel, as it were, fades out, and even this may\r\ndisappear from sight. The Phœnix Lake in its summer time is a very dark\r\ncircular spot, small indeed yet of definite extension; in its winter it\r\nshrinks to a pin point, and is often not visible at all. Sometimes the\r\nhusk apparently persists, a ghostlike reminiscence of what it was, with\r\nthe kernel showing dark-pointed in its centre. Thus the Lucus Lunae\r\nappeared at the opposition of 1905. A faint wash betokened the presence\r\nof the Lucus, through which now and again a black pin-point pierced.\r\n\r\nIn this visible decrease of size we get a revelation as to what takes\r\nplace impossible in the case of the canals, the tenuous character of\r\nwhich precludes more than inference as to the process.\r\n\r\nLike the canals, latitude, together with the suitable season of the\r\nplanet’s year, are the determining factors in their development. In\r\nwhat corresponded to our July of the northern hemisphere the oases in\r\nthe sub-arctic and north temperate zones were conspicuous; black spots\r\nthat showed in profusion along the parallels of 40°, 50°, and 60°\r\nnorth. At the same time the equatorial ones, those along the\r\nEumenides-Orcus, which had been most evident in 1894, hardly came out.\r\nIt had been their time then as it was that of the others now. The law\r\nof development is not so simple as on the earth, depending, like that\r\nof the canals, not only upon the return of the sun, but upon the advent\r\nof the water let loose from about the polar caps. Thus the equatorial\r\noases are subject to two seasonal quickenings, one from the north, the\r\nother from the south.\r\n\r\nIn regard to their method of evolution or devolution a most curious\r\nobservation happened to me in 1903. Usually the oases are of solid tone\r\nthroughout; equally sombre from centre to circumference. But in this\r\ncase such uniform complexion found exception. On March 1, 1903, the\r\nAscraeus Lucus came out strangely differentiated, a dark rim inclosing\r\na less dark kernel. The sight was odd enough to command comment in the\r\nshape of a sketch which accompanied the note, and the further remark\r\nthat other spots had similarly that year affected the like look. That\r\nthe effect was optical did not seem to me the case. Other spots at\r\nother times showed nothing of the sort. If it was due to objective\r\ncause it gathers circumstance from what was then the Martian time of\r\nyear. For the season was such that the spot should then have been in\r\nprocess of waning; and the effect would indicate that in so doing the\r\ntone of the centre went first, that of the circumference fading last.\r\nThis would be in accordance with a growth proceeding outward and a\r\ndecay that followed in its steps.\r\n\r\nWhen to this we add the look of the oases at the antithetic\r\nseason,—often a faint shading only, with or without a darker pin-point\r\nat its core,—we are led to the belief that the area of the oasis is\r\nunchangeable and that its growth means a deepening of tint.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, as it is possible to particularize them, the oases\r\ndevelop from a small nucleus, perhaps twenty miles in diameter, perhaps\r\nless, and from this spread radially till they attain a width of\r\nseventy-five or one hundred miles. If the oasis be associated with a\r\ndouble canal, this maximum width exactly fits the space between the\r\ntwin lines. Even when no double enters the oasis, the size is about the\r\nsame. This size attained, they hold it for some months. Then they\r\nproceed to fade out to their initial nucleus, and after a sufficient\r\nrest the process starts over again.\r\n\r\nWith the carets something of the same sort seems to take place—if we\r\nmay consider as betokening a general law the fact that in 1894 the\r\ncarets at the mouths of the Phison and Euphrates developed before their\r\naffiliated canals. But about them much less is yet known, and we must\r\nbe content to say that the observations of 1905 made at the opposite\r\nseason of the canal’s year seem to bear this out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART IV\r\n\r\n                              EXPLANATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                  CONSTITUTION OF THE CANALS AND OASES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs rational science does not rest content with raw results, it now\r\nbecomes obligatory, by marshaling the facts to suitable discussion, to\r\nseek to find out what they mean. Now, so soon as we scan these\r\nphenomena for some self-interpretation, we perceive one characteristic\r\nof the lines which at once appears to direct us to their nature and\r\njustifies itself as a signpost with increasing certainty as we read on.\r\nThis trait is the very simple yet most significant one of showing\r\nintrinsic change: the lines alter in visibility with time. This primary\r\nproclivity we do not even need the cartouches to establish. That the\r\nlines change is palpable to any one who will watch them long enough.\r\nSchiaparelli was struck by the fact early in his study of the planet,\r\nand it forces itself on the notice of any careful observer who compares\r\nhis own observations with one another at intervals. But though the\r\ncartouches are not needed to a first revelation of mutability, they\r\nserve to certify and precise it to much further information on the\r\nsubject. For, that these changes are not extrinsic, that is, are not\r\ncaused by varying definition, distance, or illumination, they make\r\npatent even to those who have never seen the things themselves by\r\ndisclosing respective differences of behavior in lines similarly\r\ncircumstanced optically. The change is therefore intrinsic, and the\r\nquestion arises to what can such intrinsic change be due.\r\n\r\nIn searching for cause, attention is at once attracted by another\r\nseries of transmutations that manifests itself upon the disk, in the\r\norderly melting of the polar caps. For the existence of the two sets of\r\nmetamorphoses suggests the possibility of a connection between them.\r\nThe inference is strengthened when we note that not only are both\r\nperiodic, but that furthermore the period of the two is the same. Each\r\npolar cap runs through its gamut of change in a Martian year; the\r\ncanals also complete their cycle of growth and decay in a Martian\r\ntwelvemonth. The only difference between the two is that each polar cap\r\nhas but one maximum and one minimum in the course of this time, while\r\nmost of the canals have two of each, though the maxima are not alike\r\nnor the minima either.\r\n\r\nNot only is the period of the two series of changes the same, but the\r\none follows the other. For the development of the canals does not begin\r\ntill the melting of the polar cap is well under way. Now, as the polar\r\ncap disintegrates it gives rise, as we have seen, to a dark belt of\r\nblue-green which fringes its outer edge and retreats with it as it\r\nshrinks. This tells, directly or indirectly, of a product let loose.\r\nAfter this belt has been formed the canals nearest to it proceed to\r\ndarken, then those a little farther off follow suit, and so the wave of\r\nvisibility rolls in regular routine down the disk. Here, then, at the\r\noutset we have a chronic connection between the two phenomena, the\r\ndisintegration of the cap and the integration of the canals.\r\n\r\nOf water we saw that the caps were undoubtedly composed, and to water,\r\nthen, let loose by the melting of the cap, we may inferably ascribe the\r\nthaumaturgy in the development of the canals. But it is not necessary\r\nto suppose that this is done directly. That the increased visibility of\r\nthe canals can be due to a bodily transference of water seems doubtful,\r\nif for no other reason than the delay in the action. Considerable time\r\nintervenes between the disappearance of the cap and the appearance of\r\nthe canals, except in the case of such as have been covered by it.\r\nTransformation consequent upon transference, however, would account for\r\nhesitancy. A quickening to vegetal growth would produce the counterpart\r\nof what we see. If, set free from the winter locking up, the water\r\naccumulated in the cap then percolated equatorward, starting vegetation\r\nin its course, this would cause the increased visibility of the canals\r\nand at the same time explain the seeming delay, by allowing for the\r\ntime necessary for this vegetation to sprout. This is certainly the\r\nmost satisfactory explanation of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nThus started, the vegetal quickening would pass down the planet’s\r\nsurface and give rise to what we mark as seasonal change. But, though\r\nin one sense of seasonal character, a little consideration will show\r\nthat it would be quite unlike the seasonal change which we know on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nCould we see our earth from some standpoint in space, we should mark,\r\nwith the advent of spring, a wave of verdure sweep over its face. If\r\nfreedom from cloud permitted of an unimpeded view, this flush of waking\r\nfrom winter’s sleep would be quite evident and could be seen to spread.\r\nStarting from the equator so soon as the sun turned north, it, too,\r\nwould travel northward, and, distancing the sun, arrive by midsummer\r\nwell into the arctic zone. Here, then, we should note, much as we note\r\nit on Mars, a tint of blue-green superpose itself successively upon the\r\nochre ground; but the mundane and the Martian vegetal awakening would\r\ndiffer in one fundamental respect; the earthly wave would be seen to\r\ntravel from equator to pole, while the Arian travels from pole to\r\nequator. Though clearly seasonal in character, both of them, the\r\ntransformations would be opposite in action. Some other cause, then,\r\nmust be at work from what we are familiar with on earth. This other\r\ncause is the presence or absence of moisture.\r\n\r\nTwo factors are necessary to the begetting of vegetal life, the raw\r\nmaterial and the reacting agent. Oxygen, nitrogen, water, and a few\r\nsalts make up the first desideratum, the sun supplies the second.\r\nUnless both be present, the quickening to life never comes. Now, the\r\none may be there and the other not, or the other there and the one not.\r\nOn earth the material including water is, except in certain destitute\r\nlocalities, always present; the sun it is that periodically withdraws.\r\nObservant upon the return of the sun is therefore the annual recurrence\r\nof vegetal growth.\r\n\r\nOn Mars, on the contrary, water is lacking. This we now know\r\nconclusively from other phenomena the disk presents which have no\r\nconnection with the present investigation and are, therefore,\r\nunprejudiced witnesses to the fact. No permanent bodies of water stud\r\nits surface. That the so-called seas are traversed by dark lines\r\npermanent in place is one of several proofs of this. The only surface\r\nwater the planet knows comes from the melting of its polar caps.\r\nVegetation cannot start until this water reaches it. Consequently,\r\nthough the sun be ready, vegetation must wait upon the coming of the\r\nwater, and starting from near the pole follow the frugal flood\r\nequatorward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHENOLOGY CURVES—EARTH.\r\n\r\n* = Dead Point of Vegetation.\r\n\r\n(From paper in _Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc._, by Percival Lowell.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHENOLOGY CURVES—MARS.\r\n\r\n* = Dead Point of Vegetation.\r\n\r\n(From paper in _Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc._, by Percival Lowell.)]\r\n\r\nNow, such contrariety of progression to what we should observe in the\r\ncase of the earth could we view it from afar is exactly what the curves\r\nof visibility of the canals exhibit. Timed primarily, not to the return\r\nof the sun but to the advent of the water, vegetal quickening there\r\nfollows, not the former up the latitudes but the latter down the disk.\r\nFor better understanding, the two curves of phenological quickening,\r\nthe mundane and the Martian, are shown in the diagrams. The plates\r\nrepresent the surfaces of the two planets, that of the earth being\r\nshown upside down with south at the top so as to agree with the\r\ntelescopic depiction of the topography of Mars. The stars mark the\r\nepoch of the dead-point of vegetation at successive latitudes; the time\r\nincreasing toward the right. The curves, it will be noticed, are bowed\r\nin opposite ways. The bowed effect is due in part to Mercator’s\r\nprojection; in part it may represent a real decrease in speed with\r\ntime. But what is strikingly noticeable is the opposite character of\r\nthe advance to the right, the one curve running up the disk, the other\r\ndown it. This shows that the development of vegetation proceeded in\r\nopposite directions over the surface.\r\n\r\nThus is the opposed action upon the two planets accounted for, and we\r\nare led to the conclusion that the canals are strips of vegetation fed\r\nby water from the polar caps, and that the floral seasons there as\r\naffecting the canals are conditioned, not as they would be with us,\r\ndirectly upon the return of the sun, but indirectly so through its\r\ndirect effect upon the polar snows.\r\n\r\nOnce adventured on the idea of vegetation, we find that it explains\r\nmuch more than the time taken by the wave of canal-development down the\r\ndisk. It accounts at once for the behavior of the canals in the three\r\nnorthern zones: the polar, arctic, and sub-arctic. The mean cartouches\r\nof these three zones dip down at their latter end instead of rising\r\nthere, as is the case with the cartouches of the mean canals farther\r\nsouth. This dip denotes that the most northern canals were waning\r\nalready by the middle of their August, though the others showed no such\r\ntendency; while the date of the deposition of the frost in these\r\nnorthern latitudes shows that they were started upon their course\r\ntoward extinction before the snow itself had covered them. In other\r\nwords, they were not obliterated but snuffed out. That their decline\r\nwas thus preparatory to the coming of the first snowfall or frost-fall,\r\nsufficiently severe to whiten the ground so that it did not melt the\r\nnext day, is suggestive of their constitution. It is clear that they\r\nwere not abruptly cut off by the frost, but were timed by nature to\r\nsuch extinction. Vegetation would behave in just this way, since\r\nevolution would accommodate the career of a plant to its environment.\r\n\r\nThe first question to present itself chronologically in the canals’\r\nannual history is connected with the size of the cap. Unfortunately for\r\nthe simplicity of the phenomena, the cap is not an extensionless source\r\nof flow, but an extended surface melting from the outer edge in. It\r\nwould seem, therefore, that water liberated from the outer parts should\r\nhave an effect before the main body of it were ready to begin its\r\ngeneral march down the disk. There should be, one would think, at least\r\na partial action, locally, before the main action got under way. Now,\r\nthere are certain canals that show cartouches increasing apparently\r\nfrom the time observations began, and the most pronounced is the\r\nJaxartes, which lies of all the canals observed the farthest north.\r\nNow, the cartouches were founded on canals quickened from the north\r\npolar cap. The farther north the canal, therefore, the greater the\r\nlikelihood of its showing the phenomena.\r\n\r\nThat we note such canals is therefore not only not subversive, but\r\nactually corroboratory, of the law it seems at first to shake. That all\r\nthe canals of these zones do not show a like cartouche-profile is not\r\nnecessary, a part of them being dependent, not upon the earlier, but\r\nupon the later liberated flow, and thus partaking in the general law,\r\nwhich grows uniform lower down the latitudes.\r\n\r\nAs the action from one polar cap proceeds, not only down to the\r\nequator, but across it into the planet’s other hemisphere, it appears\r\nthat much, at least, of the surface of Mars has two seasons of vegetal\r\ngrowth, the one quickened of the north polar cap, the other of the\r\nsouthern. How far the polar spheres of action overlap it is not\r\npossible at present to affirm, as the canals at this opposition were\r\nonly visible to 35° south latitude. That the north polar quickening\r\ngoes down so far is vouched for, and it is probable from other observed\r\nphenomena that it goes farther.\r\n\r\nThe alternate semi-annual quickening also discloses itself directly in\r\nthe cartouches; the previous semestral growth from the south polar cap\r\nactually showing in them before the impulse from the north began. The\r\nslow falling of their curves to the minimum preceding their later rise\r\nis nothing less than the dying out of the effect started six months\r\nbefore from the south. The gentler gradient of their fall proclaims a\r\ngradual lapse, just as the subsequent sharper rise points to the advent\r\nof a fresh impulse. And this deduction seems to be borne out by another\r\ncircumstance. There is some evidence of decrease in the pre-minimal\r\ngradient southward. This is telling testimony to the source whence the\r\nimpulse came. For if it originated at the south and traveled northward,\r\nthe southern canals would be the first to be affected and the first to\r\ndie out, and thus show a longer dead season, exhibited in the\r\ncartouches as a more level stretch.\r\n\r\nLastly, the explanation of the canals as threads of vegetation fays in\r\nwith the one which has been found to meet the requirements of the\r\nblue-green areas; while the fact that they prove to develop as they do,\r\nreversely to what would take place on earth, is exactly what all we\r\nhave latterly learnt about the surface conditions of the planet would\r\nlead us to expect.\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been said we see that the latest observations at\r\nFlagstaff confirm the earlier ones, and, what is especially\r\ncorroborative, they do so along another line. The former were chiefly\r\nstatic, the latter kinematic. In other words, the behavior of the\r\ncanals in action bears out the testimony of their appearance at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                                  LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy of the fundamental features of Martian topography has disclosed,\r\nas we have seen, the existence of vegetation on the planet as the only\r\nrational explanation of the dark markings there, considered not simply\r\non the score of their appearance momentarily, but judged by the changes\r\nthat appearance undergoes at successive seasons of the Martian year.\r\nThus we are assured that plant life exists on the planet. We are made\r\naware of the fact in more ways than one, but most unanswerably for that\r\ntrait to which vegetation owes its very name,—its periodic quickening\r\nto life. Thus the characteristic which has seemed here most distinctive\r\nof this phase of the organic, so that man even christened it in\r\naccordance, has proved equally telltale there.\r\n\r\nImportant as a conclusion this is no less pregnant as a premise. For\r\nthe assurance that plant life exists on Mars leads to a further step in\r\nextramundane acquaintance of far-reaching import. It introduces us at\r\nonce to the probability of life there of a higher and more immediately\r\nappealing kind, not with the vagueness of general analogy, but with the\r\ndefiniteness of specific deduction. For the presence of a flora is\r\nitself ground for suspecting a fauna.\r\n\r\nOf a bond connecting the two we get our first hint the moment we look\r\ninquiringly into the world about us, that of our own earth. Common\r\nexperience witnesses to a coexistence which grows curious and\r\ncompelling as we consider it. For it is not confined to life of any\r\nspecial order, but extends through the whole range of organisms of both\r\nkinds from the lowest to the highest. Algæ and monera, orchid and\r\nmammal, occur side by side and with a certain considerate poverty or\r\nrichness, as the case may be. Luxuriance in the one is matched by\r\nabundance in the other; while a scanty flora means a poor fauna. This\r\nof which we have been aware in regions round about us from childhood\r\ngrows in universality as we explore. Wherever man penetrates out of his\r\nproper sphere he finds the same dual possession of the land or the sea,\r\nand a similar curtailing or expanding of both tenantries together. No\r\nmountain top so cold but that if it grow plants, it supports insects\r\nand animals, too, after its kind; no desert so arid but that creeping\r\nthings find it as possible a habitat as life that does not stir. Even\r\nin almost boiling geysers animalcula and confervæ share and share\r\nalike. Only where extreme conditions preclude the one do they equally\r\ndebar the other.\r\n\r\nProceeding now from the fact to its factors we perceive reasons for\r\nthis tenure in common of the land by the vegetal and animal kingdoms.\r\nExamination proves the two great divisions of the organic to be\r\ninextricably connected. It strikes our notice first in the relation of\r\nplants to animals. It is of everyday notoriety that animals eat plants,\r\nthough it is less universally understood that in the ultimate they\r\nexist on nothing else. Plants furnish the food of animals; not as a\r\nmatter of partial preference but of fundamental necessity. For the\r\nplant is the indispensable intermediary in the process of metabolism.\r\nWithout plants animals would soon cease to exist, since they are unable\r\nto manufacture their own plasm out of the raw material offered by\r\ninorganic nature. They must make it out of the already prepared plasm\r\nof plants or out of other animals who have made it from plants. So that\r\nin the end it all comes back to plant production. The plant is able to\r\nbuild its plasm out of chemical substances; the animal cannot, except\r\nin the case of the nitro-bacteria, begin thus at the lowest rung of the\r\nalimentary ladder.\r\n\r\nBut the converse of this dependence is also largely true. Plants are\r\nbeholden to animals for processes that in return make their own life\r\npossible. The latter minister to the former with unconscious service\r\nall the time, and with no more arrogant independence than do our\r\ndomestics generally nowadays. The inconspicuous earthworm is the\r\nfieldhand of nature’s crops, who gets his own living by making theirs.\r\nWithout this day and night laborer the soil for want of stirring had\r\nremained less capable of grass. Above ground it is the same story.\r\nDeprived of the ministrations of insects many kinds of plants would\r\nincontinently perish. By the solicited visits of bees and other\r\nhymenoptera—what generically may be classed by the layman as\r\nflutter-bys—is the plant’s propagation made possible. Peculiarly well\r\nnamed, indeed, are the hymenoptera, seeing that they are the great\r\nmatrimonial go-betweens, carrying pollen from one individual to another\r\nand thus uniting what otherwise could not meet. Spectacular as this\r\nwidespread commerce is, it forms but portion of the daily drama in\r\nwhich animals and plants alike take part. From forthright bargainings\r\nof honey for help, we pass to less direct but no less effective\r\nalliance where plants are beholden to animals for life by the killing\r\nof their enemies or the weeding-out of their competitors, and from this\r\nto generic furtherance where the interdependence becomes broadcast. In\r\nthe matter of metabolism the advantage is not all upon one side. In the\r\nkatabolic process of that which each discards are the two classes of\r\nlife mutually complimentary,—the waste of the one being the want of\r\nthe other,—carbonic acid gas being given off by the animal, oxygen by\r\nthe plant. In biologic economy it is daily more demonstrable that both\r\nare necessary constituents to an advancing whole, and that each pays\r\nfor what it gets by what it gives in return.\r\n\r\nThat they are thus ancillary as well as coexistent today leads us to\r\nconfront for them a community of origin in the past; and further study\r\nconfirms the inference. Both paleontology and entomology, or the\r\nscience of the aged and the science of the young, prove such ancestry\r\nto be a fact. By going back from the present into the past, or, what\r\namounts to substantially the same thing, by descending in the scale of\r\nlife to the lowest known forms of organism, we find proof of\r\nconcomitance, cogent because congenital. At the time when inorganic\r\nchemical compounds first passed by evolution into organic ones, the\r\nchange was of so general a character that even such tardy\r\nrepresentatives of it as survive today tax erudition to tell to which\r\nof the two great kingdoms they belong, the vegetal or the animal.\r\nSimplest and most primitive of known organisms are the chromacea,\r\nunnucleated single cells as Haeckel has shown, and next to them in\r\norder come many of the bacteria, also of simple unnucleated plasm. So\r\nlittle do the majority of the bacteria differ morphologically from the\r\nchromacea, that on the score of structure the two are not to be\r\ncatalogued apart. Both are as elemental as anything well can be, which\r\nonly their diet serves to divide. Each is an organism without organs,\r\nthus belying the dictionary definition of both animals and plants.\r\nEtymologically they are not organic yet manifestly are alive, and only\r\nin their action are unlike. The chromacea are plasm-forming beings, and\r\ntherefore they are plants; the bacteria are plasm-eating beings, and so\r\nare animals. Even this distinction is not always preserved. As Haeckel\r\ntells us: “the nitro-bacteria which dwell in the earth having the\r\nvegetal property of converting ammonia by oxidation into nitrous acid\r\nand this into nitric acid, using as their source of carbon the carbonic\r\nacid gas of the atmosphere. They feed, like the chromacea, on simple\r\ninorganic compounds.” Here, then, we have, close to the threshold of\r\norganic life, unorganized organisms, roughly speaking coeval and\r\ndiffering in a sense but little, either of them, from inorganic\r\ncrystals; and yet the one is an animal, the other a plant. Progenitors\r\nof the two great divisions of life, they were themselves concomitantly\r\nevolved, either side by side or as offshoots both of a common stock.\r\nNow, if the ancestors of the two great organic kingdoms were thus\r\nsimultaneously produced here, we are warranted in believing that they\r\nwould similarly be produced elsewhere, given conditions suitably alike.\r\nIn consequence, if we detect the presence of the one, we already have\r\nan argument for inferring the other. Not to complete our syllogism\r\nwould be to flaunt a lack of logic in nature’s face.\r\n\r\nRationally viewed, then, the general problem of life in other worlds\r\nreduces itself to a question of conditions. Since certain physical\r\nresults follow inevitably upon certain physical premises, if we can\r\nassure ourselves of the proper premises we may look to nature for their\r\nconclusion. _A priori_, then, the possibility of life becomes one of\r\nhabitat. If the environment be suitable life will ensue. What makes for\r\nsuch a mediary _milieu_ is, like most cosmic processes, in its\r\nfundamentals of interesting simplicity; for the production of a proper\r\nnidus depends primarily upon the mere size of the body parentally\r\nconcerned. If a planet be big enough it will inevitably bring forth\r\nlife, because of conditions suitable to its generating; if too small it\r\nwill remain sterile to the end of time.\r\n\r\nThat size should be the determining factor whether a planet shall be\r\nfecund or barren may seem at first thought strange. Yet that it is so\r\nadmits of no rational doubt. All that we see of bodies about us shows\r\nits truth, and what we have learnt of cosmic process enables us in some\r\nsort to discern why. In order for evolution, such as we mark it upon\r\nthe earth, to be possible, the parent body must have been at one time\r\nat a high temperature, since only under great heat can the primal\r\nprocesses occur. But for this generation of caloric the aggregate mass\r\nof the particles, the falling together of which makes the planet, and\r\ntheir stoppage its internal heat, must be large. The sun’s rays alone\r\nare insufficient to cause the necessary temperature; the heat must come\r\nfrom within, though it be helped from without. Even here the action is\r\nabetted by a large body. For a planet to entrap the sun’s rays or even\r\nto preserve its own internal warmth, an atmosphere is needed, and it\r\ntakes a large body to retain an atmospheric covering sufficiently long.\r\nYet without it not only would there be no suitable state, but no medium\r\nin which organic or even inorganic reactions could go on. Lastly,\r\nwater, the essential nidus for the organism’s early stages, has its\r\npresence similarly conditioned. For this, like the atmosphere, would\r\nfrom a small body speedily vanish away. Thus the planet itself is the\r\nlife-producing body, although the sun furthers the process when once\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThat the needed substances are planetarily present, what we know of the\r\ndistribution of matter astronomically sufficiently attests. What we\r\nfind in meteorites shows that the catastrophe which preceded our\r\npresent solar system’s birth scattered its elemental constituents\r\nthroughout its domain, and thus when they came to be gathered up again\r\ninto planets that these must have been materially the same. The manner,\r\nnot the matter, then, is alone that about which we are concerned.\r\n\r\nNow, if the mass of matter gravitating together to form a planet be\r\nsufficient to produce the proper inorganic conditions, the organic must\r\nfollow as a matter of course. That the organic springs from the\r\ninorganic is not only shown by what has taken place on earth, but is\r\nthe necessary logical deduction from its decay back into the inorganic\r\nagain. As Nägeli admirably observes: “The origin of the organic from\r\nthe inorganic is, in the first place, not a question of experience and\r\nexperiment, but a fact deduced from the law of the constancy of matter\r\nand force. If all things in the material world are causally related, if\r\nall phenomena proceed on natural principles, organisms which are formed\r\nof and decay into the same matter must have been derived originally\r\nfrom inorganic compounds.”\r\n\r\nThe original oneness of the two, the fact that the organic sprang from\r\nthe inorganic, is shown by the cousinly closeness of the lowest organic\r\nwith the highest inorganic substances. The monera are suggestive of\r\ncrystals in their uniformity of structure. Both are homogeneous or\r\napproximately so. Again, both grow by taking from what they come in\r\ncontact with that which they find suitable and so add to their body by\r\nhomogeneous accretion. Finally, when grown too large for single life,\r\nthey part into similar crystals or split into identical cells. The\r\ndifference between the division of the crystal and the fission of the\r\ncell is small in kind; much less than that later differentiation in\r\ngenesis into parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction. Yet here we\r\nunhesitatingly trace an assured relationship. It were straining at a\r\ngnat to swallow a camel to doubt it in the other.\r\n\r\nJust as the two behave analogically alike in their own action, so do\r\nthey observe a like attitude toward nature. They thus point to their\r\ncommon origin. The monera are resemblant of chemical compounds in their\r\nsuperiority to external influences. To outward conditions of\r\ntemperature and humidity the chromacea are much as sticks and stones.\r\nSome species may remain for long frozen in ice, Haeckel observes, and\r\nyet wake to activity so soon as it thaws. Others may be completely\r\ndesiccated, and then resume their life when put in water after a lapse\r\nof several years. Thus both in their deathlike lives and in their\r\nliving immortality the chromacea are close to inorganic things.\r\n\r\nFrom preference, however, these lowest forms of life affect what to us\r\nwould be unbearable temperatures. Many of the chromacea live in hot\r\nsprings at temperatures of 123° to 176° Fahrenheit, in which no other,\r\nthat is, no higher, organism can dwell. This choice of habitat is in\r\nline with the other details of their evolutionary career. For it, too,\r\nis in keeping with the conditions of crystalline growth, halfway as it\r\nwere on the road to them; the forming of crystals beginning at a\r\ntemperature higher still. And we perceive from it that the passing of\r\nthe inorganic into the organic is brought about by a lowering of the\r\ntemperature of the parent planet. This again, is in line with the\r\nevolution of chemical complexity. Let the heat become less, and higher\r\nand higher chemical compounds, finally the organic ones, become\r\npossible. That evolution is nothing else than such a gradually\r\nincreasing chemical synthesis is forced on one by study of the facts.\r\nOnce started, life, as paleontology shows, develops along both the\r\nfloral and the faunal lines side by side, taking on complexity with\r\ntime. It begins so soon as secular cooling has condensed water vapor to\r\nits liquid state; chromacea and confervæ coming into being high up\r\ntoward the boiling-point. Then, with lowering temperature come the\r\nseaweeds and the rhizopods, then the land plants and the lunged\r\nvertebrates. Hand in hand the fauna and flora climb to more intricate\r\nperfecting, life rising as temperature lowers.\r\n\r\nWe perceive then that, considered _a priori_, the possibility of life\r\non a planet is merely a question of the planet’s size; and then\r\npursuantly that the character of that life is a matter of the planet’s\r\nage. But age again is a question of size. For the smaller its mass the\r\nquicker the body cools, and with a planet, growing cold means growing\r\nold. Within the bounds that make life possible, the smaller the body\r\nthe quicker it ages and the more advanced its denizens must be. Just\r\nhow far the advance goes we may not assert dogmatically in a given\r\ncase, since not relative age alone but absolute time as well is\r\nconcerned in it. It may be that nature’s processes cannot be hurried,\r\nand that for want of time development may in part be missed. But from\r\ngeneral considerations the limit of the time needed seems well within\r\nmost planetary careers.\r\n\r\nNow, the aspect of the surface of Mars shows that both these conditions\r\nhave been fulfilled. Mars is large enough to have begotten vegetation\r\nand small enough to be already old. All that we know of the physical\r\nstate of the planet points to the possibility of both vegetal and\r\nanimal life existing there, and furthermore, that this life should be\r\nof a relatively high order is possible. Nothing contradicts this, and\r\nthe observations of the last ten years have rendered the conclusion\r\nthen advanced only the more conclusive. Even the evidence of the past\r\nstate of the planet confirms that given by its present one. That with\r\nus life came out of the seas finds its possible parallel in the fact\r\nthat seas seem once to have existed there, leaving their mark\r\ndiscernible to-day. Life, then, had there as here the wherewith to\r\nbegin. That we find air and water in both shows that it had the means\r\nto continue once begun. That it then ran a like course is further\r\nwitnessed by what we now detect. The necessary premises, then, are\r\nthere. More than this. One half of the conclusion, vegetal life, gives\r\nevidence of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                                EVIDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the existence of animal life upon a far planet any evidence must, of\r\nnecessity, assume a different guise from what its flora would present.\r\nPlant life should be, as on Mars we perceive it is, recognizable as\r\npart and parcel of the main features of the planet’s face. In no such\r\nforthright manner could we expect an animal revelation. The sort of\r\ntestimony which would render the one patent would leave the other\r\nobstinately hid.\r\n\r\nSo long as animate life was in the lowest sense animal, it would not be\r\nseen at all, though it were as widespread as the vegetal life all about\r\nit. Reason for this lies in their receptive character. Plants are\r\nfixtures; where they start they stay; while from the nature of their\r\nfood, derived directly from the soil and from the air, and conditioned\r\nchiefly by warmth and moisture, like forms inhabit large areas and by\r\ntheir massed effect make far impression. With animals it is otherwise.\r\nThey feed by forage, from beetle to buffalo, roaming the land for\r\nsustenance. Thus, both for paucity of number and from not abiding in\r\none stay they must escape notice at a distance such that as individuals\r\nthey fail to show; to say nothing of the fact that the flora usually\r\novertop the fauna, and so help to hide the latter while appearing\r\nitself distinct. Any far view of our earth gives instance of this. Seen\r\nfrom some panoramic height, forest and moorland lie patently outspread\r\nto view, yet imagination is taxed to believe them tenanted at all.\r\nUnless man have marred the landscape not a sign appears of any living\r\nthing. One must be near indeed to note even such unusual sights as a\r\nherd of buffalo in the plains or those immense flights of pigeons, that\r\nin former years occurred like clouds darkening the air. From the\r\nstandpoint of another planet, through any such direct showing animal\r\nexistence would still remain unknown.\r\n\r\nNot until the creatures had reached a certain phase in evolution would\r\ntheir presence become perceptible; and not then directly, but by the\r\nresults such presence brought to pass. Occupancy would be first\r\nevidenced by its imprint on the land; discernible thus initially not so\r\nmuch by the bodily as by the mind’s eye. For not till the animal had\r\nlearnt to dominate nature and fashion it to his needs and ends would\r\nhis existence betray itself. By the transformation he wrought in the\r\nlandscape would he be known. It is thus we should make our own far\r\nacquaintance; and by the disarrangement of nature first have inkling of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThat it is thus we should betray ourselves, a consideration of man’s\r\nhistory will show. While he still remained of savage simplicity, a mere\r\nchild of nature, he might come and go unmarked by an outsider, but so\r\nsoon as he started in to possess the earth his handicraft would reveal\r\nhim. From the moment he bethought him to till the ground, he entered\r\nupon a course of world-subjugation of which we cannot foresee the end;\r\nbut he has already advanced far enough to give us an idea of the\r\nprocess. It began with agriculture. Deforestation with its subsequent\r\nquartering of crops signalized his acquisition of real estate. His\r\nimpress at first was sporadic and irregular, and in so far followed\r\nthat of nature itself; but as it advanced it took on a methodism of\r\nplan. Husbandry begot thrift, and augmented wants demanded an\r\nincreasing return for toil; and to this desirable end systematization\r\nbecame a necessity. At the same time gregariousness grew and still\r\nfurther emphasized the need for economy of space and time. In part\r\nunconsciously, man learnt the laws that govern the expenditure of force\r\nand more and more consciously applied them. Geometry, unloosed of\r\nEuclid, became a part of everyday life as insidiously as M. Jourdain\r\nfound that he had been talking prose. Regularity rules to-day, to the\r\nlament of art. The railroad is straighter than the turnpike, as that is\r\nstraighter than the trail. Communication is now too urgent in its\r\ndemands to know anything but law and take other than the shortest path\r\nto its destination. Tillage has undergone a like rectification. To one\r\nused to the patchwork quilting of the crops in older lands the\r\nmethodical rectangles of the farms of the Great West are painfully\r\nexact. Yet it is more than probable that these material manifestations\r\nwould be the first signs of intelligence to one considering the earth\r\nfrom far. Our towns would in all likelihood constitute the next; and,\r\nlastly, the great arteries of travel that minister to their wants.\r\nTheir scale, too, would render them the first objects to be observed.\r\nFarming as now practiced in Kansas or Dakota gives it a certain\r\ncosmical concern; fields for miles turning in hue with the rhythm of\r\nthe drilled should impress an eye, if armed with our appliances, many\r\nmillions of miles away.\r\n\r\nEven now we should know ourselves cosmically by our geometrical\r\ndesigns. To interplanetary understanding it is this quality that would\r\nspeak. Still more so will it tell as time goes on. As yet we are but at\r\nthe beginning of our subjugation of the globe. We have hardly explored\r\nit all, still less occupied it. When we do so, and space shall have\r\nbecome enhancedly precious, directness of purpose with economy of\r\nresult will have partitioned so regularly the surface of the earth as\r\nto impart to it an artificiality of appearance, and it becomes one vast\r\ncoördinated expanse subservient entirely to the wants of its\r\npossessors. Centres of population and lines of communication, with\r\ntillage carried on in the most economic way; to this it must come in\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nNor is this outcome in any sense a circumstance accidental to the\r\nearth; it is an inevitable phase in the evolution of organisms. As the\r\norganism develops brain it is able to circumvent the adversities of\r\ncondition; and by overcoming more pronounced inhospitality of\r\nenvironment not only to survive but spread. Evidence of this thought\r\nwill be stamped more and more visibly upon the face of its habitat. On\r\nearth, for all our pride of intellect, we have not yet progressed very\r\nfar from the lowly animal state that leaves no records of itself. It is\r\nonly in the last two centuries that our self-registration upon our\r\nsurroundings has been marked. With another planet the like course must\r\nin all probability be pursued, and the older the life relatively to its\r\nhabitat the more its signs of occupation should show. Intelligence on\r\nother worlds could then only make its presence known by such material\r\nrevelation, and the sign-manuals of itself would appear more artificial\r\nin look as that life was high in rank. Given the certainty of\r\nplant-life, such markings are what one would look to find. Criticism\r\nwhich refuses to credit detail of the sort because too bizarre to be\r\ntrue writes itself down as unacquainted with the character of the\r\nproblem. For it is precisely such detail which should show if any\r\nevidence at all were forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we turn our inquiry to Mars, we shall be fairly startled at\r\nwhat its disk discloses. For we find ourselves confronted in the canals\r\nand oases by precisely the appearances _a priori_ reasoning proves\r\nshould show were the planet inhabited. Our abstract prognostications\r\nhave taken concrete form. Here in these rectilineal lines and roundish\r\nspots we have spread out our centres of effort and our lines of\r\ncommunication. For the oases are clearly ganglia to which the canals\r\nplay the part of nerves. The strange geometricism which proves\r\ninexplicable on any other hypothesis now shows itself of the essence of\r\nthe solution. The appearance of artificiality cast up at the phenomena\r\nin disproof vindicates itself as the vital point in the whole matter.\r\nLike the cachet of an architect, it is the thing about the building\r\nthat established the authorship.\r\n\r\nThough the Earth and Mars agree in being planets, they differ\r\nconstitutionally in several important respects. Even to us the curious\r\nnetwork that enshrouds the Martian disk suggests handicraft; it implies\r\nit much more when considered from a Martian standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                        THE HUSBANDING OF WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the canals and oases are of artificial origin is thus suggested by\r\ntheir very look; when we come to go further and inquire into what may\r\nbe their office in the planet’s economy, we find that the idea in\r\naddition to its general probability now acquires particular support.\r\nFor this we are indebted in part to study of their static aspect, but\r\nchiefly to what has been learnt of their kinematic action.\r\n\r\nDearth of water is the key to their character. Water is very scarce on\r\nthe planet. We know this by the absence of any bodies of it of any size\r\nupon the surface. So far as we can see the only available water is what\r\ncomes from the semi-annual melting at one or the other cap of the snow\r\naccumulated there during the previous winter. Beyond this there is none\r\nexcept for what may be present in the air. Now, water is absolutely\r\nessential to all forms of life; no organisms can exist without it.\r\n\r\nBut as a planet ages, it loses its oceans as has before been explained,\r\nand gradually its whole water supply. Life upon its surface is\r\nconfronted by a growing scarcity of this essential to existence. For\r\nits fauna to survive it must utilize all it can get. To this end it\r\nwould be obliged to put forth its chief endeavors, and the outcome of\r\nsuch work would result in a deformation of the disk indicative of its\r\npresence. Lines of communication for water purposes, between the polar\r\ncaps, on the one hand, and the centres of population, on the other,\r\nwould be the artificial markings we should expect to perceive.\r\n\r\nNow, it is not a little startling that the semblance of just such signs\r\nof intelligent interference with nature is what we discern on the face\r\nof Mars,—in the canals and oases. So dominant in its mien is the\r\npencil-like directness of the canals as to be the trait that primarily\r\nstrikes an unprejudiced observer who beholds this astounding system of\r\nlines under favorable definition for the first time, and its\r\nimpressiveness only grows on him with study of the phenomena. That they\r\nsuggested rule and compass, Schiaparelli said of them long ago, without\r\ncommitting himself as to what they were. In perception the great\r\nobserver was, as usual, quite right; and the better they are seen the\r\nmore they justify the statement. Punctilious in their precision, they\r\noutdo in method all attempts of freehand drawing to copy them. Often\r\nhas the writer tried to represent the regularity he saw, only to draw\r\nand redraw his lines in vain. Nothing short of ruling them could have\r\nreproduced what the telescope revealed. Strange as their depiction may\r\nlook in the drawings, the originals look stranger still. Indeed, that\r\nthey should look unnatural when properly depicted is not unnatural if\r\nthey are so in fact. For it is the geodetic precision which the lines\r\nexhibit that instantly stamps them to consciousness as artificial. The\r\ninference is so forthright as to be shared by those who have not seen\r\nthem to the extent of instant denial of their objectivity. Drawings of\r\nthem look too strange to be true. So scepticism imputes to the\r\ndraughtsman their artificial fashioning, not realizing that by so doing\r\nit bears unconscious witness to their character. For in order to\r\ndisprove the deduction it is driven to deny the fact. Now the fact can\r\nlook after itself and will be recognized in time. For that the lines\r\nare as I have stated is beyond doubt. Each return of the planet shows\r\nthem more and more geometric as sites are bettered and training\r\nimproves.\r\n\r\nSuggestive of design as their initial appearance is, the idea of\r\nartificiality receives further sanction from more careful\r\nconsideration, even from a static point of view, on at least eight\r\ncounts:—\r\n\r\n1. Their straightness;\r\n\r\n2. Their individually uniform size;\r\n\r\n3. Their extreme tenuity;\r\n\r\n4. The dual character of some of them;\r\n\r\n5. Their position with regard to the planet’s fundamental features;\r\n\r\n6. Their relation to the oases;\r\n\r\n7. The character of these spots; and, finally,\r\n\r\n8. The systematic networking by both canals and spots of the whole\r\nsurface of the planet.\r\n\r\nNow, no natural phenomena within our knowledge show such regularity on\r\nsuch a scale upon any one of these eight counts, _a fortiori_ upon all.\r\nWhen one considers that these lines run for thousands of miles in an\r\nunswerving direction, as far relatively as from London to Bombay, and\r\nas far actually as from Boston to San Francisco, the inadequacy of\r\nnatural explanation becomes glaring.\r\n\r\nThese several counts become more expressive of design the farther one\r\nlooks into them. Straightness upon a sphere means the following of an\r\narc of a great circle. The lines, then, are arcs of great circles. Now,\r\nthe great circle course is the shortest distance connecting two given\r\npoints. The canals of Mars, then, practice this economy; they connect\r\ntheir terminals by the shortest, that is, other things equal, by the\r\nquickest and least wasteful path. Their preserving a uniform width\r\nthroughout this distance is an equally unnatural feature for any\r\nnatural action to exhibit, but a perfectly natural one for an unnatural\r\nagent. For means of communication for whatever cause would probably be\r\nfashioned of like countenance throughout. Their extreme tenuity is a\r\nthird trait pointing to artificiality; inasmuch as the narrower they\r\nare, the more probable is their construction by local intelligence.\r\nEven more inexplicable, except from intent, is their dual character.\r\nFor them to parallel one another like the twin rails of a railway\r\ntrack, seems quite beyond the powers of natural causation. Enigmatic,\r\nindeed, from a natural standpoint, they cease to be so enigmatic viewed\r\nfrom an artificial one; and this the more by reason of what has lately\r\nbeen learnt of the character of their distribution. That they are found\r\nmost plentifully near the equator, where the latitudinal girth is\r\ngreatest, and thence diminish in numbers to about latitude 60°, where\r\nthey disappear,—and this not relatively to the amount of surface but\r\nactually,—is very significant. It is quite incapable of natural\r\nexplanation, and can only be accounted for on some theory of design\r\nsuch as lines of communication, or canals conducting water down the\r\nlatitudes for distribution. So that this distribution of the doubles is\r\nin keeping with the law of development disclosed by the canals _en\r\nmasse_. Channels and return-channels the two lines of the pair may be,\r\nbut about this we can at present posit nothing. The relation may be of\r\nstill greater complexity, and we must carefully distinguish between\r\nsurmise and deduction.\r\n\r\nThe position of the canals, with regard to the main features of the\r\ndisk, has a cogency of its own, an argument from time. The places from\r\nwhich the lines start and to which they go are such as to imply a\r\ndependence of the latter upon the former chronologically. The lines are\r\nlogically superposed upon the natural features; not as if they had\r\ngrown there, but as if they had been placed there for topographic\r\ncause. Those termini are used which we should ourselves select for\r\nstations of intercommunication. For the lines not only leave important\r\ngeodetic points, but they travel directly to equally salient ones.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the canals with the oases is no less telltale of\r\nintent. The spots are found only at junctions, clearly the seal and\r\nsanction of such rendezvous. Their relation to the canals that enter\r\nthem bespeaks method and design. Centring single lines, they are\r\ninclosed by doubles, a disposition such as would be true did they hold\r\na pivotal position in the planet’s economy.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the oases also suggests significance. Their form is round,\r\na solid circle of shading of so deep a tone as to seem black, although\r\nundoubtedly in truth blue-green. Now, a circular area has this peculiar\r\nproperty, that it incloses for a given length of perimeter the maximum\r\nof space. Any other area has a longer inclosing boundary for the\r\nsurface inclosed. Considering each area to be made up of onion-like\r\nenvelops to an original core, each similar in shape to the kernel, we\r\nsee that the property in question means that the average distance for\r\npoints of the circular area from the centre is less than the same\r\ndistance for those of any other figure. This has immediate bearing on\r\nthe possible fashioning of such areas. For sufficient intelligence in\r\nthe fashioners would certainly lead to a construction, where the\r\ngreatest area could be attended to at the least expenditure of force.\r\nThis would be where the distance to be traveled from the centre to all\r\nthe desired points was on the average least; that is, the area would be\r\nround.\r\n\r\nBut last and all-embracing in its import is the system which the canals\r\nform. Instead of running at haphazard, the canals are interconnected in\r\na most remarkable manner. They seek centres instead of avoiding them.\r\nThe centres are linked thus perfectly one with another, an arrangement\r\nwhich could not result from centres, whether of explosion or otherwise,\r\nwhich were themselves discrete. Furthermore, the system covers the\r\nwhole surface of the planet, dark areas and light ones alike, a\r\nworld-wide distribution which exceeds the bounds of natural\r\npossibility. Any force which could act longitudinally on such a scale\r\nmust be limited latitudinally in its action, as witness the belts of\r\nJupiter or the spots upon the sun. Rotational, climatic, or other\r\nphysical cause could not fail of zonal expression. Yet these lines are\r\ngrandly indifferent to such compelling influences. Finally, the system\r\nafter meshing the surface in its entirety runs straight into the polar\r\ncaps.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, a system whose end and aim is the tapping of the snow-cap\r\nfor the water there semiannually let loose; then to distribute it over\r\nthe planet’s face.\r\n\r\nFunction of this very sort is evidenced by the look of the canals.\r\nFurther study during the last eleven years as to their behavior leads\r\nto a like conclusion, while at the same time it goes much farther by\r\nrevealing the action in the case. This action proves to be not only in\r\naccord with the theory, but interestingly explanatory of the process.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the canals have shown themselves, as they showed to\r\nSchiaparelli, to be seasonal phenomena. This negatives afresh the\r\npossibility of their being cracks. But furthermore, their seasonal\r\nbehavior turns out to follow a law quite different from what we know on\r\nearth and betokens that they are indebted to the melting of the polar\r\ncap for their annual growth, even more directly than to the sun, and\r\nthat vegetation is the only thing that satisfactorily accounts for\r\ntheir conduct. But again this is not all. Their time of quickening\r\nproceeds with singular uniformity down the disk, not only to, but\r\n_across the equator_. Now, this last fact has peculiar significance.\r\n\r\nSo large are the planetary masses that no substance can resist the\r\nstrains due to the cosmic forces acting on them to change their shape\r\ntill it becomes one of stable equilibrium. Thus a body of planetary\r\nsize, if unrotating, becomes a sphere except for solar tidal\r\ndeformation; if rotating, it takes on a spheroidal form exactly\r\nexpressive, as far as observation goes, of the so-called centrifugal\r\nforce at work. Mars presents such a figure, being flattened out to\r\ncorrespond to its axial rotation. Its surface, therefore, is in fluid\r\nequilibrium, or, in other words, a particle of liquid at any point of\r\nits surface at the present time would stay where it was, devoid of\r\ninclination to move elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNow, the water which quickens the verdure of the canals moves from the\r\nneighborhood of the pole down to the equator as the season advances.\r\nThis it does, then, irrespective of gravity. No natural force propels\r\nit, and the inference is forthright and inevitable that it is\r\nartificially helped to its end. There seems to be no escape from this\r\ndeduction. Water flows only downhill, and there is no such thing as\r\ndownhill on a surface already in fluid equilibrium. A few canals might\r\npresumably be so situated that their flow could, by inequality of\r\nterrane, lie equatorward, but not all. As we see on the earth, rivers\r\nflow impartially to all points of the compass, dependent only upon\r\nunevenness of the local surface conditions. Now, it is not in\r\nparticular but by general consent that the canal system of Mars\r\ndevelops from pole to equator.\r\n\r\nFrom the respective times at which the minima take place, it appears\r\nthat the canal-quickening occupies fifty-two days, as evidenced by the\r\nsuccessive vegetal darkenings to descend from latitude 72° north to\r\nlatitude 0°, a journey of 2650 miles. This gives for the water a speed\r\nof fifty-one miles a day, or 2.1 miles an hour. The rate of progression\r\nis remarkably uniform; and this abets the deduction as to assisted\r\ntransference. The simple fact that it is carried from near the pole to\r\nthe equator is sufficiently telltale of extrinsic aid, but the\r\nuniformity of the action increases its significance.\r\n\r\nBut the fact is more unnatural yet. The growth pays no regard to the\r\nequator, but proceeds across it as if it did not exist into the\r\nplanet’s other hemisphere. Here is something still more telling than\r\nits travel to this point. For even if we suppose, for the sake of\r\nargument, that natural forces took the water down to the equator, their\r\naction must there be certainly reversed and the equator prove a\r\ndead-line to pass which were impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort or other we may consider\r\nas certain as it is uncertain what those beings may be. The theory of\r\nthe existence of intelligent life on Mars may be likened to the atomic\r\ntheory in chemistry in that in both we are led to the belief in units\r\nwhich we are alike unable to define. Both theories explain the facts in\r\ntheir respective fields and are the only theories that do, while as to\r\nwhat an atom may resemble we know as little as what a Martian may be\r\nlike. But the behavior of chemic compounds points to the existence of\r\natoms too small for us to see, and in the same way the aspect and\r\nbehavior of the Martian markings implies the action of agents too far\r\naway to be made out.\r\n\r\nBut though in neither case can we tell anything of the Bodily form of\r\nits unit, we can in both predicate a good deal about their workings.\r\nApart from the general fact of intelligence implied by the geometric\r\ncharacter of their constructions, is the evidence as to its degree\r\nafforded by the cosmopolitan extent of the action. Girdling their globe\r\nand stretching from pole, to pole, the Martian canal system not only\r\nembraces their whole world, but is an organized entity. Each canal\r\njoins another, which in turn connects with a third, and so on over the\r\nentire surface of the planet. This continuity of construction posits a\r\ncommunity of interest. Now, when we consider that though not so large\r\nas the Earth the world of Mars is one of 4200 miles diameter and\r\ntherefore containing something like 212,000,000 of square miles, the\r\nunity of the process acquires considerable significance. The supposed\r\nvast enterprises of the earth look small beside it. None of them but\r\nbecome local in comparison, gigantic as they seem to us to be.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that is forced on us in conclusion is the necessarily\r\nintelligent and non-bellicose character of the community which could\r\nthus act as a unit throughout its globe. War is a survival among us\r\nfrom savage times and affects now chiefly the boyish and unthinking\r\nelement of the nation. The wisest realize that there are better ways\r\nfor practicing heroism and other and more certain ends of insuring the\r\nsurvival of the fittest. It is something a people outgrow. But whether\r\nthey consciously practice peace or not, nature in its evolution\r\neventually practices it for them, and after enough of the inhabitants\r\nof a globe have killed each other off, the remainder must find it more\r\nadvantageous to work together for the common good. Whether increasing\r\ncommon sense or increasing necessity was the spur that drove the\r\nMartians to this eminently sagacious state we cannot say, but it is\r\ncertain that reached it they have, and equally certain that if they had\r\nnot they must all die. When a planet has attained to the age of\r\nadvancing decrepitude, and the remnant of its water supply resides\r\nsimply in its polar caps, these can only be effectively tapped for the\r\nbenefit of the inhabitants when arctic and equatorial peoples are at\r\none. Difference of policy on the question of the all-important water\r\nsupply means nothing short of death. Isolated communities cannot there\r\nbe sufficient unto themselves; they must combine to solidarity or\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact, therefore, that the reticulated canal system is an\r\nelaborate entity embracing the whole planet from one pole to the other,\r\nwe have not only proof of the world-wide sagacity of its builders, but\r\na very suggestive side-light, to the fact that only a universal\r\nnecessity such as water could well be its underlying cause.\r\n\r\nPossessed of important bearing upon the possibility of life on Mars is\r\nthe rather recent appreciation that the habitat of both plants and\r\nanimals is conditioned not by the minimum, nor by the mean temperature\r\nof the locality, but by the maximum heat attained in the region. Not\r\nonly is the minimum thermometric point no determinator of a dead-line,\r\nbut even a mean temperature does not measure organic capability. The\r\nreason for this is that the continuance of the species seems to depend\r\nsolely upon the possibility of reproduction, and this in turn upon a\r\nsuitable temperature at the critical period of the plant’s or animal’s\r\ncareer. Contrary to previous ideas on the subject, Merriam found this\r\nto be the case with the fauna of the San Francisco Peak region in\r\nnorthern Arizona. The region was peculiarly fitted for a test, because\r\nof rising a boreal island of life out of a sub-tropic sea of desert. It\r\nthus reproduced along its flanks the conditions of climates farther\r\nnorth, altitude taking the part of latitude, one succeeding another\r\nuntil at the top stood the arctic zone. Merriam showed that the\r\nexistence of life there was dependent solely upon a sufficiency of\r\nwarmth at the breeding season. If that were enough the animal or plant\r\npropagated its kind, and held its foothold against adverse conditions\r\nduring the rest of the year. This it did by living during its brief\r\nsummer and then going into hibernation the balance of the time. Nature\r\nin short suspended its functions to a large extent for months together,\r\nenabling it to resurrect when the conditions turned.\r\n\r\nHibernation proves thus to be a trait acquired by the organism in\r\nconsequence of climatic conditions. Like all such it can only be\r\ndeveloped in time, since nature is incapable of abrupt transition. An\r\nanimal suddenly transported from the tropic to a sub-arctic zone will\r\nperish, because it has not yet learnt the trick of winter sleeping.\r\nWhile still characterized by seasonal insomnia it is incapable of\r\nstoring its energies and biding its time. But given time enough to\r\nacquire the art, its existence is determined solely by the enjoyment of\r\nheat enough at some season to permit of the vital possibility of\r\nreproducing its kind.\r\n\r\nDiurnal shutting off of the heat affects the process but little,\r\nprovided the fall be not below freezing at the hottest season. So much\r\nis shown by the fauna of our arctic and sub-arctic zones, but still\r\nmore pertinently to Mars by the zones of the San Francisco Peak region,\r\nsince the thinner air of altitude, through which a greater amount of\r\nheat can radiate off, is there substituted for the thicker one of\r\nlatitudinally equal isotherms. Here again with the diurnal as before\r\nwith the seasonal it is the maximum, not the mean, or, till low, even\r\nthe minimum temperature, that tells.\r\n\r\nNow, with Mars the state of things is completely in accord with what is\r\nthus demanded for the existence of life. The Martian climate is one of\r\nextremes, where considerable heat treads on the heels of great cold.\r\nAnd the one of these two conditions is as certain as the other, as the\r\ncondition of the planet’s surface shows conclusively. In summer and\r\nduring the day it must be decidedly hot, certainly well above any\r\npossible freezing, a thinner air blanket actually increasing the amount\r\nof heat that reaches the surface, though affecting the length of time\r\nof its retention unfavorably. The maximum temperature, therefore,\r\ncannot be low. The minimum of course is; but as we have just seen, it\r\nis the maximum that regulates the possibility of life. In spite,\r\ntherefore, of a winter probably longer and colder than our own, organic\r\nlife is not in the least debarred from finding itself there.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the conditions appear to be such as to put a premium upon life\r\nof a high order. The Martian year being twice as long as our own, the\r\nsummer is there proportionately extended. Even in the southern\r\nhemisphere, the one where the summer is the shortest, it lasts for 158\r\ndays, while at the same latitudes our own is but 90 days. This\r\nlengthening of the period of reproduction cannot but have an elevating\r\neffect upon the organism akin to the prolongation of childhood pointed\r\nout by John Fiske as playing so important a part in the evolution of\r\nthe highest animals. Day and night, on the other hand, alternate there\r\nwith approximately the same speed as here, and except for what is due\r\nto a thinner air covering reproduce our own terrestrial diurnal\r\nconditions, which as we saw are not inimical to life.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, then, Mars proves to be by no means so bad a habitat.\r\nIt offers another example of how increasing knowledge widens the domain\r\nthat life may occupy. Just as we have now found organic existence in\r\nabyssal depths of sea and in excessive degrees of both heat and cold,\r\nso do we find from exploration of our island mountains, which more than\r\nany other locality on earth facsimile the Martian surface, its\r\npossession there as well.\r\n\r\nAnother point, too, is worth consideration. In an aging world where the\r\nconditions of life have grown more difficult, mentality must\r\ncharacterize more and more its beings in order for them to survive, and\r\nwould in consequence tend to be evolved. To find, therefore, upon Mars\r\nhighly intelligent life is what the planet’s state would lead one to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nTo some people it may seem that the very strangeness of Martian life\r\nprecludes for it an appeal to human interest. To me this is but a\r\nnear-sighted view. The less the life there proves a counterpart of our\r\nearthly state of things, the more it fires fancy and piques inquiry as\r\nto what it be. We all have felt this impulse in our childhood as our\r\nancestors did before us, when they conjured goblins and spirits from\r\nthe vasty void, and if our energy continue we never cease to feel its\r\nforce through life. We but exchange, as our years increase, the romance\r\nof fiction for the more thrilling romance of fact. As we grow older we\r\ndemand reality, but so this requisite be fulfilled the stranger the\r\nrealization the better we are pleased. Perhaps it is the more vivid\r\nimagination of youth that enables us all then to dispense with the\r\nhall-mark of actuality upon our cherished visions; perhaps a deeper\r\nsense of our own oneness with nature as we get on makes us insist upon\r\ngetting the real thing. Whatever the reason be, certain it is that with\r\nthe years a narration, no matter how enthralling, takes added hold of\r\nus for being true. But though we crave this solid foothold for our\r\nconceptions, we yield on that account no jot or tittle of our interest\r\nfor the unexpected.\r\n\r\nGood reason we have for the allurement we feel toward what is least\r\nlike us. For the wider the separation from the familiar, the greater\r\nthe parallax the new affords for cosmic comprehension. That which\r\ndiffers little yields little to the knowledge already possessed. Just\r\nas a longer base line gives us a better measure of the distance of the\r\nsun, so here the more diverse the aspects, the farther back they push\r\nthe common starting-point and furnish proportionately comprehensive\r\ninsight into the course by which each came to be what it is. By\r\nstudying others we learn about ourselves, and though from the remote we\r\nlearn less easily, we eventually learn the more. Even on the side,\r\nthen, that touches most men, the personal, the strangeness of the\r\nsubject should to the far-seeing prove all the greater magnet.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that makes Mars of such transcendent interest to man\r\nis the foresight it affords of the course earthly evolution is to\r\npursue. On our own world we are able only to study our present and our\r\npast; in Mars we are able to glimpse, in some sort, our future.\r\nDifferent as the course of life on the two planets undoubtedly has\r\nbeen, the one helps, however imperfectly, to better understanding of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nAnother, more abstract but no less alluring, appeals to that desire\r\ninnate in man to know about the cosmos of which he forms a part and\r\nwhich we call by the name of science. Study of Mars responds to this\r\ncraving both directly by revelation of the secrets of another world and\r\nindirectly by the bearing of what we thus learn upon our understanding\r\nof the laws of the universe. For the facts thus acquired broaden our\r\nconceptions in every branch of science. Some day our own geology,\r\nmeteorology, and the rest will stand indebted to study of the planet\r\nMars for advance along their respective lines. Already the most alert\r\nof those professing them are lending ear to information from this\r\nsource, and such cosmopolitanism can but increase as the years roll on.\r\nToday what we already know is helping to comprehension of another\r\nworld; in a not distant future we shall be repaid with interest, and\r\nwhat that other world shall have taught us will redound to a better\r\nknowledge of our own, and of that cosmos of which the two form part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lowell Observatory._ MARS 1905.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Adamas_,
