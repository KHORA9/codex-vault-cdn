This publisher was D. I. Eaton, who printed as\r\nthe first number of Paine's \"Crisis\" an essay taken from the London\r\npublication. But his prefatory note says: \"Since the printing of this\r\nbook, the publisher is informed that No. 1, or first Crisis in this\r\npublication, is not one of the thirteen which Paine wrote, but a\r\nletter previous to them.\" Unfortunately this correction is sufficiently\r\nequivocal to leave on some minds the notion that Paine did write the\r\nletter in question, albeit not as a number of his \"Crisis \"; especially\r\nas Eaton's editor unwarrantably appended the signature \"C. S.,\"\r\nsuggesting \"Common Sense.\" There are, however, no such letters in the\r\nLondon essay, which is signed \"Casca.\" It was published August, 1775,\r\nin the form of a letter to General Gage, in answer to his Proclamation\r\nconcerning the affair at Lexington. It was certainly not written by\r\nPaine. It apologizes for the Americans for having, on April 19, at\r\nLexington, made \"an attack upon the King's troops from behind walls and\r\nlurking holes.\" The writer asks: \"Have not the Americans been driven\r\nto this frenzy? Is it not common for an enemy to take every advantage?\"\r\nPaine, who was in America when the affair occurred at Lexington, would\r\nhave promptly denounced Gage's story as a falsehood, but the facts known\r\nto every one in America were as yet not before the London writer. The\r\nEnglish \"Crisis\" bears evidence throughout of having been written in\r\nLondon. It derived nothing from Paine, and he derived nothing from it,\r\nunless its title, and this is too obvious for its origin to require\r\ndiscussion. I have no doubt, however, that the title was suggested\r\nby the English publication, because Paine has followed its scheme in\r\nintroducing a \"Crisis Extraordinary.\" His work consists of thirteen\r\nnumbers, and, in addition to these, a \"Crisis Extraordinary\" and a\r\n\"Supernumerary Crisis.\" In some modern collections all of these have been\r\nserially numbered, and a brief newspaper article added, making sixteen\r\nnumbers. But Paine, in his Will, speaks of the number as thirteen,\r\nwishing perhaps, in his characteristic way, to adhere to the number\r\nof the American Colonies, as he did in the thirteen ribs of his iron\r\nbridge. His enumeration is therefore followed in the present volume, and\r\nthe numbers printed successively, although other writings intervened.\r\n\r\nThe first \"Crisis\" was printed in the Pennsylvania Journal, December\r\n19, 1776, and opens with the famous sentence, \"These are the times that\r\ntry men's souls\"; the last \"Crisis\" appeared April 19,1783, (eighth\r\nanniversary of the first gun of the war, at Lexington,) and opens with\r\nthe words, \"The times that tried men's souls are over.\" The great\r\neffect produced by Paine's successive publications has been attested by\r\nWashington and Franklin, by every leader of the American Revolution,\r\nby resolutions of Congress, and by every contemporary historian of the\r\nevents amid which they were written. The first \"Crisis\" is of especial\r\nhistorical interest. It was written during the retreat of Washington\r\nacross the Delaware, and by order of the Commander was read to groups of\r\nhis dispirited and suffering soldiers. Its opening sentence was adopted\r\nas the watchword of the movement on Trenton, a few days after its\r\npublication, and is believed to have inspired much of the courage which\r\nwon that victory, which, though not imposing in extent, was of great\r\nmoral effect on Washington's little army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS I. (THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S SOULS)\r\n\r\nTHESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the\r\nsunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their\r\ncountry; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man\r\nand woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this\r\nconsolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the\r\ntriumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness\r\nonly that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper\r\nprice upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an\r\narticle as FREEDOM should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to\r\nenforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right (not only to TAX)\r\nbut \"to BIND us in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER,\" and if being bound in that\r\nmanner, is not slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon\r\nearth. Even the expression is impious; for so unlimited a power can\r\nbelong only to God.\r\n\r\nWhether the independence of the continent was declared too soon, or\r\ndelayed too long, I will not now enter into as an argument; my own\r\nsimple opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier, it would have\r\nbeen much better. We did not make a proper use of last winter, neither\r\ncould we, while we were in a dependent state. However, the fault, if it\r\nwere one, was all our own*; we have none to blame but ourselves. But\r\nno great deal is lost yet. All that Howe has been doing for this month\r\npast, is rather a ravage than a conquest, which the spirit of the\r\nJerseys, a year ago, would have quickly repulsed, and which time and a\r\nlittle resolution will soon recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The present winter is worth an age, if rightly employed; but, if\r\nlost or neglected, the whole continent will partake of the evil; and\r\nthere is no punishment that man does not deserve, be he who, or what, or\r\nwhere he will, that may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious\r\nand useful.\r\n\r\nI have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my secret\r\nopinion has ever been, and still is, that God Almighty will not give up\r\na people to military destruction, or leave them unsupportedly to perish,\r\nwho have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities\r\nof war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent. Neither have I\r\nso much of the infidel in me, as to suppose that He has relinquished the\r\ngovernment of the world, and given us up to the care of devils; and as I\r\ndo not, I cannot see on what grounds the king of Britain can look up\r\nto heaven for help against us: a common murderer, a highwayman, or a\r\nhouse-breaker, has as good a pretence as he.\r\n\r\n'Tis surprising to see how rapidly a panic will sometimes run through\r\na country. All nations and ages have been subject to them. Britain has\r\ntrembled like an ague at the report of a French fleet of flat-bottomed\r\nboats; and in the fourteenth [fifteenth] century the whole English army,\r\nafter ravaging the kingdom of France, was driven back like men petrified\r\nwith fear; and this brave exploit was performed by a few broken forces\r\ncollected and headed by a woman, Joan of Arc. Would that heaven might\r\ninspire some Jersey maid to spirit up her countrymen, and save her fair\r\nfellow sufferers from ravage and ravishment! Yet panics, in some cases,\r\nhave their uses; they produce as much good as hurt. Their duration is\r\nalways short; the mind soon grows through them, and acquires a firmer\r\nhabit than before. But their peculiar advantage is, that they are the\r\ntouchstones of sincerity and hypocrisy, and bring things and men to\r\nlight, which might otherwise have lain forever undiscovered. In fact,\r\nthey have the same effect on secret traitors, which an imaginary\r\napparition would have upon a private murderer. They sift out the\r\nhidden thoughts of man, and hold them up in public to the world. Many\r\na disguised Tory has lately shown his head, that shall penitentially\r\nsolemnize with curses the day on which Howe arrived upon the Delaware.\r\n\r\nAs I was with the troops at Fort Lee, and marched with them to the edge\r\nof Pennsylvania, I am well acquainted with many circumstances, which\r\nthose who live at a distance know but little or nothing of. Our\r\nsituation there was exceedingly cramped, the place being a narrow\r\nneck of land between the North River and the Hackensack. Our force\r\nwas inconsiderable, being not one-fourth so great as Howe could bring\r\nagainst us. We had no army at hand to have relieved the garrison, had\r\nwe shut ourselves up and stood on our defence. Our ammunition, light\r\nartillery, and the best part of our stores, had been removed, on the\r\napprehension that Howe would endeavor to penetrate the Jerseys, in\r\nwhich case Fort Lee could be of no use to us; for it must occur to every\r\nthinking man, whether in the army or not, that these kind of field forts\r\nare only for temporary purposes, and last in use no longer than the\r\nenemy directs his force against the particular object which such forts\r\nare raised to defend. Such was our situation and condition at Fort Lee\r\non the morning of the 20th of November, when an officer arrived with\r\ninformation that the enemy with 200 boats had landed about seven miles\r\nabove; Major General [Nathaniel] Green, who commanded the garrison,\r\nimmediately ordered them under arms, and sent express to General\r\nWashington at the town of Hackensack, distant by the way of the ferry\r\n= six miles. Our first object was to secure the bridge over the\r\nHackensack, which laid up the river between the enemy and us, about six\r\nmiles from us, and three from them. General Washington arrived in about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, and marched at the head of the troops towards\r\nthe bridge, which place I expected we should have a brush for; however,\r\nthey did not choose to dispute it with us, and the greatest part of our\r\ntroops went over the bridge, the rest over the ferry, except some which\r\npassed at a mill on a small creek, between the bridge and the ferry, and\r\nmade their way through some marshy grounds up to the town of Hackensack,\r\nand there passed the river. We brought off as much baggage as the wagons\r\ncould contain, the rest was lost. The simple object was to bring off\r\nthe garrison, and march them on till they could be strengthened by the\r\nJersey or Pennsylvania militia, so as to be enabled to make a stand.\r\nWe staid four days at Newark, collected our out-posts with some of\r\nthe Jersey militia, and marched out twice to meet the enemy, on being\r\ninformed that they were advancing, though our numbers were greatly\r\ninferior to theirs. Howe, in my little opinion, committed a great error\r\nin generalship in not throwing a body of forces off from Staten Island\r\nthrough Amboy, by which means he might have seized all our stores\r\nat Brunswick, and intercepted our march into Pennsylvania; but if we\r\nbelieve the power of hell to be limited, we must likewise believe that\r\ntheir agents are under some providential control.\r\n\r\nI shall not now attempt to give all the particulars of our retreat to\r\nthe Delaware; suffice it for the present to say, that both officers\r\nand men, though greatly harassed and fatigued, frequently without rest,\r\ncovering, or provision, the inevitable consequences of a long retreat,\r\nbore it with a manly and martial spirit. All their wishes centred in\r\none, which was, that the country would turn out and help them to drive\r\nthe enemy back. Voltaire has remarked that King William never appeared\r\nto full advantage but in difficulties and in action; the same remark may\r\nbe made on General Washington, for the character fits him. There is a\r\nnatural firmness in some minds which cannot be unlocked by trifles, but\r\nwhich, when unlocked, discovers a cabinet of fortitude; and I reckon it\r\namong those kind of public blessings, which we do not immediately see,\r\nthat God hath blessed him with uninterrupted health, and given him a\r\nmind that can even flourish upon care.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this paper with some miscellaneous remarks on the state\r\nof our affairs; and shall begin with asking the following question, Why\r\nis it that the enemy have left the New England provinces, and made these\r\nmiddle ones the seat of war? The answer is easy: New England is not\r\ninfested with Tories, and we are. I have been tender in raising the\r\ncry against these men, and used numberless arguments to show them their\r\ndanger, but it will not do to sacrifice a world either to their folly\r\nor their baseness. The period is now arrived, in which either they or\r\nwe must change our sentiments, or one or both must fall. And what is a\r\nTory? Good God! what is he? I should not be afraid to go with a hundred\r\nWhigs against a thousand Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms.\r\nEvery Tory is a coward; for servile, slavish, self-interested fear is\r\nthe foundation of Toryism; and a man under such influence, though he may\r\nbe cruel, never can be brave.\r\n\r\nBut, before the line of irrecoverable separation be drawn between us,\r\nlet us reason the matter together: Your conduct is an invitation to the\r\nenemy, yet not one in a thousand of you has heart enough to join him.\r\nHowe is as much deceived by you as the American cause is injured by you.\r\nHe expects you will all take up arms, and flock to his standard, with\r\nmuskets on your shoulders. Your opinions are of no use to him, unless\r\nyou support him personally, for 'tis soldiers, and not Tories, that he\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nI once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel, against\r\nthe mean principles that are held by the Tories: a noted one, who kept a\r\ntavern at Amboy, was standing at his door, with as pretty a child in his\r\nhand, about eight or nine years old, as I ever saw, and after speaking\r\nhis mind as freely as he thought was prudent, finished with this\r\nunfatherly expression, \"Well! give me peace in my day.\" Not a man lives\r\non the continent but fully believes that a separation must some time or\r\nother finally take place, and a generous parent should have said, \"If\r\nthere must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have\r\npeace;\" and this single reflection, well applied, is sufficient to\r\nawaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be so happy as\r\nAmerica. Her situation is remote from all the wrangling world, and she\r\nhas nothing to do but to trade with them. A man can distinguish himself\r\nbetween temper and principle, and I am as confident, as I am that God\r\ngoverns the world, that America will never be happy till she gets clear\r\nof foreign dominion. Wars, without ceasing, will break out till that\r\nperiod arrives, and the continent must in the end be conqueror; for\r\nthough the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to shine, the coal can\r\nnever expire.\r\n\r\nAmerica did not, nor does not want force; but she wanted a proper\r\napplication of that force. Wisdom is not the purchase of a day, and it\r\nis no wonder that we should err at the first setting off. From an excess\r\nof tenderness, we were unwilling to raise an army, and trusted our\r\ncause to the temporary defence of a well-meaning militia. A summer's\r\nexperience has now taught us better; yet with those troops, while they\r\nwere collected, we were able to set bounds to the progress of the enemy,\r\nand, thank God! they are again assembling. I always considered militia\r\nas the best troops in the world for a sudden exertion, but they will not\r\ndo for a long campaign. Howe, it is probable, will make an attempt on\r\nthis city [Philadelphia]; should he fail on this side the Delaware, he\r\nis ruined. If he succeeds, our cause is not ruined. He stakes all on his\r\nside against a part on ours; admitting he succeeds, the consequence will\r\nbe, that armies from both ends of the continent will march to assist\r\ntheir suffering friends in the middle states; for he cannot go\r\neverywhere, it is impossible. I consider Howe as the greatest enemy the\r\nTories have; he is bringing a war into their country, which, had it not\r\nbeen for him and partly for themselves, they had been clear of. Should\r\nhe now be expelled, I wish with all the devotion of a Christian, that\r\nthe names of Whig and Tory may never more be mentioned; but should the\r\nTories give him encouragement to come, or assistance if he come, I\r\nas sincerely wish that our next year's arms may expel them from the\r\ncontinent, and the Congress appropriate their possessions to the relief\r\nof those who have suffered in well-doing. A single successful battle\r\nnext year will settle the whole. America could carry on a two years' war\r\nby the confiscation of the property of disaffected persons, and be made\r\nhappy by their expulsion. Say not that this is revenge, call it rather\r\nthe soft resentment of a suffering people, who, having no object in view\r\nbut the good of all, have staked their own all upon a seemingly doubtful\r\nevent. Yet it is folly to argue against determined hardness; eloquence\r\nmay strike the ear, and the language of sorrow draw forth the tear\r\nof compassion, but nothing can reach the heart that is steeled with\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nQuitting this class of men, I turn with the warm ardor of a friend to\r\nthose who have nobly stood, and are yet determined to stand the matter\r\nout: I call not upon a few, but upon all: not on this state or that\r\nstate, but on every state: up and help us; lay your shoulders to the\r\nwheel; better have too much force than too little, when so great an\r\nobject is at stake. Let it be told to the future world, that in the\r\ndepth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that\r\nthe city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to\r\nmeet and to repulse it. Say not that thousands are gone, turn out your\r\ntens of thousands; throw not the burden of the day upon Providence, but\r\n\"show your faith by your works,\" that God may bless you. It matters not\r\nwhere you live, or what rank of life you hold, the evil or the blessing\r\nwill reach you all. The far and the near, the home counties and the\r\nback, the rich and the poor, will suffer or rejoice alike. The heart\r\nthat feels not now is dead; the blood of his children will curse his\r\ncowardice, who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the\r\nwhole, and made them happy. I love the man that can smile in trouble,\r\nthat can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection.\r\n'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm,\r\nand whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles\r\nunto death. My own line of reasoning is to myself as straight and clear\r\nas a ray of light. Not all the treasures of the world, so far as I\r\nbelieve, could have induced me to support an offensive war, for I think\r\nit murder; but if a thief breaks into my house, burns and destroys my\r\nproperty, and kills or threatens to kill me, or those that are in it,\r\nand to \"bind me in all cases whatsoever\" to his absolute will, am I to\r\nsuffer it? What signifies it to me, whether he who does it is a king or\r\na common man; my countryman or not my countryman; whether it be done by\r\nan individual villain, or an army of them? If we reason to the root\r\nof things we shall find no difference; neither can any just cause be\r\nassigned why we should punish in the one case and pardon in the other.\r\nLet them call me rebel and welcome, I feel no concern from it; but I\r\nshould suffer the misery of devils, were I to make a whore of my soul by\r\nswearing allegiance to one whose character is that of a sottish, stupid,\r\nstubborn, worthless, brutish man. I conceive likewise a horrid idea in\r\nreceiving mercy from a being, who at the last day shall be shrieking to\r\nthe rocks and mountains to cover him, and fleeing with terror from the\r\norphan, the widow, and the slain of America.\r\n\r\nThere are cases which cannot be overdone by language, and this is one.\r\nThere are persons, too, who see not the full extent of the evil which\r\nthreatens them; they solace themselves with hopes that the enemy, if he\r\nsucceed, will be merciful. It is the madness of folly, to expect\r\nmercy from those who have refused to do justice; and even mercy, where\r\nconquest is the object, is only a trick of war; the cunning of the\r\nfox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf, and we ought to guard\r\nequally against both. Howe's first object is, partly by threats and\r\npartly by promises, to terrify or seduce the people to deliver up their\r\narms and receive mercy. The ministry recommended the same plan to Gage,\r\nand this is what the tories call making their peace, \"a peace which\r\npasseth all understanding\" indeed! A peace which would be the immediate\r\nforerunner of a worse ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye men of\r\nPennsylvania, do reason upon these things! Were the back counties to\r\ngive up their arms, they would fall an easy prey to the Indians, who are\r\nall armed: this perhaps is what some Tories would not be sorry for. Were\r\nthe home counties to deliver up their arms, they would be exposed to the\r\nresentment of the back counties who would then have it in their power to\r\nchastise their defection at pleasure. And were any one state to give up\r\nits arms, that state must be garrisoned by all Howe's army of Britons\r\nand Hessians to preserve it from the anger of the rest. Mutual fear is\r\nthe principal link in the chain of mutual love, and woe be to that state\r\nthat breaks the compact. Howe is mercifully inviting you to barbarous\r\ndestruction, and men must be either rogues or fools that will not see\r\nit. I dwell not upon the vapors of imagination; I bring reason to your\r\nears, and, in language as plain as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.\r\n\r\nI thank God, that I fear not. I see no real cause for fear. I know\r\nour situation well, and can see the way out of it. While our army was\r\ncollected, Howe dared not risk a battle; and it is no credit to him\r\nthat he decamped from the White Plains, and waited a mean opportunity to\r\nravage the defenceless Jerseys; but it is great credit to us, that, with\r\na handful of men, we sustained an orderly retreat for near an hundred\r\nmiles, brought off our ammunition, all our field pieces, the greatest\r\npart of our stores, and had four rivers to pass. None can say that our\r\nretreat was precipitate, for we were near three weeks in performing it,\r\nthat the country might have time to come in. Twice we marched back to\r\nmeet the enemy, and remained out till dark. The sign of fear was not\r\nseen in our camp, and had not some of the cowardly and disaffected\r\ninhabitants spread false alarms through the country, the Jerseys had\r\nnever been ravaged. Once more we are again collected and collecting; our\r\nnew army at both ends of the continent is recruiting fast, and we shall\r\nbe able to open the next campaign with sixty thousand men, well armed\r\nand clothed. This is our situation, and who will may know it. By\r\nperseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious issue;\r\nby cowardice and submission, the sad choice of a variety of evils--a\r\nravaged country--a depopulated city--habitations without safety, and\r\nslavery without hope--our homes turned into barracks and bawdy-houses\r\nfor Hessians, and a future race to provide for, whose fathers we shall\r\ndoubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet\r\nremains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let him suffer it\r\nunlamented.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nDecember 23, 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS II. TO LORD HOWE.\r\n\r\n            \"What's in the name of lord, that I should fear\r\n              To bring my grievance to the public ear?\"\r\n                                              CHURCHILL.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a writer. His concerns are with\r\nall mankind, and though he cannot command their obedience, he can assign\r\nthem their duty. The Republic of Letters is more ancient than monarchy,\r\nand of far higher character in the world than the vassal court of\r\nBritain; he that rebels against reason is a real rebel, but he that in\r\ndefence of reason rebels against tyranny has a better title to \"Defender\r\nof the Faith,\" than George the Third.\r\n\r\nAs a military man your lordship may hold out the sword of war, and call\r\nit the \"ultima ratio regum\": the last reason of kings; we in return\r\ncan show you the sword of justice, and call it \"the best scourge of\r\ntyrants.\" The first of these two may threaten, or even frighten for a\r\nwhile, and cast a sickly languor over an insulted people, but reason\r\nwill soon recover the debauch, and restore them again to tranquil\r\nfortitude. Your lordship, I find, has now commenced author, and\r\npublished a proclamation; I have published a Crisis. As they stand, they\r\nare the antipodes of each other; both cannot rise at once, and one of\r\nthem must descend; and so quick is the revolution of things, that your\r\nlordship's performance, I see, has already fallen many degrees from\r\nits first place, and is now just visible on the edge of the political\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to what a pitch of infatuation, blind folly and\r\nobstinacy will carry mankind, and your lordship's drowsy proclamation\r\nis a proof that it does not even quit them in their sleep. Perhaps you\r\nthought America too was taking a nap, and therefore chose, like Satan\r\nto Eve, to whisper the delusion softly, lest you should awaken her. This\r\ncontinent, sir, is too extensive to sleep all at once, and too watchful,\r\neven in its slumbers, not to startle at the unhallowed foot of an\r\ninvader. You may issue your proclamations, and welcome, for we have\r\nlearned to \"reverence ourselves,\" and scorn the insulting ruffian that\r\nemploys you. America, for your deceased brother's sake, would gladly\r\nhave shown you respect and it is a new aggravation to her feelings,\r\nthat Howe should be forgetful, and raise his sword against those, who at\r\ntheir own charge raised a monument to his brother. But your master has\r\ncommanded, and you have not enough of nature left to refuse. Surely\r\nthere must be something strangely degenerating in the love of monarchy,\r\nthat can so completely wear a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud\r\nto lick the dust that kings have trod upon. A few more years, should you\r\nsurvive them, will bestow on you the title of \"an old man\": and in some\r\nhour of future reflection you may probably find the fitness of Wolsey's\r\ndespairing penitence--\"had I served my God as faithful as I have served\r\nmy king, he would not thus have forsaken me in my old age.\"\r\n\r\nThe character you appear to us in, is truly ridiculous. Your friends,\r\nthe Tories, announced your coming, with high descriptions of your\r\nunlimited powers; but your proclamation has given them the lie, by\r\nshowing you to be a commissioner without authority. Had your powers been\r\never so great they were nothing to us, further than we pleased; because\r\nwe had the same right which other nations had, to do what we thought\r\nwas best. \"The UNITED STATES of AMERICA,\" will sound as pompously in the\r\nworld or in history, as \"the kingdom of Great Britain\"; the character of\r\nGeneral Washington will fill a page with as much lustre as that of\r\nLord Howe: and the Congress have as much right to command the king and\r\nParliament in London to desist from legislation, as they or you have\r\nto command the Congress. Only suppose how laughable such an edict would\r\nappear from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but turn the tables\r\nupon yourself, and you will see how your proclamation is received here.\r\nHaving thus placed you in a proper position in which you may have a full\r\nview of your folly, and learn to despise it, I hold up to you, for\r\nthat purpose, the following quotation from your own lunarian\r\nproclamation.--\"And we (Lord Howe and General Howe) do command (and in\r\nhis majesty's name forsooth) all such persons as are assembled together,\r\nunder the name of general or provincial congresses, committees,\r\nconventions or other associations, by whatever name or names known and\r\ndistinguished, to desist and cease from all such treasonable actings and\r\ndoings.\"\r\n\r\nYou introduce your proclamation by referring to your declarations of\r\nthe 14th of July and 19th of September. In the last of these you sunk\r\nyourself below the character of a private gentleman. That I may not\r\nseem to accuse you unjustly, I shall state the circumstance: by a verbal\r\ninvitation of yours, communicated to Congress by General Sullivan, then\r\na prisoner on his parole, you signified your desire of conferring with\r\nsome members of that body as private gentlemen. It was beneath the\r\ndignity of the American Congress to pay any regard to a message that\r\nat best was but a genteel affront, and had too much of the ministerial\r\ncomplexion of tampering with private persons; and which might probably\r\nhave been the case, had the gentlemen who were deputed on the business\r\npossessed that kind of easy virtue which an English courtier is so truly\r\ndistinguished by. Your request, however, was complied with, for honest\r\nmen are naturally more tender of their civil than their political fame.\r\nThe interview ended as every sensible man thought it would; for\r\nyour lordship knows, as well as the writer of the Crisis, that it is\r\nimpossible for the King of England to promise the repeal, or even the\r\nrevisal of any acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part, you had\r\nnothing to say, more than to request, in the room of demanding, the\r\nentire surrender of the continent; and then, if that was complied with,\r\nto promise that the inhabitants should escape with their lives. This was\r\nthe upshot of the conference. You informed the conferees that you were\r\ntwo months in soliciting these powers. We ask, what powers? for as\r\ncommissioner you have none. If you mean the power of pardoning, it is\r\nan oblique proof that your master was determined to sacrifice all before\r\nhim; and that you were two months in dissuading him from his purpose.\r\nAnother evidence of his savage obstinacy! From your own account of the\r\nmatter we may justly draw these two conclusions: 1st, That you serve\r\na monster; and 2d, That never was a messenger sent on a more foolish\r\nerrand than yourself. This plain language may perhaps sound uncouthly to\r\nan ear vitiated by courtly refinements, but words were made for use,\r\nand the fault lies in deserving them, or the abuse in applying them\r\nunfairly.\r\n\r\nSoon after your return to New York, you published a very illiberal and\r\nunmanly handbill against the Congress; for it was certainly stepping out\r\nof the line of common civility, first to screen your national pride\r\nby soliciting an interview with them as private gentlemen, and in the\r\nconclusion to endeavor to deceive the multitude by making a handbill\r\nattack on the whole body of the Congress; you got them together under\r\none name, and abused them under another. But the king you serve, and the\r\ncause you support, afford you so few instances of acting the gentleman,\r\nthat out of pity to your situation the Congress pardoned the insult by\r\ntaking no notice of it.\r\n\r\nYou say in that handbill, \"that they, the Congress, disavowed every\r\npurpose for reconciliation not consonant with their extravagant and\r\ninadmissible claim of independence.\" Why, God bless me! what have you to\r\ndo with our independence? We ask no leave of yours to set it up; we ask\r\nno money of yours to support it; we can do better without your fleets\r\nand armies than with them; you may soon have enough to do to protect\r\nyourselves without being burdened with us. We are very willing to be at\r\npeace with you, to buy of you and sell to you, and, like young beginners\r\nin the world, to work for our living; therefore, why do you put\r\nyourselves out of cash, when we know you cannot spare it, and we do not\r\ndesire you to run into debt? I am willing, sir, that you should see\r\nyour folly in every point of view I can place it in, and for that reason\r\ndescend sometimes to tell you in jest what I wish you to see in earnest.\r\nBut to be more serious with you, why do you say, \"their independence?\"\r\nTo set you right, sir, we tell you, that the independency is ours, not\r\ntheirs. The Congress were authorized by every state on the continent to\r\npublish it to all the world, and in so doing are not to be considered as\r\nthe inventors, but only as the heralds that proclaimed it, or the office\r\nfrom which the sense of the people received a legal form; and it was as\r\nmuch as any or all their heads were worth, to have treated with you on\r\nthe subject of submission under any name whatever. But we know the men\r\nin whom we have trusted; can England say the same of her Parliament?\r\n\r\nI come now more particularly to your proclamation of the 30th of\r\nNovember last. Had you gained an entire conquest over all the armies\r\nof America, and then put forth a proclamation, offering (what you call)\r\nmercy, your conduct would have had some specious show of humanity; but\r\nto creep by surprise into a province, and there endeavor to terrify\r\nand seduce the inhabitants from their just allegiance to the rest by\r\npromises, which you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both cruel\r\nand unmanly: cruel in its effects; because, unless you can keep all\r\nthe ground you have marched over, how are you, in the words of your\r\nproclamation, to secure to your proselytes \"the enjoyment of their\r\nproperty?\" What is to become either of your new adopted subjects, or\r\nyour old friends, the Tories, in Burlington, Bordentown, Trenton, Mount\r\nHolly, and many other places, where you proudly lorded it for a few\r\ndays, and then fled with the precipitation of a pursued thief? What, I\r\nsay, is to become of those wretches? What is to become of those who went\r\nover to you from this city and State? What more can you say to them than\r\n\"shift for yourselves?\" Or what more can they hope for than to wander\r\nlike vagabonds over the face of the earth? You may now tell them to take\r\ntheir leave of America, and all that once was theirs. Recommend them,\r\nfor consolation, to your master's court; there perhaps they may make\r\na shift to live on the scraps of some dangling parasite, and choose\r\ncompanions among thousands like themselves. A traitor is the foulest\r\nfiend on earth.\r\n\r\nIn a political sense we ought to thank you for thus bequeathing estates\r\nto the continent; we shall soon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war\r\nwithout expense, and grow rich by the ill policy of Lord Howe, and the\r\ngenerous defection of the Tories. Had you set your foot into this city,\r\nyou would have bestowed estates upon us which we never thought of, by\r\nbringing forth traitors we were unwilling to suspect. But these men,\r\nyou'll say, \"are his majesty's most faithful subjects;\" let that honor,\r\nthen, be all their fortune, and let his majesty take them to himself.\r\n\r\nI am now thoroughly disgusted with them; they live in ungrateful ease,\r\nand bend their whole minds to mischief. It seems as if God had\r\ngiven them over to a spirit of infidelity, and that they are open to\r\nconviction in no other line but that of punishment. It is time to have\r\ndone with tarring, feathering, carting, and taking securities for their\r\nfuture good behavior; every sensible man must feel a conscious shame\r\nat seeing a poor fellow hawked for a show about the streets, when it is\r\nknown he is only the tool of some principal villain, biassed into his\r\noffence by the force of false reasoning, or bribed thereto, through sad\r\nnecessity. We dishonor ourselves by attacking such trifling characters\r\nwhile greater ones are suffered to escape; 'tis our duty to find\r\nthem out, and their proper punishment would be to exile them from the\r\ncontinent for ever. The circle of them is not so great as some imagine;\r\nthe influence of a few have tainted many who are not naturally corrupt.\r\nA continual circulation of lies among those who are not much in the way\r\nof hearing them contradicted, will in time pass for truth; and the crime\r\nlies not in the believer but the inventor. I am not for declaring\r\nwar with every man that appears not so warm as myself: difference of\r\nconstitution, temper, habit of speaking, and many other things, will go\r\na great way in fixing the outward character of a man, yet simple honesty\r\nmay remain at bottom. Some men have naturally a military turn, and can\r\nbrave hardships and the risk of life with a cheerful face; others have\r\nnot; no slavery appears to them so great as the fatigue of arms, and\r\nno terror so powerful as that of personal danger. What can we say? We\r\ncannot alter nature, neither ought we to punish the son because the\r\nfather begot him in a cowardly mood. However, I believe most men have\r\nmore courage than they know of, and that a little at first is enough\r\nto begin with. I knew the time when I thought that the whistling of a\r\ncannon ball would have frightened me almost to death; but I have since\r\ntried it, and find that I can stand it with as little discomposure, and,\r\nI believe, with a much easier conscience than your lordship. The same\r\ndread would return to me again were I in your situation, for my solemn\r\nbelief of your cause is, that it is hellish and damnable, and, under\r\nthat conviction, every thinking man's heart must fail him.\r\n\r\nFrom a concern that a good cause should be dishonored by the least\r\ndisunion among us, I said in my former paper, No. I. \"That should the\r\nenemy now be expelled, I wish, with all the sincerity of a Christian,\r\nthat the names of Whig and Tory might never more be mentioned;\" but\r\nthere is a knot of men among us of such a venomous cast, that they\r\nwill not admit even one's good wishes to act in their favor. Instead\r\nof rejoicing that heaven had, as it were, providentially preserved this\r\ncity from plunder and destruction, by delivering so great a part of the\r\nenemy into our hands with so little effusion of blood, they stubbornly\r\naffected to disbelieve it till within an hour, nay, half an hour, of\r\nthe prisoners arriving; and the Quakers put forth a testimony, dated the\r\n20th of December, signed \"John Pemberton,\" declaring their attachment to\r\nthe British government.* These men are continually harping on the great\r\nsin of our bearing arms, but the king of Britain may lay waste the world\r\nin blood and famine, and they, poor fallen souls, have nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies\r\nof men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown set of\r\nmen, who claim to themselves the right of representing the whole:\r\nand while the whole Society of Quakers admit its validity by a silent\r\nacknowledgment, it is impossible that any distinction can be made by\r\nthe public: and the more so, because the New York paper of the 30th of\r\nDecember, printed by permission of our enemies, says that \"the Quakers\r\nbegin to speak openly of their attachment to the British Constitution.\"\r\nWe are certain that we have many friends among them, and wish to know\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn some future paper I intend to distinguish between the different kind\r\nof persons who have been denominated Tories; for this I am clear in,\r\nthat all are not so who have been called so, nor all men Whigs who\r\nwere once thought so; and as I mean not to conceal the name of any true\r\nfriend when there shall be occasion to mention him, neither will I that\r\nof an enemy, who ought to be known, let his rank, station or religion be\r\nwhat it may. Much pains have been taken by some to set your lordship's\r\nprivate character in an amiable light, but as it has chiefly been done\r\nby men who know nothing about you, and who are no ways remarkable for\r\ntheir attachment to us, we have no just authority for believing it.\r\nGeorge the Third has imposed upon us by the same arts, but time, at\r\nlength, has done him justice, and the same fate may probably attend your\r\nlordship. You avowed purpose here is to kill, conquer, plunder, pardon,\r\nand enslave: and the ravages of your army through the Jerseys have been\r\nmarked with as much barbarism as if you had openly professed yourself\r\nthe prince of ruffians; not even the appearance of humanity has been\r\npreserved either on the march or the retreat of your troops; no general\r\norder that I could ever learn, has ever been issued to prevent or\r\neven forbid your troops from robbery, wherever they came, and the only\r\ninstance of justice, if it can be called such, which has distinguished\r\nyou for impartiality, is, that you treated and plundered all alike; what\r\ncould not be carried away has been destroyed, and mahogany furniture has\r\nbeen deliberately laid on fire for fuel, rather than the men should be\r\nfatigued with cutting wood.* There was a time when the Whigs confided\r\nmuch in your supposed candor, and the Tories rested themselves in your\r\nfavor; the experiments have now been made, and failed; in every town,\r\nnay, every cottage, in the Jerseys, where your arms have been, is\r\na testimony against you. How you may rest under this sacrifice of\r\ncharacter I know not; but this I know, that you sleep and rise with the\r\ndaily curses of thousands upon you; perhaps the misery which the Tories\r\nhave suffered by your proffered mercy may give them some claim to their\r\ncountry's pity, and be in the end the best favor you could show them.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * As some people may doubt the truth of such wanton destruction, I\r\nthink it necessary to inform them that one of the people called Quakers,\r\nwho lives at Trenton, gave me this information at the house of Mr.\r\nMichael Hutchinson, (one of the same profession,) who lives near Trenton\r\nferry on the Pennsylvania side, Mr. Hutchinson being present.\r\n\r\nIn a folio general-order book belonging to Col. Rhal's battalion, taken\r\nat Trenton, and now in the possession of the council of safety for\r\nthis state, the following barbarous order is frequently repeated, \"His\r\nexcellency the Commander-in-Chief orders, that all inhabitants who\r\nshall be found with arms, not having an officer with them, shall be\r\nimmediately taken and hung up.\" How many you may thus have privately\r\nsacrificed, we know not, and the account can only be settled in another\r\nworld. Your treatment of prisoners, in order to distress them to enlist\r\nin your infernal service, is not to be equalled by any instance in\r\nEurope. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe and his brother, whom the\r\nTories and their three-quarter kindred, the Quakers, or some of them at\r\nleast, have been holding up for patterns of justice and mercy!\r\n\r\nA bad cause will ever be supported by bad means and bad men; and whoever\r\nwill be at the pains of examining strictly into things, will find that\r\none and the same spirit of oppression and impiety, more or less,\r\ngoverns through your whole party in both countries: not many days ago,\r\nI accidentally fell in company with a person of this city noted for\r\nespousing your cause, and on my remarking to him, \"that it appeared\r\nclear to me, by the late providential turn of affairs, that God Almighty\r\nwas visibly on our side,\" he replied, \"We care nothing for that you may\r\nhave Him, and welcome; if we have but enough of the devil on our side,\r\nwe shall do.\" However carelessly this might be spoken, matters not, 'tis\r\nstill the insensible principle that directs all your conduct and will at\r\nlast most assuredly deceive and ruin you.\r\n\r\nIf ever a nation was made and foolish, blind to its own interest and\r\nbent on its own destruction, it is Britain. There are such things as\r\nnational sins, and though the punishment of individuals may be reserved\r\nto another world, national punishment can only be inflicted in this\r\nworld. Britain, as a nation, is, in my inmost belief, the greatest and\r\nmost ungrateful offender against God on the face of the whole earth.\r\nBlessed with all the commerce she could wish for, and furnished, by\r\na vast extension of dominion, with the means of civilizing both the\r\neastern and western world, she has made no other use of both than\r\nproudly to idolize her own \"thunder,\" and rip up the bowels of whole\r\ncountries for what she could get. Like Alexander, she has made war her\r\nsport, and inflicted misery for prodigality's sake. The blood of India\r\nis not yet repaid, nor the wretchedness of Africa yet requited. Of\r\nlate she has enlarged her list of national cruelties by her butcherly\r\ndestruction of the Caribbs of St. Vincent's, and returning an answer by\r\nthe sword to the meek prayer for \"Peace, liberty and safety.\" These\r\nare serious things, and whatever a foolish tyrant, a debauched court,\r\na trafficking legislature, or a blinded people may think, the national\r\naccount with heaven must some day or other be settled: all countries\r\nhave sooner or later been called to their reckoning; the proudest\r\nempires have sunk when the balance was struck; and Britain, like an\r\nindividual penitent, must undergo her day of sorrow, and the sooner it\r\nhappens to her the better. As I wish it over, I wish it to come, but\r\nwithal wish that it may be as light as possible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your lordship has no taste for serious things; by your\r\nconnections in England I should suppose not; therefore I shall drop this\r\npart of the subject, and take it up in a line in which you will better\r\nunderstand me.\r\n\r\nBy what means, may I ask, do you expect to conquer America? If you could\r\nnot effect it in the summer, when our army was less than yours, nor\r\nin the winter, when we had none, how are you to do it? In point of\r\ngeneralship you have been outwitted, and in point of fortitude outdone;\r\nyour advantages turn out to your loss, and show us that it is in our\r\npower to ruin you by gifts: like a game of drafts, we can move out of\r\none square to let you come in, in order that we may afterwards take\r\ntwo or three for one; and as we can always keep a double corner for\r\nourselves, we can always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be so\r\ninsensible as not to see that we have two to one the advantage of you,\r\nbecause we conquer by a drawn game, and you lose by it. Burgoyne might\r\nhave taught your lordship this knowledge; he has been long a student in\r\nthe doctrine of chances.\r\n\r\nI have no other idea of conquering countries than by subduing the armies\r\nwhich defend them: have you done this, or can you do it? If you have\r\nnot, it would be civil in you to let your proclamations alone for the\r\npresent; otherwise, you will ruin more Tories by your grace and favor,\r\nthan you will Whigs by your arms.\r\n\r\nWere you to obtain possession of this city, you would not know what to\r\ndo with it more than to plunder it. To hold it in the manner you hold\r\nNew York, would be an additional dead weight upon your hands; and if a\r\ngeneral conquest is your object, you had better be without the city than\r\nwith it. When you have defeated all our armies, the cities will fall\r\ninto your hands of themselves; but to creep into them in the manner you\r\ngot into Princeton, Trenton, &c. is like robbing an orchard in the\r\nnight before the fruit be ripe, and running away in the morning. Your\r\nexperiment in the Jerseys is sufficient to teach you that you have\r\nsomething more to do than barely to get into other people's houses; and\r\nyour new converts, to whom you promised all manner of protection, and\r\nseduced into new guilt by pardoning them from their former virtues, must\r\nbegin to have a very contemptible opinion both of your power and your\r\npolicy. Your authority in the Jerseys is now reduced to the small circle\r\nwhich your army occupies, and your proclamation is no where else seen\r\nunless it be to be laughed at. The mighty subduers of the continent have\r\nretreated into a nutshell, and the proud forgivers of our sins are fled\r\nfrom those they came to pardon; and all this at a time when they were\r\ndespatching vessel after vessel to England with the great news of\r\nevery day. In short, you have managed your Jersey expedition so very\r\ndexterously, that the dead only are conquerors, because none will\r\ndispute the ground with them.\r\n\r\nIn all the wars which you have formerly been concerned in you had only\r\narmies to contend with; in this case you have both an army and a country\r\nto combat with. In former wars, the countries followed the fate of their\r\ncapitals; Canada fell with Quebec, and Minorca with Port Mahon or St.\r\nPhillips; by subduing those, the conquerors opened a way into, and\r\nbecame masters of the country: here it is otherwise; if you get\r\npossession of a city here, you are obliged to shut yourselves up in it,\r\nand can make no other use of it, than to spend your country's money in.\r\nThis is all the advantage you have drawn from New York; and you would\r\ndraw less from Philadelphia, because it requires more force to keep it,\r\nand is much further from the sea. A pretty figure you and the Tories\r\nwould cut in this city, with a river full of ice, and a town full of\r\nfire; for the immediate consequence of your getting here would be, that\r\nyou would be cannonaded out again, and the Tories be obliged to make\r\ngood the damage; and this sooner or later will be the fate of New York.\r\n\r\nI wish to see the city saved, not so much from military as from natural\r\nmotives. 'Tis the hiding place of women and children, and Lord Howe's\r\nproper business is with our armies. When I put all the circumstances\r\ntogether which ought to be taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering\r\nAmerica. Because you lived in a little country, where an army might run\r\nover the whole in a few days, and where a single company of soldiers\r\nmight put a multitude to the rout, you expected to find it the same\r\nhere. It is plain that you brought over with you all the narrow notions\r\nyou were bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation in the king's\r\nname was to do great things; but Englishmen always travel for knowledge,\r\nand your lordship, I hope, will return, if you return at all, much wiser\r\nthan you came.\r\n\r\nWe may be surprised by events we did not expect, and in that interval of\r\nrecollection you may gain some temporary advantage: such was the case\r\na few weeks ago, but we soon ripen again into reason, collect our\r\nstrength, and while you are preparing for a triumph, we come upon you\r\nwith a defeat. Such it has been, and such it would be were you to try\r\nit a hundred times over. Were you to garrison the places you might march\r\nover, in order to secure their subjection, (for remember you can do it\r\nby no other means,) your army would be like a stream of water running to\r\nnothing. By the time you extended from New York to Virginia, you would\r\nbe reduced to a string of drops not capable of hanging together; while\r\nwe, by retreating from State to State, like a river turning back upon\r\nitself, would acquire strength in the same proportion as you lost it,\r\nand in the end be capable of overwhelming you. The country, in the\r\nmeantime, would suffer, but it is a day of suffering, and we ought\r\nto expect it. What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go\r\nthrough. If we get but bread to eat, and any kind of raiment to put on,\r\nwe ought not only to be contented, but thankful. More than that we ought\r\nnot to look for, and less than that heaven has not yet suffered us\r\nto want. He that would sell his birthright for a little salt, is as\r\nworthless as he who sold it for pottage without salt; and he that would\r\npart with it for a gay coat, or a plain coat, ought for ever to be\r\na slave in buff. What are salt, sugar and finery, to the inestimable\r\nblessings of \"Liberty and Safety!\" Or what are the inconveniences of\r\na few months to the tributary bondage of ages? The meanest peasant in\r\nAmerica, blessed with these sentiments, is a happy man compared with a\r\nNew York Tory; he can eat his morsel without repining, and when he has\r\ndone, can sweeten it with a repast of wholesome air; he can take his\r\nchild by the hand and bless it, without feeling the conscious shame of\r\nneglecting a parent's duty.\r\n\r\nIn publishing these remarks I have several objects in view.\r\n\r\nOn your part they are to expose the folly of your pretended authority\r\nas a commissioner; the wickedness of your cause in general; and the\r\nimpossibility of your conquering us at any rate. On the part of the\r\npublic, my intention is, to show them their true and sold interest;\r\nto encourage them to their own good, to remove the fears and falsities\r\nwhich bad men have spread, and weak men have encouraged; and to excite\r\nin all men a love for union, and a cheerfulness for duty.\r\n\r\nI shall submit one more case to you respecting your conquest of this\r\ncountry, and then proceed to new observations.\r\n\r\nSuppose our armies in every part of this continent were immediately to\r\ndisperse, every man to his home, or where else he might be safe, and\r\nengage to reassemble again on a certain future day; it is clear that you\r\nwould then have no army to contend with, yet you would be as much at\r\na loss in that case as you are now; you would be afraid to send your\r\ntroops in parties over to the continent, either to disarm or prevent us\r\nfrom assembling, lest they should not return; and while you kept them\r\ntogether, having no arms of ours to dispute with, you could not call it\r\na conquest; you might furnish out a pompous page in the London Gazette\r\nor a New York paper, but when we returned at the appointed time, you\r\nwould have the same work to do that you had at first.\r\n\r\nIt has been the folly of Britain to suppose herself more powerful than\r\nshe really is, and by that means has arrogated to herself a rank in the\r\nworld she is not entitled to: for more than this century past she\r\nhas not been able to carry on a war without foreign assistance. In\r\nMarlborough's campaigns, and from that day to this, the number of German\r\ntroops and officers assisting her have been about equal with her own;\r\nten thousand Hessians were sent to England last war to protect her\r\nfrom a French invasion; and she would have cut but a poor figure in her\r\nCanadian and West Indian expeditions, had not America been lavish both\r\nof her money and men to help her along. The only instance in which she\r\nwas engaged singly, that I can recollect, was against the rebellion in\r\nScotland, in the years 1745 and 1746, and in that, out of three battles,\r\nshe was twice beaten, till by thus reducing their numbers, (as we\r\nshall yours) and taking a supply ship that was coming to Scotland\r\nwith clothes, arms and money, (as we have often done,) she was at last\r\nenabled to defeat them. England was never famous by land; her officers\r\nhave generally been suspected of cowardice, have more of the air of a\r\ndancing-master than a soldier, and by the samples which we have taken\r\nprisoners, we give the preference to ourselves. Her strength, of late,\r\nhas lain in her extravagance; but as her finances and credit are now\r\nlow, her sinews in that line begin to fail fast. As a nation she is the\r\npoorest in Europe; for were the whole kingdom, and all that is in it, to\r\nbe put up for sale like the estate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as\r\nmuch as she owes; yet this thoughtless wretch must go to war, and with\r\nthe avowed design, too, of making us beasts of burden, to support her in\r\nriot and debauchery, and to assist her afterwards in distressing those\r\nnations who are now our best friends. This ingratitude may suit a Tory,\r\nor the unchristian peevishness of a fallen Quaker, but none else.\r\n\r\n'Tis the unhappy temper of the English to be pleased with any war, right\r\nor wrong, be it but successful; but they soon grow discontented with ill\r\nfortune, and it is an even chance that they are as clamorous for peace\r\nnext summer, as the king and his ministers were for war last winter.\r\nIn this natural view of things, your lordship stands in a very critical\r\nsituation: your whole character is now staked upon your laurels; if they\r\nwither, you wither with them; if they flourish, you cannot live long to\r\nlook at them; and at any rate, the black account hereafter is not far\r\noff. What lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only blessings in\r\ndisguise; and the seeming advantages on your side have turned out to\r\nour profit. Even our loss of this city, as far as we can see, might be a\r\nprincipal gain to us: the more surface you spread over, the thinner\r\nyou will be, and the easier wiped away; and our consolation under that\r\napparent disaster would be, that the estates of the Tories would become\r\nsecurities for the repairs. In short, there is no old ground we can fail\r\nupon, but some new foundation rises again to support us. \"We have put,\r\nsir, our hands to the plough, and cursed be he that looketh back.\"\r\n\r\nYour king, in his speech to parliament last spring, declared, \"That\r\nhe had no doubt but the great force they had enabled him to send to\r\nAmerica, would effectually reduce the rebellious colonies.\" It has not,\r\nneither can it; but it has done just enough to lay the foundation of\r\nits own next year's ruin. You are sensible that you left England in a\r\ndivided, distracted state of politics, and, by the command you had here,\r\nyou became a principal prop in the court party; their fortunes rest on\r\nyours; by a single express you can fix their value with the public, and\r\nthe degree to which their spirits shall rise or fall; they are in your\r\nhands as stock, and you have the secret of the alley with you. Thus\r\nsituated and connected, you become the unintentional mechanical\r\ninstrument of your own and their overthrow. The king and his ministers\r\nput conquest out of doubt, and the credit of both depended on the proof.\r\nTo support them in the interim, it was necessary that you should make\r\nthe most of every thing, and we can tell by Hugh Gaine's New York\r\npaper what the complexion of the London Gazette is. With such a list\r\nof victories the nation cannot expect you will ask new supplies; and\r\nto confess your want of them would give the lie to your triumphs, and\r\nimpeach the king and his ministers of treasonable deception. If you make\r\nthe necessary demand at home, your party sinks; if you make it not, you\r\nsink yourself; to ask it now is too late, and to ask it before was too\r\nsoon, and unless it arrive quickly will be of no use. In short, the part\r\nyou have to act, cannot be acted; and I am fully persuaded that all you\r\nhave to trust to is, to do the best you can with what force you have\r\ngot, or little more. Though we have greatly exceeded you in point of\r\ngeneralship and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we have not entered\r\ninto the full soul of enterprise; for I, who know England and the\r\ndisposition of the people well, am confident, that it is easier for us\r\nto effect a revolution there, than you a conquest here; a few thousand\r\nmen landed in England with the declared design of deposing the present\r\nking, bringing his ministers to trial, and setting up the Duke of\r\nGloucester in his stead, would assuredly carry their point, while you\r\nare grovelling here, ignorant of the matter. As I send all my papers to\r\nEngland, this, like Common Sense, will find its way there; and though\r\nit may put one party on their guard, it will inform the other, and the\r\nnation in general, of our design to help them.\r\n\r\nThus far, sir, I have endeavored to give you a picture of present\r\naffairs: you may draw from it what conclusions you please. I wish\r\nas well to the true prosperity of England as you can, but I consider\r\nINDEPENDENCE as America's natural right and interest, and never could\r\nsee any real disservice it would be to Britain. If an English merchant\r\nreceives an order, and is paid for it, it signifies nothing to him who\r\ngoverns the country. This is my creed of politics. If I have any where\r\nexpressed myself over-warmly, 'tis from a fixed, immovable hatred I\r\nhave, and ever had, to cruel men and cruel measures. I have likewise an\r\naversion to monarchy, as being too debasing to the dignity of man; but\r\nI never troubled others with my notions till very lately, nor ever\r\npublished a syllable in England in my life. What I write is pure nature,\r\nand my pen and my soul have ever gone together. My writings I have\r\nalways given away, reserving only the expense of printing and paper, and\r\nsometimes not even that. I never courted either fame or interest, and my\r\nmanner of life, to those who know it, will justify what I say. My study\r\nis to be useful, and if your lordship loves mankind as well as I do,\r\nyou would, seeing you cannot conquer us, cast about and lend your hand\r\ntowards accomplishing a peace. Our independence with God's blessing\r\nwe will maintain against all the world; but as we wish to avoid\r\nevil ourselves, we wish not to inflict it on others. I am never\r\nover-inquisitive into the secrets of the cabinet, but I have some notion\r\nthat, if you neglect the present opportunity, it will not be in our\r\npower to make a separate peace with you afterwards; for whatever\r\ntreaties or alliances we form, we shall most faithfully abide by;\r\nwherefore you may be deceived if you think you can make it with us at\r\nany time. A lasting independent peace is my wish, end and aim; and to\r\naccomplish that, I pray God the Americans may never be defeated, and I\r\ntrust while they have good officers, and are well commanded, and willing\r\nto be commanded, that they NEVER WILL BE.\r\n\r\n                                     COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 13, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS III. (IN THE PROGRESS OF POLITICS)\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE progress of politics, as in the common occurrences of life,\r\nwe are not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over, but\r\nfrequently neglect to gather up experience as we go. We expend, if I may\r\nso say, the knowledge of every day on the circumstances that produce it,\r\nand journey on in search of new matter and new refinements: but as it is\r\npleasant and sometimes useful to look back, even to the first periods of\r\ninfancy, and trace the turns and windings through which we have passed,\r\nso we may likewise derive many advantages by halting a while in our\r\npolitical career, and taking a review of the wondrous complicated\r\nlabyrinth of little more than yesterday.\r\n\r\nTruly may we say, that never did men grow old in so short a time! We\r\nhave crowded the business of an age into the compass of a few months,\r\nand have been driven through such a rapid succession of things, that\r\nfor the want of leisure to think, we unavoidably wasted knowledge as we\r\ncame, and have left nearly as much behind us as we brought with us: but\r\nthe road is yet rich with the fragments, and, before we finally lose\r\nsight of them, will repay us for the trouble of stopping to pick them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nWere a man to be totally deprived of memory, he would be incapable of\r\nforming any just opinion; every thing about him would seem a chaos:\r\nhe would have even his own history to ask from every one; and by not\r\nknowing how the world went in his absence, he would be at a loss to\r\nknow how it ought to go on when he recovered, or rather, returned to it\r\nagain. In like manner, though in a less degree, a too great inattention\r\nto past occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in everything;\r\nwhile, on the contrary, by comparing what is past with what is present,\r\nwe frequently hit on the true character of both, and become wise with\r\nvery little trouble. It is a kind of counter-march, by which we get into\r\nthe rear of time, and mark the movements and meaning of things as we\r\nmake our return. There are certain circumstances, which, at the time\r\nof their happening, are a kind of riddles, and as every riddle is to be\r\nfollowed by its answer, so those kind of circumstances will be followed\r\nby their events, and those events are always the true solution. A\r\nconsiderable space of time may lapse between, and unless we continue our\r\nobservations from the one to the other, the harmony of them will pass\r\naway unnoticed: but the misfortune is, that partly from the pressing\r\nnecessity of some instant things, and partly from the impatience of our\r\nown tempers, we are frequently in such a hurry to make out the meaning\r\nof everything as fast as it happens, that we thereby never truly\r\nunderstand it; and not only start new difficulties to ourselves by so\r\ndoing, but, as it were, embarrass Providence in her good designs.\r\n\r\nI have been civil in stating this fault on a large scale, for, as it now\r\nstands, it does not appear to be levelled against any particular set of\r\nmen; but were it to be refined a little further, it might afterwards\r\nbe applied to the Tories with a degree of striking propriety: those men\r\nhave been remarkable for drawing sudden conclusions from single facts.\r\nThe least apparent mishap on our side, or the least seeming advantage\r\non the part of the enemy, have determined with them the fate of a whole\r\ncampaign. By this hasty judgment they have converted a retreat into\r\na defeat; mistook generalship for error; while every little advantage\r\npurposely given the enemy, either to weaken their strength by dividing\r\nit, embarrass their councils by multiplying their objects, or to secure\r\na greater post by the surrender of a less, has been instantly magnified\r\ninto a conquest. Thus, by quartering ill policy upon ill principles,\r\nthey have frequently promoted the cause they designed to injure, and\r\ninjured that which they intended to promote.\r\n\r\nIt is probable the campaign may open before this number comes from\r\nthe press. The enemy have long lain idle, and amused themselves with\r\ncarrying on the war by proclamations only. While they continue their\r\ndelay our strength increases, and were they to move to action now, it\r\nis a circumstantial proof that they have no reinforcement coming;\r\nwherefore, in either case, the comparative advantage will be ours. Like\r\na wounded, disabled whale, they want only time and room to die in; and\r\nthough in the agony of their exit, it may be unsafe to live within the\r\nflapping of their tail, yet every hour shortens their date, and lessens\r\ntheir power of mischief. If any thing happens while this number is in\r\nthe press, it will afford me a subject for the last pages of it. At\r\npresent I am tired of waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor the state\r\nof politics have yet produced any thing new, I am thereby left in\r\nthe field of general matter, undirected by any striking or particular\r\nobject. This Crisis, therefore, will be made up rather of variety than\r\nnovelty, and consist more of things useful than things wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe success of the cause, the union of the people, and the means of\r\nsupporting and securing both, are points which cannot be too much\r\nattended to. He who doubts of the former is a desponding coward, and\r\nhe who wilfully disturbs the latter is a traitor. Their characters are\r\neasily fixed, and under these short descriptions I leave them for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest degrees of sentimental union which America ever\r\nknew, was in denying the right of the British parliament \"to bind the\r\ncolonies in all cases whatsoever.\" The Declaration is, in its form, an\r\nalmighty one, and is the loftiest stretch of arbitrary power that ever\r\none set of men or one country claimed over another. Taxation was\r\nnothing more than the putting the declared right into practice; and\r\nthis failing, recourse was had to arms, as a means to establish both\r\nthe right and the practice, or to answer a worse purpose, which will be\r\nmentioned in the course of this number. And in order to repay themselves\r\nthe expense of an army, and to profit by their own injustice, the\r\ncolonies were, by another law, declared to be in a state of actual\r\nrebellion, and of consequence all property therein would fall to the\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nThe colonies, on their part, first, denied the right; secondly, they\r\nsuspended the use of taxable articles, and petitioned against the\r\npractice of taxation: and these failing, they, thirdly, defended their\r\nproperty by force, as soon as it was forcibly invaded, and, in answer\r\nto the declaration of rebellion and non-protection, published their\r\nDeclaration of Independence and right of self-protection.\r\n\r\nThese, in a few words, are the different stages of the quarrel; and the\r\nparts are so intimately and necessarily connected with each other as to\r\nadmit of no separation. A person, to use a trite phrase, must be a\r\nWhig or a Tory in a lump. His feelings, as a man, may be wounded; his\r\ncharity, as a Christian, may be moved; but his political principles must\r\ngo through all the cases on one side or the other. He cannot be a Whig\r\nin this stage, and a Tory in that. If he says he is against the united\r\nindependence of the continent, he is to all intents and purposes against\r\nher in all the rest; because this last comprehends the whole. And he may\r\njust as well say, that Britain was right in declaring us rebels; right\r\nin taxing us; and right in declaring her \"right to bind the colonies in\r\nall cases whatsoever.\" It signifies nothing what neutral ground, of his\r\nown creating, he may skulk upon for shelter, for the quarrel in no\r\nstage of it hath afforded any such ground; and either we or Britain are\r\nabsolutely right or absolutely wrong through the whole.\r\n\r\nBritain, like a gamester nearly ruined, has now put all her losses into\r\none bet, and is playing a desperate game for the total. If she wins\r\nit, she wins from me my life; she wins the continent as the forfeited\r\nproperty of rebels; the right of taxing those that are left as reduced\r\nsubjects; and the power of binding them slaves: and the single die\r\nwhich determines this unparalleled event is, whether we support our\r\nindependence or she overturn it. This is coming to the point at once.\r\nHere is the touchstone to try men by. He that is not a supporter of the\r\nindependent States of America in the same degree that his religious and\r\npolitical principles would suffer him to support the government of any\r\nother country, of which he called himself a subject, is, in the American\r\nsense of the word, A TORY; and the instant that he endeavors to bring\r\nhis toryism into practice, he becomes A TRAITOR. The first can only be\r\ndetected by a general test, and the law hath already provided for the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIt is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who would root up our\r\nindependence to have any share in our legislation, either as electors\r\nor representatives; because the support of our independence rests, in\r\na great measure, on the vigor and purity of our public bodies. Would\r\nBritain, even in time of peace, much less in war, suffer an election to\r\nbe carried by men who professed themselves to be not her subjects, or\r\nallow such to sit in Parliament? Certainly not.\r\n\r\nBut there are a certain species of Tories with whom conscience or\r\nprinciple has nothing to do, and who are so from avarice only. Some\r\nof the first fortunes on the continent, on the part of the Whigs, are\r\nstaked on the issue of our present measures. And shall disaffection only\r\nbe rewarded with security? Can any thing be a greater inducement to a\r\nmiserly man, than the hope of making his Mammon safe? And though the\r\nscheme be fraught with every character of folly, yet, so long as he\r\nsupposes, that by doing nothing materially criminal against America\r\non one part, and by expressing his private disapprobation against\r\nindependence, as palliative with the enemy, on the other part, he stands\r\nin a safe line between both; while, I say, this ground be suffered to\r\nremain, craft, and the spirit of avarice, will point it out, and men\r\nwill not be wanting to fill up this most contemptible of all characters.\r\n\r\nThese men, ashamed to own the sordid cause from whence their\r\ndisaffection springs, add thereby meanness to meanness, by endeavoring\r\nto shelter themselves under the mask of hypocrisy; that is, they had\r\nrather be thought to be Tories from some kind of principle, than Tories\r\nby having no principle at all. But till such time as they can show\r\nsome real reason, natural, political, or conscientious, on which their\r\nobjections to independence are founded, we are not obliged to give them\r\ncredit for being Tories of the first stamp, but must set them down as\r\nTories of the last.\r\n\r\nIn the second number of the Crisis, I endeavored to show the\r\nimpossibility of the enemy's making any conquest of America, that\r\nnothing was wanting on our part but patience and perseverance, and\r\nthat, with these virtues, our success, as far as human speculation could\r\ndiscern, seemed as certain as fate. But as there are many among us, who,\r\ninfluenced by others, have regularly gone back from the principles\r\nthey once held, in proportion as we have gone forward; and as it is the\r\nunfortunate lot of many a good man to live within the neighborhood of\r\ndisaffected ones; I shall, therefore, for the sake of confirming the one\r\nand recovering the other, endeavor, in the space of a page or two, to go\r\nover some of the leading principles in support of independence. It is a\r\nmuch pleasanter task to prevent vice than to punish it, and, however our\r\ntempers may be gratified by resentment, or our national expenses eased\r\nby forfeited estates, harmony and friendship is, nevertheless, the\r\nhappiest condition a country can be blessed with.\r\n\r\nThe principal arguments in support of independence may be comprehended\r\nunder the four following heads.\r\n\r\n     1st, The natural right of the continent to independence.\r\n     2d, Her interest in being independent.\r\n     3d, The necessity,--and\r\n     4th, The moral advantages arising therefrom.\r\n\r\nI. The natural right of the continent to independence, is a point which\r\nnever yet was called in question. It will not even admit of a debate.\r\nTo deny such a right, would be a kind of atheism against nature: and the\r\nbest answer to such an objection would be, \"The fool hath said in his\r\nheart there is no God.\"\r\n\r\nII. The interest of the continent in being independent is a point as\r\nclearly right as the former. America, by her own internal industry,\r\nand unknown to all the powers of Europe, was, at the beginning of the\r\ndispute, arrived at a pitch of greatness, trade and population, beyond\r\nwhich it was the interest of Britain not to suffer her to pass, lest she\r\nshould grow too powerful to be kept subordinate. She began to view\r\nthis country with the same uneasy malicious eye, with which a covetous\r\nguardian would view his ward, whose estate he had been enriching himself\r\nby for twenty years, and saw him just arriving at manhood. And America\r\nowes no more to Britain for her present maturity, than the ward would\r\nto the guardian for being twenty-one years of age. That America hath\r\nflourished at the time she was under the government of Britain, is\r\ntrue; but there is every natural reason to believe, that had she been an\r\nindependent country from the first settlement thereof, uncontrolled by\r\nany foreign power, free to make her own laws, regulate and encourage her\r\nown commerce, she had by this time been of much greater worth than now.\r\nThe case is simply this: the first settlers in the different colonies\r\nwere left to shift for themselves, unnoticed and unsupported by any\r\nEuropean government; but as the tyranny and persecution of the old world\r\ndaily drove numbers to the new, and as, by the favor of heaven on their\r\nindustry and perseverance, they grew into importance, so, in a like\r\ndegree, they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes of Europe.\r\nIt was impossible, in this state of infancy, however thriving and\r\npromising, that they could resist the power of any armed invader that\r\nshould seek to bring them under his authority. In this situation,\r\nBritain thought it worth her while to claim them, and the continent\r\nreceived and acknowledged the claimer. It was, in reality, of no very\r\ngreat importance who was her master, seeing, that from the force and\r\nambition of the different powers of Europe, she must, till she acquired\r\nstrength enough to assert her own right, acknowledge some one. As well,\r\nperhaps, Britain as another; and it might have been as well to have been\r\nunder the states of Holland as any. The same hopes of engrossing and\r\nprofiting by her trade, by not oppressing it too much, would have\r\noperated alike with any master, and produced to the colonies the same\r\neffects. The clamor of protection, likewise, was all a farce; because,\r\nin order to make that protection necessary, she must first, by her own\r\nquarrels, create us enemies. Hard terms indeed!\r\n\r\nTo know whether it be the interest of the continent to be independent,\r\nwe need only ask this easy, simple question: Is it the interest of a man\r\nto be a boy all his life? The answer to one will be the answer to both.\r\nAmerica hath been one continued scene of legislative contention from\r\nthe first king's representative to the last; and this was unavoidably\r\nfounded in the natural opposition of interest between the old country\r\nand the new. A governor sent from England, or receiving his authority\r\ntherefrom, ought never to have been considered in any other light\r\nthan that of a genteel commissioned spy, whose private business was\r\ninformation, and his public business a kind of civilized oppression. In\r\nthe first of these characters he was to watch the tempers, sentiments,\r\nand disposition of the people, the growth of trade, and the increase of\r\nprivate fortunes; and, in the latter, to suppress all such acts of the\r\nassemblies, however beneficial to the people, which did not directly\r\nor indirectly throw some increase of power or profit into the hands of\r\nthose that sent him.\r\n\r\nAmerica, till now, could never be called a free country, because her\r\nlegislation depended on the will of a man three thousand miles distant,\r\nwhose interest was in opposition to ours, and who, by a single \"no,\"\r\ncould forbid what law he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of trade, likewise, is, to a trading country, an article of\r\nsuch importance, that the principal source of wealth depends upon it;\r\nand it is impossible that any country can flourish, as it otherwise\r\nmight do, whose commerce is engrossed, cramped and fettered by the\r\nlaws and mandates of another--yet these evils, and more than I can here\r\nenumerate, the continent has suffered by being under the government of\r\nEngland. By an independence we clear the whole at once--put\r\nan end to the business of unanswered petitions and fruitless\r\nremonstrances--exchange Britain for Europe--shake hands with the\r\nworld--live at peace with the world--and trade to any market where we\r\ncan buy and sell.\r\n\r\nIII. The necessity, likewise, of being independent, even before it was\r\ndeclared, became so evident and important, that the continent ran the\r\nrisk of being ruined every day that she delayed it. There was reason to\r\nbelieve that Britain would endeavor to make an European matter of it,\r\nand, rather than lose the whole, would dismember it, like Poland, and\r\ndispose of her several claims to the highest bidder. Genoa, failing in\r\nher attempts to reduce Corsica, made a sale of it to the French, and\r\nsuch trafficks have been common in the old world. We had at that time no\r\nambassador in any part of Europe, to counteract her negotiations, and\r\nby that means she had the range of every foreign court uncontradicted\r\non our part. We even knew nothing of the treaty for the Hessians till it\r\nwas concluded, and the troops ready to embark. Had we been independent\r\nbefore, we had probably prevented her obtaining them. We had no credit\r\nabroad, because of our rebellious dependency. Our ships could claim no\r\nprotection in foreign ports, because we afforded them no justifiable\r\nreason for granting it to us. The calling ourselves subjects, and at\r\nthe same time fighting against the power which we acknowledged, was\r\na dangerous precedent to all Europe. If the grievances justified the\r\ntaking up arms, they justified our separation; if they did not justify\r\nour separation, neither could they justify our taking up arms. All\r\nEurope was interested in reducing us as rebels, and all Europe (or the\r\ngreatest part at least) is interested in supporting us as independent\r\nStates. At home our condition was still worse: our currency had no\r\nfoundation, and the fall of it would have ruined Whig and Tory alike. We\r\nhad no other law than a kind of moderated passion; no other civil\r\npower than an honest mob; and no other protection than the temporary\r\nattachment of one man to another. Had independence been delayed a few\r\nmonths longer, this continent would have been plunged into irrecoverable\r\nconfusion: some violent for it, some against it, till, in the general\r\ncabal, the rich would have been ruined, and the poor destroyed. It is to\r\nindependence that every Tory owes the present safety which he lives\r\nin; for by that, and that only, we emerged from a state of dangerous\r\nsuspense, and became a regular people.\r\n\r\nThe necessity, likewise, of being independent, had there been no rupture\r\nbetween Britain and America, would, in a little time, have brought one\r\non. The increasing importance of commerce, the weight and perplexity of\r\nlegislation, and the entangled state of European politics, would daily\r\nhave shown to the continent the impossibility of continuing subordinate;\r\nfor, after the coolest reflections on the matter, this must be allowed,\r\nthat Britain was too jealous of America to govern it justly; too\r\nignorant of it to govern it well; and too far distant from it to govern\r\nit at all.\r\n\r\nIV. But what weigh most with all men of serious reflection are, the\r\nmoral advantages arising from independence: war and desolation have\r\nbecome the trade of the old world; and America neither could nor can be\r\nunder the government of Britain without becoming a sharer of her\r\nguilt, and a partner in all the dismal commerce of death. The spirit\r\nof duelling, extended on a national scale, is a proper character for\r\nEuropean wars. They have seldom any other motive than pride, or any\r\nother object than fame. The conquerors and the conquered are generally\r\nruined alike, and the chief difference at last is, that the one marches\r\nhome with his honors, and the other without them. 'Tis the natural\r\ntemper of the English to fight for a feather, if they suppose that\r\nfeather to be an affront; and America, without the right of asking why,\r\nmust have abetted in every quarrel, and abided by its fate. It is a\r\nshocking situation to live in, that one country must be brought into all\r\nthe wars of another, whether the measure be right or wrong, or whether\r\nshe will or not; yet this, in the fullest extent, was, and ever would\r\nbe, the unavoidable consequence of the connection. Surely the Quakers\r\nforgot their own principles when, in their late Testimony, they called\r\nthis connection, with these military and miserable appendages hanging to\r\nit--\"the happy constitution.\"\r\n\r\nBritain, for centuries past, has been nearly fifty years out of every\r\nhundred at war with some power or other. It certainly ought to be a\r\nconscientious as well political consideration with America, not to\r\ndip her hands in the bloody work of Europe. Our situation affords us\r\na retreat from their cabals, and the present happy union of the states\r\nbids fair for extirpating the future use of arms from one quarter of\r\nthe world; yet such have been the irreligious politics of the present\r\nleaders of the Quakers, that, for the sake of they scarce know what,\r\nthey would cut off every hope of such a blessing by tying this continent\r\nto Britain, like Hector to the chariot wheel of Achilles, to be dragged\r\nthrough all the miseries of endless European wars.\r\n\r\nThe connection, viewed from this ground, is distressing to every man\r\nwho has the feelings of humanity. By having Britain for our master, we\r\nbecame enemies to the greatest part of Europe, and they to us: and the\r\nconsequence was war inevitable. By being our own masters, independent of\r\nany foreign one, we have Europe for our friends, and the prospect of an\r\nendless peace among ourselves. Those who were advocates for the British\r\ngovernment over these colonies, were obliged to limit both their\r\narguments and their ideas to the period of an European peace only; the\r\nmoment Britain became plunged in war, every supposed convenience to us\r\nvanished, and all we could hope for was not to be ruined. Could this be\r\na desirable condition for a young country to be in?\r\n\r\nHad the French pursued their fortune immediately after the defeat of\r\nBraddock last war, this city and province had then experienced the woful\r\ncalamities of being a British subject. A scene of the same kind might\r\nhappen again; for America, considered as a subject to the crown\r\nof Britain, would ever have been the seat of war, and the bone of\r\ncontention between the two powers.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if the future expulsion of arms from one quarter of the\r\nworld would be a desirable object to a peaceable man; if the freedom of\r\ntrade to every part of it can engage the attention of a man of business;\r\nif the support or fall of millions of currency can affect our interests;\r\nif the entire possession of estates, by cutting off the lordly claims\r\nof Britain over the soil, deserves the regard of landed property; and if\r\nthe right of making our own laws, uncontrolled by royal or ministerial\r\nspies or mandates, be worthy our care as freemen;--then are all men\r\ninterested in the support of independence; and may he that supports it\r\nnot, be driven from the blessing, and live unpitied beneath the servile\r\nsufferings of scandalous subjection!\r\n\r\nWe have been amused with the tales of ancient wonders; we have read,\r\nand wept over the histories of other nations: applauded, censured, or\r\npitied, as their cases affected us. The fortitude and patience of the\r\nsufferers--the justness of their cause--the weight of their oppressions\r\nand oppressors--the object to be saved or lost--with all the\r\nconsequences of a defeat or a conquest--have, in the hour of sympathy,\r\nbewitched our hearts, and chained it to their fate: but where is the\r\npower that ever made war upon petitioners? Or where is the war on which\r\na world was staked till now?\r\n\r\nWe may not, perhaps, be wise enough to make all the advantages we ought\r\nof our independence; but they are, nevertheless, marked and presented\r\nto us with every character of great and good, and worthy the hand of\r\nhim who sent them. I look through the present trouble to a time of\r\ntranquillity, when we shall have it in our power to set an example of\r\npeace to all the world. Were the Quakers really impressed and influenced\r\nby the quiet principles they profess to hold, they would, however\r\nthey might disapprove the means, be the first of all men to approve of\r\nindependence, because, by separating ourselves from the cities of Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah, it affords an opportunity never given to man before of\r\ncarrying their favourite principle of peace into general practice, by\r\nestablishing governments that shall hereafter exist without wars. O! ye\r\nfallen, cringing, priest-and-Pemberton-ridden people! What more can we\r\nsay of ye than that a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a\r\npolitical Quaker a real Jesuit.\r\n\r\nHaving thus gone over some of the principal points in support of\r\nindependence, I must now request the reader to return back with me to\r\nthe period when it first began to be a public doctrine, and to examine\r\nthe progress it has made among the various classes of men. The area I\r\nmean to begin at, is the breaking out of hostilities, April 19th, 1775.\r\nUntil this event happened, the continent seemed to view the dispute as\r\na kind of law-suit for a matter of right, litigating between the old\r\ncountry and the new; and she felt the same kind and degree of horror,\r\nas if she had seen an oppressive plaintiff, at the head of a band of\r\nruffians, enter the court, while the cause was before it, and put the\r\njudge, the jury, the defendant and his counsel, to the sword. Perhaps a\r\nmore heart-felt convulsion never reached a country with the same\r\ndegree of power and rapidity before, and never may again. Pity for the\r\nsufferers, mixed with indignation at the violence, and heightened with\r\napprehensions of undergoing the same fate, made the affair of Lexington\r\nthe affair of the continent. Every part of it felt the shock, and all\r\nvibrated together. A general promotion of sentiment took place: those\r\nwho had drank deeply into Whiggish principles, that is, the right and\r\nnecessity not only of opposing, but wholly setting aside the power of\r\nthe crown as soon as it became practically dangerous (for in theory\r\nit was always so), stepped into the first stage of independence; while\r\nanother class of Whigs, equally sound in principle, but not so sanguine\r\nin enterprise, attached themselves the stronger to the cause, and fell\r\nclose in with the rear of the former; their partition was a mere point.\r\nNumbers of the moderate men, whose chief fault, at that time, arose from\r\nentertaining a better opinion of Britain than she deserved, convinced\r\nnow of their mistake, gave her up, and publicly declared themselves\r\ngood Whigs. While the Tories, seeing it was no longer a laughing matter,\r\neither sank into silent obscurity, or contented themselves with coming\r\nforth and abusing General Gage: not a single advocate appeared to\r\njustify the action of that day; it seemed to appear to every one with\r\nthe same magnitude, struck every one with the same force, and created in\r\nevery one the same abhorrence. From this period we may date the growth\r\nof independence.\r\n\r\nIf the many circumstances which happened at this memorable time, be\r\ntaken in one view, and compared with each other, they will justify a\r\nconclusion which seems not to have been attended to, I mean a fixed\r\ndesign in the king and ministry of driving America into arms, in order\r\nthat they might be furnished with a pretence for seizing the whole\r\ncontinent, as the immediate property of the crown. A noble plunder for\r\nhungry courtiers!\r\n\r\nIt ought to be remembered, that the first petition from the Congress\r\nwas at this time unanswered on the part of the British king. That the\r\nmotion, called Lord North's motion, of the 20th of February, 1775,\r\narrived in America the latter end of March. This motion was to be laid,\r\nby the several governors then in being, before, the assembly of each\r\nprovince; and the first assembly before which it was laid, was the\r\nassembly of Pennsylvania, in May following. This being a just state of\r\nthe case, I then ask, why were hostilities commenced between the time\r\nof passing the resolve in the House of Commons, of the 20th of February,\r\nand the time of the assemblies meeting to deliberate upon it? Degrading\r\nand famous as that motion was, there is nevertheless reason to believe\r\nthat the king and his adherents were afraid the colonies would agree\r\nto it, and lest they should, took effectual care they should not, by\r\nprovoking them with hostilities in the interim. They had not the least\r\ndoubt at that time of conquering America at one blow; and what they\r\nexpected to get by a conquest being infinitely greater than any thing\r\nthey could hope to get either by taxation or accommodation, they seemed\r\ndetermined to prevent even the possibility of hearing each other, lest\r\nAmerica should disappoint their greedy hopes of the whole, by listening\r\neven to their own terms. On the one hand they refused to hear the\r\npetition of the continent, and on the other hand took effectual care the\r\ncontinent should not hear them.\r\n\r\nThat the motion of the 20th February and the orders for commencing\r\nhostilities were both concerted by the same person or persons, and not\r\nthe latter by General Gage, as was falsely imagined at first, is evident\r\nfrom an extract of a letter of his to the administration, read among\r\nother papers in the House of Commons; in which he informs his masters,\r\n\"That though their idea of his disarming certain counties was a right\r\none, yet it required him to be master of the country, in order to enable\r\nhim to execute it.\" This was prior to the commencement of hostilities,\r\nand consequently before the motion of the 20th February could be\r\ndeliberated on by the several assemblies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be asked, why was the motion passed, if there was at the\r\nsame time a plan to aggravate the Americans not to listen to it? Lord\r\nNorth assigned one reason himself, which was a hope of dividing them.\r\nThis was publicly tempting them to reject it; that if, in case the\r\ninjury of arms should fail in provoking them sufficiently, the insult\r\nof such a declaration might fill it up. But by passing the motion and\r\ngetting it afterwards rejected in America, it enabled them, in their\r\nwicked idea of politics, among other things, to hold up the colonies to\r\nforeign powers, with every possible mark of disobedience and rebellion.\r\nThey had applied to those powers not to supply the continent with arms,\r\nammunition, etc., and it was necessary they should incense them against\r\nus, by assigning on their own part some seeming reputable reason why.\r\nBy dividing, it had a tendency to weaken the States, and likewise to\r\nperplex the adherents of America in England. But the principal scheme,\r\nand that which has marked their character in every part of their\r\nconduct, was a design of precipitating the colonies into a state which\r\nthey might afterwards deem rebellion, and, under that pretence, put an\r\nend to all future complaints, petitions and remonstrances, by seizing\r\nthe whole at once. They had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could\r\nglut them no longer; their prodigality required new plunder, and through\r\nthe East India article tea they hoped to transfer their rapine from that\r\nquarter of the world to this. Every designed quarrel had its pretence;\r\nand the same barbarian avarice accompanied the plant to America, which\r\nruined the country that produced it.\r\n\r\nThat men never turn rogues without turning fools is a maxim, sooner or\r\nlater, universally true. The commencement of hostilities, being in the\r\nbeginning of April, was, of all times the worst chosen: the Congress\r\nwere to meet the tenth of May following, and the distress the continent\r\nfelt at this unparalleled outrage gave a stability to that body which\r\nno other circumstance could have done. It suppressed too all inferior\r\ndebates, and bound them together by a necessitous affection, without\r\ngiving them time to differ upon trifles. The suffering likewise softened\r\nthe whole body of the people into a degree of pliability, which laid the\r\nprincipal foundation-stone of union, order, and government; and which,\r\nat any other time, might only have fretted and then faded away\r\nunnoticed and unimproved. But Providence, who best knows how to time her\r\nmisfortunes as well as her immediate favors, chose this to be the time,\r\nand who dare dispute it?\r\n\r\nIt did not seem the disposition of the people, at this crisis, to\r\nheap petition upon petition, while the former remained unanswered. The\r\nmeasure however was carried in Congress, and a second petition was sent;\r\nof which I shall only remark that it was submissive even to a dangerous\r\nfault, because the prayer of it appealed solely to what it called the\r\nprerogative of the crown, while the matter in dispute was confessedly\r\nconstitutional. But even this petition, flattering as it was, was\r\nstill not so harmonious as the chink of cash, and consequently not\r\nsufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his ministry. From every\r\ncircumstance it is evident, that it was the determination of the British\r\ncourt to have nothing to do with America but to conquer her fully and\r\nabsolutely. They were certain of success, and the field of battle was\r\nthe only place of treaty. I am confident there are thousands and tens of\r\nthousands in America who wonder now that they should ever have thought\r\notherwise; but the sin of that day was the sin of civility; yet it\r\noperated against our present good in the same manner that a civil\r\nopinion of the devil would against our future peace.\r\n\r\nIndependence was a doctrine scarce and rare, even towards the conclusion\r\nof the year 1775; all our politics had been founded on the hope of\r\nexpectation of making the matter up--a hope, which, though general on\r\nthe side of America, had never entered the head or heart of the British\r\ncourt. Their hope was conquest and confiscation. Good heavens! what\r\nvolumes of thanks does America owe to Britain? What infinite obligation\r\nto the tool that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the throne! Nothing\r\nbut the sharpest essence of villany, compounded with the strongest\r\ndistillation of folly, could have produced a menstruum that would have\r\neffected a separation. The Congress in 1774 administered an abortive\r\nmedicine to independence, by prohibiting the importation of goods,\r\nand the succeeding Congress rendered the dose still more dangerous by\r\ncontinuing it. Had independence been a settled system with America, (as\r\nBritain has advanced,) she ought to have doubled her importation, and\r\nprohibited in some degree her exportation. And this single circumstance\r\nis sufficient to acquit America before any jury of nations, of having\r\na continental plan of independence in view; a charge which, had it been\r\ntrue, would have been honorable, but is so grossly false, that either\r\nthe amazing ignorance or the wilful dishonesty of the British court is\r\neffectually proved by it.\r\n\r\nThe second petition, like the first, produced no answer; it was\r\nscarcely acknowledged to have been received; the British court were too\r\ndetermined in their villainy even to act it artfully, and in their rage\r\nfor conquest neglected the necessary subtleties for obtaining it. They\r\nmight have divided, distracted and played a thousand tricks with us, had\r\nthey been as cunning as they were cruel.\r\n\r\nThis last indignity gave a new spring to independence. Those who knew\r\nthe savage obstinacy of the king, and the jobbing, gambling spirit of\r\nthe court, predicted the fate of the petition, as soon as it was sent\r\nfrom America; for the men being known, their measures were easily\r\nforeseen. As politicians we ought not so much to ground our hopes on\r\nthe reasonableness of the thing we ask, as on the reasonableness of\r\nthe person of whom we ask it: who would expect discretion from a fool,\r\ncandor from a tyrant, or justice from a villain?\r\n\r\nAs every prospect of accommodation seemed now to fail fast, men began to\r\nthink seriously on the matter; and their reason being thus stripped of\r\nthe false hope which had long encompassed it, became approachable by\r\nfair debate: yet still the bulk of the people hesitated; they startled\r\nat the novelty of independence, without once considering that our\r\ngetting into arms at first was a more extraordinary novelty, and that\r\nall other nations had gone through the work of independence before\r\nus. They doubted likewise the ability of the continent to support\r\nit, without reflecting that it required the same force to obtain an\r\naccommodation by arms as an independence. If the one was acquirable, the\r\nother was the same; because, to accomplish either, it was necessary that\r\nour strength should be too great for Britain to subdue; and it was too\r\nunreasonable to suppose, that with the power of being masters, we should\r\nsubmit to be servants.* Their caution at this time was exceedingly\r\nmisplaced; for if they were able to defend their property and maintain\r\ntheir rights by arms, they, consequently, were able to defend and\r\nsupport their independence; and in proportion as these men saw the\r\nnecessity and correctness of the measure, they honestly and openly\r\ndeclared and adopted it, and the part that they had acted since has done\r\nthem honor and fully established their characters. Error in opinion has\r\nthis peculiar advantage with it, that the foremost point of the contrary\r\nground may at any time be reached by the sudden exertion of a thought;\r\nand it frequently happens in sentimental differences, that some striking\r\ncircumstance, or some forcible reason quickly conceived, will effect in\r\nan instant what neither argument nor example could produce in an age.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * In this state of political suspense the pamphlet Common Sense made\r\nits appearance, and the success it met with does not become me to\r\nmention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams, were severally spoken\r\nof as the supposed author. I had not, at that time, the pleasure either\r\nof personally knowing or being known to the two last gentlemen. The\r\nfavor of Dr. Franklin's friendship I possessed in England, and my\r\nintroduction to this part of the world was through his patronage. I\r\nhappened, when a school-boy, to pick up a pleasing natural history of\r\nVirginia, and my inclination from that day of seeing the western side\r\nof the Atlantic never left me. In October, 1775, Dr. Franklin proposed\r\ngiving me such materials as were in his hands, towards completing a\r\nhistory of the present transactions, and seemed desirous of having the\r\nfirst volume out the next Spring. I had then formed the outlines of\r\nCommon Sense, and finished nearly the first part; and as I supposed the\r\ndoctor's design in getting out a history was to open the new year with\r\na new system, I expected to surprise him with a production on that\r\nsubject, much earlier than he thought of; and without informing him what\r\nI was doing, got it ready for the press as fast as I conveniently could,\r\nand sent him the first pamphlet that was printed off.\r\n\r\nI find it impossible in the small compass I am limited to, to trace out\r\nthe progress which independence has made on the minds of the different\r\nclasses of men, and the several reasons by which they were moved. With\r\nsome, it was a passionate abhorrence against the king of England and his\r\nministry, as a set of savages and brutes; and these men, governed by\r\nthe agony of a wounded mind, were for trusting every thing to hope and\r\nheaven, and bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a growing\r\nconviction that the scheme of the British court was to create, ferment\r\nand drive on a quarrel, for the sake of confiscated plunder: and men\r\nof this class ripened into independence in proportion as the evidence\r\nincreased. While a third class conceived it was the true interest of\r\nAmerica, internally and externally, to be her own master, and gave their\r\nsupport to independence, step by step, as they saw her abilities to\r\nmaintain it enlarge. With many, it was a compound of all these reasons;\r\nwhile those who were too callous to be reached by either, remained, and\r\nstill remain Tories.\r\n\r\nThe legal necessity of being independent, with several collateral\r\nreasons, is pointed out in an elegant masterly manner, in a charge to\r\nthe grand jury for the district of Charleston, by the Hon. William\r\nHenry Drayton, chief justice of South Carolina, [April 23, 1776]. This\r\nperformance, and the address of the convention of New York, are pieces,\r\nin my humble opinion, of the first rank in America.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes why independence has not been so universally\r\nsupported as it ought, are fear and indolence, and the causes why it\r\nhas been opposed, are, avarice, down-right villany, and lust of personal\r\npower. There is not such a being in America as a Tory from conscience;\r\nsome secret defect or other is interwoven in the character of all those,\r\nbe they men or women, who can look with patience on the brutality,\r\nluxury and debauchery of the British court, and the violations of their\r\narmy here. A woman's virtue must sit very lightly on her who can even\r\nhint a favorable sentiment in their behalf. It is remarkable that the\r\nwhole race of prostitutes in New York were tories; and the schemes for\r\nsupporting the Tory cause in this city, for which several are now\r\nin jail, and one hanged, were concerted and carried on in common\r\nbawdy-houses, assisted by those who kept them.\r\n\r\nThe connection between vice and meanness is a fit subject for satire,\r\nbut when the satire is a fact, it cuts with the irresistible power of a\r\ndiamond. If a Quaker, in defence of his just rights, his property,\r\nand the chastity of his house, takes up a musket, he is expelled the\r\nmeeting; but the present king of England, who seduced and took into\r\nkeeping a sister of their society, is reverenced and supported by\r\nrepeated Testimonies, while, the friendly noodle from whom she was taken\r\n(and who is now in this city) continues a drudge in the service of his\r\nrival, as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature called a king.\r\n\r\nOur support and success depend on such a variety of men and\r\ncircumstances, that every one who does but wish well, is of some use:\r\nthere are men who have a strange aversion to arms, yet have hearts to\r\nrisk every shilling in the cause, or in support of those who have better\r\ntalents for defending it. Nature, in the arrangement of mankind, has\r\nfitted some for every service in life: were all soldiers, all would\r\nstarve and go naked, and were none soldiers, all would be slaves. As\r\ndisaffection to independence is the badge of a Tory, so affection to\r\nit is the mark of a Whig; and the different services of the Whigs, down\r\nfrom those who nobly contribute every thing, to those who have nothing\r\nto render but their wishes, tend all to the same center, though with\r\ndifferent degrees of merit and ability. The larger we make the circle,\r\nthe more we shall harmonize, and the stronger we shall be. All we want\r\nto shut out is disaffection, and, that excluded, we must accept from\r\neach other such duties as we are best fitted to bestow. A narrow system\r\nof politics, like a narrow system of religion, is calculated only to\r\nsour the temper, and be at variance with mankind.\r\n\r\nAll we want to know in America is simply this, who is for independence,\r\nand who is not? Those who are for it, will support it, and the remainder\r\nwill undoubtedly see the reasonableness of paying the charges; while\r\nthose who oppose or seek to betray it, must expect the more rigid fate\r\nof the jail and the gibbet. There is a bastard kind of generosity, which\r\nbeing extended to all men, is as fatal to society, on one hand, as the\r\nwant of true generosity is on the other. A lax manner of administering\r\njustice, falsely termed moderation, has a tendency both to dispirit\r\npublic virtue, and promote the growth of public evils. Had the late\r\ncommittee of safety taken cognizance of the last Testimony of the\r\nQuakers and proceeded against such delinquents as were concerned\r\ntherein, they had, probably, prevented the treasonable plans which\r\nhave been concerted since. When one villain is suffered to escape, it\r\nencourages another to proceed, either from a hope of escaping likewise,\r\nor an apprehension that we dare not punish. It has been a matter of\r\ngeneral surprise, that no notice was taken of the incendiary publication\r\nof the Quakers, of the 20th of November last; a publication evidently\r\nintended to promote sedition and treason, and encourage the enemy, who\r\nwere then within a day's march of this city, to proceed on and possess\r\nit. I here present the reader with a memorial which was laid before the\r\nboard of safety a few days after the Testimony appeared. Not a member of\r\nthat board, that I conversed with, but expressed the highest detestation\r\nof the perverted principles and conduct of the Quaker junto, and a wish\r\nthat the board would take the matter up; notwithstanding which, it was\r\nsuffered to pass away unnoticed, to the encouragement of new acts of\r\ntreason, the general danger of the cause, and the disgrace of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        To the honorable the Council of Safety of the State of\r\n                            Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of\r\nPhiladelphia, impressed with a proper sense of the justice of the cause\r\nwhich this continent is engaged in, and animated with a generous fervor\r\nfor supporting the same, it was resolved, that the following be laid\r\nbefore the board of safety:\r\n\r\n\"We profess liberality of sentiment to all men; with this distinction\r\nonly, that those who do not deserve it would become wise and seek\r\nto deserve it. We hold the pure doctrines of universal liberty of\r\nconscience, and conceive it our duty to endeavor to secure that sacred\r\nright to others, as well as to defend it for ourselves; for we undertake\r\nnot to judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but leave the whole\r\nmatter to Him who made us.\r\n\r\n\"We persecute no man, neither will we abet in the persecution of any\r\nman for religion's sake; our common relation to others being that of\r\nfellow-citizens and fellow-subjects of one single community; and in this\r\nline of connection we hold out the right hand of fellowship to all men.\r\nBut we should conceive ourselves to be unworthy members of the free and\r\nindependent States of America, were we unconcernedly to see or to suffer\r\nany treasonable wound, public or private, directly or indirectly, to be\r\ngiven against the peace and safety of the same. We inquire not into the\r\nrank of the offenders, nor into their religious persuasion; we have no\r\nbusiness with either, our part being only to find them out and exhibit\r\nthem to justice.\r\n\r\n\"A printed paper, dated the 20th of November, and signed 'John\r\nPemberton,' whom we suppose to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately\r\nbeen dispersed abroad, a copy of which accompanies this. Had the framers\r\nand publishers of that paper conceived it their duty to exhort the youth\r\nand others of their society, to a patient submission under the present\r\ntrying visitations, and humbly to wait the event of heaven towards them,\r\nthey had therein shown a Christian temper, and we had been silent; but\r\nthe anger and political virulence with which their instructions are\r\ngiven, and the abuse with which they stigmatize all ranks of men not\r\nthinking like themselves, leave no doubt on our minds from what spirit\r\ntheir publication proceeded: and it is disgraceful to the pure cause of\r\ntruth, that men can dally with words of the most sacred import, and play\r\nthem off as mechanically as if religion consisted only in contrivance.\r\nWe know of no instance in which the Quakers have been compelled to bear\r\narms, or to do any thing which might strain their conscience; wherefore\r\ntheir advice, 'to withstand and refuse to submit to the arbitrary\r\ninstructions and ordinances of men,' appear to us a false alarm, and\r\ncould only be treasonably calculated to gain favor with our enemies,\r\nwhen they are seemingly on the brink of invading this State, or, what\r\nis still worse, to weaken the hands of our defence, that their entrance\r\ninto this city might be made practicable and easy.\r\n\r\n\"We disclaim all tumult and disorder in the punishment of offenders;\r\nand wish to be governed, not by temper but by reason, in the manner of\r\ntreating them. We are sensible that our cause has suffered by the two\r\nfollowing errors: first, by ill-judged lenity to traitorous persons in\r\nsome cases; and, secondly, by only a passionate treatment of them in\r\nothers. For the future we disown both, and wish to be steady in our\r\nproceedings, and serious in our punishments.\r\n\r\n\"Every State in America has, by the repeated voice of its inhabitants,\r\ndirected and authorized the Continental Congress to publish a formal\r\nDeclaration of Independence of, and separation from, the oppressive king\r\nand Parliament of Great Britain; and we look on every man as an\r\nenemy, who does not in some line or other, give his assistance towards\r\nsupporting the same; at the same time we consider the offence to be\r\nheightened to a degree of unpardonable guilt, when such persons,\r\nunder the show of religion, endeavor, either by writing, speaking, or\r\notherwise, to subvert, overturn, or bring reproach upon the independence\r\nof this continent as declared by Congress.\r\n\r\n\"The publishers of the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' have called in a\r\nloud manner to their friends and connections, 'to withstand or refuse'\r\nobedience to whatever 'instructions or ordinances' may be published, not\r\nwarranted by (what they call) 'that happy Constitution under which they\r\nand others long enjoyed tranquillity and peace.' If this be not treason,\r\nwe know not what may properly be called by that name.\r\n\r\n\"To us it is a matter of surprise and astonishment, that men with the\r\nword 'peace, peace,' continually on their lips, should be so fond of\r\nliving under and supporting a government, and at the same time calling\r\nit 'happy,' which is never better pleased than when a war--that has\r\nfilled India with carnage and famine, Africa with slavery, and tampered\r\nwith Indians and negroes to cut the throats of the freemen of America.\r\nWe conceive it a disgrace to this State, to harbor or wink at such\r\npalpable hypocrisy. But as we seek not to hurt the hair of any man's\r\nhead, when we can make ourselves safe without, we wish such persons to\r\nrestore peace to themselves and us, by removing themselves to some part\r\nof the king of Great Britain's dominions, as by that means they may live\r\nunmolested by us and we by them; for our fixed opinion is, that those\r\nwho do not deserve a place among us, ought not to have one.\r\n\r\n\"We conclude with requesting the Council of Safety to take into\r\nconsideration the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' and if it shall appear\r\nto them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a treasonable nature, that\r\nthey would commit the signer, together with such other persons as they\r\ncan discover were concerned therein, into custody, until such time as\r\nsome mode of trial shall ascertain the full degree of their guilt and\r\npunishment; in the doing of which, we wish their judges, whoever\r\nthey may be, to disregard the man, his connections, interest, riches,\r\npoverty, or principles of religion, and to attend to the nature of his\r\noffence only.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most cavilling sectarian cannot accuse the foregoing with containing\r\nthe least ingredient of persecution. The free spirit on which the\r\nAmerican cause is founded, disdains to mix with such an impurity, and\r\nleaves it as rubbish fit only for narrow and suspicious minds to grovel\r\nin. Suspicion and persecution are weeds of the same dunghill, and\r\nflourish together. Had the Quakers minded their religion and their\r\nbusiness, they might have lived through this dispute in enviable ease,\r\nand none would have molested them. The common phrase with these people\r\nis, 'Our principles are peace.' To which may be replied, and your\r\npractices are the reverse; for never did the conduct of men oppose their\r\nown doctrine more notoriously than the present race of the Quakers. They\r\nhave artfully changed themselves into a different sort of people to what\r\nthey used to be, and yet have the address to persuade each other that\r\nthey are not altered; like antiquated virgins, they see not the havoc\r\ndeformity has made upon them, but pleasantly mistaking wrinkles for\r\ndimples, conceive themselves yet lovely and wonder at the stupid world\r\nfor not admiring them.\r\n\r\nDid no injury arise to the public by this apostacy of the Quakers from\r\nthemselves, the public would have nothing to do with it; but as both the\r\ndesign and consequences are pointed against a cause in which the whole\r\ncommunity are interested, it is therefore no longer a subject confined\r\nto the cognizance of the meeting only, but comes, as a matter of\r\ncriminality, before the authority either of the particular State in\r\nwhich it is acted, or of the continent against which it operates. Every\r\nattempt, now, to support the authority of the king and Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain over America, is treason against every State; therefore\r\nit is impossible that any one can pardon or screen from punishment an\r\noffender against all.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed: while the infatuated Tories of this and other States\r\nwere last spring talking of commissioners, accommodation, making the\r\nmatter up, and the Lord knows what stuff and nonsense, their good king\r\nand ministry were glutting themselves with the revenge of reducing\r\nAmerica to unconditional submission, and solacing each other with the\r\ncertainty of conquering it in one campaign. The following quotations are\r\nfrom the parliamentary register of the debate's of the House of Lords,\r\nMarch 5th, 1776:\r\n\r\n\"The Americans,\" says Lord Talbot,* \"have been obstinate, undutiful, and\r\nungovernable from the very beginning, from their first early and infant\r\nsettlements; and I am every day more and more convinced that this people\r\nnever will be brought back to their duty, and the subordinate relation\r\nthey stand in to this country, till reduced to unconditional, effectual\r\nsubmission; no concession on our part, no lenity, no endurance, will\r\nhave any other effect but that of increasing their insolence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Steward of the king's household.\r\n\r\n\"The struggle,\" says Lord Townsend,* \"is now a struggle for power; the\r\ndie is cast, and the only point which now remains to be determined is,\r\nin what manner the war can be most effectually prosecuted and speedily\r\nfinished, in order to procure that unconditional submission, which has\r\nbeen so ably stated by the noble Earl with the white staff\" (meaning\r\nLord Talbot;) \"and I have no reason to doubt that the measures now\r\npursuing will put an end to the war in the course of a single campaign.\r\nShould it linger longer, we shall then have reason to expect that\r\nsome foreign power will interfere, and take advantage of our domestic\r\ntroubles and civil distractions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Formerly General Townsend, at Quebec, and late lord-lieutenant of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nLord Littleton. \"My sentiments are pretty well known. I shall only\r\nobserve now that lenient measures have had no other effect than to\r\nproduce insult after insult; that the more we conceded, the higher\r\nAmerica rose in her demands, and the more insolent she has grown. It\r\nis for this reason that I am now for the most effective and decisive\r\nmeasures; and am of opinion that no alternative is left us, but to\r\nrelinquish America for ever, or finally determine to compel her to\r\nacknowledge the legislative authority of this country; and it is the\r\nprinciple of an unconditional submission I would be for maintaining.\"\r\n\r\nCan words be more expressive than these? Surely the Tories will believe\r\nthe Tory lords! The truth is, they do believe them and know as fully as\r\nany Whig on the continent knows, that the king and ministry never had\r\nthe least design of an accommodation with America, but an absolute,\r\nunconditional conquest. And the part which the Tories were to act, was,\r\nby downright lying, to endeavor to put the continent off its guard, and\r\nto divide and sow discontent in the minds of such Whigs as they might\r\ngain an influence over. In short, to keep up a distraction here, that\r\nthe force sent from England might be able to conquer in \"one campaign.\"\r\nThey and the ministry were, by a different game, playing into each\r\nother's hands. The cry of the Tories in England was, \"No reconciliation,\r\nno accommodation,\" in order to obtain the greater military force;\r\nwhile those in America were crying nothing but \"reconciliation and\r\naccommodation,\" that the force sent might conquer with the less\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nBut this \"single campaign\" is over, and America not conquered. The\r\nwhole work is yet to do, and the force much less to do it with. Their\r\ncondition is both despicable and deplorable: out of cash--out of heart,\r\nand out of hope. A country furnished with arms and ammunition as America\r\nnow is, with three millions of inhabitants, and three thousand miles\r\ndistant from the nearest enemy that can approach her, is able to look\r\nand laugh them in the face.\r\n\r\nHowe appears to have two objects in view, either to go up the North\r\nRiver, or come to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nBy going up the North River, he secures a retreat for his army through\r\nCanada, but the ships must return if they return at all, the same way\r\nthey went; as our army would be in the rear, the safety of their passage\r\ndown is a doubtful matter. By such a motion he shuts himself from all\r\nsupplies from Europe, but through Canada, and exposes his army and\r\nnavy to the danger of perishing. The idea of his cutting off the\r\ncommunication between the eastern and southern states, by means of\r\nthe North River, is merely visionary. He cannot do it by his shipping;\r\nbecause no ship can lay long at anchor in any river within reach of the\r\nshore; a single gun would drive a first rate from such a station. This\r\nwas fully proved last October at Forts Washington and Lee, where one\r\ngun only, on each side of the river, obliged two frigates to cut and\r\nbe towed off in an hour's time. Neither can he cut it off by his army;\r\nbecause the several posts they must occupy would divide them almost\r\nto nothing, and expose them to be picked up by ours like pebbles on a\r\nriver's bank; but admitting that he could, where is the injury? Because,\r\nwhile his whole force is cantoned out, as sentries over the water, they\r\nwill be very innocently employed, and the moment they march into the\r\ncountry the communication opens.\r\n\r\nThe most probable object is Philadelphia, and the reasons are many.\r\nHowe's business is to conquer it, and in proportion as he finds himself\r\nunable to the task, he will employ his strength to distress women and\r\nweak minds, in order to accomplish through their fears what he cannot\r\naccomplish by his own force. His coming or attempting to come to\r\nPhiladelphia is a circumstance that proves his weakness: for no general\r\nthat felt himself able to take the field and attack his antagonist would\r\nthink of bringing his army into a city in the summer time; and this mere\r\nshifting the scene from place to place, without effecting any thing,\r\nhas feebleness and cowardice on the face of it, and holds him up in a\r\ncontemptible light to all who can reason justly and firmly. By several\r\ninformations from New York, it appears that their army in general, both\r\nofficers and men, have given up the expectation of conquering America;\r\ntheir eye now is fixed upon the spoil. They suppose Philadelphia to be\r\nrich with stores, and as they think to get more by robbing a town than\r\nby attacking an army, their movement towards this city is probable. We\r\nare not now contending against an army of soldiers, but against a band\r\nof thieves, who had rather plunder than fight, and have no other hope of\r\nconquest than by cruelty.\r\n\r\nThey expect to get a mighty booty, and strike another general panic, by\r\nmaking a sudden movement and getting possession of this city; but unless\r\nthey can march out as well as in, or get the entire command of the\r\nriver, to remove off their plunder, they may probably be stopped with\r\nthe stolen goods upon them. They have never yet succeeded wherever they\r\nhave been opposed, but at Fort Washington. At Charleston their defeat\r\nwas effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away. In every skirmish at\r\nKingsbridge and the White Plains they were obliged to retreat, and the\r\ninstant that our arms were turned upon them in the Jerseys, they turned\r\nlikewise, and those that turned not were taken.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of always fitting our internal police to the circumstances\r\nof the times we live in, is something so strikingly obvious, that no\r\nsufficient objection can be made against it. The safety of all\r\nsocieties depends upon it; and where this point is not attended to,\r\nthe consequences will either be a general languor or a tumult. The\r\nencouragement and protection of the good subjects of any state, and the\r\nsuppression and punishment of bad ones, are the principal objects for\r\nwhich all authority is instituted, and the line in which it ought to\r\noperate. We have in this city a strange variety of men and characters,\r\nand the circumstances of the times require that they should be publicly\r\nknown; it is not the number of Tories that hurt us, so much as the not\r\nfinding out who they are; men must now take one side or the other, and\r\nabide by the consequences: the Quakers, trusting to their short-sighted\r\nsagacity, have, most unluckily for them, made their declaration in their\r\nlast Testimony, and we ought now to take them at their word. They have\r\ninvoluntarily read themselves out of the continental meeting, and cannot\r\nhope to be restored to it again but by payment and penitence. Men whose\r\npolitical principles are founded on avarice, are beyond the reach\r\nof reason, and the only cure of Toryism of this cast is to tax it.\r\nA substantial good drawn from a real evil, is of the same benefit to\r\nsociety, as if drawn from a virtue; and where men have not public spirit\r\nto render themselves serviceable, it ought to be the study of government\r\nto draw the best use possible from their vices. When the governing\r\npassion of any man, or set of men, is once known, the method of managing\r\nthem is easy; for even misers, whom no public virtue can impress, would\r\nbecome generous, could a heavy tax be laid upon covetousness.\r\n\r\nThe Tories have endeavored to insure their property with the enemy, by\r\nforfeiting their reputation with us; from which may be justly inferred,\r\nthat their governing passion is avarice. Make them as much afraid of\r\nlosing on one side as on the other, and you stagger their Toryism; make\r\nthem more so, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to worship\r\nthe power which they are most afraid of.\r\n\r\nThis method of considering men and things together, opens into a large\r\nfield for speculation, and affords me an opportunity of offering some\r\nobservations on the state of our currency, so as to make the support\r\nof it go hand in hand with the suppression of disaffection and the\r\nencouragement of public spirit.\r\n\r\nThe thing which first presents itself in inspecting the state of the\r\ncurrency, is, that we have too much of it, and that there is a necessity\r\nof reducing the quantity, in order to increase the value. Men are daily\r\ngrowing poor by the very means that they take to get rich; for in the\r\nsame proportion that the prices of all goods on hand are raised, the\r\nvalue of all money laid by is reduced. A simple case will make this\r\nclear; let a man have 100 L. in cash, and as many goods on hand as will\r\nto-day sell for 20 L.; but not content with the present market price,\r\nhe raises them to 40 L. and by so doing obliges others, in their own\r\ndefence, to raise cent. per cent. likewise; in this case it is evident\r\nthat his hundred pounds laid by, is reduced fifty pounds in value;\r\nwhereas, had the market lowered cent. per cent., his goods would have\r\nsold but for ten, but his hundred pounds would have risen in value to\r\ntwo hundred; because it would then purchase as many goods again, or\r\nsupport his family as long again as before. And, strange as it may seem,\r\nhe is one hundred and fifty pounds the poorer for raising his goods, to\r\nwhat he would have been had he lowered them; because the forty pounds\r\nwhich his goods sold for, is, by the general raise of the market cent.\r\nper cent., rendered of no more value than the ten pounds would be had\r\nthe market fallen in the same proportion; and, consequently, the whole\r\ndifference of gain or loss is on the difference in value of the hundred\r\npounds laid by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage for raising\r\ngoods is for several reasons much more the fault of the Tories than the\r\nWhigs; and yet the Tories (to their shame and confusion ought they to\r\nbe told of it) are by far the most noisy and discontented. The greatest\r\npart of the Whigs, by being now either in the army or employed in some\r\npublic service, are buyers only and not sellers, and as this evil has\r\nits origin in trade, it cannot be charged on those who are out of it.\r\n\r\nBut the grievance has now become too general to be remedied by partial\r\nmethods, and the only effectual cure is to reduce the quantity of money:\r\nwith half the quantity we should be richer than we are now, because\r\nthe value of it would be doubled, and consequently our attachment to it\r\nincreased; for it is not the number of dollars that a man has, but how\r\nfar they will go, that makes him either rich or poor. These two points\r\nbeing admitted, viz. that the quantity of money is too great, and that\r\nthe prices of goods can only be effectually reduced by, reducing the\r\nquantity of the money, the next point to be considered is, the method\r\nhow to reduce it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the times, as before observed, require that the\r\npublic characters of all men should now be fully understood, and the\r\nonly general method of ascertaining it is by an oath or affirmation,\r\nrenouncing all allegiance to the king of Great Britain, and to support\r\nthe independence of the United States, as declared by Congress. Let, at\r\nthe same time, a tax of ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent. per annum, to\r\nbe collected quarterly, be levied on all property. These alternatives,\r\nby being perfectly voluntary, will take in all sorts of people. Here\r\nis the test; here is the tax. He who takes the former, conscientiously\r\nproves his affection to the cause, and binds himself to pay his quota\r\nby the best services in his power, and is thereby justly exempt from the\r\nlatter; and those who choose the latter, pay their quota in money, to be\r\nexcused from the former, or rather, it is the price paid to us for their\r\nsupposed, though mistaken, insurance with the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut this is only a part of the advantage which would arise by knowing\r\nthe different characters of men. The Whigs stake everything on the issue\r\nof their arms, while the Tories, by their disaffection, are sapping and\r\nundermining their strength; and, of consequence, the property of the\r\nWhigs is the more exposed thereby; and whatever injury their estates\r\nmay sustain by the movements of the enemy, must either be borne by\r\nthemselves, who have done everything which has yet been done, or by the\r\nTories, who have not only done nothing, but have, by their disaffection,\r\ninvited the enemy on.\r\n\r\nIn the present crisis we ought to know, square by square and house by\r\nhouse, who are in real allegiance with the United Independent States,\r\nand who are not. Let but the line be made clear and distinct, and all\r\nmen will then know what they are to trust to. It would not only be\r\ngood policy but strict justice, to raise fifty or one hundred thousand\r\npounds, or more, if it is necessary, out of the estates and property\r\nof the king of England's votaries, resident in Philadelphia, to be\r\ndistributed, as a reward to those inhabitants of the city and State, who\r\nshould turn out and repulse the enemy, should they attempt to march this\r\nway; and likewise, to bind the property of all such persons to make\r\ngood the damages which that of the Whigs might sustain. In the\r\nundistinguishable mode of conducting a war, we frequently make reprisals\r\nat sea, on the vessels of persons in England, who are friends to our\r\ncause compared with the resident Tories among us.\r\n\r\nIn every former publication of mine, from Common Sense down to the last\r\nCrisis, I have generally gone on the charitable supposition, that the\r\nTories were rather a mistaken than a criminal people, and have applied\r\nargument after argument, with all the candor and temper which I was\r\ncapable of, in order to set every part of the case clearly and fairly\r\nbefore them, and if possible to reclaim them from ruin to reason. I have\r\ndone my duty by them and have now done with that doctrine, taking it for\r\ngranted, that those who yet hold their disaffection are either a set\r\nof avaricious miscreants, who would sacrifice the continent to save\r\nthemselves, or a banditti of hungry traitors, who are hoping for\r\na division of the spoil. To which may be added, a list of crown or\r\nproprietary dependants, who, rather than go without a portion of power,\r\nwould be content to share it with the devil. Of such men there is no\r\nhope; and their obedience will only be according to the danger set\r\nbefore them, and the power that is exercised over them.\r\n\r\nA time will shortly arrive, in which, by ascertaining the characters of\r\npersons now, we shall be guarded against their mischiefs then; for in\r\nproportion as the enemy despair of conquest, they will be trying the\r\narts of seduction and the force of fear by all the mischiefs which they\r\ncan inflict. But in war we may be certain of these two things, viz. that\r\ncruelty in an enemy, and motions made with more than usual parade, are\r\nalways signs of weakness. He that can conquer, finds his mind too free\r\nand pleasant to be brutish; and he that intends to conquer, never makes\r\ntoo much show of his strength.\r\n\r\nWe now know the enemy we have to do with. While drunk with the\r\ncertainty of victory, they disdained to be civil; and in proportion as\r\ndisappointment makes them sober, and their apprehensions of an European\r\nwar alarm them, they will become cringing and artful; honest they cannot\r\nbe. But our answer to them, in either condition they may be in, is short\r\nand full--\"As free and independent States we are willing to make peace\r\nwith you to-morrow, but we neither can hear nor reply in any other\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nIf Britain cannot conquer us, it proves that she is neither able to\r\ngovern nor protect us, and our particular situation now is such, that\r\nany connection with her would be unwisely exchanging a half-defeated\r\nenemy for two powerful ones. Europe, by every appearance, is now on the\r\neve, nay, on the morning twilight of a war, and any alliance with George\r\nthe Third brings France and Spain upon our backs; a separation from him\r\nattaches them to our side; therefore, the only road to peace, honor and\r\ncommerce is Independence.\r\n\r\nWritten this fourth year of the UNION, which God preserve.\r\n\r\n                                            COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS IV. (THOSE WHO EXPECT TO REAP THE BLESSINGS OF FREEDOM)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must, like men,\r\nundergo the fatigues of supporting it. The event of yesterday was one\r\nof those kind of alarms which is just sufficient to rouse us to duty,\r\nwithout being of consequence enough to depress our fortitude. It is not\r\na field of a few acres of ground, but a cause, that we are defending,\r\nand whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by degrees, the\r\nconsequences will be the same.\r\n\r\nLook back at the events of last winter and the present year, there you\r\nwill find that the enemy's successes always contributed to reduce them.\r\nWhat they have gained in ground, they paid so dearly for in numbers,\r\nthat their victories have in the end amounted to defeats. We have always\r\nbeen masters at the last push, and always shall be while we do our duty.\r\nHowe has been once on the banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven\r\nback with loss and disgrace: and why not be again driven from the\r\nSchuylkill? His condition and ours are very different. He has everybody\r\nto fight, we have only his one army to cope with, and which wastes away\r\nat every engagement: we can not only reinforce, but can redouble our\r\nnumbers; he is cut off from all supplies, and must sooner or later\r\ninevitably fall into our hands.\r\n\r\nShall a band of ten or twelve thousand robbers, who are this day fifteen\r\nhundred or two thousand men less in strength than they were yesterday,\r\nconquer America, or subdue even a single state? The thing cannot be,\r\nunless we sit down and suffer them to do it. Another such a brush,\r\nnotwithstanding we lost the ground, would, by still reducing the enemy,\r\nput them in a condition to be afterwards totally defeated. Could our\r\nwhole army have come up to the attack at one time, the consequences\r\nhad probably been otherwise; but our having different parts of\r\nthe Brandywine creek to guard, and the uncertainty which road to\r\nPhiladelphia the enemy would attempt to take, naturally afforded them an\r\nopportunity of passing with their main body at a place where only a\r\npart of ours could be posted; for it must strike every thinking man with\r\nconviction, that it requires a much greater force to oppose an enemy in\r\nseveral places, than is sufficient to defeat him in any one place.\r\n\r\nMen who are sincere in defending their freedom, will always feel concern\r\nat every circumstance which seems to make against them; it is the\r\nnatural and honest consequence of all affectionate attachments, and the\r\nwant of it is a vice. But the dejection lasts only for a moment; they\r\nsoon rise out of it with additional vigor; the glow of hope, courage and\r\nfortitude, will, in a little time, supply the place of every inferior\r\npassion, and kindle the whole heart into heroism.\r\n\r\nThere is a mystery in the countenance of some causes, which we have not\r\nalways present judgment enough to explain. It is distressing to see an\r\nenemy advancing into a country, but it is the only place in which we can\r\nbeat them, and in which we have always beaten them, whenever they made\r\nthe attempt. The nearer any disease approaches to a crisis, the nearer\r\nit is to a cure. Danger and deliverance make their advances together,\r\nand it is only the last push, in which one or the other takes the lead.\r\n\r\nThere are many men who will do their duty when it is not wanted; but a\r\ngenuine public spirit always appears most when there is most occasion\r\nfor it. Thank God! our army, though fatigued, is yet entire. The attack\r\nmade by us yesterday, was under many disadvantages, naturally arising\r\nfrom the uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy would take; and,\r\nfrom that circumstance, the whole of our force could not be brought\r\nup together time enough to engage all at once. Our strength is yet\r\nreserved; and it is evident that Howe does not think himself a gainer by\r\nthe affair, otherwise he would this morning have moved down and attacked\r\nGeneral Washington.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the city and country, it is in your power, by a spirited\r\nimprovement of the present circumstance, to turn it to a real advantage.\r\nHowe is now weaker than before, and every shot will contribute to reduce\r\nhim. You are more immediately interested than any other part of the\r\ncontinent: your all is at stake; it is not so with the general cause;\r\nyou are devoted by the enemy to plunder and destruction: it is the\r\nencouragement which Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promised his\r\narmy. Thus circumstanced, you may save yourselves by a manly resistance,\r\nbut you can have no hope in any other conduct. I never yet knew our\r\nbrave general, or any part of the army, officers or men, out of heart,\r\nand I have seen them in circumstances a thousand times more trying than\r\nthe present. It is only those that are not in action, that feel languor\r\nand heaviness, and the best way to rub it off is to turn out, and make\r\nsure work of it.\r\n\r\nOur army must undoubtedly feel fatigue, and want a reinforcement of rest\r\nthough not of valor. Our own interest and happiness call upon us to\r\ngive them every support in our power, and make the burden of the day, on\r\nwhich the safety of this city depends, as light as possible. Remember,\r\ngentlemen, that we have forces both to the northward and southward of\r\nPhiladelphia, and if the enemy be but stopped till those can arrive,\r\nthis city will be saved, and the enemy finally routed. You have too much\r\nat stake to hesitate. You ought not to think an hour upon the matter,\r\nbut to spring to action at once. Other states have been invaded, have\r\nlikewise driven off the invaders. Now our time and turn is come, and\r\nperhaps the finishing stroke is reserved for us. When we look back on\r\nthe dangers we have been saved from, and reflect on the success we have\r\nbeen blessed with, it would be sinful either to be idle or to despair.\r\n\r\nI close this paper with a short address to General Howe. You, sir, are\r\nonly lingering out the period that shall bring with it your defeat.\r\nYou have yet scarce began upon the war, and the further you enter, the\r\nfaster will your troubles thicken. What you now enjoy is only a respite\r\nfrom ruin; an invitation to destruction; something that will lead on to\r\nour deliverance at your expense. We know the cause which we are engaged\r\nin, and though a passionate fondness for it may make us grieve at every\r\ninjury which threatens it, yet, when the moment of concern is over, the\r\ndetermination to duty returns. We are not moved by the gloomy smile of a\r\nworthless king, but by the ardent glow of generous patriotism. We fight\r\nnot to enslave, but to set a country free, and to make room upon the\r\nearth for honest men to live in. In such a case we are sure that we are\r\nright; and we leave to you the despairing reflection of being the tool\r\nof a miserable tyrant.\r\n\r\n                                           COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 12, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS. V. TO GEN. SIR WILLIAM HOWE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason,\r\nand whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like\r\nadministering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring to convert an atheist\r\nby scripture. Enjoy, sir, your insensibility of feeling and reflecting.\r\nIt is the prerogative of animals. And no man will envy you these honors,\r\nin which a savage only can be your rival and a bear your master.\r\n\r\nAs the generosity of this country rewarded your brother's services\r\nin the last war, with an elegant monument in Westminster Abbey, it is\r\nconsistent that she should bestow some mark of distinction upon you. You\r\ncertainly deserve her notice, and a conspicuous place in the catalogue\r\nof extraordinary persons. Yet it would be a pity to pass you from the\r\nworld in state, and consign you to magnificent oblivion among the tombs,\r\nwithout telling the future beholder why. Judas is as much known as John,\r\nyet history ascribes their fame to very different actions.\r\n\r\nSir William has undoubtedly merited a monument; but of what kind, or\r\nwith what inscription, where placed or how embellished, is a question\r\nthat would puzzle all the heralds of St. James's in the profoundest mood\r\nof historical deliberation. We are at no loss, sir, to ascertain your\r\nreal character, but somewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its identity,\r\nand preserve it uninjured from the transformations of time or mistake.\r\nA statuary may give a false expression to your bust, or decorate it with\r\nsome equivocal emblems, by which you may happen to steal into reputation\r\nand impose upon the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature or ridicule\r\nmay conspire, or a variety of accidents combine to lessen, enlarge, or\r\nchange Sir William's fame; and no doubt but he who has taken so much\r\npains to be singular in his conduct, would choose to be just as singular\r\nin his exit, his monument and his epitaph.\r\n\r\nThe usual honors of the dead, to be sure, are not sufficiently sublime\r\nto escort a character like you to the republic of dust and ashes; for\r\nhowever men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or of government here,\r\nthe grave is nevertheless a perfect republic. Death is not the monarch\r\nof the dead, but of the dying. The moment he obtains a conquest he loses\r\na subject, and, like the foolish king you serve, will, in the end, war\r\nhimself out of all his dominions.\r\n\r\nAs a proper preliminary towards the arrangement of your funeral honors,\r\nwe readily admit of your new rank of knighthood. The title is perfectly\r\nin character, and is your own, more by merit than creation. There are\r\nknights of various orders, from the knight of the windmill to the knight\r\nof the post. The former is your patron for exploits, and the latter will\r\nassist you in settling your accounts. No honorary title could be more\r\nhappily applied! The ingenuity is sublime! And your royal master has\r\ndiscovered more genius in fitting you therewith, than in generating the\r\nmost finished figure for a button, or descanting on the properties of a\r\nbutton mould.\r\n\r\nBut how, sir, shall we dispose of you? The invention of a statuary is\r\nexhausted, and Sir William is yet unprovided with a monument. America is\r\nanxious to bestow her funeral favors upon you, and wishes to do it in\r\na manner that shall distinguish you from all the deceased heroes of the\r\nlast war. The Egyptian method of embalming is not known to the\r\npresent age, and hieroglyphical pageantry hath outlived the science\r\nof deciphering it. Some other method, therefore, must be thought of to\r\nimmortalize the new knight of the windmill and post. Sir William, thanks\r\nto his stars, is not oppressed with very delicate ideas. He has no\r\nambition of being wrapped up and handed about in myrrh, aloes and\r\ncassia. Less expensive odors will suffice; and it fortunately happens\r\nthat the simple genius of America has discovered the art of preserving\r\nbodies, and embellishing them too, with much greater frugality than\r\nthe ancients. In balmage, sir, of humble tar, you will be as secure\r\nas Pharaoh, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers, rival in finery all the\r\nmummies of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs you have already made your exit from the moral world, and by\r\nnumberless acts both of passionate and deliberate injustice engraved an\r\n\"here lieth\" on your deceased honor, it must be mere affectation in you\r\nto pretend concern at the humors or opinions of mankind respecting you.\r\nWhat remains of you may expire at any time. The sooner the better. For\r\nhe who survives his reputation, lives out of despite of himself, like a\r\nman listening to his own reproach.\r\n\r\nThus entombed and ornamented, I leave you to the inspection of the\r\ncurious, and return to the history of your yet surviving actions. The\r\ncharacter of Sir William has undergone some extraordinary revolutions.\r\nsince his arrival in America. It is now fixed and known; and we\r\nhave nothing to hope from your candor or to fear from your capacity.\r\nIndolence and inability have too large a share in your composition, ever\r\nto suffer you to be anything more than the hero of little villainies and\r\nunfinished adventures. That, which to some persons appeared moderation\r\nin you at first, was not produced by any real virtue of your own, but\r\nby a contrast of passions, dividing and holding you in perpetual\r\nirresolution. One vice will frequently expel another, without the least\r\nmerit in the man; as powers in contrary directions reduce each other to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt became you to have supported a dignified solemnity of character;\r\nto have shown a superior liberality of soul; to have won respect by an\r\nobstinate perseverance in maintaining order, and to have exhibited on\r\nall occasions such an unchangeable graciousness of conduct, that while\r\nwe beheld in you the resolution of an enemy, we might admire in you the\r\nsincerity of a man. You came to America under the high sounding titles\r\nof commander and commissioner; not only to suppress what you call\r\nrebellion, by arms, but to shame it out of countenance by the excellence\r\nof your example. Instead of which, you have been the patron of low and\r\nvulgar frauds, the encourager of Indian cruelties; and have imported a\r\ncargo of vices blacker than those which you pretend to suppress.\r\n\r\nMankind are not universally agreed in their determination of right and\r\nwrong; but there are certain actions which the consent of all nations\r\nand individuals has branded with the unchangeable name of meanness. In\r\nthe list of human vices we find some of such a refined constitution,\r\nthey cannot be carried into practice without seducing some virtue to\r\ntheir assistance; but meanness has neither alliance nor apology. It is\r\ngenerated in the dust and sweepings of other vices, and is of such a\r\nhateful figure that all the rest conspire to disown it. Sir William, the\r\ncommissioner of George the Third, has at last vouchsafed to give it\r\nrank and pedigree. He has placed the fugitive at the council board, and\r\ndubbed it companion of the order of knighthood.\r\n\r\nThe particular act of meanness which I allude to in this description, is\r\nforgery. You, sir, have abetted and patronized the forging and uttering\r\ncounterfeit continental bills. In the same New York newspapers in which\r\nyour own proclamation under your master's authority was published,\r\noffering, or pretending to offer, pardon and protection to these states,\r\nthere were repeated advertisements of counterfeit money for sale, and\r\npersons who have come officially from you, and under the sanction of\r\nyour flag, have been taken up in attempting to put them off.\r\n\r\nA conduct so basely mean in a public character is without precedent or\r\npretence. Every nation on earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite\r\nin despising you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon society, which nothing can\r\nexcuse or palliate,--an improvement upon beggarly villany--and shows an\r\ninbred wretchedness of heart made up between the venomous malignity of a\r\nserpent and the spiteful imbecility of an inferior reptile.\r\n\r\nThe laws of any civilized country would condemn you to the gibbet\r\nwithout regard to your rank or titles, because it is an action foreign\r\nto the usage and custom of war; and should you fall into our hands,\r\nwhich pray God you may, it will be a doubtful matter whether we are to\r\nconsider you as a military prisoner or a prisoner for felony.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is exceedingly unwise and impolitic in you, or any other\r\npersons in the English service, to promote or even encourage, or wink\r\nat the crime of forgery, in any case whatever. Because, as the riches of\r\nEngland, as a nation, are chiefly in paper, and the far greater part of\r\ntrade among individuals is carried on by the same medium, that is, by\r\nnotes and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all people in the\r\nworld, ought to endeavor to keep forgery out of sight, and, if possible,\r\nnot to revive the idea of it. It is dangerous to make men familiar with\r\na crime which they may afterwards practise to much greater advantage\r\nagainst those who first taught them. Several officers in the English\r\narmy have made their exit at the gallows for forgery on their agents;\r\nfor we all know, who know any thing of England, that there is not a more\r\nnecessitous body of men, taking them generally, than what the English\r\nofficers are. They contrive to make a show at the expense of the\r\ntailors, and appear clean at the charge of the washer-women.\r\n\r\nEngland, has at this time, nearly two hundred million pounds sterling\r\nof public money in paper, for which she has no real property: besides a\r\nlarge circulation of bank notes, bank post bills, and promissory notes\r\nand drafts of private bankers, merchants and tradesmen. She has the\r\ngreatest quantity of paper currency and the least quantity of gold and\r\nsilver of any nation in Europe; the real specie, which is about sixteen\r\nmillions sterling, serves only as change in large sums, which are always\r\nmade in paper, or for payment in small ones. Thus circumstanced, the\r\nnation is put to its wit's end, and obliged to be severe almost to\r\ncriminality, to prevent the practice and growth of forgery. Scarcely\r\na session passes at the Old Bailey, or an execution at Tyburn, but\r\nwitnesses this truth, yet you, sir, regardless of the policy which her\r\nnecessity obliges her to adopt, have made your whole army intimate with\r\nthe crime. And as all armies at the conclusion of a war, are too apt to\r\ncarry into practice the vices of the campaign, it will probably happen,\r\nthat England will hereafter abound in forgeries, to which art the\r\npractitioners were first initiated under your authority in America. You,\r\nsir, have the honor of adding a new vice to the military catalogue; and\r\nthe reason, perhaps, why the invention was reserved for you, is, because\r\nno general before was mean enough even to think of it.\r\n\r\nThat a man whose soul is absorbed in the low traffic of vulgar vice, is\r\nincapable of moving in any superior region, is clearly shown in you by\r\nthe event of every campaign. Your military exploits have been without\r\nplan, object or decision. Can it be possible that you or your employers\r\nsuppose that the possession of Philadelphia will be any ways equal\r\nto the expense or expectation of the nation which supports you? What\r\nadvantages does England derive from any achievements of yours? To her it\r\nis perfectly indifferent what place you are in, so long as the business\r\nof conquest is unperformed and the charge of maintaining you remains the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIf the principal events of the three campaigns be attended to, the\r\nbalance will appear against you at the close of each; but the last, in\r\npoint of importance to us, has exceeded the former two. It is pleasant\r\nto look back on dangers past, and equally as pleasant to meditate on\r\npresent ones when the way out begins to appear. That period is now\r\narrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is changing to the sweeter\r\nprospects of victory and joy. At the close of the campaign, in 1775, you\r\nwere obliged to retreat from Boston. In the summer of 1776, you appeared\r\nwith a numerous fleet and army in the harbor of New York. By what\r\nmiracle the continent was preserved in that season of danger is a\r\nsubject of admiration! If instead of wasting your time against Long\r\nIsland you had run up the North River, and landed any where above\r\nNew York, the consequence must have been, that either you would have\r\ncompelled General Washington to fight you with very unequal numbers, or\r\nhe must have suddenly evacuated the city with the loss of nearly all\r\nthe stores of his army, or have surrendered for want of provisions; the\r\nsituation of the place naturally producing one or the other of these\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe preparations made to defend New York were, nevertheless, wise and\r\nmilitary; because your forces were then at sea, their numbers uncertain;\r\nstorms, sickness, or a variety of accidents might have disabled their\r\ncoming, or so diminished them on their passage, that those which\r\nsurvived would have been incapable of opening the campaign with\r\nany prospect of success; in which case the defence would have been\r\nsufficient and the place preserved; for cities that have been raised\r\nfrom nothing with an infinitude of labor and expense, are not to be\r\nthrown away on the bare probability of their being taken. On these\r\ngrounds the preparations made to maintain New York were as judicious\r\nas the retreat afterwards. While you, in the interim, let slip the very\r\nopportunity which seemed to put conquest in your power.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of that campaign you had nearly double the forces\r\nwhich General Washington immediately commanded. The principal plan at\r\nthat time, on our part, was to wear away the season with as little loss\r\nas possible, and to raise the army for the next year. Long Island, New\r\nYork, Forts Washington and Lee were not defended after your superior\r\nforce was known under any expectation of their being finally maintained,\r\nbut as a range of outworks, in the attacking of which your time might be\r\nwasted, your numbers reduced, and your vanity amused by possessing them\r\non our retreat. It was intended to have withdrawn the garrison from Fort\r\nWashington after it had answered the former of those purposes, but\r\nthe fate of that day put a prize into your hands without much honor to\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\nYour progress through the Jerseys was accidental; you had it not even\r\nin contemplation, or you would not have sent a principal part of your\r\nforces to Rhode Island beforehand. The utmost hope of America in the\r\nyear 1776, reached no higher than that she might not then be conquered.\r\nShe had no expectation of defeating you in that campaign. Even the\r\nmost cowardly Tory allowed, that, could she withstand the shock of that\r\nsummer, her independence would be past a doubt. You had then greatly\r\nthe advantage of her. You were formidable. Your military knowledge\r\nwas supposed to be complete. Your fleets and forces arrived without an\r\naccident. You had neither experience nor reinforcements to wait for.\r\nYou had nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in the first\r\nvigorous onset.\r\n\r\nAmerica was young and unskilled. She was obliged to trust her defence to\r\ntime and practice; and has, by mere dint of perseverance, maintained her\r\ncause, and brought the enemy to a condition, in which she is now capable\r\nof meeting him on any grounds.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in the campaign of 1776 you gained no more,\r\nnotwithstanding your great force, than what was given you by consent of\r\nevacuation, except Fort Washington; while every advantage obtained by\r\nus was by fair and hard fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was\r\ncomplete. The conquest of the Hessians at Trenton, by the remains of a\r\nretreating army, which but a few days before you affected to despise, is\r\nan instance of their heroic perseverance very seldom to be met with.\r\nAnd the victory over the British troops at Princeton, by a harassed and\r\nwearied party, who had been engaged the day before and marched all night\r\nwithout refreshment, is attended with such a scene of circumstances and\r\nsuperiority of generalship, as will ever give it a place in the first\r\nrank in the history of great actions.\r\n\r\nWhen I look back on the gloomy days of last winter, and see America\r\nsuspended by a thread, I feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of\r\nher delivery, and a reverence for the characters which snatched her\r\nfrom destruction. To doubt now would be a species of infidelity, and to\r\nforget the instruments which saved us then would be ingratitude.\r\n\r\nThe close of that campaign left us with the spirit of conquerors. The\r\nnorthern districts were relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over\r\nthe lakes. The army under your command were hunted back and had their\r\nbounds prescribed. The continent began to feel its military importance,\r\nand the winter passed pleasantly away in preparations for the next\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nHowever confident you might be on your first arrival, the result of the\r\nyear 1776 gave you some idea of the difficulty, if not impossibility of\r\nconquest. To this reason I ascribe your delay in opening the campaign of\r\n1777. The face of matters, on the close of the former year, gave you\r\nno encouragement to pursue a discretionary war as soon as the spring\r\nadmitted the taking the field; for though conquest, in that case, would\r\nhave given you a double portion of fame, yet the experiment was too\r\nhazardous. The ministry, had you failed, would have shifted the whole\r\nblame upon you, charged you with having acted without orders, and\r\ncondemned at once both your plan and execution.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the misfortunes, which might have involved you and your money\r\naccounts in perplexity and suspicion, you prudently waited the arrival\r\nof a plan of operations from England, which was that you should proceed\r\nfor Philadelphia by way of the Chesapeake, and that Burgoyne, after\r\nreducing Ticonderoga, should take his route by Albany, and, if\r\nnecessary, join you.\r\n\r\nThe splendid laurels of the last campaign have flourished in the north.\r\nIn that quarter America has surprised the world, and laid the foundation\r\nof this year's glory. The conquest of Ticonderoga, (if it may be called\r\na conquest) has, like all your other victories, led on to ruin. Even the\r\nprovisions taken in that fortress (which by General Burgoyne's return\r\nwas sufficient in bread and flour for nearly 5000 men for ten weeks, and\r\nin beef and pork for the same number of men for one month) served only\r\nto hasten his overthrow, by enabling him to proceed to Saratoga, the\r\nplace of his destruction. A short review of the operations of the last\r\ncampaign will show the condition of affairs on both sides.\r\n\r\nYou have taken Ticonderoga and marched into Philadelphia. These are all\r\nthe events which the year has produced on your part. A trifling campaign\r\nindeed, compared with the expenses of England and the conquest of the\r\ncontinent. On the other side, a considerable part of your northern force\r\nhas been routed by the New York militia under General Herkemer. Fort\r\nStanwix has bravely survived a compound attack of soldiers and savages,\r\nand the besiegers have fled. The Battle of Bennington has put a thousand\r\nprisoners into our hands, with all their arms, stores, artillery and\r\nbaggage. General Burgoyne, in two engagements, has been defeated;\r\nhimself, his army, and all that were his and theirs are now ours.\r\nTiconderoga and Independence [forts] are retaken, and not the shadow of\r\nan enemy remains in all the northern districts. At this instant we\r\nhave upwards of eleven thousand prisoners, between sixty and seventy\r\n[captured] pieces of brass ordnance, besides small arms, tents, stores,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn order to know the real value of those advantages, we must reverse\r\nthe scene, and suppose General Gates and the force he commanded to be at\r\nyour mercy as prisoners, and General Burgoyne, with his army of soldiers\r\nand savages, to be already joined to you in Pennsylvania. So dismal a\r\npicture can scarcely be looked at. It has all the tracings and colorings\r\nof horror and despair; and excites the most swelling emotions of\r\ngratitude by exhibiting the miseries we are so graciously preserved\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nI admire the distribution of laurels around the continent. It is the\r\nearnest of future union. South Carolina has had her day of sufferings\r\nand of fame; and the other southern States have exerted themselves in\r\nproportion to the force that invaded or insulted them. Towards the close\r\nof the campaign, in 1776, these middle States were called upon and did\r\ntheir duty nobly. They were witnesses to the almost expiring flame of\r\nhuman freedom. It was the close struggle of life and death, the line of\r\ninvisible division; and on which the unabated fortitude of a Washington\r\nprevailed, and saved the spark that has since blazed in the north with\r\nunrivalled lustre.\r\n\r\nLet me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed? Through all the\r\nvariety of changes and opportunities which the war has produced, I know\r\nno one action of yours that can be styled masterly. You have moved in\r\nand out, backward and forward, round and round, as if valor consisted in\r\na military jig. The history and figure of your movements would be truly\r\nridiculous could they be justly delineated. They resemble the labors of\r\na puppy pursuing his tail; the end is still at the same distance, and\r\nall the turnings round must be done over again.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga wore such an unpromising\r\naspect, that it was necessary, in July, to detach a part of the forces\r\nto the support of that quarter, which were otherwise destined or\r\nintended to act against you; and this, perhaps, has been the means of\r\npostponing your downfall to another campaign. The destruction of one\r\narmy at a time is work enough. We know, sir, what we are about, what we\r\nhave to do, and how to do it.\r\n\r\nYour progress from the Chesapeake, was marked by no capital stroke of\r\npolicy or heroism. Your principal aim was to get General Washington\r\nbetween the Delaware and Schuylkill, and between Philadelphia and your\r\narmy. In that situation, with a river on each of his flanks, which\r\nunited about five miles below the city, and your army above him, you\r\ncould have intercepted his reinforcements and supplies, cut off all\r\nhis communication with the country, and, if necessary, have despatched\r\nassistance to open a passage for General Burgoyne. This scheme was too\r\nvisible to succeed: for had General Washington suffered you to command\r\nthe open country above him, I think it a very reasonable conjecture that\r\nthe conquest of Burgoyne would not have taken place, because you could,\r\nin that case, have relieved him. It was therefore necessary, while that\r\nimportant victory was in suspense, to trepan you into a situation in\r\nwhich you could only be on the defensive, without the power of\r\naffording him assistance. The manoeuvre had its effect, and Burgoyne was\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nThere has been something unmilitary and passive in you from the time of\r\nyour passing the Schuylkill and getting possession of Philadelphia,\r\nto the close of the campaign. You mistook a trap for a conquest, the\r\nprobability of which had been made known to Europe, and the edge of your\r\ntriumph taken off by our own information long before.\r\n\r\nHaving got you into this situation, a scheme for a general attack upon\r\nyou at Germantown was carried into execution on the 4th of October, and\r\nthough the success was not equal to the excellence of the plan, yet the\r\nattempting it proved the genius of America to be on the rise, and her\r\npower approaching to superiority. The obscurity of the morning was your\r\nbest friend, for a fog is always favorable to a hunted enemy. Some weeks\r\nafter this you likewise planned an attack on General Washington while\r\nat Whitemarsh. You marched out with infinite parade, but on finding him\r\npreparing to attack you next morning, you prudently turned about, and\r\nretreated to Philadelphia with all the precipitation of a man conquered\r\nin imagination.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the battle of Germantown, the probability of\r\nBurgoyne's defeat gave a new policy to affairs in Pennsylvania, and it\r\nwas judged most consistent with the general safety of America, to wait\r\nthe issue of the northern campaign. Slow and sure is sound work. The\r\nnews of that victory arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and\r\nno sooner did that shout of joy, and the report of the thirteen cannon\r\nreach your ears, than you resolved upon a retreat, and the next day,\r\nthat is, on the 19th, you withdrew your drooping army into Philadelphia.\r\nThis movement was evidently dictated by fear; and carried with it a\r\npositive confession that you dreaded a second attack. It was hiding\r\nyourself among women and children, and sleeping away the choicest part\r\nof the campaign in expensive inactivity. An army in a city can never\r\nbe a conquering army. The situation admits only of defence. It is mere\r\nshelter: and every military power in Europe will conclude you to be\r\neventually defeated.\r\n\r\nThe time when you made this retreat was the very time you ought to have\r\nfought a battle, in order to put yourself in condition of recovering in\r\nPennsylvania what you had lost in Saratoga. And the reason why you did\r\nnot, must be either prudence or cowardice; the former supposes your\r\ninability, and the latter needs no explanation. I draw no conclusions,\r\nsir, but such as are naturally deduced from known and visible facts,\r\nand such as will always have a being while the facts which produced them\r\nremain unaltered.\r\n\r\nAfter this retreat a new difficulty arose which exhibited the power of\r\nBritain in a very contemptible light; which was the attack and defence\r\nof Mud Island. For several weeks did that little unfinished fortress\r\nstand out against all the attempts of Admiral and General Howe. It was\r\nthe fable of Bender realized on the Delaware. Scheme after scheme, and\r\nforce upon force were tried and defeated. The garrison, with scarce\r\nanything to cover them but their bravery, survived in the midst of mud,\r\nshot and shells, and were at last obliged to give it up more to the\r\npowers of time and gunpowder than to military superiority of the\r\nbesiegers.\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere opinion that matters are in much worse condition with\r\nyou than what is generally known. Your master's speech at the opening of\r\nParliament, is like a soliloquy on ill luck. It shows him to be coming\r\na little to his reason, for sense of pain is the first symptom of\r\nrecovery, in profound stupefaction. His condition is deplorable. He is\r\nobliged to submit to all the insults of France and Spain, without daring\r\nto know or resent them; and thankful for the most trivial evasions to\r\nthe most humble remonstrances. The time was when he could not deign an\r\nanswer to a petition from America, and the time now is when he dare not\r\ngive an answer to an affront from France. The capture of Burgoyne's army\r\nwill sink his consequence as much in Europe as in America. In his speech\r\nhe expresses his suspicions at the warlike preparations of France and\r\nSpain, and as he has only the one army which you command to support his\r\ncharacter in the world with, it remains very uncertain when, or in what\r\nquarter it will be most wanted, or can be best employed; and this will\r\npartly account for the great care you take to keep it from action and\r\nattacks, for should Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it probably will,\r\nEngland may take her endless farewell not only of all America but of all\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\nNever did a nation invite destruction upon itself with the eagerness and\r\nthe ignorance with which Britain has done. Bent upon the ruin of a\r\nyoung and unoffending country, she has drawn the sword that has wounded\r\nherself to the heart, and in the agony of her resentment has applied a\r\npoison for a cure. Her conduct towards America is a compound of rage and\r\nlunacy; she aims at the government of it, yet preserves neither dignity\r\nnor character in her methods to obtain it. Were government a mere\r\nmanufacture or article of commerce, immaterial by whom it should be made\r\nor sold, we might as well employ her as another, but when we consider\r\nit as the fountain from whence the general manners and morality of a\r\ncountry take their rise, that the persons entrusted with the execution\r\nthereof are by their serious example an authority to support these\r\nprinciples, how abominably absurd is the idea of being hereafter\r\ngoverned by a set of men who have been guilty of forgery, perjury,\r\ntreachery, theft and every species of villany which the lowest wretches\r\non earth could practise or invent. What greater public curse can befall\r\nany country than to be under such authority, and what greater blessing\r\nthan to be delivered therefrom. The soul of any man of sentiment would\r\nrise in brave rebellion against them, and spurn them from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe malignant and venomous tempered General Vaughan has amused his\r\nsavage fancy in burning the whole town of Kingston, in York government,\r\nand the late governor of that state, Mr. Tryon, in his letter to General\r\nParsons, has endeavored to justify it and declared his wish to burn the\r\nhouses of every committeeman in the country. Such a confession from\r\none who was once intrusted with the powers of civil government, is a\r\nreproach to the character. But it is the wish and the declaration of a\r\nman whom anguish and disappointment have driven to despair, and who is\r\ndaily decaying into the grave with constitutional rottenness.\r\n\r\nThere is not in the compass of language a sufficiency of words to\r\nexpress the baseness of your king, his ministry and his army. They\r\nhave refined upon villany till it wants a name. To the fiercer vices of\r\nformer ages they have added the dregs and scummings of the most finished\r\nrascality, and are so completely sunk in serpentine deceit, that there\r\nis not left among them one generous enemy.\r\n\r\nFrom such men and such masters, may the gracious hand of Heaven preserve\r\nAmerica! And though the sufferings she now endures are heavy, and\r\nsevere, they are like straws in the wind compared to the weight of evils\r\nshe would feel under the government of your king, and his pensioned\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThere is something in meanness which excites a species of resentment\r\nthat never subsides, and something in cruelty which stirs up the heart\r\nto the highest agony of human hatred; Britain has filled up both these\r\ncharacters till no addition can be made, and has not reputation left\r\nwith us to obtain credit for the slightest promise. The will of God has\r\nparted us, and the deed is registered for eternity. When she shall be\r\na spot scarcely visible among the nations, America shall flourish the\r\nfavorite of heaven, and the friend of mankind.\r\n\r\nFor the domestic happiness of Britain and the peace of the world, I\r\nwish she had not a foot of land but what is circumscribed within her own\r\nisland. Extent of dominion has been her ruin, and instead of civilizing\r\nothers has brutalized herself. Her late reduction of India, under Clive\r\nand his successors, was not so properly a conquest as an extermination\r\nof mankind. She is the only power who could practise the prodigal\r\nbarbarity of tying men to mouths of loaded cannon and blowing them away.\r\nIt happens that General Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid\r\ntransaction, in the House of Commons, is now a prisoner with us,\r\nand though an enemy, I can appeal to him for the truth of it, being\r\nconfident that he neither can nor will deny it. Yet Clive received the\r\napprobation of the last Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a survey of mankind, we cannot help cursing the wretch,\r\nwho, to the unavoidable misfortunes of nature, shall wilfully add the\r\ncalamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world\r\nwithout studying to increase them, and that life is sufficiently short\r\nwithout shaking the sand that measures it. The histories of Alexander,\r\nand Charles of Sweden, are the histories of human devils; a good man\r\ncannot think of their actions without abhorrence, nor of their deaths\r\nwithout rejoicing. To see the bounties of heaven destroyed, the\r\nbeautiful face of nature laid waste, and the choicest works of creation\r\nand art tumbled into ruin, would fetch a curse from the soul of piety\r\nitself. But in this country the aggravation is heightened by a new\r\ncombination of affecting circumstances. America was young, and, compared\r\nwith other countries, was virtuous. None but a Herod of uncommon malice\r\nwould have made war upon infancy and innocence: and none but a people\r\nof the most finished fortitude, dared under those circumstances, have\r\nresisted the tyranny. The natives, or their ancestors, had fled from the\r\nformer oppressions of England, and with the industry of bees had changed\r\na wilderness into a habitable world. To Britain they were indebted for\r\nnothing. The country was the gift of heaven, and God alone is their Lord\r\nand Sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe time, sir, will come when you, in a melancholy hour, shall reckon up\r\nyour miseries by your murders in America. Life, with you, begins to wear\r\na clouded aspect. The vision of pleasurable delusion is wearing away,\r\nand changing to the barren wild of age and sorrow. The poor reflection\r\nof having served your king will yield you no consolation in your\r\nparting moments. He will crumble to the same undistinguished ashes with\r\nyourself, and have sins enough of his own to answer for. It is not the\r\nfarcical benedictions of a bishop, nor the cringing hypocrisy of a court\r\nof chaplains, nor the formality of an act of Parliament, that can change\r\nguilt into innocence, or make the punishment one pang the less. You may,\r\nperhaps, be unwilling to be serious, but this destruction of the goods\r\nof Providence, this havoc of the human race, and this sowing the world\r\nwith mischief, must be accounted for to him who made and governs it.\r\nTo us they are only present sufferings, but to him they are deep\r\nrebellions.\r\n\r\nIf there is a sin superior to every other, it is that of wilful and\r\noffensive war. Most other sins are circumscribed within narrow limits,\r\nthat is, the power of one man cannot give them a very general extension,\r\nand many kinds of sins have only a mental existence from which no\r\ninfection arises; but he who is the author of a war, lets loose the\r\nwhole contagion of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death.\r\nWe leave it to England and Indians to boast of these honors; we feel no\r\nthirst for such savage glory; a nobler flame, a purer spirit animates\r\nAmerica. She has taken up the sword of virtuous defence; she has bravely\r\nput herself between Tyranny and Freedom, between a curse and a blessing,\r\ndetermined to expel the one and protect the other.\r\n\r\nIt is the object only of war that makes it honorable. And if there was\r\never a just war since the world began, it is this in which America is\r\nnow engaged. She invaded no land of yours. She hired no mercenaries to\r\nburn your towns, nor Indians to massacre their inhabitants. She\r\nwanted nothing from you, and was indebted for nothing to you: and thus\r\ncircumstanced, her defence is honorable and her prosperity is certain.\r\n\r\nYet it is not on the justice only, but likewise on the importance of\r\nthis cause that I ground my seeming enthusiastical confidence of our\r\nsuccess. The vast extension of America makes her of too much value in\r\nthe scale of Providence, to be cast like a pearl before swine, at the\r\nfeet of an European island; and of much less consequence would it be\r\nthat Britain were sunk in the sea than that America should miscarry.\r\nThere has been such a chain of extraordinary events in the discovery of\r\nthis country at first, in the peopling and planting it afterwards, in\r\nthe rearing and nursing it to its present state, and in the protection\r\nof it through the present war, that no man can doubt, but Providence\r\nhas some nobler end to accomplish than the gratification of the petty\r\nelector of Hanover, or the ignorant and insignificant king of Britain.\r\n\r\nAs the blood of the martyrs has been the seed of the Christian church,\r\nso the political persecutions of England will and have already enriched\r\nAmerica with industry, experience, union, and importance. Before the\r\npresent era she was a mere chaos of uncemented colonies, individually\r\nexposed to the ravages of the Indians and the invasion of any power that\r\nBritain should be at war with. She had nothing that she could call her\r\nown. Her felicity depended upon accident. The convulsions of Europe\r\nmight have thrown her from one conqueror to another, till she had been\r\nthe slave of all, and ruined by every one; for until she had spirit\r\nenough to become her own master, there was no knowing to which master\r\nshe should belong. That period, thank God, is past, and she is no longer\r\nthe dependent, disunited colonies of Britain, but the independent and\r\nUnited States of America, knowing no master but heaven and herself. You,\r\nor your king, may call this \"delusion,\" \"rebellion,\" or what name you\r\nplease. To us it is perfectly indifferent. The issue will determine the\r\ncharacter, and time will give it a name as lasting as his own.\r\n\r\nYou have now, sir, tried the fate of three campaigns, and can fully\r\ndeclare to England, that nothing is to be got on your part, but blows\r\nand broken bones, and nothing on hers but waste of trade and credit, and\r\nan increase of poverty and taxes. You are now only where you might have\r\nbeen two years ago, without the loss of a single ship, and yet not a\r\nstep more forward towards the conquest of the continent; because, as I\r\nhave already hinted, \"an army in a city can never be a conquering army.\"\r\nThe full amount of your losses, since the beginning of the war, exceeds\r\ntwenty thousand men, besides millions of treasure, for which you have\r\nnothing in exchange. Our expenses, though great, are circulated within\r\nourselves. Yours is a direct sinking of money, and that from both ends\r\nat once; first, in hiring troops out of the nation, and in paying them\r\nafterwards, because the money in neither case can return to Britain. We\r\nare already in possession of the prize, you only in pursuit of it. To\r\nus it is a real treasure, to you it would be only an empty triumph. Our\r\nexpenses will repay themselves with tenfold interest, while yours entail\r\nupon you everlasting poverty.\r\n\r\nTake a review, sir, of the ground which you have gone over, and let\r\nit teach you policy, if it cannot honesty. You stand but on a very\r\ntottering foundation. A change of the ministry in England may probably\r\nbring your measures into question, and your head to the block. Clive,\r\nwith all his successes, had some difficulty in escaping, and yours being\r\nall a war of losses, will afford you less pretensions, and your enemies\r\nmore grounds for impeachment.\r\n\r\nGo home, sir, and endeavor to save the remains of your ruined country,\r\nby a just representation of the madness of her measures. A few moments,\r\nwell applied, may yet preserve her from political destruction. I am not\r\none of those who wish to see Europe in a flame, because I am persuaded\r\nthat such an event will not shorten the war. The rupture, at present,\r\nis confined between the two powers of America and England. England finds\r\nthat she cannot conquer America, and America has no wish to conquer\r\nEngland. You are fighting for what you can never obtain, and we\r\ndefending what we never mean to part with. A few words, therefore,\r\nsettle the bargain. Let England mind her own business and we will mind\r\nours. Govern yourselves, and we will govern ourselves. You may then\r\ntrade where you please unmolested by us, and we will trade where we\r\nplease unmolested by you; and such articles as we can purchase of each\r\nother better than elsewhere may be mutually done. If it were possible\r\nthat you could carry on the war for twenty years you must still come to\r\nthis point at last, or worse, and the sooner you think of it the better\r\nit will be for you.\r\n\r\nMy official situation enables me to know the repeated insults which\r\nBritain is obliged to put up with from foreign powers, and the wretched\r\nshifts that she is driven to, to gloss them over. Her reduced strength\r\nand exhausted coffers in a three years' war with America, has given a\r\npowerful superiority to France and Spain. She is not now a match\r\nfor them. But if neither councils can prevail on her to think, nor\r\nsufferings awaken her to reason, she must e'en go on, till the honor of\r\nEngland becomes a proverb of contempt, and Europe dub her the Land of\r\nFools.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, with every wish for an honorable peace,\r\n\r\n            Your friend, enemy, and countryman,\r\n\r\n                                       COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TO THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWITH all the pleasure with which a man exchanges bad company for good,\r\nI take my leave of Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly three\r\nyears since the tyranny of Britain received its first repulse by the\r\narms of America. A period which has given birth to a new world, and\r\nerected a monument to the folly of the old.\r\n\r\nI cannot help being sometimes surprised at the complimentary references\r\nwhich I have seen and heard made to ancient histories and transactions.\r\nThe wisdom, civil governments, and sense of honor of the states of\r\nGreece and Rome, are frequently held up as objects of excellence and\r\nimitation. Mankind have lived to very little purpose, if, at this period\r\nof the world, they must go two or three thousand years back for lessons\r\nand examples. We do great injustice to ourselves by placing them in such\r\na superior line. We have no just authority for it, neither can we tell\r\nwhy it is that we should suppose ourselves inferior.\r\n\r\nCould the mist of antiquity be cleared away, and men and things be\r\nviewed as they really were, it is more than probable that they would\r\nadmire us, rather than we them. America has surmounted a greater variety\r\nand combination of difficulties, than, I believe, ever fell to the share\r\nof any one people, in the same space of time, and has replenished the\r\nworld with more useful knowledge and sounder maxims of civil government\r\nthan were ever produced in any age before. Had it not been for America,\r\nthere had been no such thing as freedom left throughout the whole\r\nuniverse. England has lost hers in a long chain of right reasoning from\r\nwrong principles, and it is from this country, now, that she must learn\r\nthe resolution to redress herself, and the wisdom how to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThe Grecians and Romans were strongly possessed of the spirit of liberty\r\nbut not the principle, for at the time that they were determined not to\r\nbe slaves themselves, they employed their power to enslave the rest of\r\nmankind. But this distinguished era is blotted by no one misanthropical\r\nvice. In short, if the principle on which the cause is founded, the\r\nuniversal blessings that are to arise from it, the difficulties that\r\naccompanied it, the wisdom with which it has been debated, the fortitude\r\nby which it has been supported, the strength of the power which we had\r\nto oppose, and the condition in which we undertook it, be all taken\r\nin one view, we may justly style it the most virtuous and illustrious\r\nrevolution that ever graced the history of mankind.\r\n\r\nA good opinion of ourselves is exceedingly necessary in private life,\r\nbut absolutely necessary in public life, and of the utmost importance in\r\nsupporting national character. I have no notion of yielding the palm of\r\nthe United States to any Grecians or Romans that were ever born. We\r\nhave equalled the bravest in times of danger, and excelled the wisest in\r\nconstruction of civil governments.\r\n\r\nFrom this agreeable eminence let us take a review of present affairs.\r\nThe spirit of corruption is so inseparably interwoven with British\r\npolitics, that their ministry suppose all mankind are governed by the\r\nsame motives. They have no idea of a people submitting even to temporary\r\ninconvenience from an attachment to rights and privileges. Their plans\r\nof business are calculated by the hour and for the hour, and are uniform\r\nin nothing but the corruption which gives them birth. They never had,\r\nneither have they at this time, any regular plan for the conquest of\r\nAmerica by arms. They know not how to go about it, neither have they\r\npower to effect it if they did know. The thing is not within the compass\r\nof human practicability, for America is too extensive either to be fully\r\nconquered or passively defended. But she may be actively defended by\r\ndefeating or making prisoners of the army that invades her. And this is\r\nthe only system of defence that can be effectual in a large country.\r\n\r\nThere is something in a war carried on by invasion which makes it differ\r\nin circumstances from any other mode of war, because he who conducts it\r\ncannot tell whether the ground he gains be for him, or against him, when\r\nhe first obtains it. In the winter of 1776, General Howe marched with\r\nan air of victory through the Jerseys, the consequence of which was his\r\ndefeat; and General Burgoyne at Saratoga experienced the same fate from\r\nthe same cause. The Spaniards, about two years ago, were defeated by\r\nthe Algerines in the same manner, that is, their first triumphs became\r\na trap in which they were totally routed. And whoever will attend to\r\nthe circumstances and events of a war carried on by invasion, will find,\r\nthat any invader, in order to be finally conquered must first begin to\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nI confess myself one of those who believe the loss of Philadelphia to\r\nbe attended with more advantages than injuries. The case stood thus:\r\nThe enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more importance to us than it\r\nreally was; for we all know that it had long ceased to be a port: not a\r\ncargo of goods had been brought into it for near a twelvemonth, nor any\r\nfixed manufactories, nor even ship-building, carried on in it; yet as\r\nthe enemy believed the conquest of it to be practicable, and to that\r\nbelief added the absurd idea that the soul of all America was centred\r\nthere, and would be conquered there, it naturally follows that their\r\npossession of it, by not answering the end proposed, must break up the\r\nplans they had so foolishly gone upon, and either oblige them to form a\r\nnew one, for which their present strength is not sufficient, or to give\r\nover the attempt.\r\n\r\nWe never had so small an army to fight against, nor so fair an\r\nopportunity of final success as now. The death wound is already given.\r\nThe day is ours if we follow it up. The enemy, by his situation, is\r\nwithin our reach, and by his reduced strength is within our power. The\r\nministers of Britain may rage as they please, but our part is to conquer\r\ntheir armies. Let them wrangle and welcome, but let, it not draw our\r\nattention from the one thing needful. Here, in this spot is our own\r\nbusiness to be accomplished, our felicity secured. What we have now to\r\ndo is as clear as light, and the way to do it is as straight as a\r\nline. It needs not to be commented upon, yet, in order to be perfectly\r\nunderstood I will put a case that cannot admit of a mistake.\r\n\r\nHad the armies under Generals Howe and Burgoyne been united, and taken\r\npost at Germantown, and had the northern army under General Gates been\r\njoined to that under General Washington, at Whitemarsh, the consequence\r\nwould have been a general action; and if in that action we had killed\r\nand taken the same number of officers and men, that is, between nine and\r\nten thousand, with the same quantity of artillery, arms, stores, etc.,\r\nas have been taken at the northward, and obliged General Howe with the\r\nremains of his army, that is, with the same number he now commands, to\r\ntake shelter in Philadelphia, we should certainly have thought ourselves\r\nthe greatest heroes in the world; and should, as soon as the season\r\npermitted, have collected together all the force of the continent and\r\nlaid siege to the city, for it requires a much greater force to besiege\r\nan enemy in a town than to defeat him in the field. The case now is just\r\nthe same as if it had been produced by the means I have here supposed.\r\nBetween nine and ten thousand have been killed and taken, all their\r\nstores are in our possession, and General Howe, in consequence of that\r\nvictory, has thrown himself for shelter into Philadelphia. He, or his\r\ntrifling friend Galloway, may form what pretences they please, yet no\r\njust reason can be given for their going into winter quarters so early\r\nas the 19th of October, but their apprehensions of a defeat if they\r\ncontinued out, or their conscious inability of keeping the field with\r\nsafety. I see no advantage which can arise to America by hunting the\r\nenemy from state to state. It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly\r\nunworthy the attention of a people determined to conquer. Neither can\r\nany state promise itself security while the enemy remains in a condition\r\nto transport themselves from one part of the continent to another. Howe,\r\nlikewise, cannot conquer where we have no army to oppose, therefore any\r\nsuch removals in him are mean and cowardly, and reduces Britain to a\r\ncommon pilferer. If he retreats from Philadelphia, he will be despised;\r\nif he stays, he may be shut up and starved out, and the country, if he\r\nadvances into it, may become his Saratoga. He has his choice of evils\r\nand we of opportunities. If he moves early, it is not only a sign but a\r\nproof that he expects no reinforcement, and his delay will prove that he\r\neither waits for the arrival of a plan to go upon, or force to execute\r\nit, or both; in which case our strength will increase more than his,\r\ntherefore in any case we cannot be wrong if we do but proceed.\r\n\r\nThe particular condition of Pennsylvania deserves the attention of all\r\nthe other States. Her military strength must not be estimated by\r\nthe number of inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, characters,\r\nprofessions and interests. Here are the firmest Whigs, surviving,\r\nlike sparks in the ocean, unquenched and uncooled in the midst of\r\ndiscouragement and disaffection. Here are men losing their all with\r\ncheerfulness, and collecting fire and fortitude from the flames of their\r\nown estates. Here are others skulking in secret, many making a market\r\nof the times, and numbers who are changing to Whig or Tory with the\r\ncircumstances of every day.\r\n\r\nIt is by a mere dint of fortitude and perseverance that the Whigs of\r\nthis State have been able to maintain so good a countenance, and do even\r\nwhat they have done. We want help, and the sooner it can arrive the more\r\neffectual it will be. The invaded State, be it which it may, will always\r\nfeel an additional burden upon its back, and be hard set to support its\r\ncivil power with sufficient authority; and this difficulty will rise or\r\nfall, in proportion as the other states throw in their assistance to the\r\ncommon cause.\r\n\r\nThe enemy will most probably make many manoeuvres at the opening of this\r\ncampaign, to amuse and draw off the attention of the several States from\r\nthe one thing needful. We may expect to hear of alarms and pretended\r\nexpeditions to this place and that place, to the southward, the\r\neastward, and the northward, all intended to prevent our forming\r\ninto one formidable body. The less the enemy's strength is, the more\r\nsubtleties of this kind will they make use of. Their existence depends\r\nupon it, because the force of America, when collected, is sufficient\r\nto swallow their present army up. It is therefore our business to make\r\nshort work of it, by bending our whole attention to this one principal\r\npoint, for the instant that the main body under General Howe is\r\ndefeated, all the inferior alarms throughout the continent, like so many\r\nshadows, will follow his downfall.\r\n\r\nThe only way to finish a war with the least possible bloodshed, or\r\nperhaps without any, is to collect an army, against the power of which\r\nthe enemy shall have no chance. By not doing this, we prolong the war,\r\nand double both the calamities and expenses of it. What a rich and happy\r\ncountry would America be, were she, by a vigorous exertion, to reduce\r\nHowe as she has reduced Burgoyne. Her currency would rise to millions\r\nbeyond its present value. Every man would be rich, and every man would\r\nhave it in his power to be happy. And why not do these things? What\r\nis there to hinder? America is her own mistress and can do what she\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nIf we had not at this time a man in the field, we could, nevertheless,\r\nraise an army in a few weeks sufficient to overwhelm all the force\r\nwhich General Howe at present commands. Vigor and determination will do\r\nanything and everything. We began the war with this kind of spirit, why\r\nnot end it with the same? Here, gentlemen, is the enemy. Here is the\r\narmy. The interest, the happiness of all America, is centred in this\r\nhalf ruined spot. Come and help us. Here are laurels, come and share\r\nthem. Here are Tories, come and help us to expel them. Here are Whigs\r\nthat will make you welcome, and enemies that dread your coming.\r\n\r\nThe worst of all policies is that of doing things by halves. Penny-wise\r\nand pound-foolish, has been the ruin of thousands. The present spring,\r\nif rightly improved, will free us from our troubles, and save us\r\nthe expense of millions. We have now only one army to cope with. No\r\nopportunity can be fairer; no prospect more promising. I shall conclude\r\nthis paper with a few outlines of a plan, either for filling up the\r\nbattalions with expedition, or for raising an additional force, for any\r\nlimited time, on any sudden emergency.\r\n\r\nThat in which every man is interested, is every man's duty to support.\r\nAnd any burden which falls equally on all men, and from which every\r\nman is to receive an equal benefit, is consistent with the most perfect\r\nideas of liberty. I would wish to revive something of that virtuous\r\nambition which first called America into the field. Then every man was\r\neager to do his part, and perhaps the principal reason why we have in\r\nany degree fallen therefrom, is because we did not set a right value by\r\nit at first, but left it to blaze out of itself, instead of regulating\r\nand preserving it by just proportions of rest and service.\r\n\r\nSuppose any State whose number of effective inhabitants was 80,000,\r\nshould be required to furnish 3,200 men towards the defence of the\r\ncontinent on any sudden emergency.\r\n\r\n1st, Let the whole number of effective inhabitants be divided into\r\nhundreds; then if each of those hundreds turn out four men, the whole\r\nnumber of 3,200 will be had.\r\n\r\n2d, Let the name of each hundred men be entered in a book, and let four\r\ndollars be collected from each man, with as much more as any of the\r\ngentlemen, whose abilities can afford it, shall please to throw in,\r\nwhich gifts likewise shall be entered against the names of the donors.\r\n\r\n3d, Let the sums so collected be offered as a present, over and above\r\nthe bounty of twenty dollars, to any four who may be inclined to propose\r\nthemselves as volunteers: if more than four offer, the majority of the\r\nsubscribers present shall determine which; if none offer, then four out\r\nof the hundred shall be taken by lot, who shall be entitled to the said\r\nsums, and shall either go, or provide others that will, in the space of\r\nsix days.\r\n\r\n4th, As it will always happen that in the space of ground on which a\r\nhundred men shall live, there will be always a number of persons who, by\r\nage and infirmity, are incapable of doing personal service, and as such\r\npersons are generally possessed of the greatest part of property in any\r\ncountry, their portion of service, therefore, will be to furnish each\r\nman with a blanket, which will make a regimental coat, jacket, and\r\nbreeches, or clothes in lieu thereof, and another for a watch cloak,\r\nand two pair of shoes; for however choice people may be of these things\r\nmatters not in cases of this kind; those who live always in houses can\r\nfind many ways to keep themselves warm, but it is a shame and a sin to\r\nsuffer a soldier in the field to want a blanket while there is one in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nShould the clothing not be wanted, the superannuated or infirm persons\r\npossessing property, may, in lieu thereof, throw in their money\r\nsubscriptions towards increasing the bounty; for though age will\r\nnaturally exempt a person from personal service, it cannot exempt him\r\nfrom his share of the charge, because the men are raised for the defence\r\nof property and liberty jointly.\r\n\r\nThere never was a scheme against which objections might not be raised.\r\nBut this alone is not a sufficient reason for rejection. The only line\r\nto judge truly upon is to draw out and admit all the objections which\r\ncan fairly be made, and place against them all the contrary qualities,\r\nconveniences and advantages, then by striking a balance you come at the\r\ntrue character of any scheme, principle or position.\r\n\r\nThe most material advantages of the plan here proposed are, ease,\r\nexpedition, and cheapness; yet the men so raised get a much larger\r\nbounty than is any where at present given; because all the expenses,\r\nextravagance, and consequent idleness of recruiting are saved or\r\nprevented. The country incurs no new debt nor interest thereon; the\r\nwhole matter being all settled at once and entirely done with. It is\r\na subscription answering all the purposes of a tax, without either the\r\ncharge or trouble of collecting. The men are ready for the field with\r\nthe greatest possible expedition, because it becomes the duty of the\r\ninhabitants themselves, in every part of the country, to find their\r\nproportion of men instead of leaving it to a recruiting sergeant, who,\r\nbe he ever so industrious, cannot know always where to apply.\r\n\r\nI do not propose this as a regular digested plan, neither will the\r\nlimits of this paper admit of any further remarks upon it. I believe it\r\nto be a hint capable of much improvement, and as such submit it to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n                                       COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nLANCASTER, March 21, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS VI. (TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE AND GENERAL CLINTON)\r\n\r\n\r\n            TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE, GENERAL CLINTON, AND\r\n              WILLIAM EDEN, ESQ., BRITISH COMMISSIONERS\r\n                             AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is a dignity in the warm passions of a Whig, which is never to be\r\nfound in the cold malice of a Tory. In the one nature is only heated--in\r\nthe other she is poisoned. The instant the former has it in his power to\r\npunish, he feels a disposition to forgive; but the canine venom of the\r\nlatter knows no relief but revenge. This general distinction will, I\r\nbelieve, apply in all cases, and suits as well the meridian of England\r\nas America.\r\n\r\nAs I presume your last proclamation will undergo the strictures of other\r\npens, I shall confine my remarks to only a few parts thereof. All that\r\nyou have said might have been comprised in half the compass. It is\r\ntedious and unmeaning, and only a repetition of your former follies,\r\nwith here and there an offensive aggravation. Your cargo of pardons will\r\nhave no market. It is unfashionable to look at them--even speculation\r\nis at an end. They have become a perfect drug, and no way calculated for\r\nthe climate.\r\n\r\nIn the course of your proclamation you say, \"The policy as well as the\r\nbenevolence of Great Britain have thus far checked the extremes of war,\r\nwhen they tended to distress a people still considered as their fellow\r\nsubjects, and to desolate a country shortly to become again a source of\r\nmutual advantage.\" What you mean by \"the benevolence of Great Britain\"\r\nis to me inconceivable. To put a plain question; do you consider\r\nyourselves men or devils? For until this point is settled, no\r\ndeterminate sense can be put upon the expression. You have already\r\nequalled and in many cases excelled, the savages of either Indies; and\r\nif you have yet a cruelty in store you must have imported it, unmixed\r\nwith every human material, from the original warehouse of hell.\r\n\r\nTo the interposition of Providence, and her blessings on our endeavors,\r\nand not to British benevolence are we indebted for the short chain that\r\nlimits your ravages. Remember you do not, at this time, command a foot\r\nof land on the continent of America. Staten Island, York Island, a small\r\npart of Long Island, and Rhode Island, circumscribe your power; and even\r\nthose you hold at the expense of the West Indies. To avoid a defeat, or\r\nprevent a desertion of your troops, you have taken up your quarters in\r\nholes and corners of inaccessible security; and in order to conceal what\r\nevery one can perceive, you now endeavor to impose your weakness upon\r\nus for an act of mercy. If you think to succeed by such shadowy devices,\r\nyou are but infants in the political world; you have the A, B, C, of\r\nstratagem yet to learn, and are wholly ignorant of the people you have\r\nto contend with. Like men in a state of intoxication, you forget that\r\nthe rest of the world have eyes, and that the same stupidity which\r\nconceals you from yourselves exposes you to their satire and contempt.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph which I have quoted, stands as an introduction to the\r\nfollowing: \"But when that country [America] professes the unnatural\r\ndesign, not only of estranging herself from us, but of mortgaging\r\nherself and her resources to our enemies, the whole contest is changed:\r\nand the question is how far Great Britain may, by every means in her\r\npower, destroy or render useless, a connection contrived for her ruin,\r\nand the aggrandizement of France. Under such circumstances, the laws\r\nof self-preservation must direct the conduct of Britain, and, if the\r\nBritish colonies are to become an accession to France, will direct her\r\nto render that accession of as little avail as possible to her enemy.\"\r\n\r\nI consider you in this declaration, like madmen biting in the hour of\r\ndeath. It contains likewise a fraudulent meanness; for, in order to\r\njustify a barbarous conclusion, you have advanced a false position. The\r\ntreaty we have formed with France is open, noble, and generous. It is\r\ntrue policy, founded on sound philosophy, and neither a surrender\r\nor mortgage, as you would scandalously insinuate. I have seen every\r\narticle, and speak from positive knowledge. In France, we have found an\r\naffectionate friend and faithful ally; in Britain, we have found nothing\r\nbut tyranny, cruelty, and infidelity.\r\n\r\nBut the happiness is, that the mischief you threaten, is not in your\r\npower to execute; and if it were, the punishment would return upon you\r\nin a ten-fold degree. The humanity of America has hitherto restrained\r\nher from acts of retaliation, and the affection she retains for\r\nmany individuals in England, who have fed, clothed and comforted her\r\nprisoners, has, to the present day, warded off her resentment, and\r\noperated as a screen to the whole. But even these considerations\r\nmust cease, when national objects interfere and oppose them. Repeated\r\naggravations will provoke a retort, and policy justify the measure. We\r\nmean now to take you seriously up upon your own ground and principle,\r\nand as you do, so shall you be done by.\r\n\r\nYou ought to know, gentlemen, that England and Scotland, are far more\r\nexposed to incendiary desolation than America, in her present state, can\r\npossibly be. We occupy a country, with but few towns, and whose riches\r\nconsist in land and annual produce. The two last can suffer but little,\r\nand that only within a very limited compass. In Britain it is otherwise.\r\nHer wealth lies chiefly in cities and large towns, the depositories\r\nof manufactures and fleets of merchantmen. There is not a nobleman's\r\ncountry seat but may be laid in ashes by a single person. Your own\r\nmay probably contribute to the proof: in short, there is no evil which\r\ncannot be returned when you come to incendiary mischief. The ships in\r\nthe Thames, may certainly be as easily set on fire, as the temporary\r\nbridge was a few years ago; yet of that affair no discovery was ever\r\nmade; and the loss you would sustain by such an event, executed at a\r\nproper season, is infinitely greater than any you can inflict. The East\r\nIndia House and the Bank, neither are nor can be secure from this sort\r\nof destruction, and, as Dr. Price justly observes, a fire at the latter\r\nwould bankrupt the nation. It has never been the custom of France and\r\nEngland when at war, to make those havocs on each other, because the\r\nease with which they could retaliate rendered it as impolitic as if each\r\nhad destroyed his own.\r\n\r\nBut think not, gentlemen, that our distance secures you, or our\r\ninvention fails us. We can much easier accomplish such a point than any\r\nnation in Europe. We talk the same language, dress in the same habit,\r\nand appear with the same manners as yourselves. We can pass from\r\none part of England to another unsuspected; many of us are as well\r\nacquainted with the country as you are, and should you impolitically\r\nprovoke us, you will most assuredly lament the effects of it. Mischiefs\r\nof this kind require no army to execute them. The means are obvious, and\r\nthe opportunities unguardable. I hold up a warning to our senses, if you\r\nhave any left, and \"to the unhappy people likewise, whose affairs are\r\ncommitted to you.\"* I call not with the rancor of an enemy, but the\r\nearnestness of a friend, on the deluded people of England, lest, between\r\nyour blunders and theirs, they sink beneath the evils contrived for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * General [Sir H.] Clinton's letter to Congress.\r\n\r\n\"He who lives in a glass house,\" says a Spanish proverb, \"should never\r\nbegin throwing stones.\" This, gentlemen, is exactly your case, and you\r\nmust be the most ignorant of mankind, or suppose us so, not to see on\r\nwhich side the balance of accounts will fall. There are many other modes\r\nof retaliation, which, for several reasons, I choose not to mention. But\r\nbe assured of this, that the instant you put your threat into execution,\r\na counter-blow will follow it. If you openly profess yourselves savages,\r\nit is high time we should treat you as such, and if nothing but distress\r\ncan recover you to reason, to punish will become an office of charity.\r\n\r\nWhile your fleet lay last winter in the Delaware, I offered my service\r\nto the Pennsylvania Navy Board then at Trenton, as one who would make\r\na party with them, or any four or five gentlemen, on an expedition down\r\nthe river to set fire to it, and though it was not then accepted, nor\r\nthe thing personally attempted, it is more than probable that your own\r\nfolly will provoke a much more ruinous act. Say not when mischief is\r\ndone, that you had not warning, and remember that we do not begin it,\r\nbut mean to repay it. Thus much for your savage and impolitic threat.\r\n\r\nIn another part of your proclamation you say, \"But if the honors of\r\na military life are become the object of the Americans, let them seek\r\nthose honors under the banners of their rightful sovereign, and in\r\nfighting the battles of the united British Empire, against our late\r\nmutual and natural enemies.\" Surely! the union of absurdity with madness\r\nwas never marked in more distinguishable lines than these. Your rightful\r\nsovereign, as you call him, may do well enough for you, who dare not\r\ninquire into the humble capacities of the man; but we, who estimate\r\npersons and things by their real worth, cannot suffer our judgments to\r\nbe so imposed upon; and unless it is your wish to see him exposed, it\r\nought to be your endeavor to keep him out of sight. The less you have\r\nto say about him the better. We have done with him, and that ought to\r\nbe answer enough. You have been often told so. Strange! that the answer\r\nmust be so often repeated. You go a-begging with your king as with a\r\nbrat, or with some unsaleable commodity you were tired of; and though\r\nevery body tells you no, no, still you keep hawking him about. But\r\nthere is one that will have him in a little time, and as we have no\r\ninclination to disappoint you of a customer, we bid nothing for him.\r\n\r\nThe impertinent folly of the paragraph that I have just quoted, deserves\r\nno other notice than to be laughed at and thrown by, but the principle\r\non which it is founded is detestable. We are invited to submit to a man\r\nwho has attempted by every cruelty to destroy us, and to join him in\r\nmaking war against France, who is already at war against him for our\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nCan Bedlam, in concert with Lucifer, form a more mad and devilish\r\nrequest? Were it possible a people could sink into such apostacy they\r\nwould deserve to be swept from the earth like the inhabitants of Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah. The proposition is an universal affront to the rank which\r\nman holds in the creation, and an indignity to him who placed him\r\nthere. It supposes him made up without a spark of honor, and under no\r\nobligation to God or man.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of men or Christians must you suppose the Americans to be,\r\nwho, after seeing their most humble petitions insultingly rejected;\r\nthe most grievous laws passed to distress them in every quarter; an\r\nundeclared war let loose upon them, and Indians and negroes invited to\r\nthe slaughter; who, after seeing their kinsmen murdered, their fellow\r\ncitizens starved to death in prisons, and their houses and property\r\ndestroyed and burned; who, after the most serious appeals to heaven, the\r\nmost solemn abjuration by oath of all government connected with you, and\r\nthe most heart-felt pledges and protestations of faith to each other;\r\nand who, after soliciting the friendship, and entering into alliances\r\nwith other nations, should at last break through all these obligations,\r\ncivil and divine, by complying with your horrid and infernal proposal.\r\nOught we ever after to be considered as a part of the human race? Or\r\nought we not rather to be blotted from the society of mankind, and\r\nbecome a spectacle of misery to the world? But there is something in\r\ncorruption, which, like a jaundiced eye, transfers the color of itself\r\nto the object it looks upon, and sees every thing stained and impure;\r\nfor unless you were capable of such conduct yourselves, you would never\r\nhave supposed such a character in us. The offer fixes your infamy. It\r\nexhibits you as a nation without faith; with whom oaths and treaties\r\nare considered as trifles, and the breaking them as the breaking of a\r\nbubble. Regard to decency, or to rank, might have taught you better; or\r\npride inspired you, though virtue could not. There is not left a step in\r\nthe degradation of character to which you can now descend; you have put\r\nyour foot on the ground floor, and the key of the dungeon is turned upon\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThat the invitation may want nothing of being a complete monster,\r\nyou have thought proper to finish it with an assertion which has no\r\nfoundation, either in fact or philosophy; and as Mr. Ferguson, your\r\nsecretary, is a man of letters, and has made civil society his study,\r\nand published a treatise on that subject, I address this part to him.\r\n\r\nIn the close of the paragraph which I last quoted, France is styled the\r\n\"natural enemy\" of England, and by way of lugging us into some strange\r\nidea, she is styled \"the late mutual and natural enemy\" of both\r\ncountries. I deny that she ever was the natural enemy of either; and\r\nthat there does not exist in nature such a principle. The expression\r\nis an unmeaning barbarism, and wholly unphilosophical, when applied to\r\nbeings of the same species, let their station in the creation be what\r\nit may. We have a perfect idea of a natural enemy when we think of the\r\ndevil, because the enmity is perpetual, unalterable and unabateable. It\r\nadmits, neither of peace, truce, or treaty; consequently the warfare is\r\neternal, and therefore it is natural. But man with man cannot arrange\r\nin the same opposition. Their quarrels are accidental and equivocally\r\ncreated. They become friends or enemies as the change of temper, or the\r\ncast of interest inclines them. The Creator of man did not constitute\r\nthem the natural enemy of each other. He has not made any one order of\r\nbeings so. Even wolves may quarrel, still they herd together. If any two\r\nnations are so, then must all nations be so, otherwise it is not nature\r\nbut custom, and the offence frequently originates with the accuser.\r\nEngland is as truly the natural enemy of France, as France is of\r\nEngland, and perhaps more so. Separated from the rest of Europe, she\r\nhas contracted an unsocial habit of manners, and imagines in others the\r\njealousy she creates in herself. Never long satisfied with peace,\r\nshe supposes the discontent universal, and buoyed up with her own\r\nimportance, conceives herself the only object pointed at. The expression\r\nhas been often used, and always with a fraudulent design; for when the\r\nidea of a natural enemy is conceived, it prevents all other inquiries,\r\nand the real cause of the quarrel is hidden in the universality of the\r\nconceit. Men start at the notion of a natural enemy, and ask no other\r\nquestion. The cry obtains credit like the alarm of a mad dog, and is\r\none of those kind of tricks, which, by operating on the common passions,\r\nsecures their interest through their folly.\r\n\r\nBut we, sir, are not to be thus imposed upon. We live in a large world,\r\nand have extended our ideas beyond the limits and prejudices of an\r\nisland. We hold out the right hand of friendship to all the universe,\r\nand we conceive that there is a sociality in the manners of France,\r\nwhich is much better disposed to peace and negotiation than that of\r\nEngland, and until the latter becomes more civilized, she cannot expect\r\nto live long at peace with any power. Her common language is vulgar\r\nand offensive, and children suck in with their milk the rudiments of\r\ninsult--\"The arm of Britain! The mighty arm of Britain! Britain that\r\nshakes the earth to its center and its poles! The scourge of France! The\r\nterror of the world! That governs with a nod, and pours down vengeance\r\nlike a God.\" This language neither makes a nation great or little; but\r\nit shows a savageness of manners, and has a tendency to keep national\r\nanimosity alive. The entertainments of the stage are calculated to the\r\nsame end, and almost every public exhibition is tinctured with insult.\r\nYet England is always in dread of France,--terrified at the apprehension\r\nof an invasion, suspicious of being outwitted in a treaty, and privately\r\ncringing though she is publicly offending. Let her, therefore, reform\r\nher manners and do justice, and she will find the idea of a natural\r\nenemy to be only a phantom of her own imagination.\r\n\r\nLittle did I think, at this period of the war, to see a proclamation\r\nwhich could promise you no one useful purpose whatever, and tend only\r\nto expose you. One would think that you were just awakened from a four\r\nyears' dream, and knew nothing of what had passed in the interval.\r\nIs this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgotten\r\nsubjects of charters and taxation? Is it worth your while, after every\r\nforce has failed you, to retreat under the shelter of argument and\r\npersuasion? Or can you think that we, with nearly half your army\r\nprisoners, and in alliance with France, are to be begged or threatened\r\ninto submission by a piece of paper? But as commissioners at a hundred\r\npounds sterling a week each, you conceive yourselves bound to do\r\nsomething, and the genius of ill-fortune told you, that you must write.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I have not put pen to paper these several months.\r\nConvinced of our superiority by the issue of every campaign, I was\r\ninclined to hope, that that which all the rest of the world now see,\r\nwould become visible to you, and therefore felt unwilling to ruffle your\r\ntemper by fretting you with repetitions and discoveries. There have been\r\nintervals of hesitation in your conduct, from which it seemed a pity to\r\ndisturb you, and a charity to leave you to yourselves. You have often\r\nstopped, as if you intended to think, but your thoughts have ever been\r\ntoo early or too late.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Britain disdained to answer, or even hear\r\na petition from America. That time is past and she in her turn is\r\npetitioning our acceptance. We now stand on higher ground, and offer\r\nher peace; and the time will come when she, perhaps in vain, will ask\r\nit from us. The latter case is as probable as the former ever was. She\r\ncannot refuse to acknowledge our independence with greater obstinacy\r\nthan she before refused to repeal her laws; and if America alone could\r\nbring her to the one, united with France she will reduce her to the\r\nother. There is something in obstinacy which differs from every other\r\npassion; whenever it fails it never recovers, but either breaks like\r\niron, or crumbles sulkily away like a fractured arch. Most other\r\npassions have their periods of fatigue and rest; their suffering and\r\ntheir cure; but obstinacy has no resource, and the first wound is\r\nmortal. You have already begun to give it up, and you will, from the\r\nnatural construction of the vice, find yourselves both obliged and\r\ninclined to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you look back you see nothing but loss and disgrace. If you look\r\nforward the same scene continues, and the close is an impenetrable\r\ngloom. You may plan and execute little mischiefs, but are they worth the\r\nexpense they cost you, or will such partial evils have any effect on the\r\ngeneral cause? Your expedition to Egg Harbor, will be felt at a distance\r\nlike an attack upon a hen-roost, and expose you in Europe, with a sort\r\nof childish frenzy. Is it worth while to keep an army to protect you\r\nin writing proclamations, or to get once a year into winter quarters?\r\nPossessing yourselves of towns is not conquest, but convenience, and\r\nin which you will one day or other be trepanned. Your retreat from\r\nPhiladelphia, was only a timely escape, and your next expedition may be\r\nless fortunate.\r\n\r\nIt would puzzle all the politicians in the universe to conceive what you\r\nstay for, or why you should have stayed so long. You are prosecuting\r\na war in which you confess you have neither object nor hope, and that\r\nconquest, could it be effected, would not repay the charges: in the mean\r\nwhile the rest of your affairs are running to ruin, and a European war\r\nkindling against you. In such a situation, there is neither doubt nor\r\ndifficulty; the first rudiments of reason will determine the choice, for\r\nif peace can be procured with more advantages than even a conquest can\r\nbe obtained, he must be an idiot indeed that hesitates.\r\n\r\nBut you are probably buoyed up by a set of wretched mortals, who, having\r\ndeceived themselves, are cringing, with the duplicity of a spaniel, for\r\na little temporary bread. Those men will tell you just what you\r\nplease. It is their interest to amuse, in order to lengthen out their\r\nprotection. They study to keep you amongst them for that very purpose;\r\nand in proportion as you disregard their advice, and grow callous to\r\ntheir complaints, they will stretch into improbability, and season their\r\nflattery the higher. Characters like these are to be found in every\r\ncountry, and every country will despise them.\r\n\r\n                                            COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 20, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS VII. TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are stages in the business of serious life in which to amuse is\r\ncruel, but to deceive is to destroy; and it is of little consequence, in\r\nthe conclusion, whether men deceive themselves, or submit, by a kind of\r\nmutual consent, to the impositions of each other. That England has long\r\nbeen under the influence of delusion or mistake, needs no other proof\r\nthan the unexpected and wretched situation that she is now involved in:\r\nand so powerful has been the influence, that no provision was ever made\r\nor thought of against the misfortune, because the possibility of its\r\nhappening was never conceived.\r\n\r\nThe general and successful resistance of America, the conquest of\r\nBurgoyne, and a war in France, were treated in parliament as the dreams\r\nof a discontented opposition, or a distempered imagination. They were\r\nbeheld as objects unworthy of a serious thought, and the bare intimation\r\nof them afforded the ministry a triumph of laughter. Short triumph\r\nindeed! For everything which has been predicted has happened, and all\r\nthat was promised has failed. A long series of politics so remarkably\r\ndistinguished by a succession of misfortunes, without one alleviating\r\nturn, must certainly have something in it systematically wrong. It is\r\nsufficient to awaken the most credulous into suspicion, and the most\r\nobstinate into thought. Either the means in your power are insufficient,\r\nor the measures ill planned; either the execution has been bad, or the\r\nthing attempted impracticable; or, to speak more emphatically, either\r\nyou are not able or heaven is not willing. For, why is it that you have\r\nnot conquered us? Who, or what has prevented you? You have had every\r\nopportunity that you could desire, and succeeded to your utmost wish in\r\nevery preparatory means. Your fleets and armies have arrived in America\r\nwithout an accident. No uncommon fortune has intervened. No foreign\r\nnation has interfered until the time which you had allotted for victory\r\nwas passed. The opposition, either in or out of parliament, neither\r\ndisconcerted your measures, retarded or diminished your force. They only\r\nforetold your fate. Every ministerial scheme was carried with as high a\r\nhand as if the whole nation had been unanimous. Every thing wanted was\r\nasked for, and every thing asked for was granted.\r\n\r\nA greater force was not within the compass of your abilities to send,\r\nand the time you sent it was of all others the most favorable. You were\r\nthen at rest with the whole world beside. You had the range of every\r\ncourt in Europe uncontradicted by us. You amused us with a tale of\r\ncommissioners of peace, and under that disguise collected a numerous\r\narmy and came almost unexpectedly upon us. The force was much greater\r\nthan we looked for; and that which we had to oppose it with, was unequal\r\nin numbers, badly armed, and poorly disciplined; beside which, it was\r\nembodied only for a short time, and expired within a few months after\r\nyour arrival. We had governments to form; measures to concert; an\r\narmy to train, and every necessary article to import or to create. Our\r\nnon-importation scheme had exhausted our stores, and your command by sea\r\nintercepted our supplies. We were a people unknown, and unconnected with\r\nthe political world, and strangers to the disposition of foreign\r\npowers. Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of\r\ncircumstances? Yet all these have happened and passed away, and, as\r\nit were, left you with a laugh. There are likewise, events of such an\r\noriginal nativity as can never happen again, unless a new world should\r\narise from the ocean.\r\n\r\nIf any thing can be a lesson to presumption, surely the circumstances\r\nof this war will have their effect. Had Britain been defeated by\r\nany European power, her pride would have drawn consolation from the\r\nimportance of her conquerors; but in the present case, she is excelled\r\nby those that she affected to despise, and her own opinions retorting\r\nupon herself, become an aggravation of her disgrace. Misfortune and\r\nexperience are lost upon mankind, when they produce neither reflection\r\nnor reformation. Evils, like poisons, have their uses, and there are\r\ndiseases which no other remedy can reach. It has been the crime and\r\nfolly of England to suppose herself invincible, and that, without\r\nacknowledging or perceiving that a full third of her strength was drawn\r\nfrom the country she is now at war with. The arm of Britain has been\r\nspoken of as the arm of the Almighty, and she has lived of late as if\r\nshe thought the whole world created for her diversion. Her politics,\r\ninstead of civilizing, has tended to brutalize mankind, and under the\r\nvain, unmeaning title of \"Defender of the Faith,\" she has made war like\r\nan Indian against the religion of humanity. Her cruelties in the East\r\nIndies will never be forgotten, and it is somewhat remarkable that the\r\nproduce of that ruined country, transported to America, should there\r\nkindle up a war to punish the destroyer. The chain is continued,\r\nthough with a mysterious kind of uniformity both in the crime and the\r\npunishment. The latter runs parallel with the former, and time and fate\r\nwill give it a perfect illustration.\r\n\r\nWhen information is withheld, ignorance becomes a reasonable excuse; and\r\none would charitably hope that the people of England do not encourage\r\ncruelty from choice but from mistake. Their recluse situation,\r\nsurrounded by the sea, preserves them from the calamities of war, and\r\nkeeps them in the dark as to the conduct of their own armies. They see\r\nnot, therefore they feel not. They tell the tale that is told them and\r\nbelieve it, and accustomed to no other news than their own, they receive\r\nit, stripped of its horrors and prepared for the palate of the nation,\r\nthrough the channel of the London Gazette. They are made to believe that\r\ntheir generals and armies differ from those of other nations, and have\r\nnothing of rudeness or barbarity in them. They suppose them what\r\nthey wish them to be. They feel a disgrace in thinking otherwise, and\r\nnaturally encourage the belief from a partiality to themselves. There\r\nwas a time when I felt the same prejudices, and reasoned from the\r\nsame errors; but experience, sad and painful experience, has taught me\r\nbetter. What the conduct of former armies was, I know not, but what the\r\nconduct of the present is, I well know. It is low, cruel, indolent and\r\nprofligate; and had the people of America no other cause for separation\r\nthan what the army has occasioned, that alone is cause sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe field of politics in England is far more extensive than that of\r\nnews. Men have a right to reason for themselves, and though they cannot\r\ncontradict the intelligence in the London Gazette, they may frame upon\r\nit what sentiments they please. But the misfortune is, that a general\r\nignorance has prevailed over the whole nation respecting America. The\r\nministry and the minority have both been wrong. The former was always\r\nso, the latter only lately so. Politics, to be executively right, must\r\nhave a unity of means and time, and a defect in either overthrows the\r\nwhole. The ministry rejected the plans of the minority while they were\r\npracticable, and joined in them when they became impracticable. From\r\nwrong measures they got into wrong time, and have now completed the\r\ncircle of absurdity by closing it upon themselves.\r\n\r\nI happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of\r\nhostilities. I found the disposition of the people such, that they might\r\nhave been led by a thread and governed by a reed. Their suspicion was\r\nquick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,\r\nand it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it. They\r\ndisliked the ministry, but they esteemed the nation. Their idea of\r\ngrievance operated without resentment, and their single object was\r\nreconciliation. Bad as I believed the ministry to be, I never conceived\r\nthem capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of\r\nhostilities; much less did I imagine the nation would encourage it.\r\nI viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the\r\nparties would find a way either to decide or settle it. I had no\r\nthoughts of independence or of arms. The world could not then have\r\npersuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author. If I had\r\nany talents for either, they were buried in me, and might ever have\r\ncontinued so, had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them\r\ninto action. I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy,\r\nwished every body else so. But when the country, into which I had just\r\nset my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir. It\r\nwas time for every man to stir. Those who had been long settled had\r\nsomething to defend; those who had just come had something to pursue;\r\nand the call and the concern was equal and universal. For in a country\r\nwhere all men were once adventurers, the difference of a few years in\r\ntheir arrival could make none in their right.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of hostilities opened a new suspicion in the politics\r\nof America, which, though at that time very rare, has since been proved\r\nto be very right. What I allude to is, \"a secret and fixed determination\r\nin the British Cabinet to annex America to the crown of England as a\r\nconquered country.\" If this be taken as the object, then the whole\r\nline of conduct pursued by the ministry, though rash in its origin and\r\nruinous in its consequences, is nevertheless uniform and consistent in\r\nits parts. It applies to every case and resolves every difficulty.\r\nBut if taxation, or any thing else, be taken in its room, there is no\r\nproportion between the object and the charge. Nothing but the whole\r\nsoil and property of the country can be placed as a possible equivalent\r\nagainst the millions which the ministry expended. No taxes raised in\r\nAmerica could possibly repay it. A revenue of two millions sterling a\r\nyear would not discharge the sum and interest accumulated thereon, in\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nReconciliation never appears to have been the wish or the object of the\r\nadministration; they looked on conquest as certain and infallible, and,\r\nunder that persuasion, sought to drive the Americans into what they\r\nmight style a general rebellion, and then, crushing them with arms\r\nin their hands, reap the rich harvest of a general confiscation, and\r\nsilence them for ever. The dependents at court were too numerous to be\r\nprovided for in England. The market for plunder in the East Indies was\r\nover; and the profligacy of government required that a new mine should\r\nbe opened, and that mine could be no other than America, conquered\r\nand forfeited. They had no where else to go. Every other channel was\r\ndrained; and extravagance, with the thirst of a drunkard, was gaping for\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nIf the ministry deny this to have been their plan, it becomes them to\r\nexplain what was their plan. For either they have abused us in coveting\r\nproperty they never labored for, or they have abused you in expending an\r\namazing sum upon an incompetent object. Taxation, as I mentioned before,\r\ncould never be worth the charge of obtaining it by arms; and any kind of\r\nformal obedience which America could have made, would have weighed with\r\nthe lightness of a laugh against such a load of expense. It is therefore\r\nmost probable that the ministry will at last justify their policy by\r\ntheir dishonesty, and openly declare, that their original design was\r\nconquest: and, in this case, it well becomes the people of England to\r\nconsider how far the nation would have been benefited by the success.\r\n\r\nIn a general view, there are few conquests that repay the charge of\r\nmaking them, and mankind are pretty well convinced that it can never be\r\nworth their while to go to war for profit's sake. If they are made war\r\nupon, their country invaded, or their existence at stake, it is their\r\nduty to defend and preserve themselves, but in every other light, and\r\nfrom every other cause, is war inglorious and detestable. But to return\r\nto the case in question--\r\n\r\nWhen conquests are made of foreign countries, it is supposed that the\r\ncommerce and dominion of the country which made them are extended. But\r\nthis could neither be the object nor the consequence of the present\r\nwar. You enjoyed the whole commerce before. It could receive no possible\r\naddition by a conquest, but on the contrary, must diminish as the\r\ninhabitants were reduced in numbers and wealth. You had the same\r\ndominion over the country which you used to have, and had no complaint\r\nto make against her for breach of any part of the contract between\r\nyou or her, or contending against any established custom, commercial,\r\npolitical or territorial. The country and commerce were both your own\r\nwhen you began to conquer, in the same manner and form as they had been\r\nyour own a hundred years before. Nations have sometimes been induced to\r\nmake conquests for the sake of reducing the power of their enemies, or\r\nbringing it to a balance with their own. But this could be no part of\r\nyour plan. No foreign authority was claimed here, neither was any such\r\nauthority suspected by you, or acknowledged or imagined by us. What\r\nthen, in the name of heaven, could you go to war for? Or what chance\r\ncould you possibly have in the event, but either to hold the same\r\ncountry which you held before, and that in a much worse condition, or\r\nto lose, with an amazing expense, what you might have retained without a\r\nfarthing of charges?\r\n\r\nWar never can be the interest of a trading nation, any more than\r\nquarrelling can be profitable to a man in business. But to make war with\r\nthose who trade with us, is like setting a bull-dog upon a customer at\r\nthe shop-door. The least degree of common sense shows the madness of\r\nthe latter, and it will apply with the same force of conviction to the\r\nformer. Piratical nations, having neither commerce or commodities of\r\ntheir own to lose, may make war upon all the world, and lucratively\r\nfind their account in it; but it is quite otherwise with Britain: for,\r\nbesides the stoppage of trade in time of war, she exposes more of her\r\nown property to be lost, than she has the chance of taking from others.\r\nSome ministerial gentlemen in parliament have mentioned the greatness of\r\nher trade as an apology for the greatness of her loss. This is miserable\r\npolitics indeed! Because it ought to have been given as a reason for her\r\nnot engaging in a war at first. The coast of America commands the West\r\nIndia trade almost as effectually as the coast of Africa does that of\r\nthe Straits; and England can no more carry on the former without the\r\nconsent of America, than she can the latter without a Mediterranean\r\npass.\r\n\r\nIn whatever light the war with America is considered upon commercial\r\nprinciples, it is evidently the interest of the people of England not to\r\nsupport it; and why it has been supported so long, against the clearest\r\ndemonstrations of truth and national advantage, is, to me, and must be\r\nto all the reasonable world, a matter of astonishment. Perhaps it may\r\nbe said that I live in America, and write this from interest. To this\r\nI reply, that my principle is universal. My attachment is to all the\r\nworld, and not to any particular part, and if what I advance is right,\r\nno matter where or who it comes from. We have given the proclamation of\r\nyour commissioners a currency in our newspapers, and I have no doubt you\r\nwill give this a place in yours. To oblige and be obliged is fair.\r\n\r\nBefore I dismiss this part of my address, I shall mention one more\r\ncircumstance in which I think the people of England have been equally\r\nmistaken: and then proceed to other matters.\r\n\r\nThere is such an idea existing in the world, as that of national honor,\r\nand this, falsely understood, is oftentimes the cause of war. In a\r\nChristian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood still\r\nat individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the original\r\nrudeness of nature. Peace by treaty is only a cessation of violence for\r\na reformation of sentiment. It is a substitute for a principle that\r\nis wanting and ever will be wanting till the idea of national honor be\r\nrightly understood. As individuals we profess ourselves Christians, but\r\nas nations we are heathens, Romans, and what not. I remember the late\r\nAdmiral Saunders declaring in the House of Commons, and that in the time\r\nof peace, \"That the city of Madrid laid in ashes was not a sufficient\r\natonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder of an English sloop\r\nof war.\" I do not ask whether this is Christianity or morality, I ask\r\nwhether it is decency? whether it is proper language for a nation to\r\nuse? In private life we call it by the plain name of bullying, and\r\nthe elevation of rank cannot alter its character. It is, I think,\r\nexceedingly easy to define what ought to be understood by national\r\nhonor; for that which is the best character for an individual is the\r\nbest character for a nation; and wherever the latter exceeds or\r\nfalls beneath the former, there is a departure from the line of true\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nI have thrown out this observation with a design of applying it to Great\r\nBritain. Her ideas of national honor seem devoid of that benevolence of\r\nheart, that universal expansion of philanthropy, and that triumph over\r\nthe rage of vulgar prejudice, without which man is inferior to himself,\r\nand a companion of common animals. To know who she shall regard or\r\ndislike, she asks what country they are of, what religion they profess,\r\nand what property they enjoy. Her idea of national honor seems to\r\nconsist in national insult, and that to be a great people, is to be\r\nneither a Christian, a philosopher, or a gentleman, but to threaten with\r\nthe rudeness of a bear, and to devour with the ferocity of a lion. This\r\nperhaps may sound harsh and uncourtly, but it is too true, and the more\r\nis the pity.\r\n\r\nI mention this only as her general character. But towards America she\r\nhas observed no character at all; and destroyed by her conduct what she\r\nassumed in her title. She set out with the title of parent, or mother\r\ncountry. The association of ideas which naturally accompany this\r\nexpression, are filled with everything that is fond, tender and\r\nforbearing. They have an energy peculiar to themselves, and, overlooking\r\nthe accidental attachment of common affections, apply with infinite\r\nsoftness to the first feelings of the heart. It is a political term\r\nwhich every mother can feel the force of, and every child can judge of.\r\nIt needs no painting of mine to set it off, for nature only can do it\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nBut has any part of your conduct to America corresponded with the title\r\nyou set up? If in your general national character you are unpolished and\r\nsevere, in this you are inconsistent and unnatural, and you must have\r\nexceeding false notions of national honor to suppose that the world can\r\nadmire a want of humanity or that national honor depends on the\r\nviolence of resentment, the inflexibility of temper, or the vengeance of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nI would willingly convince you, and that with as much temper as the\r\ntimes will suffer me to do, that as you opposed your own interest by\r\nquarrelling with us, so likewise your national honor, rightly conceived\r\nand understood, was no ways called upon to enter into a war with\r\nAmerica; had you studied true greatness of heart, the first and fairest\r\nornament of mankind, you would have acted directly contrary to all that\r\nyou have done, and the world would have ascribed it to a generous cause.\r\nBesides which, you had (though with the assistance of this country)\r\nsecured a powerful name by the last war. You were known and dreaded\r\nabroad; and it would have been wise in you to have suffered the world to\r\nhave slept undisturbed under that idea. It was to you a force existing\r\nwithout expense. It produced to you all the advantages of real power;\r\nand you were stronger through the universality of that charm, than any\r\nfuture fleets and armies may probably make you. Your greatness was so\r\nsecured and interwoven with your silence that you ought never to have\r\nawakened mankind, and had nothing to do but to be quiet. Had you been\r\ntrue politicians you would have seen all this, and continued to draw\r\nfrom the magic of a name, the force and authority of a nation.\r\n\r\nUnwise as you were in breaking the charm, you were still more unwise\r\nin the manner of doing it. Samson only told the secret, but you have\r\nperformed the operation; you have shaven your own head, and wantonly\r\nthrown away the locks. America was the hair from which the charm was\r\ndrawn that infatuated the world. You ought to have quarrelled with no\r\npower; but with her upon no account. You had nothing to fear from any\r\ncondescension you might make. You might have humored her, even if there\r\nhad been no justice in her claims, without any risk to your reputation;\r\nfor Europe, fascinated by your fame, would have ascribed it to your\r\nbenevolence, and America, intoxicated by the grant, would have slumbered\r\nin her fetters.\r\n\r\nBut this method of studying the progress of the passions, in order to\r\nascertain the probable conduct of mankind, is a philosophy in politics\r\nwhich those who preside at St. James's have no conception of. They know\r\nno other influence than corruption and reckon all their probabilities\r\nfrom precedent. A new case is to them a new world, and while they are\r\nseeking for a parallel they get lost. The talents of Lord Mansfield can\r\nbe estimated at best no higher than those of a sophist. He understands\r\nthe subtleties but not the elegance of nature; and by continually\r\nviewing mankind through the cold medium of the law, never thinks of\r\npenetrating into the warmer region of the mind. As for Lord North, it\r\nis his happiness to have in him more philosophy than sentiment, for he\r\nbears flogging like a top, and sleeps the better for it. His punishment\r\nbecomes his support, for while he suffers the lash for his sins,\r\nhe keeps himself up by twirling about. In politics, he is a good\r\narithmetician, and in every thing else nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance which comes so much within Lord North's\r\nprovince as a financier, that I am surprised it should escape him,\r\nwhich is, the different abilities of the two countries in supporting the\r\nexpense; for, strange as it may seem, England is not a match for America\r\nin this particular. By a curious kind of revolution in accounts, the\r\npeople of England seem to mistake their poverty for their riches; that\r\nis, they reckon their national debt as a part of their national wealth.\r\nThey make the same kind of error which a man would do, who after\r\nmortgaging his estate, should add the money borrowed, to the full value\r\nof the estate, in order to count up his worth, and in this case he would\r\nconceive that he got rich by running into debt. Just thus it is with\r\nEngland. The government owed at the beginning of this war one hundred\r\nand thirty-five millions sterling, and though the individuals to whom it\r\nwas due had a right to reckon their shares as so much private property,\r\nyet to the nation collectively it was so much poverty. There are as\r\neffectual limits to public debts as to private ones, for when once the\r\nmoney borrowed is so great as to require the whole yearly revenue to\r\ndischarge the interest thereon, there is an end to further borrowing;\r\nin the same manner as when the interest of a man's debts amounts to\r\nthe yearly income of his estate, there is an end to his credit. This is\r\nnearly the case with England, the interest of her present debt being\r\nat least equal to one half of her yearly revenue, so that out of ten\r\nmillions annually collected by taxes, she has but five that she can call\r\nher own.\r\n\r\nThe very reverse of this was the case with America; she began the war\r\nwithout any debt upon her, and in order to carry it on, she neither\r\nraised money by taxes, nor borrowed it upon interest, but created it;\r\nand her situation at this time continues so much the reverse of yours\r\nthat taxing would make her rich, whereas it would make you poor. When we\r\nshall have sunk the sum which we have created, we shall then be out of\r\ndebt, be just as rich as when we began, and all the while we are doing\r\nit shall feel no difference, because the value will rise as the quantity\r\ndecreases.\r\n\r\nThere was not a country in the world so capable of bearing the expense\r\nof a war as America; not only because she was not in debt when she\r\nbegan, but because the country is young and capable of infinite\r\nimprovement, and has an almost boundless tract of new lands in store;\r\nwhereas England has got to her extent of age and growth, and has not\r\nunoccupied land or property in reserve. The one is like a young heir\r\ncoming to a large improvable estate; the other like an old man whose\r\nchances are over, and his estate mortgaged for half its worth.\r\n\r\nIn the second number of the Crisis, which I find has been republished\r\nin England, I endeavored to set forth the impracticability of conquering\r\nAmerica. I stated every case, that I conceived could possibly happen,\r\nand ventured to predict its consequences. As my conclusions were drawn\r\nnot artfully, but naturally, they have all proved to be true. I was upon\r\nthe spot; knew the politics of America, her strength and resources, and\r\nby a train of services, the best in my power to render, was honored with\r\nthe friendship of the congress, the army and the people. I considered\r\nthe cause a just one. I know and feel it a just one, and under that\r\nconfidence never made my own profit or loss an object. My endeavor was\r\nto have the matter well understood on both sides, and I conceived\r\nmyself tendering a general service, by setting forth to the one the\r\nimpossibility of being conquered, and to the other the impossibility\r\nof conquering. Most of the arguments made use of by the ministry for\r\nsupporting the war, are the very arguments that ought to have been used\r\nagainst supporting it; and the plans, by which they thought to conquer,\r\nare the very plans in which they were sure to be defeated. They have\r\ntaken every thing up at the wrong end. Their ignorance is astonishing,\r\nand were you in my situation you would see it. They may, perhaps,\r\nhave your confidence, but I am persuaded that they would make very\r\nindifferent members of Congress. I know what England is, and what\r\nAmerica is, and from the compound of knowledge, am better enabled to\r\njudge of the issue than what the king or any of his ministers can be.\r\n\r\nIn this number I have endeavored to show the ill policy and\r\ndisadvantages of the war. I believe many of my remarks are new. Those\r\nwhich are not so, I have studied to improve and place in a manner that\r\nmay be clear and striking. Your failure is, I am persuaded, as certain\r\nas fate. America is above your reach. She is at least your equal in the\r\nworld, and her independence neither rests upon your consent, nor can it\r\nbe prevented by your arms. In short, you spend your substance in vain,\r\nand impoverish yourselves without a hope.\r\n\r\nBut suppose you had conquered America, what advantages, collectively or\r\nindividually, as merchants, manufacturers, or conquerors, could you\r\nhave looked for? This is an object you seemed never to have attended to.\r\nListening for the sound of victory, and led away by the frenzy of arms,\r\nyou neglected to reckon either the cost or the consequences. You must\r\nall pay towards the expense; the poorest among you must bear his share,\r\nand it is both your right and your duty to weigh seriously the matter.\r\nHad America been conquered, she might have been parcelled out in grants\r\nto the favorites at court, but no share of it would have fallen to you.\r\nYour taxes would not have been lessened, because she would have been\r\nin no condition to have paid any towards your relief. We are rich by\r\ncontrivance of our own, which would have ceased as soon as you became\r\nmasters. Our paper money will be of no use in England, and silver and\r\ngold we have none. In the last war you made many conquests, but were any\r\nof your taxes lessened thereby? On the contrary, were you not taxed to\r\npay for the charge of making them, and has not the same been the case in\r\nevery war?\r\n\r\nTo the Parliament I wish to address myself in a more particular manner.\r\nThey appear to have supposed themselves partners in the chase, and to\r\nhave hunted with the lion from an expectation of a right in the booty;\r\nbut in this it is most probable they would, as legislators, have\r\nbeen disappointed. The case is quite a new one, and many unforeseen\r\ndifficulties would have arisen thereon. The Parliament claimed a\r\nlegislative right over America, and the war originated from that\r\npretence. But the army is supposed to belong to the crown, and if\r\nAmerica had been conquered through their means, the claim of the\r\nlegislature would have been suffocated in the conquest. Ceded, or\r\nconquered, countries are supposed to be out of the authority of\r\nParliament. Taxation is exercised over them by prerogative and not by\r\nlaw. It was attempted to be done in the Grenadas a few years ago, and\r\nthe only reason why it was not done was because the crown had made a\r\nprior relinquishment of its claim. Therefore, Parliament have been all\r\nthis while supporting measures for the establishment of their authority,\r\nin the issue of which, they would have been triumphed over by the\r\nprerogative. This might have opened a new and interesting opposition\r\nbetween the Parliament and the crown. The crown would have said that it\r\nconquered for itself, and that to conquer for Parliament was an unknown\r\ncase. The Parliament might have replied, that America not being a\r\nforeign country, but a country in rebellion, could not be said to be\r\nconquered, but reduced; and thus continued their claim by disowning\r\nthe term. The crown might have rejoined, that however America might\r\nbe considered at first, she became foreign at last by a declaration of\r\nindependence, and a treaty with France; and that her case being, by that\r\ntreaty, put within the law of nations, was out of the law of Parliament,\r\nwho might have maintained, that as their claim over America had never\r\nbeen surrendered, so neither could it be taken away. The crown might\r\nhave insisted, that though the claim of Parliament could not be taken\r\naway, yet, being an inferior, it might be superseded; and that, whether\r\nthe claim was withdrawn from the object, or the object taken from the\r\nclaim, the same separation ensued; and that America being subdued after\r\na treaty with France, was to all intents and purposes a regal conquest,\r\nand of course the sole property of the king. The Parliament, as the\r\nlegal delegates of the people, might have contended against the term\r\n\"inferior,\" and rested the case upon the antiquity of power, and this\r\nwould have brought on a set of very interesting and rational questions.\r\n\r\n  1st, What is the original fountain of power and honor in any country?\r\n  2d, Whether the prerogative does not belong to the people?\r\n  3d, Whether there is any such thing as the English constitution?\r\n  4th, Of what use is the crown to the people?\r\n  5th, Whether he who invented a crown was not an enemy to mankind?\r\n  6th, Whether it is not a shame for a man to spend a million a year\r\n  and do no good for it, and whether the money might not be better\r\n  applied? 7th, Whether such a man is not better dead than alive?\r\n  8th, Whether a Congress, constituted like that of America, is not the\r\n  most happy and consistent form of government in the world?--With a\r\n  number of others of the same import.\r\n\r\nIn short, the contention about the dividend might have distracted the\r\nnation; for nothing is more common than to agree in the conquest and\r\nquarrel for the prize; therefore it is, perhaps, a happy circumstance,\r\nthat our successes have prevented the dispute.\r\n\r\nIf the Parliament had been thrown out in their claim, which it is most\r\nprobable they would, the nation likewise would have been thrown out in\r\ntheir expectation; for as the taxes would have been laid on by the crown\r\nwithout the Parliament, the revenue arising therefrom, if any could\r\nhave arisen, would not have gone into the exchequer, but into the privy\r\npurse, and so far from lessening the taxes, would not even have been\r\nadded to them, but served only as pocket money to the crown. The more I\r\nreflect on this matter, the more I am satisfied at the blindness and\r\nill policy of my countrymen, whose wisdom seems to operate without\r\ndiscernment, and their strength without an object.\r\n\r\nTo the great bulwark of the nation, I mean the mercantile and\r\nmanufacturing part thereof, I likewise present my address. It is your\r\ninterest to see America an independent, and not a conquered country. If\r\nconquered, she is ruined; and if ruined, poor; consequently the\r\ntrade will be a trifle, and her credit doubtful. If independent, she\r\nflourishes, and from her flourishing must your profits arise. It\r\nmatters nothing to you who governs America, if your manufactures find\r\na consumption there. Some articles will consequently be obtained from\r\nother places, and it is right that they should; but the demand for\r\nothers will increase, by the great influx of inhabitants which a state\r\nof independence and peace will occasion, and in the final event you may\r\nbe enriched. The commerce of America is perfectly free, and ever will\r\nbe so. She will consign away no part of it to any nation. She has not\r\nto her friends, and certainly will not to her enemies; though it is\r\nprobable that your narrow-minded politicians, thinking to please you\r\nthereby, may some time or other unnecessarily make such a proposal.\r\nTrade flourishes best when it is free, and it is weak policy to attempt\r\nto fetter it. Her treaty with France is on the most liberal and generous\r\nprinciples, and the French, in their conduct towards her, have proved\r\nthemselves to be philosophers, politicians, and gentlemen.\r\n\r\nTo the ministry I likewise address myself. You, gentlemen, have studied\r\nthe ruin of your country, from which it is not within your abilities to\r\nrescue her. Your attempts to recover her are as ridiculous as your plans\r\nwhich involved her are detestable. The commissioners, being about to\r\ndepart, will probably bring you this, and with it my sixth number,\r\naddressed to them; and in so doing they carry back more Common Sense\r\nthan they brought, and you likewise will have more than when you sent\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHaving thus addressed you severally, I conclude by addressing you\r\ncollectively. It is a long lane that has no turning. A period of sixteen\r\nyears of misconduct and misfortune, is certainly long enough for any one\r\nnation to suffer under; and upon a supposition that war is not declared\r\nbetween France and you, I beg to place a line of conduct before you\r\nthat will easily lead you out of all your troubles. It has been hinted\r\nbefore, and cannot be too much attended to.\r\n\r\nSuppose America had remained unknown to Europe till the present year,\r\nand that Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in another voyage round the world,\r\nhad made the first discovery of her, in the same condition that she is\r\nnow in, of arts, arms, numbers, and civilization. What, I ask, in that\r\ncase, would have been your conduct towards her? For that will point out\r\nwhat it ought to be now. The problems and their solutions are equal,\r\nand the right line of the one is the parallel of the other. The question\r\ntakes in every circumstance that can possibly arise. It reduces politics\r\nto a simple thought, and is moreover a mode of investigation, in which,\r\nwhile you are studying your interest the simplicity of the case will\r\ncheat you into good temper. You have nothing to do but to suppose that\r\nyou have found America, and she appears found to your hand, and while\r\nin the joy of your heart you stand still to admire her, the path of\r\npolitics rises straight before you.\r\n\r\nWere I disposed to paint a contrast, I could easily set off what you\r\nhave done in the present case, against what you would have done in that\r\ncase, and by justly opposing them, conclude a picture that would make\r\nyou blush. But, as, when any of the prouder passions are hurt, it is\r\nmuch better philosophy to let a man slip into a good temper than to\r\nattack him in a bad one, for that reason, therefore, I only state the\r\ncase, and leave you to reflect upon it.\r\n\r\nTo go a little back into politics, it will be found that the true\r\ninterest of Britain lay in proposing and promoting the independence of\r\nAmerica immediately after the last peace; for the expense which Britain\r\nhad then incurred by defending America as her own dominions, ought to\r\nhave shown her the policy and necessity of changing the style of the\r\ncountry, as the best probable method of preventing future wars and\r\nexpense, and the only method by which she could hold the commerce\r\nwithout the charge of sovereignty. Besides which, the title which she\r\nassumed, of parent country, led to, and pointed out the propriety,\r\nwisdom and advantage of a separation; for, as in private life, children\r\ngrow into men, and by setting up for themselves, extend and secure the\r\ninterest of the whole family, so in the settlement of colonies large\r\nenough to admit of maturity, the same policy should be pursued, and the\r\nsame consequences would follow. Nothing hurts the affections both of\r\nparents and children so much, as living too closely connected, and\r\nkeeping up the distinction too long. Domineering will not do over those,\r\nwho, by a progress in life, have become equal in rank to their parents,\r\nthat is, when they have families of their own; and though they may\r\nconceive themselves the subjects of their advice, will not suppose them\r\nthe objects of their government. I do not, by drawing this parallel,\r\nmean to admit the title of parent country, because, if it is due any\r\nwhere, it is due to Europe collectively, and the first settlers from\r\nEngland were driven here by persecution. I mean only to introduce the\r\nterm for the sake of policy and to show from your title the line of your\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWhen you saw the state of strength and opulence, and that by her own\r\nindustry, which America arrived at, you ought to have advised her to set\r\nup for herself, and proposed an alliance of interest with her, and in\r\nso doing you would have drawn, and that at her own expense, more real\r\nadvantage, and more military supplies and assistance, both of ships and\r\nmen, than from any weak and wrangling government that you could exercise\r\nover her. In short, had you studied only the domestic politics of a\r\nfamily, you would have learned how to govern the state; but, instead of\r\nthis easy and natural line, you flew out into every thing which was\r\nwild and outrageous, till, by following the passion and stupidity of the\r\npilot, you wrecked the vessel within sight of the shore.\r\n\r\nHaving shown what you ought to have done, I now proceed to show why it\r\nwas not done. The caterpillar circle of the court had an interest\r\nto pursue, distinct from, and opposed to yours; for though by the\r\nindependence of America and an alliance therewith, the trade would have\r\ncontinued, if not increased, as in many articles neither country can go\r\nto a better market, and though by defending and protecting herself,\r\nshe would have been no expense to you, and consequently your\r\nnational charges would have decreased, and your taxes might have been\r\nproportionably lessened thereby; yet the striking off so many places\r\nfrom the court calendar was put in opposition to the interest of the\r\nnation. The loss of thirteen government ships, with their appendages,\r\nhere and in England, is a shocking sound in the ear of a hungry\r\ncourtier. Your present king and ministry will be the ruin of you; and\r\nyou had better risk a revolution and call a Congress, than be thus led\r\non from madness to despair, and from despair to ruin. America has set\r\nyou the example, and you may follow it and be free.\r\n\r\nI now come to the last part, a war with France. This is what no man in\r\nhis senses will advise you to, and all good men would wish to prevent.\r\nWhether France will declare war against you, is not for me in this place\r\nto mention, or to hint, even if I knew it; but it must be madness in you\r\nto do it first. The matter is come now to a full crisis, and peace is\r\neasy if willingly set about. Whatever you may think, France has behaved\r\nhandsomely to you. She would have been unjust to herself to have acted\r\notherwise than she did; and having accepted our offer of alliance she\r\ngave you genteel notice of it. There was nothing in her conduct reserved\r\nor indelicate, and while she announced her determination to support her\r\ntreaty, she left you to give the first offence. America, on her part,\r\nhas exhibited a character of firmness to the world. Unprepared and\r\nunarmed, without form or government, she, singly opposed a nation\r\nthat domineered over half the globe. The greatness of the deed demands\r\nrespect; and though you may feel resentment, you are compelled both to\r\nwonder and admire.\r\n\r\nHere I rest my arguments and finish my address. Such as it is, it is a\r\ngift, and you are welcome. It was always my design to dedicate a Crisis\r\nto you, when the time should come that would properly make it a Crisis;\r\nand when, likewise, I should catch myself in a temper to write it, and\r\nsuppose you in a condition to read it. That time has now arrived, and\r\nwith it the opportunity for conveyance. For the commissioners--poor\r\ncommissioners! having proclaimed, that \"yet forty days and Nineveh shall\r\nbe overthrown,\" have waited out the date, and, discontented with their\r\nGod, are returning to their gourd. And all the harm I wish them is, that\r\nit may not wither about their ears, and that they may not make their\r\nexit in the belly of a whale.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Nov. 21, 1778.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Though in the tranquillity of my mind I have concluded with a\r\nlaugh, yet I have something to mention to the commissioners, which, to\r\nthem, is serious and worthy their attention. Their authority is derived\r\nfrom an Act of Parliament, which likewise describes and limits their\r\nofficial powers. Their commission, therefore, is only a recital, and\r\npersonal investiture, of those powers, or a nomination and description\r\nof the persons who are to execute them. Had it contained any thing\r\ncontrary to, or gone beyond the line of, the written law from which\r\nit is derived, and by which it is bound, it would, by the English\r\nconstitution, have been treason in the crown, and the king been subject\r\nto an impeachment. He dared not, therefore, put in his commission what\r\nyou have put in your proclamation, that is, he dared not have authorised\r\nyou in that commission to burn and destroy any thing in America. You are\r\nboth in the act and in the commission styled commissioners for restoring\r\npeace, and the methods for doing it are there pointed out. Your last\r\nproclamation is signed by you as commissioners under that act. You\r\nmake Parliament the patron of its contents. Yet, in the body of it, you\r\ninsert matters contrary both to the spirit and letter of the act, and\r\nwhat likewise your king dared not have put in his commission to you. The\r\nstate of things in England, gentlemen, is too ticklish for you to run\r\nhazards. You are accountable to Parliament for the execution of that act\r\naccording to the letter of it. Your heads may pay for breaking it, for\r\nyou certainly have broke it by exceeding it. And as a friend, who would\r\nwish you to escape the paw of the lion, as well as the belly of the\r\nwhale, I civilly hint to you, to keep within compass.\r\n\r\nSir Harry Clinton, strictly speaking, is as accountable as the rest; for\r\nthough a general, he is likewise a commissioner, acting under a superior\r\nauthority. His first obedience is due to the act; and his plea of being\r\na general, will not and cannot clear him as a commissioner, for that\r\nwould suppose the crown, in its single capacity, to have a power of\r\ndispensing with an Act of Parliament. Your situation, gentlemen, is nice\r\nand critical, and the more so because England is unsettled. Take heed!\r\nRemember the times of Charles the First! For Laud and Stafford fell by\r\ntrusting to a hope like yours.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown you the danger of your proclamation, I now show you\r\nthe folly of it. The means contradict your design: you threaten to lay\r\nwaste, in order to render America a useless acquisition of alliance to\r\nFrance. I reply, that the more destruction you commit (if you could do\r\nit) the more valuable to France you make that alliance. You can destroy\r\nonly houses and goods; and by so doing you increase our demand upon her\r\nfor materials and merchandise; for the wants of one nation, provided it\r\nhas freedom and credit, naturally produce riches to the other; and,\r\nas you can neither ruin the land nor prevent the vegetation, you would\r\nincrease the exportation of our produce in payment, which would be to\r\nher a new fund of wealth. In short, had you cast about for a plan on\r\npurpose to enrich your enemies, you could not have hit upon a better.\r\n\r\n                                           C. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS VIII. ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TRUSTING (says the king of England in his speech of November last,)\r\nin the divine providence, and in the justice of my cause, I am firmly\r\nresolved to prosecute the war with vigor, and to make every exertion\r\nin order to compel our enemies to equitable terms of peace and\r\naccommodation.\" To this declaration the United States of America, and\r\nthe confederated powers of Europe will reply, if Britain will have war,\r\nshe shall have enough of it.\r\n\r\nFive years have nearly elapsed since the commencement of hostilities,\r\nand every campaign, by a gradual decay, has lessened your ability to\r\nconquer, without producing a serious thought on your condition or your\r\nfate. Like a prodigal lingering in an habitual consumption, you feel\r\nthe relics of life, and mistake them for recovery. New schemes, like\r\nnew medicines, have administered fresh hopes, and prolonged the disease\r\ninstead of curing it. A change of generals, like a change of physicians,\r\nserved only to keep the flattery alive, and furnish new pretences for\r\nnew extravagance.\r\n\r\n\"Can Britain fail?\"* has been proudly asked at the undertaking of every\r\nenterprise; and that \"whatever she wills is fate,\"*(2) has been given\r\nwith the solemnity of prophetic confidence; and though the question\r\nhas been constantly replied to by disappointment, and the prediction\r\nfalsified by misfortune, yet still the insult continued, and your\r\ncatalogue of national evils increased therewith. Eager to persuade\r\nthe world of her power, she considered destruction as the minister of\r\ngreatness, and conceived that the glory of a nation like that of an\r\n[American] Indian, lay in the number of its scalps and the miseries\r\nwhich it inflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Whitehead's New Year's ode for 1776.\r\n*(2) Ode at the installation of Lord North, for Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford.\r\n\r\nFire, sword and want, as far as the arms of Britain could extend them,\r\nhave been spread with wanton cruelty along the coast of America; and\r\nwhile you, remote from the scene of suffering, had nothing to lose\r\nand as little to dread, the information reached you like a tale of\r\nantiquity, in which the distance of time defaces the conception, and\r\nchanges the severest sorrows into conversable amusement.\r\n\r\nThis makes the second paper, addressed perhaps in vain, to the people\r\nof England. That advice should be taken wherever example has failed,\r\nor precept be regarded where warning is ridiculed, is like a picture\r\nof hope resting on despair: but when time shall stamp with universal\r\ncurrency the facts you have long encountered with a laugh, and the\r\nirresistible evidence of accumulated losses, like the handwriting on\r\nthe wall, shall add terror to distress, you will then, in a conflict of\r\nsuffering, learn to sympathize with others by feeling for yourselves.\r\n\r\nThe triumphant appearance of the combined fleets in the channel and at\r\nyour harbor's mouth, and the expedition of Captain Paul Jones, on the\r\nwestern and eastern coasts of England and Scotland, will, by placing\r\nyou in the condition of an endangered country, read to you a stronger\r\nlecture on the calamities of invasion, and bring to your minds a truer\r\npicture of promiscuous distress, than the most finished rhetoric can\r\ndescribe or the keenest imagination conceive.\r\n\r\nHitherto you have experienced the expenses, but nothing of the miseries\r\nof war. Your disappointments have been accompanied with no immediate\r\nsuffering, and your losses came to you only by intelligence. Like fire\r\nat a distance you heard not even the cry; you felt not the danger, you\r\nsaw not the confusion. To you every thing has been foreign but the taxes\r\nto support it. You knew not what it was to be alarmed at midnight with\r\nan armed enemy in the streets. You were strangers to the distressing\r\nscene of a family in flight, and to the thousand restless cares and\r\ntender sorrows that incessantly arose. To see women and children\r\nwandering in the severity of winter, with the broken remains of a well\r\nfurnished house, and seeking shelter in every crib and hut, were matters\r\nthat you had no conception of. You knew not what it was to stand by and\r\nsee your goods chopped for fuel, and your beds ripped to pieces to make\r\npackages for plunder. The misery of others, like a tempestuous night,\r\nadded to the pleasures of your own security. You even enjoyed the storm,\r\nby contemplating the difference of conditions, and that which carried\r\nsorrow into the breasts of thousands served but to heighten in you a\r\nspecies of tranquil pride. Yet these are but the fainter sufferings\r\nof war, when compared with carnage and slaughter, the miseries of a\r\nmilitary hospital, or a town in flames.\r\n\r\nThe people of America, by anticipating distress, had fortified their\r\nminds against every species you could inflict. They had resolved to\r\nabandon their homes, to resign them to destruction, and to seek new\r\nsettlements rather than submit. Thus familiarized to misfortune, before\r\nit arrived, they bore their portion with the less regret: the justness\r\nof their cause was a continual source of consolation, and the hope of\r\nfinal victory, which never left them, served to lighten the load and\r\nsweeten the cup allotted them to drink.\r\n\r\nBut when their troubles shall become yours, and invasion be transferred\r\nupon the invaders, you will have neither their extended wilderness\r\nto fly to, their cause to comfort you, nor their hope to rest upon.\r\nDistress with them was sharpened by no self-reflection. They had not\r\nbrought it on themselves. On the contrary, they had by every proceeding\r\nendeavored to avoid it, and had descended even below the mark of\r\ncongressional character, to prevent a war. The national honor or the\r\nadvantages of independence were matters which, at the commencement of\r\nthe dispute, they had never studied, and it was only at the last moment\r\nthat the measure was resolved on. Thus circumstanced, they naturally\r\nand conscientiously felt a dependence upon providence. They had a clear\r\npretension to it, and had they failed therein, infidelity had gained a\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nBut your condition is the reverse of theirs. Every thing you suffer you\r\nhave sought: nay, had you created mischiefs on purpose to inherit\r\nthem, you could not have secured your title by a firmer deed. The world\r\nawakens with no pity it your complaints. You felt none for others; you\r\ndeserve none for yourselves. Nature does not interest herself in cases\r\nlike yours, but, on the contrary, turns from them with dislike, and\r\nabandons them to punishment. You may now present memorials to what court\r\nyou please, but so far as America is the object, none will listen.\r\nThe policy of Europe, and the propensity there in every mind to curb\r\ninsulting ambition, and bring cruelty to judgment, are unitedly against\r\nyou; and where nature and interest reinforce with each other, the\r\ncompact is too intimate to be dissolved.\r\n\r\nMake but the case of others your own, and your own theirs, and you\r\nwill then have a clear idea of the whole. Had France acted towards her\r\ncolonies as you have done, you would have branded her with every epithet\r\nof abhorrence; and had you, like her, stepped in to succor a struggling\r\npeople, all Europe must have echoed with your own applauses. But\r\nentangled in the passion of dispute you see it not as you ought, and\r\nform opinions thereon which suit with no interest but your own. You\r\nwonder that America does not rise in union with you to impose on herself\r\na portion of your taxes and reduce herself to unconditional submission.\r\nYou are amazed that the southern powers of Europe do not assist you\r\nin conquering a country which is afterwards to be turned against\r\nthemselves; and that the northern ones do not contribute to reinstate\r\nyou in America who already enjoy the market for naval stores by the\r\nseparation. You seem surprised that Holland does not pour in her succors\r\nto maintain you mistress of the seas, when her own commerce is suffering\r\nby your act of navigation; or that any country should study her own\r\ninterest while yours is on the carpet.\r\n\r\nSuch excesses of passionate folly, and unjust as well as unwise\r\nresentment, have driven you on, like Pharaoh, to unpitied miseries, and\r\nwhile the importance of the quarrel shall perpetuate your disgrace, the\r\nflag of America will carry it round the world. The natural feelings of\r\nevery rational being will be against you, and wherever the story shall\r\nbe told, you will have neither excuse nor consolation left. With an\r\nunsparing hand, and an insatiable mind, you have desolated the world,\r\nto gain dominion and to lose it; and while, in a frenzy of avarice and\r\nambition, the east and the west are doomed to tributary bondage, you\r\nrapidly earned destruction as the wages of a nation.\r\n\r\nAt the thoughts of a war at home, every man amongst you ought to\r\ntremble. The prospect is far more dreadful there than in America. Here\r\nthe party that was against the measures of the continent were in general\r\ncomposed of a kind of neutrals, who added strength to neither army.\r\nThere does not exist a being so devoid of sense and sentiment as to\r\ncovet \"unconditional submission,\" and therefore no man in America could\r\nbe with you in principle. Several might from a cowardice of mind, prefer\r\nit to the hardships and dangers of opposing it; but the same disposition\r\nthat gave them such a choice, unfitted them to act either for or against\r\nus. But England is rent into parties, with equal shares of resolution.\r\nThe principle which produced the war divides the nation. Their\r\nanimosities are in the highest state of fermentation, and both sides, by\r\na call of the militia, are in arms. No human foresight can discern, no\r\nconclusion can be formed, what turn a war might take, if once set on\r\nfoot by an invasion. She is not now in a fit disposition to make a\r\ncommon cause of her own affairs, and having no conquests to hope for\r\nabroad, and nothing but expenses arising at home, her everything is\r\nstaked upon a defensive combat, and the further she goes the worse she\r\nis off.\r\n\r\nThere are situations that a nation may be in, in which peace or war,\r\nabstracted from every other consideration, may be politically right or\r\nwrong. When nothing can be lost by a war, but what must be lost without\r\nit, war is then the policy of that country; and such was the situation\r\nof America at the commencement of hostilities: but when no security can\r\nbe gained by a war, but what may be accomplished by a peace, the case\r\nbecomes reversed, and such now is the situation of England.\r\n\r\nThat America is beyond the reach of conquest, is a fact which experience\r\nhas shown and time confirmed, and this admitted, what, I ask, is now the\r\nobject of contention? If there be any honor in pursuing self-destruction\r\nwith inflexible passion--if national suicide be the perfection of\r\nnational glory, you may, with all the pride of criminal happiness,\r\nexpire unenvied and unrivalled. But when the tumult of war shall cease,\r\nand the tempest of present passions be succeeded by calm reflection, or\r\nwhen those, who, surviving its fury, shall inherit from you a legacy\r\nof debts and misfortunes, when the yearly revenue scarcely be able to\r\ndischarge the interest of the one, and no possible remedy be left for\r\nthe other, ideas far different from the present will arise, and embitter\r\nthe remembrance of former follies. A mind disarmed of its rage feels no\r\npleasure in contemplating a frantic quarrel. Sickness of thought, the\r\nsure consequence of conduct like yours, leaves no ability for enjoyment,\r\nno relish for resentment; and though, like a man in a fit, you feel\r\nnot the injury of the struggle, nor distinguish between strength and\r\ndisease, the weakness will nevertheless be proportioned to the violence,\r\nand the sense of pain increase with the recovery.\r\n\r\nTo what persons or to whose system of politics you owe your present\r\nstate of wretchedness, is a matter of total indifference to America.\r\nThey have contributed, however unwillingly, to set her above themselves,\r\nand she, in the tranquillity of conquest, resigns the inquiry. The case\r\nnow is not so properly who began the war, as who continues it. That\r\nthere are men in all countries to whom a state of war is a mine of\r\nwealth, is a fact never to be doubted. Characters like these naturally\r\nbreed in the putrefaction of distempered times, and after fattening\r\non the disease, they perish with it, or, impregnated with the stench,\r\nretreat into obscurity.\r\n\r\nBut there are several erroneous notions to which you likewise owe a\r\nshare of your misfortunes, and which, if continued, will only increase\r\nyour trouble and your losses. An opinion hangs about the gentlemen\r\nof the minority, that America would relish measures under their\r\nadministration, which she would not from the present cabinet. On this\r\nrock Lord Chatham would have split had he gained the helm, and several\r\nof his survivors are steering the same course. Such distinctions in\r\nthe infancy of the argument had some degree of foundation, but they now\r\nserve no other purpose than to lengthen out a war, in which the limits\r\nof a dispute, being fixed by the fate of arms, and guaranteed by\r\ntreaties, are not to be changed or altered by trivial circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe ministry, and many of the minority, sacrifice their time in\r\ndisputing on a question with which they have nothing to do, namely,\r\nwhether America shall be independent or not. Whereas the only question\r\nthat can come under their determination is, whether they will accede to\r\nit or not. They confound a military question with a political one, and\r\nundertake to supply by a vote what they lost by a battle. Say she shall\r\nnot be independent, and it will signify as much as if they voted\r\nagainst a decree of fate, or say that she shall, and she will be no more\r\nindependent than before. Questions which, when determined, cannot be\r\nexecuted, serve only to show the folly of dispute and the weakness of\r\ndisputants.\r\n\r\nFrom a long habit of calling America your own, you suppose her governed\r\nby the same prejudices and conceits which govern yourselves. Because you\r\nhave set up a particular denomination of religion to the exclusion of\r\nall others, you imagine she must do the same, and because you, with an\r\nunsociable narrowness of mind, have cherished enmity against France and\r\nSpain, you suppose her alliance must be defective in friendship.\r\nCopying her notions of the world from you, she formerly thought as you\r\ninstructed, but now feeling herself free, and the prejudice removed, she\r\nthinks and acts upon a different system. It frequently happens that\r\nin proportion as we are taught to dislike persons and countries, not\r\nknowing why, we feel an ardor of esteem upon the removal of the mistake:\r\nit seems as if something was to be made amends for, and we eagerly give\r\nin to every office of friendship, to atone for the injury of the error.\r\nBut, perhaps, there is something in the extent of countries, which,\r\namong the generality of people, insensibly communicates extension of the\r\nmind. The soul of an islander, in its native state, seems bounded by\r\nthe foggy confines of the water's edge, and all beyond affords to him\r\nmatters only for profit or curiosity, not for friendship. His island\r\nis to him his world, and fixed to that, his every thing centers in it;\r\nwhile those who are inhabitants of a continent, by casting their eye\r\nover a larger field, take in likewise a larger intellectual circuit,\r\nand thus approaching nearer to an acquaintance with the universe, their\r\natmosphere of thought is extended, and their liberality fills a wider\r\nspace. In short, our minds seem to be measured by countries when we are\r\nmen, as they are by places when we are children, and until something\r\nhappens to disentangle us from the prejudice, we serve under it without\r\nperceiving it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it may be remarked, that men who study any\r\nuniversal science, the principles of which are universally known, or\r\nadmitted, and applied without distinction to the common benefit of all\r\ncountries, obtain thereby a larger share of philanthropy than those\r\nwho only study national arts and improvements. Natural philosophy,\r\nmathematics and astronomy, carry the mind from the country to the\r\ncreation, and give it a fitness suited to the extent. It was not\r\nNewton's honor, neither could it be his pride, that he was an\r\nEnglishman, but that he was a philosopher, the heavens had liberated him\r\nfrom the prejudices of an island, and science had expanded his soul as\r\nboundless as his studies.\r\n\r\n                                          COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, March, 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS IX. (HAD AMERICA PURSUED HER ADVANTAGES)\r\n\r\n\r\nHAD America pursued her advantages with half the spirit that she\r\nresisted her misfortunes, she would, before now, have been a conquering\r\nand a peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of soft tranquillity, she\r\nrested on her hopes, and adversity only has convulsed her into action.\r\nWhether subtlety or sincerity at the close of the last year induced the\r\nenemy to an appearance for peace, is a point not material to know; it is\r\nsufficient that we see the effects it has had on our politics, and that\r\nwe sternly rise to resent the delusion.\r\n\r\nThe war, on the part of America, has been a war of natural feelings.\r\nBrave in distress; serene in conquest; drowsy while at rest; and in\r\nevery situation generously disposed to peace; a dangerous calm, and\r\na most heightened zeal have, as circumstances varied, succeeded each\r\nother. Every passion but that of despair has been called to a tour\r\nof duty; and so mistaken has been the enemy, of our abilities\r\nand disposition, that when she supposed us conquered, we rose the\r\nconquerors. The extensiveness of the United States, and the variety of\r\ntheir resources; the universality of their cause, the quick operation of\r\ntheir feelings, and the similarity of their sentiments, have, in every\r\ntrying situation, produced a something, which, favored by providence,\r\nand pursued with ardor, has accomplished in an instant the business of\r\na campaign. We have never deliberately sought victory, but snatched it;\r\nand bravely undone in an hour the blotted operations of a season.\r\n\r\nThe reported fate of Charleston, like the misfortunes of 1776, has at\r\nlast called forth a spirit, and kindled up a flame, which perhaps\r\nno other event could have produced. If the enemy has circulated a\r\nfalsehood, they have unwisely aggravated us into life, and if they have\r\ntold us the truth, they have unintentionally done us a service. We were\r\nreturning with folded arms from the fatigues of war, and thinking and\r\nsitting leisurely down to enjoy repose. The dependence that has been\r\nput upon Charleston threw a drowsiness over America. We looked on the\r\nbusiness done--the conflict over--the matter settled--or that all which\r\nremained unfinished would follow of itself. In this state of dangerous\r\nrelaxation, exposed to the poisonous infusions of the enemy, and having\r\nno common danger to attract our attention, we were extinguishing, by\r\nstages, the ardor we began with, and surrendering by piece-meal the\r\nvirtue that defended us.\r\n\r\nAfflicting as the loss of Charleston may be, yet if it universally rouse\r\nus from the slumber of twelve months past, and renew in us the spirit of\r\nformer days, it will produce an advantage more important than its loss.\r\nAmerica ever is what she thinks herself to be. Governed by sentiment,\r\nand acting her own mind, she becomes, as she pleases, the victor or the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nIt is not the conquest of towns, nor the accidental capture of\r\ngarrisons, that can reduce a country so extensive as this. The\r\nsufferings of one part can never be relieved by the exertions of\r\nanother, and there is no situation the enemy can be placed in that does\r\nnot afford to us the same advantages which he seeks himself. By dividing\r\nhis force, he leaves every post attackable. It is a mode of war that\r\ncarries with it a confession of weakness, and goes on the principle of\r\ndistress rather than conquest.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the enemy is visible, not only in their operations, but\r\nin their plans; Charleston originally made but a secondary object in the\r\nsystem of attack, and it is now become their principal one, because\r\nthey have not been able to succeed elsewhere. It would have carried a\r\ncowardly appearance in Europe had they formed their grand expedition, in\r\n1776, against a part of the continent where there was no army, or not\r\na sufficient one to oppose them; but failing year after year in their\r\nimpressions here, and to the eastward and northward, they deserted their\r\ncapital design, and prudently contenting themselves with what they can\r\nget, give a flourish of honor to conceal disgrace.\r\n\r\nBut this piece-meal work is not conquering the continent. It is a\r\ndiscredit in them to attempt it, and in us to suffer it. It is now full\r\ntime to put an end to a war of aggravations, which, on one side, has\r\nno possible object, and on the other has every inducement which honor,\r\ninterest, safety and happiness can inspire. If we suffer them much\r\nlonger to remain among us, we shall become as bad as themselves.\r\nAn association of vice will reduce us more than the sword. A nation\r\nhardened in the practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by it,\r\nthan a young country newly corrupted. We are not a match for them in the\r\nline of advantageous guilt, nor they for us on the principles which we\r\nbravely set out with. Our first days were our days of honor. They have\r\nmarked the character of America wherever the story of her wars are told;\r\nand convinced of this, we have nothing to do but wisely and unitedly to\r\ntread the well known track. The progress of a war is often as ruinous\r\nto individuals, as the issue of it is to a nation; and it is not only\r\nnecessary that our forces be such that we be conquerors in the end,\r\nbut that by timely exertions we be secure in the interim. The present\r\ncampaign will afford an opportunity which has never presented itself\r\nbefore, and the preparations for it are equally necessary, whether\r\nCharleston stand or fall. Suppose the first, it is in that case only\r\na failure of the enemy, not a defeat. All the conquest that a besieged\r\ntown can hope for, is, not to be conquered; and compelling an enemy\r\nto raise the siege, is to the besieged a victory. But there must be\r\na probability amounting almost to a certainty, that would justify a\r\ngarrison marching out to attack a retreat. Therefore should Charleston\r\nnot be taken, and the enemy abandon the siege, every other part of the\r\ncontinent should prepare to meet them; and, on the contrary, should it\r\nbe taken, the same preparations are necessary to balance the loss, and\r\nput ourselves in a position to co-operate with our allies, immediately\r\non their arrival.\r\n\r\nWe are not now fighting our battles alone, as we were in 1776; England,\r\nfrom a malicious disposition to America, has not only not declared war\r\nagainst France and Spain, but, the better to prosecute her passions\r\nhere, has afforded those powers no military object, and avoids them,\r\nto distress us. She will suffer her West India islands to be overrun by\r\nFrance, and her southern settlements to be taken by Spain, rather than\r\nquit the object that gratifies her revenge. This conduct, on the part\r\nof Britain, has pointed out the propriety of France sending a naval and\r\nland force to co-operate with America on the spot. Their arrival cannot\r\nbe very distant, nor the ravages of the enemy long. The recruiting the\r\narmy, and procuring the supplies, are the two things most necessary to\r\nbe accomplished, and a capture of either of the enemy's divisions will\r\nrestore to America peace and plenty.\r\n\r\nAt a crisis, big, like the present, with expectation and events, the\r\nwhole country is called to unanimity and exertion. Not an ability ought\r\nnow to sleep, that can produce but a mite to the general good, nor even\r\na whisper to pass that militates against it. The necessity of the case,\r\nand the importance of the consequences, admit no delay from a friend,\r\nno apology from an enemy. To spare now, would be the height of\r\nextravagance, and to consult present ease, would be to sacrifice it\r\nperhaps forever.\r\n\r\nAmerica, rich in patriotism and produce, can want neither men nor\r\nsupplies, when a serious necessity calls them forth. The slow\r\noperation of taxes, owing to the extensiveness of collection, and their\r\ndepreciated value before they arrived in the treasury, have, in many\r\ninstances, thrown a burden upon government, which has been artfully\r\ninterpreted by the enemy into a general decline throughout the\r\ncountry. Yet this, inconvenient as it may at first appear, is not only\r\nremediable, but may be turned to an immediate advantage; for it makes no\r\nreal difference, whether a certain number of men, or company of militia\r\n(and in this country every man is a militia-man), are directed by law\r\nto send a recruit at their own expense, or whether a tax is laid on them\r\nfor that purpose, and the man hired by government afterwards. The first,\r\nif there is any difference, is both cheapest and best, because it saves\r\nthe expense which would attend collecting it as a tax, and brings the\r\nman sooner into the field than the modes of recruiting formerly used;\r\nand, on this principle, a law has been passed in this state, for\r\nrecruiting two men from each company of militia, which will add upwards\r\nof a thousand to the force of the country.\r\n\r\nBut the flame which has broken forth in this city since the report from\r\nNew York, of the loss of Charleston, not only does honor to the place,\r\nbut, like the blaze of 1776, will kindle into action the scattered\r\nsparks throughout America. The valor of a country may be learned by the\r\nbravery of its soldiery, and the general cast of its inhabitants, but\r\nconfidence of success is best discovered by the active measures pursued\r\nby men of property; and when the spirit of enterprise becomes so\r\nuniversal as to act at once on all ranks of men, a war may then, and not\r\ntill then, be styled truly popular.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, the ardor of the enterprising part was considerably checked by\r\nthe real revolt of some, and the coolness of others. But in the present\r\ncase, there is a firmness in the substance and property of the country\r\nto the public cause. An association has been entered into by\r\nthe merchants, tradesmen, and principal inhabitants of the city\r\n[Philadelphia], to receive and support the new state money at the value\r\nof gold and silver; a measure which, while it does them honor, will\r\nlikewise contribute to their interest, by rendering the operations of\r\nthe campaign convenient and effectual.\r\n\r\nNor has the spirit of exertion stopped here. A voluntary subscription is\r\nlikewise begun, to raise a fund of hard money, to be given as bounties,\r\nto fill up the full quota of the Pennsylvania line. It has been the\r\nremark of the enemy, that every thing in America has been done by the\r\nforce of government; but when she sees individuals throwing in their\r\nvoluntary aid, and facilitating the public measures in concert with the\r\nestablished powers of the country, it will convince her that the cause\r\nof America stands not on the will of a few but on the broad foundation\r\nof property and popularity.\r\n\r\nThus aided and thus supported, disaffection will decline, and the\r\nwithered head of tyranny expire in America. The ravages of the enemy\r\nwill be short and limited, and like all their former ones, will produce\r\na victory over themselves.\r\n\r\n                                       COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, June 9, 1780.\r\n\r\nP. S. At the time of writing this number of the Crisis, the loss of\r\nCharleston, though believed by some, was more confidently disbelieved\r\nby others. But there ought to be no longer a doubt upon the matter.\r\nCharleston is gone, and I believe for the want of a sufficient supply of\r\nprovisions. The man that does not now feel for the honor of the best\r\nand noblest cause that ever a country engaged in, and exert himself\r\naccordingly, is no longer worthy of a peaceable residence among a people\r\ndetermined to be free.\r\n\r\n                                             C. S.\r\n\r\n                       THE CRISIS EXTRAORDINARY\r\n\r\n                      ON THE SUBJECT OF TAXATION.\r\n\r\nIT IS impossible to sit down and think seriously on the affairs of\r\nAmerica, but the original principles upon which she resisted, and\r\nthe glow and ardor which they inspired, will occur like the undefaced\r\nremembrance of a lovely scene. To trace over in imagination the purity\r\nof the cause, the voluntary sacrifices that were made to support it,\r\nand all the various turnings of the war in its defence, is at once both\r\npaying and receiving respect. The principles deserve to be remembered,\r\nand to remember them rightly is repossessing them. In this indulgence\r\nof generous recollection, we become gainers by what we seem to give, and\r\nthe more we bestow the richer we become.\r\n\r\nSo extensively right was the ground on which America proceeded, that it\r\nnot only took in every just and liberal sentiment which could impress\r\nthe heart, but made it the direct interest of every class and order\r\nof men to defend the country. The war, on the part of Britain, was\r\noriginally a war of covetousness. The sordid and not the splendid\r\npassions gave it being. The fertile fields and prosperous infancy of\r\nAmerica appeared to her as mines for tributary wealth. She viewed the\r\nhive, and disregarding the industry that had enriched it, thirsted for\r\nthe honey. But in the present stage of her affairs, the violence of\r\ntemper is added to the rage of avarice; and therefore, that which at\r\nthe first setting out proceeded from purity of principle and public\r\ninterest, is now heightened by all the obligations of necessity; for it\r\nrequires but little knowledge of human nature to discern what would\r\nbe the consequence, were America again reduced to the subjection of\r\nBritain. Uncontrolled power, in the hands of an incensed, imperious, and\r\nrapacious conqueror, is an engine of dreadful execution, and woe be to\r\nthat country over which it can be exercised. The names of Whig and Tory\r\nwould then be sunk in the general term of rebel, and the oppression,\r\nwhatever it might be, would, with very few instances of exception, light\r\nequally on all.\r\n\r\nBritain did not go to war with America for the sake of dominion, because\r\nshe was then in possession; neither was it for the extension of trade\r\nand commerce, because she had monopolized the whole, and the country\r\nhad yielded to it; neither was it to extinguish what she might call\r\nrebellion, because before she began no resistance existed. It could then\r\nbe from no other motive than avarice, or a design of establishing, in\r\nthe first instance, the same taxes in America as are paid in England\r\n(which, as I shall presently show, are above eleven times heavier than\r\nthe taxes we now pay for the present year, 1780) or, in the second\r\ninstance, to confiscate the whole property of America, in case of\r\nresistance and conquest of the latter, of which she had then no doubt.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to show what the taxes in England are, and what\r\nthe yearly expense of the present war is to her--what the taxes of\r\nthis country amount to, and what the annual expense of defending it\r\neffectually will be to us; and shall endeavor concisely to point out\r\nthe cause of our difficulties, and the advantages on one side, and the\r\nconsequences on the other, in case we do, or do not, put ourselves in\r\nan effectual state of defence. I mean to be open, candid, and sincere.\r\nI see a universal wish to expel the enemy from the country, a murmuring\r\nbecause the war is not carried on with more vigor, and my intention is\r\nto show, as shortly as possible, both the reason and the remedy.\r\n\r\nThe number of souls in England (exclusive of Scotland and Ireland) is\r\nseven millions,* and the number of souls in America is three millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * This is taking the highest number that the people of England have\r\nbeen, or can be rated at.\r\n\r\nThe amount of taxes in England (exclusive of Scotland and Ireland)\r\nwas, before the present war commenced, eleven millions six hundred and\r\nforty-two thousand six hundred and fifty-three pounds sterling; which,\r\non an average, is no less a sum than one pound thirteen shillings and\r\nthree-pence sterling per head per annum, men, women, and children;\r\nbesides county taxes, taxes for the support of the poor, and a tenth of\r\nall the produce of the earth for the support of the bishops and clergy.*\r\nNearly five millions of this sum went annually to pay the interest of\r\nthe national debt, contracted by former wars, and the remaining sum of\r\nsix millions six hundred and forty-two thousand six hundred pounds\r\nwas applied to defray the yearly expense of government, the peace\r\nestablishment of the army and navy, placemen, pensioners, etc.;\r\nconsequently the whole of the enormous taxes being thus appropriated,\r\nshe had nothing to spare out of them towards defraying the expenses\r\nof the present war or any other. Yet had she not been in debt at the\r\nbeginning of the war, as we were not, and, like us, had only a land and\r\nnot a naval war to carry on, her then revenue of eleven millions and a\r\nhalf pounds sterling would have defrayed all her annual expenses of\r\nwar and government within each year. * The following is taken from Dr.\r\nPrice's state of the taxes of England.\r\n\r\nAn account of the money drawn from the public by taxes, annually, being\r\nthe medium of three years before the year 1776.\r\n\r\n    Amount of customs in England                         2,528,275 L.\r\n    Amount of the excise in England                      4,649,892\r\n    Land tax at 3s.                                      1,300,000\r\n    Land tax at 1s. in the pound                           450,000\r\n    Salt duties                                            218,739\r\n    Duties on stamps, cards, dice, advertisements,\r\n      bonds, leases, indentures, newspapers,\r\n      almanacks, etc.                                      280,788\r\n    Duties on houses and windows                           385,369\r\n    Post office, seizures, wine licences, hackney\r\n      coaches, etc.                                        250,000\r\n    Annual profits from lotteries                          150,000\r\n    Expense of collecting the excise in England            297,887\r\n    Expense of collecting the customs in England           468,703\r\n    Interest of loans on the land tax at 4s. expenses\r\n      of collection, militia, etc.                         250,000\r\n    Perquisites, etc. to custom-house officers, &c.\r\n      supposed                                             250,000\r\n    Expense of collecting the salt duties in England\r\n      10 1/2 per cent.                                      27,000\r\n    Bounties on fish exported                               18,000\r\n    Expense of collecting the duties on stamps, cards,\r\n      advertisements, etc. at 5 and 1/4 per cent.           18,000\r\n\r\n                                                  Total 11,642,653 L.\r\n\r\nBut this not being the case with her, she is obliged to borrow about ten\r\nmillions pounds sterling, yearly, to prosecute the war that she is now\r\nengaged in, (this year she borrowed twelve) and lay on new taxes to\r\ndischarge the interest; allowing that the present war has cost her only\r\nfifty millions sterling, the interest thereon, at five per cent., will\r\nbe two millions and an half; therefore the amount of her taxes now\r\nmust be fourteen millions, which on an average is no less than forty\r\nshillings sterling, per head, men, women and children, throughout the\r\nnation. Now as this expense of fifty millions was borrowed on the hopes\r\nof conquering America, and as it was avarice which first induced her to\r\ncommence the war, how truly wretched and deplorable would the condition\r\nof this country be, were she, by her own remissness, to suffer an\r\nenemy of such a disposition, and so circumstanced, to reduce her to\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to the revenues of America.\r\n\r\nI have already stated the number of souls in America to be three\r\nmillions, and by a calculation that I have made, which I have every\r\nreason to believe is sufficiently correct, the whole expense of the\r\nwar, and the support of the several governments, may be defrayed for\r\ntwo million pounds sterling annually; which, on an average, is thirteen\r\nshillings and four pence per head, men, women, and children, and the\r\npeace establishment at the end of the war will be but three quarters of\r\na million, or five shillings sterling per head. Now, throwing out of\r\nthe question everything of honor, principle, happiness, freedom, and\r\nreputation in the world, and taking it up on the simple ground of\r\ninterest, I put the following case:\r\n\r\nSuppose Britain was to conquer America, and, as a conqueror, was to lay\r\nher under no other conditions than to pay the same proportion towards\r\nher annual revenue which the people of England pay: our share, in that\r\ncase, would be six million pounds sterling yearly. Can it then be\r\na question, whether it is best to raise two millions to defend the\r\ncountry, and govern it ourselves, and only three quarters of a million\r\nafterwards, or pay six millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy\r\ngovern it?\r\n\r\nCan it be supposed that conquerors would choose to put themselves in a\r\nworse condition than what they granted to the conquered? In England, the\r\ntax on rum is five shillings and one penny sterling per gallon, which is\r\none silver dollar and fourteen coppers. Now would it not be laughable to\r\nimagine, that after the expense they have been at, they would let either\r\nWhig or Tory drink it cheaper than themselves? Coffee, which is so\r\ninconsiderable an article of consumption and support here, is there\r\nloaded with a duty which makes the price between five and six shillings\r\nper pound, and a penalty of fifty pounds sterling on any person detected\r\nin roasting it in his own house. There is scarcely a necessary of life\r\nthat you can eat, drink, wear, or enjoy, that is not there loaded with\r\na tax; even the light from heaven is only permitted to shine into their\r\ndwellings by paying eighteen pence sterling per window annually; and the\r\nhumblest drink of life, small beer, cannot there be purchased without a\r\ntax of nearly two coppers per gallon, besides a heavy tax upon the malt,\r\nand another on the hops before it is brewed, exclusive of a land-tax on\r\nthe earth which produces them. In short, the condition of that country,\r\nin point of taxation, is so oppressive, the number of her poor so great,\r\nand the extravagance and rapaciousness of the court so enormous, that,\r\nwere they to effect a conquest of America, it is then only that the\r\ndistresses of America would begin. Neither would it signify anything\r\nto a man whether he be Whig or Tory. The people of England, and the\r\nministry of that country, know us by no such distinctions. What they\r\nwant is clear, solid revenue, and the modes which they would take to\r\nprocure it, would operate alike on all. Their manner of reasoning would\r\nbe short, because they would naturally infer, that if we were able to\r\ncarry on a war of five or six years against them, we were able to pay\r\nthe same taxes which they do.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the expense of conducting the present war,\r\nand the government of the several states, may be done for two millions\r\nsterling, and the establishment in the time of peace, for three quarters\r\nof a million.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * I have made the calculations in sterling, because it is a rate\r\ngenerally known in all the states, and because, likewise, it admits of\r\nan easy comparison between our expenses to support the war, and those\r\nof the enemy. Four silver dollars and a half is one pound sterling, and\r\nthree pence over.\r\n\r\nAs to navy matters, they flourish so well, and are so well attended to\r\nby individuals, that I think it consistent on every principle of real\r\nuse and economy, to turn the navy into hard money (keeping only three or\r\nfour packets) and apply it to the service of the army. We shall not have\r\na ship the less; the use of them, and the benefit from them, will be\r\ngreatly increased, and their expense saved. We are now allied with a\r\nformidable naval power, from whom we derive the assistance of a navy.\r\nAnd the line in which we can prosecute the war, so as to reduce the\r\ncommon enemy and benefit the alliance most effectually, will be by\r\nattending closely to the land service.\r\n\r\nI estimate the charge of keeping up and maintaining an army, officering\r\nthem, and all expenses included, sufficient for the defence of the\r\ncountry, to be equal to the expense of forty thousand men at thirty\r\npounds sterling per head, which is one million two hundred thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nI likewise allow four hundred thousand pounds for continental expenses\r\nat home and abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd four hundred thousand pounds for the support of the several state\r\ngovernments--the amount will then be:\r\n\r\n    For the army                                         1,200,000 L.\r\n    Continental expenses at home and abroad                400,000\r\n    Government of the several states                       400,000\r\n\r\n                                                   Total 2,000,000 L.\r\n\r\nI take the proportion of this state, Pennsylvania, to be an eighth part\r\nof the thirteen United States; the quota then for us to raise will be\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling; two hundred thousand\r\nof which will be our share for the support and pay of the army, and\r\ncontinental expenses at home and abroad, and fifty thousand pounds for\r\nthe support of the state government.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain an idea of the proportion in which the raising such a\r\nsum will fall, I make the following calculation:\r\n\r\nPennsylvania contains three hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\ninhabitants, men, women and children; which is likewise an eighth of the\r\nnumber of inhabitants of the whole United States: therefore, two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand pounds sterling to be raised among three hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand persons, is, on an average, thirteen shillings\r\nand four pence per head, per annum, or something more than one shilling\r\nsterling per month. And our proportion of three quarters of a\r\nmillion for the government of the country, in time of peace, will be\r\nninety-three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling; fifty\r\nthousand of which will be for the government expenses of the state,\r\nand forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds for continental\r\nexpenses at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe peace establishment then will, on an average, be five shillings\r\nsterling per head. Whereas, was England now to stop, and the war cease,\r\nher peace establishment would continue the same as it is now, viz. forty\r\nshillings per head; therefore was our taxes necessary for carrying on\r\nthe war, as much per head as hers now is, and the difference to be\r\nonly whether we should, at the end of the war, pay at the rate of five\r\nshillings per head, or forty shillings per head, the case needs no\r\nthinking of. But as we can securely defend and keep the country for\r\none third less than what our burden would be if it was conquered, and\r\nsupport the governments afterwards for one eighth of what Britain would\r\nlevy on us, and could I find a miser whose heart never felt the emotion\r\nof a spark of principle, even that man, uninfluenced by every love but\r\nthe love of money, and capable of no attachment but to his interest,\r\nwould and must, from the frugality which governs him, contribute to the\r\ndefence of the country, or he ceases to be a miser and becomes an idiot.\r\nBut when we take in with it every thing that can ornament mankind; when\r\nthe line of our interest becomes the line of our happiness; when all\r\nthat can cheer and animate the heart, when a sense of honor, fame,\r\ncharacter, at home and abroad, are interwoven not only with the security\r\nbut the increase of property, there exists not a man in America, unless\r\nhe be an hired emissary, who does not see that his good is connected\r\nwith keeping up a sufficient defence.\r\n\r\nI do not imagine that an instance can be produced in the world, of a\r\ncountry putting herself to such an amazing charge to conquer and enslave\r\nanother, as Britain has done. The sum is too great for her to think of\r\nwith any tolerable degree of temper; and when we consider the burden\r\nshe sustains, as well as the disposition she has shown, it would be the\r\nheight of folly in us to suppose that she would not reimburse herself by\r\nthe most rapid means, had she America once more within her power. With\r\nsuch an oppression of expense, what would an empty conquest be to her!\r\nWhat relief under such circumstances could she derive from a victory\r\nwithout a prize? It was money, it was revenue she first went to war for,\r\nand nothing but that would satisfy her. It is not the nature of avarice\r\nto be satisfied with any thing else. Every passion that acts upon\r\nmankind has a peculiar mode of operation. Many of them are temporary\r\nand fluctuating; they admit of cessation and variety. But avarice is a\r\nfixed, uniform passion. It neither abates of its vigor nor changes its\r\nobject; and the reason why it does not, is founded in the nature of\r\nthings, for wealth has not a rival where avarice is a ruling passion.\r\nOne beauty may excel another, and extinguish from the mind of man the\r\npictured remembrance of a former one: but wealth is the phoenix of\r\navarice, and therefore it cannot seek a new object, because there is not\r\nanother in the world.\r\n\r\nI now pass on to show the value of the present taxes, and compare them\r\nwith the annual expense; but this I shall preface with a few explanatory\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct things which make the payment of taxes difficult;\r\nthe one is the large and real value of the sum to be paid, and the other\r\nis the scarcity of the thing in which the payment is to be made; and\r\nalthough these appear to be one and the same, they are in several\r\ninstances riot only different, but the difficulty springs from different\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nSuppose a tax to be laid equal to one half of what a man's yearly income\r\nis, such a tax could not be paid, because the property could not be\r\nspared; and on the other hand, suppose a very trifling tax was laid, to\r\nbe collected in pearls, such a tax likewise could not be paid, because\r\nthey could not be had. Now any person may see that these are distinct\r\ncases, and the latter of them is a representation of our own.\r\n\r\nThat the difficulty cannot proceed from the former, that is, from the\r\nreal value or weight of the tax, is evident at the first view to any\r\nperson who will consider it.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the quota of taxes for this State for the year, 1780, (and\r\nso in proportion for every other State,) is twenty millions of dollars,\r\nwhich at seventy for one, is but sixty-four thousand two hundred and\r\neighty pounds three shillings sterling, and on an average, is no more\r\nthan three shillings and five pence sterling per head, per annum, per\r\nman, woman and child, or threepence two-fifths per head per month. Now\r\nhere is a clear, positive fact, that cannot be contradicted, and which\r\nproves that the difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in\r\nitself it is a trifle, and far from being adequate to our quota of the\r\nexpense of the war. The quit-rents of one penny sterling per acre on\r\nonly one half of the state, come to upwards of fifty thousand pounds,\r\nwhich is almost as much as all the taxes of the present year, and\r\nas those quit-rents made no part of the taxes then paid, and are now\r\ndiscontinued, the quantity of money drawn for public-service this year,\r\nexclusive of the militia fines, which I shall take notice of in the\r\nprocess of this work, is less than what was paid and payable in any year\r\npreceding the revolution, and since the last war; what I mean is, that\r\nthe quit-rents and taxes taken together came to a larger sum then, than\r\nthe present taxes without the quit-rents do now.\r\n\r\nMy intention by these arguments and calculations is to place the\r\ndifficulty to the right cause, and show that it does not proceed from\r\nthe weight or worth of the tax, but from the scarcity of the medium in\r\nwhich it is paid; and to illustrate this point still further, I shall\r\nnow show, that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of four\r\ntimes the real value it now is, or nearly so, which would be about two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, and would be our full quota,\r\nthis sum would have been raised with more ease, and have been less felt,\r\nthan the present sum of only sixty-four thousand two hundred and eighty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe convenience or inconvenience of paying a tax in money arises from\r\nthe quantity of money that can be spared out of trade.\r\n\r\nWhen the emissions stopped, the continent was left in possession of\r\ntwo hundred millions of dollars, perhaps as equally dispersed as it was\r\npossible for trade to do it. And as no more was to be issued, the rise\r\nor fall of prices could neither increase nor diminish the quantity. It\r\ntherefore remained the same through all the fluctuations of trade and\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nNow had the exchange stood at twenty for one, which was the rate\r\nCongress calculated upon when they arranged the quota of the several\r\nstates, the latter end of last year, trade would have been carried on\r\nfor nearly four times less money than it is now, and consequently the\r\ntwenty millions would have been spared with much greater ease, and when\r\ncollected would have been of almost four times the value that they now\r\nare. And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be ninety or one\r\nhundred for one, the quantity required for trade would be more than at\r\nsixty or seventy for one, and though the value of them would be less,\r\nthe difficulty of sparing the money out of trade would be greater. And\r\non these facts and arguments I rest the matter, to prove that it is\r\nnot the want of property, but the scarcity of the medium by which the\r\nproportion of property for taxation is to be measured out, that makes\r\nthe embarrassment which we lie under. There is not money enough, and,\r\nwhat is equally as true, the people will not let there be money enough.\r\n\r\nWhile I am on the subject of the currency, I shall offer one remark\r\nwhich will appear true to everybody, and can be accounted for by nobody,\r\nwhich is, that the better the times were, the worse the money grew;\r\nand the worse the times were, the better the money stood. It never\r\ndepreciated by any advantage obtained by the enemy. The troubles of\r\n1776, and the loss of Philadelphia in 1777, made no sensible impression\r\non it, and every one knows that the surrender of Charleston did not\r\nproduce the least alteration in the rate of exchange, which, for long\r\nbefore, and for more than three months after, stood at sixty for one. It\r\nseems as if the certainty of its being our own, made us careless of its\r\nvalue, and that the most distant thoughts of losing it made us hug\r\nit the closer, like something we were loth to part with; or that we\r\ndepreciate it for our pastime, which, when called to seriousness by the\r\nenemy, we leave off to renew again at our leisure. In short, our good\r\nluck seems to break us, and our bad makes us whole.\r\n\r\nPassing on from this digression, I shall now endeavor to bring into one\r\nview the several parts which I have already stated, and form thereon\r\nsome propositions, and conclude.\r\n\r\nI have placed before the reader, the average tax per head, paid by the\r\npeople of England; which is forty shillings sterling.\r\n\r\nAnd I have shown the rate on an average per head, which will defray\r\nall the expenses of the war to us, and support the several governments\r\nwithout running the country into debt, which is thirteen shillings and\r\nfour pence.\r\n\r\nI have shown what the peace establishment may be conducted for, viz., an\r\neighth part of what it would be, if under the government of Britain.\r\n\r\nAnd I have likewise shown what the average per head of the present\r\ntaxes is, namely, three shillings and fivepence sterling, or threepence\r\ntwo-fifths per month; and that their whole yearly value, in sterling,\r\nis only sixty-four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds. Whereas our\r\nquota, to keep the payments equal with the expenses, is two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand pounds. Consequently, there is a deficiency of one\r\nhundred and eighty-five thousand seven hundred and twenty pounds, and\r\nthe same proportion of defect, according to the several quotas, happens\r\nin every other state. And this defect is the cause why the army has been\r\nso indifferently fed, clothed and paid. It is the cause, likewise, of\r\nthe nerveless state of the campaign, and the insecurity of the country.\r\nNow, if a tax equal to thirteen and fourpence per head, will remove all\r\nthese difficulties, and make people secure in their homes, leave them to\r\nfollow the business of their stores and farms unmolested, and not only\r\ndrive out but keep out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect of\r\nraising this sum will let them in, and produce the evils which might be\r\nprevented--on which side, I ask, does the wisdom, interest and policy\r\nlie? Or, rather, would it not be an insult to reason, to put the\r\nquestion? The sum, when proportioned out according to the several\r\nabilities of the people, can hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy\r\nruins hundreds of families.\r\n\r\nLook at the destruction done in this city [Philadelphia]. The many\r\nhouses totally destroyed, and others damaged; the waste of fences in\r\nthe country round it, besides the plunder of furniture, forage,\r\nand provisions. I do not suppose that half a million sterling would\r\nreinstate the sufferers; and, does this, I ask, bear any proportion to\r\nthe expense that would make us secure? The damage, on an average, is\r\nat least ten pounds sterling per head, which is as much as thirteen\r\nshillings and fourpence per head comes to for fifteen years. The same\r\nhas happened on the frontiers, and in the Jerseys, New York, and other\r\nplaces where the enemy has been--Carolina and Georgia are likewise\r\nsuffering the same fate.\r\n\r\nThat the people generally do not understand the insufficiency of the\r\ntaxes to carry on the war, is evident, not only from common observation,\r\nbut from the construction of several petitions which were presented to\r\nthe Assembly of this state, against the recommendation of Congress of\r\nthe 18th of March last, for taking up and funding the present currency\r\nat forty to one, and issuing new money in its stead. The prayer of the\r\npetition was, that the currency might be appreciated by taxes (meaning\r\nthe present taxes) and that part of the taxes be applied to the support\r\nof the army, if the army could not be otherwise supported. Now it could\r\nnot have been possible for such a petition to have been presented,\r\nhad the petitioners known, that so far from part of the taxes being\r\nsufficient for the support of the whole of them falls three-fourths\r\nshort of the year's expenses.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to propose methods by which a sufficiency of money\r\nmay be raised, I shall take a short view of the general state of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the weight of the war, the ravages of the enemy, and the\r\nobstructions she has thrown in the way of trade and commerce, so soon\r\ndoes a young country outgrow misfortune, that America has already\r\nsurmounted many that heavily oppressed her. For the first year or two\r\nof the war, we were shut up within our ports, scarce venturing to look\r\ntowards the ocean. Now our rivers are beautified with large and valuable\r\nvessels, our stores filled with merchandise, and the produce of the\r\ncountry has a ready market, and an advantageous price. Gold and silver,\r\nthat for a while seemed to have retreated again within the bowels of\r\nthe earth, have once more risen into circulation, and every day adds new\r\nstrength to trade, commerce and agriculture. In a pamphlet, written\r\nby Sir John Dalrymple, and dispersed in America in the year 1775, he\r\nasserted that two twenty-gun ships, nay, says he, tenders of those\r\nships, stationed between Albermarle sound and Chesapeake bay, would shut\r\nup the trade of America for 600 miles. How little did Sir John Dalrymple\r\nknow of the abilities of America!\r\n\r\nWhile under the government of Britain, the trade of this country was\r\nloaded with restrictions. It was only a few foreign ports which we were\r\nallowed to sail to. Now it is otherwise; and allowing that the quantity\r\nof trade is but half what it was before the war, the case must show the\r\nvast advantage of an open trade, because the present quantity under her\r\nrestrictions could not support itself; from which I infer, that if half\r\nthe quantity without the restrictions can bear itself up nearly, if not\r\nquite, as well as the whole when subject to them, how prosperous must\r\nthe condition of America be when the whole shall return open with all\r\nthe world. By the trade I do not mean the employment of a merchant only,\r\nbut the whole interest and business of the country taken collectively.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much my intention, by this publication, to propose\r\nparticular plans for raising money, as it is to show the necessity and\r\nthe advantages to be derived from it. My principal design is to form the\r\ndisposition of the people to the measures which I am fully persuaded it\r\nis their interest and duty to adopt, and which need no other force to\r\naccomplish them than the force of being felt. But as every hint may\r\nbe useful, I shall throw out a sketch, and leave others to make such\r\nimprovements upon it as to them may appear reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe annual sum wanted is two millions, and the average rate in which it\r\nfalls, is thirteen shillings and fourpence per head.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, that we raise half the sum and sixty thousand pounds\r\nover. The average rate thereof will be seven shillings per head.\r\n\r\nIn this case we shall have half the supply that we want, and an annual\r\nfund of sixty thousand pounds whereon to borrow the other million;\r\nbecause sixty thousand pounds is the interest of a million at six per\r\ncent.; and if at the end of another year we should be obliged, by the\r\ncontinuance of the war, to borrow another million, the taxes will be\r\nincreased to seven shillings and sixpence; and thus for every million\r\nborrowed, an additional tax, equal to sixpence per head, must be levied.\r\n\r\nThe sum to be raised next year will be one million and sixty thousand\r\npounds: one half of which I would propose should be raised by duties on\r\nimported goods, and prize goods, and the other half by a tax on landed\r\nproperty and houses, or such other means as each state may devise.\r\n\r\nBut as the duties on imports and prize goods must be the same in all the\r\nstates, therefore the rate per cent., or what other form the duty shall\r\nbe laid, must be ascertained and regulated by Congress, and ingrafted in\r\nthat form into the law of each state; and the monies arising therefrom\r\ncarried into the treasury of each state. The duties to be paid in gold\r\nor silver.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why a duty on imports is the most convenient\r\nduty or tax that can be collected; one of which is, because the whole is\r\npayable in a few places in a country, and it likewise operates with the\r\ngreatest ease and equality, because as every one pays in proportion to\r\nwhat he consumes, so people in general consume in proportion to what\r\nthey can afford; and therefore the tax is regulated by the abilities\r\nwhich every man supposes himself to have, or in other words, every man\r\nbecomes his own assessor, and pays by a little at a time, when it suits\r\nhim to buy. Besides, it is a tax which people may pay or let alone\r\nby not consuming the articles; and though the alternative may have no\r\ninfluence on their conduct, the power of choosing is an agreeable thing\r\nto the mind. For my own part, it would be a satisfaction to me was there\r\na duty on all sorts of liquors during the war, as in my idea of things\r\nit would be an addition to the pleasures of society to know, that when\r\nthe health of the army goes round, a few drops, from every glass becomes\r\ntheirs. How often have I heard an emphatical wish, almost accompanied by\r\na tear, \"Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had some of this!\" Why\r\nthen need we suffer under a fruitless sympathy, when there is a way to\r\nenjoy both the wish and the entertainment at once.\r\n\r\nBut the great national policy of putting a duty upon imports is, that it\r\neither keeps the foreign trade in our own hands, or draws something for\r\nthe defence of the country from every foreigner who participates in it\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nThus much for the first half of the taxes, and as each state will best\r\ndevise means to raise the other half, I shall confine my remarks to the\r\nresources of this state.\r\n\r\nThe quota, then, of this state, of one million and sixty thousand\r\npounds, will be one hundred and thirty-three thousand two hundred and\r\nfifty pounds, the half of which is sixty-six thousand six hundred\r\nand twenty-five pounds; and supposing one fourth part of Pennsylvania\r\ninhabited, then a tax of one bushel of wheat on every twenty acres of\r\nland, one with another, would produce the sum, and all the present taxes\r\nto cease. Whereas, the tithes of the bishops and clergy in England,\r\nexclusive of the taxes, are upwards of half a bushel of wheat on every\r\nsingle acre of land, good and bad, throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the former part of this paper, I mentioned the militia fines, but\r\nreserved speaking of the matter, which I shall now do. The ground I\r\nshall put it upon is, that two millions sterling a year will support\r\na sufficient army, and all the expenses of war and government, without\r\nhaving recourse to the inconvenient method of continually calling men\r\nfrom their employments, which, of all others, is the most expensive and\r\nthe least substantial. I consider the revenues created by taxes as the\r\nfirst and principal thing, and fines only as secondary and accidental\r\nthings. It was not the intention of the militia law to apply the fines\r\nto anything else but the support of the militia, neither do they produce\r\nany revenue to the state, yet these fines amount to more than all the\r\ntaxes: for taking the muster-roll to be sixty thousand men, the fine\r\non forty thousand who may not attend, will be sixty thousand pounds\r\nsterling, and those who muster, will give up a portion of time equal\r\nto half that sum, and if the eight classes should be called within the\r\nyear, and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining forty thousand\r\nwould amount to seventy-two millions of dollars, besides the fifteen\r\nshillings on every hundred pounds of property, and the charge of seven\r\nand a half per cent. for collecting, in certain instances which, on\r\nthe whole, would be upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nNow if those very fines disable the country from raising a sufficient\r\nrevenue without producing an equivalent advantage, would it not be for\r\nthe ease and interest of all parties to increase the revenue, in the\r\nmanner I have proposed, or any better, if a better can be devised, and\r\ncease the operation of the fines? I would still keep the militia as an\r\norganized body of men, and should there be a real necessity to call them\r\nforth, pay them out of the proper revenues of the state, and increase\r\nthe taxes a third or fourth per cent. on those who do not attend. My\r\nlimits will not allow me to go further into this matter, which I shall\r\ntherefore close with this remark; that fines are, of all modes of\r\nrevenue, the most unsuited to the minds of a free country. When a\r\nman pays a tax, he knows that the public necessity requires it, and\r\ntherefore feels a pride in discharging his duty; but a fine seems\r\nan atonement for neglect of duty, and of consequence is paid with\r\ndiscredit, and frequently levied with severity.\r\n\r\nI have now only one subject more to speak of, with which I shall\r\nconclude, which is, the resolve of Congress of the 18th of March last,\r\nfor taking up and funding the present currency at forty for one, and\r\nissuing new money in its stead.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that I am not the flatterer of Congress, but in this\r\ninstance they are right; and if that measure is supported, the currency\r\nwill acquire a value, which, without it, it will not. But this is not\r\nall: it will give relief to the finances until such time as they can be\r\nproperly arranged, and save the country from being immediately doubled\r\ntaxed under the present mode. In short, support that measure, and it\r\nwill support you.\r\n\r\nI have now waded through a tedious course of difficult business, and\r\nover an untrodden path. The subject, on every point in which it could be\r\nviewed, was entangled with perplexities, and enveloped in obscurity, yet\r\nsuch are the resources of America, that she wants nothing but system to\r\nsecure success.\r\n\r\n                                          COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4, 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS X. ON THE KING OF ENGLAND'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF all the innocent passions which actuate the human mind there is none\r\nmore universally prevalent than curiosity. It reaches all mankind, and\r\nin matters which concern us, or concern us not, it alike provokes in us\r\na desire to know them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the situation of America, superior to every effort to enslave\r\nher, and daily rising to importance and opulence, has placed her above\r\nthe region of anxiety, it has still left her within the circle of\r\ncuriosity; and her fancy to see the speech of a man who had proudly\r\nthreatened to bring her to his feet, was visibly marked with that\r\ntranquil confidence which cared nothing about its contents. It was\r\ninquired after with a smile, read with a laugh, and dismissed with\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\nBut, as justice is due, even to an enemy, it is right to say, that the\r\nspeech is as well managed as the embarrassed condition of their affairs\r\ncould well admit of; and though hardly a line of it is true, except the\r\nmournful story of Cornwallis, it may serve to amuse the deluded commons\r\nand people of England, for whom it was calculated.\r\n\r\n\"The war,\" says the speech, \"is still unhappily prolonged by that\r\nrestless ambition which first excited our enemies to commence it, and\r\nwhich still continues to disappoint my earnest wishes and diligent\r\nexertions to restore the public tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nHow easy it is to abuse truth and language, when men, by habitual\r\nwickedness, have learned to set justice at defiance. That the very man\r\nwho began the war, who with the most sullen insolence refused to answer,\r\nand even to hear the humblest of all petitions, who has encouraged\r\nhis officers and his army in the most savage cruelties, and the most\r\nscandalous plunderings, who has stirred up the Indians on one side, and\r\nthe negroes on the other, and invoked every aid of hell in his behalf,\r\nshould now, with an affected air of pity, turn the tables from himself,\r\nand charge to another the wickedness that is his own, can only be\r\nequalled by the baseness of the heart that spoke it.\r\n\r\nTo be nobly wrong is more manly than to be meanly right, is an\r\nexpression I once used on a former occasion, and it is equally\r\napplicable now. We feel something like respect for consistency even in\r\nerror. We lament the virtue that is debauched into a vice, but the\r\nvice that affects a virtue becomes the more detestable: and amongst the\r\nvarious assumptions of character, which hypocrisy has taught, and men\r\nhave practised, there is none that raises a higher relish of disgust,\r\nthan to see disappointed inveteracy twisting itself, by the most visible\r\nfalsehoods, into an appearance of piety which it has no pretensions to.\r\n\r\n\"But I should not,\" continues the speech, \"answer the trust committed\r\nto the sovereign of a free people, nor make a suitable return to my\r\nsubjects for their constant, zealous, and affectionate attachment to my\r\nperson, family and government, if I consented to sacrifice, either to\r\nmy own desire of peace, or to their temporary ease and relief, those\r\nessential rights and permanent interests, upon the maintenance and\r\npreservation of which, the future strength and security of this country\r\nmust principally depend.\"\r\n\r\nThat the man whose ignorance and obstinacy first involved and still\r\ncontinues the nation in the most hopeless and expensive of all wars,\r\nshould now meanly flatter them with the name of a free people, and make\r\na merit of his crime, under the disguise of their essential rights and\r\npermanent interests, is something which disgraces even the character of\r\nperverseness. Is he afraid they will send him to Hanover, or what does\r\nhe fear? Why is the sycophant thus added to the hypocrite, and the man\r\nwho pretends to govern, sunk into the humble and submissive memorialist?\r\n\r\nWhat those essential rights and permanent interests are, on which the\r\nfuture strength and security of England must principally depend, are not\r\nso much as alluded to. They are words which impress nothing but the ear,\r\nand are calculated only for the sound.\r\n\r\nBut if they have any reference to America, then do they amount to\r\nthe disgraceful confession, that England, who once assumed to be her\r\nprotectress, has now become her dependant. The British king and ministry\r\nare constantly holding up the vast importance which America is of\r\nto England, in order to allure the nation to carry on the war: now,\r\nwhatever ground there is for this idea, it ought to have operated as a\r\nreason for not beginning it; and, therefore, they support their present\r\nmeasures to their own disgrace, because the arguments which they now\r\nuse, are a direct reflection on their former policy.\r\n\r\n\"The favorable appearance of affairs,\" continues the speech, \"in the\r\nEast Indies, and the safe arrival of the numerous commercial fleets of\r\nmy kingdom, must have given you satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nThat things are not quite so bad every where as in America may be some\r\ncause of consolation, but can be none for triumph. One broken leg\r\nis better than two, but still it is not a source of joy: and let the\r\nappearance of affairs in the East Indies be ever so favorable, they are\r\nnevertheless worse than at first, without a prospect of their ever being\r\nbetter. But the mournful story of Cornwallis was yet to be told, and it\r\nwas necessary to give it the softest introduction possible.\r\n\r\n\"But in the course of this year,\" continues the speech, \"my assiduous\r\nendeavors to guard the extensive dominions of my crown have not been\r\nattended with success equal to the justice and uprightness of my\r\nviews.\"--What justice and uprightness there was in beginning a war with\r\nAmerica, the world will judge of, and the unequalled barbarity with\r\nwhich it has been conducted, is not to be worn from the memory by the\r\ncant of snivelling hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n\"And it is with great concern that I inform you that the events of war\r\nhave been very unfortunate to my arms in Virginia, having ended in the\r\nloss of my forces in that province.\"--And our great concern is that they\r\nare not all served in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\"No endeavors have been wanted on my part,\" says the speech, \"to\r\nextinguish that spirit of rebellion which our enemies have found means\r\nto foment and maintain in the colonies; and to restore to my deluded\r\nsubjects in America that happy and prosperous condition which they\r\nformerly derived from a due obedience to the laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression of deluded subjects is become so hacknied and\r\ncontemptible, and the more so when we see them making prisoners of whole\r\narmies at a time, that the pride of not being laughed at would induce a\r\nman of common sense to leave it off. But the most offensive falsehood\r\nin the paragraph is the attributing the prosperity of America to a\r\nwrong cause. It was the unremitted industry of the settlers and their\r\ndescendants, the hard labor and toil of persevering fortitude, that\r\nwere the true causes of the prosperity of America. The former tyranny\r\nof England served to people it, and the virtue of the adventurers to\r\nimprove it. Ask the man, who, with his axe, has cleared a way in the\r\nwilderness, and now possesses an estate, what made him rich, and he will\r\ntell you the labor of his hands, the sweat of his brow, and the blessing\r\nof heaven. Let Britain but leave America to herself and she asks no\r\nmore. She has risen into greatness without the knowledge and against the\r\nwill of England, and has a right to the unmolested enjoyment of her own\r\ncreated wealth.\r\n\r\n\"I will order,\" says the speech, \"the estimates of the ensuing year to\r\nbe laid before you. I rely on your wisdom and public spirit for such\r\nsupplies as the circumstances of our affairs shall be found to require.\r\nAmong the many ill consequences which attend the continuation of the\r\npresent war, I most sincerely regret the additional burdens which it\r\nmust unavoidably bring upon my faithful subjects.\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange that a nation must run through such a labyrinth of\r\ntrouble, and expend such a mass of wealth to gain the wisdom which an\r\nhour's reflection might have taught. The final superiority of America\r\nover every attempt that an island might make to conquer her, was as\r\nnaturally marked in the constitution of things, as the future ability of\r\na giant over a dwarf is delineated in his features while an infant.\r\nHow far providence, to accomplish purposes which no human wisdom could\r\nforesee, permitted such extraordinary errors, is still a secret in the\r\nwomb of time, and must remain so till futurity shall give it birth.\r\n\r\n\"In the prosecution of this great and important contest,\" says the\r\nspeech, \"in which we are engaged, I retain a firm confidence in the\r\nprotection of divine providence, and a perfect conviction in the justice\r\nof my cause, and I have no doubt, but, that by the concurrence and\r\nsupport of my Parliament, by the valour of my fleets and armies, and by\r\na vigorous, animated, and united exertion of the faculties and resources\r\nof my people, I shall be enabled to restore the blessings of a safe and\r\nhonorable peace to all my dominions.\"\r\n\r\nThe King of England is one of the readiest believers in the world. In\r\nthe beginning of the contest he passed an act to put America out of the\r\nprotection of the crown of England, and though providence, for seven\r\nyears together, has put him out of her protection, still the man has no\r\ndoubt. Like Pharaoh on the edge of the Red Sea, he sees not the plunge\r\nhe is making, and precipitately drives across the flood that is closing\r\nover his head.\r\n\r\nI think it is a reasonable supposition, that this part of the speech was\r\ncomposed before the arrival of the news of the capture of Cornwallis:\r\nfor it certainly has no relation to their condition at the time it was\r\nspoken. But, be this as it may, it is nothing to us. Our line is\r\nfixed. Our lot is cast; and America, the child of fate, is arriving at\r\nmaturity. We have nothing to do but by a spirited and quick exertion,\r\nto stand prepared for war or peace. Too great to yield, and too noble\r\nto insult; superior to misfortune, and generous in success, let us\r\nuntaintedly preserve the character which we have gained, and show to\r\nfuture ages an example of unequalled magnanimity. There is something in\r\nthe cause and consequence of America that has drawn on her the attention\r\nof all mankind. The world has seen her brave. Her love of liberty; her\r\nardour in supporting it; the justice of her claims, and the constancy\r\nof her fortitude have won her the esteem of Europe, and attached to her\r\ninterest the first power in that country.\r\n\r\nHer situation now is such, that to whatever point, past, present or to\r\ncome, she casts her eyes, new matter rises to convince her that she is\r\nright. In her conduct towards her enemy, no reproachful sentiment lurks\r\nin secret. No sense of injustice is left upon the mind. Untainted with\r\nambition, and a stranger to revenge, her progress has been marked by\r\nprovidence, and she, in every stage of the conflict, has blest her with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBut let not America wrap herself up in delusive hope and suppose the\r\nbusiness done. The least remissness in preparation, the least relaxation\r\nin execution, will only serve to prolong the war, and increase\r\nexpenses. If our enemies can draw consolation from misfortune, and\r\nexert themselves upon despair, how much more ought we, who are to win a\r\ncontinent by the conquest, and have already an earnest of success?\r\n\r\nHaving, in the preceding part, made my remarks on the several matters\r\nwhich the speech contains, I shall now make my remarks on what it does\r\nnot contain.\r\n\r\nThere is not a syllable in its respecting alliances. Either the\r\ninjustice of Britain is too glaring, or her condition too desperate, or\r\nboth, for any neighboring power to come to her support. In the beginning\r\nof the contest, when she had only America to contend with, she hired\r\nassistance from Hesse, and other smaller states of Germany, and\r\nfor nearly three years did America, young, raw, undisciplined and\r\nunprovided, stand against the power of Britain, aided by twenty thousand\r\nforeign troops, and made a complete conquest of one entire army. The\r\nremembrance of those things ought to inspire us with confidence and\r\ngreatness of mind, and carry us through every remaining difficulty with\r\ncontent and cheerfulness. What are the little sufferings of the present\r\nday, compared with the hardships that are past? There was a time, when\r\nwe had neither house nor home in safety; when every hour was the hour of\r\nalarm and danger; when the mind, tortured with anxiety, knew no repose,\r\nand every thing, but hope and fortitude, was bidding us farewell.\r\n\r\nIt is of use to look back upon these things; to call to mind the times\r\nof trouble and the scenes of complicated anguish that are past and gone.\r\nThen every expense was cheap, compared with the dread of conquest and\r\nthe misery of submission. We did not stand debating upon trifles, or\r\ncontending about the necessary and unavoidable charges of defence. Every\r\none bore his lot of suffering, and looked forward to happier days, and\r\nscenes of rest.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the greatest dangers which any country can be exposed\r\nto, arises from a kind of trifling which sometimes steals upon the mind,\r\nwhen it supposes the danger past; and this unsafe situation marks at\r\nthis time the peculiar crisis of America. What would she once have given\r\nto have known that her condition at this day should be what it now is?\r\nAnd yet we do not seem to place a proper value upon it, nor vigorously\r\npursue the necessary measures to secure it. We know that we cannot be\r\ndefended, nor yet defend ourselves, without trouble and expense. We have\r\nno right to expect it; neither ought we to look for it. We are a people,\r\nwho, in our situation, differ from all the world. We form one common\r\nfloor of public good, and, whatever is our charge, it is paid for our\r\nown interest and upon our own account.\r\n\r\nMisfortune and experience have now taught us system and method; and the\r\narrangements for carrying on the war are reduced to rule and order. The\r\nquotas of the several states are ascertained, and I intend in a future\r\npublication to show what they are, and the necessity as well as the\r\nadvantages of vigorously providing for them.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I shall conclude this paper with an instance of\r\nBritish clemency, from Smollett's History of England, vol. xi., printed\r\nin London. It will serve to show how dismal the situation of a conquered\r\npeople is, and that the only security is an effectual defence.\r\n\r\nWe all know that the Stuart family and the house of Hanover opposed each\r\nother for the crown of England. The Stuart family stood first in the\r\nline of succession, but the other was the most successful.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1745, Charles, the son of the exiled king, landed in Scotland,\r\ncollected a small force, at no time exceeding five or six thousand\r\nmen, and made some attempts to re-establish his claim. The late Duke of\r\nCumberland, uncle to the present King of England, was sent against him,\r\nand on the 16th of April following, Charles was totally defeated at\r\nCulloden, in Scotland. Success and power are the only situations in\r\nwhich clemency can be shown, and those who are cruel, because they\r\nare victorious, can with the same facility act any other degenerate\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after the decisive action at Culloden, the Duke of\r\nCumberland took possession of Inverness; where six and thirty deserters,\r\nconvicted by a court martial, were ordered to be executed: then he\r\ndetached several parties to ravage the country. One of these apprehended\r\nThe Lady Mackintosh, who was sent prisoner to Inverness, plundered her\r\nhouse, and drove away her cattle, though her husband was actually in the\r\nservice of the government. The castle of Lord Lovat was destroyed.\r\nThe French prisoners were sent to Carlisle and Penrith: Kilmarnock,\r\nBalmerino, Cromartie, and his son, The Lord Macleod, were conveyed by\r\nsea to London; and those of an inferior rank were confined in different\r\nprisons. The Marquis of Tullibardine, together with a brother of the\r\nEarl of Dunmore, and Murray, the pretender's secretary, were seized and\r\ntransported to the Tower of London, to which the Earl of Traquaire\r\nhad been committed on suspicion; and the eldest son of Lord Lovat was\r\nimprisoned in the castle of Edinburgh. In a word, all the jails in\r\nGreat Britain, from the capital, northwards, were filled with those\r\nunfortunate captives; and great numbers of them were crowded together in\r\nthe holds of ships, where they perished in the most deplorable manner,\r\nfor want of air and exercise. Some rebel chiefs escaped in two French\r\nfrigates that arrived on the coast of Lochaber about the end of April,\r\nand engaged three vessels belonging to his Britannic majesty, which\r\nthey obliged to retire. Others embarked on board a ship on the coast\r\nof Buchan, and were conveyed to Norway, from whence they travelled to\r\nSweden. In the month of May, the Duke of Cumberland advanced with the\r\narmy into the Highlands, as far as Fort Augustus, where he encamped; and\r\nsent off detachments on all hands, to hunt down the fugitives, and\r\nlay waste the country with fire and sword. The castles of Glengary and\r\nLochiel were plundered and burned; every house, hut, or habitation,\r\nmet with the same fate, without distinction; and all the cattle and\r\nprovision were carried off; the men were either shot upon the mountains,\r\nlike wild beasts, or put to death in cold blood, without form of trial;\r\nthe women, after having seen their husbands and fathers murdered, were\r\nsubjected to brutal violation, and then turned out naked, with their\r\nchildren, to starve on the barren heaths. One whole family was enclosed\r\nin a barn, and consumed to ashes. Those ministers of vengeance were so\r\nalert in the execution of their office, that in a few days there was\r\nneither house, cottage, man, nor beast, to be seen within the compass of\r\nfifty miles; all was ruin, silence, and desolation.\"\r\n\r\nI have here presented the reader with one of the most shocking instances\r\nof cruelty ever practised, and I leave it, to rest on his mind, that he\r\nmay be fully impressed with a sense of the destruction he has escaped,\r\nin case Britain had conquered America; and likewise, that he may see\r\nand feel the necessity, as well for his own personal safety, as for the\r\nhonor, the interest, and happiness of the whole community, to omit or\r\ndelay no one preparation necessary to secure the ground which we so\r\nhappily stand upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n          On the expenses, arrangements and disbursements for\r\n           carrying on the war, and finishing it with honor\r\n                            and advantage\r\n\r\nWHEN any necessity or occasion has pointed out the convenience of\r\naddressing the public, I have never made it a consideration whether the\r\nsubject was popular or unpopular, but whether it was right or wrong; for\r\nthat which is right will become popular, and that which is wrong, though\r\nby mistake it may obtain the cry or fashion of the day, will soon lose\r\nthe power of delusion, and sink into disesteem.\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of this happened in the case of Silas Deane; and\r\nI mention this circumstance with the greater ease, because the poison\r\nof his hypocrisy spread over the whole country, and every man, almost\r\nwithout exception, thought me wrong in opposing him. The best friends\r\nI then had, except Mr. [Henry] Laurens, stood at a distance, and this\r\ntribute, which is due to his constancy, I pay to him with respect, and\r\nthat the readier, because he is not here to hear it. If it reaches him\r\nin his imprisonment, it will afford him an agreeable reflection.\r\n\r\n\"As he rose like a rocket, he would fall like a stick,\" is a metaphor\r\nwhich I applied to Mr. Deane, in the first piece which I published\r\nrespecting him, and he has exactly fulfilled the description. The credit\r\nhe so unjustly obtained from the public, he lost in almost as short a\r\ntime. The delusion perished as it fell, and he soon saw himself stripped\r\nof popular support. His more intimate acquaintances began to doubt, and\r\nto desert him long before he left America, and at his departure, he saw\r\nhimself the object of general suspicion. When he arrived in France,\r\nhe endeavored to effect by treason what he had failed to accomplish by\r\nfraud. His plans, schemes and projects, together with his expectation of\r\nbeing sent to Holland to negotiate a loan of money, had all miscarried.\r\nHe then began traducing and accusing America of every crime, which could\r\ninjure her reputation. \"That she was a ruined country; that she only\r\nmeant to make a tool of France, to get what money she could out of her,\r\nand then to leave her and accommodate with Britain.\" Of all which and\r\nmuch more, Colonel Laurens and myself, when in France, informed Dr.\r\nFranklin, who had not before heard of it. And to complete the character\r\nof traitor, he has, by letters to his country since, some of which, in\r\nhis own handwriting, are now in the possession of Congress, used every\r\nexpression and argument in his power, to injure the reputation of\r\nFrance, and to advise America to renounce her alliance, and surrender up\r\nher independence.* Thus in France he abuses America, and in his letters\r\nto America he abuses France; and is endeavoring to create disunion\r\nbetween two countries, by the same arts of double-dealing by which he\r\ncaused dissensions among the commissioners in Paris, and distractions in\r\nAmerica. But his life has been fraud, and his character has been that of\r\na plodding, plotting, cringing mercenary, capable of any disguise that\r\nsuited his purpose. His final detection has very happily cleared up\r\nthose mistakes, and removed that uneasiness, which his unprincipled\r\nconduct occasioned. Every one now sees him in the same light; for\r\ntowards friends or enemies he acted with the same deception and\r\ninjustice, and his name, like that of Arnold, ought now to be forgotten\r\namong us. As this is the first time that I have mentioned him since my\r\nreturn from France, it is my intention that it shall be the last. From\r\nthis digression, which for several reasons I thought necessary to give,\r\nI now proceed to the purport of my address.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Mr. William Marshall, of this city [Philadelphia], formerly a\r\npilot, who had been taken at sea and carried to England, and got from\r\nthence to France, brought over letters from Mr. Deane to America, one of\r\nwhich was directed to \"Robert Morris, Esq.\" Mr. Morris sent it unopened\r\nto Congress, and advised Mr. Marshall to deliver the others there, which\r\nhe did. The letters were of the same purport with those which have been\r\nalready published under the signature of S. Deane, to which they had\r\nfrequent reference.\r\n\r\nI consider the war of America against Britain as the country's war,\r\nthe public's war, or the war of the people in their own behalf, for\r\nthe security of their natural rights, and the protection of their own\r\nproperty. It is not the war of Congress, the war of the assemblies, or\r\nthe war of government in any line whatever. The country first, by\r\nmutual compact, resolved to defend their rights and maintain their\r\nindependence, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes; they elected\r\ntheir representatives, by whom they appointed their members of Congress,\r\nand said, act you for us, and we will support you. This is the\r\ntrue ground and principle of the war on the part of America, and,\r\nconsequently, there remains nothing to do, but for every one to fulfil\r\nhis obligation.\r\n\r\nIt was next to impossible that a new country, engaged in a new\r\nundertaking, could set off systematically right at first. She saw not\r\nthe extent of the struggle that she was involved in, neither could she\r\navoid the beginning. She supposed every step that she took, and every\r\nresolution which she formed, would bring her enemy to reason and close\r\nthe contest. Those failing, she was forced into new measures; and these,\r\nlike the former, being fitted to her expectations, and failing in their\r\nturn, left her continually unprovided, and without system. The\r\nenemy, likewise, was induced to prosecute the war, from the temporary\r\nexpedients we adopted for carrying it on. We were continually expecting\r\nto see their credit exhausted, and they were looking to see our currency\r\nfail; and thus, between their watching us, and we them, the hopes of\r\nboth have been deceived, and the childishness of the expectation has\r\nserved to increase the expense.\r\n\r\nYet who, through this wilderness of error, has been to blame? Where is\r\nthe man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his? They were the\r\nnatural, unavoidable errors of the day. They were the errors of a whole\r\ncountry, which nothing but experience could detect and time remove.\r\nNeither could the circumstances of America admit of system, till either\r\nthe paper currency was fixed or laid aside. No calculation of a finance\r\ncould be made on a medium failing without reason, and fluctuating\r\nwithout rule.\r\n\r\nBut there is one error which might have been prevented and was not; and\r\nas it is not my custom to flatter, but to serve mankind, I will speak it\r\nfreely. It certainly was the duty of every assembly on the continent to\r\nhave known, at all times, what was the condition of its treasury, and\r\nto have ascertained at every period of depreciation, how much the real\r\nworth of the taxes fell short of their nominal value. This knowledge,\r\nwhich might have been easily gained, in the time of it, would have\r\nenabled them to have kept their constituents well informed, and this is\r\none of the greatest duties of representation. They ought to have studied\r\nand calculated the expenses of the war, the quota of each state, and\r\nthe consequent proportion that would fall on each man's property for\r\nhis defence; and this must have easily shown to them, that a tax of one\r\nhundred pounds could not be paid by a bushel of apples or an hundred of\r\nflour, which was often the case two or three years ago. But instead of\r\nthis, which would have been plain and upright dealing, the little line\r\nof temporary popularity, the feather of an hour's duration, was too much\r\npursued; and in this involved condition of things, every state, for the\r\nwant of a little thinking, or a little information, supposed that it\r\nsupported the whole expenses of the war, when in fact it fell, by the\r\ntime the tax was levied and collected, above three-fourths short of its\r\nown quota.\r\n\r\nImpressed with a sense of the danger to which the country was exposed by\r\nthis lax method of doing business, and the prevailing errors of the day,\r\nI published, last October was a twelvemonth, the Crisis Extraordinary,\r\non the revenues of America, and the yearly expense of carrying on\r\nthe war. My estimation of the latter, together with the civil list of\r\nCongress, and the civil list of the several states, was two million\r\npounds sterling, which is very nearly nine millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nSince that time, Congress have gone into a calculation, and have\r\nestimated the expenses of the War Department and the civil list of\r\nCongress (exclusive of the civil list of the several governments) at\r\neight millions of dollars; and as the remaining million will be\r\nfully sufficient for the civil list of the several states, the two\r\ncalculations are exceedingly near each other.\r\n\r\nThe sum of eight millions of dollars have called upon the states to\r\nfurnish, and their quotas are as follows, which I shall preface with the\r\nresolution itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             \"By the United States in Congress assembled.\r\n\r\n                          \"October 30, 1781.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the respective states be called upon to furnish the\r\ntreasury of the United States with their quotas of eight millions of\r\ndollars, for the War Department and civil list for the ensuing year, to\r\nbe paid quarterly, in equal proportions, the first payment to be made on\r\nthe first day of April next.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a committee, consisting of a member from each state, be\r\nappointed to apportion to the several states the quota of the above sum.\r\n\r\n\"November 2d. The committee appointed to ascertain the proportions of\r\nthe several states of the monies to be raised for the expenses of the\r\nensuing year, report the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"That the sum of eight millions of dollars, as required to be raised by\r\nthe resolutions of the 30th of October last, be paid by the states in\r\nthe following proportion:\r\n\r\n               New Hampshire....... $  373,598\r\n               Massachusetts.......  1,307,596\r\n               Rhode Island........    216,684\r\n               Connecticut.........    747,196\r\n               New York............    373,598\r\n               New Jersey..........    485,679\r\n               Pennsylvania........  1,120,794\r\n               Delaware............    112,085\r\n               Maryland............    933,996\r\n               Virginia............  1,307,594\r\n               North Carolina......    622,677\r\n               South Carolina......    373,598\r\n               Georgia.............     24,905\r\n\r\n                                    $8,000,000\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That it be recommended to the several states, to lay taxes\r\nfor raising their quotas of money for the United States, separate from\r\nthose laid for their own particular use.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn these resolutions I shall offer several remarks.\r\n\r\n   1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country.\r\n   2d, On the several quotas, and the nature of a union. And,\r\n   3d, On the manner of collection and expenditure.\r\n\r\n1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country. As I know my\r\nown calculation is as low as possible, and as the sum called for by\r\ncongress, according to their calculation, agrees very nearly therewith,\r\nI am sensible it cannot possibly be lower. Neither can it be done for\r\nthat, unless there is ready money to go to market with; and even in that\r\ncase, it is only by the utmost management and economy that it can be\r\nmade to do.\r\n\r\nBy the accounts which were laid before the British Parliament last\r\nspring, it appeared that the charge of only subsisting, that is, feeding\r\ntheir army in America, cost annually four million pounds sterling, which\r\nis very nearly eighteen millions of dollars. Now if, for eight millions,\r\nwe can feed, clothe, arm, provide for, and pay an army sufficient for\r\nour defence, the very comparison shows that the money must be well laid\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt may be of some use, either in debate or conversation, to attend to\r\nthe progress of the expenses of an army, because it will enable us to\r\nsee on what part any deficiency will fall.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is, to feed them and prepare for the sick.\r\n\r\n  _Second_, to clothe them.\r\n  _Third_, to arm and furnish them.\r\n  _Fourth_, to provide means for removing them from place to place. And,\r\n  _Fifth_, to pay them.\r\n\r\nThe first and second are absolutely necessary to them as men. The third\r\nand fourth are equally as necessary to them as an army. And the fifth is\r\ntheir just due. Now if the sum which shall be raised should fall short,\r\neither by the several acts of the states for raising it, or by the\r\nmanner of collecting it, the deficiency will fall on the fifth head, the\r\nsoldiers' pay, which would be defrauding them, and eternally disgracing\r\nourselves. It would be a blot on the councils, the country, and the\r\nrevolution of America, and a man would hereafter be ashamed to own that\r\nhe had any hand in it.\r\n\r\nBut if the deficiency should be still shorter, it would next fall on the\r\nfourth head, the means of removing the army from place to place; and, in\r\nthis case, the army must either stand still where it can be of no use,\r\nor seize on horses, carts, wagons, or any means of transportation which\r\nit can lay hold of; and in this instance the country suffers. In short,\r\nevery attempt to do a thing for less than it can he done for, is sure to\r\nbecome at last both a loss and a dishonor.\r\n\r\nBut the country cannot bear it, say some. This has been the most\r\nexpensive doctrine that ever was held out, and cost America millions\r\nof money for nothing. Can the country bear to be overrun, ravaged,\r\nand ruined by an enemy? This will immediately follow where defence is\r\nwanting, and defence will ever be wanting, where sufficient revenues\r\nare not provided. But this is only one part of the folly. The second is,\r\nthat when the danger comes, invited in part by our not preparing against\r\nit, we have been obliged, in a number of instances, to expend double the\r\nsums to do that which at first might have been done for half the money.\r\nBut this is not all. A third mischief has been, that grain of all sorts,\r\nflour, beef fodder, horses, carts, wagons, or whatever was absolutely or\r\nimmediately wanted, have been taken without pay. Now, I ask, why was all\r\nthis done, but from that extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that\r\nthe country could not bear it? That is, that she could not bear, in the\r\nfirst instance, that which would have saved her twice as much at last;\r\nor, in proverbial language, that she could not bear to pay a penny to\r\nsave a pound; the consequence of which has been, that she has paid a\r\npound for a penny. Why are there so many unpaid certificates in almost\r\nevery man's hands, but from the parsimony of not providing sufficient\r\nrevenues? Besides, the doctrine contradicts itself; because, if the\r\nwhole country cannot bear it, how is it possible that a part should?\r\nAnd yet this has been the case: for those things have been had; and they\r\nmust be had; but the misfortune is, that they have been obtained in\r\na very unequal manner, and upon expensive credit, whereas, with ready\r\nmoney, they might have been purchased for half the price, and nobody\r\ndistressed.\r\n\r\nBut there is another thought which ought to strike us, which is, how is\r\nthe army to bear the want of food, clothing and other necessaries? The\r\nman who is at home, can turn himself a thousand ways, and find as many\r\nmeans of ease, convenience or relief: but a soldier's life admits of\r\nnone of those: their wants cannot be supplied from themselves: for an\r\narmy, though it is the defence of a state, is at the same time the child\r\nof a country, or must be provided for in every thing.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the doctrine is false. There are not three millions of\r\npeople in any part of the universe, who live so well, or have such a\r\nfund of ability, as in America. The income of a common laborer, who is\r\nindustrious, is equal to that of the generality of tradesmen in England.\r\nIn the mercantile line, I have not heard of one who could be said to be\r\na bankrupt since the war began, and in England they have been without\r\nnumber. In America almost every farmer lives on his own lands, and in\r\nEngland not one in a hundred does. In short, it seems as if the poverty\r\nof that country had made them furious, and they were determined to risk\r\nall to recover all.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding those advantages on the part of America, true it\r\nis, that had it not been for the operation of taxes for our necessary\r\ndefence, we had sunk into a state of sloth and poverty: for there was\r\nmore wealth lost by neglecting to till the earth in the years 1776,\r\n'77, and '78, than the quota of taxes amounts to. That which is lost by\r\nneglect of this kind, is lost for ever: whereas that which is paid, and\r\ncontinues in the country, returns to us again; and at the same time that\r\nit provides us with defence, it operates not only as a spur, but as a\r\npremium to our industry.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to the second head, viz., on the several quotas, and\r\nthe nature of a union.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when America had no other bond of union, than that of\r\ncommon interest and affection. The whole country flew to the relief of\r\nBoston, and, making her cause, their own, participated in her cares and\r\nadministered to her wants. The fate of war, since that day, has carried\r\nthe calamity in a ten-fold proportion to the southward; but in the mean\r\ntime the union has been strengthened by a legal compact of the states,\r\njointly and severally ratified, and that which before was choice, or the\r\nduty of affection, is now likewise the duty of legal obligation.\r\n\r\nThe union of America is the foundation-stone of her independence;\r\nthe rock on which it is built; and is something so sacred in her\r\nconstitution, that we ought to watch every word we speak, and every\r\nthought we think, that we injure it not, even by mistake. When a\r\nmultitude, extended, or rather scattered, over a continent in the manner\r\nwe were, mutually agree to form one common centre whereon the whole\r\nshall move to accomplish a particular purpose, all parts must act\r\ntogether and alike, or act not at all, and a stoppage in any one is a\r\nstoppage of the whole, at least for a time.\r\n\r\nThus the several states have sent representatives to assemble together\r\nin Congress, and they have empowered that body, which thus becomes their\r\ncentre, and are no other than themselves in representation, to conduct\r\nand manage the war, while their constituents at home attend to the\r\ndomestic cares of the country, their internal legislation, their farms,\r\nprofessions or employments, for it is only by reducing complicated\r\nthings to method and orderly connection that they can be understood\r\nwith advantage, or pursued with success. Congress, by virtue of this\r\ndelegation, estimates the expense, and apportions it out to the several\r\nparts of the empire according to their several abilities; and here the\r\ndebate must end, because each state has already had its voice, and the\r\nmatter has undergone its whole portion of argument, and can no more be\r\naltered by any particular state, than a law of any state, after it has\r\npassed, can be altered by any individual. For with respect to those\r\nthings which immediately concern the union, and for which the union was\r\npurposely established, and is intended to secure, each state is to the\r\nUnited States what each individual is to the state he lives in. And\r\nit is on this grand point, this movement upon one centre, that our\r\nexistence as a nation, our happiness as a people, and our safety as\r\nindividuals, depend.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that some state or other may be somewhat over or under\r\nrated, but this cannot be much. The experience which has been had upon\r\nthe matter, has nearly ascertained their several abilities. But even\r\nin this case, it can only admit of an appeal to the United States, but\r\ncannot authorise any state to make the alteration itself, any more than\r\nour internal government can admit an individual to do so in the case of\r\nan act of assembly; for if one state can do it, then may another do the\r\nsame, and the instant this is done the whole is undone.\r\n\r\nNeither is it supposable that any single state can be a judge of all the\r\ncomparative reasons which may influence the collective body in arranging\r\nthe quotas of the continent. The circumstances of the several states are\r\nfrequently varying, occasioned by the accidents of war and commerce, and\r\nit will often fall upon some to help others, rather beyond what their\r\nexact proportion at another time might be; but even this assistance is\r\nas naturally and politically included in the idea of a union as that of\r\nany particular assigned proportion; because we know not whose turn\r\nit may be next to want assistance, for which reason that state is the\r\nwisest which sets the best example.\r\n\r\nThough in matters of bounden duty and reciprocal affection, it is rather\r\na degeneracy from the honesty and ardor of the heart to admit any thing\r\nselfish to partake in the government of our conduct, yet in cases where\r\nour duty, our affections, and our interest all coincide, it may be of\r\nsome use to observe their union. The United States will become heir to\r\nan extensive quantity of vacant land, and their several titles to\r\nshares and quotas thereof, will naturally be adjusted according to their\r\nrelative quotas, during the war, exclusive of that inability which may\r\nunfortunately arise to any state by the enemy's holding possession of\r\na part; but as this is a cold matter of interest, I pass it by,\r\nand proceed to my third head, viz., on the manner of collection and\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nIt has been our error, as well as our misfortune, to blend the affairs\r\nof each state, especially in money matters, with those of the United\r\nStates; whereas it is our case, convenience and interest, to keep them\r\nseparate. The expenses of the United States for carrying on the war, and\r\nthe expenses of each state for its own domestic government, are distinct\r\nthings, and to involve them is a source of perplexity and a cloak for\r\nfraud. I love method, because I see and am convinced of its beauty and\r\nadvantage. It is that which makes all business easy and understood, and\r\nwithout which, everything becomes embarrassed and difficult.\r\n\r\nThere are certain powers which the people of each state have delegated\r\nto their legislative and executive bodies, and there are other powers\r\nwhich the people of every state have delegated to Congress, among\r\nwhich is that of conducting the war, and, consequently, of managing the\r\nexpenses attending it; for how else can that be managed, which concerns\r\nevery state, but by a delegation from each? When a state has furnished\r\nits quota, it has an undoubted right to know how it has been applied,\r\nand it is as much the duty of Congress to inform the state of the one,\r\nas it is the duty of the state to provide the other.\r\n\r\nIn the resolution of Congress already recited, it is recommended to the\r\nseveral states to lay taxes for raising their quotas of money for the\r\nUnited States, separate from those laid for their own particular use.\r\n\r\nThis is a most necessary point to be observed, and the distinction\r\nshould follow all the way through. They should be levied, paid and\r\ncollected, separately, and kept separate in every instance. Neither have\r\nthe civil officers of any state, nor the government of that state, the\r\nleast right to touch that money which the people pay for the support of\r\ntheir army and the war, any more than Congress has to touch that which\r\neach state raises for its own use.\r\n\r\nThis distinction will naturally be followed by another. It will occasion\r\nevery state to examine nicely into the expenses of its civil list, and\r\nto regulate, reduce, and bring it into better order than it has hitherto\r\nbeen; because the money for that purpose must be raised apart, and\r\naccounted for to the public separately. But while the, monies of both\r\nwere blended, the necessary nicety was not observed, and the poor\r\nsoldier, who ought to have been the first, was the last who was thought\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAnother convenience will be, that the people, by paying the taxes\r\nseparately, will know what they are for; and will likewise know that\r\nthose which are for the defence of the country will cease with the war,\r\nor soon after. For although, as I have before observed, the war is their\r\nown, and for the support of their own rights and the protection of their\r\nown property, yet they have the same right to know, that they have\r\nto pay, and it is the want of not knowing that is often the cause of\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis regulation of keeping the taxes separate has given rise to a\r\nregulation in the office of finance, by which it is directed:\r\n\r\n\"That the receivers shall, at the end of every month, make out an exact\r\naccount of the monies received by them respectively, during such month,\r\nspecifying therein the names of the persons from whom the same shall\r\nhave been received, the dates and the sums; which account they shall\r\nrespectively cause to be published in one of the newspapers of the\r\nstate; to the end that every citizen may know how much of the monies\r\ncollected from him, in taxes, is transmitted to the treasury of the\r\nUnited States for the support of the war; and also, that it may be known\r\nwhat monies have been at the order of the superintendent of finance. It\r\nbeing proper and necessary, that, in a free country, the people should\r\nbe as fully informed of the administration of their affairs as the\r\nnature of things will admit.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an agreeable thing to see a spirit of order and economy taking\r\nplace, after such a series of errors and difficulties. A government or\r\nan administration, who means and acts honestly, has nothing to fear, and\r\nconsequently has nothing to conceal; and it would be of use if a monthly\r\nor quarterly account was to be published, as well of the expenditures\r\nas of the receipts. Eight millions of dollars must be husbanded with an\r\nexceeding deal of care to make it do, and, therefore, as the management\r\nmust be reputable, the publication would be serviceable.\r\n\r\nI have heard of petitions which have been presented to the assembly of\r\nthis state (and probably the same may have happened in other states)\r\npraying to have the taxes lowered. Now the only way to keep taxes low\r\nis, for the United States to have ready money to go to market with: and\r\nthough the taxes to be raised for the present year will fall heavy,\r\nand there will naturally be some difficulty in paying them, yet the\r\ndifficulty, in proportion as money spreads about the country, will every\r\nday grow less, and in the end we shall save some millions of dollars by\r\nit. We see what a bitter, revengeful enemy we have to deal with, and\r\nany expense is cheap compared to their merciless paw. We have seen the\r\nunfortunate Carolineans hunted like partridges on the mountains, and it\r\nis only by providing means for our defence, that we shall be kept from\r\nthe same condition. When we think or talk about taxes, we ought to\r\nrecollect that we lie down in peace and sleep in safety; that we\r\ncan follow our farms or stores or other occupations, in prosperous\r\ntranquillity; and that these inestimable blessings are procured to us\r\nby the taxes that we pay. In this view, our taxes are properly our\r\ninsurance money; they are what we pay to be made safe, and, in strict\r\npolicy, are the best money we can lay out.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to offer some remarks on the impost law of five per\r\ncent. recommended by Congress, and to be established as a fund for the\r\npayment of the loan-office certificates, and other debts of the United\r\nStates; but I have already extended my piece beyond my intention. And\r\nas this fund will make our system of finance complete, and is strictly\r\njust, and consequently requires nothing but honesty to do it, there\r\nneeds but little to be said upon it.\r\n\r\n                                              COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, March 5, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS. XI. ON THE PRESENT STATE OF NEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the arrival of two, if not three packets in quick succession, at\r\nNew York, from England, a variety of unconnected news has circulated\r\nthrough the country, and afforded as great a variety of speculation.\r\n\r\nThat something is the matter in the cabinet and councils of our enemies,\r\non the other side of the water, is certain--that they have run their\r\nlength of madness, and are under the necessity of changing their\r\nmeasures may easily be seen into; but to what this change of measures\r\nmay amount, or how far it may correspond with our interest, happiness\r\nand duty, is yet uncertain; and from what we have hitherto experienced,\r\nwe have too much reason to suspect them in every thing. I do not address\r\nthis publication so much to the people of America as to the British\r\nministry, whoever they may be, for if it is their intention to promote\r\nany kind of negotiation, it is proper they should know beforehand, that\r\nthe United States have as much honor as bravery; and that they are no\r\nmore to be seduced from their alliance than their allegiance; that their\r\nline of politics is formed and not dependent, like that of their enemy,\r\non chance and accident. On our part, in order to know, at any time, what\r\nthe British government will do, we have only to find out what they ought\r\nnot to do, and this last will be their conduct. Forever changing and\r\nforever wrong; too distant from America to improve in circumstances, and\r\ntoo unwise to foresee them; scheming without principle, and executing\r\nwithout probability, their whole line of management has hitherto been\r\nblunder and baseness. Every campaign has added to their loss, and every\r\nyear to their disgrace; till unable to go on, and ashamed to go back,\r\ntheir politics have come to a halt, and all their fine prospects to a\r\nhalter.\r\n\r\nCould our affections forgive, or humanity forget the wounds of an\r\ninjured country--we might, under the influence of a momentary oblivion,\r\nstand still and laugh. But they are engraven where no amusement can\r\nconceal them, and of a kind for which there is no recompense. Can ye\r\nrestore to us the beloved dead? Can ye say to the grave, give up the\r\nmurdered? Can ye obliterate from our memories those who are no more?\r\nThink not then to tamper with our feelings by an insidious contrivance,\r\nnor suffocate our humanity by seducing us to dishonor.\r\n\r\nIn March 1780, I published part of the Crisis, No. VIII., in the\r\nnewspapers, but did not conclude it in the following papers, and the\r\nremainder has lain by me till the present day. There appeared about\r\nthat time some disposition in the British cabinet to cease the further\r\nprosecution of the war, and as I had formed my opinion that whenever\r\nsuch a design should take place, it would be accompanied by a\r\ndishonorable proposition to America, respecting France, I had suppressed\r\nthe remainder of that number, not to expose the baseness of any such\r\nproposition. But the arrival of the next news from England, declared her\r\ndetermination to go on with the war, and consequently as the political\r\nobject I had then in view was not become a subject, it was unnecessary\r\nin me to bring it forward, which is the reason it was never published.\r\nThe matter which I allude to in the unpublished part, I shall now make a\r\nquotation of, and apply it as the more enlarged state of things, at this\r\nday, shall make convenient or necessary. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"By the speeches which have appeared from the British Parliament, it is\r\neasy to perceive to what impolitic and imprudent excesses their passions\r\nand prejudices have, in every instance, carried them during the present\r\nwar. Provoked at the upright and honorable treaty between America and\r\nFrance, they imagined that nothing more was necessary to be done to\r\nprevent its final ratification, than to promise, through the agency of\r\ntheir commissioners (Carlisle, Eden, and Johnstone) a repeal of their\r\nonce offensive acts of Parliament. The vanity of the conceit, was as\r\nunpardonable as the experiment was impolitic. And so convinced am I of\r\ntheir wrong ideas of America, that I shall not wonder, if, in their last\r\nstage of political frenzy, they propose to her to break her alliance\r\nwith France, and enter into one with them. Such a proposition, should\r\nit ever be made, and it has been already more than once hinted at in\r\nParliament, would discover such a disposition to perfidiousness, and\r\nsuch disregard of honor and morals, as would add the finishing vice to\r\nnational corruption.--I do not mention this to put America on the watch,\r\nbut to put England on her guard, that she do not, in the looseness of\r\nher heart, envelop in disgrace every fragment of reputation.\"--Thus far\r\nthe quotation.\r\n\r\nBy the complection of some part of the news which has transpired through\r\nthe New York papers, it seems probable that this insidious era in the\r\nBritish politics is beginning to make its appearance. I wish it may\r\nnot; for that which is a disgrace to human nature, throws something of a\r\nshade over all the human character, and each individual feels his share\r\nof the wound that is given to the whole. The policy of Britain has ever\r\nbeen to divide America in some way or other. In the beginning of the\r\ndispute, she practised every art to prevent or destroy the union of the\r\nstates, well knowing that could she once get them to stand singly, she\r\ncould conquer them unconditionally. Failing in this project in America,\r\nshe renewed it in Europe; and, after the alliance had taken place, she\r\nmade secret offers to France to induce her to give up America; and what\r\nis still more extraordinary, she at the same time made propositions to\r\nDr. Franklin, then in Paris, the very court to which she was secretly\r\napplying, to draw off America from France. But this is not all. On the\r\n14th of September, 1778, the British court, through their secretary,\r\nLord Weymouth, made application to the Marquis d'Almadovar, the Spanish\r\nambassador at London, to \"ask the mediation,\" for these were the words,\r\nof the court of Spain, for the purpose of negotiating a peace with\r\nFrance, leaving America (as I shall hereafter show) out of the question.\r\nSpain readily offered her mediation, and likewise the city of Madrid as\r\nthe place of conference, but withal, proposed, that the United States of\r\nAmerica should be invited to the treaty, and considered as independent\r\nduring the time the business was negotiating. But this was not the\r\nview of England. She wanted to draw France from the war, that she might\r\nuninterruptedly pour out all her force and fury upon America; and being\r\ndisappointed in this plan, as well through the open and generous conduct\r\nof Spain, as the determination of France, she refused the mediation\r\nwhich she had solicited. I shall now give some extracts from the\r\njustifying memorial of the Spanish court, in which she has set the\r\nconduct and character of Britain, with respect to America, in a clear\r\nand striking point of light.\r\n\r\nThe memorial, speaking of the refusal of the British court to meet in\r\nconference with commissioners from the United States, who were to be\r\nconsidered as independent during the time of the conference, says,\r\n\r\n\"It is a thing very extraordinary and even ridiculous, that the court of\r\nLondon, who treats the colonies as independent, not only in acting, but\r\nof right, during the war, should have a repugnance to treat them as\r\nsuch only in acting during a truce, or suspension of hostilities.\r\nThe convention of Saratoga; the reputing General Burgoyne as a lawful\r\nprisoner, in order to suspend his trial; the exchange and liberation of\r\nother prisoners made from the colonies; the having named commissioners\r\nto go and supplicate the Americans, at their own doors, request peace of\r\nthem, and treat with them and the Congress: and, finally, by a thousand\r\nother acts of this sort, authorized by the court of London, which have\r\nbeen, and are true signs of the acknowledgment of their independence.\r\n\r\n\"In aggravation of all the foregoing, at the same time the British\r\ncabinet answered the King of Spain in the terms already mentioned, they\r\nwere insinuating themselves at the court of France by means of secret\r\nemissaries, and making very great offers to her, to abandon the colonies\r\nand make peace with England. But there is yet more; for at this same\r\ntime the English ministry were treating, by means of another certain\r\nemissary, with Dr. Franklin, minister plenipotentiary from the colonies,\r\nresiding at Paris, to whom they made various proposals to disunite them\r\nfrom France, and accommodate matters with England.\r\n\r\n\"From what has been observed, it evidently follows, that the whole\r\nof the British politics was, to disunite the two courts of Paris and\r\nMadrid, by means of the suggestions and offers which she separately\r\nmade to them; and also to separate the colonies from their treaties and\r\nengagements entered into with France, and induce them to arm against the\r\nhouse of Bourbon, or more probably to oppress them when they found,\r\nfrom breaking their engagements, that they stood alone and without\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"This, therefore, is the net they laid for the American states; that is\r\nto say, to tempt them with flattering and very magnificent promises to\r\ncome to an accommodation with them, exclusive of any intervention of\r\nSpain or France, that the British ministry might always remain the\r\narbiters of the fate of the colonies. But the Catholic king (the King\r\nof Spain) faithful on the one part of the engagements which bind him\r\nto the Most Christian king (the King of France) his nephew; just and\r\nupright on the other, to his own subjects, whom he ought to protect\r\nand guard against so many insults; and finally, full of humanity and\r\ncompassion for the Americans and other individuals who suffer in the\r\npresent war; he is determined to pursue and prosecute it, and to make\r\nall the efforts in his power, until he can obtain a solid and permanent\r\npeace, with full and satisfactory securities that it shall be observed.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the memorial; a translation of which into English, may be seen\r\nin full, under the head of State Papers, in the Annual Register, for\r\n1779.\r\n\r\nThe extracts I have here given, serve to show the various endeavors\r\nand contrivances of the enemy, to draw France from her connection with\r\nAmerica, and to prevail on her to make a separate peace with England,\r\nleaving America totally out of the question, and at the mercy of a\r\nmerciless, unprincipled enemy. The opinion, likewise, which Spain\r\nhas formed of the British cabinet's character for meanness and\r\nperfidiousness, is so exactly the opinion of America respecting it,\r\nthat the memorial, in this instance, contains our own statements and\r\nlanguage; for people, however remote, who think alike, will unavoidably\r\nspeak alike.\r\n\r\nThus we see the insidious use which Britain endeavored to make of the\r\npropositions of peace under the mediation of Spain. I shall now proceed\r\nto the second proposition under the mediation of the Emperor of Germany\r\nand the Empress of Russia; the general outline of which was, that a\r\ncongress of the several powers at war should meet at Vienna, in 1781,\r\nto settle preliminaries of peace. I could wish myself at liberty to make\r\nuse of all the information which I am possessed of on this subject, but\r\nas there is a delicacy in the matter, I do not conceive it prudent, at\r\nleast at present, to make references and quotations in the same manner\r\nas I have done with respect to the mediation of Spain, who published the\r\nwhole proceedings herself; and therefore, what comes from me, on this\r\npart of the business, must rest on my own credit with the public,\r\nassuring them, that when the whole proceedings, relative to the proposed\r\nCongress of Vienna shall appear, they will find my account not only\r\ntrue, but studiously moderate.\r\n\r\nWe know at the time this mediation was on the carpet, the expectation of\r\nthe British king and ministry ran high with respect to the conquest of\r\nAmerica. The English packet which was taken with the mail on board,\r\nand carried into l'Orient, in France, contained letters from Lord G.\r\nGermaine to Sir Henry Clinton, which expressed in the fullest terms the\r\nministerial idea of a total conquest. Copies of those letters were sent\r\nto congress and published in the newspapers of last year. Colonel\r\n[John] Laurens brought over the originals, some of which, signed in the\r\nhandwriting of the then secretary, Germaine, are now in my possession.\r\n\r\nFilled with these high ideas, nothing could be more insolent towards\r\nAmerica than the language of the British court on the proposed\r\nmediation. A peace with France and Spain she anxiously solicited; but\r\nAmerica, as before, was to be left to her mercy, neither would she hear\r\nany proposition for admitting an agent from the United States into the\r\ncongress of Vienna.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, France, with an open, noble and manly determination,\r\nand a fidelity of a good ally, would hear no proposition for a separate\r\npeace, nor even meet in congress at Vienna, without an agent from\r\nAmerica: and likewise that the independent character of the United\r\nStates, represented by the agent, should be fully and unequivocally\r\ndefined and settled before any conference should be entered on. The\r\nreasoning of the court of France on the several propositions of the\r\ntwo imperial courts, which relate to us, is rather in the style of an\r\nAmerican than an ally, and she advocated the cause of America as if she\r\nhad been America herself.--Thus the second mediation, like the first,\r\nproved ineffectual. But since that time, a reverse of fortune has\r\novertaken the British arms, and all their high expectations are dashed\r\nto the ground. The noble exertions to the southward under General\r\n[Nathaniel] Greene; the successful operations of the allied arms in the\r\nChesapeake; the loss of most of their islands in the West Indies, and\r\nMinorca in the Mediterranean; the persevering spirit of Spain against\r\nGibraltar; the expected capture of Jamaica; the failure of making a\r\nseparate peace with Holland, and the expense of an hundred millions\r\nsterling, by which all these fine losses were obtained, have read them\r\na loud lesson of disgraceful misfortune and necessity has called on them\r\nto change their ground.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of confusion and despair, their present councils have\r\nno fixed character. It is now the hurricane months of British politics.\r\nEvery day seems to have a storm of its own, and they are scudding under\r\nthe bare poles of hope. Beaten, but not humble; condemned, but not\r\npenitent; they act like men trembling at fate and catching at a straw.\r\nFrom this convulsion, in the entrails of their politics, it is more than\r\nprobable, that the mountain groaning in labor, will bring forth a mouse,\r\nas to its size, and a monster in its make. They will try on America the\r\nsame insidious arts they tried on France and Spain.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes experience sensations to which language is not equal.\r\nThe conception is too bulky to be born alive, and in the torture of\r\nthinking, we stand dumb. Our feelings, imprisoned by their magnitude,\r\nfind no way out--and, in the struggle of expression, every finger tries\r\nto be a tongue. The machinery of the body seems too little for the mind,\r\nand we look about for helps to show our thoughts by. Such must be the\r\nsensation of America, whenever Britain, teeming with corruption, shall\r\npropose to her to sacrifice her faith.\r\n\r\nBut, exclusive of the wickedness, there is a personal offence contained\r\nin every such attempt. It is calling us villains: for no man asks the\r\nother to act the villain unless he believes him inclined to be one.\r\nNo man attempts to seduce the truly honest woman. It is the supposed\r\nlooseness of her mind that starts the thoughts of seduction, and he who\r\noffers it calls her a prostitute. Our pride is always hurt by the same\r\npropositions which offend our principles; for when we are shocked at the\r\ncrime, we are wounded by the suspicion of our compliance.\r\n\r\nCould I convey a thought that might serve to regulate the public mind,\r\nI would not make the interest of the alliance the basis of defending\r\nit. All the world are moved by interest, and it affords them nothing to\r\nboast of. But I would go a step higher, and defend it on the ground of\r\nhonor and principle. That our public affairs have flourished under the\r\nalliance--that it was wisely made, and has been nobly executed--that by\r\nits assistance we are enabled to preserve our country from conquest, and\r\nexpel those who sought our destruction--that it is our true interest to\r\nmaintain it unimpaired, and that while we do so no enemy can conquer\r\nus, are matters which experience has taught us, and the common good of\r\nourselves, abstracted from principles of faith and honor, would lead us\r\nto maintain the connection.\r\n\r\nBut over and above the mere letter of the alliance, we have been nobly\r\nand generously treated, and have had the same respect and attention paid\r\nto us, as if we had been an old established country. To oblige and\r\nbe obliged is fair work among mankind, and we want an opportunity of\r\nshowing to the world that we are a people sensible of kindness and\r\nworthy of confidence. Character is to us, in our present circumstances,\r\nof more importance than interest. We are a young nation, just stepping\r\nupon the stage of public life, and the eye of the world is upon us\r\nto see how we act. We have an enemy who is watching to destroy our\r\nreputation, and who will go any length to gain some evidence against\r\nus, that may serve to render our conduct suspected, and our character\r\nodious; because, could she accomplish this, wicked as it is, the world\r\nwould withdraw from us, as from a people not to be trusted, and our task\r\nwould then become difficult. There is nothing which sets the character\r\nof a nation in a higher or lower light with others, than the faithfully\r\nfulfilling, or perfidiously breaking, of treaties. They are things not\r\nto be tampered with: and should Britain, which seems very probable,\r\npropose to seduce America into such an act of baseness, it would\r\nmerit from her some mark of unusual detestation. It is one of those\r\nextraordinary instances in which we ought not to be contented with the\r\nbare negative of Congress, because it is an affront on the multitude as\r\nwell as on the government. It goes on the supposition that the public\r\nare not honest men, and that they may be managed by contrivance, though\r\nthey cannot be conquered by arms. But, let the world and Britain know,\r\nthat we are neither to be bought nor sold; that our mind is great and\r\nfixed; our prospect clear; and that we will support our character as\r\nfirmly as our independence.\r\n\r\nBut I will go still further; General Conway, who made the motion, in\r\nthe British Parliament, for discontinuing offensive war in America, is a\r\ngentleman of an amiable character. We have no personal quarrel with him.\r\nBut he feels not as we feel; he is not in our situation, and that alone,\r\nwithout any other explanation, is enough. The British Parliament suppose\r\nthey have many friends in America, and that, when all chance of conquest\r\nis over, they will be able to draw her from her alliance with France.\r\nNow, if I have any conception of the human heart, they will fail in this\r\nmore than in any thing that they have yet tried.\r\n\r\nThis part of the business is not a question of policy only, but of honor\r\nand honesty; and the proposition will have in it something so visibly\r\nlow and base, that their partisans, if they have any, will be ashamed of\r\nit. Men are often hurt by a mean action who are not startled at a wicked\r\none, and this will be such a confession of inability, such a declaration\r\nof servile thinking, that the scandal of it will ruin all their hopes.\r\n\r\nIn short, we have nothing to do but to go on with vigor and\r\ndetermination. The enemy is yet in our country. They hold New York,\r\nCharleston, and Savannah, and the very being in those places is an\r\noffence, and a part of offensive war, and until they can be driven from\r\nthem, or captured in them, it would be folly in us to listen to an idle\r\ntale. I take it for granted that the British ministry are sinking under\r\nthe impossibility of carrying on the war. Let them then come to a fair\r\nand open peace with France, Spain, Holland and America, in the manner\r\nthey ought to do; but until then, we can have nothing to say to them.\r\n\r\n                                     COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\n                    PHILADELPHIA, May 22, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A SUPERNUMERARY CRISIS\r\n\r\n                         TO SIR GUY CARLETON.\r\n\r\nIT is the nature of compassion to associate with misfortune; and I\r\naddress this to you in behalf even of an enemy, a captain in the British\r\nservice, now on his way to the headquarters of the American army, and\r\nunfortunately doomed to death for a crime not his own. A sentence so\r\nextraordinary, an execution so repugnant to every human sensation, ought\r\nnever to be told without the circumstances which produced it: and as the\r\ndestined victim is yet in existence, and in your hands rests his life or\r\ndeath, I shall briefly state the case, and the melancholy consequence.\r\n\r\nCaptain Huddy, of the Jersey militia, was attacked in a small fort on\r\nTom's River, by a party of refugees in the British pay and service, was\r\nmade prisoner, together with his company, carried to New York and lodged\r\nin the provost of that city: about three weeks after which, he was taken\r\nout of the provost down to the water-side, put into a boat, and brought\r\nagain upon the Jersey shore, and there, contrary to the practice of all\r\nnations but savages, was hung up on a tree, and left hanging till found\r\nby our people who took him down and buried him. The inhabitants of that\r\npart of the country where the murder was committed, sent a deputation\r\nto General Washington with a full and certified statement of the fact.\r\nStruck, as every human breast must be, with such brutish outrage, and\r\ndetermined both to punish and prevent it for the future, the General\r\nrepresented the case to General Clinton, who then commanded, and\r\ndemanded that the refugee officer who ordered and attended the\r\nexecution, and whose name is Lippencott, should be delivered up as\r\na murderer; and in case of refusal, that the person of some British\r\nofficer should suffer in his stead. The demand, though not refused, has\r\nnot been complied with; and the melancholy lot (not by selection, but by\r\ncasting lots) has fallen upon Captain Asgill, of the Guards, who, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, is on his way from Lancaster to camp, a\r\nmartyr to the general wickedness of the cause he engaged in, and the\r\ningratitude of those whom he served.\r\n\r\nThe first reflection which arises on this black business is, what sort\r\nof men must Englishmen be, and what sort of order and discipline do\r\nthey preserve in their army, when in the immediate place of their\r\nheadquarters, and under the eye and nose of their commander-in-chief,\r\na prisoner can be taken at pleasure from his confinement, and his death\r\nmade a matter of sport.\r\n\r\nThe history of the most savage Indians does not produce instances\r\nexactly of this kind. They, at least, have a formality in their\r\npunishments. With them it is the horridness of revenge, but with your\r\narmy it is a still greater crime, the horridness of diversion. The\r\nBritish generals who have succeeded each other, from the time of General\r\nGage to yourself, have all affected to speak in language that they have\r\nno right to. In their proclamations, their addresses, their letters\r\nto General Washington, and their supplications to Congress (for they\r\ndeserve no other name) they talk of British honor, British generosity,\r\nand British clemency, as if those things were matters of fact; whereas,\r\nwe whose eyes are open, who speak the same language with yourselves,\r\nmany of whom were born on the same spot with you, and who can no more\r\nbe mistaken in your words than in your actions, can declare to all the\r\nworld, that so far as our knowledge goes, there is not a more detestable\r\ncharacter, nor a meaner or more barbarous enemy, than the present\r\nBritish one. With us, you have forfeited all pretensions to reputation,\r\nand it is only by holding you like a wild beast, afraid of your keepers,\r\nthat you can be made manageable. But to return to the point in question.\r\n\r\nThough I can think no man innocent who has lent his hand to destroy\r\nthe country which he did not plant, and to ruin those that he could not\r\nenslave, yet, abstracted from all ideas of right and wrong on the\r\noriginal question, Captain Asgill, in the present case, is not the\r\nguilty man. The villain and the victim are here separated characters.\r\nYou hold the one and we the other. You disown, or affect to disown and\r\nreprobate the conduct of Lippincut, yet you give him a sanctuary; and by\r\nso doing you as effectually become the executioner of Asgill, as if you\r\nhad put the rope on his neck, and dismissed him from the world. Whatever\r\nyour feelings on this interesting occasion may be are best known to\r\nyourself. Within the grave of your own mind lies buried the fate of\r\nAsgill. He becomes the corpse of your will, or the survivor of your\r\njustice. Deliver up the one, and you save the other; withhold the one,\r\nand the other dies by your choice.\r\n\r\nOn our part the case is exceeding plain; an officer has been taken from\r\nhis confinement and murdered, and the murderer is within your lines.\r\nYour army has been guilty of a thousand instances of equal cruelty,\r\nbut they have been rendered equivocal, and sheltered from personal\r\ndetection. Here the crime is fixed; and is one of those extraordinary\r\ncases which can neither be denied nor palliated, and to which the custom\r\nof war does not apply; for it never could be supposed that such a brutal\r\noutrage would ever be committed. It is an original in the history\r\nof civilized barbarians, and is truly British. On your part you are\r\naccountable to us for the personal safety of the prisoners within your\r\nwalls. Here can be no mistake; they can neither be spies nor suspected\r\nas such; your security is not endangered, nor your operations subjected\r\nto miscarriage, by men immured within a dungeon. They differ in every\r\ncircumstance from men in the field, and leave no pretence for severity\r\nof punishment. But if to the dismal condition of captivity with you must\r\nbe added the constant apprehensions of death; if to be imprisoned is\r\nso nearly to be entombed; and if, after all, the murderers are to be\r\nprotected, and thereby the crime encouraged, wherein do you differ from\r\n[American] Indians either in conduct or character?\r\n\r\nWe can have no idea of your honor, or your justice, in any future\r\ntransaction, of what nature it may be, while you shelter within your\r\nlines an outrageous murderer, and sacrifice in his stead an officer of\r\nyour own. If you have no regard to us, at least spare the blood which\r\nit is your duty to save. Whether the punishment will be greater on him,\r\nwho, in this case, innocently dies, or on him whom sad necessity forces\r\nto retaliate, is, in the nicety of sensation, an undecided question? It\r\nrests with you to prevent the sufferings of both. You have nothing to do\r\nbut to give up the murderer, and the matter ends.\r\n\r\nBut to protect him, be he who he may, is to patronize his crime, and to\r\ntrifle it off by frivolous and unmeaning inquiries, is to promote it.\r\nThere is no declaration you can make, nor promise you can give that will\r\nobtain credit. It is the man and not the apology that is demanded.\r\n\r\nYou see yourself pressed on all sides to spare the life of your own\r\nofficer, for die he will if you withhold justice. The murder of Captain\r\nHuddy is an offence not to be borne with, and there is no security which\r\nwe can have, that such actions or similar ones shall not be repeated,\r\nbut by making the punishment fall upon yourselves. To destroy the last\r\nsecurity of captivity, and to take the unarmed, the unresisting prisoner\r\nto private and sportive execution, is carrying barbarity too high for\r\nsilence. The evil must be put an end to; and the choice of persons rests\r\nwith you. But if your attachment to the guilty is stronger than to the\r\ninnocent, you invent a crime that must destroy your character, and if\r\nthe cause of your king needs to be so supported, for ever cease, sir,\r\nto torture our remembrance with the wretched phrases of British honor,\r\nBritish generosity and British clemency.\r\n\r\nFrom this melancholy circumstance, learn, sir, a lesson of morality. The\r\nrefugees are men whom your predecessors have instructed in wickedness,\r\nthe better to fit them to their master's purpose. To make them useful,\r\nthey have made them vile, and the consequence of their tutored villany\r\nis now descending on the heads of their encouragers. They have been\r\ntrained like hounds to the scent of blood, and cherished in every\r\nspecies of dissolute barbarity. Their ideas of right and wrong are\r\nworn away in the constant habitude of repeated infamy, till, like men\r\npractised in execution, they feel not the value of another's life.\r\n\r\nThe task before you, though painful, is not difficult; give up the\r\nmurderer, and save your officer, as the first outset of a necessary\r\nreformation.                                             COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA May 31, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS. XII. TO THE EARL OF SHELBURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LORD,--A speech, which has been printed in several of the British and\r\nNew York newspapers, as coming from your lordship, in answer to one from\r\nthe Duke of Richmond, of the 10th of July last, contains expressions and\r\nopinions so new and singular, and so enveloped in mysterious reasoning,\r\nthat I address this publication to you, for the purpose of giving them a\r\nfree and candid examination. The speech I allude to is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"His lordship said, it had been mentioned in another place, that he had\r\nbeen guilty of inconsistency. To clear himself of this, he asserted that\r\nhe still held the same principles in respect to American independence\r\nwhich he at first imbibed. He had been, and yet was of opinion, whenever\r\nthe Parliament of Great Britain acknowledges that point, the sun of\r\nEngland's glory is set forever. Such were the sentiments he possessed on\r\na former day, and such the sentiments he continued to hold at this\r\nhour. It was the opinion of Lord Chatham, as well as many other able\r\nstatesmen. Other noble lords, however, think differently, and as the\r\nmajority of the cabinet support them, he acquiesced in the measure,\r\ndissenting from the idea; and the point is settled for bringing\r\nthe matter into the full discussion of Parliament, where it will be\r\ncandidly, fairly, and impartially debated. The independence of America\r\nwould end in the ruin of England; and that a peace patched up with\r\nFrance, would give that proud enemy the means of yet trampling on this\r\ncountry. The sun of England's glory he wished not to see set forever; he\r\nlooked for a spark at least to be left, which might in time light us\r\nup to a new day. But if independence was to be granted, if Parliament\r\ndeemed that measure prudent, he foresaw, in his own mind, that England\r\nwas undone. He wished to God that he had been deputed to Congress, that\r\nbe might plead the cause of that country as well as of this, and that he\r\nmight exercise whatever powers he possessed as an orator, to save both\r\nfrom ruin, in a conviction to Congress, that, if their independence was\r\nsigned, their liberties were gone forever.\r\n\r\n\"Peace, his lordship added, was a desirable object, but it must be an\r\nhonorable peace, and not an humiliating one, dictated by France, or\r\ninsisted on by America. It was very true, that this kingdom was not in a\r\nflourishing state, it was impoverished by war. But if we were not\r\nrich, it was evident that France was poor. If we were straitened in our\r\nfinances, the enemy were exhausted in their resources. This was a great\r\nempire; it abounded with brave men, who were able and willing to fight\r\nin a common cause; the language of humiliation should not, therefore, be\r\nthe language of Great Britain. His lordship said, that he was not afraid\r\nnor ashamed of those expressions going to America. There were numbers,\r\ngreat numbers there, who were of the same way of thinking, in respect\r\nto that country being dependent on this, and who, with his lordship,\r\nperceived ruin and independence linked together.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the speech; on which I remark--That his lordship is a total\r\nstranger to the mind and sentiments of America; that he has wrapped\r\nhimself up in fond delusion, that something less than independence, may,\r\nunder his administration, be accepted; and he wishes himself sent to\r\nCongress, to prove the most extraordinary of all doctrines, which is,\r\nthat independence, the sublimest of all human conditions, is loss of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nIn answer to which we may say, that in order to know what the contrary\r\nword dependence means, we have only to look back to those years of\r\nsevere humiliation, when the mildest of all petitions could obtain no\r\nother notice than the haughtiest of all insults; and when the base\r\nterms of unconditional submission were demanded, or undistinguishable\r\ndestruction threatened. It is nothing to us that the ministry have been\r\nchanged, for they may be changed again. The guilt of a government is\r\nthe crime of a whole country; and the nation that can, though but for\r\na moment, think and act as England has done, can never afterwards be\r\nbelieved or trusted. There are cases in which it is as impossible to\r\nrestore character to life, as it is to recover the dead. It is a phoenix\r\nthat can expire but once, and from whose ashes there is no resurrection.\r\nSome offences are of such a slight composition, that they reach no\r\nfurther than the temper, and are created or cured by a thought. But the\r\nsin of England has struck the heart of America, and nature has not left\r\nin our power to say we can forgive.\r\n\r\nYour lordship wishes for an opportunity to plead before Congress the\r\ncause of England and America, and to save, as you say, both from ruin.\r\n\r\nThat the country, which, for more than seven years has sought our\r\ndestruction, should now cringe to solicit our protection, is adding the\r\nwretchedness of disgrace to the misery of disappointment; and if England\r\nhas the least spark of supposed honor left, that spark must be darkened\r\nby asking, and extinguished by receiving, the smallest favor from\r\nAmerica; for the criminal who owes his life to the grace and mercy of\r\nthe injured, is more executed by living, than he who dies.\r\n\r\nBut a thousand pleadings, even from your lordship, can have no effect.\r\nHonor, interest, and every sensation of the heart, would plead against\r\nyou. We are a people who think not as you think; and what is equally\r\ntrue, you cannot feel as we feel. The situations of the two countries\r\nare exceedingly different. Ours has been the seat of war; yours has seen\r\nnothing of it. The most wanton destruction has been committed in our\r\nsight; the most insolent barbarity has been acted on our feelings. We\r\ncan look round and see the remains of burnt and destroyed houses, once\r\nthe fair fruit of hard industry, and now the striking monuments of\r\nBritish brutality. We walk over the dead whom we loved, in every part of\r\nAmerica, and remember by whom they fell. There is scarcely a village but\r\nbrings to life some melancholy thought, and reminds us of what we have\r\nsuffered, and of those we have lost by the inhumanity of Britain. A\r\nthousand images arise to us, which, from situation, you cannot see, and\r\nare accompanied by as many ideas which you cannot know; and therefore\r\nyour supposed system of reasoning would apply to nothing, and all your\r\nexpectations die of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe question whether England shall accede to the independence of\r\nAmerica, and which your lordship says is to undergo a parliamentary\r\ndiscussion, is so very simple, and composed of so few cases, that it\r\nscarcely needs a debate.\r\n\r\nIt is the only way out of an expensive and ruinous war, which has no\r\nobject, and without which acknowledgment there can be no peace.\r\n\r\nBut your lordship says, the sun of Great Britain will set whenever she\r\nacknowledges the independence of America.--Whereas the metaphor would\r\nhave been strictly just, to have left the sun wholly out of the figure,\r\nand have ascribed her not acknowledging it to the influence of the moon.\r\n\r\nBut the expression, if true, is the greatest confession of disgrace\r\nthat could be made, and furnishes America with the highest notions of\r\nsovereign independent importance. Mr. Wedderburne, about the year 1776,\r\nmade use of an idea of much the same kind,--Relinquish America! says\r\nhe--What is it but to desire a giant to shrink spontaneously into a\r\ndwarf.\r\n\r\nAlas! are those people who call themselves Englishmen, of so little\r\ninternal consequence, that when America is gone, or shuts her eyes\r\nupon them, their sun is set, they can shine no more, but grope about in\r\nobscurity, and contract into insignificant animals? Was America, then,\r\nthe giant of the empire, and England only her dwarf in waiting! Is the\r\ncase so strangely altered, that those who once thought we could not live\r\nwithout them, are now brought to declare that they cannot exist without\r\nus? Will they tell to the world, and that from their first minister of\r\nstate, that America is their all in all; that it is by her importance\r\nonly that they can live, and breathe, and have a being? Will they, who\r\nlong since threatened to bring us to their feet, bow themselves to\r\nours, and own that without us they are not a nation? Are they become so\r\nunqualified to debate on independence, that they have lost all idea of\r\nit themselves, and are calling to the rocks and mountains of America to\r\ncover their insignificance? Or, if America is lost, is it manly to sob\r\nover it like a child for its rattle, and invite the laughter of the\r\nworld by declarations of disgrace? Surely, a more consistent line of\r\nconduct would be to bear it without complaint; and to show that England,\r\nwithout America, can preserve her independence, and a suitable rank with\r\nother European powers. You were not contented while you had her, and to\r\nweep for her now is childish.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Shelburne thinks something may yet be done. What that something\r\nis, or how it is to be accomplished, is a matter in obscurity. By arms\r\nthere is no hope. The experience of nearly eight years, with the expense\r\nof an hundred million pounds sterling, and the loss of two armies,\r\nmust positively decide that point. Besides, the British have lost their\r\ninterest in America with the disaffected. Every part of it has been\r\ntried. There is no new scene left for delusion: and the thousands\r\nwho have been ruined by adhering to them, and have now to quit the\r\nsettlements which they had acquired, and be conveyed like transports to\r\ncultivate the deserts of Augustine and Nova Scotia, has put an end to\r\nall further expectations of aid.\r\n\r\nIf you cast your eyes on the people of England, what have they\r\nto console themselves with for the millions expended? Or, what\r\nencouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after bad?\r\nAmerica can carry on the war for ten years longer, and all the charges\r\nof government included, for less than you can defray the charges of war\r\nand government for one year. And I, who know both countries, know well,\r\nthat the people of America can afford to pay their share of the expense\r\nmuch better than the people of England can. Besides, it is their own\r\nestates and property, their own rights, liberties and government, that\r\nthey are defending; and were they not to do it, they would deserve to\r\nlose all, and none would pity them. The fault would be their own, and\r\ntheir punishment just.\r\n\r\nThe British army in America care not how long the war lasts. They enjoy\r\nan easy and indolent life. They fatten on the folly of one country and\r\nthe spoils of another; and, between their plunder and their prey, may go\r\nhome rich. But the case is very different with the laboring farmer, the\r\nworking tradesman, and the necessitous poor in England, the sweat of\r\nwhose brow goes day after day to feed, in prodigality and sloth, the\r\narmy that is robbing both them and us. Removed from the eye of that\r\ncountry that supports them, and distant from the government that employs\r\nthem, they cut and carve for themselves, and there is none to call them\r\nto account.\r\n\r\nBut England will be ruined, says Lord Shelburne, if America is\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nThen I say, is England already ruined, for America is already\r\nindependent: and if Lord Shelburne will not allow this, he immediately\r\ndenies the fact which he infers. Besides, to make England the mere\r\ncreature of America, is paying too great a compliment to us, and too\r\nlittle to himself.\r\n\r\nBut the declaration is a rhapsody of inconsistency. For to say, as Lord\r\nShelburne has numberless times said, that the war against America is\r\nruinous, and yet to continue the prosecution of that ruinous war for\r\nthe purpose of avoiding ruin, is a language which cannot be understood.\r\nNeither is it possible to see how the independence of America is to\r\naccomplish the ruin of England after the war is over, and yet not affect\r\nit before. America cannot be more independent of her, nor a greater\r\nenemy to her, hereafter than she now is; nor can England derive less\r\nadvantages from her than at present: why then is ruin to follow in the\r\nbest state of the case, and not in the worst? And if not in the worst,\r\nwhy is it to follow at all?\r\n\r\nThat a nation is to be ruined by peace and commerce, and fourteen or\r\nfifteen millions a-year less expenses than before, is a new doctrine in\r\npolitics. We have heard much clamor of national savings and economy; but\r\nsurely the true economy would be, to save the whole charge of a silly,\r\nfoolish, and headstrong war; because, compared with this, all other\r\nretrenchments are baubles and trifles.\r\n\r\nBut is it possible that Lord Shelburne can be serious in supposing that\r\nthe least advantage can be obtained by arms, or that any advantage can\r\nbe equal to the expense or the danger of attempting it? Will not\r\nthe capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all become\r\nprisoners? Must England ever be the sport of hope, and the victim of\r\ndelusion? Sometimes our currency was to fail; another time our army was\r\nto disband; then whole provinces were to revolt. Such a general said\r\nthis and that; another wrote so and so; Lord Chatham was of this\r\nopinion; and lord somebody else of another. To-day 20,000 Russians and\r\n20 Russian ships of the line were to come; to-morrow the empress was\r\nabused without mercy or decency. Then the Emperor of Germany was to\r\nbe bribed with a million of money, and the King of Prussia was to do\r\nwonderful things. At one time it was, Lo here! and then it was, Lo\r\nthere! Sometimes this power, and sometimes that power, was to engage in\r\nthe war, just as if the whole world was mad and foolish like Britain.\r\nAnd thus, from year to year, has every straw been catched at, and every\r\nWill-with-a-wisp led them a new dance.\r\n\r\nThis year a still newer folly is to take place. Lord Shelburne wishes to\r\nbe sent to Congress, and he thinks that something may be done.\r\n\r\nAre not the repeated declarations of Congress, and which all America\r\nsupports, that they will not even hear any proposals whatever, until the\r\nunconditional and unequivocal independence of America is recognised; are\r\nnot, I say, these declarations answer enough?\r\n\r\nBut for England to receive any thing from America now, after so many\r\ninsults, injuries and outrages, acted towards us, would show such\r\na spirit of meanness in her, that we could not but despise her for\r\naccepting it. And so far from Lord Shelburne's coming here to solicit\r\nit, it would be the greatest disgrace we could do them to offer it.\r\nEngland would appear a wretch indeed, at this time of day, to ask or owe\r\nany thing to the bounty of America. Has not the name of Englishman blots\r\nenough upon it, without inventing more? Even Lucifer would scorn to\r\nreign in heaven by permission, and yet an Englishman can creep for only\r\nan entrance into America. Or, has a land of liberty so many charms, that\r\nto be a doorkeeper in it is better than to be an English minister of\r\nstate?\r\n\r\nBut what can this expected something be? Or, if obtained, what can it\r\namount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels? The people\r\nof America have for years accustomed themselves to think and speak so\r\nfreely and contemptuously of English authority, and the inveteracy is\r\nso deeply rooted, that a person invested with any authority from that\r\ncountry, and attempting to exercise it here, would have the life of a\r\ntoad under a harrow. They would look on him as an interloper, to whom\r\ntheir compassion permitted a residence. He would be no more than the\r\nMungo of a farce; and if he disliked that, he must set off. It would\r\nbe a station of degradation, debased by our pity, and despised by our\r\npride, and would place England in a more contemptible situation than\r\nany she has yet been in during the war. We have too high an opinion\r\nof ourselves, even to think of yielding again the least obedience to\r\noutlandish authority; and for a thousand reasons, England would be the\r\nlast country in the world to yield it to. She has been treacherous, and\r\nwe know it. Her character is gone, and we have seen the funeral.\r\n\r\nSurely she loves to fish in troubled waters, and drink the cup of\r\ncontention, or she would not now think of mingling her affairs with\r\nthose of America. It would be like a foolish dotard taking to his arms\r\nthe bride that despises him, or who has placed on his head the ensigns\r\nof her disgust. It is kissing the hand that boxes his ears, and\r\nproposing to renew the exchange. The thought is as servile as the war is\r\nwicked, and shows the last scene of the drama to be as inconsistent as\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nAs America is gone, the only act of manhood is to let her go. Your\r\nlordship had no hand in the separation, and you will gain no honor\r\nby temporising politics. Besides, there is something so exceedingly\r\nwhimsical, unsteady, and even insincere in the present conduct of\r\nEngland, that she exhibits herself in the most dishonorable colors. On\r\nthe second of August last, General Carleton and Admiral Digby wrote to\r\nGeneral Washington in these words:\r\n\r\n\"The resolution of the House of Commons, of the 27th of February last,\r\nhas been placed in Your Excellency's hands, and intimations given at\r\nthe same time that further pacific measures were likely to follow. Since\r\nwhich, until the present time, we have had no direct communications\r\nwith England; but a mail is now arrived, which brings us very important\r\ninformation. We are acquainted, sir, by authority, that negotiations for\r\na general peace have already commenced at Paris, and that Mr. Grenville\r\nis invested with full powers to treat with all the parties at war, and\r\nis now at Paris in execution of his commission. And we are further, sir,\r\nmade acquainted, that His Majesty, in order to remove any obstacles to\r\nthis peace which he so ardently wishes to restore, has commanded his\r\nministers to direct Mr. Grenville, that the independence of the Thirteen\r\nUnited Provinces, should be proposed by him in the first instance,\r\ninstead of making it a condition of a general treaty.\"\r\n\r\nNow, taking your present measures into view, and comparing them with the\r\ndeclaration in this letter, pray what is the word of your king, or his\r\nministers, or the Parliament, good for? Must we not look upon you as a\r\nconfederated body of faithless, treacherous men, whose assurances are\r\nfraud, and their language deceit? What opinion can we possibly form of\r\nyou, but that you are a lost, abandoned, profligate nation, who sport\r\neven with your own character, and are to be held by nothing but the\r\nbayonet or the halter?\r\n\r\nTo say, after this, that the sun of Great Britain will be set whenever\r\nshe acknowledges the independence of America, when the not doing it is\r\nthe unqualified lie of government, can be no other than the language of\r\nridicule, the jargon of inconsistency. There were thousands in America\r\nwho predicted the delusion, and looked upon it as a trick of treachery,\r\nto take us from our guard, and draw off our attention from the only\r\nsystem of finance, by which we can be called, or deserve to be called,\r\na sovereign, independent people. The fraud, on your part, might be worth\r\nattempting, but the sacrifice to obtain it is too high.\r\n\r\nThere are others who credited the assurance, because they thought it\r\nimpossible that men who had their characters to establish, would begin\r\nwith a lie. The prosecution of the war by the former ministry was savage\r\nand horrid; since which it has been mean, trickish, and delusive.\r\nThe one went greedily into the passion of revenge, the other into the\r\nsubtleties of low contrivance; till, between the crimes of both, there\r\nis scarcely left a man in America, be he Whig or Tory, who does not\r\ndespise or detest the conduct of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe management of Lord Shelburne, whatever may be his views, is a\r\ncaution to us, and must be to the world, never to regard British\r\nassurances. A perfidy so notorious cannot be hid. It stands even in the\r\npublic papers of New York, with the names of Carleton and Digby affixed\r\nto it. It is a proclamation that the king of England is not to be\r\nbelieved; that the spirit of lying is the governing principle of the\r\nministry. It is holding up the character of the House of Commons to\r\npublic infamy, and warning all men not to credit them. Such are the\r\nconsequences which Lord Shelburne's management has brought upon his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAfter the authorized declarations contained in Carleton and Digby's\r\nletter, you ought, from every motive of honor, policy and prudence,\r\nto have fulfilled them, whatever might have been the event. It was\r\nthe least atonement that you could possibly make to America, and the\r\ngreatest kindness you could do to yourselves; for you will save millions\r\nby a general peace, and you will lose as many by continuing the war.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29, 1782.\r\n\r\nP. S. The manuscript copy of this letter is sent your lordship, by the\r\nway of our head-quarters, to New York, inclosing a late pamphlet of\r\nmine, addressed to the Abbe Raynal, which will serve to give your\r\nlordship some idea of the principles and sentiments of America.\r\n\r\n                                                 C.

THOUGHTS ON THE PEACE, AND PROBABLE ADVANTAGES\r\nTHEREOF.\r\n\r\n\"THE times that tried men's souls,\"* are over--and the greatest and\r\ncompletest revolution the world ever knew, gloriously and happily\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * \"These are the times that try men's souls,\" The Crisis No. I.\r\npublished December, 1776.\r\n\r\nBut to pass from the extremes of danger to safety--from the tumult\r\nof war to the tranquillity of peace, though sweet in contemplation,\r\nrequires a gradual composure of the senses to receive it. Even calmness\r\nhas the power of stunning, when it opens too instantly upon us. The long\r\nand raging hurricane that should cease in a moment, would leave us in a\r\nstate rather of wonder than enjoyment; and some moments of recollection\r\nmust pass, before we could be capable of tasting the felicity of repose.\r\nThere are but few instances, in which the mind is fitted for sudden\r\ntransitions: it takes in its pleasures by reflection and comparison\r\nand those must have time to act, before the relish for new scenes is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nIn the present case--the mighty magnitude of the object--the various\r\nuncertainties of fate it has undergone--the numerous and complicated\r\ndangers we have suffered or escaped--the eminence we now stand on,\r\nand the vast prospect before us, must all conspire to impress us with\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nTo see it in our power to make a world happy--to teach mankind the art\r\nof being so--to exhibit, on the theatre of the universe a character\r\nhitherto unknown--and to have, as it were, a new creation intrusted to\r\nour hands, are honors that command reflection, and can neither be too\r\nhighly estimated, nor too gratefully received.\r\n\r\nIn this pause then of recollection--while the storm is ceasing, and the\r\nlong agitated mind vibrating to a rest, let us look back on the scenes\r\nwe have passed, and learn from experience what is yet to be done.\r\n\r\nNever, I say, had a country so many openings to happiness as this. Her\r\nsetting out in life, like the rising of a fair morning, was unclouded\r\nand promising. Her cause was good. Her principles just and liberal. Her\r\ntemper serene and firm. Her conduct regulated by the nicest steps, and\r\neverything about her wore the mark of honor. It is not every country\r\n(perhaps there is not another in the world) that can boast so fair\r\nan origin. Even the first settlement of America corresponds with the\r\ncharacter of the revolution. Rome, once the proud mistress of the\r\nuniverse, was originally a band of ruffians. Plunder and rapine made her\r\nrich, and her oppression of millions made her great. But America need\r\nnever be ashamed to tell her birth, nor relate the stages by which she\r\nrose to empire.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance, then, of what is past, if it operates rightly, must\r\ninspire her with the most laudable of all ambition, that of adding to\r\nthe fair fame she began with. The world has seen her great in adversity;\r\nstruggling, without a thought of yielding, beneath accumulated\r\ndifficulties, bravely, nay proudly, encountering distress, and rising\r\nin resolution as the storm increased. All this is justly due to her, for\r\nher fortitude has merited the character. Let, then, the world see that\r\nshe can bear prosperity: and that her honest virtue in time of peace, is\r\nequal to the bravest virtue in time of war.\r\n\r\nShe is now descending to the scenes of quiet and domestic life. Not\r\nbeneath the cypress shade of disappointment, but to enjoy in her own\r\nland, and under her own vine, the sweet of her labors, and the reward of\r\nher toil.--In this situation, may she never forget that a fair national\r\nreputation is of as much importance as independence. That it possesses\r\na charm that wins upon the world, and makes even enemies civil. That it\r\ngives a dignity which is often superior to power, and commands reverence\r\nwhere pomp and splendor fail.\r\n\r\nIt would be a circumstance ever to be lamented and never to be\r\nforgotten, were a single blot, from any cause whatever, suffered to fall\r\non a revolution, which to the end of time must be an honor to the age\r\nthat accomplished it: and which has contributed more to enlighten the\r\nworld, and diffuse a spirit of freedom and liberality among mankind,\r\nthan any human event (if this may be called one) that ever preceded it.\r\n\r\nIt is not among the least of the calamities of a long continued war,\r\nthat it unhinges the mind from those nice sensations which at other\r\ntimes appear so amiable. The continual spectacle of woe blunts the\r\nfiner feelings, and the necessity of bearing with the sight, renders it\r\nfamiliar. In like manner, are many of the moral obligations of society\r\nweakened, till the custom of acting by necessity becomes an apology,\r\nwhere it is truly a crime. Yet let but a nation conceive rightly of\r\nits character, and it will be chastely just in protecting it. None\r\never began with a fairer than America and none can be under a greater\r\nobligation to preserve it.\r\n\r\nThe debt which America has contracted, compared with the cause she\r\nhas gained, and the advantages to flow from it, ought scarcely to be\r\nmentioned. She has it in her choice to do, and to live as happily as\r\nshe pleases. The world is in her hands. She has no foreign power\r\nto monopolize her commerce, perplex her legislation, or control her\r\nprosperity. The struggle is over, which must one day have happened, and,\r\nperhaps, never could have happened at a better time.* And instead of a\r\ndomineering master, she has gained an ally whose exemplary greatness,\r\nand universal liberality, have extorted a confession even from her\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * That the revolution began at the exact period of time best fitted\r\nto the purpose, is sufficiently proved by the event.--But the great\r\nhinge on which the whole machine turned, is the Union of the States: and\r\nthis union was naturally produced by the inability of any one state to\r\nsupport itself against any foreign enemy without the assistance of the\r\nrest. Had the states severally been less able than they were when\r\nthe war began, their united strength would not have been equal to the\r\nundertaking, and they must in all human probability have failed.--And,\r\non the other hand, had they severally been more able, they might not\r\nhave seen, or, what is more, might not have felt, the necessity\r\nof uniting: and, either by attempting to stand alone or in small\r\nconfederacies, would have been separately conquered. Now, as we cannot\r\nsee a time (and many years must pass away before it can arrive) when the\r\nstrength of any one state, or several united, can be equal to the whole\r\nof the present United States, and as we have seen the extreme difficulty\r\nof collectively prosecuting the war to a successful issue, and\r\npreserving our national importance in the world, therefore, from the\r\nexperience we have had, and the knowledge we have gained, we must,\r\nunless we make a waste of wisdom, be strongly impressed with the\r\nadvantage, as well as the necessity of strengthening that happy union\r\nwhich had been our salvation, and without which we should have been\r\na ruined people. While I was writing this note, I cast my eye on the\r\npamphlet, Common Sense, from which I shall make an extract, as it\r\nexactly applies to the case. It is as follows: \"I have never met with\r\na man, either in England or America, who has not confessed it as his\r\nopinion that a separation between the countries would take place one\r\ntime or other; and there is no instance in which we have shown less\r\njudgment, than in endeavoring to describe what we call the ripeness\r\nor fitness of the continent for independence. As all men allow the\r\nmeasure, and differ only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order\r\nto remove mistakes, take a general survey of things, and endeavor, if\r\npossible, to find out the very time. But we need not to go far,\r\nthe inquiry ceases at once, for, the time has found us. The general\r\nconcurrence, the glorious union of all things prove the fact. It is not\r\nin numbers, but in a union, that our great strength lies. The continent\r\nis just arrived at that pitch of strength, in which no single colony is\r\nable to support itself, and the whole, when united, can accomplish\r\nthe matter; and either more or less than this, might be fatal in its\r\neffects.\"\r\n\r\nWith the blessings of peace, independence, and an universal commerce,\r\nthe states, individually and collectively, will have leisure and\r\nopportunity to regulate and establish their domestic concerns, and to\r\nput it beyond the power of calumny to throw the least reflection on\r\ntheir honor. Character is much easier kept than recovered, and that man,\r\nif any such there be, who, from sinister views, or littleness of soul,\r\nlends unseen his hand to injure it, contrives a wound it will never be\r\nin his power to heal.\r\n\r\nAs we have established an inheritance for posterity, let that\r\ninheritance descend, with every mark of an honorable conveyance.\r\nThe little it will cost, compared with the worth of the states, the\r\ngreatness of the object, and the value of the national character, will\r\nbe a profitable exchange.\r\n\r\nBut that which must more forcibly strike a thoughtful, penetrating mind,\r\nand which includes and renders easy all inferior concerns, is the UNION\r\nOF THE STATES. On this our great national character depends. It is this\r\nwhich must give us importance abroad and security at home. It is through\r\nthis only that we are, or can be, nationally known in the world; it is\r\nthe flag of the United States which renders our ships and commerce safe\r\non the seas, or in a foreign port. Our Mediterranean passes must be\r\nobtained under the same style. All our treaties, whether of alliance,\r\npeace, or commerce, are formed under the sovereignty of the United\r\nStates, and Europe knows us by no other name or title.\r\n\r\nThe division of the empire into states is for our own convenience, but\r\nabroad this distinction ceases. The affairs of each state are local.\r\nThey can go no further than to itself. And were the whole worth of even\r\nthe richest of them expended in revenue, it would not be sufficient to\r\nsupport sovereignty against a foreign attack. In short, we have no other\r\nnational sovereignty than as United States. It would even be fatal\r\nfor us if we had--too expensive to be maintained, and impossible to be\r\nsupported. Individuals, or individual states, may call themselves what\r\nthey please; but the world, and especially the world of enemies, is\r\nnot to be held in awe by the whistling of a name. Sovereignty must have\r\npower to protect all the parts that compose and constitute it: and as\r\nUNITED STATES we are equal to the importance of the title, but otherwise\r\nwe are not. Our union, well and wisely regulated and cemented, is the\r\ncheapest way of being great--the easiest way of being powerful, and the\r\nhappiest invention in government which the circumstances of America can\r\nadmit of.--Because it collects from each state, that which, by being\r\ninadequate, can be of no use to it, and forms an aggregate that serves\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nThe states of Holland are an unfortunate instance of the effects of\r\nindividual sovereignty. Their disjointed condition exposes them to\r\nnumerous intrigues, losses, calamities, and enemies; and the almost\r\nimpossibility of bringing their measures to a decision, and that\r\ndecision into execution, is to them, and would be to us, a source of\r\nendless misfortune.\r\n\r\nIt is with confederated states as with individuals in society; something\r\nmust be yielded up to make the whole secure. In this view of things\r\nwe gain by what we give, and draw an annual interest greater than the\r\ncapital.--I ever feel myself hurt when I hear the union, that great\r\npalladium of our liberty and safety, the least irreverently spoken of.\r\nIt is the most sacred thing in the constitution of America, and that\r\nwhich every man should be most proud and tender of. Our citizenship\r\nin the United States is our national character. Our citizenship in any\r\nparticular state is only our local distinction. By the latter we\r\nare known at home, by the former to the world. Our great title is\r\nAMERICANS--our inferior one varies with the place.\r\n\r\nSo far as my endeavors could go, they have all been directed to\r\nconciliate the affections, unite the interests, and draw and keep\r\nthe mind of the country together; and the better to assist in this\r\nfoundation work of the revolution, I have avoided all places of profit\r\nor office, either in the state I live in, or in the United States; kept\r\nmyself at a distance from all parties and party connections, and even\r\ndisregarded all private and inferior concerns: and when we take into\r\nview the great work which we have gone through, and feel, as we ought\r\nto feel, the just importance of it, we shall then see, that the\r\nlittle wranglings and indecent contentions of personal parley, are as\r\ndishonorable to our characters, as they are injurious to our repose.\r\n\r\nIt was the cause of America that made me an author. The force with which\r\nit struck my mind and the dangerous condition the country appeared to me\r\nin, by courting an impossible and an unnatural reconciliation with those\r\nwho were determined to reduce her, instead of striking out into the only\r\nline that could cement and save her, A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, made\r\nit impossible for me, feeling as I did, to be silent: and if, in the\r\ncourse of more than seven years, I have rendered her any service, I have\r\nlikewise added something to the reputation of literature, by freely and\r\ndisinterestedly employing it in the great cause of mankind, and showing\r\nthat there may be genius without prostitution.\r\n\r\nIndependence always appeared to me practicable and probable, provided\r\nthe sentiment of the country could be formed and held to the object:\r\nand there is no instance in the world, where a people so extended,\r\nand wedded to former habits of thinking, and under such a variety of\r\ncircumstances, were so instantly and effectually pervaded, by a turn\r\nin politics, as in the case of independence; and who supported their\r\nopinion, undiminished, through such a succession of good and ill\r\nfortune, till they crowned it with success.\r\n\r\nBut as the scenes of war are closed, and every man preparing for home\r\nand happier times, I therefore take my leave of the subject. I have most\r\nsincerely followed it from beginning to end, and through all its turns\r\nand windings: and whatever country I may hereafter be in, I shall always\r\nfeel an honest pride at the part I have taken and acted, and a gratitude\r\nto nature and providence for putting it in my power to be of some use to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n                                                COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUPERNUMERARY CRISIS: TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIN \"_Rivington's New York Gazette_,\" of December 6th, is a publication,\r\nunder the appearance of a letter from London, dated September 30th; and\r\nis on a subject which demands the attention of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe public will remember that a treaty of commerce between the United\r\nStates and England was set on foot last spring, and that until the\r\nsaid treaty could be completed, a bill was brought into the British\r\nParliament by the then chancellor of the exchequer, Mr. Pitt, to admit\r\nand legalize (as the case then required) the commerce of the United\r\nStates into the British ports and dominions. But neither the one nor the\r\nother has been completed. The commercial treaty is either broken off, or\r\nremains as it began; and the bill in Parliament has been thrown aside.\r\nAnd in lieu thereof, a selfish system of English politics has started\r\nup, calculated to fetter the commerce of America, by engrossing to\r\nEngland the carrying trade of the American produce to the West India\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nAmong the advocates for this last measure is Lord Sheffield, a member\r\nof the British Parliament, who has published a pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Observations on the Commerce of the American States.\" The pamphlet\r\nhas two objects; the one is to allure the Americans to purchase British\r\nmanufactures; and the other to spirit up the British Parliament to\r\nprohibit the citizens of the United States from trading to the West\r\nIndia islands.\r\n\r\nViewed in this light, the pamphlet, though in some parts dexterously\r\nwritten, is an absurdity. It offends, in the very act of endeavoring\r\nto ingratiate; and his lordship, as a politician, ought not to have\r\nsuffered the two objects to have appeared together. The latter alluded\r\nto, contains extracts from the pamphlet, with high encomiums on Lord\r\nSheffield, for laboriously endeavoring (as the letter styles it) \"to\r\nshow the mighty advantages of retaining the carrying trade.\"\r\n\r\nSince the publication of this pamphlet in England, the commerce of\r\nthe United States to the West Indies, in American vessels, has been\r\nprohibited; and all intercourse, except in British bottoms, the property\r\nof and navigated by British subjects, cut off.\r\n\r\nThat a country has a right to be as foolish as it pleases, has been\r\nproved by the practice of England for many years past: in her island\r\nsituation, sequestered from the world, she forgets that her whispers are\r\nheard by other nations; and in her plans of politics and commerce she\r\nseems not to know, that other votes are necessary besides her own.\r\nAmerica would be equally as foolish as Britain, were she to suffer so\r\ngreat a degradation on her flag, and such a stroke on the freedom of her\r\ncommerce, to pass without a balance.\r\n\r\nWe admit the right of any nation to prohibit the commerce of another\r\ninto its own dominions, where there are no treaties to the contrary; but\r\nas this right belongs to one side as well as the other, there is always\r\na way left to bring avarice and insolence to reason.\r\n\r\nBut the ground of security which Lord Sheffield has chosen to erect his\r\npolicy upon, is of a nature which ought, and I think must, awaken\r\nin every American a just and strong sense of national dignity. Lord\r\nSheffield appears to be sensible, that in advising the British nation\r\nand Parliament to engross to themselves so great a part of the carrying\r\ntrade of America, he is attempting a measure which cannot succeed, if\r\nthe politics of the United States be properly directed to counteract the\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nBut, says he, in his pamphlet, \"It will be a long time before the\r\nAmerican states can be brought to act as a nation, neither are they to\r\nbe feared as such by us.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is this more or less than to tell us, that while we have no\r\nnational system of commerce, the British will govern our trade by their\r\nown laws and proclamations as they please. The quotation discloses\r\na truth too serious to be overlooked, and too mischievous not to be\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\nAmong other circumstances which led them to this discovery none could\r\noperate so effectually as the injudicious, uncandid and indecent\r\nopposition made by sundry persons in a certain state, to the\r\nrecommendations of Congress last winter, for an import duty of five per\r\ncent. It could not but explain to the British a weakness in the national\r\npower of America, and encourage them to attempt restrictions on her\r\ntrade, which otherwise they would not have dared to hazard. Neither is\r\nthere any state in the union, whose policy was more misdirected to its\r\ninterest than the state I allude to, because her principal support is\r\nthe carrying trade, which Britain, induced by the want of a well-centred\r\npower in the United States to protect and secure, is now attempting to\r\ntake away. It fortunately happened (and to no state in the union more\r\nthan the state in question) that the terms of peace were agreed on\r\nbefore the opposition appeared, otherwise, there cannot be a doubt, that\r\nif the same idea of the diminished authority of America had occurred\r\nto them at that time as has occurred to them since, but they would have\r\nmade the same grasp at the fisheries, as they have done at the carrying\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that an authority which can be supported with so much\r\nease, and so little expense, and capable of such extensive advantages\r\nto the country, should be cavilled at by those whose duty it is to watch\r\nover it, and whose existence as a people depends upon it. But this,\r\nperhaps, will ever be the case, till some misfortune awakens us into\r\nreason, and the instance now before us is but a gentle beginning of what\r\nAmerica must expect, unless she guards her union with nicer care and\r\nstricter honor. United, she is formidable, and that with the least\r\npossible charge a nation can be so; separated, she is a medley of\r\nindividual nothings, subject to the sport of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the ingenuity of commerce may have found out\r\na method to evade and supersede the intentions of the British, in\r\ninterdicting the trade with the West India islands. The language of both\r\nbeing the same, and their customs well understood, the vessels of one\r\ncountry may, by deception, pass for those of another. But this would\r\nbe a practice too debasing for a sovereign people to stoop to, and too\r\nprofligate not to be discountenanced. An illicit trade, under any shape\r\nit can be placed, cannot be carried on without a violation of truth.\r\nAmerica is now sovereign and independent, and ought to conduct her\r\naffairs in a regular style of character. She has the same right to\r\nsay that no British vessel shall enter ports, or that no British\r\nmanufactures shall be imported, but in American bottoms, the property\r\nof, and navigated by American subjects, as Britain has to say the same\r\nthing respecting the West Indies. Or she may lay a duty of ten, fifteen,\r\nor twenty shillings per ton (exclusive of other duties) on every\r\nBritish vessel coming from any port of the West Indies, where she is not\r\nadmitted to trade, the said tonnage to continue as long on her side as\r\nthe prohibition continues on the other.\r\n\r\nBut it is only by acting in union, that the usurpations of foreign\r\nnations on the freedom of trade can be counteracted, and security\r\nextended to the commerce of America. And when we view a flag, which to\r\nthe eye is beautiful, and to contemplate its rise and origin inspires\r\na sensation of sublime delight, our national honor must unite with our\r\ninterest to prevent injury to the one, or insult to the other.\r\n\r\n                                                COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, December 9, 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE, VOLUME II.\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Paine\r\n\r\nCollected And Edited By\r\n\r\nMoncure Daniel Conway\r\n\r\n\r\n1779 - 1792\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Redactor's Note: Reprinted from the \"The Writings of Thomas Paine\r\nVolume I\" (1894 - 1896).

RIGHTS OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Thomas Paine sailed from America for France, in April, 1787, he was\r\nperhaps as happy a man as any in the world. His most intimate friend,\r\nJefferson, was Minister at Paris, and his friend Lafayette was the idol\r\nof France. His fame had preceded him, and he at once became, in Paris,\r\nthe centre of the same circle of savants and philosophers that had\r\nsurrounded Franklin. His main reason for proceeding at once to Paris was\r\nthat he might submit to the Academy of Sciences his invention of an iron\r\nbridge, and with its favorable verdict he came to England, in September.\r\nHe at once went to his aged mother at Thetford, leaving with a publisher\r\n(Ridgway), his \"Prospects on the Rubicon.\" He next made arrangements to\r\npatent his bridge, and to construct at Rotherham the large model of it\r\nexhibited on Paddington Green, London. He was welcomed in England by\r\nleading statesmen, such as Lansdowne and Fox, and above all by Edmund\r\nBurke, who for some time had him as a guest at Beaconsfield, and drove\r\nhim about in various parts of the country. He had not the slightest\r\nrevolutionary purpose, either as regarded England or France. Towards\r\nLouis XVI. he felt only gratitude for the services he had rendered\r\nAmerica, and towards George III. he felt no animosity whatever. His four\r\nmonths' sojourn in Paris had convinced him that there was approaching a\r\nreform of that country after the American model, except that the Crown\r\nwould be preserved, a compromise he approved, provided the throne should\r\nnot be hereditary. Events in France travelled more swiftly than he had\r\nanticipated, and Paine was summoned by Lafayette, Condorcet, and others,\r\nas an adviser in the formation of a new constitution.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation immediately preceding the political and literary\r\nduel between Paine and Burke, which in the event turned out a tremendous\r\nwar between Royalism and Republicanism in Europe. Paine was, both in\r\nFrance and in England, the inspirer of moderate counsels. Samuel Rogers\r\nrelates that in early life he dined at a friend's house in London\r\nwith Thomas Paine, when one of the toasts given was the \"memory of\r\nJoshua,\"--in allusion to the Hebrew leader's conquest of the kings of\r\nCanaan, and execution of them. Paine observed that he would not treat\r\nkings like Joshua. \"I 'm of the Scotch parson's opinion,\" he said,\r\n\"when he prayed against Louis XIV.--`Lord, shake him over the mouth of\r\nhell, but don't let him drop!'\" Paine then gave as his toast, \"The\r\nRepublic of the World,\"--which Samuel Rogers, aged twenty-nine, noted\r\nas a sublime idea. This was Paine's faith and hope, and with it he\r\nconfronted the revolutionary storms which presently burst over France\r\nand England.\r\n\r\nUntil Burke's arraignment of France in his parliamentary speech\r\n(February 9, 1790), Paine had no doubt whatever that he would sympathize\r\nwith the movement in France, and wrote to him from that country as\r\nif conveying glad tidings. Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in\r\nFrance\" appeared November 1, 1790, and Paine at once set himself to\r\nanswer it. He was then staying at the Angel Inn, Islington. The inn\r\nhas been twice rebuilt since that time, and from its contents there is\r\npreserved only a small image, which perhaps was meant to represent\r\n\"Liberty,\"--possibly brought from Paris by Paine as an ornament for his\r\nstudy. From the Angel he removed to a house in Harding Street, Fetter\r\nLane. Rickman says Part First of \"Rights of Man\" was finished at\r\nVersailles, but probably this has reference to the preface only, as I\r\ncannot find Paine in France that year until April 8. The book had been\r\nprinted by Johnson, in time for the opening of Parliament, in February;\r\nbut this publisher became frightened after a few copies were out (there\r\nis one in the British Museum), and the work was transferred to J. S.\r\nJordan, 166 Fleet Street, with a preface sent from Paris (not contained\r\nin Johnson's edition, nor in the American editions). The pamphlet,\r\nthough sold at the same price as Burke's, three shillings, had a vast\r\ncirculation, and Paine gave the proceeds to the Constitutional Societies\r\nwhich sprang up under his teachings in various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nSoon after appeared Burke's \"Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs.\" In\r\nthis Burke quoted a good deal from \"Rights of Man,\" but replied to it\r\nonly with exclamation points, saying that the only answer such ideas\r\nmerited was \"criminal justice.\" Paine's Part Second followed, published\r\nFebruary 17, 1792. In Part First Paine had mentioned a rumor that Burke\r\nwas a masked pensioner (a charge that will be noticed in connection with\r\nits detailed statement in a further publication); and as Burke had\r\nbeen formerly arraigned in Parliament, while Paymaster, for a very\r\nquestionable proceeding, this charge no doubt hurt a good deal. Although\r\nthe government did not follow Burke's suggestion of a prosecution\r\nat that time, there is little doubt that it was he who induced the\r\nprosecution of Part Second. Before the trial came on, December 18, 1792,\r\nPaine was occupying his seat in the French Convention, and could only be\r\noutlawed.\r\n\r\nBurke humorously remarked to a friend of Paine and himself, \"We hunt\r\nin pairs.\" The severally representative character and influence of these\r\ntwo men in the revolutionary era, in France and England, deserve more\r\nadequate study than they have received. While Paine maintained freedom\r\nof discussion, Burke first proposed criminal prosecution for sentiments\r\nby no means libellous (such as Paine's Part First). While Paine was\r\nendeavoring to make the movement in France peaceful, Burke fomented the\r\nleague of monarchs against France which maddened its people, and brought\r\non the Reign of Terror. While Paine was endeavoring to preserve the\r\nFrench throne (\"phantom\" though he believed it), to prevent bloodshed,\r\nBurke was secretly writing to the Queen of France, entreating her not\r\nto compromise, and to \"trust to the support of foreign armies\"\r\n(\"Histoire de France depuis 1789.\" Henri Martin, i., 151). While Burke\r\nthus helped to bring the King and Queen to the guillotine, Paine pleaded\r\nfor their lives to the last moment. While Paine maintained the right of\r\nmankind to improve their condition, Burke held that \"the awful Author\r\nof our being is the author of our place in the order of existence;\r\nand that, having disposed and marshalled us by a divine tactick, not\r\naccording to our will, but according to his, he has, in and by that\r\ndisposition, virtually subjected us to act the part which belongs to\r\nthe place assigned us.\" Paine was a religious believer in eternal\r\nprinciples; Burke held that \"political problems do not primarily\r\nconcern truth or falsehood. They relate to good or evil. What in the\r\nresult is likely to produce evil is politically false, that which is\r\nproductive of good politically is true.\" Assuming thus the visionary's\r\nright to decide before the result what was \"likely to produce evil,\"\r\nBurke vigorously sought to kindle war against the French Republic which\r\nmight have developed itself peacefully, while Paine was striving for\r\nan international Congress in Europe in the interest of peace. Paine\r\nhad faith in the people, and believed that, if allowed to choose\r\nrepresentatives, they would select their best and wisest men; and that\r\nwhile reforming government the people would remain orderly, as they had\r\ngenerally remained in America during the transition from British rule\r\nto selfgovernment. Burke maintained that if the existing political order\r\nwere broken up there would be no longer a people, but \"a number of\r\nvague, loose individuals, and nothing more.\" \"Alas!\" he exclaims,\r\n\"they little know how many a weary step is to be taken before they can\r\nform themselves into a mass, which has a true personality.\" For the sake\r\nof peace Paine wished the revolution to be peaceful as the advance of\r\nsummer; he used every endeavor to reconcile English radicals to some\r\nmodus vivendi with the existing order, as he was willing to retain Louis\r\nXVI. as head of the executive in France: Burke resisted every tendency\r\nof English statesmanship to reform at home, or to negotiate with the\r\nFrench Republic, and was mainly responsible for the King's death and the\r\nwar that followed between England and France in February, 1793. Burke\r\nbecame a royal favorite, Paine was outlawed by a prosecution originally\r\nproposed by Burke. While Paine was demanding religious liberty, Burke\r\nwas opposing the removal of penal statutes from Unitarians, on the\r\nground that but for those statutes Paine might some day set up a church\r\nin England. When Burke was retiring on a large royal pension, Paine\r\nwas in prison, through the devices of Burke's confederate, the American\r\nMinister in Paris. So the two men, as Burke said, \"hunted in pairs.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as Burke attempts to affirm any principle he is fairly quoted in\r\nPaine's work, and nowhere misrepresented. As for Paine's own ideas, the\r\nreader should remember that \"Rights of Man\" was the earliest complete\r\nstatement of republican principles. They were pronounced to be the\r\nfundamental principles of the American Republic by Jefferson, Madison,\r\nand Jackson,-the three Presidents who above all others represented the\r\nrepublican idea which Paine first allied with American Independence.\r\nThose who suppose that Paine did but reproduce the principles of\r\nRousseau and Locke will find by careful study of his well-weighed\r\nlanguage that such is not the case. Paine's political principles were\r\nevolved out of his early Quakerism. He was potential in George Fox. The\r\nbelief that every human soul was the child of God, and capable of\r\ndirect inspiration from the Father of all, without mediator or priestly\r\nintervention, or sacramental instrumentality, was fatal to all privilege\r\nand rank. The universal Fatherhood implied universal Brotherhood, or\r\nhuman equality. But the fate of the Quakers proved the necessity of\r\nprotecting the individual spirit from oppression by the majority as well\r\nas by privileged classes. For this purpose Paine insisted on surrounding\r\nthe individual right with the security of the Declaration of Rights,\r\nnot to be invaded by any government; and would reduce government to an\r\nassociation limited in its operations to the defence of those rights\r\nwhich the individual is unable, alone, to maintain.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding chapter it will be seen that Part Second of \"Rights\r\nof Man\" was begun by Paine in the spring of 1791. At the close of that\r\nyear, or early in 1792, he took up his abode with his friend Thomas\r\n\"Clio\" Rickman, at No. 7 Upper Marylebone Street. Rickman was a radical\r\npublisher; the house remains still a book-binding establishment, and\r\nseems little changed since Paine therein revised the proofs of Part\r\nSecond on a table which Rickman marked with a plate, and which is now in\r\npossession of Mr. Edward Truelove. As the plate states, Paine wrote on\r\nthe same table other works which appeared in England in 1792.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 D. I. Eaton published an edition of \"Rights of Man,\" with a\r\npreface purporting to have been written by Paine while in Luxembourg\r\nprison. It is manifestly spurious. The genuine English and French\r\nprefaces are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF MAN\r\n\r\nBeing An Answer To Mr. Burke's Attack On The French Revoloution\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Paine\r\n\r\nSecretary For Foreign Affairs To Congress In The American War, And\r\nAuthor Of The Works Entitled \"Common Sense\" And \"A Letter To Abbe\r\nRaynal\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DEDICATION\r\n\r\n  George Washington\r\n\r\n  President Of The United States Of America\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n  I present you a small treatise in defence of those principles of\r\n  freedom which your exemplary virtue hath so eminently contributed to\r\n  establish. That the Rights of Man may become as universal as your\r\n  benevolence can wish, and that you may enjoy the happiness of seeing\r\n  the New World regenerate the Old, is the prayer of\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your much obliged, and\r\n\r\n     Obedient humble Servant,\r\n\r\n      Thomas Paine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINE'S PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION\r\n\r\nFrom the part Mr. Burke took in the American Revolution, it was natural\r\nthat I should consider him a friend to mankind; and as our acquaintance\r\ncommenced on that ground, it would have been more agreeable to me to\r\nhave had cause to continue in that opinion than to change it.\r\n\r\nAt the time Mr. Burke made his violent speech last winter in the English\r\nParliament against the French Revolution and the National Assembly, I\r\nwas in Paris, and had written to him but a short time before to inform\r\nhim how prosperously matters were going on. Soon after this I saw his\r\nadvertisement of the Pamphlet he intended to publish: As the attack\r\nwas to be made in a language but little studied, and less understood in\r\nFrance, and as everything suffers by translation, I promised some of\r\nthe friends of the Revolution in that country that whenever Mr. Burke's\r\nPamphlet came forth, I would answer it. This appeared to me the more\r\nnecessary to be done, when I saw the flagrant misrepresentations which\r\nMr. Burke's Pamphlet contains; and that while it is an outrageous\r\nabuse on the French Revolution, and the principles of Liberty, it is an\r\nimposition on the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nI am the more astonished and disappointed at this conduct in Mr. Burke,\r\nas (from the circumstances I am going to mention) I had formed other\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nI had seen enough of the miseries of war, to wish it might never more\r\nhave existence in the world, and that some other mode might be found\r\nout to settle the differences that should occasionally arise in the\r\nneighbourhood of nations. This certainly might be done if Courts were\r\ndisposed to set honesty about it, or if countries were enlightened\r\nenough not to be made the dupes of Courts. The people of America had\r\nbeen bred up in the same prejudices against France, which at that time\r\ncharacterised the people of England; but experience and an acquaintance\r\nwith the French Nation have most effectually shown to the Americans the\r\nfalsehood of those prejudices; and I do not believe that a more cordial\r\nand confidential intercourse exists between any two countries than\r\nbetween America and France.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to France, in the spring of 1787, the Archbishop of\r\nThoulouse was then Minister, and at that time highly esteemed. I became\r\nmuch acquainted with the private Secretary of that Minister, a man of\r\nan enlarged benevolent heart; and found that his sentiments and my own\r\nperfectly agreed with respect to the madness of war, and the wretched\r\nimpolicy of two nations, like England and France, continually worrying\r\neach other, to no other end than that of a mutual increase of burdens\r\nand taxes. That I might be assured I had not misunderstood him, nor he\r\nme, I put the substance of our opinions into writing and sent it to him;\r\nsubjoining a request, that if I should see among the people of England,\r\nany disposition to cultivate a better understanding between the two\r\nnations than had hitherto prevailed, how far I might be authorised\r\nto say that the same disposition prevailed on the part of France? He\r\nanswered me by letter in the most unreserved manner, and that not for\r\nhimself only, but for the Minister, with whose knowledge the letter was\r\ndeclared to be written.\r\n\r\nI put this letter into the, hands of Mr. Burke almost three years ago,\r\nand left it with him, where it still remains; hoping, and at the same\r\ntime naturally expecting, from the opinion I had conceived of him, that\r\nhe would find some opportunity of making good use of it, for the purpose\r\nof removing those errors and prejudices which two neighbouring nations,\r\nfrom the want of knowing each other, had entertained, to the injury of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nWhen the French Revolution broke out, it certainly afforded to Mr. Burke\r\nan opportunity of doing some good, had he been disposed to it; instead\r\nof which, no sooner did he see the old prejudices wearing away, than he\r\nimmediately began sowing the seeds of a new inveteracy, as if he were\r\nafraid that England and France would cease to be enemies. That there are\r\nmen in all countries who get their living by war, and by keeping up the\r\nquarrels of Nations, is as shocking as it is true; but when those who\r\nare concerned in the government of a country, make it their study to sow\r\ndiscord and cultivate prejudices between Nations, it becomes the more\r\nunpardonable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to a paragraph in this work alluding to Mr. Burke's having\r\na pension, the report has been some time in circulation, at least two\r\nmonths; and as a person is often the last to hear what concerns him\r\nthe most to know, I have mentioned it, that Mr. Burke may have an\r\nopportunity of contradicting the rumour, if he thinks proper.\r\n\r\n      Thomas Paine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINE'S PREFACE TO THE FRENCH EDITION\r\n\r\nThe astonishment which the French Revolution has caused throughout\r\nEurope should be considered from two different points of view: first as\r\nit affects foreign peoples, secondly as it affects their governments.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the French people is that of all Europe, or rather of the\r\nwhole world; but the governments of all those countries are by no means\r\nfavorable to it. It is important that we should never lose sight of this\r\ndistinction. We must not confuse the peoples with their governments;\r\nespecially not the English people with its government.\r\n\r\nThe government of England is no friend of the revolution of France.\r\nOf this we have sufficient proofs in the thanks given by that weak and\r\nwitless person, the Elector of Hanover, sometimes called the King of\r\nEngland, to Mr. Burke for the insults heaped on it in his book, and in\r\nthe malevolent comments of the English Minister, Pitt, in his speeches\r\nin Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the professions of sincerest friendship found in the\r\nofficial correspondence of the English government with that of France,\r\nits conduct gives the lie to all its declarations, and shows us clearly\r\nthat it is not a court to be trusted, but an insane court, plunging in\r\nall the quarrels and intrigues of Europe, in quest of a war to satisfy\r\nits folly and countenance its extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe English nation, on the contrary, is very favorably disposed towards\r\nthe French Revolution, and to the progress of liberty in the whole\r\nworld; and this feeling will become more general in England as the\r\nintrigues and artifices of its government are better known, and the\r\nprinciples of the revolution better understood. The French should know\r\nthat most English newspapers are directly in the pay of government, or,\r\nif indirectly connected with it, always under its orders; and that those\r\npapers constantly distort and attack the revolution in France in order\r\nto deceive the nation. But, as it is impossible long to prevent the\r\nprevalence of truth, the daily falsehoods of those papers no longer have\r\nthe desired effect.\r\n\r\nTo be convinced that the voice of truth has been stifled in England, the\r\nworld needs only to be told that the government regards and prosecutes\r\nas a libel that which it should protect.*[1] This outrage on morality is\r\ncalled law, and judges are found wicked enough to inflict penalties on\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe English government presents, just now, a curious phenomenon. Seeing\r\nthat the French and English nations are getting rid of the prejudices\r\nand false notions formerly entertained against each other, and which\r\nhave cost them so much money, that government seems to be placarding its\r\nneed of a foe; for unless it finds one somewhere, no pretext exists for\r\nthe enormous revenue and taxation now deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore it seeks in Russia the enemy it has lost in France, and\r\nappears to say to the universe, or to say to itself. \"If nobody will be\r\nso kind as to become my foe, I shall need no more fleets nor armies,\r\nand shall be forced to reduce my taxes. The American war enabled me to\r\ndouble the taxes; the Dutch business to add more; the Nootka humbug gave\r\nme a pretext for raising three millions sterling more; but unless I can\r\nmake an enemy of Russia the harvest from wars will end. I was the first\r\nto incite Turk against Russian, and now I hope to reap a fresh crop of\r\ntaxes.\"\r\n\r\nIf the miseries of war, and the flood of evils it spreads over a\r\ncountry, did not check all inclination to mirth, and turn laughter\r\ninto grief, the frantic conduct of the government of England would only\r\nexcite ridicule. But it is impossible to banish from one's mind the\r\nimages of suffering which the contemplation of such vicious policy\r\npresents. To reason with governments, as they have existed for ages,\r\nis to argue with brutes. It is only from the nations themselves that\r\nreforms can be expected. There ought not now to exist any doubt that the\r\npeoples of France, England, and America, enlightened and enlightening\r\neach other, shall henceforth be able, not merely to give the world an\r\nexample of good government, but by their united influence enforce its\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n(Translated from the French)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF MAN. PART THE FIRST BEING AN ANSWER TO MR. BURKE'S ATTACK ON\r\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the incivilities by which nations or individuals provoke and\r\nirritate each other, Mr. Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution is an\r\nextraordinary instance. Neither the People of France, nor the National\r\nAssembly, were troubling themselves about the affairs of England, or\r\nthe English Parliament; and that Mr. Burke should commence an unprovoked\r\nattack upon them, both in Parliament and in public, is a conduct that\r\ncannot be pardoned on the score of manners, nor justified on that of\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely an epithet of abuse to be found in the English\r\nlanguage, with which Mr. Burke has not loaded the French Nation and the\r\nNational Assembly. Everything which rancour, prejudice, ignorance or\r\nknowledge could suggest, is poured forth in the copious fury of near\r\nfour hundred pages. In the strain and on the plan Mr. Burke was writing,\r\nhe might have written on to as many thousands. When the tongue or the\r\npen is let loose in a frenzy of passion, it is the man, and not the\r\nsubject, that becomes exhausted.\r\n\r\nHitherto Mr. Burke has been mistaken and disappointed in the opinions\r\nhe had formed of the affairs of France; but such is the ingenuity of his\r\nhope, or the malignancy of his despair, that it furnishes him with new\r\npretences to go on. There was a time when it was impossible to make Mr.\r\nBurke believe there would be any Revolution in France. His opinion then\r\nwas, that the French had neither spirit to undertake it nor fortitude to\r\nsupport it; and now that there is one, he seeks an escape by condemning\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNot sufficiently content with abusing the National Assembly, a great\r\npart of his work is taken up with abusing Dr. Price (one of the\r\nbest-hearted men that lives) and the two societies in England known by\r\nthe name of the Revolution Society and the Society for Constitutional\r\nInformation.\r\n\r\nDr. Price had preached a sermon on the 4th of November, 1789, being\r\nthe anniversary of what is called in England the Revolution, which took\r\nplace 1688. Mr. Burke, speaking of this sermon, says: \"The political\r\nDivine proceeds dogmatically to assert, that by the principles of\r\nthe Revolution, the people of England have acquired three fundamental\r\nrights:\r\n\r\n1. To choose our own governors.\r\n\r\n2. To cashier them for misconduct.\r\n\r\n3. To frame a government for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Price does not say that the right to do these things exists in this\r\nor in that person, or in this or in that description of persons, but\r\nthat it exists in the whole; that it is a right resident in the nation.\r\nMr. Burke, on the contrary, denies that such a right exists in the\r\nnation, either in whole or in part, or that it exists anywhere; and,\r\nwhat is still more strange and marvellous, he says: \"that the people\r\nof England utterly disclaim such a right, and that they will resist\r\nthe practical assertion of it with their lives and fortunes.\" That men\r\nshould take up arms and spend their lives and fortunes, not to maintain\r\ntheir rights, but to maintain they have not rights, is an entirely new\r\nspecies of discovery, and suited to the paradoxical genius of Mr. Burke.\r\n\r\nThe method which Mr. Burke takes to prove that the people of England\r\nhave no such rights, and that such rights do not now exist in the\r\nnation, either in whole or in part, or anywhere at all, is of the same\r\nmarvellous and monstrous kind with what he has already said; for his\r\narguments are that the persons, or the generation of persons, in whom\r\nthey did exist, are dead, and with them the right is dead also. To prove\r\nthis, he quotes a declaration made by Parliament about a hundred years\r\nago, to William and Mary, in these words: \"The Lords Spiritual and\r\nTemporal, and Commons, do, in the name of the people aforesaid\" (meaning\r\nthe people of England then living) \"most humbly and faithfully submit\r\nthemselves, their heirs and posterities, for Ever.\" He quotes a clause\r\nof another Act of Parliament made in the same reign, the terms of which\r\nhe says, \"bind us\" (meaning the people of their day), \"our heirs and our\r\nposterity, to them, their heirs and posterity, to the end of time.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burke conceives his point sufficiently established by producing\r\nthose clauses, which he enforces by saying that they exclude the\r\nright of the nation for ever. And not yet content with making such\r\ndeclarations, repeated over and over again, he farther says, \"that if\r\nthe people of England possessed such a right before the Revolution\"\r\n(which he acknowledges to have been the case, not only in England, but\r\nthroughout Europe, at an early period), \"yet that the English Nation\r\ndid, at the time of the Revolution, most solemnly renounce and abdicate\r\nit, for themselves, and for all their posterity, for ever.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Burke occasionally applies the poison drawn from his horrid\r\nprinciples, not only to the English nation, but to the French Revolution\r\nand the National Assembly, and charges that august, illuminated and\r\nilluminating body of men with the epithet of usurpers, I shall, sans\r\nceremonie, place another system of principles in opposition to his.\r\n\r\nThe English Parliament of 1688 did a certain thing, which, for\r\nthemselves and their constituents, they had a right to do, and which\r\nit appeared right should be done. But, in addition to this right, which\r\nthey possessed by delegation, they set up another right by assumption,\r\nthat of binding and controlling posterity to the end of time. The case,\r\ntherefore, divides itself into two parts; the right which they possessed\r\nby delegation, and the right which they set up by assumption. The first\r\nis admitted; but with respect to the second, I reply: There never\r\ndid, there never will, and there never can, exist a Parliament, or any\r\ndescription of men, or any generation of men, in any country, possessed\r\nof the right or the power of binding and controlling posterity to\r\nthe \"end of time,\" or of commanding for ever how the world shall be\r\ngoverned, or who shall govern it; and therefore all such clauses, acts\r\nor declarations by which the makers of them attempt to do what they have\r\nneither the right nor the power to do, nor the power to execute, are in\r\nthemselves null and void. Every age and generation must be as free to\r\nact for itself in all cases as the age and generations which preceded\r\nit. The vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave is the most\r\nridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies. Man has no property in man;\r\nneither has any generation a property in the generations which are to\r\nfollow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of any other period,\r\nhad no more right to dispose of the people of the present day, or to\r\nbind or to control them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or\r\nthe people of the present day have to dispose of, bind or control those\r\nwho are to live a hundred or a thousand years hence. Every generation\r\nis, and must be, competent to all the purposes which its occasions\r\nrequire. It is the living, and not the dead, that are to be\r\naccommodated. When man ceases to be, his power and his wants cease with\r\nhim; and having no longer any participation in the concerns of this\r\nworld, he has no longer any authority in directing who shall be\r\nits governors, or how its government shall be organised, or how\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nI am not contending for nor against any form of government, nor for nor\r\nagainst any party, here or elsewhere. That which a whole nation chooses\r\nto do it has a right to do. Mr. Burke says, No. Where, then, does the\r\nright exist? I am contending for the rights of the living, and against\r\ntheir being willed away and controlled and contracted for by the\r\nmanuscript assumed authority of the dead, and Mr. Burke is contending\r\nfor the authority of the dead over the rights and freedom of the living.\r\nThere was a time when kings disposed of their crowns by will upon their\r\ndeath-beds, and consigned the people, like beasts of the field, to\r\nwhatever successor they appointed. This is now so exploded as scarcely\r\nto be remembered, and so monstrous as hardly to be believed. But the\r\nParliamentary clauses upon which Mr. Burke builds his political church\r\nare of the same nature.\r\n\r\nThe laws of every country must be analogous to some common principle.\r\nIn England no parent or master, nor all the authority of Parliament,\r\nomnipotent as it has called itself, can bind or control the personal\r\nfreedom even of an individual beyond the age of twenty-one years. On\r\nwhat ground of right, then, could the Parliament of 1688, or any other\r\nParliament, bind all posterity for ever?\r\n\r\nThose who have quitted the world, and those who have not yet arrived\r\nat it, are as remote from each other as the utmost stretch of mortal\r\nimagination can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can exist\r\nbetween them--what rule or principle can be laid down that of two\r\nnonentities, the one out of existence and the other not in, and who\r\nnever can meet in this world, the one should control the other to the\r\nend of time?\r\n\r\nIn England it is said that money cannot be taken out of the pockets\r\nof the people without their consent. But who authorised, or who could\r\nauthorise, the Parliament of 1688 to control and take away the freedom\r\nof posterity (who were not in existence to give or to withhold their\r\nconsent) and limit and confine their right of acting in certain cases\r\nfor ever?\r\n\r\nA greater absurdity cannot present itself to the understanding of man\r\nthan what Mr. Burke offers to his readers. He tells them, and he tells\r\nthe world to come, that a certain body of men who existed a hundred\r\nyears ago made a law, and that there does not exist in the nation, nor\r\never will, nor ever can, a power to alter it. Under how many subtilties\r\nor absurdities has the divine right to govern been imposed on the\r\ncredulity of mankind? Mr. Burke has discovered a new one, and he\r\nhas shortened his journey to Rome by appealing to the power of this\r\ninfallible Parliament of former days, and he produces what it has done\r\nas of divine authority, for that power must certainly be more than human\r\nwhich no human power to the end of time can alter.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Burke has done some service--not to his cause, but to his\r\ncountry--by bringing those clauses into public view. They serve to\r\ndemonstrate how necessary it is at all times to watch against the\r\nattempted encroachment of power, and to prevent its running to excess.\r\nIt is somewhat extraordinary that the offence for which James II. was\r\nexpelled, that of setting up power by assumption, should be re-acted,\r\nunder another shape and form, by the Parliament that expelled him. It\r\nshows that the Rights of Man were but imperfectly understood at the\r\nRevolution, for certain it is that the right which that Parliament set\r\nup by assumption (for by the delegation it had not, and could not\r\nhave it, because none could give it) over the persons and freedom of\r\nposterity for ever was of the same tyrannical unfounded kind which James\r\nattempted to set up over the Parliament and the nation, and for which he\r\nwas expelled. The only difference is (for in principle they differ not)\r\nthat the one was an usurper over living, and the other over the unborn;\r\nand as the one has no better authority to stand upon than the other,\r\nboth of them must be equally null and void, and of no effect.\r\n\r\nFrom what, or from whence, does Mr. Burke prove the right of any human\r\npower to bind posterity for ever? He has produced his clauses, but he\r\nmust produce also his proofs that such a right existed, and show how it\r\nexisted. If it ever existed it must now exist, for whatever appertains\r\nto the nature of man cannot be annihilated by man. It is the nature of\r\nman to die, and he will continue to die as long as he continues to be\r\nborn. But Mr. Burke has set up a sort of political Adam, in whom all\r\nposterity are bound for ever. He must, therefore, prove that his Adam\r\npossessed such a power, or such a right.\r\n\r\nThe weaker any cord is, the less will it bear to be stretched, and the\r\nworse is the policy to stretch it, unless it is intended to break it.\r\nHad anyone proposed the overthrow of Mr. Burke's positions, he would\r\nhave proceeded as Mr. Burke has done. He would have magnified the\r\nauthorities, on purpose to have called the right of them into question;\r\nand the instant the question of right was started, the authorities must\r\nhave been given up.\r\n\r\nIt requires but a very small glance of thought to perceive that although\r\nlaws made in one generation often continue in force through succeeding\r\ngenerations, yet they continue to derive their force from the consent of\r\nthe living. A law not repealed continues in force, not because it cannot\r\nbe repealed, but because it is not repealed; and the non-repealing\r\npasses for consent.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Burke's clauses have not even this qualification in their\r\nfavour. They become null, by attempting to become immortal. The nature\r\nof them precludes consent. They destroy the right which they might have,\r\nby grounding it on a right which they cannot have. Immortal power is\r\nnot a human right, and therefore cannot be a right of Parliament. The\r\nParliament of 1688 might as well have passed an act to have authorised\r\nthemselves to live for ever, as to make their authority live for ever.\r\nAll, therefore, that can be said of those clauses is that they are a\r\nformality of words, of as much import as if those who used them had\r\naddressed a congratulation to themselves, and in the oriental style of\r\nantiquity had said: O Parliament, live for ever!\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the world are continually changing, and the\r\nopinions of men change also; and as government is for the living, and\r\nnot for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it.\r\nThat which may be thought right and found convenient in one age may be\r\nthought wrong and found inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is\r\nto decide, the living or the dead?\r\n\r\nAs almost one hundred pages of Mr. Burke's book are employed upon these\r\nclauses, it will consequently follow that if the clauses themselves, so\r\nfar as they set up an assumed usurped dominion over posterity for ever,\r\nare unauthoritative, and in their nature null and void; that all his\r\nvoluminous inferences, and declamation drawn therefrom, or founded\r\nthereon, are null and void also; and on this ground I rest the matter.\r\n\r\nWe now come more particularly to the affairs of France. Mr. Burke's book\r\nhas the appearance of being written as instruction to the French nation;\r\nbut if I may permit myself the use of an extravagant metaphor, suited\r\nto the extravagance of the case, it is darkness attempting to illuminate\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWhile I am writing this there are accidentally before me some proposals\r\nfor a declaration of rights by the Marquis de la Fayette (I ask his\r\npardon for using his former address, and do it only for distinction's\r\nsake) to the National Assembly, on the 11th of July, 1789, three\r\ndays before the taking of the Bastille, and I cannot but remark with\r\nastonishment how opposite the sources are from which that gentleman and\r\nMr. Burke draw their principles. Instead of referring to musty records\r\nand mouldy parchments to prove that the rights of the living are lost,\r\n\"renounced and abdicated for ever,\" by those who are now no more, as\r\nMr. Burke has done, M. de la Fayette applies to the living world,\r\nand emphatically says: \"Call to mind the sentiments which nature has\r\nengraved on the heart of every citizen, and which take a new force when\r\nthey are solemnly recognised by all:--For a nation to love liberty, it\r\nis sufficient that she knows it; and to be free, it is sufficient that\r\nshe wills it.\" How dry, barren, and obscure is the source from which Mr.\r\nBurke labors! and how ineffectual, though gay with flowers, are all his\r\ndeclamation and his arguments compared with these clear, concise, and\r\nsoul-animating sentiments! Few and short as they are, they lead on to a\r\nvast field of generous and manly thinking, and do not finish, like Mr.\r\nBurke's periods, with music in the ear, and nothing in the heart.\r\n\r\nAs I have introduced M. de la Fayette, I will take the liberty of adding\r\nan anecdote respecting his farewell address to the Congress of America\r\nin 1783, and which occurred fresh to my mind, when I saw Mr. Burke's\r\nthundering attack on the French Revolution. M. de la Fayette went to\r\nAmerica at the early period of the war, and continued a volunteer in her\r\nservice to the end. His conduct through the whole of that enterprise is\r\none of the most extraordinary that is to be found in the history of a\r\nyoung man, scarcely twenty years of age. Situated in a country that was\r\nlike the lap of sensual pleasure, and with the means of enjoying it, how\r\nfew are there to be found who would exchange such a scene for the woods\r\nand wildernesses of America, and pass the flowery years of youth in\r\nunprofitable danger and hardship! but such is the fact. When the\r\nwar ended, and he was on the point of taking his final departure, he\r\npresented himself to Congress, and contemplating in his affectionate\r\nfarewell the Revolution he had seen, expressed himself in these words:\r\n\"May this great monument raised to liberty serve as a lesson to the\r\noppressor, and an example to the oppressed!\" When this address came to\r\nthe hands of Dr. Franklin, who was then in France, he applied to Count\r\nVergennes to have it inserted in the French Gazette, but never\r\ncould obtain his consent. The fact was that Count Vergennes was an\r\naristocratical despot at home, and dreaded the example of the American\r\nRevolution in France, as certain other persons now dread the example of\r\nthe French Revolution in England, and Mr. Burke's tribute of fear (for\r\nin this light his book must be considered) runs parallel with Count\r\nVergennes' refusal. But to return more particularly to his work.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen,\" says Mr. Burke, \"the French rebel against a mild and\r\nlawful monarch, with more fury, outrage, and insult, than any people\r\nhas been known to rise against the most illegal usurper, or the most\r\nsanguinary tyrant.\" This is one among a thousand other instances, in\r\nwhich Mr. Burke shows that he is ignorant of the springs and principles\r\nof the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt was not against Louis XVI. but against the despotic principles of\r\nthe Government, that the nation revolted. These principles had not their\r\norigin in him, but in the original establishment, many centuries back:\r\nand they were become too deeply rooted to be removed, and the Augean\r\nstables of parasites and plunderers too abominably filthy to be cleansed\r\nby anything short of a complete and universal Revolution. When it\r\nbecomes necessary to do anything, the whole heart and soul should go\r\ninto the measure, or not attempt it. That crisis was then arrived, and\r\nthere remained no choice but to act with determined vigor, or not to\r\nact at all. The king was known to be the friend of the nation, and this\r\ncircumstance was favorable to the enterprise. Perhaps no man bred up in\r\nthe style of an absolute king, ever possessed a heart so little disposed\r\nto the exercise of that species of power as the present King of France.\r\nBut the principles of the Government itself still remained the same. The\r\nMonarch and the Monarchy were distinct and separate things; and it was\r\nagainst the established despotism of the latter, and not against the\r\nperson or principles of the former, that the revolt commenced, and the\r\nRevolution has been carried.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke does not attend to the distinction between men and principles,\r\nand, therefore, he does not see that a revolt may take place against the\r\ndespotism of the latter, while there lies no charge of despotism against\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThe natural moderation of Louis XVI. contributed nothing to alter\r\nthe hereditary despotism of the monarchy. All the tyrannies of former\r\nreigns, acted under that hereditary despotism, were still liable to be\r\nrevived in the hands of a successor. It was not the respite of a reign\r\nthat would satisfy France, enlightened as she was then become. A casual\r\ndiscontinuance of the practice of despotism, is not a discontinuance of\r\nits principles: the former depends on the virtue of the individual who\r\nis in immediate possession of the power; the latter, on the virtue and\r\nfortitude of the nation. In the case of Charles I. and James II. of\r\nEngland, the revolt was against the personal despotism of the men;\r\nwhereas in France, it was against the hereditary despotism of the\r\nestablished Government. But men who can consign over the rights of\r\nposterity for ever on the authority of a mouldy parchment, like Mr.\r\nBurke, are not qualified to judge of this Revolution. It takes in\r\na field too vast for their views to explore, and proceeds with a\r\nmightiness of reason they cannot keep pace with.\r\n\r\nBut there are many points of view in which this Revolution may be\r\nconsidered. When despotism has established itself for ages in a country,\r\nas in France, it is not in the person of the king only that it resides.\r\nIt has the appearance of being so in show, and in nominal authority; but\r\nit is not so in practice and in fact. It has its standard everywhere.\r\nEvery office and department has its despotism, founded upon custom and\r\nusage. Every place has its Bastille, and every Bastille its despot.\r\nThe original hereditary despotism resident in the person of the king,\r\ndivides and sub-divides itself into a thousand shapes and forms, till\r\nat last the whole of it is acted by deputation. This was the case in\r\nFrance; and against this species of despotism, proceeding on through\r\nan endless labyrinth of office till the source of it is scarcely\r\nperceptible, there is no mode of redress. It strengthens itself by\r\nassuming the appearance of duty, and tyrannies under the pretence of\r\nobeying.\r\n\r\nWhen a man reflects on the condition which France was in from the nature\r\nof her government, he will see other causes for revolt than those which\r\nimmediately connect themselves with the person or character of Louis\r\nXVI. There were, if I may so express it, a thousand despotisms to be\r\nreformed in France, which had grown up under the hereditary despotism\r\nof the monarchy, and became so rooted as to be in a great measure\r\nindependent of it. Between the Monarchy, the Parliament, and the\r\nChurch there was a rivalship of despotism; besides the feudal despotism\r\noperating locally, and the ministerial despotism operating everywhere.\r\nBut Mr. Burke, by considering the king as the only possible object of\r\na revolt, speaks as if France was a village, in which everything that\r\npassed must be known to its commanding officer, and no oppression could\r\nbe acted but what he could immediately control. Mr. Burke might have\r\nbeen in the Bastille his whole life, as well under Louis XVI. as Louis\r\nXIV., and neither the one nor the other have known that such a man as\r\nBurke existed. The despotic principles of the government were the same\r\nin both reigns, though the dispositions of the men were as remote as\r\ntyranny and benevolence.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Burke considers as a reproach to the French Revolution (that of\r\nbringing it forward under a reign more mild than the preceding ones)\r\nis one of its highest honors. The Revolutions that have taken place in\r\nother European countries, have been excited by personal hatred. The rage\r\nwas against the man, and he became the victim. But, in the instance of\r\nFrance we see a Revolution generated in the rational contemplation of\r\nthe Rights of Man, and distinguishing from the beginning between persons\r\nand principles.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Burke appears to have no idea of principles when he is\r\ncontemplating Governments. \"Ten years ago,\" says he, \"I could have\r\nfelicitated France on her having a Government, without inquiring what\r\nthe nature of that Government was, or how it was administered.\" Is this\r\nthe language of a rational man? Is it the language of a heart feeling as\r\nit ought to feel for the rights and happiness of the human race? On\r\nthis ground, Mr. Burke must compliment all the Governments in the world,\r\nwhile the victims who suffer under them, whether sold into slavery, or\r\ntortured out of existence, are wholly forgotten. It is power, and\r\nnot principles, that Mr. Burke venerates; and under this abominable\r\ndepravity he is disqualified to judge between them. Thus much for his\r\nopinion as to the occasions of the French Revolution. I now proceed to\r\nother considerations.\r\n\r\nI know a place in America called Point-no-Point, because as you proceed\r\nalong the shore, gay and flowery as Mr. Burke's language, it continually\r\nrecedes and presents itself at a distance before you; but when you have\r\ngot as far as you can go, there is no point at all. Just thus it is with\r\nMr. Burke's three hundred and sixty-six pages. It is therefore difficult\r\nto reply to him. But as the points he wishes to establish may be\r\ninferred from what he abuses, it is in his paradoxes that we must look\r\nfor his arguments.\r\n\r\nAs to the tragic paintings by which Mr. Burke has outraged his own\r\nimagination, and seeks to work upon that of his readers, they are\r\nvery well calculated for theatrical representation, where facts are\r\nmanufactured for the sake of show, and accommodated to produce, through\r\nthe weakness of sympathy, a weeping effect. But Mr. Burke should\r\nrecollect that he is writing history, and not plays, and that his\r\nreaders will expect truth, and not the spouting rant of high-toned\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a man dramatically lamenting in a publication intended to be\r\nbelieved that \"The age of chivalry is gone! that The glory of Europe is\r\nextinguished for ever! that The unbought grace of life (if anyone knows\r\nwhat it is), the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment\r\nand heroic enterprise is gone!\" and all this because the Quixot age of\r\nchivalry nonsense is gone, what opinion can we form of his judgment, or\r\nwhat regard can we pay to his facts? In the rhapsody of his imagination\r\nhe has discovered a world of wind mills, and his sorrows are that there\r\nare no Quixots to attack them. But if the age of aristocracy, like that\r\nof chivalry, should fall (and they had originally some connection) Mr.\r\nBurke, the trumpeter of the Order, may continue his parody to the end,\r\nand finish with exclaiming: \"Othello's occupation's gone!\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Mr. Burke's horrid paintings, when the French Revolution\r\nis compared with the Revolutions of other countries, the astonishment\r\nwill be that it is marked with so few sacrifices; but this astonishment\r\nwill cease when we reflect that principles, and not persons, were the\r\nmeditated objects of destruction. The mind of the nation was acted\r\nupon by a higher stimulus than what the consideration of persons could\r\ninspire, and sought a higher conquest than could be produced by the\r\ndownfall of an enemy. Among the few who fell there do not appear to be\r\nany that were intentionally singled out. They all of them had their fate\r\nin the circumstances of the moment, and were not pursued with that long,\r\ncold-blooded unabated revenge which pursued the unfortunate Scotch in\r\nthe affair of 1745.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of Mr. Burke's book I do not observe that the Bastille\r\nis mentioned more than once, and that with a kind of implication as if\r\nhe were sorry it was pulled down, and wished it were built up again. \"We\r\nhave rebuilt Newgate,\" says he, \"and tenanted the mansion; and we have\r\nprisons almost as strong as the Bastille for those who dare to libel the\r\nqueens of France.\"*[2] As to what a madman like the person called Lord\r\nGeorge Gordon might say, and to whom Newgate is rather a bedlam than a\r\nprison, it is unworthy a rational consideration. It was a madman that\r\nlibelled, and that is sufficient apology; and it afforded an opportunity\r\nfor confining him, which was the thing that was wished for. But certain\r\nit is that Mr. Burke, who does not call himself a madman (whatever other\r\npeople may do), has libelled in the most unprovoked manner, and in\r\nthe grossest style of the most vulgar abuse, the whole representative\r\nauthority of France, and yet Mr. Burke takes his seat in the British\r\nHouse of Commons! From his violence and his grief, his silence on some\r\npoints and his excess on others, it is difficult not to believe that Mr.\r\nBurke is sorry, extremely sorry, that arbitrary power, the power of the\r\nPope and the Bastille, are pulled down.\r\n\r\nNot one glance of compassion, not one commiserating reflection that I\r\ncan find throughout his book, has he bestowed on those who lingered out\r\nthe most wretched of lives, a life without hope in the most miserable of\r\nprisons. It is painful to behold a man employing his talents to corrupt\r\nhimself. Nature has been kinder to Mr. Burke than he is to her. He is\r\nnot affected by the reality of distress touching his heart, but by the\r\nshowy resemblance of it striking his imagination. He pities the plumage,\r\nbut forgets the dying bird. Accustomed to kiss the aristocratical hand\r\nthat hath purloined him from himself, he degenerates into a composition\r\nof art, and the genuine soul of nature forsakes him. His hero or his\r\nheroine must be a tragedy-victim expiring in show, and not the real\r\nprisoner of misery, sliding into death in the silence of a dungeon.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Burke has passed over the whole transaction of the Bastille (and\r\nhis silence is nothing in his favour), and has entertained his readers\r\nwith refections on supposed facts distorted into real falsehoods, I will\r\ngive, since he has not, some account of the circumstances which preceded\r\nthat transaction. They will serve to show that less mischief could\r\nscarcely have accompanied such an event when considered with the\r\ntreacherous and hostile aggravations of the enemies of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe mind can hardly picture to itself a more tremendous scene than what\r\nthe city of Paris exhibited at the time of taking the Bastille, and for\r\ntwo days before and after, nor perceive the possibility of its quieting\r\nso soon. At a distance this transaction has appeared only as an act of\r\nheroism standing on itself, and the close political connection it had\r\nwith the Revolution is lost in the brilliancy of the achievement. But\r\nwe are to consider it as the strength of the parties brought man to man,\r\nand contending for the issue. The Bastille was to be either the prize\r\nor the prison of the assailants. The downfall of it included the idea\r\nof the downfall of despotism, and this compounded image was become as\r\nfiguratively united as Bunyan's Doubting Castle and Giant Despair.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly, before and at the time of taking the Bastille,\r\nwas sitting at Versailles, twelve miles distant from Paris. About a week\r\nbefore the rising of the Partisans, and their taking the Bastille, it\r\nwas discovered that a plot was forming, at the head of which was\r\nthe Count D'Artois, the king's youngest brother, for demolishing the\r\nNational Assembly, seizing its members, and thereby crushing, by a coup\r\nde main, all hopes and prospects of forming a free government. For\r\nthe sake of humanity, as well as freedom, it is well this plan did not\r\nsucceed. Examples are not wanting to show how dreadfully vindictive and\r\ncruel are all old governments, when they are successful against what\r\nthey call a revolt.\r\n\r\nThis plan must have been some time in contemplation; because, in order\r\nto carry it into execution, it was necessary to collect a large military\r\nforce round Paris, and cut off the communication between that city\r\nand the National Assembly at Versailles. The troops destined for this\r\nservice were chiefly the foreign troops in the pay of France, and who,\r\nfor this particular purpose, were drawn from the distant provinces where\r\nthey were then stationed. When they were collected to the amount of\r\nbetween twenty-five and thirty thousand, it was judged time to put the\r\nplan into execution. The ministry who were then in office, and who were\r\nfriendly to the Revolution, were instantly dismissed and a new ministry\r\nformed of those who had concerted the project, among whom was Count de\r\nBroglio, and to his share was given the command of those troops.\r\nThe character of this man as described to me in a letter which I\r\ncommunicated to Mr. Burke before he began to write his book, and from\r\nan authority which Mr. Burke well knows was good, was that of \"a\r\nhigh-flying aristocrat, cool, and capable of every mischief.\"\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were agitating, the National Assembly stood in the\r\nmost perilous and critical situation that a body of men can be supposed\r\nto act in. They were the devoted victims, and they knew it. They had the\r\nhearts and wishes of their country on their side, but military authority\r\nthey had none. The guards of Broglio surrounded the hall where the\r\nAssembly sat, ready, at the word of command, to seize their persons,\r\nas had been done the year before to the Parliament of Paris. Had the\r\nNational Assembly deserted their trust, or had they exhibited signs of\r\nweakness or fear, their enemies had been encouraged and their country\r\ndepressed. When the situation they stood in, the cause they were engaged\r\nin, and the crisis then ready to burst, which should determine their\r\npersonal and political fate and that of their country, and probably of\r\nEurope, are taken into one view, none but a heart callous with prejudice\r\nor corrupted by dependence can avoid interesting itself in their\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Vienne was at this time President of the National\r\nAssembly--a person too old to undergo the scene that a few days or a few\r\nhours might bring forth. A man of more activity and bolder fortitude\r\nwas necessary, and the National Assembly chose (under the form of a\r\nVice-President, for the Presidency still resided in the Archbishop) M.\r\nde la Fayette; and this is the only instance of a Vice-President being\r\nchosen. It was at the moment that this storm was pending (July 11th)\r\nthat a declaration of rights was brought forward by M. de la Fayette,\r\nand is the same which is alluded to earlier. It was hastily drawn up,\r\nand makes only a part of the more extensive declaration of rights agreed\r\nupon and adopted afterwards by the National Assembly. The particular\r\nreason for bringing it forward at this moment (M. de la Fayette has\r\nsince informed me) was that, if the National Assembly should fall in\r\nthe threatened destruction that then surrounded it, some trace of its\r\nprinciples might have the chance of surviving the wreck.\r\n\r\nEverything now was drawing to a crisis. The event was freedom or\r\nslavery. On one side, an army of nearly thirty thousand men; on the\r\nother, an unarmed body of citizens--for the citizens of Paris, on whom\r\nthe National Assembly must then immediately depend, were as unarmed and\r\nas undisciplined as the citizens of London are now. The French guards\r\nhad given strong symptoms of their being attached to the national cause;\r\nbut their numbers were small, not a tenth part of the force that Broglio\r\ncommanded, and their officers were in the interest of Broglio.\r\n\r\nMatters being now ripe for execution, the new ministry made their\r\nappearance in office. The reader will carry in his mind that the\r\nBastille was taken the 14th July; the point of time I am now speaking of\r\nis the 12th. Immediately on the news of the change of ministry reaching\r\nParis, in the afternoon, all the playhouses and places of entertainment,\r\nshops and houses, were shut up. The change of ministry was considered as\r\nthe prelude of hostilities, and the opinion was rightly founded.\r\n\r\nThe foreign troops began to advance towards the city. The Prince de\r\nLambesc, who commanded a body of German cavalry, approached by the Place\r\nof Louis Xv., which connects itself with some of the streets. In his\r\nmarch, he insulted and struck an old man with a sword. The French are\r\nremarkable for their respect to old age; and the insolence with which it\r\nappeared to be done, uniting with the general fermentation they were\r\nin, produced a powerful effect, and a cry of \"To arms! to arms!\" spread\r\nitself in a moment over the city.\r\n\r\nArms they had none, nor scarcely anyone who knew the use of them; but\r\ndesperate resolution, when every hope is at stake, supplies, for a\r\nwhile, the want of arms. Near where the Prince de Lambesc was drawn up,\r\nwere large piles of stones collected for building the new bridge, and\r\nwith these the people attacked the cavalry. A party of French guards\r\nupon hearing the firing, rushed from their quarters and joined the\r\npeople; and night coming on, the cavalry retreated.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Paris, being narrow, are favourable for defence, and the\r\nloftiness of the houses, consisting of many stories, from which great\r\nannoyance might be given, secured them against nocturnal enterprises;\r\nand the night was spent in providing themselves with every sort of\r\nweapon they could make or procure: guns, swords, blacksmiths' hammers,\r\ncarpenters' axes, iron crows, pikes, halberts, pitchforks, spits, clubs,\r\netc., etc. The incredible numbers in which they assembled the next\r\nmorning, and the still more incredible resolution they exhibited,\r\nembarrassed and astonished their enemies. Little did the new ministry\r\nexpect such a salute. Accustomed to slavery themselves, they had no idea\r\nthat liberty was capable of such inspiration, or that a body of unarmed\r\ncitizens would dare to face the military force of thirty thousand men.\r\nEvery moment of this day was employed in collecting arms, concerting\r\nplans, and arranging themselves into the best order which such an\r\ninstantaneous movement could afford. Broglio continued lying round the\r\ncity, but made no further advances this day, and the succeeding night\r\npassed with as much tranquility as such a scene could possibly produce.\r\n\r\nBut defence only was not the object of the citizens. They had a cause\r\nat stake, on which depended their freedom or their slavery. They every\r\nmoment expected an attack, or to hear of one made on the National\r\nAssembly; and in such a situation, the most prompt measures are\r\nsometimes the best. The object that now presented itself was the\r\nBastille; and the eclat of carrying such a fortress in the face of such\r\nan army, could not fail to strike terror into the new ministry, who had\r\nscarcely yet had time to meet. By some intercepted correspondence this\r\nmorning, it was discovered that the Mayor of Paris, M. Defflesselles,\r\nwho appeared to be in the interest of the citizens, was betraying them;\r\nand from this discovery, there remained no doubt that Broglio would\r\nreinforce the Bastille the ensuing evening. It was therefore necessary\r\nto attack it that day; but before this could be done, it was first\r\nnecessary to procure a better supply of arms than they were then\r\npossessed of.\r\n\r\nThere was, adjoining to the city a large magazine of arms deposited at\r\nthe Hospital of the Invalids, which the citizens summoned to surrender;\r\nand as the place was neither defensible, nor attempted much defence,\r\nthey soon succeeded. Thus supplied, they marched to attack the Bastille;\r\na vast mixed multitude of all ages, and of all degrees, armed with all\r\nsorts of weapons. Imagination would fail in describing to itself the\r\nappearance of such a procession, and of the anxiety of the events which\r\na few hours or a few minutes might produce. What plans the ministry\r\nwere forming, were as unknown to the people within the city, as what\r\nthe citizens were doing was unknown to the ministry; and what movements\r\nBroglio might make for the support or relief of the place, were to the\r\ncitizens equally as unknown. All was mystery and hazard.\r\n\r\nThat the Bastille was attacked with an enthusiasm of heroism, such only\r\nas the highest animation of liberty could inspire, and carried in the\r\nspace of a few hours, is an event which the world is fully possessed of.\r\nI am not undertaking the detail of the attack, but bringing into view\r\nthe conspiracy against the nation which provoked it, and which fell\r\nwith the Bastille. The prison to which the new ministry were dooming the\r\nNational Assembly, in addition to its being the high altar and castle of\r\ndespotism, became the proper object to begin with. This enterprise\r\nbroke up the new ministry, who began now to fly from the ruin they had\r\nprepared for others. The troops of Broglio dispersed, and himself fled\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke has spoken a great deal about plots, but he has never once\r\nspoken of this plot against the National Assembly, and the liberties\r\nof the nation; and that he might not, he has passed over all the\r\ncircumstances that might throw it in his way. The exiles who have fled\r\nfrom France, whose case he so much interests himself in, and from whom\r\nhe has had his lesson, fled in consequence of the miscarriage of this\r\nplot. No plot was formed against them; they were plotting against\r\nothers; and those who fell, met, not unjustly, the punishment they\r\nwere preparing to execute. But will Mr. Burke say that if this plot,\r\ncontrived with the subtilty of an ambuscade, had succeeded, the\r\nsuccessful party would have restrained their wrath so soon? Let the\r\nhistory of all governments answer the question.\r\n\r\nWhom has the National Assembly brought to the scaffold? None. They\r\nwere themselves the devoted victims of this plot, and they have not\r\nretaliated; why, then, are they charged with revenge they have not\r\nacted? In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all\r\ndegrees, tempers and characters are confounded, delivering themselves,\r\nby a miracle of exertion, from the destruction meditated against them,\r\nis it to be expected that nothing will happen? When men are sore with\r\nthe sense of oppressions, and menaced with the prospects of new ones,\r\nis the calmness of philosophy or the palsy of insensibility to be looked\r\nfor? Mr. Burke exclaims against outrage; yet the greatest is that which\r\nhimself has committed. His book is a volume of outrage, not apologised\r\nfor by the impulse of a moment, but cherished through a space of ten\r\nmonths; yet Mr. Burke had no provocation--no life, no interest, at\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nMore of the citizens fell in this struggle than of their opponents: but\r\nfour or five persons were seized by the populace, and instantly put to\r\ndeath; the Governor of the Bastille, and the Mayor of Paris, who was\r\ndetected in the act of betraying them; and afterwards Foulon, one of the\r\nnew ministry, and Berthier, his son-in-law, who had accepted the office\r\nof intendant of Paris. Their heads were stuck upon spikes, and carried\r\nabout the city; and it is upon this mode of punishment that Mr. Burke\r\nbuilds a great part of his tragic scene. Let us therefore examine how\r\nmen came by the idea of punishing in this manner.\r\n\r\nThey learn it from the governments they live under; and retaliate the\r\npunishments they have been accustomed to behold. The heads stuck upon\r\nspikes, which remained for years upon Temple Bar, differed nothing in\r\nthe horror of the scene from those carried about upon spikes at Paris;\r\nyet this was done by the English Government. It may perhaps be said that\r\nit signifies nothing to a man what is done to him after he is dead; but\r\nit signifies much to the living; it either tortures their feelings or\r\nhardens their hearts, and in either case it instructs them how to punish\r\nwhen power falls into their hands.\r\n\r\nLay then the axe to the root, and teach governments humanity. It is\r\ntheir sanguinary punishments which corrupt mankind. In England the\r\npunishment in certain cases is by hanging, drawing and quartering;\r\nthe heart of the sufferer is cut out and held up to the view of the\r\npopulace. In France, under the former Government, the punishments were\r\nnot less barbarous. Who does not remember the execution of Damien, torn\r\nto pieces by horses? The effect of those cruel spectacles exhibited to\r\nthe populace is to destroy tenderness or excite revenge; and by the\r\nbase and false idea of governing men by terror, instead of reason,\r\nthey become precedents. It is over the lowest class of mankind that\r\ngovernment by terror is intended to operate, and it is on them that it\r\noperates to the worst effect. They have sense enough to feel they are\r\nthe objects aimed at; and they inflict in their turn the examples of\r\nterror they have been instructed to practise.\r\n\r\nThere is in all European countries a large class of people of that\r\ndescription, which in England is called the \"mob.\" Of this class were\r\nthose who committed the burnings and devastations in London in 1780, and\r\nof this class were those who carried the heads on iron spikes in Paris.\r\nFoulon and Berthier were taken up in the country, and sent to Paris,\r\nto undergo their examination at the Hotel de Ville; for the National\r\nAssembly, immediately on the new ministry coming into office, passed a\r\ndecree, which they communicated to the King and Cabinet, that they (the\r\nNational Assembly) would hold the ministry, of which Foulon was one,\r\nresponsible for the measures they were advising and pursuing; but the\r\nmob, incensed at the appearance of Foulon and Berthier, tore them from\r\ntheir conductors before they were carried to the Hotel de Ville, and\r\nexecuted them on the spot. Why then does Mr. Burke charge outrages\r\nof this kind on a whole people? As well may he charge the riots and\r\noutrages of 1780 on all the people of London, or those in Ireland on all\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\nBut everything we see or hear offensive to our feelings and derogatory\r\nto the human character should lead to other reflections than those\r\nof reproach. Even the beings who commit them have some claim to our\r\nconsideration. How then is it that such vast classes of mankind as are\r\ndistinguished by the appellation of the vulgar, or the ignorant mob,\r\nare so numerous in all old countries? The instant we ask ourselves\r\nthis question, reflection feels an answer. They rise, as an unavoidable\r\nconsequence, out of the ill construction of all old governments in\r\nEurope, England included with the rest. It is by distortedly exalting\r\nsome men, that others are distortedly debased, till the whole is out\r\nof nature. A vast mass of mankind are degradedly thrown into the\r\nback-ground of the human picture, to bring forward, with greater glare,\r\nthe puppet-show of state and aristocracy. In the commencement of a\r\nrevolution, those men are rather the followers of the camp than of the\r\nstandard of liberty, and have yet to be instructed how to reverence it.\r\n\r\nI give to Mr. Burke all his theatrical exaggerations for facts, and I\r\nthen ask him if they do not establish the certainty of what I here lay\r\ndown? Admitting them to be true, they show the necessity of the French\r\nRevolution, as much as any one thing he could have asserted. These\r\noutrages were not the effect of the principles of the Revolution, but\r\nof the degraded mind that existed before the Revolution, and which the\r\nRevolution is calculated to reform. Place them then to their proper\r\ncause, and take the reproach of them to your own side.\r\n\r\nIt is the honour of the National Assembly and the city of Paris that,\r\nduring such a tremendous scene of arms and confusion, beyond the control\r\nof all authority, they have been able, by the influence of example\r\nand exhortation, to restrain so much. Never were more pains taken to\r\ninstruct and enlighten mankind, and to make them see that their interest\r\nconsisted in their virtue, and not in their revenge, than have been\r\ndisplayed in the Revolution of France. I now proceed to make some\r\nremarks on Mr. Burke's account of the expedition to Versailles, October\r\nthe 5th and 6th.\r\n\r\nI can consider Mr. Burke's book in scarcely any other light than a\r\ndramatic performance; and he must, I think, have considered it in the\r\nsame light himself, by the poetical liberties he has taken of omitting\r\nsome facts, distorting others, and making the whole machinery bend to\r\nproduce a stage effect. Of this kind is his account of the expedition to\r\nVersailles. He begins this account by omitting the only facts which as\r\ncauses are known to be true; everything beyond these is conjecture, even\r\nin Paris; and he then works up a tale accommodated to his own passions\r\nand prejudices.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed throughout Mr. Burke's book that he never speaks\r\nof plots against the Revolution; and it is from those plots that all the\r\nmischiefs have arisen. It suits his purpose to exhibit the consequences\r\nwithout their causes. It is one of the arts of the drama to do so. If\r\nthe crimes of men were exhibited with their sufferings, stage effect\r\nwould sometimes be lost, and the audience would be inclined to approve\r\nwhere it was intended they should commiserate.\r\n\r\nAfter all the investigations that have been made into this intricate\r\naffair (the expedition to Versailles), it still remains enveloped in all\r\nthat kind of mystery which ever accompanies events produced more from a\r\nconcurrence of awkward circumstances than from fixed design. While the\r\ncharacters of men are forming, as is always the case in revolutions,\r\nthere is a reciprocal suspicion, and a disposition to misinterpret each\r\nother; and even parties directly opposite in principle will sometimes\r\nconcur in pushing forward the same movement with very different views,\r\nand with the hopes of its producing very different consequences. A great\r\ndeal of this may be discovered in this embarrassed affair, and yet the\r\nissue of the whole was what nobody had in view.\r\n\r\nThe only things certainly known are that considerable uneasiness was at\r\nthis time excited at Paris by the delay of the King in not sanctioning\r\nand forwarding the decrees of the National Assembly, particularly that\r\nof the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and the decrees of the fourth\r\nof August, which contained the foundation principles on which the\r\nconstitution was to be erected. The kindest, and perhaps the fairest\r\nconjecture upon this matter is, that some of the ministers intended to\r\nmake remarks and observations upon certain parts of them before they\r\nwere finally sanctioned and sent to the provinces; but be this as it\r\nmay, the enemies of the Revolution derived hope from the delay, and the\r\nfriends of the Revolution uneasiness.\r\n\r\nDuring this state of suspense, the Garde du Corps, which was composed as\r\nsuch regiments generally are, of persons much connected with the\r\nCourt, gave an entertainment at Versailles (October 1) to some foreign\r\nregiments then arrived; and when the entertainment was at the height, on\r\na signal given, the Garde du Corps tore the national cockade from their\r\nhats, trampled it under foot, and replaced it with a counter-cockade\r\nprepared for the purpose. An indignity of this kind amounted to\r\ndefiance. It was like declaring war; and if men will give challenges\r\nthey must expect consequences. But all this Mr. Burke has carefully kept\r\nout of sight. He begins his account by saying: \"History will record that\r\non the morning of the 6th October, 1789, the King and Queen of France,\r\nafter a day of confusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay down under\r\nthe pledged security of public faith to indulge nature in a few hours\r\nof respite, and troubled melancholy repose.\" This is neither the sober\r\nstyle of history, nor the intention of it. It leaves everything to\r\nbe guessed at and mistaken. One would at least think there had been a\r\nbattle; and a battle there probably would have been had it not been\r\nfor the moderating prudence of those whom Mr. Burke involves in his\r\ncensures. By his keeping the Garde du Corps out of sight Mr. Burke has\r\nafforded himself the dramatic licence of putting the King and Queen in\r\ntheir places, as if the object of the expedition was against them. But\r\nto return to my account this conduct of the Garde du Corps, as might\r\nwell be expected, alarmed and enraged the Partisans. The colors of\r\nthe cause, and the cause itself, were become too united to mistake the\r\nintention of the insult, and the Partisans were determined to call\r\nthe Garde du Corps to an account. There was certainly nothing of the\r\ncowardice of assassination in marching in the face of the day to demand\r\nsatisfaction, if such a phrase may be used, of a body of armed men who\r\nhad voluntarily given defiance. But the circumstance which serves\r\nto throw this affair into embarrassment is, that the enemies of the\r\nRevolution appear to have encouraged it as well as its friends. The one\r\nhoped to prevent a civil war by checking it in time, and the other to\r\nmake one. The hopes of those opposed to the Revolution rested in making\r\nthe King of their party, and getting him from Versailles to Metz,\r\nwhere they expected to collect a force and set up a standard. We have,\r\ntherefore, two different objects presenting themselves at the same time,\r\nand to be accomplished by the same means: the one to chastise the Garde\r\ndu Corps, which was the object of the Partisans; the other to render the\r\nconfusion of such a scene an inducement to the King to set off for Metz.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October a very numerous body of women, and men in the\r\ndisguise of women, collected around the Hotel de Ville or town-hall at\r\nParis, and set off for Versailles. Their professed object was the Garde\r\ndu Corps; but prudent men readily recollect that mischief is more easily\r\nbegun than ended; and this impressed itself with the more force from the\r\nsuspicions already stated, and the irregularity of such a cavalcade.\r\nAs soon, therefore, as a sufficient force could be collected, M. de la\r\nFayette, by orders from the civil authority of Paris, set off after\r\nthem at the head of twenty thousand of the Paris militia. The Revolution\r\ncould derive no benefit from confusion, and its opposers might. By an\r\namiable and spirited manner of address he had hitherto been fortunate in\r\ncalming disquietudes, and in this he was extraordinarily successful; to\r\nfrustrate, therefore, the hopes of those who might seek to improve\r\nthis scene into a sort of justifiable necessity for the King's quitting\r\nVersailles and withdrawing to Metz, and to prevent at the same time\r\nthe consequences that might ensue between the Garde du Corps and this\r\nphalanx of men and women, he forwarded expresses to the King, that he\r\nwas on his march to Versailles, by the orders of the civil authority of\r\nParis, for the purpose of peace and protection, expressing at the same\r\ntime the necessity of restraining the Garde du Corps from firing upon\r\nthe people.*[3]\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Versailles between ten and eleven at night. The Garde du\r\nCorps was drawn up, and the people had arrived some time before, but\r\neverything had remained suspended. Wisdom and policy now consisted in\r\nchanging a scene of danger into a happy event. M. de la Fayette became\r\nthe mediator between the enraged parties; and the King, to remove the\r\nuneasiness which had arisen from the delay already stated, sent for the\r\nPresident of the National Assembly, and signed the Declaration of the\r\nRights of Man, and such other parts of the constitution as were in\r\nreadiness.\r\n\r\nIt was now about one in the morning. Everything appeared to be composed,\r\nand a general congratulation took place. By the beat of a drum a\r\nproclamation was made that the citizens of Versailles would give the\r\nhospitality of their houses to their fellow-citizens of Paris. Those\r\nwho could not be accommodated in this manner remained in the streets, or\r\ntook up their quarters in the churches; and at two o'clock the King and\r\nQueen retired.\r\n\r\nIn this state matters passed till the break of day, when a fresh\r\ndisturbance arose from the censurable conduct of some of both parties,\r\nfor such characters there will be in all such scenes. One of the Garde\r\ndu Corps appeared at one of the windows of the palace, and the people\r\nwho had remained during the night in the streets accosted him with\r\nreviling and provocative language. Instead of retiring, as in such a\r\ncase prudence would have dictated, he presented his musket, fired, and\r\nkilled one of the Paris militia. The peace being thus broken, the people\r\nrushed into the palace in quest of the offender. They attacked the\r\nquarters of the Garde du Corps within the palace, and pursued them\r\nthroughout the avenues of it, and to the apartments of the King. On this\r\ntumult, not the Queen only, as Mr. Burke has represented it, but every\r\nperson in the palace, was awakened and alarmed; and M. de la Fayette had\r\na second time to interpose between the parties, the event of which was\r\nthat the Garde du Corps put on the national cockade, and the matter\r\nended as by oblivion, after the loss of two or three lives.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the time in which this confusion was acting,\r\nthe King and Queen were in public at the balcony, and neither of them\r\nconcealed for safety's sake, as Mr. Burke insinuates. Matters being thus\r\nappeased, and tranquility restored, a general acclamation broke forth of\r\nLe Roi a Paris--Le Roi a Paris--The King to Paris. It was the shout of\r\npeace, and immediately accepted on the part of the King. By this measure\r\nall future projects of trapanning the King to Metz, and setting up the\r\nstandard of opposition to the constitution, were prevented, and the\r\nsuspicions extinguished. The King and his family reached Paris in the\r\nevening, and were congratulated on their arrival by M. Bailly, the Mayor\r\nof Paris, in the name of the citizens. Mr. Burke, who throughout his\r\nbook confounds things, persons, and principles, as in his remarks on\r\nM. Bailly's address, confounded time also. He censures M. Bailly for\r\ncalling it \"un bon jour,\" a good day. Mr. Burke should have informed\r\nhimself that this scene took up the space of two days, the day on which\r\nit began with every appearance of danger and mischief, and the day on\r\nwhich it terminated without the mischiefs that threatened; and that\r\nit is to this peaceful termination that M. Bailly alludes, and to the\r\narrival of the King at Paris. Not less than three hundred thousand\r\npersons arranged themselves in the procession from Versailles to Paris,\r\nand not an act of molestation was committed during the whole march.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke on the authority of M. Lally Tollendal, a deserter from the\r\nNational Assembly, says that on entering Paris, the people shouted \"Tous\r\nles eveques a la lanterne.\" All Bishops to be hanged at the lanthorn\r\nor lamp-posts. It is surprising that nobody could hear this but Lally\r\nTollendal, and that nobody should believe it but Mr. Burke. It has not\r\nthe least connection with any part of the transaction, and is totally\r\nforeign to every circumstance of it. The Bishops had never been\r\nintroduced before into any scene of Mr. Burke's drama: why then are\r\nthey, all at once, and altogether, tout a coup, et tous ensemble,\r\nintroduced now? Mr. Burke brings forward his Bishops and his\r\nlanthorn-like figures in a magic lanthorn, and raises his scenes by\r\ncontrast instead of connection. But it serves to show, with the rest of\r\nhis book what little credit ought to be given where even probability is\r\nset at defiance, for the purpose of defaming; and with this reflection,\r\ninstead of a soliloquy in praise of chivalry, as Mr. Burke has done, I\r\nclose the account of the expedition to Versailles.*[4]\r\n\r\nI have now to follow Mr. Burke through a pathless wilderness of\r\nrhapsodies, and a sort of descant upon governments, in which he asserts\r\nwhatever he pleases, on the presumption of its being believed, without\r\noffering either evidence or reasons for so doing.\r\n\r\nBefore anything can be reasoned upon to a conclusion, certain facts,\r\nprinciples, or data, to reason from, must be established, admitted, or\r\ndenied. Mr. Burke with his usual outrage, abused the Declaration of\r\nthe Rights of Man, published by the National Assembly of France, as\r\nthe basis on which the constitution of France is built. This he calls\r\n\"paltry and blurred sheets of paper about the rights of man.\" Does Mr.\r\nBurke mean to deny that man has any rights? If he does, then he must\r\nmean that there are no such things as rights anywhere, and that he has\r\nnone himself; for who is there in the world but man? But if Mr. Burke\r\nmeans to admit that man has rights, the question then will be: What are\r\nthose rights, and how man came by them originally?\r\n\r\nThe error of those who reason by precedents drawn from antiquity,\r\nrespecting the rights of man, is that they do not go far enough into\r\nantiquity. They do not go the whole way. They stop in some of the\r\nintermediate stages of an hundred or a thousand years, and produce what\r\nwas then done, as a rule for the present day. This is no authority at\r\nall. If we travel still farther into antiquity, we shall find a direct\r\ncontrary opinion and practice prevailing; and if antiquity is to be\r\nauthority, a thousand such authorities may be produced, successively\r\ncontradicting each other; but if we proceed on, we shall at last come\r\nout right; we shall come to the time when man came from the hand of his\r\nMaker. What was he then? Man. Man was his high and only title, and a\r\nhigher cannot be given him. But of titles I shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nWe are now got at the origin of man, and at the origin of his rights.\r\nAs to the manner in which the world has been governed from that day to\r\nthis, it is no farther any concern of ours than to make a proper use of\r\nthe errors or the improvements which the history of it presents. Those\r\nwho lived an hundred or a thousand years ago, were then moderns, as we\r\nare now. They had their ancients, and those ancients had others, and we\r\nalso shall be ancients in our turn. If the mere name of antiquity is to\r\ngovern in the affairs of life, the people who are to live an hundred or\r\na thousand years hence, may as well take us for a precedent, as we make\r\na precedent of those who lived an hundred or a thousand years ago. The\r\nfact is, that portions of antiquity, by proving everything, establish\r\nnothing. It is authority against authority all the way, till we come\r\nto the divine origin of the rights of man at the creation. Here our\r\nenquiries find a resting-place, and our reason finds a home. If a\r\ndispute about the rights of man had arisen at the distance of an hundred\r\nyears from the creation, it is to this source of authority they must\r\nhave referred, and it is to this same source of authority that we must\r\nnow refer.\r\n\r\nThough I mean not to touch upon any sectarian principle of religion,\r\nyet it may be worth observing, that the genealogy of Christ is traced\r\nto Adam. Why then not trace the rights of man to the creation of man? I\r\nwill answer the question. Because there have been upstart governments,\r\nthrusting themselves between, and presumptuously working to un-make man.\r\n\r\nIf any generation of men ever possessed the right of dictating the\r\nmode by which the world should be governed for ever, it was the\r\nfirst generation that existed; and if that generation did it not, no\r\nsucceeding generation can show any authority for doing it, nor can set\r\nany up. The illuminating and divine principle of the equal rights of man\r\n(for it has its origin from the Maker of man) relates, not only to the\r\nliving individuals, but to generations of men succeeding each other.\r\nEvery generation is equal in rights to generations which preceded it,\r\nby the same rule that every individual is born equal in rights with his\r\ncontemporary.\r\n\r\nEvery history of the creation, and every traditionary account, whether\r\nfrom the lettered or unlettered world, however they may vary in their\r\nopinion or belief of certain particulars, all agree in establishing one\r\npoint, the unity of man; by which I mean that men are all of one degree,\r\nand consequently that all men are born equal, and with equal natural\r\nright, in the same manner as if posterity had been continued by creation\r\ninstead of generation, the latter being the only mode by which the\r\nformer is carried forward; and consequently every child born into the\r\nworld must be considered as deriving its existence from God. The world\r\nis as new to him as it was to the first man that existed, and his\r\nnatural right in it is of the same kind.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic account of the creation, whether taken as divine authority or\r\nmerely historical, is full to this point, the unity or equality of man.\r\nThe expression admits of no controversy. \"And God said, Let us make man\r\nin our own image. In the image of God created he him; male and female\r\ncreated he them.\" The distinction of sexes is pointed out, but no other\r\ndistinction is even implied. If this be not divine authority, it is at\r\nleast historical authority, and shows that the equality of man, so far\r\nfrom being a modern doctrine, is the oldest upon record.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed that all the religions known in the world are\r\nfounded, so far as they relate to man, on the unity of man, as being all\r\nof one degree. Whether in heaven or in hell, or in whatever state man\r\nmay be supposed to exist hereafter, the good and the bad are the only\r\ndistinctions. Nay, even the laws of governments are obliged to slide\r\ninto this principle, by making degrees to consist in crimes and not in\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the greatest of all truths, and of the highest advantage to\r\ncultivate. By considering man in this light, and by instructing him to\r\nconsider himself in this light, it places him in a close connection with\r\nall his duties, whether to his Creator or to the creation, of which he\r\nis a part; and it is only when he forgets his origin, or, to use a more\r\nfashionable phrase, his birth and family, that he becomes dissolute. It\r\nis not among the least of the evils of the present existing governments\r\nin all parts of Europe that man, considered as man, is thrown back to a\r\nvast distance from his Maker, and the artificial chasm filled up with a\r\nsuccession of barriers, or sort of turnpike gates, through which he has\r\nto pass. I will quote Mr. Burke's catalogue of barriers that he has\r\nset up between man and his Maker. Putting himself in the character of a\r\nherald, he says: \"We fear God--we look with awe to kings--with affection\r\nto Parliaments with duty to magistrates--with reverence to priests,\r\nand with respect to nobility.\" Mr. Burke has forgotten to put in\r\n\"'chivalry.\" He has also forgotten to put in Peter.\r\n\r\nThe duty of man is not a wilderness of turnpike gates, through which he\r\nis to pass by tickets from one to the other. It is plain and simple, and\r\nconsists but of two points. His duty to God, which every man must feel;\r\nand with respect to his neighbor, to do as he would be done by. If those\r\nto whom power is delegated do well, they will be respected: if not,\r\nthey will be despised; and with regard to those to whom no power is\r\ndelegated, but who assume it, the rational world can know nothing of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have spoken only (and that but in part) of the natural\r\nrights of man. We have now to consider the civil rights of man, and\r\nto show how the one originates from the other. Man did not enter into\r\nsociety to become worse than he was before, nor to have fewer rights\r\nthan he had before, but to have those rights better secured. His natural\r\nrights are the foundation of all his civil rights. But in order to\r\npursue this distinction with more precision, it will be necessary to\r\nmark the different qualities of natural and civil rights.\r\n\r\nA few words will explain this. Natural rights are those which appertain\r\nto man in right of his existence. Of this kind are all the intellectual\r\nrights, or rights of the mind, and also all those rights of acting as an\r\nindividual for his own comfort and happiness, which are not injurious to\r\nthe natural rights of others. Civil rights are those which appertain to\r\nman in right of his being a member of society. Every civil right has for\r\nits foundation some natural right pre-existing in the individual, but\r\nto the enjoyment of which his individual power is not, in all cases,\r\nsufficiently competent. Of this kind are all those which relate to\r\nsecurity and protection.\r\n\r\nFrom this short review it will be easy to distinguish between that class\r\nof natural rights which man retains after entering into society and\r\nthose which he throws into the common stock as a member of society.\r\n\r\nThe natural rights which he retains are all those in which the Power to\r\nexecute is as perfect in the individual as the right itself. Among\r\nthis class, as is before mentioned, are all the intellectual rights, or\r\nrights of the mind; consequently religion is one of those rights. The\r\nnatural rights which are not retained, are all those in which, though\r\nthe right is perfect in the individual, the power to execute them is\r\ndefective. They answer not his purpose. A man, by natural right, has a\r\nright to judge in his own cause; and so far as the right of the mind is\r\nconcerned, he never surrenders it. But what availeth it him to judge,\r\nif he has not power to redress? He therefore deposits this right in the\r\ncommon stock of society, and takes the ann of society, of which he is\r\na part, in preference and in addition to his own. Society grants him\r\nnothing. Every man is a proprietor in society, and draws on the capital\r\nas a matter of right.\r\n\r\nFrom these premisses two or three certain conclusions will follow:\r\n\r\nFirst, That every civil right grows out of a natural right; or, in other\r\nwords, is a natural right exchanged.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That civil power properly considered as such is made up of\r\nthe aggregate of that class of the natural rights of man, which becomes\r\ndefective in the individual in point of power, and answers not his\r\npurpose, but when collected to a focus becomes competent to the Purpose\r\nof every one.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That the power produced from the aggregate of natural rights,\r\nimperfect in power in the individual, cannot be applied to invade the\r\nnatural rights which are retained in the individual, and in which the\r\npower to execute is as perfect as the right itself.\r\n\r\nWe have now, in a few words, traced man from a natural individual to a\r\nmember of society, and shown, or endeavoured to show, the quality of\r\nthe natural rights retained, and of those which are exchanged for civil\r\nrights. Let us now apply these principles to governments.\r\n\r\nIn casting our eyes over the world, it is extremely easy to distinguish\r\nthe governments which have arisen out of society, or out of the social\r\ncompact, from those which have not; but to place this in a clearer light\r\nthan what a single glance may afford, it will be proper to take a review\r\nof the several sources from which governments have arisen and on which\r\nthey have been founded.\r\n\r\nThey may be all comprehended under three heads.\r\n\r\nFirst, Superstition.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Power.\r\n\r\nThirdly, The common interest of society and the common rights of man.\r\n\r\nThe first was a government of priestcraft, the second of conquerors, and\r\nthe third of reason.\r\n\r\nWhen a set of artful men pretended, through the medium of oracles, to\r\nhold intercourse with the Deity, as familiarly as they now march up\r\nthe back-stairs in European courts, the world was completely under the\r\ngovernment of superstition. The oracles were consulted, and whatever\r\nthey were made to say became the law; and this sort of government lasted\r\nas long as this sort of superstition lasted.\r\n\r\nAfter these a race of conquerors arose, whose government, like that of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, was founded in power, and the sword assumed the\r\nname of a sceptre. Governments thus established last as long as the\r\npower to support them lasts; but that they might avail themselves of\r\nevery engine in their favor, they united fraud to force, and set up\r\nan idol which they called Divine Right, and which, in imitation of the\r\nPope, who affects to be spiritual and temporal, and in contradiction to\r\nthe Founder of the Christian religion, twisted itself afterwards into an\r\nidol of another shape, called Church and State. The key of St. Peter\r\nand the key of the Treasury became quartered on one another, and the\r\nwondering cheated multitude worshipped the invention.\r\n\r\nWhen I contemplate the natural dignity of man, when I feel (for Nature\r\nhas not been kind enough to me to blunt my feelings) for the honour and\r\nhappiness of its character, I become irritated at the attempt to govern\r\nmankind by force and fraud, as if they were all knaves and fools, and\r\ncan scarcely avoid disgust at those who are thus imposed upon.\r\n\r\nWe have now to review the governments which arise out of society, in\r\ncontradistinction to those which arose out of superstition and conquest.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought a considerable advance towards establishing the\r\nprinciples of Freedom to say that Government is a compact between those\r\nwho govern and those who are governed; but this cannot be true, because\r\nit is putting the effect before the cause; for as man must have\r\nexisted before governments existed, there necessarily was a time when\r\ngovernments did not exist, and consequently there could originally exist\r\nno governors to form such a compact with.\r\n\r\nThe fact therefore must be that the individuals themselves, each in his\r\nown personal and sovereign right, entered into a compact with each other\r\nto produce a government: and this is the only mode in which governments\r\nhave a right to arise, and the only principle on which they have a right\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nTo possess ourselves of a clear idea of what government is, or ought\r\nto be, we must trace it to its origin. In doing this we shall easily\r\ndiscover that governments must have arisen either out of the people\r\nor over the people. Mr. Burke has made no distinction. He investigates\r\nnothing to its source, and therefore he confounds everything; but he has\r\nsignified his intention of undertaking, at some future opportunity, a\r\ncomparison between the constitution of England and France. As he thus\r\nrenders it a subject of controversy by throwing the gauntlet, I take him\r\nupon his own ground. It is in high challenges that high truths have the\r\nright of appearing; and I accept it with the more readiness because it\r\naffords me, at the same time, an opportunity of pursuing the subject\r\nwith respect to governments arising out of society.\r\n\r\nBut it will be first necessary to define what is meant by a\r\nConstitution. It is not sufficient that we adopt the word; we must fix\r\nalso a standard signification to it.\r\n\r\nA constitution is not a thing in name only, but in fact. It has not an\r\nideal, but a real existence; and wherever it cannot be produced in a\r\nvisible form, there is none. A constitution is a thing antecedent to a\r\ngovernment, and a government is only the creature of a constitution. The\r\nconstitution of a country is not the act of its government, but of the\r\npeople constituting its government. It is the body of elements, to which\r\nyou can refer, and quote article by article; and which contains the\r\nprinciples on which the government shall be established, the manner\r\nin which it shall be organised, the powers it shall have, the mode\r\nof elections, the duration of Parliaments, or by what other name\r\nsuch bodies may be called; the powers which the executive part of the\r\ngovernment shall have; and in fine, everything that relates to the\r\ncomplete organisation of a civil government, and the principles on which\r\nit shall act, and by which it shall be bound. A constitution, therefore,\r\nis to a government what the laws made afterwards by that government\r\nare to a court of judicature. The court of judicature does not make the\r\nlaws, neither can it alter them; it only acts in conformity to the laws\r\nmade: and the government is in like manner governed by the constitution.\r\n\r\nCan, then, Mr. Burke produce the English Constitution? If he cannot,\r\nwe may fairly conclude that though it has been so much talked about, no\r\nsuch thing as a constitution exists, or ever did exist, and consequently\r\nthat the people have yet a constitution to form.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke will not, I presume, deny the position I have already\r\nadvanced--namely, that governments arise either out of the people or\r\nover the people. The English Government is one of those which arose out\r\nof a conquest, and not out of society, and consequently it arose over\r\nthe people; and though it has been much modified from the opportunity of\r\ncircumstances since the time of William the Conqueror, the country has\r\nnever yet regenerated itself, and is therefore without a constitution.\r\n\r\nI readily perceive the reason why Mr. Burke declined going into the\r\ncomparison between the English and French constitutions, because he\r\ncould not but perceive, when he sat down to the task, that no such a\r\nthing as a constitution existed on his side the question. His book\r\nis certainly bulky enough to have contained all he could say on this\r\nsubject, and it would have been the best manner in which people could\r\nhave judged of their separate merits. Why then has he declined the only\r\nthing that was worth while to write upon? It was the strongest ground he\r\ncould take, if the advantages were on his side, but the weakest if they\r\nwere not; and his declining to take it is either a sign that he could\r\nnot possess it or could not maintain it.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke said, in a speech last winter in Parliament, \"that when the\r\nNational Assembly first met in three Orders (the Tiers Etat, the Clergy,\r\nand the Noblesse), France had then a good constitution.\" This shows,\r\namong numerous other instances, that Mr. Burke does not understand what\r\na constitution is. The persons so met were not a constitution, but a\r\nconvention, to make a constitution.\r\n\r\nThe present National Assembly of France is, strictly speaking, the\r\npersonal social compact. The members of it are the delegates of\r\nthe nation in its original character; future assemblies will be the\r\ndelegates of the nation in its organised character. The authority of\r\nthe present Assembly is different from what the authority of future\r\nAssemblies will be. The authority of the present one is to form a\r\nconstitution; the authority of future assemblies will be to legislate\r\naccording to the principles and forms prescribed in that constitution;\r\nand if experience should hereafter show that alterations, amendments,\r\nor additions are necessary, the constitution will point out the mode by\r\nwhich such things shall be done, and not leave it to the discretionary\r\npower of the future government.\r\n\r\nA government on the principles on which constitutional governments\r\narising out of society are established, cannot have the right of\r\naltering itself. If it had, it would be arbitrary. It might make itself\r\nwhat it pleased; and wherever such a right is set up, it shows there\r\nis no constitution. The act by which the English Parliament empowered\r\nitself to sit seven years, shows there is no constitution in England. It\r\nmight, by the same self-authority, have sat any great number of years,\r\nor for life. The bill which the present Mr. Pitt brought into Parliament\r\nsome years ago, to reform Parliament, was on the same erroneous\r\nprinciple. The right of reform is in the nation in its original\r\ncharacter, and the constitutional method would be by a general\r\nconvention elected for the purpose. There is, moreover, a paradox in the\r\nidea of vitiated bodies reforming themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom these preliminaries I proceed to draw some comparisons. I have\r\nalready spoken of the declaration of rights; and as I mean to be as\r\nconcise as possible, I shall proceed to other parts of the French\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of France says that every man who pays a tax of sixty\r\nsous per annum (2s. 6d. English) is an elector. What article will Mr.\r\nBurke place against this? Can anything be more limited, and at the same\r\ntime more capricious, than the qualification of electors is in England?\r\nLimited--because not one man in an hundred (I speak much within compass)\r\nis admitted to vote. Capricious--because the lowest character that can\r\nbe supposed to exist, and who has not so much as the visible means of an\r\nhonest livelihood, is an elector in some places: while in other places,\r\nthe man who pays very large taxes, and has a known fair character, and\r\nthe farmer who rents to the amount of three or four hundred pounds a\r\nyear, with a property on that farm to three or four times that amount,\r\nis not admitted to be an elector. Everything is out of nature, as Mr.\r\nBurke says on another occasion, in this strange chaos, and all sorts of\r\nfollies are blended with all sorts of crimes. William the Conqueror and\r\nhis descendants parcelled out the country in this manner, and bribed\r\nsome parts of it by what they call charters to hold the other parts of\r\nit the better subjected to their will. This is the reason why so many\r\nof those charters abound in Cornwall; the people were averse to the\r\nGovernment established at the Conquest, and the towns were garrisoned\r\nand bribed to enslave the country. All the old charters are the badges\r\nof this conquest, and it is from this source that the capriciousness of\r\nelection arises.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution says that the number of representatives for\r\nany place shall be in a ratio to the number of taxable inhabitants or\r\nelectors. What article will Mr. Burke place against this? The county\r\nof York, which contains nearly a million of souls, sends two county\r\nmembers; and so does the county of Rutland, which contains not an\r\nhundredth part of that number. The old town of Sarum, which contains\r\nnot three houses, sends two members; and the town of Manchester, which\r\ncontains upward of sixty thousand souls, is not admitted to send any.\r\nIs there any principle in these things? It is admitted that all this\r\nis altered, but there is much to be done yet, before we have a fair\r\nrepresentation of the people. Is there anything by which you can trace\r\nthe marks of freedom, or discover those of wisdom? No wonder then Mr.\r\nBurke has declined the comparison, and endeavored to lead his readers\r\nfrom the point by a wild, unsystematical display of paradoxical\r\nrhapsodies.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution says that the National Assembly shall be elected\r\nevery two years. What article will Mr. Burke place against this? Why,\r\nthat the nation has no right at all in the case; that the government is\r\nperfectly arbitrary with respect to this point; and he can quote for his\r\nauthority the precedent of a former Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution says there shall be no game laws, that the\r\nfarmer on whose lands wild game shall be found (for it is by the produce\r\nof his lands they are fed) shall have a right to what he can take; that\r\nthere shall be no monopolies of any kind--that all trades shall be free\r\nand every man free to follow any occupation by which he can procure\r\nan honest livelihood, and in any place, town, or city throughout the\r\nnation. What will Mr. Burke say to this? In England, game is made the\r\nproperty of those at whose expense it is not fed; and with respect to\r\nmonopolies, the country is cut up into monopolies. Every chartered\r\ntown is an aristocratical monopoly in itself, and the qualification of\r\nelectors proceeds out of those chartered monopolies. Is this freedom? Is\r\nthis what Mr. Burke means by a constitution?\r\n\r\nIn these chartered monopolies, a man coming from another part of the\r\ncountry is hunted from them as if he were a foreign enemy. An Englishman\r\nis not free of his own country; every one of those places presents a\r\nbarrier in his way, and tells him he is not a freeman--that he has no\r\nrights. Within these monopolies are other monopolies. In a city, such\r\nfor instance as Bath, which contains between twenty and thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants, the right of electing representatives to Parliament is\r\nmonopolised by about thirty-one persons. And within these monopolies\r\nare still others. A man even of the same town, whose parents were not\r\nin circumstances to give him an occupation, is debarred, in many cases,\r\nfrom the natural right of acquiring one, be his genius or industry what\r\nit may.\r\n\r\nAre these things examples to hold out to a country regenerating itself\r\nfrom slavery, like France? Certainly they are not, and certain am I,\r\nthat when the people of England come to reflect upon them they will,\r\nlike France, annihilate those badges of ancient oppression, those traces\r\nof a conquered nation. Had Mr. Burke possessed talents similar to the\r\nauthor of \"On the Wealth of Nations.\" he would have comprehended all\r\nthe parts which enter into, and, by assemblage, form a constitution.\r\nHe would have reasoned from minutiae to magnitude. It is not from his\r\nprejudices only, but from the disorderly cast of his genius, that he is\r\nunfitted for the subject he writes upon. Even his genius is without a\r\nconstitution. It is a genius at random, and not a genius constituted.\r\nBut he must say something. He has therefore mounted in the air like a\r\nballoon, to draw the eyes of the multitude from the ground they stand\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nMuch is to be learned from the French Constitution. Conquest and tyranny\r\ntransplanted themselves with William the Conqueror from Normandy into\r\nEngland, and the country is yet disfigured with the marks. May, then,\r\nthe example of all France contribute to regenerate the freedom which a\r\nprovince of it destroyed!\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution says that to preserve the national\r\nrepresentation from being corrupt, no member of the National Assembly\r\nshall be an officer of the government, a placeman or a pensioner. What\r\nwill Mr. Burke place against this? I will whisper his answer: Loaves and\r\nFishes. Ah! this government of loaves and fishes has more mischief in\r\nit than people have yet reflected on. The National Assembly has made the\r\ndiscovery, and it holds out the example to the world. Had governments\r\nagreed to quarrel on purpose to fleece their countries by taxes, they\r\ncould not have succeeded better than they have done.\r\n\r\nEverything in the English government appears to me the reverse of\r\nwhat it ought to be, and of what it is said to be. The Parliament,\r\nimperfectly and capriciously elected as it is, is nevertheless supposed\r\nto hold the national purse in trust for the nation; but in the manner in\r\nwhich an English Parliament is constructed it is like a man being both\r\nmortgagor and mortgagee, and in the case of misapplication of trust it\r\nis the criminal sitting in judgment upon himself. If those who vote the\r\nsupplies are the same persons who receive the supplies when voted, and\r\nare to account for the expenditure of those supplies to those who voted\r\nthem, it is themselves accountable to themselves, and the Comedy of\r\nErrors concludes with the pantomime of Hush. Neither the Ministerial\r\nparty nor the Opposition will touch upon this case. The national purse\r\nis the common hack which each mounts upon. It is like what the country\r\npeople call \"Ride and tie--you ride a little way, and then I.\"*[5] They\r\norder these things better in France.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution says that the right of war and peace is in the\r\nnation. Where else should it reside but in those who are to pay the\r\nexpense?\r\n\r\nIn England this right is said to reside in a metaphor shown at the Tower\r\nfor sixpence or a shilling a piece: so are the lions; and it would be\r\na step nearer to reason to say it resided in them, for any inanimate\r\nmetaphor is no more than a hat or a cap. We can all see the absurdity of\r\nworshipping Aaron's molten calf, or Nebuchadnezzar's golden image; but\r\nwhy do men continue to practise themselves the absurdities they despise\r\nin others?\r\n\r\nIt may with reason be said that in the manner the English nation is\r\nrepresented it signifies not where the right resides, whether in the\r\nCrown or in the Parliament. War is the common harvest of all those who\r\nparticipate in the division and expenditure of public money, in all\r\ncountries. It is the art of conquering at home; the object of it is an\r\nincrease of revenue; and as revenue cannot be increased without taxes,\r\na pretence must be made for expenditure. In reviewing the history of the\r\nEnglish Government, its wars and its taxes, a bystander, not blinded\r\nby prejudice nor warped by interest, would declare that taxes were not\r\nraised to carry on wars, but that wars were raised to carry on taxes.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, as a member of the House of Commons, is a part of the English\r\nGovernment; and though he professes himself an enemy to war, he abuses\r\nthe French Constitution, which seeks to explode it. He holds up the\r\nEnglish Government as a model, in all its parts, to France; but he\r\nshould first know the remarks which the French make upon it. They\r\ncontend in favor of their own, that the portion of liberty enjoyed in\r\nEngland is just enough to enslave a country more productively than by\r\ndespotism, and that as the real object of all despotism is revenue,\r\na government so formed obtains more than it could do either by direct\r\ndespotism, or in a full state of freedom, and is, therefore on the\r\nground of interest, opposed to both. They account also for the readiness\r\nwhich always appears in such governments for engaging in wars by\r\nremarking on the different motives which produced them. In despotic\r\ngovernments wars are the effect of pride; but in those governments in\r\nwhich they become the means of taxation, they acquire thereby a more\r\npermanent promptitude.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution, therefore, to provide against both these evils,\r\nhas taken away the power of declaring war from kings and ministers, and\r\nplaced the right where the expense must fall.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of the right of war and peace was agitating in the\r\nNational Assembly, the people of England appeared to be much interested\r\nin the event, and highly to applaud the decision. As a principle it\r\napplies as much to one country as another. William the Conqueror, as\r\na conqueror, held this power of war and peace in himself, and his\r\ndescendants have ever since claimed it under him as a right.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Burke has asserted the right of the Parliament at the\r\nRevolution to bind and control the nation and posterity for ever, he\r\ndenies at the same time that the Parliament or the nation had any right\r\nto alter what he calls the succession of the crown in anything but in\r\npart, or by a sort of modification. By his taking this ground he throws\r\nthe case back to the Norman Conquest, and by thus running a line of\r\nsuccession springing from William the Conqueror to the present day, he\r\nmakes it necessary to enquire who and what William the Conqueror was,\r\nand where he came from, and into the origin, history and nature of what\r\nare called prerogatives. Everything must have had a beginning, and the\r\nfog of time and antiquity should be penetrated to discover it. Let,\r\nthen, Mr. Burke bring forward his William of Normandy, for it is to this\r\norigin that his argument goes. It also unfortunately happens, in running\r\nthis line of succession, that another line parallel thereto presents\r\nitself, which is that if the succession runs in the line of the\r\nconquest, the nation runs in the line of being conquered, and it ought\r\nto rescue itself from this reproach.\r\n\r\nBut it will perhaps be said that though the power of declaring war\r\ndescends in the heritage of the conquest, it is held in check by the\r\nright of Parliament to withhold the supplies. It will always happen when\r\na thing is originally wrong that amendments do not make it right, and it\r\noften happens that they do as much mischief one way as good the other,\r\nand such is the case here, for if the one rashly declares war as a\r\nmatter of right, and the other peremptorily withholds the supplies as a\r\nmatter of right, the remedy becomes as bad, or worse, than the disease.\r\nThe one forces the nation to a combat, and the other ties its hands;\r\nbut the more probable issue is that the contest will end in a collusion\r\nbetween the parties, and be made a screen to both.\r\n\r\nOn this question of war, three things are to be considered. First, the\r\nright of declaring it: secondly, the expense of supporting it: thirdly,\r\nthe mode of conducting it after it is declared. The French Constitution\r\nplaces the right where the expense must fall, and this union can only\r\nbe in the nation. The mode of conducting it after it is declared,\r\nit consigns to the executive department. Were this the case in all\r\ncountries, we should hear but little more of wars.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to consider other parts of the French Constitution,\r\nand by way of relieving the fatigue of argument, I will introduce an\r\nanecdote which I had from Dr. Franklin.\r\n\r\nWhile the Doctor resided in France as Minister from America, during\r\nthe war, he had numerous proposals made to him by projectors of every\r\ncountry and of every kind, who wished to go to the land that floweth\r\nwith milk and honey, America; and among the rest, there was one who\r\noffered himself to be king. He introduced his proposal to the Doctor by\r\nletter, which is now in the hands of M. Beaumarchais, of Paris--stating,\r\nfirst, that as the Americans had dismissed or sent away*[6] their King,\r\nthat they would want another. Secondly, that himself was a Norman.\r\nThirdly, that he was of a more ancient family than the Dukes of\r\nNormandy, and of a more honorable descent, his line having never been\r\nbastardised. Fourthly, that there was already a precedent in England of\r\nkings coming out of Normandy, and on these grounds he rested his offer,\r\nenjoining that the Doctor would forward it to America. But as the Doctor\r\nneither did this, nor yet sent him an answer, the projector wrote a\r\nsecond letter, in which he did not, it is true, threaten to go over and\r\nconquer America, but only with great dignity proposed that if his offer\r\nwas not accepted, an acknowledgment of about L30,000 might be made to\r\nhim for his generosity! Now, as all arguments respecting succession must\r\nnecessarily connect that succession with some beginning, Mr. Burke's\r\narguments on this subject go to show that there is no English origin of\r\nkings, and that they are descendants of the Norman line in right of the\r\nConquest. It may, therefore, be of service to his doctrine to make this\r\nstory known, and to inform him, that in case of that natural extinction\r\nto which all mortality is subject, Kings may again be had from Normandy,\r\non more reasonable terms than William the Conqueror; and consequently,\r\nthat the good people of England, at the revolution of 1688, might have\r\ndone much better, had such a generous Norman as this known their wants,\r\nand they had known his. The chivalric character which Mr. Burke so much\r\nadmires, is certainly much easier to make a bargain with than a hard\r\ndealing Dutchman. But to return to the matters of the constitution: The\r\nFrench Constitution says, There shall be no titles; and, of consequence,\r\nall that class of equivocal generation which in some countries is called\r\n\"aristocracy\" and in others \"nobility,\" is done away, and the peer is\r\nexalted into the Man.\r\n\r\nTitles are but nicknames, and every nickname is a title. The thing is\r\nperfectly harmless in itself, but it marks a sort of foppery in the\r\nhuman character, which degrades it. It reduces man into the diminutive\r\nof man in things which are great, and the counterfeit of women in things\r\nwhich are little. It talks about its fine blue ribbon like a girl, and\r\nshows its new garter like a child. A certain writer, of some antiquity,\r\nsays: \"When I was a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a\r\nman, I put away childish things.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, properly, from the elevated mind of France that the folly of\r\ntitles has fallen. It has outgrown the baby clothes of Count and Duke,\r\nand breeched itself in manhood. France has not levelled, it has exalted.\r\nIt has put down the dwarf, to set up the man. The punyism of a senseless\r\nword like Duke, Count or Earl has ceased to please. Even those who\r\npossessed them have disowned the gibberish, and as they outgrew the\r\nrickets, have despised the rattle. The genuine mind of man, thirsting\r\nfor its native home, society, contemns the gewgaws that separate him\r\nfrom it. Titles are like circles drawn by the magician's wand, to\r\ncontract the sphere of man's felicity. He lives immured within the\r\nBastille of a word, and surveys at a distance the envied life of man.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, any wonder that titles should fall in France? Is it not a\r\ngreater wonder that they should be kept up anywhere? What are they? What\r\nis their worth, and \"what is their amount?\" When we think or speak of\r\na Judge or a General, we associate with it the ideas of office and\r\ncharacter; we think of gravity in one and bravery in the other; but when\r\nwe use the word merely as a title, no ideas associate with it. Through\r\nall the vocabulary of Adam there is not such an animal as a Duke or a\r\nCount; neither can we connect any certain ideas with the words. Whether\r\nthey mean strength or weakness, wisdom or folly, a child or a man, or\r\nthe rider or the horse, is all equivocal. What respect then can be paid\r\nto that which describes nothing, and which means nothing? Imagination\r\nhas given figure and character to centaurs, satyrs, and down to all\r\nthe fairy tribe; but titles baffle even the powers of fancy, and are a\r\nchimerical nondescript.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. If a whole country is disposed to hold them in\r\ncontempt, all their value is gone, and none will own them. It is\r\ncommon opinion only that makes them anything, or nothing, or worse\r\nthan nothing. There is no occasion to take titles away, for they take\r\nthemselves away when society concurs to ridicule them. This species of\r\nimaginary consequence has visibly declined in every part of Europe, and\r\nit hastens to its exit as the world of reason continues to rise. There\r\nwas a time when the lowest class of what are called nobility was more\r\nthought of than the highest is now, and when a man in armour riding\r\nthroughout Christendom in quest of adventures was more stared at than\r\na modern Duke. The world has seen this folly fall, and it has fallen\r\nby being laughed at, and the farce of titles will follow its fate. The\r\npatriots of France have discovered in good time that rank and dignity in\r\nsociety must take a new ground. The old one has fallen through. It must\r\nnow take the substantial ground of character, instead of the chimerical\r\nground of titles; and they have brought their titles to the altar, and\r\nmade of them a burnt-offering to Reason.\r\n\r\nIf no mischief had annexed itself to the folly of titles they would not\r\nhave been worth a serious and formal destruction, such as the National\r\nAssembly have decreed them; and this makes it necessary to enquire\r\nfarther into the nature and character of aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThat, then, which is called aristocracy in some countries and nobility\r\nin others arose out of the governments founded upon conquest. It was\r\noriginally a military order for the purpose of supporting military\r\ngovernment (for such were all governments founded in conquest); and\r\nto keep up a succession of this order for the purpose for which it\r\nwas established, all the younger branches of those families were\r\ndisinherited and the law of primogenitureship set up.\r\n\r\nThe nature and character of aristocracy shows itself to us in this law.\r\nIt is the law against every other law of nature, and Nature herself\r\ncalls for its destruction. Establish family justice, and aristocracy\r\nfalls. By the aristocratical law of primogenitureship, in a family\r\nof six children five are exposed. Aristocracy has never more than one\r\nchild. The rest are begotten to be devoured. They are thrown to the\r\ncannibal for prey, and the natural parent prepares the unnatural repast.\r\n\r\nAs everything which is out of nature in man affects, more or less,\r\nthe interest of society, so does this. All the children which the\r\naristocracy disowns (which are all except the eldest) are, in general,\r\ncast like orphans on a parish, to be provided for by the public, but\r\nat a greater charge. Unnecessary offices and places in governments and\r\ncourts are created at the expense of the public to maintain them.\r\n\r\nWith what kind of parental reflections can the father or mother\r\ncontemplate their younger offspring? By nature they are children, and\r\nby marriage they are heirs; but by aristocracy they are bastards and\r\norphans. They are the flesh and blood of their parents in the one line,\r\nand nothing akin to them in the other. To restore, therefore, parents to\r\ntheir children, and children to their parents relations to each other,\r\nand man to society--and to exterminate the monster aristocracy, root\r\nand branch--the French Constitution has destroyed the law of\r\nPrimogenitureship. Here then lies the monster; and Mr. Burke, if he\r\npleases, may write its epitaph.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered aristocracy chiefly in one point of view.\r\nWe have now to consider it in another. But whether we view it before or\r\nbehind, or sideways, or any way else, domestically or publicly, it is\r\nstill a monster.\r\n\r\nIn France aristocracy had one feature less in its countenance than what\r\nit has in some other countries. It did not compose a body of hereditary\r\nlegislators. It was not \"a corporation of aristocracy,\" for such I have\r\nheard M. de la Fayette describe an English House of Peers. Let us then\r\nexamine the grounds upon which the French Constitution has resolved\r\nagainst having such a House in France.\r\n\r\nBecause, in the first place, as is already mentioned, aristocracy is\r\nkept up by family tyranny and injustice.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Because there is an unnatural unfitness in an aristocracy to\r\nbe legislators for a nation. Their ideas of distributive justice are\r\ncorrupted at the very source. They begin life by trampling on all their\r\nyounger brothers and sisters, and relations of every kind, and are\r\ntaught and educated so to do. With what ideas of justice or honour can\r\nthat man enter a house of legislation, who absorbs in his own person\r\nthe inheritance of a whole family of children or doles out to them some\r\npitiful portion with the insolence of a gift?\r\n\r\nThirdly. Because the idea of hereditary legislators is as inconsistent\r\nas that of hereditary judges, or hereditary juries; and as absurd as an\r\nhereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man; and as ridiculous\r\nas an hereditary poet laureate.\r\n\r\nFourthly. Because a body of men, holding themselves accountable to\r\nnobody, ought not to be trusted by anybody.\r\n\r\nFifthly. Because it is continuing the uncivilised principle of\r\ngovernments founded in conquest, and the base idea of man having\r\nproperty in man, and governing him by personal right.\r\n\r\nSixthly. Because aristocracy has a tendency to deteriorate the human\r\nspecies. By the universal economy of nature it is known, and by the\r\ninstance of the Jews it is proved, that the human species has a tendency\r\nto degenerate, in any small number of persons, when separated from the\r\ngeneral stock of society, and inter-marrying constantly with each other.\r\nIt defeats even its pretended end, and becomes in time the opposite of\r\nwhat is noble in man. Mr. Burke talks of nobility; let him show what\r\nit is. The greatest characters the world have known have arisen on the\r\ndemocratic floor. Aristocracy has not been able to keep a proportionate\r\npace with democracy. The artificial Noble shrinks into a dwarf before\r\nthe Noble of Nature; and in the few instances of those (for there are\r\nsome in all countries) in whom nature, as by a miracle, has survived in\r\naristocracy, Those Men Despise It.--But it is time to proceed to a new\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution has reformed the condition of the clergy. It has\r\nraised the income of the lower and middle classes, and taken from the\r\nhigher. None are now less than twelve hundred livres (fifty pounds\r\nsterling), nor any higher than two or three thousand pounds. What will\r\nMr. Burke place against this? Hear what he says.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"That the people of England can see without pain or grudging,\r\nan archbishop precede a duke; they can see a Bishop of Durham, or a\r\nBishop of Winchester in possession of L10,000 a-year; and cannot see why\r\nit is in worse hands than estates to a like amount, in the hands of this\r\nearl or that squire.\" And Mr. Burke offers this as an example to France.\r\n\r\nAs to the first part, whether the archbishop precedes the duke, or the\r\nduke the bishop, it is, I believe, to the people in general, somewhat\r\nlike Sternhold and Hopkins, or Hopkins and Sternhold; you may put which\r\nyou please first; and as I confess that I do not understand the merits\r\nof this case, I will not contest it with Mr. Burke.\r\n\r\nBut with respect to the latter, I have something to say. Mr. Burke has\r\nnot put the case right. The comparison is out of order, by being put\r\nbetween the bishop and the earl or the squire. It ought to be put\r\nbetween the bishop and the curate, and then it will stand thus:--\"The\r\npeople of England can see without pain or grudging, a Bishop of Durham,\r\nor a Bishop of Winchester, in possession of ten thousand pounds a-year,\r\nand a curate on thirty or forty pounds a-year, or less.\" No, sir, they\r\ncertainly do not see those things without great pain or grudging. It is\r\na case that applies itself to every man's sense of justice, and is one\r\namong many that calls aloud for a constitution.\r\n\r\nIn France the cry of \"the church! the church!\" was repeated as often\r\nas in Mr. Burke's book, and as loudly as when the Dissenters' Bill was\r\nbefore the English Parliament; but the generality of the French clergy\r\nwere not to be deceived by this cry any longer. They knew that whatever\r\nthe pretence might be, it was they who were one of the principal objects\r\nof it. It was the cry of the high beneficed clergy, to prevent any\r\nregulation of income taking place between those of ten thousand pounds\r\na-year and the parish priest. They therefore joined their case to\r\nthose of every other oppressed class of men, and by this union obtained\r\nredress.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution has abolished tythes, that source of perpetual\r\ndiscontent between the tythe-holder and the parishioner. When land is\r\nheld on tythe, it is in the condition of an estate held between two\r\nparties; the one receiving one-tenth, and the other nine-tenths of the\r\nproduce: and consequently, on principles of equity, if the estate can be\r\nimproved, and made to produce by that improvement double or treble what\r\nit did before, or in any other ratio, the expense of such improvement\r\nought to be borne in like proportion between the parties who are to\r\nshare the produce. But this is not the case in tythes: the farmer\r\nbears the whole expense, and the tythe-holder takes a tenth of the\r\nimprovement, in addition to the original tenth, and by this means gets\r\nthe value of two-tenths instead of one. This is another case that calls\r\nfor a constitution.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution hath abolished or renounced Toleration and\r\nIntolerance also, and hath established Universal Right Of Conscience.\r\n\r\nToleration is not the opposite of Intolerance, but is the counterfeit\r\nof it. Both are despotisms. The one assumes to itself the right of\r\nwithholding Liberty of Conscience, and the other of granting it. The\r\none is the Pope armed with fire and faggot, and the other is the Pope\r\nselling or granting indulgences. The former is church and state, and the\r\nlatter is church and traffic.\r\n\r\nBut Toleration may be viewed in a much stronger light. Man worships not\r\nhimself, but his Maker; and the liberty of conscience which he claims is\r\nnot for the service of himself, but of his God. In this case, therefore,\r\nwe must necessarily have the associated idea of two things; the mortal\r\nwho renders the worship, and the Immortal Being who is worshipped.\r\nToleration, therefore, places itself, not between man and man, nor\r\nbetween church and church, nor between one denomination of religion and\r\nanother, but between God and man; between the being who worships, and\r\nthe Being who is worshipped; and by the same act of assumed authority\r\nwhich it tolerates man to pay his worship, it presumptuously and\r\nblasphemously sets itself up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it.\r\n\r\nWere a bill brought into any Parliament, entitled, \"An Act to tolerate\r\nor grant liberty to the Almighty to receive the worship of a Jew or\r\nTurk,\" or \"to prohibit the Almighty from receiving it,\" all men would\r\nstartle and call it blasphemy. There would be an uproar. The presumption\r\nof toleration in religious matters would then present itself unmasked;\r\nbut the presumption is not the less because the name of \"Man\" only\r\nappears to those laws, for the associated idea of the worshipper and the\r\nworshipped cannot be separated. Who then art thou, vain dust and ashes!\r\nby whatever name thou art called, whether a King, a Bishop, a Church,\r\nor a State, a Parliament, or anything else, that obtrudest thine\r\ninsignificance between the soul of man and its Maker? Mind thine own\r\nconcerns. If he believes not as thou believest, it is a proof that\r\nthou believest not as he believes, and there is no earthly power can\r\ndetermine between you.\r\n\r\nWith respect to what are called denominations of religion, if every\r\none is left to judge of its own religion, there is no such thing as\r\na religion that is wrong; but if they are to judge of each other's\r\nreligion, there is no such thing as a religion that is right; and\r\ntherefore all the world is right, or all the world is wrong. But with\r\nrespect to religion itself, without regard to names, and as directing\r\nitself from the universal family of mankind to the Divine object of all\r\nadoration, it is man bringing to his Maker the fruits of his heart; and\r\nthough those fruits may differ from each other like the fruits of the\r\nearth, the grateful tribute of every one is accepted.\r\n\r\nA Bishop of Durham, or a Bishop of Winchester, or the archbishop who\r\nheads the dukes, will not refuse a tythe-sheaf of wheat because it is\r\nnot a cock of hay, nor a cock of hay because it is not a sheaf of wheat;\r\nnor a pig, because it is neither one nor the other; but these same\r\npersons, under the figure of an established church, will not permit\r\ntheir Maker to receive the varied tythes of man's devotion.\r\n\r\nOne of the continual choruses of Mr. Burke's book is \"Church and State.\"\r\nHe does not mean some one particular church, or some one particular\r\nstate, but any church and state; and he uses the term as a general\r\nfigure to hold forth the political doctrine of always uniting the church\r\nwith the state in every country, and he censures the National Assembly\r\nfor not having done this in France. Let us bestow a few thoughts on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAll religions are in their nature kind and benign, and united with\r\nprinciples of morality. They could not have made proselytes at first by\r\nprofessing anything that was vicious, cruel, persecuting, or immoral.\r\nLike everything else, they had their beginning; and they proceeded by\r\npersuasion, exhortation, and example. How then is it that they lose\r\ntheir native mildness, and become morose and intolerant?\r\n\r\nIt proceeds from the connection which Mr. Burke recommends. By\r\nengendering the church with the state, a sort of mule-animal, capable\r\nonly of destroying, and not of breeding up, is produced, called the\r\nChurch established by Law. It is a stranger, even from its birth, to any\r\nparent mother, on whom it is begotten, and whom in time it kicks out and\r\ndestroys.\r\n\r\nThe inquisition in Spain does not proceed from the religion originally\r\nprofessed, but from this mule-animal, engendered between the church\r\nand the state. The burnings in Smithfield proceeded from the same\r\nheterogeneous production; and it was the regeneration of this strange\r\nanimal in England afterwards, that renewed rancour and irreligion among\r\nthe inhabitants, and that drove the people called Quakers and Dissenters\r\nto America. Persecution is not an original feature in any religion;\r\nbut it is alway the strongly-marked feature of all law-religions, or\r\nreligions established by law. Take away the law-establishment, and\r\nevery religion re-assumes its original benignity. In America, a catholic\r\npriest is a good citizen, a good character, and a good neighbour; an\r\nepiscopalian minister is of the same description: and this proceeds\r\nindependently of the men, from there being no law-establishment in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIf also we view this matter in a temporal sense, we shall see the ill\r\neffects it has had on the prosperity of nations. The union of church and\r\nstate has impoverished Spain. The revoking the edict of Nantes drove the\r\nsilk manufacture from that country into England; and church and state\r\nare now driving the cotton manufacture from England to America and\r\nFrance. Let then Mr. Burke continue to preach his antipolitical doctrine\r\nof Church and State. It will do some good. The National Assembly\r\nwill not follow his advice, but will benefit by his folly. It was by\r\nobserving the ill effects of it in England, that America has been warned\r\nagainst it; and it is by experiencing them in France, that the National\r\nAssembly have abolished it, and, like America, have established\r\nUniversal Right Of Conscience, And Universal Right Of Citizenship.*[7]\r\n\r\nI will here cease the comparison with respect to the principles of the\r\nFrench Constitution, and conclude this part of the subject with a few\r\nobservations on the organisation of the formal parts of the French and\r\nEnglish governments.\r\n\r\nThe executive power in each country is in the hands of a person styled\r\nthe King; but the French Constitution distinguishes between the King and\r\nthe Sovereign: It considers the station of King as official, and places\r\nSovereignty in the nation.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the nation, who compose the National Assembly,\r\nand who are the legislative power, originate in and from the people\r\nby election, as an inherent right in the people.--In England it is\r\notherwise; and this arises from the original establishment of what\r\nis called its monarchy; for, as by the conquest all the rights of the\r\npeople or the nation were absorbed into the hands of the Conqueror, and\r\nwho added the title of King to that of Conqueror, those same matters\r\nwhich in France are now held as rights in the people, or in the nation,\r\nare held in England as grants from what is called the crown. The\r\nParliament in England, in both its branches, was erected by patents from\r\nthe descendants of the Conqueror. The House of Commons did not originate\r\nas a matter of right in the people to delegate or elect, but as a grant\r\nor boon.\r\n\r\nBy the French Constitution the nation is always named before the king.\r\nThe third article of the declaration of rights says: \"The nation is\r\nessentially the source (or fountain) of all sovereignty.\" Mr. Burke\r\nargues that in England a king is the fountain--that he is the fountain\r\nof all honour. But as this idea is evidently descended from the conquest\r\nI shall make no other remark upon it, than that it is the nature of\r\nconquest to turn everything upside down; and as Mr. Burke will not be\r\nrefused the privilege of speaking twice, and as there are but two parts\r\nin the figure, the fountain and the spout, he will be right the second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe French Constitution puts the legislative before the executive, the\r\nlaw before the king; la loi, le roi. This also is in the natural\r\norder of things, because laws must have existence before they can have\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nA king in France does not, in addressing himself to the National\r\nAssembly, say, \"My Assembly,\" similar to the phrase used in England\r\nof my \"Parliament\"; neither can he use it consistently with the\r\nconstitution, nor could it be admitted. There may be propriety in the\r\nuse of it in England, because as is before mentioned, both Houses\r\nof Parliament originated from what is called the crown by patent or\r\nboon--and not from the inherent rights of the people, as the National\r\nAssembly does in France, and whose name designates its origin.\r\n\r\nThe President of the National Assembly does not ask the King to grant to\r\nthe Assembly liberty of speech, as is the case with the English House\r\nof Commons. The constitutional dignity of the National Assembly cannot\r\ndebase itself. Speech is, in the first place, one of the natural rights\r\nof man always retained; and with respect to the National Assembly the\r\nuse of it is their duty, and the nation is their authority. They were\r\nelected by the greatest body of men exercising the right of election\r\nthe European world ever saw. They sprung not from the filth of rotten\r\nboroughs, nor are they the vassal representatives of aristocratical\r\nones. Feeling the proper dignity of their character they support it.\r\nTheir Parliamentary language, whether for or against a question, is\r\nfree, bold and manly, and extends to all the parts and circumstances of\r\nthe case. If any matter or subject respecting the executive department\r\nor the person who presides in it (the king) comes before them it is\r\ndebated on with the spirit of men, and in the language of gentlemen; and\r\ntheir answer or their address is returned in the same style. They stand\r\nnot aloof with the gaping vacuity of vulgar ignorance, nor bend with the\r\ncringe of sycophantic insignificance. The graceful pride of truth knows\r\nno extremes, and preserves, in every latitude of life, the right-angled\r\ncharacter of man.\r\n\r\nLet us now look to the other side of the question. In the addresses\r\nof the English Parliaments to their kings we see neither the intrepid\r\nspirit of the old Parliaments of France, nor the serene dignity of the\r\npresent National Assembly; neither do we see in them anything of the\r\nstyle of English manners, which border somewhat on bluntness. Since\r\nthen they are neither of foreign extraction, nor naturally of English\r\nproduction, their origin must be sought for elsewhere, and that origin\r\nis the Norman Conquest. They are evidently of the vassalage class of\r\nmanners, and emphatically mark the prostrate distance that exists in\r\nno other condition of men than between the conqueror and the conquered.\r\nThat this vassalage idea and style of speaking was not got rid of even\r\nat the Revolution of 1688, is evident from the declaration of Parliament\r\nto William and Mary in these words: \"We do most humbly and faithfully\r\nsubmit ourselves, our heirs and posterities, for ever.\" Submission is\r\nwholly a vassalage term, repugnant to the dignity of freedom, and an\r\necho of the language used at the Conquest.\r\n\r\nAs the estimation of all things is given by comparison, the Revolution\r\nof 1688, however from circumstances it may have been exalted beyond its\r\nvalue, will find its level. It is already on the wane, eclipsed by the\r\nenlarging orb of reason, and the luminous revolutions of America and\r\nFrance. In less than another century it will go, as well as Mr. Burke's\r\nlabours, \"to the family vault of all the Capulets.\" Mankind will then\r\nscarcely believe that a country calling itself free would send\r\nto Holland for a man, and clothe him with power on purpose to put\r\nthemselves in fear of him, and give him almost a million sterling a year\r\nfor leave to submit themselves and their posterity, like bondmen and\r\nbondwomen, for ever.\r\n\r\nBut there is a truth that ought to be made known; I have had the\r\nopportunity of seeing it; which is, that notwithstanding appearances,\r\nthere is not any description of men that despise monarchy so much as\r\ncourtiers. But they well know, that if it were seen by others, as it is\r\nseen by them, the juggle could not be kept up; they are in the condition\r\nof men who get their living by a show, and to whom the folly of that\r\nshow is so familiar that they ridicule it; but were the audience to be\r\nmade as wise in this respect as themselves, there would be an end to the\r\nshow and the profits with it. The difference between a republican and\r\na courtier with respect to monarchy, is that the one opposes monarchy,\r\nbelieving it to be something; and the other laughs at it, knowing it to\r\nbe nothing.\r\n\r\nAs I used sometimes to correspond with Mr. Burke believing him then to\r\nbe a man of sounder principles than his book shows him to be, I wrote\r\nto him last winter from Paris, and gave him an account how prosperously\r\nmatters were going on. Among other subjects in that letter, I referred\r\nto the happy situation the National Assembly were placed in; that they\r\nhad taken ground on which their moral duty and their political interest\r\nwere united. They have not to hold out a language which they do not\r\nthemselves believe, for the fraudulent purpose of making others believe\r\nit. Their station requires no artifice to support it, and can only be\r\nmaintained by enlightening mankind. It is not their interest to cherish\r\nignorance, but to dispel it. They are not in the case of a ministerial\r\nor an opposition party in England, who, though they are opposed, are\r\nstill united to keep up the common mystery. The National Assembly must\r\nthrow open a magazine of light. It must show man the proper character of\r\nman; and the nearer it can bring him to that standard, the stronger the\r\nNational Assembly becomes.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the French Constitution, we see in it a rational order\r\nof things. The principles harmonise with the forms, and both with their\r\norigin. It may perhaps be said as an excuse for bad forms, that they\r\nare nothing more than forms; but this is a mistake. Forms grow out of\r\nprinciples, and operate to continue the principles they grow from. It\r\nis impossible to practise a bad form on anything but a bad principle.\r\nIt cannot be ingrafted on a good one; and wherever the forms in any\r\ngovernment are bad, it is a certain indication that the principles are\r\nbad also.\r\n\r\nI will here finally close this subject. I began it by remarking that Mr.\r\nBurke had voluntarily declined going into a comparison of the English\r\nand French Constitutions. He apologises (in page 241) for not doing it,\r\nby saying that he had not time. Mr. Burke's book was upwards of eight\r\nmonths in hand, and is extended to a volume of three hundred and\r\nsixty-six pages. As his omission does injury to his cause, his apology\r\nmakes it worse; and men on the English side of the water will begin to\r\nconsider, whether there is not some radical defect in what is called the\r\nEnglish constitution, that made it necessary for Mr. Burke to suppress\r\nthe comparison, to avoid bringing it into view.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Burke has not written on constitutions so neither has he written\r\non the French Revolution. He gives no account of its commencement or its\r\nprogress. He only expresses his wonder. \"It looks,\" says he, \"to me, as\r\nif I were in a great crisis, not of the affairs of France alone, but\r\nof all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe. All circumstances taken\r\ntogether, the French Revolution is the most astonishing that has\r\nhitherto happened in the world.\"\r\n\r\nAs wise men are astonished at foolish things, and other people at\r\nwise ones, I know not on which ground to account for Mr. Burke's\r\nastonishment; but certain it is, that he does not understand the French\r\nRevolution. It has apparently burst forth like a creation from a chaos,\r\nbut it is no more than the consequence of a mental revolution priorily\r\nexisting in France. The mind of the nation had changed beforehand,\r\nand the new order of things has naturally followed the new order of\r\nthoughts. I will here, as concisely as I can, trace out the growth of\r\nthe French Revolution, and mark the circumstances that have contributed\r\nto produce it.\r\n\r\nThe despotism of Louis XIV., united with the gaiety of his Court, and\r\nthe gaudy ostentation of his character, had so humbled, and at the same\r\ntime so fascinated the mind of France, that the people appeared to have\r\nlost all sense of their own dignity, in contemplating that of their\r\nGrand Monarch; and the whole reign of Louis XV., remarkable only for\r\nweakness and effeminacy, made no other alteration than that of spreading\r\na sort of lethargy over the nation, from which it showed no disposition\r\nto rise.\r\n\r\nThe only signs which appeared to the spirit of Liberty during those\r\nperiods, are to be found in the writings of the French philosophers.\r\nMontesquieu, President of the Parliament of Bordeaux, went as far as a\r\nwriter under a despotic government could well proceed; and being obliged\r\nto divide himself between principle and prudence, his mind often appears\r\nunder a veil, and we ought to give him credit for more than he has\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nVoltaire, who was both the flatterer and the satirist of despotism, took\r\nanother line. His forte lay in exposing and ridiculing the superstitions\r\nwhich priest-craft, united with state-craft, had interwoven with\r\ngovernments. It was not from the purity of his principles, or his love\r\nof mankind (for satire and philanthropy are not naturally concordant),\r\nbut from his strong capacity of seeing folly in its true shape, and his\r\nirresistible propensity to expose it, that he made those attacks. They\r\nwere, however, as formidable as if the motive had been virtuous; and he\r\nmerits the thanks rather than the esteem of mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, we find in the writings of Rousseau, and the Abbe\r\nRaynal, a loveliness of sentiment in favour of liberty, that excites\r\nrespect, and elevates the human faculties; but having raised this\r\nanimation, they do not direct its operation, and leave the mind in love\r\nwith an object, without describing the means of possessing it.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Quesnay, Turgot, and the friends of those authors, are\r\nof the serious kind; but they laboured under the same disadvantage with\r\nMontesquieu; their writings abound with moral maxims of government, but\r\nare rather directed to economise and reform the administration of the\r\ngovernment, than the government itself.\r\n\r\nBut all those writings and many others had their weight; and by the\r\ndifferent manner in which they treated the subject of government,\r\nMontesquieu by his judgment and knowledge of laws, Voltaire by his wit,\r\nRousseau and Raynal by their animation, and Quesnay and Turgot by their\r\nmoral maxims and systems of economy, readers of every class met with\r\nsomething to their taste, and a spirit of political inquiry began\r\nto diffuse itself through the nation at the time the dispute between\r\nEngland and the then colonies of America broke out.\r\n\r\nIn the war which France afterwards engaged in, it is very well known\r\nthat the nation appeared to be before-hand with the French ministry.\r\nEach of them had its view; but those views were directed to different\r\nobjects; the one sought liberty, and the other retaliation on England.\r\nThe French officers and soldiers who after this went to America, were\r\neventually placed in the school of Freedom, and learned the practice as\r\nwell as the principles of it by heart.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to separate the military events which took place in\r\nAmerica from the principles of the American Revolution, the publication\r\nof those events in France necessarily connected themselves with the\r\nprinciples which produced them. Many of the facts were in themselves\r\nprinciples; such as the declaration of American Independence, and the\r\ntreaty of alliance between France and America, which recognised the\r\nnatural rights of man, and justified resistance to oppression.\r\n\r\nThe then Minister of France, Count Vergennes, was not the friend of\r\nAmerica; and it is both justice and gratitude to say, that it was the\r\nQueen of France who gave the cause of America a fashion at the French\r\nCourt. Count Vergennes was the personal and social friend of Dr.\r\nFranklin; and the Doctor had obtained, by his sensible gracefulness,\r\na sort of influence over him; but with respect to principles Count\r\nVergennes was a despot.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Dr. Franklin, as Minister from America to France,\r\nshould be taken into the chain of circumstances. The diplomatic\r\ncharacter is of itself the narrowest sphere of society that man can\r\nact in. It forbids intercourse by the reciprocity of suspicion; and\r\na diplomatic is a sort of unconnected atom, continually repelling and\r\nrepelled. But this was not the case with Dr. Franklin. He was not the\r\ndiplomatic of a Court, but of Man. His character as a philosopher\r\nhad been long established, and his circle of society in France was\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\nCount Vergennes resisted for a considerable time the publication in\r\nFrance of American constitutions, translated into the French language:\r\nbut even in this he was obliged to give way to public opinion, and\r\na sort of propriety in admitting to appear what he had undertaken to\r\ndefend. The American constitutions were to liberty what a grammar is\r\nto language: they define its parts of speech, and practically construct\r\nthem into syntax.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar situation of the then Marquis de la Fayette is another link\r\nin the great chain. He served in America as an American officer under a\r\ncommission of Congress, and by the universality of his acquaintance was\r\nin close friendship with the civil government of America, as well as\r\nwith the military line. He spoke the language of the country, entered\r\ninto the discussions on the principles of government, and was always a\r\nwelcome friend at any election.\r\n\r\nWhen the war closed, a vast reinforcement to the cause of Liberty spread\r\nitself over France, by the return of the French officers and soldiers.\r\nA knowledge of the practice was then joined to the theory; and all\r\nthat was wanting to give it real existence was opportunity. Man cannot,\r\nproperly speaking, make circumstances for his purpose, but he always has\r\nit in his power to improve them when they occur, and this was the case\r\nin France.\r\n\r\nM. Neckar was displaced in May, 1781; and by the ill-management of\r\nthe finances afterwards, and particularly during the extravagant\r\nadministration of M. Calonne, the revenue of France, which was nearly\r\ntwenty-four millions sterling per year, was become unequal to the\r\nexpenditure, not because the revenue had decreased, but because the\r\nexpenses had increased; and this was a circumstance which the nation\r\nlaid hold of to bring forward a Revolution. The English Minister, Mr.\r\nPitt, has frequently alluded to the state of the French finances in his\r\nbudgets, without understanding the subject. Had the French Parliaments\r\nbeen as ready to register edicts for new taxes as an English Parliament\r\nis to grant them, there had been no derangement in the finances, nor yet\r\nany Revolution; but this will better explain itself as I proceed.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary here to show how taxes were formerly raised in\r\nFrance. The King, or rather the Court or Ministry acting under the use\r\nof that name, framed the edicts for taxes at their own discretion,\r\nand sent them to the Parliaments to be registered; for until they were\r\nregistered by the Parliaments they were not operative. Disputes had long\r\nexisted between the Court and the Parliaments with respect to the extent\r\nof the Parliament's authority on this head. The Court insisted that the\r\nauthority of Parliaments went no farther than to remonstrate or show\r\nreasons against the tax, reserving to itself the right of determining\r\nwhether the reasons were well or ill-founded; and in consequence\r\nthereof, either to withdraw the edict as a matter of choice, or to order\r\nit to be unregistered as a matter of authority. The Parliaments on their\r\npart insisted that they had not only a right to remonstrate, but to\r\nreject; and on this ground they were always supported by the nation.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the order of my narrative. M. Calonne wanted money: and\r\nas he knew the sturdy disposition of the Parliaments with respect to new\r\ntaxes, he ingeniously sought either to approach them by a more gentle\r\nmeans than that of direct authority, or to get over their heads by a\r\nmanoeuvre; and for this purpose he revived the project of assembling a\r\nbody of men from the several provinces, under the style of an \"Assembly\r\nof the Notables,\" or men of note, who met in 1787, and who were either\r\nto recommend taxes to the Parliaments, or to act as a Parliament\r\nthemselves. An Assembly under this name had been called in 1617.\r\n\r\nAs we are to view this as the first practical step towards the\r\nRevolution, it will be proper to enter into some particulars respecting\r\nit. The Assembly of the Notables has in some places been mistaken for\r\nthe States-General, but was wholly a different body, the States-General\r\nbeing always by election. The persons who composed the Assembly of the\r\nNotables were all nominated by the king, and consisted of one hundred\r\nand forty members. But as M. Calonne could not depend upon a majority of\r\nthis Assembly in his favour, he very ingeniously arranged them in such\r\na manner as to make forty-four a majority of one hundred and forty;\r\nto effect this he disposed of them into seven separate committees, of\r\ntwenty members each. Every general question was to be decided, not by a\r\nmajority of persons, but by a majority of committee, and as eleven votes\r\nwould make a majority in a committee, and four committees a majority of\r\nseven, M. Calonne had good reason to conclude that as forty-four would\r\ndetermine any general question he could not be outvoted. But all his\r\nplans deceived him, and in the event became his overthrow.\r\n\r\nThe then Marquis de la Fayette was placed in the second committee, of\r\nwhich the Count D'Artois was president, and as money matters were the\r\nobject, it naturally brought into view every circumstance connected with\r\nit. M. de la Fayette made a verbal charge against Calonne for selling\r\ncrown lands to the amount of two millions of livres, in a manner\r\nthat appeared to be unknown to the king. The Count D'Artois (as if to\r\nintimidate, for the Bastille was then in being) asked the Marquis if he\r\nwould render the charge in writing? He replied that he would. The Count\r\nD'Artois did not demand it, but brought a message from the king to that\r\npurport. M. de la Fayette then delivered in his charge in writing, to\r\nbe given to the king, undertaking to support it. No farther proceedings\r\nwere had upon this affair, but M. Calonne was soon after dismissed by\r\nthe king and set off to England.\r\n\r\nAs M. de la Fayette, from the experience of what he had seen in America,\r\nwas better acquainted with the science of civil government than the\r\ngenerality of the members who composed the Assembly of the Notables\r\ncould then be, the brunt of the business fell considerably to his share.\r\nThe plan of those who had a constitution in view was to contend with the\r\nCourt on the ground of taxes, and some of them openly professed their\r\nobject. Disputes frequently arose between Count D'Artois and M. de\r\nla Fayette upon various subjects. With respect to the arrears already\r\nincurred the latter proposed to remedy them by accommodating the\r\nexpenses to the revenue instead of the revenue to the expenses; and as\r\nobjects of reform he proposed to abolish the Bastille and all the State\r\nprisons throughout the nation (the keeping of which was attended with\r\ngreat expense), and to suppress Lettres de Cachet; but those matters\r\nwere not then much attended to, and with respect to Lettres de Cachet, a\r\nmajority of the Nobles appeared to be in favour of them.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of supplying the Treasury by new taxes the Assembly\r\ndeclined taking the matter on themselves, concurring in the opinion that\r\nthey had not authority. In a debate on this subject M. de la Fayette\r\nsaid that raising money by taxes could only be done by a National\r\nAssembly, freely elected by the people, and acting as their\r\nrepresentatives. Do you mean, said the Count D'Artois, the\r\nStates-General? M. de la Fayette replied that he did. Will you, said\r\nthe Count D'Artois, sign what you say to be given to the king? The other\r\nreplied that he would not only do this but that he would go farther,\r\nand say that the effectual mode would be for the king to agree to the\r\nestablishment of a constitution.\r\n\r\nAs one of the plans had thus failed, that of getting the Assembly to act\r\nas a Parliament, the other came into view, that of recommending. On\r\nthis subject the Assembly agreed to recommend two new taxes to be\r\nunregistered by the Parliament: the one a stamp-tax and the other a\r\nterritorial tax, or sort of land-tax. The two have been estimated\r\nat about five millions sterling per annum. We have now to turn our\r\nattention to the Parliaments, on whom the business was again devolving.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Thoulouse (since Archbishop of Sens, and now a\r\nCardinal), was appointed to the administration of the finances soon\r\nafter the dismission of Calonne. He was also made Prime Minister, an\r\noffice that did not always exist in France. When this office did\r\nnot exist, the chief of each of the principal departments transacted\r\nbusiness immediately with the King, but when a Prime Minister was\r\nappointed they did business only with him. The Archbishop arrived to\r\nmore state authority than any minister since the Duke de Choiseul, and\r\nthe nation was strongly disposed in his favour; but by a line of conduct\r\nscarcely to be accounted for he perverted every opportunity, turned out\r\na despot, and sunk into disgrace, and a Cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of the Notables having broken up, the minister sent\r\nthe edicts for the two new taxes recommended by the Assembly to the\r\nParliaments to be unregistered. They of course came first before the\r\nParliament of Paris, who returned for answer: \"that with such a revenue\r\nas the nation then supported the name of taxes ought not to be mentioned\r\nbut for the purpose of reducing them\"; and threw both the edicts\r\nout.*[8] On this refusal the Parliament was ordered to Versailles,\r\nwhere, in the usual form, the King held what under the old government\r\nwas called a Bed of justice; and the two edicts were unregistered\r\nin presence of the Parliament by an order of State, in the manner\r\nmentioned, earlier. On this the Parliament immediately returned to\r\nParis, renewed their session in form, and ordered the enregistering to\r\nbe struck out, declaring that everything done at Versailles was illegal.\r\nAll the members of the Parliament were then served with Lettres de\r\nCachet, and exiled to Troyes; but as they continued as inflexible in\r\nexile as before, and as vengeance did not supply the place of taxes,\r\nthey were after a short time recalled to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe edicts were again tendered to them, and the Count D'Artois undertook\r\nto act as representative of the King. For this purpose he came from\r\nVersailles to Paris, in a train of procession; and the Parliament were\r\nassembled to receive him. But show and parade had lost their influence\r\nin France; and whatever ideas of importance he might set off with,\r\nhe had to return with those of mortification and disappointment. On\r\nalighting from his carriage to ascend the steps of the Parliament House,\r\nthe crowd (which was numerously collected) threw out trite expressions,\r\nsaying: \"This is Monsieur D'Artois, who wants more of our money to\r\nspend.\" The marked disapprobation which he saw impressed him with\r\napprehensions, and the word Aux armes! (To arms!) was given out by the\r\nofficer of the guard who attended him. It was so loudly vociferated,\r\nthat it echoed through the avenues of the house, and produced a\r\ntemporary confusion. I was then standing in one of the apartments\r\nthrough which he had to pass, and could not avoid reflecting how\r\nwretched was the condition of a disrespected man.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured to impress the Parliament by great words, and opened his\r\nauthority by saying, \"The King, our Lord and Master.\" The Parliament\r\nreceived him very coolly, and with their usual determination not to\r\nregister the taxes: and in this manner the interview ended.\r\n\r\nAfter this a new subject took place: In the various debates and contests\r\nwhich arose between the Court and the Parliaments on the subject of\r\ntaxes, the Parliament of Paris at last declared that although it had\r\nbeen customary for Parliaments to enregister edicts for taxes as a\r\nmatter of convenience, the right belonged only to the States-General;\r\nand that, therefore, the Parliament could no longer with propriety\r\ncontinue to debate on what it had not authority to act. The King after\r\nthis came to Paris and held a meeting with the Parliament, in which he\r\ncontinued from ten in the morning till about six in the evening, and, in\r\na manner that appeared to proceed from him as if unconsulted upon\r\nwith the Cabinet or Ministry, gave his word to the Parliament that the\r\nStates-General should be convened.\r\n\r\nBut after this another scene arose, on a ground different from all\r\nthe former. The Minister and the Cabinet were averse to calling\r\nthe States-General. They well knew that if the States-General were\r\nassembled, themselves must fall; and as the King had not mentioned any\r\ntime, they hit on a project calculated to elude, without appearing to\r\noppose.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, the Court set about making a sort of constitution\r\nitself. It was principally the work of M. Lamoignon, the Keeper of the\r\nSeals, who afterwards shot himself. This new arrangement consisted in\r\nestablishing a body under the name of a Cour Pleniere, or Full Court,\r\nin which were invested all the powers that the Government might have\r\noccasion to make use of. The persons composing this Court were to be\r\nnominated by the King; the contended right of taxation was given up\r\non the part of the King, and a new criminal code of laws and law\r\nproceedings was substituted in the room of the former. The thing, in\r\nmany points, contained better principles than those upon which the\r\nGovernment had hitherto been administered; but with respect to the Cour\r\nPleniere, it was no other than a medium through which despotism was to\r\npass, without appearing to act directly from itself.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet had high expectations from their new contrivance. The people\r\nwho were to compose the Cour Pleniere were already nominated; and as it\r\nwas necessary to carry a fair appearance, many of the best characters in\r\nthe nation were appointed among the number. It was to commence on May\r\n8, 1788; but an opposition arose to it on two grounds the one as to\r\nprinciple, the other as to form.\r\n\r\nOn the ground of Principle it was contended that Government had not a\r\nright to alter itself, and that if the practice was once admitted it\r\nwould grow into a principle and be made a precedent for any future\r\nalterations the Government might wish to establish: that the right\r\nof altering the Government was a national right, and not a right of\r\nGovernment. And on the ground of form it was contended that the Cour\r\nPleniere was nothing more than a larger Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe then Duke de la Rochefoucault, Luxembourg, De Noailles, and many\r\nothers, refused to accept the nomination, and strenuously opposed the\r\nwhole plan. When the edict for establishing this new court was sent to\r\nthe Parliaments to be unregistered and put into execution, they\r\nresisted also. The Parliament of Paris not only refused, but denied the\r\nauthority; and the contest renewed itself between the Parliament and the\r\nCabinet more strongly than ever. While the Parliament were sitting in\r\ndebate on this subject, the Ministry ordered a regiment of soldiers to\r\nsurround the House and form a blockade. The members sent out for beds\r\nand provisions, and lived as in a besieged citadel: and as this had no\r\neffect, the commanding officer was ordered to enter the Parliament House\r\nand seize them, which he did, and some of the principal members were\r\nshut up in different prisons. About the same time a deputation of\r\npersons arrived from the province of Brittany to remonstrate against the\r\nestablishment of the Cour Pleniere, and those the archbishop sent to the\r\nBastille. But the spirit of the nation was not to be overcome, and\r\nit was so fully sensible of the strong ground it had taken--that of\r\nwithholding taxes--that it contented itself with keeping up a sort of\r\nquiet resistance, which effectually overthrew all the plans at that time\r\nformed against it. The project of the Cour Pleniere was at last obliged\r\nto be given up, and the Prime Minister not long afterwards followed its\r\nfate, and M. Neckar was recalled into office.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to establish the Cour Pleniere had an effect upon the nation\r\nwhich itself did not perceive. It was a sort of new form of government\r\nthat insensibly served to put the old one out of sight and to unhinge\r\nit from the superstitious authority of antiquity. It was Government\r\ndethroning Government; and the old one, by attempting to make a new one,\r\nmade a chasm.\r\n\r\nThe failure of this scheme renewed the subject of convening the\r\nState-General; and this gave rise to a new series of politics. There was\r\nno settled form for convening the States-General: all that it positively\r\nmeant was a deputation from what was then called the Clergy, the\r\nNoblesse, and the Commons; but their numbers or their proportions had\r\nnot been always the same. They had been convened only on extraordinary\r\noccasions, the last of which was in 1614; their numbers were then in\r\nequal proportions, and they voted by orders.\r\n\r\nIt could not well escape the sagacity of M. Neckar, that the mode of\r\n1614 would answer neither the purpose of the then government nor of the\r\nnation. As matters were at that time circumstanced it would have been\r\ntoo contentious to agree upon anything. The debates would have been\r\nendless upon privileges and exemptions, in which neither the wants of\r\nthe Government nor the wishes of the nation for a Constitution would\r\nhave been attended to. But as he did not choose to take the decision\r\nupon himself, he summoned again the Assembly of the Notables and\r\nreferred it to them. This body was in general interested in the\r\ndecision, being chiefly of aristocracy and high-paid clergy, and they\r\ndecided in favor of the mode of 1614. This decision was against the\r\nsense of the Nation, and also against the wishes of the Court; for\r\nthe aristocracy opposed itself to both and contended for privileges\r\nindependent of either. The subject was then taken up by the Parliament,\r\nwho recommended that the number of the Commons should be equal to the\r\nother two: and they should all sit in one house and vote in one body.\r\nThe number finally determined on was 1,200; 600 to be chosen by the\r\nCommons (and this was less than their proportion ought to have been when\r\ntheir worth and consequence is considered on a national scale), 300 by\r\nthe Clergy, and 300 by the Aristocracy; but with respect to the mode of\r\nassembling themselves, whether together or apart, or the manner in which\r\nthey should vote, those matters were referred.*[9]\r\n\r\nThe election that followed was not a contested election, but an animated\r\none. The candidates were not men, but principles. Societies were formed\r\nin Paris, and committees of correspondence and communication established\r\nthroughout the nation, for the purpose of enlightening the people, and\r\nexplaining to them the principles of civil government; and so orderly\r\nwas the election conducted, that it did not give rise even to the rumour\r\nof tumult.\r\n\r\nThe States-General were to meet at Versailles in April 1789, but did not\r\nassemble till May. They situated themselves in three separate chambers,\r\nor rather the Clergy and Aristocracy withdrew each into a separate\r\nchamber. The majority of the Aristocracy claimed what they called the\r\nprivilege of voting as a separate body, and of giving their consent\r\nor their negative in that manner; and many of the bishops and the\r\nhigh-beneficed clergy claimed the same privilege on the part of their\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nThe Tiers Etat (as they were then called) disowned any knowledge of\r\nartificial orders and artificial privileges; and they were not only\r\nresolute on this point, but somewhat disdainful. They began to consider\r\nthe Aristocracy as a kind of fungus growing out of the corruption of\r\nsociety, that could not be admitted even as a branch of it; and from the\r\ndisposition the Aristocracy had shown by upholding Lettres de Cachet,\r\nand in sundry other instances, it was manifest that no constitution\r\ncould be formed by admitting men in any other character than as National\r\nMen.\r\n\r\nAfter various altercations on this head, the Tiers Etat or Commons (as\r\nthey were then called) declared themselves (on a motion made for that\r\npurpose by the Abbe Sieyes) \"The Representative Of The Nation; and that\r\nthe two Orders could be considered but as deputies of corporations, and\r\ncould only have a deliberate voice when they assembled in a national\r\ncharacter with the national representatives.\" This proceeding\r\nextinguished the style of Etats Generaux, or States-General, and erected\r\nit into the style it now bears, that of L'Assemblee Nationale, or\r\nNational Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis motion was not made in a precipitate manner. It was the result of\r\ncool deliberation, and concerned between the national representatives\r\nand the patriotic members of the two chambers, who saw into the folly,\r\nmischief, and injustice of artificial privileged distinctions. It was\r\nbecome evident, that no constitution, worthy of being called by that\r\nname, could be established on anything less than a national ground.\r\nThe Aristocracy had hitherto opposed the despotism of the Court, and\r\naffected the language of patriotism; but it opposed it as its rival (as\r\nthe English Barons opposed King John) and it now opposed the nation from\r\nthe same motives.\r\n\r\nOn carrying this motion, the national representatives, as had been\r\nconcerted, sent an invitation to the two chambers, to unite with them in\r\na national character, and proceed to business. A majority of the clergy,\r\nchiefly of the parish priests, withdrew from the clerical chamber, and\r\njoined the nation; and forty-five from the other chamber joined in\r\nlike manner. There is a sort of secret history belonging to this last\r\ncircumstance, which is necessary to its explanation; it was not judged\r\nprudent that all the patriotic members of the chamber styling itself the\r\nNobles, should quit it at once; and in consequence of this arrangement,\r\nthey drew off by degrees, always leaving some, as well to reason the\r\ncase, as to watch the suspected. In a little time the numbers increased\r\nfrom forty-five to eighty, and soon after to a greater number;\r\nwhich, with the majority of the clergy, and the whole of the national\r\nrepresentatives, put the malcontents in a very diminutive condition.\r\n\r\nThe King, who, very different from the general class called by that\r\nname, is a man of a good heart, showed himself disposed to recommend\r\na union of the three chambers, on the ground the National Assembly had\r\ntaken; but the malcontents exerted themselves to prevent it, and began\r\nnow to have another project in view. Their numbers consisted of a\r\nmajority of the aristocratical chamber, and the minority of the clerical\r\nchamber, chiefly of bishops and high-beneficed clergy; and these men\r\nwere determined to put everything to issue, as well by strength as by\r\nstratagem. They had no objection to a constitution; but it must be such\r\na one as themselves should dictate, and suited to their own views and\r\nparticular situations. On the other hand, the Nation disowned knowing\r\nanything of them but as citizens, and was determined to shut out all\r\nsuch up-start pretensions. The more aristocracy appeared, the more it\r\nwas despised; there was a visible imbecility and want of intellects in\r\nthe majority, a sort of je ne sais quoi, that while it affected to be\r\nmore than citizen, was less than man. It lost ground from contempt more\r\nthan from hatred; and was rather jeered at as an ass, than dreaded as a\r\nlion. This is the general character of aristocracy, or what are called\r\nNobles or Nobility, or rather No-ability, in all countries.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the malcontents consisted now of two things; either to\r\ndeliberate and vote by chambers (or orders), more especially on all\r\nquestions respecting a Constitution (by which the aristocratical chamber\r\nwould have had a negative on any article of the Constitution); or, in\r\ncase they could not accomplish this object, to overthrow the National\r\nAssembly entirely.\r\n\r\nTo effect one or other of these objects they began to cultivate a\r\nfriendship with the despotism they had hitherto attempted to rival, and\r\nthe Count D'Artois became their chief. The king (who has since declared\r\nhimself deceived into their measures) held, according to the old form,\r\na Bed of Justice, in which he accorded to the deliberation and vote par\r\ntete (by head) upon several subjects; but reserved the deliberation and\r\nvote upon all questions respecting a constitution to the three chambers\r\nseparately. This declaration of the king was made against the advice of\r\nM. Neckar, who now began to perceive that he was growing out of fashion\r\nat Court, and that another minister was in contemplation.\r\n\r\nAs the form of sitting in separate chambers was yet apparently kept up,\r\nthough essentially destroyed, the national representatives immediately\r\nafter this declaration of the King resorted to their own chambers\r\nto consult on a protest against it; and the minority of the chamber\r\n(calling itself the Nobles), who had joined the national cause, retired\r\nto a private house to consult in like manner. The malcontents had by\r\nthis time concerted their measures with the court, which the Count\r\nD'Artois undertook to conduct; and as they saw from the discontent which\r\nthe declaration excited, and the opposition making against it, that they\r\ncould not obtain a control over the intended constitution by a\r\nseparate vote, they prepared themselves for their final object--that of\r\nconspiring against the National Assembly, and overthrowing it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the door of the chamber of the National Assembly was\r\nshut against them, and guarded by troops; and the members were\r\nrefused admittance. On this they withdrew to a tennis-ground in the\r\nneighbourhood of Versailles, as the most convenient place they could\r\nfind, and, after renewing their session, took an oath never to separate\r\nfrom each other, under any circumstance whatever, death excepted, until\r\nthey had established a constitution. As the experiment of shutting up\r\nthe house had no other effect than that of producing a closer connection\r\nin the members, it was opened again the next day, and the public\r\nbusiness recommenced in the usual place.\r\n\r\nWe are now to have in view the forming of the new ministry, which was to\r\naccomplish the overthrow of the National Assembly. But as force would\r\nbe necessary, orders were issued to assemble thirty thousand troops, the\r\ncommand of which was given to Broglio, one of the intended new ministry,\r\nwho was recalled from the country for this purpose. But as some\r\nmanagement was necessary to keep this plan concealed till the moment it\r\nshould be ready for execution, it is to this policy that a declaration\r\nmade by Count D'Artois must be attributed, and which is here proper to\r\nbe introduced.\r\n\r\nIt could not but occur while the malcontents continued to resort to\r\ntheir chambers separate from the National Assembly, more jealousy would\r\nbe excited than if they were mixed with it, and that the plot might be\r\nsuspected. But as they had taken their ground, and now wanted a pretence\r\nfor quitting it, it was necessary that one should be devised. This was\r\neffectually accomplished by a declaration made by the Count D'Artois:\r\n\"That if they took not a Part in the National Assembly, the life of the\r\nking would be endangered\": on which they quitted their chambers, and\r\nmixed with the Assembly, in one body.\r\n\r\nAt the time this declaration was made, it was generally treated as a\r\npiece of absurdity in Count D'Artois calculated merely to relieve the\r\noutstanding members of the two chambers from the diminutive situation\r\nthey were put in; and if nothing more had followed, this conclusion\r\nwould have been good. But as things best explain themselves by their\r\nevents, this apparent union was only a cover to the machinations which\r\nwere secretly going on; and the declaration accommodated itself to\r\nanswer that purpose. In a little time the National Assembly found itself\r\nsurrounded by troops, and thousands more were daily arriving. On this a\r\nvery strong declaration was made by the National Assembly to the King,\r\nremonstrating on the impropriety of the measure, and demanding the\r\nreason. The King, who was not in the secret of this business, as himself\r\nafterwards declared, gave substantially for answer, that he had no other\r\nobject in view than to preserve the public tranquility, which appeared\r\nto be much disturbed.\r\n\r\nBut in a few days from this time the plot unravelled itself M. Neckar\r\nand the ministry were displaced, and a new one formed of the enemies\r\nof the Revolution; and Broglio, with between twenty-five and thirty\r\nthousand foreign troops, was arrived to support them. The mask was now\r\nthrown off, and matters were come to a crisis. The event was that in a\r\nspace of three days the new ministry and their abettors found it prudent\r\nto fly the nation; the Bastille was taken, and Broglio and his foreign\r\ntroops dispersed, as is already related in the former part of this work.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious circumstances in the history of this short-lived\r\nministry, and this short-lived attempt at a counter-revolution. The\r\nPalace of Versailles, where the Court was sitting, was not more than\r\nfour hundred yards distant from the hall where the National Assembly\r\nwas sitting. The two places were at this moment like the separate\r\nheadquarters of two combatant armies; yet the Court was as perfectly\r\nignorant of the information which had arrived from Paris to the National\r\nAssembly, as if it had resided at an hundred miles distance. The then\r\nMarquis de la Fayette, who (as has been already mentioned) was chosen to\r\npreside in the National Assembly on this particular occasion, named by\r\norder of the Assembly three successive deputations to the king, on the\r\nday and up to the evening on which the Bastille was taken, to inform and\r\nconfer with him on the state of affairs; but the ministry, who knew not\r\nso much as that it was attacked, precluded all communication, and were\r\nsolacing themselves how dextrously they had succeeded; but in a few\r\nhours the accounts arrived so thick and fast that they had to start from\r\ntheir desks and run. Some set off in one disguise, and some in another,\r\nand none in their own character. Their anxiety now was to outride the\r\nnews, lest they should be stopt, which, though it flew fast, flew not so\r\nfast as themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking that the National Assembly neither pursued those\r\nfugitive conspirators, nor took any notice of them, nor sought\r\nto retaliate in any shape whatever. Occupied with establishing a\r\nconstitution founded on the Rights of Man and the Authority of the\r\nPeople, the only authority on which Government has a right to exist\r\nin any country, the National Assembly felt none of those mean passions\r\nwhich mark the character of impertinent governments, founding themselves\r\non their own authority, or on the absurdity of hereditary succession. It\r\nis the faculty of the human mind to become what it contemplates, and to\r\nact in unison with its object.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy being thus dispersed, one of the first works of the\r\nNational Assembly, instead of vindictive proclamations, as has been the\r\ncase with other governments, was to publish a declaration of the Rights\r\nof Man, as the basis on which the new constitution was to be built, and\r\nwhich is here subjoined:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Declaration\r\n\r\n                                Of The\r\n\r\n                    Rights Of Man And Of Citizens\r\n\r\n                  By The National Assembly Of France\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the people of France, formed into a National\r\nAssembly, considering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt of human\r\nrights, are the sole causes of public misfortunes and corruptions of\r\nGovernment, have resolved to set forth in a solemn declaration, these\r\nnatural, imprescriptible, and inalienable rights: that this declaration\r\nbeing constantly present to the minds of the members of the body social,\r\nthey may be forever kept attentive to their rights and their duties;\r\nthat the acts of the legislative and executive powers of Government,\r\nbeing capable of being every moment compared with the end of political\r\ninstitutions, may be more respected; and also, that the future claims of\r\nthe citizens, being directed by simple and incontestable principles,\r\nmay always tend to the maintenance of the Constitution, and the general\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the National Assembly doth recognize and declare, in\r\nthe presence of the Supreme Being, and with the hope of his blessing and\r\nfavour, the following sacred rights of men and of citizens:\r\n\r\nOne: Men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of\r\ntheir Rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on\r\nPublic Utility.\r\n\r\nTwo: The end of all Political associations is the Preservation of the\r\nNatural and Imprescriptible Rights of Man; and these rights are Liberty,\r\nProperty, Security, and Resistance of Oppression.\r\n\r\nThree: The Nation is essentially the source of all Sovereignty; nor can\r\nany individual, or any body of Men, be entitled to any authority which\r\nis not expressly derived from it.\r\n\r\nFour: Political Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not\r\nInjure another. The exercise of the Natural Rights of every Man, has no\r\nother limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other Man\r\nthe Free exercise of the same Rights; and these limits are determinable\r\nonly by the Law.\r\n\r\nFive: The Law ought to Prohibit only actions hurtful to Society. What is\r\nnot Prohibited by the Law should not be hindered; nor should anyone be\r\ncompelled to that which the Law does not Require.\r\n\r\nSix: the Law is an expression of the Will of the Community. All Citizens\r\nhave a right to concur, either personally or by their Representatives,\r\nin its formation. It Should be the same to all, whether it protects or\r\npunishes; and all being equal in its sight, are equally eligible to\r\nall Honours, Places, and employments, according to their different\r\nabilities, without any other distinction than that created by their\r\nVirtues and talents.\r\n\r\nSeven: No Man should be accused, arrested, or held in confinement,\r\nexcept in cases determined by the Law, and according to the forms which\r\nit has prescribed. All who promote, solicit, execute, or cause to be\r\nexecuted, arbitrary orders, ought to be punished, and every Citizen\r\ncalled upon, or apprehended by virtue of the Law, ought immediately to\r\nobey, and renders himself culpable by resistance.\r\n\r\nEight: The Law ought to impose no other penalties but such as are\r\nabsolutely and evidently necessary; and no one ought to be punished, but\r\nin virtue of a Law promulgated before the offence, and Legally applied.\r\n\r\nNine: Every Man being presumed innocent till he has been convicted,\r\nwhenever his detention becomes indispensable, all rigour to him, more\r\nthan is necessary to secure his person, ought to be provided against by\r\nthe Law.\r\n\r\nTen: No Man ought to be molested on account of his opinions, not even on\r\naccount of his Religious opinions, provided his avowal of them does not\r\ndisturb the Public Order established by the Law.\r\n\r\nEleven: The unrestrained communication of thoughts and opinions being\r\none of the Most Precious Rights of Man, every Citizen may speak, write,\r\nand publish freely, provided he is responsible for the abuse of this\r\nLiberty, in cases determined by the Law.\r\n\r\nTwelve: A Public force being necessary to give security to the Rights\r\nof Men and of Citizens, that force is instituted for the benefit of the\r\nCommunity and not for the particular benefit of the persons to whom it\r\nis intrusted.\r\n\r\nThirteen: A common contribution being necessary for the support of the\r\nPublic force, and for defraying the other expenses of Government,\r\nit ought to be divided equally among the Members of the Community,\r\naccording to their abilities.\r\n\r\nFourteen: every Citizen has a Right, either by himself or his\r\nRepresentative, to a free voice in determining the necessity of Public\r\nContributions, the appropriation of them, and their amount, mode of\r\nassessment, and duration.\r\n\r\nFifteen: every Community has a Right to demand of all its agents an\r\naccount of their conduct.\r\n\r\nSixteen: every Community in which a Separation of Powers and a Security\r\nof Rights is not Provided for, wants a Constitution.\r\n\r\nSeventeen: The Right to Property being inviolable and sacred, no one\r\nought to be deprived of it, except in cases of evident Public necessity,\r\nlegally ascertained, and on condition of a previous just Indemnity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe first three articles comprehend in general terms the whole of a\r\nDeclaration of Rights, all the succeeding articles either originate\r\nfrom them or follow as elucidations. The 4th, 5th, and 6th define more\r\nparticularly what is only generally expressed in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.\r\n\r\nThe 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th articles are declaratory of principles\r\nupon which laws shall be constructed, conformable to rights already\r\ndeclared. But it is questioned by some very good people in France,\r\nas well as in other countries, whether the 10th article sufficiently\r\nguarantees the right it is intended to accord with; besides which it\r\ntakes off from the divine dignity of religion, and weakens its operative\r\nforce upon the mind, to make it a subject of human laws. It then\r\npresents itself to man like light intercepted by a cloudy medium, in\r\nwhich the source of it is obscured from his sight, and he sees nothing\r\nto reverence in the dusky ray.*[10]\r\n\r\nThe remaining articles, beginning with the twelfth, are substantially\r\ncontained in the principles of the preceding articles; but in the\r\nparticular situation in which France then was, having to undo what was\r\nwrong, as well as to set up what was right, it was proper to be more\r\nparticular than what in another condition of things would be necessary.\r\n\r\nWhile the Declaration of Rights was before the National Assembly some of\r\nits members remarked that if a declaration of rights were published\r\nit should be accompanied by a Declaration of Duties. The observation\r\ndiscovered a mind that reflected, and it only erred by not reflecting\r\nfar enough. A Declaration of Rights is, by reciprocity, a Declaration of\r\nDuties also. Whatever is my right as a man is also the right of another;\r\nand it becomes my duty to guarantee as well as to possess.\r\n\r\nThe three first articles are the base of Liberty, as well individual as\r\nnational; nor can any country be called free whose government does not\r\ntake its beginning from the principles they contain, and continue to\r\npreserve them pure; and the whole of the Declaration of Rights is of\r\nmore value to the world, and will do more good, than all the laws and\r\nstatutes that have yet been promulgated.\r\n\r\nIn the declaratory exordium which prefaces the Declaration of Rights\r\nwe see the solemn and majestic spectacle of a nation opening its\r\ncommission, under the auspices of its Creator, to establish a\r\nGovernment, a scene so new, and so transcendantly unequalled by anything\r\nin the European world, that the name of a Revolution is diminutive of\r\nits character, and it rises into a Regeneration of man. What are the\r\npresent Governments of Europe but a scene of iniquity and oppression?\r\nWhat is that of England? Do not its own inhabitants say it is a market\r\nwhere every man has his price, and where corruption is common traffic\r\nat the expense of a deluded people? No wonder, then, that the French\r\nRevolution is traduced. Had it confined itself merely to the destruction\r\nof flagrant despotism perhaps Mr. Burke and some others had been silent.\r\nTheir cry now is, \"It has gone too far\"--that is, it has gone too far\r\nfor them. It stares corruption in the face, and the venal tribe are all\r\nalarmed. Their fear discovers itself in their outrage, and they are but\r\npublishing the groans of a wounded vice. But from such opposition the\r\nFrench Revolution, instead of suffering, receives an homage. The more it\r\nis struck the more sparks it will emit; and the fear is it will not be\r\nstruck enough. It has nothing to dread from attacks; truth has given it\r\nan establishment, and time will record it with a name as lasting as his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nHaving now traced the progress of the French Revolution through most\r\nof its principal stages, from its commencement to the taking of the\r\nBastille, and its establishment by the Declaration of Rights, I will\r\nclose the subject with the energetic apostrophe of M. de la Fayette,\r\n\"May this great monument, raised to Liberty, serve as a lesson to the\r\noppressor, and an example to the oppressed!\"*[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MISCELLANEOUS CHAPTER\r\n\r\nTo prevent interrupting the argument in the preceding part of this work,\r\nor the narrative that follows it, I reserved some observations to be\r\nthrown together in a Miscellaneous Chapter; by which variety might\r\nnot be censured for confusion. Mr. Burke's book is all Miscellany. His\r\nintention was to make an attack on the French Revolution; but instead of\r\nproceeding with an orderly arrangement, he has stormed it with a mob of\r\nideas tumbling over and destroying one another.\r\n\r\nBut this confusion and contradiction in Mr. Burke's Book is easily\r\naccounted for.--When a man in a wrong cause attempts to steer his course\r\nby anything else than some polar truth or principle, he is sure to be\r\nlost. It is beyond the compass of his capacity to keep all the parts\r\nof an argument together, and make them unite in one issue, by any\r\nother means than having this guide always in view. Neither memory nor\r\ninvention will supply the want of it. The former fails him, and the\r\nlatter betrays him.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the nonsense, for it deserves no better name, that Mr.\r\nBurke has asserted about hereditary rights, and hereditary succession,\r\nand that a Nation has not a right to form a Government of itself; it\r\nhappened to fall in his way to give some account of what Government is.\r\n\"Government,\" says he, \"is a contrivance of human wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nAdmitting that government is a contrivance of human wisdom, it must\r\nnecessarily follow, that hereditary succession, and hereditary rights\r\n(as they are called), can make no part of it, because it is impossible\r\nto make wisdom hereditary; and on the other hand, that cannot be a\r\nwise contrivance, which in its operation may commit the government of a\r\nnation to the wisdom of an idiot. The ground which Mr. Burke now\r\ntakes is fatal to every part of his cause. The argument changes from\r\nhereditary rights to hereditary wisdom; and the question is, Who is the\r\nwisest man? He must now show that every one in the line of hereditary\r\nsuccession was a Solomon, or his title is not good to be a king. What a\r\nstroke has Mr. Burke now made! To use a sailor's phrase, he has swabbed\r\nthe deck, and scarcely left a name legible in the list of Kings; and\r\nhe has mowed down and thinned the House of Peers, with a scythe as\r\nformidable as Death and Time.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Burke appears to have been aware of this retort; and he has\r\ntaken care to guard against it, by making government to be not only\r\na contrivance of human wisdom, but a monopoly of wisdom. He puts the\r\nnation as fools on one side, and places his government of wisdom, all\r\nwise men of Gotham, on the other side; and he then proclaims, and says\r\nthat \"Men have a Right that their Wants should be provided for by this\r\nwisdom.\" Having thus made proclamation, he next proceeds to explain to\r\nthem what their wants are, and also what their rights are. In this\r\nhe has succeeded dextrously, for he makes their wants to be a want of\r\nwisdom; but as this is cold comfort, he then informs them, that they\r\nhave a right (not to any of the wisdom) but to be governed by it; and\r\nin order to impress them with a solemn reverence for this\r\nmonopoly-government of wisdom, and of its vast capacity for all\r\npurposes, possible or impossible, right or wrong, he proceeds with\r\nastrological mysterious importance, to tell to them its powers in these\r\nwords: \"The rights of men in government are their advantages; and these\r\nare often in balance between differences of good; and in compromises\r\nsometimes between good and evil, and sometimes between\r\nevil and evil. Political reason is a computing principle;\r\nadding--subtracting--multiplying--and dividing, morally and not\r\nmetaphysically or mathematically, true moral denominations.\"\r\n\r\nAs the wondering audience, whom Mr. Burke supposes himself talking to,\r\nmay not understand all this learned jargon, I will undertake to be\r\nits interpreter. The meaning, then, good people, of all this, is: That\r\ngovernment is governed by no principle whatever; that it can make evil\r\ngood, or good evil, just as it pleases. In short, that government is\r\narbitrary power.\r\n\r\nBut there are some things which Mr. Burke has forgotten. First, he has\r\nnot shown where the wisdom originally came from: and secondly, he has\r\nnot shown by what authority it first began to act. In the manner he\r\nintroduces the matter, it is either government stealing wisdom, or\r\nwisdom stealing government. It is without an origin, and its powers\r\nwithout authority. In short, it is usurpation.\r\n\r\nWhether it be from a sense of shame, or from a consciousness of some\r\nradical defect in a government necessary to be kept out of sight, or\r\nfrom both, or from any other cause, I undertake not to determine, but\r\nso it is, that a monarchical reasoner never traces government to its\r\nsource, or from its source. It is one of the shibboleths by which he\r\nmay be known. A thousand years hence, those who shall live in America or\r\nFrance, will look back with contemplative pride on the origin of their\r\ngovernment, and say, This was the work of our glorious ancestors! But\r\nwhat can a monarchical talker say? What has he to exult in? Alas he has\r\nnothing. A certain something forbids him to look back to a beginning,\r\nlest some robber, or some Robin Hood, should rise from the long\r\nobscurity of time and say, I am the origin. Hard as Mr. Burke laboured\r\nat the Regency Bill and Hereditary Succession two years ago, and much\r\nas he dived for precedents, he still had not boldness enough to bring\r\nup William of Normandy, and say, There is the head of the list! there\r\nis the fountain of honour! the son of a prostitute, and the plunderer of\r\nthe English nation.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of men with respect to government are changing fast in all\r\ncountries. The Revolutions of America and France have thrown a beam of\r\nlight over the world, which reaches into man. The enormous expense of\r\ngovernments has provoked people to think, by making them feel; and when\r\nonce the veil begins to rend, it admits not of repair. Ignorance is of a\r\npeculiar nature: once dispelled, it is impossible to re-establish it.\r\nIt is not originally a thing of itself, but is only the absence of\r\nknowledge; and though man may be kept ignorant, he cannot be made\r\nignorant. The mind, in discovering truth, acts in the same manner as it\r\nacts through the eye in discovering objects; when once any object has\r\nbeen seen, it is impossible to put the mind back to the same condition\r\nit was in before it saw it. Those who talk of a counter-revolution in\r\nFrance, show how little they understand of man. There does not exist in\r\nthe compass of language an arrangement of words to express so much\r\nas the means of effecting a counter-revolution. The means must be an\r\nobliteration of knowledge; and it has never yet been discovered how to\r\nmake man unknow his knowledge, or unthink his thoughts.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke is labouring in vain to stop the progress of knowledge; and it\r\ncomes with the worse grace from him, as there is a certain transaction\r\nknown in the city which renders him suspected of being a pensioner in\r\na fictitious name. This may account for some strange doctrine he has\r\nadvanced in his book, which though he points it at the Revolution\r\nSociety, is effectually directed against the whole nation.\r\n\r\n\"The King of England,\" says he, \"holds his crown (for it does not belong\r\nto the Nation, according to Mr. Burke) in contempt of the choice of the\r\nRevolution Society, who have not a single vote for a king among them\r\neither individually or collectively; and his Majesty's heirs each in\r\ntheir time and order, will come to the Crown with the same contempt of\r\ntheir choice, with which his Majesty has succeeded to that which he now\r\nwears.\"\r\n\r\nAs to who is King in England, or elsewhere, or whether there is any\r\nKing at all, or whether the people choose a Cherokee chief, or a Hessian\r\nhussar for a King, it is not a matter that I trouble myself about--be\r\nthat to themselves; but with respect to the doctrine, so far as it\r\nrelates to the Rights of Men and Nations, it is as abominable as\r\nanything ever uttered in the most enslaved country under heaven.\r\nWhether it sounds worse to my ear, by not being accustomed to hear such\r\ndespotism, than what it does to another person, I am not so well a judge\r\nof; but of its abominable principle I am at no loss to judge.\r\n\r\nIt is not the Revolution Society that Mr. Burke means; it is the Nation,\r\nas well in its original as in its representative character; and he has\r\ntaken care to make himself understood, by saying that they have not\r\na vote either collectively or individually. The Revolution Society is\r\ncomposed of citizens of all denominations, and of members of both the\r\nHouses of Parliament; and consequently, if there is not a right to a\r\nvote in any of the characters, there can be no right to any either in\r\nthe nation or in its Parliament. This ought to be a caution to every\r\ncountry how to import foreign families to be kings. It is somewhat\r\ncurious to observe, that although the people of England had been in the\r\nhabit of talking about kings, it is always a Foreign House of Kings;\r\nhating Foreigners yet governed by them.--It is now the House of\r\nBrunswick, one of the petty tribes of Germany.\r\n\r\nIt has hitherto been the practice of the English Parliaments to regulate\r\nwhat was called the succession (taking it for granted that the Nation\r\nthen continued to accord to the form of annexing a monarchical branch\r\nof its government; for without this the Parliament could not have had\r\nauthority to have sent either to Holland or to Hanover, or to impose\r\na king upon the nation against its will). And this must be the utmost\r\nlimit to which Parliament can go upon this case; but the right of the\r\nNation goes to the whole case, because it has the right of changing its\r\nwhole form of government. The right of a Parliament is only a right in\r\ntrust, a right by delegation, and that but from a very small part of the\r\nNation; and one of its Houses has not even this. But the right of the\r\nNation is an original right, as universal as taxation. The nation is\r\nthe paymaster of everything, and everything must conform to its general\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nI remember taking notice of a speech in what is called the English House\r\nof Peers, by the then Earl of Shelburne, and I think it was at the time\r\nhe was Minister, which is applicable to this case. I do not directly\r\ncharge my memory with every particular; but the words and the purport,\r\nas nearly as I remember, were these: \"That the form of a Government was\r\na matter wholly at the will of the Nation at all times, that if it chose\r\na monarchical form, it had a right to have it so; and if it afterwards\r\nchose to be a Republic, it had a right to be a Republic, and to say to a\r\nKing, 'We have no longer any occasion for you.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Burke says that \"His Majesty's heirs and successors, each in\r\ntheir time and order, will come to the crown with the same content of\r\ntheir choice with which His Majesty had succeeded to that he wears,\" it\r\nis saying too much even to the humblest individual in the country;\r\npart of whose daily labour goes towards making up the million sterling\r\na-year, which the country gives the person it styles a king. Government\r\nwith insolence is despotism; but when contempt is added it becomes\r\nworse; and to pay for contempt is the excess of slavery. This species\r\nof government comes from Germany; and reminds me of what one of the\r\nBrunswick soldiers told me, who was taken prisoner by, the Americans\r\nin the late war: \"Ah!\" said he, \"America is a fine free country, it is\r\nworth the people's fighting for; I know the difference by knowing my\r\nown: in my country, if the prince says eat straw, we eat straw.\"\r\nGod help that country, thought I, be it England or elsewhere, whose\r\nliberties are to be protected by German principles of government, and\r\nPrinces of Brunswick!\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Burke sometimes speaks of England, sometimes of France, and\r\nsometimes of the world, and of government in general, it is difficult\r\nto answer his book without apparently meeting him on the same ground.\r\nAlthough principles of Government are general subjects, it is next to\r\nimpossible, in many cases, to separate them from the idea of place and\r\ncircumstance, and the more so when circumstances are put for arguments,\r\nwhich is frequently the case with Mr. Burke.\r\n\r\nIn the former part of his book, addressing himself to the people of\r\nFrance, he says: \"No experience has taught us (meaning the English),\r\nthat in any other course or method than that of a hereditary crown,\r\ncan our liberties be regularly perpetuated and preserved sacred as our\r\nhereditary right.\" I ask Mr. Burke, who is to take them away? M. de la\r\nFayette, in speaking to France, says: \"For a Nation to be free, it\r\nis sufficient that she wills it.\" But Mr. Burke represents England as\r\nwanting capacity to take care of itself, and that its liberties must be\r\ntaken care of by a King holding it in \"contempt.\" If England is sunk\r\nto this, it is preparing itself to eat straw, as in Hanover, or in\r\nBrunswick. But besides the folly of the declaration, it happens that\r\nthe facts are all against Mr. Burke. It was by the government being\r\nhereditary, that the liberties of the people were endangered. Charles I.\r\nand James II. are instances of this truth; yet neither of them went so\r\nfar as to hold the Nation in contempt.\r\n\r\nAs it is sometimes of advantage to the people of one country to hear\r\nwhat those of other countries have to say respecting it, it is possible\r\nthat the people of France may learn something from Mr. Burke's book, and\r\nthat the people of England may also learn something from the answers\r\nit will occasion. When Nations fall out about freedom, a wide field of\r\ndebate is opened. The argument commences with the rights of war, without\r\nits evils, and as knowledge is the object contended for, the party that\r\nsustains the defeat obtains the prize.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke talks about what he calls an hereditary crown, as if it\r\nwere some production of Nature; or as if, like Time, it had a power to\r\noperate, not only independently, but in spite of man; or as if it were a\r\nthing or a subject universally consented to. Alas! it has none of\r\nthose properties, but is the reverse of them all. It is a thing in\r\nimagination, the propriety of which is more than doubted, and the\r\nlegality of which in a few years will be denied.\r\n\r\nBut, to arrange this matter in a clearer view than what general\r\nexpression can heads under which (what is called) an hereditary crown,\r\nor more properly speaking, an hereditary succession to the Government of\r\na Nation, can be considered; which are:\r\n\r\nFirst, The right of a particular Family to establish itself.\r\n\r\nSecondly, The right of a Nation to establish a particular Family.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first of these heads, that of a Family establishing\r\nitself with hereditary powers on its own authority, and independent of\r\nthe consent of a Nation, all men will concur in calling it despotism;\r\nand it would be trespassing on their understanding to attempt to prove\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut the second head, that of a Nation establishing a particular Family\r\nwith hereditary powers, does not present itself as despotism on the\r\nfirst reflection; but if men will permit it a second reflection to take\r\nplace, and carry that reflection forward but one remove out of their own\r\npersons to that of their offspring, they will then see that hereditary\r\nsuccession becomes in its consequences the same despotism to others,\r\nwhich they reprobated for themselves. It operates to preclude the\r\nconsent of the succeeding generations; and the preclusion of consent is\r\ndespotism. When the person who at any time shall be in possession of\r\na Government, or those who stand in succession to him, shall say to a\r\nNation, I hold this power in \"contempt\" of you, it signifies not on what\r\nauthority he pretends to say it. It is no relief, but an aggravation to\r\na person in slavery, to reflect that he was sold by his parent; and as\r\nthat which heightens the criminality of an act cannot be produced to\r\nprove the legality of it, hereditary succession cannot be established as\r\na legal thing.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at a more perfect decision on this head, it will be\r\nproper to consider the generation which undertakes to establish a Family\r\nwith hereditary powers, apart and separate from the generations which\r\nare to follow; and also to consider the character in which the first\r\ngeneration acts with respect to succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nThe generation which first selects a person, and puts him at the head of\r\nits Government, either with the title of King, or any other distinction,\r\nacts on its own choice, be it wise or foolish, as a free agent for\r\nitself The person so set up is not hereditary, but selected and\r\nappointed; and the generation who sets him up, does not live under a\r\nhereditary government, but under a government of its own choice and\r\nestablishment. Were the generation who sets him up, and the person so\r\nset up, to live for ever, it never could become hereditary succession;\r\nand of consequence hereditary succession can only follow on the death of\r\nthe first parties.\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, hereditary succession is out of the question with respect\r\nto the first generation, we have now to consider the character in which\r\nthat generation acts with respect to the commencing generation, and to\r\nall succeeding ones.\r\n\r\nIt assumes a character, to which it has neither right nor title. It\r\nchanges itself from a Legislator to a Testator, and effects to make\r\nits Will, which is to have operation after the demise of the makers, to\r\nbequeath the Government; and it not only attempts to bequeath, but to\r\nestablish on the succeeding generation, a new and different form of\r\nGovernment under which itself lived. Itself, as already observed, lived\r\nnot under a hereditary Government but under a Government of its own\r\nchoice and establishment; and it now attempts, by virtue of a will and\r\ntestament (and which it has not authority to make), to take from the\r\ncommencing generation, and all future ones, the rights and free agency\r\nby which itself acted.\r\n\r\nBut, exclusive of the right which any generation has to act collectively\r\nas a testator, the objects to which it applies itself in this case, are\r\nnot within the compass of any law, or of any will or testament.\r\n\r\nThe rights of men in society, are neither devisable or transferable, nor\r\nannihilable, but are descendable only, and it is not in the power of any\r\ngeneration to intercept finally, and cut off the descent. If the present\r\ngeneration, or any other, are disposed to be slaves, it does not lessen\r\nthe right of the succeeding generation to be free. Wrongs cannot have\r\na legal descent. When Mr. Burke attempts to maintain that the English\r\nnation did at the Revolution of 1688, most solemnly renounce and\r\nabdicate their rights for themselves, and for all their posterity for\r\never, he speaks a language that merits not reply, and which can\r\nonly excite contempt for his prostitute principles, or pity for his\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nIn whatever light hereditary succession, as growing out of the will\r\nand testament of some former generation, presents itself, it is an\r\nabsurdity. A cannot make a will to take from B the property of B,\r\nand give it to C; yet this is the manner in which (what is called)\r\nhereditary succession by law operates. A certain former generation made\r\na will, to take away the rights of the commencing generation, and all\r\nfuture ones, and convey those rights to a third person, who afterwards\r\ncomes forward, and tells them, in Mr. Burke's language, that they have\r\nno rights, that their rights are already bequeathed to him and that\r\nhe will govern in contempt of them. From such principles, and such\r\nignorance, good Lord deliver the world!\r\n\r\nBut, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what\r\nis monarchy? Is it a thing, or is it a name, or is it a fraud? Is it a\r\n\"contrivance of human wisdom,\" or of human craft to obtain money from a\r\nnation under specious pretences? Is it a thing necessary to a nation?\r\nIf it is, in what does that necessity consist, what service does it\r\nperform, what is its business, and what are its merits? Does the virtue\r\nconsist in the metaphor, or in the man? Doth the goldsmith that makes\r\nthe crown, make the virtue also? Doth it operate like Fortunatus's\r\nwishing-cap, or Harlequin's wooden sword? Doth it make a man a conjurer?\r\nIn fine, what is it? It appears to be something going much out of\r\nfashion, falling into ridicule, and rejected in some countries, both as\r\nunnecessary and expensive. In America it is considered as an absurdity;\r\nand in France it has so far declined, that the goodness of the man,\r\nand the respect for his personal character, are the only things that\r\npreserve the appearance of its existence.\r\n\r\nIf government be what Mr. Burke describes it, \"a contrivance of human\r\nwisdom\" I might ask him, if wisdom was at such a low ebb in England,\r\nthat it was become necessary to import it from Holland and from Hanover?\r\nBut I will do the country the justice to say, that was not the case; and\r\neven if it was it mistook the cargo. The wisdom of every country, when\r\nproperly exerted, is sufficient for all its purposes; and there\r\ncould exist no more real occasion in England to have sent for a Dutch\r\nStadtholder, or a German Elector, than there was in America to have done\r\na similar thing. If a country does not understand its own affairs,\r\nhow is a foreigner to understand them, who knows neither its laws, its\r\nmanners, nor its language? If there existed a man so transcendently wise\r\nabove all others, that his wisdom was necessary to instruct a nation,\r\nsome reason might be offered for monarchy; but when we cast our eyes\r\nabout a country, and observe how every part understands its own affairs;\r\nand when we look around the world, and see that of all men in it, the\r\nrace of kings are the most insignificant in capacity, our reason cannot\r\nfail to ask us--What are those men kept for?\r\n\r\nIf there is anything in monarchy which we people of America do not\r\nunderstand, I wish Mr. Burke would be so kind as to inform us. I see\r\nin America, a government extending over a country ten times as large\r\nas England, and conducted with regularity, for a fortieth part of the\r\nexpense which Government costs in England. If I ask a man in America if\r\nhe wants a King, he retorts, and asks me if I take him for an idiot?\r\nHow is it that this difference happens? are we more or less wise than\r\nothers? I see in America the generality of people living in a style of\r\nplenty unknown in monarchical countries; and I see that the principle\r\nof its government, which is that of the equal Rights of Man, is making a\r\nrapid progress in the world.\r\n\r\nIf monarchy is a useless thing, why is it kept up anywhere? and if a\r\nnecessary thing, how can it be dispensed with? That civil government\r\nis necessary, all civilized nations will agree; but civil government is\r\nrepublican government. All that part of the government of England which\r\nbegins with the office of constable, and proceeds through the department\r\nof magistrate, quarter-sessions, and general assize, including trial by\r\njury, is republican government. Nothing of monarchy appears in any part\r\nof it, except in the name which William the Conqueror imposed upon the\r\nEnglish, that of obliging them to call him \"Their Sovereign Lord the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive that a band of interested men, such as Placemen,\r\nPensioners, Lords of the bed-chamber, Lords of the kitchen, Lords of\r\nthe necessary-house, and the Lord knows what besides, can find as many\r\nreasons for monarchy as their salaries, paid at the expense of the\r\ncountry, amount to; but if I ask the farmer, the manufacturer, the\r\nmerchant, the tradesman, and down through all the occupations of life to\r\nthe common labourer, what service monarchy is to him? he can give me no\r\nanswer. If I ask him what monarchy is, he believes it is something like\r\na sinecure.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the taxes of England amount to almost seventeen millions\r\na year, said to be for the expenses of Government, it is still evident\r\nthat the sense of the Nation is left to govern itself, and does\r\ngovern itself, by magistrates and juries, almost at its own charge, on\r\nrepublican principles, exclusive of the expense of taxes. The salaries\r\nof the judges are almost the only charge that is paid out of the\r\nrevenue. Considering that all the internal government is executed by the\r\npeople, the taxes of England ought to be the lightest of any nation\r\nin Europe; instead of which, they are the contrary. As this cannot be\r\naccounted for on the score of civil government, the subject necessarily\r\nextends itself to the monarchical part.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of England sent for George the First (and it would\r\npuzzle a wiser man than Mr. Burke to discover for what he could be\r\nwanted, or what service he could render), they ought at least to have\r\nconditioned for the abandonment of Hanover. Besides the endless German\r\nintrigues that must follow from a German Elector being King of England,\r\nthere is a natural impossibility of uniting in the same person the\r\nprinciples of Freedom and the principles of Despotism, or as it is\r\nusually called in England Arbitrary Power. A German Elector is in his\r\nelectorate a despot; how then could it be expected that he should be\r\nattached to principles of liberty in one country, while his interest in\r\nanother was to be supported by despotism? The union cannot exist; and it\r\nmight easily have been foreseen that German Electors would make German\r\nKings, or in Mr. Burke's words, would assume government with \"contempt.\"\r\nThe English have been in the habit of considering a King of England only\r\nin the character in which he appears to them; whereas the same person,\r\nwhile the connection lasts, has a home-seat in another country, the\r\ninterest of which is different to their own, and the principles of the\r\ngovernments in opposition to each other. To such a person England\r\nwill appear as a town-residence, and the Electorate as the estate. The\r\nEnglish may wish, as I believe they do, success to the principles of\r\nliberty in France, or in Germany; but a German Elector trembles for\r\nthe fate of despotism in his electorate; and the Duchy of Mecklenburgh,\r\nwhere the present Queen's family governs, is under the same wretched\r\nstate of arbitrary power, and the people in slavish vassalage.\r\n\r\nThere never was a time when it became the English to watch continental\r\nintrigues more circumspectly than at the present moment, and to\r\ndistinguish the politics of the Electorate from the politics of the\r\nNation. The Revolution of France has entirely changed the ground with\r\nrespect to England and France, as nations; but the German despots, with\r\nPrussia at their head, are combining against liberty; and the\r\nfondness of Mr. Pitt for office, and the interest which all his family\r\nconnections have obtained, do not give sufficient security against this\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\nAs everything which passes in the world becomes matter for history, I\r\nwill now quit this subject, and take a concise review of the state of\r\nparties and politics in England, as Mr. Burke has done in France.\r\n\r\nWhether the present reign commenced with contempt, I leave to Mr. Burke:\r\ncertain, however, it is, that it had strongly that appearance. The\r\nanimosity of the English nation, it is very well remembered, ran high;\r\nand, had the true principles of Liberty been as well understood then\r\nas they now promise to be, it is probable the Nation would not have\r\npatiently submitted to so much. George the First and Second were\r\nsensible of a rival in the remains of the Stuarts; and as they could not\r\nbut consider themselves as standing on their good behaviour, they had\r\nprudence to keep their German principles of government to themselves;\r\nbut as the Stuart family wore away, the prudence became less necessary.\r\n\r\nThe contest between rights, and what were called prerogatives, continued\r\nto heat the nation till some time after the conclusion of the American\r\nWar, when all at once it fell a calm--Execration exchanged itself for\r\napplause, and Court popularity sprung up like a mushroom in a night.\r\n\r\nTo account for this sudden transition, it is proper to observe that\r\nthere are two distinct species of popularity; the one excited by merit,\r\nand the other by resentment. As the Nation had formed itself into\r\ntwo parties, and each was extolling the merits of its parliamentary\r\nchampions for and against prerogative, nothing could operate to give\r\na more general shock than an immediate coalition of the champions\r\nthemselves. The partisans of each being thus suddenly left in the lurch,\r\nand mutually heated with disgust at the measure, felt no other relief\r\nthan uniting in a common execration against both. A higher stimulus\r\nor resentment being thus excited than what the contest on prerogatives\r\noccasioned, the nation quitted all former objects of rights and wrongs,\r\nand sought only that of gratification. The indignation at the Coalition\r\nso effectually superseded the indignation against the Court as to\r\nextinguish it; and without any change of principles on the part of the\r\nCourt, the same people who had reprobated its despotism united with it\r\nto revenge themselves on the Coalition Parliament. The case was not,\r\nwhich they liked best, but which they hated most; and the least hated\r\npassed for love. The dissolution of the Coalition Parliament, as it\r\nafforded the means of gratifying the resentment of the Nation, could not\r\nfail to be popular; and from hence arose the popularity of the Court.\r\n\r\nTransitions of this kind exhibit a Nation under the government of\r\ntemper, instead of a fixed and steady principle; and having once\r\ncommitted itself, however rashly, it feels itself urged along to justify\r\nby continuance its first proceeding. Measures which at other times\r\nit would censure it now approves, and acts persuasion upon itself to\r\nsuffocate its judgment.\r\n\r\nOn the return of a new Parliament, the new Minister, Mr. Pitt, found\r\nhimself in a secure majority; and the Nation gave him credit, not out\r\nof regard to himself, but because it had resolved to do it out of\r\nresentment to another. He introduced himself to public notice by\r\na proposed Reform of Parliament, which in its operation would have\r\namounted to a public justification of corruption. The Nation was to be\r\nat the expense of buying up the rotten boroughs, whereas it ought to\r\npunish the persons who deal in the traffic.\r\n\r\nPassing over the two bubbles of the Dutch business and the million\r\na-year to sink the national debt, the matter which most presents itself,\r\nis the affair of the Regency. Never, in the course of my observation,\r\nwas delusion more successfully acted, nor a nation more completely\r\ndeceived. But, to make this appear, it will be necessary to go over the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox had stated in the House of Commons, that the Prince of Wales,\r\nas heir in succession, had a right in himself to assume the Government.\r\nThis was opposed by Mr. Pitt; and, so far as the opposition was\r\nconfined to the doctrine, it was just. But the principles which Mr. Pitt\r\nmaintained on the contrary side were as bad, or worse in their extent,\r\nthan those of Mr. Fox; because they went to establish an aristocracy\r\nover the nation, and over the small representation it has in the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nWhether the English form of Government be good or bad, is not in this\r\ncase the question; but, taking it as it stands, without regard to its\r\nmerits or demerits, Mr. Pitt was farther from the point than Mr. Fox.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to consist of three parts:--while therefore the Nation\r\nis disposed to continue this form, the parts have a national standing,\r\nindependent of each other, and are not the creatures of each other. Had\r\nMr. Fox passed through Parliament, and said that the person alluded to\r\nclaimed on the ground of the Nation, Mr. Pitt must then have contended\r\nwhat he called the right of the Parliament against the right of the\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nBy the appearance which the contest made, Mr. Fox took the hereditary\r\nground, and Mr. Pitt the Parliamentary ground; but the fact is, they\r\nboth took hereditary ground, and Mr. Pitt took the worst of the two.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the Parliament is made up of two Houses, one of which is\r\nmore hereditary, and more beyond the control of the Nation than what\r\nthe Crown (as it is called) is supposed to be. It is an hereditary\r\naristocracy, assuming and asserting indefeasible, irrevocable rights\r\nand authority, wholly independent of the Nation. Where, then, was\r\nthe merited popularity of exalting this hereditary power over another\r\nhereditary power less independent of the Nation than what itself assumed\r\nto be, and of absorbing the rights of the Nation into a House over which\r\nit has neither election nor control?\r\n\r\nThe general impulse of the Nation was right; but it acted without\r\nreflection. It approved the opposition made to the right set up by\r\nMr. Fox, without perceiving that Mr. Pitt was supporting another\r\nindefeasible right more remote from the Nation, in opposition to it.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the House of Commons, it is elected but by a small part\r\nof the Nation; but were the election as universal as taxation, which it\r\nought to be, it would still be only the organ of the Nation, and cannot\r\npossess inherent rights.--When the National Assembly of France resolves\r\na matter, the resolve is made in right of the Nation; but Mr. Pitt, on\r\nall national questions, so far as they refer to the House of Commons,\r\nabsorbs the rights of the Nation into the organ, and makes the organ\r\ninto a Nation, and the Nation itself into a cypher.\r\n\r\nIn a few words, the question on the Regency was a question of a million\r\na-year, which is appropriated to the executive department: and Mr. Pitt\r\ncould not possess himself of any management of this sum, without setting\r\nup the supremacy of Parliament; and when this was accomplished, it was\r\nindifferent who should be Regent, as he must be Regent at his own cost.\r\nAmong the curiosities which this contentious debate afforded, was that\r\nof making the Great Seal into a King, the affixing of which to an act\r\nwas to be royal authority. If, therefore, Royal Authority is a Great\r\nSeal, it consequently is in itself nothing; and a good Constitution\r\nwould be of infinitely more value to the Nation than what the three\r\nNominal Powers, as they now stand, are worth.\r\n\r\nThe continual use of the word Constitution in the English Parliament\r\nshows there is none; and that the whole is merely a form of government\r\nwithout a Constitution, and constituting itself with what powers it\r\npleases. If there were a Constitution, it certainly could be referred\r\nto; and the debate on any constitutional point would terminate by\r\nproducing the Constitution. One member says this is Constitution, and\r\nanother says that is Constitution--To-day it is one thing; and to-morrow\r\nsomething else--while the maintaining of the debate proves there is\r\nnone. Constitution is now the cant word of Parliament, tuning itself\r\nto the ear of the Nation. Formerly it was the universal supremacy of\r\nParliament--the omnipotence of Parliament: But since the progress of\r\nLiberty in France, those phrases have a despotic harshness in their\r\nnote; and the English Parliament have catched the fashion from\r\nthe National Assembly, but without the substance, of speaking of\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nAs the present generation of the people in England did not make the\r\nGovernment, they are not accountable for any of its defects; but,\r\nthat sooner or later, it must come into their hands to undergo a\r\nconstitutional reformation, is as certain as that the same thing has\r\nhappened in France. If France, with a revenue of nearly twenty-four\r\nmillions sterling, with an extent of rich and fertile country above four\r\ntimes larger than England, with a population of twenty-four millions\r\nof inhabitants to support taxation, with upwards of ninety millions\r\nsterling of gold and silver circulating in the nation, and with a debt\r\nless than the present debt of England--still found it necessary, from\r\nwhatever cause, to come to a settlement of its affairs, it solves the\r\nproblem of funding for both countries.\r\n\r\nIt is out of the question to say how long what is called the English\r\nconstitution has lasted, and to argue from thence how long it is to\r\nlast; the question is, how long can the funding system last? It is a\r\nthing but of modern invention, and has not yet continued beyond the\r\nlife of a man; yet in that short space it has so far accumulated, that,\r\ntogether with the current expenses, it requires an amount of taxes at\r\nleast equal to the whole landed rental of the nation in acres to defray\r\nthe annual expenditure. That a government could not have always gone on\r\nby the same system which has been followed for the last seventy years,\r\nmust be evident to every man; and for the same reason it cannot always\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nThe funding system is not money; neither is it, properly speaking,\r\ncredit. It, in effect, creates upon paper the sum which it appears to\r\nborrow, and lays on a tax to keep the imaginary capital alive by the\r\npayment of interest and sends the annuity to market, to be sold for\r\npaper already in circulation. If any credit is given, it is to the\r\ndisposition of the people to pay the tax, and not to the government,\r\nwhich lays it on. When this disposition expires, what is supposed to be\r\nthe credit of Government expires with it. The instance of France under\r\nthe former Government shows that it is impossible to compel the payment\r\nof taxes by force, when a whole nation is determined to take its stand\r\nupon that ground.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, in his review of the finances of France, states the quantity\r\nof gold and silver in France, at about eighty-eight millions sterling.\r\nIn doing this, he has, I presume, divided by the difference of exchange,\r\ninstead of the standard of twenty-four livres to a pound sterling; for\r\nM. Neckar's statement, from which Mr. Burke's is taken, is two thousand\r\ntwo hundred millions of livres, which is upwards of ninety-one millions\r\nand a half sterling.\r\n\r\nM. Neckar in France, and Mr. George Chalmers at the Office of Trade and\r\nPlantation in England, of which Lord Hawkesbury is president, published\r\nnearly about the same time (1786) an account of the quantity of money in\r\neach nation, from the returns of the Mint of each nation. Mr. Chalmers,\r\nfrom the returns of the English Mint at the Tower of London, states\r\nthe quantity of money in England, including Scotland and Ireland, to be\r\ntwenty millions sterling.*[12]\r\n\r\nM. Neckar*[13] says that the amount of money in France, recoined from\r\nthe old coin which was called in, was two thousand five hundred millions\r\nof livres (upwards of one hundred and four millions sterling); and,\r\nafter deducting for waste, and what may be in the West Indies and other\r\npossible circumstances, states the circulation quantity at home to be\r\nninety-one millions and a half sterling; but, taking it as Mr. Burke has\r\nput it, it is sixty-eight millions more than the national quantity in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThat the quantity of money in France cannot be under this sum, may at\r\nonce be seen from the state of the French Revenue, without referring to\r\nthe records of the French Mint for proofs. The revenue of France, prior\r\nto the Revolution, was nearly twenty-four millions sterling; and as\r\npaper had then no existence in France the whole revenue was collected\r\nupon gold and silver; and it would have been impossible to have\r\ncollected such a quantity of revenue upon a less national quantity than\r\nM. Neckar has stated. Before the establishment of paper in England,\r\nthe revenue was about a fourth part of the national amount of gold\r\nand silver, as may be known by referring to the revenue prior to King\r\nWilliam, and the quantity of money stated to be in the nation at that\r\ntime, which was nearly as much as it is now.\r\n\r\nIt can be of no real service to a nation, to impose upon itself, or to\r\npermit itself to be imposed upon; but the prejudices of some, and\r\nthe imposition of others, have always represented France as a nation\r\npossessing but little money--whereas the quantity is not only more than\r\nfour times what the quantity is in England, but is considerably greater\r\non a proportion of numbers. To account for this deficiency on the\r\npart of England, some reference should be had to the English system of\r\nfunding. It operates to multiply paper, and to substitute it in the room\r\nof money, in various shapes; and the more paper is multiplied, the\r\nmore opportunities are offered to export the specie; and it admits of\r\na possibility (by extending it to small notes) of increasing paper till\r\nthere is no money left.\r\n\r\nI know this is not a pleasant subject to English readers; but the\r\nmatters I am going to mention, are so important in themselves, as to\r\nrequire the attention of men interested in money transactions of a\r\npublic nature. There is a circumstance stated by M. Neckar, in his\r\ntreatise on the administration of the finances, which has never been\r\nattended to in England, but which forms the only basis whereon to\r\nestimate the quantity of money (gold and silver) which ought to be in\r\nevery nation in Europe, to preserve a relative proportion with other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nLisbon and Cadiz are the two ports into which (money) gold and silver\r\nfrom South America are imported, and which afterwards divide and spread\r\nthemselves over Europe by means of commerce, and increase the quantity\r\nof money in all parts of Europe. If, therefore, the amount of the annual\r\nimportation into Europe can be known, and the relative proportion of the\r\nforeign commerce of the several nations by which it can be distributed\r\ncan be ascertained, they give a rule sufficiently true, to ascertain the\r\nquantity of money which ought to be found in any nation, at any given\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nM. Neckar shows from the registers of Lisbon and Cadiz, that the\r\nimportation of gold and silver into Europe, is five millions sterling\r\nannually. He has not taken it on a single year, but on an average of\r\nfifteen succeeding years, from 1763 to 1777, both inclusive; in which\r\ntime, the amount was one thousand eight hundred million livres, which is\r\nseventy-five millions sterling.*[14]\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the Hanover succession in 1714 to the time Mr.\r\nChalmers published, is seventy-two years; and the quantity imported\r\ninto Europe, in that time, would be three hundred and sixty millions\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nIf the foreign commerce of Great Britain be stated at a sixth part of\r\nwhat the whole foreign commerce of Europe amounts to (which is probably\r\nan inferior estimation to what the gentlemen at the Exchange would\r\nallow) the proportion which Britain should draw by commerce of this sum,\r\nto keep herself on a proportion with the rest of Europe, would be also\r\na sixth part which is sixty millions sterling; and if the same allowance\r\nfor waste and accident be made for England which M. Neckar makes for\r\nFrance, the quantity remaining after these deductions would be fifty-two\r\nmillions; and this sum ought to have been in the nation (at the time Mr.\r\nChalmers published), in addition to the sum which was in the nation\r\nat the commencement of the Hanover succession, and to have made in the\r\nwhole at least sixty-six millions sterling; instead of which there were\r\nbut twenty millions, which is forty-six millions below its proportionate\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nAs the quantity of gold and silver imported into Lisbon and Cadiz\r\nis more exactly ascertained than that of any commodity imported into\r\nEngland, and as the quantity of money coined at the Tower of London\r\nis still more positively known, the leading facts do not admit of\r\ncontroversy. Either, therefore, the commerce of England is unproductive\r\nof profit, or the gold and silver which it brings in leak continually\r\naway by unseen means at the average rate of about three-quarters of a\r\nmillion a year, which, in the course of seventy-two years, accounts for\r\nthe deficiency; and its absence is supplied by paper.*[15]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of France is attended with many novel circumstances, not\r\nonly in the political sphere, but in the circle of money transactions.\r\nAmong others, it shows that a government may be in a state of insolvency\r\nand a nation rich. So far as the fact is confined to the late Government\r\nof France, it was insolvent; because the nation would no longer support\r\nits extravagance, and therefore it could no longer support itself--but\r\nwith respect to the nation all the means existed. A government may be\r\nsaid to be insolvent every time it applies to the nation to discharge\r\nits arrears. The insolvency of the late Government of France and the\r\npresent of England differed in no other respect than as the dispositions\r\nof the people differ. The people of France refused their aid to the\r\nold Government; and the people of England submit to taxation without\r\ninquiry. What is called the Crown in England has been insolvent several\r\ntimes; the last of which, publicly known, was in May, 1777, when it\r\napplied to the nation to discharge upwards of L600,000 private debts,\r\nwhich otherwise it could not pay.\r\n\r\nIt was the error of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Burke, and all those who were\r\nunacquainted with the affairs of France to confound the French nation\r\nwith the French Government. The French nation, in effect, endeavoured\r\nto render the late Government insolvent for the purpose of taking\r\ngovernment into its own hands: and it reserved its means for the support\r\nof the new Government. In a country of such vast extent and population\r\nas France the natural means cannot be wanting, and the political means\r\nappear the instant the nation is disposed to permit them. When Mr.\r\nBurke, in a speech last winter in the British Parliament, \"cast his eyes\r\nover the map of Europe, and saw a chasm that once was France,\" he talked\r\nlike a dreamer of dreams. The same natural France existed as before,\r\nand all the natural means existed with it. The only chasm was that the\r\nextinction of despotism had left, and which was to be filled up with\r\nthe Constitution more formidable in resources than the power which had\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nAlthough the French Nation rendered the late Government insolvent, it\r\ndid not permit the insolvency to act towards the creditors; and the\r\ncreditors, considering the Nation as the real pay-master, and the\r\nGovernment only as the agent, rested themselves on the nation, in\r\npreference to the Government. This appears greatly to disturb Mr.\r\nBurke, as the precedent is fatal to the policy by which governments have\r\nsupposed themselves secure. They have contracted debts, with a view\r\nof attaching what is called the monied interest of a Nation to their\r\nsupport; but the example in France shows that the permanent security of\r\nthe creditor is in the Nation, and not in the Government; and that in\r\nall possible revolutions that may happen in Governments, the means are\r\nalways with the Nation, and the Nation always in existence. Mr.\r\nBurke argues that the creditors ought to have abided the fate of the\r\nGovernment which they trusted; but the National Assembly considered\r\nthem as the creditors of the Nation, and not of the Government--of the\r\nmaster, and not of the steward.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the late government could not discharge the current\r\nexpenses, the present government has paid off a great part of the\r\ncapital. This has been accomplished by two means; the one by lessening\r\nthe expenses of government, and the other by the sale of the monastic\r\nand ecclesiastical landed estates. The devotees and penitent debauchees,\r\nextortioners and misers of former days, to ensure themselves a better\r\nworld than that they were about to leave, had bequeathed immense\r\nproperty in trust to the priesthood for pious uses; and the priesthood\r\nkept it for themselves. The National Assembly has ordered it to be sold\r\nfor the good of the whole nation, and the priesthood to be decently\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the revolution, the annual interest of the debt of\r\nFrance will be reduced at least six millions sterling, by paying off\r\nupwards of one hundred millions of the capital; which, with lessening\r\nthe former expenses of government at least three millions, will place\r\nFrance in a situation worthy the imitation of Europe.\r\n\r\nUpon a whole review of the subject, how vast is the contrast! While Mr.\r\nBurke has been talking of a general bankruptcy in France, the National\r\nAssembly has been paying off the capital of its debt; and while taxes\r\nhave increased near a million a year in England, they have lowered\r\nseveral millions a year in France. Not a word has either Mr. Burke\r\nor Mr. Pitt said about the French affairs, or the state of the French\r\nfinances, in the present Session of Parliament. The subject begins to be\r\ntoo well understood, and imposition serves no longer.\r\n\r\nThere is a general enigma running through the whole of Mr. Burke's\r\nbook. He writes in a rage against the National Assembly; but what is he\r\nenraged about? If his assertions were as true as they are groundless,\r\nand that France by her Revolution, had annihilated her power, and\r\nbecome what he calls a chasm, it might excite the grief of a Frenchman\r\n(considering himself as a national man), and provoke his rage against\r\nthe National Assembly; but why should it excite the rage of Mr. Burke?\r\nAlas! it is not the nation of France that Mr. Burke means, but the\r\nCourt; and every Court in Europe, dreading the same fate, is in\r\nmourning. He writes neither in the character of a Frenchman nor an\r\nEnglishman, but in the fawning character of that creature known in all\r\ncountries, and a friend to none--a courtier. Whether it be the Court of\r\nVersailles, or the Court of St. James, or Carlton-House, or the Court in\r\nexpectation, signifies not; for the caterpillar principle of all Courts\r\nand Courtiers are alike. They form a common policy throughout Europe,\r\ndetached and separate from the interest of Nations: and while they\r\nappear to quarrel, they agree to plunder. Nothing can be more terrible\r\nto a Court or Courtier than the Revolution of France. That which is\r\na blessing to Nations is bitterness to them: and as their existence\r\ndepends on the duplicity of a country, they tremble at the approach of\r\nprinciples, and dread the precedent that threatens their overthrow.\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nReason and Ignorance, the opposites of each other, influence the\r\ngreat bulk of mankind. If either of these can be rendered sufficiently\r\nextensive in a country, the machinery of Government goes easily on.\r\nReason obeys itself; and Ignorance submits to whatever is dictated to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe two modes of the Government which prevail in the world, are:\r\n\r\nFirst, Government by election and representation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Government by hereditary succession.\r\n\r\nThe former is generally known by the name of republic; the latter by\r\nthat of monarchy and aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThose two distinct and opposite forms erect themselves on the two\r\ndistinct and opposite bases of Reason and Ignorance.--As the exercise of\r\nGovernment requires talents and abilities, and as talents and abilities\r\ncannot have hereditary descent, it is evident that hereditary succession\r\nrequires a belief from man to which his reason cannot subscribe, and\r\nwhich can only be established upon his ignorance; and the more ignorant\r\nany country is, the better it is fitted for this species of Government.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Government, in a well-constituted republic, requires no\r\nbelief from man beyond what his reason can give. He sees the rationale\r\nof the whole system, its origin and its operation; and as it is best\r\nsupported when best understood, the human faculties act with boldness,\r\nand acquire, under this form of government, a gigantic manliness.\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, each of those forms acts on a different base, the one\r\nmoving freely by the aid of reason, the other by ignorance; we have next\r\nto consider, what it is that gives motion to that species of Government\r\nwhich is called mixed Government, or, as it is sometimes ludicrously\r\nstyled, a Government of this, that and t' other.\r\n\r\nThe moving power in this species of Government is, of necessity,\r\nCorruption. However imperfect election and representation may be in\r\nmixed Governments, they still give exercise to a greater portion of\r\nreason than is convenient to the hereditary Part; and therefore it\r\nbecomes necessary to buy the reason up. A mixed Government is an\r\nimperfect everything, cementing and soldering the discordant parts\r\ntogether by corruption, to act as a whole. Mr. Burke appears highly\r\ndisgusted that France, since she had resolved on a revolution, did not\r\nadopt what he calls \"A British Constitution\"; and the regretful manner\r\nin which he expresses himself on this occasion implies a suspicion\r\nthat the British Constitution needed something to keep its defects in\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nIn mixed Governments there is no responsibility: the parts cover each\r\nother till responsibility is lost; and the corruption which moves the\r\nmachine, contrives at the same time its own escape. When it is laid down\r\nas a maxim, that a King can do no wrong, it places him in a state\r\nof similar security with that of idiots and persons insane, and\r\nresponsibility is out of the question with respect to himself. It then\r\ndescends upon the Minister, who shelters himself under a majority in\r\nParliament, which, by places, pensions, and corruption, he can always\r\ncommand; and that majority justifies itself by the same authority with\r\nwhich it protects the Minister. In this rotatory motion, responsibility\r\nis thrown off from the parts, and from the whole.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a Part in a Government which can do no wrong, it implies\r\nthat it does nothing; and is only the machine of another power, by whose\r\nadvice and direction it acts. What is supposed to be the King in the\r\nmixed Governments, is the Cabinet; and as the Cabinet is always a part\r\nof the Parliament, and the members justifying in one character what\r\nthey advise and act in another, a mixed Government becomes a continual\r\nenigma; entailing upon a country by the quantity of corruption necessary\r\nto solder the parts, the expense of supporting all the forms of\r\ngovernment at once, and finally resolving itself into a Government\r\nby Committee; in which the advisers, the actors, the approvers, the\r\njustifiers, the persons responsible, and the persons not responsible,\r\nare the same persons.\r\n\r\nBy this pantomimical contrivance, and change of scene and character, the\r\nparts help each other out in matters which neither of them singly\r\nwould assume to act. When money is to be obtained, the mass of variety\r\napparently dissolves, and a profusion of parliamentary praises passes\r\nbetween the parts. Each admires with astonishment, the wisdom, the\r\nliberality, the disinterestedness of the other: and all of them breathe\r\na pitying sigh at the burthens of the Nation.\r\n\r\nBut in a well-constituted republic, nothing of this soldering, praising,\r\nand pitying, can take place; the representation being equal throughout\r\nthe country, and complete in itself, however it may be arranged into\r\nlegislative and executive, they have all one and the same natural\r\nsource. The parts are not foreigners to each other, like democracy,\r\naristocracy, and monarchy. As there are no discordant distinctions,\r\nthere is nothing to corrupt by compromise, nor confound by contrivance.\r\nPublic measures appeal of themselves to the understanding of the Nation,\r\nand, resting on their own merits, disown any flattering applications to\r\nvanity. The continual whine of lamenting the burden of taxes, however\r\nsuccessfully it may be practised in mixed Governments, is inconsistent\r\nwith the sense and spirit of a republic. If taxes are necessary, they\r\nare of course advantageous; but if they require an apology, the apology\r\nitself implies an impeachment. Why, then, is man thus imposed upon, or\r\nwhy does he impose upon himself?\r\n\r\nWhen men are spoken of as kings and subjects, or when Government\r\nis mentioned under the distinct and combined heads of monarchy,\r\naristocracy, and democracy, what is it that reasoning man is to\r\nunderstand by the terms? If there really existed in the world two or\r\nmore distinct and separate elements of human power, we should then see\r\nthe several origins to which those terms would descriptively apply;\r\nbut as there is but one species of man, there can be but one element of\r\nhuman power; and that element is man himself. Monarchy, aristocracy, and\r\ndemocracy, are but creatures of imagination; and a thousand such may be\r\ncontrived as well as three.\r\n\r\nFrom the Revolutions of America and France, and the symptoms that have\r\nappeared in other countries, it is evident that the opinion of the world\r\nis changing with respect to systems of Government, and that revolutions\r\nare not within the compass of political calculations. The progress of\r\ntime and circumstances, which men assign to the accomplishment of great\r\nchanges, is too mechanical to measure the force of the mind, and the\r\nrapidity of reflection, by which revolutions are generated: All the old\r\ngovernments have received a shock from those that already appear, and\r\nwhich were once more improbable, and are a greater subject of wonder,\r\nthan a general revolution in Europe would be now.\r\n\r\nWhen we survey the wretched condition of man, under the monarchical and\r\nhereditary systems of Government, dragged from his home by one power,\r\nor driven by another, and impoverished by taxes more than by enemies,\r\nit becomes evident that those systems are bad, and that a general\r\nrevolution in the principle and construction of Governments is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhat is government more than the management of the affairs of a Nation?\r\nIt is not, and from its nature cannot be, the property of any particular\r\nman or family, but of the whole community, at whose expense it is\r\nsupported; and though by force and contrivance it has been usurped\r\ninto an inheritance, the usurpation cannot alter the right of things.\r\nSovereignty, as a matter of right, appertains to the Nation only,\r\nand not to any individual; and a Nation has at all times an inherent\r\nindefeasible right to abolish any form of Government it finds\r\ninconvenient, and to establish such as accords with its interest,\r\ndisposition and happiness. The romantic and barbarous distinction of men\r\ninto Kings and subjects, though it may suit the condition of courtiers,\r\ncannot that of citizens; and is exploded by the principle upon\r\nwhich Governments are now founded. Every citizen is a member of the\r\nSovereignty, and, as such, can acknowledge no personal subjection; and\r\nhis obedience can be only to the laws.\r\n\r\nWhen men think of what Government is, they must necessarily suppose it\r\nto possess a knowledge of all the objects and matters upon which its\r\nauthority is to be exercised. In this view of Government, the republican\r\nsystem, as established by America and France, operates to embrace the\r\nwhole of a Nation; and the knowledge necessary to the interest of\r\nall the parts, is to be found in the center, which the parts by\r\nrepresentation form: But the old Governments are on a construction that\r\nexcludes knowledge as well as happiness; government by Monks, who knew\r\nnothing of the world beyond the walls of a Convent, is as consistent as\r\ngovernment by Kings.\r\n\r\nWhat were formerly called Revolutions, were little more than a change\r\nof persons, or an alteration of local circumstances. They rose and fell\r\nlike things of course, and had nothing in their existence or their fate\r\nthat could influence beyond the spot that produced them. But what we\r\nnow see in the world, from the Revolutions of America and France, are\r\na renovation of the natural order of things, a system of principles as\r\nuniversal as truth and the existence of man, and combining moral with\r\npolitical happiness and national prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"I. Men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of\r\ntheir rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on\r\npublic utility.\r\n\r\n\"II. The end of all political associations is the preservation of the\r\nnatural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights are liberty,\r\nproperty, security, and resistance of oppression.\r\n\r\n\"III. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can\r\nany Individual, or Any Body Of Men, be entitled to any authority which\r\nis not expressly derived from it.\"\r\n\r\nIn these principles, there is nothing to throw a Nation into confusion\r\nby inflaming ambition. They are calculated to call forth wisdom and\r\nabilities, and to exercise them for the public good, and not for\r\nthe emolument or aggrandisement of particular descriptions of men or\r\nfamilies. Monarchical sovereignty, the enemy of mankind, and the source\r\nof misery, is abolished; and the sovereignty itself is restored to its\r\nnatural and original place, the Nation. Were this the case throughout\r\nEurope, the cause of wars would be taken away.\r\n\r\nIt is attributed to Henry the Fourth of France, a man of enlarged and\r\nbenevolent heart, that he proposed, about the year 1610, a plan for\r\nabolishing war in Europe. The plan consisted in constituting an European\r\nCongress, or as the French authors style it, a Pacific Republic; by\r\nappointing delegates from the several Nations who were to act as a\r\nCourt of arbitration in any disputes that might arise between nation and\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nHad such a plan been adopted at the time it was proposed, the taxes of\r\nEngland and France, as two of the parties, would have been at least ten\r\nmillions sterling annually to each Nation less than they were at the\r\ncommencement of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nTo conceive a cause why such a plan has not been adopted (and that\r\ninstead of a Congress for the purpose of preventing war, it has been\r\ncalled only to terminate a war, after a fruitless expense of several\r\nyears) it will be necessary to consider the interest of Governments as a\r\ndistinct interest to that of Nations.\r\n\r\nWhatever is the cause of taxes to a Nation, becomes also the means of\r\nrevenue to Government. Every war terminates with an addition of taxes,\r\nand consequently with an addition of revenue; and in any event of\r\nwar, in the manner they are now commenced and concluded, the power\r\nand interest of Governments are increased. War, therefore, from its\r\nproductiveness, as it easily furnishes the pretence of necessity for\r\ntaxes and appointments to places and offices, becomes a principal part\r\nof the system of old Governments; and to establish any mode to abolish\r\nwar, however advantageous it might be to Nations, would be to take\r\nfrom such Government the most lucrative of its branches. The frivolous\r\nmatters upon which war is made, show the disposition and avidity of\r\nGovernments to uphold the system of war, and betray the motives upon\r\nwhich they act.\r\n\r\nWhy are not Republics plunged into war, but because the nature of their\r\nGovernment does not admit of an interest distinct from that of the\r\nNation? Even Holland, though an ill-constructed Republic, and with a\r\ncommerce extending over the world, existed nearly a century without\r\nwar: and the instant the form of Government was changed in France, the\r\nrepublican principles of peace and domestic prosperity and economy arose\r\nwith the new Government; and the same consequences would follow the\r\ncause in other Nations.\r\n\r\nAs war is the system of Government on the old construction, the\r\nanimosity which Nations reciprocally entertain, is nothing more than\r\nwhat the policy of their Governments excites to keep up the spirit of\r\nthe system. Each Government accuses the other of perfidy, intrigue,\r\nand ambition, as a means of heating the imagination of their respective\r\nNations, and incensing them to hostilities. Man is not the enemy of\r\nman, but through the medium of a false system of Government. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of exclaiming against the ambition of Kings, the exclamation\r\nshould be directed against the principle of such Governments; and\r\ninstead of seeking to reform the individual, the wisdom of a Nation\r\nshould apply itself to reform the system.\r\n\r\nWhether the forms and maxims of Governments which are still in practice,\r\nwere adapted to the condition of the world at the period they were\r\nestablished, is not in this case the question. The older they are, the\r\nless correspondence can they have with the present state of things.\r\nTime, and change of circumstances and opinions, have the same\r\nprogressive effect in rendering modes of Government obsolete as they\r\nhave upon customs and manners.--Agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and\r\nthe tranquil arts, by which the prosperity of Nations is best promoted,\r\nrequire a different system of Government, and a different species of\r\nknowledge to direct its operations, than what might have been required\r\nin the former condition of the world.\r\n\r\nAs it is not difficult to perceive, from the enlightened state of\r\nmankind, that hereditary Governments are verging to their decline,\r\nand that Revolutions on the broad basis of national sovereignty and\r\nGovernment by representation, are making their way in Europe, it\r\nwould be an act of wisdom to anticipate their approach, and produce\r\nRevolutions by reason and accommodation, rather than commit them to the\r\nissue of convulsions.\r\n\r\nFrom what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to\r\nbe held improbable. It is an age of Revolutions, in which everything\r\nmay be looked for. The intrigue of Courts, by which the system of war\r\nis kept up, may provoke a confederation of Nations to abolish it: and\r\nan European Congress to patronise the progress of free Government, and\r\npromote the civilisation of Nations with each other, is an event nearer\r\nin probability, than once were the revolutions and alliance of France\r\nand America.\r\n\r\n                            END OF PART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF MAN. PART SECOND, COMBINING PRINCIPLE AND PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n(1792)\r\n\r\nTHE work of which we offer a translation to the public has created the\r\ngreatest sensation in England. Paine, that man of freedom, who seems\r\nborn to preach \"Common Sense\" to the whole world with the same success\r\nas in America, explains in it to the people of England the theory of the\r\npractice of the Rights of Man.\r\n\r\nOwing to the prejudices that still govern that nation, the author has\r\nbeen obliged to condescend to answer Mr. Burke. He has done so more\r\nespecially in an extended preface which is nothing but a piece of\r\nvery tedious controversy, in which he shows himself very sensitive to\r\ncriticisms that do not really affect him. To translate it seemed an\r\ninsult to the free French people, and similar reasons have led the\r\neditors to suppress also a dedicatory epistle addressed by Paine to\r\nLafayette.\r\n\r\nThe French can no longer endure dedicatory epistles. A man should write\r\nprivately to those he esteems: when he publishes a book his thoughts\r\nshould be offered to the public alone. Paine, that uncorrupted friend\r\nof freedom, believed too in the sincerity of Lafayette. So easy is it\r\nto deceive men of single-minded purpose! Bred at a distance from courts,\r\nthat austere American does not seem any more on his guard against the\r\nartful ways and speech of courtiers than some Frenchmen who resemble\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  TO\r\n\r\n                          M. DE LA FAYETTE\r\n\r\nAfter an acquaintance of nearly fifteen years in difficult situations\r\nin America, and various consultations in Europe, I feel a pleasure in\r\npresenting to you this small treatise, in gratitude for your services\r\nto my beloved America, and as a testimony of my esteem for the virtues,\r\npublic and private, which I know you to possess.\r\n\r\nThe only point upon which I could ever discover that we differed was not\r\nas to principles of government, but as to time. For my own part I think\r\nit equally as injurious to good principles to permit them to linger,\r\nas to push them on too fast. That which you suppose accomplishable in\r\nfourteen or fifteen years, I may believe practicable in a much shorter\r\nperiod. Mankind, as it appears to me, are always ripe enough to\r\nunderstand their true interest, provided it be presented clearly to\r\ntheir understanding, and that in a manner not to create suspicion by\r\nanything like self-design, nor offend by assuming too much. Where we\r\nwould wish to reform we must not reproach.\r\n\r\nWhen the American revolution was established I felt a disposition to\r\nsit serenely down and enjoy the calm. It did not appear to me that any\r\nobject could afterwards arise great enough to make me quit tranquility\r\nand feel as I had felt before. But when principle, and not place, is the\r\nenergetic cause of action, a man, I find, is everywhere the same.\r\n\r\nI am now once more in the public world; and as I have not a right to\r\ncontemplate on so many years of remaining life as you have, I have\r\nresolved to labour as fast as I can; and as I am anxious for your aid\r\nand your company, I wish you to hasten your principles and overtake me.\r\n\r\nIf you make a campaign the ensuing spring, which it is most probable\r\nthere will be no occasion for, I will come and join you. Should the\r\ncampaign commence, I hope it will terminate in the extinction of German\r\ndespotism, and in establishing the freedom of all Germany. When France\r\nshall be surrounded with revolutions she will be in peace and safety,\r\nand her taxes, as well as those of Germany, will consequently become\r\nless.\r\n\r\nYour sincere,\r\n\r\n   Affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\n      Thomas Paine\r\n\r\nLondon, Feb. 9, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nWhen I began the chapter entitled the \"Conclusion\" in the former part\r\nof the RIGHTS OF MAN, published last year, it was my intention to have\r\nextended it to a greater length; but in casting the whole matter in my\r\nmind, which I wish to add, I found that it must either make the work too\r\nbulky, or contract my plan too much. I therefore brought it to a close\r\nas soon as the subject would admit, and reserved what I had further to\r\nsay to another opportunity.\r\n\r\nSeveral other reasons contributed to produce this determination.\r\nI wished to know the manner in which a work, written in a style of\r\nthinking and expression different to what had been customary in England,\r\nwould be received before I proceeded farther. A great field was opening\r\nto the view of mankind by means of the French Revolution. Mr. Burke's\r\noutrageous opposition thereto brought the controversy into England. He\r\nattacked principles which he knew (from information) I would contest\r\nwith him, because they are principles I believe to be good, and which I\r\nhave contributed to establish, and conceive myself bound to defend. Had\r\nhe not urged the controversy, I had most probably been a silent man.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for deferring the remainder of the work was, that Mr.\r\nBurke promised in his first publication to renew the subject at another\r\nopportunity, and to make a comparison of what he called the English and\r\nFrench Constitutions. I therefore held myself in reserve for him. He has\r\npublished two works since, without doing this: which he certainly would\r\nnot have omitted, had the comparison been in his favour.\r\n\r\nIn his last work, his \"Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs,\" he has\r\nquoted about ten pages from the RIGHTS OF MAN, and having given himself\r\nthe trouble of doing this, says he \"shall not attempt in the smallest\r\ndegree to refute them,\" meaning the principles therein contained. I am\r\nenough acquainted with Mr. Burke to know that he would if he could. But\r\ninstead of contesting them, he immediately after consoles himself with\r\nsaying that \"he has done his part.\"--He has not done his part. He has\r\nnot performed his promise of a comparison of constitutions. He started\r\nthe controversy, he gave the challenge, and has fled from it; and he is\r\nnow a case in point with his own opinion that \"the age of chivalry is\r\ngone!\"\r\n\r\nThe title, as well as the substance of his last work, his \"Appeal,\" is\r\nhis condemnation. Principles must stand on their own merits, and if they\r\nare good they certainly will. To put them under the shelter of other\r\nmen's authority, as Mr. Burke has done, serves to bring them into\r\nsuspicion. Mr. Burke is not very fond of dividing his honours, but in\r\nthis case he is artfully dividing the disgrace.\r\n\r\nBut who are those to whom Mr. Burke has made his appeal? A set of\r\nchildish thinkers, and half-way politicians born in the last century,\r\nmen who went no farther with any principle than as it suited their\r\npurposes as a party; the nation was always left out of the question; and\r\nthis has been the character of every party from that day to this.\r\nThe nation sees nothing of such works, or such politics, worthy its\r\nattention. A little matter will move a party, but it must be something\r\ngreat that moves a nation.\r\n\r\nThough I see nothing in Mr. Burke's \"Appeal\" worth taking much notice\r\nof, there is, however, one expression upon which I shall offer a few\r\nremarks. After quoting largely from the RIGHTS OF MAN, and declining to\r\ncontest the principles contained in that work, he says: \"This will most\r\nprobably be done (if such writings shall be thought to deserve any other\r\nrefutation than that of criminal justice) by others, who may think with\r\nMr. Burke and with the same zeal.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it has not yet been done by anybody. Not less, I\r\nbelieve, than eight or ten pamphlets intended as answers to the former\r\npart of the RIGHTS OF MAN have been published by different persons, and\r\nnot one of them to my knowledge, has extended to a second edition, nor\r\nare even the titles of them so much as generally remembered. As I am\r\naverse to unnecessary multiplying publications, I have answered none of\r\nthem. And as I believe that a man may write himself out of reputation\r\nwhen nobody else can do it, I am careful to avoid that rock.\r\n\r\nBut as I would decline unnecessary publications on the one hand, so\r\nwould I avoid everything that might appear like sullen pride on the\r\nother. If Mr. Burke, or any person on his side the question, will\r\nproduce an answer to the RIGHTS OF MAN that shall extend to a half, or\r\neven to a fourth part of the number of copies to which the Rights Of Man\r\nextended, I will reply to his work. But until this be done, I shall so\r\nfar take the sense of the public for my guide (and the world knows I am\r\nnot a flatterer) that what they do not think worth while to read, is not\r\nworth mine to answer. I suppose the number of copies to which the\r\nfirst part of the RIGHTS OF MAN extended, taking England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland, is not less than between forty and fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nI now come to remark on the remaining part of the quotation I have made\r\nfrom Mr. Burke.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" says he, \"such writings shall be thought to deserve any other\r\nrefutation than that of criminal justice.\"\r\n\r\nPardoning the pun, it must be criminal justice indeed that should\r\ncondemn a work as a substitute for not being able to refute it.\r\nThe greatest condemnation that could be passed upon it would be a\r\nrefutation. But in proceeding by the method Mr. Burke alludes to, the\r\ncondemnation would, in the final event, pass upon the criminality of\r\nthe process and not upon the work, and in this case, I had rather be the\r\nauthor, than be either the judge or the jury that should condemn it.\r\n\r\nBut to come at once to the point. I have differed from some professional\r\ngentlemen on the subject of prosecutions, and I since find they are\r\nfalling into my opinion, which I will here state as fully, but as\r\nconcisely as I can.\r\n\r\nI will first put a case with respect to any law, and then compare it\r\nwith a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIt would be an act of despotism, or what in England is called arbitrary\r\npower, to make a law to prohibit investigating the principles, good or\r\nbad, on which such a law, or any other is founded.\r\n\r\nIf a law be bad it is one thing to oppose the practice of it, but it is\r\nquite a different thing to expose its errors, to reason on its defects,\r\nand to show cause why it should be repealed, or why another ought to be\r\nsubstituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it\r\nalso my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making use at the\r\nsame time of every argument to show its errors and procure its repeal,\r\nthan forcibly to violate it; because the precedent of breaking a bad law\r\nmight weaken the force, and lead to a discretionary violation, of those\r\nwhich are good.\r\n\r\nThe case is the same with respect to principles and forms of government,\r\nor to what are called constitutions and the parts of which they are,\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nIt is for the good of nations and not for the emolument or\r\naggrandisement of particular individuals, that government ought to be\r\nestablished, and that mankind are at the expense of supporting it. The\r\ndefects of every government and constitution both as to principle and\r\nform, must, on a parity of reasoning, be as open to discussion as the\r\ndefects of a law, and it is a duty which every man owes to society to\r\npoint them out. When those defects, and the means of remedying them, are\r\ngenerally seen by a nation, that nation will reform its government or\r\nits constitution in the one case, as the government repealed or reformed\r\nthe law in the other. The operation of government is restricted to the\r\nmaking and the administering of laws; but it is to a nation that the\r\nright of forming or reforming, generating or regenerating constitutions\r\nand governments belong; and consequently those subjects, as subjects\r\nof investigation, are always before a country as a matter of right, and\r\ncannot, without invading the general rights of that country, be made\r\nsubjects for prosecution. On this ground I will meet Mr. Burke whenever\r\nhe please. It is better that the whole argument should come out than to\r\nseek to stifle it. It was himself that opened the controversy, and he\r\nought not to desert it.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that monarchy and aristocracy will continue seven years\r\nlonger in any of the enlightened countries in Europe. If better reasons\r\ncan be shown for them than against them, they will stand; if the\r\ncontrary, they will not. Mankind are not now to be told they shall not\r\nthink, or they shall not read; and publications that go no farther than\r\nto investigate principles of government, to invite men to reason and to\r\nreflect, and to show the errors and excellences of different systems,\r\nhave a right to appear. If they do not excite attention, they are not\r\nworth the trouble of a prosecution; and if they do, the prosecution will\r\namount to nothing, since it cannot amount to a prohibition of reading.\r\nThis would be a sentence on the public, instead of the author, and would\r\nalso be the most effectual mode of making or hastening revolution.\r\n\r\nOn all cases that apply universally to a nation, with respect to systems\r\nof government, a jury of twelve men is not competent to decide. Where\r\nthere are no witnesses to be examined, no facts to be proved, and where\r\nthe whole matter is before the whole public, and the merits or demerits\r\nof it resting on their opinion; and where there is nothing to be known\r\nin a court, but what every body knows out of it, every twelve men is\r\nequally as good a jury as the other, and would most probably reverse\r\neach other's verdict; or, from the variety of their opinions, not be\r\nable to form one. It is one case, whether a nation approve a work, or a\r\nplan; but it is quite another case, whether it will commit to any such\r\njury the power of determining whether that nation have a right to, or\r\nshall reform its government or not. I mention those cases that Mr. Burke\r\nmay see I have not written on Government without reflecting on what is\r\nLaw, as well as on what are Rights.--The only effectual jury in such\r\ncases would be a convention of the whole nation fairly elected; for\r\nin all such cases the whole nation is the vicinage. If Mr. Burke will\r\npropose such a jury, I will waive all privileges of being the citizen\r\nof another country, and, defending its principles, abide the issue,\r\nprovided he will do the same; for my opinion is, that his work and his\r\nprinciples would be condemned instead of mine.\r\n\r\nAs to the prejudices which men have from education and habit, in favour\r\nof any particular form or system of government, those prejudices have\r\nyet to stand the test of reason and reflection. In fact, such prejudices\r\nare nothing. No man is prejudiced in favour of a thing, knowing it to be\r\nwrong. He is attached to it on the belief of its being right; and\r\nwhen he sees it is not so, the prejudice will be gone. We have but a\r\ndefective idea of what prejudice is. It might be said, that until men\r\nthink for themselves the whole is prejudice, and not opinion; for that\r\nonly is opinion which is the result of reason and reflection. I offer\r\nthis remark, that Mr. Burke may not confide too much in what have been\r\nthe customary prejudices of the country.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the people of England have ever been fairly and\r\ncandidly dealt by. They have been imposed upon by parties, and by men\r\nassuming the character of leaders. It is time that the nation should\r\nrise above those trifles. It is time to dismiss that inattention which\r\nhas so long been the encouraging cause of stretching taxation to excess.\r\nIt is time to dismiss all those songs and toasts which are calculated to\r\nenslave, and operate to suffocate reflection. On all such subjects men\r\nhave but to think, and they will neither act wrong nor be misled. To\r\nsay that any people are not fit for freedom, is to make poverty their\r\nchoice, and to say they had rather be loaded with taxes than not. If\r\nsuch a case could be proved, it would equally prove that those who\r\ngovern are not fit to govern them, for they are a part of the same\r\nnational mass.\r\n\r\nBut admitting governments to be changed all over Europe; it certainly\r\nmay be done without convulsion or revenge. It is not worth making\r\nchanges or revolutions, unless it be for some great national benefit:\r\nand when this shall appear to a nation, the danger will be, as in\r\nAmerica and France, to those who oppose; and with this reflection I\r\nclose my Preface.\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS PAINE\r\n\r\nLondon, Feb. 9, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF MAN PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nWhat Archimedes said of the mechanical powers, may be applied to Reason\r\nand Liberty. \"Had we,\" said he, \"a place to stand upon, we might raise\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nThe revolution of America presented in politics what was only theory in\r\nmechanics. So deeply rooted were all the governments of the old\r\nworld, and so effectually had the tyranny and the antiquity of habit\r\nestablished itself over the mind, that no beginning could be made in\r\nAsia, Africa, or Europe, to reform the political condition of man.\r\nFreedom had been hunted round the globe; reason was considered as\r\nrebellion; and the slavery of fear had made men afraid to think.\r\n\r\nBut such is the irresistible nature of truth, that all it asks,--and all\r\nit wants,--is the liberty of appearing. The sun needs no inscription\r\nto distinguish him from darkness; and no sooner did the American\r\ngovernments display themselves to the world, than despotism felt a shock\r\nand man began to contemplate redress.\r\n\r\nThe independence of America, considered merely as a separation from\r\nEngland, would have been a matter but of little importance, had it\r\nnot been accompanied by a revolution in the principles and practice of\r\ngovernments. She made a stand, not for herself only, but for the\r\nworld, and looked beyond the advantages herself could receive. Even\r\nthe Hessian, though hired to fight against her, may live to bless his\r\ndefeat; and England, condemning the viciousness of its government,\r\nrejoice in its miscarriage.\r\n\r\nAs America was the only spot in the political world where the principle\r\nof universal reformation could begin, so also was it the best in the\r\nnatural world. An assemblage of circumstances conspired, not only to\r\ngive birth, but to add gigantic maturity to its principles. The scene\r\nwhich that country presents to the eye of a spectator, has something in\r\nit which generates and encourages great ideas. Nature appears to him in\r\nmagnitude. The mighty objects he beholds, act upon his mind by enlarging\r\nit, and he partakes of the greatness he contemplates.--Its first\r\nsettlers were emigrants from different European nations, and of\r\ndiversified professions of religion, retiring from the governmental\r\npersecutions of the old world, and meeting in the new, not as enemies,\r\nbut as brothers. The wants which necessarily accompany the cultivation\r\nof a wilderness produced among them a state of society, which countries\r\nlong harassed by the quarrels and intrigues of governments, had\r\nneglected to cherish. In such a situation man becomes what he ought. He\r\nsees his species, not with the inhuman idea of a natural enemy, but as\r\nkindred; and the example shows to the artificial world, that man must go\r\nback to Nature for information.\r\n\r\nFrom the rapid progress which America makes in every species of\r\nimprovement, it is rational to conclude that, if the governments of\r\nAsia, Africa, and Europe had begun on a principle similar to that of\r\nAmerica, or had not been very early corrupted therefrom, those countries\r\nmust by this time have been in a far superior condition to what they\r\nare. Age after age has passed away, for no other purpose than to behold\r\ntheir wretchedness. Could we suppose a spectator who knew nothing of the\r\nworld, and who was put into it merely to make his observations, he would\r\ntake a great part of the old world to be new, just struggling with the\r\ndifficulties and hardships of an infant settlement. He could not suppose\r\nthat the hordes of miserable poor with which old countries abound\r\ncould be any other than those who had not yet had time to provide for\r\nthemselves. Little would he think they were the consequence of what in\r\nsuch countries they call government.\r\n\r\nIf, from the more wretched parts of the old world, we look at those\r\nwhich are in an advanced stage of improvement we still find the greedy\r\nhand of government thrusting itself into every corner and crevice\r\nof industry, and grasping the spoil of the multitude. Invention is\r\ncontinually exercised to furnish new pretences for revenue and taxation.\r\nIt watches prosperity as its prey, and permits none to escape without a\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\nAs revolutions have begun (and as the probability is always greater\r\nagainst a thing beginning, than of proceeding after it has begun), it\r\nis natural to expect that other revolutions will follow. The amazing and\r\nstill increasing expenses with which old governments are conducted, the\r\nnumerous wars they engage in or provoke, the embarrassments they throw\r\nin the way of universal civilisation and commerce, and the oppression\r\nand usurpation acted at home, have wearied out the patience, and\r\nexhausted the property of the world. In such a situation, and with such\r\nexamples already existing, revolutions are to be looked for. They are\r\nbecome subjects of universal conversation, and may be considered as the\r\nOrder of the day.\r\n\r\nIf systems of government can be introduced less expensive and more\r\nproductive of general happiness than those which have existed, all\r\nattempts to oppose their progress will in the end be fruitless. Reason,\r\nlike time, will make its own way, and prejudice will fall in a combat\r\nwith interest. If universal peace, civilisation, and commerce are\r\never to be the happy lot of man, it cannot be accomplished but by a\r\nrevolution in the system of governments. All the monarchical governments\r\nare military. War is their trade, plunder and revenue their objects.\r\nWhile such governments continue, peace has not the absolute security\r\nof a day. What is the history of all monarchical governments but a\r\ndisgustful picture of human wretchedness, and the accidental respite of\r\na few years' repose? Wearied with war, and tired with human butchery,\r\nthey sat down to rest, and called it peace. This certainly is not the\r\ncondition that heaven intended for man; and if this be monarchy, well\r\nmight monarchy be reckoned among the sins of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions which formerly took place in the world had nothing in\r\nthem that interested the bulk of mankind. They extended only to a change\r\nof persons and measures, but not of principles, and rose or fell among\r\nthe common transactions of the moment. What we now behold may not\r\nimproperly be called a \"counter-revolution.\" Conquest and tyranny,\r\nat some earlier period, dispossessed man of his rights, and he is now\r\nrecovering them. And as the tide of all human affairs has its ebb\r\nand flow in directions contrary to each other, so also is it in this.\r\nGovernment founded on a moral theory, on a system of universal peace, on\r\nthe indefeasible hereditary Rights of Man, is now revolving from west\r\nto east by a stronger impulse than the government of the sword revolved\r\nfrom east to west. It interests not particular individuals, but nations\r\nin its progress, and promises a new era to the human race.\r\n\r\nThe danger to which the success of revolutions is most exposed is that\r\nof attempting them before the principles on which they proceed, and the\r\nadvantages to result from them, are sufficiently seen and understood.\r\nAlmost everything appertaining to the circumstances of a nation, has\r\nbeen absorbed and confounded under the general and mysterious word\r\ngovernment. Though it avoids taking to its account the errors it\r\ncommits, and the mischiefs it occasions, it fails not to arrogate to\r\nitself whatever has the appearance of prosperity. It robs industry of\r\nits honours, by pedantically making itself the cause of its effects; and\r\npurloins from the general character of man, the merits that appertain to\r\nhim as a social being.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be of use in this day of revolutions to discriminate\r\nbetween those things which are the effect of government, and those\r\nwhich are not. This will best be done by taking a review of society\r\nand civilisation, and the consequences resulting therefrom, as things\r\ndistinct from what are called governments. By beginning with this\r\ninvestigation, we shall be able to assign effects to their proper causes\r\nand analyse the mass of common errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. OF SOCIETY AND CIVILISATION\r\n\r\nGreat part of that order which reigns among mankind is not the effect\r\nof government. It has its origin in the principles of society and the\r\nnatural constitution of man. It existed prior to government, and\r\nwould exist if the formality of government was abolished. The mutual\r\ndependence and reciprocal interest which man has upon man, and all the\r\nparts of civilised community upon each other, create that great chain\r\nof connection which holds it together. The landholder, the farmer,\r\nthe manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, and every occupation,\r\nprospers by the aid which each receives from the other, and from the\r\nwhole. Common interest regulates their concerns, and forms their law;\r\nand the laws which common usage ordains, have a greater influence than\r\nthe laws of government. In fine, society performs for itself almost\r\neverything which is ascribed to government.\r\n\r\nTo understand the nature and quantity of government proper for man,\r\nit is necessary to attend to his character. As Nature created him for\r\nsocial life, she fitted him for the station she intended. In all cases\r\nshe made his natural wants greater than his individual powers. No one\r\nman is capable, without the aid of society, of supplying his own wants,\r\nand those wants, acting upon every individual, impel the whole of them\r\ninto society, as naturally as gravitation acts to a centre.\r\n\r\nBut she has gone further. She has not only forced man into society by\r\na diversity of wants which the reciprocal aid of each other can supply,\r\nbut she has implanted in him a system of social affections, which,\r\nthough not necessary to his existence, are essential to his happiness.\r\nThere is no period in life when this love for society ceases to act. It\r\nbegins and ends with our being.\r\n\r\nIf we examine with attention into the composition and constitution\r\nof man, the diversity of his wants, and the diversity of talents in\r\ndifferent men for reciprocally accommodating the wants of each other,\r\nhis propensity to society, and consequently to preserve the advantages\r\nresulting from it, we shall easily discover, that a great part of what\r\nis called government is mere imposition.\r\n\r\nGovernment is no farther necessary than to supply the few cases to which\r\nsociety and civilisation are not conveniently competent; and instances\r\nare not wanting to show, that everything which government can usefully\r\nadd thereto, has been performed by the common consent of society,\r\nwithout government.\r\n\r\nFor upwards of two years from the commencement of the American War,\r\nand to a longer period in several of the American States, there were no\r\nestablished forms of government. The old governments had been abolished,\r\nand the country was too much occupied in defence to employ its attention\r\nin establishing new governments; yet during this interval order and\r\nharmony were preserved as inviolate as in any country in Europe. There\r\nis a natural aptness in man, and more so in society, because it embraces\r\na greater variety of abilities and resource, to accommodate itself to\r\nwhatever situation it is in. The instant formal government is abolished,\r\nsociety begins to act: a general association takes place, and common\r\ninterest produces common security.\r\n\r\nSo far is it from being true, as has been pretended, that the abolition\r\nof any formal government is the dissolution of society, that it acts by\r\na contrary impulse, and brings the latter the closer together. All\r\nthat part of its organisation which it had committed to its government,\r\ndevolves again upon itself, and acts through its medium. When men, as\r\nwell from natural instinct as from reciprocal benefits, have habituated\r\nthemselves to social and civilised life, there is always enough of its\r\nprinciples in practice to carry them through any changes they may find\r\nnecessary or convenient to make in their government. In short, man is so\r\nnaturally a creature of society that it is almost impossible to put him\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nFormal government makes but a small part of civilised life; and when\r\neven the best that human wisdom can devise is established, it is a thing\r\nmore in name and idea than in fact. It is to the great and fundamental\r\nprinciples of society and civilisation--to the common usage universally\r\nconsented to, and mutually and reciprocally maintained--to the unceasing\r\ncirculation of interest, which, passing through its million channels,\r\ninvigorates the whole mass of civilised man--it is to these things,\r\ninfinitely more than to anything which even the best instituted\r\ngovernment can perform, that the safety and prosperity of the individual\r\nand of the whole depends.\r\n\r\nThe more perfect civilisation is, the less occasion has it for\r\ngovernment, because the more does it regulate its own affairs, and\r\ngovern itself; but so contrary is the practice of old governments to the\r\nreason of the case, that the expenses of them increase in the proportion\r\nthey ought to diminish. It is but few general laws that civilised life\r\nrequires, and those of such common usefulness, that whether they are\r\nenforced by the forms of government or not, the effect will be nearly\r\nthe same. If we consider what the principles are that first condense\r\nmen into society, and what are the motives that regulate their mutual\r\nintercourse afterwards, we shall find, by the time we arrive at what is\r\ncalled government, that nearly the whole of the business is performed by\r\nthe natural operation of the parts upon each other.\r\n\r\nMan, with respect to all those matters, is more a creature of\r\nconsistency than he is aware, or than governments would wish him to\r\nbelieve. All the great laws of society are laws of nature. Those\r\nof trade and commerce, whether with respect to the intercourse of\r\nindividuals or of nations, are laws of mutual and reciprocal interest.\r\nThey are followed and obeyed, because it is the interest of the parties\r\nso to do, and not on account of any formal laws their governments may\r\nimpose or interpose.\r\n\r\nBut how often is the natural propensity to society disturbed or\r\ndestroyed by the operations of government! When the latter, instead of\r\nbeing ingrafted on the principles of the former, assumes to exist for\r\nitself, and acts by partialities of favour and oppression, it becomes\r\nthe cause of the mischiefs it ought to prevent.\r\n\r\nIf we look back to the riots and tumults which at various times have\r\nhappened in England, we shall find that they did not proceed from the\r\nwant of a government, but that government was itself the generating\r\ncause; instead of consolidating society it divided it; it deprived it\r\nof its natural cohesion, and engendered discontents and disorders\r\nwhich otherwise would not have existed. In those associations which men\r\npromiscuously form for the purpose of trade, or of any concern in which\r\ngovernment is totally out of the question, and in which they act merely\r\non the principles of society, we see how naturally the various parties\r\nunite; and this shows, by comparison, that governments, so far from\r\nbeing always the cause or means of order, are often the destruction\r\nof it. The riots of 1780 had no other source than the remains of those\r\nprejudices which the government itself had encouraged. But with respect\r\nto England there are also other causes.\r\n\r\nExcess and inequality of taxation, however disguised in the means, never\r\nfail to appear in their effects. As a great mass of the community are\r\nthrown thereby into poverty and discontent, they are constantly on the\r\nbrink of commotion; and deprived, as they unfortunately are, of the\r\nmeans of information, are easily heated to outrage. Whatever the\r\napparent cause of any riots may be, the real one is always want of\r\nhappiness. It shows that something is wrong in the system of government\r\nthat injures the felicity by which society is to be preserved.\r\n\r\nBut as a fact is superior to reasoning, the instance of America presents\r\nitself to confirm these observations. If there is a country in the world\r\nwhere concord, according to common calculation, would be least expected,\r\nit is America. Made up as it is of people from different nations,*[16]\r\naccustomed to different forms and habits of government, speaking\r\ndifferent languages, and more different in their modes of worship, it\r\nwould appear that the union of such a people was impracticable; but by\r\nthe simple operation of constructing government on the principles of\r\nsociety and the rights of man, every difficulty retires, and all the\r\nparts are brought into cordial unison. There the poor are not oppressed,\r\nthe rich are not privileged. Industry is not mortified by the splendid\r\nextravagance of a court rioting at its expense. Their taxes are few,\r\nbecause their government is just: and as there is nothing to render them\r\nwretched, there is nothing to engender riots and tumults.\r\n\r\nA metaphysical man, like Mr. Burke, would have tortured his invention\r\nto discover how such a people could be governed. He would have supposed\r\nthat some must be managed by fraud, others by force, and all by some\r\ncontrivance; that genius must be hired to impose upon ignorance, and\r\nshow and parade to fascinate the vulgar. Lost in the abundance of\r\nhis researches, he would have resolved and re-resolved, and finally\r\noverlooked the plain and easy road that lay directly before him.\r\n\r\nOne of the great advantages of the American Revolution has been, that it\r\nled to a discovery of the principles, and laid open the imposition, of\r\ngovernments. All the revolutions till then had been worked within the\r\natmosphere of a court, and never on the grand floor of a nation. The\r\nparties were always of the class of courtiers; and whatever was\r\ntheir rage for reformation, they carefully preserved the fraud of the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nIn all cases they took care to represent government as a thing made up\r\nof mysteries, which only themselves understood; and they hid from the\r\nunderstanding of the nation the only thing that was beneficial to know,\r\nnamely, That government is nothing more than a national association\r\nadding on the principles of society.\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to show that the social and civilised state of\r\nman is capable of performing within itself almost everything necessary\r\nto its protection and government, it will be proper, on the other hand,\r\nto take a review of the present old governments, and examine whether\r\ntheir principles and practice are correspondent thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PRESENT OLD GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that such governments as have hitherto existed in the\r\nworld, could have commenced by any other means than a total violation of\r\nevery principle sacred and moral. The obscurity in which the origin\r\nof all the present old governments is buried, implies the iniquity and\r\ndisgrace with which they began. The origin of the present government of\r\nAmerica and France will ever be remembered, because it is honourable\r\nto record it; but with respect to the rest, even Flattery has consigned\r\nthem to the tomb of time, without an inscription.\r\n\r\nIt could have been no difficult thing in the early and solitary ages\r\nof the world, while the chief employment of men was that of attending\r\nflocks and herds, for a banditti of ruffians to overrun a country, and\r\nlay it under contributions. Their power being thus established, the\r\nchief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of\r\nMonarch; and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Government of England, so far as relates to what is\r\ncalled its line of monarchy, being one of the latest, is perhaps the\r\nbest recorded. The hatred which the Norman invasion and tyranny begat,\r\nmust have been deeply rooted in the nation, to have outlived the\r\ncontrivance to obliterate it. Though not a courtier will talk of the\r\ncurfew-bell, not a village in England has forgotten it.\r\n\r\nThose bands of robbers having parcelled out the world, and divided it\r\ninto dominions, began, as is naturally the case, to quarrel with each\r\nother. What at first was obtained by violence was considered by others\r\nas lawful to be taken, and a second plunderer succeeded the first. They\r\nalternately invaded the dominions which each had assigned to himself,\r\nand the brutality with which they treated each other explains the\r\noriginal character of monarchy. It was ruffian torturing ruffian.\r\nThe conqueror considered the conquered, not as his prisoner, but his\r\nproperty. He led him in triumph rattling in chains, and doomed him, at\r\npleasure, to slavery or death. As time obliterated the history of their\r\nbeginning, their successors assumed new appearances, to cut off the\r\nentail of their disgrace, but their principles and objects remained the\r\nsame. What at first was plunder, assumed the softer name of revenue; and\r\nthe power originally usurped, they affected to inherit.\r\n\r\nFrom such beginning of governments, what could be expected but a\r\ncontinued system of war and extortion? It has established itself into a\r\ntrade. The vice is not peculiar to one more than to another, but is the\r\ncommon principle of all. There does not exist within such governments\r\nsufficient stamina whereon to engraft reformation; and the shortest and\r\nmost effectual remedy is to begin anew on the ground of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhat scenes of horror, what perfection of iniquity, present themselves\r\nin contemplating the character and reviewing the history of such\r\ngovernments! If we would delineate human nature with a baseness of\r\nheart and hypocrisy of countenance that reflection would shudder at and\r\nhumanity disown, it is kings, courts and cabinets that must sit for the\r\nportrait. Man, naturally as he is, with all his faults about him, is not\r\nup to the character.\r\n\r\nCan we possibly suppose that if governments had originated in a right\r\nprinciple, and had not an interest in pursuing a wrong one, the world\r\ncould have been in the wretched and quarrelsome condition we have seen\r\nit? What inducement has the farmer, while following the plough, to lay\r\naside his peaceful pursuit, and go to war with the farmer of another\r\ncountry? or what inducement has the manufacturer? What is dominion to\r\nthem, or to any class of men in a nation? Does it add an acre to any\r\nman's estate, or raise its value? Are not conquest and defeat each of\r\nthe same price, and taxes the never-failing consequence?--Though this\r\nreasoning may be good to a nation, it is not so to a government. War is\r\nthe Pharo-table of governments, and nations the dupes of the game.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything to wonder at in this miserable scene of governments\r\nmore than might be expected, it is the progress which the peaceful arts\r\nof agriculture, manufacture and commerce have made beneath such a long\r\naccumulating load of discouragement and oppression. It serves to show\r\nthat instinct in animals does not act with stronger impulse than\r\nthe principles of society and civilisation operate in man. Under all\r\ndiscouragements, he pursues his object, and yields to nothing but\r\nimpossibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. OF THE OLD AND NEW SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nNothing can appear more contradictory than the principles on which the\r\nold governments began, and the condition to which society, civilisation\r\nand commerce are capable of carrying mankind. Government, on the old\r\nsystem, is an assumption of power, for the aggrandisement of itself; on\r\nthe new, a delegation of power for the common benefit of society.\r\nThe former supports itself by keeping up a system of war; the latter\r\npromotes a system of peace, as the true means of enriching a nation.\r\nThe one encourages national prejudices; the other promotes universal\r\nsociety, as the means of universal commerce. The one measures its\r\nprosperity, by the quantity of revenue it extorts; the other proves its\r\nexcellence, by the small quantity of taxes it requires.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke has talked of old and new whigs. If he can amuse himself with\r\nchildish names and distinctions, I shall not interrupt his pleasure. It\r\nis not to him, but to the Abbe Sieyes, that I address this chapter. I\r\nam already engaged to the latter gentleman to discuss the subject of\r\nmonarchical government; and as it naturally occurs in comparing the old\r\nand new systems, I make this the opportunity of presenting to him my\r\nobservations. I shall occasionally take Mr. Burke in my way.\r\n\r\nThough it might be proved that the system of government now called the\r\nNew, is the most ancient in principle of all that have existed, being\r\nfounded on the original, inherent Rights of Man: yet, as tyranny and\r\nthe sword have suspended the exercise of those rights for many centuries\r\npast, it serves better the purpose of distinction to call it the new,\r\nthan to claim the right of calling it the old.\r\n\r\nThe first general distinction between those two systems, is, that the\r\none now called the old is hereditary, either in whole or in part;\r\nand the new is entirely representative. It rejects all hereditary\r\ngovernment:\r\n\r\nFirst, As being an imposition on mankind.\r\n\r\nSecondly, As inadequate to the purposes for which government is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first of these heads--It cannot be proved by what\r\nright hereditary government could begin; neither does there exist\r\nwithin the compass of mortal power a right to establish it. Man has no\r\nauthority over posterity in matters of personal right; and, therefore,\r\nno man, or body of men, had, or can have, a right to set up hereditary\r\ngovernment. Were even ourselves to come again into existence, instead of\r\nbeing succeeded by posterity, we have not now the right of taking from\r\nourselves the rights which would then be ours. On what ground, then, do\r\nwe pretend to take them from others?\r\n\r\nAll hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. An heritable crown,\r\nor an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name such things may\r\nbe called, have no other significant explanation than that mankind are\r\nheritable property. To inherit a government, is to inherit the people,\r\nas if they were flocks and herds.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the second head, that of being inadequate to the\r\npurposes for which government is necessary, we have only to consider\r\nwhat government essentially is, and compare it with the circumstances to\r\nwhich hereditary succession is subject.\r\n\r\nGovernment ought to be a thing always in full maturity. It ought to\r\nbe so constructed as to be superior to all the accidents to which\r\nindividual man is subject; and, therefore, hereditary succession, by\r\nbeing subject to them all, is the most irregular and imperfect of all\r\nthe systems of government.\r\n\r\nWe have heard the Rights of Man called a levelling system; but the\r\nonly system to which the word levelling is truly applicable, is the\r\nhereditary monarchical system. It is a system of mental levelling.\r\nIt indiscriminately admits every species of character to the same\r\nauthority. Vice and virtue, ignorance and wisdom, in short, every\r\nquality good or bad, is put on the same level. Kings succeed each other,\r\nnot as rationals, but as animals. It signifies not what their mental or\r\nmoral characters are. Can we then be surprised at the abject state of\r\nthe human mind in monarchical countries, when the government itself is\r\nformed on such an abject levelling system?--It has no fixed character.\r\nTo-day it is one thing; to-morrow it is something else. It changes with\r\nthe temper of every succeeding individual, and is subject to all the\r\nvarieties of each. It is government through the medium of passions and\r\naccidents. It appears under all the various characters of childhood,\r\ndecrepitude, dotage, a thing at nurse, in leading-strings, or in\r\ncrutches. It reverses the wholesome order of nature. It occasionally\r\nputs children over men, and the conceits of nonage over wisdom and\r\nexperience. In short, we cannot conceive a more ridiculous figure of\r\ngovernment, than hereditary succession, in all its cases, presents.\r\n\r\nCould it be made a decree in nature, or an edict registered in heaven,\r\nand man could know it, that virtue and wisdom should invariably\r\nappertain to hereditary succession, the objection to it would be\r\nremoved; but when we see that nature acts as if she disowned and sported\r\nwith the hereditary system; that the mental character of successors, in\r\nall countries, is below the average of human understanding; that one is\r\na tyrant, another an idiot, a third insane, and some all three together,\r\nit is impossible to attach confidence to it, when reason in man has\r\npower to act.\r\n\r\nIt is not to the Abbe Sieyes that I need apply this reasoning; he has\r\nalready saved me that trouble by giving his own opinion upon the\r\ncase. \"If it be asked,\" says he, \"what is my opinion with respect to\r\nhereditary right, I answer without hesitation, That in good theory, an\r\nhereditary transmission of any power of office, can never accord with\r\nthe laws of a true representation. Hereditaryship is, in this sense, as\r\nmuch an attaint upon principle, as an outrage upon society. But let\r\nus,\" continues he, \"refer to the history of all elective monarchies and\r\nprincipalities: is there one in which the elective mode is not worse\r\nthan the hereditary succession?\"\r\n\r\nAs to debating on which is the worst of the two, it is admitting both\r\nto be bad; and herein we are agreed. The preference which the Abbe has\r\ngiven, is a condemnation of the thing that he prefers. Such a mode of\r\nreasoning on such a subject is inadmissible, because it finally amounts\r\nto an accusation upon Providence, as if she had left to man no other\r\nchoice with respect to government than between two evils, the best of\r\nwhich he admits to be \"an attaint upon principle, and an outrage upon\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\nPassing over, for the present, all the evils and mischiefs which\r\nmonarchy has occasioned in the world, nothing can more effectually\r\nprove its uselessness in a state of civil government, than making it\r\nhereditary. Would we make any office hereditary that required wisdom and\r\nabilities to fill it? And where wisdom and abilities are not necessary,\r\nsuch an office, whatever it may be, is superfluous or insignificant.\r\n\r\nHereditary succession is a burlesque upon monarchy. It puts it in the\r\nmost ridiculous light, by presenting it as an office which any child or\r\nidiot may fill. It requires some talents to be a common mechanic; but\r\nto be a king requires only the animal figure of man--a sort of breathing\r\nautomaton. This sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it\r\ncannot long resist the awakened reason and interest of man.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Burke, he is a stickler for monarchy, not altogether as a\r\npensioner, if he is one, which I believe, but as a political man. He\r\nhas taken up a contemptible opinion of mankind, who, in their turn, are\r\ntaking up the same of him. He considers them as a herd of beings that\r\nmust be governed by fraud, effigy, and show; and an idol would be as\r\ngood a figure of monarchy with him, as a man. I will, however, do him\r\nthe justice to say that, with respect to America, he has been very\r\ncomplimentary. He always contended, at least in my hearing, that the\r\npeople of America were more enlightened than those of England, or of\r\nany country in Europe; and that therefore the imposition of show was not\r\nnecessary in their governments.\r\n\r\nThough the comparison between hereditary and elective monarchy,\r\nwhich the Abbe has made, is unnecessary to the case, because the\r\nrepresentative system rejects both: yet, were I to make the comparison,\r\nI should decide contrary to what he has done.\r\n\r\nThe civil wars which have originated from contested hereditary\r\nclaims, are more numerous, and have been more dreadful, and of longer\r\ncontinuance, than those which have been occasioned by election. All the\r\ncivil wars in France arose from the hereditary system; they were either\r\nproduced by hereditary claims, or by the imperfection of the hereditary\r\nform, which admits of regencies or monarchy at nurse. With respect to\r\nEngland, its history is full of the same misfortunes. The contests\r\nfor succession between the houses of York and Lancaster lasted a whole\r\ncentury; and others of a similar nature have renewed themselves\r\nsince that period. Those of 1715 and 1745 were of the same kind. The\r\nsuccession war for the crown of Spain embroiled almost half Europe. The\r\ndisturbances of Holland are generated from the hereditaryship of the\r\nStadtholder. A government calling itself free, with an hereditary\r\noffice, is like a thorn in the flesh, that produces a fermentation which\r\nendeavours to discharge it.\r\n\r\nBut I might go further, and place also foreign wars, of whatever kind,\r\nto the same cause. It is by adding the evil of hereditary succession\r\nto that of monarchy, that a permanent family interest is created, whose\r\nconstant objects are dominion and revenue. Poland, though an elective\r\nmonarchy, has had fewer wars than those which are hereditary; and it is\r\nthe only government that has made a voluntary essay, though but a small\r\none, to reform the condition of the country.\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at a few of the defects of the old, or hereditary\r\nsystems of government, let us compare it with the new, or representative\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe representative system takes society and civilisation for its basis;\r\nnature, reason, and experience, for its guide.\r\n\r\nExperience, in all ages, and in all countries, has demonstrated that it\r\nis impossible to control Nature in her distribution of mental powers.\r\nShe gives them as she pleases. Whatever is the rule by which she,\r\napparently to us, scatters them among mankind, that rule remains\r\na secret to man. It would be as ridiculous to attempt to fix the\r\nhereditaryship of human beauty, as of wisdom. Whatever wisdom\r\nconstituently is, it is like a seedless plant; it may be reared when\r\nit appears, but it cannot be voluntarily produced. There is always a\r\nsufficiency somewhere in the general mass of society for all purposes;\r\nbut with respect to the parts of society, it is continually changing\r\nits place. It rises in one to-day, in another to-morrow, and has most\r\nprobably visited in rotation every family of the earth, and again\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nAs this is in the order of nature, the order of government must\r\nnecessarily follow it, or government will, as we see it does, degenerate\r\ninto ignorance. The hereditary system, therefore, is as repugnant to\r\nhuman wisdom as to human rights; and is as absurd as it is unjust.\r\n\r\nAs the republic of letters brings forward the best literary productions,\r\nby giving to genius a fair and universal chance; so the representative\r\nsystem of government is calculated to produce the wisest laws, by\r\ncollecting wisdom from where it can be found. I smile to myself when I\r\ncontemplate the ridiculous insignificance into which literature and all\r\nthe sciences would sink, were they made hereditary; and I carry the same\r\nidea into governments. An hereditary governor is as inconsistent as an\r\nhereditary author. I know not whether Homer or Euclid had sons; but\r\nI will venture an opinion that if they had, and had left their works\r\nunfinished, those sons could not have completed them.\r\n\r\nDo we need a stronger evidence of the absurdity of hereditary government\r\nthan is seen in the descendants of those men, in any line of life, who\r\nonce were famous? Is there scarcely an instance in which there is not\r\na total reverse of the character? It appears as if the tide of mental\r\nfaculties flowed as far as it could in certain channels, and then\r\nforsook its course, and arose in others. How irrational then is the\r\nhereditary system, which establishes channels of power, in company\r\nwith which wisdom refuses to flow! By continuing this absurdity, man is\r\nperpetually in contradiction with himself; he accepts, for a king, or a\r\nchief magistrate, or a legislator, a person whom he would not elect for\r\na constable.\r\n\r\nIt appears to general observation, that revolutions create genius and\r\ntalents; but those events do no more than bring them forward. There is\r\nexisting in man, a mass of sense lying in a dormant state, and which,\r\nunless something excites it to action, will descend with him, in that\r\ncondition, to the grave. As it is to the advantage of society that\r\nthe whole of its faculties should be employed, the construction of\r\ngovernment ought to be such as to bring forward, by a quiet and regular\r\noperation, all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nThis cannot take place in the insipid state of hereditary government,\r\nnot only because it prevents, but because it operates to benumb. When\r\nthe mind of a nation is bowed down by any political superstition in its\r\ngovernment, such as hereditary succession is, it loses a considerable\r\nportion of its powers on all other subjects and objects. Hereditary\r\nsuccession requires the same obedience to ignorance, as to wisdom;\r\nand when once the mind can bring itself to pay this indiscriminate\r\nreverence, it descends below the stature of mental manhood. It is fit\r\nto be great only in little things. It acts a treachery upon itself, and\r\nsuffocates the sensations that urge the detection.\r\n\r\nThough the ancient governments present to us a miserable picture of the\r\ncondition of man, there is one which above all others exempts itself\r\nfrom the general description. I mean the democracy of the Athenians. We\r\nsee more to admire, and less to condemn, in that great, extraordinary\r\npeople, than in anything which history affords.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke is so little acquainted with constituent principles of\r\ngovernment, that he confounds democracy and representation together.\r\nRepresentation was a thing unknown in the ancient democracies. In those\r\nthe mass of the people met and enacted laws (grammatically speaking) in\r\nthe first person. Simple democracy was no other than the common hall of\r\nthe ancients. It signifies the form, as well as the public principle of\r\nthe government. As those democracies increased in population, and the\r\nterritory extended, the simple democratical form became unwieldy and\r\nimpracticable; and as the system of representation was not known, the\r\nconsequence was, they either degenerated convulsively into monarchies,\r\nor became absorbed into such as then existed. Had the system of\r\nrepresentation been then understood, as it now is, there is no reason\r\nto believe that those forms of government, now called monarchical or\r\naristocratical, would ever have taken place. It was the want of\r\nsome method to consolidate the parts of society, after it became too\r\npopulous, and too extensive for the simple democratical form, and also\r\nthe lax and solitary condition of shepherds and herdsmen in other parts\r\nof the world, that afforded opportunities to those unnatural modes of\r\ngovernment to begin.\r\n\r\nAs it is necessary to clear away the rubbish of errors, into which the\r\nsubject of government has been thrown, I will proceed to remark on some\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt has always been the political craft of courtiers and\r\ncourt-governments, to abuse something which they called republicanism;\r\nbut what republicanism was, or is, they never attempt to explain. Let us\r\nexamine a little into this case.\r\n\r\nThe only forms of government are the democratical, the aristocratical,\r\nthe monarchical, and what is now called the representative.\r\n\r\nWhat is called a republic is not any particular form of government. It\r\nis wholly characteristical of the purport, matter or object for which\r\ngovernment ought to be instituted, and on which it is to be employed,\r\nRes-Publica, the public affairs, or the public good; or, literally\r\ntranslated, the public thing. It is a word of a good original, referring\r\nto what ought to be the character and business of government; and in\r\nthis sense it is naturally opposed to the word monarchy, which has a\r\nbase original signification. It means arbitrary power in an individual\r\nperson; in the exercise of which, himself, and not the res-publica, is\r\nthe object.\r\n\r\nEvery government that does not act on the principle of a Republic, or\r\nin other words, that does not make the res-publica its whole and sole\r\nobject, is not a good government. Republican government is no other than\r\ngovernment established and conducted for the interest of the public, as\r\nwell individually as collectively. It is not necessarily connected\r\nwith any particular form, but it most naturally associates with the\r\nrepresentative form, as being best calculated to secure the end for\r\nwhich a nation is at the expense of supporting it.\r\n\r\nVarious forms of government have affected to style themselves a\r\nrepublic. Poland calls itself a republic, which is an hereditary\r\naristocracy, with what is called an elective monarchy. Holland calls\r\nitself a republic, which is chiefly aristocratical, with an hereditary\r\nstadtholdership. But the government of America, which is wholly on the\r\nsystem of representation, is the only real Republic, in character and in\r\npractice, that now exists. Its government has no other object than the\r\npublic business of the nation, and therefore it is properly a republic;\r\nand the Americans have taken care that This, and no other, shall\r\nalways be the object of their government, by their rejecting everything\r\nhereditary, and establishing governments on the system of representation\r\nonly. Those who have said that a republic is not a form of government\r\ncalculated for countries of great extent, mistook, in the first\r\nplace, the business of a government, for a form of government; for\r\nthe res-publica equally appertains to every extent of territory and\r\npopulation. And, in the second place, if they meant anything with\r\nrespect to form, it was the simple democratical form, such as was the\r\nmode of government in the ancient democracies, in which there was no\r\nrepresentation. The case, therefore, is not, that a republic cannot be\r\nextensive, but that it cannot be extensive on the simple democratical\r\nform; and the question naturally presents itself, What is the best form\r\nof government for conducting the Res-Publica, or the Public Business\r\nof a nation, after it becomes too extensive and populous for the simple\r\ndemocratical form? It cannot be monarchy, because monarchy is subject\r\nto an objection of the same amount to which the simple democratical form\r\nwas subject.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that an individual may lay down a system of principles,\r\non which government shall be constitutionally established to any extent\r\nof territory. This is no more than an operation of the mind, acting by\r\nits own powers. But the practice upon those principles, as applying to\r\nthe various and numerous circumstances of a nation, its agriculture,\r\nmanufacture, trade, commerce, etc., etc., a knowledge of a different\r\nkind, and which can be had only from the various parts of society. It is\r\nan assemblage of practical knowledge, which no individual can possess;\r\nand therefore the monarchical form is as much limited, in useful\r\npractice, from the incompetency of knowledge, as was the democratical\r\nform, from the multiplicity of population. The one degenerates, by\r\nextension, into confusion; the other, into ignorance and incapacity, of\r\nwhich all the great monarchies are an evidence. The monarchical form,\r\ntherefore, could not be a substitute for the democratical, because it\r\nhas equal inconveniences.\r\n\r\nMuch less could it when made hereditary. This is the most effectual of\r\nall forms to preclude knowledge. Neither could the high democratical\r\nmind have voluntarily yielded itself to be governed by children and\r\nidiots, and all the motley insignificance of character, which attends\r\nsuch a mere animal system, the disgrace and the reproach of reason and\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nAs to the aristocratical form, it has the same vices and defects with\r\nthe monarchical, except that the chance of abilities is better from the\r\nproportion of numbers, but there is still no security for the right use\r\nand application of them.*[17]\r\n\r\nReferring them to the original simple democracy, it affords the true\r\ndata from which government on a large scale can begin. It is incapable\r\nof extension, not from its principle, but from the inconvenience of its\r\nform; and monarchy and aristocracy, from their incapacity. Retaining,\r\nthen, democracy as the ground, and rejecting the corrupt systems of\r\nmonarchy and aristocracy, the representative system naturally presents\r\nitself; remedying at once the defects of the simple democracy as to\r\nform, and the incapacity of the other two with respect to knowledge.\r\n\r\nSimple democracy was society governing itself without the aid of\r\nsecondary means. By ingrafting representation upon democracy, we arrive\r\nat a system of government capable of embracing and confederating all the\r\nvarious interests and every extent of territory and population; and that\r\nalso with advantages as much superior to hereditary government, as the\r\nrepublic of letters is to hereditary literature.\r\n\r\nIt is on this system that the American government is founded. It is\r\nrepresentation ingrafted upon democracy. It has fixed the form by a\r\nscale parallel in all cases to the extent of the principle. What Athens\r\nwas in miniature America will be in magnitude. The one was the wonder of\r\nthe ancient world; the other is becoming the admiration of the present.\r\nIt is the easiest of all the forms of government to be understood and\r\nthe most eligible in practice; and excludes at once the ignorance and\r\ninsecurity of the hereditary mode, and the inconvenience of the simple\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive a system of government capable of acting\r\nover such an extent of territory, and such a circle of interests, as is\r\nimmediately produced by the operation of representation. France, great\r\nand populous as it is, is but a spot in the capaciousness of the system.\r\nIt is preferable to simple democracy even in small territories. Athens,\r\nby representation, would have outrivalled her own democracy.\r\n\r\nThat which is called government, or rather that which we ought to\r\nconceive government to be, is no more than some common center in which\r\nall the parts of society unite. This cannot be accomplished by any\r\nmethod so conducive to the various interests of the community, as by the\r\nrepresentative system. It concentrates the knowledge necessary to the\r\ninterest of the parts, and of the whole. It places government in a state\r\nof constant maturity. It is, as has already been observed, never young,\r\nnever old. It is subject neither to nonage, nor dotage. It is never\r\nin the cradle, nor on crutches. It admits not of a separation between\r\nknowledge and power, and is superior, as government always ought to be,\r\nto all the accidents of individual man, and is therefore superior to\r\nwhat is called monarchy.\r\n\r\nA nation is not a body, the figure of which is to be represented by\r\nthe human body; but is like a body contained within a circle, having a\r\ncommon center, in which every radius meets; and that center is formed by\r\nrepresentation. To connect representation with what is called monarchy,\r\nis eccentric government. Representation is of itself the delegated\r\nmonarchy of a nation, and cannot debase itself by dividing it with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke has two or three times, in his parliamentary speeches, and in\r\nhis publications, made use of a jingle of words that convey no ideas.\r\nSpeaking of government, he says, \"It is better to have monarchy for its\r\nbasis, and republicanism for its corrective, than republicanism for its\r\nbasis, and monarchy for its corrective.\"--If he means that it is\r\nbetter to correct folly with wisdom, than wisdom with folly, I will no\r\notherwise contend with him, than that it would be much better to reject\r\nthe folly entirely.\r\n\r\nBut what is this thing which Mr. Burke calls monarchy? Will he explain\r\nit? All men can understand what representation is; and that it must\r\nnecessarily include a variety of knowledge and talents. But what\r\nsecurity is there for the same qualities on the part of monarchy? or,\r\nwhen the monarchy is a child, where then is the wisdom? What does\r\nit know about government? Who then is the monarch, or where is the\r\nmonarchy? If it is to be performed by regency, it proves to be a farce.\r\nA regency is a mock species of republic, and the whole of monarchy\r\ndeserves no better description. It is a thing as various as imagination\r\ncan paint. It has none of the stable character that government ought\r\nto possess. Every succession is a revolution, and every regency a\r\ncounter-revolution. The whole of it is a scene of perpetual court cabal\r\nand intrigue, of which Mr. Burke is himself an instance. To render\r\nmonarchy consistent with government, the next in succession should\r\nnot be born a child, but a man at once, and that man a Solomon. It is\r\nridiculous that nations are to wait and government be interrupted till\r\nboys grow to be men.\r\n\r\nWhether I have too little sense to see, or too much to be imposed upon;\r\nwhether I have too much or too little pride, or of anything else,\r\nI leave out of the question; but certain it is, that what is called\r\nmonarchy, always appears to me a silly, contemptible thing. I compare it\r\nto something kept behind a curtain, about which there is a great deal of\r\nbustle and fuss, and a wonderful air of seeming solemnity; but when, by\r\nany accident, the curtain happens to be open--and the company see what\r\nit is, they burst into laughter.\r\n\r\nIn the representative system of government, nothing of this can happen.\r\nLike the nation itself, it possesses a perpetual stamina, as well of\r\nbody as of mind, and presents itself on the open theatre of the world in\r\na fair and manly manner. Whatever are its excellences or defects, they\r\nare visible to all. It exists not by fraud and mystery; it deals not in\r\ncant and sophistry; but inspires a language that, passing from heart to\r\nheart, is felt and understood.\r\n\r\nWe must shut our eyes against reason, we must basely degrade our\r\nunderstanding, not to see the folly of what is called monarchy. Nature\r\nis orderly in all her works; but this is a mode of government that\r\ncounteracts nature. It turns the progress of the human faculties upside\r\ndown. It subjects age to be governed by children, and wisdom by folly.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the representative system is always parallel with the\r\norder and immutable laws of nature, and meets the reason of man in every\r\npart. For example:\r\n\r\nIn the American Federal Government, more power is delegated to the\r\nPresident of the United States than to any other individual member of\r\nCongress. He cannot, therefore, be elected to this office under the\r\nage of thirty-five years. By this time the judgment of man becomes more\r\nmatured, and he has lived long enough to be acquainted with men and\r\nthings, and the country with him.--But on the monarchial plan (exclusive\r\nof the numerous chances there are against every man born into the world,\r\nof drawing a prize in the lottery of human faculties), the next in\r\nsuccession, whatever he may be, is put at the head of a nation, and of\r\na government, at the age of eighteen years. Does this appear like an\r\naction of wisdom? Is it consistent with the proper dignity and the manly\r\ncharacter of a nation? Where is the propriety of calling such a lad the\r\nfather of the people?--In all other cases, a person is a minor until the\r\nage of twenty-one years. Before this period, he is not trusted with the\r\nmanagement of an acre of land, or with the heritable property of a flock\r\nof sheep, or an herd of swine; but, wonderful to tell! he may, at the\r\nage of eighteen years, be trusted with a nation.\r\n\r\nThat monarchy is all a bubble, a mere court artifice to procure money,\r\nis evident (at least to me) in every character in which it can be\r\nviewed. It would be impossible, on the rational system of representative\r\ngovernment, to make out a bill of expenses to such an enormous amount\r\nas this deception admits. Government is not of itself a very chargeable\r\ninstitution. The whole expense of the federal government of America,\r\nfounded, as I have already said, on the system of representation, and\r\nextending over a country nearly ten times as large as England, is but\r\nsix hundred thousand dollars, or one hundred and thirty-five thousand\r\npounds sterling.\r\n\r\nI presume that no man in his sober senses will compare the character\r\nof any of the kings of Europe with that of General Washington. Yet, in\r\nFrance, and also in England, the expense of the civil list only, for the\r\nsupport of one man, is eight times greater than the whole expense of\r\nthe federal government in America. To assign a reason for this, appears\r\nalmost impossible. The generality of people in America, especially the\r\npoor, are more able to pay taxes, than the generality of people either\r\nin France or England.\r\n\r\nBut the case is, that the representative system diffuses such a body\r\nof knowledge throughout a nation, on the subject of government, as to\r\nexplode ignorance and preclude imposition. The craft of courts cannot be\r\nacted on that ground. There is no place for mystery; nowhere for it\r\nto begin. Those who are not in the representation, know as much of\r\nthe nature of business as those who are. An affectation of mysterious\r\nimportance would there be scouted. Nations can have no secrets; and the\r\nsecrets of courts, like those of individuals, are always their defects.\r\n\r\nIn the representative system, the reason for everything must publicly\r\nappear. Every man is a proprietor in government, and considers it a\r\nnecessary part of his business to understand. It concerns his interest,\r\nbecause it affects his property. He examines the cost, and compares it\r\nwith the advantages; and above all, he does not adopt the slavish custom\r\nof following what in other governments are called Leaders.\r\n\r\nIt can only be by blinding the understanding of man, and making him\r\nbelieve that government is some wonderful mysterious thing, that\r\nexcessive revenues are obtained. Monarchy is well calculated to ensure\r\nthis end. It is the popery of government; a thing kept up to amuse the\r\nignorant, and quiet them into taxes.\r\n\r\nThe government of a free country, properly speaking, is not in the\r\npersons, but in the laws. The enacting of those requires no great\r\nexpense; and when they are administered, the whole of civil government\r\nis performed--the rest is all court contrivance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. OF CONSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nThat men mean distinct and separate things when they speak of\r\nconstitutions and of governments, is evident; or why are those terms\r\ndistinctly and separately used? A constitution is not the act of a\r\ngovernment, but of a people constituting a government; and government\r\nwithout a constitution, is power without a right.\r\n\r\nAll power exercised over a nation, must have some beginning. It\r\nmust either be delegated or assumed. There are no other sources. All\r\ndelegated power is trust, and all assumed power is usurpation. Time does\r\nnot alter the nature and quality of either.\r\n\r\nIn viewing this subject, the case and circumstances of America present\r\nthemselves as in the beginning of a world; and our enquiry into the\r\norigin of government is shortened, by referring to the facts that have\r\narisen in our own day. We have no occasion to roam for information into\r\nthe obscure field of antiquity, nor hazard ourselves upon conjecture.\r\nWe are brought at once to the point of seeing government begin, as if we\r\nhad lived in the beginning of time. The real volume, not of history,\r\nbut of facts, is directly before us, unmutilated by contrivance, or the\r\nerrors of tradition.\r\n\r\nI will here concisely state the commencement of the American\r\nconstitutions; by which the difference between constitutions and\r\ngovernments will sufficiently appear.\r\n\r\nIt may not appear improper to remind the reader that the United\r\nStates of America consist of thirteen separate states, each of\r\nwhich established a government for itself, after the declaration of\r\nindependence, done the 4th of July, 1776. Each state acted independently\r\nof the rest, in forming its governments; but the same general principle\r\npervades the whole. When the several state governments were formed, they\r\nproceeded to form the federal government, that acts over the whole in\r\nall matters which concern the interest of the whole, or which relate to\r\nthe intercourse of the several states with each other, or with foreign\r\nnations. I will begin with giving an instance from one of the state\r\ngovernments (that of Pennsylvania) and then proceed to the federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe state of Pennsylvania, though nearly of the same extent of territory\r\nas England, was then divided into only twelve counties. Each of those\r\ncounties had elected a committee at the commencement of the dispute with\r\nthe English government; and as the city of Philadelphia, which also\r\nhad its committee, was the most central for intelligence, it became\r\nthe center of communication to the several country committees. When\r\nit became necessary to proceed to the formation of a government, the\r\ncommittee of Philadelphia proposed a conference of all the committees,\r\nto be held in that city, and which met the latter end of July, 1776.\r\n\r\nThough these committees had been duly elected by the people, they were\r\nnot elected expressly for the purpose, nor invested with the authority\r\nof forming a constitution; and as they could not, consistently with the\r\nAmerican idea of rights, assume such a power, they could only confer\r\nupon the matter, and put it into a train of operation. The conferees,\r\ntherefore, did no more than state the case, and recommend to the several\r\ncounties to elect six representatives for each county, to meet in\r\nconvention at Philadelphia, with powers to form a constitution, and\r\npropose it for public consideration.\r\n\r\nThis convention, of which Benjamin Franklin was president, having met\r\nand deliberated, and agreed upon a constitution, they next ordered it to\r\nbe published, not as a thing established, but for the consideration of\r\nthe whole people, their approbation or rejection, and then adjourned to\r\na stated time. When the time of adjournment was expired, the convention\r\nre-assembled; and as the general opinion of the people in approbation of\r\nit was then known, the constitution was signed, sealed, and proclaimed\r\non the authority of the people and the original instrument deposited\r\nas a public record. The convention then appointed a day for the general\r\nelection of the representatives who were to compose the government, and\r\nthe time it should commence; and having done this they dissolved, and\r\nreturned to their several homes and occupations.\r\n\r\nIn this constitution were laid down, first, a declaration of rights;\r\nthen followed the form which the government should have, and the powers\r\nit should possess--the authority of the courts of judicature, and of\r\njuries--the manner in which elections should be conducted, and the\r\nproportion of representatives to the number of electors--the time which\r\neach succeeding assembly should continue, which was one year--the mode\r\nof levying, and of accounting for the expenditure, of public money--of\r\nappointing public officers, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nNo article of this constitution could be altered or infringed at\r\nthe discretion of the government that was to ensue. It was to that\r\ngovernment a law. But as it would have been unwise to preclude the\r\nbenefit of experience, and in order also to prevent the accumulation of\r\nerrors, if any should be found, and to preserve an unison of government\r\nwith the circumstances of the state at all times, the constitution\r\nprovided that, at the expiration of every seven years, a convention\r\nshould be elected, for the express purpose of revising the constitution,\r\nand making alterations, additions, or abolitions therein, if any such\r\nshould be found necessary.\r\n\r\nHere we see a regular process--a government issuing out of a\r\nconstitution, formed by the people in their original character; and that\r\nconstitution serving, not only as an authority, but as a law of control\r\nto the government. It was the political bible of the state. Scarcely a\r\nfamily was without it. Every member of the government had a copy; and\r\nnothing was more common, when any debate arose on the principle of a\r\nbill, or on the extent of any species of authority, than for the members\r\nto take the printed constitution out of their pocket, and read the\r\nchapter with which such matter in debate was connected.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given an instance from one of the states, I will show the\r\nproceedings by which the federal constitution of the United States arose\r\nand was formed.\r\n\r\nCongress, at its two first meetings, in September 1774, and May 1775,\r\nwas nothing more than a deputation from the legislatures of the several\r\nprovinces, afterwards states; and had no other authority than what arose\r\nfrom common consent, and the necessity of its acting as a public body.\r\nIn everything which related to the internal affairs of America, congress\r\nwent no further than to issue recommendations to the several provincial\r\nassemblies, who at discretion adopted them or not. Nothing on the\r\npart of congress was compulsive; yet, in this situation, it was more\r\nfaithfully and affectionately obeyed than was any government in\r\nEurope. This instance, like that of the national assembly in France,\r\nsufficiently shows, that the strength of government does not consist in\r\nany thing itself, but in the attachment of a nation, and the interest\r\nwhich a people feel in supporting it. When this is lost, government is\r\nbut a child in power; and though, like the old government in France, it\r\nmay harass individuals for a while, it but facilitates its own fall.\r\n\r\nAfter the declaration of independence, it became consistent with the\r\nprinciple on which representative government is founded, that the\r\nauthority of congress should be defined and established. Whether that\r\nauthority should be more or less than congress then discretionarily\r\nexercised was not the question. It was merely the rectitude of the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, the act, called the act of confederation (which was a\r\nsort of imperfect federal constitution), was proposed, and, after long\r\ndeliberation, was concluded in the year 1781. It was not the act of\r\ncongress, because it is repugnant to the principles of representative\r\ngovernment that a body should give power to itself. Congress first\r\ninformed the several states, of the powers which it conceived were\r\nnecessary to be invested in the union, to enable it to perform the\r\nduties and services required from it; and the states severally agreed\r\nwith each other, and concentrated in congress those powers.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to observe that in both those instances (the one\r\nof Pennsylvania, and the other of the United States), there is no such\r\nthing as the idea of a compact between the people on one side, and the\r\ngovernment on the other. The compact was that of the people with each\r\nother, to produce and constitute a government. To suppose that any\r\ngovernment can be a party in a compact with the whole people, is to\r\nsuppose it to have existence before it can have a right to exist. The\r\nonly instance in which a compact can take place between the people and\r\nthose who exercise the government, is, that the people shall pay them,\r\nwhile they choose to employ them.\r\n\r\nGovernment is not a trade which any man, or any body of men, has a right\r\nto set up and exercise for his own emolument, but is altogether a trust,\r\nin right of those by whom that trust is delegated, and by whom it is\r\nalways resumeable. It has of itself no rights; they are altogether\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given two instances of the original formation of a\r\nconstitution, I will show the manner in which both have been changed\r\nsince their first establishment.\r\n\r\nThe powers vested in the governments of the several states, by the state\r\nconstitutions, were found, upon experience, to be too great; and those\r\nvested in the federal government, by the act of confederation, too\r\nlittle. The defect was not in the principle, but in the distribution of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nNumerous publications, in pamphlets and in the newspapers, appeared,\r\non the propriety and necessity of new modelling the federal government.\r\nAfter some time of public discussion, carried on through the channel\r\nof the press, and in conversations, the state of Virginia, experiencing\r\nsome inconvenience with respect to commerce, proposed holding a\r\ncontinental conference; in consequence of which, a deputation from five\r\nor six state assemblies met at Annapolis, in Maryland, in 1786. This\r\nmeeting, not conceiving itself sufficiently authorised to go into the\r\nbusiness of a reform, did no more than state their general opinions of\r\nthe propriety of the measure, and recommend that a convention of all the\r\nstates should be held the year following.\r\n\r\nThe convention met at Philadelphia in May, 1787, of which General\r\nWashington was elected president. He was not at that time connected\r\nwith any of the state governments, or with congress. He delivered up\r\nhis commission when the war ended, and since then had lived a private\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nThe convention went deeply into all the subjects; and having, after a\r\nvariety of debate and investigation, agreed among themselves upon the\r\nseveral parts of a federal constitution, the next question was, the\r\nmanner of giving it authority and practice.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, send for a\r\nDutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector; but they referred the whole\r\nmatter to the sense and interest of the country.\r\n\r\nThey first directed that the proposed constitution should be published.\r\nSecondly, that each state should elect a convention, expressly for the\r\npurpose of taking it into consideration, and of ratifying or rejecting\r\nit; and that as soon as the approbation and ratification of any nine\r\nstates should be given, that those states shall proceed to the election\r\nof their proportion of members to the new federal government; and that\r\nthe operation of it should then begin, and the former federal government\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nThe several states proceeded accordingly to elect their conventions.\r\nSome of those conventions ratified the constitution by very large\r\nmajorities, and two or three unanimously. In others there were much\r\ndebate and division of opinion. In the Massachusetts convention, which\r\nmet at Boston, the majority was not above nineteen or twenty, in\r\nabout three hundred members; but such is the nature of representative\r\ngovernment, that it quietly decides all matters by majority. After the\r\ndebate in the Massachusetts convention was closed, and the vote taken,\r\nthe objecting members rose and declared, \"That though they had argued\r\nand voted against it, because certain parts appeared to them in a\r\ndifferent light to what they appeared to other members; yet, as the vote\r\nhad decided in favour of the constitution as proposed, they should give\r\nit the same practical support as if they had for it.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as nine states had concurred (and the rest followed in the\r\norder their conventions were elected), the old fabric of the federal\r\ngovernment was taken down, and the new one erected, of which General\r\nWashington is president.--In this place I cannot help remarking, that\r\nthe character and services of this gentleman are sufficient to put all\r\nthose men called kings to shame. While they are receiving from the sweat\r\nand labours of mankind, a prodigality of pay, to which neither their\r\nabilities nor their services can entitle them, he is rendering every\r\nservice in his power, and refusing every pecuniary reward. He accepted\r\nno pay as commander-in-chief; he accepts none as president of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAfter the new federal constitution was established, the state of\r\nPennsylvania, conceiving that some parts of its own constitution\r\nrequired to be altered, elected a convention for that purpose. The\r\nproposed alterations were published, and the people concurring therein,\r\nthey were established.\r\n\r\nIn forming those constitutions, or in altering them, little or no\r\ninconvenience took place. The ordinary course of things was not\r\ninterrupted, and the advantages have been much. It is always the\r\ninterest of a far greater number of people in a nation to have things\r\nright, than to let them remain wrong; and when public matters are open\r\nto debate, and the public judgment free, it will not decide wrong,\r\nunless it decides too hastily.\r\n\r\nIn the two instances of changing the constitutions, the governments then\r\nin being were not actors either way. Government has no right to make\r\nitself a party in any debate respecting the principles or modes of\r\nforming, or of changing, constitutions. It is not for the benefit of\r\nthose who exercise the powers of government that constitutions, and the\r\ngovernments issuing from them, are established. In all those matters the\r\nright of judging and acting are in those who pay, and not in those who\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\nA constitution is the property of a nation, and not of those who\r\nexercise the government. All the constitutions of America are declared\r\nto be established on the authority of the people. In France, the word\r\nnation is used instead of the people; but in both cases, a constitution\r\nis a thing antecedent to the government, and always distinct there from.\r\n\r\nIn England it is not difficult to perceive that everything has a\r\nconstitution, except the nation. Every society and association that is\r\nestablished, first agreed upon a number of original articles, digested\r\ninto form, which are its constitution. It then appointed its officers,\r\nwhose powers and authorities are described in that constitution, and the\r\ngovernment of that society then commenced. Those officers, by whatever\r\nname they are called, have no authority to add to, alter, or abridge the\r\noriginal articles. It is only to the constituting power that this right\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nFrom the want of understanding the difference between a constitution\r\nand a government, Dr. Johnson, and all writers of his description, have\r\nalways bewildered themselves. They could not but perceive, that there\r\nmust necessarily be a controlling power existing somewhere, and they\r\nplaced this power in the discretion of the persons exercising the\r\ngovernment, instead of placing it in a constitution formed by the\r\nnation. When it is in a constitution, it has the nation for its support,\r\nand the natural and the political controlling powers are together. The\r\nlaws which are enacted by governments, control men only as individuals,\r\nbut the nation, through its constitution, controls the whole government,\r\nand has a natural ability to do so. The final controlling power,\r\ntherefore, and the original constituting power, are one and the same\r\npower.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson could not have advanced such a position in any country where\r\nthere was a constitution; and he is himself an evidence that no such\r\nthing as a constitution exists in England. But it may be put as a\r\nquestion, not improper to be investigated, that if a constitution does\r\nnot exist, how came the idea of its existence so generally established?\r\n\r\nIn order to decide this question, it is necessary to consider a\r\nconstitution in both its cases:--First, as creating a government and\r\ngiving it powers. Secondly, as regulating and restraining the powers so\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIf we begin with William of Normandy, we find that the government of\r\nEngland was originally a tyranny, founded on an invasion and conquest of\r\nthe country. This being admitted, it will then appear, that the exertion\r\nof the nation, at different periods, to abate that tyranny, and render\r\nit less intolerable, has been credited for a constitution.\r\n\r\nMagna Charta, as it was called (it is now like an almanack of the same\r\ndate), was no more than compelling the government to renounce a part of\r\nits assumptions. It did not create and give powers to government in a\r\nmanner a constitution does; but was, as far as it went, of the nature of\r\na re-conquest, and not a constitution; for could the nation have totally\r\nexpelled the usurpation, as France has done its despotism, it would then\r\nhave had a constitution to form.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the commencement\r\nof the Stuarts, exhibits as many instances of tyranny as could be acted\r\nwithin the limits to which the nation had restricted it. The Stuarts\r\nendeavoured to pass those limits, and their fate is well known. In\r\nall those instances we see nothing of a constitution, but only of\r\nrestrictions on assumed power.\r\n\r\nAfter this, another William, descended from the same stock, and claiming\r\nfrom the same origin, gained possession; and of the two evils, James\r\nand William, the nation preferred what it thought the least; since, from\r\ncircumstances, it must take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights,\r\ncomes here into view. What is it, but a bargain, which the parts of\r\nthe government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and\r\nprivileges? You shall have so much, and I will have the rest; and with\r\nrespect to the nation, it said, for your share, You shall have the right\r\nof petitioning. This being the case, the bill of rights is more properly\r\na bill of wrongs, and of insult. As to what is called the convention\r\nparliament, it was a thing that made itself, and then made the authority\r\nby which it acted. A few persons got together, and called themselves by\r\nthat name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of William a species of government arose, issuing out\r\nof this coalition bill of rights; and more so, since the corruption\r\nintroduced at the Hanover succession by the agency of Walpole; that can\r\nbe described by no other name than a despotic legislation. Though the\r\nparts may embarrass each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only\r\nright it acknowledges out of itself, is the right of petitioning. Where\r\nthen is the constitution either that gives or restrains power?\r\n\r\nIt is not because a part of the government is elective, that makes it\r\nless a despotism, if the persons so elected possess afterwards, as a\r\nparliament, unlimited powers. Election, in this case, becomes separated\r\nfrom representation, and the candidates are candidates for despotism.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that any nation, reasoning on its own rights, would\r\nhave thought of calling these things a constitution, if the cry of\r\nconstitution had not been set up by the government. It has got into\r\ncirculation like the words bore and quoz [quiz], by being chalked up in\r\nthe speeches of parliament, as those words were on window shutters and\r\ndoorposts; but whatever the constitution may be in other respects, it\r\nhas undoubtedly been the most productive machine of taxation that was\r\never invented. The taxes in France, under the new constitution, are not\r\nquite thirteen shillings per head,*[18] and the taxes in England, under\r\nwhat is called its present constitution, are forty-eight shillings\r\nand sixpence per head--men, women, and children--amounting to nearly\r\nseventeen millions sterling, besides the expense of collecting, which is\r\nupwards of a million more.\r\n\r\nIn a country like England, where the whole of the civil Government is\r\nexecuted by the people of every town and county, by means of parish\r\nofficers, magistrates, quarterly sessions, juries, and assize; without\r\nany trouble to what is called the government or any other expense to the\r\nrevenue than the salary of the judges, it is astonishing how such a mass\r\nof taxes can be employed. Not even the internal defence of the country\r\nis paid out of the revenue. On all occasions, whether real or contrived,\r\nrecourse is continually had to new loans and new taxes. No wonder,\r\nthen, that a machine of government so advantageous to the advocates of\r\na court, should be so triumphantly extolled! No wonder, that St. James's\r\nor St. Stephen's should echo with the continual cry of constitution;\r\nno wonder, that the French revolution should be reprobated, and the\r\nres-publica treated with reproach! The red book of England, like the red\r\nbook of France, will explain the reason.*[19]\r\n\r\nI will now, by way of relaxation, turn a thought or two to Mr. Burke. I\r\nask his pardon for neglecting him so long.\r\n\r\n\"America,\" says he (in his speech on the Canada Constitution bill),\r\n\"never dreamed of such absurd doctrine as the Rights of Man.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burke is such a bold presumer, and advances his assertions and his\r\npremises with such a deficiency of judgment, that, without troubling\r\nourselves about principles of philosophy or politics, the mere logical\r\nconclusions they produce, are ridiculous. For instance,\r\n\r\nIf governments, as Mr. Burke asserts, are not founded on the Rights of\r\nMan, and are founded on any rights at all, they consequently must be\r\nfounded on the right of something that is not man. What then is that\r\nsomething?\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, we know of no other creatures that inhabit the\r\nearth than man and beast; and in all cases, where only two things offer\r\nthemselves, and one must be admitted, a negation proved on any one,\r\namounts to an affirmative on the other; and therefore, Mr. Burke, by\r\nproving against the Rights of Man, proves in behalf of the beast; and\r\nconsequently, proves that government is a beast; and as difficult things\r\nsometimes explain each other, we now see the origin of keeping wild\r\nbeasts in the Tower; for they certainly can be of no other use than\r\nto show the origin of the government. They are in the place of a\r\nconstitution. O John Bull, what honours thou hast lost by not being a\r\nwild beast. Thou mightest, on Mr. Burke's system, have been in the Tower\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Burke's arguments have not weight enough to keep one serious, the\r\nfault is less mine than his; and as I am willing to make an apology to\r\nthe reader for the liberty I have taken, I hope Mr. Burke will also make\r\nhis for giving the cause.\r\n\r\nHaving thus paid Mr. Burke the compliment of remembering him, I return\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nFrom the want of a constitution in England to restrain and regulate the\r\nwild impulse of power, many of the laws are irrational and tyrannical,\r\nand the administration of them vague and problematical.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the government of England (for I rather choose to\r\ncall it by this name than the English government) appears, since its\r\npolitical connection with Germany, to have been so completely engrossed\r\nand absorbed by foreign affairs, and the means of raising taxes, that it\r\nseems to exist for no other purposes. Domestic concerns are neglected;\r\nand with respect to regular law, there is scarcely such a thing.\r\n\r\nAlmost every case must now be determined by some precedent, be that\r\nprecedent good or bad, or whether it properly applies or not; and\r\nthe practice is become so general as to suggest a suspicion, that it\r\nproceeds from a deeper policy than at first sight appears.\r\n\r\nSince the revolution of America, and more so since that of France,\r\nthis preaching up the doctrines of precedents, drawn from times and\r\ncircumstances antecedent to those events, has been the studied practice\r\nof the English government. The generality of those precedents are\r\nfounded on principles and opinions, the reverse of what they ought; and\r\nthe greater distance of time they are drawn from, the more they are to\r\nbe suspected. But by associating those precedents with a superstitious\r\nreverence for ancient things, as monks show relics and call them holy,\r\nthe generality of mankind are deceived into the design. Governments now\r\nact as if they were afraid to awaken a single reflection in man. They\r\nare softly leading him to the sepulchre of precedents, to deaden his\r\nfaculties and call attention from the scene of revolutions. They feel\r\nthat he is arriving at knowledge faster than they wish, and their policy\r\nof precedents is the barometer of their fears. This political popery,\r\nlike the ecclesiastical popery of old, has had its day, and is hastening\r\nto its exit. The ragged relic and the antiquated precedent, the monk and\r\nthe monarch, will moulder together.\r\n\r\nGovernment by precedent, without any regard to the principle of the\r\nprecedent, is one of the vilest systems that can be set up. In numerous\r\ninstances, the precedent ought to operate as a warning, and not as an\r\nexample, and requires to be shunned instead of imitated; but instead of\r\nthis, precedents are taken in the lump, and put at once for constitution\r\nand for law.\r\n\r\nEither the doctrine of precedents is policy to keep a man in a state of\r\nignorance, or it is a practical confession that wisdom degenerates in\r\ngovernments as governments increase in age, and can only hobble along by\r\nthe stilts and crutches of precedents. How is it that the same persons\r\nwho would proudly be thought wiser than their predecessors, appear at\r\nthe same time only as the ghosts of departed wisdom? How strangely is\r\nantiquity treated! To some purposes it is spoken of as the times of\r\ndarkness and ignorance, and to answer others, it is put for the light of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine of precedents is to be followed, the expenses of\r\ngovernment need not continue the same. Why pay men extravagantly, who\r\nhave but little to do? If everything that can happen is already in\r\nprecedent, legislation is at an end, and precedent, like a dictionary,\r\ndetermines every case. Either, therefore, government has arrived at\r\nits dotage, and requires to be renovated, or all the occasions for\r\nexercising its wisdom have occurred.\r\n\r\nWe now see all over Europe, and particularly in England, the curious\r\nphenomenon of a nation looking one way, and the government the\r\nother--the one forward and the other backward. If governments are to go\r\non by precedent, while nations go on by improvement, they must at last\r\ncome to a final separation; and the sooner, and the more civilly they\r\ndetermine this point, the better.*[20]\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken of constitutions generally, as things distinct from\r\nactual governments, let us proceed to consider the parts of which a\r\nconstitution is composed.\r\n\r\nOpinions differ more on this subject than with respect to the whole.\r\nThat a nation ought to have a constitution, as a rule for the conduct\r\nof its government, is a simple question in which all men, not directly\r\ncourtiers, will agree. It is only on the component parts that questions\r\nand opinions multiply.\r\n\r\nBut this difficulty, like every other, will diminish when put into a\r\ntrain of being rightly understood.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is, that a nation has a right to establish a\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nWhether it exercises this right in the most judicious manner at first\r\nis quite another case. It exercises it agreeably to the judgment it\r\npossesses; and by continuing to do so, all errors will at last be\r\nexploded.\r\n\r\nWhen this right is established in a nation, there is no fear that it\r\nwill be employed to its own injury. A nation can have no interest in\r\nbeing wrong.\r\n\r\nThough all the constitutions of America are on one general principle,\r\nyet no two of them are exactly alike in their component parts, or in the\r\ndistribution of the powers which they give to the actual governments.\r\nSome are more, and others less complex.\r\n\r\nIn forming a constitution, it is first necessary to consider what are\r\nthe ends for which government is necessary? Secondly, what are the best\r\nmeans, and the least expensive, for accomplishing those ends?\r\n\r\nGovernment is nothing more than a national association; and the\r\nobject of this association is the good of all, as well individually as\r\ncollectively. Every man wishes to pursue his occupation, and to enjoy\r\nthe fruits of his labours and the produce of his property in peace\r\nand safety, and with the least possible expense. When these things\r\nare accomplished, all the objects for which government ought to be\r\nestablished are answered.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to consider government under three distinct\r\ngeneral heads. The legislative, the executive, and the judicial.\r\n\r\nBut if we permit our judgment to act unincumbered by the habit of\r\nmultiplied terms, we can perceive no more than two divisions of power,\r\nof which civil government is composed, namely, that of legislating or\r\nenacting laws, and that of executing or administering them. Everything,\r\ntherefore, appertaining to civil government, classes itself under one or\r\nother of these two divisions.\r\n\r\nSo far as regards the execution of the laws, that which is called the\r\njudicial power, is strictly and properly the executive power of every\r\ncountry. It is that power to which every individual has appeal, and\r\nwhich causes the laws to be executed; neither have we any other clear\r\nidea with respect to the official execution of the laws. In England, and\r\nalso in America and France, this power begins with the magistrate, and\r\nproceeds up through all the courts of judicature.\r\n\r\nI leave to courtiers to explain what is meant by calling monarchy the\r\nexecutive power. It is merely a name in which acts of government are\r\ndone; and any other, or none at all, would answer the same purpose. Laws\r\nhave neither more nor less authority on this account. It must be from\r\nthe justness of their principles, and the interest which a nation feels\r\ntherein, that they derive support; if they require any other than this,\r\nit is a sign that something in the system of government is imperfect.\r\nLaws difficult to be executed cannot be generally good.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the organization of the legislative power, different\r\nmodes have been adopted in different countries. In America it is\r\ngenerally composed of two houses. In France it consists but of one, but\r\nin both countries, it is wholly by representation.\r\n\r\nThe case is, that mankind (from the long tyranny of assumed power) have\r\nhad so few opportunities of making the necessary trials on modes and\r\nprinciples of government, in order to discover the best, that government\r\nis but now beginning to be known, and experience is yet wanting to\r\ndetermine many particulars.\r\n\r\nThe objections against two houses are, first, that there is an\r\ninconsistency in any part of a whole legislature, coming to a final\r\ndetermination by vote on any matter, whilst that matter, with respect\r\nto that whole, is yet only in a train of deliberation, and consequently\r\nopen to new illustrations.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That by taking the vote on each, as a separate body, it always\r\nadmits of the possibility, and is often the case in practice, that the\r\nminority governs the majority, and that, in some instances, to a degree\r\nof great inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That two houses arbitrarily checking or controlling each other\r\nis inconsistent; because it cannot be proved on the principles of just\r\nrepresentation, that either should be wiser or better than the other.\r\nThey may check in the wrong as well as in the right therefore to give\r\nthe power where we cannot give the wisdom to use it, nor be assured\r\nof its being rightly used, renders the hazard at least equal to the\r\nprecaution.*[21]\r\n\r\nThe objection against a single house is, that it is always in a\r\ncondition of committing itself too soon.--But it should at the same\r\ntime be remembered, that when there is a constitution which defines the\r\npower, and establishes the principles within which a legislature\r\nshall act, there is already a more effectual check provided, and more\r\npowerfully operating, than any other check can be. For example,\r\n\r\nWere a Bill to be brought into any of the American legislatures similar\r\nto that which was passed into an act by the English parliament, at\r\nthe commencement of George the First, to extend the duration of the\r\nassemblies to a longer period than they now sit, the check is in the\r\nconstitution, which in effect says, Thus far shalt thou go and no\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nBut in order to remove the objection against a single house (that of\r\nacting with too quick an impulse), and at the same time to avoid the\r\ninconsistencies, in some cases absurdities, arising from two houses, the\r\nfollowing method has been proposed as an improvement upon both.\r\n\r\nFirst, To have but one representation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, To divide that representation, by lot, into two or three\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That every proposed bill shall be first debated in those parts\r\nby succession, that they may become the hearers of each other, but\r\nwithout taking any vote. After which the whole representation to\r\nassemble for a general debate and determination by vote.\r\n\r\nTo this proposed improvement has been added another, for the purpose of\r\nkeeping the representation in the state of constant renovation; which\r\nis, that one-third of the representation of each county, shall go out at\r\nthe expiration of one year, and the number be replaced by new elections.\r\nAnother third at the expiration of the second year replaced in like\r\nmanner, and every third year to be a general election.*[22]\r\n\r\nBut in whatever manner the separate parts of a constitution may be\r\narranged, there is one general principle that distinguishes freedom from\r\nslavery, which is, that all hereditary government over a people is to\r\nthem a species of slavery, and representative government is freedom.\r\n\r\nConsidering government in the only light in which it should be\r\nconsidered, that of a National Association, it ought to be so\r\nconstructed as not to be disordered by any accident happening among the\r\nparts; and, therefore, no extraordinary power, capable of producing such\r\nan effect, should be lodged in the hands of any individual. The death,\r\nsickness, absence or defection, of any one individual in a government,\r\nought to be a matter of no more consequence, with respect to the nation,\r\nthan if the same circumstance had taken place in a member of the English\r\nParliament, or the French National Assembly.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything presents a more degrading character of national\r\ngreatness, than its being thrown into confusion, by anything happening\r\nto or acted by any individual; and the ridiculousness of the scene is\r\noften increased by the natural insignificance of the person by whom it\r\nis occasioned. Were a government so constructed, that it could not go on\r\nunless a goose or a gander were present in the senate, the difficulties\r\nwould be just as great and as real, on the flight or sickness of\r\nthe goose, or the gander, as if it were called a King. We laugh at\r\nindividuals for the silly difficulties they make to themselves, without\r\nperceiving that the greatest of all ridiculous things are acted in\r\ngovernments.*[23]\r\n\r\nAll the constitutions of America are on a plan that excludes the\r\nchildish embarrassments which occur in monarchical countries. No\r\nsuspension of government can there take place for a moment, from any\r\ncircumstances whatever. The system of representation provides for\r\neverything, and is the only system in which nations and governments can\r\nalways appear in their proper character.\r\n\r\nAs extraordinary power ought not to be lodged in the hands of any\r\nindividual, so ought there to be no appropriations of public money\r\nto any person, beyond what his services in a state may be worth. It\r\nsignifies not whether a man be called a president, a king, an emperor,\r\na senator, or by any other name which propriety or folly may devise or\r\narrogance assume; it is only a certain service he can perform in the\r\nstate; and the service of any such individual in the routine of office,\r\nwhether such office be called monarchical, presidential, senatorial, or\r\nby any other name or title, can never exceed the value of ten thousand\r\npounds a year. All the great services that are done in the world are\r\nperformed by volunteer characters, who accept nothing for them; but\r\nthe routine of office is always regulated to such a general standard\r\nof abilities as to be within the compass of numbers in every country\r\nto perform, and therefore cannot merit very extraordinary recompense.\r\nGovernment, says Swift, is a Plain thing, and fitted to the capacity of\r\nmany heads.\r\n\r\nIt is inhuman to talk of a million sterling a year, paid out of the\r\npublic taxes of any country, for the support of any individual, whilst\r\nthousands who are forced to contribute thereto, are pining with want,\r\nand struggling with misery. Government does not consist in a contrast\r\nbetween prisons and palaces, between poverty and pomp; it is not\r\ninstituted to rob the needy of his mite, and increase the wretchedness\r\nof the wretched.--But on this part of the subject I shall speak\r\nhereafter, and confine myself at present to political observations.\r\n\r\nWhen extraordinary power and extraordinary pay are allotted to any\r\nindividual in a government, he becomes the center, round which every\r\nkind of corruption generates and forms. Give to any man a million a\r\nyear, and add thereto the power of creating and disposing of places,\r\nat the expense of a country, and the liberties of that country are no\r\nlonger secure. What is called the splendour of a throne is no other\r\nthan the corruption of the state. It is made up of a band of parasites,\r\nliving in luxurious indolence, out of the public taxes.\r\n\r\nWhen once such a vicious system is established it becomes the guard and\r\nprotection of all inferior abuses. The man who is in the receipt of a\r\nmillion a year is the last person to promote a spirit of reform, lest,\r\nin the event, it should reach to himself. It is always his interest to\r\ndefend inferior abuses, as so many outworks to protect the citadel; and\r\non this species of political fortification, all the parts have such a\r\ncommon dependence that it is never to be expected they will attack each\r\nother.*[24]\r\n\r\nMonarchy would not have continued so many ages in the world, had it not\r\nbeen for the abuses it protects. It is the master-fraud, which shelters\r\nall others. By admitting a participation of the spoil, it makes itself\r\nfriends; and when it ceases to do this it will cease to be the idol of\r\ncourtiers.\r\n\r\nAs the principle on which constitutions are now formed rejects all\r\nhereditary pretensions to government, it also rejects all that catalogue\r\nof assumptions known by the name of prerogatives.\r\n\r\nIf there is any government where prerogatives might with apparent safety\r\nbe entrusted to any individual, it is in the federal government of\r\nAmerica. The president of the United States of America is elected only\r\nfor four years. He is not only responsible in the general sense of the\r\nword, but a particular mode is laid down in the constitution for trying\r\nhim. He cannot be elected under thirty-five years of age; and he must be\r\na native of the country.\r\n\r\nIn a comparison of these cases with the Government of England, the\r\ndifference when applied to the latter amounts to an absurdity. In\r\nEngland the person who exercises prerogative is often a foreigner;\r\nalways half a foreigner, and always married to a foreigner. He is\r\nnever in full natural or political connection with the country, is not\r\nresponsible for anything, and becomes of age at eighteen years; yet\r\nsuch a person is permitted to form foreign alliances, without even the\r\nknowledge of the nation, and to make war and peace without its consent.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Though such a person cannot dispose of the\r\ngovernment in the manner of a testator, he dictates the marriage\r\nconnections, which, in effect, accomplish a great part of the same end.\r\nHe cannot directly bequeath half the government to Prussia, but he can\r\nform a marriage partnership that will produce almost the same thing.\r\nUnder such circumstances, it is happy for England that she is not\r\nsituated on the Continent, or she might, like Holland, fall under\r\nthe dictatorship of Prussia. Holland, by marriage, is as effectually\r\ngoverned by Prussia, as if the old tyranny of bequeathing the government\r\nhad been the means.\r\n\r\nThe presidency in America (or, as it is sometimes called, the executive)\r\nis the only office from which a foreigner is excluded, and in England it\r\nis the only one to which he is admitted. A foreigner cannot be a member\r\nof Parliament, but he may be what is called a king. If there is any\r\nreason for excluding foreigners, it ought to be from those offices where\r\nmischief can most be acted, and where, by uniting every bias of interest\r\nand attachment, the trust is best secured. But as nations proceed in\r\nthe great business of forming constitutions, they will examine with\r\nmore precision into the nature and business of that department which is\r\ncalled the executive. What the legislative and judicial departments are\r\nevery one can see; but with respect to what, in Europe, is called\r\nthe executive, as distinct from those two, it is either a political\r\nsuperfluity or a chaos of unknown things.\r\n\r\nSome kind of official department, to which reports shall be made from\r\nthe different parts of a nation, or from abroad, to be laid before the\r\nnational representatives, is all that is necessary; but there is no\r\nconsistency in calling this the executive; neither can it be considered\r\nin any other light than as inferior to the legislative. The sovereign\r\nauthority in any country is the power of making laws, and everything\r\nelse is an official department.\r\n\r\nNext to the arrangement of the principles and the organization of the\r\nseveral parts of a constitution, is the provision to be made for\r\nthe support of the persons to whom the nation shall confide the\r\nadministration of the constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nA nation can have no right to the time and services of any person at his\r\nown expense, whom it may choose to employ or entrust in any department\r\nwhatever; neither can any reason be given for making provision for the\r\nsupport of any one part of a government and not for the other.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that the honour of being entrusted with any part of a\r\ngovernment is to be considered a sufficient reward, it ought to be so to\r\nevery person alike. If the members of the legislature of any country\r\nare to serve at their own expense that which is called the executive,\r\nwhether monarchical or by any other name, ought to serve in like manner.\r\nIt is inconsistent to pay the one, and accept the service of the other\r\ngratis.\r\n\r\nIn America, every department in the government is decently provided for;\r\nbut no one is extravagantly paid. Every member of Congress, and of\r\nthe Assemblies, is allowed a sufficiency for his expenses. Whereas in\r\nEngland, a most prodigal provision is made for the support of one part\r\nof the Government, and none for the other, the consequence of which is\r\nthat the one is furnished with the means of corruption and the other is\r\nput into the condition of being corrupted. Less than a fourth part of\r\nsuch expense, applied as it is in America, would remedy a great part of\r\nthe corruption.\r\n\r\nAnother reform in the American constitution is the exploding all oaths\r\nof personality. The oath of allegiance in America is to the nation only.\r\nThe putting any individual as a figure for a nation is improper.\r\nThe happiness of a nation is the superior object, and therefore the\r\nintention of an oath of allegiance ought not to be obscured by being\r\nfiguratively taken, to, or in the name of, any person. The oath, called\r\nthe civic oath, in France, viz., \"the nation, the law, and the king,\" is\r\nimproper. If taken at all, it ought to be as in America, to the nation\r\nonly. The law may or may not be good; but, in this place, it can have no\r\nother meaning, than as being conducive to the happiness of a nation, and\r\ntherefore is included in it. The remainder of the oath is improper, on\r\nthe ground, that all personal oaths ought to be abolished. They are the\r\nremains of tyranny on one part and slavery on the other; and the name of\r\nthe Creator ought not to be introduced to witness the degradation of\r\nhis creation; or if taken, as is already mentioned, as figurative of the\r\nnation, it is in this place redundant. But whatever apology may be made\r\nfor oaths at the first establishment of a government, they ought not to\r\nbe permitted afterwards. If a government requires the support of oaths,\r\nit is a sign that it is not worth supporting, and ought not to be\r\nsupported. Make government what it ought to be, and it will support\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this part of the subject:--One of the greatest improvements\r\nthat have been made for the perpetual security and progress of\r\nconstitutional liberty, is the provision which the new constitutions\r\nmake for occasionally revising, altering, and amending them.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which Mr. Burke formed his political creed, that of\r\n\"binding and controlling posterity to the end of time, and of renouncing\r\nand abdicating the rights of all posterity, for ever,\" is now become too\r\ndetestable to be made a subject of debate; and therefore, I pass it over\r\nwith no other notice than exposing it.\r\n\r\nGovernment is but now beginning to be known. Hitherto it has been the\r\nmere exercise of power, which forbade all effectual enquiry into rights,\r\nand grounded itself wholly on possession. While the enemy of liberty was\r\nits judge, the progress of its principles must have been small indeed.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of America, and also that of France, have either\r\naffixed a period for their revision, or laid down the mode by which\r\nimprovement shall be made. It is perhaps impossible to establish\r\nanything that combines principles with opinions and practice, which the\r\nprogress of circumstances, through a length of years, will not in some\r\nmeasure derange, or render inconsistent; and, therefore, to prevent\r\ninconveniences accumulating, till they discourage reformations or\r\nprovoke revolutions, it is best to provide the means of regulating them\r\nas they occur. The Rights of Man are the rights of all generations of\r\nmen, and cannot be monopolised by any. That which is worth following,\r\nwill be followed for the sake of its worth, and it is in this that\r\nits security lies, and not in any conditions with which it may be\r\nencumbered. When a man leaves property to his heirs, he does not connect\r\nit with an obligation that they shall accept it. Why, then, should we\r\ndo otherwise with respect to constitutions? The best constitution that\r\ncould now be devised, consistent with the condition of the present\r\nmoment, may be far short of that excellence which a few years may\r\nafford. There is a morning of reason rising upon man on the subject\r\nof government, that has not appeared before. As the barbarism of the\r\npresent old governments expires, the moral conditions of nations with\r\nrespect to each other will be changed. Man will not be brought up with\r\nthe savage idea of considering his species as his enemy, because\r\nthe accident of birth gave the individuals existence in countries\r\ndistinguished by different names; and as constitutions have always some\r\nrelation to external as well as to domestic circumstances, the means of\r\nbenefitting by every change, foreign or domestic, should be a part\r\nof every constitution. We already see an alteration in the national\r\ndisposition of England and France towards each other, which, when we\r\nlook back to only a few years, is itself a Revolution. Who could have\r\nforeseen, or who could have believed, that a French National Assembly\r\nwould ever have been a popular toast in England, or that a friendly\r\nalliance of the two nations should become the wish of either? It shows\r\nthat man, were he not corrupted by governments, is naturally the friend\r\nof man, and that human nature is not of itself vicious. That spirit\r\nof jealousy and ferocity, which the governments of the two countries\r\ninspired, and which they rendered subservient to the purpose of\r\ntaxation, is now yielding to the dictates of reason, interest, and\r\nhumanity. The trade of courts is beginning to be understood, and the\r\naffectation of mystery, with all the artificial sorcery by which\r\nthey imposed upon mankind, is on the decline. It has received its\r\ndeath-wound; and though it may linger, it will expire. Government ought\r\nto be as much open to improvement as anything which appertains to man,\r\ninstead of which it has been monopolised from age to age, by the most\r\nignorant and vicious of the human race. Need we any other proof of their\r\nwretched management, than the excess of debts and taxes with which every\r\nnation groans, and the quarrels into which they have precipitated the\r\nworld? Just emerging from such a barbarous condition, it is too soon to\r\ndetermine to what extent of improvement government may yet be carried.\r\nFor what we can foresee, all Europe may form but one great Republic, and\r\nman be free of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. WAYS AND MEANS OF IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF EUROPE\r\n\r\nINTERSPERSED WITH MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\nIn contemplating a subject that embraces with equatorial magnitude the\r\nwhole region of humanity it is impossible to confine the pursuit in one\r\nsingle direction. It takes ground on every character and condition that\r\nappertains to man, and blends the individual, the nation, and the world.\r\nFrom a small spark, kindled in America, a flame has arisen not to be\r\nextinguished. Without consuming, like the Ultima Ratio Regum, it winds\r\nits progress from nation to nation, and conquers by a silent operation.\r\nMan finds himself changed, he scarcely perceives how. He acquires\r\na knowledge of his rights by attending justly to his interest, and\r\ndiscovers in the event that the strength and powers of despotism consist\r\nwholly in the fear of resisting it, and that, in order \"to be free, it\r\nis sufficient that he wills it.\"\r\n\r\nHaving in all the preceding parts of this work endeavoured to establish\r\na system of principles as a basis on which governments ought to be\r\nerected, I shall proceed in this, to the ways and means of rendering\r\nthem into practice. But in order to introduce this part of the subject\r\nwith more propriety, and stronger effect, some preliminary observations,\r\ndeducible from, or connected with, those principles, are necessary.\r\n\r\nWhatever the form or constitution of government may be, it ought to have\r\nno other object than the general happiness. When, instead of this, it\r\noperates to create and increase wretchedness in any of the parts\r\nof society, it is on a wrong system, and reformation is necessary.\r\nCustomary language has classed the condition of man under the two\r\ndescriptions of civilised and uncivilised life. To the one it has\r\nascribed felicity and affluence; to the other hardship and want. But,\r\nhowever our imagination may be impressed by painting and comparison,\r\nit is nevertheless true, that a great portion of mankind, in what are\r\ncalled civilised countries, are in a state of poverty and wretchedness,\r\nfar below the condition of an Indian. I speak not of one country, but of\r\nall. It is so in England, it is so all over Europe. Let us enquire into\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nIt lies not in any natural defect in the principles of civilisation,\r\nbut in preventing those principles having a universal operation; the\r\nconsequence of which is, a perpetual system of war and expense,\r\nthat drains the country, and defeats the general felicity of which\r\ncivilisation is capable. All the European governments (France\r\nnow excepted) are constructed not on the principle of universal\r\ncivilisation, but on the reverse of it. So far as those governments\r\nrelate to each other, they are in the same condition as we conceive of\r\nsavage uncivilised life; they put themselves beyond the law as well\r\nof God as of man, and are, with respect to principle and reciprocal\r\nconduct, like so many individuals in a state of nature. The inhabitants\r\nof every country, under the civilisation of laws, easily civilise\r\ntogether, but governments being yet in an uncivilised state, and almost\r\ncontinually at war, they pervert the abundance which civilised life\r\nproduces to carry on the uncivilised part to a greater extent. By thus\r\nengrafting the barbarism of government upon the internal civilisation of\r\na country, it draws from the latter, and more especially from the poor,\r\na great portion of those earnings, which should be applied to their\r\nown subsistence and comfort. Apart from all reflections of morality and\r\nphilosophy, it is a melancholy fact that more than one-fourth of the\r\nlabour of mankind is annually consumed by this barbarous system. What\r\nhas served to continue this evil, is the pecuniary advantage which\r\nall the governments of Europe have found in keeping up this state of\r\nuncivilisation. It affords to them pretences for power, and revenue,\r\nfor which there would be neither occasion nor apology, if the circle\r\nof civilisation were rendered complete. Civil government alone, or the\r\ngovernment of laws, is not productive of pretences for many taxes; it\r\noperates at home, directly under the eye of the country, and precludes\r\nthe possibility of much imposition. But when the scene is laid in\r\nthe uncivilised contention of governments, the field of pretences is\r\nenlarged, and the country, being no longer a judge, is open to every\r\nimposition, which governments please to act. Not a thirtieth, scarcely\r\na fortieth, part of the taxes which are raised in England are either\r\noccasioned by, or applied to, the purpose of civil government. It is\r\nnot difficult to see, that the whole which the actual government does\r\nin this respect, is to enact laws, and that the country administers\r\nand executes them, at its own expense, by means of magistrates, juries,\r\nsessions, and assize, over and above the taxes which it pays. In this\r\nview of the case, we have two distinct characters of government; the one\r\nthe civil government, or the government of laws, which operates at home,\r\nthe other the court or cabinet government, which operates abroad, on the\r\nrude plan of uncivilised life; the one attended with little charge, the\r\nother with boundless extravagance; and so distinct are the two, that if\r\nthe latter were to sink, as it were, by a sudden opening of the earth,\r\nand totally disappear, the former would not be deranged. It would still\r\nproceed, because it is the common interest of the nation that it should,\r\nand all the means are in practice. Revolutions, then, have for their\r\nobject a change in the moral condition of governments, and with this\r\nchange the burthen of public taxes will lessen, and civilisation will be\r\nleft to the enjoyment of that abundance, of which it is now deprived.\r\nIn contemplating the whole of this subject, I extend my views into the\r\ndepartment of commerce. In all my publications, where the matter would\r\nadmit, I have been an advocate for commerce, because I am a friend to\r\nits effects. It is a pacific system, operating to cordialise mankind, by\r\nrendering nations, as well as individuals, useful to each other. As to\r\nthe mere theoretical reformation, I have never preached it up. The most\r\neffectual process is that of improving the condition of man by means of\r\nhis interest; and it is on this ground that I take my stand. If commerce\r\nwere permitted to act to the universal extent it is capable, it would\r\nextirpate the system of war, and produce a revolution in the uncivilised\r\nstate of governments. The invention of commerce has arisen since those\r\ngovernments began, and is the greatest approach towards universal\r\ncivilisation that has yet been made by any means not immediately flowing\r\nfrom moral principles. Whatever has a tendency to promote the civil\r\nintercourse of nations by an exchange of benefits, is a subject as\r\nworthy of philosophy as of politics. Commerce is no other than the\r\ntraffic of two individuals, multiplied on a scale of numbers; and by the\r\nsame rule that nature intended for the intercourse of two, she intended\r\nthat of all. For this purpose she has distributed the materials of\r\nmanufactures and commerce, in various and distant parts of a nation and\r\nof the world; and as they cannot be procured by war so cheaply or so\r\ncommodiously as by commerce, she has rendered the latter the means\r\nof extirpating the former. As the two are nearly the opposite of each\r\nother, consequently, the uncivilised state of the European governments\r\nis injurious to commerce. Every kind of destruction or embarrassment\r\nserves to lessen the quantity, and it matters but little in what part\r\nof the commercial world the reduction begins. Like blood, it cannot be\r\ntaken from any of the parts, without being taken from the whole mass in\r\ncirculation, and all partake of the loss. When the ability in any\r\nnation to buy is destroyed, it equally involves the seller. Could the\r\ngovernment of England destroy the commerce of all other nations, she\r\nwould most effectually ruin her own. It is possible that a nation may be\r\nthe carrier for the world, but she cannot be the merchant. She cannot\r\nbe the seller and buyer of her own merchandise. The ability to buy must\r\nreside out of herself; and, therefore, the prosperity of any commercial\r\nnation is regulated by the prosperity of the rest. If they are poor she\r\ncannot be rich, and her condition, be what it may, is an index of the\r\nheight of the commercial tide in other nations. That the principles\r\nof commerce, and its universal operation may be understood, without\r\nunderstanding the practice, is a position that reason will not deny; and\r\nit is on this ground only that I argue the subject. It is one thing\r\nin the counting-house, in the world it is another. With respect to its\r\noperation it must necessarily be contemplated as a reciprocal thing;\r\nthat only one-half its powers resides within the nation, and that\r\nthe whole is as effectually destroyed by the destroying the half that\r\nresides without, as if the destruction had been committed on that which\r\nis within; for neither can act without the other. When in the last, as\r\nwell as in former wars, the commerce of England sunk, it was because the\r\nquantity was lessened everywhere; and it now rises, because commerce is\r\nin a rising state in every nation. If England, at this day, imports\r\nand exports more than at any former period, the nations with which she\r\ntrades must necessarily do the same; her imports are their exports, and\r\nvice versa. There can be no such thing as a nation flourishing alone\r\nin commerce: she can only participate; and the destruction of it in any\r\npart must necessarily affect all. When, therefore, governments are\r\nat war, the attack is made upon a common stock of commerce, and the\r\nconsequence is the same as if each had attacked his own. The present\r\nincrease of commerce is not to be attributed to ministers, or to any\r\npolitical contrivances, but to its own natural operation in consequence\r\nof peace. The regular markets had been destroyed, the channels of trade\r\nbroken up, the high road of the seas infested with robbers of every\r\nnation, and the attention of the world called to other objects. Those\r\ninterruptions have ceased, and peace has restored the deranged condition\r\nof things to their proper order.*[25] It is worth remarking that every\r\nnation reckons the balance of trade in its own favour; and therefore\r\nsomething must be irregular in the common ideas upon this subject. The\r\nfact, however, is true, according to what is called a balance; and it\r\nis from this cause that commerce is universally supported. Every nation\r\nfeels the advantage, or it would abandon the practice: but the deception\r\nlies in the mode of making up the accounts, and in attributing what are\r\ncalled profits to a wrong cause. Mr. Pitt has sometimes amused himself,\r\nby showing what he called a balance of trade from the custom-house\r\nbooks. This mode of calculating not only affords no rule that is true,\r\nbut one that is false. In the first place, Every cargo that departs from\r\nthe custom-house appears on the books as an export; and, according to\r\nthe custom-house balance, the losses at sea, and by foreign failures,\r\nare all reckoned on the side of profit because they appear as exports.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because the importation by the smuggling trade does not appear\r\non the custom-house books, to arrange against the exports.\r\n\r\nNo balance, therefore, as applying to superior advantages, can be\r\ndrawn from these documents; and if we examine the natural operation of\r\ncommerce, the idea is fallacious; and if true, would soon be injurious.\r\nThe great support of commerce consists in the balance being a level of\r\nbenefits among all nations.\r\n\r\nTwo merchants of different nations trading together, will both become\r\nrich, and each makes the balance in his own favour; consequently, they\r\ndo not get rich of each other; and it is the same with respect to the\r\nnations in which they reside. The case must be, that each nation must\r\nget rich out of its own means, and increases that riches by something\r\nwhich it procures from another in exchange.\r\n\r\nIf a merchant in England sends an article of English manufacture abroad\r\nwhich costs him a shilling at home, and imports something which sells\r\nfor two, he makes a balance of one shilling in his favour; but this is\r\nnot gained out of the foreign nation or the foreign merchant, for he\r\nalso does the same by the articles he receives, and neither has the\r\nadvantage upon the other. The original value of the two articles in\r\ntheir proper countries was but two shillings; but by changing their\r\nplaces, they acquire a new idea of value, equal to double what they had\r\nfirst, and that increased value is equally divided.\r\n\r\nThere is no otherwise a balance on foreign than on domestic commerce.\r\nThe merchants of London and Newcastle trade on the same principles, as\r\nif they resided in different nations, and make their balances in the\r\nsame manner: yet London does not get rich out of Newcastle, any more\r\nthan Newcastle out of London: but coals, the merchandize of Newcastle,\r\nhave an additional value at London, and London merchandize has the same\r\nat Newcastle.\r\n\r\nThough the principle of all commerce is the same, the domestic, in a\r\nnational view, is the part the most beneficial; because the whole of the\r\nadvantages, an both sides, rests within the nation; whereas, in foreign\r\ncommerce, it is only a participation of one-half.\r\n\r\nThe most unprofitable of all commerce is that connected with foreign\r\ndominion. To a few individuals it may be beneficial, merely because it\r\nis commerce; but to the nation it is a loss. The expense of maintaining\r\ndominion more than absorbs the profits of any trade. It does not\r\nincrease the general quantity in the world, but operates to lessen it;\r\nand as a greater mass would be afloat by relinquishing dominion, the\r\nparticipation without the expense would be more valuable than a greater\r\nquantity with it.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to engross commerce by dominion; and therefore\r\nit is still more fallacious. It cannot exist in confined channels, and\r\nnecessarily breaks out by regular or irregular means, that defeat\r\nthe attempt: and to succeed would be still worse. France, since the\r\nRevolution, has been more indifferent as to foreign possessions, and\r\nother nations will become the same when they investigate the subject\r\nwith respect to commerce.\r\n\r\nTo the expense of dominion is to be added that of navies, and when the\r\namounts of the two are subtracted from the profits of commerce, it will\r\nappear, that what is called the balance of trade, even admitting it to\r\nexist, is not enjoyed by the nation, but absorbed by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe idea of having navies for the protection of commerce is delusive.\r\nIt is putting means of destruction for the means of protection. Commerce\r\nneeds no other protection than the reciprocal interest which every\r\nnation feels in supporting it--it is common stock--it exists by a\r\nbalance of advantages to all; and the only interruption it meets, is\r\nfrom the present uncivilised state of governments, and which it is its\r\ncommon interest to reform.*[26]\r\n\r\nQuitting this subject, I now proceed to other matters.--As it is\r\nnecessary to include England in the prospect of a general reformation,\r\nit is proper to inquire into the defects of its government. It is only\r\nby each nation reforming its own, that the whole can be improved, and\r\nthe full benefit of reformation enjoyed. Only partial advantages can\r\nflow from partial reforms.\r\n\r\nFrance and England are the only two countries in Europe where a\r\nreformation in government could have successfully begun. The one secure\r\nby the ocean, and the other by the immensity of its internal strength,\r\ncould defy the malignancy of foreign despotism. But it is with\r\nrevolutions as with commerce, the advantages increase by their becoming\r\ngeneral, and double to either what each would receive alone.\r\n\r\nAs a new system is now opening to the view of the world, the European\r\ncourts are plotting to counteract it. Alliances, contrary to all former\r\nsystems, are agitating, and a common interest of courts is forming\r\nagainst the common interest of man. This combination draws a line that\r\nruns throughout Europe, and presents a cause so entirely new as to\r\nexclude all calculations from former circumstances. While despotism\r\nwarred with despotism, man had no interest in the contest; but in a\r\ncause that unites the soldier with the citizen, and nation with nation,\r\nthe despotism of courts, though it feels the danger and meditates\r\nrevenge, is afraid to strike.\r\n\r\nNo question has arisen within the records of history that pressed with\r\nthe importance of the present. It is not whether this or that party\r\nshall be in or not, or Whig or Tory, high or low shall prevail; but\r\nwhether man shall inherit his rights, and universal civilisation take\r\nplace? Whether the fruits of his labours shall be enjoyed by himself\r\nor consumed by the profligacy of governments? Whether robbery shall be\r\nbanished from courts, and wretchedness from countries?\r\n\r\nWhen, in countries that are called civilised, we see age going to the\r\nworkhouse and youth to the gallows, something must be wrong in the\r\nsystem of government. It would seem, by the exterior appearance of such\r\ncountries, that all was happiness; but there lies hidden from the eye of\r\ncommon observation, a mass of wretchedness, that has scarcely any other\r\nchance, than to expire in poverty or infamy. Its entrance into life is\r\nmarked with the presage of its fate; and until this is remedied, it is\r\nin vain to punish.\r\n\r\nCivil government does not exist in executions; but in making such\r\nprovision for the instruction of youth and the support of age, as to\r\nexclude, as much as possible, profligacy from the one and despair from\r\nthe other. Instead of this, the resources of a country are lavished upon\r\nkings, upon courts, upon hirelings, impostors and prostitutes; and even\r\nthe poor themselves, with all their wants upon them, are compelled to\r\nsupport the fraud that oppresses them.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that scarcely any are executed but the poor? The fact is a\r\nproof, among other things, of a wretchedness in their condition. Bred up\r\nwithout morals, and cast upon the world without a prospect, they are\r\nthe exposed sacrifice of vice and legal barbarity. The millions that are\r\nsuperfluously wasted upon governments are more than sufficient to reform\r\nthose evils, and to benefit the condition of every man in a nation, not\r\nincluded within the purlieus of a court. This I hope to make appear in\r\nthe progress of this work.\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of compassion to associate with misfortune. In taking\r\nup this subject I seek no recompense--I fear no consequence. Fortified\r\nwith that proud integrity, that disdains to triumph or to yield, I will\r\nadvocate the Rights of Man.\r\n\r\nIt is to my advantage that I have served an apprenticeship to life. I\r\nknow the value of moral instruction, and I have seen the danger of the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nAt an early period--little more than sixteen years of age, raw and\r\nadventurous, and heated with the false heroism of a master*[27] who\r\nhad served in a man-of-war--I began the carver of my own fortune,\r\nand entered on board the Terrible Privateer, Captain Death. From\r\nthis adventure I was happily prevented by the affectionate and moral\r\nremonstrance of a good father, who, from his own habits of life, being\r\nof the Quaker profession, must begin to look upon me as lost. But the\r\nimpression, much as it effected at the time, began to wear away, and I\r\nentered afterwards in the King of Prussia Privateer, Captain Mendez,\r\nand went with her to sea. Yet, from such a beginning, and with all the\r\ninconvenience of early life against me, I am proud to say, that with\r\na perseverance undismayed by difficulties, a disinterestedness that\r\ncompelled respect, I have not only contributed to raise a new empire in\r\nthe world, founded on a new system of government, but I have arrived at\r\nan eminence in political literature, the most difficult of all lines to\r\nsucceed and excel in, which aristocracy with all its aids has not been\r\nable to reach or to rival.*[28]\r\n\r\nKnowing my own heart and feeling myself as I now do, superior to all the\r\nskirmish of party, the inveteracy of interested or mistaken opponents,\r\nI answer not to falsehood or abuse, but proceed to the defects of the\r\nEnglish Government.\r\n\r\nI begin with charters and corporations.\r\n\r\nIt is a perversion of terms to say that a charter gives rights. It\r\noperates by a contrary effect--that of taking rights away. Rights are\r\ninherently in all the inhabitants; but charters, by annulling those\r\nrights, in the majority, leave the right, by exclusion, in the hands of\r\na few. If charters were constructed so as to express in direct terms,\r\n\"that every inhabitant, who is not a member of a corporation, shall\r\nnot exercise the right of voting,\" such charters would, in the face, be\r\ncharters not of rights, but of exclusion. The effect is the same under\r\nthe form they now stand; and the only persons on whom they operate are\r\nthe persons whom they exclude. Those whose rights are guaranteed, by\r\nnot being taken away, exercise no other rights than as members of the\r\ncommunity they are entitled to without a charter; and, therefore, all\r\ncharters have no other than an indirect negative operation. They do not\r\ngive rights to A, but they make a difference in favour of A by taking\r\naway the right of B, and consequently are instruments of injustice.\r\n\r\nBut charters and corporations have a more extensive evil effect\r\nthan what relates merely to elections. They are sources of endless\r\ncontentions in the places where they exist, and they lessen the common\r\nrights of national society. A native of England, under the operation of\r\nthese charters and corporations, cannot be said to be an Englishman in\r\nthe full sense of the word. He is not free of the nation, in the same\r\nmanner that a Frenchman is free of France, and an American of America.\r\nHis rights are circumscribed to the town, and, in some cases, to the\r\nparish of his birth; and all other parts, though in his native land, are\r\nto him as a foreign country. To acquire a residence in these, he must\r\nundergo a local naturalisation by purchase, or he is forbidden or\r\nexpelled the place. This species of feudality is kept up to aggrandise\r\nthe corporations at the ruin of towns; and the effect is visible.\r\n\r\nThe generality of corporation towns are in a state of solitary decay,\r\nand prevented from further ruin only by some circumstance in their\r\nsituation, such as a navigable river, or a plentiful surrounding\r\ncountry. As population is one of the chief sources of wealth (for\r\nwithout it land itself has no value), everything which operates to\r\nprevent it must lessen the value of property; and as corporations have\r\nnot only this tendency, but directly this effect, they cannot but be\r\ninjurious. If any policy were to be followed, instead of that of general\r\nfreedom, to every person to settle where he chose (as in France or\r\nAmerica) it would be more consistent to give encouragement to new comers\r\nthan to preclude their admission by exacting premiums from them.*[29]\r\n\r\nThe persons most immediately interested in the abolition of corporations\r\nare the inhabitants of the towns where corporations are established. The\r\ninstances of Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield show, by contrast,\r\nthe injuries which those Gothic institutions are to property and\r\ncommerce. A few examples may be found, such as that of London, whose\r\nnatural and commercial advantage, owing to its situation on the Thames,\r\nis capable of bearing up against the political evils of a corporation;\r\nbut in almost all other cases the fatality is too visible to be doubted\r\nor denied.\r\n\r\nThough the whole nation is not so directly affected by the depression of\r\nproperty in corporation towns as the inhabitants themselves, it partakes\r\nof the consequence. By lessening the value of property, the quantity of\r\nnational commerce is curtailed. Every man is a customer in proportion\r\nto his ability; and as all parts of a nation trade with each other,\r\nwhatever affects any of the parts must necessarily communicate to the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nAs one of the Houses of the English Parliament is, in a great measure,\r\nmade up of elections from these corporations; and as it is unnatural\r\nthat a pure stream should flow from a foul fountain, its vices are but a\r\ncontinuation of the vices of its origin. A man of moral honour and good\r\npolitical principles cannot submit to the mean drudgery and disgraceful\r\narts, by which such elections are carried. To be a successful candidate,\r\nhe must be destitute of the qualities that constitute a just legislator;\r\nand being thus disciplined to corruption by the mode of entering into\r\nParliament, it is not to be expected that the representative should be\r\nbetter than the man.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, in speaking of the English representation, has advanced\r\nas bold a challenge as ever was given in the days of chivalry. \"Our\r\nrepresentation,\" says he, \"has been found perfectly adequate to all\r\nthe purposes for which a representation of the people can be desired or\r\ndevised.\" \"I defy,\" continues he, \"the enemies of our constitution\r\nto show the contrary.\"--This declaration from a man who has been in\r\nconstant opposition to all the measures of parliament the whole of his\r\npolitical life, a year or two excepted, is most extraordinary; and,\r\ncomparing him with himself, admits of no other alternative, than that he\r\nacted against his judgment as a member, or has declared contrary to it\r\nas an author.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in the representation only that the defects lie, and\r\ntherefore I proceed in the next place to the aristocracy.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the House of Peers, is constituted on a ground very\r\nsimilar to that, against which there is no law in other cases. It\r\namounts to a combination of persons in one common interest. No better\r\nreason can be given, why a house of legislation should be composed\r\nentirely of men whose occupation consists in letting landed property,\r\nthan why it should be composed of those who hire, or of brewers, or\r\nbakers, or any other separate class of men. Mr. Burke calls this house\r\n\"the great ground and pillar of security to the landed interest.\" Let us\r\nexamine this idea.\r\n\r\nWhat pillar of security does the landed interest require more than any\r\nother interest in the state, or what right has it to a distinct and\r\nseparate representation from the general interest of a nation? The only\r\nuse to be made of this power (and which it always has made), is to ward\r\noff taxes from itself, and throw the burthen upon those articles of\r\nconsumption by which itself would be least affected.\r\n\r\nThat this has been the consequence (and will always be the consequence)\r\nof constructing governments on combinations, is evident with respect to\r\nEngland, from the history of its taxes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding taxes have increased and multiplied upon every article\r\nof common consumption, the land-tax, which more particularly affects\r\nthis \"pillar,\" has diminished. In 1778 the amount of the land-tax was\r\nL1,950,000, which is half-a-million less than it produced almost\r\na hundred years ago,*[30] notwithstanding the rentals are in many\r\ninstances doubled since that period.\r\n\r\nBefore the coming of the Hanoverians, the taxes were divided in nearly\r\nequal proportions between the land and articles of consumption, the land\r\nbearing rather the largest share: but since that era nearly thirteen\r\nmillions annually of new taxes have been thrown upon consumption. The\r\nconsequence of which has been a constant increase in the number and\r\nwretchedness of the poor, and in the amount of the poor-rates. Yet here\r\nagain the burthen does not fall in equal proportions on the aristocracy\r\nwith the rest of the community. Their residences, whether in town or\r\ncountry, are not mixed with the habitations of the poor. They live apart\r\nfrom distress, and the expense of relieving it. It is in manufacturing\r\ntowns and labouring villages that those burthens press the heaviest; in\r\nmany of which it is one class of poor supporting another.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the most heavy and productive taxes are so contrived, as to\r\ngive an exemption to this pillar, thus standing in its own defence. The\r\ntax upon beer brewed for sale does not affect the aristocracy, who brew\r\ntheir own beer free from this duty. It falls only on those who have\r\nnot conveniency or ability to brew, and who must purchase it in small\r\nquantities. But what will mankind think of the justice of taxation,\r\nwhen they know that this tax alone, from which the aristocracy are from\r\ncircumstances exempt, is nearly equal to the whole of the land-tax,\r\nbeing in the year 1788, and it is not less now, L1,666,152, and with its\r\nproportion of the taxes on malt and hops, it exceeds it.--That a single\r\narticle, thus partially consumed, and that chiefly by the working part,\r\nshould be subject to a tax, equal to that on the whole rental of a\r\nnation, is, perhaps, a fact not to be paralleled in the histories of\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the circumstances resulting from a house of legislation,\r\ncomposed on the ground of a combination of common interest; for whatever\r\ntheir separate politics as to parties may be, in this they are united.\r\nWhether a combination acts to raise the price of any article for sale,\r\nor rate of wages; or whether it acts to throw taxes from itself upon\r\nanother class of the community, the principle and the effect are the\r\nsame; and if the one be illegal, it will be difficult to show that the\r\nother ought to exist.\r\n\r\nIt is no use to say that taxes are first proposed in the House of\r\nCommons; for as the other house has always a negative, it can\r\nalways defend itself; and it would be ridiculous to suppose that its\r\nacquiescence in the measures to be proposed were not understood\r\nbefore hand. Besides which, it has obtained so much influence by\r\nborough-traffic, and so many of its relations and connections are\r\ndistributed on both sides the commons, as to give it, besides an\r\nabsolute negative in one house, a preponderancy in the other, in all\r\nmatters of common concern.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to discover what is meant by the landed interest, if\r\nit does not mean a combination of aristocratical landholders, opposing\r\ntheir own pecuniary interest to that of the farmer, and every branch of\r\ntrade, commerce, and manufacture. In all other respects it is the\r\nonly interest that needs no partial protection. It enjoys the general\r\nprotection of the world. Every individual, high or low, is interested\r\nin the fruits of the earth; men, women, and children, of all ages and\r\ndegrees, will turn out to assist the farmer, rather than a harvest\r\nshould not be got in; and they will not act thus by any other property.\r\nIt is the only one for which the common prayer of mankind is put up,\r\nand the only one that can never fail from the want of means. It is the\r\ninterest, not of the policy, but of the existence of man, and when it\r\nceases, he must cease to be.\r\n\r\nNo other interest in a nation stands on the same united support.\r\nCommerce, manufactures, arts, sciences, and everything else, compared\r\nwith this, are supported but in parts. Their prosperity or their decay\r\nhas not the same universal influence. When the valleys laugh and sing,\r\nit is not the farmer only, but all creation that rejoice. It is a\r\nprosperity that excludes all envy; and this cannot be said of anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nWhy then, does Mr. Burke talk of his house of peers as the pillar of\r\nthe landed interest? Were that pillar to sink into the earth, the same\r\nlanded property would continue, and the same ploughing, sowing, and\r\nreaping would go on. The aristocracy are not the farmers who work the\r\nland, and raise the produce, but are the mere consumers of the rent; and\r\nwhen compared with the active world are the drones, a seraglio of males,\r\nwho neither collect the honey nor form the hive, but exist only for lazy\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, in his first essay, called aristocracy \"the Corinthian\r\ncapital of polished society.\" Towards completing the figure, he has now\r\nadded the pillar; but still the base is wanting; and whenever a nation\r\nchoose to act a Samson, not blind, but bold, down will go the temple of\r\nDagon, the Lords and the Philistines.\r\n\r\nIf a house of legislation is to be composed of men of one class, for\r\nthe purpose of protecting a distinct interest, all the other interests\r\nshould have the same. The inequality, as well as the burthen of\r\ntaxation, arises from admitting it in one case, and not in all. Had\r\nthere been a house of farmers, there had been no game laws; or a house\r\nof merchants and manufacturers, the taxes had neither been so unequal\r\nnor so excessive. It is from the power of taxation being in the hands of\r\nthose who can throw so great a part of it from their own shoulders, that\r\nit has raged without a check.\r\n\r\nMen of small or moderate estates are more injured by the taxes being\r\nthrown on articles of consumption, than they are eased by warding it\r\nfrom landed property, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, They consume more of the productive taxable articles, in\r\nproportion to their property, than those of large estates.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Their residence is chiefly in towns, and their property in\r\nhouses; and the increase of the poor-rates, occasioned by taxes on\r\nconsumption, is in much greater proportion than the land-tax has\r\nbeen favoured. In Birmingham, the poor-rates are not less than\r\nseven shillings in the pound. From this, as is already observed, the\r\naristocracy are in a great measure exempt.\r\n\r\nThese are but a part of the mischiefs flowing from the wretched scheme\r\nof an house of peers.\r\n\r\nAs a combination, it can always throw a considerable portion of taxes\r\nfrom itself; and as an hereditary house, accountable to nobody, it\r\nresembles a rotten borough, whose consent is to be courted by interest.\r\nThere are but few of its members, who are not in some mode or\r\nother participators, or disposers of the public money. One turns a\r\ncandle-holder, or a lord in waiting; another a lord of the bed-chamber,\r\na groom of the stole, or any insignificant nominal office to which a\r\nsalary is annexed, paid out of the public taxes, and which avoids the\r\ndirect appearance of corruption. Such situations are derogatory to the\r\ncharacter of man; and where they can be submitted to, honour cannot\r\nreside.\r\n\r\nTo all these are to be added the numerous dependants, the long list of\r\nyounger branches and distant relations, who are to be provided for\r\nat the public expense: in short, were an estimation to be made of the\r\ncharge of aristocracy to a nation, it will be found nearly equal to that\r\nof supporting the poor. The Duke of Richmond alone (and there are cases\r\nsimilar to his) takes away as much for himself as would maintain two\r\nthousand poor and aged persons. Is it, then, any wonder, that under such\r\na system of government, taxes and rates have multiplied to their present\r\nextent?\r\n\r\nIn stating these matters, I speak an open and disinterested language,\r\ndictated by no passion but that of humanity. To me, who have not only\r\nrefused offers, because I thought them improper, but have declined\r\nrewards I might with reputation have accepted, it is no wonder that\r\nmeanness and imposition appear disgustful. Independence is my happiness,\r\nand I view things as they are, without regard to place or person; my\r\ncountry is the world, and my religion is to do good.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, in speaking of the aristocratical law of primogeniture, says,\r\n\"it is the standing law of our landed inheritance; and which, without\r\nquestion, has a tendency, and I think,\" continues he, \"a happy tendency,\r\nto preserve a character of weight and consequence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burke may call this law what he pleases, but humanity and impartial\r\nreflection will denounce it as a law of brutal injustice. Were we not\r\naccustomed to the daily practice, and did we only hear of it as the\r\nlaw of some distant part of the world, we should conclude that\r\nthe legislators of such countries had not arrived at a state of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nAs to its preserving a character of weight and consequence, the case\r\nappears to me directly the reverse. It is an attaint upon character;\r\na sort of privateering on family property. It may have weight among\r\ndependent tenants, but it gives none on a scale of national, and much\r\nless of universal character. Speaking for myself, my parents were not\r\nable to give me a shilling, beyond what they gave me in education; and\r\nto do this they distressed themselves: yet, I possess more of what is\r\ncalled consequence, in the world, than any one in Mr. Burke's catalogue\r\nof aristocrats.\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at some of the defects of the two houses of\r\nparliament, I proceed to what is called the crown, upon which I shall be\r\nvery concise.\r\n\r\nIt signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year, the business\r\nof which consists in receiving the money. Whether the person be wise\r\nor foolish, sane or insane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every\r\nministry acts upon the same idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the\r\npeople must be hood-winked, and held in superstitious ignorance by some\r\nbugbear or other; and what is called the crown answers this purpose, and\r\ntherefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from it. This is\r\nmore than can be said of the other two branches.\r\n\r\nThe hazard to which this office is exposed in all countries, is not from\r\nanything that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the\r\nnation--the danger of its coming to its senses.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to call the crown the executive power, and the\r\ncustom is continued, though the reason has ceased.\r\n\r\nIt was called the executive, because the person whom it signified\r\nused, formerly, to act in the character of a judge, in administering\r\nor executing the laws. The tribunals were then a part of the court. The\r\npower, therefore, which is now called the judicial, is what was called\r\nthe executive and, consequently, one or other of the terms is redundant,\r\nand one of the offices useless. When we speak of the crown now, it means\r\nnothing; it signifies neither a judge nor a general: besides which it\r\nis the laws that govern, and not the man. The old terms are kept up, to\r\ngive an appearance of consequence to empty forms; and the only effect\r\nthey have is that of increasing expenses.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to the means of rendering governments more conducive to\r\nthe general happiness of mankind, than they are at present, it will not\r\nbe improper to take a review of the progress of taxation in England.\r\n\r\nIt is a general idea, that when taxes are once laid on, they are never\r\ntaken off. However true this may have been of late, it was not always\r\nso. Either, therefore, the people of former times were more watchful\r\nover government than those of the present, or government was\r\nadministered with less extravagance.\r\n\r\nIt is now seven hundred years since the Norman conquest, and the\r\nestablishment of what is called the crown. Taking this portion of time\r\nin seven separate periods of one hundred years each, the amount of the\r\nannual taxes, at each period, will be as follows:\r\n\r\n    Annual taxes levied by William the Conqueror,\r\n                           beginning in the year 1066    L400,000\r\n    Annual taxes at 100 years from the conquest (1166)    200,000\r\n    Annual taxes at 200 years from the conquest (1266)    150,000\r\n    Annual taxes at 300 years from the conquest (1366)    130,000\r\n    Annual taxes at 400 years from the conquest (1466)    100,000\r\n\r\nThese statements and those which follow, are taken from Sir John\r\nSinclair's History of the Revenue; by which it appears, that taxes\r\ncontinued decreasing for four hundred years, at the expiration of which\r\ntime they were reduced three-fourths, viz., from four hundred thousand\r\npounds to one hundred thousand. The people of England of the present\r\nday, have a traditionary and historical idea of the bravery of their\r\nancestors; but whatever their virtues or their vices might have been,\r\nthey certainly were a people who would not be imposed upon, and who kept\r\ngovernments in awe as to taxation, if not as to principle. Though they\r\nwere not able to expel the monarchical usurpation, they restricted it to\r\na republican economy of taxes.\r\n\r\nLet us now review the remaining three hundred years:\r\n\r\nAnnual amount of taxes at:\r\n\r\n             500 years from the conquest (1566)      500,000\r\n             600 years from the conquest (1666)    1,800,000\r\n             the present time (1791)              17,000,000\r\n\r\nThe difference between the first four hundred years and the last three,\r\nis so astonishing, as to warrant an opinion, that the national character\r\nof the English has changed. It would have been impossible to have\r\ndragooned the former English, into the excess of taxation that now\r\nexists; and when it is considered that the pay of the army, the navy,\r\nand of all the revenue officers, is the same now as it was about a\r\nhundred years ago, when the taxes were not above a tenth part of what\r\nthey are at present, it appears impossible to account for the enormous\r\nincrease and expenditure on any other ground, than extravagance,\r\ncorruption, and intrigue.*[31]\r\n\r\nWith the Revolution of 1688, and more so since the Hanover succession,\r\ncame the destructive system of continental intrigues, and the rage for\r\nforeign wars and foreign dominion; systems of such secure mystery that\r\nthe expenses admit of no accounts; a single line stands for millions. To\r\nwhat excess taxation might have extended had not the French revolution\r\ncontributed to break up the system, and put an end to pretences, is\r\nimpossible to say. Viewed, as that revolution ought to be, as the\r\nfortunate means of lessening the load of taxes of both countries, it is\r\nof as much importance to England as to France; and, if properly improved\r\nto all the advantages of which it is capable, and to which it leads,\r\ndeserves as much celebration in one country as the other.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this subject, I shall begin with the matter that first\r\npresents itself, that of lessening the burthen of taxes; and shall then\r\nadd such matter and propositions, respecting the three countries of\r\nEngland, France, and America, as the present prospect of things appears\r\nto justify: I mean, an alliance of the three, for the purposes that will\r\nbe mentioned in their proper place.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened may happen again. By the statement before shown of\r\nthe progress of taxation, it is seen that taxes have been lessened to\r\na fourth part of what they had formerly been. Though the present\r\ncircumstances do not admit of the same reduction, yet they admit of such\r\na beginning, as may accomplish that end in less time than in the former\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe amount of taxes for the year ending at Michaelmas 1788, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Land-tax                             L 1,950,000\r\n     Customs                                3,789,274\r\n     Excise (including old and new malt)    6,751,727\r\n     Stamps                                 1,278,214\r\n     Miscellaneous taxes and incidents      1,803,755\r\n                                          -----------\r\n                                          L15,572,755\r\n\r\nSince the year 1788, upwards of one million new taxes have been laid on,\r\nbesides the produce of the lotteries; and as the taxes have in general\r\nbeen more productive since than before, the amount may be taken, in\r\nround numbers, at L17,000,000. (The expense of collection and the\r\ndrawbacks, which together amount to nearly two millions, are paid out of\r\nthe gross amount; and the above is the net sum paid into the exchequer).\r\nThis sum of seventeen millions is applied to two different purposes; the\r\none to pay the interest of the National Debt, the other to the current\r\nexpenses of each year. About nine millions are appropriated to the\r\nformer; and the remainder, being nearly eight millions, to the latter.\r\nAs to the million, said to be applied to the reduction of the debt, it\r\nis so much like paying with one hand and taking out with the other, as\r\nnot to merit much notice. It happened, fortunately for France, that\r\nshe possessed national domains for paying off her debt, and thereby\r\nlessening her taxes; but as this is not the case with England, her\r\nreduction of taxes can only take place by reducing the current expenses,\r\nwhich may now be done to the amount of four or five millions annually,\r\nas will hereafter appear. When this is accomplished it will more than\r\ncounter-balance the enormous charge of the American war; and the saving\r\nwill be from the same source from whence the evil arose. As to the\r\nnational debt, however heavy the interest may be in taxes, yet, as it\r\nserves to keep alive a capital useful to commerce, it balances by its\r\neffects a considerable part of its own weight; and as the quantity\r\nof gold and silver is, by some means or other, short of its proper\r\nproportion, being not more than twenty millions, whereas it should be\r\nsixty (foreign intrigue, foreign wars, foreign dominions, will in\r\na great measure account for the deficiency), it would, besides the\r\ninjustice, be bad policy to extinguish a capital that serves to supply\r\nthat defect. But with respect to the current expense, whatever is saved\r\ntherefrom is gain. The excess may serve to keep corruption alive, but it\r\nhas no re-action on credit and commerce, like the interest of the debt.\r\n\r\nIt is now very probable that the English Government (I do not mean\r\nthe nation) is unfriendly to the French Revolution. Whatever serves to\r\nexpose the intrigue and lessen the influence of courts, by lessening\r\ntaxation, will be unwelcome to those who feed upon the spoil. Whilst the\r\nclamour of French intrigue, arbitrary power, popery, and wooden shoes\r\ncould be kept up, the nation was easily allured and alarmed into taxes.\r\nThose days are now past: deception, it is to be hoped, has reaped its\r\nlast harvest, and better times are in prospect for both countries, and\r\nfor the world.\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted that an alliance may be formed between England,\r\nFrance, and America for the purposes hereafter to be mentioned, the\r\nnational expenses of France and England may consequently be lessened.\r\nThe same fleets and armies will no longer be necessary to either, and\r\nthe reduction can be made ship for ship on each side. But to accomplish\r\nthese objects the governments must necessarily be fitted to a common\r\nand correspondent principle. Confidence can never take place while an\r\nhostile disposition remains in either, or where mystery and secrecy on\r\none side is opposed to candour and openness on the other.\r\n\r\nThese matters admitted, the national expenses might be put back, for the\r\nsake of a precedent, to what they were at some period when France and\r\nEngland were not enemies. This, consequently, must be prior to the\r\nHanover succession, and also to the Revolution of 1688.*[32] The first\r\ninstance that presents itself, antecedent to those dates, is in the\r\nvery wasteful and profligate times of Charles the Second; at which time\r\nEngland and France acted as allies. If I have chosen a period of great\r\nextravagance, it will serve to show modern extravagance in a still worse\r\nlight; especially as the pay of the navy, the army, and the revenue\r\nofficers has not increased since that time.\r\n\r\nThe peace establishment was then as follows (see Sir John Sinclair's\r\nHistory of the Revenue):\r\n\r\n              Navy                 L  300,000\r\n              Army                    212,000\r\n              Ordnance                 40,000\r\n              Civil List              462,115\r\n                                      -------\r\n                                   L1,014,115\r\n\r\nThe parliament, however, settled the whole annual peace establishment\r\nat $1,200,000.*[33] If we go back to the time of Elizabeth the amount of\r\nall the taxes was but half a million, yet the nation sees nothing during\r\nthat period that reproaches it with want of consequence.\r\n\r\nAll circumstances, then, taken together, arising from the French\r\nrevolution, from the approaching harmony and reciprocal interest of the\r\ntwo nations, the abolition of the court intrigue on both sides, and\r\nthe progress of knowledge in the science of government, the annual\r\nexpenditure might be put back to one million and a half, viz.:\r\n\r\n             Navy                    L 500,000\r\n             Army                      500,000\r\n             Expenses of Government    500,000\r\n                                     ----------\r\n                                     L1,500,000\r\n\r\nEven this sum is six times greater than the expenses of government are\r\nin America, yet the civil internal government in England (I mean that\r\nadministered by means of quarter sessions, juries and assize, and which,\r\nin fact, is nearly the whole, and performed by the nation), is\r\nless expense upon the revenue, than the same species and portion of\r\ngovernment is in America.\r\n\r\nIt is time that nations should be rational, and not be governed like\r\nanimals, for the pleasure of their riders. To read the history of kings,\r\na man would be almost inclined to suppose that government consisted in\r\nstag-hunting, and that every nation paid a million a-year to a huntsman.\r\nMan ought to have pride, or shame enough to blush at being thus imposed\r\nupon, and when he feels his proper character he will. Upon all subjects\r\nof this nature, there is often passing in the mind, a train of ideas he\r\nhas not yet accustomed himself to encourage and communicate. Restrained\r\nby something that puts on the character of prudence, he acts the\r\nhypocrite upon himself as well as to others. It is, however, curious\r\nto observe how soon this spell can be dissolved. A single expression,\r\nboldly conceived and uttered, will sometimes put a whole company into\r\ntheir proper feelings: and whole nations are acted on in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAs to the offices of which any civil government may be composed, it\r\nmatters but little by what names they are described. In the routine of\r\nbusiness, as before observed, whether a man be styled a president, a\r\nking, an emperor, a senator, or anything else, it is impossible that any\r\nservice he can perform, can merit from a nation more than ten thousand\r\npounds a year; and as no man should be paid beyond his services, so\r\nevery man of a proper heart will not accept more. Public money ought to\r\nbe touched with the most scrupulous consciousness of honour. It is\r\nnot the produce of riches only, but of the hard earnings of labour and\r\npoverty. It is drawn even from the bitterness of want and misery. Not\r\na beggar passes, or perishes in the streets, whose mite is not in that\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nWere it possible that the Congress of America could be so lost to their\r\nduty, and to the interest of their constituents, as to offer General\r\nWashington, as president of America, a million a year, he would not, and\r\nhe could not, accept it. His sense of honour is of another kind. It\r\nhas cost England almost seventy millions sterling, to maintain a family\r\nimported from abroad, of very inferior capacity to thousands in the\r\nnation; and scarcely a year has passed that has not produced some new\r\nmercenary application. Even the physicians' bills have been sent to\r\nthe public to be paid. No wonder that jails are crowded, and taxes and\r\npoor-rates increased. Under such systems, nothing is to be looked for\r\nbut what has already happened; and as to reformation, whenever it come,\r\nit must be from the nation, and not from the government.\r\n\r\nTo show that the sum of five hundred thousand pounds is more than\r\nsufficient to defray all the expenses of the government, exclusive of\r\nnavies and armies, the following estimate is added, for any country, of\r\nthe same extent as England.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, three hundred representatives fairly elected, are\r\nsufficient for all the purposes to which legislation can apply, and\r\npreferable to a larger number. They may be divided into two or three\r\nhouses, or meet in one, as in France, or in any manner a constitution\r\nshall direct.\r\n\r\nAs representation is always considered, in free countries, as the most\r\nhonourable of all stations, the allowance made to it is merely to defray\r\nthe expense which the representatives incur by that service, and not to\r\nit as an office.\r\n\r\n  If an allowance, at the rate of five hundred pounds per\r\n    annum, be made to every representative, deducting for\r\n    non-attendance, the expense, if the whole number\r\n    attended for six months, each year, would be           L 75,00\r\n\r\n  The official departments cannot reasonably exceed the\r\n    following number, with the salaries annexed:\r\n\r\n    Three offices at ten thousand pounds each             L 30,000\r\n    Ten ditto, at five thousand pounds each                 50,000\r\n    Twenty ditto, at two thousand pounds each               40,000\r\n    Forty ditto, at one thousand pounds each                40,000\r\n    Two hundred ditto, at five hundred pounds each         100,000\r\n    Three hundred ditto, at two hundred pounds each         60,000\r\n    Five hundred ditto, at one hundred pounds each          50,000\r\n    Seven hundred ditto, at seventy-five pounds each        52,500\r\n                                                          --------\r\n                                                          L497,500\r\n\r\nIf a nation choose, it can deduct four per cent. from all offices, and\r\nmake one of twenty thousand per annum.\r\n\r\nAll revenue officers are paid out of the monies they collect, and\r\ntherefore, are not in this estimation.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is not offered as an exact detail of offices, but to show\r\nthe number of rate of salaries which five hundred thousand pounds will\r\nsupport; and it will, on experience, be found impracticable to find\r\nbusiness sufficient to justify even this expense. As to the manner in\r\nwhich office business is now performed, the Chiefs, in several offices,\r\nsuch as the post-office, and certain offices in the exchequer, etc., do\r\nlittle more than sign their names three or four times a year; and the\r\nwhole duty is performed by under-clerks.\r\n\r\nTaking, therefore, one million and a half as a sufficient peace\r\nestablishment for all the honest purposes of government, which is\r\nthree hundred thousand pounds more than the peace establishment in the\r\nprofligate and prodigal times of Charles the Second (notwithstanding, as\r\nhas been already observed, the pay and salaries of the army, navy,\r\nand revenue officers, continue the same as at that period), there will\r\nremain a surplus of upwards of six millions out of the present current\r\nexpenses. The question then will be, how to dispose of this surplus.\r\n\r\nWhoever has observed the manner in which trade and taxes twist\r\nthemselves together, must be sensible of the impossibility of separating\r\nthem suddenly.\r\n\r\nFirst. Because the articles now on hand are already charged with the\r\nduty, and the reduction cannot take place on the present stock.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Because, on all those articles on which the duty is charged\r\nin the gross, such as per barrel, hogshead, hundred weight, or ton, the\r\nabolition of the duty does not admit of being divided down so as fully\r\nto relieve the consumer, who purchases by the pint, or the pound. The\r\nlast duty laid on strong beer and ale was three shillings per barrel,\r\nwhich, if taken off, would lessen the purchase only half a farthing per\r\npint, and consequently, would not reach to practical relief.\r\n\r\nThis being the condition of a great part of the taxes, it will be\r\nnecessary to look for such others as are free from this embarrassment\r\nand where the relief will be direct and visible, and capable of\r\nimmediate operation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, the poor-rates are a direct tax which every\r\nhouse-keeper feels, and who knows also, to a farthing, the sum which\r\nhe pays. The national amount of the whole of the poor-rates is not\r\npositively known, but can be procured. Sir John Sinclair, in his History\r\nof the Revenue has stated it at L2,100,587. A considerable part of\r\nwhich is expended in litigations, in which the poor, instead of being\r\nrelieved, are tormented. The expense, however, is the same to the parish\r\nfrom whatever cause it arises.\r\n\r\nIn Birmingham, the amount of poor-rates is fourteen thousand pounds\r\na year. This, though a large sum, is moderate, compared with the\r\npopulation. Birmingham is said to contain seventy thousand souls, and on\r\na proportion of seventy thousand to fourteen thousand pounds poor-rates,\r\nthe national amount of poor-rates, taking the population of England as\r\nseven millions, would be but one million four hundred thousand pounds.\r\nIt is, therefore, most probable, that the population of Birmingham\r\nis over-rated. Fourteen thousand pounds is the proportion upon fifty\r\nthousand souls, taking two millions of poor-rates, as the national\r\namount.\r\n\r\nBe it, however, what it may, it is no other than the consequence of\r\nexcessive burthen of taxes, for, at the time when the taxes were very\r\nlow, the poor were able to maintain themselves; and there were no\r\npoor-rates.*[34] In the present state of things a labouring man, with a\r\nwife or two or three children, does not pay less than between seven and\r\neight pounds a year in taxes. He is not sensible of this, because it is\r\ndisguised to him in the articles which he buys, and he thinks only of\r\ntheir dearness; but as the taxes take from him, at least, a fourth part\r\nof his yearly earnings, he is consequently disabled from providing for\r\na family, especially, if himself, or any of them, are afflicted with\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe first step, therefore, of practical relief, would be to abolish the\r\npoor-rates entirely, and in lieu thereof, to make a remission of taxes\r\nto the poor of double the amount of the present poor-rates, viz., four\r\nmillions annually out of the surplus taxes. By this measure, the poor\r\nwould be benefited two millions, and the house-keepers two millions.\r\nThis alone would be equal to a reduction of one hundred and twenty\r\nmillions of the National Debt, and consequently equal to the whole\r\nexpense of the American War.\r\n\r\nIt will then remain to be considered, which is the most effectual mode\r\nof distributing this remission of four millions.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen, that the poor are generally composed of large\r\nfamilies of children, and old people past their labour. If these two\r\nclasses are provided for, the remedy will so far reach to the full\r\nextent of the case, that what remains will be incidental, and, in a\r\ngreat measure, fall within the compass of benefit clubs, which, though\r\nof humble invention, merit to be ranked among the best of modern\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nAdmitting England to contain seven millions of souls; if one-fifth\r\nthereof are of that class of poor which need support, the number will be\r\none million four hundred thousand. Of this number, one hundred and forty\r\nthousand will be aged poor, as will be hereafter shown, and for which a\r\ndistinct provision will be proposed.\r\n\r\nThere will then remain one million two hundred and sixty thousand\r\nwhich, at five souls to each family, amount to two hundred and fifty-two\r\nthousand families, rendered poor from the expense of children and the\r\nweight of taxes.\r\n\r\nThe number of children under fourteen years of age, in each of those\r\nfamilies, will be found to be about five to every two families; some\r\nhaving two, and others three; some one, and others four: some none,\r\nand others five; but it rarely happens that more than five are under\r\nfourteen years of age, and after this age they are capable of service or\r\nof being apprenticed.\r\n\r\nAllowing five children (under fourteen years) to every two families,\r\n\r\nThe number of children will be 630,000\r\n\r\nThe number of parents, were they all living, would be 504,000\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that if the children are provided for, the parents are\r\nrelieved of consequence, because it is from the expense of bringing up\r\nchildren that their poverty arises.\r\n\r\nHaving thus ascertained the greatest number that can be supposed to need\r\nsupport on account of young families, I proceed to the mode of relief or\r\ndistribution, which is,\r\n\r\nTo pay as a remission of taxes to every poor family, out of the surplus\r\ntaxes, and in room of poor-rates, four pounds a year for every child\r\nunder fourteen years of age; enjoining the parents of such children to\r\nsend them to school, to learn reading, writing, and common arithmetic;\r\nthe ministers of every parish, of every denomination to certify jointly\r\nto an office, for that purpose, that this duty is performed. The amount\r\nof this expense will be,\r\n\r\n    For six hundred and thirty thousand children\r\n     at four pounds per annum each                    L2,520,000\r\n\r\nBy adopting this method, not only the poverty of the parents will be\r\nrelieved, but ignorance will be banished from the rising generation, and\r\nthe number of poor will hereafter become less, because their abilities,\r\nby the aid of education, will be greater. Many a youth, with good\r\nnatural genius, who is apprenticed to a mechanical trade, such as\r\na carpenter, joiner, millwright, shipwright, blacksmith, etc., is\r\nprevented getting forward the whole of his life from the want of a\r\nlittle common education when a boy.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to the case of the aged.\r\n\r\nI divide age into two classes. First, the approach of age, beginning at\r\nfifty. Secondly, old age commencing at sixty.\r\n\r\nAt fifty, though the mental faculties of man are in full vigour, and\r\nhis judgment better than at any preceding date, the bodily powers for\r\nlaborious life are on the decline. He cannot bear the same quantity of\r\nfatigue as at an earlier period. He begins to earn less, and is\r\nless capable of enduring wind and weather; and in those more retired\r\nemployments where much sight is required, he fails apace, and sees\r\nhimself, like an old horse, beginning to be turned adrift.\r\n\r\nAt sixty his labour ought to be over, at least from direct necessity.\r\nIt is painful to see old age working itself to death, in what are called\r\ncivilised countries, for daily bread.\r\n\r\nTo form some judgment of the number of those above fifty years of age,\r\nI have several times counted the persons I met in the streets of London,\r\nmen, women, and children, and have generally found that the average is\r\nabout one in sixteen or seventeen. If it be said that aged persons\r\ndo not come much into the streets, so neither do infants; and a great\r\nproportion of grown children are in schools and in work-shops as\r\napprentices. Taking, then, sixteen for a divisor, the whole number of\r\npersons in England of fifty years and upwards, of both sexes, rich and\r\npoor, will be four hundred and twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe persons to be provided for out of this gross number will be\r\nhusbandmen, common labourers, journeymen of every trade and their wives,\r\nsailors, and disbanded soldiers, worn out servants of both sexes, and\r\npoor widows.\r\n\r\nThere will be also a considerable number of middling tradesmen,\r\nwho having lived decently in the former part of life, begin, as age\r\napproaches, to lose their business, and at last fall to decay.\r\n\r\nBesides these there will be constantly thrown off from the revolutions\r\nof that wheel which no man can stop nor regulate, a number from every\r\nclass of life connected with commerce and adventure.\r\n\r\nTo provide for all those accidents, and whatever else may befall, I take\r\nthe number of persons who, at one time or other of their lives, after\r\nfifty years of age, may feel it necessary or comfortable to be better\r\nsupported, than they can support themselves, and that not as a matter of\r\ngrace and favour, but of right, at one-third of the whole number, which\r\nis one hundred and forty thousand, as stated in a previous page, and\r\nfor whom a distinct provision was proposed to be made. If there be more,\r\nsociety, notwithstanding the show and pomposity of government, is in a\r\ndeplorable condition in England.\r\n\r\nOf this one hundred and forty thousand, I take one half, seventy\r\nthousand, to be of the age of fifty and under sixty, and the other half\r\nto be sixty years and upwards. Having thus ascertained the probable\r\nproportion of the number of aged persons, I proceed to the mode of\r\nrendering their condition comfortable, which is:\r\n\r\nTo pay to every such person of the age of fifty years, and until he\r\nshall arrive at the age of sixty, the sum of six pounds per annum out of\r\nthe surplus taxes, and ten pounds per annum during life after the age of\r\nsixty. The expense of which will be,\r\n\r\n    Seventy thousand persons, at L6 per annum      L  420,000\r\n    Seventy thousand persons, at L10 per annum        700,000\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                                                   L1,120,000\r\n\r\nThis support, as already remarked, is not of the nature of a charity but\r\nof a right. Every person in England, male and female, pays on an average\r\nin taxes two pounds eight shillings and sixpence per annum from the day\r\nof his (or her) birth; and, if the expense of collection be added, he\r\npays two pounds eleven shillings and sixpence; consequently, at the end\r\nof fifty years he has paid one hundred and twenty-eight pounds fifteen\r\nshillings; and at sixty one hundred and fifty-four pounds ten shillings.\r\nConverting, therefore, his (or her) individual tax in a tontine, the\r\nmoney he shall receive after fifty years is but little more than the\r\nlegal interest of the net money he has paid; the rest is made up from\r\nthose whose circumstances do not require them to draw such support, and\r\nthe capital in both cases defrays the expenses of government. It is on\r\nthis ground that I have extended the probable claims to one-third of\r\nthe number of aged persons in the nation.--Is it, then, better that\r\nthe lives of one hundred and forty thousand aged persons be rendered\r\ncomfortable, or that a million a year of public money be expended on\r\nany one individual, and him often of the most worthless or insignificant\r\ncharacter? Let reason and justice, let honour and humanity, let even\r\nhypocrisy, sycophancy and Mr. Burke, let George, let Louis,\r\nLeopold, Frederic, Catherine, Cornwallis, or Tippoo Saib, answer the\r\nquestion.*[35]\r\n\r\nThe sum thus remitted to the poor will be,\r\n\r\n  To two hundred and fifty-two thousand poor families,\r\n    containing six hundred and thirty thousand children  L2,520,000\r\n  To one hundred and forty thousand aged persons          1,120,000\r\n                                                         ----------\r\n                                                         L3,640,000\r\n\r\nThere will then remain three hundred and sixty thousand pounds out of\r\nthe four millions, part of which may be applied as follows:--\r\n\r\nAfter all the above cases are provided for there will still be a number\r\nof families who, though not properly of the class of poor, yet find it\r\ndifficult to give education to their children; and such children, under\r\nsuch a case, would be in a worse condition than if their parents were\r\nactually poor. A nation under a well-regulated government should permit\r\nnone to remain uninstructed. It is monarchical and aristocratical\r\ngovernment only that requires ignorance for its support.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, four hundred thousand children to be in this condition,\r\nwhich is a greater number than ought to be supposed after the provisions\r\nalready made, the method will be:\r\n\r\nTo allow for each of those children ten shillings a year for the\r\nexpense of schooling for six years each, which will give them six months\r\nschooling each year, and half a crown a year for paper and spelling\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nThe expense of this will be annually L250,000.*[36]\r\n\r\nThere will then remain one hundred and ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great modes of relief which the best instituted and\r\nbest principled government may devise, there will be a number of smaller\r\ncases, which it is good policy as well as beneficence in a nation to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nWere twenty shillings to be given immediately on the birth of a child,\r\nto every woman who should make the demand, and none will make it whose\r\ncircumstances do not require it, it might relieve a great deal of\r\ninstant distress.\r\n\r\nThere are about two hundred thousand births yearly in England; and if\r\nclaimed by one fourth,\r\n\r\n        The amount would be                    L50,000\r\n\r\nAnd twenty shillings to every new-married couple who should claim in\r\nlike manner. This would not exceed the sum of L20,000.\r\n\r\nAlso twenty thousand pounds to be appropriated to defray the funeral\r\nexpenses of persons, who, travelling for work, may die at a distance\r\nfrom their friends. By relieving parishes from this charge, the sick\r\nstranger will be better treated.\r\n\r\nI shall finish this part of the subject with a plan adapted to the\r\nparticular condition of a metropolis, such as London.\r\n\r\nCases are continually occurring in a metropolis, different from those\r\nwhich occur in the country, and for which a different, or rather an\r\nadditional, mode of relief is necessary. In the country, even in large\r\ntowns, people have a knowledge of each other, and distress never rises\r\nto that extreme height it sometimes does in a metropolis. There is no\r\nsuch thing in the country as persons, in the literal sense of the word,\r\nstarved to death, or dying with cold from the want of a lodging. Yet\r\nsuch cases, and others equally as miserable, happen in London.\r\n\r\nMany a youth comes up to London full of expectations, and with little\r\nor no money, and unless he get immediate employment he is already half\r\nundone; and boys bred up in London without any means of a livelihood,\r\nand as it often happens of dissolute parents, are in a still worse\r\ncondition; and servants long out of place are not much better off. In\r\nshort, a world of little cases is continually arising, which busy or\r\naffluent life knows not of, to open the first door to distress. Hunger\r\nis not among the postponable wants, and a day, even a few hours, in such\r\na condition is often the crisis of a life of ruin.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances which are the general cause of the little thefts\r\nand pilferings that lead to greater, may be prevented. There yet remain\r\ntwenty thousand pounds out of the four millions of surplus taxes, which\r\nwith another fund hereafter to be mentioned, amounting to about twenty\r\nthousand pounds more, cannot be better applied than to this purpose. The\r\nplan will then be:\r\n\r\nFirst, To erect two or more buildings, or take some already erected,\r\ncapable of containing at least six thousand persons, and to have in each\r\nof these places as many kinds of employment as can be contrived, so that\r\nevery person who shall come may find something which he or she can do.\r\n\r\nSecondly, To receive all who shall come, without enquiring who or what\r\nthey are. The only condition to be, that for so much, or so many hours'\r\nwork, each person shall receive so many meals of wholesome food, and a\r\nwarm lodging, at least as good as a barrack. That a certain portion of\r\nwhat each person's work shall be worth shall be reserved, and given to\r\nhim or her, on their going away; and that each person shall stay as long\r\nor as short a time, or come as often as he choose, on these conditions.\r\n\r\nIf each person stayed three months, it would assist by rotation\r\ntwenty-four thousand persons annually, though the real number, at all\r\ntimes, would be but six thousand. By establishing an asylum of this\r\nkind, such persons to whom temporary distresses occur, would have an\r\nopportunity to recruit themselves, and be enabled to look out for better\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nAllowing that their labour paid but one half the expense of supporting\r\nthem, after reserving a portion of their earnings for themselves, the\r\nsum of forty thousand pounds additional would defray all other charges\r\nfor even a greater number than six thousand.\r\n\r\nThe fund very properly convertible to this purpose, in addition to\r\nthe twenty thousand pounds, remaining of the former fund, will be the\r\nproduce of the tax upon coals, so iniquitously and wantonly applied to\r\nthe support of the Duke of Richmond. It is horrid that any man, more\r\nespecially at the price coals now are, should live on the distresses of\r\na community; and any government permitting such an abuse, deserves to\r\nbe dismissed. This fund is said to be about twenty thousand pounds per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nI shall now conclude this plan with enumerating the several particulars,\r\nand then proceed to other matters.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration is as follows:--\r\n\r\nFirst, Abolition of two millions poor-rates.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Provision for two hundred and fifty thousand poor families.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Education for one million and thirty thousand children.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Comfortable provision for one hundred and forty thousand aged\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nFifthly, Donation of twenty shillings each for fifty thousand births.\r\n\r\nSixthly, Donation of twenty shillings each for twenty thousand\r\nmarriages.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, Allowance of twenty thousand pounds for the funeral expenses\r\nof persons travelling for work, and dying at a distance from their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nEighthly, Employment, at all times, for the casual poor in the cities of\r\nLondon and Westminster.\r\n\r\nBy the operation of this plan, the poor laws, those instruments of civil\r\ntorture, will be superseded, and the wasteful expense of litigation\r\nprevented. The hearts of the humane will not be shocked by ragged and\r\nhungry children, and persons of seventy and eighty years of age, begging\r\nfor bread. The dying poor will not be dragged from place to place to\r\nbreathe their last, as a reprisal of parish upon parish. Widows will\r\nhave a maintenance for their children, and not be carted away, on the\r\ndeath of their husbands, like culprits and criminals; and children will\r\nno longer be considered as increasing the distresses of their parents.\r\nThe haunts of the wretched will be known, because it will be to their\r\nadvantage; and the number of petty crimes, the offspring of distress and\r\npoverty, will be lessened. The poor, as well as the rich, will then be\r\ninterested in the support of government, and the cause and apprehension\r\nof riots and tumults will cease.--Ye who sit in ease, and solace\r\nyourselves in plenty, and such there are in Turkey and Russia, as well\r\nas in England, and who say to yourselves, \"Are we not well off?\" have ye\r\nthought of these things? When ye do, ye will cease to speak and feel for\r\nyourselves alone.\r\n\r\nThe plan is easy in practice. It does not embarrass trade by a sudden\r\ninterruption in the order of taxes, but effects the relief by changing\r\nthe application of them; and the money necessary for the purpose can be\r\ndrawn from the excise collections, which are made eight times a year in\r\nevery market town in England.\r\n\r\nHaving now arranged and concluded this subject, I proceed to the next.\r\n\r\nTaking the present current expenses at seven millions and an half, which\r\nis the least amount they are now at, there will remain (after the sum of\r\none million and an half be taken for the new current expenses and four\r\nmillions for the before-mentioned service) the sum of two millions; part\r\nof which to be applied as follows:\r\n\r\nThough fleets and armies, by an alliance with France, will, in a great\r\nmeasure, become useless, yet the persons who have devoted themselves to\r\nthose services, and have thereby unfitted themselves for other lines of\r\nlife, are not to be sufferers by the means that make others happy. They\r\nare a different description of men from those who form or hang about a\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nA part of the army will remain, at least for some years, and also of the\r\nnavy, for which a provision is already made in the former part of this\r\nplan of one million, which is almost half a million more than the peace\r\nestablishment of the army and navy in the prodigal times of Charles the\r\nSecond.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, fifteen thousand soldiers to be disbanded, and that an\r\nallowance be made to each of three shillings a week during life, clear\r\nof all deductions, to be paid in the same manner as the Chelsea College\r\npensioners are paid, and for them to return to their trades and their\r\nfriends; and also that an addition of fifteen thousand sixpences per\r\nweek be made to the pay of the soldiers who shall remain; the annual\r\nexpenses will be:\r\n\r\n    To the pay of fifteen thousand disbanded soldiers\r\n      at three shillings per week                        L117,000\r\n    Additional pay to the remaining soldiers               19,500\r\n    Suppose that the pay to the officers of the\r\n      disbanded corps be the same amount as sum allowed\r\n      to the men                                          117,000\r\n                                                         --------                                                         L253,500\r\n\r\n    To prevent bulky estimations, admit the same sum\r\n      to the disbanded navy as to the army,\r\n      and the same increase of pay                        253,500\r\n                                                         --------\r\n                                       Total             L507,000\r\n\r\nEvery year some part of this sum of half a million (I omit the odd seven\r\nthousand pounds for the purpose of keeping the account unembarrassed)\r\nwill fall in, and the whole of it in time, as it is on the ground of\r\nlife annuities, except the increased pay of twenty-nine thousand\r\npounds. As it falls in, part of the taxes may be taken off; and as, for\r\ninstance, when thirty thousand pounds fall in, the duty on hops may be\r\nwholly taken off; and as other parts fall in, the duties on candles and\r\nsoap may be lessened, till at last they will totally cease. There now\r\nremains at least one million and a half of surplus taxes.\r\n\r\nThe tax on houses and windows is one of those direct taxes, which, like\r\nthe poor-rates, is not confounded with trade; and, when taken off, the\r\nrelief will be instantly felt. This tax falls heavy on the middle class\r\nof people. The amount of this tax, by the returns of 1788, was:\r\n\r\n   Houses and windows:                       L       s.    d.\r\n    By the act of 1766                    385,459    11    7\r\n    By the act be 1779                    130,739    14    5 1/2\r\n                                          ----------------------\r\n                             Total        516,199     6    0 1/2\r\n\r\nIf this tax be struck off, there will then remain about one million of\r\nsurplus taxes; and as it is always proper to keep a sum in reserve, for\r\nincidental matters, it may be best not to extend reductions further in\r\nthe first instance, but to consider what may be accomplished by other\r\nmodes of reform.\r\n\r\nAmong the taxes most heavily felt is the commutation tax. I shall\r\ntherefore offer a plan for its abolition, by substituting another in its\r\nplace, which will effect three objects at once: 1, that of removing\r\nthe burthen to where it can best be borne; 2, restoring justice among\r\nfamilies by a distribution of property; 3, extirpating the overgrown\r\ninfluence arising from the unnatural law of primogeniture, which is\r\none of the principal sources of corruption at elections. The amount of\r\ncommutation tax by the returns of 1788, was L771,657.\r\n\r\nWhen taxes are proposed, the country is amused by the plausible language\r\nof taxing luxuries. One thing is called a luxury at one time, and\r\nsomething else at another; but the real luxury does not consist in the\r\narticle, but in the means of procuring it, and this is always kept out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nI know not why any plant or herb of the field should be a greater luxury\r\nin one country than another; but an overgrown estate in either is a\r\nluxury at all times, and, as such, is the proper object of taxation. It\r\nis, therefore, right to take those kind tax-making gentlemen up on their\r\nown word, and argue on the principle themselves have laid down, that of\r\ntaxing luxuries. If they or their champion, Mr. Burke, who, I fear, is\r\ngrowing out of date, like the man in armour, can prove that an estate of\r\ntwenty, thirty, or forty thousand pounds a year is not a luxury, I will\r\ngive up the argument.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that any annual sum, say, for instance, one thousand pounds,\r\nis necessary or sufficient for the support of a family, consequently the\r\nsecond thousand is of the nature of a luxury, the third still more so,\r\nand by proceeding on, we shall at last arrive at a sum that may not\r\nimproperly be called a prohibitable luxury. It would be impolitic to set\r\nbounds to property acquired by industry, and therefore it is right to\r\nplace the prohibition beyond the probable acquisition to which\r\nindustry can extend; but there ought to be a limit to property or the\r\naccumulation of it by bequest. It should pass in some other line. The\r\nrichest in every nation have poor relations, and those often very near\r\nin consanguinity.\r\n\r\nThe following table of progressive taxation is constructed on the above\r\nprinciples, and as a substitute for the commutation tax.

Yet formidable as this tax appears, it will not, I\r\nbelieve, produce so much as the commutation tax; should it produce more,\r\nit ought to be lowered to that amount upon estates under two or three\r\nthousand a year.\r\n\r\nOn small and middling estates it is lighter (as it is intended to be)\r\nthan the commutation tax. It is not till after seven or eight thousand\r\na year that it begins to be heavy. The object is not so much the produce\r\nof the tax as the justice of the measure. The aristocracy has screened\r\nitself too much, and this serves to restore a part of the lost\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of its screening itself, it is only necessary to look\r\nback to the first establishment of the excise laws, at what is called\r\nthe Restoration, or the coming of Charles the Second. The aristocratical\r\ninterest then in power, commuted the feudal services itself was under,\r\nby laying a tax on beer brewed for sale; that is, they compounded with\r\nCharles for an exemption from those services for themselves and their\r\nheirs, by a tax to be paid by other people. The aristocracy do not\r\npurchase beer brewed for sale, but brew their own beer free of the duty,\r\nand if any commutation at that time were necessary, it ought to have\r\nbeen at the expense of those for whom the exemptions from those services\r\nwere intended;*[37] instead of which, it was thrown on an entirely\r\ndifferent class of men.\r\n\r\nBut the chief object of this progressive tax (besides the justice of\r\nrendering taxes more equal than they are) is, as already stated, to\r\nextirpate the overgrown influence arising from the unnatural law of\r\nprimogeniture, and which is one of the principal sources of corruption\r\nat elections.\r\n\r\nIt would be attended with no good consequences to enquire how such vast\r\nestates as thirty, forty, or fifty thousand a year could commence, and\r\nthat at a time when commerce and manufactures were not in a state to\r\nadmit of such acquisitions. Let it be sufficient to remedy the evil by\r\nputting them in a condition of descending again to the community by the\r\nquiet means of apportioning them among all the heirs and heiresses of\r\nthose families. This will be the more necessary, because hitherto the\r\naristocracy have quartered their younger children and connections upon\r\nthe public in useless posts, places and offices, which when abolished\r\nwill leave them destitute, unless the law of primogeniture be also\r\nabolished or superseded.\r\n\r\nA progressive tax will, in a great measure, effect this object, and that\r\nas a matter of interest to the parties most immediately concerned, as\r\nwill be seen by the following table; which shows the net produce upon\r\nevery estate, after subtracting the tax. By this it will appear that\r\nafter an estate exceeds thirteen or fourteen thousand a year, the\r\nremainder produces but little profit to the holder, and consequently,\r\nWill pass either to the younger children, or to other kindred.\r\n\r\n                            TABLE III\r\n     Showing the net produce of every estate from one thousand\r\n             to twenty-three thousand pounds a year\r\n\r\n          No of thousand       Total tax\r\n             per annum         subtracted       Net produce\r\n               L1000              L21               L979\r\n                2000               59               1941\r\n                3000              109               2891\r\n                4000              184               3816\r\n                5000              284               4716\r\n                6000              434               5566\r\n                7000              634               6366\r\n                8000              880               7120\r\n                9000             1100               7900\r\n              10,000             1530               8470\r\n              11,000             1930               9070\r\n              12,000             2380               9620\r\n              13,000             2880             10,120\r\n         (No of thousand      (Total tax\r\n             per annum)        subtracted)     (Net produce)\r\n              14,000             3430             10,570\r\n              15,000             4030             10,970\r\n              16,000             4680             11,320\r\n              17,000             5380             11,620\r\n              18,000             6130             11,870\r\n              19,000             6930             12,170\r\n              20,000             7780             12,220\r\n              21,000             8680             12,320\r\n              22,000             9630             12,370\r\n              23,000           10,630             12,370\r\n\r\nN.B. The odd shillings are dropped in this table.\r\n\r\nAccording to this table, an estate cannot produce more than L12,370\r\nclear of the land tax and the progressive tax, and therefore the\r\ndividing such estates will follow as a matter of family interest. An\r\nestate of L23,000 a year, divided into five estates of four thousand\r\neach and one of three, will be charged only L1,129 which is but five per\r\ncent., but if held by one possessor, will be charged L10,630.\r\n\r\nAlthough an enquiry into the origin of those estates be unnecessary, the\r\ncontinuation of them in their present state is another subject. It is a\r\nmatter of national concern. As hereditary estates, the law has created\r\nthe evil, and it ought also to provide the remedy. Primogeniture ought\r\nto be abolished, not only because it is unnatural and unjust, but\r\nbecause the country suffers by its operation. By cutting off (as before\r\nobserved) the younger children from their proper portion of inheritance,\r\nthe public is loaded with the expense of maintaining them; and the\r\nfreedom of elections violated by the overbearing influence which\r\nthis unjust monopoly of family property produces. Nor is this all. It\r\noccasions a waste of national property. A considerable part of the land\r\nof the country is rendered unproductive, by the great extent of parks\r\nand chases which this law serves to keep up, and this at a time when\r\nthe annual production of grain is not equal to the national\r\nconsumption.*[38]--In short, the evils of the aristocratical system are\r\nso great and numerous, so inconsistent with every thing that is just,\r\nwise, natural, and beneficent, that when they are considered, there\r\nought not to be a doubt that many, who are now classed under that\r\ndescription, will wish to see such a system abolished.\r\n\r\nWhat pleasure can they derive from contemplating the exposed\r\ncondition, and almost certain beggary of their younger offspring? Every\r\naristocratical family has an appendage of family beggars hanging round\r\nit, which in a few ages, or a few generations, are shook off, and\r\nconsole themselves with telling their tale in almshouses, workhouses,\r\nand prisons. This is the natural consequence of aristocracy. The peer\r\nand the beggar are often of the same family. One extreme produces the\r\nother: to make one rich many must be made poor; neither can the system\r\nbe supported by other means.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of people to whom the laws of England are\r\nparticularly hostile, and those the most helpless; younger children,\r\nand the poor. Of the former I have just spoken; of the latter I shall\r\nmention one instance out of the many that might be produced, and with\r\nwhich I shall close this subject.\r\n\r\nSeveral laws are in existence for regulating and limiting work-men's\r\nwages. Why not leave them as free to make their own bargains, as the\r\nlaw-makers are to let their farms and houses? Personal labour is all\r\nthe property they have. Why is that little, and the little freedom they\r\nenjoy, to be infringed? But the injustice will appear stronger, if we\r\nconsider the operation and effect of such laws. When wages are fixed\r\nby what is called a law, the legal wages remain stationary, while every\r\nthing else is in progression; and as those who make that law still\r\ncontinue to lay on new taxes by other laws, they increase the expense of\r\nliving by one law, and take away the means by another.\r\n\r\nBut if these gentlemen law-makers and tax-makers thought it right to\r\nlimit the poor pittance which personal labour can produce, and on which\r\na whole family is to be supported, they certainly must feel themselves\r\nhappily indulged in a limitation on their own part, of not less than\r\ntwelve thousand a-year, and that of property they never acquired (nor\r\nprobably any of their ancestors), and of which they have made never\r\nacquire so ill a use.\r\n\r\nHaving now finished this subject, I shall bring the several particulars\r\ninto one view, and then proceed to other matters.\r\n\r\nThe first eight articles, mentioned earlier, are;\r\n\r\n1. Abolition of two millions poor-rates.\r\n\r\n2. Provision for two hundred and fifty-two thousand poor families, at\r\nthe rate of four pounds per head for each child under fourteen years of\r\nage; which, with the addition of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds,\r\nprovides also education for one million and thirty thousand children.\r\n\r\n3. Annuity of six pounds (per annum) each for all poor persons, decayed\r\ntradesmen, and others (supposed seventy thousand) of the age of fifty\r\nyears, and until sixty.\r\n\r\n4. Annuity of ten pounds each for life for all poor persons, decayed\r\ntradesmen, and others (supposed seventy thousand) of the age of sixty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n5. Donation of twenty shillings each for fifty thousand births.\r\n\r\n6. Donation of twenty shillings each for twenty thousand marriages.\r\n\r\n7. Allowance of twenty thousand pounds for the funeral expenses of\r\npersons travelling for work, and dying at a distance from their friends.\r\n\r\n8. Employment at all times for the casual poor in the cities of London\r\nand Westminster.\r\n\r\nSecond Enumeration\r\n\r\n9. Abolition of the tax on houses and windows.\r\n\r\n10. Allowance of three shillings per week for life to fifteen thousand\r\ndisbanded soldiers, and a proportionate allowance to the officers of the\r\ndisbanded corps.\r\n\r\n11. Increase of pay to the remaining soldiers of L19,500 annually.\r\n\r\n12. The same allowance to the disbanded navy, and the same increase of\r\npay, as to the army.\r\n\r\n13. Abolition of the commutation tax.\r\n\r\n14. Plan of a progressive tax, operating to extirpate the unjust\r\nand unnatural law of primogeniture, and the vicious influence of the\r\naristocratical system.*[39]\r\n\r\nThere yet remains, as already stated, one million of surplus taxes. Some\r\npart of this will be required for circumstances that do not immediately\r\npresent themselves, and such part as shall not be wanted, will admit of\r\na further reduction of taxes equal to that amount.\r\n\r\nAmong the claims that justice requires to be made, the condition of the\r\ninferior revenue-officers will merit attention. It is a reproach to\r\nany government to waste such an immensity of revenue in sinecures and\r\nnominal and unnecessary places and officers, and not allow even a decent\r\nlivelihood to those on whom the labour falls. The salary of the inferior\r\nofficers of the revenue has stood at the petty pittance of less than\r\nfifty pounds a year for upwards of one hundred years. It ought to be\r\nseventy. About one hundred and twenty thousand pounds applied to this\r\npurpose, will put all those salaries in a decent condition.\r\n\r\nThis was proposed to be done almost twenty years ago, but the\r\ntreasury-board then in being, startled at it, as it might lead to\r\nsimilar expectations from the army and navy; and the event was, that the\r\nKing, or somebody for him, applied to parliament to have his own salary\r\nraised an hundred thousand pounds a year, which being done, every thing\r\nelse was laid aside.\r\n\r\nWith respect to another class of men, the inferior clergy, I forbear to\r\nenlarge on their condition; but all partialities and prejudices for,\r\nor against, different modes and forms of religion aside, common justice\r\nwill determine, whether there ought to be an income of twenty or thirty\r\npounds a year to one man, and of ten thousand to another. I speak on\r\nthis subject with the more freedom, because I am known not to be a\r\nPresbyterian; and therefore the cant cry of court sycophants, about\r\nchurch and meeting, kept up to amuse and bewilder the nation, cannot be\r\nraised against me.\r\n\r\nYe simple men on both sides the question, do you not see through this\r\ncourtly craft? If ye can be kept disputing and wrangling about church\r\nand meeting, ye just answer the purpose of every courtier, who lives the\r\nwhile on the spoils of the taxes, and laughs at your credulity. Every\r\nreligion is good that teaches man to be good; and I know of none that\r\ninstructs him to be bad.\r\n\r\nAll the before-mentioned calculations suppose only sixteen millions\r\nand an half of taxes paid into the exchequer, after the expense of\r\ncollection and drawbacks at the custom-house and excise-office are\r\ndeducted; whereas the sum paid into the exchequer is very nearly, if not\r\nquite, seventeen millions. The taxes raised in Scotland and Ireland are\r\nexpended in those countries, and therefore their savings will come out\r\nof their own taxes; but if any part be paid into the English exchequer,\r\nit might be remitted. This will not make one hundred thousand pounds a\r\nyear difference.\r\n\r\nThere now remains only the national debt to be considered. In the year\r\n1789, the interest, exclusive of the tontine, was L9,150,138. How much\r\nthe capital has been reduced since that time the minister best knows.\r\nBut after paying the interest, abolishing the tax on houses and windows,\r\nthe commutation tax, and the poor-rates; and making all the provisions\r\nfor the poor, for the education of children, the support of the aged,\r\nthe disbanded part of the army and navy, and increasing the pay of the\r\nremainder, there will be a surplus of one million.\r\n\r\nThe present scheme of paying off the national debt appears to me,\r\nspeaking as an indifferent person, to be an ill-concerted, if not a\r\nfallacious job. The burthen of the national debt consists not in its\r\nbeing so many millions, or so many hundred millions, but in the quantity\r\nof taxes collected every year to pay the interest. If this quantity\r\ncontinues the same, the burthen of the national debt is the same to all\r\nintents and purposes, be the capital more or less. The only knowledge\r\nwhich the public can have of the reduction of the debt, must be through\r\nthe reduction of taxes for paying the interest. The debt, therefore,\r\nis not reduced one farthing to the public by all the millions that\r\nhave been paid; and it would require more money now to purchase up the\r\ncapital, than when the scheme began.\r\n\r\nDigressing for a moment at this point, to which I shall return again, I\r\nlook back to the appointment of Mr. Pitt, as minister.\r\n\r\nI was then in America. The war was over; and though resentment had\r\nceased, memory was still alive.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the coalition arrived, though it was a matter of no\r\nconcern to I felt it as a man. It had something in it which shocked, by\r\npublicly sporting with decency, if not with principle. It was impudence\r\nin Lord North; it was a want of firmness in Mr. Fox.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt was, at that time, what may be called a maiden character in\r\npolitics. So far from being hackneyed, he appeared not to be initiated\r\ninto the first mysteries of court intrigue. Everything was in his\r\nfavour. Resentment against the coalition served as friendship to him,\r\nand his ignorance of vice was credited for virtue. With the return\r\nof peace, commerce and prosperity would rise of itself; yet even this\r\nincrease was thrown to his account.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the helm, the storm was over, and he had nothing to\r\ninterrupt his course. It required even ingenuity to be wrong, and\r\nhe succeeded. A little time showed him the same sort of man as his\r\npredecessors had been. Instead of profiting by those errors which had\r\naccumulated a burthen of taxes unparalleled in the world, he sought,\r\nI might almost say, he advertised for enemies, and provoked means to\r\nincrease taxation. Aiming at something, he knew not what, he ransacked\r\nEurope and India for adventures, and abandoning the fair pretensions he\r\nbegan with, he became the knight-errant of modern times.\r\n\r\nIt is unpleasant to see character throw itself away. It is more so to\r\nsee one's-self deceived. Mr. Pitt had merited nothing, but he promised\r\nmuch. He gave symptoms of a mind superior to the meanness and corruption\r\nof courts. His apparent candour encouraged expectations; and the public\r\nconfidence, stunned, wearied, and confounded by a chaos of parties,\r\nrevived and attached itself to him. But mistaking, as he has done, the\r\ndisgust of the nation against the coalition, for merit in himself,\r\nhe has rushed into measures which a man less supported would not have\r\npresumed to act.\r\n\r\nAll this seems to show that change of ministers amounts to nothing.\r\nOne goes out, another comes in, and still the same measures, vices, and\r\nextravagance are pursued. It signifies not who is minister. The defect\r\nlies in the system. The foundation and the superstructure of the\r\ngovernment is bad. Prop it as you please, it continually sinks into\r\ncourt government, and ever will.\r\n\r\nI return, as I promised, to the subject of the national debt, that\r\noffspring of the Dutch-Anglo revolution, and its handmaid the Hanover\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nBut it is now too late to enquire how it began. Those to whom it is\r\ndue have advanced the money; and whether it was well or ill spent, or\r\npocketed, is not their crime. It is, however, easy to see, that as\r\nthe nation proceeds in contemplating the nature and principles of\r\ngovernment, and to understand taxes, and make comparisons between those\r\nof America, France, and England, it will be next to impossible to keep\r\nit in the same torpid state it has hitherto been. Some reform must,\r\nfrom the necessity of the case, soon begin. It is not whether these\r\nprinciples press with little or much force in the present moment. They\r\nare out. They are abroad in the world, and no force can stop them. Like\r\na secret told, they are beyond recall; and he must be blind indeed that\r\ndoes not see that a change is already beginning.\r\n\r\nNine millions of dead taxes is a serious thing; and this not only for\r\nbad, but in a great measure for foreign government. By putting the power\r\nof making war into the hands of the foreigners who came for what they\r\ncould get, little else was to be expected than what has happened.\r\n\r\nReasons are already advanced in this work, showing that whatever the\r\nreforms in the taxes may be, they ought to be made in the current\r\nexpenses of government, and not in the part applied to the interest\r\nof the national debt. By remitting the taxes of the poor, they will be\r\ntotally relieved, and all discontent will be taken away; and by striking\r\noff such of the taxes as are already mentioned, the nation will more\r\nthan recover the whole expense of the mad American war.\r\n\r\nThere will then remain only the national debt as a subject of\r\ndiscontent; and in order to remove, or rather to prevent this, it\r\nwould be good policy in the stockholders themselves to consider it as\r\nproperty, subject like all other property, to bear some portion of the\r\ntaxes. It would give to it both popularity and security, and as a great\r\npart of its present inconvenience is balanced by the capital which it\r\nkeeps alive, a measure of this kind would so far add to that balance as\r\nto silence objections.\r\n\r\nThis may be done by such gradual means as to accomplish all that is\r\nnecessary with the greatest ease and convenience.\r\n\r\nInstead of taxing the capital, the best method would be to tax the\r\ninterest by some progressive ratio, and to lessen the public taxes in\r\nthe same proportion as the interest diminished.\r\n\r\nSuppose the interest was taxed one halfpenny in the pound the first\r\nyear, a penny more the second, and to proceed by a certain ratio to be\r\ndetermined upon, always less than any other tax upon property. Such\r\na tax would be subtracted from the interest at the time of payment,\r\nwithout any expense of collection.\r\n\r\nOne halfpenny in the pound would lessen the interest and consequently\r\nthe taxes, twenty thousand pounds. The tax on wagons amounts to this\r\nsum, and this tax might be taken off the first year. The second year the\r\ntax on female servants, or some other of the like amount might also be\r\ntaken off, and by proceeding in this manner, always applying the tax\r\nraised from the property of the debt toward its extinction, and not\r\ncarry it to the current services, it would liberate itself.\r\n\r\nThe stockholders, notwithstanding this tax, would pay less taxes than\r\nthey do now. What they would save by the extinction of the poor-rates,\r\nand the tax on houses and windows, and the commutation tax, would\r\nbe considerably greater than what this tax, slow, but certain in its\r\noperation, amounts to.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me to be prudence to look out for measures that may apply\r\nunder any circumstances that may approach. There is, at this moment,\r\na crisis in the affairs of Europe that requires it. Preparation now\r\nis wisdom. If taxation be once let loose, it will be difficult to\r\nre-instate it; neither would the relief be so effectual, as if it\r\nproceeded by some certain and gradual reduction.\r\n\r\nThe fraud, hypocrisy, and imposition of governments, are now beginning\r\nto be too well understood to promise them any long career. The farce\r\nof monarchy and aristocracy, in all countries, is following that of\r\nchivalry, and Mr. Burke is dressing aristocracy, in all countries, is\r\nfollowing that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dressing for the funeral.\r\nLet it then pass quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the\r\nmourners be comforted.\r\n\r\nThe time is not very distant when England will laugh at itself for\r\nsending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brunswick for men, at the expense\r\nof a million a year, who understood neither her laws, her language, nor\r\nher interest, and whose capacities would scarcely have fitted them for\r\nthe office of a parish constable. If government could be trusted to such\r\nhands, it must be some easy and simple thing indeed, and materials fit\r\nfor all the purposes may be found in every town and village in England.\r\n\r\nWhen it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are happy;\r\nneither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are\r\nempty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the\r\ntaxes are not oppressive; the rational world is my friend, because I\r\nam the friend of its happiness: when these things can be said, then may\r\nthat country boast its constitution and its government.\r\n\r\nWithin the space of a few years we have seen two revolutions, those\r\nof America and France. In the former, the contest was long, and\r\nthe conflict severe; in the latter, the nation acted with such a\r\nconsolidated impulse, that having no foreign enemy to contend with, the\r\nrevolution was complete in power the moment it appeared. From both those\r\ninstances it is evident, that the greatest forces that can be brought\r\ninto the field of revolutions, are reason and common interest. Where\r\nthese can have the opportunity of acting, opposition dies with fear, or\r\ncrumbles away by conviction. It is a great standing which they have now\r\nuniversally obtained; and we may hereafter hope to see revolutions, or\r\nchanges in governments, produced with the same quiet operation by which\r\nany measure, determinable by reason and discussion, is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhen a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no\r\nlonger to be governed as before; but it would not only be wrong, but\r\nbad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason.\r\nRebellion consists in forcibly opposing the general will of a nation,\r\nwhether by a party or by a government. There ought, therefore, to be in\r\nevery nation a method of occasionally ascertaining the state of public\r\nopinion with respect to government. On this point the old government of\r\nFrance was superior to the present government of England, because, on\r\nextraordinary occasions, recourse could be had what was then called the\r\nStates General. But in England there are no such occasional bodies; and\r\nas to those who are now called Representatives, a great part of them are\r\nmere machines of the court, placemen, and dependants.\r\n\r\nI presume, that though all the people of England pay taxes, not an\r\nhundredth part of them are electors, and the members of one of the\r\nhouses of parliament represent nobody but themselves. There is,\r\ntherefore, no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a\r\nright to act in any matter respecting a general reform; and by the same\r\nright that two persons can confer on such a subject, a thousand may.\r\nThe object, in all such preliminary proceedings, is to find out what the\r\ngeneral sense of a nation is, and to be governed by it. If it prefer a\r\nbad or defective government to a reform or choose to pay ten times more\r\ntaxes than there is any occasion for, it has a right so to do; and so\r\nlong as the majority do not impose conditions on the minority, different\r\nfrom what they impose upon themselves, though there may be much error,\r\nthere is no injustice. Neither will the error continue long. Reason and\r\ndiscussion will soon bring things right, however wrong they may begin.\r\nBy such a process no tumult is to be apprehended. The poor, in all\r\ncountries, are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in\r\nwhich their interest and happiness is included. It is only by neglecting\r\nand rejecting them that they become tumultuous.\r\n\r\nThe objects that now press on the public attention are, the French\r\nrevolution, and the prospect of a general revolution in governments.\r\nOf all nations in Europe there is none so much interested in the French\r\nrevolution as England. Enemies for ages, and that at a vast expense,\r\nand without any national object, the opportunity now presents itself of\r\namicably closing the scene, and joining their efforts to reform the rest\r\nof Europe. By doing this they will not only prevent the further effusion\r\nof blood, and increase of taxes, but be in a condition of getting rid\r\nof a considerable part of their present burthens, as has been already\r\nstated. Long experience however has shown, that reforms of this kind are\r\nnot those which old governments wish to promote, and therefore it is\r\nto nations, and not to such governments, that these matters present\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding part of this work, I have spoken of an alliance between\r\nEngland, France, and America, for purposes that were to be afterwards\r\nmentioned. Though I have no direct authority on the part of America,\r\nI have good reason to conclude, that she is disposed to enter into a\r\nconsideration of such a measure, provided, that the governments with\r\nwhich she might ally, acted as national governments, and not as courts\r\nenveloped in intrigue and mystery. That France as a nation, and a\r\nnational government, would prefer an alliance with England, is a matter\r\nof certainty. Nations, like individuals, who have long been enemies,\r\nwithout knowing each other, or knowing why, become the better friends\r\nwhen they discover the errors and impositions under which they had\r\nacted.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, therefore, the probability of such a connection, I will state\r\nsome matters by which such an alliance, together with that of Holland,\r\nmight render service, not only to the parties immediately concerned, but\r\nto all Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, certain, that if the fleets of England, France, and\r\nHolland were confederated, they could propose, with effect, a limitation\r\nto, and a general dismantling of, all the navies in Europe, to a certain\r\nproportion to be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nFirst, That no new ship of war shall be built by any power in Europe,\r\nthemselves included.\r\n\r\nSecond, That all the navies now in existence shall be put back, suppose\r\nto one-tenth of their present force. This will save to France and\r\nEngland, at least two millions sterling annually to each, and their\r\nrelative force be in the same proportion as it is now. If men will\r\npermit themselves to think, as rational beings ought to think,\r\nnothing can appear more ridiculous and absurd, exclusive of all moral\r\nreflections, than to be at the expense of building navies, filling them\r\nwith men, and then hauling them into the ocean, to try which can\r\nsink each other fastest. Peace, which costs nothing, is attended with\r\ninfinitely more advantage, than any victory with all its expense. But\r\nthis, though it best answers the purpose of nations, does not that\r\nof court governments, whose habited policy is pretence for taxation,\r\nplaces, and offices.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, also certain, that the above confederated powers,\r\ntogether with that of the United States of America, can propose with\r\neffect, to Spain, the independence of South America, and the opening\r\nthose countries of immense extent and wealth to the general commerce of\r\nthe world, as North America now is.\r\n\r\nWith how much more glory, and advantage to itself, does a nation act,\r\nwhen it exerts its powers to rescue the world from bondage, and to\r\ncreate itself friends, than when it employs those powers to increase\r\nruin, desolation, and misery. The horrid scene that is now acting by the\r\nEnglish government in the East-Indies, is fit only to be told of Goths\r\nand Vandals, who, destitute of principle, robbed and tortured the world\r\nthey were incapable of enjoying.\r\n\r\nThe opening of South America would produce an immense field of commerce,\r\nand a ready money market for manufactures, which the eastern world does\r\nnot. The East is already a country full of manufactures, the importation\r\nof which is not only an injury to the manufactures of England, but a\r\ndrain upon its specie. The balance against England by this trade is\r\nregularly upwards of half a million annually sent out in the East-India\r\nships in silver; and this is the reason, together with German intrigue,\r\nand German subsidies, that there is so little silver in England.\r\n\r\nBut any war is harvest to such governments, however ruinous it may be\r\nto a nation. It serves to keep up deceitful expectations which prevent\r\npeople from looking into the defects and abuses of government. It is the\r\nlo here! and the lo there! that amuses and cheats the multitude.\r\n\r\nNever did so great an opportunity offer itself to England, and to all\r\nEurope, as is produced by the two Revolutions of America and France. By\r\nthe former, freedom has a national champion in the western world; and by\r\nthe latter, in Europe. When another nation shall join France, despotism\r\nand bad government will scarcely dare to appear. To use a trite\r\nexpression, the iron is becoming hot all over Europe. The insulted\r\nGerman and the enslaved Spaniard, the Russ and the Pole, are beginning\r\nto think. The present age will hereafter merit to be called the Age of\r\nReason, and the present generation will appear to the future as the Adam\r\nof a new world.\r\n\r\nWhen all the governments of Europe shall be established on the\r\nrepresentative system, nations will become acquainted, and the\r\nanimosities and prejudices fomented by the intrigue and artifice of\r\ncourts, will cease. The oppressed soldier will become a freeman; and\r\nthe tortured sailor, no longer dragged through the streets like a felon,\r\nwill pursue his mercantile voyage in safety. It would be better that\r\nnations should wi continue the pay of their soldiers during their lives,\r\nand give them their discharge and restore them to freedom and their\r\nfriends, and cease recruiting, than retain such multitudes at the\r\nsame expense, in a condition useless to society and to themselves. As\r\nsoldiers have hitherto been treated in most countries, they might be\r\nsaid to be without a friend. Shunned by the citizen on an apprehension\r\nof their being enemies to liberty, and too often insulted by those\r\nwho commanded them, their condition was a double oppression. But where\r\ngenuine principles of liberty pervade a people, every thing is restored\r\nto order; and the soldier civilly treated, returns the civility.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating revolutions, it is easy to perceive that they may arise\r\nfrom two distinct causes; the one, to avoid or get rid of some great\r\ncalamity; the other, to obtain some great and positive good; and the two\r\nmay be distinguished by the names of active and passive revolutions. In\r\nthose which proceed from the former cause, the temper becomes incensed\r\nand soured; and the redress, obtained by danger, is too often sullied by\r\nrevenge. But in those which proceed from the latter, the heart, rather\r\nanimated than agitated, enters serenely upon the subject. Reason\r\nand discussion, persuasion and conviction, become the weapons in the\r\ncontest, and it is only when those are attempted to be suppressed that\r\nrecourse is had to violence. When men unite in agreeing that a thing is\r\ngood, could it be obtained, such for instance as relief from a burden\r\nof taxes and the extinction of corruption, the object is more than half\r\naccomplished. What they approve as the end, they will promote in the\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nWill any man say, in the present excess of taxation, falling so heavily\r\non the poor, that a remission of five pounds annually of taxes to one\r\nhundred and four thousand poor families is not a good thing? Will he say\r\nthat a remission of seven pounds annually to one hundred thousand other\r\npoor families--of eight pounds annually to another hundred thousand poor\r\nfamilies, and of ten pounds annually to fifty thousand poor and widowed\r\nfamilies, are not good things? And, to proceed a step further in this\r\nclimax, will he say that to provide against the misfortunes to which\r\nall human life is subject, by securing six pounds annually for all poor,\r\ndistressed, and reduced persons of the age of fifty and until sixty, and\r\nof ten pounds annually after sixty, is not a good thing?\r\n\r\nWill he say that an abolition of two millions of poor-rates to the\r\nhouse-keepers, and of the whole of the house and window-light tax and of\r\nthe commutation tax is not a good thing? Or will he say that to abolish\r\ncorruption is a bad thing?\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the good to be obtained be worthy of a passive, rational,\r\nand costless revolution, it would be bad policy to prefer waiting for\r\na calamity that should force a violent one. I have no idea, considering\r\nthe reforms which are now passing and spreading throughout Europe, that\r\nEngland will permit herself to be the last; and where the occasion and\r\nthe opportunity quietly offer, it is better than to wait for a turbulent\r\nnecessity. It may be considered as an honour to the animal faculties\r\nof man to obtain redress by courage and danger, but it is far greater\r\nhonour to the rational faculties to accomplish the same object by\r\nreason, accommodation, and general consent.*[40]\r\n\r\nAs reforms, or revolutions, call them which you please, extend\r\nthemselves among nations, those nations will form connections and\r\nconventions, and when a few are thus confederated, the progress will\r\nbe rapid, till despotism and corrupt government be totally expelled, at\r\nleast out of two quarters of the world, Europe and America. The Algerine\r\npiracy may then be commanded to cease, for it is only by the malicious\r\npolicy of old governments, against each other, that it exists.\r\n\r\nThroughout this work, various and numerous as the subjects are, which\r\nI have taken up and investigated, there is only a single paragraph\r\nupon religion, viz. \"that every religion is good that teaches man to be\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nI have carefully avoided to enlarge upon the subject, because I am\r\ninclined to believe that what is called the present ministry, wish to\r\nsee contentions about religion kept up, to prevent the nation turning\r\nits attention to subjects of government. It is as if they were to say,\r\n\"Look that way, or any way, but this.\"\r\n\r\nBut as religion is very improperly made a political machine, and the\r\nreality of it is thereby destroyed, I will conclude this work with\r\nstating in what light religion appears to me.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose a large family of children, who, on any particular day,\r\nor particular circumstance, made it a custom to present to their parents\r\nsome token of their affection and gratitude, each of them would make a\r\ndifferent offering, and most probably in a different manner. Some would\r\npay their congratulations in themes of verse and prose, by some little\r\ndevices, as their genius dictated, or according to what they thought\r\nwould please; and, perhaps, the least of all, not able to do any of\r\nthose things, would ramble into the garden, or the field, and gather\r\nwhat it thought the prettiest flower it could find, though, perhaps, it\r\nmight be but a simple weed. The parent would be more gratified by such\r\na variety, than if the whole of them had acted on a concerted plan,\r\nand each had made exactly the same offering. This would have the cold\r\nappearance of contrivance, or the harsh one of control. But of all\r\nunwelcome things, nothing could more afflict the parent than to know,\r\nthat the whole of them had afterwards gotten together by the ears, boys\r\nand girls, fighting, scratching, reviling, and abusing each other about\r\nwhich was the best or the worst present.\r\n\r\nWhy may we not suppose, that the great Father of all is pleased with\r\nvariety of devotion; and that the greatest offence we can act, is that\r\nby which we seek to torment and render each other miserable? For my own\r\npart, I am fully satisfied that what I am now doing, with an endeavour\r\nto conciliate mankind, to render their condition happy, to unite nations\r\nthat have hitherto been enemies, and to extirpate the horrid practice of\r\nwar, and break the chains of slavery and oppression is acceptable in his\r\nsight, and being the best service I can perform, I act it cheerfully.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that any two men, on what are called doctrinal points,\r\nthink alike who think at all. It is only those who have not thought that\r\nappear to agree. It is in this case as with what is called the British\r\nconstitution. It has been taken for granted to be good, and encomiums\r\nhave supplied the place of proof. But when the nation comes to examine\r\ninto its principles and the abuses it admits, it will be found to have\r\nmore defects than I have pointed out in this work and the former.\r\n\r\nAs to what are called national religions, we may, with as much\r\npropriety, talk of national Gods. It is either political craft or the\r\nremains of the Pagan system, when every nation had its separate and\r\nparticular deity. Among all the writers of the English church clergy,\r\nwho have treated on the general subject of religion, the present Bishop\r\nof Llandaff has not been excelled, and it is with much pleasure that I\r\ntake this opportunity of expressing this token of respect.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through the whole of the subject, at least, as far as it\r\nappears to me at present. It has been my intention for the five years I\r\nhave been in Europe, to offer an address to the people of England on\r\nthe subject of government, if the opportunity presented itself before I\r\nreturned to America. Mr. Burke has thrown it in my way, and I thank\r\nhim. On a certain occasion, three years ago, I pressed him to propose a\r\nnational convention, to be fairly elected, for the purpose of taking\r\nthe state of the nation into consideration; but I found, that however\r\nstrongly the parliamentary current was then setting against the party\r\nhe acted with, their policy was to keep every thing within that field\r\nof corruption, and trust to accidents. Long experience had shown that\r\nparliaments would follow any change of ministers, and on this they\r\nrested their hopes and their expectations.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when divisions arose respecting governments, recourse was had\r\nto the sword, and a civil war ensued. That savage custom is exploded by\r\nthe new system, and reference is had to national conventions. Discussion\r\nand the general will arbitrates the question, and to this, private\r\nopinion yields with a good grace, and order is preserved uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen have affected to call the principles upon which this\r\nwork and the former part of Rights of Man are founded, \"a new-fangled\r\ndoctrine.\" The question is not whether those principles are new or old,\r\nbut whether they are right or wrong. Suppose the former, I will show\r\ntheir effect by a figure easily understood.\r\n\r\nIt is now towards the middle of February. Were I to take a turn into\r\nthe country, the trees would present a leafless, wintery appearance. As\r\npeople are apt to pluck twigs as they walk along, I perhaps might do the\r\nsame, and by chance might observe, that a single bud on that twig had\r\nbegun to swell. I should reason very unnaturally, or rather not reason\r\nat all, to suppose this was the only bud in England which had this\r\nappearance. Instead of deciding thus, I should instantly conclude, that\r\nthe same appearance was beginning, or about to begin, every where; and\r\nthough the vegetable sleep will continue longer on some trees and plants\r\nthan on others, and though some of them may not blossom for two or three\r\nyears, all will be in leaf in the summer, except those which are rotten.\r\nWhat pace the political summer may keep with the natural, no human\r\nforesight can determine. It is, however, not difficult to perceive\r\nthat the spring is begun.--Thus wishing, as I sincerely do, freedom and\r\nhappiness to all nations, I close the Second Part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nAs the publication of this work has been delayed beyond the time\r\nintended, I think it not improper, all circumstances considered, to\r\nstate the causes that have occasioned delay.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably observe, that some parts in the plan contained\r\nin this work for reducing the taxes, and certain parts in Mr. Pitt's\r\nspeech at the opening of the present session, Tuesday, January 31, are\r\nso much alike as to induce a belief, that either the author had taken\r\nthe hint from Mr. Pitt, or Mr. Pitt from the author.--I will first point\r\nout the parts that are similar, and then state such circumstances as I\r\nam acquainted with, leaving the reader to make his own conclusion.\r\n\r\nConsidering it as almost an unprecedented case, that taxes should\r\nbe proposed to be taken off, it is equally extraordinary that such a\r\nmeasure should occur to two persons at the same time; and still more\r\nso (considering the vast variety and multiplicity of taxes) that they\r\nshould hit on the same specific taxes. Mr. Pitt has mentioned, in his\r\nspeech, the tax on Carts and Wagons--that on Female Servantsthe lowering\r\nthe tax on Candles and the taking off the tax of three shillings on\r\nHouses having under seven windows.\r\n\r\nEvery one of those specific taxes are a part of the plan contained in\r\nthis work, and proposed also to be taken off. Mr. Pitt's plan, it is\r\ntrue, goes no further than to a reduction of three hundred and twenty\r\nthousand pounds; and the reduction proposed in this work, to nearly six\r\nmillions. I have made my calculations on only sixteen millions and an\r\nhalf of revenue, still asserting that it was \"very nearly, if not quite,\r\nseventeen millions.\" Mr. Pitt states it at 16,690,000. I know enough of\r\nthe matter to say, that he has not overstated it. Having thus given the\r\nparticulars, which correspond in this work and his speech, I will state\r\na chain of circumstances that may lead to some explanation.\r\n\r\nThe first hint for lessening the taxes, and that as a consequence\r\nflowing from the French revolution, is to be found in the Address and\r\nDeclaration of the Gentlemen who met at the Thatched-House Tavern,\r\nAugust 20, 1791. Among many other particulars stated in that Address, is\r\nthe following, put as an interrogation to the government opposers of the\r\nFrench Revolution. \"Are they sorry that the pretence for new oppressive\r\ntaxes, and the occasion for continuing many old taxes will be at an\r\nend?\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the persons who chiefly frequent the\r\nThatched-House Tavern, are men of court connections, and so much did\r\nthey take this Address and Declaration respecting the French Revolution,\r\nand the reduction of taxes in disgust, that the Landlord was under the\r\nnecessity of informing the Gentlemen, who composed the meeting of the\r\n20th of August, and who proposed holding another meeting, that he could\r\nnot receive them.*[41]\r\n\r\nWhat was only hinted in the Address and Declaration respecting taxes and\r\nprinciples of government, will be found reduced to a regular system in\r\nthis work. But as Mr. Pitt's speech contains some of the same things\r\nrespecting taxes, I now come to give the circumstances before alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe case is: This work was intended to be published just before the\r\nmeeting of Parliament, and for that purpose a considerable part of\r\nthe copy was put into the printer's hands in September, and all the\r\nremaining copy, which contains the part to which Mr. Pitt's speech\r\nis similar, was given to him full six weeks before the meeting of\r\nParliament, and he was informed of the time at which it was to appear.\r\nHe had composed nearly the whole about a fortnight before the time of\r\nParliament meeting, and had given me a proof of the next sheet. It was\r\nthen in sufficient forwardness to be out at the time proposed, as two\r\nother sheets were ready for striking off. I had before told him, that\r\nif he thought he should be straitened for time, I could get part of\r\nthe work done at another press, which he desired me not to do. In this\r\nmanner the work stood on the Tuesday fortnight preceding the meeting of\r\nParliament, when all at once, without any previous intimation, though I\r\nhad been with him the evening before, he sent me, by one of his\r\nworkmen, all the remaining copy, declining to go on with the work on any\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTo account for this extraordinary conduct I was totally at a loss, as\r\nhe stopped at the part where the arguments on systems and principles of\r\ngovernment closed, and where the plan for the reduction of taxes, the\r\neducation of children, and the support of the poor and the aged begins;\r\nand still more especially, as he had, at the time of his beginning to\r\nprint, and before he had seen the whole copy, offered a thousand pounds\r\nfor the copy-right, together with the future copy-right of the former\r\npart of the Rights of Man. I told the person who brought me this offer\r\nthat I should not accept it, and wished it not to be renewed, giving him\r\nas my reason, that though I believed the printer to be an honest man, I\r\nwould never put it in the power of any printer or publisher to suppress\r\nor alter a work of mine, by making him master of the copy, or give to\r\nhim the right of selling it to any minister, or to any other person,\r\nor to treat as a mere matter of traffic, that which I intended should\r\noperate as a principle.\r\n\r\nHis refusal to complete the work (which he could not purchase) obliged\r\nme to seek for another printer, and this of consequence would throw\r\nthe publication back till after the meeting of Parliament, otherways it\r\nwould have appeared that Mr. Pitt had only taken up a part of the plan\r\nwhich I had more fully stated.\r\n\r\nWhether that gentleman, or any other, had seen the work, or any part of\r\nit, is more than I have authority to say. But the manner in which the\r\nwork was returned, and the particular time at which this was done, and\r\nthat after the offers he had made, are suspicious circumstances. I know\r\nwhat the opinion of booksellers and publishers is upon such a case, but\r\nas to my own opinion, I choose to make no declaration. There are many\r\nways by which proof sheets may be procured by other persons before a\r\nwork publicly appears; to which I shall add a certain circumstance,\r\nwhich is,\r\n\r\nA ministerial bookseller in Piccadilly who has been employed, as common\r\nreport says, by a clerk of one of the boards closely connected with\r\nthe ministry (the board of trade and plantation, of which Hawkesbury is\r\npresident) to publish what he calls my Life, (I wish his own life and\r\nthose of the cabinet were as good), used to have his books printed at\r\nthe same printing-office that I employed; but when the former part of\r\nRights of Man came out, he took his work away in dudgeon; and about a\r\nweek or ten days before the printer returned my copy, he came to\r\nmake him an offer of his work again, which was accepted. This would\r\nconsequently give him admission into the printing-office where the\r\nsheets of this work were then lying; and as booksellers and printers are\r\nfree with each other, he would have the opportunity of seeing what was\r\ngoing on.--Be the case, however, as it may, Mr. Pitt's plan, little and\r\ndiminutive as it is, would have made a very awkward appearance, had this\r\nwork appeared at the time the printer had engaged to finish it.\r\n\r\nI have now stated the particulars which occasioned the delay, from the\r\nproposal to purchase, to the refusal to print. If all the Gentlemen\r\nare innocent, it is very unfortunate for them that such a variety of\r\nsuspicious circumstances should, without any design, arrange themselves\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHaving now finished this part, I will conclude with stating another\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight or three weeks before the meeting of Parliament, a\r\nsmall addition, amounting to about twelve shillings and sixpence a year,\r\nwas made to the pay of the soldiers, or rather their pay was docked\r\nso much less. Some Gentlemen who knew, in part, that this work would\r\ncontain a plan of reforms respecting the oppressed condition of\r\nsoldiers, wished me to add a note to the work, signifying that the part\r\nupon that subject had been in the printer's hands some weeks before that\r\naddition of pay was proposed. I declined doing this, lest it should be\r\ninterpreted into an air of vanity, or an endeavour to excite suspicion\r\n(for which perhaps there might be no grounds) that some of the\r\ngovernment gentlemen had, by some means or other, made out what this\r\nwork would contain: and had not the printing been interrupted so as\r\nto occasion a delay beyond the time fixed for publication, nothing\r\ncontained in this appendix would have appeared.\r\n\r\n                        Thomas Paine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S NOTES FOR PART ONE AND PART TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The main and uniform maxim of the judges is, the greater the truth\r\nthe greater the libel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Since writing the above, two other places occur in Mr. Burke's\r\npamphlet in which the name of the Bastille is mentioned, but in the same\r\nmanner. In the one he introduces it in a sort of obscure question, and\r\nasks: \"Will any ministers who now serve such a king, with but a decent\r\nappearance of respect, cordially obey the orders of those whom but the\r\nother day, in his name, they had committed to the Bastille?\" In the\r\nother the taking it is mentioned as implying criminality in the French\r\nguards, who assisted in demolishing it. \"They have not,\" says he,\r\n\"forgot the taking the king's castles at Paris.\" This is Mr. Burke, who\r\npretends to write on constitutional freedom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I am warranted in asserting this, as I had it personally from M.\r\nde la Fayette, with whom I lived in habits of friendship for fourteen\r\nyears.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: An account of the expedition to Versailles may be seen in No. 13 of\r\nthe Revolution de Paris containing the events from the 3rd to the 10th\r\nof October, 1789.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: It is a practice in some parts of the country, when two travellers\r\nhave but one horse, which, like the national purse, will not carry\r\ndouble, that the one mounts and rides two or three miles ahead, and then\r\nties the horse to a gate and walks on. When the second traveller arrives\r\nhe takes the horse, rides on, and passes his companion a mile or two,\r\nand ties again, and so on--Ride and tie.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The word he used was renvoye, dismissed or sent away.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: When in any country we see extraordinary circumstances taking\r\nplace, they naturally lead any man who has a talent for observation\r\nand investigation, to enquire into the causes. The manufacturers of\r\nManchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield, are the principal manufacturers\r\nin England. From whence did this arise? A little observation will\r\nexplain the case. The principal, and the generality of the inhabitants\r\nof those places, are not of what is called in England, the church\r\nestablished by law: and they, or their fathers, (for it is within but a\r\nfew years) withdrew from the persecution of the chartered towns, where\r\ntest-laws more particularly operate, and established a sort of asylum\r\nfor themselves in those places. It was the only asylum that then\r\noffered, for the rest of Europe was worse.--But the case is now\r\nchanging. France and America bid all comers welcome, and initiate them\r\ninto all the rights of citizenship. Policy and interest, therefore,\r\nwill, but perhaps too late, dictate in England, what reason and justice\r\ncould not. Those manufacturers are withdrawing, and arising in other\r\nplaces. There is now erecting in Passey, three miles from Paris, a large\r\ncotton manufactory, and several are already erected in America. Soon\r\nafter the rejecting the Bill for repealing the test-law, one of the\r\nrichest manufacturers in England said in my hearing, \"England, Sir, is\r\nnot a country for a dissenter to live in,--we must go to France.\" These\r\nare truths, and it is doing justice to both parties to tell them. It\r\nis chiefly the dissenters that have carried English manufactures to the\r\nheight they are now at, and the same men have it in their power to carry\r\nthem away; and though those manufactures would afterwards continue in\r\nthose places, the foreign market will be lost. There frequently appear\r\nin the London Gazette, extracts from certain acts to prevent machines\r\nand persons, as far as they can extend to persons, from going out of the\r\ncountry. It appears from these that the ill effects of the test-laws and\r\nchurch-establishment begin to be much suspected; but the remedy of force\r\ncan never supply the remedy of reason. In the progress of less than a\r\ncentury, all the unrepresented part of England, of all denominations,\r\nwhich is at least an hundred times the most numerous, may begin to feel\r\nthe necessity of a constitution, and then all those matters will come\r\nregularly before them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: When the English Minister, Mr. Pitt, mentions the French finances\r\nagain in the English Parliament, it would be well that he noticed this\r\nas an example.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Mr. Burke, (and I must take the liberty of telling him that he is\r\nvery unacquainted with French affairs), speaking upon this subject,\r\nsays, \"The first thing that struck me in calling the States-General,\r\nwas a great departure from the ancient course\";--and he soon after says,\r\n\"From the moment I read the list, I saw distinctly, and very nearly as\r\nit has happened, all that was to follow.\"--Mr. Burke certainly did not\r\nsee an that was to follow. I endeavoured to impress him, as well before\r\nas after the States-General met, that there would be a revolution; but\r\nwas not able to make him see it, neither would he believe it. How then\r\nhe could distinctly see all the parts, when the whole was out of sight,\r\nis beyond my comprehension. And with respect to the \"departure from the\r\nancient course,\" besides the natural weakness of the remark, it shows\r\nthat he is unacquainted with circumstances. The departure was necessary,\r\nfrom the experience had upon it, that the ancient course was a bad one.\r\nThe States-General of 1614 were called at the commencement of the civil\r\nwar in the minority of Louis XIII.; but by the class of arranging them\r\nby orders, they increased the confusion they were called to compose. The\r\nauthor of L'Intrigue du Cabinet, (Intrigue of the Cabinet), who\r\nwrote before any revolution was thought of in France, speaking of the\r\nStates-General of 1614, says, \"They held the public in suspense five\r\nmonths; and by the questions agitated therein, and the heat with which\r\nthey were put, it appears that the great (les grands) thought more to\r\nsatisfy their particular passions, than to procure the goods of the\r\nnation; and the whole time passed away in altercations, ceremonies and\r\nparade.\"--L'Intrigue du Cabinet, vol. i. p. 329.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: There is a single idea, which, if it strikes rightly upon the mind,\r\neither in a legal or a religious sense, will prevent any man or any body\r\nof men, or any government, from going wrong on the subject of religion;\r\nwhich is, that before any human institutions of government were known in\r\nthe world, there existed, if I may so express it, a compact between\r\nGod and man, from the beginning of time: and that as the relation and\r\ncondition which man in his individual person stands in towards his Maker\r\ncannot be changed by any human laws or human authority, that religious\r\ndevotion, which is a part of this compact, cannot so much as be made a\r\nsubject of human laws; and that all laws must conform themselves to this\r\nprior existing compact, and not assume to make the compact conform to\r\nthe laws, which, besides being human, are subsequent thereto. The first\r\nact of man, when he looked around and saw himself a creature which he\r\ndid not make, and a world furnished for his reception, must have been\r\ndevotion; and devotion must ever continue sacred to every individual\r\nman, as it appears, right to him; and governments do mischief by\r\ninterfering.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See this work, Part I starting at line number 254.--N.B. Since the\r\ntaking of the Bastille, the occurrences have been published: but the\r\nmatters recorded in this narrative, are prior to that period; and some\r\nof them, as may be easily seen, can be but very little known.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See \"Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Great Britain,\" by G.\r\nChalmers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See \"Administration of the Finances of France,\" vol. iii, by M.\r\nNeckar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: \"Administration of the Finances of France,\" vol. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Whether the English commerce does not bring in money, or whether the\r\ngovernment sends it out after it is brought in, is a matter which the\r\nparties concerned can best explain; but that the deficiency exists, is\r\nnot in the power of either to disprove. While Dr. Price, Mr. Eden, (now\r\nAuckland), Mr. Chalmers, and others, were debating whether the quantity\r\nof money in England was greater or less than at the Revolution, the\r\ncircumstance was not adverted to, that since the Revolution, there\r\ncannot have been less than four hundred millions sterling imported into\r\nEurope; and therefore the quantity in England ought at least to have\r\nbeen four times greater than it was at the Revolution, to be on a\r\nproportion with Europe. What England is now doing by paper, is what she\r\nwould have been able to do by solid money, if gold and silver had come\r\ninto the nation in the proportion it ought, or had not been sent out;\r\nand she is endeavouring to restore by paper, the balance she has lost by\r\nmoney. It is certain, that the gold and silver which arrive annually\r\nin the register-ships to Spain and Portugal, do not remain in those\r\ncountries. Taking the value half in gold and half in silver, it is about\r\nfour hundred tons annually; and from the number of ships and galloons\r\nemployed in the trade of bringing those metals from South-America to\r\nPortugal and Spain, the quantity sufficiently proves itself, without\r\nreferring to the registers.\r\n\r\nIn the situation England now is, it is impossible she can increase in\r\nmoney. High taxes not only lessen the property of the individuals, but\r\nthey lessen also the money capital of the nation, by inducing smuggling,\r\nwhich can only be carried on by gold and silver. By the politics which\r\nthe British Government have carried on with the Inland Powers of Germany\r\nand the Continent, it has made an enemy of all the Maritime Powers, and\r\nis therefore obliged to keep up a large navy; but though the navy is\r\nbuilt in England, the naval stores must be purchased from abroad, and\r\nthat from countries where the greatest part must be paid for in gold\r\nand silver. Some fallacious rumours have been set afloat in England to\r\ninduce a belief in money, and, among others, that of the French refugees\r\nbringing great quantities. The idea is ridiculous. The general part of\r\nthe money in France is silver; and it would take upwards of twenty of\r\nthe largest broad wheel wagons, with ten horses each, to remove one\r\nmillion sterling of silver. Is it then to be supposed, that a few people\r\nfleeing on horse-back or in post-chaises, in a secret manner, and having\r\nthe French Custom-House to pass, and the sea to cross, could bring even\r\na sufficiency for their own expenses?\r\n\r\nWhen millions of money are spoken of, it should be recollected, that\r\nsuch sums can only accumulate in a country by slow degrees, and a long\r\nprocession of time. The most frugal system that England could now adopt,\r\nwould not recover in a century the balance she has lost in money since\r\nthe commencement of the Hanover succession. She is seventy millions\r\nbehind France, and she must be in some considerable proportion behind\r\nevery country in Europe, because the returns of the English mint do not\r\nshow an increase of money, while the registers of Lisbon and Cadiz\r\nshow an European increase of between three and four hundred millions\r\nsterling.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: That part of America which is generally called New-England,\r\nincluding New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island, and Connecticut,\r\nis peopled chiefly by English descendants. In the state of New-York\r\nabout half are Dutch, the rest English, Scotch, and Irish. In\r\nNew-jersey, a mixture of English and Dutch, with some Scotch and Irish.\r\nIn Pennsylvania about one third are English, another Germans, and\r\nthe remainder Scotch and Irish, with some Swedes. The States to the\r\nsouthward have a greater proportion of English than the middle States,\r\nbut in all of them there is a mixture; and besides those enumerated,\r\nthere are a considerable number of French, and some few of all the\r\nEuropean nations, lying on the coast. The most numerous religious\r\ndenomination are the Presbyterians; but no one sect is established above\r\nanother, and all men are equally citizens.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: For a character of aristocracy, the reader is referred to Rights of\r\nMan, Part I., starting at line number 1457.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: The whole amount of the assessed taxes of France, for the present\r\nyear, is three hundred millions of francs, which is twelve millions\r\nand a half sterling; and the incidental taxes are estimated at three\r\nmillions, making in the whole fifteen millions and a half; which among\r\ntwenty-four millions of people, is not quite thirteen shillings per\r\nhead. France has lessened her taxes since the revolution, nearly nine\r\nmillions sterling annually. Before the revolution, the city of Paris\r\npaid a duty of upwards of thirty per cent. on all articles brought into\r\nthe city. This tax was collected at the city gates. It was taken off on\r\nthe first of last May, and the gates taken down.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: What was called the livre rouge, or the red book, in France, was not\r\nexactly similar to the Court Calendar in England; but it sufficiently\r\nshowed how a great part of the taxes was lavished.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: In England the improvements in agriculture, useful arts,\r\nmanufactures, and commerce, have been made in opposition to the genius\r\nof its government, which is that of following precedents. It is from\r\nthe enterprise and industry of the individuals, and their numerous\r\nassociations, in which, tritely speaking, government is neither pillow\r\nnor bolster, that these improvements have proceeded. No man thought\r\nabout government, or who was in, or who was out, when he was planning\r\nor executing those things; and all he had to hope, with respect to\r\ngovernment, was, that it would let him alone. Three or four very silly\r\nministerial newspapers are continually offending against the spirit of\r\nnational improvement, by ascribing it to a minister. They may with as\r\nmuch truth ascribe this book to a minister.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: With respect to the two houses, of which the English parliament is\r\ncomposed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a\r\nlegislature, to have no temper of its own. The minister, whoever he\r\nat any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it sleeps\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nBut if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses, the\r\ndifference will appear so great, as to show the inconsistency of\r\nplacing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use\r\nit. Wretched as the state of representation is in England, it is manhood\r\ncompared with what is called the house of Lords; and so little is this\r\nnick-named house regarded, that the people scarcely enquire at any time\r\nwhat it is doing. It appears also to be most under influence, and the\r\nfurthest removed from the general interest of the nation. In the debate\r\non engaging in the Russian and Turkish war, the majority in the house\r\nof peers in favor of it was upwards of ninety, when in the other house,\r\nwhich was more than double its numbers, the majority was sixty-three.]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings on Mr. Fox's bill, respecting the rights of juries,\r\nmerits also to be noticed. The persons called the peers were not the\r\nobjects of that bill. They are already in possession of more privileges\r\nthan that bill gave to others. They are their own jury, and if any one\r\nof that house were prosecuted for a libel, he would not suffer, even\r\nupon conviction, for the first offense. Such inequality in laws ought\r\nnot to exist in any country. The French constitution says, that the law\r\nis the same to every individual, whether to Protect or to punish. All\r\nare equal in its sight.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: As to the state of representation in England, it is too absurd to\r\nbe reasoned upon. Almost all the represented parts are decreasing\r\nin population, and the unrepresented parts are increasing. A general\r\nconvention of the nation is necessary to take the whole form of\r\ngovernment into consideration.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: It is related that in the canton of Berne, in Switzerland, it has\r\nbeen customary, from time immemorial, to keep a bear at the public\r\nexpense, and the people had been taught to believe that if they had not\r\na bear they should all be undone. It happened some years ago that the\r\nbear, then in being, was taken sick, and died too suddenly to have his\r\nplace immediately supplied with another. During this interregnum the\r\npeople discovered that the corn grew, and the vintage flourished, and\r\nthe sun and moon continued to rise and set, and everything went on\r\nthe same as before, and taking courage from these circumstances, they\r\nresolved not to keep any more bears; for, said they, \"a bear is a very\r\nvoracious expensive animal, and we were obliged to pull out his claws,\r\nlest he should hurt the citizens.\" The story of the bear of Berne was\r\nrelated in some of the French newspapers, at the time of the flight of\r\nLouis Xvi., and the application of it to monarchy could not be mistaken\r\nin France; but it seems that the aristocracy of Berne applied it to\r\nthemselves, and have since prohibited the reading of French newspapers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: It is scarcely possible to touch on any subject, that will not\r\nsuggest an allusion to some corruption in governments. The simile of\r\n\"fortifications,\" unfortunately involves with it a circumstance, which\r\nis directly in point with the matter above alluded to.]\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous instances of abuse which have been acted or protected\r\nby governments, ancient or modern, there is not a greater than that of\r\nquartering a man and his heirs upon the public, to be maintained at its\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nHumanity dictates a provision for the poor; but by what right, moral or\r\npolitical, does any government assume to say, that the person called\r\nthe Duke of Richmond, shall be maintained by the public? Yet, if\r\ncommon report is true, not a beggar in London can purchase his wretched\r\npittance of coal, without paying towards the civil list of the Duke of\r\nRichmond. Were the whole produce of this imposition but a shilling a\r\nyear, the iniquitous principle would be still the same; but when it\r\namounts, as it is said to do, to no less than twenty thousand pounds per\r\nannum, the enormity is too serious to be permitted to remain. This is\r\none of the effects of monarchy and aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIn stating this case I am led by no personal dislike. Though I think\r\nit mean in any man to live upon the public, the vice originates in the\r\ngovernment; and so general is it become, that whether the parties are in\r\nthe ministry or in the opposition, it makes no difference: they are sure\r\nof the guarantee of each other.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: In America the increase of commerce is greater in proportion than in\r\nEngland. It is, at this time, at least one half more than at any period\r\nprior to the revolution. The greatest number of vessels cleared out\r\nof the port of Philadelphia, before the commencement of the war, was\r\nbetween eight and nine hundred. In the year 1788, the number was upwards\r\nof twelve hundred. As the State of Pennsylvania is estimated at an\r\neighth part of the United States in population, the whole number of\r\nvessels must now be nearly ten thousand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: When I saw Mr. Pitt's mode of estimating the balance of trade, in\r\none of his parliamentary speeches, he appeared to me to know nothing\r\nof the nature and interest of commerce; and no man has more wantonly\r\ntortured it than himself. During a period of peace it has been havocked\r\nwith the calamities of war. Three times has it been thrown into\r\nstagnation, and the vessels unmanned by impressing, within less than\r\nfour years of peace.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Rev. William Knowle, master of the grammar school of Thetford, in\r\nNorfolk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Politics and self-interest have been so uniformly connected that\r\nthe world, from being so often deceived, has a right to be suspicious of\r\npublic characters, but with regard to myself I am perfectly easy on\r\nthis head. I did not, at my first setting out in public life, nearly\r\nseventeen years ago, turn my thoughts to subjects of government from\r\nmotives of interest, and my conduct from that moment to this proves the\r\nfact. I saw an opportunity in which I thought I could do some good, and\r\nI followed exactly what my heart dictated. I neither read books, nor\r\nstudied other people's opinion. I thought for myself. The case was\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\nDuring the suspension of the old governments in America, both prior to\r\nand at the breaking out of hostilities, I was struck with the order and\r\ndecorum with which everything was conducted, and impressed with the idea\r\nthat a little more than what society naturally performed was all the\r\ngovernment that was necessary, and that monarchy and aristocracy were\r\nfrauds and impositions upon mankind. On these principles I published the\r\npamphlet Common Sense. The success it met with was beyond anything since\r\nthe invention of printing. I gave the copyright to every state in the\r\nUnion, and the demand ran to not less than one hundred thousand copies.\r\nI continued the subject in the same manner, under the title of The\r\nCrisis, till the complete establishment of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAfter the declaration of independence Congress unanimously, and unknown\r\nto me, appointed me Secretary in the Foreign Department. This was\r\nagreeable to me, because it gave me the opportunity of seeing into the\r\nabilities of foreign courts, and their manner of doing business. But\r\na misunderstanding arising between Congress and me, respecting one of\r\ntheir commissioners then in Europe, Mr. Silas Deane, I resigned the\r\noffice, and declined at the same time the pecuniary offers made by the\r\nMinisters of France and Spain, M. Gerald and Don Juan Mirralles.]\r\nI had by this time so completely gained the ear and confidence of\r\nAmerica, and my own independence was become so visible, as to give me a\r\nrange in political writing beyond, perhaps, what any man ever possessed\r\nin any country, and, what is more extraordinary, I held it undiminished\r\nto the end of the war, and enjoy it in the same manner to the present\r\nmoment. As my object was not myself, I set out with the determination,\r\nand happily with the disposition, of not being moved by praise or\r\ncensure, friendship or calumny, nor of being drawn from my purpose by\r\nany personal altercation, and the man who cannot do this is not fit for\r\na public character.\r\n\r\nWhen the war ended I went from Philadelphia to Borden-Town, on the east\r\nbank of the Delaware, where I have a small place. Congress was at this\r\ntime at Prince-Town, fifteen miles distant, and General Washington\r\nhad taken his headquarters at Rocky Hill, within the neighbourhood of\r\nCongress, for the purpose of resigning up his commission (the object\r\nfor which he accepted it being accomplished), and of retiring to private\r\nlife. While he was on this business he wrote me the letter which I here\r\nsubjoin:\r\n\r\n\"Rocky-Hill, Sept. 10, 1783.\r\n\r\n\"I have learned since I have been at this place that you are at\r\nBorden-Town. Whether for the sake of retirement or economy I know not.\r\nBe it for either, for both, or whatever it may, if you will come to this\r\nplace, and partake with me, I shall be exceedingly happy to see you at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Your presence may remind Congress of your past services to this\r\ncountry, and if it is in my power to impress them, command my best\r\nexertions with freedom, as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who\r\nentertains a lively sense of the importance of your works, and who, with\r\nmuch pleasure, subscribes himself, Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\nG. Washington.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the war, in the latter end of the year 1780, I formed to myself a\r\ndesign of coming over to England, and communicated it to General Greene,\r\nwho was then in Philadelphia on his route to the southward, General\r\nWashington being then at too great a distance to communicate with\r\nimmediately. I was strongly impressed with the idea that if I could get\r\nover to England without being known, and only remain in safety till I\r\ncould get out a publication, that I could open the eyes of the country\r\nwith respect to the madness and stupidity of its Government. I saw that\r\nthe parties in Parliament had pitted themselves as far as they could go,\r\nand could make no new impressions on each other. General Greene entered\r\nfully into my views, but the affair of Arnold and Andre happening just\r\nafter, he changed his mind, under strong apprehensions for my safety,\r\nwrote very pressingly to me from Annapolis, in Maryland, to give up\r\nthe design, which, with some reluctance, I did. Soon after this I\r\naccompanied Colonel Lawrens, son of Mr. Lawrens, who was then in the\r\nTower, to France on business from Congress. We landed at L'orient, and\r\nwhile I remained there, he being gone forward, a circumstance occurred\r\nthat renewed my former design. An English packet from Falmouth to\r\nNew York, with the Government dispatches on board, was brought into\r\nL'orient. That a packet should be taken is no extraordinary thing, but\r\nthat the dispatches should be taken with it will scarcely be credited,\r\nas they are always slung at the cabin window in a bag loaded with\r\ncannon-ball, and ready to be sunk at a moment. The fact, however, is\r\nas I have stated it, for the dispatches came into my hands, and I\r\nread them. The capture, as I was informed, succeeded by the following\r\nstratagem:--The captain of the \"Madame\" privateer, who spoke English, on\r\ncoming up with the packet, passed himself for the captain of an English\r\nfrigate, and invited the captain of the packet on board, which, when\r\ndone, he sent some of his own hands back, and he secured the mail. But\r\nbe the circumstance of the capture what it may, I speak with certainty\r\nas to the Government dispatches. They were sent up to Paris to Count\r\nVergennes, and when Colonel Lawrens and myself returned to America we\r\ntook the originals to Congress.\r\n\r\nBy these dispatches I saw into the stupidity of the English Cabinet far\r\nmore than I otherwise could have done, and I renewed my former design.\r\nBut Colonel Lawrens was so unwilling to return alone, more especially\r\nas, among other matters, we had a charge of upwards of two hundred\r\nthousand pounds sterling in money, that I gave in to his wishes, and\r\nfinally gave up my plan. But I am now certain that if I could have\r\nexecuted it that it would not have been altogether unsuccessful.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: It is difficult to account for the origin of charter and corporation\r\ntowns, unless we suppose them to have arisen out of, or been connected\r\nwith, some species of garrison service. The times in which they began\r\njustify this idea. The generality of those towns have been garrisons,\r\nand the corporations were charged with the care of the gates of the\r\ntowns, when no military garrison was present. Their refusing or granting\r\nadmission to strangers, which has produced the custom of giving,\r\nselling, and buying freedom, has more of the nature of garrison\r\nauthority than civil government. Soldiers are free of all corporations\r\nthroughout the nation, by the same propriety that every soldier is\r\nfree of every garrison, and no other persons are. He can follow any\r\nemployment, with the permission of his officers, in any corporation\r\ntowns throughout the nation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: See Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue. The land-tax in 1646\r\nwas L2,473,499.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Several of the court newspapers have of late made frequent mention\r\nof Wat Tyler. That his memory should be traduced by court sycophants and\r\nan those who live on the spoil of a public is not to be wondered at. He\r\nwas, however, the means of checking the rage and injustice of taxation\r\nin his time, and the nation owed much to his valour. The history is\r\nconcisely this:--In the time of Richard Ii. a poll tax was levied of one\r\nshilling per head upon every person in the nation of whatever estate or\r\ncondition, on poor as well as rich, above the age of fifteen years. If\r\nany favour was shown in the law it was to the rich rather than to the\r\npoor, as no person could be charged more than twenty shillings for\r\nhimself, family and servants, though ever so numerous; while all other\r\nfamilies, under the number of twenty were charged per head. Poll taxes\r\nhad always been odious, but this being also oppressive and unjust, it\r\nexcited as it naturally must, universal detestation among the poor and\r\nmiddle classes. The person known by the name of Wat Tyler, whose proper\r\nname was Walter, and a tiler by trade, lived at Deptford. The gatherer\r\nof the poll tax, on coming to his house, demanded tax for one of\r\nhis daughters, whom Tyler declared was under the age of fifteen. The\r\ntax-gatherer insisted on satisfying himself, and began an indecent\r\nexamination of the girl, which, enraging the father, he struck him with\r\na hammer that brought him to the ground, and was the cause of his\r\ndeath. This circumstance served to bring the discontent to an issue. The\r\ninhabitants of the neighbourhood espoused the cause of Tyler, who in a\r\nfew days was joined, according to some histories, by upwards of fifty\r\nthousand men, and chosen their chief. With this force he marched\r\nto London, to demand an abolition of the tax and a redress of other\r\ngrievances. The Court, finding itself in a forlorn condition, and,\r\nunable to make resistance, agreed, with Richard at its head, to hold\r\na conference with Tyler in Smithfield, making many fair professions,\r\ncourtier-like, of its dispositions to redress the oppressions. While\r\nRichard and Tyler were in conversation on these matters, each being on\r\nhorseback, Walworth, then Mayor of London, and one of the creatures of\r\nthe Court, watched an opportunity, and like a cowardly assassin, stabbed\r\nTyler with a dagger, and two or three others falling upon him, he\r\nwas instantly sacrificed. Tyler appears to have been an intrepid\r\ndisinterested man with respect to himself. All his proposals made to\r\nRichard were on a more just and public ground than those which had\r\nbeen made to John by the Barons, and notwithstanding the sycophancy of\r\nhistorians and men like Mr. Burke, who seek to gloss over a base action\r\nof the Court by traducing Tyler, his fame will outlive their falsehood.\r\nIf the Barons merited a monument to be erected at Runnymede, Tyler\r\nmerited one in Smithfield.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: I happened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of\r\nthe Revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have always\r\nappeared to be detestable; the one seeking to destroy his uncle, and\r\nthe other her father, to get possession of power themselves; yet, as\r\nthe nation was disposed to think something of that event, I felt hurt at\r\nseeing it ascribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken\r\nit as a job and who, besides what he otherwise got, charged six hundred\r\nthousand pounds for the expense of the fleet that brought him from\r\nHolland. George the First acted the same close-fisted part as William\r\nhad done, and bought the Duchy of Bremen with the money he got from\r\nEngland, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds over and above his pay as\r\nking, and having thus purchased it at the expense of England, added it\r\nto his Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit. In fact, every\r\nnation that does not govern itself is governed as a job. England has\r\nbeen the prey of jobs ever since the Revolution.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Charles, like his predecessors and successors, finding that war was\r\nthe harvest of governments, engaged in a war with the Dutch, the expense\r\nof which increased the annual expenditure to L1,800,000 as stated under\r\nthe date of 1666; but the peace establishment was but L1,200,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Poor-rates began about the time of Henry VIII., when the taxes began\r\nto increase, and they have increased as the taxes increased ever since.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Reckoning the taxes by families, five to a family, each family pays\r\non an average L12 7s. 6d. per annum. To this sum are to be added the\r\npoor-rates. Though all pay taxes in the articles they consume, all do\r\nnot pay poor-rates. About two millions are exempted: some as not being\r\nhouse-keepers, others as not being able, and the poor themselves\r\nwho receive the relief. The average, therefore, of poor-rates on the\r\nremaining number, is forty shillings for every family of five persons,\r\nwhich make the whole average amount of taxes and rates L14 17s. 6d. For\r\nsix persons L17 17s. For seven persons L2O 16s. 6d.\r\nThe average of taxes in America, under the new or representative system\r\nof government, including the interest of the debt contracted in the\r\nwar, and taking the population at four millions of souls, which it now\r\namounts to, and it is daily increasing, is five shillings per head,\r\nmen, women, and children. The difference, therefore, between the two\r\ngovernments is as under:\r\n\r\n                                        England      America\r\n                                      L    s.  d.

Education, to be useful to the poor, should be on the\r\nspot, and the best method, I believe, to accomplish this is to enable\r\nthe parents to pay the expenses themselves. There are always persons of\r\nboth sexes to be found in every village, especially when growing into\r\nyears, capable of such an undertaking. Twenty children at ten shillings\r\neach (and that not more than six months each year) would be as much as\r\nsome livings amount to in the remotest parts of England, and there are\r\noften distressed clergymen's widows to whom such an income would be\r\nacceptable. Whatever is given on this account to children answers two\r\npurposes. To them it is education--to those who educate them it is a\r\nlivelihood.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: The tax on beer brewed for sale, from which the aristocracy are\r\nexempt, is almost one million more than the present commutation tax,\r\nbeing by the returns of 1788, L1,666,152--and, consequently, they ought\r\nto take on themselves the amount of the commutation tax, as they are\r\nalready exempted from one which is almost a million greater.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: See the Reports on the Corn Trade.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: When enquiries are made into the condition of the poor, various\r\ndegrees of distress will most probably be found, to render a different\r\narrangement preferable to that which is already proposed.

They have found out,\r\nthat as wisdom cannot be made hereditary, power ought not; and that, for\r\na man to merit a million sterling a year from a nation, he ought to have\r\na mind capable of comprehending from an atom to a universe, which, if he\r\nhad, he would be above receiving the pay. But they wished not to appear\r\nto lead the nation faster than its own reason and interest dictated. In\r\nall the conversations where I have been present upon this subject, the\r\nidea always was, that when such a time, from the general opinion of the\r\nnation, shall arrive, that the honourable and liberal method would be,\r\nto make a handsome present in fee simple to the person, whoever he may\r\nbe, that shall then be in the monarchical office, and for him to retire\r\nto the enjoyment of private life, possessing his share of general rights\r\nand privileges, and to be no more accountable to the public for his time\r\nand his conduct than any other citizen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The gentleman who signed the address and declaration as chairman of\r\nthe meeting, Mr. Horne Tooke, being generally supposed to be the person\r\nwho drew it up, and having spoken much in commendation of it, has\r\nbeen jocularly accused of praising his own work. To free him from this\r\nembarrassment, and to save him the repeated trouble of mentioning the\r\nauthor, as he has not failed to do, I make no hesitation in saying,\r\nthat as the opportunity of benefiting by the French Revolution easily\r\noccurred to me, I drew up the publication in question, and showed it to\r\nhim and some other gentlemen, who, fully approving it, held a meeting\r\nfor the purpose of making it public, and subscribed to the amount of\r\nfifty guineas to defray the expense of advertising. I believe there\r\nare at this time, in England, a greater number of men acting on\r\ndisinterested principles, and determined to look into the nature and\r\npractices of government themselves, and not blindly trust, as\r\nhas hitherto been the case, either to government generally, or to\r\nparliaments, or to parliamentary opposition, than at any former period.\r\nHad this been done a century ago, corruption and taxation had not\r\narrived to the height they are now at.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          -END OF PART II.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Paine\r\n\r\nEdited By Moncure Daniel Conway\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME III.\r\n\r\n1791-1804\r\n\r\nG.

Permit me, my dear General, to offer you a picture\r\nrepresenting the Bastille as it was some days after I gave the order for\r\nits demolition. I also pay you the homage of sending you the principal\r\nKey of that fortress of despotism. It is a tribute I owe as a son to\r\nmy adoptive father, as aide-de-camp to my General, as a missionary of\r\nliberty to his Patriarch.\"\r\n\r\nThe Key was entrusted to Paine, and by him to J. Rut-ledge, Jr., who\r\nsailed from London in May. I have found in the manuscript despatches of\r\nLouis Otto, Chargé d' Affaires, several amusing paragraphs, addressed to\r\nhis govern-ment at Paris, about this Key.\r\n\r\n\"August 4, 1790. In attending yesterday the public audience of the\r\nPresident, I was surprised by a question from the Chief Magistrate,\r\n'whether I would like to see the Key of the Bastille?' One of his\r\nsecretaries showed me at the same moment a large Key, which had\r\nbeen sent to the President by desire of the Marquis de la Fayette. I\r\ndissembled my surprise in observing to the President that 'the time had\r\nnot yet come in America to do ironwork equal to that before him.'\r\nThe Americans present looked at the key with indifference, and as if\r\nwondering why it had been sent But the serene face of the President\r\nshowed that he regarded it as an homage from the French nation.\"\r\n\"December 13, 1790. The Key of the Bastille, regularly shown at the\r\nPresident's audiences, is now also on exhibition in Mrs. Washington's\r\n_salon_, where it satisfies the curiosity of the Philadelphians. I am\r\npersuaded, Monseigneur, that it is only their vanity that finds pleasure\r\nin the exhibition of this trophy, but Frenchmen here are not the less\r\npiqued, and many will not enter the President's house on this account.\"\r\n\r\nIn sending the key Paine, who saw farther than these distant Frenchmen,\r\nwrote to Washington: \"That the principles of America opened the Bastille\r\nis not to be doubted, and therefore the Key comes to the right place.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in May, 1791 (the exact date is not given), Lafayette writes\r\nWashington: \"I send you the rather indifferent translation of Mr. Paine\r\nas a kind of preservative and to keep me near you.\" This was a hasty\r\ntranslation of \"Rights of Man,\" Part I., by F. Soûles, presently\r\nsuperseded by that of Lanthenas.\r\n\r\nThe first convert of Paine to pure republicanism in France was Achille\r\nDuchâtelet, son of the Duke, and grandson of the authoress,--the friend\r\nof Voltaire. It was he and Paine who, after the flight of Louis XVI.,\r\nplacarded Paris with the Proclamation of a Republic, given as the first\r\nchapter of this volume. An account of this incident is here quoted from\r\nEtienne Dumont's \"Recollections of Mirabeau\":\r\n\r\n\"The celebrated Paine was at this time in Paris, and intimate in\r\nCondorcet's family. Thinking that he had effected the American\r\nRevolution, he fancied himself called upon to bring about one in France.\r\nDuchâtelet called on me, and after a little preface placed in my hand an\r\nEnglish manuscript--a Proclamation to the French People. It was nothing\r\nless than an anti-royalist Manifesto, and summoned the nation to\r\nseize the opportunity and establish a Republic. Paine was its author.\r\nDuchâtelet had adopted and was resolved to sign, placard the walls of\r\nParis with it, and take the consequences. He had come to request me to\r\ntranslate and develop it. I began discussing the strange proposal,\r\nand pointed out the danger of raising a republican standard without\r\nconcurrence of the National Assembly, and nothing being as yet known\r\nof the king's intentions, resources, alliances, and possibilities of\r\nsupport by the army, and in the provinces. I asked if he had consulted\r\nany of the most influential leaders,--Sieves, Lafayette, etc. He had\r\nnot: he and Paine had acted alone. An American and an impulsive nobleman\r\nhad put themselves forward to change the whole governmental system\r\nof France. Resisting his entreaties, I refused to translate the\r\nProclamation. Next day the republican Proclamation appeared on the walls\r\nin every part of Paris, and was denounced to the Assembly. The idea of\r\na Republic had previously presented itself to no one: this first\r\nintimation filled with consternation the Right and the moderates of the\r\nLeft. Malouet, Cazales, and others proposed prosecution of the author,\r\nbut Chapelier, and a numerous party, fearing to add fuel to the fire\r\ninstead of extinguishing it, prevented this. But some of the seed sown\r\nby the audacious hand of Paine were now budding in leading minds.\"\r\n\r\nA Republican Club was formed in July, consisting of five members, the\r\nothers who joined themselves to Paine and Duchâtelet being Condorcet,\r\nand probably Lanthenas (translator of Paine's works), and Nicolas de\r\nBonneville. They advanced so far as to print \"Le Républicain,\" of which,\r\nhowever, only one number ever appeared. From it is taken the second\r\npiece in this volume.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1792 Paine lodged in the house and book-shop of Thomas\r\n\"Clio\" Rickman, now as then 7 Upper Marylebone Street. Among his friends\r\nwas the mystical artist and poet, William Blake. Paine had become to\r\nhim a transcendental type; he is one of the Seven who appear in Blake's\r\n\"Prophecy\" concerning America (1793):\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent\r\n  Sullen fires across the Atlantic glow to America's shore;\r\n  Piercing the souls of warlike men, who rise in silent night:--\r\n  Washington, Franklin, Paine, and Warren, Gates, Hancock, and Greene,\r\n  Meet on the coast glowing with blood from Albion's fiery Prince.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seven are wrapt in the flames of their enthusiasm. Albion's Prince\r\nsends to America his thirteen Angels, who, however, there become\r\nGovernors of the thirteen States. It is difficult to discover from\r\nBlake's mystical visions how much political radicalism was in him, but\r\nhe certainly saved Paine from the scaffold by forewarning him (September\r\n13, 1792) that an order had been issued for his arrest. Without\r\nrepeating the story told in Gilchrist's \"Life of Blake,\" and in my \"Life\r\nof Paine,\" I may add here my belief that Paine also appears in one of\r\nBlake's pictures. The picture is in the National Gallery (London), and\r\ncalled \"The spiritual form of Pitt guiding Behemoth.\" The monster jaws\r\nof Behemoth are full of struggling men, some of whom stretch imploring\r\nhands to another spiritual form, who reaches down from a crescent\r\nmoon in the sky, as if to rescue them. This face and form appear to me\r\ncertainly meant for Paine.\r\n\r\nActing on Blake's warning Paine's friends got him off to Dover, where,\r\nafter some trouble, related in a letter to Dundas (see p. 41 of this\r\nvolume), he reached Calais. He had been elected by four departments to\r\nthe National Convention, and selected Calais, where he was welcomed\r\nwith grand civic parades. On September 19, 1792, he arrived in Paris,\r\nstopping at \"White's Hotel,\" 7 Passage des Pétits Pères, about five\r\nminutes' walk from the Salle de Manége, where, on September 21st, the\r\nNational Convention opened its sessions. The spot is now indicated by a\r\ntablet on the wall of the Tuileries Garden, Rue de Rivoli. On that\r\nday Paine was introduced to the Convention by the Abbé Grégoire, and\r\nreceived with acclamation.\r\n\r\nThe French Minister in London, Chauvelin, had sent to his government\r\n(still royalist) a despatch unfavorable to Paine's work in England, part\r\nof which I translate:\r\n\r\n\"May 23, 1792. An Association [for Parliamentary Reform, see pp. 78,\r\n93, of this volume] has been formed to seek the means of forwarding the\r\ndemand. It includes some distinguished members of the Commons, and a few\r\npeers. The writings of M. Payne which preceded this Association by a\r\nfew days have done it infinite harm. People suspect under the veil of\r\na reform long demanded by justice and reason an intention to destroy a\r\nconstitution equally dear to the peers whose privileges it consecrates,\r\nto the wealthy whom it protects, and to the entire nation, to which\r\nit assures all the liberty desired by a people methodical and slow in\r\ncharacter, and who, absorbed in their commercial interests, do not\r\nlike being perpetually worried about the imbecile George III. or public\r\naffairs. Vainly have the friends of reform protested their attachment\r\nto the Constitution. Vainly they declare that they desire to demand\r\nnothing, to obtain nothing, save in lawful ways. They are persistently\r\ndisbelieved. Payne alone is seen in all their movements; and this author\r\nhas not, like Mackintosh, rendered imposing his refutation of Burke. The\r\nmembers of the Association, although very different in principles, find\r\nthemselves involved in the now almost general disgrace of Payne.\"\r\n\r\nM. Noël writes from London, November 2, 1792, to the republican\r\nMinister, Le Brun, concerning the approaching trial of Paine, which had\r\nbeen fixed for December 18th.\r\n\r\n\"This matter above all excites the liveliest interest. People desire\r\nto know whether they live in a free country, where criticism even of\r\ngovernment is a right of every citizen. Whatever may be the decision in\r\nthis interesting trial, the result can only be fortunate for the cause\r\nof liberty. But the government cannot conceal from itself that it is\r\nsuspended over a volcano. The wild dissipations of the King's sons\r\nadd to the discontent, and if something is overlooked in the Prince of\r\nWales, who is loved enough, it is not so with the Duke of York, who\r\nhas few friends. The latter has so many debts that at this moment the\r\nreceivers are in his house, and the creditors wish even his bed to be\r\nseized. You perceive, Citizen, what a text fruitful in reflexions this\r\nconduct presents to a people groaning under the weight of taxes for the\r\nsupport of such whelps (_louvetaux_).\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of December 22, 1792, M. Noël writes:\r\n\r\n\"London is perfectly tranquil. The arbitrary measures taken by the\r\ngovernment in advance [of Paine's trial] cause no anxiety to the mass\r\nof the nation about its liberties. Some dear-headed people see well that\r\nthe royal prerogative will gain in this crisis, and that it is dangerous\r\nto leave executive power to become arbitrary at pleasure; but this very\r\nsmall number groan in silence, and dare not speak for fear of seeing\r\ntheir property pillaged or burned by what the miserable hirelings\r\nof government call 'Loyal Mob,' or 'Church and King Mob.' To the\r\n'Addressers,' of whom I wrote you, are added the associations for\r\nmaintaining the Constitution they are doing all they can to destroy.\r\nThere is no corporation, no parish, which is not mustered for this\r\nobject. All have assembled, one on the other, to press against\r\nthose whom they call 'The Republicans and the Levellers,' the most\r\ninquisitorial measures. Among other parishes, one (S. James' Vestry\r\nRoom) distinguishes itself by a decree worthy of the sixteenth century.\r\nIt promises twenty guineas reward to any one who shall denounce those\r\nwho in conversation or otherwise propagate opinions contrary to the\r\npublic tranquillity, and places the denouncer under protection of the\r\nparish. The inhabitants of London are now placed under a new kind of\r\n_Test_, and those who refuse it will undoubtedly be persecuted. Meantime\r\nthese papers are carried from house to house to be signed, especially by\r\nthose lodging as strangers. This _Test_ causes murmurs, and some try to\r\nevade signature, but the number is few. The example of the capital is\r\ngenerally followed. The trial of Payne, which at one time seemed likely\r\nto cause events, has ended in the most peaceful way. Erskine has been\r\nborne to his house by people shouting _God Save the King! Erskine\r\nforever!_ The friends of liberty generally are much dissatisfied with\r\nthe way in which he has defended his client. They find that he threw\r\nhimself into commonplaces which could make his eloquence shine, but\r\nguarded himself well from going to the bottom of the question. Vane\r\nespecially, a distinguished advocate and zealous democrat, is furious\r\nagainst Erskine. It is now for Payne to defend himself. But whatever\r\nhe does, he will have trouble enough to reverse the opinion. The Jury's\r\nverdict is generally applauded: a mortal blow is dealt to freedom of\r\nthought. People sing in the streets, even at midnight, _God save the\r\nKing and damn Tom Payne!_\" (1)\r\n\r\n     1 The despatches from which these translations are made are\r\n     in the Archives of the Department of State at Paris, series\r\n     marked _Angleterre_ vol. 581.\r\n\r\nThe student of that period will find some instruction in a collection,\r\nnow in the British Museum, of coins and medals mostly struck after the\r\ntrial and outlawry of Paine. A halfpenny, January 21,1793: _obverse_,\r\na man hanging on a gibbet, with church in the distance; motto \"End of\r\nPain\"; _reverse_, open book inscribed \"The Wrongs of Man.\" A token: bust\r\nof Paine, with his name; _reverse_, \"The Mountain in Labour, 1793.\"\r\nFarthing: Paine gibbeted; _reverse_, breeches burning, legend,\r\n\"Pandora's breeches\"; beneath, serpent decapitated by a dagger,\r\nthe severed head that of Paine. Similar farthing, but _reverse_,\r\ncombustibles intermixed with labels issuing from a globe marked\r\n\"Fraternity\"; the labels inscribed \"Regicide,\" \"Robbery,\" \"Falsity,\"\r\n\"Requisition\"; legend, \"French Reforms, 1797\"; near by, a church with\r\nflag, on it a cross. Half-penny without date, but no doubt struck in\r\n1794, when a rumor reached London that Paine had been guillotined:\r\nPaine gibbeted; above, devil smoking a pipe; _reverse_, monkey dancing;\r\nlegend, \"We dance, Paine swings.\" Farthing: three men hanging on a\r\ngallows; \"The three Thomases, 1796.\" _Reverse_, \"May the three knaves\r\nof Jacobin Clubs never get a trick.\" The three Thomases were Thomas\r\nPaine, Thomas Muir, and Thomas Spence. In 1794 Spence was imprisoned\r\nseven months for publishing some of Paine's works at his so-called\r\n\"Hive of Liberty.\" Muir, a Scotch lawyer, was banished to Botany Bay for\r\nfourteen years for having got up in Edinburgh (1792) a \"Convention,\" in\r\nimitation of that just opened in Paris; two years later he escaped from\r\nBotany Bay on an American ship, and found his way to Paine in Paris.\r\nAmong these coins there are two of opposite character. A farthing\r\nrepresents Pitt on a gibbet, against which rests a ladder; inscription,\r\n\"End of P [here an eye] T.\" _Reverse_, face of Pitt conjoined with that\r\nof the devil, and legend, \"Even Fellows.\" Another farthing like the\r\nlast, except an added legend, \"Such is the reward of tyrants, 1796.\"\r\nThese anti-Pitt farthings were struck by Thomas Spence.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1792-3 the only Reign of Terror was in England. The\r\nMinistry had replied to Paine's \"Rights of Man\" by a royal proclamation\r\nagainst seditious literature, surrounding London with militia, and\r\ncalling a meeting of Parliament (December, 1792) out of season.\r\nEven before the trial of Paine his case was prejudged by the royal\r\nproclamation, and by the Addresses got up throughout the country in\r\nresponse,--documents which elicited Paine's Address to the Addressers,\r\nchapter IX. in this volume. The Tory gentry employed roughs to burn\r\nPaine in effigy throughout the country, and to harry the Nonconformists.\r\nDr. Priestley's house was gutted. Mr. Fox (December 14, 1792) reminded\r\nthe House of Commons that all the mobs had \"Church and King\" for their\r\nwatchword, no mob having been heard of for \"The Rights of Man\"; and\r\nhe vainly appealed to the government to prosecute the dangerous libels\r\nagainst Dissenters as they were prosecuting Paine's work. Burke, who in\r\nthe extra session of Parliament for the first time took his seat on the\r\nTreasury Bench, was reminded that he had once \"exulted at the victories\r\nof that rebel Washington,\" and welcomed Franklin. \"Franklin,\" he said,\r\n\"was a native of America; Paine was born in England, and lived under the\r\nprotection of our laws; but, instigated by his evil genius, he conspired\r\nagainst the very country which gave him birth, by attempting to\r\nintroduce the new and pernicious doctrines of republicans.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the same harangue, Burke alluded to the English and\r\nIrish deputations, then in Paris, which had congratulated the Convention\r\non the defeat of the invaders of the Republic. Among them he named\r\nLord Semphill, John Frost, D. Adams, and \"Joel--Joel the Prophet\" (Joel\r\nBarlow). These men were among those who, towards the close of 1792,\r\nformed a sort of Paine Club at \"Philadelphia House\"--as White's Hotel\r\nwas now called. The men gathered around Paine, as the exponent of\r\nrepublican principles, were animated by a passion for liberty which\r\nwithheld no sacrifice. Some of them threw away wealth and rank as\r\ntrifles. At a banquet of the Club, at Philadelphia House, November 18,\r\n1792, where Paine presided, Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Sir Robert Smyth,\r\nBaronet, formally renounced their titles. Sir Robert proposed the toast,\r\n\"A speedy abolition of all hereditary titles and feudal distinctions.\"\r\nAnother toast was, \"Paine--and the new way of making good books known by\r\na Royal proclamation and a King's Bench prosecution.\"\r\n\r\nThere was also Franklin's friend, Benjamin Vaughan, Member of\r\nParliament, who, compromised by an intercepted letter, took refuge in\r\nParis under the name of Jean Martin. Other Englishmen were Rev. Jeremiah\r\nJoyce, a Unitarian minister and author (coadjutor of Dr. Gregory in\r\nhis \"Cyclopaedia \"); Henry Redhead Yorke, a West Indian with some negro\r\nblood (afterwards an agent of Pitt, under whom he had been imprisoned);\r\nRobert Merry, husband of the actress \"Miss Brunton\"; Sayer, Rayment,\r\nMacdonald, Perry.\r\n\r\nSampson Perry of London, having attacked the government in his journal,\r\n\"The Argus,\" fled from an indictment, and reached Paris in January,\r\n1793. These men, who for a time formed at Philadelphia House their\r\nParliament of Man, were dashed by swift storms on their several rocks.\r\nSir Robert Smyth was long a prisoner under the Reign of Terror, and died\r\n(1802) of the illness thereby contracted. Lord Edward Fitzgerald was\r\nslain while trying to kindle a revolution in Ireland. Perry was a\r\nprisoner in the Luxembourg, and afterwards in London. John Frost, a\r\nlawyer (struck off the roll), ventured back to London, where he was\r\nimprisoned six months in Newgate, sitting in the pillory at Charing\r\nCross one hour per day. Robert Merry went to Baltimore, where he died\r\nin 1798. Nearly all of these men suffered griefs known only to the \"man\r\nwithout a country.\"\r\n\r\nSampson Perry, who in 1796 published an interesting \"History of the\r\nFrench Revolution,\" has left an account of his visit to Paine in\r\nJanuary, 1793:\r\n\r\n\"I breakfasted with Paine about this time at the Philadelphia Hotel, and\r\nasked him which province in America he conceived the best calculated\r\nfor a fugitive to settle in, and, as it were, to begin the world with no\r\nother means or pretensions than common sense and common honesty. Whether\r\nhe saw the occasion and felt the tendency of this question I know not;\r\nbut he turned it aside by the political news of the day, and added that\r\nhe was going to dine with Petion, the mayor, and that he knew I should\r\nbe welcome and be entertained. We went to the mayoralty in a hackney\r\ncoach, and were seated at a table about which were placed the following\r\npersons: Petion, the mayor of Paris, with his female relation who did\r\nthe honour of the table; Dumourier, the commander-in-chief of the French\r\nforces, and one of his aides-de-camp; Santerre, the commandant of the\r\narmed force of Paris, and an aide-de-camp; Condorcet; Brissot; Gaudet;\r\nGenson-net; Danton; Rersaint; Clavière; Vergniaud; and Syèyes; which,\r\nwith three other persons, whose names I do not now recollect, and\r\nincluding Paine and myself, made in all nineteen.\"\r\n\r\nPaine found warm welcome in the home of Achille Du-châtelet, who with\r\nhim had first proclaimed the Republic, and was now a General. Madame\r\nDuchâtelet was an English lady of rank, Charlotte Comyn, and English was\r\nfluently spoken in the family. They resided at Auteuil, not far from the\r\nAbbé Moulet, who preserved an arm-chair with the inscription, _Benjamin\r\nFranklin hic sedebat_, Paine was a guest of the Duchâtelets soon after\r\nhe got to work in the Convention, as I have just discovered by a letter\r\naddressed \"To Citizen Le Brun, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Auteuil, Friday, the 4th December, 1792. I enclose an Irish newspaper\r\nwhich has been sent me from Belfast. It contains the Address of the\r\nSociety of United Irishmen of Dublin (of which Society I am a member)\r\nto the volunteers of Ireland. None of the English newspapers that I have\r\nseen have ventured to republish this Address, and as there is no other\r\ncopy of it than this which I send you, I request you not to let it go\r\nout of your possession. Before I received this newspaper I had drawn up\r\na statement of the affairs of Ireland, which I had communicated to my\r\nfriend General Duchâtelet at Auteuil, where I now am. I wish to confer\r\nwith you on that subject, but as I do not speak French, and as the\r\nmatter requires confidence, General Duchâtelet has desired me to say\r\nthat if you can make it convenient to dine with him and me at Auteuil,\r\nhe will with pleasure do the office of interpreter. I send this letter\r\nby my servant, but as it may not be convenient to you to give an answer\r\ndirectly, I have told him not to wait--Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Paine now keeps his servant, and drives to the\r\nMayor's dinner in a hackney coach. A portrait painted in Paris about\r\nthis time, now owned by Mr. Alfred Howlett of Syracuse, N. Y., shows him\r\nin elegant costume.\r\n\r\nIt is mournful to reflect, even at this distance, that only a little\r\nlater both Paine and his friend General Duchâtelet were prisoners. The\r\nlatter poisoned himself in prison (1794).\r\n\r\nThe illustrative notes and documents which it seems best to set before\r\nthe reader at the outset may here terminate. As in the previous volumes\r\nthe writings are, as a rule, given in chronological sequence, but an\r\nexception is now made in respect of Paine's religious writings, some of\r\nwhich antedate essays in the present volume. The religious writings\r\nare reserved for the fourth and final volume, to which will be added\r\nan Appendix containing Paine's poems, scientific fragments, and several\r\nletters of general interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE REPUBLICAN PROCLAMATION.(1)\r\n\r\n\"Brethren and Fellow Citizens:\r\n\r\n\"The serene tranquillity, the mutual confidence which prevailed amongst\r\nus, during the time of the late King's escape, the indifference with\r\nwhich we beheld him return, are unequivocal proofs that the absence of\r\na King is more desirable than his presence, and that he is not only a\r\npolitical superfluity, but a grievous burden, pressing hard on the whole\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us not be imposed on by sophisms; all that concerns this is reduced\r\nto four points.\r\n\r\n\"He has abdicated the throne in having fled from his post. Abdication\r\nand desertion are not characterized by the length of absence; but by the\r\nsingle act of flight. In the present instance, the act is everything,\r\nand the time nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The nation can never give back its confidence to a man who, false to\r\nhis trust, perjured to his oath, conspires a clandestine flight, obtains\r\na fraudulent passport, conceals a King of France under the disguise of\r\na valet, directs his course towards a frontier covered with traitors\r\nand deserters, and evidently meditates a return into our country, with a\r\nforce capable of imposing his own despotic laws.\r\n\r\n\"Should his flight be considered as his own act, or the act of those\r\nwho fled with him? Was it a spontaneous resolution of his own, or was\r\nit inspired by others? The alternative is immaterial; whether fool or\r\nhypocrite, idiot or traitor, he has proved himself equally unworthy of\r\nthe important functions that had been delegated to him.\r\n\r\n     1 See Introduction to this volume. This manifesto with which\r\n     Paris was found placarded on July 1, 1791, is described by\r\n     Dumont as a \"Republican Proclamation,\" but what its literal\r\n     caption was I have not found.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n\"In every sense in which the question can be considered, the reciprocal\r\nobligation which subsisted between us is dissolved. He holds no longer\r\nany authority. We owe him no longer obedience. We see in him no more\r\nthan an indifferent person; we can regard him only as Louis Capet.\r\n\r\n\"The history of France presents little else than a long series of public\r\ncalamity, which takes its source from the vices of Kings; we have been\r\nthe wretched victims that have never ceased to suffer either for them\r\nor by them. The catalogue of their oppressions was complete, but to\r\ncomplete the sum of their crimes, treason was yet wanting. Now the\r\nonly vacancy is filled up, the dreadful list is full; the system is\r\nexhausted; there are no remaining errors for them to commit; their reign\r\nis consequently at an end.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of office must that be in a government which requires for its\r\nexecution neither experience nor ability, that may be abandoned to the\r\ndesperate chance of birth, that may be filled by an idiot, a madman, a\r\ntyrant, with equal effect as by the good, the virtuous, and the wise? An\r\noffice of this nature is a mere nonentity; it is a place of show, not of\r\nuse. Let France then, arrived at the age of reason, no longer be deluded\r\nby the sound of words, and let her deliberately examine, if a King,\r\nhowever insignificant and contemptible in himself, may not at the same\r\ntime be extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"The thirty millions which it costs to support a King in the eclat of\r\nstupid brutal luxury, presents us with an easy method of reducing taxes,\r\nwhich reduction would at once relieve the people, and stop the progress\r\nof political corruption. The grandeur of nations consists, not, as Kings\r\npretend, in the splendour of thrones, but in a conspicuous sense of\r\ntheir own dignity, and in a just disdain of those barbarous follies and\r\ncrimes which, under the sanction of Royalty, have hitherto desolated\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\"As to the personal safety of Louis Capet, it is so much the more\r\nconfirmed, as France will not stoop to degrade herself by a spirit of\r\nrevenge against a wretch who has dishonoured himself. In defending\r\na just and glorious cause, it is not possible to degrade it, and the\r\nuniversal tranquillity which prevails is an undeniable proof that a free\r\npeople know how to respect themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. TO THE AUTHORS OF \"LE RÉPUBLICAIN.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nM. Duchâtelet has mentioned to me the intention of some persons to\r\ncommence a work under the title of \"The Republican.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am a Citizen of a country which knows no other Majesty than that of\r\nthe People; no other Government than that of the Representative body;\r\nno other sovereignty than that of the Laws, and which is attached to\r\n_France_ both by alliance and by gratitude, I voluntarily offer you my\r\nservices in support of principles as honorable to a nation as they are\r\nadapted to promote the happiness of mankind. I offer them to you with\r\nthe more zeal, as I know the moral, literary, and political character\r\nof those who are engaged in the undertaking, and find myself honoured in\r\ntheir good opinion.\r\n\r\nBut I must at the same time observe, that from ignorance of the French\r\nlanguage, my works must necessarily undergo a translation; they can of\r\ncourse be of but little utility, and my offering must consist more of\r\nwishes than services. I must add, that I am obliged to pass a part of\r\nthis summer in England and Ireland.\r\n\r\nAs the public has done me the unmerited favor of recognizing me under\r\nthe appellation of \"Common Sense,\" which is my usual signature, I shall\r\ncontinue it in this publication to avoid mistakes, and to prevent\r\nmy being supposed the author of works not my own. As to my political\r\nprinciples, I shall endeavour, in this letter, to trace their general\r\nfeatures in such a manner, as that they cannot be misunderstood.\r\n\r\n     1 \"Le Républicain; ou le Défenseur du gouvernement\r\n     Représentatif. Par une Société des Républicains. A Paris.\r\n     July, 1791.\" See Introduction to this volume.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable in most instances to avoid that which may give even the\r\nleast suspicion as to the part meant to be adopted, and particularly\r\non the present occasion, where a perfect clearness of expression is\r\nnecessary to the avoidance of any possible misinterpretation. I am\r\nhappy, therefore, to find, that the work in question is entitled \"The\r\nRepublican.\" This word expresses perfectly the idea which we ought to\r\nhave of Government in general--_Res Publico_,--the public affairs of a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAs to the word _Monarchy_, though the address and intrigue of Courts\r\nhave rendered it familiar, it does not contain the less of reproach or\r\nof insult to a nation. The word, in its immediate or original sense,\r\nsignifies _the absolute power of a single individual_, who may prove\r\na fool, an hypocrite, or a tyrant. The appellation admits of no other\r\ninterpretation than that which is here given. France is therefore not a\r\n_Monarchy_; it is insulted when called by that name. The servile spirit\r\nwhich characterizes this species of government is banished from France,\r\nand this country, like AMERICA, can now afford to Monarchy no more than\r\na glance of disdain.\r\n\r\nOf the errors which monarchic ignorance or knavery has spread through\r\nthe world, the one which bears the marks of the most dexterous\r\ninvention, is the opinion that the system of _Republicanism_ is only\r\nadapted to a small country, and that a _Monarchy_ is suited, on the\r\ncontrary, to those of greater extent. Such is the language of Courts,\r\nand such the sentiments which they have caused to be adopted in\r\nmonarchic countries; but the opinion is contrary, at the same time, to\r\nprinciple and to experience.\r\n\r\nThe Government, to be of real use, should possess a complete knowledge\r\nof all the parties, all the circumstances, and all the interests of a\r\nnation. The monarchic system, in consequence, instead of being suited\r\nto a country of great extent, would be more admissible in a small\r\nterritory, where an individual may be supposed to know the affairs and\r\nthe interests of the whole. But when it is attempted to extend this\r\nindividual knowledge to the affairs of a great country, the capacity of\r\nknowing bears no longer any proportion to the extent or multiplicity of\r\nthe objects which ought to be known, and the government inevitably falls\r\nfrom ignorance into tyranny. For the proof of this position we need only\r\nlook to Spain, Russia, Germany, Turkey, and the whole of the Eastern\r\nContinent,--countries, for the deliverance of which I offer my most\r\nsincere wishes.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the true _Republican_ system, by Election and\r\nRepresentation, offers the only means which are known, and, in my\r\nopinion, the only means which are possible, of proportioning the wisdom\r\nand the information of a Government to the extent of a country.\r\n\r\nThe system of _Representation_ is the strongest and most powerful center\r\nthat can be devised for a nation. Its attraction acts so powerfully,\r\nthat men give it their approbation even without reasoning on the cause;\r\nand France, however distant its several parts, finds itself at this\r\nmoment _an whole_, in its _central_ Representation. The citizen is\r\nassured that his rights are protected, and the soldier feels that he\r\nis no longer the slave of a Despot, but that he is become one of the\r\nNation, and interested of course in its defence.\r\n\r\nThe states at present styled _Republican_, as Holland, Genoa, Venice,\r\nBerne, &c. are not only unworthy the name, but are actually in\r\nopposition to every principle of a _Republican_ government, and the\r\ncountries submitted to their power are, truly speaking, subject to an\r\n_Aristocratic_ slavery!\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, impossible, in the first steps which are made in a\r\nRevolution, to avoid all kind of error, in principle or in practice, or\r\nin some instances to prevent the combination of both. Before the sense\r\nof a nation is sufficiently enlightened, and before men have entered\r\ninto the habits of a free communication with each other of their natural\r\nthoughts, a certain reserve--a timid prudence seizes on the human mind,\r\nand prevents it from obtaining its level with that vigor and promptitude\r\nthat belongs to _right_.--An example of this influence discovers\r\nitself in the commencement of the present Revolution: but happily this\r\ndiscovery has been made before the Constitution was completed, and in\r\ntime to provide a remedy.\r\n\r\nThe _hereditary succession_ can never exist as a matter of _right_; it\r\nis a _nullity_--a _nothing_. To admit the idea is to regard man as a\r\nspecies of property belonging to some individuals, either born or to\r\nbe born! It is to consider our descendants, and all posterity, as mere\r\nanimals without a right or will! It is, in fine, the most base and\r\nhumiliating idea that ever degraded the human species, and which, for\r\nthe honor of Humanity, should be destroyed for ever.\r\n\r\nThe idea of hereditary succession is so contrary to the rights of man,\r\nthat if we were ourselves to be recalled to existence, instead of being\r\nreplaced by our posterity, we should not have the right of depriving\r\nourselves beforehand of those _rights_ which would then properly belong\r\nto us. On what ground, then, or by what authority, do we dare to deprive\r\nof their rights those children who will soon be men? Why are we not\r\nstruck with the injustice which we perpetrate on our descendants, by\r\nendeavouring to transmit them as a vile herd to masters whose vices are\r\nall that can be foreseen.\r\n\r\nWhenever the _French_ constitution shall be rendered conformable to its\r\n_Declaration of Rights_, we shall then be enabled to give to France, and\r\nwith justice, the appellation of a _civic Empire_; for its government\r\nwill be the empire of laws founded on the great republican principles\r\nof _Elective Representation_, and the _Rights of Man_.--But Monarchy\r\nand Hereditary Succession are incompatible with the _basis_ of its\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nI hope that I have at present sufficiently proved to you that I am\r\na good Republican; and I have such a confidence in the truth of the\r\nprinciples, that I doubt not they will soon be as universal in _France_\r\nas in _America_. The pride of human nature will assist their evidence,\r\nwill contribute to their establishment, and men will be ashamed of\r\nMonarchy.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, Gentlemen, your friend,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nParis, June, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. TO THE ABBÉ SIÈYES.(1)\r\n\r\nParis, 8th July, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAt the moment of my departure for England, I read, in the _Moniteur_\r\nof Tuesday last, your letter, in which you give the challenge, on\r\nthe subject of Government, and offer to defend what is called the\r\n_Monarchical opinion_ against the Republican system.\r\n\r\nI accept of your challenge with pleasure; and I place such a confidence\r\nin the superiority of the Republican system over that nullity of a\r\nsystem, called _Monarchy_, that I engage not to exceed the extent of\r\nfifty pages, and to leave you the liberty of taking as much latitude as\r\nyou may think proper.\r\n\r\nThe respect which I bear your moral and literary reputation, will be\r\nyour security for my candour in the course of this discussion; but,\r\nnotwithstanding that I shall treat the subject seriously and sincerely,\r\nlet me promise, that I consider myself at liberty to ridicule, as they\r\ndeserve, Monarchical absurdities, whensoever the occasion shall present\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBy Republicanism, I do not understand what the name signifies in\r\nHolland, and in some parts of Italy. I understand simply a government\r\nby representation--a government founded upon the principles of the\r\nDeclaration of Rights; principles to which several parts of the French\r\nConstitution arise in contradiction. The Declaration of Rights of France\r\nand America are but one and the same thing in principles, and almost in\r\nexpressions; and this is the Republicanism which I undertake to defend\r\nagainst what is called _Monarchy_ and _Aristocracy_.\r\n\r\n     1 Written to the _Moniteur_ in reply to a letter of the Abbé\r\n     (July 8) elicited by Paine's letter to \"Le Républicain\"\r\n     (II.). The Abbé now declining a controversy, Paine dealt\r\n     with his views in \"Rights of Man,\" Part IL, ch. 3.--\r\n     _Editor_.\r\n\r\nI see with pleasure that in respect to one point we are already agreed;\r\nand _that is, the extreme danger of a civil list of thirty millions_. I\r\ncan discover no reason why one of the parts of the government should\r\nbe supported with so extravagant a profusion, whilst the other scarcely\r\nreceives what is sufficient for its common wants.\r\n\r\nThis dangerous and dishonourable disproportion at once supplies the one\r\nwith the means of corrupting, and throws the other into the predicament\r\nof being corrupted. In America there is but little difference, with\r\nregard to this point, between the legislative and the executive part of\r\nour government; but the first is much better attended to than it is in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn whatsoever manner, Sir, I may treat the subject of which you\r\nhave proposed the investigation, I hope that you will not doubt my\r\nentertaining for you the highest esteem. I must also add, that I am not\r\nthe personal enemy of Kings. Quite the contrary. No man more heartily\r\nwishes than myself to see them all in the happy and honourable state of\r\nprivate individuals; but I am the avowed, open, and intrepid enemy of\r\nwhat is called Monarchy; and I am such by principles which nothing can\r\neither alter or corrupt--by my attachment to humanity; by the anxiety\r\nwhich I feel within myself, for the dignity and the honour of the human\r\nrace; by the disgust which I experience, when I observe men directed by\r\nchildren, and governed by brutes; by the horror which all the evils that\r\nMonarchy has spread over the earth excite within my breast; and by those\r\nsentiments which make me shudder at the calamities, the exactions, the\r\nwars, and the massacres with which Monarchy has crushed mankind: in\r\nshort, it is against all the hell of monarchy that I have declared war.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 To the sixth paragraph of the above letter is appended a\r\n     footnote: \"A deputy to the congress receives about a guinea\r\n     and a half daily: and provisions are cheaper in America\r\n     than in France.\" The American Declaration of Rights referred\r\n     to unless the Declaration of Independence, was no doubt,\r\n     especially that of Pennsylvania, which Paine helped to\r\n     frame.--Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Undated, but probably late in May, 1793.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThough I have some reason for believing that you were not the original\r\npromoter or encourager of the prosecution commenced against the work\r\nentitled \"Rights of Man\" either as that prosecution is intended to\r\naffect the author, the publisher, or the public; yet as you appear\r\nthe official person therein, I address this letter to you, not as Sir\r\nArchibald Macdonald, but as Attorney General.\r\n\r\nYou began by a prosecution against the publisher Jordan, and the reason\r\nassigned by Mr. Secretary Dundas, in the House of Commons, in the debate\r\non the Proclamation, May 25, for taking that measure, was, he said,\r\nbecause Mr. Paine could not be found, or words to that effect. Mr.\r\nPaine, sir, so far from secreting himself, never went a step out of his\r\nway, nor in the least instance varied from his usual conduct, to avoid\r\nany measure you might choose to adopt with respect to him. It is on the\r\npurity of his heart, and the universal utility of the principles and\r\nplans which his writings contain, that he rests the issue; and he will\r\nnot dishonour it by any kind of subterfuge. The apartments which he\r\noccupied at the time of writing the work last winter, he has continued\r\nto occupy to the present hour, and the solicitors of the prosecution\r\nknew where to find him; of which there is a proof in their own office,\r\nas far back as the 21st of May, and also in the office of my own\r\nAttorney.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine was residing at the house of one of his publishers,\r\n     Thomas Rickman, 7 Upper Marylebone Street, London. His\r\n     Attorney was the Hon. Thomas Erskine.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nBut admitting, for the sake of the case, that the reason for proceeding\r\nagainst the publisher was, as Mr. Dundas stated, that Mr. Paine could\r\nnot be found, that reason can now exist no longer.\r\n\r\nThe instant that I was informed that an information was preparing to be\r\nfiled against me, as the author of, I believe, one of the most useful\r\nand benevolent books ever offered to mankind, I directed my Attorney\r\nto put in an appearance; and as I shall meet the prosecution fully and\r\nfairly, and with a good and upright conscience, I have a right to\r\nexpect that no act of littleness will be made use of on the part of the\r\nprosecution towards influencing the future issue with respect to the\r\nauthor. This expression may, perhaps, appear obscure to you, but I am\r\nin the possession of some matters which serve to shew that the action\r\nagainst the publisher is not intended to be a _real_ action. If,\r\ntherefore, any persons concerned in the prosecution have found their\r\ncause so weak, as to make it appear convenient to them to enter into\r\na negociation with the publisher, whether for the purpose of his\r\nsubmitting to a verdict, and to make use of the verdict so obtained as a\r\ncircumstance, by way of precedent, on a future trial against myself;\r\nor for any other purpose not fully made known to me; if, I say, I have\r\ncause to suspect this to be the case, I shall most certainly withdraw\r\nthe defence I should otherwise have made, or promoted on his (the\r\npublisher's) behalf, and leave the negociators to themselves, and shall\r\nreserve the whole of the defence for the _real_ trial.(1)\r\n\r\nBut, sir, for the purpose of conducting this matter with at least the\r\nappearance of fairness and openness, that shall justify itself before\r\nthe public, whose cause it really is, (for it is the right of public\r\ndiscussion and investigation that is questioned,) I have to propose to\r\nyou to cease the prosecution against the publisher; and as the reason\r\nor pretext can no longer exist for continuing it against him because\r\nMr. Paine could not be found, that you would direct the whole process\r\nagainst me, with whom the prosecuting party will not find it possible to\r\nenter into any private negociation.\r\n\r\n     1 A detailed account of the proceedings with regard to the\r\n     publisher will be found infra, in ix., Letter to the\r\n     Addressers.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nI will do the cause full justice, as well for the sake of the nation, as\r\nfor my own reputation.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for discontinuing the process against the publisher is,\r\nbecause it can amount to nothing. First, because a jury in London cannot\r\ndecide upon the fact of publishing beyond the limits of the jurisdiction\r\nof London, and therefore the work may be republished over and over\r\nagain in every county in the nation, and every case must have a separate\r\nprocess; and by the time that three or four hundred prosecutions have\r\nbeen had, the eyes of the nation will then be fully open to see that the\r\nwork in question contains a plan the best calculated to root out all the\r\nabuses of government, and to lessen the taxes of the nation upwards of\r\n_six millions annually_.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because though the gentlemen of London may be very expert in\r\nunderstanding their particular professions and occupations, and how\r\nto make business contracts with government beneficial to themselves as\r\nindividuals, the rest of the nation may not be disposed to consider them\r\nsufficiently qualified nor authorized to determine for the whole Nation\r\non plans of reform, and on systems and principles of Government. This\r\nwould be in effect to erect a jury into a National Convention, instead\r\nof electing a Convention, and to lay a precedent for the probable\r\ntyranny of juries, under the pretence of supporting their rights.\r\n\r\nThat the possibility always exists of packing juries will not be denied;\r\nand, therefore, in all cases, where Government is the prosecutor,\r\nmore especially in those where the right of public discussion and\r\ninvestigation of principles and systems of Government is attempted to be\r\nsuppressed by a verdict, or in those where the object of the work that\r\nis prosecuted is the reform of abuse and the abolition of sinecure\r\nplaces and pensions, in all these cases the verdict of a jury will\r\nitself become a subject of discussion; and therefore, it furnishes\r\nan additional reason for discontinuing the prosecution against the\r\npublisher, more especially as it is not a secret that there has been a\r\nnegociation with him for secret purposes, and for proceeding against\r\nme only. I shall make a much stronger defence than what I believe the\r\nTreasury Solicitor's agreement with him will permit him to do.\r\n\r\nI believe that Mr. Burke, finding himself defeated, and not being able\r\nto make any answer to the _Rights of Man_, has been one of the promoters\r\nof this prosecution; and I shall return the compliment to him by\r\nshewing, in a future publication, that he has been a masked pensioner at\r\n1500L. per annum for about ten years.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the public money is wasted, and the dread of public\r\ninvestigation is produced.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, Your obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine's case was set down for June 8th, and on that day he\r\n     appeared in court; but, much to his disappointment, the\r\n     trial was adjourned to December 18th, at which time he was\r\n     in his place in the National Convention at Paris.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. TO MR. SECRETARY DUNDAS.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon, June 6, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAs you opened the debate in the House of Commons, May 25th, on the\r\nproclamation for suppressing publications, which that proclamation\r\n(without naming any) calls wicked and seditious: and as you applied\r\nthose opprobious epithets to the works entitled \"RIGHTS OF MAN,\" I think\r\nit unnecessary to offer any other reason for addressing this letter to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI begin, then, at once, by declaring, that I do not believe there are\r\nfound in the writings of any author, ancient or modern, on the subject\r\nof government, a spirit of greater benignity, and a stronger inculcation\r\nof moral principles than in those which I have published. They come,\r\nSir, from a man, who, by having lived in different countries, and\r\nunder different systems of government, and who, being intimate in\r\nthe construction of them, is a better judge of the subject than it is\r\npossible that you, from the want of those opportunities, can be:--And\r\nbesides this, they come from a heart that knows not how to beguile.\r\n\r\nI will farther say, that when that moment arrives in which the best\r\nconsolation that shall be left will be looking back on some past\r\nactions, more virtuous and more meritorious than the rest, I shall then\r\nwith happiness remember, among other things, I have written the RIGHTS\r\nOF MAN.---As to what proclamations, or prosecutions, or place-men,\r\nand place-expectants,--those who possess, or those who are gaping for\r\noffice,--may say of them, it will not alter their character, either with\r\nthe world or with me.\r\n\r\n     1 Henry D. (afterwards Viscount Melville), appointed\r\n     Secretary for the Home Department, 1791. In 1805 he was\r\n     impeached by the Commons for \"gross malversation\" while\r\n     Treasurer of the Navy; he was acquitted by the Lords\r\n     (1806), but not by public sentiment or by history.--\r\n     _Editor_.\r\n\r\nHaving, Sir, made this declaration, I shall proceed to remark, not\r\nparticularly on your speech on that occasion, but on any one to which\r\nyour motion on that day gave rise; and I shall begin with that of Mr.\r\nAdam.\r\n\r\nThis Gentleman accuses me of not having done the very thing that _I have\r\ndone_, and which, he says, if I _had_ done, he should not have accused\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. Adam, in his speech, (see the Morning Chronicle of May 26,) says,\r\n\r\n\"That he had well considered the subject of Constitutional Publications,\r\nand was by no means ready to say (but the contrary) that books of\r\nscience upon government though recommending a doctrine or system\r\ndifferent from the form of our constitution (meaning that of England)\r\nwere fit objects of prosecution; that if he did, he must condemn\r\nHarrington for his Oceana, Sir Thomas More for his Eutopia, and Hume\r\nfor his Idea of a perfect Commonwealth. But (continued Mr. Adam) the\r\npublication of Mr. Paine was very different; for it reviled what\r\nwas most sacred in the constitution, destroyed every principle of\r\nsubordination, and _established nothing in their room_.\"\r\n\r\nI readily perceive that Mr. Adam has not read the Second Part of _Rights\r\nof Man_, and I am put under the necessity, either of submitting to an\r\nerroneous charge, or of justifying myself against it; and certainly\r\nshall prefer the latter.--If, then, I shall prove to Mr. Adam, that in\r\nmy reasoning upon systems of government, in the Second Part of _Rights\r\nof Man_, I have shown as clearly, I think, as words can convey ideas, a\r\ncertain system of government, and that not existing in theory only,\r\nbut already in full and established practice, and systematically\r\nand practically free from all the vices and defects of the English\r\ngovernment, and capable of producing more happiness to the people, and\r\nthat also with an eightieth part of the taxes, which the present English\r\nsystem of government consumes; I hope he will do me the justice, when\r\nhe next goes to the House, to get up and confess he had been mistaken in\r\nsaying, that I had _established nothing, and that I had destroyed every\r\nprinciple of subordination_. Having thus opened the case, I now come to\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part of the Rights of Man, I have distinguished government\r\ninto two classes or systems: the one the hereditary system, the other\r\nthe representative system.\r\n\r\nIn the First Part of _Rights of Man_, I have endeavoured to shew, and\r\nI challenge any man to refute it, that there does not exist a right\r\nto establish hereditary government; or, in other words, hereditary\r\ngovernors; because hereditary government always means a government\r\nyet to come, and the case always is, that the people who are to live\r\nafterwards, have always the same right to choose a government for\r\nthemselves, as the people had who lived before them.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part of _Rights of Man_, I have not repeated those\r\narguments, because they are irrefutable; but have confined myself to\r\nshew the defects of what is called hereditary government, or hereditary\r\nsuccession, that it must, from the nature of it, throw government into\r\nthe hands of men totally unworthy of it, from want of principle, or\r\nunfitted for it from want of capacity.--James the IId. is recorded as\r\nan instance of the first of these cases; and instances are to be found\r\nalmost all over Europe to prove the truth of the latter.\r\n\r\nTo shew the absurdity of the Hereditary System still more strongly, I\r\nwill now put the following case:--Take any fifty men promiscuously, and\r\nit will be very extraordinary, if, out of that number, one man should be\r\nfound, whose principles and talents taken together (for some might have\r\nprinciples, and others might have talents) would render him a person\r\ntruly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of National Trust.\r\nIf then such a fitness of character could not be expected to be found\r\nin more than one person out of fifty, it would happen but once in a\r\nthousand years to the eldest son of any one family, admitting each, on\r\nan average, to hold the office twenty years. Mr. Adam talks of something\r\nin the Constitution which he calls _most sacred_; but I hope he does not\r\nmean hereditary succession, a thing which appears to me a violation of\r\nevery order of nature, and of common sense.\r\n\r\nWhen I look into history and see the multitudes of men, otherwise\r\nvirtuous, who have died, and their families been ruined, in the defence\r\nof knaves and fools, and which they would not have done, had they\r\nreasoned at all upon the system; I do not know a greater good that an\r\nindividual can render to mankind, than to endeavour to break the chains\r\nof political superstition. Those chains are now dissolving fast,\r\nand proclamations and persecutions will serve but to hasten that\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken of the Hereditary System as a bad System, and subject\r\nto every possible defect, I now come to the Representative System, and\r\nthis Mr. Adam will find stated in the Second Part of Rights of Man, not\r\nonly as the best, but as the only _Theory_ of Government under which the\r\nliberties of the people can be permanently secure.\r\n\r\nBut it is needless now to talk of mere theory, since there is already a\r\ngovernment in full practice, established upon that theory; or in other\r\nwords, upon the Rights of Man, and has been so for almost twenty years.\r\nMr. Pitt, in a speech of his some short time since, said, \"That there\r\nnever did, and never could exist a Government established upon those\r\nRights, and that if it began at noon, it would end at night.\" Mr. Pitt\r\nhas not yet arrived at the degree of a school-boy in this species of\r\nknowledge; his practice has been confined to the means of _extorting\r\nrevenue_, and his boast has been--_how much!_ Whereas the boast of the\r\nsystem of government that I am speaking of, is not how much, but how\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nThe system of government purely representative, unmixed with any thing\r\nof hereditary nonsense, began in America. I will now compare the effects\r\nof that system of government with the system of government in England,\r\nboth during, and since the close of the war.\r\n\r\nSo powerful is the Representative system, first, by combining and\r\nconsolidating all the parts of a country together, however great the\r\nextent; and, secondly, by admitting of none but men properly qualified\r\ninto the government, or dismissing them if they prove to be otherwise,\r\nthat America was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all\r\nthe schemes and projects of the hereditary government of England against\r\nher. As the establishment of the Revolution and Independence of America\r\nis a proof of this fact, it is needless to enlarge upon it.\r\n\r\nI now come to the comparative effect of the two systems _since_ the\r\nclose of the war, and I request Mr. Adam to attend to it.\r\n\r\nAmerica had internally sustained the ravages of upwards of seven years\r\nof war, which England had not. England sustained only the expence of the\r\nwar; whereas America sustained not only the expence, but the destruction\r\nof property committed by _both_ armies. Not a house was built\r\nduring that period, and many thousands were destroyed. The farms and\r\nplantations along the coast of the country, for more than a thousand\r\nmiles, were laid waste. Her commerce was annihilated. Her ships were\r\neither taken, or had rotted within her own harbours. The credit of\r\nher funds had fallen upwards of ninety per cent., that is, an original\r\nhundred pounds would not sell for ten pounds. In fine, she was\r\napparently put back an hundred years when the war closed, which was not\r\nthe case with England.\r\n\r\nBut such was the event, that the same representative system of\r\ngovernment, though since better organized, which enabled her to conquer,\r\nenabled her also to recover, and she now presents a more flourishing\r\ncondition, and a more happy and harmonized society, under that system of\r\ngovernment, than any country in the world can boast under any other. Her\r\ntowns are rebuilt, much better than before; her farms and plantations\r\nare in higher improvement than ever; her commerce is spread over the\r\nworld, and her funds have risen from less than ten pounds the hundred to\r\nupwards of one hundred and twenty. Mr. Pitt and his colleagues talk\r\nof the things that have happened in his boyish administration, without\r\nknowing what greater things have happened elsewhere, and under other\r\nsystems of government.\r\n\r\nI now come to state the expence of the two systems, as they now stand\r\nin each of the countries; but it may first be proper to observe, that\r\ngovernment in America is what it ought to be, a matter of honour and\r\ntrust, and not made a trade of for the purpose of lucre.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of the nett(sic) taxes in England (exclusive of the\r\nexpence of collection, of drawbacks, of seizures and condemnation, of\r\nfines and penalties, of fees of office, of litigations and informers,\r\nwhich are some of the blessed means of enforcing them) is seventeen\r\nmillions. Of this sum, about nine millions go for the payment of the\r\ninterest of the national debt, and the remainder, being about eight\r\nmillions, is for the current annual expences. This much for one side of\r\nthe case. I now come to the other.\r\n\r\nThe expence of the several departments of the general Representative\r\nGovernment of the United States of America, extending over a space\r\nof country nearly ten times larger than England, is two hundred and\r\nninety-four thousand, five hundred and fifty-eight dollars, which, at\r\n4s. 6d. per dollar, is 66,305L. 11s. sterling, and is thus apportioned;\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table046]\r\n\r\nOn account of the incursions of the Indians on the back settlements,\r\nCongress is at this time obliged to keep six thousand militia in pay, in\r\naddition to a regiment of foot, and a battalion of artillery, which it\r\nalways keeps; and this increases the expence of the War Department to\r\n390,000 dollars, which is 87,795L. sterling, but when peace shall be\r\nconcluded with the Indians, the greatest part of this expence will\r\ncease, and the total amount of the expence of government, including that\r\nof the army, will not amount to 100,000L. sterling, which, as has been\r\nalready stated, is but an eightieth part of the expences of the English\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI request Mr. Adam and Mr. Dundas, and all those who are talking of\r\nConstitutions, and blessings, and Kings, and Lords, and the Lord\r\nknows what, to look at this statement. Here is a form and system of\r\ngovernment, that is better organized and better administered than any\r\ngovernment in the world, and that for less than one hundred thousand\r\npounds per annum, and yet every Member of Congress receives, as a\r\ncompensation for his time and attendance on public business, one pound\r\nseven shillings per day, which is at the rate of nearly five hundred\r\npounds a year.\r\n\r\nThis is a government that has nothing to fear. It needs no proclamations\r\nto deter people from writing and reading. It needs no political\r\nsuperstition to support it; it was by encouraging discussion and\r\nrendering the press free upon all subjects of government, that the\r\nprinciples of government became understood in America, and the people\r\nare now enjoying the present blessings under it. You hear of no riots,\r\ntumults, and disorders in that country; because there exists no cause\r\nto produce them. Those things are never the effect of Freedom, but of\r\nrestraint, oppression, and excessive taxation.\r\n\r\nIn America, there is not that class of poor and wretched people that\r\nare so numerously dispersed all over England, who are to be told by a\r\nproclamation, that they are happy; and this is in a great measure to\r\nbe accounted for, not by the difference of proclamations, but by the\r\ndifference of governments and the difference of taxes between that\r\ncountry and this. What the labouring people of that country earn, they\r\napply to their own use, and to the education of their children, and\r\ndo not pay it away in taxes as fast as they earn it, to support Court\r\nextravagance, and a long enormous list of place-men and pensioners;\r\nand besides this, they have learned the manly doctrine of reverencing\r\nthemselves, and consequently of respecting each other; and they laugh\r\nat those imaginary beings called Kings and Lords, and all the fraudulent\r\ntrumpery of Court.\r\n\r\nWhen place-men and pensioners, or those who expect to be such, are\r\nlavish in praise of a government, it is not a sign of its being a good\r\none. The pension list alone in England (see sir John Sinclair's History\r\nof the Revenue, p. 6, of the Appendix) is one hundred and seven thousand\r\nfour hundred and four pounds, _which is more than the expences of the\r\nwhole Government of America amount to_. And I am now more convinced than\r\nbefore, that the offer that was made to me of a thousand pounds for the\r\ncopy-right of the second part of the Rights of Man, together with the\r\nremaining copyright of the first part, was to have effected, by a quick\r\nsuppression, what is now attempted to be done by a prosecution. The\r\nconnection which the person, who made the offer, has with the King's\r\nprinting-office, may furnish part of the means of inquiring into this\r\naffair, when the ministry shall please to bring their prosecution to\r\nissue.(1) But to return to my subject.--\r\n\r\nI have said in the second part of the _Rights of Man_, and I repeat\r\nit here, that the service of any man, whether called King, President,\r\nSenator, Legislator, or any thing else, cannot be worth more to any\r\ncountry, in the regular routine of office, than ten thousand pounds per\r\nannum. We have a better man in America, and more of a gentleman, than\r\nany King I ever knew of, who does not occasion half that ex-pence; for,\r\nthough the salary is fixed at £5625 he does not accept it, and it is\r\nonly the incidental expences that are paid out of it.(2) The name by\r\nwhich a man is called is of itself but an empty thing. It is worth and\r\ncharacter alone which can render him valuable, for without these, Kings,\r\nand Lords, and Presidents, are but jingling names.\r\n\r\nBut without troubling myself about Constitutions of Government, I have\r\nshewn in the Second Part of _Rights of Man_, that an alliance may be\r\nformed between England, France, and America, and that the expences of\r\ngovernment in England may be put back to one million and a half, viz.:\r\n\r\n     Civil expence of Government...... 500,000L.\r\n     Army............................. 500,000\r\n     Navy............................. 500,000\r\n                                      ----------\r\n                                     1,500,000L.\r\n\r\nAnd even this sum is fifteen times greater than the expences of\r\ngovernment are in America; and it is also greater than the whole peace\r\nestablishment of England amounted to about an hundred years ago. So much\r\nhas the weight and oppression of taxes increased since the Revolution,\r\nand especially since the year 1714.\r\n\r\n     1 At Paine's trial, Chapman, the printer, in answer to fa\r\n     question of the Solicitor General, said: \"I made him three\r\n     separate offers in the different stages of the work; the\r\n     first, I believe, was a hundred guineas, the second five\r\n     hundred, and the last was a thousand.\"--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n     2 Error. See also ante, and in vol. ii., p. 435.\r\n     Washington had retracted his original announcement, and\r\n     received his salary regularly.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nTo shew that the sum of 500,000L. is sufficient to defray all civil\r\nexpences of government, I have, in that work, annexed the following\r\nestimate for any country of the same extent as England.--\r\n\r\nIn the first place, three hundred Representatives, fairly elected, are\r\nsufficient for all the purposes to which Legislation can apply, and\r\npreferable to a larger number.\r\n\r\nIf, then, an allowance, at the rate of 500L. per annum be made to every\r\nRepresentative, deducting for non-attendance, the expence, if the whole\r\nnumber attended six months each year, would be.......75,000L.\r\n\r\nThe Official Departments could not possibly exceed the following number,\r\nwith the salaries annexed, viz.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: Table]\r\n\r\nThree offices at\r\n 10,000L.\r\n each\r\n 30,000\r\n\r\nTen ditto at\r\n 5,000\r\n u\r\n 50,000\r\n\r\nTwenty ditto at\r\n 2,000\r\n u\r\n 40,000\r\n\r\nForty ditto at\r\n 1,000\r\n it\r\n 40,000\r\n\r\nTwo hundred ditto at\r\n 500\r\n u\r\n 100,000\r\n\r\nThree hundred ditto at  200\r\n u\r\n 60,000\r\n\r\nFive hundred ditto at\r\n 100\r\n u\r\n 50,000\r\n\r\nSeven hundred ditto at  75\r\n it\r\n 52,500\r\n\r\n497,500L.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a nation chose, it might deduct four per cent, from all the offices,\r\nand make one of twenty thousand pounds per annum, and style the person\r\nwho should fill it, King or Madjesty, (1) or give him any other title.\r\n\r\nTaking, however, this sum of one million and a half, as an abundant\r\nsupply for all the expences of government under any form whatever,\r\nthere will remain a surplus of nearly six millions and a half out of\r\nthe present taxes, after paying the interest of the national debt; and\r\nI have shewn in the Second Part of _Rights of Man_, what appears to me,\r\nthe best mode of applying the surplus money; for I am now speaking of\r\nexpences and savings, and not of systems of government.\r\n\r\n     1 A friend of Paine advised him against this pun, as too\r\n     personal an allusion to George the Third, to whom however\r\n     much has been forgiven on account of his mental infirmity.\r\n     Yorke, in his account of his visit to Paine, 1802, alludes\r\n     to his (Paine's) anecdotes \"of humor and benevolence\"\r\n     concerning George III.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nI have, in the first place, estimated the poor-rates at two millions\r\nannually, and shewn that the first effectual step would be to abolish\r\nthe poor-rates entirely (which would be a saving of two millions to the\r\nhouse-keepers,) and to remit four millions out of the surplus taxes to\r\nthe poor, to be paid to them in money, in proportion to the number of\r\nchildren in each family, and the number of aged persons.\r\n\r\nI have estimated the number of persons of both sexes in England, of\r\nfifty years of age and upwards, at 420,000, and have taken one third of\r\nthis number, viz. 140,000, to be poor people.\r\n\r\nTo save long calculations, I have taken 70,000 of them to be upwards of\r\nfifty years of age, and under sixty, and the others to be sixty years\r\nand upwards; and to allow six pounds per annum to the former class, and\r\nten pounds per annum to the latter. The expence of which will be,\r\n\r\n  Seventy thousand persons at 6L. per annum..... 420,000L.\r\n  Seventy thousand persons at 10L. per annum.... 700,000\r\n                                                -----------\r\n                                               1,120,000L.\r\n\r\nThere will then remain of the four millions, 2,880,000L. I have stated\r\ntwo different methods of appropriating this money. The one is to pay it\r\nin proportion to the number of children in each family, at the rate of\r\nthree or four pounds per annum for each child; the other is to apportion\r\nit according to the expence of living in different counties; but in\r\neither of these cases it would, together with the allowance to be\r\nmade to the aged, completely take off taxes from one third of all the\r\nfamilies in England, besides relieving all the other families from the\r\nburthen of poor-rates.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of families in England, allotting five souls to each\r\nfamily, is one million four hundred thousand, of which I take one third,\r\n_viz_. 466,666 to be poor families who now pay four millions of taxes,\r\nand that the poorest pays at least four guineas a year; and that the\r\nother thirteen millions are paid by the other two-thirds. The plan,\r\ntherefore, as stated in the work, is, first, to remit or repay, as is\r\nalready stated, this sum of four millions to the poor, because it is\r\nimpossible to separate them from the others in the present mode of\r\ncollecting taxes on articles of consumption; and, secondly, to abolish\r\nthe poor-rates, the house and window-light tax, and to change the\r\ncommutation tax into a progressive tax on large estates, the particulars\r\nof all which are set forth in the work, to which I desire Mr. Adam to\r\nrefer for particulars. I shall here content myself with saying, that to\r\na town of the population of Manchester, it will make a difference in its\r\nfavour, compared with the present state of things, of upwards of fifty\r\nthousand pounds annually, and so in proportion to all other places\r\nthroughout the nation. This certainly is of more consequence than that\r\nthe same sums should be collected to be afterwards spent by riotous\r\nand profligate courtiers, and in nightly revels at the Star and Garter\r\ntavern, Pall Mall.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from the Second\r\nPart of the _Rights of Man_, which Mr. Dundas (a man rolling in luxury\r\nat the expence of the nation) has branded with the epithet of \"wicked.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the operation of this plan, the poor laws, those instruments\r\nof civil torture, will be superseded, and the wasteful ex-pence of\r\nlitigation prevented. The hearts of the humane will not be shocked by\r\nragged and hungry children, and persons of seventy and eighty years of\r\nage begging for bread. The dying poor will not be dragged from place to\r\nplace to breathe their last, as a reprisal of parish upon parish. Widows\r\nwill have a maintenance for their children, and not be carted away, on\r\nthe death of their husbands, like culprits and criminals; and children\r\nwill no longer be considered as increasing the distresses of their\r\nparents. The haunts of the wretched will be known, because it will be\r\nto their advantage; and the number of petty crimes, the offspring of\r\npoverty and distress, will be lessened. The poor as well as the rich\r\nwill then be interested in the support of Government, and the cause and\r\napprehension of riots and tumults will cease. Ye who sit in ease, and\r\nsolace yourselves in plenty, and such there are in Turkey and Russia,\r\nas well as in England, and who say to yourselves, _are we not well off_\r\nhave ye thought of these things? When ye do, ye will cease to speak and\r\nfeel for yourselves alone.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this remission of four millions be made, and the poor-rates\r\nand houses and window-light tax be abolished, and the commutation\r\ntax changed, there will still remain nearly one million and a half\r\nof surplus taxes; and as by an alliance between England, France and\r\nAmerica, armies and navies will, in a great measure, be rendered\r\nunnecessary; and as men who have either been brought up in, or long\r\nhabited to, those lines of life, are still citizens of a nation in\r\ncommon with the rest, and have a right to participate in all plans of\r\nnational benefit, it is stated in that work (_Rights of Man_, Part ii.)\r\nto apply annually 507,000L. out of the surplus taxes to this purpose, in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table 053]\r\n\r\nThe limits to which it is proper to confine this letter, will not admit\r\nof my entering into further particulars. I address it to Mr. Dundas\r\nbecause he took the lead in the debate, and he wishes, I suppose, to\r\nappear conspicuous; but the purport of it is to justify myself from the\r\ncharge which Mr. Adam has made.\r\n\r\nThis Gentleman, as has been observed in the beginning of this letter,\r\nconsiders the writings of Harrington, More and Hume, as justifiable and\r\nlegal publications, because they reasoned by comparison, though in so\r\ndoing they shewed plans and systems of government, not only different\r\nfrom, but preferable to, that of England; and he accuses me of\r\nendeavouring to confuse, instead of producing a system in the room of\r\nthat which I had reasoned against; whereas, the fact is, that I have\r\nnot only reasoned by comparison of the representative system against\r\nthe hereditary system, but I have gone further; for I have produced\r\nan instance of a government established entirely on the representative\r\nsystem, under which greater happiness is enjoyed, much fewer taxes\r\nrequired, and much higher credit is established, than under the system\r\nof government in England. The funds in England have risen since the war\r\nonly from 54L. to 97L. and they have been down since the proclamation,\r\nto 87L. whereas the funds in America rose in the mean time from 10L. to\r\n120L.\r\n\r\nHis charge against me of \"destroying every principle of subordination,\"\r\nis equally as groundless; which even a single paragraph from the work\r\nwill prove, and which I shall here quote:\r\n\r\n\"Formerly when divisions arose respecting Governments, recourse was had\r\nto the sword, and a civil war ensued. That savage custom is exploded\r\nby the new system, and _recourse is had to a national convention_.\r\nDiscussion, and the general will, arbitrates the question, and to\r\nthis private opinion yields with a good grace, and _order is preserved\r\nuninterrupted_.\"\r\n\r\nThat two different charges should be brought at the same time, the one\r\nby a Member of the Legislative, for _not_ doing a certain thing, and\r\nthe other by the Attorney General for _doing_ it, is a strange jumble of\r\ncontradictions. I have now justified myself, or the work rather, against\r\nthe first, by stating the case in this letter, and the justification of\r\nthe other will be undertaken in its proper place. But in any case the\r\nwork will go on.\r\n\r\nI shall now conclude this letter with saying, that the only objection\r\nI found against the plan and principles contained in the Second Part\r\nof _Rights of Man_, when I had written the book, was, that they would\r\nbeneficially interest at least ninety-nine persons out of every hundred\r\nthroughout the nation, and therefore would not leave sufficient room for\r\nmen to act from the direct and disinterested principles of honour; but\r\nthe prosecution now commenced has fortunately removed that objection,\r\nand the approvers and protectors of that work now feel the immediate\r\nimpulse of honour added to that of national interest.\r\n\r\nI am, Mr. Dundas,\r\n\r\nNot your obedient humble Servant,\r\n\r\nBut the contrary,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. LETTERS TO ONSLOW CRANLEY,\r\n\r\nLord Lieutenant of the county of Surry; on the subject of the late\r\nexcellent proclamation:--or the chairman who shall preside at the\r\nmeeting to be held at Epsom, June 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LETTER.\r\n\r\nLondon, June 17th, 1792.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have seen in the public newspapers the following advertisement, to\r\nwit--\r\n\r\n\"To the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants of\r\nthe county of Surry.\r\n\r\n\"At the requisition and desire of several of the freeholders of the\r\ncounty, I am, in the absence of the Sheriff, to desire the favour of\r\nyour attendance, at a meeting to be held at Epsom, on Monday, the 18th\r\ninstant, at 12 o'clock at noon, to consider of an humble address to his\r\nmajesty, to express our grateful approbation of his majesty's paternal,\r\nand well-timed attendance to the public welfare, in his late most\r\ngracious Proclamation against the enemies of our happy Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed.) Onslow Cranley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted, that the aforesaid advertisement, equally as\r\nobscure as the proclamation to which it refers, has nevertheless some\r\nmeaning, and is intended to effect some purpose; and as a prosecution\r\n(whether wisely or unwisely, justly or unjustly) is already commenced\r\nagainst a work intitled RIGHTS OF MAN, of which I have the honour and\r\nhappiness to be the author; I feel it necessary to address this letter\r\nto you, and to request that it may be read publicly to the gentlemen who\r\nshall meet at Epsom in consequence of the advertisement.\r\n\r\nThe work now under prosecution is, I conceive, the same work which is\r\nintended to be suppressed by the aforesaid proclamation. Admitting this\r\nto be the case, the gentlemen of the county of Surry are called upon by\r\nsomebody to condemn a work, and they are at the same time forbidden by\r\nthe proclamation to know what that work is; and they are further called\r\nupon to give their aid and assistance to prevent other people from\r\nknowing it also. It is therefore necessary that the author, for his own\r\njustification, as well as to prevent the gentlemen who shall meet from\r\nbeing imposed upon by misrepresentation, should give some outlines of\r\nthe principles and plans which that work contains.\r\n\r\nThe work, Sir, in question, contains, first, an investigation of general\r\nprinciples of government.\r\n\r\nIt also distinguishes government into two classes or systems, the one\r\nthe hereditary system; the other the representative system; and it\r\ncompares these two systems with each other.\r\n\r\nIt shews that what is called hereditary government cannot exist as a\r\nmatter of right; because hereditary government always means a government\r\nyet to come; and the case always is, that those who are to live\r\nafterwards have always the same right to establish a government for\r\nthemselves as the people who had lived before them.\r\n\r\nIt also shews the defect to which hereditary government is unavoidably\r\nsubject: that it must, from the nature of it, throw government into\r\nthe hands of men totally unworthy of it from the want of principle, and\r\nunfitted for it from want of capacity. James II. and many others are\r\nrecorded in the English history as proofs of the former of those cases,\r\nand instances are to be found all over Europe to prove the truth of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIt then shews that the representative system is the only true system of\r\ngovernment; that it is also the only system under which the liberties of\r\nany people can be permanently secure; and, further, that it is the\r\nonly one that can continue the same equal probability at all times of\r\nadmitting of none but men properly qualified, both by principles and\r\nabilities, into government, and of excluding such as are otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe work shews also, by plans and calculations not hitherto denied nor\r\ncontroverted, not even by the prosecution that is commenced, that the\r\ntaxes now existing may be reduced at least six millions, that taxes may\r\nbe entirely taken off from the poor, who are computed at one third of\r\nthe nation; and that taxes on the other two thirds may be considerably\r\nreduced; that the aged poor may be comfortably provided for, and the\r\nchildren of poor families properly educated; that fifteen thousand\r\nsoldiers, and the same number of sailors, may be allowed three\r\nshillings per week during life out of the surplus taxes; and also that a\r\nproportionate allowance may be made to the officers, and the pay of the\r\nremaining soldiers and sailors be raised; and that it is better to apply\r\nthe surplus taxes to those purposes, than to consume them on lazy and\r\nprofligate placemen and pensioners; and that the revenue, said to be\r\ntwenty thousand pounds per annum, raised by a tax upon coals, and given\r\nto the Duke of Richmond, is a gross imposition upon all the people of\r\nLondon, and ought to be instantly abolished.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is a concise abstract of the principles and plans contained\r\nin the work that is now prosecuted, and for the suppression of which the\r\nproclamation appears to be intended; but as it is impossible that I can,\r\nin the compass of a letter, bring into view all the matters contained\r\nin the work, and as it is proper that the gentlemen who may compose that\r\nmeeting should know what the merits or demerits of it are, before they\r\ncome to any resolutions, either directly or indirectly relating thereto,\r\nI request the honour of presenting them with one hundred copies of the\r\nsecond part of the Rights of Man, and also one thousand copies of my\r\nletter to Mr. Dundas, which I have directed to be sent to Epsom for that\r\npurpose; and I beg the favour of the Chairman to take the trouble of\r\npresenting them to the gentlemen who shall meet on that occasion, with\r\nmy sincere wishes for their happiness, and for that of the nation in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nHaving now closed thus much of the subject of my letter, I next come\r\nto speak of what has relation to me personally. I am well aware of the\r\ndelicacy that attends it, but the purpose of calling the meeting appears\r\nto me so inconsistent with that justice that is always due between man\r\nand man, that it is proper I should (as well on account of the gentlemen\r\nwho may meet, as on my own account) explain myself fully and candidly\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nI have already informed the gentlemen, that a prosecution is commenced\r\nagainst a work of which I have the honour and happiness to be the\r\nauthor; and I have good reasons for believing that the proclamation\r\nwhich the gentlemen are called to consider, and to present an address\r\nupon, is purposely calculated to give an impression to the jury before\r\nwhom that matter is to come. In short, that it is dictating a verdict by\r\nproclamation; and I consider the instigators of the meeting to be held\r\nat Epsom, as aiding and abetting the same improper, and, in my opinion,\r\nillegal purpose, and that in a manner very artfully contrived, as I\r\nshall now shew.\r\n\r\nHad a meeting been called of the Freeholders of the county of Middlesex,\r\nthe gentlemen who had composed that meeting would have rendered\r\nthemselves objectionable as persons to serve on a Jury, before whom the\r\njudicial case was afterwards to come. But by calling a meeting out\r\nof the county of Middlesex, that matter is artfully avoided, and the\r\ngentlemen of Surry are summoned, as if it were intended thereby to give\r\na tone to the sort of verdict which the instigators of the meeting no\r\ndoubt wish should be brought in, and to give countenance to the Jury in\r\nso doing. I am, sir,\r\n\r\nWith much respect to the\r\n\r\nGentlemen who shall meet, Their and your obedient and humble Servant,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ONSLOW CRANLEY,\r\n\r\nCOMMONLY CALLED LORD ONSLOW.\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER. SIR,\r\n\r\nLondon, June 21st 1792.\r\n\r\nWHEN I wrote you the letter which Mr. Home Tooke did me the favour to\r\npresent to you, as chairman of the meeting held at Epsom, Monday, June\r\n18, it was not with much expectation that you would do me the justice of\r\npermitting, or recommending it to be publicly read. I am well aware that\r\nthe signature of Thomas Paine has something in it dreadful to sinecure\r\nPlacemen and Pensioners; and when you, on seeing the letter opened,\r\ninformed the meeting that it was signed Thomas Paine, and added in a\r\nnote of exclamation, \"the common enemy of us all.\" you spoke one of the\r\ngreatest truths you ever uttered, if you confine the expression to\r\nmen of the same description with yourself; men living in indolence and\r\nluxury, on the spoil and labours of the public.\r\n\r\nThe letter has since appeared in the \"Argus,\" and probably in other\r\npapers.(1) It will justify itself; but if any thing on that account\r\nhath been wanting, your conduct at the meeting would have supplied\r\nthe omission. You there sufficiently proved that I was not mistaken in\r\nsupposing that the meeting was called to give an indirect aid to the\r\nprosecution commenced against a work, the reputation of which will long\r\noutlive the memory of the Pensioner I am writing to.\r\n\r\nWhen meetings, Sir, are called by the partisans of the Court, to\r\npreclude the nation the right of investigating systems and principles\r\nof government, and of exposing errors and defects, under the pretence\r\nof prosecuting an individual--it furnishes an additional motive for\r\nmaintaining sacred that violated right.\r\n\r\nThe principles and arguments contained in the work in question, _Rights\r\nOF Man_, have stood, and they now stand, and I believe ever will stand,\r\nunrefuted. They are stated in a fair and open manner to the world, and\r\nthey have already received the public approbation of a greater number of\r\nmen, of the best of characters, of every denomination of religion, and\r\nof every rank in life, (placemen and pensioners excepted,) than all the\r\njuries that shall meet in England, for ten years to come, will amount\r\nto; and I have, moreover, good reasons for believing that the approvers\r\nof that work, as well private as public, are already more numerous than\r\nall the present electors throughout the nation.\r\n\r\n     1 The _Argus_ was edited by Sampson Perry, soon after\r\n     prosecuted.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nNot less than forty pamphlets, intended as answers thereto, have\r\nappeared, and as suddenly disappeared: scarcely are the titles of any of\r\nthem remembered, notwithstanding their endeavours have been aided by all\r\nthe daily abuse which the Court and Ministerial newspapers, for almost\r\na year and a half, could bestow, both upon the work and the author;\r\nand now that every attempt to refute, and every abuse has failed,\r\nthe invention of calling the work a libel has been hit upon, and the\r\ndiscomfited party has pusillanimously retreated to prosecution and a\r\njury, and obscure addresses.\r\n\r\nAs I well know that a long letter from me will not be agreeable to you,\r\nI will relieve your uneasiness by making it as short as I conveniently\r\ncan; and will conclude it with taking up the subject at that part where\r\nMr. HORNE TOOKE was interrupted from going on when at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was stating, that the situation you stood in rendered it\r\nimproper for you to appear _actively_ in a scene in which your private\r\ninterest was too visible: that you were a Bedchamber Lord at a thousand\r\na year, and a Pensioner at three thousand pounds a year more--and here\r\nhe was stopped by the little but noisy circle you had collected round.\r\nPermit me then, Sir, to add an explanation to his words, for the benefit\r\nof your neighbours, and with which, and a few observations, I shall\r\nclose my letter.\r\n\r\nWhen it was reported in the English Newspapers, some short time since,\r\nthat the empress of RUSSIA had given to one of her minions a large tract\r\nof country and several thousands of peasants as property, it very justly\r\nprovoked indignation and abhorrence in those who heard it. But if we\r\ncompare the mode practised in England, with that which appears to us so\r\nabhorrent in Russia, it will be found to amount to very near the same\r\nthing;--for example--\r\n\r\nAs the whole of the revenue in England is drawn by taxes from the\r\npockets of the people, those things called gifts and grants (of which\r\nkind are all pensions and sinecure places) are paid out of that stock.\r\nThe difference, therefore, between the two modes is, that in England the\r\nmoney is collected by the government, and then given to the Pensioner,\r\nand in Russia he is left to collect it for himself. The smallest sum\r\nwhich the poorest family in a county so near London as Surry, can be\r\nsupposed to pay annually, of taxes, is not less than five pounds; and as\r\nyour sinecure of one thousand, and pension of three thousand per annum,\r\nare made up of taxes paid by eight hundred such poor families, it comes\r\nto the same thing as if the eight hundred families had been given to\r\nyou, as in Russia, and you had collected the money on your account.\r\nWere you to say that you are not quartered particularly on the people\r\nof Surrey, but on the nation at large, the objection would amount to\r\nnothing; for as there are more pensioners than counties, every one may\r\nbe considered as quartered on that in which he lives.\r\n\r\nWhat honour or happiness you can derive from being the PRINCIPAL PAUPER\r\nof the neighbourhood, and occasioning a greater expence than the poor,\r\nthe aged, and the infirm, for ten miles round you, I leave you to enjoy.\r\nAt the same time I can see that it is no wonder you should be strenuous\r\nin suppressing a book which strikes at the root of those abuses. No\r\nwonder that you should be against reforms, against the freedom of the\r\npress, and the right of investigation. To you, and to others of your\r\ndescription, these are dreadful things; but you should also consider,\r\nthat the motives which prompt you to _act_, ought, by reflection, to\r\ncompel you to be _silent_.\r\n\r\nHaving now returned your compliment, and sufficiently tired your\r\npatience, I take my leave of you, with mentioning, that if you had not\r\nprevented my former letter from being read at the meeting, you would not\r\nhave had the trouble of reading this; and also with requesting, that\r\nthe next time you call me \"_a common enemy_,\" you would add, \"_of us\r\nsinecure placemen and pensioners_.\"\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. TO THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY OF SUSSEX,\r\n\r\nOR, THE GENTLEMAN WHO SHALL PRESIDE AT THE MEETING TO BE HELD AT LEWES,\r\nJULY 4.\r\n\r\nLondon, June 30, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have seen in the Lewes newspapers, of June 25, an advertisement,\r\nsigned by sundry persons, and also by the sheriff, for holding a meeting\r\nat the Town-hall of Lewes, for the purpose, as the advertisement states,\r\nof presenting an Address on the late Proclamation for suppressing\r\nwritings, books, &c. And as I conceive that a certain publication\r\nof mine, entitled \"Rights of Man,\" in which, among other things, the\r\nenormous increase of taxes, placemen, and pensioners, is shewn to be\r\nunnecessary and oppressive, _is the particular writing alluded to in\r\nthe said publication_; I request the Sheriff, or in his absence, whoever\r\nshall preside at the meeting, or any other person, to read this letter\r\npublicly to the company who shall assemble in consequence of that\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\nGentlemen--It is now upwards of eighteen years since I was a resident\r\ninhabitant of the town of Lewes. My situation among you, as an officer\r\nof the revenue, for more than six years, enabled me to see into the\r\nnumerous and various distresses which the weight of taxes even at that\r\ntime of day occasioned; and feeling, as I then did, and as it is natural\r\nfor me to do, for the hard condition of others, it is with pleasure I\r\ncan declare, and every person then under my survey, and now living, can\r\nwitness, the exceeding candour, and even tenderness, with which that\r\npart of the duty that fell to my share was executed. The name of _Thomas\r\nPaine_ is not to be found in the records of the Lewes' justices, in any\r\none act of contention with, or severity of any kind whatever towards,\r\nthe persons whom he surveyed, either in the town, or in the country;\r\nof this, _Mr. Fuller_ and _Mr. Shelley_, who will probably attend the\r\nmeeting, can, if they please, give full testimony. It is, however, not\r\nin their power to contradict it.\r\n\r\nHaving thus indulged myself in recollecting a place where I formerly\r\nhad, and even now have, many friends, rich and poor, and most probably\r\nsome enemies, I proceed to the more important purport of my letter.\r\n\r\nSince my departure from Lewes, fortune or providence has thrown me\r\ninto a line of action, which my first setting out into life could not\r\npossibly have suggested to me.\r\n\r\nI have seen the fine and fertile country of America ravaged and deluged\r\nin blood, and the taxes of England enormously increased and multiplied\r\nin consequence thereof; and this, in a great measure, by the instigation\r\nof the same class of placemen, pensioners, and Court dependants, who\r\nare now promoting addresses throughout England, on the present\r\n_unintelligible_ Proclamation.\r\n\r\nI have also seen a system of Government rise up in that country, free\r\nfrom corruption, and now administered over an extent of territory ten\r\ntimes as large as England, _for less expence than the pensions alone in\r\nEngland amount to_; and under which more freedom is enjoyed, and a more\r\nhappy state of society is preserved, and a more general prosperity is\r\npromoted, than under any other system of Government now existing in the\r\nworld. Knowing, as I do, the things I now declare, I should reproach\r\nmyself with want of duty and affection to mankind, were I not in the\r\nmost undismayed manner to publish them, as it were, on the house-tops,\r\nfor the good of others.\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at what has passed within my knowledge, since my\r\nleaving Lewes, I come to the subject more immediately before the meeting\r\nnow present.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmund Burke, who, as I shall show, in a future publication, has\r\nlived a concealed pensioner, at the expence of the public, of fifteen\r\nhundred pounds per annum, for about ten years last past, published a\r\nbook the winter before last, in open violation of the principles of\r\nliberty, and for which he was applauded by that class of men _who are\r\nnow promoting addresses_. Soon after his book appeared, I published the\r\nfirst part of the work, entitled \"Rights of Man,\" as an answer thereto,\r\nand had the happiness of receiving the public thanks of several bodies\r\nof men, and of numerous individuals of the best character, of every\r\ndenomination in religion, and of every rank in life--placemen and\r\npensioners excepted.\r\n\r\nIn February last, I published the Second Part of \"Rights of Man,\" and as\r\nit met with still greater approbation from the true friends of national\r\nfreedom, and went deeper into the system of Government, and exposed the\r\nabuses of it, more than had been done in the First Part, it consequently\r\nexcited an alarm among all those, who, insensible of the burthen of\r\ntaxes which the general mass of the people sustain, are living in luxury\r\nand indolence, and hunting after Court preferments, sinecure places, and\r\npensions, either for themselves, or for their family connections.\r\n\r\nI have shewn in that work, that the taxes may be reduced at least _six\r\nmillions_, and even then the expences of Government in England would be\r\ntwenty times greater than they are in the country I have already spoken\r\nof. That taxes may be entirely taken off from the poor, by remitting to\r\nthem in money at the rate of between _three and four pounds_ per head\r\nper annum, for the education and bringing up of the children of the poor\r\nfamilies, who are computed at one third of the whole nation, and _six\r\npounds_ per annum to all poor persons, decayed tradesmen, or others,\r\nfrom the age of fifty until sixty, and _ten pounds_ per annum from after\r\nsixty. And that in consequence of this allowance, to be paid out of the\r\nsurplus taxes, the poor-rates would become unnecessary, and that it is\r\nbetter to apply the surplus taxes to these beneficent purposes, _than to\r\nwaste them on idle and profligate courtiers, placemen, and pensioners_.\r\n\r\nThese, gentlemen, are a part of the plans and principles contained in\r\nthe work, which this meeting is now called upon, in an indirect manner,\r\nto vote an address against, and brand with the name of _wicked and\r\nseditious_. But that the work may speak for itself, I request leave to\r\nclose this part of my letter with an extract therefrom, in the following\r\nwords: [_Quotation the same as that on p. 26_.]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have now stated to you such matters as appear necessary\r\nto me to offer to the consideration of the meeting. I have no other\r\ninterest in what I am doing, nor in writing you this letter, than the\r\ninterest of the _heart_. I consider the proposed address as calculated\r\nto give countenance to placemen, pensioners, enormous taxation, and\r\ncorruption. Many of you will recollect, that whilst I resided among you,\r\nthere was not a man more firm and open in supporting the principles of\r\nliberty than myself, and I still pursue, and ever will, the same path.\r\n\r\nI have, Gentlemen, only one request to make, which is--that those\r\nwho have called the meeting will speak _out_, and say, whether in\r\nthe address they are going to present against publications, which the\r\nproclamation calls wicked, they mean the work entitled _Rights of Man_,\r\nor whether they do not?\r\n\r\nI am, Gentlemen, With sincere wishes for your happiness,\r\n\r\nYour friend and Servant,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. TO MR. SECRETARY DUNDAS.\r\n\r\nCalais, Sept. 15, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI CONCEIVE it necessary to make you acquainted with the following\r\ncircumstance:--The department of Calais having elected me a member\r\nof the National Convention of France, I set off from London the 13th\r\ninstant, in company with Mr. Frost, of Spring Garden, and Mr. Audibert,\r\none of the municipal officers of Calais, who brought me the certificate\r\nof my being elected. We had not arrived more, I believe, than five\r\nminutes at the York Hotel, at Dover, when the train of circumstances\r\nbegan that I am going to relate. We had taken our baggage out of the\r\ncarriage, and put it into a room, into which we went. Mr. Frost, having\r\noccasion to go out, was stopped in the passage by a gentleman, who told\r\nhim he must return into the room, which he did, and the gentleman came\r\nin with him, and shut the door. I had remained in the room; Mr. Audibert\r\nwas gone to inquire when the packet was to sail. The gentleman then\r\nsaid, that he was collector of the customs, and had an information\r\nagainst us, and must examine our baggage for prohibited articles. He\r\nproduced his commission as Collector. Mr. Frost demanded to see the\r\ninformation, which the Collector refused to shew, and continued to\r\nrefuse, on every demand that we made. The Collector then called in\r\nseveral other officers, and began first to search our pockets. He took\r\nfrom Mr. Audibert, who was then returned into the room, every thing\r\nhe found in his pocket, and laid it on the table. He then searched Mr.\r\nFrost in the same manner, (who, among other things, had the keys of the\r\ntrunks in his pocket,) and then did the same by me. Mr. Frost wanting\r\nto go out, mentioned it, and was going towards the door; on which the\r\nCollector placed himself against the door, and said, nobody should\r\ndepart the room. After the keys had been taken from Mr. Frost, (for I\r\nhad given him the keys of my trunks beforehand, for the purpose of his\r\nattending the baggage to the customs, if it should be necessary,) the\r\nCollector asked us to open the trunks, presenting us the keys for\r\nthat purpose; this we declined to do, unless he would produce his\r\ninformation, which he again refused. The Collector then opened the\r\ntrunks himself, and took out every paper and letter, sealed or unsealed.\r\nOn our remonstrating with him on the bad policy, as well as the\r\nillegality, of Custom-House officers seizing papers and letters, which\r\nwere things that did not come under their cognizance, he replied, that\r\nthe _Proclamation_ gave him the authority.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters which he took out of my trunk, were two sealed\r\nletters, given into my charge by the American Minister in London\r\n[Pinckney], one of which was directed to the American Minister at Paris\r\n[Gouverneur Morris], the other to a private gentleman; a letter from the\r\nPresident of the United States, and a letter from the Secretary of\r\nState in America, both directed to me, and which I had received from\r\nthe American Minister, now in London, and were private letters of\r\nfriendship; a letter from the electoral body of the Department of\r\nCalais, containing the notification of my being elected to the National\r\nConvention; and a letter from the President of the National Assembly,\r\ninforming me of my being also elected for the Department of the Oise.\r\n\r\nAs we found that all remonstrances with the Collector, on the bad policy\r\nand illegality of seizing papers and letters, and retaining our persons\r\nby force, under the pretence of searching for prohibited articles,\r\nwere vain, (for he justified himself on the Proclamation, and on the\r\ninformation which he refused to shew,) we contented ourselves with\r\nassuring him, that what he was then doing, he would afterwards have to\r\nanswer for, and left it to himself to do as he pleased.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to us that the Collector was acting under the direction of\r\nsome other person or persons, then in the hotel, but whom he did not\r\nchoose we should see, or who did not choose to be seen by us; for the\r\nCollector went several times out of the room for a few minutes, and was\r\nalso called out several times.\r\n\r\nWhen the Collector had taken what papers and letters he pleased out of\r\nthe trunks, he proceeded to read them. The first letter he took up for\r\nthis purpose was that from the President of the United States to me.\r\nWhile he was doing this, I said, that it was very extraordinary that\r\nGeneral Washington could not write a letter of private friendship to\r\nme, without its being subject to be read by a custom-house officer. Upon\r\nthis Mr. Frost laid his hand over the face of the letter, and told the\r\nCollector that he should not read it, and took it from him. Mr. Frost\r\nthen, casting his eyes on the concluding paragraph of the letter, said,\r\nI will read this part to you, which he did; of which the following is an\r\nexact transcript--\r\n\r\n\"And as no one can feel a greater interest in the happiness of mankind\r\nthan I do, it is the first wish of my heart, that the enlightened policy\r\nof the present age may diffuse to all men those blessings to which\r\nthey are entitled, and lay the foundation of happiness for future\r\ngenerations.\"(1)\r\n\r\nAs all the other letters and papers lay then on the table, the Collector\r\ntook them up, and was going out of the room with them. During the\r\ntransactions already stated, I contented myself with observing what\r\npassed, and spoke but little; but on seeing the Collector going out of\r\nthe room with the letters, I told him that the papers and letters then\r\nin his hand were either belonging to me, or entrusted to my charge, and\r\nthat as I could not permit them to be out of my sight, I must insist on\r\ngoing with him.\r\n\r\n     1 Washington's letter is dated 6 May, 1792. See my _Life of\r\n     Paine_ vol. i., p. 302.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nThe Collector then made a list of the letters and papers, and went out\r\nof the room, giving the letters and papers into the charge of one of\r\nthe officers. He returned in a short time, and, after some trifling\r\nconversation, chiefly about the Proclamation, told us, that he saw _the\r\nProclamation was ill-founded_, and asked if we chose to put the letters\r\nand papers into the trunks ourselves, which, as we had not taken them\r\nout, we declined doing, and he did it himself, and returned us the keys.\r\n\r\nIn stating to you these matters, I make no complaint against the\r\npersonal conduct of the Collector, or of any of the officers. Their\r\nmanner was as civil as such an extraordinary piece of business could\r\nadmit of.\r\n\r\nMy chief motive in writing to you on this subject is, that you may take\r\nmeasures for preventing the like in future, not only as it concerns\r\nprivate individuals, but in order to prevent a renewal of those\r\nunpleasant consequences that have heretofore arisen between nations from\r\ncircumstances equally as insignificant. I mention this only for myself;\r\nbut as the interruption extended to two other gentlemen, it is probable\r\nthat they, as individuals, will take some more effectual mode for\r\nredress.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, yours, &c.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nP. S. Among the papers seized, was a copy of the Attorney-General's\r\ninformation against me for publishing the _Rights of Man_, and a printed\r\nproof copy of my Letter to the Addressers, which will soon be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE ADDRESSERS ON THE LATE PROCLAMATION.(1)\r\n\r\nCOULD I have commanded circumstances with a wish, I know not of any that\r\nwould have more generally promoted the progress of knowledge, than\r\nthe late Proclamation, and the numerous rotten Borough and Corporation\r\nAddresses thereon. They have not only served as advertisements, but they\r\nhave excited a spirit of enquiry into principles of government, and a\r\ndesire to read the Rights OF Man, in places where that spirit and that\r\nwork were before unknown.\r\n\r\nThe people of England, wearied and stunned with parties, and alternately\r\ndeceived by each, had almost resigned the prerogative of thinking. Even\r\ncuriosity had expired, and a universal languor had spread itself over\r\nthe land. The opposition was visibly no other than a contest for power,\r\nwhilst the mass of the nation stood torpidly by as the prize.\r\n\r\nIn this hopeless state of things, the First Part of the Rights of\r\nMan made its appearance. It had to combat with a strange mixture\r\nof prejudice and indifference; it stood exposed to every species of\r\nnewspaper abuse; and besides this, it had to remove the obstructions\r\nwhich Mr. Burke's rude and outrageous attack on the French Revolution\r\nhad artfully raised.\r\n\r\n     1 The Royal Proclamation issued against seditious writings,\r\n     May 21st. This pamphlet, the proof of which was read in\r\n     Paris (see P. S. of preceding chapter), was published at 1s.\r\n     6d. by H. D. Symonds, Paternoster Row, and Thomas Clio\r\n     Rickman, 7 Upper Marylebone Street (where it was written),\r\n     both pub-Ushers being soon after prosecuted.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nBut how easy does even the most illiterate reader distinguish the\r\nspontaneous sensations of the heart, from the laboured productions of\r\nthe brain. Truth, whenever it can fully appear, is a thing so naturally\r\nfamiliar to the mind, that an acquaintance commences at first sight.\r\nNo artificial light, yet discovered, can display all the properties of\r\ndaylight; so neither can the best invented fiction fill the mind with\r\nevery conviction which truth begets.\r\n\r\nTo overthrow Mr. Burke's fallacious book was scarcely the operation of a\r\nday. Even the phalanx of Placemen and Pensioners, who had given the\r\ntone to the multitude, by clamouring forth his political fame, became\r\nsuddenly silent; and the final event to himself has been, that as he\r\nrose like a rocket, he fell like the stick.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens, that the mind rests satisfied with the simple\r\ndetection of error or imposition. Once put in motion, _that_ motion soon\r\nbecomes accelerated; where it had intended to stop, it discovers new\r\nreasons to proceed, and renews and continues the pursuit far beyond the\r\nlimits it first prescribed to itself. Thus it has happened to the people\r\nof England. From a detection of Mr. Burke's incoherent rhapsodies, and\r\ndistorted facts, they began an enquiry into the first principles of\r\nGovernment, whilst himself, like an object left far behind, became\r\ninvisible and forgotten.\r\n\r\nMuch as the First Part of RIGHTS OF Man impressed at its first\r\nappearance, the progressive mind soon discovered that it did not go far\r\nenough. It detected errors; it exposed absurdities; it shook the fabric\r\nof political superstition; it generated new ideas; but it did not\r\nproduce a regular system of principles in the room of those which it\r\ndisplaced. And, if I may guess at the mind of the Government-party,\r\nthey beheld it as an unexpected gale that would soon blow over, and\r\nthey forbore, like sailors in threatening weather, to whistle, lest they\r\nshould encrease(sic) the wind. Every thing, on their part, was profound\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhen the Second Part of _Rights of Man, combining Principle and\r\nPractice_, was preparing to appear, they affected, for a while, to act\r\nwith the same policy as before; but finding their silence had no more\r\ninfluence in stifling the progress of the work, than it would have in\r\nstopping the progress of time, they changed their plan, and affected\r\nto treat it with clamorous contempt. The Speech-making Placemen and\r\nPensioners, and Place-expectants, in both Houses of Parliament, the\r\n_Outs_ as well as the _Ins_, represented it as a silly, insignificant\r\nperformance; as a work incapable of producing any effect; as something\r\nwhich they were sure the good sense of the people would either despise\r\nor indignantly spurn; but such was the overstrained awkwardness with\r\nwhich they harangued and encouraged each other, that in the very act of\r\ndeclaring their confidence they betrayed their fears.\r\n\r\nAs most of the rotten Borough Addressers are obscured in holes and\r\ncorners throughout the country, and to whom a newspaper arrives as\r\nrarely as an almanac, they most probably have not had the opportunity of\r\nknowing how far this part of the farce (the original prelude to all the\r\nAddresses) has been acted. For _their_ information, I will suspend a\r\nwhile the more serious purpose of my Letter, and entertain them with two\r\nor three Speeches in the last Session of Parliament, which will serve\r\nthem for politics till Parliament meets again.\r\n\r\nYou must know, Gentlemen, that the Second Part of the Rights of Man (the\r\nbook against which you have been presenting Addresses, though it is\r\nmost probable that many of you did not know it) was to have come out\r\nprecisely at the time that Parliament last met. It happened not to be\r\npublished till a few days after. But as it was very well known that the\r\nbook would shortly appear, the parliamentary Orators entered into a very\r\ncordial coalition to cry the book down, and they began their attack by\r\ncrying up the _blessings_ of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHad it been your fate to have been there, you could not but have been\r\nmoved at the heart-and-pocket-felt congratulations that passed between\r\nall the parties on this subject of _blessings_; for the _Outs_ enjoy\r\nplaces and pensions and sinecures as well as the _Ins_, and are as\r\ndevoutly attached to the firm of the house.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous of this motley groupe, is the Clerk of\r\nthe Court of King's Bench, who calls himself Lord Stormont. He is also\r\ncalled Justice General of Scotland, and Keeper of Scoon, (an opposition\r\nman,) and he draws from the public for these nominal offices, not less,\r\nas I am informed, than six thousand pounds a-year, and he is, most\r\nprobably, at the trouble of counting the money, and signing a receipt,\r\nto shew, perhaps, that he is qualified to be Clerk as well as Justice.\r\nHe spoke as follows.(*)\r\n\r\n\"That we shall all be unanimous in expressing our attachment to the\r\nconstitution of these realms, I am confident. It is a subject upon which\r\nthere can be no divided opinion in this house. I do not pretend to be\r\ndeep read in the knowledge of the Constitution, but I take upon me to\r\nsay, that from the extent of my knowledge [_for I have so many thousands\r\na year for nothing_] it appears to me, that from the period of the\r\nRevolution, for it was by no means created then, it has been, both in\r\ntheory and practice, the wisest system that ever was formed. I never was\r\n[he means he never was till now] a dealer in political cant. My life has\r\nnot been occupied in that way, but the speculations of late years seem\r\nto have taken a turn, for which I cannot account. When I came into\r\npublic life, the political pamphlets of the time, however they might be\r\ncharged with the heat and violence of parties, were agreed in extolling\r\nthe radical beauties of the Constitution itself. I remember [_he means\r\nhe has forgotten_] a most captivating eulogium on its charms, by Lord\r\nBolingbroke, where he recommends his readers to contemplate it in all\r\nits aspects, with the assurance that it would be found more estimable\r\nthe more it was seen, I do not recollect his precise words, but I wish\r\nthat men who write upon these subjects would take this for their\r\nmodel, instead of the political pamphlets, which, I am told, are now in\r\ncirculation, [_such, I suppose, as Rights of Man,_] pamphlets which\r\nI have not read, and whose purport I know only by report, [_he means,\r\nperhaps, by the noise they make_.] This, however, I am sure, that\r\npamphlets tending to unsettle the public reverence for the constitution,\r\nwill have very little influence. They can do very little harm--for\r\n[_by the bye, he is no dealer in political cant_] the English are a\r\nsober-thinking people, and are more intelligent, more solid, more steady\r\nin their opinions, than any people I ever had the fortune to see. [_This\r\nis pretty well laid on, though, for a new beginner_.] But if there\r\nshould ever come a time when the propagation of those doctrines should\r\nagitate the public mind, I am sure for every one of your Lordships, that\r\nno attack will be made on the constitution, from which it is truly said\r\nthat we derive all our prosperity, without raising every one of\r\nyour Lordships to its support It will then be found that there is no\r\ndifference among us, but that we are all determined to stand or fall\r\ntogether, in defence of the inestimable system \"--[_of places and\r\npensions_].\r\n\r\n     * See his speech in the Morning Chronicle of Feb. 1.--\r\n     Author.\r\n\r\nAfter Stormont, on the opposition side, sat down, up rose another noble\r\nLord, on the ministerial side, Grenville. This man ought to be as strong\r\nin the back as a mule, or the sire of a mule, or it would crack with\r\nthe weight of places and offices. He rose, however, without feeling any\r\nincumbrance, full master of his weight; and thus said this noble Lord to\r\nt'other noble Lord!\r\n\r\n\"The patriotic and manly manner in which the noble Lord has declared\r\nhis sentiments on the subject of the constitution, demands my cordial\r\napprobation. The noble Viscount has proved, that however we may differ\r\non particular measures, amidst all the jars and dissonance of parties,\r\nwe are unanimous in principle. There is a perfect and entire consent\r\n[_between us_] in the love and maintenance of the constitution as\r\nhappily subsisting. It must undoubtedly give your Lordships concern, to\r\nfind that the time is come [heigh ho!] when there is propriety in the\r\nexpressions of regard to [o! o! o!] the constitution. And that there are\r\nmen [confound--their--po-li-tics] who disseminate doctrines hostile to\r\nthe genuine spirit of our well balanced system, [_it is certainly well\r\nbalanced when both sides hold places and pensions at once._] I agree\r\nwith the noble viscount that they have not [I hope] much success. I am\r\nconvinced that there is no danger to be apprehended from their attempts:\r\nbut it is truly important and consolatory [to us placemen, I suppose] to\r\nknow, that if ever there should arise a serious alarm, there is but one\r\nspirit, one sense, [_and that sense I presume is not common sense_]\r\nand one determination in this house \"--which undoubtedly is to hold all\r\ntheir places and pensions as long as they can.\r\n\r\nBoth those speeches (except the parts enclosed in parenthesis, which\r\nare added for the purpose of illustration) are copied verbatim from the\r\nMorning Chronicle of the 1st of February last; and when the situation of\r\nthe speakers is considered, the one in the opposition, and the other\r\nin the ministry, and both of them living at the public expence, by\r\nsinecure, or nominal places and offices, it required a very unblushing\r\nfront to be able to deliver them. Can those men seriously suppose\r\nany nation to be so completely blind as not to see through them? Can\r\nStormont imagine that the political _cant_, with which he has larded his\r\nharangue, will conceal the craft? Does he not know that there never was\r\na cover large enough to hide _itself_? Or can Grenvilie believe that his\r\ncredit with the public encreases with his avarice for places?\r\n\r\nBut, if these orators will accept a service from me, in return for the\r\nallusions they have made to the _Rights of Man_, I will make a speech\r\nfor either of them to deliver, on the excellence of the constitution,\r\nthat shall be as much to the purpose as what they have spoken, or as\r\n_Bolingbroke's captivating eulogium_. Here it is.\r\n\r\n\"That we shall all be unanimous in expressing our attachment to the\r\nconstitution, I am confident. It is, my Lords, incomprehensibly good:\r\nbut the great wonder of all is the wisdom; for it is, my lords, _the\r\nwisest system that ever was formed_.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to us, noble Lords, though the world does not know it, it\r\nis very well known to us, that we have more wisdom than we know what to\r\ndo with; and what is still better, my Lords, we have it all in stock. I\r\ndefy your Lordships to prove, that a tittle of it has been used yet; and\r\nif we but go on, my Lords, with the frugality we have hitherto done, we\r\nshall leave to our heirs and successors, when we go out of the world,\r\nthe whole stock of wisdom, _untouched_, that we brought in; and there is\r\nno doubt but they will follow our example. This, my lords, is one of the\r\nblessed effects of the hereditary system; for we can never be without\r\nwisdom so long as we keep it by us, and do not use it.\r\n\r\n\"But, my Lords, as all this wisdom is hereditary property, for the sole\r\nbenefit of us and our heirs, and it is necessary that the people should\r\nknow where to get a supply for their own use, the excellence of our\r\nconstitution has provided us a King for this very purpose, and for _no\r\nother_. But, my Lords, I perceive a defect to which the constitution\r\nis subject, and which I propose to remedy by bringing a bill into\r\nParliament for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The constitution, my Lords, out of delicacy, I presume, has left it as\r\na matter of _choice_ to a King whether he will be wise or not. It has\r\nnot, I mean, my Lords, insisted upon it as a constitutional point,\r\nwhich, I conceive it ought to have done; for I pledge myself to your\r\nLordships to prove, and that with _true patriotic boldness_, that he has\r\n_no choice in the matter_. This bill, my Lords, which I shall bring in,\r\nwill be to declare, that the constitution, according to the true intent\r\nand meaning thereof, does not invest the King with this choice; our\r\nancestors were too wise to do that; and, in order to prevent any doubts\r\nthat might otherwise arise, I shall prepare, my Lords, an enacting\r\nclause, to fix the wisdom of Kings by act of Parliament; and then, my\r\nLords our Constitution will be the wonder of the world!\r\n\r\n\"Wisdom, my lords, is the one thing needful: but that there may be no\r\nmistake in this matter, and that we may proceed consistently with the\r\ntrue wisdom of the constitution, I shall propose a _certain criterion_\r\nwhereby the _exact quantity of wisdom_ necessary for a King may be\r\nknown. [Here should be a cry of, Hear him! Hear him!]\r\n\r\n\"It is recorded, my Lords, in the Statutes at Large of the Jews, 'a\r\nbook, my Lords, which I have not read, and whose purport I know only by\r\nreport,' _but perhaps the bench of Bishops can recollect something about\r\nit_, that Saul gave the most convincing proofs of royal wisdom before\r\nhe was made a King, _for he was sent to seek his father's asses and he\r\ncould not find them_.\r\n\r\n\"Here, my Lords, we have, most happily for us, a case in point: This\r\nprecedent ought to be established by act of Parliament; and every King,\r\nbefore he be crowned, should be sent to seek his father's asses, and\r\nif he cannot find them, he shall be declared wise enough to be King,\r\naccording to the true meaning of our excellent constitution. All,\r\ntherefore, my Lords, that will be necessary to be done by the enacting\r\nclause that I shall bring in, will be to invest the King beforehand with\r\nthe quantity of wisdom necessary for this purpose, lest he should happen\r\nnot to possess it; and this, my Lords, we can do without making use of\r\nany of our own.\r\n\r\n\"We further read, my Lords, in the said Statutes at Large of the\r\nJews, that Samuel, who certainly was as mad as any Man-of-Rights-Man\r\nnow-a-days (hear him! hear him!), was highly displeased, and even\r\nexasperated, at the proposal of the Jews to have a King, and he warned\r\nthem against it with all that assurance and impudence of which he was\r\nmaster. I have been, my Lords, at the trouble of going all the way to\r\n_Paternoster-row_, to procure an extract from the printed copy. I was\r\ntold that I should meet with it there, or in _Amen-eorner_, for I was\r\nthen going, my Lords, to rummage for it among the curiosities of the\r\n_Antiquarian Society_. I will read the extracts to your Lordships, to\r\nshew how little Samuel knew of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"The extract, my Lords, is from 1 Sam. chap. viii.:\r\n\r\n\"'And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked\r\nof him a King.\r\n\r\n\"'And he said, this will be the manner of the King that shall reign\r\nover you: he will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for\r\nhis chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his\r\nchariots.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over\r\nfifties, and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest,\r\nand to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take your daughters to be confectionnes, and to be cooks,\r\nand to be bakers.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your\r\nolive-yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and\r\ngive to his officers and to his servants.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your\r\ngoodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall be his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\"'And ye shall cry out in that day, because of your King, which ye shall\r\nhave chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, my Lords, what can we think of this man Samuel? Is there a word of\r\ntruth, or any thing like truth, in all that he has said? He pretended\r\nto be a prophet, or a wise man, but has not the event proved him to be a\r\nfool, or an incendiary? Look around, my Lords, and see if any thing has\r\nhappened that he pretended to foretell! Has not the most profound peace\r\nreigned throughout the world ever since Kings were in fashion? Are not,\r\nfor example, the present Kings of Europe the most peaceable of mankind,\r\nand the Empress of Russia the very milk of human kindness? It would not\r\nbe worth having Kings, my Lords, if it were not that they never go to\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"If we look at home, my Lords, do we not see the same things here as are\r\nseen every where else? Are our young men taken to be horsemen, or foot\r\nsoldiers, any more than in Germany or in Prussia, or in Hanover or in\r\nHesse? Are not our sailors as safe at land as at sea? Are they ever\r\ndragged from their homes, like oxen to the slaughter-house, to serve on\r\nboard ships of war? When they return from the perils of a long voyage\r\nwith the merchandize of distant countries, does not every man sit down\r\nunder his own vine and his own fig-tree, in perfect security? Is the\r\ntenth of our seed taken by tax-gatherers, or is any part of it given to\r\nthe King's servants? In short, _is not everything as free from taxes as\r\nthe light from Heaven!_ (1)\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my Lords, do we not see the blessed effect of having Kings in every\r\nthing we look at? Is not the G. R., or the broad R., stampt upon every\r\nthing? Even the shoes, the gloves, and the hats that we wear,\r\nare enriched with the impression, and all our candles blaze a\r\nburnt-offering.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these blessings, my Lords, that cover us from the sole of the\r\nfoot to the crown of the head, do we not see a race of youths growing\r\nup to be Kings, who are the very paragons of virtue? There is not one of\r\nthem, my Lords, but might be trusted with untold gold, as safely as\r\nthe other. Are they not '_more sober, intelligent, more solid, more\r\nsteady_,' and withal, _more learned, more wise, more every thing, than\r\nany youths we '_ever had the fortune to see.' Ah! my Lords, they are a\r\n_hopeful family_.\r\n\r\n\"The blessed prospect of succession, which the nation has at this moment\r\nbefore its eyes, is a most undeniable proof of the excellence of our\r\nconstitution, and of the blessed hereditary system; for nothing, my\r\nLords, but a constitution founded on the truest and purest wisdom\r\ncould admit such heaven-born and heaven-taught characters into the\r\ngovernment.--Permit me now, my Lords, to recal your attention to the\r\nlibellous chapter I have just read about Kings. I mention this, my\r\nLords, because it is my intention to move for a bill to be brought into\r\nparliament to expunge that chapter from the Bible, and that the Lord\r\nChancellor, with the assistance of the Prince of Wales, the Duke of\r\nYork, and the Duke of Clarence, be requested to write a chapter in the\r\nroom of it; and that Mr. Burke do see that it be truly canonical, and\r\nfaithfully inserted.\"--Finis.\r\n\r\n     1 Allusion to the window-tax.--Editor,\r\n\r\nIf the Clerk of the Court of King's Bench should chuse to be the orator\r\nof this luminous encomium on the constitution, I hope he will get\r\nit well by heart before he attempts to deliver it, and not have\r\nto apologize to Parliament, as he did in the case of Bolingbroke's\r\nencomium, for forgetting his lesson; and, with this admonition I leave\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHaving thus informed the Addressers of what passed at the meeting of\r\nParliament, I return to take up the subject at the part where I broke\r\noff in order to introduce the preceding speeches.\r\n\r\nI was then stating, that the first policy of the Government party was\r\nsilence, and the next, clamorous contempt; but as people generally\r\nchoose to read and judge for themselves, the work still went on, and the\r\naffectation of contempt, like the silence that preceded it, passed for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThus foiled in their second scheme, their evil genius, like a\r\nwill-with-a-wisp, led them to a third; when all at once, as if it had\r\nbeen unfolded to them by a fortune-teller, or Mr. Dundas had discovered\r\nit by second sight, this once harmless, insignificant book, without\r\nundergoing the alteration of a single letter, became a most wicked and\r\ndangerous Libel. The whole Cabinet, like a ship's crew, became alarmed;\r\nall hands were piped upon deck, as if a conspiracy of elements was\r\nforming around them, and out came the Proclamation and the Prosecution;\r\nand Addresses supplied the place of prayers.\r\n\r\nYe silly swains, thought I to myself, why do you torment yourselves\r\nthus? The Rights OF Man is a book calmly and rationally written; why\r\nthen are you so disturbed? Did you see how little or how suspicious such\r\nconduct makes you appear, even cunning alone, had you no other faculty,\r\nwould hush you into prudence. The plans, principles, and arguments,\r\ncontained in that work, are placed before the eyes of the nation, and\r\nof the world, in a fair, open, and manly manner, and nothing more is\r\nnecessary than to refute them. Do this, and the whole is done; but if ye\r\ncannot, so neither can ye suppress the reading, nor convict the author;\r\nfor the Law, in the opinion of all good men, would convict itself, that\r\nshould condemn what cannot be refuted.\r\n\r\nHaving now shown the Addressers the several stages of the business,\r\nprior to their being called upon, like Cæsar in the Tyber, crying to\r\nCassius, \"_help, Cassius, or I sink_!\" I next come to remark on the\r\npolicy of the Government, in promoting Addresses; on the consequences\r\nnaturally resulting therefrom; and on the conduct of the persons\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the policy, it evidently carries with it every mark\r\nand feature of disguised fear. And it will hereafter be placed in the\r\nhistory of extraordinary things, that a pamphlet should be produced by\r\nan individual, unconnected with any sect or party, and not seeking to\r\nmake any, and almost a stranger in the land, that should compleatly\r\nfrighten a whole Government, and that in the midst of its most\r\ntriumphant security. Such a circumstance cannot fail to prove, that\r\neither the pamphlet has irresistible powers, or the Government very\r\nextraordinary defects, or both. The nation exhibits no signs of fear at\r\nthe Rights of Man; why then should the Government, unless the interest\r\nof the two are really opposite to each other, and the secret is\r\nbeginning to be known? That there are two distinct classes of men in\r\nthe nation, those who pay taxes, and those who receive and live upon\r\nthe taxes, is evident at first sight; and when taxation is carried to\r\nexcess, it cannot fail to disunite those two, and something of this kind\r\nis now beginning to appear.\r\n\r\nIt is also curious to observe, amidst all the fume and bustle about\r\nProclamations and Addresses, kept up by a few noisy and interested men,\r\nhow little the mass of the nation seem to care about either. They\r\nappear to me, by the indifference they shew, not to believe a word the\r\nProclamation contains; and as to the Addresses, they travel to London\r\nwith the silence of a funeral, and having announced their arrival in\r\nthe Gazette, are deposited with the ashes of their predecessors, and Mr.\r\nDundas writes their _hic facet_.\r\n\r\nOne of the best effects which the Proclamation, and its echo the\r\nAddresses have had, has been that of exciting and spreading curiosity;\r\nand it requires only a single reflection to discover, that the object\r\nof all curiosity is knowledge. When the mass of the nation saw that\r\nPlacemen, Pensioners, and Borough-mongers, were the persons that stood\r\nforward to promote Addresses, it could not fail to create suspicions\r\nthat the public good was not their object; that the character of the\r\nbooks, or writings, to which such persons obscurely alluded, not daring\r\nto mention them, was directly contrary to what they described them to\r\nbe, and that it was necessary that every man, for his own satisfaction,\r\nshould exercise his proper right, and read and judge for himself.\r\n\r\nBut how will the persons who have been induced to read the _Rights of\r\nMan_, by the clamour that has been raised against it, be surprized\r\nto find, that, instead of a wicked, inflammatory work, instead of a\r\nlicencious and profligate performance, it abounds with principles of\r\ngovernment that are uncontrovertible--with arguments which every reader\r\nwill feel, are unanswerable--with plans for the increase of commerce\r\nand manufactures--for the extinction of war--for the education of\r\nthe children of the poor--for the comfortable support of the aged and\r\ndecayed persons of both sexes--for the relief of the army and navy, and,\r\nin short, for the promotion of every thing that can benefit the moral,\r\ncivil, and political condition of Man.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, some calm observer will ask, why is the work prosecuted, if\r\nthese be the goodly matters it contains? I will tell thee, friend;\r\nit contains also a plan for the reduction of Taxes, for lessening the\r\nimmense expences of Government, for abolishing sinecure Places and\r\nPensions; and it proposes applying the redundant taxes, that shall\r\nbe saved by these reforms, to the purposes mentioned in the former\r\nparagraph, instead of applying them to the support of idle and\r\nprofligate Placemen and Pensioners.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, any wonder that Placemen and Pensioners, and the whole\r\ntrain of Court expectants, should become the promoters of Addresses,\r\nProclamations, and Prosecutions? or, is it any wonder that Corporations\r\nand rotten Boroughs, which are attacked and exposed, both in the First\r\nand Second Parts of _Rights of Man_, as unjust monopolies and public\r\nnuisances, should join in the cavalcade? Yet these are the sources from\r\nwhich Addresses have sprung. Had not such persons come forward to\r\noppose the _Rights of Man_, I should have doubted the efficacy of my\r\nown writings: but those opposers have now proved to me that the blow was\r\nwell directed, and they have done it justice by confessing the smart.\r\n\r\nThe principal deception in this business of Addresses has been, that the\r\npromoters of them have not come forward in their proper characters. They\r\nhave assumed to pass themselves upon the public as a part of the Public,\r\nbearing a share of the burthen of Taxes, and acting for the public good;\r\nwhereas, they are in general that part of it that adds to the public\r\nburthen, by living on the produce of the public taxes. They are to the\r\npublic what the locusts are to the tree: the burthen would be less, and\r\nthe prosperity would be greater, if they were shaken off.\r\n\r\n\"I do not come here,\" said Onslow, at the Surry County meeting, \"as the\r\nLord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county, but I come here as\r\na plain country gentleman.\" The fact is, that he came there as what he\r\nwas, and as no other, and consequently he came as one of the beings I\r\nhave been describing. If it be the character of a gentleman to be fed by\r\nthe public, as a pauper is by the parish, Onslow has a fair claim to the\r\ntitle; and the same description will suit the Duke of Richmond, who led\r\nthe Address at the Sussex meeting. He also may set up for a gentleman.\r\n\r\nAs to the meeting in the next adjoining county (Kent), it was a scene of\r\ndisgrace. About two hundred persons met, when a small part of them drew\r\nprivately away from the rest, and voted an Address: the consequence of\r\nwhich was that they got together by the ears, and produced a riot in the\r\nvery act of producing an Address to prevent Riots.\r\n\r\nThat the Proclamation and the Addresses have failed of their intended\r\neffect, may be collected from the silence which the Government party\r\nitself observes. The number of addresses has been weekly retailed in the\r\nGazette; but the number of Addressers has been concealed. Several of the\r\nAddresses have been voted by not more than ten or twelve persons; and a\r\nconsiderable number of them by not more than thirty. The whole number of\r\nAddresses presented at the time of writing this letter is three hundred\r\nand twenty, (rotten Boroughs and Corporations included) and even\r\nadmitting, on an average, one hundred Addressers to each address, the\r\nwhole number of addressers would be but thirty-two thousand, and nearly\r\nthree months have been taken up in procuring this number. That the\r\nsuccess of the Proclamation has been less than the success of the work\r\nit was intended to discourage, is a matter within my own knowledge; for\r\na greater number of the cheap edition of the First and Second Parts of\r\nthe Rights OF Man has been sold in the space only of one month, than the\r\nwhole number of Addressers (admitting them to be thirty-two thousand)\r\nhave amounted to in three months.\r\n\r\nIt is a dangerous attempt in any government to say to a Nation, \"_thou\r\nshalt not read_.\" This is now done in Spain, and was formerly done under\r\nthe old Government of France; but it served to procure the downfall of\r\nthe latter, and is subverting that of the former; and it will have\r\nthe same tendency in all countries; because _thought_ by some means\r\nor other, is got abroad in the world, and cannot be restrained, though\r\nreading may.\r\n\r\nIf _Rights of Man_ were a book that deserved the vile description which\r\nthe promoters of the Address have given of it, why did not these men\r\nprove their charge, and satisfy the people, by producing it, and reading\r\nit publicly? This most certainly ought to have been done, and would also\r\nhave been done, had they believed it would have answered their purpose.\r\nBut the fact is, that the book contains truths which those time-servers\r\ndreaded to hear, and dreaded that the people should know; and it is now\r\nfollowing up the,\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO ADDRESSERS.\r\n\r\nAddresses in every part of the nation, and convicting them of\r\nfalsehoods.\r\n\r\nAmong the unwarrantable proceedings to which the Proclamation has given\r\nrise, the meetings of the Justices in several of the towns and counties\r\nought to be noticed.. Those men have assumed to re-act the farce of\r\nGeneral Warrants, and to suppress, by their own authority, whatever\r\npublications they please. This is an attempt at power equalled only by\r\nthe conduct of the minor despots of the most despotic governments in\r\nEurope, and yet those Justices affect to call England a Free Country.\r\nBut even this, perhaps, like the scheme for garrisoning the country\r\nby building military barracks, is necessary to awaken the country to a\r\nsense of its Rights, and, as such, it will have a good effect.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the conduct of such Justices has been, that of\r\nthreatening to take away the licences from taverns and public-houses,\r\nwhere the inhabitants of the neighbourhood associated to read and\r\ndiscuss the principles of Government, and to inform each other thereon.\r\nThis, again, is similar to what is doing in Spain and Russia; and the\r\nreflection which it cannot fail to suggest is, that the principles and\r\nconduct of any Government must be bad, when that Government dreads and\r\nstartles at discussion, and seeks security by a prevention of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf the Government, or the Constitution, or by whatever name it be\r\ncalled, be that miracle of perfection which the Proclamation and\r\nthe Addresses have trumpeted it forth to be, it ought to have defied\r\ndiscussion and investigation, instead of dreading it. Whereas, every\r\nattempt it makes, either by Proclamation, Prosecution, or Address, to\r\nsuppress investigation, is a confession that it feels itself unable to\r\nbear it. It is error only, and not truth, that shrinks from enquiry. All\r\nthe numerous pamphlets, and all the newspaper falsehood and abuse, that\r\nhave been published against the Rights of Man, have fallen before it\r\nlike pointless arrows; and, in like manner, would any work have fallen\r\nbefore the Constitution, had the Constitution, as it is called, been\r\nfounded on as good political principles as those on which the Rights OF\r\nMan is written.\r\n\r\nIt is a good Constitution for courtiers, placemen, pensioners,\r\nborough-holders, and the leaders of Parties, and these are the men that\r\nhave been the active leaders of Addresses; but it is a bad Constitution\r\nfor at least ninety-nine parts of the nation out of an hundred, and this\r\ntruth is every day making its way.\r\n\r\nIt is bad, first, because it entails upon the nation the unnecessary\r\nexpence of supporting three forms and systems of Government at once,\r\nnamely, the monarchical, the aristocratical, and the democratical.\r\n\r\nSecondly, because it is impossible to unite such a discordant\r\ncomposition by any other means than perpetual corruption; and therefore\r\nthe corruption so loudly and so universally complained of, is no\r\nother than the natural consequence of such an unnatural compound of\r\nGovernments; and in this consists that excellence which the numerous\r\nherd of placemen and pensioners so loudly extol, and which at the same\r\ntime, occasions that enormous load of taxes under which the rest of the\r\nnation groans.\r\n\r\nAmong the mass of national delusions calculated to amuse and impose upon\r\nthe multitude, the standing one has been that of flattering them into\r\ntaxes, by calling the Government (or as they please to express it,\r\nthe English Constitution) \"_the envy and the admiration of the world_\"\r\nScarcely an Address has been voted in which some of the speakers have\r\nnot uttered this hackneyed nonsensical falsehood.\r\n\r\nTwo Revolutions have taken place, those of America and France; and both\r\nof them have rejected the unnatural compounded system of the English\r\ngovernment. America has declared against all hereditary Government, and\r\nestablished the representative system of Government only. France has\r\nentirely rejected the aristocratical part, and is now discovering\r\nthe absurdity of the monarchical, and is approaching fast to the\r\nrepresentative system. On what ground then, do these men continue a\r\ndeclaration, respecting what they call the _envy and admiration of other\r\nnations_, which the voluntary practice of such nations, as have had the\r\nopportunity of establishing Government, contradicts and falsifies. Will\r\nsuch men never confine themselves to truth? Will they be for ever the\r\ndeceivers of the people?\r\n\r\nBut I will go further, and shew, that were Government now to begin in\r\nEngland, the people could not be brought to establish the same system\r\nthey now submit to.\r\n\r\nIn speaking on this subject (or on any other) _on the pure ground\r\nof principle_, antiquity and precedent cease to be authority, and\r\nhoary-headed error loses its effect. The reasonableness and propriety of\r\nthings must be examined abstractedly from custom and usage; and, in this\r\npoint of view, the right which grows into practice to-day is as much a\r\nright, and as old in principle and theory, as if it had the customary\r\nsanction of a thousand ages. Principles have no connection with time,\r\nnor characters with names.\r\n\r\nTo say that the Government of this country is composed of King, Lords,\r\nand Commons, is the mere phraseology of custom. It is composed of\r\nmen; and whoever the men be to whom the Government of any country is\r\nintrusted, they ought to be the best and wisest that can be found, and\r\nif they are not so, they are not fit for the station. A man derives\r\nno more excellence from the change of a name, or calling him King, or\r\ncalling him Lord, than I should do by changing my name from Thomas to\r\nGeorge, or from Paine to Guelph. I should not be a whit more able to\r\nwrite a book because my name was altered; neither would any man, now\r\ncalled a King or a lord, have a whit the more sense than he now has,\r\nwere he to call himself Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nAs to the word \"Commons,\" applied as it is in England, it is a term\r\nof degradation and reproach, and ought to be abolished. It is a term\r\nunknown in free countries.\r\n\r\nBut to the point.--Let us suppose that Government was now to begin in\r\nEngland, and that the plan of Government, offered to the nation for its\r\napprobation or rejection, consisted of the following parts:\r\n\r\nFirst--That some one individual should be taken from all the rest of the\r\nnation, and to whom all the rest should swear obedience, and never be\r\npermitted to sit down in his presence, and that they should give to him\r\none million sterling a year.--That the nation should never after have\r\npower or authority to make laws but with his express consent; and that\r\nhis sons and his sons' sons, whether wise or foolish, good men or\r\nbad, fit or unfit, should have the same power, and also the same money\r\nannually paid to them for ever.\r\n\r\nSecondly--That there should be two houses of Legislators to assist in\r\nmaking laws, one of which should, in the first instance, be entirely\r\nappointed by the aforesaid person, and that their sons and their sons'\r\nsons, whether wise or foolish, good men or bad, fit or unfit, should for\r\never after be hereditary Legislators.\r\n\r\nThirdly--That the other house should be chosen in the same manner as the\r\nhouse now called the House of Commons is chosen, and should be subject\r\nto the controul of the two aforesaid hereditary Powers in all things.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to cram such a farrago of imposition and\r\nabsurdity down the throat of this or any other nation that was capable\r\nof reasoning upon its rights and its interest.\r\n\r\nThey would ask, in the first place, on what ground of right, or on what\r\nprinciple, such irrational and preposterous distinctions could, or ought\r\nto be made; and what pretensions any man could have, or what services he\r\ncould render, to entitle him to a million a year? They would go\r\nfarther, and revolt at the idea of consigning their children, and their\r\nchildren's children, to the domination of persons hereafter to be born,\r\nwho might, for any thing they could foresee, turn out to be knaves or\r\nfools; and they would finally discover, that the project of hereditary\r\nGovernors and Legislators _was a treasonable usurpation over the rights\r\nof posterity_. Not only the calm dictates of reason, and the force of\r\nnatural affection, but the integrity of manly pride, would impel men to\r\nspurn such proposals.\r\n\r\nFrom the grosser absurdities of such a scheme, they would extend their\r\nexamination to the practical defects--They would soon see that it would\r\nend in tyranny accomplished by fraud. That in the operation of it, it\r\nwould be two to one against them, because the two parts that were to be\r\nmade hereditary would form a common interest, and stick to each other;\r\nand that themselves and representatives would become no better\r\nthan hewers of wood and drawers of water for the other parts of the\r\nGovernment.--Yet call one of those powers King, the other Lords, and the\r\nthird the Commons, and it gives the model of what is called the English\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI have asserted, and have shewn, both in the First and Second Parts\r\nof _Rights of Man_, that there is not such a thing as an English\r\nConstitution, and that the people have yet a Constitution to form. _A\r\nConstitution is a thing antecedent to a Government; it is the act of a\r\npeople creating a Government and giving it powers, and defining the\r\nlimits and exercise of the powers so given_. But whenever did the people\r\nof England, acting in their original constituent character, by a\r\ndelegation elected for that express purpose, declare and say, \"We, the\r\npeople of this land, do constitute and appoint this to be our system and\r\nform of Government.\" The Government has assumed to constitute itself,\r\nbut it never was constituted by the people, in whom alone the right of\r\nconstituting resides.\r\n\r\nI will here recite the preamble to the Federal Constitution of the\r\nUnited States of America. I have shewn in the Second Part of _Rights\r\nof Man_, the manner by which the Constitution was formed and afterwards\r\nratified; and to which I refer the reader. The preamble is in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"We, the people, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for\r\ncommon defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings\r\nof liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nconstitution for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThen follow the several articles which appoint the manner in which the\r\nseveral component parts of the Government, legislative and executive,\r\nshall be elected, and the period of their duration, and the powers they\r\nshall have: also, the manner by which future additions, alterations,\r\nor amendments, shall be made to the constitution. Consequently, every\r\nimprovement that can be made in the science of government, follows in\r\nthat country as a matter of order. It is only in Governments founded on\r\nassumption and false principles, that reasoning upon, and investigating\r\nsystems and principles of Government, and shewing their several\r\nexcellencies and defects, are termed libellous and seditious. These\r\nterms were made part of the charge brought against Locke, Hampden, and\r\nSydney, and will continue to be brought against all good men, so long as\r\nbad government shall continue.\r\n\r\nThe Government of this country has been ostentatiously giving challenges\r\nfor more than an hundred years past, upon what it called its own\r\nexcellence and perfection. Scarcely a King's Speech, or a Parliamentary\r\nSpeech, has been uttered, in which this glove has not been thrown, till\r\nthe world has been insulted with their challenges. But it now appears\r\nthat all this was vapour and vain boasting, or that it was intended to\r\nconceal abuses and defects, and hush the people into taxes. I have taken\r\nthe challenge up, and in behalf of the public have shewn, in a fair,\r\nopen, and candid manner, both the radical and practical defects of the\r\nsystem; when, lo! those champions of the Civil List have fled away,\r\nand sent the Attorney-General to deny the challenge, by turning the\r\nacceptance of it into an attack, and defending their Places and Pensions\r\nby a prosecution.\r\n\r\nI will here drop this part of the subject, and state a few particulars\r\nrespecting the prosecution now pending, by which the Addressers will\r\nsee that they have been used as tools to the prosecuting party and their\r\ndependents. The case is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe original edition of the First and Second Parts of the Rights of\r\nMan, having been expensively printed, (in the modern stile of printing\r\npamphlets, that they might be bound up with Mr. Burke's Reflections on\r\nthe French Revolution,) the high price(1) precluded the generality\r\nof people from purchasing; and many applications were made to me from\r\nvarious parts of the country to print the work in a cheaper manner. The\r\npeople of Sheffield requested leave to print two thousand copies for\r\nthemselves, with which request I immediately complied. The same request\r\ncame to me from Rotherham, from Leicester, from Chester, from several\r\ntowns in Scotland; and Mr. James Mackintosh, author of _Vindico\r\nGallico_, brought me a request from Warwickshire, for leave to print ten\r\nthousand copies in that county. I had already sent a cheap edition to\r\nScotland; and finding the applications increase, I concluded that the\r\nbest method of complying therewith, would be to print a very numerous\r\nedition in London, under my own direction, by which means the work would\r\nbe more perfect, and the price be reduced lower than it could be by\r\n_printing_ small editions in the country, of only a few thousands each.\r\n\r\n     1 Half  a crown.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nThe cheap edition of the first part was begun about the first of last\r\nApril, and from that moment, and not before, I expected a prosecution,\r\nand the event has proved that I was not mistaken. I had then occasion to\r\nwrite to Mr. Thomas Walker of Manchester, and after informing him of my\r\nintention of giving up the work for the purpose of general information,\r\nI informed him of what I apprehended would be the consequence; that\r\nwhile the work was at a price that precluded an extensive circulation,\r\nthe government party, not able to controvert the plans, arguments,\r\nand principles it contained, had chosen to remain silent; but that I\r\nexpected they would make an attempt to deprive the mass of the nation,\r\nand especially the poor, of the right of reading, by the pretence of\r\nprosecuting either the Author or the Publisher, or both. They chose to\r\nbegin with the Publisher.\r\n\r\nNearly a month, however, passed, before I had any information given me\r\nof their intentions. I was then at Bromley, in Kent, upon which I came\r\nimmediately to town, (May 14) and went to Mr. Jordan, the publisher of\r\nthe original edition. He had that evening been served with a summons to\r\nappear at the Court of King's Bench, on the Monday following, but for\r\nwhat purpose was not stated. Supposing it to be on account of the\r\nwork, I appointed a meeting with him on the next morning, which was\r\naccordingly had, when I provided an attorney, and took the ex-pence of\r\nthe defence on myself. But finding afterwards that he absented himself\r\nfrom the attorney employed, and had engaged another, and that he had\r\nbeen closeted with the Solicitors of the Treasury, I left him to follow\r\nhis own choice, and he chose to plead Guilty. This he might do if he\r\npleased; and I make no objection against him for it. I believe that his\r\nidea by the word _Guilty_, was no other than declaring himself to be the\r\npublisher, without any regard to the merits or demerits of the work; for\r\nwere it to be construed otherwise, it would amount to the absurdity of\r\nconverting a publisher into a Jury, and his confession into a verdict\r\nupon the work itself. This would be the highest possible refinement upon\r\npacking of Juries.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, they commenced their prosecution against me, as the\r\nauthor, by leaving a summons at my lodgings in town, to appear at the\r\nCourt of King's Bench on the 8th of June following; and on the same day,\r\n(May 21,) _they issued also their Proclamation_. Thus the Court of St.\r\nJames and the Court of King's Bench, were playing into each other's\r\nhands at the same instant of time, and the farce of Addresses brought up\r\nthe rear; and this mode of proceeding is called by the prostituted name\r\nof Law. Such a thundering rapidity, after a ministerial dormancy of\r\nalmost eighteen months, can be attributed to no other cause than their\r\nhaving gained information of the forwardness of the cheap Edition, and\r\nthe dread they felt at the progressive increase of political knowledge.\r\n\r\nI was strongly advised by several gentlemen, as well those in the\r\npractice of the law, as others, to prefer a bill of indictment\r\nagainst the publisher of the Proclamation, as a publication tending to\r\ninfluence, or rather to dictate the verdict of a Jury on the issue of a\r\nmatter then pending; but it appeared to me much better to avail myself\r\nof the opportunity which such a precedent justified me in using, by\r\nmeeting the Proclamation and the Addressers on their own ground, and\r\npublicly defending the Work which had been thus unwarrantably attacked\r\nand traduced.--And conscious as I now am, that the Work entitled\r\nRights OF Man so far from being, as has been maliciously or erroneously\r\nrepresented, a false, wicked, and seditious libel, is a work abounding\r\nwith unanswerable truths, with principles of the purest morality and\r\nbenevolence, and with arguments not to be controverted--Conscious, I\r\nsay, of these things, and having no object in view but the happiness\r\nof mankind, I have now put the matter to the best proof in my power, by\r\ngiving to the public a cheap edition of the First and Second Parts of\r\nthat Work. Let every man read and judge for himself, not only of the\r\nmerits and demerits of the Work, but of the matters therein contained,\r\nwhich relate to his own interest and happiness.\r\n\r\nIf, to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy, and every species\r\nof hereditary government--to lessen the oppression of taxes--to propose\r\nplans for the education of helpless infancy, and the comfortable support\r\nof the aged and distressed--to endeavour to conciliate nations to each\r\nother--to extirpate the horrid practice of war--to promote universal\r\npeace, civilization, and commerce--and to break the chains of political\r\nsuperstition, and raise degraded man to his proper rank;--if these\r\nthings be libellous, let me live the life of a Libeller, and let the\r\nname of Libeller be engraved on my tomb.\r\n\r\nOf all the weak and ill-judged measures which fear, ignorance,\r\nor arrogance could suggest, the Proclamation, and the project for\r\nAddresses, are two of the worst. They served to advertise the work which\r\nthe promoters of those measures wished to keep unknown; and in doing\r\nthis they offered violence to the judgment of the people, by calling on\r\nthem to condemn what they forbad them to know, and put the strength\r\nof their party to that hazardous issue that prudence would have\r\navoided.--The County Meeting for Middlesex was attended by only\r\none hundred and eighteen Addressers. They, no doubt, expected, that\r\nthousands would flock to their standard, and clamor against the _Rights\r\nof Man_. But the case most probably is, that men in all countries, are\r\nnot so blind to their Rights and their Interest as Governments believe.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shewn the extraordinary manner in which the Government party\r\ncommenced their attack, I proceed to offer a few observations on the\r\nprosecution, and on the mode of trial by Special Jury.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I have written a book; and if it cannot be refuted,\r\nit cannot be condemned. But I do not consider the prosecution as\r\nparticularly levelled against me, but against the general right, or\r\nthe right of every man, of investigating systems and principles of\r\ngovernment, and shewing their several excellencies or defects. If the\r\npress be free only to flatter Government, as Mr. Burke has done, and to\r\ncry up and extol what certain Court sycophants are pleased to call a\r\n\"glorious Constitution,\" and not free to examine into its errors or\r\nabuses, or whether a Constitution really exist or not, such freedom is\r\nno other than that of Spain, Turkey, or Russia; and a Jury in this case,\r\nwould not be a Jury to try, but an Inquisition to condemn.\r\n\r\nI have asserted, and by fair and open argument maintained, the right\r\nof every nation at all times to establish such a system and form of\r\ngovernment for itself as best accords with its disposition, interest,\r\nand happiness; and to change and alter it as it sees occasion. Will any\r\nJury deny to the Nation this right? If they do, they are traitors, and\r\ntheir verdict would be null and void. And if they admit the right, the\r\nmeans must be admitted also; for it would be the highest absurdity to\r\nsay, that the right existed, but the means did not. The question then\r\nis, What are the means by which the possession and exercise of\r\nthis National Right are to be secured? The answer will be, that\r\nof maintaining, inviolably, the right of free investigation; for\r\ninvestigation always serves to detect error, and to bring forth truth.\r\n\r\nI have, as an individual, given my opinion upon what I believe to be\r\nnot only the best, but the true system of Government, which is the\r\nrepresentative system, and I have given reasons for that opinion.\r\n\r\nFirst, Because in the representative system, no office of very\r\nextraordinary power, or extravagant pay, is attached to any individual;\r\nand consequently there is nothing to excite those national contentions\r\nand civil wars with which countries under monarchical governments are\r\nfrequently convulsed, and of which the History of England exhibits such\r\nnumerous instances.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because the representative is a system of Government always\r\nin maturity; whereas monarchical government fluctuates through all the\r\nstages, from non-age to dotage.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Because the representative system admits of none but men\r\nproperly qualified into the Government, or removes them if they prove\r\nto be otherwise. Whereas, in the hereditary system, a nation may be\r\nencumbered with a knave or an ideot for a whole life-time, and not be\r\nbenefited by a successor.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Because there does not exist a right to establish hereditary\r\ngovernment, or, in other words, hereditary successors, because\r\nhereditary government always means a government yet to come, and the\r\ncase always is, that those who are to live afterwards have the same\r\nright to establish government for themselves, as the people had who\r\nlived before them; and, therefore, all laws attempting to establish\r\nhereditary government, are founded on assumption and political fiction.\r\n\r\nIf these positions be truths, and I challenge any man to prove the\r\ncontrary; if they tend to instruct and enlighten mankind, and to free\r\nthem from error, oppression, and political superstition, which are the\r\nobjects I have in view in publishing them, that Jury would commit an act\r\nof injustice to their country, and to me, if not an act of perjury, that\r\nshould call them _false, wicked, and malicious_.\r\n\r\nDragonetti, in his treatise \"On Virtues and Rewards,\" has a paragraph\r\nworthy of being recorded in every country in the world--\"The science\r\n(says he,) of the politician, consists, in, fixing the true point of\r\nhappiness and freedom. Those men deserve the gratitude of ages who\r\nshould discover a mode of government that contained the greatest sum of\r\n_individual happiness_ with the least _national expence_.\" But if Juries\r\nare to be made use of to prohibit enquiry, to suppress truth, and\r\nto stop the progress of knowledge, this boasted palladium of liberty\r\nbecomes the most successful instrument of tyranny.\r\n\r\nAmong the arts practised at the Bar, and from the Bench, to impose\r\nupon the understanding of a Jury, and to obtain a Verdict where\r\nthe consciences of men could not otherwise consent, one of the most\r\nsuccessful has been that of calling _truth a libel_, and of insinuating\r\nthat the words \"_falsely, wickedly, and maliciously_,\" though they\r\nare made the formidable and high sounding part of the charge, are not\r\nmatters of consideration with a Jury. For what purpose, then, are they\r\nretained, unless it be for that of imposition and wilful defamation?\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive a greater violation of order, nor a more abominable\r\ninsult upon morality, and upon human understanding, than to see a man\r\nsitting in the judgment seat, affecting by an antiquated foppery of\r\ndress to impress the audience with awe; then causing witnesses and Jury\r\nto be sworn to truth and justice, himself having officially sworn the\r\nsame; then causing to be read a prosecution against a man charging him\r\nwith having _wickedly and maliciously written and published a certain\r\nfalse, wicked, and seditious book_; and having gone through all this\r\nwith a shew of solemnity, as if he saw the eye of the Almighty darting\r\nthrough the roof of the building like a ray of light, turn, in an\r\ninstant, the whole into a farce, and, in order to obtain a verdict\r\nthat could not otherwise be obtained, tell the Jury that the charge of\r\n_falsely, wickedly, and seditiously_, meant nothing; that _truth_ was\r\nout of the question; and that whether the person accused spoke truth or\r\nfalsehood, or intended _virtuously or wickedly_, was the same thing;\r\nand finally conclude the wretched inquisitorial scene, by stating\r\nsome antiquated precedent, equally as abominable as that which is then\r\nacting, or giving some opinion of his own, and _falsely calling the one\r\nand the other--Law_. It was, most probably, to such a Judge as this,\r\nthat the most solemn of all reproofs was given--\"_The Lord will smite\r\nthee, thou whitened wall_.\"\r\n\r\nI now proceed to offer some remarks on what is called a Special Jury. As\r\nto what is called a Special Verdict, I shall make no other remark upon\r\nit, than that it is in reality _not_ a verdict. It is an attempt on the\r\npart of the Jury to delegate, or of the Bench to obtain, the exercise of\r\nthat right, which is committed to the Jury only.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Special Juries, I shall state such matters as I have\r\nbeen able to collect, for I do not find any uniform opinion concerning\r\nthe mode of appointing them.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this mode of trial is but of modern invention, and\r\nthe origin of it, as I am told, is as follows:\r\n\r\nFormerly, when disputes arose between Merchants, and were brought before\r\na Court, the case was that the nature of their commerce, and the method\r\nof keeping Merchants' accounts not being sufficiently understood by\r\npersons out of their own line, it became necessary to depart from the\r\ncommon mode of appointing Juries, and to select such persons for a Jury\r\nwhose _practical knowledge_ would enable them to decide upon the case.\r\nFrom this introduction, Special Juries became more general; but some\r\ndoubts having arisen as to their legality, an act was passed in the 3d\r\nof George II. to establish them as legal, and also to extend them to all\r\ncases, not only between individuals, but in cases where _the Government\r\nitself should be the prosecutor_. This most probably gave rise to the\r\nsuspicion so generally entertained of packing a Jury; because, by this\r\nact, when the Crown, as it is called, is the Prosecutor, the Master of\r\nthe Crown-office, who holds his office under the Crown, is the person\r\nwho either wholly nominates, or has great power in nominating the Jury,\r\nand therefore it has greatly the appearance of the prosecuting party\r\nselecting a Jury.\r\n\r\nThe process is as follows:\r\n\r\nOn motion being made in Court, by either the Plaintiff or Defendant, for\r\na Special Jury, the Court grants it or not, at its own discretion.\r\n\r\nIf it be granted, the Solicitor of the party that applied for the\r\nSpecial Jury, gives notice to the Solicitor of the adverse party, and a\r\nday and hour are appointed for them to meet at the office of the Master\r\nof the Crown-office. The Master of the Crown-office sends to the Sheriff\r\nor his deputy, who attends with the Sheriff's book of Freeholders. From\r\nthis book, forty-eight names are taken, and a copy thereof given to each\r\nof the parties; and, on a future day, notice is again given, and the\r\nSolicitors meet a second time, and each strikes out twelve names. The\r\nlist being thus reduced from forty-eight to twenty-four, the first\r\ntwelve that appear in Court, and answer to their names, is the Special\r\nJury for that cause. The first operation, that of taking the forty-eight\r\nnames, is called nominating the Jury; and the reducing them to\r\ntwenty-four is called striking the Jury.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the general process, I come to particulars, and the\r\nfirst question will be, how are the forty-eight names, out of which the\r\nJury is to be struck, obtained from the Sheriff's book? For herein lies\r\nthe principal ground of suspicion, with respect to what is understood by\r\npacking of Juries.\r\n\r\nEither they must be taken by some rule agreed upon between the parties,\r\nor by some common rule known and established beforehand, or at the\r\ndiscretion of some person, who in such a case, ought to be perfectly\r\ndisinterested in the issue, as well officially as otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Merchants, and in all cases between individuals,\r\nthe Master of the office, called the Crown-office, is officially an\r\nindifferent person, and as such may be a proper person to act between\r\nthe parties, and present them with a list of forty-eight names, out of\r\nwhich each party is to strike twelve. But the case assumes an entire\r\ndifference of character, when the Government itself is the Prosecutor.\r\nThe Master of the Crown-office is then an officer holding his office\r\nunder the Prosecutor; and it is therefore no wonder that the suspicion\r\nof packing Juries should, in such cases, have been so prevalent.\r\n\r\nThis will apply with additional force, when the prosecution is commenced\r\nagainst the Author or Publisher of such Works as treat of reforms, and\r\nof the abolition of superfluous places and offices, &c, because in such\r\ncases every person holding an office, subject to that suspicion, becomes\r\ninterested as a party; and the office, called the Crown-office, may,\r\nupon examination, be found to be of this description.\r\n\r\nI have heard it asserted, that the Master of the Crown-office is to open\r\nthe sheriff's book as it were per hazard, and take thereout forty-eight\r\n_following_ names, to which the word Merchant or Esquire is affixed.\r\nThe former of these are certainly proper, when the case is between\r\nMerchants, and it has reference to the origin of the custom, and to\r\nnothing else. As to the word Esquire, every man is an Esquire who\r\npleases to call himself Esquire; and the sensible part of mankind are\r\nleaving it off. But the matter for enquiry is, whether there be any\r\nexisting law to direct the mode by which the forty-eight names shall be\r\ntaken, or whether the mode be merely that of custom which the office has\r\ncreated; or whether the selection of the forty-eight names be wholly\r\nat the discretion and choice of the Master of the Crown-office? One or\r\nother of the two latter appears to be the case, because the act already\r\nmentioned, of the 3d of George II. lays down no rule or mode, nor refers\r\nto any preceding law--but says only, that Special Juries shall hereafter\r\nbe struck, \"_in such manner as Special Juries have been and are usually\r\nstruck_.\"\r\n\r\nThis act appears to have been what is generally understood by a \"_deep\r\ntake in_.\" It was fitted to the spur of the moment in which it was\r\npassed, 3d of George II. when parties ran high, and it served to throw\r\ninto the hands of Walpole, who was then Minister, the management of\r\nJuries in Crown prosecutions, by making the nomination of the\r\nforty-eight persons, from whom the Jury was to be struck, follow the\r\nprecedent established by custom between individuals, and by this means\r\nslipt into practice with less suspicion. Now, the manner of obtaining\r\nSpecial Juries through the medium of an officer of the Government, such,\r\nfor instance, as a Master of the Crown-office, may be impartial in the\r\ncase of Merchants or other individuals, but it becomes highly improper\r\nand suspicious in cases where the Government itself is one of the\r\nparties. And it must, upon the whole, appear a strange inconsistency,\r\nthat a Government should keep one officer to commence prosecutions, and\r\nanother officer to nominate the forty-eight persons from whom the Jury\r\nis to be struck, both of whom are _officers of the Civil List_, and yet\r\ncontinue to call this by the pompous name of _the glorious \"Right of\r\ntrial by Jury!_\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of the King against Jordan, for publishing the Rights of\r\nMan, the Attorney-General moved for the appointment of a Special Jury,\r\nand the Master of the Crown-office nominated the forty-eight persons\r\nhimself, and took them from such part of the Sheriff's book as he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nThe trial did not come on, occasioned by Jordan withdrawing his plea;\r\nbut if it had, it might have afforded an opportunity of discussing the\r\nsubject of Special Juries; for though such discussion might have had\r\nno effect in the Court of King's Bench, it would, in the present\r\ndisposition for enquiry, have had a considerable effect upon the\r\nCountry; and, in all national reforms, this is the proper point to begin\r\nat. But a Country right, and it will soon put Government right. Among\r\nthe improper things acted by the Government in the case of Special\r\nJuries, on their own motion, one has been that of treating the Jury with\r\na dinner, and afterwards giving each Juryman two guineas, if a verdict\r\nbe found for the prosecution, and only one if otherwise; and it has been\r\nlong observed, that, in London and Westminster, there are persons who\r\nappear to make a trade of serving, by being so frequently seen upon\r\nSpecial Juries.\r\n\r\nThus much for Special Juries. As to what is called a _Common Jury_, upon\r\nany Government prosecution against the Author or Publisher of RIGHTS OF\r\nMan, during the time of the _present Sheriffry_, I have one question\r\nto offer, which is, _whether the present Sheriffs of London, having\r\npublicly prejudged the case, by the part they have taken in procuring\r\nan Address from the county of Middlesex, (however diminutive and\r\ninsignificant the number of Addressers were, being only one hundred and\r\neighteen,) are eligible or proper persons to be intrusted with the power\r\nof returning a Jury to try the issue of any such prosecution_.\r\n\r\nBut the whole matter appears, at least to me, to be worthy of a more\r\nextensive consideration than what relates to any Jury, whether Special\r\nor Common; for the case is, whether any part of a whole nation, locally\r\nselected as a Jury of twelve men always is, be competent to judge and\r\ndetermine for the whole nation, on any matter that relates to systems\r\nand principles of Government, and whether it be not applying the\r\ninstitution of Juries to purposes for which such institutions were not\r\nintended? For example,\r\n\r\nI have asserted, in the Work Rights of Man, that as every man in the\r\nnation pays taxes, so has every man a right to a share in government,\r\nand consequently that the people of Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield,\r\nLeeds, Halifax, &c have the same right as those of London. Shall, then,\r\ntwelve men, picked out between Temple-bar and Whitechapel, because the\r\nbook happened to be first published there, decide upon the rights of\r\nthe inhabitants of those towns, or of any other town or village in the\r\nnation?\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken of Juries, I come next to offer a few observations on\r\nthe matter contained in the information or prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe work, Rights of Man, consists of Part the First, and Fart the\r\nSecond. The First Part the prosecutor has thought it most proper to let\r\nalone; and from the Second Fart he has selected a few short paragraphs,\r\nmaking in the whole not quite two pages of the same printing as in the\r\ncheap edition. Those paragraphs relate chiefly to certain facts, such\r\nas the revolution of 1688, and the coming of George the First, commonly\r\ncalled of the House of Hanover, or the House of Brunswick, or some such\r\nHouse. The arguments, plans and principles contained in the work, the\r\nprosecutor has not ventured to attack. They are beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nThe Act which the prosecutor appears to rest most upon for the support\r\nof the prosecution, is the Act intituled, \"An Act, declaring the rights\r\nand liberties of the subject, and settling the succession of the crown,\"\r\npassed in the first year of William and Mary, and more commonly known by\r\nthe name of the \"Bill of Rights.\"\r\n\r\nI have called this bill \"_A Bill of wrongs and of insult_.\" My reasons,\r\nand also my proofs, are as follow:\r\n\r\nThe method and principle which this Bill takes for declaring rights and\r\nliberties, are in direct contradiction to rights and liberties; it is an\r\nassumed attempt to take them wholly from posterity--for the declaration\r\nin the said Bill is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, do, in _the name of all\r\nthe people_, most humbly and faithfully _submit themselves, their heirs,\r\nand posterity for ever_;\" that is, to William and Mary his wife, their\r\nheirs and successors. This is a strange way of declaring rights and\r\nliberties. But the Parliament who made this declaration in the name, and\r\non the part, of the people, had no authority from them for so doing;\r\nand with respect to _posterity for ever_, they had no right or authority\r\nwhatever in the case. It was assumption and usurpation. I have reasoned\r\nvery extensively against the principle of this Bill, in the first part\r\nof Rights of Man; the prosecutor has silently admitted that reasoning,\r\nand he now commences a prosecution on the authority of the Bill, after\r\nadmitting the reasoning against it.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed, that the declaration in this Bill, abject and\r\nirrational as it is, had no other intentional operation than against the\r\nfamily of the Stuarts, and their abettors. The idea did not then exist,\r\nthat in the space of an hundred years, posterity might discover a\r\ndifferent and much better system of government, and that every species\r\nof hereditary government might fall, as Popes and Monks had fallen\r\nbefore. This, I say, was not then thought of, and therefore the\r\napplication of the Bill, in the present case, is a new, erroneous, and\r\nillegal application, and is the same as creating a new Bill _ex post\r\nfacto_.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been the craft of Courtiers, for the purpose of keeping\r\nup an expensive and enormous Civil List, and a mummery of useless and\r\nantiquated places and offices at the public expence, to be continually\r\nhanging England upon some individual or other, called _King_, though\r\nthe man might not have capacity to be a parish constable. The folly and\r\nabsurdity of this, is appearing more and more every day; and still those\r\nmen continue to act as if no alteration in the public opinion had taken\r\nplace. They hear each other's nonsense, and suppose the whole nation\r\ntalks the same Gibberish.\r\n\r\nLet such men cry up the House of Orange, or the House of Brunswick,\r\nif they please. They would cry up any other house if it suited their\r\npurpose, and give as good reasons for it. But what is this house, or\r\nthat house, or any other house to a nation? \"_For a nation to be free,\r\nit is sufficient that she wills it_.\" Her freedom depends wholly upon\r\nherself, and not on any house, nor on any individual. I ask not in what\r\nlight this cargo of foreign houses appears to others, but I will say in\r\nwhat light it appears to me--It was like the trees of the forest, saying\r\nunto the bramble, come thou and reign over us.\r\n\r\nThus much for both their houses. I now come to speak of two other\r\nhouses, which are also put into the information, and those are the\r\nHouse of Lords, and the House of Commons. Here, I suppose, the\r\nAttorney-General intends to prove me guilty of speaking either truth\r\nor falsehood; for, according to the modern interpretation of Libels, it\r\ndoes not signify which, and the only improvement necessary to shew the\r\ncompleat absurdity of such doctrine, would be, to prosecute a man for\r\nuttering a most _false and wicked truth_.\r\n\r\nI will quote the part I am going to give, from the Office Copy, with the\r\nAttorney General's inuendoes, enclosed in parentheses as they stand in\r\nthe information, and I hope that civil list officer will caution the\r\nCourt not to laugh when he reads them, and also to take care not to\r\nlaugh himself.\r\n\r\nThe information states, that _Thomas Paine, being a wicked, malicious,\r\nseditious, and evil-disposed person, hath, with force and arms, and\r\nmost wicked cunning, written and published a certain false, scandalous,\r\nmalicious, and seditious libel; in one part thereof, to the tenor and\r\neffect following, that is to say_--\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the two Houses, of which the English Parliament\r\n(_meaning the Parliament of this Kingdom_) is composed, they appear to\r\nbe effectually influenced into one, and, as a Legislature, to have no\r\ntemper of its own. The Minister, (_meaning the Minuter employed by the\r\nKing of this Realm, in the administration of the Government thereof_)\r\nwhoever he at any time may be, touches it (_meaning the two Houses of\r\nParliament of this Kingdom_) as with an opium wand, and it (_meaning the\r\ntwo Houses of Parliament of this Kingdom_) sleeps obedience.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am not malicious enough to disturb their repose, though it be time\r\nthey should awake, I leave the two Houses and the Attorney General, to\r\nthe enjoyment of their dreams, and proceed to a new subject.\r\n\r\nThe Gentlemen, to whom I shall next address myself, are those who have\r\nstiled themselves \"_Friends of the people_,\" holding their meeting at\r\nthe Freemasons' Tavern, London.(1)\r\n\r\nOne of the principal Members of this Society, is Mr. Grey, who, I\r\nbelieve, is also one of the most independent Members in Parliament.(2)\r\nI collect this opinion from what Mr. Burke formerly mentioned to me,\r\nrather than from any knowledge of my own. The occasion was as follows:\r\n\r\nI was in England at the time the bubble broke forth about Nootka Sound:\r\nand the day after the King's Message, as it is called, was sent to\r\nParliament, I wrote a note to Mr. Burke, that upon the condition the\r\nFrench Revolution should not be a subject (for he was then writing\r\nthe book I have since answered) I would call on him the next day, and\r\nmention some matters I was acquainted with, respecting the affair; for\r\nit appeared to me extraordinary that any body of men, calling themselves\r\nRepresentatives, should commit themselves so precipitately, or \"sleep\r\nobedience,\" as Parliament was then doing, and run a nation into expence,\r\nand perhaps a war, without so much as enquiring into the case, or the\r\nsubject, of both which I had some knowledge.\r\n\r\n     1 See in the Introduction to this volume Chauvelin's account\r\n     of this Association.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2  In the debate in the House of Commons, Dec. 14, 1793, Mr.\r\n     Grey is thus reported: \"Mr. Grey was not a friend to\r\n     Paine's doctrines, but he was not to be deterred by a man\r\n     from acknowledging that he considered the rights of man as\r\n     the foundation of every government, and those who stood out\r\n     against those rights as conspirators against the people.\" He\r\n     severely denounced the Proclamation.   Parl. Hist., vol.\r\n     xxvi.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Mr. Burke, and mentioned the circumstances to him, he\r\nparticularly spoke of Mr. Grey, as the fittest Member to bring such\r\nmatters forward; \"for,\" said Mr. Burke, \"_I am not the proper_ person to\r\ndo it, as I am in a treaty with Mr. Pitt about Mr. Hastings's trial.\" I\r\nhope the Attorney General will allow, that Mr. Burke was then _sleeping\r\nhis obedience_.--But to return to the Society------\r\n\r\nI cannot bring myself to believe, that the general motive of this\r\nSociety is any thing more than that by which every former parliamentary\r\nopposition has been governed, and by which the present is sufficiently\r\nknown. Failing in their pursuit of power and place within doors, they\r\nhave now (and that in not a very mannerly manner) endeavoured to possess\r\nthemselves of that ground out of doors, which, had it not been made\r\nby others, would not have been made by them. They appear to me to have\r\nwatched, with more cunning than candour, the progress of a certain\r\npublication, and when they saw it had excited a spirit of enquiry,\r\nand was rapidly spreading, they stepped forward to profit by the\r\nopportunity, and Mr. Fox _then_ called it a Libel. In saying this, he\r\nlibelled himself. Politicians of this cast, such, I mean, as those who\r\ntrim between parties, and lye by for events, are to be found in every\r\ncountry, and it never yet happened that they did not do more harm\r\nthan good. They embarrass business, fritter it to nothing, perplex the\r\npeople, and the event to themselves generally is, that they go just\r\nfar enough to make enemies of the few, without going far enough to make\r\nfriends of the many.\r\n\r\nWhoever will read the declarations of this Society, of the 25th of April\r\nand 5th of May, will find a studied reserve upon all the points that are\r\nreal abuses. They speak not once of the extravagance of Government, of\r\nthe abominable list of unnecessary and sinecure places and pensions, of\r\nthe enormity of the Civil List, of the excess of taxes, nor of any one\r\nmatter that substantially affects the nation; and from some conversation\r\nthat has passed in that Society, it does not appear to me that it is\r\nany part of their plan to carry this class of reforms into practice. No\r\nOpposition Party ever did, when it gained possession.\r\n\r\nIn making these free observations, I mean not to enter into contention\r\nwith this Society; their incivility towards me is what I should expect\r\nfrom place-hunting reformers. They are welcome, however, to the ground\r\nthey have advanced upon, and I wish that every individual among them may\r\nact in the same upright, uninfluenced, and public spirited manner that I\r\nhave done. Whatever reforms may be obtained, and by whatever means,\r\nthey will be for the benefit of others and not of me. I have no other\r\ninterest in the cause than the interest of my heart. The part I have\r\nacted has been wholly that of a volunteer, unconnected with party; and\r\nwhen I quit, it shall be as honourably as I began.\r\n\r\nI consider the reform of Parliament, by an application to Parliament, as\r\nproposed by the Society, to be a worn-out hackneyed subject, about which\r\nthe nation is tired, and the parties are deceiving each other. It is not\r\na subject that is cognizable before Parliament, because no Government\r\nhas a right to alter itself, either in whole or in part. The right,\r\nand the exercise of that right, appertains to the nation only, and the\r\nproper means is by a national convention, elected for the purpose, by\r\nall the people. By this, the will of the nation, whether to reform or\r\nnot, or what the reform shall be, or how far it shall extend, will be\r\nknown, and it cannot be known by any other means. Partial addresses, or\r\nseparate associations, are not testimonies of the general will.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, certain, that the opinions of men, with respect\r\nto systems and principles of government, are changing fast in all\r\ncountries. The alteration in England, within the space of a little more\r\nthan a year, is far greater than could have been believed, and it is\r\ndaily and hourly increasing. It moves along the country with the silence\r\nof thought. The enormous expence of Government has provoked men to\r\nthink, by making them feel; and the Proclamation has served to increase\r\njealousy and disgust. To prevent, therefore, those commotions which too\r\noften and too suddenly arise from suffocated discontents, it is best\r\nthat the general WILL should have the full and free opportunity of being\r\npublicly ascertained and known.\r\n\r\nWretched as the state of representation is in England, it is every\r\nday becoming worse, because the unrepresented parts of the nation are\r\nincreasing in population and property, and the represented parts are\r\ndecreasing. It is, therefore, no ill-grounded estimation to say, that\r\nas not one person in seven is represented, at least fourteen millions of\r\ntaxes out of the seventeen millions, are paid by the unrepresented part;\r\nfor although copyholds and leaseholds are assessed to the land-tax, the\r\nholders are unrepresented. Should then a general demur take place as to\r\nthe obligation of paying taxes, on the ground of not being represented,\r\nit is not the Representatives of Rotten Boroughs, nor Special Juries,\r\nthat can decide the question. This is one of the possible cases that\r\nought to be foreseen, in order to prevent the inconveniencies that might\r\narise to numerous individuals, by provoking it.\r\n\r\nI confess I have no idea of petitioning for rights. Whatever the rights\r\nof people are, they have a right to them, and none have a right either\r\nto withhold them, or to grant them. Government ought to be established\r\non such principles of justice as to exclude the occasion of all such\r\napplications, for wherever they appear they are virtually accusations.\r\n\r\nI wish that Mr. Grey, since he has embarked in the business, would take\r\nthe whole of it into consideration. He will then see that the right of\r\nreforming the state of the Representation does not reside in Parliament,\r\nand that the only motion he could consistently make would be, that\r\nParliament should _recommend_ the election of a convention of the\r\npeople, because all pay taxes. But whether Parliament recommended it\r\nor not, the right of the nation would neither be lessened nor increased\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nAs to Petitions from the unrepresented part, they ought not to be looked\r\nfor. As well might it be expected that Manchester, Sheffield, &c.\r\nshould petition the rotten Boroughs, as that they should petition the\r\nRepresentatives of those Boroughs. Those two towns alone pay far more\r\ntaxes than all the rotten Boroughs put together, and it is scarcely to\r\nbe expected they should pay their court either to the Boroughs, or the\r\nBorough-mongers.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be observed, that what is called Parliament, is\r\ncomposed of two houses that have always declared against the right of\r\neach other to interfere in any matter that related to the circumstances\r\nof either, particularly that of election. A reform, therefore, in the\r\nrepresentation cannot, on the ground they have individually taken,\r\nbecome the subject of an act of Parliament, because such a mode would\r\ninclude the interference, against which the Commons on their part have\r\nprotested; but must, as well on the ground of formality, as on that of\r\nright, proceed from a National Convention.\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Grey, or any other man, sit down and endeavour to put his\r\nthoughts together, for the purpose of drawing up an application to\r\nParliament for a reform of Parliament, and he will soon convince himself\r\nof the folly of the attempt. He will find that he cannot get on; that\r\nhe cannot make his thoughts join, so as to produce any effect; for,\r\nwhatever formality of words he may use, they will unavoidably include\r\ntwo ideas directly opposed to each other; the one in setting forth\r\nthe reasons, the other in praying for relief, and the two, when placed\r\ntogether, would stand thus: \"_The Representation in Parliament is so\r\nvery corrupt, that we can no longer confide in it,--and, therefore,\r\nconfiding in the justice and wisdom of Parliament, we pray_,\" &c, &c.\r\n\r\nThe heavy manner in which every former proposed application to\r\nParliament has dragged, sufficiently shews, that though the nation might\r\nnot exactly see the awkwardness of the measure, it could not clearly see\r\nits way, by those means. To this also may be added another remark, which\r\nis, that the worse Parliament is, the less will be the inclination to\r\npetition it. This indifference, viewed as it ought to be, is one of the\r\nstrongest censures the public express. It is as if they were to say to\r\nthem, \"Ye are not worth reforming.\"\r\n\r\nLet any man examine the Court-Kalendar of Placemen in both Houses, and\r\nthe manner in which the Civil List operates, and he will be at no loss\r\nto account for this indifference and want of confidence on one side, nor\r\nof the opposition to reforms on the other.\r\n\r\nWho would have supposed that Mr. Burke, holding forth as he formerly\r\ndid against secret influence, and corrupt majorities, should become\r\na concealed Pensioner? I will now state the case, not for the little\r\npurpose of exposing Mr. Burke, but to shew the inconsistency of any\r\napplication to a body of men, more than half of whom, as far as the\r\nnation can at present know, may be in the same case with himself.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of Lord North's administration, Mr. Burke brought a bill\r\ninto Parliament, generally known by Mr. Burke's Reform Bill; in which,\r\namong other things, it is enacted, \"That no pension exceeding the sum\r\nof three hundred pounds a year, shall be granted to any one person,\r\nand that the whole amount of the pensions granted in one year shall not\r\nexceed six hundred pounds; a list of which, together with the _names\r\nof the persons_ to whom the same are granted, shall be laid before\r\nParliament in twenty days after the beginning of each session, until\r\nthe whole pension list shall be reduced to ninety thousand pounds.\" A\r\nprovisory clause is afterwards added, \"That it shall be lawful for the\r\nFirst Commissioner of the Treasury, to return into the Exchequer any\r\npension or annuity, _without a name_, on his making oath that such\r\npension or annuity is not directly or indirectly for the benefit, use,\r\nor behoof of any Member of the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\nBut soon after that administration ended, and the party Mr. Burke acted\r\nwith came into power, it appears from the circumstances I am going to\r\nrelate, that Mr. Burke became himself a Pensioner in disguise; in a\r\nsimilar manner as if a pension had been granted in the name of John\r\nNokes, to be privately paid to and enjoyed by Tom Stiles. The name of\r\nEdmund Burke does not appear in the original transaction: but after the\r\npension was obtained, Mr. Burke wanted to make the most of it at once,\r\nby selling or mortgaging it; and the gentleman in whose name the pension\r\nstands, applied to one of the public offices for that purpose. This\r\nunfortunately brought forth the name of _Edmund Burke_, as the real\r\nPensioner of 1,500L. per annum.(1) When men trumpet forth what they call\r\nthe blessings of the Constitution, it ought to be known what sort of\r\nblessings they allude to.\r\n\r\nAs to the Civil List of a million a year, it is not to be supposed that\r\nany one man can eat, drink, or consume the whole upon himself. The case\r\nis, that above half the sum is annually apportioned among Courtiers,\r\nand Court Members, of both Houses, in places and offices, altogether\r\ninsignificant and perfectly useless as to every purpose of civil,\r\nrational, and manly government. For instance,\r\n\r\nOf what use in the science and system of Government is what is called\r\na Lord Chamberlain, a Master and Mistress of the Robes, a Master of the\r\nHorse, a Master of the Hawks, and one hundred other such things? Laws\r\nderive no additional force, nor additional excellence from such mummery.\r\n\r\nIn the disbursements of the Civil List for the year 1786, (which may be\r\nseen in Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue,) are four separate\r\ncharges for this mummery office of Chamberlain:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table110]\r\n\r\nFrom this sample the rest may be guessed at. As to the Master of the\r\nHawks, (there are no hawks kept, and if there were, it is no reason the\r\npeople should pay the expence of feeding them, many of whom are put to\r\nit to get bread for their children,) his salary is 1,372L. 10s.\r\n\r\n     1 See note at the end of this chapter.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAnd besides a list of items of this kind, sufficient to fill a quire of\r\npaper, the Pension lists alone are 107,404L. 13s. 4d. which is a greater\r\nsum than all the expences of the federal Government in America amount\r\nto.\r\n\r\nAmong the items, there are two I had no expectation of finding, and\r\nwhich, in this day of enquiry after Civil List influence, ought to be\r\nexposed. The one is an annual payment of one thousand seven hundred\r\npounds to the Dissenting Ministers in England, and the other, eight\r\nhundred pounds to those of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis is the fact; and the distribution, as I am informed, is as follows:\r\nThe whole sum of 1,700L. is paid to one person, a Dissenting Minister\r\nin London, who divides it among eight others, and those eight among such\r\nothers as they please. The Lay-body of the Dissenters, and many of their\r\nprincipal Ministers, have long considered it as dishonourable, and have\r\nendeavoured to prevent it, but still it continues to be secretly paid;\r\nand as the world has sometimes seen very fulsome Addresses from parts of\r\nthat body, it may naturally be supposed that the receivers, like Bishops\r\nand other Court-Clergy, are not idle in promoting them. How the money is\r\ndistributed in Ireland, I know not.\r\n\r\nTo recount all the secret history of the Civil List, is not the\r\nintention of this publication. It is sufficient, in this place, to\r\nexpose its general character, and the mass of influence it keeps alive.\r\nIt will necessarily become one of the objects of reform; and therefore\r\nenough is said to shew that, under its operation, no application to\r\nParliament can be expected to succeed, nor can consistently be made.\r\n\r\nSuch reforms will not be promoted by the Party that is in possession of\r\nthose places, nor by the Opposition who are waiting for them; and as\r\nto a _mere reform_, in the state of the Representation, the idea that\r\nanother Parliament, differently elected from the present, but still a\r\nthird component part of the same system, and subject to the controul of\r\nthe other two parts, will abolish those abuses, is altogether delusion;\r\nbecause it is not only impracticable on the ground of formality, but is\r\nunwisely exposing another set of men to the same corruptions that have\r\ntainted the present.\r\n\r\nWere all the objects that require reform accomplishable by a mere reform\r\nin the state of the Representation, the persons who compose the present\r\nParliament might, with rather more propriety, be asked to abolish all\r\nthe abuses themselves, than be applied to as the more instruments of\r\ndoing it by a future Parliament. If the virtue be wanting to abolish the\r\nabuse, it is also wanting to act as the means, and the nation must, from\r\nnecessity, proceed by some other plan.\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to shew what the abject condition of Parliament\r\nis, and the impropriety of going a second time over the same ground that\r\nhas before miscarried, I come to the remaining part of the subject.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be, in the constitution of every country, a mode of\r\nreferring back, on any extraordinary occasion, to the sovereign and\r\noriginal constituent power, which is the nation itself. The right of\r\naltering any part of a Government, cannot, as already observed, reside\r\nin the Government, or that Government might make itself what it pleased.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be taken for granted, that though a nation may feel\r\ninconveniences, either in the excess of taxation, or in the mode of\r\nexpenditure, or in any thing else, it may not at first be sufficiently\r\nassured in what part of its government the defect lies, or where the\r\nevil originates. It may be supposed to be in one part, and on enquiry\r\nbe found to be in another; or partly in all. This obscurity is naturally\r\ninterwoven with what are called mixed Governments.\r\n\r\nBe, however, the reform to be accomplished whatever it may, it can only\r\nfollow in consequence of obtaining a full knowledge of all the causes\r\nthat have rendered such reform necessary, and every thing short of this\r\nis guess-work or frivolous cunning. In this case, it cannot be supposed\r\nthat any application to Parliament can bring forward this knowledge.\r\nThat body is itself the supposed cause, or one of the supposed causes,\r\nof the abuses in question; and cannot be expected, and ought not to be\r\nasked, to give evidence against itself. The enquiry, therefore, which\r\nis of necessity the first step in the business, cannot be trusted to\r\nParliament, but must be undertaken by a distinct body of men, separated\r\nfrom every suspicion of corruption or influence.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of referring to rotten Boroughs and absurd Corporations\r\nfor Addresses, or hawking them about the country to be signed by a few\r\ndependant tenants, the real and effectual mode would be to come at once\r\nto the point, and to ascertain the sense of the nation by electing a\r\nNational Convention. By this method, as already observed, the general\r\nWILL, whether to reform or not, or what the reform shall be, or how\r\nfar it shall extend, will be known, and it cannot be known by any other\r\nmeans. Such a body, empowered and supported by the nation, will have\r\nauthority to demand information upon all matters necessary to be\r\nen-quired into; and no Minister, nor any person, will dare to refuse it.\r\nIt will then be seen whether seventeen millions of taxes are necessary,\r\nand for what purposes they are expended. The concealed Pensioners will\r\nthen be obliged to unmask; and the source of influence and corruption,\r\nif any such there be, will be laid open to the nation, not for the\r\npurpose of revenge, but of redress.\r\n\r\nBy taking this public and national ground, all objections against\r\npartial Addresses on the one side, or private associations on the other,\r\nwill be done away; THE NATION WILL DECLARE ITS OWN REFORMS; and the\r\nclamour about Party and Faction, or Ins or Outs, will become ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe plan and organization of a convention is easy in practice.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the number of inhabitants in every county can be\r\nsufficiently ascertained from the number of houses assessed to the\r\nHouse and Window-light tax in each county. This will give the rule\r\nfor apportioning the number of Members to be elected to the National\r\nConvention in each of the counties.\r\n\r\nIf the total number of inhabitants in England be seven millions, and the\r\ntotal number of Members to be elected to the Convention be one thousand,\r\nthe number of members to be elected in a county containing one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand inhabitants will be _twenty-one_, and in like\r\nproportion for any other county.\r\n\r\nAs the election of a Convention must, in order to ascertain the general\r\nsense of the nation, go on grounds different from that of Parliamentary\r\nelections, the mode that best promises this end will have no\r\ndifficulties to combat with from absurd customs and pretended rights.\r\nThe right of every man will be the same, whether he lives in a city,\r\na town, or a village. The custom of attaching Rights to _place_, or\r\nin other words, to inanimate matter, instead of to the _person_,\r\nindependently of place, is too absurd to make any part of a rational\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nAs every man in the nation, of the age of twenty-one years, pays taxes,\r\neither out of the property he possesses, or out of the product of his\r\nlabor, which is property to him; and is amenable in his own person to\r\nevery law of the land; so has every one the same equal right to vote,\r\nand no one part of the nation, nor any individual, has a right to\r\ndispute the right of another. The man who should do this ought to\r\nforfeit the exercise of his _own_ right, for a term of years. This would\r\nrender the punishment consistent with the crime.\r\n\r\nWhen a qualification to vote is regulated by years, it is placed on the\r\nfirmest possible ground; because the qualification is such, as nothing\r\nbut dying before the time can take away; and the equality of Rights, as\r\na principle, is recognized in the act of regulating the exercise. But\r\nwhen Rights are placed upon, or made dependant upon property, they are\r\non the most precarious of all tenures. \"Riches make themselves wings,\r\nand fly away,\" and the rights fly with them; and thus they become lost\r\nto the man when they would be of most value.\r\n\r\nIt is from a strange mixture of tyranny and cowardice, that exclusions\r\nhave been set up and continued. The boldness to do wrong at first,\r\nchanges afterwards into cowardly craft, and at last into fear. The\r\nRepresentatives in England appear now to act as if they were afraid to\r\ndo right, even in part, lest it should awaken the nation to a sense of\r\nall the wrongs it has endured. This case serves to shew, that the same\r\nconduct that best constitutes the safety of an individual, namely,\r\na strict adherence to principle, constitutes also the safety of a\r\nGovernment, and that without it safety is but an empty name. When the\r\nrich plunder the poor of his rights, it becomes an example to the poor\r\nto plunder the rich of his property; for the rights of the one are\r\nas much property to him, as wealth is property to the other, and the\r\n_little all_ is as dear as the _much_. It is only by setting out on just\r\nprinciples that men are trained to be just to each other; and it will\r\nalways be found, that when the rich protect the rights of the poor, the\r\npoor will protect the property of the rich. But the guarantee, to be\r\neffectual, must be parliamentarily reciprocal.\r\n\r\nExclusions are not only unjust, but they frequently operate as\r\ninjuriously to the party who monopolizes, as to those who are excluded.\r\nWhen men seek to exclude others from participating in the exercise of\r\nany right, they should, at least, be assured, that they can effectually\r\nperform the whole of the business they undertake; for, unless they do\r\nthis, themselves will be losers by the monopoly. This has been the case\r\nwith respect to the monopolized right of Election. The monopolizing\r\nparty has not been able to keep the Parliamentary Representation, to\r\nwhom the power of taxation was entrusted, in the state it ought to have\r\nbeen, and have thereby multiplied taxes upon themselves equally with\r\nthose who were excluded.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been, and will continue to be said, about\r\ndisqualifications, arising from the commission of offences; but were\r\nthis subject urged to its full extent, it would disqualify a great\r\nnumber of the present Electors, together with their Representatives;\r\nfor, of all offences, none are more destructive to the morals of Society\r\nthan Bribery and Corruption. It is, therefore, civility to such persons\r\nto pass this subject over, and to give them a fair opportunity of\r\nrecovering, or rather of creating character.\r\n\r\nEvery thing, in the present mode of electioneering in England, is the\r\nreverse of what it ought to be, and the vulgarity that attends elections\r\nis no other than the natural consequence of inverting the order of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Candidate seeks the Elector, instead of the\r\nElector seeking for a Representative; and the Electors are advertised as\r\nbeing in the interest of the Candidate, instead of the Candidate being\r\nin the interest of the Electors. The Candidate pays the Elector for his\r\nvote, instead of the Nation paying the Representative for his time and\r\nattendance on public business. The complaint for an undue election is\r\nbrought by the Candidate, as if he, and not the Electors, were the party\r\naggrieved; and he takes on himself, at any period of the election, to\r\nbreak it up, by declining, as if the election was in his right and not\r\nin theirs.\r\n\r\nThe compact that was entered into at the last Westminster election\r\nbetween two of the candidates (Mr. Fox and Lord Hood,) was an indecent\r\nviolation of the principles of election. The Candidates assumed, in\r\ntheir own persons, the rights of the Electors; for, it was only in the\r\nbody of the Electors, and not at all in the Candidates, that the\r\nright of making any such compact, or compromise, could exist. But the\r\nprinciple of Election and Representation is so completely done away,\r\nin every stage thereof, that inconsistency has no longer the power of\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nNeither from elections thus conducted, nor from rotten Borough\r\nAddressers, nor from County-meetings, promoted by Placemen and\r\nPensioners, can the sense of the nation be known. It is still corruption\r\nappealing to itself. But a Convention of a thousand persons, fairly\r\nelected, would bring every matter to a decided issue.\r\n\r\nAs to County-meetings, it is only persons of leisure, or those who live\r\nnear to the place of meeting, that can attend, and the number on such\r\noccasions is but like a drop in the bucket compared with the whole. The\r\nonly consistent service which such meetings could render, would be that\r\nof apportioning the county into convenient districts, and when this is\r\ndone, each district might, according to its number of inhabitants, elect\r\nits quota of County Members to the National Convention; and the vote of\r\neach Elector might be taken in the parish where he resided, either by\r\nballot or by voice, as he should chuse to give it.\r\n\r\nA National Convention thus formed, would bring together the sense and\r\nopinions of every part of the nation, fairly taken. The science of\r\nGovernment, and the interest of the Public, and of the several parts\r\nthereof, would then undergo an ample and rational discussion, freed from\r\nthe language of parliamentary disguise.\r\n\r\nBut in all deliberations of this kind, though men have a right to\r\nreason with, and endeavour to convince each other, upon any matter that\r\nrespects their common good, yet, in point of practice, the majority of\r\nopinions, when known, forms a rule for the whole, and to this rule every\r\ngood citizen practically conforms.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, as if he knew, (for every concealed Pensioner has the\r\nopportunity of knowing,) that the abuses acted under the present system,\r\nare too flagrant to be palliated, and that the majority of opinions,\r\nwhenever such abuses should be made public, would be for a general and\r\neffectual reform, has endeavoured to preclude the event, by sturdily\r\ndenying the right of a majority of a nation to act as a whole. Let us\r\nbestow a thought upon this case.\r\n\r\nWhen any matter is proposed as a subject for consultation, it\r\nnecessarily implies some mode of decision. Common consent, arising from\r\nabsolute necessity, has placed this in a majority of opinions; because,\r\nwithout it, there can be no decision, and consequently no order. It is,\r\nperhaps, the only case in which mankind, however various in their ideas\r\nupon other matters, can consistently be unanimous; because it is a mode\r\nof decision derived from the primary original right of every individual\r\nconcerned; _that_ right being first individually exercised in giving an\r\nopinion, and whether that opinion shall arrange with the minority or the\r\nmajority, is a subsequent accidental thing that neither increases nor\r\ndiminishes the individual original right itself. Prior to any debate,\r\nenquiry, or investigation, it is not supposed to be known on which side\r\nthe majority of opinions will fall, and therefore, whilst this mode of\r\ndecision secures to every one the right of giving an opinion, it admits\r\nto every one an equal chance in the ultimate event.\r\n\r\nAmong the matters that will present themselves to the consideration of\r\na national convention, there is one, wholly of a domestic nature, but so\r\nmarvellously loaded with con-fusion, as to appear at first sight, almost\r\nimpossible to be reformed. I mean the condition of what is called Law.\r\n\r\nBut, if we examine into the cause from whence this confusion, now so\r\nmuch the subject of universal complaint, is produced, not only the\r\nremedy will immediately present itself, but, with it, the means of\r\npreventing the like case hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the confusion has generated itself from the\r\nabsurdity of every Parliament assuming to be eternal in power, and\r\nthe laws partake in a similar manner, of this assumption. They have no\r\nperiod of legal or natural expiration; and, however absurd in principle,\r\nor inconsistent in practice many of them have become, they still are,\r\nif not especially repealed, considered as making a part of the general\r\nmass. By this means the body of what is called Law, is spread over a\r\nspace of _several hundred years_, comprehending laws obsolete, laws\r\nrepugnant, laws ridiculous, and every other kind of laws forgotten\r\nor remembered; and what renders the case still worse, is, that the\r\nconfusion multiplies with the progress of time. (*)\r\n\r\nTo bring this misshapen monster into form, and to prevent its lapsing\r\nagain into a wilderness state, only two things, and those very simple,\r\nare necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first is, to review the whole mass of laws, and to bring forward\r\nsuch only as are worth retaining, and let all the rest drop; and to give\r\nto the laws so brought forward a new era, commencing from the time of\r\nsuch reform.\r\n\r\n     * In the time of Henry IV. a law was passed making it felony\r\n     \"to multiply gold or silver, or to make use of the craft of\r\n     multiplication,\" and this law remained two hundred and\r\n     eighty-six years upon the statute books. It was then\r\n     repealed as being ridiculous and injurious.--_Author_.\r\n\r\nSecondly; that at the expiration of every twenty-one years (or any other\r\nstated period) a like review shall again be taken, and the laws, found\r\nproper to be retained, be again carried forward, commencing with that\r\ndate, and the useless laws dropped and discontinued.\r\n\r\nBy this means there can be no obsolete laws, and scarcely such a thing\r\nas laws standing in direct or equivocal contradiction to each other, and\r\nevery person will know the period of time to which he is to look back\r\nfor all the laws in being.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking, that while every other branch of science is\r\nbrought within some commodious system, and the study of it simplified by\r\neasy methods, the laws take the contrary course, and become every year\r\nmore complicated, entangled, confused, and obscure.\r\n\r\nAmong the paragraphs which the Attorney General has taken from the\r\n_Rights of Man_, and put into his information, one is, that where I\r\nhave said, \"that with respect to regular law, there is _scarcely such a\r\nthing_.\"\r\n\r\nAs I do not know whether the Attorney-General means to show this\r\nexpression to be libellous, because it is TRUE, or because it is FALSE,\r\nI shall make no other reply to him in this place, than by remarking,\r\nthat if almanack-makers had not been more judicious than law-makers,\r\nthe study of almanacks would by this time have become as abstruse as the\r\nstudy of the law, and we should hear of a library of almanacks as we\r\nnow do of statutes; but by the simple operation of letting the obsolete\r\nmatter drop, and carrying forward that only which is proper to be\r\nretained, all that is necessary to be known is found within the space of\r\na year, and laws also admit of being kept within some given period.\r\n\r\nI shall here close this letter, so far as it respects the Addresses, the\r\nProclamation, and the Prosecution; and shall offer a few observations to\r\nthe Society, styling itself \"The Friends of the People.\"\r\n\r\nThat the science of government is beginning to be better understood than\r\nin former times, and that the age of fiction and political superstition,\r\nand of craft and mystery, is passing away, are matters which the\r\nexperience of every day-proves to be true, as well in England as in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nAs therefore it is impossible to calculate the silent progress of\r\nopinion, and also impossible to govern a nation after it has changed\r\nits habits of thinking, by the craft or policy that it was governed\r\nby before, the only true method to prevent popular discontents and\r\ncommotions is, to throw, by every fair and rational argument, all the\r\nlight upon the subject that can possibly be thrown; and at the same\r\ntime, to open the means of collecting the general sense of the nation;\r\nand this cannot, as already observed, be done by any plan so effectually\r\nas a national convention. Here individual opinion will quiet itself by\r\nhaving a centre to rest upon.\r\n\r\nThe society already mentioned, (which is made up of men of various\r\ndescriptions, but chiefly of those called Foxites,) appears to me,\r\neither to have taken wrong grounds from want of judgment, or to have\r\nacted with cunning reserve. It is now amusing the people with a\r\nnew phrase, namely, that of \"a temperate and moderate reform,\" the\r\ninterpretation of which is, _a continuance of the abuses as long as\r\npossible, If we cannot hold all let us hold some_.\r\n\r\nWho are those that are frightened at reforms? Are the public afraid that\r\ntheir taxes should be lessened too much? Are they afraid that sinecure\r\nplaces and pensions should be abolished too fast? Are the poor afraid\r\nthat their condition should be rendered too comfortable? Is the worn-out\r\nmechanic, or the aged and decayed tradesman, frightened at the prospect\r\nof receiving ten pounds a year out of the surplus taxes? Is the soldier\r\nfrightened at the thoughts of his discharge, and three shillings per\r\nweek during life? Is the sailor afraid that press-warrants will be\r\nabolished? The Society mistakes the fears of borough-mongers, placemen,\r\nand pensioners, for the fears of the people; and the _temperate and\r\nmoderate Reform_ it talks of, is calculated to suit the condition of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThose words, \"temperate and moderate,\" are words either of political\r\ncowardice, or of cunning, or seduction.--A thing, moderately good, is\r\nnot so good as it ought to be. Moderation in temper, is always a virtue;\r\nbut moderation in principle, is a species of vice. But who is to be the\r\njudge of what is a temperate and moderate Reform? The Society is the\r\nrepresentative of nobody; neither can the unrepresented part of the\r\nnation commit this power to those in Parliament, in whose election they\r\nhad no choice; and, therefore, even upon the ground the Society has\r\ntaken, recourse must be had to a National Convention.\r\n\r\nThe objection which Mr. Fox made to Mr. Grey's proposed Motion for a\r\nParliamentary Reform was, that it contained no plan.--It certainly did\r\nnot. But the plan very easily presents itself; and whilst it is fair\r\nfor all parties, it prevents the dangers that might otherwise arise from\r\nprivate or popular discontent.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Editorial Note on Burke's Alleged Secret Pension.--By\r\n     reference to Vol. II., pp. 271, 360, of this work, it will\r\n     be seen that Paine mentions a report that Burke was a\r\n     \"pensioner in a fictitious name.\" A letter of John Hall to a\r\n     relative in Leicester, (London, May 1,1792.) says: \"You will\r\n     remember that there was a vote carried, about the conclusion\r\n     of the American war, that the influence of the Crown had\r\n     increased, was increasing, and should be diminished. Burke,\r\n     poor, and like a good angler, baited a hook with a bill to\r\n     bring into Parliament, that no pensions should be given\r\n     above £300 a year, but what should be publicly granted, and\r\n     for what, (I may not be quite particular.) To stop that he\r\n     took in another person's name £1500 a year for life, and\r\n     some time past he disposed of it, or sold his life out. He\r\n     has been very still since his declension from the Whigs, and\r\n     is not concerned in the slave-trade [question?] as I hear\r\n     of.\" This letter, now in possession of Hall's kinsman, Dr.\r\n     Dutton Steele of Philadelphia, contains an item not in\r\n     Paine's account, which may have been derived from it. Hall\r\n     was an English scientific engineer, and acquainted with\r\n     intelligent men in London. Paine was rather eager for a\r\n     judicial encounter with Burke, and probably expected to be\r\n     sued by him for libel, as he (Burke) had once sued the\r\n     \"Public Advertiser\" for a personal accusation. But Burke\r\n     remained quiet under this charge, and Paine, outlawed, and\r\n     in France, had no opportunity for summoning witnesses in its\r\n     support. The biographers of Burke have silently passed over\r\n     the accusation, and this might be fair enough were this\r\n     unconfirmed charge made against a public man of stainless\r\n     reputation in such matters. But though Burke escaped\r\n     parliamentary censure for official corruption (May 16, 1783,\r\n     by only 24 majority) he has never been vindicated. It was\r\n     admitted that he had restored to office a cashier and an\r\n     accountant dismissed for dishonesty by his predecessor.\r\n     (\"Pari. Hist.,\" xxiii., pp. 801,902.) He escaped censure by\r\n     agreeing to suspend them.    One was proved guilty, the\r\n     other committed suicide. It was subsequently shown that one\r\n     of the men had been an agent of the Burkes in raising India\r\n     stock. (Dilke's \"Papers of a Critic,\" ii-, p. 333--\"Dict.\r\n     Nat Biography\": art Burke.) Paine, in his letter to the\r\n     Attorney-General (IV. of this volume), charged that Burke\r\n     had been a \"masked pensioner\" ten years. The date\r\n     corresponds with a secret arrangement made in 1782 with\r\n     Burke for a virtual pension to his son, for life, and his\r\n     mother. Under date April 34 of that year, Burke, writing to\r\n     William Burke at Madras, reports his appointment as\r\n     Paymaster: \"The office is to be 4000L. certain. Young\r\n     Richard [his son] is the deputy with a salary of 500L. The\r\n     office to be reformed according to the Bill. There is enough\r\n     emoluments. In decency it could not be more. Something\r\n     considerable is also to be secured for the life of young\r\n     Richard to be a security for him and his mother.\"(\"Mem. and\r\n     Cor. of Charles James Fox,\" i., p. 451.) It is thus certain\r\n     that the Rockingham Ministry were doing for the Paymaster\r\n     all they could \"in decency,\" and that while posing as a\r\n     reformer in reducing the expenses of that office, he was\r\n     arranging for secret advantages to his family. It is said\r\n     that the arrangement failed by his loss of office, but while\r\n     so many of Burke's papers are withheld from the public (if\r\n     not destroyed), it cannot be certain that something was not\r\n     done of the kind charged by Paine. That Burke was not strict\r\n     in such matters is further shown by his efforts to secure\r\n     for his son the rich sinecure of the Clerkship of the Polls,\r\n     in which he failed. Burke was again Paymaster in 1783-4, and\r\n     this time remained long enough in office to repeat more\r\n     successfully his secret attempts to secure irregular\r\n     pensions for his family. On April 7, 1894, Messrs. Sotheby,\r\n     Wilkinson, and Hodge sold in London (Lot 404) a letter of\r\n     Burke (which I have not seen in print), dated July 16, 1795.\r\n     It was written to the Chairman of the Commission on Public\r\n     Accounts, who had required him to render his accounts for\r\n     the time he was in office as Paymaster-General, 1783-4.\r\n     Burke refuses to do so in four angry and quibbling pages,\r\n     and declares he will appeal to his country against the\r\n     demand if it is pressed. Why should Burke wish to conceal\r\n     his accounts? There certainly were suspicions around Burke,\r\n     and they may have caused Pitt to renounce his intention,\r\n     conveyed to Burke, August 30, 1794, of asking Parliament to\r\n     bestow on him a pension. \"It is not exactly known,\" says one\r\n     of Burke's editors, \"what induced Mr. Pitt to decline\r\n     bringing before Parliament a measure which he had himself\r\n     proposed without any solicitation whatever on the part of\r\n     Burke.\" (Burke's \"Works,\" English Ed., 1852, ii., p. 252.)\r\n     The pensions were given without consultation with\r\n     Parliament--1200L. granted him by the King from the Civil\r\n     List, and 2500L. by Pitt in West Indian 41/2 per cents.\r\n     Burke, on taking his seat beside Pitt in the great Paine\r\n     Parliament (December, 1792), had protested that he had not\r\n     abandoned his party through expectation of a pension, but\r\n     the general belief of those with whom he had formerly acted\r\n     was that he had been promised a pension.   A couplet of the\r\n     time ran:\r\n\r\n     \"A pension makes him change his plan,\r\n     And loudly damn the rights of man.\"\r\n\r\n     Writing in 1819, Cobbett says: \"As my Lord Grenville\r\n     introduced the name of Burke, suffer me, my Lord, to\r\n     introduce the name of the man [Paine] who put this Burke to\r\n     shame, who drove him off the public stage to seek shelter in\r\n     the Pension List, and who is now named fifty million times\r\n     where the name of the pensioned Burke is mentioned once.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, Sept. 25, [1792.] First Year of the Republic.\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens,\r\n\r\nI RECEIVE, with affectionate gratitude, the honour which the late\r\nNational Assembly has conferred upon me, by adopting me a Citizen of\r\nFrance: and the additional honor of being elected by my fellow citizens\r\na Member of the National Convention.(1) Happily impressed, as I am, by\r\nthose testimonies of respect shown towards me as an individual, I feel\r\nmy felicity increased by seeing the barrier broken down that divided\r\npatriotism by spots of earth, and limited citizenship to the soil, like\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nHad those honours been conferred in an hour of national tranquillity,\r\nthey would have afforded no other means of shewing my affection, than\r\nto have accepted and enjoyed them; but they come accompanied with\r\ncircumstances that give me the honourable opportunity of commencing\r\nmy citizenship in the stormy hour of difficulties. I come not to enjoy\r\nrepose. Convinced that the cause of France is the cause of all mankind,\r\nand that liberty cannot be purchased by a wish, I gladly share with you\r\nthe dangers and honours necessary to success.\r\n\r\n     1 The National Assembly (August 26, 1792) conferred the\r\n     title of \"French Citizen\" on \"Priestley, Payne, Bentham,\r\n     Wilberforce, Clarkson, Mackintosh, Campe, Cormelle, Paw,\r\n     David Williams, Gorani, Anacharsis Clootz, Pestalozzi,\r\n     Washington, Hamilton, Madison, Klopstoc, Kosciusko,\r\n     Gilleers.\"--_Editor._. vol ni--7\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the moment of any great change, such as that\r\naccomplished on the 10th of August, is unavoidably the moment of\r\nterror and confusion. The mind, highly agitated by hope, suspicion and\r\napprehension, continues without rest till the change be accomplished.\r\nBut let us now look calmly and confidently forward, and success is\r\ncertain. It is no longer the paltry cause of kings, or of this, or of\r\nthat individual, that calls France and her armies into action. It is the\r\ngreat cause of all. It is the establishment of a new aera, that shall\r\nblot despotism from the earth, and fix, on the lasting principles of\r\npeace and citizenship, the great Republic of Man.\r\n\r\nIt has been my fate to have borne a share in the commencement and\r\ncomplete establishment of one Revolution, (I mean the Revolution of\r\nAmerica.) The success and events of that Revolution are encouraging to\r\nus. The prosperity and happiness that have since flowed to that country,\r\nhave amply rewarded her for all the hardships she endured and for all\r\nthe dangers she encountered.\r\n\r\nThe principles on which that Revolution began, have extended themselves\r\nto Europe; and an over-ruling Providence is regenerating the Old World\r\nby the principles of the New. The distance of America from all the\r\nother parts of the globe, did not admit of her carrying those principles\r\nbeyond her own situation. It is to the peculiar honour of France, that\r\nshe now raises the standard of liberty for all nations; and in fighting\r\nher own battles, contends for the rights of all mankind.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of fortitude that insured success to America; will\r\ninsure it to France, for it is impossible to conquer a nation determined\r\nto be free! The military circumstances that now unite themselves to\r\nFrance, are such as the despots of the earth know nothing of, and can\r\nform no calculation upon. They know not what it is to fight against a\r\nnation; they have only been accustomed to make war upon each other,\r\nand they know, from system and practice, how to calculate the probable\r\nsuccess of despot against despot; and here their knowledge and their\r\nexperience end.\r\n\r\nBut in a contest like the present a new and boundless variety of\r\ncircumstances arise, that deranges all such customary calculations. When\r\na whole nation acts as an army, the despot knows not the extent of the\r\npower against which he contends. New armies arise against him with the\r\nnecessity of the moment. It is then that the difficulties of an invading\r\nenemy multiply, as in the former case they diminished; and he finds them\r\nat their height when he expected them to end.\r\n\r\nThe only war that has any similarity of circumstances with the present,\r\nis the late revolution war in America. On her part, as it now is in\r\nFrance, it was a war of the whole nation:--there it was that the enemy,\r\nby beginning to conquer, put himself in a condition of being conquered.\r\nHis first victories prepared him for defeat. He advanced till he could\r\nnot retreat, and found himself in the midst of a nation of armies.\r\n\r\nWere it now to be proposed to the Austrians and Prussians, to escort\r\nthem into the middle of France, and there leave them to make the most\r\nof such a situation, they would see too much into the dangers of it to\r\naccept the offer, and the same dangers would attend them, could they\r\narrive there by any other means. Where, then, is the military policy of\r\ntheir attempting to obtain, by force, that which they would refuse by\r\nchoice? But to reason with despots is throwing reason away. The best of\r\narguments is a vigorous preparation.\r\n\r\nMan is ever a stranger to the ways by which Providence regulates the\r\norder of things. The interference of foreign despots may serve to\r\nintroduce into their own enslaved countries the principles they come\r\nto oppose. Liberty and Equality are blessings too great to be the\r\ninheritance of France alone. It is an honour to her to be their first\r\nchampion; and she may now say to her enemies, with a mighty voice, \"O!\r\nye Austrians, ye Prussians! ye who now turn your bayonets against us,\r\nit is for you, it is for all Europe, it is for all mankind, and not for\r\nFrance alone, that she raises the standard of Liberty and Equality!\"\r\n\r\nThe public cause has hitherto suffered from the contradictions contained\r\nin the Constitution of the Constituent Assembly. Those contradictions\r\nhave served to divide the opinions of individuals at home, and to\r\nobscure the great principles of the Revolution in other countries. But\r\nwhen those contradictions shall be removed, and the Constitution be\r\nmade conformable to the declaration of Rights; when the bagatelles of\r\nmonarchy, royalty, regency, and hereditary succession, shall be exposed,\r\nwith all their absurdities, a new ray of light will be thrown over the\r\nworld, and the Revolution will derive new strength by being universally\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe scene that now opens itself to France extends far beyond the\r\nboundaries of her own dominions. Every nation is becoming her colleague,\r\nand every court is become her enemy. It is now the cause of all nations,\r\nagainst the cause of all courts. The terror that despotism felt,\r\nclandestinely begot a confederation of despots; and their attack upon\r\nFrance was produced by their fears at home.\r\n\r\nIn entering on this great scene, greater than any nation has yet been\r\ncalled to act in, let us say to the agitated mind, be calm. Let us\r\npunish by instructing, rather than by revenge. Let us begin the new\r\nara by a greatness of friendship, and hail the approach of union and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nYour Fellow-Citizen,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. ANTI-MONARCHAL ESSAY. FOR THE USE OF NEW REPUBLICANS.(1)\r\n\r\nWhen we reach some great good, long desired, we begin by felicitating\r\nourselves. We triumph, we give ourselves up to this joy without\r\nrendering to our minds any full account of our reasons for it. Then\r\ncomes reflexion: we pass in review all the circumstances of our new\r\nhappiness; we compare it in detail with our former condition; and\r\neach of these thoughts becomes a fresh enjoyment. This satisfaction,\r\nelucidated and well-considered, we now desire to procure for our\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nIn seeing Royalty abolished and the Republic established, all France\r\nhas resounded with unanimous plaudits.(2) Yet, Citizen President: In the\r\nname of the Deputies of the Department of the Pas de Calais, I have the\r\nhonor of presenting to the Convention the felicitations of the General\r\nCouncil of the Commune of Calais on the abolition of Royalty.\r\n\r\n     1 Translated for this work from Le Patriote François,\r\n     \"Samedi 20 Octobre, 1793, l'an Ier de la République.\r\n     Supplement au No. 1167,\" in the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\n     Paris. It is headed, \"Essai anti-monarchique, à l'usage des\r\n     nouveaux républicains, tiré de la Feuille Villageoise.\" I\r\n     have not found this Feuille, but no doubt Brissot, in\r\n     editing the essay for his journal (Le Patriote François)\r\n     abridged it, and in one instance Paine is mentioned by name.\r\n     Although in this essay Paine occasionally repeats sentences\r\n     used elsewhere, and naturally maintains his well-known\r\n     principles, the work has a peculiar interest as indicating\r\n     the temper and visions of the opening revolution.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Royalty was abolished by the National Convention on the\r\n     first day of its meeting, September 21, 1792, the\r\n     revolutionary Calendar beginning next day. Paine was chosen\r\n     by his fellow-deputies of Calais to congratulate the\r\n     Convention, and did so in a brief address, dated October 27,\r\n     which was loaned by M. Charavay to the Historical Exposition\r\n     of the Revolution at Paris, 1889, where I made the subjoined\r\n     translation: \"folly of oar ancestor», who have placed us\r\n     under the necessity of treating gravely (solennellement) the\r\n     abolition of a phantom (fantôme).--Thomas Paine, Deputy.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nAmid the joy inspired by this event, one cannot forbear some pain\r\nat the some who clap their hands do not sufficiently understand the\r\ncondition they are leaving or that which they are assuming.\r\n\r\nThe perjuries of Louis, the conspiracies of his court, the wildness of\r\nhis worthy brothers, have filled every Frenchman with horror, and this\r\nrace was dethroned in their hearts before its fall by legal decree. But\r\nit is little to throw down an idol; it is the pedestal that above all\r\nmust be broken down; it is the regal office rather than the incumbent\r\nthat is murderous. All do not realize this.\r\n\r\nWhy is Royalty an absurd and detestable government? Why is the Republic\r\na government accordant with nature and reason? At the present time a\r\nFrenchman should put himself in a position to answer these two questions\r\nclearly. For, in fine, if you are free and contented it is yet needful\r\nthat you should know why.\r\n\r\nLet us first discuss Royalty or Monarchy. Although one often wishes to\r\ndistinguish between these names, common usage gives them the same sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYALTY.\r\n\r\nBands of brigands unite to subvert a country, place it under tribute,\r\nseize its lands, enslave its inhabitants. The expedition completed, the\r\nchieftain of the robbers adopts the title of monarch or king. Such\r\nis the origin of Royalty among all tribes--huntsmen, agriculturists,\r\nshepherds.\r\n\r\nA second brigand arrives who finds it equitable to take away by force\r\nwhat was conquered by violence: he dispossesses the first; he chains\r\nhim, kills him, reigns in his place. Ere long time effaces the memory\r\nof this origin; the successors rule under a new form; they do a little\r\ngood, from policy; they corrupt all who surround them; they invent\r\nfictitious genealogies to make their families sacred (1); the knavery\r\nof priests comes to their aid; they take Religion for a life-guard:\r\nthenceforth tyranny becomes immortal, the usurped power becomes an\r\nhereditary right.\r\n\r\n     1 The Boston Investigator's compilation of Paine's Works\r\n     contains the following as  supposed to be Mr. Paine's:\r\n\r\n     \"Royal Pedigree.--George the Third, who was the grandson of\r\n     George the Second, who was the son of George the First, who\r\n     was the son of the Princess Sophia, who was the cousin of\r\n     Anne, who was the sister of William and Mary, who were the\r\n     daughter and son-in-law of James the Second, who was the son\r\n     of Charles the First, who was a traitor to his country and\r\n     decapitated as such, who was the son of James the First, who\r\n     was the son of Mary, who was the sister of Edward the Sixth,\r\n     who was the son of Henry the Eighth, who was the coldblooded\r\n     murderer of his wives, and the promoter of the Protestant\r\n     religion, who was the son of Henry the Seventh, who slew\r\n     Richard the Third, who smothered his nephew Edward the\r\n     Fifth, who was the son of Edward the Fourth, who with bloody\r\n     Richard slew Henry the Sixth, who succeeded Henry the Fifth,\r\n     who was the son of Henry the Fourth, who was the cousin of\r\n     Richard the Second, who was the son of Edward the Third, who\r\n     was the son of Richard the Second, who was the son of Edward\r\n     the First, who was the son of Henry the Third, who was the\r\n     son of John, who was the brother of Richard the First, who\r\n     was the son of Henry the Second, who was the son of Matilda,\r\n     who was the daughter of Henry the First, who was the brother\r\n     of William Rufus, who was the son of William the Conqueror,\r\n     who was the son of a whore.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe effects of Royalty have been entirely harmonious with its origin.\r\nWhat scenes of horror, what refinements of iniquity, do the annals of\r\nmonarchies present! If we should paint human nature with a baseness of\r\nheart, an hypocrisy, from which all must recoil and humanity disavow, it\r\nwould be the portraiture of kings, their ministers and courtiers.\r\n\r\nAnd why should it not be so? What should such a monstrosity produce\r\nbut miseries and crimes? What is monarchy? It has been finely disguised,\r\nand the people familiarized with the odious title: in its real sense the\r\nword signifies _the absolute power of one single individual_, who may\r\nwith impunity be stupid, treacherous, tyrannical, etc. Is it not an\r\ninsult to nations to wish them so governed?\r\n\r\nGovernment by a single individual is vicious in itself, independently of\r\nthe individual's vices. For however little a State, the prince is\r\nnearly always too small: where is the proportion between one man and the\r\naffairs of a whole nation?\r\n\r\nTrue, some men of genius have been seen under the diadem; but the evil\r\nis then even greater: the ambition of such a man impels him to conquest\r\nand despotism, his subjects soon have to lament his glory, and sing\r\ntheir _Te-deums_ while perishing with hunger. Such is the history of\r\nLouis XIV. and so many others.\r\n\r\nBut if ordinary men in power repay you with incapacity or with princely\r\nvices? But those who come to the front in monarchies are frequently\r\nmere mean mischief-makers, commonplace knaves, petty intriguers, whose\r\nsmall wits, which in courts reach large places, serve only to display\r\ntheir ineptitude in public, as soon as they appear. (*) In short,\r\nmonarchs do nothing, and their ministers do evil: this is the history of\r\nall monarchies.\r\n\r\nBut if Royalty as such is baneful, as hereditary succession it is\r\nequally revolting and ridiculous. What! there exists among my kind a man\r\nwho pretends that he is born to govern me? Whence derived he such right?\r\nFrom his and my ancestors, says he. But how could they transmit to him\r\na right they did not possess? Man has no authority over generations\r\nunborn. I cannot be the slave of the dead, more than of the living.\r\nSuppose that instead of our posterity, it was we who should succeed\r\nourselves: we should not to-day be able to despoil ourselves of the\r\nrights which would belong to us in our second life: for a stronger\r\nreason we cannot so despoil others.\r\n\r\nAn hereditary crown! A transmissible throne! What a notion! With even a\r\nlittle reflexion, can any one tolerate it? Should human beings then be\r\nthe property of certain individuals, born or to be born? Are we then to\r\ntreat our descendants in advance as cattle, who shall have neither will\r\nnor rights of their own? To inherit government is to inherit peoples,\r\nas if they were herds. It is the basest, the most shameful fantasy that\r\never degraded mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to reproach kings with their ferocity, their brutal\r\nindifference, the oppressions of the people, and molestations of\r\ncitizens: it is hereditary succession that makes them what they are:\r\nthis breeds monsters as a marsh breeds vipers.\r\n\r\n     * J. J. Rousseau, Contrat Social.--Author.\r\n\r\nThe logic on which the hereditary prince rests is in effect this: I\r\nderive my power from my birth; I derive my birth from God; therefore\r\nI owe nothing to men. It is little that he has at hand a complacent\r\nminister, he continues to indulge, conscientiously, in all the crimes of\r\ntyranny. This has been seen in all times and countries.\r\n\r\nTell me, then, what is there in common between him who is master of a\r\npeople, and the people of whom he is master? Are these masters really of\r\ntheir kind? It is by sympathy that we are good and human: with whom does\r\na monarch sympathize? When my neighbor suffers I pity, because I put\r\nmyself in his place: a monarch pities none, because he has never been,\r\ncan never be, in any other place than his own.\r\n\r\nA monarch is an egoist by nature, the _egoist par excellence_. A\r\nthousand traits show that this kind of men have no point of contact with\r\nthe rest of humanity. There was demanded of Charles II. the punishment\r\nof Lauderdale, his favorite, who had infamously oppressed the Scotch.\r\n\"Yes,\" said Charles coolly, \"this man has done much against the Scotch,\r\nbut I cannot see that he has done anything against my interests.\" Louis\r\nXIV. often said: \"If I follow the wishes of the people, I cannot act the\r\nking.\" Even such phrases as \"misfortunes of the State,\" \"safety of the\r\nState,\" filled Louis XIV. with wrath.\r\n\r\nCould nature make a law which should assure virtue and wisdom invariably\r\nin these privileged castes that perpetuate themselves on thrones, there\r\nwould be no objection to their hereditary succession. But let us pass\r\nEurope in review: all of its monarchs are the meanest of men. This one\r\na tyrant, that one an imbecile, another a traitor, the next a debauchee,\r\nwhile some muster all the vices. It looks as if fate and nature had\r\naimed to show our epoch, and all nations, the absurdity and enormity of\r\nRoyalty.\r\n\r\nBut I mistake: this epoch has nothing peculiar. For, such is the\r\nessential vice of this royal succession by animal filiation, the peoples\r\nhave not even the chances of nature,--they cannot even hope for a good\r\nprince as an alternative. All things conspire to deprive of reason\r\nand justice an individual reared to command others. The word of young\r\nDionysius was very sensible: his father, reproaching him for a shameful\r\naction, said, \"Have I given thee such example?\" \"Ah,\" answered the\r\nyouth, \"thy father was not a king!\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, were laughter on such a subject permissible, nothing would\r\nsuggest ideas more burlesque than this fantastic institution of\r\nhereditary kings. Would it not be believed, to look at them, that there\r\nreally exist particular lineages possessing certain qualities which\r\nenter the blood of the embryo prince, and adapt him physically\r\nfor royalty, as a horse for the racecourse? But then, in this wild\r\nsupposition, it yet becomes necessary to assure the genuine family\r\ndescent of the heir presumptive. To perpetuate the noble race of\r\nAndalusian chargers, the circumstances pass before witnesses, and\r\nsimilar precautions seem necessary, however indecent, to make sure that\r\nthe trickeries of queens shall not supply thrones with bastards, and\r\nthat the kings, like the horses, shall always be thoroughbreds.\r\n\r\nWhether one jests or reasons, there is found in this idea of hereditary\r\nroyalty only folly and shame. What then is this office, which may be\r\nfilled by infants or idiots? Some talent is required to be a simple\r\nworkman; to be a king there is need to have only the human shape, to be\r\na living automaton. We are astonished when reading that the Egyptians\r\nplaced on the throne a flint, and called it their king. We smile at\r\nthe dog Barkouf, sent by an Asiatic despot to govern one of his\r\nprovinces.(*) But mon-archs of this kind are less mischievous and less\r\nabsurd than those before whom whole peoples prostrate themselves. The\r\nflint and the dog at least imposed on nobody. None ascribed to them\r\nqualities or characters they did not possess. They were not styled\r\n'Father of the People,'--though this were hardly more ridiculous than\r\nto give that title to a rattle-head whom inheritance crowns at eighteen.\r\nBetter a mute than an animate idol. Why, there can hardly be cited an\r\ninstance of a great man having children worthy of him, yet you will have\r\nthe royal function pass from father to son! As well declare that a wise\r\nman's son will be wise. A king is an administrator, and an hereditary\r\nadministrator is as absurd as an author by birthright.\r\n\r\n     * See the first year of La Feuille Villageoise, No. 42.--\r\n     Author. [Cf. Montaigne's Essays, chap. xii.--_Editor._]\r\n\r\nRoyalty is thus as contrary to common sense as to com-mon right. But it\r\nwould be a plague even if no more than an absurdity; for a people who\r\ncan bow down in honor of a silly thing is a debased people. Can they be\r\nfit for great affairs who render equal homage to vice and virtue, and\r\nyield the same submission to ignorance and wisdom? Of all institutions,\r\nnone has caused more intellectual degeneracy. This explains the\r\noften-remarked abjectness of character under monarchies.\r\n\r\nSuch is also the effect of this contagious institution that it renders\r\nequality impossible, and draws in its train the presumption and the\r\nevils of \"Nobility.\" If you admit inheritance of an office, why not that\r\nof a distinction? The Nobility's heritage asks only homage, that of\r\nthe Crown commands submission. When a man says to me, 'I am born\r\nillustrious,' I merely smile; when he says 'I am born your master,' I\r\nset my foot on him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Convention pronounced the abolition of Royalty none rose\r\nfor the defence that was expected. On this subject a philosopher, who\r\nthought discussion should always precede enactment, proposed a singular\r\nthing; he desired that the Convention should nominate an orator\r\ncommissioned to plead before it the cause of Royalty, so that the\r\npitiful arguments by which it has in all ages been justified might\r\nappear in broad daylight. Judges give one accused, however certain\r\nhis guilt, an official defender. In the ancient Senate of Venice there\r\nexisted a public officer whose function was to contest all propositions,\r\nhowever incontestible, or however perfect their evidence. For the rest,\r\npleaders for Royalty are not rare: let us open them, and see what the\r\nmost specious of royalist reasoners have said.\r\n\r\n1. _A king is necessary to preserve a people from the tyranny of\r\npowerful men_.\r\n\r\nEstablish the Rights of Man(1); enthrone Equality; form a good\r\nConstitution; divide well its powers; let there be no privileges, no\r\ndistinctions of birth, no monopolies; make safe the liberty of industry\r\nand of trade, the equal distribution of [family] inheritances, publicity\r\nof administration, freedom of the press: these things all established,\r\nyou will be assured of good laws, and need not fear the powerful men.\r\nWillingly or unwillingly, all citizens will be under the Law.\r\n\r\n     1 The reader should bear in mind that this phrase, now used\r\n     vaguely, had for Paine and his political school a special\r\n     significance; it implied a fundamental Declaration of\r\n     individual rights, of supreme force and authority, invasion\r\n     which, either by legislatures, law courts, majorities, or\r\n     administrators, was to be regarded as the worst treason and\r\n     despotism.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n2. _The Legislature might usurp authority, and a king is needed to\r\nrestrain it_.\r\n\r\nWith representatives, frequently renewed, who neither administer\r\nnor judge, whose functions are determined by the laws; with national\r\nconventions, with primary assemblies, which can be convoked any moment;\r\nwith a people knowing how to read, and how to defend itself; with good\r\njournals, guns, and pikes; a Legislature would have a good deal of\r\ntrouble in enjoying any months of tyranny. Let us not suppose an evil\r\nfor the sake of its remedy.\r\n\r\n3. _A king is needed to give force to executive power_.\r\n\r\nThis might be said while there existed nobles, a priesthood,\r\nparliaments, the privileged of every kind. But at present who can resist\r\nthe Law, which is the will of all, whose execution is the interest of\r\nall? On the contrary the existence of an hereditary prince inspires\r\nperpetual distrust among the friends of liberty; his authority is odious\r\nto them; in checking despotism they constantly obstruct the action of\r\ngovernment. Observe how feeble the executive power was found, after our\r\nrecent pretence of marrying Royalty with Liberty.\r\n\r\nTake note, for the rest, that those who talk in this way are men who\r\nbelieve that the King and the Executive Power are only one and the same\r\nthing: readers of _La Feuille Villageoise_ are more advanced.(*)\r\n\r\n     * See No. 50.--_Author_\r\n\r\nOthers use this bad reasoning: \"Were there no hereditary chief there\r\nwould be an elective chief: the citizens would side with this man or\r\nthat, and there would be a civil war at every election.\" In the first\r\nplace, it is certain that hereditary succession alone has produced\r\nthe civil wars of France and England; and that beyond this are the\r\npre-tended rights, of royal families which have twenty times drawn on\r\nthese nations the scourge of foreign wars. It is, in fine, the heredity\r\nof crowns that has caused the troubles of Regency, which Thomas Paine\r\ncalls Monarchy at nurse.\r\n\r\nBut above all it must be said, that if there be an elective chief, that\r\nchief will not be a king surrounded by courtiers, burdened with pomp,\r\ninflated by idolatries, and endowed with thirty millions of money; also,\r\nthat no citizen will be tempted to injure himself by placing another\r\ncitizen, his equal, for some years in an office without limited income\r\nand circumscribed power.\r\n\r\nIn a word, whoever demands a king demands an aristocracy, and thirty\r\nmillions of taxes. See why Franklin described Royalism as _a crime like\r\npoisoning_.\r\n\r\nRoyalty, its fanatical eclat, its superstitious idolatry, the delusive\r\nassumption of its necessity, all these fictions have been invented only\r\nto obtain from men excessive taxes and voluntary servitude. Royalty\r\nand Popery have had the same aim, have sustained themselves by the same\r\nartifices, and crumble under the same Light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, ON THE PROSECUTION AGAINST THE SECOND PART\r\nOF RIGHTS OF MAN.(1)\r\n\r\nParis, 11th of November, 1st Year of the Republic. [1792.]\r\n\r\nMr. Attorney General:\r\n\r\nSir,--As there can be no personal resentment between two strangers, I\r\nwrite this letter to you, as to a man against whom I have no animosity.\r\n\r\nYou have, as Attorney General, commenced a prosecution against me, as\r\nthe author of Rights of Man. Had not my duty, in consequence of my being\r\nelected a member of the National Convention of France, called me from\r\nEngland, I should have staid to have contested the injustice of\r\nthat prosecution; not upon my own account, for I cared not about the\r\nprosecution, but to have defended the principles I had advanced in the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n     1 Read to the Jury by the Attorney General, Sir Archibald\r\n     Macdonald, at the trial of Paine, December 18, 1792, which\r\n     resulted in his outlawry.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe duty I am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to\r\ntrouble myself about your prosecution: when I have leisure, I shall have\r\nno objection to meet you on that ground; but, as I now stand, whether\r\nyou go on with the prosecution, or whether you do not, or whether you\r\nobtain a verdict, or not, is a matter of the most perfect indifference\r\nto me as an individual. If you obtain one, (which you are welcome to\r\nif you can get it,) it cannot affect me either in person, property, or\r\nreputation, otherwise than to increase the latter; and with respect to\r\nyourself, it is as consistent that you obtain a verdict against the Man\r\nin the Moon as against me; neither do I see how you can continue the\r\nprosecution against me as you would have done against one _your own\r\npeople, who_ had absented himself because he was prosecuted; what passed\r\nat Dover proves that my departure from England was no secret. (1)\r\n\r\nMy necessary absence from your country affords the opportunity of\r\nknowing whether the prosecution was intended against Thomas Paine, or\r\nagainst the Right of the People of England to investigate systems and\r\nprinciples of government; for as I cannot now be the object of the\r\nprosecution, the going on with the prosecution will shew that something\r\nelse was the object, and that something else can be no other than the\r\nPeople of England, for it is against _their Rights_, and not against\r\nme, that a verdict or sentence can operate, if it can operate at all.\r\nBe then so candid as to tell the Jury, (if you choose to continue the\r\nprocess,) whom it is you are prosecuting, and on whom it is that the\r\nverdict is to fall.(2)\r\n\r\nBut I have other reasons than those I have mentioned for writing you\r\nthis letter; and, however you may choose to interpret them, they proceed\r\nfrom a good heart. The time, Sir, is becoming too serious to play\r\nwith Court prosecutions, and sport with national rights. The terrible\r\nexamples that have taken place here, upon men who, less than a year ago,\r\nthought themselves as secure as any prosecuting Judge, Jury, or Attorney\r\nGeneral, now can in England, ought to have some weight with men in\r\nyour situation. That the government of England is as great, if not the\r\ngreatest, perfection of fraud and corruption that ever took place since\r\ngovernments began, is what you cannot be a stranger to, unless the\r\nconstant habit of seeing it has blinded your senses; but though you\r\nmay not chuse to see it, the people are seeing it very fast, and the\r\nprogress is beyond what you may chuse to believe. Is it possible that\r\nyou, or I, can believe, or that reason can make any other man believe,\r\nthat the capacity of such a man as Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate\r\nsons, is necessary to the government of a nation? I speak to you as one\r\nman ought to speak to another; and I know also that I speak what other\r\npeople are beginning to think.\r\n\r\n     1 See Chapter VIII. of this volume.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 In reading the letter in court the Attorney General said\r\n     at this point: \"Gentlemen, I certainly will comply with\r\n     this request. I am prosecuting both him and his work; and\r\n     if I succeed in this prosecution, he shall never return to\r\n     this country otherwise than _in vintulis_, for I will outlaw\r\n     him.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThat you cannot obtain a verdict (and if you do, it will signify\r\nnothing) _without packing a Jury_, (and we _both_ know that such tricks\r\nare practised,) is what I have very good reason to believe, I have gone\r\ninto coffee-houses, and places where I was unknown, on purpose to learn\r\nthe currency of opinion, and I never yet saw any company of twelve men\r\nthat condemned the book; but I have often found a greater number than\r\ntwelve approving it, and this I think is _a fair way of collecting the\r\nnatural currency of opinion_. Do not then, Sir, be the instrument of\r\ndrawing twelve men into a situation that may be _injurious_ to them\r\nafterwards. I do not speak this from policy, but from benevolence; but\r\nif you chuse to go on with the process, I make it my request to you that\r\nyou will read this letter in Court, after which the Judge and the Jury\r\nmay do as they please. As I do not consider myself the object of the\r\nprosecution, neither can I be affected by the issue, one way or the\r\nother, I shall, though a foreigner in your country, subscribe as much\r\nmoney as any other man towards supporting the right of the nation\r\nagainst the prosecution; and it is for this purpose only that I shall do\r\nit.(1)\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nAs I have not time to copy letters, you will excuse the corrections.\r\n\r\n     1 In reading this letter at the trial the Attorney\r\n     interspersed comments. At the phrase, \"Mr. Guelph and his\r\n     profligate sons,\" he exclaimed: \"This passage is\r\n     contemptuous, scandalous, false, cruel. Why, gentlemen, is\r\n     Mr. Paine, in addition to the political doctrines he is\r\n     teaching us in this country, to teach us the morality and\r\n     religion of implacability? Is he to teach human creatures,\r\n     whose moments of existence depend upon the permission of a\r\n     Being, merciful, long-suffering, and of great goodness, that\r\n     those youthful errors from which even royalty is not\r\n     exempted, are to be treasured up in a vindictive memory, and\r\n     are to receive sentence of irremissible sin at His hands....\r\n     If giving me pain was his object he has that hellish\r\n     gratification.\" Erskine, Fame's counsel, protested in\r\n     advance against the reading of this letter (of which he had\r\n     heard), as containing matter likely to divert the Jury from\r\n     the subject of prosecution (the book). Lord Kenyon admitted\r\n     the letter.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nP. S. I intended, had I staid in England, to have published the\r\ninformation, with my remarks upon it, before the trial came on; but as\r\nI am otherwise engaged, I reserve myself till the trial is over, when I\r\nshall reply fully to every thing you shall advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. ON THE PROPRIETY OF BRINGING LOUIS XVI. TO TRIAL.(1)\r\n\r\nRead to the Convention, November 21, 1792.\r\n\r\nParis, Nov. 20, 1792.\r\n\r\nCitizen President,\r\n\r\nAs I do not know precisely what day the Convention will resume the\r\ndiscussion on the trial of Louis XVI., and, on account of my inability\r\nto express myself in French, I cannot speak at the tribune, I request\r\npermission to deposit in your hands the enclosed paper, which contains\r\nmy opinion on that subject. I make this demand with so much more\r\neagerness, because circumstances will prove how much it imports to\r\nFrance, that Louis XVI. should continue to enjoy good health. I should\r\nbe happy if the Convention would have the goodness to hear this paper\r\nread this morning, as I propose sending a copy of it to London, to be\r\nprinted in the English journals.(2)\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n     1 This address, which has suffered by alterations in all\r\n     editions is here revised and completed by aid of the\r\n     official document: \"Opinion de Thomas Payne, Depute du\r\n     Département de la Somme [error], concernant le jugement de\r\n     Louis XVI. Précédé par sa lettre d'envoi au Président de la\r\n     Convention. Imprimé par ordre de la Convention Nationale. À\r\n     Paris. De l'Imprimerie Nationale.\" Lamartine has censured\r\n     Paine for this speech; but the trial of the King was a\r\n     foregone conclusion, and it will be noted that Paine was\r\n     already trying to avert popular wrath from the individual\r\n     man by directing it against the general league of monarchs,\r\n     and the monarchal system. Nor would his plea for the King's\r\n     life have been listened to but for this previous address.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Of course no English journal could then venture to print\r\n     it.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nA Secretary read the opinion of Thomas Paine. I think it necessary\r\nthat Louis XVI. should be tried; not that this advice is suggested by\r\na spirit of vengeance, but because this measure appears to me just,\r\nlawful, and conformable to sound policy. If Louis is innocent, let us\r\nput him to prove his innocence; if he is guilty, let the national will\r\ndetermine whether he shall be pardoned or punished.\r\n\r\nBut besides the motives personal to Louis XVI., there are others which\r\nmake his trial necessary. I am about to develope these motives, in the\r\nlanguage which I think expresses them, and no other. I forbid myself the\r\nuse of equivocal expression or of mere ceremony. There was formed among\r\nthe crowned brigands of Europe a conspiracy which threatened not only\r\nFrench liberty, but likewise that of all nations. Every thing tends\r\nto the belief that Louis XVI. was the partner of this horde of\r\nconspirators. You have this man in your power, and he is at present the\r\nonly one of the band of whom you can make sure. I consider Louis XVI. in\r\nthe same point of view as the two first robbers taken up in the affair\r\nof the Store Room; their trial led to discovery of the gang to which\r\nthey belonged. We have seen the unhappy soldiers of Austria, of Prussia,\r\nand the other powers which declared themselves our enemies, torn from\r\ntheir fire-sides, and drawn to butchery like wretched animals, to\r\nsustain, at the cost of their blood, the common cause of these crowned\r\nbrigands. They loaded the inhabitants of those regions with taxes to\r\nsupport the expenses of the war. All this was not done solely for Louis\r\nXVI. Some of the conspirators have acted openly: but there is reason\r\nto presume that this conspiracy is composed of two classes of brigands;\r\nthose who have taken up arms, and those who have lent to their cause\r\nsecret encouragement and clandestine assistance. Now it is indispensable\r\nto let France and the whole world know all these accomplices.\r\n\r\nA little time after the National Convention was constituted, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs presented the picture of all the\r\ngovernments of Europe,--those whose hostilities were public, and those\r\nthat acted with a mysterious circumspection. This picture supplied\r\ngrounds for just suspicions of the part the latter were disposed to\r\ntake, and since then various circumstances have occurred to confirm\r\nthose suspicions. We have already penetrated into some part of the\r\nconduct of Mr. Guelph, Elector of Hanover, and strong presumptions\r\ninvolve the same man, his court and ministers, in quality of king\r\nof England. M. Calonne has constantly been favoured with a friendly\r\nreception at that court.(1) The arrival of Mr. Smith, secretary to Mr.\r\nPitt, at Coblentz, when the emigrants were assembling there; the recall\r\nof the English ambassador; the extravagant joy manifested by the court\r\nof St. James' at the false report of the defeat of Dumouriez, when\r\nit was communicated by Lord Elgin, then Minister of Great Britain at\r\nBrussels--all these circumstances render him [George III.] extremely\r\nsuspicious; the trial of Louis XVI. will probably furnish more decisive\r\nproofs.\r\n\r\nThe long subsisting fear of a revolution in England, would alone, I\r\nbelieve, prevent that court from manifesting as much publicity in its\r\noperations as Austria and Prussia. Another reason could be added to\r\nthis: the inevitable decrease of credit, by means of which alone all\r\nthe old governments could obtain fresh loans, in proportion as the\r\nprobability of revolutions increased. Whoever invests in the new loans\r\nof such governments must expect to lose his stock.\r\n\r\nEvery body knows that the Landgrave of Hesse fights only as far as he is\r\npaid. He has been for many years in the pay of the court of London. If\r\nthe trial of Louis XVI. could bring it to light, that this detestable\r\ndealer in human flesh has been paid with the produce of the taxes\r\nimposed on the English people, it would be justice to that nation to\r\ndisclose that fact. It would at the same time give to France an exact\r\nknowledge of the character of that court, which has not ceased to be the\r\nmost intriguing in Europe, ever since its connexion with Germany.\r\n\r\n     1 Calonne (1734-1802), made Controller General of the\r\n     Treasury in 1783, lavished the public money on the Queen, on\r\n     courtiers, and on himself (purchasing St. Cloud and\r\n     Rambouillet), borrowing vast sums and deceiving the King as\r\n     to the emptiness of the Treasury, the annual deficit having\r\n     risen in 1787 to 115 millions of francs. He was then\r\n     banished to Lorraine, whence he proceeded to England, where\r\n     he married the wealthy widow Haveley. By his agency for the\r\n     Coblentz party he lost his fortune. In 1802 Napoleon brought\r\n     him back from London to Paris, where he died the same year.\r\n     --_Editor._\r\n\r\nLouis XVI., considered as an individual, is an object beneath the notice\r\nof the Republic; but when he is looked upon as a part of that band of\r\nconspirators, as an accused man whose trial may lead all nations in\r\nthe world to know and detest the disastrous system of monarchy, and the\r\nplots and intrigues of their own courts, he ought to be tried.\r\n\r\nIf the crimes for which Louis XVI. is arraigned were absolutely personal\r\nto him, without reference to general conspiracies, and confined to the\r\naffairs of France, the plea of inviolability, that folly of the moment,\r\nmight have been urged in his behalf with some appearance of reason; but\r\nhe is arraigned not only for treasons against France, but for having\r\nconspired against all Europe, and if France is to be just to all Europe\r\nwe ought to use every means in our power to discover the whole extent\r\nof that conspiracy. France is now a republic; she has completed her\r\nrevolution; but she cannot earn all its advantages so long as she is\r\nsurrounded with despotic governments. Their armies and their marine\r\noblige her also to keep troops and ships in readiness. It is therefore\r\nher immediate interest that all nations shall be as free as herself;\r\nthat revolutions shall be universal; and since the trial of Louis XVI.\r\ncan serve to prove to the world the flagitiousness of governments in\r\ngeneral, and the necessity of revolutions, she ought not to let slip so\r\nprecious an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe despots of Europe have formed alliances to preserve their respective\r\nauthority, and to perpetuate the oppression of peoples. This is the end\r\nthey proposed to themselves in their invasion of French territory. They\r\ndread the effect of the French revolution in the bosom of their own\r\ncountries; and in hopes of preventing it, they are come to attempt\r\nthe destruction of this revolution before it should attain its perfect\r\nmaturity. Their attempt has not been attended with success. France has\r\nalready vanquished their armies; but it remains for her to sound the\r\nparticulars of the conspiracy, to discover, to expose to the eyes of\r\nthe world, those despots who had the infamy to take part in it; and the\r\nworld expects from her that act of justice.\r\n\r\nThese are my motives for demanding that Louis XVI. be judged; and it is\r\nin this sole point of view that his trial appears to me of sufficient\r\nimportance to receive the attention of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAs to \"inviolability,\" I would not have such a word mentioned. If,\r\nseeing in Louis XVI. only a weak and narrow-minded man, badly reared,\r\nlike all his kind, given, as it is said, to frequent excesses of\r\ndrunkenness--a man whom the National Assembly imprudently raised again\r\non a throne for which he was not made--he is shown hereafter some\r\ncompassion, it shall be the result of the national magnanimity, and not\r\nthe burlesque notion of a pretended \"inviolability.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.  REASONS FOR PRESERVING THE LIFE OF LOUIS CAPET,\r\n\r\nAs Delivered to the National Convention, January 15, 1703.(1)\r\n\r\nCitizen President,\r\n\r\nMy hatred and abhorrence of monarchy are sufficiently known: they\r\noriginate in principles of reason and conviction, nor, except with life,\r\ncan they ever be extirpated; but my compassion for the unfortunate,\r\nwhether friend or enemy, is equally lively and sincere.\r\n\r\nI voted that Louis should be tried, because it was necessary to afford\r\nproofs to the world of the perfidy, corruption, and abomination of the\r\nmonarchical system. The infinity of evidence that has been produced\r\nexposes them in the most glaring and hideous colours; thence it results\r\nthat monarchy, whatever form it may assume, arbitrary or otherwise,\r\nbecomes necessarily a centre round which are united every species of\r\ncorruption, and the kingly trade is no less destructive of all morality\r\nin the human breast, than the trade of an executioner is destructive\r\nof its sensibility. I remember, during my residence in another country,\r\nthat I was exceedingly struck with a sentence of M. Autheine, at the\r\nJacobins [Club], which corresponds exactly with my own idea,--\"Make me a\r\nking to-day,\" said he, \"and I shall be a robber to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Printed in Paris (Hartley, Adlard & Son) and published in\r\n     London with the addition of D. I. Eaton's name, in 1796.\r\n     While Paine was in prison, he was accused in England and\r\n     America of having helped to bring Louis XVI. to the\r\n     scaffold. The English pamphlet has a brief preface in which\r\n     it is presented \"as a burnt offering to Truth, in behalf of\r\n     the most zealous friend and advocate of the Rights of Man;\r\n     to protect him against the barbarous shafts of scandal and\r\n     delusion, and as a reply to all the horrors which despots of\r\n     every description have, with such unrelenting malice,\r\n     attempted to fix on his conduct. But truth in the end must\r\n     triumph: cease then such calumnies: all your efforts are\r\n     in vain --you bite a file.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I am inclined to believe that if Louis Capet had been born\r\nin obscure condition, had he lived within the circle of an amiable and\r\nrespectable neighbourhood, at liberty to practice the duties of domestic\r\nlife, had he been thus situated, I cannot believe that he would have\r\nshewn himself destitute of social virtues: we are, in a moment of\r\nfermentation like this, naturally little indulgent to his vices, or\r\nrather to those of his government; we regard them with additional\r\nhorror and indignation; not that they are more heinous than those of\r\nhis predecessors, but because our eyes are now open, and the veil of\r\ndelusion at length withdrawn; yet the lamentable, degraded state to\r\nwhich he is actually reduced, is surely far less imputable to him\r\nthan to the Constituent Assembly, which, of its own authority, without\r\nconsent or advice of the people, restored him to the throne.\r\n\r\nI was in Paris at the time of the flight, or abdication of Louis XVI.,\r\nand when he was taken and brought back. The proposal of restoring him to\r\nsupreme power struck me with amazement; and although at that time I was\r\nnot a French citizen, yet as a citizen of the world I employed all the\r\nefforts that depended on me to prevent it.\r\n\r\nA small society, composed only of five persons, two of whom are\r\nnow members of the Convention,(1) took at that time the name of the\r\nRepublican Club (Société Républicaine). This society opposed the\r\nrestoration of Louis, not so much on account of his personal offences,\r\nas in order to overthrow the monarchy, and to erect on its ruins the\r\nrepublican system and an equal representation.\r\n\r\nWith this design, I traced out in the English language certain\r\npropositions, which were translated with some trifling alterations, and\r\nsigned by Achille Duchâtelet, now Lieutenant-General in the army of the\r\nFrench republic, and at that time one of the five members which composed\r\nour little party: the law requiring the signature of a citizen at the\r\nbottom of each printed paper.\r\n\r\n     1 Condorect and Paine; the other members were Achille\r\n     Duchitelet, and probably Nicolas de Bonneville and\r\n     Lanthenas,--translator of Paine's \"Works.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe paper was indignantly torn by Malouet; and brought forth in this\r\nvery room as an article of accusation against the person who had signed\r\nit, the author and their adherents; but such is the revolution of\r\nevents, that this paper is now received and brought forth for a very\r\nopposite purpose--to remind the nation of the errors of that unfortunate\r\nday, that fatal error of not having then banished Louis XVI. from its\r\nbosom, and to plead this day in favour of his exile, preferable to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe paper in question, was conceived in the following terms:\r\n\r\n[The address constitutes the first chapter of the present volume.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus explained the principles and the exertions of the\r\nrepublicans at that fatal period, when Louis was rein-stated in\r\nfull possession of the executive power which by his flight had been\r\nsuspended, I return to the subject, and to the deplorable situation in\r\nwhich the man is now actually involved.\r\n\r\nWhat was neglected at the time of which I have been speaking, has been\r\nsince brought about by the force of necessity. The wilful, treacherous\r\ndefects in the former constitution have been brought to light; the\r\ncontinual alarm of treason and conspiracy aroused the nation, and\r\nproduced eventually a second revolution. The people have beat down\r\nroyalty, never, never to rise again; they have brought Louis Capet to\r\nthe bar, and demonstrated in the face of the whole world, the intrigues,\r\nthe cabals, the falsehood, corruption, and rooted depravity, the\r\ninevitable effects of monarchical government. There remains then only\r\none question to be considered, what is to be done with this man?\r\n\r\nFor myself I seriously confess, that when I reflect on the unaccountable\r\nfolly that restored the executive power to his hands, all covered as\r\nhe was with perjuries and treason, I am far more ready to condemn the\r\nConstituent Assembly than the unfortunate prisoner Louis Capet.\r\n\r\nBut abstracted from every other consideration, there is one circumstance\r\nin his life which ought to cover or at least to palliate a great number\r\nof his transgressions, and this very circumstance affords to the French\r\nnation a blessed occasion of extricating itself from the yoke of kings,\r\nwithout defiling itself in the impurities of their blood.\r\n\r\nIt is to France alone, I know, that the United States of America owe\r\nthat support which enabled them to shake off the unjust and tyrannical\r\nyoke of Britain. The ardour and zeal which she displayed to provide both\r\nmen and money, were the natural consequence of a thirst for liberty.\r\nBut as the nation at that time, restrained by the shackles of her own\r\ngovernment, could only act by the means of a monarchical organ, this\r\norgan--whatever in other respects the object might be--certainly\r\nperformed a good, a great action.\r\n\r\nLet then those United States be the safeguard and asylum of Louis Capet.\r\nThere, hereafter, far removed from the miseries and crimes of royalty,\r\nhe may learn, from the constant aspect of public prosperity, that the\r\ntrue system of government consists not in kings, but in fair, equal, and\r\nhonourable representation.\r\n\r\nIn relating this circumstance, and in submitting this proposition, I\r\nconsider myself as a citizen of both countries. I submit it as a citizen\r\nof America, who feels the debt of gratitude which he owes to every\r\nFrenchman. I submit it also as a man, who, although the enemy of kings,\r\ncannot forget that they are subject to human frailties. I support my\r\nproposition as a citizen of the French republic, because it appears to\r\nme the best, the most politic measure that can be adopted.\r\n\r\nAs far as my experience in public life extends, I have ever observed,\r\nthat the great mass of the people are invariably just, both in their\r\nintentions and in their objects; but the true method of accomplishing an\r\neffect does not always shew itself in the first instance. For example:\r\nthe English nation had groaned under the despotism of the Stuarts.\r\nHence Charles I. lost his life; yet Charles II. was restored to all\r\nthe plenitude of power, which his father had lost. Forty years had\r\nnot expired when the same family strove to reestablish their ancient\r\noppression; so the nation then banished from its territories the whole\r\nrace. The remedy was effectual. The Stuart family sank into obscurity,\r\nconfounded itself with the multitude, and is at length extinct.\r\n\r\nThe French nation has carried her measures of government to a greater\r\nlength. France is not satisfied with exposing the guilt of the monarch.\r\nShe has penetrated into the vices and horrors of the monarchy. She has\r\nshown them clear as daylight, and forever crushed that system; and he,\r\nwhoever he may be, that should ever dare to reclaim those rights would\r\nbe regarded not as a pretender, but punished as a traitor.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers of Louis Capet have banished themselves from the country;\r\nbut they are obliged to comply with the spirit and etiquette of the\r\ncourts where they reside. They can advance no pretensions on their own\r\naccount, so long as Louis Capet shall live.\r\n\r\nMonarchy, in France, was a system pregnant with crime and murders,\r\ncancelling all natural ties, even those by which brothers are united. We\r\nknow how often they have assassinated each other to pave a way to power.\r\nAs those hopes which the emigrants had reposed in Louis XVI. are fled,\r\nthe last that remains rests upon his death, and their situation inclines\r\nthem to desire this catastrophe, that they may once again rally around\r\na more active chief, and try one further effort under the fortune of\r\nthe ci-devant Monsieur and d'Artois. That such an enterprize would\r\nprecipitate them into a new abyss of calamity and disgrace, it is not\r\ndifficult to foresee; yet it might be attended with mutual loss, and it\r\nis our duty as legislators not to spill a drop of blood when our purpose\r\nmay be effectually accomplished without it.\r\n\r\nIt has already been proposed to abolish the punishment of death, and it\r\nis with infinite satisfaction that I recollect the humane and excellent\r\noration pronounced by Robespierre on that subject in the Constituent\r\nAssembly. This cause must find its advocates in every corner where\r\nenlightened politicians and lovers of humanity exist, and it ought above\r\nall to find them in this assembly.\r\n\r\nMonarchical governments have trained the human race, and inured it to\r\nthe sanguinary arts and refinements of punishment; and it is exactly the\r\nsame punishment which has so long shocked the sight and tormented\r\nthe patience of the people, that now, in their turn, they practice in\r\nrevenge upon their oppressors. But it becomes us to be strictly on our\r\nguard against the abomination and perversity of monarchical examples:\r\nas France has been the first of European nations to abolish royalty, let\r\nher also be the first to abolish the punishment of death, and to find\r\nout a milder and more effectual substitute.\r\n\r\nIn the particular case now under consideration, I submit the following\r\npropositions: 1st, That the National Convention shall pronounce sentence\r\nof banishment on Louis and his family. 2d, That Louis Capet shall\r\nbe detained in prison till the end of the war, and at that epoch the\r\nsentence of banishment to be executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. SHALL LOUIS XVI. HAVE RESPITE?\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE CONVENTION, JANUARY 19, 1793.(1)\r\n\r\n(Read in French by Deputy Bancal,)\r\n\r\nVery sincerely do I regret the Convention's vote of yesterday for death.\r\n\r\nMarat [_interrupting_]: I submit that Thomas Paine is incompetent to\r\nvote on this question; being a Quaker his religious principles are\r\nopposed to capital punishment. [_Much confusion, quieted by cries for\r\n\"freedom of speech\" on which Bancal proceeds with Paine's speech_.]\r\n\r\n     1 Not included in any previous edition of Paine's \"Works.\"\r\n     It is here printed from contemporary French reports,\r\n     modified only by Paine's own quotations of a few sentences\r\n     in his Memorial to Monroe (xxi.).--_Editor._\r\n\r\nI have the advantage of some experience; it is near twenty years that I\r\nhave been engaged in the cause of liberty, having contributed something\r\nto it in the revolution of the United States of America, My language has\r\nalways been that of liberty _and_ humanity, and I know that nothing\r\nso exalts a nation as the union of these two principles, under all\r\ncircumstances. I know that the public mind of France, and particularly\r\nthat of Paris, has been heated and irritated by the dangers to which\r\nthey have been exposed; but could we carry our thoughts into the future,\r\nwhen the dangers are ended and the irritations forgotten, what\r\nto-day seems an act of justice may then appear an act of vengeance.\r\n[_Murmurs_.] My anxiety for the cause of France has become for the\r\nmoment concern for her honor. If, on my return to America, I should\r\nemploy myself on a history of the French Revolution, I had rather record\r\na thousand errors on the side of mercy, than be obliged to tell one act\r\nof severe justice. I voted against an appeal to the people, because it\r\nappeared to me that the Convention was needlessly wearied on that point;\r\nbut I so voted in the hope that this Assembly would pronounce against\r\ndeath, and for the same punishment that the nation would have voted,\r\nat least in my opinion, that is for reclusion during the war, and\r\nbanishment thereafter.(1) That is the punishment most efficacious,\r\nbecause it includes the whole family at once, and none other can so\r\noperate. I am still against the appeal to the primary assemblies,\r\nbecause there is a better method. This Convention has been elected to\r\nform a Constitution, which will be submitted to the primary assemblies.\r\nAfter its acceptance a necessary consequence will be an election and\r\nanother assembly. We cannot suppose that the present Convention will\r\nlast more than five or six months. The choice of new deputies will\r\nexpress the national opinion, on the propriety or impropriety of your\r\nsentence, with as much efficacy as if those primary assemblies had been\r\nconsulted on it. As the duration of our functions here cannot be long,\r\nit is a part of our duty to consider the interests of those who shall\r\nreplace us. If by any act of ours the number of the nation's enemies\r\nshall be needlessly increased, and that of its friends diminished,--at a\r\ntime when the finances may be more strained than to-day,--we should\r\nnot be justifiable for having thus unnecessarily heaped obstacles in\r\nthe path of our successors. Let us therefore not be precipitate in our\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n     1 It is possible that the course of the debate may have\r\n     produced some reaction among the people, but when Paine\r\n     voted against submitting the king's fate to the popular vote\r\n     it was believed by the king and his friends that it would be\r\n     fatal. The American Minister, Gouverneur Morris, who had\r\n     long been acting for the king, wrote to President\r\n     Washington, Jan. 6, 1793: \"The king's fate is to be decided\r\n     next Monday, the 14th. That unhappy man, conversing with one\r\n     of his Council on his own fate, calmly summed up the motives\r\n     of every kind, and concluded that a majority of the Council\r\n     would vote for referring his case to the people, and that in\r\n     consequence he should be massacred.\" Writing to Washington\r\n     on Dec. 28, 1792, Morris mentions having heard from Paine\r\n     that he was to move the king's banishment to America, and he\r\n     may then have informed Paine that the king believed\r\n     reference of his case to popular vote would be fatal.\r\n     Genet was to have conducted the royal family to America.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nFrance has but one ally--the United States of America. That is the only\r\nnation that can furnish France with naval provisions, for the\r\nkingdoms of northern Europe are, or soon will be, at war with her. It\r\nunfortunately happens that the person now under discussion is considered\r\nby the Americans as having been the friend of their revolution. His\r\nexecution will be an affliction to them, and it is in your power not\r\nto wound the feelings of your ally. Could I speak the French language I\r\nwould descend to your bar, and in their name become your petitioner to\r\nrespite the execution of the sentence on Louis.\r\n\r\nThuriot: This is not the language of Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nMarat: I denounce the interpreter. I maintain that it is not Thomas\r\nPaine's opinion. It is an untrue translation.\r\n\r\nGarran: I have read the original, and the translation is correct.(1)\r\n\r\n[_Prolonged uproar. Paine, still standing in the tribune beside his\r\ninterpreter, Deputy Bancal, declared the sentiments to be his._]\r\n\r\nYour Executive Committee will nominate an ambassador to Philadelphia;\r\nmy sincere wish is that he may announce to America that the National\r\nConvention of France, out of pure friendship to America, has consented\r\nto respite Louis. That people, by my vote, ask you to delay the\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nAh, citizens, give not the tyrant of England the triumph of seeing the\r\nman perish on the scaffold who had aided my much-loved America to break\r\nhis chains!\r\n\r\nMarat [\"_launching himself into the middle of the hall_\"]: Paine voted\r\nagainst the punishment of death because he is a Quaker.\r\n\r\nPaine: I voted against it from both moral motives and motives of public\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n     1 See Guizot, \"Hist, of France,\" vi., p. 136. \"Hist.\r\n     Parliamentair,\" vol. ii., p. 350. Louis Blanc says that\r\n     Paine's appeal was so effective that Marat interrupted\r\n     mainly in order to destroy its effect.--\"Hist, de la Rev.,\"\r\n     tome vii, 396.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.(1)\r\n\r\nThe object of all union of men in society being maintenance of their\r\nnatural rights, civil and political, these rights are the basis of the\r\nsocial pact: their recognition and their declaration ought to precede\r\nthe Constitution which assures their guarantee.\r\n\r\n1. The natural rights of men, civil and political, are liberty,\r\nequality, security, property, social protection, and resistance to\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n2. Liberty consists in the right to do whatever is not contrary to\r\nthe rights of others: thus, exercise of the natural rights of each\r\nindividual has no limits other than those which secure to other members\r\nof society enjoyment of the same rights.\r\n\r\n     1 In his appeal from prison to the Convention (August 7,\r\n     1794) Paine states that he had, as a member of the Committee\r\n     for framing the Constitution, prepared a Plan, which was in\r\n     the hands of Barère, also of that Committee. I have not yet\r\n     succeeded in finding Paine's Constitution, but it is certain\r\n     that the work of framing the Constitution of 1793 was mainly\r\n     entrusted to Paine and Condorcet.\r\n\r\n     Dr. John Moore, in his work on the French Revolution,\r\n     describes the two at their work; and it is asserted that he\r\n     \"assisted in drawing up the French Declaration of Rights,\"\r\n     by \"Juvencus,\" author of an able \"Essay on the Life and\r\n     Genius of Thomas Paine,\" whose information came from a\r\n     personal friend of Paine. (\"Aphorisms, Opinions, and\r\n     Reflections of Thomas Paine,\" etc., London, 1826. Pp. 3,\r\n     14.) A translation of the Declaration and Constitution\r\n     appeared in England (Debrett, Picadilly, 1793), but with\r\n     some faults. The present translation is from \"Oeuvres\r\n     Complètes de Condorcet,\" tome xviii. The Committee reported\r\n     their Constitution February 15th, and April 15th was set for\r\n     its discussion, Robespierre then demanded separate\r\n     discussion of the Declaration of Rights, to which he\r\n     objected that it made no mention of the Supreme Being, and\r\n     that its extreme principles of freedom would shield illicit\r\n     traffic. Paine and Jefferson were troubled that the United\r\n     States Constitution contained no Declaration of Rights, it\r\n     being a fundamental principle in Paine's theory of\r\n     government that such a Declaration was the main safeguard of\r\n     the individual against the despotism of numbers.    See\r\n     supra, vol. ii.t pp. 138, 139.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n3. The preservation of liberty depends on submission to the Law, which\r\nis the expression of the general will. Nothing unforbidden by law can be\r\nhindered, and none may be forced to do what the law does not command.\r\n\r\n4. Every man is free to make known his thoughts and opinions.\r\n\r\n5. Freedom of the press, and every other means of publishing one's\r\nopinion, cannot be interdicted, suspended, or limited.\r\n\r\n6. Every citizen shall be free in the exercise of his religion\r\n(_culte_).\r\n\r\n7. Equality consists in the enjoyment by every one of the same rights.\r\n\r\n8. The law should be equal for all, whether it rewards or punishes,\r\nprotects or represses.\r\n\r\n9. All citizens are admissible to all public positions, employments, and\r\nfunctions. Free nations recognize no grounds of preference save talents\r\nand virtues.\r\n\r\n10. Security consists in the protection accorded by society to every\r\ncitizen for the preservation of his person, property, and rights.\r\n\r\n11. None should be sued, accused, arrested, or detained, save in cases\r\ndetermined by the law, and in accordance with forms prescribed by it.\r\nEvery other act against a citizen is arbitrary and null.\r\n\r\n12. Those who solicit, further, sign, execute, or cause to be executed,\r\nsuch arbitrary acts are culpable, and should be punished.\r\n\r\n13. Citizens against whom the execution of such acts is attempted\r\nhave the right to repel force by force; but every citizen summoned or\r\narrested by authority of the Law, and in the forms by it prescribed,\r\nshould instantly obey: he renders himself guilty by resistance.\r\n\r\n14. Every man being presumed innocent until legally pronounced guilty,\r\nshould his arrest be deemed indispensable, all rigor not necessary to\r\nsecure his person should be severely represssed by law.\r\n\r\n15. None should be punished save in virtue of a law formally enacted,\r\npromulgated anterior to the offence, and legally applied.\r\n\r\n16. Any law that should punish offences committed before its existence\r\nwould be an arbitrary act. Retroactive effect given to the law is a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n17. The law should award only penalties strictly and evidently necessary\r\nto the general safety. Penalties should be proportioned to offences, and\r\nuseful to society.\r\n\r\n18. The right of property consists in every man's being master in the\r\ndisposal, at his will, of his goods, capital, income, and industry.\r\n\r\n19. No kind of labor, commerce, or culture, can be prohibited to any\r\none: he may make, sell, and transport every species of production.\r\n\r\n20. Every man may engage his services and his time; but he cannot sell\r\nhimself; his person is not an alienable property.\r\n\r\n21. No one can be deprived of the least portion of his property without\r\nhis consent, unless evidently required by public necessity, legally\r\ndetermined, and under the condition of a just indemnity in advance.\r\n\r\n22. No tax shall be imposed except for the general welfare, and to meet\r\npublic needs. All citizens have the right to unite personally, or by\r\ntheir representatives, in the fixing of imposts.\r\n\r\n23. Instruction is the need of all, and society owes it to all its\r\nmembers equally.\r\n\r\n24. Public succours are a sacred debt of society; it is for the law to\r\ndetermine their extent and application.\r\n\r\n25. The social guarantee of the rights of man rests on the national\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n26. This sovereignty is one, indivisible, imprescriptible, and\r\ninalienable.\r\n\r\n27. It resides essentially in the whole people, and every citizen has an\r\nequal right to unite in its exercise.\r\n\r\n28. No partial assemblage of citizens, and no individual, may attribute\r\nto themselves sovereignty, or exercise any authority, or discharge any\r\npublic function, without formal delegation thereto by the law.\r\n\r\n29. The social guarantee cannot exist if the limits of public\r\nadministration are not clearly determined by law, and if the\r\nresponsibility of all public functionaries is not assured.\r\n\r\n30. All citizens are bound to unite in this guarantee, and in enforcing\r\nthe law when summoned in its name.\r\n\r\n31. Men united in society should have legal means of resisting\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n32. There is oppression when any law violates the natural rights, civil\r\nand political, which it should guarantee.\r\n\r\nThere is oppression when the law is violated by public officials in its\r\napplication to individual cases.\r\n\r\nThere is oppression when arbitrary actions violate the rights of citizen\r\nagainst the express purpose (_expression_) of the law.\r\n\r\nIn a free government the mode of resisting these different acts of\r\noppression should be regulated by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n33. A people possesses always the right to reform and alter its\r\nConstitution. A generation has no right to subject a future generation\r\nto its laws; and all heredity in offices is absurd and tyrannical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. PRIVATE LETTERS TO JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, 20 April, 1793.\r\n\r\nMy dear Friend,--The gentleman (Dr. Romer) to whom I entrust this\r\nletter is an intimate acquaintance of Lavater; but I have not had the\r\nopportunity of seeing him, as he had set off for Havre prior to my\r\nwriting this letter, which I forward to him under cover from one of his\r\nfriends, who is also an acquaintance of mine.\r\n\r\nWe are now in an extraordinary crisis, and it is not altogether without\r\nsome considerable faults here. Dumouriez, partly from having no fixed\r\nprinciples of his own, and partly from the continual persecution of the\r\nJacobins, who act without either prudence or morality, has gone off\r\nto the Enemy, and taken a considerable part of the Army with him. The\r\nexpedition to Holland has totally failed, and all Brabant is again in\r\nthe hands of the Austrians.\r\n\r\nYou may suppose the consternation which such a sudden reverse of fortune\r\nhas occasioned, but it has been without commotion. Dumouriez threatened\r\nto be in Paris in three weeks. It is now three weeks ago; he is still on\r\nthe frontier near to Mons with the Enemy, who do not make any progress.\r\nDumouriez has proposed to re-establish the former Constitution in\r\nwhich plan the Austrians act with him. But if France and the National\r\nConvention act prudently this project will not succeed. In the first\r\nplace there is a popular disposition against it, and there is force\r\nsufficient to prevent it. In the next place, a great deal is to be taken\r\ninto the calculation with respect to the Enemy. There are now so many\r\npersons accidentally jumbled together as to render it exceedingly\r\ndifficult to them to agree upon any common object.\r\n\r\nThe first object, that of restoring the old Monarchy, is evidently given\r\nup by the proposal to re-establish the late Constitution. The object of\r\nEngland and Prussia was to preserve Holland, and the object of Austria\r\nwas to recover Brabant; while those separate objects lasted, each party\r\nhaving one, the Confederation could hold together, each helping the\r\nother; but after this I see not how a common object is to be formed.\r\nTo all this is to be added the probable disputes about opportunity,\r\nthe expence, and the projects of reimbursements. The Enemy has once\r\nadventured into France, and they had the permission or the good fortune\r\nto get back again. On every military calculation it is a hazardous\r\nadventure, and armies are not much disposed to try a second time the\r\nground upon which they have been defeated.\r\n\r\nHad this revolution been conducted consistently with its principles,\r\nthere was once a good prospect of extending liberty through the greatest\r\npart of Europe; but I now relinquish that hope. Should the Enemy by\r\nventuring into France put themselves again in a condition of being\r\ncaptured, the hope will revive; but this is a risk I do not wish to see\r\ntried, lest it should fail.\r\n\r\nAs the prospect of a general freedom is now much shortened, I begin\r\nto contemplate returning home. I shall await the event of the proposed\r\nConstitution, and then take my final leave of Europe. I have not written\r\nto the President, as I have nothing to communicate more than in this\r\nletter. Please to present him my affection and compliments, and remember\r\nme among the circle of my friends.\r\n\r\nYour sincere and affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nP. S. I just now received a letter from General Lewis Morris, who tells\r\nme that the house and Barn on my farm at New Rochelle are burnt down. I\r\nassure you I shall not bring money enough to build another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, 20 Oct., 1793.\r\n\r\nI wrote you by Captain Dominick who was to sail from Havre about the\r\n20th of this month. This will probably be brought you by Mr. Barlow or\r\nCol. Oswald. Since my letter by Dominick I am every day more convinced\r\nand impressed with the propriety of Congress sending Commissioners to\r\nEurope to confer with the Ministers of the Jesuitical Powers on the\r\nmeans of terminating the War. The enclosed printed paper will shew there\r\nare a variety of subjects to be taken into consideration which did not\r\nappear at first, all of which have some tendency to put an end to the\r\nWar. I see not how this War is to terminate if some intermediate power\r\ndoes not step forward. There is now no prospect that France can carry\r\nrevolutions into Europe on the one hand, or that the combined powers can\r\nconquer France on the other hand. It is a sort of defensive War on both\r\nsides. This being the case, how is the War to close? Neither side\r\nwill ask for peace though each may wish it. I believe that England\r\nand Holland are tired of the War. Their Commerce and Manufactures have\r\nsuffered most exceedingly,--besides this, it is for them a War without\r\nan object. Russia keeps herself at a distance.\r\n\r\nI cannot help repeating my wish that Congress would send Commissioners,\r\nand I wish also that yourself would venture once more across the ocean,\r\nas one of them. If the Commissioners rendezvous at Holland they would\r\nknow what steps to take. They could call Mr. Pinckney [Gen. Thomas\r\nPinckney, American Minister in England] to their councils, and it would\r\nbe of use, on many accounts, that one of them should come over from\r\nHolland to France. Perhaps a long truce, were it proposed by the neutral\r\npowers, would have all the effects of a Peace, without the difficulties\r\nattending the adjustment of all the forms of Peace.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. LETTER TO DANTON.(1)\r\n\r\nParis, May 6, 2nd year of the Republic [1793.]\r\n\r\nCitoyen Danton: As you read English, I write this letter to you without\r\npassing it through the hands of a translator. I am exceedingly disturbed\r\nat the distractions, jealousies, discontents and uneasiness that reign\r\namong us, and which, if they continue, will bring ruin and disgrace on\r\nthe Republic. When I left America in the year 1787, it was my intention\r\nto return the year following, but the French Revolution, and the\r\nprospect it afforded of extending the principles of liberty and\r\nfraternity through the greater part of Europe, have induced me to\r\nprolong my stay upwards of six years. I now despair of seeing the great\r\nobject of European liberty accomplished, and my despair arises not from\r\nthe combined foreign powers, not from the intrigues of aristocracy and\r\npriestcraft, but from the tumultuous misconduct with which the internal\r\naffairs of the present revolution are conducted.\r\n\r\nAll that now can be hoped for is limited to France only, and I agree\r\nwith your motion of not interfering in the government of any foreign\r\ncountry, nor permitting any foreign country to interfere in the\r\ngovernment of France. This decree was necessary as a preliminary toward\r\nterminating the war. But while these internal contentions continue,\r\nwhile the hope remains to the enemy of seeing the Republic fall to\r\npieces, while not only the representatives of the departments but\r\nrepresentation itself is publicly insulted, as it has lately been and\r\nnow is by the people of Paris, or at least by the tribunes, the enemy\r\nwill be encouraged to hang about the frontiers and await the issue of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n     1 This admirable letter was brought to light by the late M.\r\n     Taine, and first published in full by Taine's translator,\r\n     John Durand (\"New Materials for the History of the American\r\n     Revolution,\" 1889). The letter to Marat mentioned by Paine\r\n     has not been discovered. Danton followed Paine to prison,\r\n     and on meeting him there said: \"That which you did for the\r\n     happiness and liberty of your country I tried to do for\r\n     mine. I have been less fortunate, but not less innocent.\r\n     They will send me to the scaffold; very well, my friend, I\r\n     will go gaily.\" M. Taine in La Révolution (vol. ii., pp.\r\n     382, 413, 414) refers to this letter of Paine, and says:\r\n     \"Compared with the speeches and writings of the time, it\r\n     produces the strangest effect by its practical good sense.\"\r\n     --_Editor._,\r\n\r\nI observe that the confederated powers have not yet recognized Monsieur,\r\nor D'Artois, as regent, nor made any proclamation in favour of any\r\nof the Bourbons; but this negative conduct admits of two different\r\nconclusions. The one is that of abandoning the Bourbons and the war\r\ntogether; the other is that of changing the object of the war and\r\nsubstituting a partition scheme in the place of their first object, as\r\nthey have done by Poland. If this should be their object, the internal\r\ncontentions that now rage will favour that object far more than it\r\nfavoured their former object. The danger every day increases of a\r\nrupture between Paris and the departments. The departments did not send\r\ntheir deputies to Paris to be insulted, and every insult shown to them\r\nis an insult to the departments that elected and sent them. I see but\r\none effectual plan to prevent this rupture taking place, and that is to\r\nfix the residence of the Convention, and of the future assemblies, at a\r\ndistance from Paris.\r\n\r\nI saw, during the American Revolution, the exceeding inconvenience that\r\narose by having the government of Congress within the limits of any\r\nMunicipal Jurisdiction. Congress first resided in Philadelphia, and\r\nafter a residence of four years it found it necessary to leave it. It\r\nthen adjourned to the State of Jersey. It afterwards removed to\r\nNew York; it again removed from New York to Philadelphia, and after\r\nexperiencing in every one of these places the great inconvenience of\r\na government, it formed the project of building a Town, not within\r\nthe limits of any municipal jurisdiction, for the future residence of\r\nCongress. In any one of the places where Congress resided, the municipal\r\nauthority privately or openly opposed itself to the authority of\r\nCongress, and the people of each of these places expected more attention\r\nfrom Congress than their equal share with the other States amounted to.\r\nThe same thing now takes place in France, but in a far greater excess.\r\n\r\nI see also another embarrassing circumstance arising in Paris of which\r\nwe have had full experience in America. I mean that of fixing the price\r\nof provisions. But if this measure is to be attempted it ought to\r\nbe done by the Municipality. The Convention has nothing to do with\r\nregulations of this kind; neither can they be carried into practice. The\r\npeople of Paris may say they will not give more than a certain price\r\nfor provisions, but as they cannot compel the country people to bring\r\nprovisions to market the consequence will be directly contrary to their\r\nexpectations, and they will find dearness and famine instead of plenty\r\nand cheapness. They may force the price down upon the stock in hand, but\r\nafter that the market will be empty.\r\n\r\nI will give you an example. In Philadelphia we undertook, among other\r\nregulations of this kind, to regulate the price of Salt; the consequence\r\nwas that no Salt was brought to market, and the price rose to thirty-six\r\nshillings sterling per Bushel. The price before the war was only one\r\nshilling and sixpence per Bushel; and we regulated the price of flour\r\n(farina) till there was none in the market, and the people were glad to\r\nprocure it at any price.\r\n\r\nThere is also a circumstance to be taken into the account which is not\r\nmuch attended to. The assignats are not of the same value they were a\r\nyear ago, and as the quantity increases the value of them will diminish.\r\nThis gives the appearance of things being dear when they are not so in\r\nfact, for in the same proportion that any kind of money falls in\r\nvalue articles rise in price. If it were not for this the quantity of\r\nassignats would be too great to be circulated. Paper money in America\r\nfell so much in value from this excessive quantity of it, that in the\r\nyear 1781 I gave three hundred paper dollars for one pair of worsted\r\nstockings. What I write you upon this subject is experience, and not\r\nmerely opinion. I have no personal interest in any of these matters, nor\r\nin any party disputes. I attend only to general principles.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a constitution shall be established I shall return to\r\nAmerica; and be the future prosperity of France ever so great, I shall\r\nenjoy no other part of it than the happiness of knowing it. In the mean\r\ntime I am distressed to see matters so badly conducted, and so little\r\nattention paid to moral principles. It is these things that injure the\r\ncharacter of the Revolution and discourage the progress of liberty all\r\nover the world. When I began this letter I did not intend making it so\r\nlengthy, but since I have gone thus far I will fill up the remainder of\r\nthe sheet with such matters as occur to me.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be some regulation with respect to the spirit of\r\ndenunciation that now prevails. If every individual is to indulge his\r\nprivate malignancy or his private ambition, to denounce at random and\r\nwithout any kind of proof, all confidence will be undermined and all\r\nauthority be destroyed. Calumny is a species of Treachery that ought to\r\nbe punished as well as any other kind of Treachery. It is a private vice\r\nproductive of public evils; because it is possible to irritate men into\r\ndisaffection by continual calumny who never intended to be disaffected.\r\nIt is therefore, equally as necessary to guard against the evils\r\nof unfounded or malignant suspicion as against the evils of blind\r\nconfidence. It is equally as necessary to protect the characters of\r\npublic officers from calumny as it is to punish them for treachery or\r\nmisconduct. For my own part I shall hold it a matter of doubt, until\r\nbetter evidence arises than is known at present, whether Dumouriez has\r\nbeen a traitor from policy or resentment. There was certainly a time\r\nwhen he acted well, but it is not every man whose mind is strong enough\r\nto bear up against ingratitude, and I think he experienced a great deal\r\nof this before he revolted. Calumny becomes harmless and defeats itself,\r\nwhen it attempts to act upon too large a scale. Thus the denunciation\r\nof the Sections [of Paris] against the twenty-two deputies [Girondists]\r\nfalls to the ground. The departments that elected them are better judges\r\nof their moral and political characters than those who have denounced\r\nthem. This denunciation will injure Paris in the opinion of the\r\ndepartments because it has the appearance of dictating to them what sort\r\nof deputies they shall elect. Most of the acquaintances that I have in\r\nthe Convention are among those who are in that list, and I know there\r\nare not better men nor better patriots than what they are.\r\n\r\nI have written a letter to Marat of the same date as this but not on the\r\nsame subject. He may show it to you if he chuse.\r\n\r\nVotre Ami,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nCitoyen Danton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. A CITIZEN OF AMERICA TO THE CITIZENS OF EUROPE (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n18th Year of Independence.\r\n\r\n     1 State Archives, Paris: États Unis, vol. 38, fol. 90. This\r\n     pamphlet is in English, without indication of authorship or\r\n     of the place of publication. It is accompanied by a French\r\n     translation (MS.) inscribed \"Par Thomas Payne.\" In the\r\n     printed pamphlet the date (18th Year, etc) is preceded by\r\n     the French words (printed): \"Philadelphie 28 Juillet 1793.\"\r\n     It was no doubt the pamphlet sent by Paine to Monroe, with\r\n     various documents relating to his imprisonment, describing\r\n     it as \"a Letter which I had printed here as an American\r\n     letter, some copies of which I sent to Mr. Jefferson.\" A\r\n     considerable portion of the pamphlet embodies, with\r\n     occasional changes of phraseology, a manuscript (États Unis,\r\n     vol. 37, Do. 39) endorsed: \"January 1793. Thorn. Payne.\r\n     Copie. Observations on the situation of the Powers joined\r\n     against France.\" This opens with the following paragraph:\r\n     \"It is always useful to know the position and the designs of\r\n     one's enemies. It is much easier to do so by combining and\r\n     comparing the events, and by examining the consequences\r\n     which result from them, than by forming one's judgment by\r\n     letters found or intercepted. These letters could be\r\n     fabricated with the intention of deceiving, but events or\r\n     circumstances have a character which is proper to them. If\r\n     in the course of our political operations we mistake the\r\n     designs of our enemy, it leads us to do precisely that which\r\n     he desires we should do, and it happens by the fact, but\r\n     against our intentions, that we work for him.\" That the date\r\n     written on this MS. is erroneous appears by an allusion to\r\n     the defeat of the Duke of York at Dunkirk in the closing\r\n     paragraph: \"There are three distinct parties in England at\r\n     this moment: the government party, the revolutionary party,\r\n     and an intermedial party,--which is only opposed to the war\r\n     on account of the expense it entails, and the harm it does\r\n     commerce and manufactures. I am speaking of the People, and\r\n     not of the Parliament. The latter is divided into two\r\n     parties: the Ministerial, and the Anti-ministerial. The\r\n     revolutionary party, the intermedial party, and the anti-\r\n     ministerial party, will all rejoice, publicly or privately,\r\n     at the defeat of the Duke of York at Dunkirk.\"   The two\r\n     paragraphs quoted represent the only actual additions to the\r\n     pamphlet. I have a clipping from the London Morning\r\n     Chronicle of Friday, April 25, 1794, containing the part of\r\n     the pamphlet headed \"Of the present state of Europe and the\r\n     Confederacy,\" signed \"Thomas Paine, Author of Common Sense,\r\n     etc.\" On February 1,1793, the Convention having declared\r\n     war, appointed Paine, Barère, Condorcet and Faber, a\r\n     Committee to draft an address to the English people. It was\r\n     never done, but these fragments may represent notes written\r\n     by Paine with reference to that task.   The pamphlet\r\n     probably appeared late in September, 1793.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that a proposal is intended to be made at the ensuing\r\nmeeting of the Congress of the United States of America \"to send\r\ncommissioners to Europe to confer with the Ministers of all the Neutral\r\nPowers for the purpose of negotiating preliminaries of peace,\" I address\r\nthis letter to you on that subject, and on the several matters connected\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nIn order to discuss this subject through all its circumstances, it\r\nwill be necessary to take a review of the state of Europe, prior to the\r\nFrench revolution. It will from thence appear, that the powers leagued\r\nagainst France are fighting to attain an object, which, were it possible\r\nto be attained, would be injurious to themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is not an uncommon error in the history of wars and governments, of\r\nwhich the conduct of the English government in the war against America\r\nis a striking instance. She commenced that war for the avowed purpose of\r\nsubjugating America; and after wasting upwards of one hundred millions\r\nsterling, and then abandoning the object, she discovered, in the course\r\nof three or four years, that the prosperity of England was increased,\r\ninstead of being diminished, by the independence of America. In short,\r\nevery circumstance is pregnant with some natural effect, upon which\r\nintentions and opinions have no influence; and the political error\r\nlies in misjudging what the effect will be. England misjudged it in\r\nthe American war, and the reasons I shall now offer will shew, that she\r\nmisjudges it in the present war. In discussing this subject, I leave out\r\nof the question everything respecting forms and systems of government;\r\nfor as all the governments of Europe differ from each other, there is no\r\nreason that the government of France should not differ from the rest.\r\n\r\nThe clamours continually raised in all the countries of Europe were,\r\nthat the family of the Bourbons was become too powerful; that the\r\nintrigues of the court of France endangered the peace of Europe. Austria\r\nsaw with a jealous eye the connection of France with Prussia; and\r\nPrussia, in her turn became jealous of the connection of France with\r\nAustria; England had wasted millions unsuccessfully in attempting to\r\nprevent the family compact with Spain; Russia disliked the alliance\r\nbetween France and Turkey; and Turkey became apprehensive of the\r\ninclination of France towards an alliance with Russia. Sometimes the\r\nquadruple alliance alarmed some of the powers, and at other times a\r\ncontrary system alarmed others, and in all those cases the charge was\r\nalways made against the intrigues of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nAdmitting those matters to be true, the only thing that could have\r\nquieted the apprehensions of all those powers with respect to the\r\ninterference of France, would have been her entire NEUTRALITY in Europe;\r\nbut this was impossible to be obtained, or if obtained was impossible\r\nto be secured, because the genius of her government was repugnant to all\r\nsuch restrictions.\r\n\r\nIt now happens that by entirely changing the genius of her government,\r\nwhich France has done for herself, this neutrality, which neither wars\r\ncould accomplish nor treaties secure, arises naturally of itself, and\r\nbecomes the ground upon which the war should terminate. It is the\r\nthing that approaches the nearest of all others to what ought to be the\r\npolitical views of all the European powers; and there is nothing that\r\ncan so effectually secure this neutrality, as that the genius of the\r\nFrench government should be different from the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut if their object is to restore the Bourbons and monarchy together,\r\nthey will unavoidably restore with it all the evils of which they have\r\ncomplained; and the first question of discord will be, whose ally is\r\nthat monarchy to be?\r\n\r\nWill England agree to the restoration of the family compact against\r\nwhich she has been fighting and scheming ever since it existed? Will\r\nPrussia agree to restore the alliance between France and Austria, or\r\nwill Austria agree to restore the former connection between France and\r\nPrussia, formed on purpose to oppose herself; or will Spain or Russia,\r\nor any of the maritime powers, agree that France and her navy should be\r\nallied to England? In fine, will any of the powers agree to strengthen\r\nthe hands of the other against itself? Yet all these cases involve\r\nthemselves in the original question of the restoration of the Bourbons;\r\nand on the other hand, all of them disappear by the neutrality of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIf their object is not to restore the Bourbons, it must be the\r\nimpracticable project of a partition of the country. The Bourbons will\r\nthen be out of the question, or, more properly speaking, they will be\r\nput in a worse condition; for as the preservation of the Bourbons made\r\na part of the first object, the extirpation of them makes a part of the\r\nsecond. Their pretended friends will then become interested in their\r\ndestruction, because it is favourable to the purpose of partition that\r\nnone of the nominal claimants should be left in existence.\r\n\r\nBut however the project of a partition may at first blind the eyes of\r\nthe confederacy, or however each of them may hope to outwit the other\r\nin the progress or in the end, the embarrassments that will arise are\r\ninsurmountable. But even were the object attainable, it would not be of\r\nsuch general advantage to the parties as the neutrality of France, which\r\ncosts them nothing, and to obtain which they would formerly have gone to\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PRESENT STATE OF EUROPE, AND THE CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the confederacy is not of that kind that forms\r\nitself originally by concert and consent. It has been forced together by\r\nchance--a heterogeneous mass, held only by the accident of the moment;\r\nand the instant that accident ceases to operate, the parties will retire\r\nto their former rivalships.\r\n\r\nI will now, independently of the impracticability of a partition\r\nproject, trace out some of the embarrassments which will arise among the\r\nconfederated parties; for it is contrary to the interest of a majority\r\nof them that such a project should succeed.\r\n\r\nTo understand this part of the subject it is necessary, in the\r\nfirst place, to cast an eye over the map of Europe, and observe the\r\ngeographical situation of the several parts of the confederacy; for\r\nhowever strongly the passionate politics of the moment may operate, the\r\npolitics that arise from geographical situation are the most certain,\r\nand will in all cases finally prevail.\r\n\r\nThe world has been long amused with what is called the \"_balance of\r\npower_.\" But it is not upon armies only that this balance depends.\r\nArmies have but a small circle of action. Their progress is slow and\r\nlimited. But when we take maritime power into the calculation, the scale\r\nextends universally. It comprehends all the interests connected with\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe two great maritime powers are England and France. Destroy either of\r\nthose, and the balance of naval power is destroyed. The whole world of\r\ncommerce that passes on the Ocean would then lie at the mercy of the\r\nother, and the ports of any nation in Europe might be blocked up.\r\n\r\nThe geographical situation of those two maritime powers comes next under\r\nconsideration. Each of them occupies one entire side of the channel from\r\nthe straits of Dover and Calais to the opening into the Atlantic. The\r\ncommerce of all the northern nations, from Holland to Russia, must pass\r\nthe straits of Dover and Calais, and along the Channel, to arrive at the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, the systematical politics of all the nations,\r\nnorthward of the straits of Dover and Calais, can be ascertained from\r\ntheir geographical situation; for it is necessary to the safety of their\r\ncommerce that the two sides of the Channel, either in whole or in part,\r\nshould not be in the possession either of England or France. While one\r\nnation possesses the whole of one side, and the other nation the other\r\nside, the northern nations cannot help seeing that in any situation of\r\nthings their commerce will always find protection on one side or the\r\nother. It may sometimes be that of England and sometimes that of France.\r\n\r\nAgain, while the English navy continues in its present condition, it is\r\nnecessary that another navy should exist to controul the universal sway\r\nthe former would otherwise have over the commerce of all nations. France\r\nis the only nation in Europe where this balance can be placed. The\r\nnavies of the North, were they sufficiently powerful, could not be\r\nsufficiently operative. They are blocked up by the ice six months in the\r\nyear. Spain lies too remote; besides which, it is only for the sake of\r\nher American mines that she keeps up her navy.\r\n\r\nApplying these cases to the project of a partition of France, it will\r\nappear, that the project involves with it a DESTRUCTION OF THE BALANCE\r\nOF MARITIME POWER; because it is only by keeping France entire and\r\nindivisible that the balance can be kept up. This is a case that at\r\nfirst sight lies remote and almost hidden. But it interests all the\r\nmaritime and commercial nations in Europe in as great a degree as any\r\ncase that has ever come before them.--In short, it is with war as it\r\nis with law. In law, the first merits of the case become lost in the\r\nmultitude of arguments; and in war they become lost in the variety of\r\nevents. New objects arise that take the lead of all that went before,\r\nand everything assumes a new aspect. This was the case in the last great\r\nconfederacy in what is called the succession war, and most probably will\r\nbe the case in the present.\r\n\r\nI have now thrown together such thoughts as occurred to me on the\r\nseveral subjects connected with the confederacy against France, and\r\ninterwoven with the interest of the neutral powers. Should a conference\r\nof the neutral powers take place, these observations will, at least,\r\nserve to generate others. The whole matter will then undergo a more\r\nextensive investigation than it is in my power to give; and the evils\r\nattending upon either of the projects, that of restoring the Bourbons,\r\nor of attempting a partition of France, will have the calm opportunity\r\nof being fully discussed.\r\n\r\nOn the part of England, it is very extraordinary that she should have\r\nengaged in a former confederacy, and a long expensive war, to _prevent_\r\nthe family compact, and now engage in another confederacy to _preserve_\r\nit. And on the part of the other powers, it is as inconsistent that they\r\nshould engage in a partition project, which, could it be executed, would\r\nimmediately destroy the balance of maritime power in Europe, and would\r\nprobably produce a second war, to remedy the political errors of the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nA Citizen of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. APPEAL TO THE CONVENTION.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens Representatives: If I should not express myself with the energy\r\nI used formerly to do, you will attribute it to the very dangerous\r\nillness I have suffered in the prison of the Luxembourg. For several\r\ndays I was insensible of my own existence; and though I am much\r\nrecovered, it is with exceeding great difficulty that I find power to\r\nwrite you this letter.\r\n\r\n     1 Written in Luxembourg prison, August 7, 1794. Robespierre\r\n     having fallen July 29th, those who had been imprisoned under\r\n     his authority were nearly all at once released, but Paine\r\n     remained. There were still three conspirators against him on\r\n     the Committee of Public Safety, and to that Committee this\r\n     appeal was unfortunately confided; consequently it never\r\n     reached the Convention. The circumstances are related at\r\n     length infra, in the introduction to the Memorial to Monroe\r\n     (XXI.). It will also be seen that Paine was mistaken in his\r\n     belief that his imprisonment was due to the enmity of\r\n     Robespierre, and this he vaguely suspected when his\r\n     imprisonment was prolonged three months after Robespierre's\r\n     death.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut before I proceed further, I request the Convention to observe: that\r\nthis is the first line that has come from me, either to the Convention\r\nor to any of the Committees, since my imprisonment,--which is\r\napproaching to eight months. --Ah, my friends, eight months' loss of\r\nliberty seems almost a life-time to a man who has been, as I have been,\r\nthe unceasing defender of Liberty for twenty years.\r\n\r\nI have now to inform the Convention of the reason of my not having\r\nwritten before. It is a year ago that I had strong reason to believe\r\nthat Robespierre was my inveterate enemy, as he was the enemy of every\r\nman of virtue and humanity. The address that was sent to the Convention\r\nsome time about last August from Arras, the native town of Robespierre,\r\nI have always been informed was the work of that hypocrite and the\r\npartizans he had in the place. The intention of that address was to\r\nprepare the way for destroying me, by making the people declare (though\r\nwithout assigning any reason) that I had lost their confidence; the\r\nAddress, however, failed of success, as it was immediately opposed by a\r\ncounter-address from St. Omer, which declared the direct contrary. But\r\nthe strange power that Robespierre, by the most consummate hypocrisy and\r\nthe most hardened cruelties, had obtained, rendered any attempt on my\r\npart to obtain justice not only useless but dangerous; for it is the\r\nnature of Tyranny always to strike a deeper blow when any attempt has\r\nbeen made to repel a former one. This being my situation, I submitted\r\nwith patience to the hardness of my fate and waited the event of\r\nbrighter days. I hope they are now arrived to the nation and to me.\r\n\r\nCitizens, when I left the United States in the year 1787 I promised to\r\nall my friends that I would return to them the next year; but the hope\r\nof seeing a revolution happily established in France, that might serve\r\nas a model to the rest of Europe,(1) and the earnest and disinterested\r\ndesire of rendering every service in my power to promote it, induced me\r\nto defer my return to that country, and to the society of my friends,\r\nfor more than seven years. This long sacrifice of private tranquillity,\r\nespecially after having gone through the fatigues and dangers of the\r\nAmerican Revolution which continued almost eight years, deserved a\r\nbetter fate than the long imprisonment I have silently suffered. But it\r\nis not the nation but a faction that has done me this injustice. Parties\r\nand Factions, various and numerous as they have been, I have always\r\navoided. My heart was devoted to all France, and the object to which I\r\napplied myself was the Constitution. The Plan which I proposed to the\r\nCommittee, of which I was a member, is now in the hands of Barère, and\r\nit will speak for itself.\r\n\r\n     1 Revolutions have now acquired such sanguinary associations\r\n     that it is important to bear in mind that by \"revolution\"\r\n     Paine always means simply a change or reformation of\r\n     government, which might be and ought to be bloodless. See\r\n     \"Rights of Man\" Part II., vol. ii. of this work, pp. 513,\r\n     523.--:_Editor_.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps proper that I inform you of the cause as-assigned in the\r\norder for my imprisonment. It is that I am 'a Foreigner'; whereas, the\r\n_Foreigner_ thus imprisoned was invited into France by a decree of the\r\nlate National Assembly, and that in the hour of her greatest danger,\r\nwhen invaded by Austrians and Prussians. He was, moreover, a citizen of\r\nthe United States of America, an ally of France, and not a subject of\r\nany country in Europe, and consequently not within the intentions of any\r\ndecree concerning Foreigners. But any excuse can be made to serve the\r\npurpose of malignity when in power.\r\n\r\nI will not intrude on your time by offering any apology for the broken\r\nand imperfect manner in which I have expressed myself. I request you to\r\naccept it with the sincerity with which it comes from my heart; and I\r\nconclude with wishing Fraternity and prosperity to France, and union and\r\nhappiness to her representatives.\r\n\r\nCitizens, I have now stated to you my situation, and I can have no doubt\r\nbut your justice will restore me to the Liberty of which I have been\r\ndeprived.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nLuxembourg, Thermidor 19, 2nd Year of the French Republic, one and\r\nindivisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. THE MEMORIAL TO MONROE.\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S historical introduction:\r\n\r\nThe Memorial is here printed from the manuscript of Paine now among the\r\nMorrison Papers, in the British Museum,--no doubt the identical document\r\npenned in Luxembourg prison. The paper in the United States State\r\nDepartment (vol. vii., Monroe Papers) is accompanied by a note by\r\nMonroe: \"Mr. Paine, Luxembourg, on my arrival in France, 1794. My answer\r\nwas after the receipt of his second letter. It is thought necessary to\r\nprint only those parts of his that relate directly to his confinement,\r\nand to omit all between the parentheses in each.\" The paper thus\r\ninscribed seems to have been a wrapper for all of Paine's letters.\r\nAn examination of the MS. at Washington does not show any such\r\n\"parentheses,\" indicating omissions, whereas that in the British Museum\r\nhas such marks, and has evidently been prepared for the press,--being\r\nindeed accompanied by the long title of the French pamphlet. There are\r\nother indications that the British Museum MS. is the original Memorial\r\nfrom which was printed in Paris the pamphlet entitled:\r\n\r\n\"Mémoire de Thomas Payne, autographe et signé de sa main: addressé à\r\nM. Monroe, ministre des États-unis en france, pour réclamer sa mise en\r\nliberté comme citoyen Américain, 10 Sept 1794. Robespierre avait fait\r\narrêter Th. Payne, en 1793--il fut conduit au Luxembourg où le glaive\r\nfut longtemps suspendu sur sa tête. Après onze mois de captivité, il\r\nrecouvra la liberté, sur la réclamation du ministre Américain--c'était\r\naprès la chute de Robespierre--il reprit sa place à la convention, le 8\r\ndécembre 1794. (18 frimaire an iii.) Ce Mémoire contient des renseigne\r\nmens curieux sur la conduite politique de Th. Payne en france, pendant\r\nla Révolution, et à l'époque du procès de Louis XVI. Ce n'est point, dit\r\nil, comme Quaker, qu'il ne vota pas La Mort du Roi mais par un sentiment\r\nd'humanité, qui ne tenait point à ses principes religieux. Villenave.\"\r\n\r\nNo date is given, but the pamphlet probably appeared early in 1795.\r\nMatthieu Gillaume Thérèse Villenave (b. 1762, d. 1846) was a journalist,\r\nand it will be noticed that he, or the translator, modifies Paine's\r\nanswer to Marat about his Quakerism. There are some loose translations\r\nin the cheap French pamphlet, but it is the only publication which\r\nhas given Paine's Memorial with any fulness. Nearly ten pages of\r\nthe manuscript were omitted from the Memorial when it appeared as\r\nan Appendix to the pamphlet entitled \"Letter to George Washington,\r\nPresident of the United States of America, on Affairs public and\r\nprivate.\" By Thomas Paine, Author of the Works entitled, Common Sense,\r\nRights of Man, Age of Reason, &c. Philadelphia: Printed by Benj.\r\nFranklin Bache, No. 112 Market Street. 1796. [Entered according to\r\nlaw.] This much-abridged copy of the Memorial has been followed in\r\nall subsequent editions, so that the real document has not hitherto\r\nappeared.(1)\r\n\r\nIn appending the Memorial to his \"Letter to Washington,\" Paine would\r\nnaturally omit passages rendered unimportant by his release, but his\r\nfriend Bache may have suppressed others that might have embarrassed\r\nAmerican partisans of France, such as the scene at the king's trial.\r\n\r\n     1 Bache's pamphlet reproduces the portrait engraved in\r\n     Villenave, where it is underlined: \"Peint par Ped [Peale] à\r\n     Philadelphie, Dessiné par F. Bonneville, Gravé par Sandoz.\"\r\n     In Bache it is: \"Bolt sc. 1793 \"; and beneath this the\r\n     curious inscription: \"Thomas Paine. Secretair d. Americ:\r\n     Congr: 1780. Mitgl: d. fr. Nat. Convents. 1793.\" The\r\n     portrait is a variant of that now in Independence Hall, and\r\n     one of two painted by C. W. Peale. The other (in which the\r\n     chin is supported by the hand) was for religious reasons\r\n     refused by the Boston Museum when it purchased the\r\n     collection of \"American Heroes\" from Rembrandt Peale. It was\r\n     bought by John McDonough, whose brother sold it to Mr.\r\n     Joseph Jefferson, the eminent actor, and perished when his\r\n     house was burned at Buzzard's Bay. Mr. Jefferson writes me\r\n     that he meant to give the portrait to the Paine Memorial\r\n     Society, Boston; \"but the cruel fire roasted the splendid\r\n     _Infidel_, so I presume the saints are satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThis description, however, and a large proportion of the suppressed\r\npages, are historically among the most interesting parts of the\r\nMemorial, and their restoration renders it necessary to transfer the\r\ndocument from its place as an appendix to that of a preliminary to the\r\n\"Letter to Washington.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's Letter to Washington burdens his reputation today more,\r\nprobably, than any other production of his pen. The traditional judgment\r\nwas formed in the absence of many materials necessary for a just\r\nverdict. The editor feels under the necessity of introducing at this\r\npoint an historical episode; he cannot regard it as fair to the memory\r\nof either Paine or Washington that these two chapters should be printed\r\nwithout a full statement of the circumstances, the most important of\r\nwhich, but recently discovered, were unknown to either of those men. In\r\nthe editor's \"Life of Thomas Paine\" (ii., pp. 77-180) newly discovered\r\nfacts and documents bearing on the subject are given, which may\r\nbe referred to by those who desire to investigate critically such\r\nstatements as may here appear insufficiently supported. Considerations\r\nof space require that the history in that work should be only summarized\r\nhere, especially as important new details must be added.\r\n\r\nPaine was imprisoned (December 28, 1793) through the hostility of\r\nGouverneur Morris, the American Minister in Paris. The fact that the\r\nUnited States, after kindling revolution in France by its example, was\r\nthen represented in that country by a Minister of vehement royalist\r\nopinions, and one who literally entered into the service of the King to\r\ndefeat the Republic, has been shown by that Minister's own biographers.\r\nSome light is cast on the events that led to this strange situation by\r\na letter written to M. de Mont-morin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, by\r\na French Chargé d'Affaires, Louis Otto, dated Philadelphia, 10 March,\r\n1792. Otto, a nobleman who married into the Livingston family, was an\r\nastute diplomatist, and enjoyed the intimacy of the Secretary of\r\nState, Jefferson, and of his friends. At the close of a long interview\r\nJefferson tells him that \"The secresy with which the Senate covers its\r\ndeliberations serves to veil personal interest, which reigns therein in\r\nall its strength.\" Otto explains this as referring to the speculative\r\noperations of Senators, and to the commercial connections some of them\r\nhave with England, making them unfriendly to French interests.\r\n\r\n\"Among the latter the most remarkable is Mr. Robert Morris, of English\r\nbirth, formerly Superintendent of Finance, a man of greatest talent,\r\nwhose mercantile speculations are as unlimited as his ambition. He\r\ndirects the Senate as he once did the American finances in making it\r\nkeep step with his policy and his business.... About two years ago Mr.\r\nRobert Morris sent to France Mr. Gouverneur Morris to negotiate a loan\r\nin his name, and for different other personal matters.... During his\r\nsojourn in France, Mr. Rob. Morris thought he could make him more useful\r\nfor his aims by inducing the President of the United States to entrust\r\nhim with a negotiation with England relative to the Commerce of the two\r\ncountries. M. Gouv. Morris acquitted himself in this as an adroit man,\r\nand with his customary zeal, but despite his address (insinuation)\r\nobtained only the vague hope of an advantageous commercial treaty on\r\ncondition of an _Alliance resembling that between France and the United\r\nStates_.... [Mr. Robert Morris] is himself English, and interested in\r\nall the large speculations founded in this country for Great Britain....\r\nHis great services as Superintendent of Finance during the Revolution\r\nhave assured him the esteem and consideration of General Washington,\r\nwho, however, is far from adopting his views about France. The warmth\r\nwith which Mr. Rob. Morris opposed in the Senate the exemption of French\r\n_armateurs_ from tonnage, demanded by His Majesty, undoubtedly had\r\nfor its object to induce the king, by this bad behavior, to break the\r\ntreaty, in order to facilitate hereafter the negotiations begun with\r\nEngland to form an alliance. As for Mr. Gouv. Morris he is entirely\r\ndevoted to his correspondent, with whom he has been constantly connected\r\nin business and opinion. His great talents are recognized, and his\r\nextreme quickness in conceiving new schemes and gaining others to them.\r\nHe is perhaps the most eloquent and ingenious man of his country, but\r\nhis countrymen themselves distrust his talents. They admire but fear\r\nhim.\" (1)\r\n\r\n     1 Archives of the State Department, Paris, États Unis.,\r\n      vol. 35, fol. 301.\r\n\r\nThe Commission given to Gouverneur Morris by Washington, to which\r\nOtto refers, was in his own handwriting, dated October 13, 1789, and\r\nauthorized him \"in the capacity of private agent, and in the credit of\r\nthis letter, to converse with His Britannic Majesty's ministers on these\r\npoints, viz. whether there be any, and what objection to performing\r\nthose articles of the treaty which remained to be performed on his part;\r\nand whether they incline to a treaty of commerce on any and what terms.\r\nThis communication ought regularly to be made to you by the Secretary\r\nof State; but, that office not being at present filled, my desire of\r\navoiding delays induces me to make it under my own hand.\"(1)\r\n\r\nThe President could hardly have assumed the authority of secretly\r\nappointing a virtual ambassador had there not been a tremendous object\r\nin view: this, as he explains in an accompanying letter, was to\r\nsecure the evacuation by Great Britain of the frontier posts. This\r\nall-absorbing purpose of Washington is the key to his administration.\r\nGouverneur Morris paved the way for Jay's treaty, and he was paid for\r\nit with the French mission. The Senate would not have tolerated his\r\nappointment to England, and only by a majority of four could the\r\nPresident secure his confirmation as Minister to France (January 12,\r\n1792). The President wrote Gouverneur Morris (January 28th) a friendly\r\nlecture about the objections made to him, chiefly that he favored the\r\naristocracy and was unfriendly to the revolution, and expressed \"the\r\nfullest confidence\" that, supposing the allegations founded, he would\r\n\"effect a change.\" But Gouverneur Morris remained the agent of Senator\r\nRobert Morris, and still held Washington's mission to England, and he\r\nknew only as \"conspirators\" the rulers who succeeded Louis XVI. Even\r\nwhile utilizing them, he was an agent of Great Britain in its war\r\nagainst the country to which he was officially commissioned.\r\n\r\n     1 Ford's \"Writings of George Washington\" vol. xi., p. 440.\r\n\r\nLafayette wrote to Washington (\"Paris, March 15,1792\") the following\r\nappeal:\r\n\r\n\"Permit me, my dear General, to make an observation for yourself alone,\r\non the recent selection of an American ambassador. Personally I am a\r\nfriend of Gouverneur Morris, and have always been, in private, quite\r\ncontent with him; but the aristocratic and really contra-revolutionary\r\nprinciples which he has avowed render him little fit to represent the\r\nonly government resembling ours.... I cannot repress the desire that\r\nAmerican and French principles should be in the heart and on the lips of\r\nthe ambassador of the United States in France.\" (1)\r\n\r\nIn addition to this; two successive Ministers from France, after the\r\nfall of the Monarchy, conveyed to the American Government the most\r\nearnest remonstrances against the continuance of Gouverneur Morris in\r\ntheir country, one of them reciting the particular offences of which\r\nhe was guilty. The President's disregard of all these protests and\r\nentreaties, unexampled perhaps in history, had the effect of giving\r\nGouverneur Morris enormous power over the country against which he\r\nwas intriguing. He was recognized as the Irremovable. He represented\r\nWashington's fixed and unalterable determination, and this at a moment\r\nwhen the main purpose of the revolutionary leaders was to preserve the\r\nalliance with America. Robespierre at that time ( 1793) had special\r\ncharge of diplomatic affairs, and it is shown by the French historian,\r\nFrédéric Masson, that he was very anxious to recover for the republic\r\nthe initiative of the American alliance credited to the king; and\r\n\"although their Minister, Gouverneur Morris, was justly suspected,\r\nand the American republic was at that time aiming only to utilize the\r\ncondition of its ally, the French republic cleared it at a cheap rate of\r\nits debts contracted with the King.\"(2) Morris adroitly held this\r\ndoubt, whether the alliance of his government with Louis XVI. would\r\nbe continued to that King's executioners, over the head of the\r\nrevolutionists, as a suspended sword. Under that menace, and with\r\nthe authentication of being Washington's irremovable mouthpiece, this\r\nMinister had only to speak and it was done.\r\n\r\n     1 \"Mémoire», etc., du General Lafayette,\" Bruxelles, 1837,\r\n     tome ii., pp. 484,485.\r\n\r\n     2 \"Le Département des Affaires Étrangères pendant la\r\n     Révolution,\" p. 395.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Gouverneur Morris was steadily working in France for the\r\naim which he held in common with Robert Morris, namely to transfer the\r\nalliance from France to England. These two nations being at war, it was\r\nimpossible for France to fulfil all the terms of the alliance; it could\r\nnot permit English ships alone to seize American provisions on the seas,\r\nand it was compelled to prevent American vessels from leaving French\r\nports with cargoes certain of capture by British cruisers. In this way\r\na large number of American Captains with their ships were detained in\r\nFrance, to their distress, but to their Minister's satisfaction. He did\r\nnot fail to note and magnify all \"infractions\" of the treaty, with the\r\nhope that they might be the means of annulling it in favor of England,\r\nand he did nothing to mitigate sufferings which were counts in his\r\nindictment of the Treaty.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Paine came in the American Minister's way. He\r\nhad been on good terms with Gouverneur Morris, who in 1790 (May 29th)\r\nwrote from London to the President:\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th Mr. Paine called to tell me that he had conversed on the\r\nsame subject [impressment of American seamen] with Mr. Burke, who had\r\nasked him if there was any minister, consul, or other agent of the\r\nUnited States who could properly make application to the Government: to\r\nwhich he had replied in the negative; but said that I was here, who had\r\nbeen a member of Congress, and was therefore the fittest person to step\r\nforward. In consequence of what passed thereupon between them he [Paine]\r\nurged me to take the matter up, which I promised to do. On the 18th I\r\nwrote to the Duke of Leeds requesting an interview.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Force's \"American State Papers, For. Rel.,\" vol. i.\r\n\r\nAt that time (1790) Paine was as yet a lion in London, thus able to\r\ngive Morris a lift. He told Morris, in 1792 that he considered his\r\nappointment to France a mistake. This was only on the ground of his\r\nanti-republican opinions; he never dreamed of the secret commissions\r\nto England. He could not have supposed that the Minister who had so\r\npromptly presented the case of impressed seamen in England would\r\nnot equally attend to the distressed Captains in France; but these,\r\nneglected by their Minister, appealed to Paine. Paine went to see\r\nMorris, with whom he had an angry interview, during which he asked\r\nMorris \"if he did not feel ashamed to take the money of the country\r\nand do nothing for it.\" Paine thus incurred the personal enmity of\r\nGouverneur Morris. By his next step he endangered this Minister's\r\nscheme for increasing the friction between France and America; for\r\nPaine advised the Americans to appeal directly to the Convention, and\r\nintroduced them to that body, which at once heeded their application,\r\nMorris being left out of the matter altogether. This was August 22d, and\r\nMorris was very angry. It is probable that the Americans in Paris\r\nfelt from that time that Paine was in danger, for on September 13th a\r\nmemorial, evidently concocted by them, was sent to the French government\r\nproposing that they should send Commissioners to the United States to\r\nforestall the intrigues of England, and that Paine should go with them,\r\nand set forth their case in the journals, as he \"has great influence\r\nwith the people.\" This looks like a design to get Paine safely out of\r\nthe country, but it probably sealed his fate. Had Paine gone to America\r\nand reported there Morris's treacheries to France and to his own\r\ncountry, and his licentiousness, notorious in Paris, which his diary has\r\nrecently revealed to the world, the career of the Minister would have\r\nswiftly terminated. Gouverneur Morris wrote to Robert Morris that\r\nPaine was intriguing for his removal, and intimates that he (Paine) was\r\nambitious of taking his place in Paris. Paine's return to America must\r\nbe prevented.\r\n\r\nHad the American Minister not been well known as an enemy of the\r\nrepublic it might have been easy to carry Paine from the Convention to\r\nthe guillotine; but under the conditions the case required all of the\r\ningenuity even of a diplomatist so adroit as Gouverneur Morris. But fate\r\nhad played into his hand. It so happened that Louis Otto, whose letter\r\nfrom Philadelphia has been quoted, had become chief secretary to the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs in Paris, M. Deforgues. This Minister and\r\nhis Secretary, apprehending the fate that presently overtook both, were\r\nanxious to be appointed to America. No one knew better than Otto the\r\ncommanding influence of Gouverneur Morris, as Washington's \"irremovable\"\r\nrepresentative, both in France and America, and this desire of the two\r\nfrightened officials to get out of France was confided to him.(1) By\r\nhope of his aid, and by this compromising confidence, Deforgues came\r\nunder the power of a giant who used it like a giant. Morris at\r\nonce hinted that Paine was fomenting the troubles given by Genêt to\r\nWashington in America, and thus set in motion the procedure by which\r\nPaine was ultimately lodged in prison.\r\n\r\nThere being no charge against Paine in France, and no ill-will felt\r\ntowards him by Robespierre, compliance with the supposed will of\r\nWashington was in this case difficult. Six months before, a law had been\r\npassed to imprison aliens of hostile nationality, which could not affect\r\nPaine, he being a member of the Convention and an American. But a decree\r\nwas passed, evidently to reach Paine, \"that no foreigner should be\r\nadmitted to represent the French people\"; by this he was excluded from\r\nthe Convention, and the Committee of General Surety enabled to take the\r\nfinal step of assuming that he was an Englishman, and thus under the\r\ndecree against aliens of hostile nations.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Letter of Gouverneur Morris to Washington, Oct 19, 1793.\r\n     Sparks's \"Life of Gouverneur Morris,\" vol. ii., p. 375.\r\n\r\n     2 Although, as I have said, there was no charge against\r\n     Paine in France, and none assigned in any document connected\r\n     with his arrest, some kind of insinuation had to be made in\r\n     the Convention to cover proceedings against a Deputy, and\r\n     Bourdon de l'Oise said, \"I know that he has intrigued with a\r\n     former agent of the bureau of Foreign Affairs.\" It will be\r\n     seen by the third addendum to the Memorial to Monroe that\r\n     Paine supposed this to refer to Louis Otto, who had been his\r\n     interpreter in an interview requested by Barère, of the\r\n     Committee of Public Safety. But as Otto was then, early in\r\n     September, 1793, Secretary in the Foreign Office, and Barère\r\n     a fellow-terrorist of Bourdon, there could be no accusation\r\n     based on an interview which, had it been probed, would have\r\n     put Paine's enemies to confusion. It is doubtful, however,\r\n     if Paine was right in his conjecture. The reference of\r\n     Bourdon was probably to the collusion between Paine and\r\n     Genêt suggested by Morris.\r\n\r\nPaine was thus lodged in prison simply to please Washington, to whom\r\nit was left to decide whether he had been rightly represented by his\r\nMinister in the case. When the large number of Americans in Paris\r\nhastened in a body to the Convention to demand his release, the\r\nPresident (Vadier) extolled Paine, but said his birth in England brought\r\nhim under the measures of safety, and referred them to the Committees.\r\nThere they were told that \"their reclamation was only the act of\r\nindividuals, without any authority from the American Government.\"\r\nUnfortunately the American petitioners, not understanding by this a\r\nreference to the President, unsuspiciously repaired to Morris, as\r\nalso did Paine by letter. The Minister pretended compliance, thereby\r\npreventing their direct appeal to the President. Knowing, however, that\r\nAmerica would never agree that nativity under the British flag made\r\nPaine any more than other Americans a citizen of England, the American\r\nMinister came from Sain-port, where he resided, to Paris, and secured\r\nfrom the obedient Deforgues a certificate that he had reclaimed Paine\r\nas an American citizen, but that he was held as a _French_ citizen.\r\nThis ingeniously prepared certificate which was sent to the Secretary\r\nof State (Jefferson), and Morris's pretended \"reclamation,\" _which was\r\nnever sent to America_, are translated in my \"Life of Paine,\" and here\r\ngiven in the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nÀ Paris le 14 février 1794, 26 pluviôse.\r\n\r\nLe Minisire plénipotentiaire des États Unis de l'Amérique près la\r\nRépublique française au Ministre des Affaires Étrangères.\r\n\r\nMonsieur:\r\n\r\nThomas Paine vient de s'adresser à moi pour que je le réclame comme\r\nCitoyen des États Unis.

Translations:--Morris: \"Sir,--Thomas Paine has just\r\n     applied to me to claim him as a citizen of the United\r\n     States. Here (I believe) are the facts relating to him. He\r\n     was born in England. Having afterwards become a citizen of\r\n     the United States, he acquired great celebrity there by his\r\n     revolutionary writings. In consequence he was adopted a\r\n     French citizen and then elected Member of the Convention.\r\n     His conduct since this epoch is out of my jurisdiction. I am\r\n     ignorant of the reason for his present detention in the\r\n     Luxembourg prison, but I beg you, sir (if reasons unknown to\r\n     me prevent his liberation), be so good as to inform me, that\r\n     I may communicate them to the government of the United\r\n     States.\" Deporgurs: \"By your letter of the 36th of last\r\n     month you reclaim the liberty of Thomas Paine as an American\r\n     citizen. Born in England, this ex-deputy has become\r\n     successively an American and a French citizen. In accepting\r\n     this last title, and in occupying a place in the Corps\r\n     Législatif he submitted himself to the laws of the Republic,\r\n     and has certainly renounced the protection which the law of\r\n     nations, and treaties concluded with the United States,\r\n     could have assured him. I am ignorant of the motives of his\r\n     detention, but I must presume they are well founded. I shall\r\n     nevertheless submit to the Committee of Public Safety the\r\n     demand you have addressed to me, and I shall lose no time in\r\n     letting you know its decision.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Deforgues begins his letter with a falsehood: \"You\r\nreclaim the liberty of Paine as an American citizen.\" Morris's letter\r\nhad declared him a French citizen out of his (the American Minister's)\r\n\"jurisdiction.\" Morris states for Deforgues his case, and it is\r\nobediently adopted, though quite discordant with the decree, which\r\nimprisoned Paine as a foreigner. Deforgues also makes Paine a member\r\nof a non-existent body, the \"Corps Législatif,\" which might suggest\r\nin Philadelphia previous connection with the defunct Assembly. No such\r\ninquiries as Deforgues promised, nor any, were ever made, and of course\r\nnone were intended. Morris had got from Deforgues the certificate he\r\nneeded to show in Philadelphia and to Americans in Paris. His pretended\r\n\"reclamation\" was of course withheld: no copy of it ever reached America\r\ntill brought from French archives by the present writer. Morris does\r\nnot appear to have ventured even to keep a copy of it himself. The draft\r\n(presumably in English), found among his papers by Sparks, alters the\r\nfatal sentence which deprived Paine of his American citizenship and of\r\nprotection. \"Res-sort\"--jurisdiction--which has a definite technical\r\nmeaning in the mouth of a Minister, is changed to \"cognizance\"; the\r\nsentence is made to read, \"his conduct from that time has not come under\r\nmy cognizance.\" (Sparks's \"Life of Gouverneur Morris,\" i., p. 401).\r\nEven as it stands in his book, Sparks says: \"The application, it must\r\nbe confessed, was neither pressing in its terms, nor cogent in its\r\narguments.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Minister, armed with this French missive, dictated by\r\nhimself, enclosed it to the Secretary of State, whom he supposed to be\r\nstill Jefferson, with a letter stating that he had reclaimed Paine as an\r\nAmerican, that he (Paine) was held to answer for \"crimes,\" and that any\r\nfurther attempt to release him would probably be fatal to the prisoner.\r\nBy these falsehoods, secured from detection by the profound secrecy of\r\nthe Foreign Offices in both countries, Morris paralyzed all interference\r\nfrom America, as Washington could not of course intervene in behalf of\r\nan American charged with \"crimes\" committed in a foreign country, except\r\nto demand his trial. But it was important also to paralyze further\r\naction by Americans in Paris, and to them, too, was shown the French\r\ncertificate of a reclamation never made. A copy was also sent to Paine,\r\nwho returned to Morris an argument which he entreated him to embody in\r\na further appeal to the French Minister. This document was of course\r\nburied away among the papers of Morris, who never again mentioned Paine\r\nin any communication to the French government, but contented himself\r\nwith personal slanders of his victim in private letters to Washington's\r\nfriend, Robert Morris, and no doubt others. I quote Sparks's summary of\r\nthe argument unsuspectingly sent by Paine to Morris:\r\n\r\n\"He first proves himself to have been an American citizen, a character\r\nof which he affirms no subsequent act had deprived him. The title of\r\nFrench citizen was a mere nominal and honorary one, which the\r\nConvention chose to confer, when they asked him to help them in making a\r\nConstitution. But let the nature or honor of the title be what it might,\r\nthe Convention had taken it away of their own accord. 'He was\r\nexcluded from the Convention on the motion for excluding _foreigners_.\r\nConsequently he was no longer under the law of the Republic as a\r\n_citizen_, but under the protection of the Treaty of Alliance, as fully\r\nand effectually as any other citizen of America. It was therefore the\r\nduty of the American Minister to demand his release.'\"\r\n\r\nTo this Sparks adds:\r\n\r\n\"Such is the drift of Paine's argument, and it would seem indeed that\r\nhe could not be a foreigner and a citizen at the same time. It was hard\r\nthat his only privilege of citizenship should be that of imprisonment.\r\nBut this logic was a little too refined for the revolutionary tribunals\r\nof the Jacobins in Paris, and Mr. Morris well knew it was not worth\r\nwhile to preach it to them. He did not believe there was any serious\r\ndesign at that time against the life of the prisoner, and he considered\r\nhis best chance of safety to be in preserving silence for the present.\r\nHere the matter rested, and Paine was left undisturbed till the arrival\r\nof Mr. Monroe, who procured his discharge from confinement.\" (\"Life of\r\nGouverneur Morris,\" i., p. 417.)l\r\n\r\nSparks takes the gracious view of the man whose Life he was writing, but\r\nthe facts now known turn his words to sarcasm. The Terror by which Paine\r\nsuffered was that of Morris, who warned him and his friends, both in\r\nParis and America, that if his case was stirred the knife would fall\r\non him. Paine declares (see xx.) that this danger kept him silent till\r\nafter the fall of Robespierre. None knew so well as Morris that\r\nthere were no charges against Paine for offences in France, and that\r\nRobespierre was awaiting that action by Washington which he (Morris) had\r\nrendered impossible. Having thus suspended the knife over Paine for six\r\nmonths, Robespierre interpreted the President's silence, and that\r\nof Congress, as confirmation of Morris's story, and resolved on the\r\nexecution of Paine \"in the interests of America as well as of France\";\r\nin other words to conciliate Washington to the endangered alliance with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nPaine escaped the guillotine by the strange accident related in a\r\nfurther chapter. The fall of Robespierre did not of course end his\r\nimprisonment, for he was not Robespierre's but Washington's prisoner.\r\nMorris remained Minister in France nearly a month after Robespierre's\r\ndeath, but the word needed to open Paine's prison was not spoken.\r\nAfter his recall, had Monroe been able at once to liberate Paine, an\r\ninvestigation must have followed, and Morris would probably have taken\r\nhis prisoner's place in the Luxembourg. But Morris would not present his\r\nletters of recall, and refused to present his successor, thus keeping\r\nMonroe out of his office four weeks. In this he was aided by Bourdon\r\nde l'Oise (afterwards banished as a royalist conspirator, but now a\r\ncommissioner to decide on prisoners); also by tools of Robespierre who\r\nhad managed to continue on the Committee of Public Safety by laying\r\ntheir crimes on the dead scapegoat--Robespierre. Against Barère (who had\r\nsigned Paine's death-warrant), Billaud-Varennes, and Colloit d'Her-bois,\r\nPaine, if liberated, would have been a terrible witness. The Committee\r\nruled by them had suppressed Paine's appeal to the Convention, as they\r\npresently suppressed Monroe's first appeal. Paine, knowing that Monroe\r\nhad arrived, but never dreaming that the manoeuvres of Morris were\r\nkeeping him out of office, wrote him from prison the following letters,\r\nhitherto unpublished.\r\n\r\n     1 There is no need to delay the reader here with any\r\n     argument about Paine's unquestionable citizenship, that\r\n     point having been settled by his release as an American, and\r\n     the sanction of Monroe's action by his government. There was\r\n     no genuineness in any challenge of Paine's citizenship, but\r\n     a mere desire to do him an injury. In this it had marvellous\r\n     success. Ten years after Paine had been reclaimed by Monroe,\r\n     with the sanction of Washington, as an American citizen, his\r\n     vote was refused at New Rochelle, New York, by the\r\n     supervisor, Elisha Ward, on the ground that Washington and\r\n     Morris had refused to Declaim him. Under his picture of the\r\n     dead Paine, Jarvis, the artist, wrote: \"A man who devoted\r\n     his whole life to the attainment of two objects--rights of\r\n     man, and freedom of conscience--had his vote denied when\r\n     living, and was denied a grave when dead.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 17th, 1794.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir: As I believe none of the public papers have announced your\r\nname right I am unable to address you by it, but a _new_ minister from\r\nAmerica is joy to me and will be so to every American in France.\r\n\r\nEight months I have been imprisoned, and I know not for what, except\r\nthat the order says that I am a Foreigner. The Illness I have suffered\r\nin this place (and from which I am but just recovering) had nearly put\r\nan end to my existence. My life is but of little value to me in\r\nthis situation tho' I have borne it with a firmness of patience and\r\nfortitude.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of a letter, (as well the translation as the\r\nEnglish)--which I sent to the Convention after the fall of the Monster\r\nRobespierre--for I was determined not to write a line during the time of\r\nhis detestable influence. I sent also a copy to the Committee of public\r\nsafety--but I have not heard any thing respecting it. I have now\r\nno expectation of delivery but by your means--_Morris has been my\r\ninveterate enemy_ and I think he has permitted something of the national\r\nCharacter of America to suffer by quietly letting a Citizen of that\r\nCountry remain almost eight months in prison without making every\r\nofficial exertion to procure him justice,--for every act of violence\r\noffered to a foreigner is offered also to the Nation to which he\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, Mr. Beresford, who will present you this has been very\r\nfriendly to me.(1) Wishing you happiness in your appointment, I am your\r\naffectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 18th, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: In addition to my letter of yesterday (sent to Mr. Beresford\r\nto be conveyed to you but which is delayed on account of his being at\r\nSt. Germain) I send the following memoranda.\r\n\r\nI was in London at the time I was elected a member of this Convention.\r\nI was elected a Deputé in four different departments without my knowing\r\nany thing of the matter, or having the least idea of it. The intention\r\nof electing the Convention before the time of the former Legislature\r\nexpired, was for the purpose of reforming the Constitution or rather for\r\nforming a new one. As the former Legislature shewed a disposition that\r\nI should assist in this business of the new Constitution, they prepared\r\nthe way by voting me a French Citoyen (they conferred the same title\r\non General Washington and certainly I had no more idea than he had of\r\nvacating any part of my real Citizenship of America for a nominal one in\r\nFrance, especially at a time when she did not know whether she would\r\nbe a Nation or not, and had it not even in her power to promise me\r\nprotection). I was elected (the second person in number of Votes, the\r\nAbbé Sieves being first) a member for forming the Constitution, and\r\nevery American in Paris as well as my other acquaintance knew that it\r\nwas my intention to return to America as soon as the Constitution should\r\nbe established. The violence of Party soon began to shew itself in the\r\nConvention, but it was impossible for me to see upon what principle they\r\ndiffered--unless it was a contention for power. I acted however as I\r\ndid in America, I connected myself with no Party, but considered myself\r\naltogether a National Man--but the case with Parties generally is that\r\nwhen you are not with one you are supposed to be with the other.\r\n\r\n     1 A friendly lamp-lighter, alluded to in the Letter to\r\n     Washington, conveyed this letter to Mr. Beresford.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nI was taken out of bed between three and four in the morning on the\r\n28 of December last, and brought to the Luxembourg--without any other\r\naccusation inserted in the order than that I was a foreigner; a motion\r\nhaving been made two days before in the Convention to expel Foreigners\r\ntherefrom. I certainly then remained, even upon their own tactics, what\r\nI was before, a Citizen of America.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after my imprisonment the Americans that were in Paris\r\nwent to the bar of the Convention to reclaim me, but contrary to my\r\nadvice, they made their address into a Petition, and it miscarried.\r\nI then applied to G. Morris, to reclaim me as an official part of his\r\nduty, which he found it necessary to do, and here the matter stopt.(1)\r\nI have not heard a single line or word from any American since, which\r\nis now seven months. I rested altogether on the hope that a new Minister\r\nwould arrive from America. I have escaped with life from more dangers\r\nthan one. Had it not been for the fall of Roberspierre and your timely\r\narrival I know not what fate might have yet attended me. There seemed to\r\nbe a determination to destroy all the Prisoners without regard to merit,\r\ncharacter, or any thing else. During the time I laid at the height of my\r\nillness they took, in one night only, 169 persons out of this prison\r\nand executed all but eight. The distress that I have suffered at being\r\nobliged to exist in the midst of such horrors, exclusive of my own\r\nprecarious situation, suspended as it were by the single thread of\r\naccident, is greater than it is possible you can conceive--but thank God\r\ntimes are at last changed, and I hope that your Authority will release\r\nme from this unjust imprisonment.\r\n\r\n     1 The falsehood told Paine, accompanied by an intimation of\r\n     danger in pursuing the pretended reclamation, was of course\r\n     meant to stop any farther action by Paine or his friends.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 25, 1794.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir: Having nothing to do but to sit and think, I will write\r\nto pass away time, and to say that I am still here. I have received two\r\nnotes from Mr. Beresford which are encouraging (as the generality of\r\nnotes and letters are that arrive to persons here) but they contain\r\nnothing explicit or decisive with respect to my liberation, and _I\r\nshall be very glad to receive a line from yourself to inform me in what\r\ncondition the matter stands_. If I only glide out of prison by a sort\r\nof accident America gains no credit by my liberation, neither can my\r\nattachment to her be increased by such a circumstance. She has had the\r\nservices of my best days, she has my allegiance, she receives my portion\r\nof Taxes for my house in Borden Town and my farm at New Rochelle, and\r\nshe owes me protection both at home and thro' her Ministers abroad, yet\r\nI remain in prison, in the face of her Minister, at the arbitrary will\r\nof a committee.\r\n\r\nExcluded as I am from the knowledge of everything and left to a random\r\nof ideas, I know not what to think or how to act. Before there was\r\nany Minister here (for I consider Morris as none) and while the\r\nRobespierrian faction lasted, I had nothing to do but to keep my mind\r\ntranquil and expect the fate that was every day inflicted upon my\r\ncomrades, not individually but by scores. Many a man whom I have passed\r\nan hour with in conversation I have seen marching to his destruction the\r\nnext hour, or heard of it the next morning; for what rendered the scene\r\nmore horrible was that they were generally taken away at midnight, so\r\nthat every man went to bed with the apprehension of never seeing his\r\nfriends or the world again.\r\n\r\nI wish to impress upon you that all the changes that have taken place in\r\nParis have been sudden. There is now a moment of calm, but if thro' any\r\nover complaisance to the persons you converse with on the subject of my\r\nliberation, you omit procuring it for me _now_, you may have to lament\r\nthe fate of your friend when its too late. The loss of a Battle to the\r\nNorthward or other possible accident may happen to bring this about. I\r\nam not out of danger till I am out of Prison.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I am now entirely without money. The Convention owes me 1800\r\nlivres salary which I know not how to get while I am here, nor do I know\r\nhow to draw for money on the rent of my farm in America. It is under\r\nthe care of my good friend General Lewis Morris. I have received no rent\r\nsince I have been in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Addressed] Minister Plenipotentiary from America, Maison des Étrangers,\r\nRue de la Loi, Rue Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the sufficiently cruel situation when there reached Paine in\r\nprison, September 4th, the letter of Peter Whiteside which caused him\r\nto write his Memorial. Whiteside was a Philadelphian whose bankruptcy in\r\nLondon had swallowed up some of Paine's means. His letter, reporting to\r\nPaine that he was not regarded by the American Government or people as\r\nan American citizen, and that no American Minister could interfere in\r\nhis behalf, was evidently inspired by Morris who was still in Paris, the\r\nauthorities being unwilling to give him a passport to Switzerland,\r\nas they knew he was going in that direction to join the conspirators\r\nagainst France. This Whiteside letter put Paine, and through him Monroe,\r\non a false scent by suggesting that the difficulty of his case lay in a\r\n_bona fide_ question of citizenship, whereas there never had been really\r\nany such question. The knot by which Morris had bound Paine was thus\r\nconcealed, and Monroe was appealing to polite wolves in the interest of\r\ntheir victim. There were thus more delays, inexplicable alike to Monroe\r\nand to Paine, eliciting from the latter some heartbroken letters, not\r\nhitherto printed, which I add at the end of the Memorial. To add to\r\nthe difficulties and dangers, Paris was beginning to be agitated by\r\nwell-founded rumors of Jay's injurious negotiations in England, and a\r\ncoldness towards Monroe was setting in. Had Paine's release been delayed\r\nmuch longer an American Minister's friendship might even have proved\r\nfatal. Of all this nothing could be known to Paine, who suffered agonies\r\nhe had not known during the Reign of Terror. The other prisoners of\r\nRobespierre's time had departed; he alone paced the solitary corridors\r\nof the Luxembourg, chilled by the autumn winds, his cell tireless, unlit\r\nby any candle, insufficiently nourished, an abscess forming in his side;\r\nall this still less cruel than the feeling that he was abandoned, not\r\nonly by Washington but by all America.\r\n\r\nThis is the man of whom Washington wrote to Madison nine years before:\r\n\"Must the merits and services of 'Common Sense' continue to glide down\r\nthe stream of time unrewarded by this country?\" This, then, is his\r\nreward. To his old comrade in the battle-fields of Liberty, George\r\nWashington, Paine owed his ten months of imprisonment, at the end of\r\nwhich Monroe found him a wreck, and took him (November 4) to his own\r\nhouse, where he and his wife nursed him back into life. But it was not\r\nfor some months supposed that Paine could recover; it was only after\r\nseveral relapses; and it was under the shadow of death that he wrote the\r\nletter to Washington so much and so ignorantly condemned. Those who have\r\nfollowed the foregoing narrative will know that Paine's grievances were\r\ngenuine, that his infamous treatment stains American history; but they\r\nwill also know that they lay chiefly at the door of a treacherous and\r\nunscrupulous American Minister.\r\n\r\nYet it is difficult to find an excuse for the retention of that Minister\r\nin France by Washington. On Monroe's return to America in 1797, he\r\nwrote a pamphlet concerning the mission from which he had been curtly\r\nrecalled, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"I was persuaded from Mr. Morris's known political character and\r\nprinciples, that his appointment, and especially at a period when the\r\nFrench nation was in a course of revolution from an arbitrary to a free\r\ngovernment, would tend to discountenance the republican cause there\r\nand at home, and otherwise weaken, and greatly to our prejudice, the\r\nconnexion subsisting between the two countries.\"\r\n\r\nIn a copy of this pamphlet found at Mount Vernon, Washington wrote on\r\nthe margin of this sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Morris was known to be a man of first rate abilities; and his\r\nintegrity and honor had never been impeached. Besides, Mr. Morris was\r\nsent whilst the kingly government was in existence, ye end of 91 or\r\nbeginning of 92.\" (1)\r\n\r\nBut this does not explain why Gouverneur Morris was persistently kept in\r\nFrance after monarchy was abolished (September 21, 1792), or even after\r\nLafayette's request for his removal, already quoted. To that letter\r\nof Lafayette no reply has been discovered. After the monarchy was\r\nabolished, Ternant and Genêt successively carried to America protests\r\nfrom their Foreign Office against the continuance of a Minister in\r\nFrance, who was known in Paris, and is now known to all acquainted with\r\nhis published papers, to have all along made his office the headquarters\r\nof British intrigue against France, American interests being quite\r\nsubordinated. Washington did not know this, but he might have known it,\r\nand his disregard of French complaints can hardly be ascribed to any\r\nother cause than his delusion that Morris was deeply occupied with\r\nthe treaty negotiations confided to him. It must be remembered that\r\nWashington believed such a treaty with England to be the alternative of\r\nwar.(2) On that apprehension the British party in America, and British\r\nagents, played to the utmost, and under such influences Washington\r\nsacrificed many old friendships,--with Jefferson, Madison, Monroe,\r\nEdmund Randolph, Paine,--and also the confidence of his own State,\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n     1  Washington's marginal notes on Monroe's \"View, etc.,\"\r\n     were first fully given in Ford's \"Writings of Washington,\"\r\n     vol. xiii., p. 452, seq.\r\n\r\n     2 Ibid., p. 453.\r\n\r\nThere is a traditional impression that Paine's angry letter to\r\nWashington was caused by the President's failure to inter-pose for\r\nhis relief from prison. But Paine believed that the American Minister\r\n(Morris) had reclaimed him in some feeble fashion, as an American\r\ncitizen, and he knew that the President had officially approved Monroe's\r\naction in securing his release. His grievance was that Washington, whose\r\nletters of friendship he cherished, who had extolled his services to\r\nAmerica, should have manifested no concern personally, made no use of\r\nhis commanding influence to rescue him from daily impending death, sent\r\nto his prison no word of kindness or inquiry, and sent over their mutual\r\nfriend Monroe without any instructions concerning him; and finally, that\r\nhis private letter, asking explanation, remained unanswered. No doubt\r\nthis silence of Washington concerning the fate of Paine, whom he\r\nacknowledged to be an American citizen, was mainly due to his fear\r\nof offending England, which had proclaimed Paine. The \"outlaw's\"\r\nimprisonment in Paris caused jubilations among the English gentry,\r\nand went on simultaneously with Jay's negotiations in London, when any\r\nexpression by Washington of sympathy with Paine (certain of publication)\r\nmight have imperilled the Treaty, regarded by the President as vital.\r\n\r\nSo anxious was the President about this, that what he supposed had been\r\ndone for Paine by Morris, and what had really been done by Monroe,\r\nwas kept in such profound secrecy, that even his Secretary of State,\r\nPickering, knew nothing of it. This astounding fact I recently\r\ndiscovered in the manuscripts of that Secretary.(1) Colonel Pickering,\r\nwhile flattering enough to the President in public, despised his\r\nintellect, and among his papers is a memorandum concluding as follows:\r\n\r\n\"But when the hazards of the Revolutionary War had ended, by the\r\nestablishment of our Independence, why was the knowledge of General\r\nWashington's comparatively defective mental powers not freely divulged?\r\nWhy, even by the enemies of his civil administration were his abilities\r\nvery tenderly glanced at? --Because there were few, if any men, who\r\ndid not revere him for his distinguished virtues; his modesty--his\r\nunblemished integrity, his pure and disinterested patriotism. These\r\nvirtues, of infinitely more value than exalted abilities without them,\r\nsecured to him the veneration and love of his fellow citizens at large.\r\nThus immensely popular, no man was willing to publish, under his hand,\r\neven the simple truth. The only exception, that I recollect, was the\r\ninfamous Tom Paine; and this when in France, after he had escaped the\r\nguillotine of Robespierre; and in resentment, because, after he had\r\nparticipated in the French Revolution, President Washington seemed\r\nnot to have thought him so very important a character in the world,\r\nas officially to interpose for his relief from the fangs of the French\r\nephemeral Rulers. In a word, no man, however well informed, was willing\r\nto hazard his own popularity by exhibiting the real intellectual\r\ncharacter of the immensely popular Washington.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Massachusetts Historical Society, vol. 11., p. 171.\r\n\r\nHow can this ignorance of an astute man, Secretary of State under\r\nWashington and Adams, be explained? Had Washington hidden the letters\r\nshowing on their face that he _had_ \"officially interposed\" for Paine by\r\ntwo Ministers?\r\n\r\nMadison, writing to Monroe, April 7, 1796, says that Pickering had\r\nspoken to him \"in harsh terms\" of a letter written by Paine to the\r\nPresident. This was a private letter of September 20, 1795, afterwards\r\nprinted in Paine's public Letter to Washington. The Secretary certainly\r\nread that letter on its arrival, January 18, 1796, and yet Washington\r\ndoes not appear to have told him of what had been officially done in\r\nPaine's case! Such being the secrecy which Washington had carried from\r\nthe camp to the cabinet, and the morbid extent of it while the British\r\nTreaty was in negotiation and discussion, one can hardly wonder at his\r\nsilence under Paine's private appeal and public reproach.\r\n\r\nMuch as Pickering hated Paine, he declares him the only man who ever\r\ntold the simple truth about Washington. In the lapse of time historical\r\nresearch, while removing the sacred halo of Washington, has revealed\r\nbeneath it a stronger brain than was then known to any one. Paine\r\npublished what many whispered, while they were fawning on Washington for\r\noffice, or utilizing his power for partisan ends. Washington, during his\r\nsecond administration, when his mental decline was remarked by\r\nhimself, by Jefferson, and others, was regarded by many of his eminent\r\ncontemporaries as fallen under the sway of small partisans. Not only\r\nwas the influence of Jefferson, Madison, Randolph, Monroe, Livingston,\r\nalienated, but the counsels of Hamilton were neutralized by Wolcott and\r\nPickering, who apparently agreed about the President's \"mental powers.\"\r\nHad not Paine previously incurred the _odium theologicum_, his pamphlet\r\nconcerning Washington would have been more damaging; even as it was, the\r\nverdict was by no means generally favorable to the President, especially\r\nas the replies to Paine assumed that Washington had indeed failed to\r\ntry and rescue him from impending death.(1) A pamphlet written by Bache,\r\nprinted anonymously (1797), Remarks occasioned by the late conduct of\r\nMr. Washington, indicates the belief of those who raised Washington to\r\npower, that both Randolph and Paine had been sacrificed to please Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe _Bien-informé_ (Paris, November 12, 1797) published a letter from\r\nPhiladelphia, which may find translation here as part of the history of\r\nthe pamphlet:\r\n\r\n\"The letter of Thomas Paine to General Washington is read here with\r\navidity. We gather from the English papers that the Cabinet of St James\r\nhas been unable to stop the circulation of that pamphlet in England,\r\nsince it is allowable to reprint there any English work already\r\npublished elsewhere, however disagreeable to Messrs. Pitt and Dundas.\r\nWe read in the letter to Washington that Robespierre had declared to\r\nthe Committee of Public Safety that it was desirable in the interests\r\nof both France and America that Thomas Paine, who, for seven or eight\r\nmonths had been kept a prisoner in the Luxembourg, should forthwith be\r\nbrought up for judgment before the revolutionary tribunal. The proof of\r\nthis fact is found in Robespierre's papers, and gives ground for strange\r\nsuspicions.\"\r\n\r\n     1 The principal ones were \"A Letter to Thomas Paine. By an\r\n     American Citizen. New York, 1797,\" and \"A Letter to the\r\n     infamous Tom Paine, in answer to his Letter to General\r\n     Washington. December 1796. By Peter Porcupine\" (Cobbett).\r\n     Writing to David Stuart, January 8,1797, Washington,\r\n     speaking of himself in the third person, says: \"Although\r\n     he is soon to become a private citizen, his opinions are to\r\n     be knocked down, and his character traduced as low as they\r\n     are capable of sinking it, even by resorting to absolute\r\n     falsehoods. As an evidence whereof, and of the plan they are\r\n     pursuing, I send you a letter of Mr. Paine to me, printed in\r\n     this city and disseminated with great industry. Enclosed you\r\n     will receive also a production of Peter Porcupine, alias\r\n     William Cobbett. Making allowances for the asperity of an\r\n     Englishman, for some of his strong and coarse expressions,\r\n     and a want of official information as to many facts, it is\r\n     not a bad thing.\" The \"many facts\" were, of course, the\r\n     action of Monroe, and the supposed action of Morris in\r\n     Paris, but not even to one so intimate as Stuart are these\r\n     disclosed.\r\n\r\n\"It was long believed that Paine had returned to America with his friend\r\nJames Monroe, and the lovers of freedom [there] congratulated themselves\r\non being able to embrace that illustrious champion of the Rights of Man.\r\nTheir hopes have been frustrated. We know positively that Thomas Paine\r\nis still living in France. The partizans of the late presidency [in\r\nAmerica] also know it well, yet they have spread a rumor that after\r\nactually arriving he found his (really popular) _principles no longer\r\nthe order of the day_, and thought best to re-embark.\r\n\r\n\"The English journals, while repeating this idle rumor, observed that it\r\nwas unfounded, and that Paine had not left France. Some French journals\r\nhave copied these London paragraphs, but without comments; so that at\r\nthe very moment when Thomas Paine's Letter on the 18th. Fructidor is\r\npublished, _La Clef du Cabinet_ says that this citizen is suffering\r\nunpleasantness in America.\"\r\n\r\nPaine had intended to return with Monroe, in the spring of 1797, but,\r\nsuspecting the Captain and a British cruiser in the distance, returned\r\nfrom Havre to Paris. The packet was indeed searched by the cruiser\r\nfor Paine, and, had he been captured, England would have executed the\r\nsentence pronounced by Robespierre to please Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL ADDRESSED TO JAMES MONROE,\r\n\r\nMINISTER FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE FRENCH REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nPrison of the Luxembourg, Sept. 10th, 1794.\r\n\r\nI address this memorial to you, in consequence of a letter I received\r\nfrom a friend, 18 Fructidor (September 4th,) in which he says, \"Mr.\r\nMonroe has told me, that he has no orders [meaning from the American\r\ngovernment] respecting you; but I am sure he will leave nothing\r\nundone to liberate you; but, from what I can learn, from all the late\r\nAmericans, you are not considered either by the Government, or by\r\nthe individuals, as an American citizen. You have been made a french\r\nCitizen, which you have accepted, and you have further made yourself\r\na servant of the french Republic; and, therefore, it would be out\r\nof character for an American Minister to interfere in their internal\r\nconcerns. You must therefore either be liberated out of Compliment to\r\nAmerica, or stand your trial, which you have a right to demand.\"\r\n\r\nThis information was so unexpected by me, that I am at a loss how to\r\nanswer it. I know not on what principle it originates; whether from an\r\nidea that I had voluntarily abandoned my Citizenship of America for that\r\nof France, or from any article of the American Constitution applied to\r\nme. The first is untrue with respect to any intention on my part; and\r\nthe second is without foundation, as I shall shew in the course of this\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nThe idea of conferring honor of Citizenship upon foreigners, who had\r\ndistinguished themselves in propagating the principles of liberty and\r\nhumanity, in opposition to despotism, war, and bloodshed, was first\r\nproposed by me to La Fayette, at the commencement of the french\r\nrevolution, when his heart appeared to be warmed with those principles.\r\nMy motive in making this proposal, was to render the people of different\r\nnations more fraternal than they had been, or then were. I observed that\r\nalmost every branch of Science had possessed itself of the exercise\r\nof this right, so far as it regarded its own institution. Most of the\r\nAcademies and Societies in Europe, and also those of America, conferred\r\nthe rank of honorary member, upon foreigners eminent in knowledge, and\r\nmade them, in fact, citizens of their literary or scientific republic,\r\nwithout affecting or anyways diminishing their rights of citizenship\r\nin their own country or in other societies: and why the Science of\r\nGovernment should not have the same advantage, or why the people of\r\none nation should not, by their representatives, exercise the right of\r\nconferring the honor of Citizenship upon individuals eminent in another\r\nnation, without affecting _their_ rights of citizenship, is a problem\r\nyet to be solved.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to remark on that part of the letter, in which the writer\r\nsays, that, _from what he can learn from all the late Americans, I\r\nam not considered in America, either by the Government or by the\r\nindividuals, as an American citizen_.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I wish to ask, what is here meant by the Government\r\nof America? The members who compose the Government are only individuals,\r\nwhen in conversation, and who, most probably, hold very different\r\nopinions upon the subject. Have Congress as a body made any declaration\r\nrespecting me, that they now no longer consider me as a citizen? If they\r\nhave not, anything they otherwise say is no more than the opinion\r\nof individuals, and consequently is not legal authority, nor anyways\r\nsufficient authority to deprive any man of his Citizenship. Besides,\r\nwhether a man has forfeited his rights of Citizenship, is a question not\r\ndeterminable by Congress, but by a Court of Judicature and a Jury; and\r\nmust depend upon evidence, and the application of some law or article of\r\nthe Constitution to the case. No such proceeding has yet been had, and\r\nconsequently I remain a Citizen until it be had, be that decision what\r\nit may; for there can be no such thing as a suspension of rights in the\r\ninterim.\r\n\r\nI am very well aware, and always was, of the article of the Constitution\r\nwhich says, as nearly as I can recollect the words, that \"any citizen\r\nof the United States, who shall accept any title, place, or office, from\r\nany foreign king, prince, or state, shall forfeit and lose his right of\r\nCitizenship of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHad the Article said, that _any citizen of the United States, who shall\r\nbe a member of any foreign convention, for the purpose of forming a free\r\nconstitution, shall forfeit and lose the right of citizenship of the\r\nUnited States_, the article had been directly applicable to me; but\r\nthe idea of such an article never could have entered the mind of the\r\nAmerican Convention, and the present article _is_ altogether foreign\r\nto the case with respect to me. It supposes a Government in active\r\nexistence, and not a Government dissolved; and it supposes a citizen of\r\nAmerica accepting titles and offices under that Government, and not a\r\ncitizen of America who gives his assistance in a Convention chosen by\r\nthe people, for the purpose of forming a Government _de nouveau_ founded\r\non their authority.\r\n\r\nThe late Constitution and Government of France was dissolved the 10th of\r\nAugust, 1792. The National legislative Assembly then in being, supposed\r\nitself without sufficient authority to continue its sittings, and it\r\nproposed to the departments to elect not another legislative Assembly,\r\nbut a Convention for the express purpose of forming a new Constitution.\r\nWhen the Assembly were discoursing on this matter, some of the members\r\nsaid, that they wished to gain all the assistance possible upon the\r\nsubject of free constitutions; and expressed a wish to elect and invite\r\nforeigners of any Nation to the Convention, who had distinguished\r\nthemselves in defending, explaining, and propagating the principles\r\nof liberty. It was on this occasion that my name was mentioned in the\r\nAssembly. (I was then in England.)\r\n\r\n     1 In the American pamphlet a footnote, probably added by\r\n     Bache, here says: \"Even this article does not exist in the\r\n     manner here stated.\" It is a pity Paine did not have in his\r\n     prison the article, which says: \"No person holding any\r\n     office of profit or trust under them [the United States]\r\n     shall, without the consent of Congress, accept of any\r\n     present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever,\r\n     from any king, prince, or foreign State.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, a deputation from a body of the french people, in order\r\nto remove any objection that might be made against my assisting at the\r\nproposed Convention, requested the Assembly, as their representatives,\r\nto give me the title of French Citizen; after which, I was elected a\r\nmember of the Convention, in four different departments, as is already\r\nknown.(1)\r\n\r\nThe case, therefore, is, that I accepted nothing from any king,\r\nprince, or state, nor from any Government: for France was without any\r\nGovernment, except what arose from common consent, and the necessity of\r\nthe case. Neither did I _make myself a servant of the french Republic_,\r\nas the letter alluded to expresses; for at that time France was not a\r\nrepublic, not even in name. She was altogether a people in a state of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Convention met that France was declared a republic,\r\nand monarchy abolished; soon after which a committee was elected, of\r\nwhich I was a member,(2) to form a Constitution, which was presented to\r\nthe Convention [and read by Condorcet, who was also a member] the\r\n15th and 16th of February following, but was not to be taken into\r\nconsideration till after the expiration of two months,(3) and if\r\napproved of by the Convention, was then to be referred to the people for\r\ntheir acceptance, with such additions or amendments as the Convention\r\nshould make.\r\n\r\n     1 The deputation referred to was described as the\r\n     \"Commission Extraordinaire,\" in whose name M. Guadet moved\r\n     that the title of French Citizen be conferred on Priestley,\r\n     Paine, Bentham, Wilberforce, Clarkson, Mackintosh, David\r\n     Williams, Cormelle, Paw, Pestalozzi, Washington, Madison,\r\n     Hamilton, Klopstock, Koscinsko, Gorani, Campe, Anacharsis\r\n     Clootz, Gilleers. This was on August 26, and Paine was\r\n     elected by Calais on September 6,1792; and in the same week\r\n     by Oise, Somme, and Puy-de-Dome.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Sieves, Paine, Brissot, Pétion, Vergniaud, Gensonne,\r\n     Barère, Danton, Condorcet.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     3 The remainder of this sentence is replaced in the American\r\n     pamphlet by the following: \"The disorders and the\r\n     revolutionary government that took place after this put a\r\n     stop to any further progress upon the case.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nIn thus employing myself upon the formation of a Constitution, I\r\ncertainly did nothing inconsistent with the American Constitution. I\r\ntook no oath of allegiance to France, or any other oath whatever. I\r\nconsidered the Citizenship they had presented me with as an honorary\r\nmark of respect paid to me not only as a friend to liberty, but as\r\nan American Citizen. My acceptance of that, or of the deputyship, not\r\nconferred on me by any king, prince, or state, but by a people in a\r\nstate of revolution and contending for liberty, required no transfer of\r\nmy allegiance or of my citizenship from America to France. There I was\r\na real citizen, paying Taxes; here, I was a voluntary friend, employing\r\nmyself on a temporary service. Every American in Paris knew that it was\r\nmy constant intention to return to America, as soon as a constitution\r\nshould be established, and that I anxiously waited for that event.\r\n\r\nI know not what opinions have been circulated in America. It may have\r\nbeen supposed there that I had voluntarily and intentionally abandoned\r\nAmerica, and that my citizenship had ceased by my own choice. I can\r\neasily [believe] there are those in that country who would take such\r\na proceeding on my part somewhat in disgust. The idea of forsaking\r\nold friendships for new acquaintances is not agreeable. I am a little\r\nwarranted in making this supposition by a letter I received some time\r\nago from the wife of one of the Georgia delegates in which she says\r\n\"Your friends on this side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of\r\nyour abandoning America.\"\r\n\r\nI have never abandoned her in thought, word or deed; and I feel it\r\nincumbent upon me to give this assurance to the friends I have in that\r\ncountry and with whom I have always intended and am determined, if the\r\npossibility exists, to close the scene of my life. It is there that I\r\nhave made myself a home. It is there that I have given the services of\r\nmy best days. America never saw me flinch from her cause in the most\r\ngloomy and perilous of her situations; and I know there are those in\r\nthat country who will not flinch from me. If I have enemies (and every\r\nman has some) I leave them to the enjoyment of their ingratitude.*\r\n\r\n     * I subjoin in a note, for the sake of wasting the solitude\r\n     of a prison, the answer that I gave to the part of the\r\n     letter above mentioned.   It is not inapplacable to the\r\n     subject of this Memorial; but it contain! somewhat of a\r\n     melancholy idea, a little predictive, that I hope is not\r\n     becoming true so soon.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat extraordinary that the idea of my not being a citizen\r\nof America should have arisen only at the time that I am imprisoned\r\nin France because, or on the pretence that, I am a foreigner. The case\r\ninvolves a strange contradiction of ideas. None of the Americans who\r\ncame to France whilst I was in liberty had conceived any such idea or\r\ncirculated any such opinion; and why it should arise now is a matter\r\nyet to be explained. However discordant the late American Minister G. M.\r\n[Gouverneur Morris] and the late French Committee of Public Safety were,\r\nit suited the purpose of both that I should be continued in arrestation.\r\nThe former wished to prevent my return to America, that I should not\r\nexpose his misconduct; and the latter, lest I should publish to the\r\nworld the history of its wickedness. Whilst that Minister and the\r\nCommittee continued I had no expectation of liberty. I speak here of the\r\nCommittee of which Robespierre was member.(1)\r\n\r\n     \"You touch me on a very tender point when you say that my\r\n     friends on your side the water cannot be reconciled to the\r\n     idea of my abandoning America. They are right. I had rather\r\n     see my horse Button eating the grass of Borden-Town or\r\n     Morrisania than see all the pomp and show of Europe.\r\n\r\n     \"A thousand years hence (for I must indulge a few thoughts)\r\n     perhaps in less, America may be what Europe now is. The\r\n     innocence of her character, that won the hearts of all\r\n     nations in her favour, may sound like a romance and her\r\n     inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruin of that\r\n     liberty which thousands bled for or struggled to obtain may\r\n     just furnish materials for a village tale or extort a sigh\r\n     from rustic sensibility, whilst the fashionable of that day,\r\n     enveloped in dissipation, shall deride the principle and\r\n     deny the fact.\r\n\r\n     \"When we contemplate the fall of Empires and the extinction\r\n     of the nations of the Ancient World, we see but little to\r\n     excite our regret than the mouldering ruins of pompous\r\n     palaces, magnificent museums, lofty pyramids and walls and\r\n     towers of the most costly workmanship; but when the Empire\r\n     of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow\r\n     will be infinitely greater than crumbling brass and marble\r\n     can inspire. It will not then be said, here stood a temple\r\n     of vast antiquity; here rose a babel of invisible height;\r\n     or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance; but here, Ah,\r\n     painful thought! the noblest work of human wisdom, the\r\n     grandest scene of human glory, the fair cause of Freedom\r\n     rose and fell. Read this, and then ask if I forget\r\n     America.\"--Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 This letter, quoted also in Paine's Letter to Washington,\r\n     was written from London, Jan. 6, 1789, to the wife of Col.\r\n     Few, née Kate Nicholson. It is given in full in my \"Life of\r\n     Paine,\" i., p. 247.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORIAL TO MONROE.\r\n\r\nI ever must deny, that the article of the American constitution\r\nalready mentioned, can be applied either verbally, intentionally,\r\nor constructively, to me. It undoubtedly was the intention of the\r\nConvention that framed it, to preserve the purity of the American\r\nrepublic from being debased by foreign and foppish customs; but it never\r\ncould be its intention to act against the principles of liberty, by\r\nforbidding its citizens to assist in promoting those principles in\r\nforeign Countries; neither could it be its intention to act against\r\nthe principles of gratitude.(1) France had aided America in the\r\nestablishment of her revolution, when invaded and oppressed by England\r\nand her auxiliaries. France in her turn was invaded and oppressed by a\r\ncombination of foreign despots. In this situation, I conceived it an act\r\nof gratitude in me, as a citizen of America, to render her in return the\r\nbest services I could perform. I came to France (for I was in England\r\nwhen I received the invitation) not to enjoy ease, emoluments, and\r\nfoppish honours, as the article supposes; but to encounter difficulties\r\nand dangers in defence of liberty; and I much question whether those who\r\nnow malignantly seek (for some I believe do) to turn this to my injury,\r\nwould have had courage to have done the same thing. I am sure Gouverneur\r\nMorris would not. He told me the second day after my arrival, (in\r\nParis,) that the Austrians and Prussians, who were then at Verdun,\r\nwould be in Paris in a fortnight. I have no idea, said he, that seventy\r\nthousand disciplined troops can be stopped in their march by any power\r\nin France.\r\n\r\n     1 This and the two preceding paragraphs, including the\r\n     footnote, are entirely omitted from the American pamphlet.\r\n     It will be seen that Paine had now a suspicion of the\r\n     conspiracy between Gouverneur Morris and those by whom he\r\n     was imprisoned. Soon after his imprisonment he had applied\r\n     to Morris, who replied that he had reclaimed him, and\r\n     enclosed the letter of Deforgues quoted in my Introduction\r\n     to this chapter, of course withholding his own letter to the\r\n     Minister. Paine answered (Feb. 14, 1793): \"You must not\r\n     leave me in the situation in which this letter places me.\r\n     You know I do not deserve it, and you see the unpleasant\r\n     situation in which I am thrown. I have made an answer to the\r\n     Minister's letter, which I wish you to make ground of a\r\n     reply to him. They have nothing against me--except that they\r\n     do not choose I should lie in a state of freedom to write my\r\n     mind freely upon things I have seen. Though you and I are\r\n     not on terms of the best harmony, I apply to you as the\r\n     Minister of America, and you may add to that service\r\n     whatever you think my integrity deserves. At any rate I\r\n     expect you to make Congress acquainted with my situation,\r\n     and to send them copies of the letters that have passed on\r\n     the subject. A reply to the Minister's letter is absolutely\r\n     necessary, were it only to continue the reclamation.\r\n     Otherwise your silence will be a sort of consent to his\r\n     observations.\" Deforgues' \"observations\" having been\r\n     dictated by Morris himself, no reply was sent to him, and no\r\n     word to Congress.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n     2 In the pamphlet this last clause of the sentence is\r\n     omitted.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBesides the reasons I have already given for accepting the invitations\r\nto the Convention, I had another that has reference particularly to\r\nAmerica, and which I mentioned to Mr. Pinckney the night before I left\r\nLondon to come to Paris: \"That it was to the interest of America that\r\nthe system of European governments should be changed and placed on the\r\nsame principle with her own.\" Mr. Pinckney agreed fully in the same\r\nopinion. I have done my part towards it.(1)\r\n\r\nIt is certain that governments upon similar systems agree better\r\ntogether than those that are founded on principles discordant with each\r\nother; and the same rule holds good with respect to the people living\r\nunder them. In the latter case they offend each other by pity, or by\r\nreproach; and the discordancy carries itself to matters of commerce. I\r\nam not an ambitious man, but perhaps I have been an ambitious American.\r\nI have wished to see America the _Mother Church_ of government, and I\r\nhave done my utmost to exalt her character and her condition.\r\n\r\n     1 In the American pamphlet the name of Pinckney (American\r\n     Minister in England) is left blank in this paragraph, and\r\n     the two concluding sentences are omitted from both the\r\n     French and American pamphlets.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nI have now stated sufficient matter, to shew that the Article in\r\nquestion is not applicable to me; and that any such application to my\r\ninjury, as well in circumstances as in Rights, is contrary both to\r\nthe letter and intention of that Article, and is illegal and\r\nunconstitutional. Neither do I believe that any Jury in America, when\r\nthey are informed of the whole of the case, would give a verdict to\r\ndeprive me of my Rights upon that Article. The citizens of America,\r\nI believe, are not very fond of permitting forced and indirect\r\nexplanations to be put upon matters of this kind. I know not what were\r\nthe merits of the case with respect to the person who was prosecuted for\r\nacting as prize master to a french privateer, but I know that the jury\r\ngave a verdict against the prosecution. The Rights I have acquired\r\nare dear to me. They have been acquired by honourable means, and by\r\ndangerous service in the worst of times, and I cannot passively permit\r\nthem to be wrested from me. I conceive it my duty to defend them, as the\r\ncase involves a constitutional and public question, which is, how\r\nfar the power of the federal government (1) extends, in depriving any\r\ncitizen of his Rights of Citizenship, or of suspending them.\r\n\r\nThat the explanation of National Treaties belongs to Congress is\r\nstrictly constitutional; but not the explanation of the Constitution\r\nitself, any more than the explanation of Law in the case of individual\r\ncitizens. These are altogether Judiciary questions. It is, however,\r\nworth observing, that Congress, in explaining the Article of the Treaty\r\nwith respect to french prizes and french privateers, confined itself\r\nstrictly to the letter of the Article. Let them explain the Article\r\nof the Constitution with respect to me in the same manner, and the\r\ndecision, did it appertain to them, could not deprive me of my Rights of\r\nCitizenship, or suspend them, for I have accepted nothing from any king,\r\nprince, state, or Government.\r\n\r\nYou will please to observe, that I speak as if the federal Government\r\nhad made some declaration upon the subject of my Citizenship; whereas\r\nthe fact is otherwise; and your saying that you have no order respecting\r\nme is a proof of it. Those therefore who propagate the report of my not\r\nbeing considered as a Citizen of America by Government, do it to the\r\nprolongation of my imprisonment, and without authority; for Congress,\r\n_as a government_, has neither decided upon it, nor yet taken the matter\r\ninto consideration; and I request you to caution such persons against\r\nspreading such reports. But be these matters as they may, I cannot have\r\na doubt that you find and feel the case very different, since you have\r\nheard what I have to say, and known what my situation is [better] than\r\nyou did before your arrival.\r\n\r\n     1 In the pamphlet occurs here a significant parenthesis by\r\n     Bache:  \"it should have been said in this case, how far the\r\n     Executive.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the Americans only, but the Convention also, that\r\nknew what my intentions were upon that subject. In my last discourse\r\ndelivered at the Tribune of the Convention, January 19,1793, on the\r\nmotion for suspending the execution of Louis 16th, I said (the Deputy\r\nBancal read the translation in French): \"It unfortunately happens that\r\nthe person who is the subject of the present discussion, is considered\r\nby the Americans as having been the friend of their revolution. His\r\nexecution will be an affliction to them, and it is in your power not\r\nto wound the feelings of your ally. Could I speak the french language I\r\nwould descend to your bar, and in their name become your petitioner to\r\nrespite the execution of the sentence/\"--\"As the convention was elected\r\nfor the express purpose of forming a Constitution, its continuance\r\ncannot be longer than four or five months more at furthest; and if,\r\nafter my _return to America_, I should employ myself in writing the\r\nhistory of the french Revolution, I had rather record a thousand\r\nerrors on the side of mercy, than be obliged to tell one act of severe\r\nJustice.\"--\"Ah Citizens! give not the tyrant of England the triumph\r\nof seeing the man perish on a scaffold who had aided my much-loved\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nDoes this look as if I had abandoned America? But if she abandons me\r\nin the situation I am in, to gratify the enemies of humanity, let that\r\ndisgrace be to herself. But I know the people of America better than to\r\nbelieve it,(1) tho' I undertake not to answer for every individual.\r\n\r\nWhen this discourse was pronounced, Marat launched himself into the\r\nmiddle of the hall and said that \"I voted against the punishment of\r\ndeath because I was a quaker.\" I replied that \"I voted against it both\r\nmorally and politically.\"\r\n\r\n     1 In the French pamphlet: \"pour jamais lui prêter du tels\r\n     sentiments.\"\r\n\r\nI certainly went a great way, considering the rage of the times, in\r\nendeavouring to prevent that execution. I had many reasons for so doing.\r\nI judged, and events have shewn that I judged rightly, that if they once\r\nbegan shedding blood, there was no knowing where it would end; and as\r\nto what the world might call _honour_ the execution would appear like a\r\nnation killing a mouse; and in a political view, would serve to transfer\r\nthe hereditary claim to some more formidable Enemy. The man could do no\r\nmore mischief; and that which he had done was not only from the vice of\r\nhis education, but was as much the fault of the Nation in restoring\r\nhim after he had absconded June 21st, 1791, as it was his. I made\r\nthe proposal for imprisonment until the end of the war and perpetual\r\nbanishment after the war, instead of the punishment of death. Upwards of\r\nthree hundred members voted for that proposal. The sentence for absolute\r\ndeath (for some members had voted the punishment of death conditionally)\r\nwas carried by a majority of twenty-five out of more than seven hundred.\r\n\r\nI return from this digression to the proper subject of my memorial.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This and the preceding five paragraphs, and five following\r\n     the nest, are omitted from the American pamphlet.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nPainful as the want of liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to\r\nbelieve, that my imprisonment proves to the world, that I had no share\r\nin the murderous system that then reigned. That I was an enemy to it,\r\nboth morally and politically, is known to all who had any knowledge of\r\nme; and could I have written french as well as I can English, I would\r\npublicly have exposed its wickedness and shewn the ruin with which it\r\nwas pregnant. They who have esteemed me on former occasions, whether in\r\nAmerica or in Europe will, I know, feel no cause to abate that esteem,\r\nwhen they reflect, that _imprisonment with preservation of character is\r\npreferable to liberty with disgrace_.\r\n\r\nI here close my Memorial and proceed to offer you a proposal that\r\nappears to me suited to all the circumstances of the case; which is,\r\nthat you reclaim me conditionally, until the opinion of Congress can be\r\nobtained on the subject of my citizenship of America; and that I remain\r\nin liberty under your protection during that time.\r\n\r\nI found this proposal upon the following grounds.\r\n\r\nFirst, you say you have no orders respecting me; consequently, you\r\nhave no orders _not_ to reclaim me; and in this case you are left\r\ndiscretionary judge whether to reclaim or not. My proposal therefore\r\nunites a consideration of your situation with my own.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I am put in arrestation because I am a foreigner. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to determine to what country I belong. The right of\r\ndetermining this question cannot appertain exclusively to the Committee\r\nof Public Safety or General Surety; because I appeal to the Minister of\r\nthe United States, and show that my citizenship of that country is good\r\nand valid, referring at the same time, thro' the agency of the Minister,\r\nmy claim of right to the opinion of Congress. It being a matter between\r\ntwo Governments.\r\n\r\nThirdly. France does not claim me fora citizen; neither do I set up any\r\nclaim of citizenship in France. The question is simply, whether I am\r\nor am not a citizen of America. I am imprisoned here on the decree for\r\nimprisoning foreigners, because, say they, I was born in England. I\r\nsay in answer that, though born in England, I am not a subject of the\r\nEnglish Government any more than any other American who was born, as\r\nthey all were, under the same Government, or than the Citizens of France\r\nare subjects of the French Monarchy under which they were born. I have\r\ntwice taken the oath of abjuration to the British King and Government\r\nand of Allegiance to America,--once as a citizen of the State of\r\nPennsylvania in 1776, and again before Congress, administered to me by\r\nthe President, Mr. Hancock, when I was appointed Secretary in the Office\r\nof Foreign Affairs in 1777.\r\n\r\nThe letter before quoted in the first page of this memorial, says, \"It\r\nwould be out of character for an American minister to interfere in the\r\ninternal affairs of France.\" This goes on the idea that I am a citizen\r\nof France, and a member of the Convention, which is not the fact. The\r\nConvention have declared me to be a foreigner; and consequently the\r\ncitizenship and the election are null and void.(1) It also has the\r\nappearance of a Decision, that the article of the Constitution,\r\nrespecting grants made to American Citizens by foreign kings, princes,\r\nor states, is applicable to me; which is the very point in question,\r\nand against the application of which I contend. I state evidence to the\r\nMinister, to shew that I am not within the letter or meaning of that\r\nArticle; that it cannot operate against me; and I apply to him for the\r\nprotection that I conceive I have a right to ask and to receive. The\r\ninternal affairs of France are out of the question with respect to my\r\napplication or his interference. I ask it not as a citizen of France,\r\nfor I am not one: I ask it not as a member of the Convention, for I am\r\nnot one; both these, as before said, have been rendered null and void;\r\nI ask it not as a man against whom there is any accusation, for there\r\nis none; I ask it not as an exile from America, whose liberties I\r\nhave honourably and generously contributed to establish; I ask it as a\r\nCitizen of America, deprived of his liberty in France, under the plea of\r\nbeing a foreigner; and I ask it because I conceive I am entitled to it,\r\nupon every principle of Constitutional Justice and National honour.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 In the pamphlet: \"The Convention included me in the vote\r\n     for dismissing foreigners from the Convention, and the\r\n     Committees imprisoned me as a foreigner.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 All  previous editions of the pamphlet end with this\r\n     word.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBut tho' I thus positively assert my claim because I believe I have a\r\nright to do so, it is perhaps most eligible, in the present situation\r\nof things, to put that claim upon the footing I have already mentioned;\r\nthat is, that the Minister reclaims me conditionally until the opinion\r\nof Congress can be obtained on the subject of my citizenship of America,\r\nand that I remain in liberty under the protection of the Minister during\r\nthat interval.\r\n\r\nN. B. I should have added that as Gouverneur Morris could not inform\r\nCongress of the cause of my arrestation, as he knew it not himself, it\r\nis to be supposed that Congress was not enough acquainted with the case\r\nto give any directions respecting me when you came away.\r\n\r\nT.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\nLetters, hitherto unpublished, written by Paine to Monroe before his\r\nrelease on November 4., 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Luxembourg Mem Vendemaire, Old Style Oct 4th 1794\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I thank you for your very friendly and affectionate letter of\r\nthe 18th September which I did not receive till this morning.(1) It has\r\nrelieved my mind from a load of disquietude. You will easily suppose\r\nthat if the information I received had been exact, my situation was\r\nwithout hope. I had in that case neither section, department nor\r\nCountry, to reclaim me; but that is not all, I felt a poignancy of\r\ngrief, in having the least reason to suppose that America had so soon\r\nforgotten me who had never forgotten her.\r\n\r\nMr. Labonadaire, in a note of yesterday, directed me to write to the\r\nConvention. As I suppose this measure has been taken in concert with\r\nyou, I have requested him to shew you the letter, of which he will make\r\na translation to accompany the original.\r\n\r\n(I cannot see what motive can induce them to keep me in prison. It\r\nwill gratify the English Government and afflict the friends I have in\r\nAmerica. The supporters of the system of Terror might apprehend that if\r\nI was in liberty and in America I should publish the history of their\r\ncrimes, but the present persons who have overset that immoral System\r\nought to have no such apprehension. On the contrary, they ought to\r\nconsider me as one of themselves, at least as one of their friends. Had\r\nI been an insignificant character I had not been in arrestation. It was\r\nthe literary and philosophical reputation I had gained, in the world,\r\nthat made them my Enemies; and I am the victim of the principles, and\r\nif I may be permitted to say it, of the talents, that procured me the\r\nesteem of America. My character is the _secret_ of my arrestation.)\r\n\r\n     1 Printed in the letter to Washington, chap. XXII. The delay\r\n     of sixteen days in Monroe's letter was probably due to the\r\n     manouvres of Paine's enemies on the Committee of Public\r\n     Safety. He was released only after their removal from the\r\n     Committee, and the departure of Gouverneur Morris.--\r\n     _Editor._,\r\n\r\nIf the letter I have written be not covered by other authority than my\r\nown it will have no effect, for they already know all that I can say. On\r\nwhat ground do they pretend to deprive America of the service of any\r\nof her citizens without assigning a cause, or only the flimsy one of\r\nmy being born in England? Gates, were he here, might be arrested on the\r\nsame pretence, and he and Burgoyne be confounded together.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to give an opinion, but among other things\r\nthat occur to me, I think that if you were to say that, as it will be\r\nnecessary to you to inform the Government of America of my situation,\r\nyou require an explanation with the Committee upon that subject; that\r\nyou are induced to make this proposal not only out of esteem for the\r\ncharacter of the person who is the personal object of it, but because\r\nyou know that his arrestation will distress the Americans, and the more\r\nso as it will appear to them to be contrary to their ideas of civil and\r\nnational justice, it might perhaps have some effect. If the Committee\r\n[of Public Safety] will do nothing, it will be necessary to bring this\r\nmatter openly before the Convention, for I do most sincerely assure you,\r\nfrom the observations that I hear, and I suppose the same are made in\r\nother places, that the character of America lies under some reproach.\r\nAll the world knows that I have served her, and they see that I am still\r\nin prison; and you know that when people can form a conclusion upon a\r\nsimple fact, they trouble not themselves about reasons. I had rather\r\nthat America cleared herself of all suspicion of ingratitude, though I\r\nwere to be the victim.\r\n\r\nYou advise me to have patience, but I am fully persuaded that the longer\r\nI continue in prison the more difficult will be my liberation. There\r\nare two reasons for this: the one is that the present Committee, by\r\ncontinuing so long my imprisonment, will naturally suppose that my mind\r\nwill be soured against them, as it was against those who put me in, and\r\nthey will continue my imprisonment from the same apprehensions as the\r\nformer Committee did; the other reason is, that it is now about two\r\nmonths since your arrival, and I am still in prison. They will explain\r\nthis into an indifference upon my fate that will encourage them to\r\ncontinue my imprisonment. When I hear some people say that it is the\r\nGovernment of America that now keeps me in prison by not reclaiming me,\r\nand then pour forth a volley of execrations against her, I know not\r\nhow to answer them otherwise than by a direct denial which they do not\r\nappear to believe. You will easily conclude that whatever relates to\r\nimprisonments and liberations makes a topic of prison conversation;\r\nand as I am now the oldest inhabitant within these walls, except two\r\nor three, I am often the subject of their remarks, because from the\r\ncontinuance of my imprisonment they auger ill to themselves. You see I\r\nwrite you every thing that occurs to me, and I conclude with thanking\r\nyou again for your very friendly and affectionate letter, and am with\r\ngreat respect,\r\n\r\nYour's affectionately,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n(To day is the anniversary of the action at German Town. [October 4,\r\n1777.] Your letter has enabled me to contradict the observations before\r\nmentioned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Oct 13, 1794 Dear Sir: On the 28th of this Month (October) I shall\r\nhave suffered ten months imprisonment, to the dishonour of America as\r\nwell as of myself, and I speak to you very honestly when I say that my\r\npatience is exhausted. It is only my actual liberation that can make me\r\nbelieve it. Had any person told me that I should remain in prison two\r\nmonths after the arrival of a new Minister, I should have supposed that\r\nhe meant to affront me as an American. By the friendship and sympathy\r\nyou express in your letter you seem to consider my imprisonment as\r\nhaving connection only with myself, but I am certain that the inferences\r\nthat follow from it have relation also to the National character of\r\nAmerica, I already feel this in myself, for I no longer speak with pride\r\nof being a citizen of that country. Is it possible Sir that I should,\r\nwhen I am suffering unjust imprisonment under the very eye of her new\r\nMinister?\r\n\r\nWhile there was no Minister here (for I consider Morris as none) nobody\r\nwondered at my imprisonment, but now everybody wonders. The continuance\r\nof it under a change of diplomatic circumstances, subjects me to the\r\nsuspicion of having merited it, and also to the suspicion of having\r\nforfeited my reputation with America; and it subjects her at the same\r\ntime to the suspicion of ingratitude, or to the reproach of wanting\r\nnational or diplomatic importance. The language that some Americans\r\nhave held of my not being considered as an American citizen, tho'\r\ncontradicted by yourself, proceeds, I believe, from no other motive,\r\nthan the shame and dishonour they feel at the imprisonment of a\r\nfellow-citizen, and they adopt this apology, at my expence, to get rid\r\nof that disgrace. Is it not enough that I suffer imprisonment, but my\r\nmind also must be wounded and tortured with subjects of this kind? Did I\r\nreason from personal considerations only, independent of principles and\r\nthe pride of having practiced those principles honourably, I should be\r\ntempted to curse the day I knew America. By contributing to her liberty\r\nI have lost my own, and yet her Government beholds my situation in\r\nsilence. Wonder not, Sir, at the ideas I express or the language in\r\nwhich I express them. If I have a heart to feel for others I can feel\r\nalso for myself, and if I have anxiety for my own honour, I have it also\r\nfor a country whose suffering infancy I endeavoured to nourish and\r\nto which I have been enthusiastically attached. As to patience I have\r\npracticed it long--as long as it was honorable to do so, and when it\r\ngoes beyond that point it becomes meanness.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that you have attended to my imprisonment\r\nmore as a friend than as a Minister. As a friend I thank you for your\r\naffectionate attachment. As a Minister you have to look beyond me to the\r\nhonour and reputation of your Government; and your Countrymen, who have\r\naccustomed themselves to consider any subject in one line of thinking\r\nonly, more especially if it makes a strong [impression] upon them, as\r\nI believe my situation has made upon you, do not immediately see the\r\nmatters that have relation to it in another line; and it is to bring\r\nthese two into one point that I offer you these observations. A citizen\r\nand his country, in a case like mine, are so closely connected that the\r\ncase of one is the case of both.\r\n\r\nWhen you first arrived the path you had to pursue with respect to my\r\nliberation was simple. I was imprisoned as a foreigner; you knew that\r\nforeigner to be a citizen of America, and you knew also his character,\r\nand as such you should immediately have reclaimed him. You could lose\r\nnothing by taking strong ground, but you might lose much by taking an\r\ninferior one; but instead of this, which I conceive would have been the\r\nright line of acting, you left me in their hands on the loose intimation\r\nthat my liberation would take place without your direct interference,\r\nand you strongly recommended it to me to wait the issue. This is more\r\nthan seven weeks ago and I am still in prison. I suspect these people\r\nare trifling with you, and if they once believe they can do that, you\r\nwill not easily get any business done except what they wish to have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWhen I take a review of my whole situation--my circumstances ruined,\r\nmy health half destroyed, my person imprisoned, and the prospect of\r\nimprisonment still staring me in the face, can you wonder at the\r\nagony of my feelings? You lie down in safety and rise to plenty; it\r\nis otherwise with me; I am deprived of more than half the common\r\nnecessaries of life; I have not a candle to burn and cannot get one.\r\nFuel can be procured only in small quantities and that with great\r\ndifficulty and very dear, and to add to the rest, I am fallen into a\r\nrelapse and am again on the sick list. Did you feel the whole force of\r\nwhat I suffer, and the disgrace put upon America by this injustice done\r\nto one of her best and most affectionate citizens, you would not, either\r\nas a friend or Minister, rest a day till you had procured my liberation.\r\nIt is the work of two or three hours when you set heartily about\r\nit, that is, when you demand me as an American citizen, or propose a\r\nconference with the Committee upon that subject; or you may make it the\r\nwork of a twelve-month and not succeed. I know these people better than\r\nyou do.\r\n\r\nYou desire me to believe that \"you are placed here on a difficult\r\nTheatre with many important objects to attend to, and with but few to\r\nconsult with, and that it becomes you in pursuit of these to regulate\r\nyour conduct with respect to each, as to manner and time, as will in\r\nyour judgment be best calculated to accomplish the whole.\" As I know\r\nnot what these objects are I can say nothing to that point. But I have\r\nalways been taught to believe that the liberty of a Citizen was the\r\nfirst object of all free Governments, and that it ought not to give\r\npreference to, or be blended with, any other. It is that public object\r\nthat all the world can see, and which obtains an influence upon public\r\nopinion more than any other. This is not the case with the objects you\r\nallude to. But be those objects what they may, can you suppose you will\r\naccomplish them the easier by holding me in the back-ground, or making\r\nme only an accident in the negotiation? Those with whom you confer will\r\nconclude from thence that you do not feel yourself very strong upon\r\nthose points, and that you politically keep me out of sight in the\r\nmeantime to make your approach the easier.\r\n\r\nThere is one part in your letter that is equally as proper should be\r\ncommunicated to the Committee as to me, and which I conceive you are\r\nunder some diplomatic obligation to do. It is that part which you\r\nconclude by saying that \"_to the welfare of Thomas Paine the Americans\r\nare not and cannot be indifferent_.\" As it is impossible the Americans\r\ncan preserve their esteem for me and for my oppressors at the same\r\ntime, the injustice to me strikes at the popular part of the Treaty of\r\nAlliance. If it be the wish of the Committee to reduce the treaty to a\r\nmere skeleton of Government forms, they are taking the right method to\r\ndo it, and it is not improbable they will blame you afterwards for not\r\nin-forming them upon the subject. The disposition to retort has been so\r\nnotorious here, that you ought to be guarded against it at all points.\r\n\r\nYou say in your letter that you doubt whether the gentleman who informed\r\nme of the language held by some Americans respecting my citizenship of\r\nAmerica conveyed even his own ideas clearly upon the subject.(1) I know\r\nnot how this may be, but I believe he told me the truth. I received a\r\nletter a few days ago from a friend and former comrade of mine in which\r\nhe tells me, that all the Americans he converses with, say, that\r\nI should have been in liberty long ago if the Minister could have\r\nreclaimed me as an American citizen. When I compare this with the\r\ncounter-declarations in your letter I can explain the case no otherwise\r\nthan I have already done, that it is an apology to get rid of the shame\r\nand dishonour they feel at the imprisonment of an American citizen,\r\nand because they are not willing it should be supposed there is want\r\nof influence in the American Embassy. But they ought to see that this\r\nlanguage is injurious to me.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of this month Vendemaire I received a line from Mr. Beresford\r\nin which he tells me I shall be in liberty in two or three days, and\r\nthat he has this from good authority. On the 12th I received a note from\r\nMr. Labonadaire, written at the Bureau of the Concierge, in which he\r\ntells me of the interest you take in procuring my liberation, and that\r\nafter the steps that had been already taken that I ought to write to the\r\nConvention to demand my liberty _purely and simply_ as a citizen of the\r\nUnited States of America. He advised me to send the letter to him, and\r\nhe would translate it. I sent the letter inclosing at the same time\r\na letter to you. I have heard nothing since of the letter to the\r\nConvention. On the 17th I received a letter from my former comrade\r\nVanhuele, in which he says \"I am just come from Mr. Russell who had\r\nyesterday a conversation with your Minister and your liberation is\r\ncertain--you will be in liberty to-morrow.\" Vanhuele also adds, \"I find\r\nthe advice of Mr. Labonadaire good, for tho' you have some enemies in\r\nthe Convention, the strongest and best part are in your favour.\" But\r\nthe case is, and I felt it whilst I was writing the letter to the\r\nConvention, that there is an awkwardness in my appearing, you being\r\npresent; for every foreigner should apply thro' his Minister, or rather\r\nhis Minister for him.\r\n\r\n     1 The letter of Peter Whiteside, quoted at the beginning of\r\n     the Memorial.

It would\r\n     seem from this whole letter that it was not known by\r\n     Americans in Paris that Monroe had been kept ont of his\r\n     office by Morris for nearly a month after his arrival in\r\n     Paris.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nWhen I thus see day after day and month after month, and promise after\r\npromise, pass away without effect, what can I conclude but that either\r\nthe Committees are secretly determined not to let me go, or that the\r\nmeasures you take are not pursued with the vigor necessary to give them\r\neffect; or that the American National character is without sufficient\r\nimportance in the French Republic? The latter will be gratifying to\r\nthe English Government. In short, Sir, the case is now arrived to that\r\ncrisis, that for the sake of your own reputation as a Minister you ought\r\nto require a positive answer from the Committee. As to myself, it is\r\nmore agreeable to me now to contemplate an honourable destruction, and\r\nto perish in the act of protesting against the injustice I suffer,\r\nand to caution the people of America against confiding too much in the\r\nTreaty of Alliance, violated as it has been in every principle, and in\r\nmy imprisonment though an American Citizen, than remain in the wretched\r\ncondition I am. I am no longer of any use to the world or to myself.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when I beheld the Revolution of the 10th. Thermidor\r\n[the fall of Robespierre] with enthusiasm. It was the first news\r\nmy comrade Vanhuele communicated to me during my illness, and it\r\ncontributed to my recovery. But there is still something rotten at the\r\nCenter, and the Enemies that I have, though perhaps not numerous, are\r\nmore active than my friends. If I form a wrong opinion of men or things\r\nit is to you I must look to set me right. You are in possession of the\r\nsecret. I know nothing of it. But that I may be guarded against as many\r\nwants as possible I shall set about writing a memorial to Congress,\r\nanother to the State of Pennsylvania, and an address to the people of\r\nAmerica; but it will be difficult for me to finish these until I know\r\nfrom yourself what applications you have made for my liberation, and\r\nwhat answers you have received.\r\n\r\nAh, Sir, you would have gotten a load of trouble and difficulties off\r\nyour hands that I fear will multiply every day, had you made it a point\r\nto procure my liberty when you first arrived, and not left me floating\r\non the promises of men whom you did not know. You were then a new\r\ncharacter. You had come in consequence of their own request that Morris\r\nshould be recalled; and had you then, before you opened any subject\r\nof negociation that might arise into controversy, demanded my liberty\r\neither as a Civility or as a Right I see not how they could have refused\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have already said that after all the promises that have been made I\r\nam still in prison. I am in the dark upon all the matters that relate\r\nto myself. I know not if it be to the Convention, to the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety, of General Surety, or to the deputies who come\r\nsometimes to the Luxembourg to examine and put persons in liberty, that\r\napplications have been made for my liberation. But be it to whom it\r\nmay, my earnest and pressing request to you as Minister is that you\r\nwill bring this matter to a conclusion by reclaiming me as an American\r\ncitizen imprisoned in France under the plea of being a foreigner born in\r\nEngland; that I may know the result, and how to prepare the Memorials\r\nI have mentioned, should there be occasion for them. The right of\r\ndetermining who are American citizens can belong only to America. The\r\nConvention have declared I am not a French Citizen because she has\r\ndeclared me to be a foreigner, and have by that declaration cancelled\r\nand annulled the vote of the former assembly that conferred the Title\r\nof Citizen upon Citizens or subjects of other Countries. I should not be\r\nhonest to you nor to myself were I not to express myself as I have done\r\nin this letter, and I confide and request you will accept it in that\r\nsense and in no other.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your suffering fellow-citizen,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nP. S.--If my imprisonment is to continue, and I indulge very little hope\r\nto the contrary, I shall be under the absolute necessity of applying\r\nto you for a supply of several articles. Every person here have their\r\nfamilies or friends upon the spot who make provision for them. This is\r\nnot the case with me; I have no person I can apply to but the American\r\nMinister, and I can have no doubt that if events should prevent\r\nmy repaying the expence Congress or the State of Pennsylvania will\r\ndischarge it for me.\r\n\r\nTo day is 22 Vendemaire Monday October 13, but you will not receive this\r\nletter till the 14th. I will send the bearer to you again on the 15th,\r\nWednesday, and I will be obliged to you to send me for the present,\r\nthree or four candles, a little sugar of any kind, and some soap for\r\nshaving; and I should be glad at the same time to receive a line from\r\nyou and a memorandum of the articles. Were I in your place I would order\r\na Hogshead of Sugar, some boxes of Candles and Soap from America, for\r\nthey will become still more scarce. Perhaps the best method for you\r\nto procure them at present is by applying to the American Consuls at\r\nBordeaux and Havre, and have them up by the diligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. [Undated.]\r\n\r\nDear Sir: As I have not yet received any answer to my last, I have\r\namused myself with writing you the inclosed memoranda. Though\r\nyou recommend patience to me I cannot but feel very pointedly the\r\nuncomfortableness of my situation, and among other reflections that\r\noccur to me I cannot think that America receives any credit from the\r\nlong imprisonment that I suffer. It has the appearance of neglecting\r\nher citizens and her friends and of encouraging the insults of foreign\r\nnations upon them, and upon her commerce. My imprisonment is as well\r\nand perhaps more known in England than in France, and they (the English)\r\nwill not be intimidated from molesting an American ship when they see\r\nthat one of her best citizens (for I have a right to call myself so) can\r\nbe imprisoned in another country at the mere discretion of a Committee,\r\nbecause he is a foreigner.\r\n\r\nWhen you first arrived every body congratulated me that I should soon,\r\nif not immediately, be in liberty. Since that time about two hundred\r\nhave been set free from this prison on the applications of their\r\nsections or of individuals--and I am continually hurt by the\r\nobservations that are made--\"that a section in Paris has more influence\r\nthan America.\"\r\n\r\nIt is right that I furnish you with these circumstances. It is the\r\neffect of my anxiety that the character of America suffer no reproach;\r\nfor the world knows that I have acted a generous duty by her. I am the\r\nthird American that has been imprisoned. Griffiths nine weeks, Haskins\r\nabout five, and myself eight [months] and yet in prison. With respect\r\nto the two former there was then no Minister, for I consider Morris as\r\nnone; and they were liberated on the applications of the Americans in\r\nParis. As to myself I had rather be publicly and honorably reclaimed,\r\ntho' the reclamation was refused, than remain in the uncertain situation\r\nthat I am. Though my health has suffered my spirits are not broken. I\r\nhave nothing to fear unless innocence and fortitude be crimes. America,\r\nwhatever may be my fate, will have no cause to blush for me as a\r\ncitizen; I hope I shall have none to blush for her as a country. If, my\r\ndear Sir, there is any-thing in the perplexity of ideas I have mistaken,\r\nonly suppose yourself in my situation, and you will easily find an\r\nexcuse for it. I need not say how much I shall rejoice to pay my\r\nrespects to you without-side the walls of this prison, and to enquire\r\nafter my American friends. But I know that nothing can be\r\naccomplished here but by unceasing perseverance and application. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. October 20, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I recd. your friendly letter of the 26 Vendemaire on the day\r\nit was written, and I thank you for communicating to me your opinion\r\nupon my case. Ideas serve to beget ideas, and as it is from a review of\r\nevery thing that can be said upon a subject, or is any ways connected\r\nwith it, that the best judgment can be formed how to proceed, I present\r\nyou with such ideas as occur to me. I am sure of one thing, which is\r\nthat you will give them a patient and attentive perusal.\r\n\r\nYou say in your letter that \"I must be sensible that although I am an\r\nAmerican citizen, yet if you interfere in my behalf as the Minister of\r\nmy country you must demand my liberation only in case there be no charge\r\nagainst me; and that if there is I must be brought to trial previously,\r\nsince no person in a _private_ character can be exempt from the laws of\r\nthe country in which he resides.\"--This is what I have twice attempted\r\nto do. I wrote a letter on the 3d Sans Culottodi(1) to the Deputies,\r\nmembers of the Committee of Surety General, who came to the Luxembourg\r\nto examine the persons detained. The letter was as follows:--\"Citizens\r\nRepresentatives: I offer myself for examination. Justice is due to every\r\nMan. It is Justice only that I ask.--Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was not called for examination, nor heard anything in consequence\r\nof my letter the first time of sending it, I sent a duplicate of it a\r\nfew days after. It was carried to them by my good friend and comrade\r\nVanhuele, who was then going in liberty, having been examined the day\r\nbefore. Vanhuele wrote me on the next day and said: \"Bourdon de l'Oise\r\n[who was one of the examining Deputies] is the most inveterate enemy you\r\ncan have. The answer he gave me when I presented your letter put me in\r\nsuch a passion with him that I expected I should be sent back again\r\nto prison.\" I then wrote a third letter but had not an opportunity of\r\nsending it, as Bourdon did not come any more till after I received Mr.\r\nLabonadaire's letter advising me to write to the Convention. The letter\r\nwas as follows:--\"Citizens, I have twice offered myself for examination,\r\nand I chose to do this while Bourdon de l'Oise was one of the\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\n     1 Festival of Labour, September 19, 1794.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThis Deputy has said in the Convention that I intrigued with an ancient\r\nagent of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs. My examination therefore while\r\nhe is present will give him an opportunity of proving his charge or of\r\nconvincing himself of his error. If Bourdon de l'Oise is an honest man\r\nhe will examine me, but lest he should not I subjoin the following. That\r\nwhich B[ourdon] calls an intrigue was at the request of a member of the\r\nformer Committee of Salut Public, last August was a twelvemonth. I met\r\nthe member on the Boulevard. He asked me something in French which I\r\ndid not understand and we went together to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs\r\nwhich was near at hand. The Agent (Otto, whom you probably knew in\r\nAmerica) served as interpreter, The member (it was Barère) then asked\r\nme 1st, If I could furnish him with the plan of Constitution I had\r\npresented to the Committee of Constitution of which I was member with\r\nhimself, because, he said, it contained several things which he\r\nwished had been adopted: 2dly, He asked me my opinion upon sending\r\nCommissioners to the United States of America: 3dly, If fifty or an\r\nhundred ship loads of flour could be procured from America. As verbal\r\ninterpretation was tedious, it was agreed that I should give him my\r\nopinion in writing, and that the Agent [Otto] should translate it, which\r\nhe did. I answered the first question by sending him the plan [of\r\na Constitution] which he still has. To the second, I replied that\r\nI thought it would be proper to send Commissioners, because that in\r\nRevolutions circumstances change so fast that it was often necessary\r\nto send a better supply of information to an Ally than could be\r\ncommunicated by writing; and that Congress had done the same thing\r\nduring the American War; and I gave him some information that the\r\nCommissioners would find useful on their arrival. I answered the third\r\nquestion by sending him a list of American exports two years before,\r\ndistinguishing the several articles by which he would see that the\r\nsupply he mentioned could be obtained. I sent him also the plan of Paul\r\nJones, giving it as his, for procuring salt-petre, which was to send\r\na squadron (it did not require a large one) to take possession of the\r\nIsland of St. Helen's, to keep the English flag flying at the port,\r\nthat the English East India ships coming from the East Indies, and that\r\nballast with salt-petre, might be induced to enter as usual; And that it\r\nwould be a considerable time before the English Government could know\r\nof what had happened at St. Helen's. See here what Bourdon de l'Oise has\r\ncalled an intrigue.--If it was an intrigue it was between a Committee of\r\nSalut Public and myself, for the Agent was no more than the interpreter\r\nand translator, and the object of the intrigue was to furnish France\r\nwith flour and salt-petre.\"--I suppose Bourdon had heard that the agent\r\nand I were seen together talking English, and this was enough for _him_\r\nto found his charge upon.(1)\r\n\r\nYou next say that \"I must likewise be sensible that although I am an\r\nAmerican citizen that it is likewise believed there [in America] that\r\nI am become a citizen of France, and that in consequence this latter\r\ncharacter has so far [illegible] the former as to weaken if not destroy\r\nany claim you might have to interpose in my behalf.\" I am sorry I cannot\r\nadd any new arguments to those I have already advanced on this part of\r\nthe subject. But I cannot help asking myself, and I wish you would\r\nask the Committee, if it could possibly be the intention of France to\r\n_kidnap_ citizens from America under the pretence of dubbing them\r\nwith the title of French citizens, and then, after inviting or rather\r\nenveigling them into France, make it a pretence for detaining them? If\r\nit was, (which I am sure it was not, tho' they now act as if it was) the\r\ninsult was to America, tho' the injury was to me, and the treachery was\r\nto both.\r\n\r\n     1 The communications of Paine to Barère are given in my\r\n     \"Life of Paine,\" vol. ii-i PP. 73, 87. Otto was Secretary to\r\n     the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he acted as interpreter\r\n     between Paine and Barère. There was never any charge at all\r\n     made against Paine, as the Archives of France now prove,\r\n     save that he was a \"foreigner.\" Paine was of coarse ignorant\r\n     of the conspiracy between Morris and Deforgues which had\r\n     imprisoned him. Bourdon de l'Oise, one of the most cruel\r\n     Jacobins and Terrorists, afterwards conspired with Pichegru\r\n     to overthrow the Republic, and was with him banished (1797)\r\n     to Sinamari, South America, where he died soon after his\r\n     arrival.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nDid they mean to kidnap General Washington, Mr. Madison, and several\r\nother Americans whom they dubbed with the same title as well as me? Let\r\nany man look at the condition of France when I arrived in it,--invaded\r\nby Austrians and Prussians and declared to be in danger,--and then ask\r\nif any man who had a home and a country to go to, as I had in America,\r\nwould have come amongst them from any other motive than of assisting\r\nthem. If I could possibly have supposed them capable of treachery\r\nI certainly would not have trusted myself in their power. Instead\r\ntherefore of your being unwilling or apprehensive of meeting the\r\nquestion of French citizenship, they ought to be ashamed of advancing\r\nit, and this will be the case unless you admit their arguments or\r\nobjections too passively. It is a case on their part fit only for\r\nthe continuations of Robespierre to set up. As to the name of French\r\ncitizen, I never considered it in any other light, so far as regarded\r\nmyself, than as a token of honorary respect. I never made them any\r\npromise nor took any oath of allegiance or of citizenship, nor bound\r\nmyself by an act or means whatever to the performance of any thing.\r\nI acted altogether as a friend invited among them as I supposed on\r\nhonorable terms. I did not come to join myself to a Government already\r\nformed, but to assist in forming one _de nouveau_, which was afterwards\r\nto be submitted to the people whether they would accept it or not, and\r\nthis any foreigner might do. And strictly speaking there are no citizens\r\nbefore this is a government. They are all of the People. The Americans\r\nwere not called citizens till after Government was established, and not\r\neven then until they had taken the oath of allegiance. This was the\r\ncase in Pennsylvania. But be this French citizenship more or less, the\r\nConvention have swept it away by declaring me to be a foreigner, and\r\nimprisoning me as such; and this is a short answer to all those who\r\naffect to say or to believe that I am French Citizen. A Citizen without\r\nCitizenship is a term non-descript.\r\n\r\nAfter the two preceeding paragraphs you ask--\"If it be my wish that you\r\nshould embark in this controversy (meaning that of reclaiming me)\r\nand risque the consequences with respect to myself and the good\r\nunderstanding subsisting between the two countries, or, without\r\nrelinquishing any point of right, and which might be insisted on in\r\ncase of extremities, pursue according to your best judgment and with the\r\nlight before you, the object of my liberation?\"\r\n\r\nAs I believe from the apparent obstinacy of the Committees that\r\ncircumstances will grow towards the extremity you mention, unless\r\nprevented beforehand, I will endeavour to throw into your hands all the\r\nlights I can upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, reclamation may mean two distinct things. All the\r\nreclamations that are made by the sections in behalf of persons detained\r\nas _suspect_ are made on the ground that the persons so detained are\r\npatriots, and the reclamation is good against the charge of \"suspect\"\r\nbecause it proves the contrary. But my situation includes another\r\ncircumstance. I am imprisoned on the charge (if it can be called one)\r\nof being a foreigner born in England. You know that foreigner to be a\r\ncitizen of the United States of America, and that he has been such since\r\nthe 4th of July 1776, the political birthday of the United States,\r\nand of every American citizen, for before that period all were British\r\nsubjects, and the States, then provinces, were British dominions.--Your\r\nreclamation of me therefore as a citizen of the United States (all other\r\nconsiderations apart) is good against the pretence for imprisoning me,\r\nor that pretence is equally good against every American citizen born\r\nin England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, or Holland, and you know this\r\ndescription of men compose a very great part of the population of the\r\nthree States of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and make also a\r\npart of Congress, and of the State Legislatures.\r\n\r\nEvery politician ought to know, and every civilian does know, that the\r\nLaw of Treaty of Alliance, and also that of Amity and Commerce knows no\r\ndistinction of American Citizens on account of the place of their birth,\r\nbut recognizes all to be Citizens whom the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States of America recognize as such; and if I recollect rightly\r\nthere is an article in the Treaty of Commerce particular to this\r\npoint. The law therefore which they have here, to put all persons in\r\narrestation born in any of the Countries at war with France, is, when\r\napplied to Citizens of America born in England, Ireland, Scotland,\r\nGermany, or holland, a violation of the treaties of Alliance and of\r\nCommerce, because it assumes to make a distinction of Citizens which\r\nthose Treaties and the Constitution of America know nothing of. This is\r\na subject that officially comes under your cognizance as Minister, and\r\nit would be consistent that you expostulated with them upon the Case.\r\nThat foolish old man Vadier, who was president of the Convention and of\r\nthe Committee of Surety general when the Americans then in Paris went\r\nto the Bar of the Convention to reclaim me, gave them for answer that\r\nmy being born in England was cause sufficient for imprisoning me. It\r\nhappened that at least half those who went up with that address were in\r\nthe same case with myself.\r\n\r\nAs to reclamations on the ground of Patriotism it is difficult to know\r\nwhat is to be understood by Patriotism here. There is not a vice, and\r\nscarcely a virtue, that has not as the fashion of the moment suited\r\nbeen called by the name of Patriotism. The wretches who composed the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal of Nantz were the Patriots of that day and the\r\ncriminals of this. The Jacobins called themselves Patriots of the first\r\norder, men up to the height of the circumstances, and they are now\r\nconsidered as an antidote to Patriotism. But if we give to Patriotism a\r\nfixed idea consistent with that of a Republic, it would signify a strict\r\nadherence to the principles of Moral Justice, to the equality of civil\r\nand political Rights, to the System of representative Government, and an\r\nopposition to every hereditary claim to govern; and of this species\r\nof Patriotism you know my character. But, Sir, there are men on the\r\nCommittee who have changed their Party but not their principles. Their\r\naim is to hold power as long as possible by preventing the establishment\r\nof a Constitution, and these men are and will be my Enemies, and seek to\r\nhold me in prison as long as they can. I am too good a Patriot for them.\r\nIt is not improbable that they have heard of the strange language held\r\nby some Americans that I am not considered in America as an American\r\ncitizen, and they may also have heard say, that you had no orders\r\nrespecting me, and it is not improbable that they interpret that\r\nlanguage and that silence into a connivance at my imprisonment. If they\r\nhad not some ideas of this kind would they resist so long the civil\r\nefforts you make for my liberation, or would they attach so much\r\nimportance to the imprisonment of an Individual as _to risque_ (as\r\nyou say to me) _the good understanding that exists between the two\r\nCountries?_You also say that _it is impossible for any person to do more\r\nthan you have done without adopting the other means_, meaning that of\r\nreclaiming me. How then can you account for the want of success after so\r\nmany efforts, and such a length of time, upwards of ten weeks, without\r\nsupposing that they fortify themselves in the interpretation I have just\r\nmentioned? I can admit that it was not necessary to give orders, and\r\nthat it was difficult to give direct orders, for I much question if\r\nMorris had informed Congress or the President of the whole of the case,\r\nor had sent copies of my letters to him as I had desired him to do.\r\nYou would find the case here when you came, and you could not fully\r\nunderstand it till you did come, and as Minister you would have\r\nauthority to act upon it. But as you inform me that you know what the\r\nwishes of the President are, you will see also that his reputation is\r\nexposed to some risque, admitting there to be ground for the supposition\r\nI have made. It will not add to his popularity to have it believed in\r\nAmerica, as I am inclined to think the Committee believe here, that he\r\nconnives at my imprisonment. You say also that _it is known to everybody\r\nthat you wish my liberation_. It is, Sir, because they know your wishes\r\nthat they misinterpret the means you use. They suppose that those mild\r\nmeans arise from a restriction that you cannot use others, or from a\r\nconsciousness of some defect on my part of which you are unwilling to\r\nprovoke the enquiry.\r\n\r\nBut as you ask me if it be my wish that you should embark in this\r\ncontroversy and risque the consequences with respect to myself, I will\r\nanswer this part of the question by marking out precisely the part I\r\nwish you to take. What I mean is a sort of middle line above what you\r\nhave yet gone, and not up to the full extremity of the case, which will\r\nstill lie in reserve. It is to write a letter to the Committee that\r\nshall in the first place defeat by anticipation all the objections they\r\nmight make to a simple reclamation, and at the same time make the ground\r\ngood for that object. But, instead of sending the letter immediately, to\r\ninvite some of the Committee to your house and to make that invitation\r\nthe opportunity of shewing them the letter, expressing at the same time\r\na wish that you had done this, from a hope that the business might be\r\nsettled in an amicable manner without your being forced into an official\r\ninterference, that would excite the observations of the Enemies of both\r\nCountries, and probably interrupt the harmony that subsisted between the\r\ntwo republics. But as I can not convey the ideas I wish you to use by\r\nany means so concisely or so well as to suppose myself the writer of the\r\nletter I shall adopt this method and you will make use of such parts or\r\nsuch ideas of it as you please if you approve the plan. Here follows the\r\nsupposed letter:\r\n\r\nCitizens: When I first arrived amongst you as Minister from the United\r\nStates of America I was given to understand that the liberation of\r\nThomas Paine would take place without any official interference on my\r\npart. This was the more agreeable to me as it would not only supercede\r\nthe necessity of that interference, but would leave to yourselves the\r\nwhole opportunity of doing justice to a man who as far as I have been\r\nable to learn has suffered much cruel treatment under what you have\r\ndenominated the system of Terror. But as I find my expectations have not\r\nbeen fulfilled I am under the official necessity of being more explicit\r\nupon the subject than I have hitherto been.\r\n\r\nPermit me, in the first place, to observe that as it is impossible for\r\nme to suppose that it could have been the intention of France to seduce\r\nany citizens of America from their allegiance to their proper country\r\nby offering them the title of French citizen, so must I be compelled to\r\nbelieve, that the title of French citizen conferred on Thomas Paine was\r\nintended only as a mark of honorary respect towards a man who had\r\nso eminently distinguished himself in defence of liberty, and on no\r\noccasion more so than in promoting and defending your own revolution.\r\nFor a proof of this I refer you to his two works entitled _Rights of\r\nMan_. Those works have procured to him an addition of esteem in America,\r\nand I am sorry they have been so ill rewarded in France. But be this\r\ntitle of French Citizen more or less, it is now entirely swept away by\r\nthe vote of the Convention which declares him to be a foreigner, and\r\nwhich supercedes the vote of the Assembly that conferred that title upon\r\nhim, consequently upon the case superceded with it.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this vote of the Convention declaring him to be a\r\nforeigner the former Committees have imprisoned him. It is therefore\r\nbecome my official duty to declare to you that the foreigner thus\r\nimprisoned is a citizen of the United States of America as fully, as\r\nlegally, as constitutionally as myself, and that he is moreover one of\r\nthe principal founders of the American Republic.\r\n\r\nI have been informed of a law or decree of the Convention which\r\nsubjects foreigners born in any of the countries at war with France\r\nto arrestation and imprisonment. This law when applied to citizens of\r\nAmerica born in England is an infraction of the Treaty of Alliance and\r\nof Amity and Commerce, which knows no distinction of American citizens\r\non account of the place of their birth, but recognizes all to be\r\ncitizens whom the Constitution and laws of America recognize as such.\r\nThe circumstances under which America has been peopled requires this\r\nguard on her Treaties, because the mass of her citizens are composed not\r\nof natives only but also of the natives of almost all the countries\r\nof Europe who have sought an asylum there from the persecutions they\r\nexperienced in their own countries. After this intimation you will\r\nwithout doubt see the propriety of modelling that law to the principles\r\nof the Treaty, because the law of Treaty in cases where it applies is\r\nthe governing law to both parties alike, and it cannot be infracted\r\nwithout hazarding the existence of the Treaty.\r\n\r\nOf the Patriotism of Thomas Paine I can speak fully, if we agree to give\r\nto patriotism a fixed idea consistent with that of a republic. It would\r\nthen signify a strict adherence to Moral Justice, to the equality of\r\ncivil and political rights, to the system of representative government,\r\nand an opposition to all hereditary claims to govern. Admitting\r\npatriotism to consist in these principles, I know of no man who has gone\r\nbeyond Thomas Paine in promulgating and defending them, and that for\r\nalmost twenty years past.\r\n\r\nI have now spoken to you on the principal matters concerned in the case\r\nof Thomas Paine. The title of French citizen which you had enforced upon\r\nhim, you have since taken away by declaring him to be a foreigner, and\r\nconsequently this part of the subject ceases of itself. I have declared\r\nto you that this foreigner is a citizen of the United States of America,\r\nand have assured you of his patriotism.\r\n\r\nI cannot help at the same time repeating to you my wish that his\r\nliberation had taken place without my being obliged to go thus far into\r\nthe subject, because it is the mutual interest of both republics to\r\navoid as much as possible all subjects of controversy, especially those\r\nfrom which no possible good can flow. I still hope that you will save me\r\nthe unpleasant task of proceeding any farther by sending me an order\r\nfor his liberation, which the injured state of his health absolutely\r\nrequires. I shall be happy to receive such an order from you and\r\nhappy in presenting it to him, for to the welfare of Thomas Paine the\r\nAmericans are not and cannot be indifferent.\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of letter I wish you to write, for I have no idea that\r\nyou will succeed by any measures that can, by any kind of construction,\r\nbe interpreted into a want of confidence or an apprehension of\r\nconsequences. It is themselves that ought to be apprehensive of\r\nconsequences if any are to be apprehended. They, I mean the Committees,\r\nare not certain that the Convention or the nation would support them\r\nin forcing any question to extremity that might interrupt the good\r\nunderstanding subsisting between the two countries; and I know of no\r\nquestion [so likely] to do this as that which involves the rights and\r\nliberty of a citizen.\r\n\r\nYou will please to observe that I have put the case of French\r\ncitizenship in a point of view that ought not only to preclude, but to\r\nmake them ashamed to advance any thing upon this subject; and this is\r\nbetter than to have to answer their counter-reclamation afterwards.\r\nEither the Citizenship was intended as a token of honorary respect, or\r\nit was in-tended to deprive America of a citizen or to seduce him from\r\nhis allegiance to his proper country. If it was intended as an honour\r\nthey must act consistently with the principle of honour. But if they\r\nmake a pretence for detaining me, they convict themselves of the act\r\nof seduction. Had America singled out any particular French citizen,\r\ncomplimented him with the title of Citizen of America, which he without\r\nsuspecting any fraudulent intention might accept, and then after having\r\ninvited or rather inveigled him into America made his acceptance of\r\nthat Title a pretence for seducing or forcing him from his allegiance to\r\nFrance, would not France have just cause to be offended at America? And\r\nought not America to have the same right to be offended at France? And\r\nwill the Committees take upon themselves to answer for the dishonour\r\nthey bring upon the National Character of their Country? If these\r\narguments are stated beforehand they will prevent the Committees going\r\ninto the subject of French Citizenship. They must be ashamed of it.\r\nBut after all the case comes to this, that this French Citizenship\r\nappertains no longer to me because the Convention, as I have already\r\nsaid, have swept it away by declaring me to be foreigner, and it is not\r\nin the power of the Committees to reverse it. But if I am to be citizen\r\nand foreigner, and citizen again, just when and how and for any purpose\r\nthey please, they take the Government of America into their own hands\r\nand make her only a Cypher in their system.\r\n\r\nThough these ideas have been long with me they have been more\r\nparticularly matured by reading your last Communication, and I have\r\nmany reasons to wish you had opened that Communication sooner. I am best\r\nacquainted with the persons you have to deal with and the circumstances\r\nof my own case. If you chuse to adopt the letter as it is, I send you a\r\ntranslation for the sake of expediting the business. I have endeavoured\r\nto conceive your own manner of expression as well as I could, and the\r\ncivility of language you would use, but the matter of the letter is\r\nessential to me.\r\n\r\nIf you chuse to confer with some of the members of the Committee at\r\nyour own house on the subject of the letter it may render the sending it\r\nunnecessary; but in either case I must request and press you not to give\r\naway to evasion and delay, and that you will fix positively with them\r\nthat they shall give you an answer in three or four days whether they\r\nwill liberate me on the representation you have made in the letter, or\r\nwhether you must be forced to go further into the subject. The state of\r\nmy health will not admit of delay, and besides the tortured state of\r\nmy mind wears me down. If they talk of bringing me to trial (and I well\r\nknow there is no accusation against me and that they can bring none)\r\nI certainly summons you as an Evidence to my Character. This you may\r\nmention to them either as what I intend to do or what you intend to do\r\nvoluntarily for me.\r\n\r\nI am anxious that you undertake this business without losing time,\r\nbecause if I am not liberated in the course of this decade, I intend, if\r\nin case the seventy-one detained deputies are liberated, to follow the\r\nsame track that they have done, and publish my own case myself.(1)\r\nI cannot rest any longer in this state of miserable suspense, be the\r\nconsequences what they may.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n     1 Those deputies, imprisoned for having protested against\r\n     the overthrow of the Girondin government, May 31,1793, when\r\n     the Convention was invaded and overawed by the armed\r\n     communes of Paris. These deputies were liberated and\r\n     recalled to the Convention, December 8, 1794. Paine was\r\n     invited to resume his seat the day before, by a special act\r\n     of the Convention, after an eloquent speech by Thibaudeau.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I need not mention to you the happiness I received from the\r\ninformation you sent me by Mr. Beresford. I easily guess the persons\r\nyou have conversed with on the subject of my liberation--but matters\r\nand even promises that pass in conversation are not quite so strictly\r\nattended to here as in the Country you come from. I am not, my Dear Sir,\r\nimpatient from any thing in my disposition, but the state of my health\r\nrequires liberty and a better air; and besides this, the rules of the\r\nprison do not permit me, though I have all the indulgences the Concierge\r\ncan give, to procure the things necessary to my recovery, which is\r\nslow as to strength. I have a tolerable appetite but the allowance of\r\nprovision is scanty. We are not allowed a knife to cut our victuals\r\nwith, nor a razor to shave; but they have lately allowed some barbers\r\nthat are here to shave. The room where I am lodged is a ground floor\r\nlevel with the earth in the garden and floored with brick, and is so\r\nwet after every rain that I cannot guard against taking colds that\r\ncontinually cheat my recovery. If you could, without interfering with or\r\nderanging the mode proposed for my liberation, inform the Committee that\r\nthe state of my health requires liberty and air, it would be good ground\r\nto hasten my liberation. The length of my imprisonment is also a reason,\r\nfor I am now almost the oldest inhabitant of this uncomfortable mansion,\r\nand I see twenty, thirty and sometimes forty persons a day put in\r\nliberty who have not been so long confined as myself. Their liberation\r\nis a happiness to me; but I feel sometimes, a little mortification\r\nthat I am thus left behind. I leave it entirely to you to arrange this\r\nmatter. The messenger waits. Your's affectionately,\r\n\r\nT. P.\r\n\r\nI hope and wish much to see you. I have much to say. I have had the\r\nattendance of Dr. Graham (Physician to Genl. O'Hara, who is prisoner\r\nhere) and of Dr. Makouski, house physician, who has been most\r\nexceedingly kind to me. After I am at liberty I shall be glad to\r\nintroduce him to you.\r\n\r\n     1 This letter, written in a feeble handwriting, is not\r\n     dated, but Monroe's endorsement, \"2d. Luxembourg,\"\r\n     indicates November 2, two days before Paine's liberation.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. LETTER TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, July 30, 1796.\r\n\r\nAs censure is but awkwardly softened by apology. I shall offer you\r\nno apology for this letter. The eventful crisis to which your double\r\npolitics have conducted the affairs of your country, requires an\r\ninvestigation uncramped by ceremony.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the fame of America, moral and political, stood\r\nfair and high in the world. The lustre of her revolution extended itself\r\nto every individual; and to be a citizen of America gave a title to\r\nrespect in Europe. Neither meanness nor ingratitude had been mingled\r\nin the composition of her character. Her resistance to the attempted\r\ntyranny of England left her unsuspected of the one, and her open\r\nacknowledgment of the aid she received from France precluded all\r\nsuspicion of the other. The Washington of politics had not then\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nAt the time I left America (April 1787) the Continental Convention, that\r\nformed the federal Constitution was on the point of meeting. Since that\r\ntime new schemes of politics, and new distinctions of parties, have\r\narisen. The term _Antifederalist_ has been applied to all those who\r\ncombated the defects of that constitution, or opposed the measures\r\nof your administration. It was only to the absolute necessity of\r\nestablishing some federal authority, extending equally over all the\r\nStates, that an instrument so inconsistent as the present federal\r\nConstitution is, obtained a suffrage. I would have voted for it myself,\r\nhad I been in America, or even for a worse, rather than have had none,\r\nprovided it contained the means of remedying its defects by the same\r\nappeal to the people by which it was to be established. It is always\r\nbetter policy to leave removeable errors to expose themselves, than\r\nto hazard too much in contending against them theoretically. I have\r\nintroduced these observations, not only to mark the general difference\r\nbetween Antifederalist and Anti-constitutionalist, but to preclude\r\nthe effect, and even the application, of the former of these terms to\r\nmyself. I declare myself opposed to several matters in the Constitution,\r\nparticularly to the manner in which what is called the Executive is\r\nformed, and to the long duration of the Senate; and if I live to return\r\nto America, I will use all my endeavours to have them altered.(*) I also\r\ndeclare myself opposed to almost the whole of your administration; for\r\nI know it to have been deceitful, if not perfidious, as I shall shew\r\nin the course of this letter. But as to the point of consolidating the\r\nStates into a Federal Government, it so happens, that the proposition\r\nfor that purpose came originally from myself. I proposed it in a letter\r\nto Chancellor Livingston in the spring of 1782, while that gentleman\r\nwas Minister for Foreign Affairs. The five per cent, duty recommended\r\nby Congress had then fallen through, having been adopted by some of the\r\nStates, altered by others, rejected by Rhode Island, and repealed by\r\nVirginia after it had been consented to. The proposal in the letter I\r\nallude to, was to get over the whole difficulty at once, by annexing a\r\ncontinental legislative body to Congress; for in order to have any law\r\nof the Union uniform, the case could only be, that either Congress, as\r\nit then stood, must frame the law, and the States severally adopt it\r\nwithout alteration, or the States must erect a Continental Legislature\r\nfor the purpose. Chancellor Livingston, Robert Morris, Gouverneur\r\nMorris, and myself, had a meeting at the house of Robert Morris on\r\nthe subject of that letter. There was no diversity of opinion on the\r\nproposition for a Continental Legislature: the only difficulty was on\r\nthe manner of bringing the proposition forward. For my own part, as I\r\nconsidered it as a remedy in reserve, that could be applied at any time\r\n_when the States saw themselves wrong enough to be put right_, (which\r\ndid not appear to be the case at that time) I did not see the propriety\r\nof urging it precipitately, and declined being the publisher of it\r\nmyself. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will\r\nscarcely have the hardiness to apply to me the term of Antifederalist.\r\nBut I can go to a date and to a fact beyond this; for the proposition\r\nfor electing a continental convention to form the Continental Government\r\nis one of the subjects treated of in the pamphlet _Common Sense_.(1)\r\n\r\n     * I have always been opposed to the mode of refining\r\n     Government up to an individual, or what is called a single\r\n     Executive. Such a man will always be the chief of a party. A\r\n     plurality is far better: It combines the mass of a nation\r\n     better together: And besides this, it is necessary to the\r\n     manly mind of a republic that it loses the debasing idea of\r\n     obeying an individual.--_Author_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 See vol. i. of this work, pp. 97, 98, 109, no.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared away a little of the rubbish that might otherwise\r\nhave lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the present\r\nFederal Constitution and your administration began. It was very well\r\nsaid by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year before that\r\nperiod, that \"_thirteen staves and ne'er a hoop will not make a barrel_\"\r\nand as any kind of hooping the barrel, however defectively executed,\r\nwould be better than none, it was scarcely possible but that\r\nconsiderable advantages must arise from the federal hooping of the\r\nStates. It was with pleasure that every sincere friend of America\r\nbeheld, as the natural effect of union, her rising prosperity; and it\r\nwas with grief they saw that prosperity mixed, even in the blossom,\r\nwith the germ of corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your\r\nadministration almost in the moment of its commencement. The lands\r\nobtained by the revolution were lavished upon partisans; the interest\r\nof the disbanded soldier was sold to the speculator; injustice was acted\r\nunder the pretence of faith; and the chief of the army became the patron\r\nof the fraud.(2) From such a beginning what else could be expected, than\r\nwhat has happened? A mean and servile submission to the insults of one\r\nnation; treachery and ingratitude to another.\r\n\r\n     2 The history of the Scioto Company, by which so many\r\n     Frenchmen as well as Americans were ruined, warranted an\r\n     even stronger statement. Though Washington did not know what\r\n     was going on, he cannot be acquitted of a lack of due\r\n     precaution in patronizing leading agents of these\r\n     speculations, and introducing them in France.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nSome vices make their approach with such a splendid appearance, that we\r\nscarcely know to what class of moral distinctions they belong. They\r\nare rather virtues corrupted than vices, originally. But meanness and\r\ningratitude have nothing equivocal in their character. There is not a\r\ntrait in them that renders them doubtful. They are so originally vice,\r\nthat they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into\r\nexistence with the filth upon their back. The fugitives have found\r\nprotection in you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.\r\n\r\nAs the Federal Constitution is a copy, though not quite so base as the\r\noriginal, of the form of the British Government, an imitation of its\r\nvices was naturally to be expected. So intimate is the connection\r\nbetween _form and practice_, that to adopt the one is to invite the\r\nother. Imitation is naturally progressive, and is rapidly so in matters\r\nthat are vicious.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Federal Constitution arrived in England, I received a\r\nletter from a female literary correspondent (a native of New York) very\r\nwell mixed with friendship, sentiment, and politics. In my answer\r\nto that letter, I permitted myself to ramble into the wilderness of\r\nimagination, and to anticipate what might hereafter be the condition\r\nof America. I had no idea that the picture I then drew was realizing\r\nso fast, and still less that Mr. Washington was hurrying it on. As the\r\nextract I allude to is congenial with the subject I am upon, I here\r\ntranscribe it:\r\n\r\n     [_The extract is the same as that given in a footnote, in\r\n     the Memorial to Monroe, p. 180_.]\r\n\r\nImpressed, as I was, with apprehensions of this kind, I had America\r\nconstantly in my mind in all the publications I afterwards made. The\r\nFirst, and still more the Second, Part of the Rights of Man, bear\r\nevident marks of this watchfulness; and the Dissertation on First\r\nPrinciples of Government [XXIV.] goes more directly to the point than\r\neither of the former. I now pass on to other subjects.\r\n\r\nIt will be supposed by those into whose hands this letter may fall, that\r\nI have some personal resentment against you; I will therefore settle\r\nthis point before I proceed further.\r\n\r\nIf I have any resentment, you must acknowledge that I have not been\r\nhasty in declaring it; neither would it now be declared (for what are\r\nprivate resentments to the public) if the cause of it did not unite\r\nitself as well with your public as with your private character, and with\r\nthe motives of your political conduct.\r\n\r\nThe part I acted in the American revolution is well known; I shall not\r\nhere repeat it. I know also that had it not been for the aid received\r\nfrom France, in men, money and ships, that your cold and unmilitary\r\nconduct (as I shall shew in the course of this letter) would in all\r\nprobability have lost America; at least she would not have been the\r\nindependent nation she now is. You slept away your time in the field,\r\ntill the finances of the country were completely exhausted, and you have\r\nbut little share in the glory of the final event. It is time, sir, to\r\nspeak the undisguised language of historical truth.\r\n\r\nElevated to the chair of the Presidency, you assumed the merit of every\r\nthing to yourself, and the natural ingratitude of your constitution\r\nbegan to appear. You commenced your Presidential career by encouraging\r\nand swallowing the grossest adulation, and you travelled America from\r\none end to the other to put yourself in the way of receiving it. You\r\nhave as many addresses in your chest as James the II. As to what were\r\nyour views, for if you are not great enough to have ambition you are\r\nlittle enough to have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from\r\nexpressions of your own; but the partizans of your politics have\r\ndivulged the secret.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams has said, (and John it is known was always a speller after\r\nplaces and offices, and never thought his little services were highly\r\nenough paid,)--John has said, that as Mr. Washington had no child, the\r\nPresidency should be made hereditary in the family of Lund Washington.\r\nJohn might then have counted upon some sinecure himself, and a provision\r\nfor his descendants. He did not go so far as to say, also, that the\r\nVice-Presidency should be hereditary in the family of John Adams. He\r\nprudently left that to stand on the ground that one good turn deserves\r\nanother.(*)\r\n\r\nJohn Adams is one of those men who never contemplated the origin of\r\ngovernment, or comprehended any thing of first principles. If he had,\r\nhe might have seen, that the right to set up and establish hereditary\r\ngovernment, never did, and never can, exist in any generation at any\r\ntime whatever; that it is of the nature of treason; because it is an\r\nattempt to take away the rights of all the minors living at that time,\r\nand of all succeeding generations. It is of a degree beyond common\r\ntreason. It is a sin against nature. The equal right of every generation\r\nis a right fixed in the nature of things. It belongs to the son when of\r\nage, as it belonged to the father before him. John Adams would himself\r\ndeny the right that any former deceased generation could have to\r\ndecree authoritatively a succession of governors over him, or over his\r\nchildren; and yet he assumes the pretended right, treasonable as it is,\r\nof acting it himself. His ignorance is his best excuse.\r\n\r\nJohn Jay has said,(**) (and this John was always the sycophant of\r\nevery thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America, to Grenville in\r\nEngland,)--John Jay has said, that the Senate should have been appointed\r\nfor life. He would then have been sure of never wanting a lucrative\r\nappointment for himself, and have had no fears about impeachment. These\r\nare the disguised traitors that call themselves Federalists.(**)\r\n\r\nCould I have known to what degree of corruption and perfidy the\r\nadministrative part of the government of America had descended, I\r\ncould have been at no loss to have understood the reservedness of Mr.\r\nWashington towards me, during my imprisonment in the Luxembourg. There\r\nare cases in which silence is a loud language. I will here explain the\r\ncause of that imprisonment, and return to Mr. Washington afterwards.\r\n\r\n     * Two persons to whom John Adams said this, told me of it.\r\n     The secretary of Mr. Jay was present when it was told to\r\n     me.--_Author_.\r\n\r\n     **  If Mr. John Jay desires to know on what authority I say\r\n     this, I will give that authority publicly when he chooses to\r\n     call for it--_Author_.\r\n\r\nIn the course of that rage, terror and suspicion, which the brutal\r\nletter of the Duke of Brunswick first started into existence in France,\r\nit happened that almost every man who was opposed to violence, or who\r\nwas not violent himself, became suspected. I had constantly been opposed\r\nto every thing which was of the nature or of the appearance of violence;\r\nbut as I had always done it in a manner that shewed it to be a principle\r\nfounded in my heart, and not a political manouvre, it precluded the\r\npretence of accusing me. I was reached, however, under another pretence.\r\n\r\nA decree was passed to imprison all persons born in England; but as\r\nI was a member of the Convention, and had been complimented with the\r\nhonorary style of Citizen of France, as Mr. Washington and some other\r\nAmericans had been, this decree fell short of reaching me. A motion was\r\nafterwards made and carried, supported chiefly by Bourdon de l'Oise,\r\nfor expelling foreigners from the Convention. My expulsion being thus\r\neffected, the two committees of Public Safety and of General Surety,\r\nof which Robespierre was the dictator, put me in arrestation under the\r\nformer decree for imprisoning persons born in England. Having thus shewn\r\nunder what pretence the imprisonment was effected, I come to speak of\r\nsuch parts of the case as apply between me and Mr. Washington, either as\r\na President or as an individual.\r\n\r\nI have always considered that a foreigner, such as I was in fact, with\r\nrespect to France, might be a member of a Convention for framing a\r\nConstitution, without affecting his right of citizenship in the\r\ncountry to which he belongs, but not a member of a government after\r\na Constitution is formed; and I have uniformly acted upon this\r\ndistinction» To be a member of a government requires that a person be\r\nin allegiance to that government and to the country locally. But a\r\nConstitution, being a thing of principle, and not of action, and\r\nwhich, after it is formed, is to be referred to the people for their\r\napprobation or rejection, does not require allegiance in the persons\r\nforming and proposing it; and besides this, it is only to the thing\r\nafter it be formed and established, and to the country after its\r\ngovernmental character is fixed by the adoption of a constitution, that\r\nthe allegiance can be given. No oath of allegiance or of citizenship was\r\nrequired of the members who composed the Convention: there was nothing\r\nexisting in form to swear allegiance to. If any such condition had been\r\nrequired, I could not, as Citizen of America in fact, though Citizen of\r\nFrance by compliment, have accepted a seat in the Convention.\r\n\r\nAs my citizenship in America was not altered or diminished by any thing\r\nI had done in Europe, (on the contrary, it ought to be considered as\r\nstrengthened, for it was the American principle of government that I\r\nwas endeavouring to spread in Europe,) and as it is the duty of every\r\ngovern-ment to charge itself with the care of any of its citizens who\r\nmay happen to fall under an arbitrary persecution abroad, and is also\r\none of the reasons for which ambassadors or ministers are appointed,--it\r\nwas the duty of the Executive department in America, to have made (at\r\nleast) some enquiries about me, as soon as it heard of my imprisonment.\r\nBut if this had not been the case, that government owed it to me on\r\nevery ground and principle of honour and gratitude. Mr. Washington owed\r\nit to me on every score of private acquaintance, I will not now say,\r\nfriendship; for it has some time been known by those who know him, that\r\nhe has no friendships; that he is incapable of forming any; he can serve\r\nor desert a man, or a cause, with constitutional indifference; and it is\r\nthis cold hermaphrodite faculty that imposed itself upon the world,\r\nand was credited for a while by enemies as by friends, for prudence,\r\nmoderation and impartiality.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 \"L'on pent dire qu'il [Washington] jouit de tous les\r\n     avantages possibles a l'exception des douceurs de\r\n     l'amitié.\"--Louis Otto, Chargé d'Affaires (at New York) to\r\n     his government, 13 June, 1790. French Archives, vol. 35, No.\r\n     32.--Editor.\r\n\r\nSoon after I was put into arrestation, and imprisoned in the Luxembourg,\r\nthe Americans who were then in Paris went in a body to the bar of the\r\nConvention to reclaim me. They were answered by the then President\r\nVadier, who has since absconded, that _I was born in England_, and it\r\nwas signified to them, by some of the Committee of _General Surety_, to\r\nwhom they were referred (I have been told it was Billaud Varennes,) that\r\ntheir reclamation of me was only the act of individuals, without any\r\nauthority from the American government.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, all communications from persons imprisoned to\r\nany person without the prison was cut off by an order of the Police. I\r\nneither saw, nor heard from, any body for six months; and the only hope\r\nthat remained to me was, that a new Minister would arrive from America\r\nto supercede Morris, and that he would be authorized to enquire into\r\nthe cause of my imprisonment. But even this hope, in the state to which\r\nmatters were daily arriving, was too remote to have any consolatory\r\neffect, and I contented myself with the thought, that I might be\r\nremembered when it would be too late. There is perhaps no condition from\r\nwhich a man conscious of his own uprightness cannot derive consolation;\r\nfor it is in itself a consolation for him to find, that he can bear that\r\ncondition with calmness and fortitude.\r\n\r\nFrom about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robespierre\r\nJuly 29, (9th of Thermidor,) the state of things in the prisons was a\r\ncontinued scene of horror. No man could count upon life for twenty-four\r\nhours. To such a pitch of rage and suspicion were Robespierre and his\r\nCommittee arrived, that it seemed as if they feared to leave a man\r\nliving. Scarcely a night passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty,\r\nfifty, or more, were not taken out of the prison, carried before a\r\npretended tribunal in the morning, and guillotined before night. One\r\nhundred and sixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night, in\r\nthe month of July, and one hundred and sixty of them guillotined. A\r\nlist of two hundred more, according to the report in the prison, was\r\npreparing a few days before Robespierre fell. In this last list I have\r\ngood reason to believe I was included. A memorandum in the hand-writing\r\nof Robespierre was afterwards produced in the Convention, by the\r\ncommittee to whom the papers of Robespierre were referred, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     \"Demander que Thomas           \"I Demand that Thomas Paine\r\n     \"Payne soit décrété d'ac-       be decreed of accusation\r\n     \"cusation pour les inté-        for the interests of America\r\n     \"rôtsde l'Amérique,autant       as well as of France.\"\r\n     \"que de la France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 In reading this the Committee added, \"Why Thomas Payne\r\n     more than another? Because He helped to establish the\r\n     liberty of both worlds.\"--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nI had then been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the\r\nExecutive part of the government of America (Mr. Washington) upon the\r\ncase, and upon every thing respecting me, was explanation enough to\r\nRobespierre that he might proceed to extremities.\r\n\r\nA violent fever which had nearly terminated my existence, was, I\r\nbelieve, the circumstance that preserved it. I was not in a condition to\r\nbe removed, or to know of what was passing, or of what had passed, for\r\nmore than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The first\r\nthing I was informed of was the fall of Robespierre.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after this, Mr. Monroe arrived to supercede Gouverneur\r\nMorris, and as soon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be\r\nread, I found a way to convey one to him by means of the man who lighted\r\nthe lamps in the prison; and whose unabated friendship to me, from whom\r\nhe had never received any service, and with difficulty accepted any\r\nrecompense, puts the character of Mr. Washington to shame.\r\n\r\nIn a few days I received a message from Mr. Monroe, conveyed to me in a\r\nnote from an intermediate person, with assurance of his friendship, and\r\nexpressing a desire that I would rest the case in his hands. After a\r\nfortnight or more had passed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a\r\nfriend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him\r\nto inform me what was the true situation of things with respect to me. I\r\nwas sure that something was the matter; I began to have hard thoughts of\r\nMr. Washington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.\r\n\r\nIn about ten days, I received an answer to my letter, in which the\r\nwriter says, \"Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no order [meaning from\r\nthe President, Mr. Washington] respecting you, but that he (Mr. Monroe)\r\nwill do every thing in his power to liberate you; but, from what I learn\r\nfrom the Americans lately arrived in Paris, you are not considered,\r\neither by the American government, or by the individuals, as an American\r\ncitizen.\"\r\n\r\nI was now at no loss to understand Mr. Washington and his new fangled\r\nfaction, and that their policy was silently to leave me to fall in\r\nFrance. They were rushing as fast as they could venture, without\r\nawakening the jealousy of America, into all the vices and corruptions of\r\nthe British government; and it was no more consistent with the policy\r\nof Mr. Washington, and those who immediately surrounded him, than it was\r\nwith that of Robespierre or of Pitt, that I should survive. They have,\r\nhowever, missed the mark, and the reaction is upon themselves.\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of the letter just alluded to, I sent a memorial to Mr.\r\nMonroe, which the reader will find in the appendix, and I received from\r\nhim the following answer.(1) It is dated the 18th of September, but did\r\nnot come to hand till about the 4th of October. I was then failing into\r\na relapse, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not to be\r\nhad, and the abscess in my side, the consequence of these things, and\r\nof the want of air and exercise, was beginning to form, and which has\r\ncontinued immoveable ever since. Here follows Mr. Monroe's letter.\r\n\r\n     1 The appendix consisted of an abridgment of the Memorial,\r\n     which forms the preceding chapter (XXI.) in this volume.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, September 18th, 1794. \"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I was favoured soon after my arrival here with several letters from\r\nyou, and more latterly with one in the character of memorial upon the\r\nsubject of your confinement; and should have answered them at the\r\ntimes they were respectively written had I not concluded you would have\r\ncalculated with certainty upon the deep interest I take in your welfare,\r\nand the pleasure with which I shall embrace every opportunity in my\r\npower to serve you. I should still pursue the same course, and for\r\nreasons which must obviously occur, if I did not find that you are\r\ndisquieted with apprehensions upon interesting points, and which justice\r\nto you and our country equally forbid you should entertain. You mention\r\nthat you have been informed you are not considered as an American\r\ncitizen by the Americans, and that you have likewise heard that I had\r\nno instructions respecting you by the government. I doubt not the person\r\nwho gave you the information meant well, but I suspect he did not even\r\nconvey accurately his own ideas on the first point: for I presume the\r\nmost he could say is, that you had likewise become a French citizen,\r\nand which by no means deprived you of being an American one. Even\r\nthis, however, may be doubted, I mean the acquisition of citizenship in\r\nFrance, and I confess you have said much to show that it has not been\r\nmade. I really suspect that this was all that the gentleman who wrote\r\nto you, and those Americans he heard speak upon the subject meant. It\r\nbecomes my duty, however, to declare to you, that I consider you as\r\nan American citizen, and that you are considered universally in that\r\ncharacter by the people of America. As such you are entitled to my\r\nattention; and so far as it can be given consistently with those\r\nobligations which are mutual between every government and even a\r\ntransient passenger, you shall receive it.\r\n\r\n\"The Congress have never decided upon the subject of citizenship in\r\na manner to regard the present case. By being with us through the\r\nrevolution you are of our country as absolutely as if you had been born\r\nthere, and you are no more of England, than every native American is.\r\nThis is the true doctrine in the present case, so far as it becomes\r\ncomplicated with any other consideration. I have mentioned it to make\r\nyou easy upon the only point which could give you any disquietude.\r\n\r\n\"Is it necessary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I\r\nspeak of the great mass of the people, are interested in your welfare?\r\nThey have not forgotten the history of their own revolution and the\r\ndifficult scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its\r\nseveral stages without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the\r\nmerits of those who served them in that great and arduous conflict. The\r\ncrime of ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain,\r\nour national character. You are considered by them as not only having\r\nrendered important service in our own revolution, but as being, on a\r\nmore extensive scale, the friend of human rights, and a distinguished\r\nand able advocate in favour of public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas\r\nPaine, the Americans are not, nor can they be, indifferent.\r\n\r\n\"Of the sense which the President has always entertained of your merits,\r\nand of his friendly disposition towards you, you are too well assured\r\nto require any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wishes\r\nin seeking your safety is what I well know, and this will form an\r\nadditional obligation on me to perform what I should otherwise consider\r\nas a duty.\r\n\r\n\"You are, in my opinion, at present menaced by no kind of danger.\r\nTo liberate you, will be an object of my endeavours, and as soon as\r\npossible. But you must, until that event shall be accomplished, bear\r\nyour situation with patience and fortitude. You will likewise have the\r\njustice to recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre*\r\nmany important objects to attend to, with few to consult It becomes me\r\nin pursuit of those to regulate my conduct in respect to each, as to\r\nthe manner and the time, as will, in my judgment, be best calculated to\r\naccomplish the whole.\r\n\r\n\"With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend,\r\n\r\n\"James Monroe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe part in Mr. Monroe's letter, in which he speaks of the President,\r\n(Mr. Washington,) is put in soft language. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr.\r\nWashington had said formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view.\r\nBut the fact is, not only that Mr. Washington had given no orders to Mr.\r\nMonroe, as the letter [of Whiteside] stated, but he did not so much as\r\nsay to him, enquire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in prison or out, or\r\nsee if there be any assistance we can give him.\r\n\r\n     This I presume alludes to the embarrassments which the\r\n     strange conduct of Gouverneur Morris had occasioned, and\r\n     which, I well know, had created suspicions of the sincerity\r\n     of Mr. Washington.--_Author_. voi. m--ij\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were passing, the liberations from the prisons were\r\nnumerous; from twenty to forty in the course of almost every twenty-four\r\nhours. The continuance of my imprisonment after a new Minister had\r\narrived immediately from America, which was now more than two months,\r\nwas a matter so obviously strange, that I found the character of the\r\nAmerican government spoken of in very unqualified terms of reproach;\r\nnot only by those who still remained in prison, but by those who were\r\nliberated, and by persons who had access to the prison from without.\r\nUnder these circumstances I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found\r\noccasion, among other things, to say: \"It will not add to the popularity\r\nof Mr. Washington to have it believed in America, as it is believed\r\nhere, that he connives at my imprisonment.\"\r\n\r\nThe case, so far as it respected Mr. Monroe, was, that having to get\r\nover the difficulties, which the strange conduct of Gouverneur Morris\r\nhad thrown in the way of a successor, and having no authority from the\r\nAmerican government to speak officially upon any thing relating to me,\r\nhe found himself obliged to proceed by unofficial means with individual\r\nmembers; for though Robespierre was overthrown, the Robespierrian\r\nmembers of the Committee of Public Safety still remained in considerable\r\nforce, and had they found out that Mr. Monroe had no official authority\r\nupon the case, they would have paid little or no regard to his\r\nreclamation of me. In the mean time my health was suffering exceedingly,\r\nthe dreary prospect of winter was coming on, and imprisonment was still\r\na thing of danger. After the Robespierrian members of the Committee were\r\nremoved by the expiration of their time of serving, Mr. Monroe reclaimed\r\nme, and I was liberated the 4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris\r\nthe beginning of August before. All that period of my imprisonment,\r\nat least, I owe not to Robespierre, but to his colleague in projects,\r\nGeorge Washington. Immediately upon my liberation, Mr. Monroe invited me\r\nto his house, where I remained more than a year and a half; and I speak\r\nof his aid and friendship, as an open-hearted man will always do in such\r\na case, with respect and gratitude.\r\n\r\nSoon after my liberation, the Convention passed an unanimous vote,\r\nto invite me to return to my seat among them. The times were still\r\nunsettled and dangerous, as well from without as within, for the\r\ncoalition was unbroken, and the constitution not settled. I chose,\r\nhowever, to accept the invitation: for as I undertake nothing but what\r\nI believe to be right, I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I\r\nwas willing also to shew, that, as I was not of a cast of mind to be\r\ndeterred by prospects or retrospects of danger, so neither were my\r\nprinciples to be weakened by misfortune or perverted by disgust.\r\n\r\nBeing now once more abroad in the world, I began to find that I was\r\nnot the only one who had conceived an unfavourable opinion of Mr.\r\nWashington; it was evident that his character was on the decline as well\r\namong Americans as among foreigners of different nations. From being the\r\nchief of the government, he had made himself the chief of a party;\r\nand his integrity was questioned, for his politics had a doubtful\r\nappearance. The mission of Mr. Jay to London, notwithstanding there\r\nwas an American Minister there already, had then taken place, and was\r\nbeginning to be talked of. It appeared to others, as it did to me, to\r\nbe enveloped in mystery, which every day served either to increase or to\r\nexplain into matter of suspicion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Washington, as President,\r\nhad sent Gouverneur Morris to London, as his secret agent to have some\r\ncommunication with the British Ministry. To cover the agency of Morris\r\nit was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from\r\nRobert Morris to borrow money in Europe, and the report was permitted\r\nto pass uncontradicted. The event of Morris's negociation was, that Mr.\r\nHammond was sent Minister from England to America, Pinckney from\r\nAmerica to England, and himself Minister to France. If, while Morris was\r\nMinister in France, he was not a emissary of the British Ministry and\r\nthe coalesced powers, he gave strong reasons to suspect him of it. No\r\none who saw his conduct, and heard his conversation, could doubt his\r\nbeing in their interest; and had he not got off the time he did, after\r\nhis recall, he would have been in arrestation. Some letters of his had\r\nfallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was\r\nmaking after him.\r\n\r\nA great bustle had been made by Mr. Washington about the conduct of\r\nGenet in America, while that of his own Minister, Morris, in France, was\r\ninfinitely more reproachable. If Genet was imprudent or rash, he was not\r\ntreacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French\r\nrevolution, in every stage of it. But notwithstanding this conduct\r\non the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr.\r\nWashington in a letter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on\r\nthe complaint and request of the Committee of Public Safety, assures\r\nhim, that though he had complied with that request, he still retained\r\nthe same esteem and friendship for him as before. This letter Morris was\r\nfoolish enough to tell of; and, as his own char-acter and conduct were\r\nnotorious, the telling of it could have but one effect, which was that\r\nof implicating the character of the writer.(1) Morris still loiters\r\nin Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Washington is still in\r\ncorrespondence with him. Mr. Washington ought, therefore, to expect,\r\nespecially since his conduct in the affairs of Jay's treaty, that France\r\nmust consider Morris and Washington as men of the same description. The\r\nchief difference, however, between the two is, (for in politics there\r\nis none,) that the one is profligate enough to profess an indifference\r\nabout _moral_ principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the\r\nwant of them.\r\n\r\n     1 Washington wrote to Morris, June 19,1794, \"my confidence\r\n     in and friendship for you remain undiminished.\" It was not\r\n     \"foolish\" but sagacious to show this one sentence, without\r\n     which Morris might not have escaped out of France. The\r\n     letter reveals Washington's mental decline. He says \"until\r\n     then [Fauchet's demand for recall of Morris, early 1794] I\r\n     had supposed you stood well with the powers that were.\"\r\n     Lafayette had pleaded for Morris's removal, and two French\r\n     Ministers before Fauchet, Ternant and Genet, had expressed\r\n     their Government's dissatisfaction with him. See Ford's\r\n     Writings of Washington, vii., p. 453; also Editor's\r\n     Introduction to XXI.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAbout three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay\r\nto Grenville on the subject of the capture of American vessels by the\r\nBritish cruisers, appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris.\r\nEvery thing was of a-piece. Every thing was mean. The same kind of\r\ncharacter went to all circumstances public or private. Disgusted at\r\nthis national degradation, as well as at the particular conduct of Mr.\r\nWashington to me, I wrote to him (Mr. Washington) on the 22d of February\r\n(1795) under cover to the then Secretary of State, (Mr. Randolph,) and\r\nentrusted the letter to Mr. Le-tombe, who was appointed French consul\r\nto Philadelphia, and was on the point of taking his departure. When I\r\nsupposed Mr. Letombe had sailed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe,\r\nand as I was then in his house, I shewed it to him. He expressed a\r\nwish that I would recall it, which he supposed might be done, as he had\r\nlearnt that Mr. Letombe had not then sailed. I agreed to do so, and it\r\nwas returned by Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Monroe.\r\n\r\nThe letter, however, will now reach Mr. Washington publicly in the\r\ncourse of this work.\r\n\r\nAbout the month of September following, I had a severe relapse which\r\ngave occasion to the report of my death. I had felt it coming on a\r\nconsiderable time before, which occasioned me to hasten the work I\r\nhad then in hand, the _Second part of the Age of Reason_. When I had\r\nfinished that work, I bestowed another letter on Mr. Washington, which I\r\nsent under cover to Mr. Benj. Franklin Bache of Philadelphia. The letter\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Paris, September 20th, 1795.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I had written you a letter by Mr. Letombe, French consul, but, at the\r\nrequest of Mr. Monroe, I withdrew it, and the letter is still by me.\r\nI was the more easily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my\r\nintention to have returned to America the latter end of the present\r\nyear, 1795; but the illness I now suffer prevents me. In case I had\r\ncome, I should have applied to you for such parts of your official\r\nletters (and of your private ones, if you had chosen to give them) as\r\ncontained any instructions or directions either to Mr. Monroe, or to\r\nMr. Morris, or to any other person respecting me; for after you were\r\ninformed of my imprisonment in France, it was incumbent on you to have\r\nmade some enquiry into the cause, as you might very well conclude that I\r\nhad not the opportunity of informing you of it. I cannot understand your\r\nsilence upon this subject upon any other ground, than as _connivance_ at\r\nmy imprisonment; and this is the manner it is understood here, and will\r\nbe understood in America, unless you give me authority for contradicting\r\nit. I therefore write you this letter, to propose to you to send me\r\ncopies of any letters you have written, that may remove that suspicion.\r\nIn the preface to the second part of the Age of Reason, I have given a\r\nmemorandum from the hand-writing of Robespierre, in which he proposed a\r\ndecree of accusation against me, '_for the interests of America as well\r\nas of France!_' He could have no cause for putting America in the\r\ncase, but by interpreting the silence of the American government into\r\nconnivance and consent. I was imprisoned on the ground of being born\r\nin England; and your silence in not enquiring into the cause of that\r\nimprisonment, and reclaiming me against it, was tacitly giving me up. I\r\nought not to have suspected you of treachery; but whether I recover\r\nfrom the illness I now suffer or not, I shall continue to think you\r\ntreacherous, till you give me cause to think otherwise. I am sure you\r\nwould have found yourself more at your ease, had you acted by me as\r\nyou ought; for whether your desertion of me was intended to gratify the\r\nEnglish Government, or to let me fall into destruction in France that\r\nyou might exclaim the louder against the French Revolution, or whether\r\nyou hoped by my extinction to meet with less opposition in mounting up\r\nthe American government--either of these will involve you in reproach\r\nyou will not easily shake off.\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS Paine.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Washington Papers in State Department. Endorsed by Bache:\r\n     \"Jan. 18, 1796. Enclosed to Benj. Franklin Bache, and by him\r\n     forwarded immediately upon receipt.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nHere follows the letter above alluded to, which I had stopped in\r\ncomplaisance to Mr. Monroe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Paris, February aad, 1795.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"As it is always painful to reproach those one would wish to respect, it\r\nis not without some difficulty that I have taken the resolution to\r\nwrite to you. The dangers to which I have been exposed cannot have been\r\nunknown to you, and the guarded silence you have observed upon that\r\ncircumstance is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a\r\nfriend or as President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"You knew enough of my character to be assured that I could not have\r\ndeserved imprisonment in France; and, without knowing any thing more\r\nthan this, you had sufficient ground to have taken some interest for my\r\nsafety. Every motive arising from recollection of times past, ought to\r\nhave suggested to you the propriety of such a measure. But I cannot find\r\nthat you have so much as directed any enquiry to be made whether I\r\nwas in prison or at liberty, dead or alive; what the cause of that\r\nimprisonment was, or whether there was any service or assistance you\r\ncould render. Is this what I ought to have expected from America, after\r\nthe part I had acted towards her, or will it redound to her honour or\r\nto yours, that I tell the story? I do not hesitate to say, that you have\r\nnot served America with more disinterestedness, or greater zeal, or more\r\nfidelity, than myself, and I know not if with better effect. After the\r\nrevolution of America was established I ventured into new scenes\r\nof difficulties to extend the principles which that revolution had\r\nproduced, and you rested at home to partake of the advantages. In the\r\nprogress of events, you beheld yourself a President in America, and me a\r\nprisoner in France. You folded your arms, forgot your friend, and became\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\"As every thing I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wishes\r\nfor the prosperity of America, I ought to be the more surprised at this\r\nconduct on the part of her government. It leaves me but one mode of\r\nexplanation, which is, _that every thing is not as it ought to be\r\namongst you_, and that the presence of a man who might disapprove, and\r\nwho had credit enough with the country to be heard and believed, was not\r\nwished for. This was the operating motive with the despotic faction\r\nthat imprisoned me in France, (though the pretence was, that I was a\r\nforeigner,) and those that have been silent and inactive towards me\r\nin America, appear to me to have acted from the same motive. It is\r\nimpossible for me to discover any other.(1)\r\n\r\n\"After the part I have taken in the revolution of America, it is\r\nnatural that I feel interested in whatever relates to her character\r\nand prosperity. Though I am not on the spot to see what is immediately\r\nacting there, I see some part of what she is acting in Europe. For\r\nyour own sake, as well as for that of America, I was both surprised\r\nand concerned at the appointment of Gouverneur Morris to be Minister\r\nto France. His conduct has proved that the opinion I had formed of that\r\nappointment was well founded. I wrote that opinion to Mr. Jefferson at\r\nthe time, and I was frank enough to say the same thing to Morris--_that\r\nit was an unfortunate appointment?_ His prating, insignificant\r\npomposity, rendered him at once offensive, suspected, and ridiculous;\r\nand his total neglect of all business had so disgusted the Americans,\r\nthat they proposed drawing up a protest against him. He carried this\r\nneglect to such an extreme, that it was necessary to inform him of it;\r\nand I asked him one day, if he did not feel himself ashamed to take the\r\nmoney of the country, and do nothing for it?' But Morris is so fond of\r\nprofit and voluptousness, that he cares nothing about character. Had\r\nhe not been removed at the time he was, I think his conduct would have\r\nprecipitated the two countries into a rupture; and in this case,\r\nhated _systematically_ as America is and ever will be by the British\r\ngovernment, and at the same time suspected by France, the commerce of\r\nAmerica would have fallen a prey to both countries.\r\n\r\n     1 This paragraph of the original letter was omitted from the\r\n     American pamphlet, probably by the prudence of Mr. Bache.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 \"I have just heard of Gouverneur Morris's appointment. It\r\n     is a most unfortunate one; and, as I shall mention the same\r\n     thing to him when I see him, I do not express it to you with\r\n     the injunction of confidence.\"--Paine to Jefferson, Feb.\r\n     13,1792.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     3  Paine could not of course know that Morris was willing\r\n     that the Americans, to whom he alludes, captains of captured\r\n     vessels, should suffer, in order that there might be a case\r\n     against France of violation of treaty, which would leave the\r\n     United States free to transfer the alliance to England. See\r\n     Introduction to XXI.. also my \"Life of Paine,\" ii., p.\r\n     83.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n\"If the inconsistent conduct of Morris exposed the interest of America\r\nto some hazard in France, the pusillanimous conduct of Mr. Jay in\r\nEngland has rendered the American government contemptible in Europe.\r\nIs it possible that any man who has contributed to the independence of\r\nAmer-ica, and to free her from the tyranny and injustice of the British\r\ngovernment, can read without shame and indignation the note of Jay to\r\nGrenville? It is a satire upon the declaration of Independence, and an\r\nencouragement to the British government to treat America with contempt.\r\nAt the time this Minister of Petitions was acting this miserable part,\r\nhe had every means in his hands to enable him to have done his business\r\nas he ought. The success or failure of his mission depended upon the\r\nsuccess or failure of the French arms. Had France failed, Mr. Jay might\r\nhave put his humble petition in his pocket, and gone home. The case\r\nhappened to be otherwise, and he has sacrificed the honour and perhaps\r\nall the advantages of it, by turning petitioner. I take it for granted,\r\nthat he was sent over to demand indemnification for the captured\r\nproperty; and, in this case, if he thought he wanted a preamble to his\r\ndemand, he might have said,\r\n\r\n'That, tho' the government of England might suppose itself under\r\nthe necessity of seizing American property bound to France, yet\r\nthat supposed necessity could not preclude indemnification to the\r\nproprietors, who, acting under the authority of their own government,\r\nwere not accountable to any other.'\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Jay sets out with an implied recognition of the right of the\r\nBritish government to seize and condemn: for he enters his complaint\r\nagainst the _irregularity_ of the seizures and the condemnation, as if\r\nthey were reprehensible only by not being _conformable_ to the _terms_\r\nof the proclamation under which they were seized. Instead of being the\r\nEnvoy of a government, he goes over like a lawyer to demand a new trial.\r\nI can hardly help thinking that Grenville wrote that note himself and\r\nJay signed it; for the style of it is domestic and not diplomatic.\r\nThe term, _His_ Majesty, used without any descriptive epithet, always\r\nsignifies the King whom the Minister that speaks represents. If this\r\nsinking of the demand into a petition was a juggle between Grenville\r\nand Jay, to cover the indemnification, I think it will end in another\r\njuggle, that of never paying the money, and be made use of afterwards to\r\npreclude the right of demanding it: for Mr. Jay has virtually disowned\r\nthe right _by appealing to the magnanimity of his Majesty against the\r\ncapturers_. He has made this magnanimous Majesty the umpire in the case,\r\nand the government of the United States must abide by the decision. If,\r\nSir, I turn some part of this business into ridicule, it is to avoid the\r\nunpleasant sensation of serious indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Among other things which I confess I do not understand, is the\r\nproclamation of neutrality. This has always appeared to me as\r\nan assumption on the part of the executive not warranted by the\r\nConstitution. But passing this over, as a disputable case, and\r\nconsidering it only as political, the consequence has been that of\r\nsustaining the losses of war, without the balance of reprisals. When\r\nthe profession of neutrality, on the part of America, was answered by\r\nhostilities on the part of Britain, the object and intention of that\r\nneutrality existed no longer; and to maintain it after this, was not\r\nonly to encourage farther insults and depredations, but was an informal\r\nbreach of neutrality towards France, by passively contributing to the\r\naid of her enemy. That the government of England considered the American\r\ngovernment as pusillanimous, is evident from the encreasing insolence of\r\nthe conduct of the former towards the latter, till the affair of General\r\nWayne. She then saw that it might be possible to kick a government into\r\nsome degree of spirit.(1) So far as the proclamation of neutrality was\r\nintended to prevent a dissolute spirit of privateering in America under\r\nforeign colors, it was undoubtedly laudable; but to continue it as a\r\ngovernment neutrality, after the commerce of America was made war upon,\r\nwas submission and not neutrality. I have heard so much about this thing\r\ncalled neutrality, that I know not if the ungenerous and dishonorable\r\nsilence (for I must call it such,) that has been observed by your part\r\nof the government towards me, during my imprisonment, has not in some\r\nmeasure arisen from that policy.\r\n\r\n     1 Wayne's success against the Indians of the Six Nations,\r\n     1794, was regarded by Washington also as a check on England.\r\n     Writing to Pendleton, Jan. 22, 1795, he says: \"There is\r\n     reason to believe that the Indians...._together with their\r\n     abettors_; begin to see things in a different point of\r\n     view.\" (Italics mine).--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\"Tho' I have written you this letter, you ought not to suppose it has\r\nbeen an agreeable undertaking to me. On the contrary, I assure you, it\r\nhas caused me some disquietude. I am sorry you have given me cause to\r\ndo it; for, as I have always remembered your former friendship with\r\npleasure, I suffer a loss by your depriving me of that sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat this letter was not written in very good temper, is very evident;\r\nbut it was just such a letter as his conduct appeared to me to merit,\r\nand every thing on his part since has served to confirm that\r\nopinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his silence, with respect to my\r\nimprisonment in France, some of his faction have furnished me with it.\r\nWhat I here allude to, is a publication in a Philadelphia paper, copied\r\nafterwards into a New York paper, both under the patronage of the\r\nWashington faction, in which the writer, still supposing me in prison\r\nin France, wonders at my lengthy respite from the scaffold; and he marks\r\nhis politics still farther, by saying:\r\n\r\n\"It appears, moreover, that the people of England did not relish his\r\n(Thomas Paine's) opinions quite so well as he expected, and that for one\r\nof his last pieces, as destructive to the peace and happiness of their\r\ncountry, (meaning, I suppose, the _Rights of Man_,) they threatened\r\nour knight-errant with such serious vengeance, that, to avoid a trip to\r\nBotany Bay, he fled over to France, as a less dangerous voyage.\"\r\n\r\nI am not refuting or contradicting the falsehood of this publication,\r\nfor it is sufficiently notorious; neither am I censuring the writer: on\r\nthe contrary, I thank him for the explanation he has incautiously given\r\nof the principles of the Washington faction. Insignificant, however, as\r\nthe piece is, it was capable of having some ill effects, had it arrived\r\nin France during my imprisonment, and in the time of Robespierre; and I\r\nam not uncharitable in supposing that this was one of the intentions of\r\nthe writer.(*)\r\n\r\n     * I know not who the writer of the piece is, but some of the\r\n     Americans say it is Phineas Bond, an American refugee, but\r\n     now a British consul; and that he writes under the\r\n     signature of Peter Skunk or Peter Porcupine, or some such\r\n     signature.--Author.\r\n\r\n     This footnote probably added to the gall of Porcupine's\r\n     (Cobbett's) \"Letter to the Infamous Tom Paine, in Answer to\r\n     his Letter to General Washington\" (Polit. Censor, Dec.,\r\n     1796), of which he (Cobbett) afterwards repented. Phineas\r\n     Bond had nothing to do with it.--Editor.\r\n\r\nI have now done with Mr. Washington on the score of private affairs. It\r\nwould have been far more agreeable to me, had his conduct been such as\r\nnot to have merited these reproaches. Errors or caprices of the temper\r\ncan be pardoned and forgotten; but a cold deliberate crime of the heart,\r\nsuch as Mr. Washington is capable of acting, is not to be washed away. I\r\nnow proceed to other matter.\r\n\r\nAfter Jay's note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the\r\ncharacter of every thing that was to follow might be easily foreseen;\r\nand it was upon this anticipation that _my_ letter of February the 22d\r\nwas founded. The event has proved that I was not mistaken, except that\r\nit has been much worse than I expected.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally occur to Mr. Washington, that the secrecy of Jay's\r\nmission to England, where there was already an American Minister, could\r\nnot but create some suspicion in the French government; especially\r\nas the conduct of Morris had been notorious, and the intimacy of Mr.\r\nWashington with Morris was known.\r\n\r\nThe character which Mr. Washington has attempted to act in the world, is\r\na sort of non-describable, camelion-colored thing, called _prudence_. It\r\nis, in many cases, a substitute for principle, and is so nearly allied\r\nto hypocrisy that it easily slides into it. His genius for prudence\r\nfurnished him in this instance with an expedient that served, as is\r\nthe natural and general character of all expedients, to diminish the\r\nembarrassments of the moment and multiply them afterwards; for\r\nhe authorized it to be made known to the French government, as a\r\nconfidential matter, (Mr. Washington should recollect that I was a\r\nmember of the Convention, and had the means of knowing what I here\r\nstate) he authorized it, I say, to be announced, and that for the\r\npurpose of preventing any uneasiness to France on the score of Mr. Jay's\r\nmission to England, that the object of that mission, and of Mr. Jay's\r\nauthority, was restricted to that of demanding the surrender of the\r\nwestern posts, and indemnification for the cargoes captured in American\r\nvessels. Mr. Washington knows that this was untrue; and knowing this,\r\nhe had good reason to himself for refusing to furnish the House of\r\nRepresentatives with copies of the instructions given to Jay, as he\r\nmight suspect, among other things, that he should also be called upon\r\nfor copies of instructions given to other Ministers, and that, in\r\nthe contradiction of instructions, his want of integrity would be\r\ndetected.(1) Mr. Washington may now, perhaps, learn, when it is too late\r\nto be of any use to him, that a man will pass better through the world\r\nwith a thousand open errors upon his back, than in being detected in\r\n_one_ sly falsehood. When one is detected, a thousand are suspected.\r\n\r\nThe first account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being negotiated by\r\nMr. Jay, (for nobody suspected any,) came in an English newspaper, which\r\nannounced that a treaty _offensive and defensive_ had been concluded\r\nbetween the United States of America and England. This was immediately\r\ndenied by every American in Paris, as an impossible thing; and though\r\nit was disbelieved by the French, it imprinted a suspicion that some\r\nunderhand business was going forward.(*) At length the treaty itself\r\narrived, and every well-affected American blushed with shame.\r\n\r\n     1 When the British treaty had been ratified by the Senate\r\n     (with one stipulation) and signed by the President, the\r\n     House of Representatives, required to supply the means for\r\n     carrying into effect, believed that its power over the\r\n     supplies authorized it to check what a large majority\r\n     considered an outrage on the country and on France. This was\r\n     the opinion of Edmund Randolph (the first Attorney General),\r\n     of Jefferson, Madison, and other eminent men. The House\r\n     having respectfully requested the President to send them\r\n     such papers on the treaty as would not affect any existing\r\n     negotiations, he refused in a message (March 30, 1796),\r\n     whose tenor Madison described as \"improper and indelicate.\"\r\n     He said \"the assent of the House of Representatives is not\r\n     necessary to the validity of a treaty.\" The House regarded\r\n     the message as menacing a serious conflict, and receded.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     * It was the embarrassment into which the affairs and credit\r\n     of America were thrown at this instant by the report above\r\n     alluded to, that made it necessary to contradict it, and\r\n     that by every means arising from opinion or founded upon\r\n     authority. The Committee of Public Safety, existing at that\r\n     time, had agreed to the full execution, on their part, of\r\n     the treaty between America and France, notwithstanding some\r\n     equivocal conduct on the part of the American government,\r\n     not very consistent with the good faith of an ally; but they\r\n     were not in a disposition to be imposed upon by a counter-\r\n     treaty. That Jay had no instructions beyond the points above\r\n     stated, or none that could possibly be construed to extend\r\n     to the length the British treaty goes, was a matter believed\r\n     in America, in England, and in France; and without going to\r\n     any other source it followed naturally from the message of\r\n     the President to Congress, when he nominated Jay upon that\r\n     mission. The secretary of Mr. Jay came to Paris soon after\r\n     the treaty with England had been concluded, and brought with\r\n     him a copy of Mr. Jay's instructions, which he offered to\r\n     shew to me as _justification of Jay_. I advised him, as a\r\n     friend, not to shew them to anybody, and did not permit him\r\n     to shew them to me. \"Who is it,\" said I to him, \"that you\r\n     intend to implicate as censureable by shewing those\r\n     instructions? Perhaps that implication may fall upon your\r\n     own government.\" Though I did not see the instructions, I\r\n     could not be at a loss to understand that the American\r\n     administration had been playing a double game.--Author.\r\n\r\n     That there was a \"double game\" in this business, from first\r\n     to last, is now a fact of history. Jay was confirmed by the\r\n     Senate on a declaration of the President in which no\r\n     faintest hint of a treaty was given, but only the\r\n     \"adjustment of our complaints,\" \"vindication of our rights,\"\r\n     and cultivation of \"peace.\" Only after the Envoy's\r\n     confirmation did the Cabinet add the main thing, his\r\n     authority to negotiate a commercial treaty. This was done\r\n     against the protest of the only lawyer among them, Edmund\r\n     Randolph, Secretary of State, who said the exercise of such\r\n     a power by Jay would be an abridgment of the rights of the\r\n     Senate and of the nation. See my \"Life of Randolph,\" p. 220.\r\n     For Jay's Instructions, etc., see I. Am. State Papers,\r\n     Foreign Relations.--Editor.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, how the appearance of characters will change,\r\nwhilst the root that produces them remains the same. The Washington\r\nfaction having waded through the slough of negociation, and whilst it\r\namused France with professions of friendship contrived to injure her,\r\nimmediately throws off the hypocrite, and assumes the swaggering air of\r\na bravado. The party papers of that imbecile administration were on\r\nthis occasion filled with paragraphs about _Sovereignty_. A paltroon may\r\nboast of his sovereign right to let another kick him, and this is the\r\nonly kind of sovereignty shewn in the treaty with England. But those\r\ndaring paragraphs, as Timothy Pickering(1) well knows, were intended\r\nfor France; without whose assistance, in men, money, and ships, Mr.\r\nWashington would have cut but a poor figure in the American war. But of\r\nhis military talents I shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nI mean not to enter into any discussion of any article of Jay's treaty;\r\nI shall speak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be justified\r\non the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles\r\nof the treaty pre-existing with France. But the sovereign right of\r\nexplanation does not lie with George Washington and his man Timothy;\r\nFrance, on her part, has, at least, an equal right: and when nations\r\ndispute, it is not so much about words as about things.\r\n\r\nA man, such as the world calls a sharper, and versed as Jay must be\r\nsupposed to be in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into\r\nengagements, and make bargains, in such a manner as to cheat some other\r\nparty, without that party being able, as the phrase is, _to take the law\r\nof him_. This often happens in the cabalistical circle of what is called\r\nlaw. But when this is attempted to be acted on the national scale of\r\ntreaties, it is too despicable to be defended, or to be permitted to\r\nexist. Yet this is the trick upon which Jay's treaty is founded, so\r\nfar as it has relation to the treaty pre-existing with France. It is a\r\ncounter-treaty to that treaty, and perverts all the great articles of\r\nthat treaty to the injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty\r\nto England, with whom France is at war.\r\n\r\n     1 Secretary of State.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThe Washington administration shews great desire that the treaty between\r\nFrance and the United States be preserved. Nobody can doubt their\r\nsincerity upon this matter. There is not a British Minister, a British\r\nmerchant, or a British agent or sailor in America, that does not\r\nanxiously wish the same thing. The treaty with France serves now as\r\na passport to supply England with naval stores and other articles of\r\nAmerican produce, whilst the same articles, when coming to France, are\r\nmade contraband or seizable by Jay's treaty with England. The treaty\r\nwith France says, that neutral ships make neutral property, and thereby\r\ngives protection to English property on board American ships; and Jay's\r\ntreaty delivers up French property on board American ships to be seized\r\nby the English. It is too paltry to talk of faith, of national honour,\r\nand of the preservation of treaties, whilst such a bare-faced treachery\r\nas this stares the world in the face.\r\n\r\nThe Washington administration may save itself the trouble of proving to\r\nthe French government its _most faithful_ intentions of preserving\r\nthe treaty with France; for France has now no desire that it should be\r\npreserved. She had nominated an Envoy extraordinary to America, to make\r\nMr. Washington and his government a present of the treaty, and to\r\nhave no more to do with _that_, or with _him_. It was at the same time\r\nofficially declared to the American Minister at Paris, _that the French\r\nRepublic had rather have the American government for an open enemy\r\nthan a treacherous friend_. This, sir, together with the internal\r\ndistractions caused in America, and the loss of character in the world,\r\nis the _eventful crisis_, alluded to in the beginning of this letter, to\r\nwhich your double politics have brought the affairs of your country. It\r\nis time that the eyes of America be opened upon you.\r\n\r\nHow France would have conducted herself towards America and American\r\ncommerce, after all treaty stipulations had ceased, and under the sense\r\nof services rendered and injuries received, I know not. It is, however,\r\nan unpleasant reflection, that in all national quarrels, the innocent,\r\nand even the friendly part of the community, become involved with the\r\nculpable and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from\r\nAmerica continued to manifest an invariable attachment in the general\r\nmass of the people to their original ally, in opposition to the\r\nnew-fangled Washington faction,--the resolutions that had been taken\r\nin France were suspended. It happened also, fortunately enough, that\r\nGouverneur Morris was not Minister at this time.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one point that still remains in embryo, and\r\nwhich, among other things, serves to shew the ignorance of Washington\r\ntreaty-makers, and their inattention to preexisting treaties, when they\r\nwere employing themselves in framing or ratifying the new treaty with\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the treaty of commerce between the United States\r\nand France says:\r\n\r\n\"The most christian king and the United States engage mutually, not to\r\ngrant any particular favour to other nations in respect of commerce and\r\nnavigation that shall not immediately become common to the other party,\r\nwho shall enjoy the same favour freely, if the concession was freely\r\nmade, or on allowing the same compensation if the concession was\r\nconditional.\"\r\n\r\nAll the concessions, therefore, made to England by Jay's treaty are,\r\nthrough the medium of this second article in the pre-existing treaty,\r\nmade to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and\r\ncan be exercised by her as a matter of right, the same as by England.\r\n\r\nJay's treaty makes a concession to England, and that unconditionally,\r\nof seizing naval stores in American ships, and condemning them as\r\ncontraband. It makes also a concession to England to seize provisions\r\nand _other articles_ in American ships. _Other articles are all other\r\narticles_, and none but an ignoramus, or something worse, would have put\r\nsuch a phrase into a treaty. The condition annexed in this case is, that\r\nthe provisions and other articles so seized, are to be paid for at a\r\nprice to be agreed upon. Mr. Washington, as President, ratified\r\nthis treaty after he knew the British Government had recommended an\r\nindiscriminate seizure of provisions and all other articles in American\r\nships; and it is now known that those seizures were made to fit out the\r\nexpedition going to Quiberon Bay, and it was known before hand that they\r\nwould be made. The evidence goes also a good way to prove that Jay and\r\nGrenville understood each other upon that subject. Mr. Pinckney,(1)\r\nwhen he passed through France on his way to Spain, spoke of the\r\nrecommencement of the seizures as a thing that would take place.\r\n\r\n     1 Gen. Thomas Pinckney, U. S. Minister to England.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nThe French government had by some means received information from London\r\nto the same purpose, with the addition, that the recommencement of\r\nthe seizures would cause no misunderstanding between the British and\r\nAmerican governments. Grenville, in defending himself against the\r\nopposition in Parliament, on account of the scarcity of corn, said (see\r\nhis speech at the opening of the Parliament that met October 29, 1795)\r\nthat _the supplies for the Quiberon expedition were furnished out of the\r\nAmerican ships_, and all the accounts received at that time from\r\nEngland stated that those seizures were made under the treaty. After the\r\nsupplies for the Quiberon expedition had been procured, and the expected\r\nsuccess had failed, the seizures were countermanded; and had the French\r\nseized provision vessels going to England, it is probable that the\r\nQuiberon expedition could not have been attempted.\r\n\r\nIn one point of view, the treaty with England operates as a loan to\r\nthe English government. It gives permission to that government to take\r\nAmerican property at sea, to any amount, and pay for it when it suits\r\nher; and besides this, the treaty is in every point of view a surrender\r\nof the rights of American commerce and navigation, and a refusal to\r\nFrance of the rights of neutrality. The American flag is not now a\r\nneutral flag to France; Jay's treaty of surrender gives a monopoly of it\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the treaty of commerce between America and France\r\nwas formed on the most liberal principles, and calculated to give the\r\ngreatest encouragement to the infant commerce of America. France was\r\nneither a carrier nor an exporter of naval stores or of provisions.\r\nThose articles belonged wholly to America, and they had all the\r\nprotection in that treaty which a treaty could give. But so much has\r\nthat treaty been perverted, that the liberality of it on the part\r\nof France, has served to encourage Jay to form a counter-treaty with\r\nEngland; for he must have supposed the hands of France tied up by her\r\ntreaty with America, when he was making such large concessions in favour\r\nof England. The injury which Mr. Washington's administration has done to\r\nthe character as well as to the commerce of America, is too great to be\r\nrepaired by him. Foreign nations will be shy of making treaties with\r\na government that has given the faithless example of perverting the\r\nliberality of a former treaty to the injury of the party with whom it\r\nwas made.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 For an analysis of the British Treaty see Wharton's\r\n     \"Digest of the International Law of the United States,\" vol.\r\n     it, § 150 a. Paine's analysis is perfectly correct.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nIn what a fraudulent light must Mr. Washington's character appear in the\r\nworld, when his declarations and his conduct are compared together! Here\r\nfollows the letter he wrote to the Committee of Public Safety, while Jay\r\nwas negotiating in profound secrecy this treacherous treaty:\r\n\r\n\"George Washington, President of the United States of America, to the\r\nRepresentatives of the French people, members of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety of the French Republic, the great and good friend and ally of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"On the intimation of the wish of the French republic that à new\r\nMinister should be sent from the United States, I resolved to manifest\r\nmy sense of the readiness with which _my_ request was fulfilled, [that\r\nof recalling Genet,] by immediately fulfilling the request of your\r\ngovernment, [that of recalling Morris].\r\n\r\n\"It was some time before a character could be obtained, worthy of the\r\nhigh office of expressing the attachment of the United States to\r\nthe happiness of our allies, _and drawing closer the bonds of our\r\nfriendship_. I have now made choice of James Monroe, one of our\r\ndistinguished citizens, to reside near the French republic, in quality\r\nof Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America. He is\r\ninstructed to bear to you our _sincere solicitude for your welfare, and\r\nto cultivate with teal the cordiality so happily subsisting between\r\nus_. From a knowledge of his fidelity, probity, and good conduct, I have\r\nentire confidence that he will render himself acceptable to you,\r\nand give effect to your desire of preserving and _advancing, on all\r\noccasions, the interest and connection of the two nations_. I beseech\r\nyou, therefore, to give full credence to whatever he shall say to you\r\non the part of the United States, and _most of all, when he shall assure\r\nyou that your prosperity is an object of our affection_.\r\n\r\n\"And I pray God to have the French Republic in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\"G. Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWas it by entering into a treaty with England to surrender French\r\nproperty on board American ships to be seized by the English, while\r\nEnglish property on board American ships was declared by the French\r\ntreaty not to be seizable, _that the bonds of friendship between America\r\nand France were to be drawn the closer?_ Was it by declaring naval\r\nstores contraband when coming to France, whilst by the French treaty\r\nthey were not contraband when going to England, that the _connection\r\nbetween France and America was to be advanced?_ Was it by opening the\r\nAmerican ports to the British navy in the present war, from which ports\r\nthe same navy had been expelled by the aid solicited from France in the\r\nAmerican war (and that aid gratuitously given) (2) that the gratitude\r\nof America was to be shewn, and the _solicitude_ spoken of in the letter\r\ndemonstrated?\r\n\r\n     1 The italics are Paine's. Paine's free use of this document\r\n     suggests that he possessed the confidence of the French\r\n     Directory.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2  It is notable that Paine adheres to his old contention in\r\n     his controversy with Deane. See vol. i., ch. aa of this work;\r\n     and vol. i., ch. 9 of my \"Life of Paine.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nAs the letter was addressed to the Committee of Public Safety, Mr.\r\nWashington did not expect it would get abroad in the world, or be seen\r\nby any other eye than that of Robespierre, or be heard by any other ear\r\nthan that of the Committee; that it would pass as a whisper across the\r\nAtlantic, from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate. It\r\nwas calculated to remove from the mind of the Committee all suspicion\r\nupon Jay's mission to England, and, in this point of view, it was suited\r\nto the circumstances of the movement then passing; but as the event\r\nof that mission has proved the letter to be hypocritical, it serves no\r\nother purpose of the present moment than to shew that the writer is\r\nnot to be credited. Two circumstances serve to make the reading of the\r\nletter necessary in the Convention. The one was, that they who succeeded\r\non the fall of Robespierre, found it most proper to act with publicity;\r\nthe other, to extinguish the suspicions which the strange conduct of\r\nMorris had occasioned in France.\r\n\r\nWhen the British treaty, and the ratification of it by Mr. Washington,\r\nwas known in France, all further declarations from him of his good\r\ndisposition as an ally and friend, passed for so many cyphers; but still\r\nit appeared necessary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It\r\nis stipulated in the British treaty, that commissioners are to report\r\nat the end of two years, on the case of _neutral ships making neutral\r\nproperty_. In the mean time, neutral ships do _not_ make neutral\r\nproperty, according to the British treaty, and they _do_ according to\r\nthe French treaty. The preservation, therefore, of the French treaty\r\nbecame of great importance to England, as by that means she can employ\r\nAmerican ships as carriers, whilst the same advantage is denied to\r\nFrance. Whether the French treaty could exist as a matter of right after\r\nthis clandestine perversion of it, could not but give some apprehensions\r\nto the partizans of the British treaty, and it became necessary to them\r\nto make up, by fine words, what was wanting in good actions.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity offered to that purpose. The Convention, on the public\r\nreception of Mr. Monroe, ordered the American flag and the French flags\r\nto be displayed unitedly in the hall of the Convention. Mr. Monroe made\r\na present of an American flag for the purpose. The Convention returned\r\nthis compliment by sending a French flag to America, to be presented by\r\ntheir Minister, Mr. Adet, to the American government. This resolution\r\npassed long before Jay's treaty was known or suspected: it passed in\r\nthe days of confidence; but the flag was not presented by Mr. Adet till\r\nseveral months after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Washington made\r\nthis the occasion of saying some fine things to the French Minister; and\r\nthe better to get himself into tune to do this, he began by saying the\r\nfinest things of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Born, sir (said he) in a land of liberty; _having_ early learned its\r\nvalue; _having_ engaged in a perilous conflict to defend it; _having_,\r\nin a word, devoted the best years of my life to secure its permanent\r\nestablishment in my own country; _my_ anxious recollections, my\r\nsympathetic feelings, and _my_ best wishes are irresistibly excited,\r\nwhenever, in any country, I see an oppressed people unfurl the banner of\r\nfreedom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Washington, having expended so many fine phrases upon himself, was\r\nobliged to invent a new one for the French, and he calls them \"wonderful\r\npeople!\" The coalesced powers acknowledged as much.\r\n\r\nIt is laughable to hear Mr. Washington talk of his _sympathetic\r\nfeelings_, who has always been remarked, even among his friends, for\r\nnot having any. He has, however, given no proofs of any to me. As to the\r\npompous encomiums he so liberally pays to himself, on the score of the\r\nAmerican revolution, the reality of them may be questioned; and since\r\nhe has forced them so much into notice, it is fair to examine his\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nA stranger might be led to suppose, from the egotism with which Mr.\r\nWashington speaks, that himself, and himself only, had generated,\r\nconducted, compleated, and established the revolution: In fine, that it\r\nwas all his own doing.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as to the political part, he had no share in it;\r\nand, therefore, the whole of _that_ is out of the question with respect\r\nto him. There remains, then, only the military part; and it would have\r\nbeen prudent in Mr. Washington not to have awakened enquiry upon that\r\nsubject. Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was\r\ndisposed to take away the laurels that, whether they were _acquired_ or\r\nnot, had been _given_.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington's merit consisted in constancy. But constancy was the\r\ncommon virtue of the revolution. Who was there that was inconstant? I\r\nknow but of one military defection, that of Arnold; and I know of no\r\npolitical defection, among those who made themselves eminent when the\r\nrevolution was formed by the declaration of independence. Even Silas\r\nDeane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This generous judgment by Deane's old adversary has become\r\n     questionable under recent investigations.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut when we speak of military character, something more is to be\r\nunderstood than constancy; and something more _ought_ to be understood\r\nthan the Fabian system of _doing nothing_. The _nothing_ part can be\r\ndone by any body. Old Mrs. Thompson, the housekeeper of head quarters,\r\n(who threatened to make the sun and the wind shine through Rivington of\r\nNew York,) 'could have done it as well as Mr. Washington. Deborah would\r\nhave been as good as Barak.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington had the nominal rank of Commander in Chief, but he was\r\nnot so in fact. He had, in reality, only a separate command. He had no\r\ncontroul over, or direction of, the army to the northward under Gates,\r\nthat captured Burgoyne; nor of that to the south under [Nathaniel]\r\nGreene, that recovered the southern States.(2) The nominal rank,\r\nhowever, of Commander in Chief, served to throw upon him the lustre\r\nof those actions, and to make him appear as the soul and centre of all\r\nmilitary operations in America.\r\n\r\n     1 The Tory publisher of New York City, whose press was\r\n     destroyed in 1775 by a mob of Connecticut soldiers.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 See Mr. Winterbotham's valuable History of America, lately\r\n     published.--Author. [The \"History of the Establishment of\r\n     Independence\" is contained in the first of Mr.\r\n     Winterbotham's four volumes (London, 1795).--_Editor._.]\r\n\r\nHe commenced his command June, 1775, during the time the Massachusetts\r\narmy lay before Boston, and after the affair of Bunker-hill. The\r\ncommencement of his command was the commencement of inactivity. Nothing\r\nwas afterwards done, or attempted to be done, during the nine months\r\nhe remained before Boston. If we may judge from the resistance made at\r\nConcord, and afterwards at Bunker-hill, there was a spirit of enterprise\r\nat that time, which the presence of Mr. Washington chilled into cold\r\ndefence. By the advantage of a good exterior he attracts respect, which\r\nhis habitual silence tends to preserve; but he has not the talent of\r\ninspiring ardour in an army. The enemy removed from Boston in March\r\n1776, to wait for reinforcements from Europe, and to take a more\r\nadvantageous position at New York.\r\n\r\nThe inactivity of the campaign of 1775, on the part of General\r\nWashington, when the enemy had a less force than in any other future\r\nperiod of the war, and the injudicious choice of positions taken by\r\nhim in the campaign of 1776, when the enemy had its greatest force,\r\nnecessarily produced the losses and misfortunes that marked that gloomy\r\ncampaign. The positions taken were either islands or necks of land.\r\nIn the former, the enemy, by the aid of their ships, could bring their\r\nwhole force against apart of General Washington's, as in the affair\r\nof Long Island; and in the latter, he might be shut up as in the bottom\r\nof a bag. This had nearly been the case at New York, and it was so in\r\npart; it was actually the case at Fort Washington; and it would have\r\nbeen the case at Fort Lee, if General Greene had not moved precipitately\r\noff, leaving every thing behind, and by gaining Hackinsack bridge, got\r\nout of the bag of Bergen Neck. How far Mr. Washington, as General, is\r\nblameable for these matters, I am not undertaking to determine; but they\r\nare evidently defects in military geography. The successful skirmishes\r\nat the close of that campaign, (matters that would scarcely be noticed\r\nin a better state of things,) make the brilliant exploits of General\r\nWashington's seven campaigns. No wonder we see so much pusillanimity in\r\nthe President, when we see so little enterprise in the General!\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1777 became famous, not by anything on the part of\r\nGeneral Washington, but by the capture of General Burgoyne, and the\r\narmy under his command, by the Northern army at Saratoga, under General\r\nGates. So totally distinct and unconnected were the two armies of\r\nWashington and Gates, and so independent was the latter of the authority\r\nof the nominal Commander in Chief, that the two Generals did not so much\r\nas correspond, and it was only by a letter of General (since Governor)\r\nClinton, that General Washington was informed of that event. The British\r\ntook possession of Philadelphia this year, which they evacuated\r\nthe next, just time enough to save their heavy baggage and fleet of\r\ntransports from capture by the French Admiral d'Estaing, who arrived at\r\nthe mouth of the Delaware soon after.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Burgoyne gave an eclat in Europe to the American arms,\r\nand facilitated the alliance with France. The eclat, however, was\r\nnot kept up by any thing on the part of General Washington. The same\r\nunfortunate languor that marked his entrance into the field, continued\r\nalways. Discontent began to prevail strongly against him, and a party\r\nwas formed in Congress, whilst sitting at York-town, in Pennsylvania,\r\nfor removing him from the command of the army. The hope, however,\r\nof better times, the news of the alliance with France, and the\r\nunwillingness of shewing discontent, dissipated the matter.\r\n\r\nNothing was done in the campaigns of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part\r\nwhere General Washington commanded, except the taking of Stony Point by\r\nGeneral Wayne. The Southern States in the mean time were over-run by the\r\nenemy. They were afterwards recovered by General Greene, who had in a\r\nvery great measure created the army that accomplished that recovery.\r\nIn all this General Washington had no share. The Fabian system of war,\r\nfollowed by him, began now to unfold itself with all its evils; but\r\nwhat is Fabian war without Fabian means to support it? The finances of\r\nCongress depending wholly on emissions of paper money, were exhausted.\r\nIts credit was gone. The continental treasury was not able to pay the\r\nexpense of a brigade of waggons to transport the necessary stores to the\r\narmy, and yet the sole object, the establishment of the revolution,\r\nwas a thing of remote distance. The time I am now speaking of is in the\r\nlatter end of the year 1780.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of things it was found not only expedient, but\r\nabsolutely necessary, for Congress to state the whole case to its ally.\r\nI knew more of this matter, (before it came into Congress or was known\r\nto General Washington) of its progress, and its issue, than I chuse\r\nto state in this letter. Colonel John Laurens was sent to France as an\r\nEnvoy Extraordinary on this occasion, and by a private agreement between\r\nhim and me I accompanied him. We sailed from Boston in the Alliance\r\nfrigate, February 11th, 1781. France had already done much in accepting\r\nand paying bills drawn by Congress. She was now called upon to do more.\r\nThe event of Colonel Laurens's mission, with the aid of the venerable\r\nMinister, Franklin, was, that France gave in money, as a present, six\r\nmillions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to send\r\na fleet of not less than thirty sail of the line, at her own expense,\r\nas an aid to America. Colonel Laurens and myself returned from Brest the\r\n1st of June following, taking with us two millions and a half of livres\r\n(upwards of one hundred thousand pounds sterling) of the money given,\r\nand convoying two ships with stores.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Boston the 25th of August following. De Grasse arrived\r\nwith the French fleet in the Chesapeak at the same time, and was\r\nafterwards joined by that of Barras, making 31 sail of the line.\r\nThe money was transported in waggons from Boston to the Bank at\r\nPhiladelphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has since put himself at\r\nthe head of the list of petitioners in favour of the British treaty, was\r\nthen President. And it was by the aid of this money, and this fleet, and\r\nof Rochambeau's army, that Cornwallis was taken; the laurels of which\r\nhave been unjustly given to Mr. Washington. His merit in that affair was\r\nno more than that of any other American officer.\r\n\r\nI have had, and still have, as much pride in the American revolution as\r\nany man, or as Mr. Washington has a right to have; but that pride has\r\nnever made me forgetful whence the great aid came that compleated\r\nthe business. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the\r\ncommencement of the revolution. It is one of the subjects treated of\r\nin the pamphlet _Common Sense_, but as a matter that could not be hoped\r\nfor, unless independence was declared.1 The aid, however, was greater\r\nthan could have been expected.\r\n\r\nIt is as well the ingratitude as the pusillanimity of Mr. Washington,\r\nand the Washington faction, that has brought upon America the loss\r\nof character she now suffers in the world, and the numerous evils her\r\ncommerce has undergone, and to which it is yet exposed. The British\r\nMinistry soon found out what sort of men they had to deal with, and they\r\ndealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was wanting, it\r\nhas been fully given since, in the snivelling address of the New York\r\nChamber of Commerce to the President, and in that of sundry merchants of\r\nPhiladelphia, which was not much better.\r\n\r\n     1  See vol. i. of this work, p. ixx. Paine was sharply taken\r\n     to task on this point by \"Cato.\"   Ib.% pp. 145-147.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolution of America was finally established by the\r\ntermination of the war, the world gave her credit for great character;\r\nand she had nothing to do but to stand firm upon that ground. The\r\nBritish ministry had their hands too full of trouble to have provoked\r\na rupture with her, had she shown a proper resolution to defend her\r\nrights. But encouraged as they were by the submissive character of the\r\nAmerican administration, they proceeded from insult to insult, till none\r\nmore were left to be offered. The proposals made by Sweden and Denmark\r\nto the American administration were disregarded. I know not if so much\r\nas an answer has been returned to them. The minister penitentiary,\r\n(as some of the British prints called him,) Mr. Jay, was sent on a\r\npilgrimage to London, to make up all by penance and petition. In the\r\nmean time the lengthy and drowsy writer of the pieces signed _Camillas_\r\nheld himself in reserve to vindicate every thing; and to sound in\r\nAmerica the tocsin of terror upon the inexhaustible resources of\r\nEngland. Her resources, says he, are greater than those of all the other\r\npowers. This man is so intoxicated with fear and finance, that he knows\r\nnot the difference between _plus_ and _minus_--between a hundred pounds\r\nin hand, and a hundred pounds worse than nothing.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of America, so far as it had been established by all the\r\ntreaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the\r\nprinciples upon which it was established were good. That ground ought\r\nnever to have been departed from. It was the justifiable ground\r\nof right, and no temporary difficulties ought to have induced an\r\nabandonment of it. The case is now otherwise. The ground, the scene, the\r\npretensions, the everything, are changed. The commerce of America is, by\r\nJay's treaty, put under foreign dominion. The sea is not free for her.\r\nHer right to navigate it is reduced to the right of escaping; that is,\r\nuntil some ship of England or France stops her vessels, and carries them\r\ninto port. Every article of American produce, whether from the sea or\r\nthe sand, fish, flesh, vegetable, or manufacture, is, by Jay's treaty,\r\nmade either contraband or seizable. Nothing is exempt. In all other\r\ntreaties of commerce, the article which enumerates the contraband\r\narticles, such as fire arms, gunpowder, &c, is followed by another\r\narticle which enumerates the articles not contraband: but it is not so\r\nin Jay's treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is supplied by\r\nthe article for seizing and carrying into port; and the sweeping phrase\r\nof \"provisions and _other articles _\" includes every thing. There never\r\nwas such a base and servile treaty of surrender since treaties began to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nThis is the ground upon which America now stands. All her rights\r\nof commerce and navigation are to begin anew, and that with loss of\r\ncharacter to begin with. If there is sense enough left in the heart\r\nto call a blush into the cheek, the Washington administration must\r\nbe ashamed to appear.--And as to you, Sir, treacherous in private\r\nfriendship (for so you have been to me, and that in the day of danger)\r\nand a hypocrite in public life, the world will be puzzled to decide\r\nwhether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned\r\ngood principles, or whether you ever had any.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. OBSERVATIONS.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 State Archives, Paris, États Unis, vol. 43, fol. 100.\r\n     Undated, but evidently written early in the year 1795, when\r\n     Jay's Treaty was as yet unknown. Paine was then staying in\r\n     the house of the American Minister, Monroe.--' Editor,\r\n\r\nThe United States of America are negociating with Spain respecting the\r\nfree Navigation of the Mississippi, and the territorial limits of this\r\nlarge river, in conformity with the Treaty of Peace with England dated\r\n30th November, 1782. As the brilliant successes of the French Republic\r\nhave forced England to grant us, what was in all justice our due, so the\r\ncontinuation of the prosperity of the Republic, will force Spain to make\r\na Treaty with us on the points in controversy.\r\n\r\nSince it is certain that all that we shall obtain from Spain will be due\r\nto the victories of France, and as the inhabitants of the western part\r\nof the United States (which part contains or covers more than half\r\nthe United States), have decided to claim their rights to the free\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, would it not be a wiser policy for the\r\nRepublican Government (who have only to command to obtain) to arrogate\r\nall the merit, by making our demands to Spain, one of the conditions, of\r\nFrance, to consent to restore peace to the Castilians. They have only\r\nto declare, they will not make Peace, or that they will support with\r\nall their might, the just reclamations of their allies against these\r\nPowers,--against England for the surrender of the frontier posts, and\r\nfor the indemnities due through their depredations on our Trade, and\r\nagainst Spain for our territorial limits, and the free navigation of\r\nthe Mississippi. This declaration would certainly not prolong the War a\r\nsingle day more, nor cost the Republic an obole, whilst it would assure\r\nall the merit of success to France, and besides produce all the good\r\neffects mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be observed that the Negociation is already finished\r\nwith England, and perhaps in a manner which will not be approved of by\r\nFrance. That may be, (though the terms of this arrangement may not be\r\nknown); but as to Spain, the negociation is still pending, and it is\r\nevident that if France makes the above _Declaration_ as to this Power\r\n(which declaration would be a demonstrative proof of what she would\r\nhave done in the other case if circumstances had required it), she would\r\nreceive the same credit as if the Declaration had been made relatively\r\nto the two Powers. In fact the Decree or resolution (and perhaps this\r\nlast would be preferable) can be worded in terms which would declare\r\nthat in case the arrangement with England were not satisfactory, France\r\nwill nevertheless, maintain the just demands of America against\r\nthat Power. A like Declaration, in case Mr. Jay should do anything\r\nreprehensible, and which might even be approved of in America, would\r\ncertainly raise the reputation of the French Republic to the most\r\neminent degree of splendour, and lower in proportion that of her\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIt is very certain that France cannot better favour the views of the\r\nBritish party in America, and wound in a most sensible manner the\r\nRepublican Government of this country, than by adopting a strict and\r\noppressive policy with regard to us. Every one knows that the injustices\r\ncommitted by the privateers and other ships belonging to the French\r\nRepublic against our navigation, were causes of exultation and joy\r\nto this party, even when their own properties were subjected to these\r\ndepredations, whilst the friends of France and the Revolution were vexed\r\nand most confused about it. It follows then, that a generous policy\r\nwould produce quite opposite effects--it would acquire for France the\r\nmerit that is her due; it would discourage the hopes of her adversaries,\r\nand furnish the friends of humanity and liberty with the means of acting\r\nagainst the intrigues of England, and cement the Union, and contribute\r\ntowards the true interests of the two republics.\r\n\r\nSo sublime and generous a manner of acting, which would not cost\r\nanything to France, would cement in a stronger way the ties between\r\nthe two republics. The effect of such an event, would confound and\r\nannihilate in an irrevocable manner all the partisans for the British\r\nin America. There are nineteen twentieths of our nation attached through\r\ninclination and gratitude to France, and the small number who seek\r\nuselessly all sorts of pretexts to magnify the small occasions of\r\ncomplaint which might have subsisted previously will find itself reduced\r\nto silence, or have to join their expressions of gratitude to ours.--The\r\nresults of this event cannot be doubted, though not reckoned on: all the\r\nAmerican hearts will be French, and England will be afflicted.\r\n\r\nAn American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. DISSERTATION ON FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT. (1)\r\n\r\n     1 Printed from the first edition, whose title is as above,\r\n     with the addition: \"By Thomas Paine, Author of Common Sense;\r\n     Rights of Man; Age of Reason. Paris, Printed at the\r\n     English Press, me de Vaugerard, No. 970. Third year of the\r\n     French Republic.\" The pamphlet seems to have appeared early\r\n     in July (perhaps the Fourth), 1795, and was meant to\r\n     influence the decision of the National Convention on the\r\n     Constitution then under discussion. This Constitution,\r\n     adopted September 23d, presently swept away by Napoleon,\r\n     contained some features which appeared to Paine reactionary.\r\n     Those to which he most objected are quoted by him in his\r\n     speech in the Convention, which is bound up in the same\r\n     pamphlet, and follows this \"Dissertation\" in the present\r\n     volume. In the Constitution as adopted Paine's preference\r\n     for a plural Executive was established, and though the\r\n     bicameral organization (the Council of Five Hundred and the\r\n     Council of Ancients) was not such as he desired, his chief\r\n     objection was based on his principle of manhood suffrage.\r\n     But in regard to this see Paine's \"Dissertations on\r\n     Government,\" written nine years before (vol. ii., ch. vi. of\r\n     this work), and especially p. 138 seq. of that volume, where\r\n     he indicates the method of restraining the despotism of\r\n     numbers.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nThere is no subject more interesting to every man than the subject of\r\ngovernment. His security, be he rich or poor, and in a great measure\r\nhis prosperity, are connected therewith; it is therefore his interest\r\nas well as his duty to make himself acquainted with its principles, and\r\nwhat the practice ought to be.\r\n\r\nEvery art and science, however imperfectly known at first, has been\r\nstudied, improved, and brought to what we call perfection by the\r\nprogressive labours of succeeding generations; but the science of\r\ngovernment has stood still. No improvement has been made in the\r\nprinciple and scarcely any in the practice till the American revolution\r\nbegan. In all the countries of Europe (except in France) the same forms\r\nand systems that were erected in the remote ages of ignorance still\r\ncontinue, and their antiquity is put in the place of principle; it is\r\nforbidden to investigate their origin, or by what right they exist.\r\nIf it be asked how has this happened, the answer is easy: they are\r\nestablished on a principle that is false, and they employ their power to\r\nprevent detection.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the mystery with which the science of government has\r\nbeen enveloped, for the purpose of enslaving, plundering, and imposing\r\nupon mankind, it is of all things the least mysterious and the most easy\r\nto be understood. The meanest capacity cannot be at a loss, if it begins\r\nits enquiries at the right point. Every art and science has some point,\r\nor alphabet, at which the study of that art or science begins, and by\r\nthe assistance of which the progress is facilitated. The same method\r\nought to be observed with respect to the science of government.\r\n\r\nInstead then of embarrassing the subject in the outset with the numerous\r\nsubdivisions under which different forms of government have been\r\nclassed, such as aristocracy, democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, &c.\r\nthe better method will be to begin with what may be called primary\r\ndivisions, or those under which all the several subdivisions will be\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nThe primary divisions are but two:\r\n\r\nFirst, government by election and representation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, government by hereditary succession.\r\n\r\nAll the several forms and systems of government, however numerous\r\nor diversified, class themselves under one or other of those primary\r\ndivisions; for either they are on the system of representation, or on\r\nthat of hereditary succession. As to that equivocal thing called mixed\r\ngovernment, such as the late government of Holland, and the present\r\ngovernment of England, it does not make an exception to the general\r\nrule, because the parts separately considered are either representative\r\nor hereditary.\r\n\r\nBeginning then our enquiries at this point, we have first to examine\r\ninto the nature of those two primary divisions.\r\n\r\nIf they are equally right in principle, it is mere matter of opinion\r\nwhich we prefer. If the one be demonstratively better than the other,\r\nthat difference directs our choice; but if one of them should be so\r\nabsolutely false as not to have a right to existence, the matter settles\r\nitself at once; because a negative proved on one thing, where two only\r\nare offered, and one must be accepted, amounts to an affirmative on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions that are now spreading themselves in the world have\r\ntheir origin in this state of the case, and the present war is a\r\nconflict between the representative system founded on the rights of the\r\npeople, and the hereditary system founded in usurpation. As to what are\r\ncalled Monarchy, Royalty, and Aristocracy, they do not, either as things\r\nor as terms, sufficiently describe the hereditary system; they are but\r\nsecondary things or signs of the hereditary system, and which fall of\r\nthemselves if that system has not a right to exist. Were there no\r\nsuch terms as Monarchy, Royalty, and Aristocracy, or were other terms\r\nsubstituted in their place, the hereditary system, if it continued,\r\nwould not be altered thereby. It would be the same system under any\r\nother titulary name as it is now.\r\n\r\nThe character therefore of the revolutions of the present day\r\ndistinguishes itself most definitively by grounding itself on the system\r\nof representative government, in opposition to the hereditary. No other\r\ndistinction reaches the whole of the principle.\r\n\r\nHaving thus opened the case generally, I proceed, in the first place, to\r\nexamine the hereditary system, because it has the priority in point of\r\ntime. The representative system is the invention of the modern world;\r\nand, that no doubt may arise as to my own opinion, I declare it\r\nbefore hand, which is, _that there is not a problem in Euclid more\r\nmathematically true, than that hereditary government has not a right to\r\nexist. When therefore we take from any man the exercise of hereditary\r\npower, we take away that which he never had the right to possess, and\r\nwhich no law or custom could, or ever can, give him a title to_.\r\n\r\nThe arguments that have hitherto been employed against the hereditary\r\nsystem have been chiefly founded upon the absurdity of it, and its\r\nincompetency to the purpose of good government. Nothing can present to\r\nour judgment, or to our imagination, a figure of greater absurdity, than\r\nthat of seeing the government of a nation fall, as it frequently does,\r\ninto the hands of a lad necessarily destitute of experience, and often\r\nlittle better than a fool. It is an insult to every man of years, of\r\ncharacter, and of talents, in a country. The moment we begin to reason\r\nupon the hereditary system, it falls into derision; let but a single\r\nidea begin, and a thousand will soon follow. Insignificance, imbecility,\r\nchildhood, dotage, want of moral character; in fine, every defect\r\nserious or laughable unite to hold up the hereditary system as a figure\r\nof ridicule. Leaving, however, the ridiculousness of the thing to the\r\nreflections of the reader, I proceed to the more important part of the\r\nquestion, namely, whether such a system has a right to exist.\r\n\r\nTo be satisfied of the right of a thing to exist, we must be satisfied\r\nthat it had a right to begin. If it had not a right to begin, it has not\r\na right to continue. By what right then did the hereditary system begin?\r\nLet a man but ask himself this question, and he will find that he cannot\r\nsatisfy himself with an answer.\r\n\r\nThe right which any man or any family had to set itself up at first to\r\ngovern a nation, and to establish itself hereditarily, was no other than\r\nthe right which Robespierre had to do the same thing in France. If he\r\nhad none, they had none. If they had any, he had as much; for it is\r\nimpossible to discover superiority of right in any family, by virtue of\r\nwhich hereditary government could begin. The Capets, the Guelphs,\r\nthe Robespierres, the Marats, are all on the same standing as to the\r\nquestion of right. It belongs exclusively to none.\r\n\r\nIt is one step towards liberty, to perceive that hereditary government\r\ncould not begin as an exclusive right in any family. The next point\r\nwill be, whether, having once begun, it could grow into a right by the\r\ninfluence of time.\r\n\r\nThis would be supposing an absurdity; for either it is putting time in\r\nthe place of principle, or making it superior to principle; whereas time\r\nhas no more connection with, or influence upon principle, than principle\r\nhas upon time. The wrong which began a thousand years ago, is as much a\r\nwrong as if it began to-day; and the right which originates to-day, is\r\nas much a right as if it had the sanction of a thousand years. Time with\r\nrespect to principles is an eternal now: it has no operation upon them:\r\nit changes nothing of their nature and qualities. But what have we to\r\ndo with a thousand years? Our life-time is but a short portion of that\r\nperiod, and if we find the wrong in existence as soon as we begin to\r\nlive, that is the point of time at which it begins to us; and our right\r\nto resist it is the same as if it never existed before.\r\n\r\nAs hereditary government could not begin as a natural right in any\r\nfamily, nor derive after its commencement any right from time, we have\r\nonly to examine whether there exist in a nation a right to set it up,\r\nand establish it by what is called law, as has been done in England. I\r\nanswer NO; and that any law or any constitution made for that purpose is\r\nan act of treason against the right of every minor in the nation, at the\r\ntime it is made, and against the rights of all succeeding generations.\r\nI shall speak upon each of those cases. First, of the minor at the time\r\nsuch law is made. Secondly, of the generations that are to follow.\r\n\r\nA nation, in a collective sense, comprehends all the individuals of\r\nwhatever age, from just born to just dying. Of these, one part will be\r\nminors, and the other aged. The average of life is not exactly the same\r\nin every climate and country, but in general, the minority in years are\r\nthe majority in numbers; that is, the number of persons under twenty-one\r\nyears, is greater than the number of persons above that age. This\r\ndifference in number is not necessary to the establishment of the\r\nprinciple I mean to lay down, but it serves to shew the justice of it\r\nmore strongly. The principle would be equally as good, if the majority\r\nin years were also the majority in numbers.\r\n\r\nThe rights of minors are as sacred as the rights of the aged. The\r\ndifference is altogether in the different age of the two parties, and\r\nnothing in the nature of the rights; the rights are the same rights;\r\nand are to be preserved inviolate for the inheritance of the minors when\r\nthey shall come of age. During the minority of minors their rights are\r\nunder the sacred guardianship of the aged. The minor cannot surrender\r\nthem; the guardian cannot dispossess him; consequently, the aged part\r\nof a nation, who are the law-makers for the time being, and who, in the\r\nmarch of life are but a few years ahead of those who are yet minors, and\r\nto whom they must shortly give place, have not and cannot have the right\r\nto make a law to set up and establish hereditary government, or, to\r\nspeak more distinctly, _an hereditary succession of governors_; because\r\nit is an attempt to deprive every minor in the nation, at the time such\r\na law is made, of his inheritance of rights when he shall come of age,\r\nand to subjugate him to a system of government to which, during his\r\nminority, he could neither consent nor object.\r\n\r\nIf a person who is a minor at the time such a law is proposed, had\r\nhappened to have been born a few years sooner, so as to be of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years at the time of proposing it, his right to have objected\r\nagainst it, to have exposed the injustice and tyrannical principles of\r\nit, and to have voted against it, will be admitted on all sides. If,\r\ntherefore, the law operates to prevent his exercising the same rights\r\nafter he comes of age as he would have had a right to exercise had he\r\nbeen of age at the time, it is undeniably a law to take away and annul\r\nthe rights of every person in the nation who shall be a minor at the\r\ntime of making such a law, and consequently the right to make it cannot\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak of government by hereditary succession, as it\r\napplies to succeeding generations; and to shew that in this case, as in\r\nthe case of minors, there does not exist in a nation a right to set it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nA nation, though continually existing, is continually in a state of\r\nrenewal and succession. It is never stationary.\r\n\r\nEvery day produces new births, carries minors forward to maturity, and\r\nold persons from the stage. In this ever running flood of generations\r\nthere is no part superior in authority to another. Could we conceive an\r\nidea of superiority in any, at what point of time, or in what century of\r\nthe world, are we to fix it? To what cause are we to ascribe it? By\r\nwhat evidence are we to prove it? By what criterion are we to know it? A\r\nsingle reflection will teach us that our ancestors, like ourselves, were\r\nbut tenants for life in the great freehold of rights. The fee-absolute\r\nwas not in them, it is not in us, it belongs to the whole family of\r\nman, thro* all ages. If we think otherwise than this, we think either as\r\nslaves or as tyrants. As slaves, if we think that any former generation\r\nhad a right to bind us; as tyrants, if we think that we have authority\r\nto bind the generations that are to follow.\r\n\r\nIt may not be inapplicable to the subject, to endeavour to define what\r\nis to be understood by a generation, in the sense the word is here used.\r\n\r\nAs a natural term its meaning is sufficiently clear. The father, the\r\nson, the grandson, are so many distinct generations. But when we speak\r\nof a generation as describing the persons in whom legal authority\r\nresides, as distinct from another generation of the same description who\r\nare to succeed them, it comprehends all those who are above the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, at the time that we count from; and a generation of\r\nthis kind will continue in authority between fourteen and twenty-one\r\nyears, that is, until the number of minors, who shall have arrived at\r\nage, shall be greater than the number of persons remaining of the former\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nFor example: if France, at this or any other moment, contains\r\ntwenty-four millions of souls, twelve millions will be males, and twelve\r\nfemales. Of the twelve millions of males, six millions will be of the\r\nage of twenty-one years, and six will be under, and the authority\r\nto govern will reside in the first six. But every day will make some\r\nalteration, and in twenty-one years every one of those minors who\r\nsurvives will have arrived at age, and the greater part of the former\r\nstock will be gone: the majority of persons then living, in whom the\r\nlegal authority resides, will be composed of those who, twenty-one years\r\nbefore, had no legal existence. Those will be fathers and grandfathers\r\nin their turn, and, in the next twenty-one years, (or less) another race\r\nof minors, arrived at age, will succeed them, and so on.\r\n\r\nAs this is ever the case, and as every generation is equal in rights to\r\nanother, it consequently follows, that there cannot be a right in any\r\nto establish government by hereditary succession, because it would be\r\nsupposing itself possessed of a right superior to the rest, namely,\r\nthat of commanding by its own authority how the world shall be hereafter\r\ngoverned and who shall govern it. Every age and generation is, and must\r\nbe, (as a matter of right,) as free to act for itself in all cases, as\r\nthe age and generation that preceded it. The vanity and presumption of\r\ngoverning beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all\r\ntyrannies. Man has no property in man, neither has one generation a\r\nproperty in the generations that are to follow.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the Rights of Man I have spoken of government by\r\nhereditary succession; and I will here close the subject with an extract\r\nfrom that work, which states it under the two following heads. (1)\r\n\r\n     1 The quotation, here omitted, will be found in vol. ii. of\r\n     this work, beginning with p. 364, and continuing, with a few\r\n     omissions, to the 15th line of p. 366. This \"Dissertation\"\r\n     was originally written for circulation in Holland, where\r\n     Paine's \"Rights of Man\" was not well known.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the English parliament furnishes an example of this kind;\r\nand which merits to be recorded, as being the greatest instance of\r\nlegislative ignorance and want of principle that is to be found in any\r\ncountry. The case is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe English parliament of 1688, imported a man and his wife from\r\nHolland, _William and Mary_, and made them king and queen of England.\r\n(2) Having done this, the said parliament made a law to convey the\r\ngovernment of the country to the heirs of William and Mary, in the\r\nfollowing words: \"We, the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, do,\r\nin the name of the people of England, most humbly and faithfully submit\r\n_ourselves, our heirs, and posterities_, to William and Mary, _their\r\nheirs and posterities_, for ever.\" And in a subsequent law, as quoted by\r\nEdmund Burke, the said parliament, in the name of the people of England\r\nthen living, _binds the said people, their heirs and posterities, to\r\nWilliam and Mary, their heirs and posterities, to the end of time_.\r\n\r\n     2 \"The Bill of Rights (temp. William III.) shows that the\r\n     Lords and Commons met not in Parliament but in convention,\r\n     that they declared against James II., and in favour of\r\n     William III.  The latter was accepted as sovereign, and, when\r\n     monarch. Acta of Parliament were passed confirming what had\r\n     been done.\"--Joseph Fisher in Notes and Queries (London),\r\n     May 2,1874. This does not affect Paine's argument, as a\r\n     Convention could have no more right to bind the future than\r\n     a Parliament.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient that we laugh at the ignorance of such law-makers;\r\nit is necessary that we reprobate their want of principle. The\r\nconstituent assembly of France, 1789, fell into the same vice as the\r\nparliament of England had done, and assumed to establish an hereditary\r\nsuccession in the family of the Capets, as an act of the constitution\r\nof that year. That every nation, _for the time being_, has a right to\r\ngovern itself as it pleases, must always be admitted; but government by\r\nhereditary succession is government for another race of people, and\r\nnot for itself; and as those on whom it is to operate are not yet in\r\nexistence, or are minors, so neither is the right in existence to set it\r\nup for them, and to assume such a right is treason against the right of\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nI here close the arguments on the first head, that of government by\r\nhereditary succession; and proceed to the second, that of government\r\nby election and representation; or, as it may be concisely expressed,\r\n_representative government_, in contra-distinction to _hereditary\r\ngovernment_.\r\n\r\nReasoning by exclusion, if _hereditary government_ has not a right to\r\nexist, and that it has not is proveable, _representative government_ is\r\nadmitted of course.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating government by election and representation, we amuse\r\nnot ourselves in enquiring when or how, or by what right, it began. Its\r\norigin is ever in view. Man is himself the origin and the evidence\r\nof the right. It appertains to him in right of his existence, and his\r\nperson is the title deed.(1)\r\n\r\nThe true and only true basis of representative government is equality of\r\nRights. Every man has a right to one vote, and no more, in the choice\r\nof representatives. The rich have no more right to exclude the poor from\r\nthe right of voting, or of electing and being elected, than the poor\r\nhave to exclude the rich; and wherever it is attempted, or proposed, on\r\neither side, it is a question of force and not of right. Who is he that\r\nwould exclude another? That other has a right to exclude him.\r\n\r\nThat which is now called aristocracy implies an inequality of rights;\r\nbut who are the persons that have a right to establish this inequality?\r\nWill the rich exclude themselves? No. Will the poor exclude themselves?\r\nNo. By what right then can any be excluded? It would be a question, if\r\nany man or class of men have a right to exclude themselves; but, be this\r\nas it may, they cannot have the right to exclude another. The poor will\r\nnot delegate such a right to the rich, nor the rich to the poor, and to\r\nassume it is not only to assume arbitrary power, but to assume a right\r\nto commit robbery. Personal rights, of which the right of voting for\r\nrepresentatives is one, are a species of property of the most sacred\r\nkind: and he that would employ his pecuniary property, or presume upon\r\nthe influence it gives him, to dispossess or rob another of his property\r\nof rights, uses that pecuniary property as he would use fire-arms, and\r\nmerits to have it taken from him.\r\n\r\n     1 \"The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for\r\n     among old parchments or musty records. They are written as\r\n     with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human nature by the\r\n     hand of Divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured\r\n     by mortal power.\"--Alexander Hamilton, 1775. (Cf. Rights of\r\n     Man, Toi. ii., p. 304): \"Portions of antiquity by proving\r\n     everything establish nothing. It is authority against\r\n     authority all the way, till we come to the divine origin of\r\n     the rights of man at the creation.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nInequality of rights is created by a combination in one part of the\r\ncommunity to exclude another part from its rights. Whenever it be made\r\nan article of a constitution, or a law, that the right of voting, or\r\nof electing and being elected, shall appertain exclusively to persons\r\npossessing a certain quantity of property, be it little or much, it is a\r\ncombination of the persons possessing that quantity to exclude those who\r\ndo not possess the same quantity. It is investing themselves with powers\r\nas a self-created part of society, to the exclusion of the rest.\r\n\r\nIt is always to be taken for granted, that those who oppose an equality\r\nof rights never mean the exclusion should take place on themselves; and\r\nin this view of the case, pardoning the vanity of the thing, aristocracy\r\nis a subject of laughter. This self-soothing vanity is encouraged by\r\nanother idea not less selfish, which is, that the opposers conceive they\r\nare playing a safe game, in which there is a chance to gain and none\r\nto lose; that at any rate the doctrine of equality includes _them_,\r\nand that if they cannot get more rights than those whom they oppose and\r\nwould exclude, they shall not have less. This opinion has already been\r\nfatal to thousands, who, not contented with _equal rights_, have sought\r\nmore till they lost all, and experienced in themselves the degrading\r\n_inequality_ they endeavoured to fix upon others.\r\n\r\nIn any view of the case it is dangerous and impolitic, sometimes\r\nridiculous, and always unjust, to make property the criterion of the\r\nright of voting. If the sum or value of the property upon which the\r\nright is to take place be considerable, it will exclude a majority of\r\nthe people, and unite them in a common interest against the government\r\nand against those who support it; and as the power is always with\r\nthe majority, they can overturn such a government and its supporters\r\nwhenever they please.\r\n\r\nIf, in order to avoid this danger, a small quantity of property be\r\nfixed, as the criterion of the right, it exhibits liberty in disgrace,\r\nby putting it in competition with accident and insignificance. When a\r\nbrood-mare shall fortunately produce a foal or a mule that, by being\r\nworth the sum in question, shall convey to its owner the right of\r\nvoting, or by its death take it from him, in whom does the origin of\r\nsuch a right exist? Is it in the man, or in the mule? When we consider\r\nhow many ways property may be acquired without merit, and lost without a\r\ncrime, we ought to spurn the idea of making it a criterion of rights.\r\n\r\nBut the offensive part of the case is, that this exclusion from the\r\nright of voting implies a stigma on the moral char* acter of the persons\r\nexcluded; and this is what no part of the community has a right to\r\npronounce upon another part. No external circumstance can justify it:\r\nwealth is no proof of moral character; nor poverty of the want of it.\r\nOn the contrary, wealth is often the presumptive evidence of dishonesty;\r\nand poverty the negative evidence of innocence. If therefore property,\r\nwhether little or much, be made a criterion, the means by which that\r\nproperty has been acquired ought to be made a criterion also.\r\n\r\nThe only ground upon which exclusion from the right of voting is\r\nconsistent with justice, would be to inflict it as a punishment for a\r\ncertain time upon those who should propose to take away that right from\r\nothers. The right of voting for representatives is the primary right by\r\nwhich other rights are protected. To take away this right is to reduce\r\na man to slavery, for slavery consists in being subject to the will of\r\nanother, and he that has not a vote in the election of representatives\r\nis in this case. The proposal therefore to disfranchise any class of men\r\nis as criminal as the proposal to take away property. When we speak\r\nof right, we ought always to unite with it the idea of duties: rights\r\nbecome duties by reciprocity. The right which I enjoy becomes my duty\r\nto guarantee it to another, and he to me; and those who violate the duty\r\njustly incur a forfeiture of the right.\r\n\r\nIn a political view of the case, the strength and permanent security\r\nof government is in proportion to the number of people interested in\r\nsupporting it. The true policy therefore is to interest the whole by\r\nan equality of rights, for the danger arises from exclusions. It is\r\npossible to exclude men from the right of voting, but it is impossible\r\nto exclude them from the right of rebelling against that exclusion; and\r\nwhen all other rights are taken away, the right of rebellion is made\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nWhile men could be persuaded they had no rights, or that rights\r\nappertained only to a certain class of men, or that government was a\r\nthing existing in right of itself, it was not difficult to govern\r\nthem authoritatively. The ignorance in which they were held, and the\r\nsuperstition in which they were instructed, furnished the means of doing\r\nit. But when the ignorance is gone, and the superstition with it; when\r\nthey perceive the imposition that has been acted upon them; when they\r\nreflect that the cultivator and the manufacturer are the primary\r\nmeans of all the wealth that exists in the world, beyond what nature\r\nspontaneously produces; when they begin to feel their consequence by\r\ntheir usefulness, and their right as members of society, it is then no\r\nlonger possible to govern them as before. The fraud once detected\r\ncannot be re-acted. To attempt it is to provoke derision, or invite\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThat property will ever be unequal is certain. Industry, superiority\r\nof talents, dexterity of management, extreme frugality, fortunate\r\nopportunities, or the opposite, or the means of those things, will ever\r\nproduce that effect, without having recourse to the harsh, ill sounding\r\nnames of avarice and oppression; and besides this, there are some men\r\nwho, though they do not despise wealth, will not stoop to the drudgery\r\nor the means of acquiring it, nor will be troubled with it beyond their\r\nwants or their independence; whilst in others there is an avidity to\r\nobtain it by every means not punishable; it makes the sole business of\r\ntheir lives, and they follow it as a religion. All that is required\r\nwith respect to property is to obtain it honestly, and not employ it\r\ncriminally; but it is always criminally employed when it is made a\r\ncriterion for exclusive rights.\r\n\r\nIn institutions that are purely pecuniary, such as that of a bank or a\r\ncommercial company, the rights of the members composing that company are\r\nwholly created by the property they invest therein; and no other rights\r\nare represented in the government of that company, than what arise out\r\nof that property; neither has that government cognizance of _any thing\r\nbut property_.\r\n\r\nBut the case is totally different with respect to the institution of\r\ncivil government, organized on the system of representation. Such a\r\ngovernment has cognizance of every thing, and of _every man_ as a member\r\nof the national society, whether he has property or not; and, therefore,\r\nthe principle requires that _every man_, and _every kind of right_, be\r\nrepresented, of which the right to acquire and to hold property is but\r\none, and that not of the most essential kind. The protection of a man's\r\nperson is more sacred than the protection of property; and besides\r\nthis, the faculty of performing any kind of work or services by which\r\nhe acquires a livelihood, or maintaining his family, is of the nature of\r\nproperty. It is property to him; he has acquired it; and it is as much\r\nthe object of his protection as exterior property, possessed without\r\nthat faculty, can be the object of protection in another person.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that the best security for property, be it much\r\nor little, is to remove from every part of the community, as far as\r\ncan possibly be done, every cause of complaint, and every motive to\r\nviolence; and this can only be done by an equality of rights. When\r\nrights are secure, property is secure in consequence. But when property\r\nis made a pretence for unequal or exclusive rights, it weakens the right\r\nto hold the property, and provokes indignation and tumult; for it is\r\nunnatural to believe that property can be secure under the guarantee of\r\na society injured in its rights by the influence of that property.\r\n\r\nNext to the injustice and ill-policy of making property a pretence\r\nfor exclusive rights, is the unaccountable absurdity of giving to mere\r\n_sound_ the idea of property, and annexing to it certain rights; for\r\nwhat else is a _title_ but sound? Nature is often giving to the world\r\nsome extraordinary men who arrive at fame by merit and universal\r\nconsent, such as Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, &c. They were truly great\r\nor noble.\r\n\r\nBut when government sets up a manufactory of nobles, it is as absurd\r\nas if she undertook to manufacture wise men. Her nobles are all\r\ncounterfeits.\r\n\r\nThis wax-work order has assumed the name of aristocracy; and the\r\ndisgrace of it would be lessened if it could be considered only as\r\nchildish imbecility. We pardon foppery because of its insignificance»\r\nand on the same ground we might pardon the foppery of Titles. But the\r\norigin of aristocracy was worse than foppery. It was robbery. The\r\nfirst aristocrats in all countries were brigands. Those of later times,\r\nsycophants.\r\n\r\nIt is very well known that in England, (and the same will be found\r\nin other countries) the great landed estates now held in descent were\r\nplundered from the quiet inhabitants at the conquest. The possibility\r\ndid not exist of acquiring such estates honestly. If it be asked how\r\nthey could have been acquired, no answer but that of robbery can\r\nbe given. That they were not acquired by trade, by commerce, by\r\nmanufactures, by agriculture, or by any reputable employment, is\r\ncertain. How then were they acquired? Blush, aristocracy, to hear your\r\norigin, for your progenitors were Thieves. They were the Robespierres\r\nand the Jacobins of that day. When they had committed the robbery, they\r\nendeavoured to lose the disgrace of it by sinking their real names under\r\nfictitious ones, which they called Titles. It is ever the practice of\r\nFelons to act in this manner. They never pass by their real names.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This and the preceding paragraph have been omitted from\r\n     some editions.--Editor.\r\n\r\nAs property, honestly obtained, is best secured by an equality of\r\nRights, so ill-gotten property depends for protection on a monopoly of\r\nrights. He who has robbed another of his property, will next endeavour\r\nto disarm him of his rights, to secure that property; for when the\r\nrobber becomes the legislator he believes himself secure. That part\r\nof the government of England that is called the house of lords, was\r\noriginally composed of persons who had committed the robberies of which\r\nI have been speaking. It was an association for the protection of the\r\nproperty they had stolen.\r\n\r\nBut besides the criminality of the origin of aristocracy, it has an\r\ninjurious effect on the moral and physical character of man. Like\r\nslavery it debilitates the human faculties; for as the mind bowed down\r\nby slavery loses in silence its elastic powers, so, in the contrary\r\nextreme, when it is buoyed up by folly, it becomes incapable of exerting\r\nthem, and dwindles into imbecility. It is impossible that a mind\r\nemployed upon ribbands and titles can ever be great. The childishness of\r\nthe objects consumes the man.\r\n\r\nIt is at all times necessary, and more particularly so during the\r\nprogress of a revolution, and until right ideas confirm themselves by\r\nhabit, that we frequently refresh our patriotism by reference to first\r\nprinciples. It is by tracing things to their origin that we learn to\r\nunderstand them: and it is by keeping that line and that origin always\r\nin view that we never forget them.\r\n\r\nAn enquiry into the origin of Rights will demonstrate to us that\r\n_rights_ are not _gifts_ from one man to another, nor from one class of\r\nmen to another; for who is he who could be the first giver, or by what\r\nprinciple, or on what authority, could he possess the right of giving? A\r\ndeclaration of rights is not a creation of them, nor a donation of them.\r\nIt is a manifest of the principle by which they exist, followed by a\r\ndetail of what the rights are; for every civil right has a natural\r\nright for its foundation, and it includes the principle of a reciprocal\r\nguarantee of those rights from man to man. As, therefore, it is\r\nimpossible to discover any origin of rights otherwise than in the origin\r\nof man, it consequently follows, that rights appertain to man in right\r\nof his existence only, and must therefore be equal to every man. The\r\nprinciple of an _equality of rights_ is clear and simple. Every man can\r\nunderstand it, and it is by understanding his rights that he learns his\r\nduties; for where the rights of men are equal, every man must finally\r\nsee the necessity of protecting the rights of others as the most\r\neffectual security for his own. But if, in the formation of a\r\nconstitution, we depart from the principle of equal rights, or attempt\r\nany modification of it, we plunge into a labyrinth of difficulties from\r\nwhich there is no way out but by retreating. Where are we to stop? Or\r\nby what principle are we to find out the point to stop at, that shall\r\ndiscriminate between men of the same country, part of whom shall be\r\nfree, and the rest not? If property is to be made the criterion, it is\r\na total departure from every moral principle of liberty, because it\r\nis attaching rights to mere matter, and making man the agent of that\r\nmatter. It is, moreover, holding up property as an apple of discord,\r\nand not only exciting but justifying war against it; for I maintain the\r\nprinciple, that when property is used as an instrument to take away the\r\nrights of those who may happen not to possess property, it is used to an\r\nunlawful purpose, as fire-arms would be in a similar case.\r\n\r\nIn a state of nature all men are equal in rights, but they are not equal\r\nin power; the weak cannot protect themselves against the strong. This\r\nbeing the case, the institution of civil society is for the purpose\r\nof making an equalization of powers that shall be parallel to, and\r\na guarantee of, the equality of rights. The laws of a country, when\r\nproperly constructed, apply to this purpose. Every man takes the arm of\r\nthe law for his protection as more effectual than his own; and therefore\r\nevery man has an equal right in the formation of the government, and\r\nof the laws by which he is to be governed and judged. In extensive\r\ncountries and societies, such as America and France, this right in the\r\nindividual can only be exercised by delegation, that is, by election and\r\nrepresentation; and hence it is that the institution of representative\r\ngovernment arises.\r\n\r\nHitherto, I have confined myself to matters of principle only. First,\r\nthat hereditary government has not a right to exist; that it cannot be\r\nestablished on any principle of right; and that it is a violation of all\r\nprinciple. Secondly, that government by election and representation has\r\nits origin in the natural and eternal rights of man; for whether a man\r\nbe his own lawgiver, as he would be in a state of nature; or whether he\r\nexercises his portion of legislative sovereignty in his own person, as\r\nmight be the case in small democracies where all could assemble for the\r\nformation of the laws by which they were to be governed; or whether he\r\nexercises it in the choice of persons to represent him in a national\r\nassembly of representatives, the origin of the right is the same in\r\nall cases. The first, as is before observed, is defective in power; the\r\nsecond, is practicable only in democracies of small extent; the third,\r\nis the greatest scale upon which human government can be instituted.\r\n\r\nNext to matters of _principle_ are matters of _opinion_, and it is\r\nnecessary to distinguish between the two. Whether the rights of men\r\nshall be equal is not a matter of opinion but of right, and consequently\r\nof principle; for men do not hold their rights as grants from each\r\nother, but each one in right of himself. Society is the guardian but not\r\nthe giver. And as in extensive societies, such as America and France,\r\nthe right of the individual in matters of government cannot be exercised\r\nbut by election and representation, it consequently follows that the\r\nonly system of government consistent with principle, where simple\r\ndemocracy is impracticable, is the representative system. But as to the\r\norganical part, or the manner in which the several parts of government\r\nshall be arranged and composed, it is altogether _matter of opinion_,\r\nIt is necessary that all the parts be conformable with the _principle of\r\nequal rights_; and so long as this principle be religiously adhered to,\r\nno very material error can take place, neither can any error continue\r\nlong in that part which falls within the province of opinion.\r\n\r\nIn all matters of opinion, the social compact, or the principle by which\r\nsociety is held together, requires that the majority of opinions becomes\r\nthe rule for the whole, and that the minority yields practical obedience\r\nthereto. This is perfectly conformable to the principle of equal rights:\r\nfor, in the first place, every man has a _right to give an opinion_ but\r\nno man has a right that his opinion should _govern the rest_. In the\r\nsecond place, it is not supposed to be known beforehand on which side\r\nof any question, whether for or against, any man's opinion will fall.\r\nHe may happen to be in a majority upon some questions, and in a minority\r\nupon others; and by the same rule that he expects obedience in the one\r\ncase, he must yield it in the other. All the disorders that have arisen\r\nin France, during the progress of the revolution, have had their origin,\r\nnot in the _principle of equal rights_, but in the violation of that\r\nprinciple. The principle of equal rights has been repeatedly violated,\r\nand that not by the majority but by the minority, and _that minority\r\nhas been composed of men possessing property as well as of men without\r\nproperty; property, therefore, even upon the experience already had,\r\nis no more a criterion of character than it is of rights_. It will\r\nsometimes happen that the minority are right, and the majority are\r\nwrong, but as soon as experience proves this to be the case, the\r\nminority will increase to a majority, and the error will reform itself\r\nby the tranquil operation of freedom of opinion and equality of rights.\r\nNothing, therefore, can justify an insurrection, neither can it ever be\r\nnecessary where rights are equal and opinions free.\r\n\r\nTaking then the principle of equal rights as the foundation of the\r\nrevolution, and consequently of the constitution, the organical part,\r\nor the manner in which the several parts of the government shall be\r\narranged in the constitution, will, as is already said, fall within the\r\nprovince of opinion.\r\n\r\nVarious methods will present themselves upon a question of this kind,\r\nand tho' experience is yet wanting to determine which is the best,\r\nit has, I think, sufficiently decided which is the worst. That is\r\nthe worst, which in its deliberations and decisions is subject to\r\nthe precipitancy and passion of an individual; and when the whole\r\nlegislature is crowded into one body it is an individual in mass. In all\r\ncases of deliberation it is necessary to have a corps of reserve, and it\r\nwould be better to divide the representation by lot into two parts, and\r\nlet them revise and correct each other, than that the whole should sit\r\ntogether, and debate at once.\r\n\r\nRepresentative government is not necessarily confined to any one\r\nparticular form. The principle is the same in all the forms under which\r\nit can be arranged. The equal rights of the people is the root from\r\nwhich the whole springs, and the branches may be arranged as present\r\nopinion or future experience shall best direct. As to that _hospital of\r\nincurables_ (as Chesterfield calls it), the British house of peers,\r\nit is an excrescence growing out of corruption; and there is no more\r\naffinity or resemblance between any of the branches of a legislative\r\nbody originating from the right of the people, and the aforesaid\r\nhouse of peers, than between a regular member of the human body and an\r\nulcerated wen.\r\n\r\nAs to that part of government that is called the _executive_, it is\r\nnecessary in the first place to fix a precise meaning to the word.\r\n\r\nThere are but two divisions into which power can be arranged. First,\r\nthat of willing or decreeing the laws; secondly, that of executing or\r\nputting them in practice. The former corresponds to the intellectual\r\nfaculties of the human mind, which reasons and determines what shall be\r\ndone; the second, to the mechanical powers of the human body, that puts\r\nthat determination into practice.(1) If the former decides, and the\r\nlatter does not perform, it is a state of imbecility; and if the latter\r\nacts without the predetermination of the former, it is a state\r\nof lunacy. The executive department therefore is official, and is\r\nsubordinate to the legislative, as the body is to the mind, in a\r\nstate of health; for it is impossible to conceive the idea of two\r\nsovereignties, a sovereignty to _will_, and a sovereignty to _act_.\r\nThe executive is not invested with the power of deliberating whether it\r\nshall act or not; it has no discretionary authority in the case; for it\r\ncan _act no other thing_ than what the laws decree, and it is _obliged_\r\nto act conformably thereto; and in this view of the case, the executive\r\nis made up of all the official departments that execute the laws, of\r\nwhich that which is called the judiciary is the chief.\r\n\r\n     1 Paine may have had in mind the five senses, with reference\r\n     to the proposed five members of the Directory.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut mankind have conceived an idea that _some kind of authority_ is\r\nnecessary to _superintend_ the execution of the laws and to see\r\nthat they are faithfully performed; and it is by confounding this\r\nsuperintending authority with the official execution that we get\r\nembarrassed about the term _executive power_. All the parts in the\r\ngovernments of the United States of America that are called THE\r\nEXECUTIVE, are no other than authorities to superintend the execution of\r\nthe laws; and they are so far independent of the legislative, that they\r\nknow the legislative only thro' the laws, and cannot be controuled or\r\ndirected by it through any other medium.\r\n\r\nIn what manner this superintending authority shall be appointed, or\r\ncomposed, is a matter that falls within the province of opinion. Some\r\nmay prefer one method and some another; and in all cases, where opinion\r\nonly and not principle is concerned, the majority of opinions forms the\r\nrule for all. There are however some things deducible from reason, and\r\nevidenced by experience, that serve to guide our decision upon the case.\r\nThe one is, never to invest any individual with extraordinary power; for\r\nbesides his being tempted to misuse it, it will excite contention and\r\ncommotion in the nation for the office. Secondly, never to invest power\r\nlong in the hands of any number of individuals. The inconveniences that\r\nmay be supposed to accompany frequent changes are less to be feared than\r\nthe danger that arises from long continuance.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this discourse with offering some observations on the\r\nmeans of _preserving liberty_; for it is not only necessary that we\r\nestablish it, but that we preserve it.\r\n\r\nIt is, in the first place, necessary that we distinguish between the\r\nmeans made use of to overthrow despotism, in order to prepare the way\r\nfor the establishment of liberty, and the means to be used after the\r\ndespotism is overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe means made use of in the first case are justified by necessity.\r\nThose means are, in general, insurrections; for whilst the established\r\ngovernment of despotism continues in any country it is scarcely possible\r\nthat any other means can be used. It is also certain that in the\r\ncommencement of a revolution, the revolutionary party permit to\r\nthemselves a _discretionary exercise of power_ regulated more by\r\ncircumstances than by principle, which, were the practice to continue,\r\nliberty would never be established, or if established would soon be\r\noverthrown. It is never to be expected in a revolution that every man is\r\nto change his opinion at the same moment. There never yet was any truth\r\nor any principle so irresistibly obvious, that all men believed it\r\nat once. Time and reason must co-operate with each other to the final\r\nestablishment of any principle; and therefore those who may happen to be\r\nfirst convinced have not a right to persecute others, on whom conviction\r\noperates more slowly. The moral principle of revolutions is to instruct,\r\nnot to destroy.\r\n\r\nHad a constitution been established two years ago, (as ought to have\r\nbeen done,) the violences that have since desolated France and injured\r\nthe character of the revolution, would, in my opinion, have been\r\nprevented.(1) The nation would then have had a bond of union, and every\r\nindividual would have known the line of conduct he was to follow. But,\r\ninstead of this, a revolutionary government, a thing without either\r\nprinciple or authority, was substituted in its place; virtue and crime\r\ndepended upon accident; and that which was patriotism one day, became\r\ntreason the next. All these things have followed from the want of a\r\nconstitution; for it is the nature and intention of a constitution to\r\n_prevent governing by party_, by establishing a common principle that\r\nshall limit and control the power and impulse of party, and that says to\r\nall parties, _thus far shalt thou go and no further_. But in the absence\r\nof a constitution, men look entirely to party; and instead of principle\r\ngoverning party, party governs principle.\r\n\r\n     1 The Constitution adopted August 10, 1793, was by the\r\n     determination of \"The Mountain,\" suspended during the war\r\n     against France. The revolutionary government was thus made\r\n     chronic--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAn avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty. It leads men to\r\nstretch, to misinterpret, and to misapply even the best of laws. He\r\nthat would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from\r\noppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent\r\nthat will reach to himself. Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nParis, July, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. THE CONSTITUTION OF 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL CONVENTION, JULY 7, 1795.\r\n\r\nOn the motion of Lanthenas, \"That permission be granted to Thomas\r\nPaine, to deliver his sentiments on the declaration of rights and the\r\nconstitution,\" Thomas Paine ascended the Tribune; and no opposition\r\nbeing made to the motion, one of the Secretaries, who stood by Mr.\r\nPaine, read his speech, of which the following is a literal translation:\r\n\r\nCitizens:\r\n\r\nThe effects of a malignant fever, with which I was afflicted during a\r\nrigorous confinement in the Luxembourg, have thus long prevented me from\r\nattending at my post in the bosom of the Convention, and the magnitude\r\nof the subject under discussion, and no other consideration on earth,\r\ncould induce me now to repair to my station.\r\n\r\nA recurrence to the vicissitudes I have experienced, and the critical\r\nsituations in which I have been placed in consequence of the French\r\nRevolution, will throw upon what I now propose to submit to the\r\nConvention the most unequivocal proofs of my integrity, and the\r\nrectitude of those principles which have uniformly influenced my\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nIn England I was proscribed for having vindicated the French Revolution,\r\nand I have suffered a rigorous imprisonment in France for having pursued\r\na similar mode of conduct. During the reign of terrorism, I was a close\r\nprisoner for eight long months, and remained so above three months after\r\nthe era of the 10th Thermidor.(1) I ought, however, to state, that I\r\nwas not persecuted by the _people_ either of England or France. The\r\nproceedings in both countries were the effects of the despotism existing\r\nin their respective governments. But, even if my persecution had\r\noriginated in the people at large, my principles and conduct would still\r\nhave remained the same. Principles which are influenced and subject to\r\nthe controul of tyranny, have not their foundation in the heart.\r\n\r\n     1 By the French republican calendar this was nearly the\r\n     time. Paine's imprisonment lasted from December 28, 1793, to\r\n     November 4, 1794. He was by a unanimous vote recalled to the\r\n     Convention, Dec 7, 1794, but his first appearance there was\r\n     on July 7, 1795.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nA few days ago, I transmitted to you by the ordinary mode of\r\ndistribution, a short Treatise, entitled \"Dissertation on the First\r\nPrinciples of Government.\" This little work I did intend to have\r\ndedicated to the people of Holland, who, about the time I began to write\r\nit, were determined to accomplish a Revolution in their Government,\r\nrather than to the people of France, who had long before effected that\r\nglorious object. But there are, in the Constitution which is about to\r\nbe ratified by the Convention certain articles, and in the report which\r\npreceded it certain points, so repugnant to reason, and incompatible\r\nwith the true principles of liberty, as to render this Treatise, drawn\r\nup for another purpose, applicable to the present occasion, and under\r\nthis impression I presumed to submit it to your consideration.\r\n\r\nIf there be faults in the Constitution, it were better to expunge them\r\nnow, than to abide the event of their mischievous tendency; for certain\r\nit is, that the plan of the Constitution which has been presented to you\r\nis not consistent with the grand object of the Revolution, nor congenial\r\nto the sentiments of the individuals who accomplished it.\r\n\r\nTo deprive half the people in a nation of their rights as citizens,\r\nis an easy matter in theory or on paper: but it is a most dangerous\r\nexperiment, and rarely practicable in the execution.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to the observations I have to offer on this\r\nimportant subject; and I pledge myself that they shall be neither\r\nnumerous nor diffusive.\r\n\r\nIn my apprehension, a constitution embraces two distinct parts or\r\nobjects, the _Principle_ and the _Practice_; and it is not only an\r\nessential but an indispensable provision that the practice should\r\nemanate from, and accord with, the principle. Now I maintain, that the\r\nreverse of this proposition is the case in the plan of the Constitution\r\nunder discussion. The first article, for instance, of the _political\r\nstate_ of citizens, (v. Title ii. of the Constitution,) says:\r\n\r\n\"Every man born and resident in France, who, being twenty-one years of\r\nage, has inscribed his name on the Civic Register of his Canton, and who\r\nhas lived afterwards one year on the territory of the Republic, and who\r\npays any direct contribution whatever, real or personal, is a French\r\ncitizen.\" (1)\r\n\r\n     1 The article as ultimately adopted substituted \"person\" for\r\n     \"man,\" and for \"has inscribed his name\" (a slight\r\n     educational test) inserted \"whose name is inscribed.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nI might here ask, if those only who come under the above description are\r\nto be considered as citizens, what designation do you mean to give the\r\nrest of the people? I allude to that portion of the people on whom the\r\nprincipal part of the labour falls, and on whom the weight of indirect\r\ntaxation will in the event chiefly press. In the structure of the social\r\nfabric, this class of people are infinitely superior to that privileged\r\norder whose only qualification is their wealth or territorial\r\npossessions. For what is trade without merchants? What is land without\r\ncultivation? And what is the produce of the land without manufactures?\r\nBut to return to the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this article is incompatible with the three first\r\narticles of the Declaration of Rights, which precede the Constitutional\r\nAct.\r\n\r\nThe first article of the Declaration of Rights says:\r\n\r\n\"The end of society is the public good; and the institution of\r\ngovernment is to secure to every individual the enjoyment of his\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nBut the article of the Constitution to which I have just adverted\r\nproposes as the object of society, not the public good, or in other\r\nwords, the good of _all_, but a partial good; or the good only of a\r\n_few_; and the Constitution provides solely for the rights of this few,\r\nto the exclusion of the many.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the Declaration of Rights says:\r\n\r\n\"The Rights of Man in society are Liberty, Equality, Security of his\r\nperson and property.\"\r\n\r\nBut the article alluded to in the Constitution has a direct tendency to\r\nestablish the reverse of this position, inasmuch as the persons excluded\r\nby this _inequality_ can neither be said to possess liberty, nor\r\nsecurity against oppression. They are consigned totally to the caprice\r\nand tyranny of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe third article of the Declaration of Rights says:\r\n\r\n\"Liberty consists in such acts of volition as are not injurious to\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nBut the article of the Constitution, on which I have observed, breaks\r\ndown this barrier. It enables the liberty of one part of society to\r\ndestroy the freedom of the other.\r\n\r\nHaving thus pointed out the inconsistency of this article to the\r\nDeclaration of Rights, I shall proceed to comment on that of the same\r\narticle which makes a direct contribution a necessary qualification to\r\nthe right of citizenship.\r\n\r\nA modern refinement on the object of public revenue has divided the\r\ntaxes, or contributions, into two classes, the _direct_ and the_\r\nindirect_, without being able to define precisely the distinction or\r\ndifference between them, because the effect of both is the same.\r\n\r\nThose are designated indirect taxes which fall upon the consumers of\r\ncertain articles, on which the tax is imposed, because, the tax being\r\nincluded in the price, the consumer pays it without taking notice of it.\r\n\r\nThe same observation is applicable to the territorial tax. The land\r\nproprietors, in order to reimburse themselves, will rack-rent their\r\ntenants: the farmer, of course, will transfer the obligation to the\r\nmiller, by enhancing the price of grain; the miller to the baker, by\r\nincreasing the price of flour; and the baker to the consumer, by raising\r\nthe price of bread. The territorial tax, therefore, though called\r\n_direct_, is, in its consequences, _indirect_.\r\n\r\nTo this tax the land proprietor contributes only in proportion to the\r\nquantity of bread and other provisions that are consumed in his own\r\nfamily. The deficit is furnished by the great mass of the community,\r\nwhich comprehends every individual of the nation.\r\n\r\nFrom the logical distinction between the direct and in-direct taxation,\r\nsome emolument may result, I allow, to auditors of public accounts, &c.,\r\nbut to the people at large I deny that such a distinction (which by the\r\nby is without a difference) can be productive of any practical\r\nbenefit. It ought not, therefore, to be admitted as a principle in the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nBesides this objection, the provision in question does not affect to\r\ndefine, secure, or establish the right of citizenship. It consigns to\r\nthe caprice or discretion of the legislature the power of pronouncing\r\nwho shall, or shall not, exercise the functions of a citizen; and\r\nthis may be done effectually, either by the imposition of a _direct or\r\nindirect_ tax, according to the selfish views of the legislators, or by\r\nthe mode of collecting the taxes so imposed.\r\n\r\nNeither a tenant who occupies an extensive farm, nor a merchant or\r\nmanufacturer who may have embarked a large capital in their respective\r\npursuits, can ever, according to this system, attain the preemption\r\nof a citizen. On the other hand, any upstart, who has, by succession\r\nor management, got possession of a few acres of land or a miserable\r\ntenement, may exultingly exercise the functions of a citizen, although\r\nperhaps neither possesses a hundredth part of the worth or property of a\r\nsimple mechanic, nor contributes in any proportion to the exigencies of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThe contempt in which the old government held mercantile pursuits, and\r\nthe obloquy that attached on merchants and manufacturers, contributed\r\nnot a little to its embarrassments, and its eventual subversion; and,\r\nstrange to tell, though the mischiefs arising from this mode of conduct\r\nare so obvious, yet an article is proposed for your adoption which has a\r\nmanifest tendency to restore a defect inherent in the monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to the second article of the same Title, with which\r\nI shall conclude my remarks.\r\n\r\nThe second article says, \"Every French soldier, who shall have served\r\none or more campaigns in the cause of liberty, is deemed a citizen\r\nof the republic, without any respect or reference to other\r\nqualifications.\"(1)\r\n\r\nIt would seem, that in this Article the Committee were desirous of\r\nextricating themselves from a dilemma into which they had been plunged\r\nby the preceding article. When men depart from an established principle\r\nthey are compelled to resort to trick and subterfuge, always shifting\r\ntheir means to preserve the unity of their objects; and as it rarely\r\nhappens that the first expedient makes amends for the prostitution of\r\nprinciple, they must call in aid a second, of a more flagrant nature,\r\nto supply the deficiency of the former. In this manner legislators go\r\non accumulating error upon error, and artifice upon artifice, until\r\nthe mass becomes so bulky and incongruous, and their embarrassment so\r\ndesperate, that they are compelled, as their last expedient, to resort\r\nto the very principle they had violated. The Committee were precisely\r\nin this predicament when they framed this article; and to me, I confess,\r\ntheir conduct appears specious rather than efficacious.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 This article eventually stood: \"All Frenchmen who shall\r\n     have made one or more campaigns for the establishment of the\r\n     Republic, are citizens, without condition as to taxes.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 The head of the Committee (eleven) was the Abbé Sieves,\r\n     whose political treachery was well known to Paine before it\r\n     became known to the world by his services to Napoleon in\r\n     overthrowing the Republic.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nIt was not for himself alone, but for his family, that the French\r\ncitizen, at the dawn of the revolution, (for then indeed every man\r\nwas considered a citizen) marched soldier-like to the frontiers, and\r\nrepelled a foreign invasion. He had it not in his contemplation, that he\r\nshould enjoy liberty for the residue of his earthly career, and by his\r\nown act preclude his offspring from that inestimable blessing. No! He\r\nwished to leave it as an inheritance to his children, and that they\r\nmight hand it down to their latest posterity. If a Frenchman, who united\r\nin his person the character of a Soldier and a Citizen, was now to\r\nreturn from the army to his peaceful habitation, he must address his\r\nsmall family in this manner: \"Sorry I am, that I cannot leave to you\r\na small portion of what I have acquired by exposing my person to\r\nthe ferocity of our enemies and defeating their machinations. I have\r\nestablished the republic, and, painful the reflection, all the laurels\r\nwhich I have won in the field are blasted, and all the privileges to\r\nwhich my exertions have entitled me extend not beyond the period of\r\nmy own existence!\" Thus the measure that has been adopted by way of\r\nsubterfuge falls short of what the framers of it speculated upon; for\r\nin conciliating the affections of the _Soldier_, they have subjected\r\nthe _Father_ to the most pungent sensations, by obliging him to adopt a\r\ngeneration of Slaves.\r\n\r\nCitizens, a great deal has been urged respecting insurrections. I am\r\nconfident that no man has a greater abhorrence of them than myself, and\r\nI am sorry that any insinuations should have been thrown out upon me\r\nas a promoter of violence of any kind. The whole tenor of my life and\r\nconversation gives the lie to those calumnies, and proves me to be a\r\nfriend to order, truth and justice.\r\n\r\nI hope you will attribute this effusion of my sentiments to my anxiety\r\nfor the honor and success of the revolution. I have no interest distinct\r\nfrom that which has a tendency to meliorate the situation of mankind.\r\nThe revolution, as far as it respects myself, has been productive of\r\nmore loss and persecution than it is possible for me to describe, or for\r\nyou to indemnify. But with respect to the subject under consideration, I\r\ncould not refrain from declaring my sentiments.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if you subvert the basis of the revolution, if you\r\ndispense with principles, and substitute expedients, you will extinguish\r\nthat enthusiasm and energy which have hitherto been the life and soul of\r\nthe revolution; and you will substitute in its place nothing but a\r\ncold indifference and self-interest, which will again degenerate into\r\nintrigue, cunning, and effeminacy.\r\n\r\nBut to discard all considerations of a personal and subordinate nature,\r\nit is essential to the well-being of the republic that the practical or\r\norganic part of the constitution should correspond with its principles;\r\nand as this does not appear to be the case in the plan that has been\r\npresented to you, it is absolutely necessary that it should be submitted\r\nto the revision of a committee, who should be instructed to compare it\r\nwith the Declaration of Rights, in order to ascertain the difference\r\nbetween the two, and to make such alterations as shall render them\r\nperfectly consistent and compatible with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF FINANCE.(1)\r\n\r\n     \"On the verge, nay even in the gulph of bankruptcy.\"\r\n\r\n     1 This pamphlet, as Paine predicts at its close (no doubt on\r\n     good grounds), was translated into all languages of Europe,\r\n     and probably hastened the gold suspension of the Bank of\r\n     England (1797), which it predicted. The British Government\r\n     entrusted its reply to Ralph Broome and George Chalmers, who\r\n     wrote pamphlets. There is in the French Archives an order\r\n     for 1000 copies, April 27, 1796, nineteen days after Paine's\r\n     pamphlet appeared. \"Mr. Cobbett has made this little\r\n     pamphlet a text-book for most of his elaborate treatises on\r\n     our finances.... On the authority of a late Register of Mr.\r\n     Cobbett's I learn that the profits arising from the sale of\r\n     this pamphlet were devoted [by Paine] to the relief of the\r\n     prisoners confined in Newgate for debt.\"--\"Life of Paine,\"\r\n     by Richard Carlile, 1819.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebates in Parliament.\r\n\r\nNothing, they say, is more certain than death, and nothing more\r\nuncertain than the time of dying; yet we can always fix a period beyond\r\nwhich man cannot live, and within some moment of which he will die. We\r\nare enabled to do this, not by any spirit of prophecy, or foresight into\r\nthe event, but by observation of what has happened in all cases of human\r\nor animal existence. If then any other subject, such, for instance, as\r\na system of finance, exhibits in its progress a series of symptoms\r\nindicating decay, its final dissolution is certain, and the period of it\r\ncan be calculated from the symptoms it exhibits.\r\n\r\nThose who have hitherto written on the English system of finance, (the\r\nfunding system,) have been uniformly impressed with the idea that its\r\ndownfall would happen _some time or other_. They took, however, no data\r\nfor their opinion, but expressed it predictively,--or merely as opinion,\r\nfrom a conviction that the perpetual duration of such a system was a\r\nnatural impossibility. It is in this manner that Dr. Price has spoken of\r\nit; and Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, has spoken in the same manner;\r\nthat is, merely as opinion without data. \"The progress,\" says Smith,\r\n\"of the enormous debts, which at present oppress, and will in the long\r\nrun _most probably ruin_, all the great nations of Europe [he should\r\nhave said _governments_] has been pretty uniform.\" But this general\r\nmanner of speaking, though it might make some impression, carried with\r\nit no conviction.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to predict any thing; but I will show from data\r\nalready known, from symptoms and facts which the English funding system\r\nhas already exhibited publicly, that it will not continue to the end of\r\nMr. Pitt's life, supposing him to live the usual age of a man. How much\r\nsooner it may fall, I leave to others to predict.\r\n\r\nLet financiers diversify systems of credit as they will, it _is_\r\nnevertheless true, that every system of credit is a system of paper\r\nmoney. Two experiments have already been had upon paper money; the one\r\nin America, the other in France. In both those cases the whole capital\r\nwas emitted, and that whole capital, which in America was called\r\ncontinental money, and in France assignats, appeared in circulation; the\r\nconsequence of which was, that the quantity became so enormous, and so\r\ndisproportioned to the quantity of population, and to the quantity' of\r\nobjects upon which it could be employed, that the market, if I may so\r\nexpress it, was glutted with it, and the value of it fell. Between five\r\nand six years determined the fate of those experiments. The same fate\r\nwould have happened to gold and silver, could gold and silver have been\r\nissued in the same abundant manner that paper had been, and confined\r\nwithin the country as paper money always is, by having no circulation\r\nout of it; or, to speak on a larger scale, the same thing would happen\r\nin the world, could the world be glutted with gold and silver, as\r\nAmerica and France have been with paper.\r\n\r\nThe English system differs from that of America and France in this one\r\nparticular, that its capital is kept out of sight; that is, it does\r\nnot appear in circulation. Were the whole capital of the national debt,\r\nwhich at the time I write this is almost one hundred million pounds\r\nsterling, to be emitted in assignats or bills, and that whole quantity\r\nput into circulation, as was done in America and in France, those\r\nEnglish assignats, or bills, would soon sink in value as those of\r\nAmerica and France have done; and that in a greater degree, because\r\nthe quantity of them would be more disproportioned to the quantity\r\nof population in England, than was the case in either of the other two\r\ncountries. A nominal pound sterling in such bills would not be worth one\r\npenny.\r\n\r\nBut though the English system, by thus keeping the capital out of sight,\r\nis preserved from hasty destruction, as in the case of America and\r\nFrance, it nevertheless approaches the same fate, and will arrive at it\r\nwith the same certainty, though by a slower progress. The difference\r\nis altogether in the degree of speed by which the two systems approach\r\ntheir fate, which, to speak in round numbers, is as twenty is to one;\r\nthat is, the English system, that of funding the capital instead of\r\nissuing it, contained within itself a capacity of enduring twenty times\r\nlonger than the systems adopted by America and France; and at the end of\r\nthat time it would arrive at the same common grave, the Potter's Field\r\nof paper money.\r\n\r\nThe datum, I take for this proportion of twenty to one, is the\r\ndifference between a capital and the interest at five per cent. Twenty\r\ntimes the interest is equal to the capital. The accumulation of paper\r\nmoney in England is in proportion to the accumulation of the interest\r\nupon every new loan; and therefore the progress to the dissolution is\r\ntwenty times slower than if the capital were to be emitted and put into\r\ncirculation immediately. Every twenty years in the English system is\r\nequal to one year in the French and American systems.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the duration of the two systems, that of funding upon\r\ninterest, and that of emitting the whole capital without funding, to be\r\nas twenty to one, I come to examine the symptoms of decay, approaching\r\nto dissolution, that the English system has already exhibited, and to\r\ncompare them with similar systems in the French and American systems.\r\n\r\nThe English funding system began one hundred years ago; in which time\r\nthere have been six wars, including the war that ended in 1697.\r\n\r\n1. The war that ended, as I have just said, in 1697.\r\n\r\n2. The war that began in 1702.\r\n\r\n3. The war that began in 1739.\r\n\r\n4. The war that began in 1756.\r\n\r\n5. The American war, that began in 1775.\r\n\r\n6. The present war, that began in 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe national debt, at the conclusion of the war which ended in 1697, was\r\ntwenty-one millions and an half. (See Smith's Wealth of Nations,\r\nchapter on Public Debts.) We now see it approaching fast to four hundred\r\nmillions. If between these two extremes of twenty-one millions and four\r\nhundred millions, embracing the several expenses of all the including\r\nwars, there exist some common ratio that will ascertain arithmetically\r\nthe amount of the debts at the end of each war, as certainly as the fact\r\nis known to be, that ratio will in like manner determine what the amount\r\nof the debt will be in all future wars, and will ascertain the period\r\nwithin which the funding system will expire in a bankruptcy of the\r\ngovernment; for the ratio I allude to, is the ratio which the nature of\r\nthe thing has established for itself.\r\n\r\nHitherto no idea has been entertained that any such ratio existed, or\r\ncould exist, that would determine a problem of this kind; that is, that\r\nwould ascertain, without having any knowledge of the fact, what the\r\nexpense of any former war had been, or what the expense of any future\r\nwar would be; but it is nevertheless true that such a ratio does exist,\r\nas I shall show, and also the mode of applying it.\r\n\r\nThe ratio I allude to is not in arithmetical progression like the\r\nnumbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; nor yet in geometrical progression, like\r\nthe numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256; but it is in the series of\r\none half upon each preceding number; like the numbers 8, 12, 18, 27, 40,\r\n60, 90, 135.\r\n\r\nAny person can perceive that the second number, 12, is produced by the\r\npreceding number, 8, and half 8; and that the third number, 18, is in\r\nlike manner produced by the preceding number, 12, and half 12; and so\r\non for the rest. They can also see how rapidly the sums increase as\r\nthe ratio proceeds. The difference between the two first numbers is but\r\nfour; but the difference between the two last is forty-five; and from\r\nthence they may see with what immense rapidity the national debt has\r\nincreased, and will continue to increase, till it exceeds the ordinary\r\npowers of calculation, and loses itself in ciphers.\r\n\r\nI come now to apply the ratio as a rule to determine in all cases.\r\n\r\nI began with the war that ended in 1697, which was the war in which the\r\nfunding system began. The expense of that war was twenty-one millions\r\nand an half. In order to ascertain the expense of the next war, I add\r\nto twenty-one millions and an half, the half thereof (ten millions and\r\nthree quarters) which makes thirty-two millions and a quarter for the\r\nexpense of that war. This thirty-two millions and a quarter, added to\r\nthe former debt of twenty-one millions and an half, carries the national\r\ndebt to fifty-three millions and three quarters. Smith, in his\r\nchapter on Public Debts, says, that the national debt was at this time\r\nfifty-three millions.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of the next war, that of 1739, by\r\nadding, as in the former case, one half to the expense of the preceding\r\nwar. The expense of the preceding war was thirty-two millions and a\r\nquarter; for the sake of even numbers, say, thirty-two millions; the\r\nhalf of which (16) makes forty-eight millions for the expense of that\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of the war of 1756, by adding,\r\naccording to the ratio, one half to the expense of the preceding war.\r\nThe expense of the preceding was taken at 48 millions, the half of which\r\n(24) makes 72 millions for the expense of that war. Smith, (chapter on\r\nPublic Debts,) says, the expense of the war of 1756, was 72 millions and\r\na quarter.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of the American war, of 1775, by\r\nadding, as in the former cases, one half to the expense of the preceding\r\nwar. The expense of the preceding war was 72 millions, the half of which\r\n(36) makes 108 millions for the expense of that war. In the last\r\nedition of Smith, (chapter on Public Debts,) he says, the expense of the\r\nAmerican war was _more than an hundred millions_.\r\n\r\nI come now to ascertain the expense of the present war, supposing it to\r\ncontinue as long as former wars have done, and the funding system not\r\nto break up before that period. The expense of the preceding war was 108\r\nmillions, the half of which (54) makes 162 millions for the expense of\r\nthe present war. It gives symptoms of going beyond this sum, supposing\r\nthe funding system not to break up; for the loans of the last year and\r\nof the present year are twenty-two millions each, which exceeds the\r\nratio compared with the loans of the preceding war. It will not be from\r\nthe inability of procuring loans that the system will break up. On\r\nthe contrary, it is the facility with which loans can be procured that\r\nhastens that event. The loans are altogether paper transactions; and\r\nit is the excess of them that brings on, with accelerating speed, that\r\nprogressive depreciation of funded paper money that will dissolve the\r\nfunding system.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of future wars, and I do this merely\r\nto show the impossibility of the continuance of the funding system, and\r\nthe certainty of its dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the next war after the present war, according to the\r\nratio that has ascertained the preceding cases, will be 243 millions.\r\n\r\nExpense of the second war 364\r\n\r\n---------------- third war 546\r\n\r\n---------------- fourth war 819\r\n\r\n-------- fifth war 1228\r\n\r\n                                                        3200 millions;\r\n\r\nwhich, at only four per cent. will require taxes to the nominal amount\r\nof one hundred and twenty-eight millions to pay the annual interest,\r\nbesides the interest of the present debt, and the expenses of\r\ngovernment, which are not included in this account. Is there a man so\r\nmad, so stupid, as to sup-pose this system can continue?\r\n\r\nWhen I first conceived the idea of seeking for some common ratio that\r\nshould apply as a rule of measurement to all the cases of the funding\r\nsystem, so far as to ascertain the several stages of its approach to\r\ndissolution, I had no expectation that any ratio could be found that\r\nwould apply with so much exactness as this does. I was led to the idea\r\nmerely by observing that the funding system was a thing in continual\r\nprogression, and that whatever was in a state of progression might be\r\nsupposed to admit of, at least, some general ratio of measurement,\r\nthat would apply without any very great variation. But who could have\r\nsupposed that falling systems, or falling opinions, admitted of a ratio\r\napparently as true as the descent of falling bodies? I have not made the\r\nratio any more than Newton made the ratio of gravitation. I have only\r\ndiscovered it, and explained the mode of applying it.\r\n\r\nTo shew at one view the rapid progression of the funding system to\r\ndestruction, and to expose the folly of those who blindly believe in\r\nits continuance, and who artfully endeavour to impose that belief upon\r\nothers, I exhibit in the annexed table, the expense of each of the six\r\nwars since the funding system began, as ascertained by ratio, and the\r\nexpense of the six wars yet to come, ascertained by the same ratio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table318]\r\n\r\n     * The actual expense of the war of 1739 did not come up to\r\n     the sum ascertained by the ratio.   But as that which is the\r\n     natural disposition of a thing, as it is the natural\r\n     disposition of a stream of water to descend, will, if\r\n     impeded in its course, overcome by a new effort what it had\r\n     lost by that impediment, so it was with respect to this war\r\n     and the next (1756) taken collectively; for the expense of\r\n     the war of 1756 restored the equilibrium of the ratio, as\r\n     fully as if it had not been impeded. A circumstance that\r\n     serves to prove the truth of the ratio more folly than if\r\n     the interruption had not taken place. The war of 1739 ***\r\n     languid; the efforts were below the value of money et that\r\n     time; for the ratio is the measure of the depreciation of\r\n     money in consequence of the funding system; or what comes\r\n     to the same end, it is the measure of the increase of paper.\r\n     Every additional quantity of it, whether in bank notes or\r\n     otherwise, diminishes the real, though not the nominal value\r\n     of the former quantity.--_Author_\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who are acquainted with the power with which even a small ratio,\r\nacting in progression, multiplies in a long series, will see nothing to\r\nwonder at in this table. Those who are not acquainted with that subject,\r\nand not knowing what else to say, may be inclined to deny it. But it is\r\nnot their opinion one way, nor mine the other, that can influence the\r\nevent. The table exhibits the natural march of the funding system to its\r\nirredeemable dissolution. Supposing the present government of England to\r\ncontinue, and to go on as it has gone on since the funding system began,\r\nI would not give twenty shillings for one hundred pounds in the funds to\r\nbe paid twenty years hence. I do not speak this predictively; I produce\r\nthe data upon which that belief is founded; and which data it is every\r\nbody's interest to know, who have any thing to do with the funds, or\r\nwho are going to bequeath property to their descendants to be paid at a\r\nfuture day.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be asked, that as governments or ministers proceeded by\r\nno ratio in making loans or incurring debts, and nobody intended any\r\nratio, or thought of any, how does it happen that there is one? I\r\nanswer, that the ratio is founded in necessity; and I now go to explain\r\nwhat that necessity is.\r\n\r\nIt will always happen, that the price of labour, or of the produce\r\nof labour, be that produce what it may, will be in proportion to the\r\nquantity of money in a country, admitting things to take their natural\r\ncourse. Before the invention of the funding system, there was no other\r\nmoney than gold and silver; and as nature gives out those metals with\r\na sparing hand, and in regular annual quantities from the mines, the\r\nseveral prices of things were proportioned to the quantity of money at\r\nthat time, and so nearly stationary as to vary but little in any fifty\r\nor sixty years of that period.\r\n\r\nWhen the funding system began, a substitute for gold and silver began\r\nalso. That substitute was paper; and the quantity increased as the\r\nquantity of interest increased upon accumulated loans. This appearance\r\nof a new and additional species of money in the nation soon began to\r\nbreak the relative value which money and the things it will purchase\r\nbore to each other before. Every thing rose in price; but the rise at\r\nfirst was little and slow, like the difference in units between two\r\nfirst numbers, 8 and 12, compared with the two last numbers 90 and 135,\r\nin the table. It was however sufficient to make itself considerably felt\r\nin a large transaction. When therefore government, by engaging in a new\r\nwar, required a new loan, it was obliged to make a higher loan than the\r\nformer loan, to balance the increased price to which things had risen;\r\nand as that new loan increased the quantity of paper in proportion\r\nto the new quantity of interest, it carried the price of things still\r\nhigher than before. The next loan was again higher, to balance that\r\nfurther increased price; and all this in the same manner, though not\r\nin the same degree, that every new emission of continental money in\r\nAmerica, or of assignats in France, was greater than the preceding\r\nemission, to make head against the advance of prices, till the combat\r\ncould be maintained no longer. Herein is founded the necessity of which\r\nI have just spoken. That necessity proceeds with accelerating velocity,\r\nand the ratio I have laid down is the measure of that acceleration; or,\r\nto speak the technical language of the subject, it is the measure of the\r\nincreasing depreciation of funded paper money, which it is impossible to\r\nprevent while the quantity of that money and of bank notes continues to\r\nmultiply. What else but this can account for the difference between one\r\nwar costing 21 millions, and another war costing 160 millions?\r\n\r\nThe difference cannot be accounted for on the score of extraordinary\r\nefforts or extraordinary achievements. The war that cost twenty-one\r\nmillions was the war of the con-federates, historically called the grand\r\nalliance, consisting of England, Austria, and Holland in the time of\r\nWilliam III. against Louis XIV. and in which the confederates were\r\nvictorious. The present is a war of a much greater confederacy--a\r\nconfederacy of England, Austria, Prussia, the German Empire, Spain,\r\nHolland, Naples, and Sardinia, eight powers, against the French Republic\r\nsingly, and the Republic has beaten the whole confederacy.--But to\r\nreturn to my subject.\r\n\r\nIt is said in England, that the value of paper keeps equal with the\r\nvalue of gold and silver. But the case is not rightly stated; for the\r\nfact is, that the paper has _pulled down_ the value of gold and silver\r\nto a level with itself. Gold and silver will not purchase so much of any\r\npurchasable article at this day as if no paper had appeared, nor so much\r\nas it will in any country in Europe where there is no paper. How long\r\nthis hanging together of money and paper will continue, makes a new\r\ncase; because it daily exposes the system to sudden death, independent\r\nof the natural death it would otherwise suffer.\r\n\r\nI consider the funding system as being now advanced into the last twenty\r\nyears of its existence. The single circumstance, were there no other,\r\nthat a war should now cost nominally one hundred and sixty millions,\r\nwhich when the system began cost but twenty-one millions, or that the\r\nloan for one year only (including the loan to the Emperor) should now be\r\nnominally greater than the whole expense of that war, shows the state of\r\ndepreciation to which the funding system has arrived. Its depreciation\r\nis in the proportion of eight for one, compared with the value of its\r\nmoney when the system began; which is the state the French assignats\r\nstood a year ago (March 1795) compared with gold and silver. It is\r\ntherefore that I say, that the English funding system has entered on the\r\nlast twenty years of its existence, comparing each twenty years of\r\nthe English system with every single year of the American and French\r\nsystems, as before stated.\r\n\r\nAgain, supposing the present war to close as former wars have done, and\r\nwithout producing either revolution or reform in England, another war at\r\nleast must be looked for in the space of the twenty years I allude to;\r\nfor it has never yet happened that twenty years have passed off without\r\na war, and that more especially since the English government has dabbled\r\nin German politics, and shown a disposition to insult the world, and the\r\nworld of commerce, with her navy. The next war will carry the national\r\ndebt to very nearly seven hundred millions, the interest of which, at\r\nfour per cent, will be twenty-eight millions besides the taxes for\r\nthe (then) expenses of government, which will increase in the same\r\nproportion, and which will carry the taxes to at least forty millions;\r\nand if another war only begins, it will quickly carry them to above\r\nfifty; for it is in the last twenty years of the funding system, as in\r\nthe last year of the American and French systems without funding, that\r\nall the great shocks begin to operate.\r\n\r\nI have just mentioned that, paper in England has _pulled down_ the value\r\nof gold and silver to a level with itself; and that _this pulling dawn_\r\nof gold and silver money has created the appearance of paper money\r\nkeeping up. The same thing, and the same mistake, took place in\r\nAmerica and in France, and continued for a considerable time after the\r\ncommencement of their system of paper; and the actual depreciation of\r\nmoney was hidden under that mistake.\r\n\r\nIt was said in America, at that time, that everything was becoming\r\n_dear_; but gold and silver could then buy those dear articles no\r\ncheaper than paper could; and therefore it was not called depreciation.\r\nThe idea of _dearness_ established itself for the idea of depreciation.\r\nThe same was the case in France. Though every thing rose in price soon\r\nafter assignats appeared, yet those dear articles could be purchased no\r\ncheaper with gold and silver, than with paper, and it was only said that\r\nthings were _dear_. The same is still the language in England. They\r\ncall it _deariness_. But they will soon find that it is an actual\r\ndepreciation, and that this depreciation is the effect of the funding\r\nsystem; which, by crowding such a continually increasing mass of paper\r\ninto circulation, carries down the value of gold and silver with it. But\r\ngold and silver, will, in the long run, revolt against depreciation, and\r\nseparate from the value of paper; for the progress of all such systems\r\nappears to be, that the paper will take the command in the beginning,\r\nand gold and silver in the end.\r\n\r\nBut this succession in the command of gold and silver over paper, makes\r\na crisis far more eventful to the funding system than to any other\r\nsystem upon which paper can be issued; for, strictly speaking, it is not\r\na crisis of danger but a symptom of death. It is a death-stroke to the\r\nfunding system. It is a revolution in the whole of its affairs.\r\n\r\nIf paper be issued without being funded upon interest, emissions of it\r\ncan be continued after the value of it separates from gold and silver,\r\nas we have seen in the two cases of America and France. But the funding\r\nsystem rests altogether upon the value of paper being equal to gold and\r\nsilver; which will be as long as the paper can continue carrying down\r\nthe value of gold and silver to the same level to which itself descends,\r\nand no longer. But even in this state, that of descending equally\r\ntogether, the minister, whoever he may be, will find himself beset with\r\naccumulating difficulties; because the loans and taxes voted for the\r\nservice of each ensuing year will wither in his hands before the year\r\nexpires, or before they can be applied. This will force him to have\r\nrecourse to emissions of what are called exchequer and navy bills,\r\nwhich, by still increasing the mass of paper in circulation, will drive\r\non the depreciation still more rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be known that taxes in England are not paid in gold\r\nand silver, but in paper (bank notes). Every person who pays any\r\nconsiderable quantity of taxes, such as maltsters, brewers, distillers,\r\n(I appeal for the truth of it, to any of the collectors of excise in\r\nEngland, or to Mr. White-bread,)(1) knows this to be the case. There is\r\nnot gold and silver enough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin, as\r\nI shall show; and consequently there is not money enough in the bank to\r\npay the notes. The interest of the national funded debt is paid at the\r\nbank in the same kind of paper in which the taxes are collected. When\r\npeople find, as they will find, a reservedness among each other in\r\ngiving gold and silver for bank notes, or the least preference for the\r\nformer over the latter, they will go for payment to the bank, where they\r\nhave a right to go. They will do this as a measure of prudence, each one\r\nfor himself, and the truth or delusion of the funding system will then\r\nbe proved.\r\n\r\n     1 An eminent Member of Parliament.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nI have said in the foregoing paragraph that there is not gold and silver\r\nenough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin, and consequently that\r\nthere cannot be enough in the bank to pay the notes. As I do not choose\r\nto rest anything upon assertion, I appeal for the truth of this to the\r\npublications of Mr. Eden (now called Lord Auckland) and George Chalmers,\r\nSecretary to the Board of Trade and Plantation, of which Jenkinson (now\r\nLord Hawkesbury) is president.(1) (These sort of folks change their\r\nnames so often that it is as difficult to know them as it is to know\r\na thief.) Chalmers gives the quantity of gold and silver coin from the\r\nreturns of coinage at the Mint; and after deducting for the light gold\r\nrecoined, says that the amount of gold and silver coined is about twenty\r\nmillions. He had better not have proved this, especially if he had\r\nreflected that _public credit is suspicion asleep_. The quantity is much\r\ntoo little.\r\n\r\n     1 Concerning Chalmers and Hawkesbury see vol. ii., p. 533.\r\n     Also, preface to my \"Life of Paine\",  xvi., and other\r\n     passages.---_Editor._.\r\n\r\nOf this twenty millions (which is not a fourth part of the quantity of\r\ngold and silver there is in France, as is shown in Mr. Neckar's Treatise\r\non the Administration of the Finances) three millions at least must be\r\nsupposed to be in Ireland, some in Scotland, and in the West Indies,\r\nNewfoundland, &c. The quantity therefore in England cannot be more than\r\nsixteen millions, which is four millions less than the amount of the\r\ntaxes. But admitting that there are sixteen millions, not more than\r\na fourth part thereof (four millions) can be in London, when it is\r\nconsidered that every city, town, village, and farm-house in the nation\r\nmust have a part of it, and that all the great manufactories, which most\r\nrequire cash, are out of London. Of this four millions in London, every\r\nbanker, merchant, tradesman, in short every individual, must have some.\r\nHe must be a poor shopkeeper indeed, who has not a few guineas in his\r\ntill. The quantity of cash therefore in the bank can never, on the\r\nevidence of circumstances, be so much as two millions; most probably\r\nnot more than one million; and on this slender twig, always liable to be\r\nbroken, hangs the whole funding system of four hundred millions, besides\r\nmany millions in bank notes. The sum in the bank is not sufficient to\r\npay one-fourth of only one year's interest of the national debt, were\r\nthe creditors to demand payment in cash, or demand cash for the bank\r\nnotes in which the interest is paid, a circumstance always liable to\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nOne of the amusements that has kept up the farce of the funding system\r\nis, that the interest is regularly paid. But as the interest is always\r\npaid in bank notes, and as bank notes can always be coined for the\r\npurpose, this mode of payment proves nothing. The point of proof is, can\r\nthe bank give cash for the bank notes with which the interest is paid?\r\nIf it cannot, and it is evident it cannot, some millions of bank notes\r\nmust go without payment, and those holders of bank notes who apply last\r\nwill be worst off. When the present quantity of cash in the bank is paid\r\naway, it is next to impossible to see how any new quantity is to arrive.\r\nNone will arrive from taxes, for the taxes will all be paid in bank\r\nnotes; and should the government refuse bank notes in payment of taxes,\r\nthe credit of bank notes will be gone at once. No cash will arise from\r\nthe business of discounting merchants' bills; for every merchant will\r\npay off those bills in bank notes, and not in cash. There is therefore\r\nno means left for the bank to obtain a new supply of cash, after the\r\npresent quantity is paid away. But besides the impossibility of paying\r\nthe interest of the funded debt in cash, there are many thousand\r\npersons, in London and in the country, who are holders of bank notes\r\nthat came into their hands in the fair way of trade, and who are not\r\nstockholders in the funds; and as such persons have had no hand in\r\nincreasing the demand upon the bank, as those have had who for their own\r\nprivate interest, like Boyd and others, are contracting or pretending to\r\ncontract for new loans, they will conceive they have a just right that\r\ntheir bank notes should be paid first. Boyd has been very sly in France,\r\nin changing his paper into cash. He will be just as sly in doing the\r\nsame thing in London, for he has learned to calculate; and then it is\r\nprobable he will set off for America.\r\n\r\nA stoppage of payment at the bank is not a new thing. Smith in his\r\nWealth of Nations, book ii. chap. 2, says, that in the year 1696,\r\nexchequer bills fell forty, fifty, and sixty per cent; bank notes twenty\r\nper cent; and the bank stopped payment. That which happened in 1696 may\r\nhappen again in 1796. The period in which it happened was the last year\r\nof the war of King William. It necessarily put a stop to the further\r\nemissions of exchequer and navy bills, and to the raising of new loans;\r\nand the peace which took place the next year was probably hurried on by\r\nthis circumstance, and saved the bank from bankruptcy. Smith in speaking\r\nfrom the circumstances of the bank, upon another occasion, says (book\r\nii. chap. 2.) \"This great company had been reduced to the necessity\r\nof paying in sixpences.\" When a bank adopts the expedient of paying in\r\nsixpences, it is a confession of insolvency.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation, that every case of failure in finances,\r\nsince the system of paper began, has produced a revolution in\r\ngovernments, either total or partial. A failure in the finances of\r\nFrance produced the French revolution. A failure in the finance of\r\nthe assignats broke up the revolutionary government, and produced\r\nthe present French Constitution. A failure in the finances of the Old\r\nCongress of America, and the embarrassments it brought upon commerce,\r\nbroke up the system of the old confederation, and produced the federal\r\nConstitution. If, then, we admit of reasoning by comparison of causes\r\nand events, the failure of the English finances will produce some change\r\nin the government of that country.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Pitt's project of paying off the national debt by applying\r\na million a-year for that purpose, while he continues adding more than\r\ntwenty millions a-year to it, it is like setting a man with a wooden leg\r\nto run after a hare. The longer he runs the farther he is off.\r\n\r\nWhen I said that the funding system had entered the last twenty years\r\nof its existence, I certainly did not mean that it would continue twenty\r\nyears, and then expire as a lease would do. I meant to describe that\r\nage of decrepitude in which death is every day to be expected, and life\r\ncannot continue long. But the death of credit, or that state that is\r\ncalled bankruptcy, is not always marked by those progressive stages\r\nof visible decline that marked the decline of natural life. In the\r\nprogression of natural life age cannot counterfeit youth, nor conceal\r\nthe departure of juvenile abilities. But it is otherwise with respect\r\nto the death of credit; for though all the approaches to bankruptcy\r\nmay actually exist in circumstances, they admit of being concealed by\r\nappearances. Nothing is more common than to see the bankrupt of to-day a\r\nman in credit but the day before; yet no sooner is the real state of\r\nhis affairs known, than every body can see he had been insolvent long\r\nbefore. In London, the greatest theatre of bankruptcy in Europe, this\r\npart of the subject will be well and feelingly understood.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt continually talks of credit, and the national resources. These\r\nare two of the feigned appearances by which the approaches to bankruptcy\r\nare concealed. That which he calls credit may exist, as I have just\r\nshown, in a state of insolvency, and is always what I have before\r\ndescribed it to be, _suspicion asleep_.\r\n\r\nAs to national resources, Mr. Pitt, like all English financiers that\r\npreceded him since the funding system began, has uniformly mistaken the\r\nnature of a resource; that is, they have mistaken it consistently with\r\nthe delusion of the funding system; but time is explaining the delusion.\r\nThat which he calls, and which they call, a resource, is not a resource,\r\nbut is the _anticipation_ of a resource. They have anticipated what\r\n_would have been_ a resource in another generation, had not the use of\r\nit been so anticipated. The funding system is a system of anticipation.\r\nThose who established it an hundred years ago anticipated the resources\r\nof those who were to live an hundred years after; for the people of the\r\npresent day have to pay the interest of the debts contracted at that\r\ntime, and all debts contracted since. But it is the last feather that\r\nbreaks the horse's back. Had the system begun an hundred years before,\r\nthe amount of taxes at this time to pay the annual interest at four per\r\ncent. (could we suppose such a system of insanity could have continued)\r\nwould be two hundred and twenty millions annually: for the capital of\r\nthe debt would be 5486 millions, according to the ratio that ascertains\r\nthe expense of the wars for the hundred years that are past. But long\r\nbefore it could have reached this period, the value of bank notes,\r\nfrom the immense quantity of them, (for it is in paper only that such\r\na nominal revenue could be collected,) would have been as low or lower\r\nthan continental paper has been in America, or assignats in France; and\r\nas to the idea of exchanging them for gold and silver, it is too absurd\r\nto be contradicted.\r\n\r\nDo we not see that nature, in all her operations, disowns the visionary\r\nbasis upon which the funding system is built? She acts always by\r\nrenewed successions, and never by accumulating additions perpetually\r\nprogressing. Animals and vegetables, men and trees, have existed since\r\nthe world began: but that existence has been carried on by succession\r\nof generations, and not by continuing the same men and the same trees in\r\nexistence that existed first; and to make room for the new she removes\r\nthe old. Every natural idiot can see this; it is the stock-jobbing idiot\r\nonly that mistakes. He has conceived that art can do what nature cannot.\r\nHe is teaching her a new system--that there is no occasion for man to\r\ndie--that the scheme of creation can be carried on upon the plan of\r\nthe funding system--that it can proceed by continual additions of new\r\nbeings, like new loans, and all live together in eternal youth. Go,\r\ncount the graves, thou idiot, and learn the folly of thy arithmetic!\r\n\r\nBut besides these things, there is something visibly farcical in the\r\nwhole operation of loaning. It is scarcely more than four years ago\r\nthat such a rot of bankruptcy spread itself over London, that the whole\r\ncommercial fabric tottered; trade and credit were at a stand; and\r\nsuch was the state of things that, to prevent or suspend a general\r\nbankruptcy, the government lent the merchants six millions in\r\n_government_ paper, and now the merchants lend the government twenty-two\r\nmillions in _their_ paper; and two parties, Boyd and Morgan, men but\r\nlittle known, contend who shall be the lenders. What a farce is this!\r\nIt reduces the operation of loaning to accommodation paper, in which\r\nthe competitors contend, not who shall lend, but who shall sign, because\r\nthere is something to be got for signing.\r\n\r\nEvery English stock-jobber and minister boasts of the credit of England.\r\nIts credit, say they, is greater than that of any country in Europe.\r\nThere is a good reason for this: for there is not another country in\r\nEurope that could be made the dupe of such a delusion. The English\r\nfunding system will remain a monument of wonder, not so much on account\r\nof the extent to which it has been carried, as of the folly of believing\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nThose who had formerly predicted that the funding system would break\r\nup when the debt should amount to one hundred or one hundred and fifty\r\nmillions, erred only in not distinguishing between insolvency and actual\r\nbankruptcy; for the insolvency commenced as soon as the government\r\nbecame unable to pay the interest in cash, or to give cash for the bank\r\nnotes in which the interest was paid, whether that inability was known\r\nor not, or whether it was suspected or not. Insolvency always takes\r\nplace before bankruptcy; for bankruptcy is nothing more than the\r\npublication of that insolvency. In the affairs of an individual, it\r\noften happens that insolvency exists several years before bankruptcy,\r\nand that the insolvency is concealed and carried on till the individual\r\nis not able to pay one shilling in the pound. A government can ward off\r\nbankruptcy longer than an individual: but insolvency will inevitably\r\nproduce bankruptcy, whether in an individual or in a government. If then\r\nthe quantity of bank notes payable on demand, which the bank has issued,\r\nare greater than the bank can pay off, the bank is insolvent: and when\r\nthat insolvency is declared, it is bankruptcy.(*)\r\n\r\n     *  Among the delusions that have been imposed upon the\r\n     nation by ministers to give a false colouring to its\r\n     affairs, and by none more than by Mr. Pitt, is a motley,\r\n     amphibious-charactered thing called the _balance of trade_.\r\n     This balance of trade, as it is called, is taken from the\r\n     custom-house books, in which entries are made of all cargoes\r\n     exported, and also of all cargoes imported, in each year;\r\n     and when the value of the exports, according to the price\r\n     set upon them by the exporter or by the custom-house, is\r\n     greater than the value of the imports, estimated in the same\r\n     manner, they say the balance of trade is much in their\r\n     favour.\r\n\r\n     The custom-house books prove regularly enough that so many\r\n     cargoes have been exported, and so many imported; but this\r\n     is all that they prove, or were intended to prove. They have\r\n     nothing to do with the balance of profit or loss; and it is\r\n     ignorance to appeal to them upon that account: for the case\r\n     is, that the greater the loss is in any one year, the higher\r\n     will this thing called the balance of trade appear to be\r\n     according to the custom-house books. For example, nearly the\r\n     whole of the Mediterranean convoy has been taken by the\r\n     French this year; consequently those cargoes will not\r\n     appear as imports on the custom-house books, and therefore\r\n     the balance of trade, by which they mean the profits of it,\r\n     will appear to be so much the greater as the loss amounts to;\r\n     and, on the other hand, had the loss not happened, the\r\n     profits would have appeared to have been so much the less.\r\n     All the losses happening at sea to returning cargoes, by\r\n     accidents, by the elements, or by capture, make the balance\r\n     appear the higher on the side of the exports; and were they\r\n     all lost at sea, it would appear to be all profit on the\r\n     custom-house books. Also every cargo of exports that is lost\r\n     that occasions another to be sent, adds in like manner to\r\n     the side of the exports, and appears as profit. This year\r\n     the balance of trade will appear high, because the losses\r\n     have been great by capture and by storms. The ignorance of\r\n     the British Parliament in listening to this hackneyed\r\n     imposition of ministers about the balance of trade is\r\n     astonishing. It shows how little they know of national\r\n     affairs--and Mr. Grey may as well talk Greek to them, as to\r\n     make motions about the state of the nation. They understand\r\n     only fox-hunting and the game laws,--_Author_.\r\n\r\nI come now to show the several ways by which bank notes get into\r\ncirculation: I shall afterwards offer an estimate on the total quantity\r\nor amount of bank notes existing at this moment.\r\n\r\nThe bank acts in three capacities. As a bank of discount; as a bank of\r\ndeposit; and as a banker for the government.\r\n\r\nFirst, as a bank of discount. The bank discounts merchants' bills of\r\nexchange for two months. When a merchant has a bill that will become due\r\nat the end of two months, and wants payment before that time, the bank\r\nadvances that payment to him, deducting therefrom at the rate of five\r\nper cent, per annum. The bill of exchange remains at the bank as a\r\npledge or pawn, and at the end of two months it must be redeemed. This\r\ntransaction is done altogether in paper; for the profits of the bank,\r\nas a bank of discount, arise entirely from its making use of paper as\r\nmoney. The bank gives bank notes to the merchant in discounting the bill\r\nof exchange, and the redeemer of the bill pays bank notes to the bank in\r\nredeeming it. It very seldom happens that any real money passes between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf the profits of a bank be, for example, two hundred thousand pounds a\r\nyear (a great sum to be made merely by exchanging one sort of paper\r\nfor another, and which shows also that the merchants of that place are\r\npressed for money for payments, instead of having money to spare to lend\r\nto government,) it proves that the bank discounts to the amount of four\r\nmillions annually, or 666,666L. every two months; and as there never\r\nremain in the bank more than two months' pledges, of the value of\r\n666,666L., at any one time, the amount of bank notes in circulation at\r\nany one time should not be more than to that amount. This is sufficient\r\nto show that the present immense quantity of bank notes, which are\r\ndistributed through every city, town, village, and farm-house in\r\nEngland, cannot be accounted for on the score of discounting.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as a bank of deposit. To deposit money at the bank means to\r\nlodge it there for the sake of convenience, and to be drawn out at any\r\nmoment the depositor pleases, or to be paid away to his order. When\r\nthe business of discounting is great, that of depositing is necessarily\r\nsmall. No man deposits and applies for discounts at the same time;\r\nfor it would be like paying interest for lending money, instead of for\r\nborrowing it. The deposits that are now made at the bank are almost\r\nentirely in bank notes, and consequently they add nothing to the ability\r\nof the bank to pay off the bank notes that may be presented for payment;\r\nand besides this, the deposits are no more the property of the bank than\r\nthe cash or bank notes in a merchant's counting-house are the property\r\nof his book-keeper. No great increase therefore of bank notes, beyond\r\nwhat the discounting business admits, can be accounted for on the score\r\nof deposits.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the bank acts as banker for the government. This is the\r\nconnection that threatens to ruin every public bank. It is through this\r\nconnection that the credit of a bank is forced far beyond what it ought\r\nto be, and still further beyond its ability to pay. It is through this\r\nconnection, that such an immense redundant quantity of bank notes, have\r\ngotten into circulation; and which, instead of being issued because\r\nthere was property in the bank, have been issued because there was none.\r\n\r\nWhen the treasury is empty, which happens in almost every year of every\r\nwar, its coffers at the bank are empty also. It is in this condition of\r\nemptiness that the minister has recourse to emissions of what are called\r\nexchequer and navy bills, which continually generates a new increase of\r\nbank notes, and which are sported upon the public, without there being\r\nproperty in the bank to pay them. These exchequer and navy bills (being,\r\nas I have said, emitted because the treasury and its coffers at the bank\r\nare empty, and cannot pay the demands that come in) are no other than\r\nan acknowledgment that the bearer is entitled to receive so much money.\r\nThey may be compared to the settlement of an account, in which the\r\ndebtor acknowledges the balance he owes, and for which he gives a note\r\nof hand; or to a note of hand given to raise money upon it.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bank discounts those bills as it would discount merchants'\r\nbills of exchange; sometimes it purchases them of the holders at the\r\ncurrent price; and sometimes it agrees with the ministers to pay an\r\ninterest upon them to the holders, and keep them in circulation. In\r\nevery one of these cases an additional quantity of bank notes gets into\r\ncirculation, and are sported, as I have said, upon the public, without\r\nthere being property in the bank, as banker for the government, to pay\r\nthem; and besides this, the bank has now no money of its own; for the\r\nmoney that was originally subscribed to begin the credit of the bank\r\nwith, at its first establishment, has been lent to government and wasted\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\n\"The bank\" (says Smith, book ii. chap. 2.) \"acts not only as an ordinary\r\nbank, but as a great engine of State; it receives and pays a greater\r\npart of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the _public_.\"\r\n(It is worth observing, that the _public_, or the _nation_, is always\r\nput for the government, in speaking of debts.) \"It circulates\" (says\r\nSmith) \"exchequer bills, and it advances to government the annual amount\r\nof the land and malt taxes, which are frequently not paid till several\r\nyears afterwards.\" (This advancement is also done in bank notes,\r\nfor which there is not property in the bank.) \"In those different\r\noperations\" (says Smith) \"_its duty to the public_ may sometimes have\r\nobliged it, without any fault of its directors, _to overstock the\r\ncirculation with paper money_.\"--bank notes. How its _duty_ to _the\r\npublic_ can induce it _to overstock that public_ with promissory bank\r\nnotes which it _cannot pay_, and thereby expose the individuals of that\r\npublic to ruin, is too paradoxical to be explained; for it is on\r\nthe credit which individuals _give to the bank_, by receiving and\r\ncirculating its notes, and not upon its _own_ credit or its _own_\r\nproperty, for it has none, that the bank sports. If, however, it be the\r\nduty of the bank to expose the public to this hazard, it is at least\r\nequally the duty of the individuals of that public to get their money\r\nand take care of themselves; and leave it to placemen, pensioners,\r\ngovernment contractors, Reeves' association, and the members of both\r\nhouses of Parliament, who have voted away the money at the nod of\r\nthe minister, to continue the credit if they can, and for which their\r\nestates individually and collectively ought to answer, as far as they\r\nwill go.\r\n\r\nThere has always existed, and still exists, a mysterious, suspicious\r\nconnection, between the minister and the directors of the bank, and\r\nwhich explains itself no otherways than by a continual increase in bank\r\nnotes. Without, therefore, entering into any further details of the\r\nvarious contrivances by which bank notes are issued, and thrown upon the\r\npublic, I proceed, as I before mentioned, to offer an estimate on the\r\ntotal quantity of bank notes in circulation.\r\n\r\nHowever disposed governments may be to wring money by taxes from the\r\npeople, there is a limit to the practice established by the nature of\r\nthings. That limit is the proportion between the quantity of money in a\r\nnation, be that quantity what it may, and the greatest quantity of taxes\r\nthat can be raised upon it. People have other uses for money besides\r\npaying taxes; and it is only a proportional part of the money they can\r\nspare for taxes, as it is only a proportional part they can spare\r\nfor house-rent, for clothing, or for any other particular use. These\r\nproportions find out and establish themselves; and that with such\r\nexactness, that if any one part exceeds its proportion, all the other\r\nparts feel it.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of paper money (bank notes,) there was no other\r\nmoney in the nation than gold and silver, and the greatest quantity of\r\nmoney that was ever raised in taxes during that period never exceeded a\r\nfourth part of the quantity of money in the nation. It was high taxing\r\nwhen it came to this point. The taxes in the time of William III. never\r\nreached to four millions before the invention of paper, and the quantity\r\nof money in the nation at that time was estimated to be about sixteen\r\nmillions. The same proportions established themselves in France. There\r\nwas no paper money in France before the present revolution, and the\r\ntaxes were collected in gold and silver money. The highest quantity of\r\ntaxes never exceeded twenty-two millions sterling; and the quantity of\r\ngold and silver money in the nation at the same time, as stated by M.\r\nNeckar, from returns of coinage at the Mint, in his Treatise on the\r\nAdministration of the Finances, was about ninety millions sterling. To\r\ngo beyond this limit of a fourth part, in England, they were obliged to\r\nintroduce paper money; and the attempt to go beyond it in France, where\r\npaper could not be introduced, broke up the government. This proportion,\r\ntherefore, of a fourth part, is the limit which the thing establishes\r\nfor itself, be the quantity of money in a nation more or less.\r\n\r\nThe amount of taxes in England at this time is full twenty millions;\r\nand therefore the quantity of gold and silver, and of bank notes, taken\r\ntogether, amounts to eighty millions. The quantity of gold and silver,\r\nas stated by Lord Hawkes-bury's Secretary, George Chalmers, as I have\r\nbefore shown, is twenty millions; and, therefore, the total amount\r\nof bank notes in circulation, all made payable on demand, is sixty\r\nmillions. This enormous sum will astonish the most stupid stock-jobber,\r\nand overpower the credulity of the most thoughtless Englishman: but were\r\nit only a third part of that sum, the bank cannot pay half a crown in\r\nthe pound.\r\n\r\nThere is something curious in the movements of this modern complicated\r\nmachine, the funding system; and it is only now that it is beginning\r\nto unfold the full extent of its movements. In the first part of its\r\nmovements it gives great powers into the hands of government, and in the\r\nlast part it takes them completely away.\r\n\r\nThe funding system set out with raising revenues under the name of\r\nloans, by means of which government became both prodigal and powerful.\r\nThe loaners assumed the name of creditors, and though it was soon\r\ndiscovered that loaning was government-jobbing, those pretended loaners,\r\nor the persons who purchased into the funds afterwards, conceived\r\nthemselves not only to be creditors, but to be the _only_ creditors.\r\n\r\nBut such has been the operation of this complicated machine, the funding\r\nsystem, that it has produced, unperceived, a second generation of\r\ncreditors, more numerous and far more formidable and withal more\r\nreal than the first generation; for every holder of a bank note is a\r\ncreditor, and a real creditor, and the debt due to him is made payable\r\non demand. The debt therefore which the government owes to individuals\r\nis composed of two parts; the one about four hundred millions bearing\r\ninterest, the other about sixty millions payable on demand. The one is\r\ncalled the funded debt, the other is the debt due in bank notes.\r\n\r\nThe second debt (that contained in the bank notes) has, in a great\r\nmeasure, been incurred to pay the interest of the first debt; so that in\r\nfact little or no real interest has been paid by government. The whole\r\nhas been delusion and fraud. Government first contracted a debt, in the\r\nform of loans, with one class of people, and then run clandestinely into\r\ndebt with another class, by means of bank notes, to pay the interest.\r\nGovernment acted of itself in contracting the first debt, and made a\r\nmachine of the bank to contract the second. It is this second debt that\r\nchanges the seat of power and the order of things; for it puts it in\r\nthe power of even a small part of the holders of bank notes (had they no\r\nother motives than disgust at Pitt and Grenville's sedition bills,) to\r\ncontrol any measure of government they found to be injurious to their\r\ninterest; and that not by popular meetings, or popular societies, but\r\nby the simple and easy opera-tion of withholding their credit from that\r\ngovernment; that is, by individually demanding payment at the bank\r\nfor every bank note that comes into their hands. Why should Pitt and\r\nGrenville expect that the very men whom they insult and injure,\r\nshould, at the same time, continue to support the measures of Pitt and\r\nGrenville, by giving credit to their promissory notes of payment? No new\r\nemissions of bank notes could go on while payment was demanding on the\r\nold, and the cash in the bank wasting daily away; nor any new advances\r\nbe made to government, or to the emperor, to carry on the war; nor any\r\nnew emission be made on exchequer bills.\r\n\r\n\"_The bank_\" says Smith, (book ii. chap. 2) \"_is a great engine of\r\nstate_.\" And in the same paragraph he says, \"_The stability of the bank\r\nis equal to that of the British government_;\" which is the same as to\r\nsay that the stability of the government is equal to that of the bank,\r\nand no more. If then the bank cannot pay, the _arch-treasurer_ of the\r\nholy Roman empire (S. R. I. A.*) is a bankrupt. When Folly invented\r\ntitles, she did not attend to their application; forever since the\r\ngovernment of England has been in the hands of _arch-treasurers_, it has\r\nbeen running into bankruptcy; and as to the arch-treasurer _apparent_,\r\nhe has been a bankrupt long ago. What a miserable prospect has England\r\nbefore its eyes!\r\n\r\n     * Put of the inscription on an English guinea.--_Author_.\r\n\r\nBefore the war of 1755 there were no bank notes lower than twenty\r\npounds. During that war, bank notes of fifteen pounds and of ten pounds\r\nwere coined; and now, since the commencement of the present war, they\r\nare coined as low as five pounds. These five-pound notes will circulate\r\nchiefly among little shop-keepers, butchers, bakers, market-people,\r\nrenters of small houses, lodgers, &c. All the high departments of\r\ncommerce and the affluent stations of life were already _overstocked_,\r\nas Smith expresses it, with the bank notes. No place remained open\r\nwherein to crowd an additional quantity of bank notes but among the\r\nclass of people I have just mentioned, and the means of doing this\r\ncould be best effected by coining five-pound notes. This conduct has the\r\nappearance of that of an unprincipled insolvent, who, when on the verge\r\nof bankruptcy to the amount of many thousands, will borrow as low as\r\nfive pounds of the servants in his house, and break the next day.\r\n\r\nBut whatever momentary relief or aid the minister and his bank might\r\nexpect from this low contrivance of five-pound notes, it will increase\r\nthe inability of the bank to pay the higher notes, and hasten the\r\ndestruction of all; for even the small taxes that used to be paid in\r\nmoney will now be paid in those notes, and the bank will soon find\r\nitself with scarcely any other money than what the hair-powder\r\nguinea-tax brings in.\r\n\r\nThe bank notes make the most serious part of the business of finance:\r\nwhat is called the national funded debt is but a trifle when put in\r\ncomparison with it; yet the case of the bank notes has never been\r\ntouched upon. But it certainly ought to be known upon what authority,\r\nwhether that of the minister or of the directors, and upon what\r\nfoundation, such immense quantities are issued. I have stated the amount\r\nof them at sixty millions; I have produced data for that estimation; and\r\nbesides this, the apparent quantity of them, far beyond that of gold and\r\nsilver in the nation, corroborates the statement. But were there but a\r\nthird part of sixty millions, the bank cannot pay half a crown in the\r\npound; for no new supply of money, as before said, can arrive at the\r\nbank, as all the taxes will be paid in paper.\r\n\r\nWhen the funding system began, it was not doubted that the loans that\r\nhad been borrowed would be repaid. Government not only propagated that\r\nbelief, but it began paying them off. In time this profession came to be\r\nabandoned: and it is not difficult to see that bank notes will march\r\nthe same way; for the amount of them is only another debt under another\r\nname; and the probability is that Mr. Pitt will at last propose\r\nfunding them. In that case bank notes will not be so valuable as French\r\nassignats. The assignats have a solid property in reserve, in the\r\nnational domains; bank notes have none; and, besides this, the English\r\nrevenue must then sink down to what the amount of it was before the\r\nfunding system began--between three and four millions; one of which\r\nthe _arch-treasurer_ would require for himself, and the arch-treasurer\r\n_apparent_ would require three-quarters of a million more to pay his\r\ndebts. \"_In France_,\" says Sterne, \"_they order these things better_.\"\r\n\r\nI have now exposed the English system of finance to the eyes of all\r\nnations; for this work will be published in all languages. In doing\r\nthis, I have done an act of justice to those numerous citizens of\r\nneutral nations who have been imposed upon by that fraudulent system,\r\nand who have property at stake upon the event.\r\n\r\nAs an individual citizen of America, and as far as an individual can\r\ngo, I have revenged (if I may use the expression without any immoral\r\nmeaning) the piratical depredations committed on the American commerce\r\nby the English government. I have retaliated for France on the subject\r\nof finance: and I conclude with retorting on Mr. Pitt the expression he\r\nused against France, and say, that the English system of finance \"is on\r\nthe verge, nay even in the\r\n\r\nGULPH OF BANKRUPTCY.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nPARIS, 19th Germinal. 4th year of the Republic, April 8, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. FORGETFULNESS.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This undated composition, of much biographical interest,\r\n     was shown by Paine to Henry Redhead Yorke, who visited him\r\n     in Paris (1802), and was allowed to copy the only portions\r\n     now preserved. In the last of Yorke's Letters from France\r\n     (Lond., 1814), thirty-three pages are given to Paine. Under\r\n     the name \"Little Corner of the World,\" Lady Smyth wrote\r\n     cheering letters to Paine in his prison, and he replied to\r\n     his then unknown correspondent under the name of \"The Castle\r\n     in die Air.\" After his release he discovered in his\r\n     correspondent a lady who had appealed to him for assistance,\r\n     no doubt for her husband. With Sir Robert (an English banker\r\n     in Paris) and Lady Smyth, Paine formed a fast friendship\r\n     which continued through life. Sir Robert was born in 1744,\r\n     and married (1776) a Miss Blake of Hanover Square, London.\r\n     He died in 1802 of illness brought on by his imprisonment\r\n     under Napoleon. Several of Paine's poems were addressed to\r\n     Lady Smyth.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM \"THE CASTLE IN THE AIR,\" TO THE \"LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD.\"\r\n\r\nMemory, like a beauty that is always present to hear her-self\r\nflattered, is flattered by every one. But the absent and silent goddess,\r\nForgetfulness, has no votaries, and is never thought of: yet we owe her\r\nmuch. She is the goddess of ease, though not of pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen the mind is like a room hung with black, and every corner of it\r\ncrowded with the most horrid images imagination can create, this kind\r\nspeechless goddess of a maid, Forgetfulness, is following us night\r\nand day with her opium wand, and gently touching first one, and then\r\nanother, benumbs them into rest, and at last glides them away with the\r\nsilence of a departing shadow. It is thus the tortured mind is restored\r\nto the calm condition of ease, and fitted for happiness.\r\n\r\nHow dismal must the picture of life appear to the mind in that dreadful\r\nmoment when it resolves on darkness, and to die! One can scarcely\r\nbelieve such a choice was possible. Yet how many of the young and\r\nbeautiful, timid in every thing else, and formed for delight, have shut\r\ntheir eyes upon the world, and made the waters their sepulchral bed! Ah,\r\nwould they in that crisis, when life and death are before them, and\r\neach within their reach, would they but think, or try to think, that\r\nForgetfulness will come to their relief, and lull them into ease, they\r\ncould stay their hand, and lay hold of life. But there is a necromancy\r\nin wretchedness that entombs the mind, and increases the misery, by\r\nshutting out every ray of light and hope. It makes the wretched\r\nfalsely believe they will be wretched ever. It is the most fatal of all\r\ndangerous delusions; and it is only when this necromantic night-mare of\r\nthe mind begins to vanish, by being resisted, that it is discovered to\r\nbe but a tyrannic spectre. All grief, like all things else, will yield\r\nto the obliterating power of time. While despair is preying on the mind,\r\ntime and its effects are preying on despair; and certain it is, the\r\ndismal vision will fade away, and Forgetfulness, with her sister Ease,\r\nwill change the scene. Then let not the wretched be rash, but wait,\r\npainful as the struggle may be, the arrival of Forgetfulness; for it\r\nwill certainly arrive.\r\n\r\nI have twice been present at the scene of attempted suicide. The one\r\na love-distracted girl in England, the other of a patriotic friend in\r\nFrance; and as the circumstances of each are strongly pictured in my\r\nmemory, I will relate them to you. They will in some measure corroborate\r\nwhat I have said of Forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1766, I was in Lincolnshire, in England, and on a visit\r\nat the house of a widow lady, Mrs. E____, at a small village in the fens\r\nof that county. It was in summer; and one evening after supper, Mrs.\r\nE____ and myself went to take a turn in the garden. It was about eleven\r\no'clock, and to avoid the night air of the fens, we were walking in a\r\nbower, shaded over with hazel bushes. On a sudden, she screamed out,\r\nand cried \"Lord, look, look!\" I cast my eyes through the openings of the\r\nhazel bushes in the direction she was looking, and saw a white shapeless\r\nfigure, without head or arms, moving along one of the walks at some\r\ndistance from us. I quitted Mrs. E______, and went after it. When I got\r\ninto the walk where the figure was, and was following it, it took up\r\nanother walk. There was a holly bush in the corner of the two walks,\r\nwhich, it being night, I did not observe; and as I continued to step\r\nforward, the holly bush came in a straight line between me and the\r\nfigure, and I lost sight of it; and as I passed along one walk, and the\r\nfigure the other, the holly bush still continued to intercept the view,\r\nso as to give the appearance that the figure had vanished. When I came\r\nto the corner of the two walks, I caught sight of it again, and coming\r\nup with it, I reached out my hand to touch it; and in the act of doing\r\nthis, the idea struck me, will my hand pass through the air, or shall I\r\nfeel any thing? Less than a moment would decide this, and my hand rested\r\non the shoulder of a human figure. I spoke, but do not recollect what I\r\nsaid. It answered in a low voice, \"Pray let me alone.\" I then knew who\r\nit was. It was a young lady who was on a visit to Mrs. E------, and who,\r\nwhen we sat down to supper, said she found herself extremely ill, and\r\nwould go to bed. I called to Mrs. E------, who came, and I said to her,\r\n\"It is Miss N------.\" Mrs. E------ said, \"My God, I hope you are not\r\ngoing to do yourself any hurt;\" for Mrs. E------ suspected something.\r\nShe replied with pathetic melancholy, \"Life has not one pleasure for\r\nme.\" We got her into the house, and Mrs. E------ took her to sleep with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe case was, the man to whom she expected to be married had forsaken\r\nher, and when she heard he was to be married to another the shock\r\nappeared to her to be too great to be borne. She had retired, as I have\r\nsaid, to her room, and when she supposed all the family were gone to\r\nbed, (which would have been the case if Mrs. E------ and I had not\r\nwalked into the garden,) she undressed herself, and tied her apron over\r\nher head; which, descending below her waist, gave her the shapeless\r\nfigure I have spoken of. With this and a white under petticoat and\r\nslippers, for she had taken out her buckles and put them at the servant\r\nmaid's door, I suppose as a keepsake, and aided by the obscurity of\r\nalmost midnight, she came down stairs, and was going to drown her-self\r\nin a pond at the bottom of the garden, towards which she was going when\r\nMrs. E------screamed out. We found afterwards that she had heard the\r\nscream, and that was the cause of her changing her walk.\r\n\r\nBy gentle usage, and leading her into subjects that might, without\r\ndoing violence to her feelings, and without letting her see the direct\r\nintention of it, steal her as it were from the horror she was in, (and\r\nI felt a compassionate, earnest disposition to do it, for she was a good\r\ngirl,) she recovered her former cheerfulness, and was afterwards a happy\r\nwife, and the mother of a family.\r\n\r\nThe other case, and the conclusion in my next: In Paris, in 1793, had\r\nlodgings in the Rue Fauxbourg, St. Denis, No. 63.(1) They were the most\r\nagreeable, for situation, of any I ever had in Paris, except that they\r\nwere too remote from the Convention, of which I was then a member. But\r\nthis was recompensed by their being also remote from the alarms and\r\nconfusion into which the interior of Paris was then often thrown. The\r\nnews of those things used to arrive to us, as if we were in a state of\r\ntranquility in the country. The house, which was enclosed by a wall and\r\ngateway from the street, was a good deal like an old mansion farm house,\r\nand the court yard was like a farm-yard, stocked with fowls, ducks,\r\nturkies, and geese; which, for amusement, we used to feed out of the\r\nparlour window on the ground floor. There were some hutches for rabbits,\r\nand a sty with two pigs. Beyond, was a garden of more than an acre\r\nof ground, well laid out, and stocked with excellent fruit trees. The\r\norange, apricot, and green-gage plum, were the best I ever tasted;\r\nand it is the only place where I saw the wild cucumber. The place had\r\nformerly been occupied by some curious person.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 This ancient mansion is still standing (1895).--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Madame de Pompadour, among others.--_Editor._»\r\n\r\nMy apartments consisted of three rooms; the first for wood, water, etc.,\r\nwith an old fashioned closet chest, high enough to hang up clothes in;\r\nthe next was the bed room; and beyond it the sitting room, which looked\r\ninto the garden through a glass door; and on the outside there was a\r\nsmall landing place railed in, and a flight of narrow stairs almost\r\nhidden by the vines that grew over it, by which I could descend into\r\nthe garden, without going down stairs through the house. I am trying\r\nby description to make you see the place in your mind, because it will\r\nassist the story I have to tell; and which I think you can do, because\r\nyou once called upon me there on account of Sir [Robert Smyth], who was\r\nthen, as I was soon afterwards, in arrestation. But it was winter when\r\nyou came, and it is a summer scene I am describing.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI went into my chambers to write and sign a certificate for them, which\r\nI intended to take to the guard house to obtain their release. Just as I\r\nhad finished it a man came into my room dressed in the Parisian uniform\r\nof a captain, and spoke to me in good English, and with a good address.\r\nHe told me that two young men, Englishmen, were arrested and detained\r\nin the guard house, and that the section, (meaning those who represented\r\nand acted for the section,) had sent him to ask me if I knew them,\r\nin which case they would be liberated. This matter being soon settled\r\nbetween us, he talked to me about the Revolution, and something about\r\nthe \"Rights of Man,\" which he had read in English; and at parting\r\noffered me in a polite and civil manner, his services. And who do you\r\nthink the man was that offered me his services? It was no other than the\r\npublic executioner Samson, who guillotined the king, and all who were\r\nguillotined in Paris; and who lived in the same section, and in the same\r\nstreet with me.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I used to find some relief by walking alone in the garden\r\nafter dark, and cursing with hearty good will the authors of that\r\nterrible system that had turned the character of the Revolution I had\r\nbeen proud to defend.\r\n\r\nI went but little to the Convention, and then only to make my\r\nappearance; because I found it impossible to join in their tremendous\r\ndecrees, and useless and dangerous to oppose them. My having voted and\r\nspoken extensively, more so than any other member, against the execution\r\nof the king, had already fixed a mark upon me: neither dared any of my\r\nassociates in the Convention to translate and speak in French for me\r\nanything I might have dared to have written.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPen and ink were then of no use to me: no good could be done by writing,\r\nand no printer dared to print; and whatever I might have written for\r\nmy private amusement, as anecdotes of the times, would have been\r\ncontinually exposed to be examined, and tortured into any meaning that\r\nthe rage of party might fix upon it; and as to softer subjects, my heart\r\nwas in distress at the fate of my friends, and my harp hung upon the\r\nweeping willows.(1)\r\n\r\nAs it was summer we spent most of our time in the garden, and passed it\r\naway in those childish amusements that serve to keep reflection from the\r\nmind, such as marbles, scotch-hops, battledores, etc., at which we were\r\nall pretty expert.\r\n\r\nIn this retired manner we remained about six or seven weeks, and our\r\nlandlord went every evening into the city to bring us the news of the\r\nday and the evening journal.\r\n\r\nI have now, my \"Little Corner of the World,\" led you on, step by step,\r\nto the scene that makes the sequel to this narrative, and I will put\r\nthat scene before your eyes. You shall see it in description as I saw it\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\n     1 This allusion is to the Girondins.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\n     2 Yorke omits the description \"from motives of personal\r\n     delicacy.\" The case was that of young Johnson, a wealthy\r\n     devotee of Paine in London, who had followed him to Paris\r\n     and lived in the same house with him. Hearing that Marat had\r\n     resolved on Paine's death, Johnson wrote a will bequeathing\r\n     his property to Paine, then stabbed himself, but recovered.\r\n     Paine was examined about this incident at Marat's trial.\r\n     (Moniteur, April 24, 1793.) See my \"Life of Paine,\" vol.\r\n     ii., p. 48 seq.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHe recovered, and being anxious to get out of France, a passage was\r\nobtained for him and Mr. Choppin: they received it late in the evening,\r\nand set off the next morning for Basle before four, from which place I\r\nhad a letter from them, highly pleased with their escape from France,\r\ninto which they had entered with an enthusiasm of patriotic devotion.\r\nAh, France! thou hast ruined the character of a Revolution virtuously\r\nbegun, and destroyed those who produced it. I might almost say like\r\nJob's servant, \"and I only am escaped.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days after they were gone I heard a rapping at the gate, and looking\r\nout of the window of the bed room I saw the landlord going with the\r\ncandle to the gate, which he opened, and a guard with musquets and fixed\r\nbayonets entered. I went to bed again, and made up my mind for prison,\r\nfor I was then the only lodger. It was a guard to take up [Johnson and\r\nChoppin], but, I thank God, they were out of their reach.\r\n\r\nThe guard came about a month after in the night, and took away the\r\nlandlord Georgeit; and the scene in the house finished with the\r\narrestation of myself. This was soon after you called on me, and sorry\r\nI was it was not in my power to render to [Sir Robert Smyth] the service\r\nthat you asked.\r\n\r\nI have now fulfilled my engagement, and I hope your expectation, in\r\nrelating the case of [Johnson], landed back on the shore of life, by\r\nthe mistake of the pilot who was conducting him out; and preserved\r\nafterwards from prison, perhaps a worse fate, without knowing it\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nYou say a story cannot be too melancholy for you. This is interesting\r\nand affecting, but not melancholy. It may raise in your mind a\r\nsympathetic sentiment in reading it; and though it may start a tear of\r\npity, you will not have a tear of sorrow to drop on the page.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHere, my contemplative correspondent, let us stop and look back upon the\r\nscene. The matters here related being all facts, are strongly pictured\r\nin my mind, and in this sense Forgetfulness does not apply. But facts\r\nand feelings are distinct things, and it is against feelings that the\r\nopium wand of Forgetfulness draws us into ease. Look back on any scene\r\nor subject that once gave you distress, for all of us have felt some,\r\nand you will find, that though the remembrance of the fact is not\r\nextinct in your memory, the feeling is extinct in your mind. You can\r\nremember when you had felt distress, but you cannot feel that distress\r\nagain, and perhaps will wonder you felt it then. It is like a shadow\r\nthat loses itself by light.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to know what is a misfortune: that which we feel\r\nas a great one today, may be the means of turning aside our steps into\r\nsome new path that leads to happiness yet unknown. In tracing the scenes\r\nof my own life, I can discover that the condition I now enjoy, which is\r\nsweet to me, and will be more so when I get to America, except by the\r\nloss of your society, has been produced, in the first instance, in my\r\nbeing disappointed in former projects. Under that impenetrable veil,\r\nfuturity, we know not what is concealed, and the day to arrive is hidden\r\nfrom us. Turning then our thoughts to those cases of despair that lead\r\nto suicide, when, \"the mind,\" as you say, \"neither sees nor hears, and\r\nholds counsel only with itself; when the very idea of consolation would\r\nadd to the torture, and self-destruction is its only aim,\" what, it may\r\nbe asked, is the best advice, what the best relief? I answer, seek it\r\nnot in reason, for the mind is at war with reason, and to reason against\r\nfeelings is as vain as to reason against fire: it serves only to torture\r\nthe torture, by adding reproach to horror. All reasoning with ourselves\r\nin such cases acts upon us like the reason of another person, which,\r\nhowever kindly done, serves but to insult the misery we suffer. If\r\nreason could remove the pain, reason would have prevented it. If she\r\ncould not do the one, how is she to perform the other? In all such cases\r\nwe must look upon Reason as dispossessed of her empire, by a revolt\r\nof the mind. She retires herself to a distance to weep, and the ebony\r\nsceptre of Despair rules alone. All that Reason can do is to suggest,\r\nto hint a thought, to signify a wish, to cast now and then a kind\r\nof bewailing look, to hold up, when she can catch the eye, the\r\nminiature-shaded portrait of Hope; and though dethroned, and can dictate\r\nno more, to wait upon us in the humble station of a handmaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII. AGRARIAN JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nEditor's introduction:\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet appeared first in Paris, 1797, with the title: \"Thomas\r\nPayne à La Législature et au Directoire. Ou la Justice Agraire opposée à\r\nla Loi Agraire, et aux privilèges agraires. Prix 15 sols. À Paris, chez\r\nla citoyenne Ragouleau, près le Théâtre de la République, No. 229. Et\r\nchez les Marchands de Nouveautés.\" A prefatory note says (translated):\r\n\"The sudden departure of Thomas Paine has pre-vented his supervising the\r\ntranslation of this work, to which he attached great value. He entrusted\r\nit to a friend. It is for the reader to decide whether the scheme here\r\nset forth is worthy of the publicity given it.\" (Paine had gone to Havre\r\nearly in May with the Monroes, intending to accompany them to America,\r\nbut, rightly suspecting plans for his capture by an English cruiser,\r\nreturned to Paris.) In the same year the pamphlet was printed in\r\nEnglish, by W. Adlard in Paris, and in London for \"T. Williams, No.\r\n8 Little Turnstile, Holborn.\" Paine's preface to the London edition\r\ncontained some sentences which the publishers, as will be seen,\r\nsuppressed under asterisks, and two sentences were omitted from the\r\npamphlet which I have supplied from the French. The English title adds a\r\nbrief resume of Paine's scheme to the caption--\"Agrarian Justice opposed\r\nto Agrarian Law, and to Agrarian Monopoly.\" The work was written in the\r\nwinter of 1795-6, when Paine was still an invalid in Monroe's house,\r\nthough not published until 1797.\r\n\r\nThe prefatory Letter to the Legislature and the Directory, now for the\r\nfirst time printed in English, is of much historical interest, and shows\r\nthe title of the pamphlet related to the rise of Socialism in France.\r\nThe leader of that move-ment, François Noel Babeuf, a frantic and\r\npathetic figure of the time, had just been executed. He had named\r\nhimself \"Gracchus,\" and called his journal \"Tribune du Peuple,\" in\r\nhomage to the Roman Tribune, Caius Gracchus, the original socialist and\r\nagrarian, whose fate (suicide of himself and his servant) Babeuf and his\r\ndisciple Darthé invoked in prison, whence they were carried bleeding to\r\nthe guillotine. This, however, was on account of the conspiracy they had\r\nformed, with the remains of the Robespierrian party and some disguised\r\nroyalists, to overthrow the government. The socialistic propaganda of\r\nBabeuf, however, prevailed over all other elements of the conspiracy:\r\nthe reactionary features of the Constitution, especially the property\r\nqualification of suffrage of whose effects Paine had warned the\r\nConvention in the speech printed in this volume, (chapter xxv.) and the\r\npoverty which survived a revolution that promised its abolition, had\r\nexcited wide discontent. The \"Babouvists\" numbered as many as 17,000 in\r\nParis. Babeuf and Lepelletier were appointed by the secret council of\r\nthis fraternity (which took the name of \"Equals\") a \"Directory of Public\r\nSafety.\" May 11, 1796, was fixed for seizing on the government, and\r\nBabeuf had prepared his Proclamation of the socialistic millennium. But\r\nthe plot was discovered, May 10th, the leaders arrested, and, after\r\na year's delay, two of them executed,--the best-hearted men in the\r\nmovement, Babeuf and Darthé. Paine too had been moved by the cry for\r\n\"Bread, and the Constitution of '93 \"; and it is a notable coincidence\r\nthat in that winter of 1795-6, while the socialists were secretly\r\nplotting to seize the kingdom of heaven by violence, Paine was devising\r\nhis plan of relief by taxing inheritances of land, anticipating by a\r\nhundred years the English budget of Sir William Harcourt. Babeuf having\r\nfailed in his socialist, and Pichegru in his royalist, plot, their blows\r\nwere yet fatal: there still remained in the hearts of millions a Babeuf\r\nor a Pichegru awaiting the chieftain strong enough to combine them,\r\nas Napoleon presently did, making all the nation \"Égaux\" as parts of a\r\nmighty military engine, and satisfying the royalist triflers with the\r\npomp and glory of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S INSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nTo the Legislature and the Executive Directory of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nThe plan contained in this work is not adapted for any particular\r\ncountry alone: the principle on which it is based is general. But as the\r\nrights of man are a new study in this world, and one needing protection\r\nfrom priestly imposture, and the insolence of oppressions too long\r\nestablished, I have thought it right to place this little work under\r\nyour safeguard. When we reflect on the long and dense night in which\r\nFrance and all Europe have remained plunged by their governments and\r\ntheir priests, we must feel less surprise than grief at the bewilderment\r\ncaused by the first burst of light that dispels the darkness. The eye\r\naccustomed to darkness can hardly bear at first the broad daylight. It\r\nis by usage the eye learns to see, and it is the same in passing from\r\nany situation to its opposite.\r\n\r\nAs we have not at one instant renounced all our errors, we cannot at one\r\nstroke acquire knowledge of all our rights. France has had the honour of\r\nadding to the word _Liberty_ that of _Equality_; and this word signifies\r\nessentially a principal that admits of no gradation in the things to\r\nwhich it applies. But equality is often misunderstood, often misapplied,\r\nand often violated.\r\n\r\n_Liberty_ and _Property_ are words expressing all those of our\r\npossessions which are not of an intellectual nature. There are two kinds\r\nof property. Firstly, natural property, or that which comes to us from\r\nthe Creator of the universe,--such as the earth, air, water. Secondly,\r\nartificial or acquired property,--the invention of men. In the latter\r\nequality is impossible; for to distribute it equally it would be\r\nnecessary that all should have contributed in the same proportion, which\r\ncan never be the case; and this being the case, every individual would\r\nhold on to his own property, as his right share. Equality of natural\r\nproperty is the subject of this little essay. Every individual in\r\nthe world is born therein with legitimate claims on a certain kind of\r\nproperty, or its equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe right of voting for persons charged with the execution of the laws\r\nthat govern society is inherent in the word Liberty, and constitutes\r\nthe equality of personal rights. But even if that right (of voting) were\r\ninherent in property, which I deny, the right of suffrage would still\r\nbelong to all equally, because, as I have said, all individuals have\r\nlegitimate birthrights in a certain species of property.\r\n\r\nI have always considered the present Constitution of the French Republic\r\nthe _best organized system_ the human mind has yet produced. But I hope\r\nmy former colleagues will not be offended if I warn them of an error\r\nwhich has slipped into its principle. Equality of the right of suffrage\r\nis not maintained. This right is in it connected with a condition on\r\nwhich it ought not to depend; that is, with a proportion of a certain\r\ntax called \"direct.\" The dignity of suffrage is thus lowered; and, in\r\nplacing it in the scale with an inferior thing, the enthusiasm that\r\nright is capable of inspiring is diminished. It is impossible to find\r\nany equivalent counterpoise for the right of suffrage, because it is\r\nalone worthy to be its own basis, and cannot thrive as a graft, or an\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nSince the Constitution was established we have seen two conspiracies\r\nstranded,--that of Babeuf, and that of some obscure personages who\r\ndecorate themselves with the despicable name of \"royalists.\" The defect\r\nin principle of the Constitution was the origin of Babeuf's conspiracy.\r\nHe availed himself of the resentment caused by this flaw, and instead\r\nof seeking a remedy by legitimate and constitutional means, or proposing\r\nsome measure useful to society, the conspirators did their best to renew\r\ndisorder and confusion, and constituted themselves personally into a\r\nDirectory, which is formally destructive of election and representation.\r\nThey were, in fine, extravagant enough to suppose that society, occupied\r\nwith its domestic affairs, would blindly yield to them a directorship\r\nusurped by violence.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy of Babeuf was followed in a few months by that of the\r\nroyalists, who foolishly flattered themselves with the notion of\r\ndoing great things by feeble or foul means. They counted on all the\r\ndiscontented, from whatever cause, and tried to rouse, in their turn,\r\nthe class of people who had been following the others. But these new\r\nchiefs acted as if they thought society had nothing more at heart\r\nthan to maintain courtiers, pensioners, and all their train, under the\r\ncontemptible title of royalty. My little essay will disabuse them, by\r\nshowing that society is aiming at a very different end,--maintaining\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWe all know or should know, that the time during which a revolution is\r\nproceeding is not the time when its resulting advantages can be\r\nenjoyed. But had Babeuf and his accomplices taken into consideration the\r\ncondition of France under this constitution, and compared it with what\r\nit was under the tragical revolutionary government, and during the\r\nexecrable reign of Terror, the rapidity of the alteration must have\r\nappeared to them very striking and astonishing. Famine has been replaced\r\nby abundance, and by the well-founded hope of a near and increasing\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nAs for the defect in the Constitution, I am fully convinced that it will\r\nbe rectified constitutionally, and that this step is indispensable; for\r\nso long as it continues it will inspire the hopes and furnish the means\r\nof conspirators; and for the rest, it is regrettable that a Constitution\r\nso wisely organized should err so much in its principle. This fault\r\nexposes it to other dangers which will make themselves felt. Intriguing\r\ncandidates will go about among those who have not the means to pay the\r\ndirect tax and pay it for them, on condition of receiving their votes.\r\nLet us maintain inviolably equality in the sacred right of suffrage:\r\npublic security can never have a basis more solid. Salut et Fraternité.\r\n\r\nYour former colleague,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S ENGLISH PREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe following little Piece was written in the winter of 1795 and 96;\r\nand, as I had not determined whether to publish it during the present\r\nwar, or to wait till the commencement of a peace, it has lain by me,\r\nwithout alteration or addition, from the time it was written.\r\n\r\nWhat has determined me to publish it now is, a sermon preached by\r\nWatson, _Bishop of Llandaff_. Some of my Readers will recollect, that\r\nthis Bishop wrote a Book entitled _An Apology for the Bible_ in answer\r\nto my _Second Part of the Age of Reason_. I procured a copy of his Book,\r\nand he may depend upon hearing from me on that subject.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Bishop's Book is a List of the Works he has written.\r\nAmong which is the sermon alluded to; it is entitled: \"The Wisdom and\r\nGoodness of God, in having made both Rich and Poor; with an Appendix,\r\ncontaining Reflections on the Present State of England and France.\"\r\n\r\nThe error contained in this sermon determined me to publish my Agrarian\r\nJustice. It is wrong to say God made _rich and poor_; he made only _male\r\nand female_; and he gave them the earth for their inheritance. '...\r\n\r\nInstead of preaching to encourage one part of mankind in insolence... it\r\nwould be better that Priests employed their time to render the general\r\ncondition of man less miserable than it is. Practical religion consists\r\nin doing good: and the only way of serving God is, that of endeavouring\r\nto make his creation happy. All preaching that has not this for its\r\nobject is nonsense and hypocracy.\r\n\r\n     1 The omissions are noted in the English edition of 1797.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to remedy\r\nat the same time the evil which it has produced, ought to be considered\r\nas one of the first objects of reformed legislation.\r\n\r\nWhether that state that is proudly, perhaps erroneously, called\r\ncivilization, has most promoted or most injured the general happiness\r\nof man, is a question that may be strongly contested. On one side,\r\nthe spectator is dazzled by splendid appearances; on the other, he is\r\nshocked by extremes of wretchedness; both of which it has erected. The\r\nmost affluent and the most miserable of the human race are to be found\r\nin the countries that are called civilized.\r\n\r\nTo understand what the state of society ought to be, it is necessary to\r\nhave some idea of the natural and primitive state of man; such as it is\r\nat this day among the Indians of North America. There is not, in that\r\nstate, any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and want\r\npresent to our eyes in all the towns and streets in Europe. Poverty,\r\ntherefore, is a thing created by that which is called civilized life. It\r\nexists not in the natural state. On the other hand, the natural state is\r\nwithout those advantages which flow from agriculture, arts, science, and\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThe life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor of\r\nEurope; and, on the other hand it appears to be abject when compared\r\nto the rich. Civilization, therefore, or that which is so called, has\r\noperated two ways: to make one part of society more affluent, and the\r\nother more wretched, than would have been the lot of either in a natural\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIt is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state, but\r\nit is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state. The\r\nreason is, that man in a natural state, subsisting by hunting, requires\r\nten times the quantity of land to range over to procure himself\r\nsustenance, than would support him in a civilized state, where the\r\nearth is cultivated. When, therefore, a country becomes populous by the\r\nadditional aids of cultivation, art, and science, there is a necessity\r\nof preserving things in that state; because without it there cannot be\r\nsustenance for more, perhaps, than a tenth part of its inhabitants. The\r\nthing, therefore, now to be done is to remedy the evils and preserve the\r\nbenefits that have arisen to society by passing from the natural to that\r\nwhich is called the civilized state.\r\n\r\nIn taking the matter upon this ground, the first principle of\r\ncivilization ought to have been, and ought still to be, that the\r\ncondition of every person born into the world, after a state of\r\ncivilization commences, ought not to be worse than if he had been born\r\nbefore that period. But the fact is, that the condition of millions, in\r\nevery country in Europe, is far worse than if they had been born before\r\ncivilization began, or had been born among the Indians of North America\r\nat the present day. I will shew how this fact has happened.\r\n\r\nIt is a position not to be controverted that the earth, in its natural\r\nuncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, _the common\r\nproperty of the human race_. In that state every man would have been\r\nborn to property. He would have been a joint life proprietor with the\r\nrest in the property of the soil, and in all its natural productions,\r\nvegetable and animal.\r\n\r\nBut the earth in its natural state, as before said, is capable of\r\nsupporting but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it\r\nis capable of doing in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to\r\nseparate the improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon\r\nwhich that improvement is made, the idea of landed property arose from\r\nthat inseparable connection; but it is nevertheless true, that it is\r\nthe value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is\r\nindividual property. Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated land,\r\nowes to the community a _ground-rent_ (for I know of no better term\r\nto express the idea) for the land which he holds; and it is from this\r\nground-rent that the fund proposed in this plan is to issue.\r\n\r\nIt is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing as from all the\r\nhistories transmitted to us, that the idea of landed property commenced\r\nwith cultivation, and that there was no such thing as landed property\r\nbefore that time. It could not exist in the first state of man, that\r\nof hunters. It did not exist in the second state, that of shepherds:\r\nneither Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, nor Job, so far as the history of the\r\nBible may be credited in probable things, were owners of land. Their\r\nproperty consisted, as is always enumerated, in flocks and herds, and\r\nthey travelled with them from place to place. The frequent contentions\r\nat that time, about the use of a well in the dry country of Arabia,\r\nwhere those people lived, also shew that there was no landed property.\r\nIt was not admitted that land could be claimed as property.\r\n\r\nThere could be no such thing as landed property originally. Man did not\r\nmake the earth, and, though he had a natural right to occupy it, he had\r\nno right to locate as his property in perpetuity any part of it; neither\r\ndid the creator of the earth open a land-office, from whence the\r\nfirst title-deeds should issue. Whence then, arose the idea of landed\r\nproperty? I answer as before, that when cultivation began the idea of\r\nlanded property began with it, from the impossibility of separating the\r\nimprovement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which that\r\nimprovement was made. The value of the improvement so far exceeded the\r\nvalue of the natural earth, at that time, as to absorb it; till, in the\r\nend, the common right of all became confounded into the cultivated right\r\nof the individual. But there are, nevertheless, distinct species of\r\nrights, and will continue to be so long as the earth endures.\r\n\r\nIt is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain rightful\r\nideas of them, and it is by gaining such ideas that we discover the\r\nboundary that divides right from wrong, and teaches every man to know\r\nhis own. I have entitled this tract Agrarian Justice, to distinguish it\r\nfrom Agrarian Law. Nothing could be more unjust than Agrarian Law in a\r\ncountry improved by cultivation; for though every man, as an inhabitant\r\nof the earth, is a joint proprietor of it in its natural state, it\r\ndoes not follow that he is a joint proprietor of cultivated earth. The\r\nadditional value made by cultivation, after the system was admitted,\r\nbecame the property of those who did it, or who inherited it from them,\r\nor who purchased it. It had originally no owner. Whilst, therefore, I\r\nadvocate the right, and interest myself in the hard case of all\r\nthose who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance by the\r\nintroduction of the system of landed property, I equally defend the\r\nright of the possessor to the part which is his.\r\n\r\nCultivation is at least one of the greatest natural improvements ever\r\nmade by human invention. It has given to created earth a tenfold value.\r\nBut the landed monopoly that began with it has produced the greatest\r\nevil. It has dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation\r\nof their natural inheritance, without providing for them, as ought\r\nto have been done, an indemnification for that loss, and has thereby\r\ncreated a species of poverty and wretchedness that did not exist before.\r\n\r\nIn advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right,\r\nand not a charity, that I am pleading for. But it is that kind of right\r\nwhich, being neglected at first, could not be brought forward afterwards\r\ntill heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the system of\r\ngovernment. Let us then do honour to revolutions by justice, and give\r\ncurrency to their principles by blessings.\r\n\r\nHaving thus in a few words, opened the merits of the case, I shall now\r\nproceed to the plan I have to propose, which is,\r\n\r\nTo create a National Fund, out of which there shall be paid to every\r\nperson, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen\r\npounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or\r\nher natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed\r\nproperty:\r\n\r\nAnd also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person\r\nnow living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall\r\narrive at that age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS BY WHICH THE FUND IS TO BE CREATED.\r\n\r\nI have already established the principle, namely, that the earth, in its\r\nnatural uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the\r\n_common property of the human race_; that in that state, every person\r\nwould have been born to property; and that the system of landed\r\nproperty, by its inseparable connection with cultivation, and with what\r\nis called civilized life, has absorbed the property of all those whom\r\nit dispossessed, without providing, as ought to have been done, an\r\nindemnification for that loss.\r\n\r\nThe fault, however, is not in the present possessors. No complaint is\r\nintended, or ought to be alleged against them, unless they adopt the\r\ncrime by opposing justice. The fault is in the system, and it has stolen\r\nimperceptibly upon the world, aided afterwards by the agrarian law of\r\nthe sword. But the fault can be made to reform itself by successive\r\ngenerations; and without diminishing or deranging the property of any of\r\nthe present possessors, the operation of the fund can yet commence, and\r\nbe in full activity, the first year of its establishment, or soon after,\r\nas I shall shew.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the payments, as already stated, be made to every\r\nperson, rich or poor. It is best to make it so, to prevent invidious\r\ndistinctions. It is also right it should be so, because it is in lieu of\r\nthe natural inheritance, which, as a right, belongs to every man, over\r\nand above the property he may have created, or inherited from those who\r\ndid. Such persons as do not choose to receive it can throw it into the\r\ncommon fund.\r\n\r\nTaking it then for granted that no person ought to be in a worse\r\ncondition when born under what is called a state of civilization, than\r\nhe would have been had he been born in a state of nature, and that\r\ncivilization ought to have made, and ought still to make, provision for\r\nthat purpose, it can only be done by subtracting from property a portion\r\nequal in value to the natural inheritance it has absorbed.\r\n\r\nVarious methods may be proposed for this purpose, but that which appears\r\nto be the best (not only because it will operate without deranging any\r\npresent possessors, or without interfering with the collection of taxes\r\nor emprunts necessary for the purposes of government and the revolution,\r\nbut because it will be the least troublesome and the most effectual, and\r\nalso because the subtraction will be made at a time that best admits it)\r\nis at the moment that.. property is passing by the death of one person\r\nto the possession of another. In this case, the bequeather gives\r\nnothing: the receiver pays nothing. The only matter to him is, that\r\nthe monopoly of natural inheritance, to which there never was a right,\r\nbegins to cease in his person. A generous man would not wish it to\r\ncontinue, and a just man will rejoice to see it abolished.\r\n\r\nMy state of health prevents my making sufficient inquiries with respect\r\nto the doctrine of probabilities, whereon to found calculations with\r\nsuch degrees of certainty as they are capable of. What, therefore, I\r\noffer on this head is more the result of observation and reflection\r\nthan of received information; but I believe it will be found to agree\r\nsufficiently with fact.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, taking twenty-one years as the epoch of maturity,\r\nall the property of a nation, real and personal, is always in the\r\npossession of persons above that age. It is then necessary to know, as a\r\ndatum of calculation, the average of years which persons above that age\r\nwill live. I take this average to be about thirty years, for though\r\nmany persons will live forty, fifty, or sixty years after the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, others will die much sooner, and some in every year of\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, thirty years as the average of time, it will give, without\r\nany material variation one way or other, the average of time in which\r\nthe whole property or capital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will\r\nhave passed through one entire revolution in descent, that is, will have\r\ngone by deaths to new possessors; for though, in many instances, some\r\nparts of this capital will remain forty, fifty, or sixty years in the\r\npossession of one person, other parts will have revolved two or three\r\ntimes before those thirty years expire, which will bring it to that\r\naverage; for were one half the capital of a nation to revolve twice in\r\nthirty years, it would produce the same fund as if the whole revolved\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, thirty years as the average of time in which the whole\r\ncapital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will revolve once, the\r\nthirtieth part thereof will be the sum that will revolve every year,\r\nthat is, will go by deaths to new possessors; and this last sum being\r\nthus known, and the ratio per cent, to be subtracted from it determined,\r\nit will give the annual amount or income of the proposed fund, to be\r\napplied as already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the discourse of the English minister, Pitt, in his\r\nopening of what is called in England the budget, (the scheme of finance\r\nfor the year 1796,) I find an estimate of the national capital of that\r\ncountry. As this estimate of a national capital is prepared ready to my\r\nhand, I take it as a datum to act upon. When a calculation is made upon\r\nthe known capital of any nation, combined with its population, it will\r\nserve as a scale for any other nation, in proportion as its capital and\r\npopulation be more or less. I am the more disposed to take this estimate\r\nof Mr. Pitt, for the purpose of showing to that minister, upon his own\r\ncalculation, how much better money may be employed than in wasting it,\r\nas he has done, on the wild project of setting up Bourbon kings. What,\r\nin the name of heaven, are Bourbon kings to the people of England? It is\r\nbetter that the people have bread.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt states the national capital of England, real and personal,\r\nto be one thousand three hundred millions sterling, which is about\r\none-fourth part of the national capital of France, including Belgia. The\r\nevent of the last harvest in each country proves that the soil of France\r\nis more productive than that of England, and that it can better support\r\ntwenty-four or twenty-five millions of inhabitants than that of England\r\ncan seven or seven and a half millions.\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth part of this capital of 1,300,000,000L. is 43,333,333L.\r\nwhich is the part that will revolve every year by deaths in that country\r\nto new possessors; and the sum that will annually revolve in France\r\nin the proportion of four to one, will be about one hundred and\r\nseventy-three millions sterling. From this sum of 43,333,333L. annually\r\nrevolving, is to be subtracted the value of the natural inheritance\r\nabsorbed in it, which, perhaps, in fair justice, cannot be taken at\r\nless, and ought not to be taken for more, than a tenth part.\r\n\r\nIt will always happen, that of the property thus revolving by deaths\r\nevery year a part will descend in a direct line to sons and daughters,\r\nand the other part collaterally, and the proportion will be found to be\r\nabout three to one; that is, about thirty millions of the above sum will\r\ndescend to direct heirs, and the remaining sum of 13,333,333L. to more\r\ndistant relations, and in part to strangers.\r\n\r\nConsidering, then, that man is always related to society, that\r\nrelationship will become comparatively greater in proportion as the next\r\nof kin is more distant, it is therefore consistent with civilization to\r\nsay that where there are no direct heirs society shall be heir to a part\r\nover and above the tenth part due to society. If this additional part be\r\nfrom five to ten or twelve per cent., in proportion as the next of kin\r\nbe nearer or more remote, so as to average with the escheats that may\r\nfall, which ought always to go to society and not to the government\r\n(an addition of ten per cent, more), the produce from the annual sum of\r\n43,333,333L. will be:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table361]\r\n\r\nHaving thus arrived at the annual amount of the proposed fund, I come,\r\nin the next place, to speak of the population proportioned to this fund,\r\nand to compare it with the uses to which the fund is to be applied.\r\n\r\nThe population (I mean that of England) does not exceed seven millions\r\nand a half, and the number of persons above the age of fifty will in\r\nthat case be about four hundred thousand. There would not, however, be\r\nmore than that number that would accept the proposed ten pounds sterling\r\nper annum, though they would be entitled to it. I have no idea it would\r\nbe accepted by many persons who had a yearly income of two or three\r\nhundred pounds sterling. But as we often see instances of rich people\r\nfalling into sudden poverty, even at the age of sixty, they would always\r\nhave the right of drawing all the arrears due to them. Four millions,\r\ntherefore, of the above annual sum of 5,666,6667L. will be required for\r\nfour hundred thousand aged persons, at ten pounds sterling each.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak of the persons annually arriving at twenty-one years\r\nof age. If all the persons who died were above the age of twenty-one\r\nyears, the number of persons annually arriving at that age, must be\r\nequal to the annual number of deaths, to keep the population stationary.\r\nBut the greater part die under the age of twenty-one, and therefore the\r\nnumber of persons annually arriving at twenty-one will be less than half\r\nthe number of deaths. The whole number of deaths upon a population of\r\nseven millions and an half will be about 220,000 annually. The number\r\narriving at twenty-one years of age will be about 100,000. The whole\r\nnumber of these will not receive the proposed fifteen pounds, for the\r\nreasons already mentioned, though, as in the former case, they would be\r\nentitled to it. Admitting then that a tenth part declined receiving it,\r\nthe amount would stand thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table362]\r\n\r\nThere are, in every country, a number of blind and lame persons, totally\r\nincapable of earning a livelihood. But as it will always happen that the\r\ngreater number of blind persons will be among those who are above\r\nthe age of fifty years, they will be provided for in that class. The\r\nremaining sum of 316,666L. will provide for the lame and blind under\r\nthat age, at the same rate of 10L. annually for each person.\r\n\r\nHaving now gone through all the necessary calculations, and stated the\r\nparticulars of the plan, I shall conclude with some observations.\r\n\r\nIt is not charity but a right, not bounty but justice, that I am\r\npleading for. The present state of civilization is as odious as it is\r\nunjust. It is absolutely the opposite of what it should be, and it is\r\nnecessary that a revolution should be made in it.(1) The contrast of\r\naffluence and wretchedness continually meeting and offending the eye,\r\nis like dead and living bodies chained together. Though I care as little\r\nabout riches, as any man, I am a friend to riches because they are\r\ncapable of good. I care not how affluent some may be, provided that\r\nnone be miserable in consequence of it. But it is impossible to enjoy\r\naffluence with the felicity it is capable of being enjoyed, whilst so\r\nmuch misery is mingled in the scene. The sight of the misery, and the\r\nunpleasant sensations it suggests, which, though they may be suffocated\r\ncannot be extinguished, are a greater drawback upon the felicity of\r\naffluence than the proposed 10 per cent, upon property is worth. He that\r\nwould not give the one to get rid of the other has no charity, even for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n     1 This and the preceding sentence axe omitted in all\r\n     previous English and American editions.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThere are, in every country, some magnificent charities established by\r\nindividuals. It is, however, but little that any individual can do,\r\nwhen the whole extent of the misery to be relieved is considered. He may\r\nsatisfy his conscience, but not his heart. He may give all that he\r\nhas, and that all will relieve but little. It is only by organizing\r\ncivilization upon such principles as to act like a system of pullies,\r\nthat the whole weight of misery can be removed.\r\n\r\nThe plan here proposed will reach the whole. It will immediately relieve\r\nand take out of view three classes of wretchedness--the blind, the lame,\r\nand the aged poor; and it will furnish the rising generation with means\r\nto prevent their becoming poor; and it will do this without deranging\r\nor interfering with any national measures. To shew that this will be the\r\ncase, it is sufficient to observe that the operation and effect of\r\nthe plan will, in all cases, be the same as if every individual were\r\n_voluntarily_ to make his will and dispose of his property in the manner\r\nhere proposed.\r\n\r\nBut it is justice, and not charity, that is the principle of the plan.\r\nIn all great cases it is necessary to have a principle more universally\r\nactive than charity; and, with respect to justice, it ought not to be\r\nleft to the choice of detached individuals whether they will do justice\r\nor not. Considering then, the plan on the ground of justice, it ought to\r\nbe the act of the whole, growing spontaneously out of the principles of\r\nthe revolution, and the reputation of it ought to be national and not\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nA plan upon this principle would benefit the revolution by the energy\r\nthat springs from the consciousness of justice. It would multiply also\r\nthe national resources; for property, like vegetation, increases\r\nby offsets. When a young couple begin the world, the difference is\r\nexceedingly great whether they begin with nothing or with fifteen pounds\r\napiece. With this aid they could buy a cow, and implements to cultivate\r\na few acres of land; and instead of becoming burdens upon society, which\r\nis always the case where children are produced faster than they can be\r\nfed, would be put in the way of becoming useful and profitable citizens.\r\nThe national domains also would sell the better if pecuniary aids were\r\nprovided to cultivate them in small lots.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice of what has unjustly obtained the name of\r\ncivilization (and the practice merits not to be called either charity\r\nor policy) to make some provision for persons becoming poor and wretched\r\nonly at the time they become so. Would it not, even as a matter of\r\neconomy, be far better to adopt means to prevent their becoming poor?\r\nThis can best be done by making every person when arrived at the age\r\nof twenty-one years an inheritor of something to begin with. The rugged\r\nface of society, chequered with the extremes of affluence and want,\r\nproves that some extraordinary violence has been committed upon it,\r\nand calls on justice for redress. The great mass of the poor in all\r\ncountries are become an hereditary race, and it is next to impossible\r\nfor them to get cut of that state of themselves. It ought also to be\r\nobserved that this mass increases in all countries that are called\r\ncivilized. More persons fall annually into it than get out of it.\r\n\r\nThough in a plan of which justice and humanity are the\r\nfoundation-principles, interest ought not to be admitted into the\r\ncalculation, yet it is always of advantage to the establishment of any\r\nplan to shew that it is beneficial as a matter of interest. The success\r\nof any proposed plan submitted to public consideration must finally\r\ndepend on the numbers interested in supporting it, united with the\r\njustice of its principles.\r\n\r\nThe plan here proposed will benefit all, without injuring any. It will\r\nconsolidate the interest of the Republic with that of the individual.\r\nTo the numerous class dispossessed of their natural inheritance by the\r\nsystem of landed property it will be an act of national justice. To\r\npersons dying possessed of moderate fortunes it will operate as a\r\ntontine to their children, more beneficial than the sum of money paid\r\ninto the fund: and it will give to the accumulation of riches a degree\r\nof security that none of the old governments of Europe, now tottering on\r\ntheir foundations, can give.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that more than one family in ten, in any of the\r\ncountries of Europe, has, when the head of the family dies, a clear\r\nproperty left of five hundred pounds sterling. To all such the plan is\r\nadvantageous. That property would pay fifty pounds into the fund, and if\r\nthere were only two children under age they would receive fifteen pounds\r\neach, (thirty pounds,) on coming of age, and be entitled to ten pounds\r\na-year after fifty. It is from the overgrown acquisition of property\r\nthat the fund will support itself; and I know that the possessors of\r\nsuch property in England, though they would eventually be benefited by\r\nthe protection of nine-tenths of it, will exclaim against the plan. But\r\nwithout entering into any inquiry how they came by that property, let\r\nthem recollect that they have been the advocates of this war, and that\r\nMr. Pitt has already laid on more new taxes to be raised annually upon\r\nthe people of England, and that for supporting the despotism of Austria\r\nand the Bourbons against the liberties of France, than would pay\r\nannually all the sums proposed in this plan.\r\n\r\nI have made the calculations stated in this plan, upon what is called\r\npersonal, as well as upon landed property. The reason for making it upon\r\nland is already explained; and the reason for taking personal property\r\ninto the calculation is equally well founded though on a different\r\nprinciple. Land, as before said, is the free gift of the Creator in\r\ncommon to the human race. Personal property is the effect of society;\r\nand it is as impossible for an individual to acquire personal property\r\nwithout the aid of society, as it is for him to make land originally.\r\nSeparate an individual from society, and give him an island or a\r\ncontinent to possess, and he cannot acquire personal property. He cannot\r\nbe rich. So inseparably are the means connected with the end, in all\r\ncases, that where the former do not exist the latter cannot be obtained.\r\nAll accumulation, therefore, of personal property, beyond what a man's\r\nown hands produce, is derived to him by living in society; and he owes\r\non every principle of justice, of gratitude, and of civilization, a part\r\nof that accumulation back again to society from whence the whole came.\r\nThis is putting the matter on a general principle, and perhaps it is\r\nbest to do so; for if we examine the case minutely it will be found that\r\nthe accumulation of personal property is, in many instances, the effect\r\nof paying too little for the labour that produced it; the consequence\r\nof which is, that the working hand perishes in old age, and the employer\r\nabounds in affluence. It is, perhaps, impossible to proportion exactly\r\nthe price of labour to the profits it produces; and it will also be\r\nsaid, as an apology for the injustice, that were a workman to receive\r\nan increase of wages daily he would not save it against old age, nor be\r\nmuch bet-ter for it in the interim. Make, then, society the treasurer to\r\nguard it for him in a common fund; for it is no reason, that because he\r\nmight not make a good use of it for himself, another should take it.\r\n\r\nThe state of civilization that has prevailed throughout Europe, is as\r\nunjust in its principle, as it is horrid in its effects; and it is the\r\nconsciousness of this, and the apprehension that such a state cannot\r\ncontinue when once investigation begins in any country, that makes\r\nthe possessors of property dread every idea of a revolution. It is the\r\nhazard and not the principle of revolutions that retards their progress.\r\nThis being the case, it is necessary as well for the protection of\r\nproperty, as for the sake of justice and humanity, to form a system\r\nthat, whilst it preserves one part of society from wretchedness, shall\r\nsecure the other from depredation.\r\n\r\nThe superstitious awe, the enslaving reverence, that formerly surrounded\r\naffluence, is passing away in all countries, and leaving the possessor\r\nof property to the convulsion of accidents. When wealth and splendour,\r\ninstead of fascinating the multitude, excite emotions of disgust; when,\r\ninstead of drawing forth admiration, it is beheld as an insult upon\r\nwretchedness; when the ostentatious appearance it makes serves to call\r\nthe right of it in question, the case of property becomes critical, and\r\nit is only in a system of justice that the possessor can contemplate\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nTo remove the danger, it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and\r\nthis can only be done by making property productive of a national\r\nblessing, extending to every individual. When the riches of one man\r\nabove another shall increase the national fund in the same proportion;\r\nwhen it shall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the\r\nprosperity of individuals; when the more riches a man acquires, the\r\nbetter it shall be for the general mass; it is then that antipathies\r\nwill cease, and property be placed on the permanent basis of national\r\ninterest and protection.\r\n\r\nI have no property in France to become subject to the plan I propose.\r\nWhat I have which is not much, is in the United States of America. But\r\nI will pay one hundred pounds sterling towards this fund in rance, the\r\ninstant it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England\r\nwhenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country.\r\n\r\nA revolution in the state of civilization is the necessary companion of\r\nrevolutions in the system of government. If a revolution in any country\r\nbe from bad to good, or from good to bad, the state of what is called\r\ncivilization in that country, must be made conformable thereto, to give\r\nthat revolution effect. Despotic government supports itself by abject\r\ncivilization, in which debasement of the human mind, and wretchedness\r\nin the mass of the people, are the chief enterions. Such governments\r\nconsider man merely as an animal; that the exercise of intellectual\r\nfaculty is not his privilege; _that he has nothing to do with the laws\r\nbut to obey them _; (*) and they politically depend more upon breaking\r\nthe spirit of the people by poverty, than they fear enraging it by\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n     * Expression of Horsley, an English bishop, in the English\r\n     parliament.--Author.\r\n\r\nIt is a revolution in the state of civilization that will give\r\nperfection to the revolution of France. Already the conviction that\r\ngovernment by representation is the true system of government is\r\nspreading itself fast in the world. The reasonableness of it can be seen\r\nby all. The justness of it makes itself felt even by its opposers. But\r\nwhen a system of civilization, growing out of that system of government,\r\nshall be so organized that not a man or woman born in the Republic but\r\nshall inherit some means of beginning the world, and see before them\r\nthe certainty of escaping the miseries that under other governments\r\naccompany old age, the revolution of France will have an advocate and an\r\nally in the heart of all nations.\r\n\r\nAn army of principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot;\r\nit will succeed where diplomatic management would fail: it is neither\r\nthe Rhine, the Channel, nor the Ocean that can arrest its progress: it\r\nwill march on the horizon of the world, and it will conquer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS FOR CARRYING THE PROPOSED PLAN INTO EXECUTION,\r\n\r\nAND TO RENDER IT AT THE SAME TIME CONDUCIVE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nI. Each canton shall elect in its primary assemblies, three persons,\r\nas commissioners for that canton, who shall take cognizance, and keep\r\na register of all matters happening in that canton, conformable to the\r\ncharter that shall be established by law for carrying this plan into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nII. The law shall fix the manner in which the property of deceased\r\npersons shall be ascertained.\r\n\r\nIII. When the amount of the property of any deceased person shall be\r\nascertained, the principal heir to that property, or the eldest of the\r\nco-heirs, if of lawful age, or if under age the person authorized by the\r\nwill of the deceased to represent him or them, shall give bond to the\r\ncommissioners of the canton to pay the said tenth part thereof in four\r\nequal quarterly payments, within the space of one year or sooner, at the\r\nchoice of the payers. One half of the whole property shall remain as a\r\nsecurity until the bond be paid off.\r\n\r\nIV. The bond shall be registered in the office of the commissioners of\r\nthe canton, and the original bonds shall be deposited in the national\r\nbank at Paris. The bank shall publish every quarter of a year the amount\r\nof the bonds in its possession, and also the bonds that shall have been\r\npaid off, or what parts thereof, since the last quarterly publication.\r\n\r\nV. The national bank shall issue bank notes upon the security of the\r\nbonds in its possession. The notes so issued, shall be applied to pay\r\nthe pensions of aged persons, and the compensations to persons arriving\r\nat twenty-one years of age. It is both reasonable and generous to\r\nsuppose, that persons not under immediate necessity, will suspend their\r\nright of drawing on the fund, until it acquire, as it will do, a greater\r\ndegree of ability. In this case, it is proposed, that an honorary\r\nregister be kept, in each canton, of the names of the persons thus\r\nsuspending that right, at least during the present war.\r\n\r\nVI. As the inheritors of property must always take up their bonds in\r\nfour quarterly payments, or sooner if they choose, there will always\r\nbe _numéraire_ [cash] arriving at the bank after the expiration of the\r\nfirst quarter, to exchange for the bank notes that shall be brought in.\r\n\r\nVII. The bank notes being thus put in circulation, upon the best of all\r\npossible security, that of actual property, to more than four times\r\nthe amount of the bonds upon which the notes are issued, and with\r\n_numéraire_ continually arriving at the bank to exchange or pay them off\r\nwhenever they shall be presented for that purpose, they will acquire\r\na permanent value in all parts of the Republic. They can therefore be\r\nreceived in payment of taxes, or emprunts equal to numéraire, because\r\nthe government can always receive numéraire for them at the bank.\r\n\r\nVIII. It will be necessary that the payments of the ten per cent, be\r\nmade in numeraire for the first year from the establishment of the plan.\r\nBut after the expiration of the first year, the inheritors of property\r\nmay pay ten per cent either in bank notes issued upon the fund, or in\r\nnumeraire, If the payments be in numeraire, it will lie as a deposit at\r\nthe bank, to be exchanged for a quantity of notes equal to that amount;\r\nand if in notes issued upon the fund, it will cause a demand upon the\r\nfund, equal thereto; and thus the operation of the plan will create\r\nmeans to carry itself into execution.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. THE EIGHTEENTH FRUCTIDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of France and the French Armies (1)\r\n\r\n     1 This pamphlet was written between the defeat of Pichegru's\r\n     attempt, September 4, 1794, and November 12, of the same\r\n     year, the date of the Bien-informé in which the publication\r\n     is noticed. General Pichegra (Charles), (1761-1804) having\r\n     joined a royalist conspiracy against the Republic, was\r\n     banished to Cayenne (1797), whence he escaped to England;\r\n     having returned to Paris (1804) he was imprisoned in the\r\n     Temple, and there found strangled by a silk handkerchief,\r\n     whether by his own or another's act remaining doubtful.\r\n     --Editor.\r\n\r\nWhen an extraordinary measure, not warranted by established\r\nconstitutional rules, and justifiable only on the supreme law of\r\nabsolute necessity, bursts suddenly upon us, we must, in order to form\r\na true judgment thereon, carry our researches back to the times that\r\npreceded and occasioned it. Taking up then the subject with respect to\r\nthe event of the Eighteenth of Fructidor on this ground, I go to examine\r\nthe state of things prior to that period. I begin with the establishment\r\nof the constitution of the year 3 of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nA better _organized_ constitution has never yet been devised by human\r\nwisdom. It is, in its organization, free from all the vices and defects\r\nto which other forms of government are more or less subject. I will\r\nspeak first of the legislative body, because the Legislature is, in the\r\nnatural order of things, the first power; the Executive is the first\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nBy arranging the legislative body into two divisions, as is done in the\r\nFrench Constitution, the one, (the Council of Five Hundred,) whose part\r\nit is to conceive and propose laws; the other, a Council of Ancients, to\r\nreview, approve, or reject the laws proposed; all the security is given\r\nthat can arise from coolness of reflection acting upon, or correcting\r\nthe precipitancy or enthusiasm of conception and imagination. It is\r\nseldom that our first thought, even upon any subject, is sufficiently\r\njust.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 For Paine's ideas on the right division of representatives\r\n     into two chambers, which differ essentially from any\r\n     bicameral system ever adopted, see vol. ii., p. 444 of this\r\n     work; also, in the present volume, Chapter XXXIV.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nThe policy of renewing the Legislature by a third part each year, though\r\nnot entirely new, either in theory or in practice, is nevertheless one\r\nof the modern improvements in the science of government. It prevents,\r\non the one hand, that convulsion and precipitate change of measures\r\ninto which a nation might be surprised by the going out of the whole\r\nLegislature at the same time, and the instantaneous election of a new\r\none; on the other hand, it excludes that common interest from taking\r\nplace that might tempt a whole Legislature, whose term of duration\r\nexpired at once, to usurp the right of continuance. I go now to speak of\r\nthe Executive.\r\n\r\nIt is a principle uncontrovertible by reason, that each of the parts\r\nby which government is composed, should be so constructed as to be in\r\nperpetual maturity. We should laugh at the idea of a Council of Five\r\nHundred, or a Council of Ancients, or a Parliament, or any national\r\nassembly, who should be all children in leading strings and in the\r\ncradle, or be all sick, insane, deaf, dumb, lame or blind, at the same\r\ntime, or be all upon crutches, tottering with age or infirmities. Any\r\nform of government that was so constructed as to admit the possibility\r\nof such cases happening to a whole Legislature would justly be the\r\nridicule of the world; and on a parity of reasoning, it is equally as\r\nridiculous that the same cases should happen in that part of government\r\nwhich is called the Executive; yet this is the contemptible condition to\r\nwhich an Executive is always subject, and which is often happening,\r\nwhen it is placed in an hereditary individual called a king. When\r\nthat individual is in either of the cases before mentioned, the whole\r\nExecutive is in the same case; for himself is the whole. He is then (as\r\nan Executive) the ridiculous picture of what a Legislature would be if\r\nall its members were in the same case. The one is a whole made up of\r\nparts, the other a whole without parts; and anything happening to the\r\none, (as a part or sec-tion of the government,) is parallel to the same\r\nthing happening to the other.\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, an hereditary executive called a king is a perfect\r\nabsurdity in itself, any attachment to it is equally as absurd. It is\r\nneither instinct or reason; and if this attachment is what is called\r\nroyalism in France, then is a royalist inferior in character to every\r\nspecies of the animal world; for what can that being be who acts neither\r\nby instinct nor by reason? Such a being merits rather our derision\r\nthan our pity; and it is only when it assumes to act its folly that it\r\nbecomes capable of provoking republican indignation. In every other\r\ncase it is too contemptible to excite anger. For my own part, when I\r\ncontemplate the self-evident absurdity of the thing, I can scarcely\r\npermit myself to believe that there exists in the high-minded nation of\r\nFrance such a mean and silly animal as a royalist.\r\n\r\nAs it requires but a single glance of thought to see (as is before said)\r\nthat all the parts of which government is composed must be at all times\r\nin a state of full maturity, it was not possible that men acting under\r\nthe influence of reason, could, in forming a Constitution, admit an\r\nhereditary Executive, any more than an hereditary Legislature. I go\r\ntherefore to examine the other cases.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, (rejecting the hereditary system,) shall the\r\nExecutive by election be an _individual or a plurality_.\r\n\r\nAn individual by election is almost as bad as the hereditary system,\r\nexcept that there is always a better chance of not having an idiot. But\r\nhe will never be any thing more than a chief of a party, and none but\r\nthose of that party will have access to him. He will have no person\r\nto consult with of a standing equal with himself, and consequently be\r\ndeprived of the advantages arising from equal discussion.\r\n\r\nThose whom he admits in consultation will be ministers of his own\r\nappointment, who, if they displease by their advice, must expect to\r\nbe dismissed. The authority also is too great, and the business too\r\ncomplicated, to be intrusted to the ambition or the judgment of an\r\nindividual; and besides these cases, the sudden change of measures\r\nthat might follow by the going out of an individual Executive, and the\r\nelection of a new one, would hold the affairs of a nation in a state of\r\nperpetual uncertainty. We come then to the case of a plural Executive.\r\n\r\nIt must be sufficiently plural, to give opportunity to discuss all the\r\nvarious subjects that in the course of national business may come before\r\nit; and yet not so numerous as to endanger the necessary secrecy that\r\ncertain cases, such as those of war, require.\r\n\r\nEstablishing, then, plurality as a principle, the only question is, What\r\nshall be the number of that plurality?\r\n\r\nThree are too few either for the variety or the quantity of business.\r\nThe Constitution has adopted five; and experience has shewn, from the\r\ncommencement of the Constitution to the time of the election of the new\r\nlegislative third, that this number of Directors, when well chosen, is\r\nsufficient for all national executive purposes; and therefore a greater\r\nnumber would be only an unnecessary expence. That the measures of the\r\nDirectory during that period were well concerted is proved by their\r\nsuccess; and their being well concerted shews they were well discussed;\r\nand, therefore, that five is a sufficient number with respect to\r\ndiscussion; and, on the other hand, the secret, whenever there was\r\none, (as in the case of the expedition to Ireland,) was well kept, and\r\ntherefore the number is not too great to endanger the necessary secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the two Councils are numerous is not from the necessity\r\nof their being so, on account of business, but because that every\r\npart of the republic shall find and feel itself in the national\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nNext to the general principle of government by representation, the\r\nexcellence of the French Constitution consists in providing means to\r\nprevent that abuse of power that might arise by letting it remain too\r\nlong in the same hands. This wise precaution pervades every part of the\r\nConstitution. Not only the legislature is renewable by a third every\r\nyear, but the president of each of the Councils is renewable every\r\nmonth; and of the Directory, one member each year, and its president\r\nevery three months. Those who formed the Constitution cannot be accused\r\nof having contrived for themselves. The Constitution, in this respect,\r\nis as impartially constructed as if those who framed it were to die as\r\nsoon as they had finished their work.\r\n\r\nThe only defect in the Constitution is that of having narrowed the right\r\nof suffrage; and it is in a great measure due to this narrowing the\r\nright, that the last elections have not generally been good. My former\r\ncolleagues will, I presume, pardon my saying this to day, when they\r\nrecollect my arguments against this defect, at the time the Constitution\r\nwas discussed in the Convention.(1)\r\n\r\n     1  See Chapters XXIV. and XXV., also the letter prefaced to\r\n     XXVIII., in this volume.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nI will close this part of the subject by remarking on one of the most\r\nvulgar and absurd sayings or dogmas that ever yet imposed itself upon\r\nthe world, which is, \"_that a Republic is fit only for a small country,\r\nand a Monarchy for a large one_.\" Ask those who say this their reasons\r\nwhy it is so, and they can give none.\r\n\r\nLet us then examine the case. If the quantity of knowledge in a\r\ngovernment ought to be proportioned to the extent of a country, and\r\nthe magnitude and variety of its affairs, it follows, as an undeniable\r\nresult, that this absurd dogma is false, and that the reverse of it is\r\ntrue. As to what is called Monarchy, if it be adaptable to any country\r\nit can only be so to a small one, whose concerns are few, little\r\ncomplicated, and all within the comprehension of an individual. But when\r\nwe come to a country of large extent, vast population, and whose affairs\r\nare great, numerous, and various, it is the representative republican\r\nsystem only, that can collect into the government the quantity\r\nof knowledge necessary to govern to the best national advantage.\r\nMontesquieu, who was strongly inclined to republican government,\r\nsheltered himself under this absurd dogma; for he had always the\r\nBastile before his eyes when he was speaking of Republics, and therefore\r\n_pretended_ not to write for France. Condorcet governed himself by\r\nthe same caution, but it was caution only, for no sooner had he the\r\nopportunity of speaking fully out than he did it. When I say this of\r\nCondorcet, I know it as a fact. In a paper published in Paris, July,\r\n1791, entitled, \"_The Republican, or the Defender of Representative\r\nGovernment?_\" is a piece signed _Thomas Paine_.(1) That piece was\r\nconcerted between Condorcet and myself. I wrote the original in\r\nEnglish, and Condorcet translated it. The object of it was to expose the\r\nabsurdity and falsehood of the above mentioned dogma.\r\n\r\n     1 Chapter II. of this volume. See also my \"Life of Paine,\"\r\n     vol. i., p. 311.--Editor.\r\n\r\nHaving thus concisely glanced at the excellencies of the Constitution,\r\nand the superiority of the representative system of government over\r\nevery other system, (if any other can be called a system,) I come to\r\nspeak of the circumstances that have intervened between the time the\r\nConstitution was established and the event that took place on the 18th\r\nof Fructidor of the present year.\r\n\r\nAlmost as suddenly as the morning light dissipates darkness, did the\r\nestablishment of the Constitution change the face of affairs in France.\r\nSecurity succeeded to terror, prosperity to distress, plenty to famine,\r\nand confidence increased as the days multiplied, until the coming of the\r\nnew third. A series of victories unequalled in the world, followed\r\neach other, almost too rapidly to be counted, and too numerous to be\r\nremembered. The Coalition, every where defeated and confounded, crumbled\r\naway like a ball of dust in the hand of a giant. Every thing, during\r\nthat period, was acted on such a mighty scale that reality appeared a\r\ndream, and truth outstript romance. It may figuratively be said, that\r\nthe Rhine and the Rubicon (Germany and Italy) replied in triumphs to\r\neach other, and the echoing Alps prolonged the shout. I will not\r\nhere dishonour a great description by noticing too much the English\r\ngovernment. It is sufficient to say paradoxically, that in the magnitude\r\nof its littleness it cringed, it intrigued, and sought protection in\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nThough the achievements of these days might give trophies to a nation\r\nand laurels to its heroes, they derive their full radiance of glory\r\nfrom the principle they inspired and the object they accomplished.\r\nDesolation, chains, and slavery had marked the progress of former wars,\r\nbut to conquer for Liberty had never been thought of. To receive\r\nthe degrading submission of a distressed and subjugated people, and\r\ninsultingly permit them to live, made the chief triumph of former\r\nconquerors; but to receive them with fraternity, to break their chains,\r\nto tell them they are free, and teach them to be so, make a new volume\r\nin the history of man.\r\n\r\nAmidst those national honours, and when only two enemies remained, both\r\nof whom had solicited peace, and one of them had signed preliminaries,\r\nthe election of the new third commenced. Every thing was made easy to\r\nthem. All difficulties had been conquered before they arrived at the\r\ngovernment. They came in the olive days of the revolution, and all they\r\nhad to do was not to do mischief.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not difficult to foresee, that the elections would not\r\nbe generally good. The horrid days of Robespierre were still remembered,\r\nand the gratitude due to those who had put an end to them was forgotten.\r\n\r\nThousands who, by passive approbation during that tremendous scene, had\r\nexperienced no suffering, assumed the merit of being the loudest against\r\nit. Their cowardice in not opposing it, became courage when it was over.\r\nThey exclaimed against Terrorism as if they had been the heroes that\r\noverthrew it, and rendered themselves ridiculous by fantastically\r\noveracting moderation. The most noisy of this class, that I have met\r\nwith, are those who suffered nothing. They became all things, at all\r\ntimes, to all men; till at last they laughed at principle. It was the\r\nreal republicans who suffered most during the time of Robespierre. The\r\npersecution began upon them on the 31st of May, 1793, and ceased only\r\nby the exertions of the remnant that survived.\r\n\r\nIn such a confused state of things as preceded the late elections the\r\npublic mind was put into a condition of being easily deceived; and it\r\nwas almost natural that the hypocrite would stand the best chance of\r\nbeing elected into the new third. Had those who, since their election,\r\nhave thrown the public affairs into confusion by counter-revolutionary\r\nmeasures, declared themselves beforehand, they would have been denounced\r\ninstead of being chosen. Deception was necessary to their success.\r\nThe Constitution obtained a full establishment; the revolution was\r\nconsidered as complete; and the war on the eve of termination. In such a\r\nsituation, the mass of the people, fatigued by a long revolution, sought\r\nrepose; and in their elections they looked out for quiet men. They\r\nunfortunately found hypocrites. Would any of the primary assemblies\r\nhave voted for a civil war? Certainly they would not. But the electoral\r\nassemblies of some departments have chosen men whose measures, since\r\ntheir election, tended to no other end but to provoke it. Either those\r\nelectors have deceived their constituents of the primary assemblies, or\r\nthey have been themselves deceived in the choice they made of deputies.\r\n\r\nThat there were some direct but secret conspirators in the new third can\r\nscarcely admit of a doubt; but it is most reasonable to suppose that a\r\ngreat part were seduced by the vanity of thinking they could do better\r\nthan those whom they succeeded. Instead of trusting to experience, they\r\nattempted experiments. This counter-disposition prepared them to fall in\r\nwith any measures contrary to former measures, and that without seeing,\r\nand probably without suspecting, the end to which they led.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the members of the new third arrived at the seat of\r\ngovernment, than expectation was excited to see how they would act.\r\nTheir motions were watched by all parties, and it was impossible for\r\nthem to steal a march unobserved. They had it in their power to do great\r\ngood, or great mischief. A firm and manly conduct on their part, uniting\r\nwith that of the Directory and their colleagues, would have terminated\r\nthe war. But the moment before them was not the moment of hesitation. He\r\nthat hesitates in such situation is lost.\r\n\r\nThe first public act of the Council of Five Hundred was the election of\r\nPichegru to the presidency of that Council. He arrived at it by a very\r\nlarge majority, and the public voice was in his favour. I among the rest\r\nwas one who rejoiced at it. But if the defection of Pichegru was at that\r\ntime known to Condé, and consequently to Pitt, it unveils the cause that\r\nretarded all negotiations for peace.(1) They interpreted that election\r\ninto a signal of a counter-revolution, and were waiting for it; and they\r\nmistook the respect shown to Pichegru, founded on the supposition of his\r\nintegrity, as a symptom of national revolt. Judging of things by their\r\nown foolish ideas of government, they ascribed appearances to causes\r\nbetween which there was no connection. Every thing on their part has\r\nbeen a comedy of errors, and the actors have been chased from the stage.\r\n\r\n     1 Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé (1736-1818),\r\n     organized the French emigrants on the Rhine into an army\r\n     which was incorporated with that of Austria but paid by\r\n     England. He converted Pichegru into a secret partisan of the\r\n     Bourbons. He ultimately returned to France with Louis\r\n     XVIII., who made him colonel of infantry and master of the\r\n     royal household.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nTwo or three decades of the new sessions passed away without any\r\nthing very material taking place; but matters soon began to explain\r\nthemselves. The first thing that struck the public mind was, that no\r\nmore was heard of negotiations for peace, and that public business stood\r\nstill. It was not the object of the conspirators that there should be\r\npeace; but as it was necessary to conceal their object, the Constitution\r\nwas ransacked to find pretences for delays. In vain did the Directory\r\nexplain to them the state of the finances and the wants of the army. The\r\ncommittee, charged with that business, trifled away its time by a series\r\nof unproductive reports, and continued to sit only to produce more.\r\nEvery thing necessary to be done was neglected, and every thing improper\r\nwas attempted. Pichegru occupied himself about forming a national guard\r\nfor the Councils--the suspicious signal of war,--Camille Jordan about\r\npriests and bells, and the emigrants, with whom he had associated\r\nduring the two years he was in England.1 Willot and Delarue attacked the\r\nDirectory: their object was to displace some one of the directors, to\r\nget in another of their own. Their motives with respect to the age of\r\nBarras (who is as old as he wishes to be, and has been a little too old\r\nfor them) were too obvious not to be seen through.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine's pamphlet, addressed to Jordan, deals mainly with\r\n     religions matters, and is reserved for oar fourth volume.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n     2 Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras (1755-1899) was\r\n     President of the Directory at this time, 1797.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nIn this suspensive state of things, the public mind, filled with\r\napprehensions, became agitated, and without knowing what it might be,\r\nlooked for some extraordinary event. It saw, for it could not avoid\r\nseeing, that things could not remain long in the state they were in,\r\nbut it dreaded a convulsion. That spirit of triflingness which it\r\nhad indulged too freely when in a state of security, and which it is\r\nprobable the new agents had interpreted into indifference about the\r\nsuccess of the Republic, assumed a serious aspect that afforded to\r\nconspiracy no hope of aid; but still it went on. It plunged itself into\r\nnew measures with the same ill success, and the further it went the\r\nfurther the public mind retired. The conspiracy saw nothing around it to\r\ngive it encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe obstinacy, however, with which it persevered in its repeated\r\nattacks upon the Directory, in framing laws in favour of emigrants and\r\nrefractory priests, and in every thing inconsistent with the immediate\r\nsafety of the Republic, and which served to encourage the enemy to\r\nprolong the war, admitted of no other direct interpretation than that\r\nsomething was rotten in the Council of Five Hundred. The evidence of\r\ncircumstances became every day too visible not to be seen, and too\r\nstrong to be explained away. Even as errors, (to say no worse of\r\nthem,) they are not entitled to apology; for where knowledge is a duty,\r\nignorance is a crime.\r\n\r\nThe more serious republicans, who had better opportunities than the\r\ngenerality had, of knowing the state of politics, began to take\r\nthe alarm, and formed themselves into a Society, by the name of the\r\nConstitutional Club. It is the only Society of which I have been a\r\nmember in France; and I went to this because it was become necessary\r\nthat the friends of the Republic should rally round the standard of\r\nthe constitution. I met there several of the original patriots of the\r\nrevolution; I do not mean of the last order of Jacobins, but of the\r\nfirst of that name. The faction in the Council of Five Hundred,\r\nwho, finding no counsel from the public, began to be frightened at\r\nappearances, fortified itself against the dread of this Society, by\r\npassing a law to dissolve it. The constitutionality of the law was at\r\nleast doubtful: but the Society, that it might not give the example of\r\nexasperating matters already too much inflamed, suspended its meetings.\r\n\r\nA matter, however, of much greater moment soon after presented itself.\r\nIt was the march of four regiments, some of whom, in the line of their\r\nroute, had to pass within about twelve leagues of Paris, which is the\r\nboundary the Constitution had fixed as the distance of any armed\r\nforce from the legislative body. In another state of things, such a\r\ncircumstance would not have been noticed. But conspiracy is quick of\r\nsuspicion, and the fear which the faction in the Council of Five\r\nHundred manifested upon this occasion could not have suggested itself\r\nto innocent men; neither would innocent men have expostulated with the\r\nDirectory upon the case, in the manner these men did. The question they\r\nurged went to extort from the Directory, and to make known to the enemy,\r\nwhat the destination of the troops was. The leaders of the faction\r\nconceived that the troops were marching against them; and the conduct\r\nthey adopted in consequence of it was sufficient to justify the measure,\r\neven if it had been so. From what other motive than the consciousness of\r\ntheir own designs could they have fear? The troops, in every instance,\r\nhad been the gallant defenders of the Republic, and the openly declared\r\nfriends of the Constitution; the Directory had been the same, and if the\r\nfaction were not of a different description neither fear nor suspicion\r\ncould have had place among them.\r\n\r\nAll those manouvres in the Council were acted under the most\r\nprofessional attachment to the Constitution; and this as necessarily\r\nserved to enfeeble their projects. It is exceedingly difficult, and next\r\nto impossible, to conduct a conspiracy, and still more so to give it\r\nsuccess, in a popular government. The disguised and feigned pretences\r\nwhich men in such cases are obliged to act in the face of the public,\r\nsuppress the action of the faculties, and give even to natural courage\r\nthe features of timidity. They are not half the men they would be where\r\nno disguise is necessary. It is impossible to be a hypocrite and to be\r\nbrave at the same instant.\r\n\r\nThe faction, by the imprudence of its measures, upon the march of\r\nthe troops, and upon the declarations of the officers and soldiers to\r\nsupport the Republic and the Constitution against all open or concealed\r\nattempts to overturn them, had gotten itself involved with the army, and\r\nin effect declared itself a party against it. On the one hand, laws were\r\nproposed to admit emigrants and refractory priests as free citizens; and\r\non the other hand to exclude the troops from Paris, and to punish the\r\nsoldiers who had declared to support the Republic In the mean time all\r\nnegociations for peace went backward; and the enemy, still recruiting\r\nits forces, rested to take advantage of circumstances. Excepting the\r\nabsence of hostilities, it was a state worse than war.\r\n\r\nIf all this was not a conspiracy, it had at least the features of one,\r\nand was pregnant with the same mischiefs. The eyes of the faction could\r\nnot avoid being open to the dangers to which it obstinately exposed\r\nthe Republic; yet still it persisted. During this scene, the journals\r\ndevoted to the faction were repeatedly announcing the near approach of\r\npeace with Austria and with England, and often asserting that it was\r\nconcluded. This falsehood could be intended for no other purpose than to\r\nkeep the eyes of the people shut against the dangers to which they were\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nTaking all circumstances together, it was impossible that such a state\r\nof things could continue long; and at length it was resolved to bring it\r\nto an issue. There is good reason to believe that the affair of the\r\n18th Fructidor (September 4) was intended to have taken place two days\r\nbefore; but on recollecting that it was the 2d of September, a day\r\nmournful in the annals of the revolution, it was postponed. When the\r\nissue arrived, the faction found to its cost it had no party among the\r\npublic. It had sought its own disasters, and was left to suffer the\r\nconsequences. Foreign enemies, as well as those of the interior, if\r\nany such there be, ought to see in the event of this day that all\r\nexpectation of aid from any part of the public in support of a counter\r\nrevolution is delusion. In a state of security the thoughtless, who\r\ntrembled at terror, may laugh at principles of Liberty (for they have\r\nlaughed) but it is one thing to indulge a foolish laugh, quite another\r\nthing to surrender Liberty.\r\n\r\nConsidering the event of the 18th Fructidor in a political light, it is\r\none of those that are justifiable only on the supreme law of absolute\r\nnecessity, and it is the necessity abstracted from the event that is to\r\nbe deplored. The event itself is matter of joy. Whether the manouvres in\r\nthe Council of Five Hundred were the conspiracy of a few, aided l>y the\r\nperverseness of many, or whether it had a deeper root, the dangers were\r\nthe same. It was impossible to go on. Every thing was at stake, and\r\nall national business at a stand. The case reduced itself to a simple\r\nalternative--shall the Republic be destroyed by the darksome manouvres\r\n-of a faction, or shall it be preserved by an exceptional act?\r\n\r\nDuring the American Revolution, and that after the State constitutions\r\nwere established, particular cases arose that rendered it necessary to\r\nact in a manner that would have been treasonable in a state of peace. At\r\none time Congress invested General Washington with dictatorial power.\r\nAt another time the Government of Pennsylvania suspended itself and\r\ndeclared martial law. It was the necessity of the times only that\r\nmade the apology of those extraordinary measures. But who was it that\r\nproduced the necessity of an extraordinary measure in France? A faction,\r\nand that in the face of prosperity and success. Its conduct is without\r\napology; and it is on the faction only that the exceptional measure has\r\nfallen. The public has suffered no inconvenience. If there are some men\r\nmore disposed than others not to act severely, I have a right to place\r\nmyself in that class; the whole of my political life invariably proves\r\nit; yet I cannot see, taking all parts of the case together, what else,\r\nor what better, could have been done, than has been done. It was a\r\ngreat stroke, applied in a great crisis, that crushed in an instant,\r\nand without the loss of a life, all the hopes of the enemy, and restored\r\ntranquillity to the interior.\r\n\r\nThe event was ushered in by the discharge of two cannon at four in the\r\nmorning, and was the only noise that was heard throughout the day. It\r\nnaturally excited a movement among the Parisians to enquire the cause.\r\nThey soon learned it, and the countenance they carried was easy to be\r\ninterpreted. It was that of a people who, for some time past, had\r\nbeen oppressed with apprehensions of some direful event, and who felt\r\nthemselves suddenly relieved, by finding what it was. Every one went\r\nabout his business, or followed his curiosity in quietude. It resembled\r\nthe cheerful tranquillity of the day when Louis XVI. absconded in 1791,\r\nand like that day it served to open the eyes of the nation.\r\n\r\nIf we take a review of the various events, as well conspiracies as\r\ncommotions, that have succeeded each other in this revolution, we shall\r\nsee how the former have wasted consumptively away, and the consequences\r\nof the latter have softened. The 31st May and its consequences were\r\nterrible. That of the 9th and 10th Thermidor, though glorious for the\r\nrepublic, as it overthrew one of the most horrid and cruel despotisms\r\nthat ever raged, was nevertheless marked with many circumstances\r\nof severe and continued retaliation. The commotions of Germinal and\r\nPrairial of the year 3, and of Vendemaire of the year 4, were many\r\ndegrees below those that preceded them, and affected but a small part of\r\nthe public. This of Pichegru and his associates has been crushed in an\r\ninstant, without the stain of blood, and without involving the public in\r\nthe least inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThese events taken in a series, mark the progress of the Republic from\r\ndisorder to stability. The contrary of this is the case in all parts\r\nof the British dominions. There, commotions are on an ascending scale;\r\nevery one is higher than the former. That of the sailors had nearly\r\nbeen the overthrow of the government. But the most potent of all is the\r\ninvisible commotion in the Bank. It works with the silence of time, and\r\nthe certainty of death. Every thing happening in France is curable; but\r\nthis is beyond the reach of nature or invention.\r\n\r\nLeaving the event of the 18th Fructidor to justify itself by the\r\nnecessity that occasioned it, and glorify itself by the happiness of\r\nits consequences, I come to cast a coup-d'oil on the present state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nWe have seen by the lingering condition of the negociations for peace,\r\nthat nothing was to be expected from them, in the situation that things\r\nstood prior to the 18th Fructidor. The armies had done wonders, but\r\nthose wonders were rendered unproductive by the wretched manouvres of a\r\nfaction. New exertions are now necessary to repair the mischiefs which\r\nthat faction has done. The electoral bodies, in some Departments, who\r\nby an injudicious choice, or a corrupt influence, have sent improper\r\ndeputies to the Legislature, have some atonement to make to their\r\ncountry. The evil originated with them, and the least they can do is to\r\nbe among the foremost to repair it.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in vain to lament an evil that is past. There is neither\r\nmanhood nor policy in grief; and it often happens that an error in\r\npolitics, like an error in war, admits of being turned to greater\r\nadvantage than if it had not occurred. The enemy, encouraged by that\r\nerror, presumes too much, and becomes doubly foiled by the re-action.\r\nEngland, unable to conquer, has stooped to corrupt; and defeated in\r\nthe last, as in the first, she is in a worse condition than before.\r\nContinually increasing her crimes, she increases the measure of her\r\natonement, and multiplies the sacrifices she must make to obtain peace.\r\nNothing but the most obstinate stupidity could have induced her to let\r\nslip the opportunity when it was within her reach. In addition to the\r\nprospect of new expenses, she is now, to use Mr. Pitt's own figurative\r\nexpression against France, _not only on the brink, but in the gulph\r\nof bankruptcy_. There is no longer any mystery in paper money. Call\r\nit assignats, mandats, exchequer bills, or bank notes, it is still the\r\nsame. Time has solved the problem, and experience has fixed its fate.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 See Chapter XXVI. of this volume.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThe government of that unfortunate country discovers its faithlessness\r\nso much, that peace on any terms with her is scarcely worth obtaining.\r\nOf what use is peace with a government that will employ that peace for\r\nno other purpose than to repair, as far as it is possible, her shattered\r\nfinances and broken credit, and then go to war again? Four times within\r\nthe last ten years, from the time the American war closed, has the\r\nAnglo-germanic government of England been meditating fresh war. First\r\nwith France on account of Holland, in 1787; afterwards with Russia;\r\nthen with Spain, on account of Nootka Sound; and a second time against\r\nFrance, to overthrow her revolution. Sometimes that government employs\r\nPrussia against Austria; at another time Austria against Prussia; and\r\nalways one or the other, or both against France. Peace with such a\r\ngovernment is only a treacherous cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of wars on the part of England, within the last century,\r\nmore than before, must have had some cause that did not exist prior to\r\nthat epoch. It is not difficult to discover what that cause is. It is\r\nthe mischievous compound of an Elector of the Germanic body and a King\r\nof England; and which necessarily must, at some day or other, become\r\nan object of attention to France. That one nation has not a right to\r\ninterfere in the internal government of another nation, is admitted; and\r\nin this point of view, France has no right to dictate to England what\r\nits form of government shall be. If it choose to have a thing called a\r\nKing, or whether that King shall be a man or an ass, is a matter with\r\nwhich France has no business. But whether an Elector of the Germanic\r\nbody shall be King of England, is an _external_ case, with which\r\nFrance and every other nation, who suffers inconvenience and injury in\r\nconsequence of it, has a right to interfere.\r\n\r\nIt is from this mischievous compound of Elector and King, that\r\noriginates a great part of the troubles that vex the continent of\r\nEurope; and with respect to England, it has been the cause of her\r\nimmense national debt, the ruin of her finances, and the insolvency of\r\nher bank. All intrigues on the continent, in which England is a party,\r\nor becomes involved, are generated by, and act through, the medium of\r\nthis Anglo-germanic compound. It will be necessary to dissolve it. Let\r\nthe Elector retire to his Electorate, and the world will have peace.\r\n\r\nEngland herself has given examples of interference in matters of this\r\nkind, and that in cases where injury was only apprehended. She engaged\r\nin a long and expensive war against France (called the succession war)\r\nto prevent a grandson of Louis the Fourteenth being king of Spain;\r\nbecause, said she, _it will be injurious_ to me; and she has been\r\nfighting and intriguing against what was called the family-compact ever\r\nsince. In 1787 she threatened France with war to prevent a connection\r\nbetween France and Hoi-land; and in all her propositions of peace to-day\r\nshe is dictating separations. But if she look at the Anglo-germanic\r\ncompact at home, called the Hanover succession, she cannot avoid seeing\r\nthat France necessarily must, some day or other, take up that subject,\r\nand make the return of the Elector to his Electorate one of the\r\nconditions of peace. There will be no lasting peace between the two\r\ncountries till this be done, and the sooner it be done the better will\r\nit be for both.\r\n\r\nI have not been in any company where this matter aas been a topic, that\r\ndid not see it in the light it is here stated. Even Barthélémy,(1) when\r\nhe first came to the Directory (and Barthélémy was never famous for\r\npatriotism) acknowledged in my hearing, and in company with Derché,\r\nSecretary to the Legation at Lille, the connection of an Elector of\r\nGermany and a King of England to be injurious to France. I do not,\r\nhowever, mention it from a wish to embarrass the negociation for peace.\r\nThe Directory has fixed its _ultimatum_; but if that ultimatum be\r\nrejected, the obligation to adhere to it is discharged, and a new one\r\nmay be assumed. So wretchedly has Pitt managed his opportunities» that\r\nevery succeeding negociation has ended in terms more against him than\r\nthe former. If the Directory had bribed him, he could not serve his\r\ninterest better than he does. He serves it as Lord North served that of\r\nAmerica, which finished in the discharge of his master.*\r\n\r\n     1 Marquis de Barthélémy (François) (1750-1830) entered the\r\n     Directory in June, 1796, through royalist influence. He\r\n     shared Pichegru's banishment, and subsequently became an\r\n     agent of Louis XVIII.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     * The father of Pitt, when a member of the House of Commons,\r\n     exclaiming one day, during a former war, against the\r\n     enormous and ruinous expense of German connections, as the\r\n     offspring of the Hanover succession, and borrowing a\r\n     metaphor from the story of Prometheus, cried out: \"Thus,\r\n     Hie Prometheus, is Britain chained to the barren rock of\r\n     Hanover; whilst the imperial eagle preys upon her vitals.\"--\r\n     Author.\r\n\r\nThus far I had written when the negociation at Lille became suspended,\r\nin consequence of which I delayed the publication, that the ideas\r\nsuggested in this letter might not intrude themselves during the\r\ninterval. The _ultimatum_ offered by the Directory, as the terms of\r\npeace, was more moderate than the government of England had a right to\r\nexpect. That government, though the provoker of the war, and the first\r\nthat committed hostilities by sending away the ambassador Chauvelin,(**)\r\nhad formerly talked of demanding from France, _indemnification for\r\nthe past and security for the future_. France, in her turn, might have\r\nretorted, and demanded the same from England; but she did not. As it was\r\nEngland that, in consequence of her bankruptcy, solicited peace, France\r\noffered it to her on the simple condition of her restoring the islands\r\nshe had taken. The ultimatum has been rejected, and the negociation\r\nbroken off. The spirited part of France will say, _tant mieux_, so much\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n     ** It was stipulated in the treaty of commerce between\r\n     France and England, concluded at Paris, that the sending\r\n     away an ambassador by either party, should be taken as an\r\n     act of hostility by the other party. The declaration of war\r\n     (Feb. M *793) by the Convention, of which I was then a\r\n     member and know well the case, was made in exact conformity\r\n     to this article in the treaty; for it was not a declaration\r\n     of war against England, but a declaration that the French\r\n     Republic is in war with England; the first act of hostility\r\n     having been committed by England. The declaration was made\r\n     immediately on Chauvelin's return to France, and in\r\n     consequence of it. Mr. Pitt should inform himself of things\r\n     better than he does, before he prates so much about them, or\r\n     of the sending away of Malmesbury, who was only on a visit\r\n     of permission.--Author.\r\n\r\nHow the people of England feel on the breaking up of the negociation,\r\nwhich was entirely the act of their own Government, is best known to\r\nthemselves; but from what I know of the two nations, France ought to\r\nhold herself perfectly indifferent about a peace with the Government of\r\nEngland. Every day adds new strength to France and new embarrassments\r\nto her enemy. The resources of the one increase, as those of the other\r\nbecome exhausted. England is now reduced to the same system of paper\r\nmoney from which France has emerged, and we all know the inevitable fate\r\nof that system. It is not a victory over a few ships, like that on the\r\ncoast of Holland, that gives the least support or relief to a paper\r\nsystem. On the news of this victory arriving in England, the funds did\r\nnot rise a farthing. The Government rejoiced, but its creditors were\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find a motive, except in folly and madness, for the\r\nconduct of the English government. Every calculation and prediction of\r\nMr. Pitt has turned out directly the contrary; yet still he predicts.\r\nHe predicted, with all the solemn assurance of a magician, that France\r\nwould be bankrupt in a few months. He was right as to the thing, but\r\nwrong as to the place, for the bankruptcy happened in England whilst the\r\nwords were yet warm upon his lips. To find out what will happen, it is\r\nonly necessary to know what Mr. Pitt predicts. He is a true prophet if\r\ntaken in the reverse.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ruinous condition that England is now in, that great as\r\nthe difficulties of war are to the people, the difficulties that would\r\naccompany peace are equally as great to the Government. Whilst the war\r\ncontinues, Mr. Pitt has a pretence for shutting up the bank. But as that\r\npretence could last no longer than the war lasted, he dreads the peace\r\nthat would expose the absolute bankruptcy of the government, and unveil\r\nto a deceived nation the ruinous effect of his measures. Peace would be\r\na day of accounts to him, and he shuns it as an insolvent debtor shuns\r\na meeting of his creditors. War furnishes him with many pretences; peace\r\nwould furnish him with none, and he stands alarmed at its consequences.\r\nHis conduct in the negociation at Lille can be easily interpreted. It is\r\nnot for the sake of the nation that he asks to retain some of the taken\r\nislands; for what are islands to a nation that has already too many for\r\nher own good, or what are they in comparison to the expense of another\r\ncampaign in the present depreciating state of the English funds? (And\r\neven then those islands must be restored.)\r\n\r\nNo, it is not for the sake of the nation that he asks. It is for the\r\nsake of himself. It is as if he said to France, Give me some pretence,\r\ncover me from disgrace when my day of reckoning comes!\r\n\r\nAny person acquainted with the English Government knows that every\r\nMinister has some dread of what is called in England the winding up\r\nof accounts at the end of a war; that is, the final settlement of all\r\nexpenses incurred by the war; and no Minister had ever so great cause of\r\ndread as Mr. Pitt. A burnt child dreads the fire, and Pitt has had some\r\nexperience upon this case. The winding up of accounts at the end of the\r\nAmerican war was so great, that, though he was not the cause of it,\r\nand came into the Ministry with great popularity, he lost it all by\r\nundertaking, what was impossible for him to avoid, the voluminous\r\nbusiness of the winding up. If such was the case in settling the\r\naccounts of his predecessor, how much more has he to apprehend when the\r\naccounts to be settled are his own? All men in bad circumstances\r\nhate the settlement of accounts, and Pitt, as a Minister, is of that\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nBut let us take a view of things on a larger ground than the case of\r\na Minister. It will then be found, that England, on a comparison of\r\nstrength with France, when both nations are disposed to exert their\r\nutmost, has no possible chance of success. The efforts that England made\r\nwithin the last century were not generated on the ground of _natural\r\nability_, but of _artificial anticipations_. She ran posterity into\r\ndebt, and swallowed up in one generation the resources of several\r\ngenerations yet to come, till the project can be pursued no longer. It\r\nis otherwise in France. The vastness of her territory and her population\r\nrender the burden easy that would make a bankrupt of a country like\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt is not the weight of a thing, but the numbers who are to bear that\r\nweight, that makes it feel light or heavy to the shoulders of those who\r\nbear it. A land-tax of half as much in the pound as the land-tax is in\r\nEngland, will raise nearly four times as much revenue in France as is\r\nraised in England. This is a scale easily understood, by which all the\r\nother sections of productive revenue can be measured. Judge then of the\r\ndifference of natural ability.\r\n\r\nEngland is strong in a navy; but that navy costs about eight millions\r\nsterling a-year, and is one of the causes that has hastened her\r\nbankruptcy. The history of navy bills sufficiently proves this. But\r\nstrong as England is in this case, the fate of navies must finally be\r\ndecided by the natural ability of each country to carry its navy to the\r\ngreatest extent; and France is able to support a navy twice as large as\r\nthat of England, with less than half the expense per head on the people,\r\nwhich the present navy of England costs.\r\n\r\nWe all know that a navy cannot be raised as expeditiously as an army.\r\nBut as the average duration of a navy, taking the decay of time, storms,\r\nand all circumstances and accidents together, is less than twenty years,\r\nevery navy must be renewed within that time; and France at the end of a\r\nfew years, can create and support a navy of double the extent of that of\r\nEngland; and the conduct of the English government will provoke her to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut of what use are navies otherwise than to make or prevent invasions?\r\nCommercially considered, they are losses. They scarcely give any\r\nprotection to the commerce of the countries which have them, compared\r\nwith the expense of maintaining them, and they insult the commerce of\r\nthe nations that are neutral.\r\n\r\nDuring the American war, the plan of the armed neutrality was formed and\r\nput in execution: but it was inconvenient, expensive, and ineffectual.\r\nThis being the case, the problem is, does not commerce contain within\r\nitself, the means of its own protection? It certainly does, if the\r\nneutral nations will employ that means properly.\r\n\r\nInstead then of an _armed neutrality_, the plan should be directly the\r\ncontrary. It should be an _unarmed neutrality_. In the first place,\r\nthe rights of neutral nations are easily defined. They are such as are\r\nexercised by nations in their intercourse with each other in time of\r\npeace, and which ought not, and cannot of right, be interrupted in\r\nconsequence of war breaking out between any two or more of them.\r\n\r\nTaking this as a principle, the next thing is to give it effect. The\r\nplan of the armed neutrality was to effect it by threatening war; but an\r\nunarmed neutrality can effect it by much easier and more powerful means.\r\n\r\nWere the neutral nations to associate, under an honourable injunction of\r\nfidelity to each other, and publicly declare to the world, that if any\r\nbelligerent power shall seize or molest any ship or vessel belonging\r\nto the citizens or subjects of any of the powers composing that\r\nAssociation, that the whole Association will shut its ports against the\r\nflag of the offending nation, and will not permit any goods, wares,\r\nor merchandise, produced or manufactured in the offending nation, or\r\nappertaining thereto, to be imported into any of the ports included in\r\nthe Association, until reparation be made to the injured party,--the\r\nreparation to be three times the value of the vessel and cargo,--and\r\nmoreover that all remittances on money, goods, and bills of exchange, do\r\ncease to be made to the offending nation, until the said reparation be\r\nmade: were the neutral nations only to do this, which it is their\r\ndirect interest to do, England, as a nation depending on the commerce of\r\nneutral nations in time of war, dare not molest them, and France would\r\nnot. But whilst, from the want of a common system, they individually\r\npermit England to do it, because individually they cannot resist it,\r\nthey put France under the necessity of doing the same thing. The supreme\r\nof all laws, in all cases, is that of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nAs the commerce of neutral nations would thus be protected by the means\r\nthat commerce naturally contains within itself, all the naval operations\r\nof France and England would be confined within the circle of acting\r\nagainst each other: and in that case it needs no spirit of prophecy to\r\ndiscover that France must finally prevail. The sooner this be done, the\r\nbetter will it be for both nations, and for all the world.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine had already prepared his \"Maritime Compact,\" and\r\n     devised the Rainbow Flag, which was to protect commerce, the\r\n     substance and history of which constitutes his Seventh\r\n     Letter to the People of the United States, Chapter XXXIII.\r\n     of the present volume. He sent the articles of his proposed\r\n     international Association to the Minister of Foreign\r\n     Relations, Talleyrand, who responded with a cordial letter.\r\n     The articles of \"Maritime Compact,\" translated into French\r\n     by Nicolas Bouneville, were, in 1800, sent to all the\r\n     Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Europe, and to the\r\n     ambassadors in Paris.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. THE RECALL OF MONROE. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 Monroe, like Edmund Randolph and Thomas Paine, was\r\n     sacrificed to the new commercial alliance with Great\r\n     Britain. The Cabinet of Washington were entirely hostile to\r\n     France, and in their determination to replace Monroe were\r\n     assisted by Gouverneur Morris, still in Europe, who wrote to\r\n     President Washington calumnies against that Minister. In a\r\n     letter of December 19, 1795, Morris tells Washington that he\r\n     had heard from a trusted informant that Monroe had said to\r\n     several Frenchmen that \"he had no doubt but that, if they\r\n     would do what was proper here, he and his friends would turn\r\n     out Washington.\" On July 2, 1796, the Cabinet ministers,\r\n     Pickering, Wolcott, and Mo-Henry, wrote to the President\r\n     their joint opinion that the interests of the United States\r\n     required Monroe's recall, and slanderously connected him\r\n     with anonymous letters from France written by M.\r\n     Montflorence. The recall, dated August 22, 1796, reached\r\n     Monroe early in November. It alluded to certain \"concurring\r\n     circumstances,\" which induced his removal, and these \"hidden\r\n     causes\" (in Paine's phrase) Monroe vainly demanded on his\r\n     return to America early in 1797. The Directory, on\r\n     notification of Monroe's recall, resolved not to recognize\r\n     his successor, and the only approach to an American Minister\r\n     in Paris for the remainder of the century was Thomas Paine,\r\n     who was consulted by the Foreign Ministers, De la Croix and\r\n     Talleyrand, and by Napoleon. On the approach of C. C.\r\n     Pinckney, as successor to Monroe, Paine feared that his\r\n     dismissal might entail war, and urged the Minister (De la\r\n     Croix) to regard Pinckney,--nominated in a recess of the\r\n     Senate,--as in \"suspension\" until confirmed by that body.\r\n     There might be unofficial \"pourparlers,\" with him. This\r\n     letter (State Archives, Paris, États Unis, vol. 46, fol. 425)\r\n     was considered for several days before Pinckney reached\r\n     Paris (December 5, 1796), but the Directory considered that\r\n     it was not a \"dignified\" course, and Pinckney was ordered to\r\n     leave French territory, under the existing decree against\r\n     foreigners who had no permit to remain.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, Sept. 27, 1797. Editors of the Bien-in formé.\r\n\r\nCitizens: in your 19th number of the complementary 5th, you gave an\r\nanalysis of the letters of James Monroe to Timothy Pickering. The\r\nnewspapers of Paris and the departments have copied this correspondence\r\nbetween the ambassador of the United States and the Secretary of State.\r\nI notice, however, that a few of them have omitted some important facts,\r\nwhilst indulging in comments of such an extraordinary nature that it is\r\nclear they know neither Monroe's integrity nor the intrigues of Pitt in\r\nthis affair.\r\n\r\nThe recall of Monroe is connected with circumstances so important to the\r\ninterests of France and the United States, that we must be careful not\r\nto confound it with the recall of an ordinary individual. The Washington\r\nfaction had affected to spread it abroad that James Monroe was the cause\r\nof rupture between the two Republics. This accusation is a perfidious\r\nand calumnious one; since the main point in this affair is not so much\r\nthe recall of a worthy, enlightened and republican minister, as\r\nthe ingratitude and clandestine manoeuvering of the government of\r\nWashington, who caused the misunderstanding by signing a treaty\r\ninjurious to the French Republic.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe, in his letters, does not deny the right of government to\r\nwithdraw its confidence from any one of its delegates, representatives,\r\nor agents. He has hinted, it is true, that caprice and temper are not\r\nin accordance with the spirit of paternal rule, and that whenever a\r\nrepresentative government punishes or rewards, good faith, integrity and\r\njustice should replace _the good pleasure of Kings_.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, they have done more than recall an agent. Had they\r\nconfined themselves to depriving him of his appointment, James Monroe\r\nwould have kept silence; but he has been accused of lighting the torch\r\nof discord in both Republics. The refutation of this absurd and infamous\r\nreproach is the chief object of his correspondence. If he did not\r\nimmediately complain of these slanders in his letters of the 6th and\r\n8th [July], it is because he wished to use at first a certain degree of\r\ncaution, and, if it were possible, to stifle intestine troubles at\r\ntheir birth. He wished to reopen the way to peaceful negotiations to be\r\nconducted with good faith and justice.\r\n\r\nThe arguments of the Secretary of State on the rights of the supreme\r\nadministration of the United States are peremptory; but the observations\r\nof Monroe on the hidden causes of his recall are touching; they come\r\nfrom the heart; they are characteristic of an excellent citizen. If he\r\ndoes more than complain of his unjust recall as a man of feeling would;\r\nif he proudly asks for proofs of a grave accusation, it is after he has\r\ntried in vain every honest and straightforward means. He will not suffer\r\nthat a government, sold to the enemies of freedom, should discharge upon\r\nhim its shame, its crimes, its ingratitude, and all the odium of its\r\nunjust dealings.\r\n\r\nWere Monroe to find himself an object of public hatred, the Republican\r\nparty in the United States, that party which is the sincere ally\r\nof France, would be annihilated, and this is the aim of the English\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nImagine the triumph of Pitt, if Monroe and the other friends of freedom\r\nin America, should be unjustly attacked in France!\r\n\r\nMonroe does not lay his cause before the Senate since the Senate\r\nitself ratified the unconstitutional treaty; he appeals to the house of\r\nRepresentatives, and at the same time lays his cause before the upright\r\ntribunal of the American nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. PRIVATE LETTER TO PRESIDENT JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, October 1, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the\r\nyear 1797. It was then my intention to return to America; but there were\r\nso many British frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after\r\na few days knew that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did\r\nnot think it best to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so,\r\nas I had no confidence in the captain of the Dublin Packet (Clay).(1) I\r\nmentioned to you in that letter, which I believe you received thro'\r\nthe hands of Colonel [Aaron] Burr, that I was glad since you were not\r\nPresident that you had accepted the nomination of Vice President.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners Ellsworth & Co.(2) have been here about eight months,\r\nand three more useless mortals never came upon public business. Their\r\npresence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit.\r\nThey set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived. I was then\r\nin Belgia.(3) Upon my return to Paris I learnt they had made a point of\r\nnot returning the visits of Mr. Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said,\r\nthey had not the confidence of the executive. Every known republican was\r\ntreated in the same manner. I learned from Mr. Miller of Philadelphia,\r\nwho had occasion to see them upon business, that they did not intend\r\nto return my visit, if I made one. This, I supposed, it was intended I\r\nshould know, that I might not make one. It had the contrary effect. I\r\nwent to see Mr. Ellsworth. I told him, I did not come to see him as a\r\ncommissioner, nor to congratulate him upon his mission; that I came to\r\nsee him because I had formerly known him in Congress. \"I mean not,\"\r\nsaid I, \"to press you with any questions, or to engage you in\r\nany conversation upon the business you are come upon, but I will\r\nnevertheless candidly say that I know not what expectations the\r\nGovernment or the people of America may have of your mission, or what\r\nexpectations you may have yourselves, but I believe you will find you\r\ncan do but little. The treaty with England lies at the threshold of all\r\nyour business. The American Government never did two more foolish things\r\nthan when it signed that Treaty and recalled Mr. Monroe, who was the\r\nonly man could do them any service.\" Mr. Ellsworth put on the dull\r\ngravity of a Judge, and was silent. I added, \"You may perhaps make a\r\ntreaty like that you have made with England, which is a surrender of the\r\nrights of the American flag; for the principle that neutral ships make\r\nneutral property must be general or not at all.\" I then changed the\r\nsubject, for I had all the talk to myself upon this topic, and enquired\r\nafter Samuel Adams, (I asked nothing about John,) Mr. Jefferson, Mr.\r\nMonroe, and others of my friends; and the melancholy case of the yellow\r\nfever,--of which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had\r\nbeen summing up a case to a Jury. Here my visit ended, and had Mr.\r\nEllsworth been as cunning as a statesman, or as wise as a Judge, he\r\nwould have returned my visit that he might appear insensible of the\r\nintention of mine.\r\n\r\n     1 The packet was indeed searched for Paine by a British\r\n     cruiser.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Oliver Ellsworth (Chief Justice), W. V. Murray, and W. R.\r\n     Davie, were sent by President Adams to France to negotiate a\r\n     treaty. In this they failed, but a convention was signed\r\n     September 30, 1800, which terminated the treaty of 1778,\r\n     which had become a source of discord, and prepared the way\r\n     for the negotiations of Livingston and Monroe in 1803.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     3 Paine had visited his room-mate in Luxembourg prison,\r\n     Vanhuele, who was now Mayor of Bruges.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nI now come to the affairs of this country and of Europe. You will, I\r\nsuppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of\r\nMarengo in Italy, where the Austrians were defeated--of the armistice\r\nin consequence thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa etc. to\r\nthe french--of the successes of the french Army in Germany--and the\r\nextension of the armistice in that quarter--of the preliminaries of\r\nPeace signed at Paris--of the refusal of the Emperor [of Austria] to\r\nratify these preliminaries--of the breaking of the armistice by the\r\nfrench Government in consequence of that refusal--of the \"gallant\"\r\nexpedition of the Emperor to put himself at the head of his Army--of his\r\npompous arrival there--of his having made his will--of prayers being put\r\nin all his churches for the preservation of the life of this Hero--of\r\nGeneral Moreau announcing to him, immediately on his arrival at the\r\nArmy, that hostilities would commence the day after the next at sunrise\r\nunless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would sign within\r\n45 days--of his surrendering up three of the principal keys of Germany\r\n(Ulm, Philipsbourg, and Ingolstadt) as security that he would sign them.\r\nThis is the state things are now in, at the time of writing this letter;\r\nbut it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign the\r\npreliminaries was motived upon a note from the King of England to be\r\nadmitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to\r\nby the french upon the condition of an armistice at Sea, which England,\r\nbefore knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused. From\r\nall which it appears to me, judging from circumstances, that the Emperor\r\nis now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of\r\ngetting out but by a peace. The Congress for the peace is to be held\r\nat Lunéville, a town in France. Since the affair of Rastadt the French\r\ncommissioners will not trust themselves within the Emperor's territory.\r\n\r\nI now come to domestic Affairs. I know not what the Commissioners have\r\ndone, but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have\r\nsome authority, it is not much. The paper as you will perceive is\r\nconsiderably prior to this letter. I know that the Commissioners before\r\nthis piece appeared intended setting off. It is therefore probable that\r\nwhat they have done is conformable to what this paper mentions, which\r\ncertainly will not atone for the expence their mission has incurred,\r\nneither are they, by all the accounts I hear of them, men fitted for the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBut independently of these matters there appears to be a state of\r\ncircumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial\r\ntreaties unnecessary. In the first place I doubt if any peace will be\r\nmade with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a\r\ncoalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on\r\nthe seas. This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I send you.\r\n\r\nThe piece No. I, without any title, was written in consequence of a\r\nquestion put to me by Bonaparte. As he supposed I knew England and\r\nEnglish Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of\r\nnegociating a Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include\r\nEngland. This was when Count St. Julian was in Paris, on the part of the\r\nEmperor negociating the preliminaries:--which as I have before said the\r\nEmperor refused to sign on the pretence of admitting England.\r\n\r\nThe piece No. 2, entitled _On the Jacobinism of the English at sea_, was\r\nwritten when the English made their insolent and impolitic expedition to\r\nDenmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politic of No. I. I shewed it\r\nto a friend [Bonneville] who had it translated into french, and printed\r\nin the form of a Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the foreign\r\nMinisters, and persons in the Government. It was immediately copied\r\ninto several of the french Journals, and into the official Paper, the\r\nMoniteur. It appeared in this paper one day before the last dispatch\r\narrived from Egypt; which agreed perfectly with what I had said\r\nrespecting Egypt. It hit the two cases of Denmark and Egypt in the exact\r\nproper moment.\r\n\r\nThe Piece No. 3, entitled _Compact Maritime_, is the sequel of No. 2,\r\ndigested in form. It is translating at the time I write this letter,\r\nand I am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject.\r\nThe pieces 2 and 3 go off in manuscript to England, by a confidential\r\nperson, where they will be published.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The substance of most of these \"pieces\" are embodied in\r\n     Paine's Seventh Letter to the People of the United States\r\n     (infra p. 420).--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBy all the news we get from the North there appears to be something\r\nmeditating against England. It is now given for certain that Paul has\r\nembargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia till\r\nsome principle be established for protecting the Rights of neutral\r\nNations, and securing the liberty of the Seas. The preparations in\r\nDenmark continue, notwithstanding the convention that she has made with\r\nEngland, which leaves the question with respect to the right set up by\r\nEngland to stop and search Neutral vessels undecided. I send you the\r\nparagraphs upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the\r\nexcessive price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest.\r\nI attribute it more to the abundant increase of paper, and the\r\nnon-circulation of cash, than to any other cause. People in trade\r\ncan push the paper off as fast as they receive it, as they did by\r\ncontinental money in America; but as farmers have not this opportunity,\r\nthey endeavor to secure themselves by going considerably in advance.\r\n\r\nI have now given you all the great articles of intelligence, for I\r\ntrouble not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the\r\nCommissioners, nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams,\r\notherwise than to wish him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from\r\nthem, it may be proper for America to consider whether it is worth her\r\nwhile to enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of\r\nthose circumstances which if they go on will render partial treaties\r\nuseless by deranging them. But if, in the mean time, she enters into\r\nany treaty it ought to be with a condition to the following purpose:\r\nReserving to herself the right of joining in an Association of Nations\r\nfor the protection of the Rights of Neutral Commerce and the security of\r\nthe liberty of the Seas.\r\n\r\nThe pieces 2, 3, may go to the press. They will make a small pamphlet\r\nand the printers are welcome to put my name to it. (It is best it should\r\nbe put.) From thence they will get into the newspapers. I know that the\r\nfaction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily. They are welcome.\r\n\r\nIt does not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for\r\nit I am doing America more service, as a neutral Nation, than their\r\nexpensive Commissioners can do, and she has that service from me for\r\nnothing. The piece No. 1 is only for your own amusement and that of your\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject. When Mr.\r\nEllsworth and Davie return to America, Murray will return to Holland,\r\nand in that case there will be nobody in Paris but Mr. Skipwith that\r\nhas been in the habit of transacting business with the french Government\r\nsince the revolution began. He is on a good standing with them, and if\r\nthe chance of the day should place you in the presidency you cannot do\r\nbetter than appoint him for any purpose you may have occasion for in\r\nFrance. He is an honest man and will do his country justice, and that\r\nwith civility and good manners to the government he is commissioned to\r\nact with; a faculty which that Northern Bear Timothy Pickering wanted,\r\nand which the Bear of that Bear, John Adams, never possessed.\r\n\r\nI know not much of Mr. Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to\r\nevery American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow\r\nis a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr. Murray. It is upon\r\nthe fitness of the man to the place that I speak, for I have not\r\ncommunicated a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he\r\nknow, at the time of my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have\r\nintention to do it.\r\n\r\nI will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the\r\nprogress of iron bridges.\r\n\r\n[Here follows an account of the building of the iron bridge at\r\nSunderland, England, and some correspondence with Mr. Milbanke, M. P.,\r\nwhich will be given more fully and precisely in a chapter of vol. IV.\r\n(Appendix), on Iron Bridges, and is therefore omitted here.]\r\n\r\nI have now made two other Models [of bridges]. One is pasteboard, five\r\nfeet span and five inches of height from the cords. It is in the opinion\r\nof every person who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the\r\neye can behold. I then cast a model in metal following the construction\r\nof that in paste-board and of the same dimensions. The whole was\r\nexecuted in my own Chamber. It is far superior in strength, elegance,\r\nand readiness in execution to the model I made in America, and which you\r\nsaw in Paris.(1) I shall bring those models with me when I come\r\nhome, which will be as soon as I can pass the seas in safety from the\r\npiratical John Bulls. I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the\r\nBishop of Landaff's answer to my second part of the Age of Reason. As\r\nsoon as I got a copy of it I began a third part, which served also as an\r\nanswer to the Bishop; but as soon as the clerical society for promoting\r\n_Christian Knowledge_ knew of my intention to answer the Bishop, they\r\nprosecuted, as a Society, the printer of the first and second parts, to\r\nprevent that answer appearing. No other reason than this can be assigned\r\nfor their prosecuting at the time they did, because the first part had\r\nbeen in circulation above three years and the second part more than one,\r\nand they prosecuted immediately on knowing that I was taking up their\r\nChampion. The Bishop's answer, like Mr. Burke's attack on the french\r\nrevolution, served me as a back-ground to bring forward other subjects\r\nupon, with more advantage than if the background was not there. This is\r\nthe motive that induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone\r\non without taking any notice of him. I have made and am still making\r\nadditions to the manuscript, and shall continue to do so till an\r\nopportunity arrive for publishing it.\r\n\r\n     1 \"These models exhibit an extraordinary degree not only of\r\n     skill, but of taste, and are wrought with extreme delicacy\r\n     entirely by his own hands. The largest is nearly four feet\r\n     in length; the iron-works, the chains, and every other\r\n     article belonging to it, were forged and manufactured by\r\n     himself. It is intended as the model of a bridge which is to\r\n     be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet, with\r\n     only one arch. The other is to be erected over a lesser\r\n     river, whose name I forget, and is likewise a single arch,\r\n     and of his own workmanship, excepting the chains, which,\r\n     instead of iron, are cut out of paste-hoard by the fair hand\r\n     of his correspondent, the 'Little Corner of the World' (Lady\r\n     Smyth), whose indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary.\r\n     He was offered £3000 for these models and refused it.\"--\r\n     Yorke's _Letters from France_, These models excited much\r\n     admiration in Washington and Philadelphia. They remained for\r\n     a long time in Peale's Museum at Philadelphia, but no trace\r\n     is left of them.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nIf any American frigate should come to france, and the direction of\r\nit fall to you, I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of\r\nreturning. The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is\r\nentirely healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health. This is\r\nthe first of October, and Mr. Skipwith has just called to tell me the\r\nCommissioners set off for Havre to-morrow. This will go by the frigate\r\nbut not with the knowledge of the Commissioners. Remember me with much\r\naffection to my friends and accept the same to yourself.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. PROPOSAL THAT LOUISIANA BE PURCHASED.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n(SENT TO THE PRESIDENT, CHRISTMAS DAY, 1802.)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine, being at Lovell's Hotel, Washington, suggested the\r\n     purchase of Louisiana to Dr. Michael Leib, representative\r\n     from Pennsylvania, who, being pleased with the idea,\r\n     suggested that he should write it to Jefferson. On the day\r\n     after its reception the President told Paine that \"measures\r\n     were already taken in that business.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nSpain has ceded Louisiana to France, and France has excluded Americans\r\nfrom New Orleans, and the navigation of the Mississippi. The people of\r\nthe Western Territory have complained of it to their Government, and the\r\nGovernment is of consequence involved and interested in the affair. The\r\nquestion then is--What is the best step to be taken?\r\n\r\nThe one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction\r\nof a right. The other is by accommodation,--still keeping the right in\r\nview, but not making it a groundwork.\r\n\r\nSuppose then the Government begin by making a proposal to France to\r\nre-purchase the cession made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it\r\nbe with the consent of the people of Louisiana, or a majority thereof.\r\n\r\nBy beginning on this ground any thing can be said without carrying the\r\nappearance of a threat. The growing power of the Western Territory can\r\nbe stated as a matter of information, and also the impossibility\r\nof restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans, and the equal\r\nimpossibility of France to prevent it.\r\n\r\nSuppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on\r\nthe carpet. This, on the part of America, will be estimated between the\r\nvalue of the commerce and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nThe French Treasury is not only empty, but the Government has consumed\r\nby anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue. A monied\r\nproposal will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon\r\nFrance can be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be\r\npaid here to the claimants.\r\n\r\n----I congratulate you on _The Birthday of the New Sun_,\r\n\r\nnow called Christmas Day; and I make you a present of a thought on\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nT.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. THOMAS PAINE TO THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd particularly to the Leaders of the Federal Faction, LETTER I.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, November 15th. The venerable\r\n     Mr. Gales, so long associated with this paper, had been in\r\n     youth a prosecuted adherent of Paine in Sheffield, England.\r\n     The paper distinguished itself by the kindly welcome it gave\r\n     Paine on his return to America. (See issues of Nov. 3 and\r\n     10, 1802.) Paine landed at Baltimore, Oct. 30th.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of almost fifteen years, I am again returned to the\r\ncountry in whose dangers I bore my share, and to whose greatness I\r\ncontributed my part.\r\n\r\nWhen I sailed for Europe, in the spring of 1787, it was my intention to\r\nreturn to America the next year, and enjoy in retirement the esteem of\r\nmy friends, and the repose I was entitled to. I had stood out the storm\r\nof one revolution, and had no wish to embark in another. But other\r\nscenes and other circumstances than those of contemplated ease were\r\nallotted to me. The French revolution was beginning to germinate when I\r\narrived in France. The principles of it were good, they were copied\r\nfrom America, and the men who conducted it were honest. But the fury of\r\nfaction soon extinguished the one, and sent the other to the scaffold.\r\nOf those who began that revolution, I am almost the only survivor,\r\nand that through a thousand dangers. I owe this not to the prayers of\r\npriests, nor to the piety of hypocrites, but to the continued protection\r\nof Providence.\r\n\r\nBut while I beheld with pleasure the dawn of liberty rising in Europe,\r\nI saw with regret the lustre of it fading in America. In less than two\r\nyears from the time of my departure some distant symptoms painfully\r\nsuggested the idea that the principles of the revolution were expiring\r\non the soil that produced them. I received at that time a letter from a\r\nfemale literary correspondent, and in my answer to her, I expressed my\r\nfears on that head.(1)\r\n\r\nI now know from the information I obtain upon the spot, that the\r\nimpressions that then distressed me, for I was proud of America, were\r\nbut too well founded. She was turning her back on her own glory, and\r\nmaking hasty strides in the retrograde path of oblivion. But a spark\r\nfrom the altar of _Seventy-six_, unextinguished and unextinguishable\r\nthrough the long night of error, is again lighting up, in every part of\r\nthe Union, the genuine name of rational liberty.\r\n\r\nAs the French revolution advanced, it fixed the attention of the world,\r\nand drew from the pensioned pen (2) of Edmund Burke a furious attack.\r\nThis brought me once more on the public theatre of politics, and\r\noccasioned the pamphlet _Rights of Man_. It had the greatest run of\r\nany work ever published in the English language. The number of copies\r\ncirculated in England, Scotland, and Ireland, besides translations\r\ninto foreign languages, was between four and five hundred thousand. The\r\nprinciples of that work were the same as those in _Common Sense_, and\r\nthe effects would have been the same in England as that had produced in\r\nAmerica, could the vote of the nation been quietly taken, or had equal\r\nopportunities of consulting or acting existed. The only difference\r\nbetween the two works was, that the one was adapted to the local\r\ncircumstances of England, and the other to those of America. As to\r\nmyself, I acted in both cases alike; I relinquished to the people of\r\nEngland, as I had done to those of America, all profits from the work.\r\nMy reward existed in the ambition to do good, and the independent\r\nhappiness of my own mind.\r\n\r\n     1 Paine here quotes a passage from his letter to Mrs. Few,\r\n     already given in the Memorial to Monroe (XXI.). The entire\r\n     letter to Mrs. Few will be printed in the Appendix to Vol.\r\n     IV. of this work.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 See editorial note p. 95 in this volume.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBut a faction, acting in disguise, was rising in America; they had lost\r\nsight of first principles. They were beginning to contemplate government\r\nas a profitable monopoly, and the people as hereditary property. It\r\nis, therefore, no wonder that the _Rights of Man_ was attacked by that\r\nfaction, and its author continually abused. But let them go on; give\r\nthem rope enough and they will put an end to their own insignificance.\r\nThere is too much common sense and independence in America to be long\r\nthe dupe of any faction, foreign or domestic.\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of the freedom we enjoy, the licentiousness of the\r\npapers called Federal, (and I know not why they are called so, for they\r\nare in their principles anti-federal and despotic,) is a dishonour\r\nto the character of the country, and an injury to its reputation\r\nand importance abroad. They represent the whole people of America as\r\ndestitute of public principle and private manners. As to any injury they\r\ncan do at home to those whom they abuse, or service they can render\r\nto those who employ them, it is to be set down to the account of\r\nnoisy nothingness. It is on themselves the disgrace recoils, for the\r\nreflection easily presents itself to every thinking mind, that _those\r\nwho abuse liberty when they possess it would abuse power could they\r\nobtain it_; and, therefore, they may as well take as a general motto,\r\nfor all such papers, _We and our patrons are not fit to be trusted with\r\npower_.\r\n\r\nThere is in America, more than in any other country, a large body\r\nof people who attend quietly to their farms, or follow their several\r\noccupations; who pay no regard to the clamours of anonymous scribblers,\r\nwho think for themselves, and judge of government, not by the fury of\r\nnewspaper writers, but by the prudent frugality of its measures, and the\r\nencouragement it gives to the improvement and prosperity of the country;\r\nand who, acting on their own judgment, never come forward in an election\r\nbut on some important occasion. When this body moves, all the little\r\nbarkings of scribbling and witless curs pass for nothing. To say to this\r\nindependent description of men, \"You must turn out such and such persons\r\nat the next election, for they have taken off a great many taxes, and\r\nlessened the expenses of government, they have dismissed my son, or my\r\nbrother, or myself, from a lucrative office, in which there was nothing\r\nto do\"--is to show the cloven foot of faction, and preach the language\r\nof ill-disguised mortification. In every part of the Union, this faction\r\nis in the agonies of death, and in proportion as its fate approaches,\r\ngnashes its teeth and struggles. My arrival has struck it as with an\r\nhydrophobia, it is like the sight of water to canine madness.\r\n\r\nAs this letter is intended to announce my arrival to my friends, and to\r\nmy enemies if I have any, for I ought to have none in America, and as\r\nintroductory to others that will occasionally follow, I shall close it\r\nby detailing the line of conduct I shall pursue.\r\n\r\nI have no occasion to ask, and do not intend to accept, any place or\r\noffice in the government.(1) There is none it could give me that would\r\nbe any ways equal to the profits I could make as an author, for I have\r\nan established fame in the literary world, could I reconcile it to my\r\nprinciples to make money by my politics or religion. I must be in every\r\nthing what I have ever been, a disinterested volunteer; my proper sphere\r\nof action is on the common floor of citizenship, and to honest men I\r\ngive my hand and my heart freely.\r\n\r\n     1 The President (Jefferson) being an intimate friend of\r\n     Paine, and suspected, despite his reticence, of sympathizing\r\n     with Paine's religions views, was included in the\r\n     denunciations of Paine (\"The Two Toms\" they were called),\r\n     and Paine here goes out of his way to soften matters for\r\n     Jefferson.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nI have some manuscript works to publish, of which I shall give proper\r\nnotice, and some mechanical affairs to bring forward, that will employ\r\nall my leisure time. I shall continue these letters as I see occasion,\r\nand as to the low party prints that choose to abuse me, they are\r\nwelcome; I shall not descend to answer them. I have been too much used\r\nto such common stuff to take any notice of it. The government of England\r\nhonoured me with a thousand martyrdoms, by burning me in effigy in every\r\ntown in that country, and their hirelings in America may do the same.\r\n\r\nCity of Washington.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II(1)\r\n\r\nAs the affairs of the country to which I am returned are of more\r\nimportance to the world, and to me, than of that I have lately left,\r\n(for it is through the new world the old must be regenerated, if\r\nregenerated at all,) I shall not take up the time of the reader with an\r\naccount of scenes that have passed in France, many of which are painful\r\nto remember and horrid to relate, but come at once to the circumstances\r\nin which I find America on my arrival.\r\n\r\nFourteen years, and something more, have produced a change, at least\r\namong a part of the people, and I ask my-self what it is? I meet or hear\r\nof thousands of my former connexions, who are men of the same principles\r\nand friendships as when I left them. But a non-descript race, and of\r\nequivocal generation, assuming the name of _Federalist_,--a name that\r\ndescribes no character of principle good or bad, and may equally\r\nbe applied to either,--has since started up with the rapidity of a\r\nmushroom, and like a mushroom is withering on its rootless stalk. Are\r\nthose men _federalized_ to support the liberties of their country or to\r\noverturn them? To add to its fair fame or riot on its spoils? The\r\nname contains no defined idea. It is like John Adams's definition of a\r\nRepublic, in his letter to Mr. Wythe of Virginia.(2) _It is_, says he,\r\n_an empire of laws and not of men_. But as laws may be bad as well as\r\ngood, an empire of laws may be the best of all governments or the worst\r\nof all tyrannies. But John Adams is a man of paradoxical heresies, and\r\nconsequently of a bewildered mind. He wrote a book entitled, \"_A Defence\r\nof the American Constitutions_,\" and the principles of it are an attack\r\nupon them. But the book is descended to the tomb of forgetfulness, and\r\nthe best fortune that can attend its author is quietly to follow its\r\nfate. John was not born for immortality. But, to return to Federalism.\r\n\r\n     1 National Intelligencer, Nov. 23d, 1802.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Chancellor Wythe, 1728-1806.--_Editor._ vol m--«5\r\n\r\nIn the history of parties and the names they assume, it often happens\r\nthat they finish by the direct contrary principles with which they\r\nprofess to begin, and thus it has happened with Federalism.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the old Congress, and prior to the establishment of\r\nthe federal government, the continental belt was too loosely buckled.\r\nThe several states were united in name but not in fact, and that nominal\r\nunion had neither centre nor circle. The laws of one state frequently\r\ninterferred with, and sometimes opposed, those of another. Commerce\r\nbetween state and state was without protection, and confidence without\r\na point to rest on. The condition the country was then in, was aptly\r\ndescribed by Pelatiah Webster, when he said, \"_thirteen staves and ne'er\r\na hoop will not make a barrel_.\"(1)\r\n\r\nIf, then, by _Federalist_ is to be understood one who was for cementing\r\nthe Union by a general government operating equally over all the States,\r\nin all matters that embraced the common interest, and to which the\r\nauthority of the States severally was not adequate, for no one State\r\ncan make laws to bind another; if, I say, by a _Federalist_ is meant\r\na person of this description, (and this is the origin of the name,) _I\r\nought to stand first on the list of Federalists_, for the proposition\r\nfor establishing a general government over the Union, came originally\r\nfrom me in 1783, in a written Memorial to Chancellor Livingston, then\r\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs to Congress, Robert Morris, Minister\r\nof Finance, and his associate, Gouverneur Morris, all of whom are now\r\nliving; and we had a dinner and conference at Robert Morris's on the\r\nsubject. The occasion was as follows:\r\n\r\nCongress had proposed a duty of five per cent, on imported articles, the\r\nmoney to be applied as a fund towards paying the interest of loans to\r\nbe borrowed in Holland. The resolve was sent to the several States to\r\nbe enacted into a law. Rhode Island absolutely refused. I was at\r\nthe trouble of a journey to Rhode Island to reason with them on the\r\nsubject.(2) Some other of the States enacted it with alterations, each\r\none as it pleased. Virginia adopted it, and afterwards repealed it, and\r\nthe affair came to nothing.\r\n\r\n     1 \"Like a stare in a cask well bound with hoops, it [the\r\n     individual State] stands firmer, is not so easily shaken,\r\n     bent, or broken, as it would be were it set up by itself\r\n     alone.\"--Pelatiah Webster, 1788. See Paul L. Ford's\r\n     Pamphlets cm the Constitution, etc., p. 128.--Editor\r\n\r\n     2  See my \"Life of Paine.\" vol i., p. 103.--Editor,\r\n\r\nIt was then visible, at least to me, that either Congress must frame the\r\nlaws necessary for the Union, and send them to the several States to be\r\nenregistered without any alteration, which would in itself appear like\r\nusurpation on one part and passive obedience on the other, or some\r\nmethod must be devised to accomplish the same end by constitutional\r\nprinciples; and the proposition I made in the memorial was, to _add\r\na continental legislature to Congress, to be elected by the several\r\nStates_. The proposition met the full approbation of the gentlemen to\r\nwhom it was addressed, and the conversation turned on the manner of\r\nbringing it forward. Gouverneur Morris, in walking with me after dinner,\r\nwished me to throw out the idea in the newspaper; I replied, that I did\r\nnot like to be always the proposer of new things, that it would have too\r\nassuming an appearance; and besides, that _I did not think the country\r\nwas quite wrong enough to be put right_. I remember giving the same\r\nreason to Dr. Rush, at Philadelphia, and to General Gates, at whose\r\nquarters I spent a day on my return from Rhode Island; and I suppose\r\nthey will remember it, because the observation seemed to strike them.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The Letter Books of Robert Morris (16 folio volumes, which\r\n     should be in our national Archives) contain many entries\r\n     relating to Paine's activity in the public service. Under\r\n     date Aug. 21, 1783, about the time referred to by Paine in\r\n     this letter, Robert Morris mentions a conversation with him\r\n     on public affairs. I am indebted to General Meredith Read,\r\n     owner of these Morris papers, for permission to examine\r\n     them.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut the embarrassments increasing, as they necessarily must from the\r\nwant of a better cemented union, the State of Virginia proposed holding\r\na commercial convention, and that convention, which was not sufficiently\r\nnumerous, proposed that another convention, with more extensive and\r\nbetter defined powers, should be held at Philadelphia, May 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nWhen the plan of the Federal Government, formed by this Convention, was\r\nproposed and submitted to the consideration of the several States, it\r\nwas strongly objected to in each of them. But the objections were not on\r\nanti-federal grounds, but on constitutional points. Many were shocked\r\nat the idea of placing what is called Executive Power in the hands of a\r\nsingle individual. To them it had too much the form and appearance of a\r\nmilitary government, or a despotic one. Others objected that the\r\npowers given to a president were too great, and that in the hands of\r\nan ambitious and designing man it might grow into tyranny, as it did\r\nin England under Oliver Cromwell, and as it has since done in France.\r\nA Republic must not only be so in its principles, but in its forms. The\r\nExecutive part of the Federal government was made for a man, and those\r\nwho consented, against their judgment, to place Executive Power in the\r\nhands of a single individual, reposed more on the supposed moderation of\r\nthe person they had in view, than on the wisdom of the measure itself.\r\n\r\nTwo considerations, however, overcame all objections. The one was, the\r\nabsolute necessity of a Federal Government. The other, the rational\r\nreflection, that as government in America is founded on the\r\nrepresentative system any error in the first essay could be reformed\r\nby the same quiet and rational process by which the Constitution was\r\nformed, and that either by the generation then living, or by those who\r\nwere to succeed. If ever America lose sight of this principle, she will\r\nno longer be the _land of liberty_. The father will become the assassin\r\nof the rights of the son, and his descendants be a race of slaves.\r\n\r\nAs many thousands who were minors are grown up to manhood since the name\r\nof _Federalist_ began, it became necessary, for their information, to\r\ngo back and show the origin of the name, which is now no longer what it\r\noriginally was; but it was the more necessary to do this, in order to\r\nbring forward, in the open face of day, the apostacy of those who first\r\ncalled themselves Federalists.\r\n\r\nTo them it served as a cloak for treason, a mask for tyranny. Scarcely\r\nwere they placed in the seat of power and office, than Federalism was to\r\nbe destroyed, and the representative system of government, the pride\r\nand glory of America, and the palladium of her liberties, was to be\r\noverthrown and abolished. The next generation was not to be free. The\r\nson was to bend his neck beneath the father's foot, and live, deprived\r\nof his rights, under hereditary control. Among the men of this apostate\r\ndescription, is to be ranked the ex-president _John Adams_. It has been\r\nthe political career of this man to begin with hypocrisy, proceed with\r\narrogance, and finish in contempt. May such be the fate of all such\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nI have had doubts of John Adams ever since the year 1776. In a\r\nconversation with me at that time, concerning the pamphlet _Common\r\nSense_, he censured it because it attacked the English form of\r\ngovernment. John was for independence because he expected to be made\r\ngreat by it; but it was not difficult to perceive, for the surliness of\r\nhis temper makes him an awkward hypocrite, that his head was as full of\r\nkings, queens, and knaves, as a pack of cards. But John has lost deal.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has a concealed project in his brain that he wants to bring\r\nforward, and fears will not succeed, he begins with it as physicians\r\ndo by suspected poison, try it first on an animal; if it agree with the\r\nstomach of the animal, he makes further experiments, and this was the\r\nway John took. His brain was teeming with projects to overturn the\r\nliberties of America, and the representative system of government, and\r\nhe began by hinting it in little companies. The secretary of John Jay,\r\nan excellent painter and a poor politician, told me, in presence of\r\nanother American, Daniel Parker, that in a company where himself was\r\npresent, John Adams talked of making the government hereditary, and that\r\nas Mr. Washington had no children, it should be made hereditary in the\r\nfamily of Lund Washington.(1) John had not impudence enough to propose\r\nhimself in the first instance, as the old French Normandy baron did,\r\nwho offered to come over to be king of America, and if Congress did not\r\naccept his offer, that they would give him thirty thousand pounds for\r\nthe generosity of it(2); but John, like a mole, was grubbing his way to\r\nit under ground. He knew that Lund Washington was unknown, for nobody\r\nhad heard of him, and that as the president had no children to succeed\r\nhim, the vice-president had, and if the treason had succeeded, and the\r\nhint with it, the goldsmith might be sent for to take measure of the\r\nhead of John or of his son for a golden wig. In this case, the good\r\npeople of Boston might have for a king the man they have rejected as a\r\ndelegate. The representative system is fatal to ambition.\r\n\r\n     1 See supra footnote on p. 288.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 See vol. ii. p. 318 of this work.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nKnowing, as I do, the consummate vanity of John Adams, and the\r\nshallowness of his judgment, I can easily picture to myself that when\r\nhe arrived at the Federal City he was strutting in the pomp of his\r\nimagination before the presidential house, or in the audience hall, and\r\nexulting in the language of Nebuchadnezzar, \"Is not this great Babylon,\r\nthat I have built for the honour of my Majesty!\" But in that unfortunate\r\nhour, or soon after, John, like Nebuchadnezzar, was driven from among\r\nmen, and fled with the speed of a post-horse.\r\n\r\nSome of John Adams's loyal subjects, I see, have been to present him\r\nwith an address on his birthday; but the language they use is too tame\r\nfor the occasion. Birthday addresses, like birthday odes, should not\r\ncreep along like mildrops down a cabbage leaf, but roll in a torrent of\r\npoetical metaphor. I will give them a specimen for the next year. Here\r\nit is--\r\n\r\nWhen an Ant, in travelling over the globe, lift up its foot, and put it\r\nagain on the ground, it shakes the earth to its centre: but when YOU,\r\nthe mighty Ant of the East, was born, &c. &c. &c, the centre jumped upon\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nThis, gentlemen, is the proper style of addresses from _well-bred_ ants\r\nto the monarch of the ant hills; and as I never take pay for preaching,\r\npraying, politics, or poetry, I make you a present of it. Some people\r\ntalk of impeaching John Adams; but I am for softer measures. I would\r\nkeep him to make fun of. He will then answer one of the ends for which\r\nhe was born, and he ought to be thankful that I am arrived to take his\r\npart. I voted in earnest to save the life of one unfortunate king, and\r\nI now vote in jest to save another. It is my fate to be always plagued\r\nwith fools. But to return to Federalism and apostacy.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the leaders of the faction was to overthrow the liberties\r\nof the new world, and place government on the corrupt system of the old.\r\nThey wanted to hold their power by a more lasting tenure than the choice\r\nof their constituents. It is impossible to account for their conduct and\r\nthe measures they adopted on any other ground. But to accomplish that\r\nobject, a standing army and a prodigal revenue must be raised; and to\r\nobtain these, pretences must be invented to deceive. Alarms of dangers\r\nthat did not exist even in imagination, but in the direct spirit of\r\nlying, were spread abroad. Apostacy stalked through the land in the garb\r\nof patriotism, and the torch of treason blinded for a while the flame of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nFor what purpose could an army of twenty-five thousand men be wanted?\r\nA single reflection might have taught the most credulous that while\r\nthe war raged between France and England, neither could spare a man to\r\ninvade America. For what purpose, then, could it be wanted? The case\r\ncarries its own explanation. It was wanted for the purpose of destroying\r\nthe representative system, for it could be employed for no other. Are\r\nthese men Federalists? If they are, they are federalized to deceive and\r\nto destroy.\r\n\r\nThe rage against Dr. Logan's patriotic and voluntary mission to France\r\nwas excited by the shame they felt at the detection of the false alarms\r\nthey had circulated. As to the opposition given by the remnant of\r\nthe faction to the repeal of the taxes laid on during the former\r\nadministration, it is easily accounted for. The repeal of those taxes\r\nwas a sentence of condemnation on those who laid them on, and in the\r\nopposition they gave in that repeal, they are to be considered in the\r\nlight of criminals standing on their defence, and the country has passed\r\njudgment upon them.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nCity of Washington, Lovett's Hotel, Nov. 19, 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, Dec. 29th, 1802.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nTo ELECT, and to REJECT, is the prerogative of a free people.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of Independence, no period has arrived that\r\nso decidedly proves the excellence of the representative system of\r\ngovernment, and its superiority over every other, as the time we now\r\nlive in. Had America been cursed with John Adams's _hereditary Monarchy_\r\nor Alexander Hamilton's _Senate for life_ she must have sought, in the\r\ndoubtful contest of civil war, what she now obtains by the expression of\r\npublic will. An appeal to elections decides better than an appeal to the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nThe Reign of Terror that raged in America during the latter end of the\r\nWashington administration, and the whole of that of Adams, is enveloped\r\nin mystery to me. That there were men in the government hostile to the\r\nrepresentative system, was once their boast, though it is now their\r\noverthrow, and therefore the fact is established against them. But that\r\nso large a mass of the people should become the dupes of those who were\r\nloading them with taxes in order to load them with chains, and deprive\r\nthem of the right of election, can be ascribed only to that species\r\nof wildfire rage, lighted up by falsehood, that not only acts without\r\nreflection, but is too impetuous to make any.\r\n\r\nThere is a general and striking difference between the genuine effects\r\nof truth itself, and the effects of falsehood believed to be truth.\r\nTruth is naturally benign; but falsehood believed to be truth is always\r\nfurious. The former delights in serenity, is mild and persuasive, and\r\nseeks not the auxiliary aid of invention. The latter sticks at nothing.\r\nIt has naturally no morals. Every lie is welcome that suits its purpose.\r\nIt is the innate character of the thing to act in this manner, and the\r\ncriterion by which it may be known, whether in politics or religion.\r\nWhen any thing is attempted to be supported by lying, it is presumptive\r\nevidence that the thing so supported is a lie also. The stock on which a\r\nlie can be grafted must be of the same species as the graft.\r\n\r\nWhat is become of the mighty clamour of French invasion, and the cry\r\nthat our country is in danger, and taxes and armies must be raised to\r\ndefend it? The danger is fled with the faction that created it, and what\r\nis worst of all, the money is fled too. It is I only that have committed\r\nthe hostility of invasion, and all the artillery of popguns are prepared\r\nfor action. Poor fellows, how they foam! They set half their own\r\npartisans in laughter; for among ridiculous things nothing is more\r\nridiculous than ridiculous rage. But I hope they will not leave off. I\r\nshall lose half my greatness when they cease to lie.\r\n\r\nSo far as respects myself, I have reason to believe, and a right to say,\r\nthat the leaders of the Reign of Terror in America and the leaders of\r\nthe Reign of Terror in France, during the time of Robespierre, were in\r\ncharacter the same sort of men; or how is it to be accounted for, that\r\nI was persecuted by both at the same time? When I was voted out of\r\nthe French Convention, the reason assigned for it was, that I was a\r\nforeigner. When Robespierre had me seized in the night, and imprisoned\r\nin the Luxembourg, (where I remained eleven months,) he assigned no\r\nreason for it. But when he proposed bringing me to the tribunal, which\r\nwas like sending me at once to the scaffold, he then assigned a reason,\r\nand the reason was, _for the interests of America as well as of France,\r\n\"Pour les intérêts de l'Amérique autant que de la France_\" The words are\r\nin his own hand-writing, and reported to the Convention by the committee\r\nappointed to examine his papers, and are printed in their report, with\r\nthis reflection added to them, \"_Why Thomas Paine more than another?\r\nBecause he contributed to the liberty of both worlds_.\"(1)\r\n\r\n     1 See my \"Life of Paine,\" vol. ii., pp. 79, 81. Also, the\r\n     historical introduction to XXI., p. 330, of this volume.\r\n     Robespierre never wrote an idle word. This Paine well knew,\r\n     as Mirabeau, who said of Robespierre: \"That man will go far\r\n     he believes every word he says.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThere must have been a coalition in sentiment, if not in fact, between\r\nthe Terrorists of America and the Terrorists of France, and Robespierre\r\nmust have known it, or he could not have had the idea of putting America\r\ninto the bill of accusation against me. Yet these men, these Terrorists\r\nof the new world, who were waiting in the devotion of their hearts for\r\nthe joyful news of my destruction, are the same banditti who are now\r\nbellowing in all the hacknied language of hacknied hypocrisy, about\r\nhumanity, and piety, and often about something they call infidelity, and\r\nthey finish with the chorus of _Crucify him, crucify him_. I am become\r\nso famous among them, they cannot eat or drink without me. I serve them\r\nas a standing dish, and they cannot make up a bill of fare if I am not\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nBut there is one dish, and that the choicest of all, that they have not\r\npresented on the table, and it is time they should. They have not yet\r\n_accused Providence of Infidelity_. Yet according to their outrageous\r\npiety, she(1) must be as bad as Thomas Paine; she has protected him in\r\nall his dangers, patronized him in all his undertakings, encouraged him\r\nin all his ways, and rewarded him at last by bringing him in safety and\r\nin health to the Promised Land. This is more than she did by the Jews,\r\nthe chosen people, that they tell us she brought out of the land\r\nof Egypt, and out of the house of bondage; for they all died in the\r\nwilderness, and Moses too.\r\n\r\nI was one of the nine members that composed the first Committee of\r\nConstitution. Six of them have been destroyed. Sièyes and myself have\r\nsurvived--he by bending with the times, and I by not bending. The other\r\nsurvivor joined Robespierre, he was seized and imprisoned in his turn,\r\nand sentenced to transportation. He has since apologized to me for\r\nhaving signed the warrant, by saying he felt himself in danger and was\r\nobliged to do it.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Is this a \"survival\" of the goddess Fortuna?--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Barère.    His apology to Paine proves that a death-\r\n     warrant had been issued, for Barère did not sign the order\r\n     for Paine's arrest or imprisonment.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nHérault Sechelles, an acquaintance of Mr. Jefferson, and a good patriot,\r\nwas my _suppléant_ as member of the Committee of Constitution, that is,\r\nhe was to supply my place, if I had not accepted or had resigned, being\r\nnext in number of votes to me. He was imprisoned in the Luxembourg with\r\nme, was taken to the tribunal and the guillotine, and I, his principal,\r\nwas left.\r\n\r\nThere were two foreigners in the Convention, Anarcharsis Clootz and\r\nmyself. We were both put out of the Convention by the same vote,\r\narrested by the same order, and carried to prison together the same\r\nnight. He was taken to the guillotine, and I was again left. Joel Barlow\r\nwas with us when we went to prison.\r\n\r\nJoseph Lebon, one of the vilest characters that ever existed, and who\r\nmade the streets of Arras run with blood, was my _suppléant_, as member\r\nof the Convention for the department of the Pas de Calais. When I\r\nwas put out of the Convention he came and took my place. When I was\r\nliberated from prison and voted again into the Convention, he was sent\r\nto the same prison and took my place there, and he was sent to the\r\nguillotine instead of me. He supplied my place all the way through.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and sixty-eight persons were taken out of the Luxembourg\r\nin one night, and a hundred and sixty of them guillotined next day, of\r\nwhich I now know I was to have been one; and the manner I escaped that\r\nfate is curious, and has all the appearance of accident.\r\n\r\nThe room in which I was lodged was on the ground floor, and one of a\r\nlong range of rooms under a gallery, and the door of it opened outward\r\nand flat against the wall; so that when it was open the inside of the\r\ndoor appeared outward, and the contrary when it was shut. I had three\r\ncomrades, fellow prisoners with me, Joseph Vanhuele, of Bruges, since\r\nPresident of the Municipality of that town, Michael Rubyns, and Charles\r\nBastini of Louvain.\r\n\r\nWhen persons by scores and by hundreds were to be taken out of the\r\nprison for the guillotine it was always done in the night, and those who\r\nperformed that office had a private mark or signal, by which they knew\r\nwhat rooms to go to, and what number to take. We, as I have stated, were\r\nfour, and the door of our room was marked, unobserved by us, with that\r\nnumber in chalk; but it happened, if happening is a proper word, that\r\nthe mark was put on when the door was open, and flat against the\r\nwall, and thereby came on the inside when we shut it at night, and the\r\ndestroying angel passed by it.(1) A few days after this, Robespierre\r\nfell, and Mr. Monroe arrived and reclaimed me, and invited me to his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n     1 Painefs preface to the \"Age of Reason\" Part IL, and his\r\n     Letter to Washington (p. 222.) show that for some time after\r\n     his release from prison he had attributed his escape from\r\n     the guillotine to a fever which rendered him unconscious at\r\n     the time when his accusation was demanded by Robespierre;\r\n     but it will be seen (XXXI.) that he subsequently visited his\r\n     prison room-mate Vanhuele, who had become Mayor of Bruges,\r\n     and he may have learned from him the particulars of their\r\n     marvellous escape. Carlyle having been criticised by John G.\r\n     Alger for crediting this story of the chalk mark, an\r\n     exhaustive discussion of the facts took place in the London\r\n     Athenoum, July 7, 21, August 25, September 1, 1894, in which\r\n     it was conclusively proved, I think, that there is no reason\r\n     to doubt the truth of the incident See also my article on\r\n     Paine's escape, in The Open Court (Chicago), July 26,1894.\r\n     The discussion in the Athenoum elicited the fact that a\r\n     tradition had long existed in the family of Sampson Perry\r\n     that he had shared Paine's cell and been saved by the\r\n     curious mistake. Such is not the fact. Perry, in his book on\r\n     the French Revolution, and in his \"Argus,\" told the story of\r\n     Paine's escape by his illness, as Paine first told it; and\r\n     he also relates an anecdote which may find place here:\r\n     \"Mr. Paine speaks gratefully of the kindness shown him by his\r\n     fellow-prisoners of the same chamber during his severe\r\n     malady, and especially of the skilful and voluntary\r\n     assistance lent him by General O'Hara's surgeon. He relates\r\n     an anecdote of himself which may not be unworthy of\r\n     repeating. An arrêt of the Committee of Public Welfare had\r\n     given directions to the administrators of the palace\r\n     [Luxembourg] to enter all the prisons with additional guards\r\n     and dispossess every prisoner of his knives, forks, and\r\n     every other sharp instrument; and also to take their money\r\n     from them. This happened a short time before Mr. Paine's\r\n     illness, and as this ceremony was represented to him as an\r\n     atrocious plunder in the dregs of municipality, he\r\n     determined to avert its effect so far as it concerned\r\n     himself. He had an English bank note of some value and gold\r\n     coin in his pocket, and as he conceived the visitors would\r\n     rifle them, as well as his trunks (though they did not do so\r\n     by any one) he took off the lock from his door, and hid the\r\n     whole of what he had about him in its inside. He recovered\r\n     his health, he found his money, but missed about three\r\n     hundred of his associated prisoners, who had been sent in\r\n     crowds to the murderous tribunal, while he had been\r\n     insensible of their or his own danger.\" This was probably\r\n     the money (£200) loaned by Paine to General O'Hara (who\r\n     figured at the Yorktown surrender) in prison.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of my imprisonment, prior to the fall of Robespierre,\r\nthere was no time when I could think my life worth twenty-four hours,\r\nand my mind was made up to meet its fate. The Americans in Paris went in\r\na body to the Convention to reclaim me, but without success. There was\r\nno party among them with respect to me. My only hope then rested on the\r\ngovernment of America, that it would _remember me_. But the icy heart of\r\ningratitude, in whatever man it be placed, has neither feeling nor\r\nsense of honour. The letter of Mr. Jefferson has served to wipe away the\r\nreproach, and done justice to the mass of the people of America.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Printed in the seventh of this series of Letters.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nWhen a party was forming, in the latter end of 1777, and beginning of\r\n1778, of which John Adams was one, to remove Mr. Washington from the\r\ncommand of the army on the complaint that _he did nothing_, I wrote the\r\nfifth number of the Crisis, and published it at Lancaster, (Congress\r\nthen being at Yorktown, in Pennsylvania,) to ward off that meditated\r\nblow; for though I well knew that the black times of '76 were the\r\nnatural consequence of his want of military judgment in the choice of\r\npositions into which the army was put about New York and New Jersey, I\r\ncould see no possible advantage, and nothing but mischief, that could\r\narise by distracting the army into parties, which would have been the\r\ncase had the intended motion gone on.\r\n\r\nGeneral [Charles] Lee, who with a sarcastic genius joined a great fund\r\nof military knowledge, was perfectly right when he said \"_We have no\r\nbusiness on islands, and in the bottom of bogs, where the enemy, by the\r\naid of its ships, can bring its whole force against apart of ours and\r\nshut it up_.\" This had like to have been the case at New York, and it\r\nwas the case at Fort Washington, and would have been the case at Fort\r\nLee if General [Nathaniel] Greene had not moved instantly off on the\r\nfirst news of the enemy's approach. I was with Greene through the whole\r\nof that affair, and know it perfectly.\r\n\r\nBut though I came forward in defence of Mr. Washington when he was\r\nattacked, and made the best that could be made of a series of blunders\r\nthat had nearly ruined the country, he left me to perish when I was in\r\nprison. But as I told him of it in his life-time, I should not now bring\r\nit up if the ignorant impertinence of some of the Federal papers, who\r\nare pushing Mr. Washington forward as their stalking horse, did not make\r\nit necessary.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman did not perform his part in the Revolution better, nor\r\nwith more honour, than I did mine, and the one part was as necessary\r\nas the other. He accepted as a present, (though he was already rich,)\r\na hundred thousand acres of land in America, and left me to occupy six\r\nfoot of earth in France.(1) I wish, for his own reputation, he had acted\r\nwith more justice. But it was always known of Mr. Washington, by\r\nthose who best knew him, that he was of such an icy and death-like\r\nconstitution, that he neither loved his friends nor hated his enemies.\r\nBut, be this as it may, I see no reason that a difference between Mr.\r\nWashington and me should be made a theme of discord with other people.\r\nThere are those who may see merit in both, without making themselves\r\npartisans of either, and with this reflection I close the subject.\r\n\r\n     1 Paine was mistaken, as many others were, about the gifts\r\n     of Virginia (1785) to Washington. They were 100 shares, of\r\n     $100 each, in the James River Company, and 50 shares, of\r\n     £100 each, in the Potomac Company. Washington, accepted on\r\n     condition that he might appropriate them _to public uses_\r\n     which was done in his Will.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAs to the hypocritical abuse thrown out by the Federalists on other\r\nsubjects, I recommend to them the observance of a commandment that\r\nexisted before either Christian or Jew existed:\r\n\r\n     Thou shalt make a covenant with thy senses:\r\n     With thine eye  that it behold no evil,\r\n     With thine ear, that it hear no evil,\r\n     With thy tongue, that it speak no evil,\r\n     With thy hands, that they commit no evil.\r\n\r\nIf the Federalists will follow this commandment, they will leave off\r\nlying.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nFederal City, Lovett's Hotel, Nov. 26,1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, Dec. 6th. 1802.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nAs Congress is on the point of meeting, the public papers will\r\nnecessarily be occupied with the debates of the ensuing session, and\r\nas, in consequence of my long absence from America, my private affairs\r\nrequire my attendance, (for it is necessary I do this, or I could not\r\npreserve, as I do, my independence,) I shall close my address to the\r\npublic with this letter.\r\n\r\nI congratulate them on the success of the late elections, and _that_\r\nwith the additional confidence, that while honest men are chosen and\r\nwise measures pursued, neither the treason of apostacy, masked under the\r\nname of Federalism, of which I have spoken in my second letter, nor the\r\nintrigues of foreign emissaries, acting in concert with that mask, can\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nAs to the licentiousness of the papers calling themselves _Federal_, a\r\nname that apostacy has taken, it can hurt nobody but the party or the\r\npersons who support such papers. There is naturally a wholesome pride\r\nin the public mind that revolts at open vulgarity. It feels itself\r\ndishonoured even by hearing it, as a chaste woman feels dishonour by\r\nhearing obscenity she cannot avoid. It can smile at wit, or be diverted\r\nwith strokes of satirical humour, but it detests the _blackguard_. The\r\nsame sense of propriety that governs in private companies, governs in\r\npublic life. If a man in company runs his wit upon another, it may draw\r\na smile from some persons present, but as soon as he turns a blackguard\r\nin his language the company gives him up; and it is the same in public\r\nlife. The event of the late election shows this to be true; for in\r\nproportion as those papers have become more and more vulgar and abusive,\r\nthe elections have gone more and more against the party they support,\r\nor that supports them. Their predecessor, _Porcupine_ [Cobbett] had\r\nwit--these scribblers have none. But as soon as his _blackguardism_ (for\r\nit is the proper name of it) outran his wit, he was abandoned by every\r\nbody but the English Minister who protected him.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish proverb says, \"_there never was a cover large enough to hide\r\nitself_\"; and the proverb applies to the case of those papers and the\r\nshattered remnant of the faction that supports them. The falsehoods they\r\nfabricate, and the abuse they circulate, is a cover to hide something\r\nfrom being seen, but it is not large enough to hide itself. It is as\r\na tub thrown out to the whale to prevent its attacking and sinking the\r\nvessel. They want to draw the attention of the public from thinking\r\nabout, or inquiring into, the measures of the late administration, and\r\nthe reason why so much public money was raised and expended; and so far\r\nas a lie today, and a new one tomorrow, will answer this purpose, it\r\nanswers theirs. It is nothing to them whether they be believed or not,\r\nfor if the negative purpose be answered the main point is answered, to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe that picks your pocket always tries to make you look another way.\r\n\"Look,\" says he, \"at yon man t'other side the street--what a nose he has\r\ngot?--Lord, yonder is a chimney on fire!--Do you see yon man going along\r\nin the salamander great coat? That is the very man that stole one of\r\nJupiter's satellites, and sold it to a countryman for a gold watch,\r\nand it set his breeches on fire!\" Now the man that has his hand in your\r\npocket, does not care a farthing whether you believe what he says or\r\nnot. All his aim is to prevent your looking at _him_; and this is the\r\ncase with the remnant of the Federal faction. The leaders of it have\r\nimposed upon the country, and they want to turn the attention of it from\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIn taking up any public matter, I have never made it a consideration,\r\nand never will, whether it be popular or unpopular; but whether it be\r\n_right_ or _wrong_. The right will always become the popular, if it has\r\ncourage to show itself, and the shortest way is always a straight line.\r\nI despise expedients, they are the gutter-hole of politics, and the sink\r\nwhere reputation dies. In the present case, as in every other, I\r\ncannot be accused of using any; and I have no doubt but thousands will\r\nhereafter be ready to say, as Gouverneur Morris said to me, after having\r\nabused me pretty handsomely in Congress for the opposition I gave\r\nthe fraudulent demand of Silas Deane of two thousand pounds sterling:\r\n\"_Well, we were all duped, and I among the rest!_\"(1)\r\n\r\n     1 See vol. I., chapters xxii., xxiii., xxiv., of this work.\r\n     Also my \"Life of Paine,\" vol. I., ch. ix., x.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nWere the late administration to be called upon to give reasons for\r\nthe expence it put the country to, it can give none. The danger of an\r\ninvasion was a bubble that served as a cover to raise taxes and armies\r\nto be employed on some other purpose. But if the people of America\r\nbelieved it true, the cheerfulness with which they supported those\r\nmeasures and paid those taxes is an evidence of their patriotism; and\r\nif they supposed me their enemy, though in that supposition they did me\r\ninjustice, it was not injustice in them. He that acts as he believes,\r\nthough he may act wrong, is not conscious of wrong.\r\n\r\nBut though there was no danger, no thanks are due to the late\r\nadministration for it. They sought to blow up a flame between the two\r\ncountries; and so intent were they upon this, that they went out of\r\ntheir way to accomplish it. In a letter which the Secretary of State,\r\nTimothy Pickering, wrote to Mr. Skipwith, the American Consul at Paris,\r\nhe broke off from the official subject of his letter, to _thank God_ in\r\nvery exulting language, _that the Russians had cut the French army\r\nto pieces_. Mr. Skipwith, after showing me the letter, very prudently\r\nconcealed it.\r\n\r\nIt was the injudicious and wicked acrimony of this letter, and some\r\nother like conduct of the then Secretary of State, that occasioned me,\r\nin a letter to a friend in the government, to say, that if there was any\r\nofficial business to be done in France, till a regular Minister could\r\nbe appointed, it could not be trusted to a more proper person than Mr.\r\nSkipwith. \"_He is_,\" said I, \"_an honest man, and will do business, and\r\nthat with good manners to the government he is commissioned to act with.\r\nA faculty which that BEAR, Timothy Pickering, wanted, and which the BEAR\r\nof that bear, John Adams, never possessed_.\"(2)\r\n\r\n     2 By reference to the letter itself (p. 376 of this volume)\r\n     it will be seen that Paine here quotes it from memory.--\r\n     _Editor._ vol III--\r\n\r\nIn another letter to the same friend, in 1797, and which was put\r\nunsealed under cover to Colonel Burr, I expressed a satisfaction\r\nthat Mr. Jefferson, since he was not president, had accepted the\r\nvice presidency; \"_for_,\" said I, \"_John Adams has such a talent for\r\nblundering and offending, it will be necessary to keep an eye over\r\nhim_.\" He has now sufficiently proved, that though I have not the spirit\r\nof prophecy, I have the gift of _judging right_. And all the world\r\nknows, for it cannot help knowing, that to judge _rightly_ and to write\r\n_clearly_, and that upon all sorts of subjects, to be able to command\r\nthought and as it were to play with it at pleasure, and be always master\r\nof one's temper in writing, is the faculty only of a serene mind, and\r\nthe attribute of a happy and philosophical temperament. The scribblers,\r\nwho know me not, and who fill their papers with paragraphs about me,\r\nbesides their want of talents, drink too many slings and drams in a\r\nmorning to have any chance with me. But, poor fellows, they must do\r\nsomething for the little pittance they get from their employers. This is\r\nmy apology for them.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety to get back to America was great for many years. It is the\r\ncountry of my heart, and the place of my political and literary birth.\r\nIt was the American revolution that made me an author, and forced into\r\naction the mind that had been dormant, and had no wish for public life,\r\nnor has it now. By the accounts I received, she appeared to me to be\r\ngoing wrong, and that some meditated treason against her liberties\r\nlurked at the bottom of her government. I heard that my friends were\r\noppressed, and I longed to take my stand among them, and if other times\r\nto _try mens souls_ were to arrive, that I might bear my share. But my\r\nefforts to return were ineffectual.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr. Monroe had made a good standing with the French\r\ngovernment, for the conduct of his predecessor [Morris] had made his\r\nreception as Minister difficult, he wanted to send despatches to his own\r\ngovernment by a person to whom he could confide a verbal communication,\r\nand he fixed his choice on me. He then applied to the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety for a passport; but as I had been voted again into the\r\nConvention, it was only the Convention that could give the passport;\r\nand as an application to them for that purpose, would have made my going\r\npublicly known, I was obliged to sustain the disappointment, and Mr.\r\nMonroe to lose the opportunity.(1)\r\n\r\nWhen that gentleman left France to return to America, I was to have\r\ngone with him. It was fortunate I did not. The vessel he sailed in was\r\nvisited by a British frigate, that searched every part of it, and down\r\nto the hold, for Thomas Paine.(2) I then went, the same year, to embark\r\nat Havre. But several British frigates were cruizing in sight of the\r\nport who knew I was there, and I had to return again to Paris. Seeing\r\nmyself thus cut off from every opportunity that was in my power to\r\ncommand, I wrote to Mr. Jefferson, that, if the fate of the election\r\nshould put him in the chair of the presidency, and he should have\r\noccasion to send a frigate to France, he would give me the opportunity\r\nof returning by it, which he did. But I declined coming by the\r\n_Maryland_, the vessel that was offered me, and waited for the frigate\r\nthat was to bring the new Minister, Mr. Chancellor Livingston, to\r\nFrance. But that frigate was ordered round to the Mediterranean; and\r\nas at that time the war was over, and the British cruisers called in,\r\nI could come any way. I then agreed to come with Commodore Barney in a\r\nvessel he had engaged. It was again fortunate I did not, for the vessel\r\nsank at sea, and the people were preserved in the boat.\r\n\r\n     1 The correspondence is in my \"Life of Paine,\" vol. ii.,\r\n     pp. 154-5.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 The \"Dublin Packet,\" Captain Clay, in whom Paine, as he\r\n     wrote to Jefferson, \"had  no confidence.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nHad half the number of evils befallen me that the number of dangers\r\namount to through which I have been pre-served, there are those who\r\nwould ascribe it to the wrath of heaven; why then do they not ascribe\r\nmy preservation to the protecting favour of heaven? Even in my worldly\r\nconcerns I have been blessed. The little property I left in America,\r\nand which I cared nothing about, not even to receive the rent of it,\r\nhas been increasing in the value of its capital more than eight hundred\r\ndollars every year, for the fourteen years and more that I have been\r\nabsent from it. I am now in my circumstances independent; and my economy\r\nmakes me rich. As to my health, it is perfectly good, and I leave the\r\nworld to judge of the stature of my mind. I am in every instance a\r\nliving contradiction to the mortified Federalists.\r\n\r\nIn my publications, I follow the rule I began with in _Common Sense_,\r\nthat is, to consult nobody, nor to let any body see what I write till\r\nit appears publicly. Were I to do otherwise, the case would be, that\r\nbetween the timidity of some, who are so afraid of doing wrong that they\r\nnever do right, the puny judgment of others, and the despicable craft of\r\npreferring _expedient to right_, as if the world was a world of babies\r\nin leading strings, I should get forward with nothing. My path is a\r\nright line, as straight and clear to me as a ray of light. The boldness\r\n(if they will have it to be so) with which I speak on any subject, is a\r\ncompliment to the judgment of the reader. It is like saying to him,\r\n_I treat you as a man and not as a child_. With respect to any worldly\r\nobject, as it is impossible to discover any in me, therefore what I do,\r\nand my manner of doing it, ought to be ascribed to a good motive.\r\n\r\nIn a great affair, where the happiness of man is at stake, I love\r\nto work for nothing; and so fully am I under the influence of this\r\nprinciple, that I should lose the spirit, the pleasure, and the pride\r\nof it, were I conscious that I looked for reward; and with this\r\ndeclaration, I take my leave for the present.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The self-assertion of this and other letters about this\r\n     time was really self-defence, the invective against him, and\r\n     the calumnies, being such as can hardly be credited by those\r\n     not familiar with the publications of that time.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nFederal City, Lovett's Hotel, Dec. 3, 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, Feb., 1803. In the Tarions\r\n     collections of these Letters there appears at this point a\r\n     correspondence between Paine and Samuel Adams of Boston, but\r\n     as it relates to religious matters I reserve it for the\r\n     fourth volume.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nIt is always the interest of a far greater part of the nation to have\r\na thing right than to have it wrong; and therefore, in a country whose\r\ngovernment is founded on the system of election and representation, the\r\nfate of every party is decided by its principles.\r\n\r\nAs this system is the only form and principle of government by which\r\nliberty can be preserved, and the only one that can embrace all the\r\nvarieties of a great extent of country, it necessarily follows, that to\r\nhave the representation real, the election must be real; and that where\r\nthe election is a fiction, the representation is a fiction also. _Like\r\nwill always produce like_.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said and written concerning the conduct of Mr.\r\nBurr, during the late contest, in the federal legislature, whether Mr.\r\nJefferson or Mr. Burr should be declared President of the United States.\r\nMr. Burr has been accused of intriguing to obtain the Presidency.\r\nWhether this charge be substantiated or not makes little or no part of\r\nthe purport of this letter. There is a point of much higher importance\r\nto attend to than any thing that relates to the individual Mr. Burr: for\r\nthe great point is not whether Mr. Burr has intrigued, but whether the\r\nlegislature has intrigued with _him_.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden, a relation of one of the senators of New Jersey of the same\r\nname, and of the party assuming the style of Federalists, has written\r\na letter published in the New York papers, signed with his name, the\r\npurport of which is to exculpate Mr. Burr from the charges brought\r\nagainst him. In this letter he says:\r\n\r\n\"When about to return from Washington, two or three _members of\r\nCongress_ of the federal party spoke to me of _their views_, as to the\r\nelection of a president, desiring me to converse with Colonel Burr on\r\nthe subject, and to ascertain _whether he would enter into terms_. On my\r\nreturn to New York I called on Colonel Burr, and communicated the above\r\nto him. He explicitly declined the explanation, and _did neither propose\r\nnor agree to any terms_.\"\r\n\r\nHow nearly is human cunning allied to folly! The animals to whom nature\r\nhas given the faculty we call _cunning_, know always when to use it,\r\nand use it wisely; but when man descends to cunning, he blunders and\r\nbetrays.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden's letter is intended to exculpate Mr. Burr from the charge\r\nof intriguing to obtain the presidency; and the letter that he (Ogden)\r\nwrites for this purpose is direct evidence against his party in\r\nCongress, that they intrigued with Burr to obtain him for President,\r\nand employed him (Ogden) for the purpose. To save _Aaron_, he betrays\r\n_Moses_, and then turns informer against the _Golden Calf_.\r\n\r\nIt is but of little importance to the world to know if Mr. Burr\r\n_listened_ to an intriguing proposal, but it is of great importance to\r\nthe constituents to know if their representatives in Congress made one.\r\nThe ear can commit no crime, but the tongue may; and therefore the right\r\npolicy is to drop Mr. Burr, as being only the hearer, and direct the\r\nwhole charge against the Federal faction in Congress as the active\r\noriginal culprit, or, if the priests will have scripture for it, as the\r\nserpent that beguiled Eve.\r\n\r\n     1 In the presidential canvas of 1800, the votes in the\r\n     electoral college being equally divided between Burr and\r\n     Jefferson, the election was thrown into the House of\r\n     Representatives. Jefferson was elected on the 36th ballot,\r\n     but he never forgave Burr, and between these two old friends\r\n     Paine had to write this letter under some embarrassment. The\r\n     last paragraph of this Letter shows Paine's desire for a\r\n     reconciliation between Burr and Jefferson. Aaron Burr is one\r\n     of the traditionally slandered figures of American history.\r\n     --_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe plot of the intrigue was to make Mr. Burr President, on the private\r\ncondition of his agreeing to, and entering into, terms with them, that\r\nis, with the proposers. Had then the election been made, the country,\r\nknowing nothing of this private and illegal transaction, would have\r\nsupposed, for who could have supposed otherwise, that it had a President\r\naccording to the forms, principles, and intention of the constitution.\r\nNo such thing. Every form, principle, and intention of the constitution\r\nwould have been violated; and instead of a President, it would have had\r\na mute, a sort of image, hand-bound and tongue-tied, the dupe and slave\r\nof a party, placed on the theatre of the United States, and acting the\r\nfarce of President.\r\n\r\nIt is of little importance, in a constitutional sense, to know what the\r\nterms to be proposed might be, because any terms other than those which\r\nthe constitution prescribes to a President are criminal. Neither do I\r\nsee how Mr. Burr, or any other person put in the same condition, could\r\nhave taken the oath prescribed by the constitution to a President, which\r\nis, \"_I do solemnly swear (or affirm,) that I will faithfully execute\r\nthe office of President of the United States, and will to the best of\r\nmy ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates_.\"\r\n\r\nHow, I ask, could such a person have taken such an oath, knowing at the\r\nsame time that he had entered into the Presidency on terms unknown\r\nin the Constitution, and private, and which would deprive him of the\r\nfreedom and power of acting as President of the United States, agreeably\r\nto his constitutional oath?\r\n\r\nMr. Burr, by not agreeing to terms, has escaped the danger to which\r\nthey exposed him, and the perjury that would have followed, and also\r\nthe punishment annexed thereto. Had he accepted the Presidency on\r\nterms unknown in the constitution, and private, and had the transaction\r\nafterwards transpired, (which it most probably would, for roguery is a\r\nthing difficult to conceal,) it would have produced a sensation in the\r\ncountry too violent to be quieted, and too just to be resisted; and in\r\nany case the election must have been void.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to think of those members of Congress, who having taken\r\nan oath of the same constitutional import as the oath of the President,\r\nviolate that oath by tampering to obtain a President on private\r\nconditions. If this is not sedition against the constitution and the\r\ncountry, it is difficult to define what sedition in a representative can\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nSay not that this statement of the case is the effect of personal or\r\nparty resentment. No. It is the effect of _sincere concern_ that such\r\ncorruption, of which this is but a sample, should, in the space of a few\r\nyears, have crept into a country that had the fairest opportunity that\r\nProvidence ever gave, within the knowledge of history, of making itself\r\nan illustrious example to the world.\r\n\r\nWhat the terms were, or were to be, it is probable we never shall know;\r\nor what is more probable, that feigned ones, if any, will be given. But\r\nfrom the conduct of the party since that time we may conclude, that no\r\ntaxes would have been taken off, that the clamour for war would have\r\nbeen kept up, new expences incurred, and taxes and offices increased\r\nin consequence; and, among the articles of a private nature, that\r\nthe leaders in this seditious traffic were to stipulate with the mock\r\nPresident for lucrative appointments for themselves.\r\n\r\nBut if these plotters against the Constitution understood their\r\nbusiness, and they had been plotting long enough to be masters of it, a\r\nsingle article would have comprehended every thing, which is, _That the\r\nPresident (thus made) should be governed in all cases whatsoever by a\r\nprivate junto appointed by themselves_. They could then, through the\r\nmedium of a mock President, have negatived all bills which their\r\nparty in Congress could not have opposed with success, and reduced\r\nrepresentation to a nullity.\r\n\r\nThe country has been imposed upon, and the real culprits are but few;\r\nand as it is necessary for the peace, harmony, and honour of the Union,\r\nto separate the deceiver from the deceived, the betrayer from the\r\nbetrayed, that men who once were friends, and that in the worst of\r\ntimes, should be friends again, it is necessary, as a beginning, that\r\nthis dark business be brought to full investigation. Ogden's letter\r\nis direct evidence of the fact of tampering to obtain a conditional\r\nPresident. He knows the two or three members of Congress that\r\ncommissioned him, and they know who commissioned them.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nFederal City, Lovett's Hotel, Jan. 29th, 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The Aurora (Philadelphia).--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nReligion and War is the cry of the Federalists; Morality and Peace the\r\nvoice of Republicans. The union of Morality and Peace is congenial;\r\nbut that of Religion and War is a paradox, and the solution of it is\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Federalists have no judgment; their plans no\r\nconsistency of parts; and want of consistency is the natural consequence\r\nof want of principle.\r\n\r\nThey exhibit to the world the curious spectacle of an _Opposition_\r\nwithout a _cause_, and conduct without system. Were they, as doctors,\r\nto prescribe medicine as they practise politics, they would poison their\r\npatients with destructive compounds.\r\n\r\nThere are not two things more opposed to each other than War and\r\nReligion; and yet, in the double game those leaders have to play, the\r\none is necessarily the theme of their politics, and the other the text\r\nof their sermons. The week-day orator of Mars, and the Sunday preacher\r\nof Federal Grace, play like gamblers into each other's hands, and this\r\nthey call Religion.\r\n\r\nThough hypocrisy can counterfeit every virtue, and become the associate\r\nof every vice, it requires a great dexterity of craft to give it the\r\npower of deceiving. A painted sun may glisten, but it cannot warm. For\r\nhypocrisy to personate virtue successfully it must know and feel what\r\nvirtue is, and as it cannot long do this, it cannot long deceive.\r\nWhen an orator foaming for War breathes forth in another sentence a\r\n_plaintive piety of words_, he may as well write hypocrisy on his front.\r\n\r\nThe late attempt of the Federal leaders in Congress (for they acted\r\nwithout the knowledge of their constituents) to plunge the country into\r\nWar, merits not only reproach but indignation. It was madness, conceived\r\nin ignorance and acted in wickedness. The head and the heart went\r\npartners in the crime.\r\n\r\nA neglect of punctuality in the performance of a treaty is made\r\na _cause_ of war by the _Barbary powers_, and of remonstrance and\r\nexplanation by _civilised powers_. The Mahometans of Barbary negociate\r\nby the sword--they seize first, and ex-postulate afterwards; and the\r\nfederal leaders have been labouring to _barbarize_ the United States by\r\nadopting the practice of the Barbary States, and this they call honour.\r\nLet their honour and their hypocrisy go weep together, for both are\r\ndefeated. Their present Administration is too moral for hypocrites, and\r\ntoo economical for public spendthrifts.\r\n\r\nA man the least acquainted with diplomatic affairs must know that a\r\nneglect in punctuality is not one of the legal causes of war, unless\r\nthat neglect be confirmed by a refusal to perform; and even then it\r\ndepends upon circumstances connected with it. The world would be in\r\ncontinual quarrels and war, and commerce be annihilated, if Algerine\r\npolicy was the law of nations. And were America, instead of becoming an\r\nexample to the old world of good and moral government and civil manners,\r\nor, if they like it better, of gentlemanly conduct towards other\r\nnations, to set up the character of ruffian, that of _word and blow, and\r\nthe blow first_, and thereby give the example of pulling down the little\r\nthat civilization has gained upon barbarism, her Independence, instead\r\nof being an honour and a blessing, would become a curse upon the world\r\nand upon herself.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Barbary powers, though unjust in principle, is suited\r\nto their prejudices, situation, and circumstances. The crusades of the\r\nchurch to exterminate them fixed in their minds the unobliterated belief\r\nthat every Christian power was their mortal enemy. Their religious\r\nprejudices, therefore, suggest the policy, which their situation and\r\ncircumstances protect them in. As a people, they are neither commercial\r\nnor agricultural, they neither import nor export, have no property\r\nfloating on the seas, nor ships and cargoes in the ports of foreign\r\nnations. No retaliation, therefore, can be acted upon them, and they sin\r\nsecure from punishment.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the case with the United States. If she sins as a\r\nBarbary power, she must answer for it as a Civilized one. Her commerce\r\nis continually passing on the seas exposed to capture, and her ships\r\nand cargoes in foreign ports to detention and reprisal. An act of War\r\ncommitted by her in the Mississippi would produce a War against the\r\ncommerce of the Atlantic States, and the latter would have to curse the\r\npolicy that provoked the former. In every point, therefore, in which the\r\ncharacter and interest of the United States be considered, it would\r\nill become her to set an example contrary to the policy and custom of\r\nCivilized powers, and practised only by the Barbary powers, that of\r\nstriking before she expostulates.\r\n\r\nBut can any man, calling himself a Legislator, and supposed by his\r\nconstituents to know something of his duty, be so ignorant as to imagine\r\nthat seizing on New Orleans would finish the affair or even contribute\r\ntowards it? On the contrary it would have made it worse. The treaty\r\nright of deposite at New Orleans, and the right of the navigation of the\r\nMississippi into the Gulph of Mexico, are distant things. New Orleans is\r\nmore than an hundred miles in the country from the mouth of the river,\r\nand, as a place of deposite, is of no value if the mouth of the river be\r\nshut, which either France or Spain could do, and which our possession\r\nof New Orleans could neither prevent or remove. New Orleans in our\r\npossession, by an act of hostility, would have become a blockaded\r\nport, and consequently of no value to the western people as a place of\r\ndeposite. Since, therefore, an interruption had arisen to the commerce\r\nof the western states, and until the matter could be brought to a fair\r\nexplanation, it was of less injury to have the port shut and the river\r\nopen, than to have the river shut and the port in our possession.\r\n\r\nThat New Orleans could be taken required no stretch of policy to plan,\r\nnor spirit of enterprize to effect. It was like marching behind a man to\r\nknock him down: and the dastardly slyness of such an attack would have\r\nstained the fame of the United States. Where there is no danger cowards\r\nare bold, and Captain Bobadils are to be found in the Senate as well\r\nas on the stage. Even _Gouverneur_, on such a march, dare have shown a\r\nleg.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Gouverneur Morris being now leader of the belligerent\r\n     faction in Congress, Paine could not resist the temptation\r\n     to allude to a well-known incident (related in his Diary and\r\n     Letters, i., p. 14). A mob in Paris having surrounded his\r\n     fine carriage, crying \"Aristocrat!\" Morris showed his\r\n     wooden leg, declaring he had lost his leg in the cause of\r\n     American liberty. Morris was never in any fight, his leg\r\n     being lost by a commonplace accident while driving in\r\n     Philadelphia. Although Paine's allusion may appear in bad\r\n     taste, even with this reference, it was politeness itself\r\n     compared with the brutal abuse which Morris (not content\r\n     with imprisoning Paine in Paris) and his adherents were\r\n     heaping on the author on his return to America; also on\r\n     Monroe, whom Jefferson had returned to France to negotiate\r\n     for the purchase of Louisiana.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nThe people of the western country to whom the Mississippi serves as\r\nan inland sea to their commerce, must be supposed to understand the\r\ncircumstances of that commerce better than a man who is a stranger to\r\nit; and as they have shown no approbation of the war-whoop measures of\r\nthe Federal senators, it becomes presumptive evidence they disapprove\r\nthem. This is a new mortification for those war-whoop politicians; for\r\nthe case is, that finding themselves losing ground and withering away in\r\nthe Atlantic States, they laid hold of the affair of New Orleans in the\r\nvain hope of rooting and reinforcing themselves in the western States;\r\nand they did this without perceiving that it was one of those ill judged\r\nhypocritical expedients in politics, that whether it succeeded or failed\r\nthe event would be the same. Had their motion [that of Ross and Morris]\r\nsucceeded, it would have endangered the commerce of the Atlantic States\r\nand ruined their reputation there; and on the other hand the attempt\r\nto make a tool of the western people was so badly concealed as to\r\nextinguish all credit with them.\r\n\r\nBut hypocrisy is a vice of sanguine constitution. It flatters and\r\npromises itself every thing; and it has yet to learn, with respect to\r\nmoral and political reputation, it is less dangerous to offend than to\r\ndeceive.\r\n\r\nTo the measures of administration, supported by the firmness and\r\nintegrity of the majority in Congress, the United States owe, as far as\r\nhuman means are concerned, the preservation of peace, and of national\r\nhonour. The confidence which the western people reposed in the\r\ngovernment and their representatives is rewarded with success. They are\r\nreinstated in their rights with the least possible loss of time; and\r\ntheir harmony with the people of New Orleans, so necessary to the\r\nprosperity of the United States, which would have been broken, and the\r\nseeds of discord sown in its place, had hostilities been preferred to\r\naccommodation, remains unimpaired. Have the Federal ministers of the\r\nchurch meditated on these matters? and laying aside, as they ought to\r\ndo, their electioneering and vindictive prayers and sermons, returned\r\nthanks that peace is preserved, and commerce, without the stain of\r\nblood?\r\n\r\nIn the pleasing contemplation of this state of things the mind, by\r\ncomparison, carries itself back to those days of uproar and extravagance\r\nthat marked the career of the former administration, and decides, by\r\nthe unstudied impulse of its own feelings, that something must then have\r\nbeen wrong. Why was it, that America, formed for happiness, and remote\r\nby situation and circumstances from the troubles and tumults of the\r\nEuropean world, became plunged into its vortex and contaminated with its\r\ncrimes? The answer is easy. Those who were then at the head of affairs\r\nwere apostates from the principles of the revolution. Raised to an\r\nelevation they had not a right to expect, nor judgment to conduct,\r\nthey became like feathers in the air, and blown about by every puff of\r\npassion or conceit.\r\n\r\nCandour would find some apology for their conduct if want of judgment\r\nwas their only defect. But error and crime, though often alike in their\r\nfeatures, are distant in their characters and in their origin. The one\r\nhas its source in the weakness of the head, the other in the hardness\r\nof the heart, and the coalition of the two, describes the former\r\nAdministration.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 That of John Adams.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nHad no injurious consequences arisen from the conduct of that\r\nAdministration, it might have passed for error or imbecility, and\r\nbeen permitted to die and be forgotten. The grave is kind to innocent\r\noffence. But even innocence, when it is a cause of injury, ought to\r\nundergo an enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe country, during the time of the former Administration, was kept in\r\ncontinual agitation and alarm; and that no investigation might be made\r\ninto its conduct, it entrenched itself within a magic circle of terror,\r\nand called it a SEDITION LAW.(1) Violent and mysterious in its measures\r\nand arrogant in its manners, it affected to disdain information, and\r\ninsulted the principles that raised it from obscurity. John Adams and\r\nTimothy Pickering were men whom nothing but the accidents of the times\r\nrendered visible on the political horizon. Elevation turned their heads,\r\nand public indignation hath cast them to the ground. But an inquiry\r\ninto the conduct and measures of that Administration is nevertheless\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe country was put to great expense. Loans, taxes, and standing armies\r\nbecame the standing order of the day. The militia, said Secretary\r\nPickering, are not to be depended upon, and fifty thousand men must be\r\nraised. For what? No cause to justify such measures has yet appeared. No\r\ndiscovery of such a cause has yet been made. The pretended Sedition Law\r\nshut up the sources of investigation, and the precipitate flight of John\r\nAdams closed the scene. But the matter ought not to sleep here.\r\n\r\nIt is not to gratify resentment, or encourage it in others, that I enter\r\nupon this subject. It is not in the power of man to accuse me of a\r\npersecuting spirit. But some explanation ought to be had. The motives\r\nand objects respecting the extraordinary and expensive measures of the\r\nformer Administration ought to be known. The Sedition Law, that shield\r\nof the moment, prevented it then, and justice demands it now. If the\r\npublic have been imposed upon, it is proper they should know it; for\r\nwhere judgment is to act, or a choice is to be made, knowledge is first\r\nnecessary. The conciliation of parties, if it does not grow out of\r\nexplanation, partakes of the character of collusion or indifference.\r\n\r\n     1 Passed July 14, 1798, to continue until March 3, 1801.\r\n     This Act, described near the close of this Letter, and one\r\n     passed June 35th, giving the President despotic powers over\r\n     aliens in the United States, constituted the famous \"Alien\r\n     and Sedition Laws.\" Hamilton opposed them, and rightly saw\r\n     in them the suicide of the Federal party.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nThere has been guilt somewhere; and it is better to fix it where\r\nit belongs, and separate the deceiver from the deceived, than that\r\nsuspicion, the bane of society, should range at large, and sour the\r\npublic mind. The military measures that were proposed and carrying on\r\nduring the former administration, could not have for their object the\r\ndefence of the country against invasion. This is a case that decides\r\nitself; for it is self evident, that while the war raged in Europe,\r\nneither France nor England could spare a man to send to America. The\r\nobject, therefore, must be something at home, and that something was the\r\noverthrow of the representative system of government, for it could be\r\nnothing else. But the plotters got into confusion and became enemies to\r\neach other. Adams hated and was jealous of Hamilton, and Hamilton hated\r\nand despised both Adams and Washington.(1) Surly Timothy stood aloof, as\r\nhe did at the affair of Lexington, and the part that fell to the public\r\nwas to pay the expense.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Hamilton's bitter pamphlet against Adams appeared in 1800,\r\n     but his old quarrel with Washington (1781) had apparently\r\n     healed. Yet, despite the favors lavished by Washington on\r\n     Hamilton, there is no certainty that the latter ever changed\r\n     his unfavorable opinion of the former, as expressed in a\r\n     letter to General Schuylor, Feb. 18, 1781 (Lodge's\r\n     \"Hamilton's Works,\" vol. viii., p. 35).--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Colonel Pickering's failure, in 1775, to march his Salem\r\n     troops in time to intercept the British retreat from\r\n     Lexington was attributed to his half-heartedness\r\n     in the patriotic cause.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBut ought a people who, but a few years ago, were fighting the battles\r\nof the world, for liberty had no home but here, ought such a people\r\nto stand quietly by and see that liberty undermined by apostacy\r\nand overthrown by intrigue? Let the tombs of the slain recall their\r\nrecollection, and the forethought of what their children are to be\r\nrevive and fix in their hearts the love of liberty.\r\n\r\nIf the former administration can justify its conduct, give it the\r\nopportunity. The manner in which John Adams disappeared from the\r\ngovernment renders an inquiry the more necessary. He gave some account\r\nof himself, lame and confused as it was, to certain _eastern wise men_\r\nwho came to pay homage to him on his birthday. But if he thought it\r\nnecessary to do this, ought he not to have rendered an account to\r\nthe public. They had a right to expect it of him. In that tête-à-tête\r\naccount, he says, \"Some measures were the effect of imperious necessity,\r\nmuch against my inclination.\" What measures does Mr. Adams mean, and\r\nwhat is the imperious necessity to which he alludes? \"Others (says he)\r\nwere measures of the Legislature, which, although approved when passed,\r\nwere never previously proposed or recommended by me.\" What measures,\r\nit may be asked, were those, for the public have a right to know the\r\nconduct of their representatives? \"Some (says he) left to my discretion\r\nwere never executed, because no necessity for them, in my judgment, ever\r\noccurred.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does this dark apology, mixed with accusation, amount to, but\r\nto increase and confirm the suspicion that something was wrong?\r\nAdministration only was possessed of foreign official information,\r\nand it was only upon that information communicated by him publicly or\r\nprivately, or to Congress, that Congress could act; and it is not in\r\nthe power of Mr. Adams to show, from the condition of the belligerent\r\npowers, that any imperious necessity called for the warlike and\r\nexpensive measures of his Administration.\r\n\r\nWhat the correspondence between Administration and Rufus King in London,\r\nor Quincy Adams in Holland, or Berlin, might be, is but little known.\r\nThe public papers have told us that the former became cup-bearer from\r\nthe London underwriters to Captain Truxtun,(1) for which, as Minister\r\nfrom a neutral nation, he ought to have been censured. It is, however,\r\na feature that marks the politics of the Minister, and hints at the\r\ncharacter of the correspondence.\r\n\r\n     1 Thomas Truxtun (1755-1822), for having captured the French\r\n     frigate \"L'Insurgente,\" off Hen's Island, 1799, was\r\n     presented at Lloyd's coffee-house with plate to the value of\r\n     600 guineas. Rufus King (1755-1827), made Minister to England\r\n     in 1796, continued under Adams, and for two years under\r\n     Jefferson's administration.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nI know that it is the opinion of several members of both houses of\r\nCongress, that an enquiry, with respect to the conduct of the late\r\nAdministration, ought to be gone into. The convulsed state into which\r\nthe country has been thrown will be best settled by a full and fair\r\nexposition of the conduct of that Administration, and the causes and\r\nobject of that conduct. To be deceived, or to remain deceived, can be\r\nthe interest of no man who seeks the public good; and it is the deceiver\r\nonly, or one interested in the deception, that can wish to preclude\r\nenquiry.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion against the late Administration is, that it was plotting\r\nto overturn the representative system of government, and that it spread\r\nalarms of invasions that had no foundation, as a pretence for raising\r\nand establishing a military force as the means of accomplishing that\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe law, called the Sedition Law, enacted, that if any person should\r\nwrite or publish, or cause to be written or published, any libel\r\n[without defining what a libel is] against the Government of the United\r\nStates, or either house of congress, or against the President, he\r\nshould be punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, and by\r\nimprisonment not exceeding two years.\r\n\r\nBut it is a much greater crime for a president to plot against a\r\nConstitution and the liberties of the people, than for an individual to\r\nplot against a President; and consequently, John Adams is accountable to\r\nthe public for his conduct, as the individuals under his administration\r\nwere to the sedition law.\r\n\r\nThe object, however, of an enquiry, in this case, is not to punish, but\r\nto satisfy; and to shew, by example, to future administrations, that an\r\nabuse of power and trust, however disguised by appearances, or rendered\r\nplausible by pretence, is one time or other to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nBORDENTOWN, ON THE DELAWARE,\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, March 12, 1803. vol. III--27\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\n     EDITOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n     This letter was printed in _The True American_, Trenton, New\r\n     Jersey, soon after Paine's return to his old home at\r\n     Bordenton. It is here printed from the original manuscript,\r\n     for which I am indebted to Mr. W. F. Havemeyer of New York.\r\n     Although the Editor has concluded to present Paine's\r\n     \"Maritime Compact\" in the form he finally gave it, the\r\n     articles were printed in French in 1800, and by S. H. Smith,\r\n     Washington, at the close of the same year. There is an\r\n     interesting history connected with it. John Hall, in his\r\n     diary (\"Trenton, 20 April, 1787\") relates that Paine told\r\n     him of Dr. Franklin, whom he (Paine) had just visited in\r\n     Philadelphia,  and the Treaty he, the Doctor, made with the\r\n     late King of Prussia by adding an article that, should war\r\n     ever break out, Commerce should be free. The Doctor said he\r\n     showed it to Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was\r\n     such as he would make even with England. In his Address to\r\n     the People of France, 1797 (see p. 366), Paine closes with a\r\n     suggestion on the subject, and a year later (September 30,\r\n     1798), when events were in a critical condition, he sent\r\n     nine articles of his proposed _Pacte Maritime_ to\r\n     Talleyrand, newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. The\r\n     letters that passed are here taken from the originals (State\r\n     Archives, Paris, États Unis, vol. 48).\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Rue Theatre française, No. 4, 9 Vendemaire, 6 year.\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Minister: I promised you some observations on the state of\r\nthings between France and America. I divide the case into two parts.\r\nFirst, with respect to some Method that shall effectually put an end to\r\nall interruptions of the American Commerce. Secondly, with respect to\r\nthe settlement for the captures that have been made on that Commerce.\r\n\r\n\"As to the first case (the interruption of the American Commerce\r\nby France) it has foundation in the British Treaty, and it is the\r\ncontinuance of that treaty that renders the remedy difficult. Besides,\r\nthe American administration has blundered so much in the business of\r\ntreaty-making, that it is probable it will blunder again in making\r\nanother with France. There is, however, one method left, and there is\r\nbut one that I can see, that will be effectual. It is a _non-importation\r\nConvention; that America agrees not to import from any Nation in Europe\r\nwho shall interrupt her Commerce on the seas, any goods, wares, or\r\nmerchandize whatever, and that all her ports shall be shut against\r\nthe Nation that gives the offence_. This will draw America out of her\r\ndifficulties with respect to her treaty with England.\r\n\r\n\"But it will be far better if this non-importation convention were to\r\nbe a general convention of Nations acting as a Whole. It would give a\r\nbetter protection to Neutral Commerce than the armed neutrality could\r\ndo. I would rather be a Neutral Nation under the protection of such a\r\nConvention, which costs nothing to make it, than be under the protection\r\nof a navy equal to that of Great Britain. France should be the patron of\r\nsuch a Convention and sign it. It would be giving both her consent and\r\nher protection to the Rights of Neutral Nations. If England refuse to\r\nsign it she will nevertheless be obliged to respect it, or lose all her\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\n\"I enclose you a plan I drew up about four months ago, when there was\r\nexpectation that Mr. Madison would come to France. It has lain by me\r\never since.\r\n\r\n\"The second part, that of settlement for the captures, I will make the\r\nsubject of a future correspondence. Salut et respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTalleyrand's Reply (\"Foreign Relations, 15 Vendemaire An. 6,\" Oct.\r\n6, 1797): \"I have the honor to return you, Citizen, with very sincere\r\nthanks, your Letter to General Washington which you have had the\r\ngoodness to show me.\r\n\r\n\"I have received the letter which you have taken the trouble to write\r\nme, the 9th of this month. I need not assure you of the appreciation\r\nwith which I shall receive the further indications you promise on the\r\nmeans of terminating in a durable manner the differences which must\r\nexcite your interest as a patriot and as a Republican. Animated by\r\nsuch a principle your ideas cannot fail to throw valuable light on the\r\ndiscussion you open, and which should have for its object to reunite the\r\ntwo Republics in whose alienation the enemies of liberty triumph.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's plan made a good impression in France--He writes to Jefferson,\r\nOctober 6, 1800, that the Consul Le Brun, at an entertainment given to\r\nthe American envoys, gave for his toast: \"À l'union de 1' Amérique avec\r\nles Puissances du Nord pour faire respecter la liberté des mers.\"\r\n\r\nThe malignant mind, like the jaundiced eye, sees everything through a\r\nfalse medium of its own creating. The light of heaven appears stained\r\nwith yellow to the distempered sight of the one, and the fairest actions\r\nhave the form of crimes in the venomed imagination of the other.\r\n\r\nFor seven months, both before and after my return to America in October\r\nlast, the apostate papers styling themselves \"Federal\" were filled with\r\nparagraphs and Essays respecting a letter from Mr. Jefferson to me at\r\nParis; and though none of them knew the contents of the letter, nor the\r\noccasion of writing it, malignity taught them to suppose it, and the\r\nlying tongue of injustice lent them its aid.\r\n\r\nThat the public may no longer be imposed upon by Federal apostacy, I\r\nwill now publish the Letter, and the occasion of its being written.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty negociated in England by John Jay, and ratified by the\r\nWashington Administration, had so disgracefully surrendered the right\r\nand freedom of the American flag, that all the Commerce of the\r\nUnited States on the Ocean became exposed to capture, and suffered in\r\nconsequence of it. The duration of the Treaty was limited to two years\r\nafter the war; and consequently America could not, during that period,\r\nrelieve herself from the Chains which the Treaty had fixed upon her.\r\nThis being the case, the only relief that could come must arise out of\r\nsomething originating in Europe, that would, in its consequences, extend\r\nto America. It had long been my opinion that Commerce contained within\r\nitself the means of its own protection; but as the time for bringing\r\nforward any new system is not always happening, it is necessary to watch\r\nits approach, and lay hold of it before it passes away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the late Emperor Paul of Russia abandoned his coalition with\r\nEngland and become a Neutral Power, this Crisis of time, and also of\r\ncircumstances, was then arriving; and I employed it in arranging a plan\r\nfor the protection of the Commerce of Neutral Nations during War,\r\nthat might, in its operation and consequences, relieve the Commerce of\r\nAmerica. The Plan, with the pieces accompanying it, consisted of\r\nabout forty pages. The Citizen Bonneville, with whom I lived in Paris,\r\ntranslated it into French; Mr. Skipwith, the American Consul, Joel\r\nBarlow, and myself, had the translation printed and distributed as\r\na present to the Foreign Ministers of all the Neutral Nations then\r\nresident in Paris. This was in the summer of 1800.\r\n\r\nIt was entitled Maritime Compact (in French _Pacte Maritime_), The plan,\r\nexclusive of the pieces that accompanied it, consisted of the following\r\nPreamble and Articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARITIME COMPACT.\r\n\r\nBeing an Unarmed Association of Nations for the protection of the Rights\r\nand Commerce of Nations that shall be neutral in time of War.\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Vexations and Injuries to which the Rights and Commerce of\r\nNeutral Nations have been, and continue to be, exposed during the time\r\nof maritime War, render it necessary to establish a law of Nations for\r\nthe purpose of putting an end to such vexations and Injuries, and to\r\nguarantee to the Neutral Nations the exercise of their just Rights,\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the undersigned Powers, form ourselves into an\r\nAssociation, and establish the following as a Law of Nations on the\r\nSeas.\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE FIRST. Definition of the Rights of neutral Nations.\r\n\r\nThe Rights of Nations, such as are exercised by them in their\r\nintercourse with each other in time of Peace, are, and of right ought to\r\nbe, the Rights of Neutral Nations at all times; because,\r\n\r\nFirst, those Rights not having been abandoned by them, remain with them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, because those Rights cannot become forfeited or void, in\r\nconsequence of War breaking out between two or more other Nations.\r\n\r\nA War of Nation against Nation being exclusively the act of the Nations\r\nthat make the War, and not the act of the Neutral Nations, cannot,\r\nwhether considered in itself or in its consequences, destroy or diminish\r\nthe Rights of the Nations remaining in Peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nThe Ships and Vessels of Nations that rest neuter and at Peace with the\r\nWorld during a War with other Nations, have a Right to navigate freely\r\non the Seas as they navigated before that War broke out, and to proceed\r\nto and enter the Port or Ports of any of the Belligerent Powers, _with\r\nthe consent of that Power_, without being seized, searched, visited, or\r\nany ways interrupted, by the Nation or Nations with which that Nation is\r\nat War.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nFor the Conservation of the aforesaid Rights, We, the undersigned\r\nPowers, engaging to each other our Sacred Faith and Honour, declare,\r\n\r\nThat if any Belligerent Power shall seize, search, visit, or any ways\r\ninterrupt any Ship or Vessel belonging to the Citizens or Subjects of\r\nany of the Powers composing this Association, then each and all of the\r\nsaid undersigned Powers will cease to import, and will not permit to\r\nbe imported into the Ports or Dominions of any of the said undersigned\r\nPowers, in any Ship or Vessel whatever, any Goods, wares, or\r\nMerchandize, produced or manufactured in, or exported from, the\r\nDominions of the Power so offending against the Association hereby\r\nestablished and Proclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nThat all the Ports appertaining to any and all of the Powers composing\r\nthis Association shall be shut against the Flag of the offending Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\nThat no remittance or payment in Money, Merchandize, or Bills of\r\nExchange, shall be made by any of the Citizens, or Subjects, of any of\r\nthe Powers composing this Association, to the Citizens or Subjects of\r\nthe offending Nation, for the Term of one year, or until reparation\r\nbe made. The reparation to be ---- times the amount of the damages\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE SIXTH.\r\n\r\nIf any Ship or Vessel appertaining to any of the Citizens or Subjects of\r\nany of the Powers composing this Association shall be seized, searched,\r\nvisited, or interrupted, by any Belligerent Nation, or be forcibly\r\nprevented entering the Port of her destination, or be seized, searched,\r\nvisited, or interrupted, in coming out of such Port, or be forcibly\r\nprevented from proceeding to any new destination, or be insulted or\r\nvisited by any Agent from on board any Vessel of any Belligerent Power,\r\nthe Government or Executive Power of the Nation to which the Ship or\r\nVessel so seized, searched, visited, or interrupted belongs, shall, on\r\nevidence of the fact, make public Proclamation of the same, and send\r\na Copy thereof to the Government, or Executive, of each of the Powers\r\ncomposing this Association, who shall publish the same in all the extent\r\nof his Dominions, together with a Declaration, that at the expiration\r\nof ---- days after publication, the penal articles of this Association\r\nshall be put in execution against the offending Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nIf reparation be not made within the space of one year, the said\r\nProclamation shall be renewed for one year more, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nThe Association chooses for itself a Flag to be carried at the Mast-head\r\nconjointly with the National Flag of each Nation composing this\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe Flag of the Association shall be composed of the same colors as\r\ncompose the Rainbow, and arranged in the same order as they appear in\r\nthat Phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE NINTH.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, it may happen that one or more of the Nations composing\r\nthis Association may be, at the time of forming it, engaged in War or\r\nbecome so in future, in that case, the Ships and Vessels of such Nation\r\nshall carry the Flag of the Association bound round the Mast, to denote\r\nthat the Nation to which she belongs is a Member of the Association and\r\na respecter of its Laws.\r\n\r\nN. B. This distinction in the manner of carrying the Flag is mearly for\r\nthe purpose, that Neutral Vessels having the Flag at the Mast-head, may\r\nbe known at first sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE TENTH.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, it is contrary to the moral principles of Neutrality and\r\nPeace, that any Neutral Nation should furnish to the Belligerent Powers,\r\nor any of them, the means of carrying on War against each other, We,\r\ntherefore, the Powers composing this Association, Declare, that we\r\nwill each one for itself, prohibit in our Dominions the exportation or\r\ntransportation of military stores, comprehending gunpowder, cannon, and\r\ncannon-balls, fire arms of all kinds, and all kinds of iron and steel\r\nweapons used in War. Excluding therefrom all kinds of Utensils and\r\nInstruments used in civil or domestic life, and every other article that\r\ncannot, in its immediate state, be employed in War.\r\n\r\nHaving thus declared the moral Motives of the foregoing Article, We\r\ndeclare also the civil and political Intention thereof, to wit,\r\n\r\nThat as Belligerent Nations have no right to visit or search any Ship or\r\nVessel belonging to a Nation at Peace, and under the protection of\r\nthe Laws and Government thereof, and as all such visit or search is an\r\ninsult to the Nation to which such Ship or Vessel belongs and to\r\nthe Government of the same, We, therefore, the Powers composing this\r\nAssociation, will take the right of prohibition on ourselves to whom it\r\nproperly belongs, and by whom only it can be legally exercised, and\r\nnot permit foreign Nations, in a state of War, to usurp the right of\r\nlegislating by Proclamation for any of the Citizens or Subjects of the\r\nPowers composing this Association.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, in order to take away all pretence of search or visit,\r\nwhich by being offensive might become a new cause of War, that we will\r\nprovide Laws and publish them by Proclamation, each in his own Dominion,\r\nto prohibit the supplying, or carrying to, the Belligerent Powers,\r\nor either of them, the military stores or articles before mentioned,\r\nannexing thereto a penalty to be levied or inflicted upon any persons\r\nwithin our several Dominions transgressing the same. And we invite all\r\nPersons, as well of the Belligerent Nations as of our own, or of\r\nany other, to give information of any knowledge they may have of\r\nany transgressions against the said Law, that the offenders may be\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\nBy this conduct we restore the word Contraband (_contra_ and _ban_) to\r\nits true and original signification, which means against Law, edict, or\r\nProclamation; and none but the Government of a Nation can have, or can\r\nexercise, the right of making Laws, edicts, or Proclamations, for the\r\nconduct of its Citizens or Subjects.\r\n\r\nNow We, the undersigned Powers, declare the aforesaid Articles to be a\r\nLaw of Nations at all times, or until a Congress of Nations shall meet\r\nto form some Law more effectual.\r\n\r\nAnd we do recommend that immediately on the breaking out of War between\r\nany two or more Nations, that Deputies be appointed by all Neutral\r\nNations, whether members of this Association or not, to meet in Congress\r\nin some central place to take cognizance of any violations of the Rights\r\nof Neutral Nations.\r\n\r\nSigned, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of giving operation to the aforesaid plan of an _unarmed\r\nAssociation_, the following Paragraph was subjoined:\r\n\r\nIt may be judged proper for the order of Business, that the Association\r\nof Nations have a President for a term of years, and the Presidency to\r\npass by rotation, to each of the parties composing the Association.\r\n\r\nIn that case, and for the sake of regularity, the first President to\r\nbe the Executive power of the most northerly Nation composing the\r\nAssociation, and his deputy or Minister at the Congress to be President\r\nof the Congress,--and the next most northerly to be Vice-president, who\r\nshall succeed to the Presidency, and so on. The line determining the\r\nGeographical situation of each, to be the latitude of the Capital of\r\neach Nation.\r\n\r\nIf this method be adopted it will be proper that the first President\r\nbe nominally constituted in order to give rotation to the rest. In that\r\ncase the following Article might be added to the foregoing, viz't. The\r\nConstitution of the Association nominates the Emperor Paul to be _first\r\nPresident_ of the Association of Nations for the protection of Neutral\r\nCommerce, and securing the freedom of the Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing plan, as I have before mentioned, was presented to the\r\nMinisters of all the Neutral Nations then in Paris, in the summer of\r\n1800. Six Copies were given to the Russian General Springporten; and a\r\nRussian Gentleman who was going to Petersburgh took two expressly for\r\nthe purpose of putting them into the hands of Paul I sent the original\r\nmanuscript, in my own handwriting, to Mr. Jefferson, and also wrote him\r\nfour Letters, dated the 1st, 4th, 6th, 16th of October, 1800, giving\r\nhim an account of what was then going on in Europe respecting Neutral\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\nThe Case was, that in order to compel the English Government to\r\nacknowledge the rights of Neutral Commerce, and that free Ships make\r\nfree Goods, the _Emperor Paul_, in the month of September following the\r\npublication of the plan, shut all the Ports of Russia against England.\r\nSweden and Denmark did the same by their Ports, and Denmark shut up\r\nHamburgh. Prussia shut up the Elbe and the Weser. The ports of Spain,\r\nPortugal, and Naples were shut up, and, in general, all the ports of\r\nItaly, except Venice, which the Emperor of Germany held; and had it not\r\nbeen for the untimely death of Paul, a _Law of Nations_, founded on the\r\nauthority of Nations, for establishing the rights of Neutral Commerce\r\nand the freedom of the Seas, would have been proclaimed, and the\r\nGovernment of England must have consented to that Law, or the Nation\r\nmust have lost its Commerce; and the consequence to America would have\r\nbeen, that such a Law would, in a great measure if not entirely, have\r\nreleased her from the injuries of Jay's Treaty.\r\n\r\nOf all these matters I informed Mr. Jefferson. This was before he was\r\nPresident, and the Letter he wrote me after he was President was in\r\nanswer to those I had written to him and the manuscript Copy of the plan\r\nI had sent here. Here follows the Letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, March 18, 1801. Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour letters of Oct. 1st, 4th, 6th, 16th, came duly to hand, and the\r\npapers which they covered were, according to your permission, published\r\nin the Newspapers, and in a Pamphlet, and under your own name. These\r\npapers contain precisely our principles, and I hope they will be\r\ngenerally recognized here. _Determined as we are to avoid, if possible,\r\nwasting the energies of our People in war and destruction, we shall\r\navoid implicating ourselves with the Powers of Europe, even in support\r\nof principles which we mean to pursue. They have so many other Interests\r\ndifferent from ours that we must avoid being entangled in them. We\r\nbelieve we can enforce those principles as to ourselves by Peaceable\r\nmeans, now that we are likely to have our Public Councils detached from\r\nforeign views. The return of our citizens from the phrenzy into which\r\nthey had been wrought, partly by ill conduct in France, partly by\r\nartifices practiced upon them, is almost extinct, and will, I believe,\r\nbecome quite so_, But these details, too minute and long for a Letter,\r\nwill be better developed by Mr. Dawson, the Bearer of this, a Member of\r\nthe late Congress, to whom I refer you for them. He goes in the Maryland\r\nSloop of War, which will wait a few days at Havre to receive his Letters\r\nto be written on his arrival at Paris. You expressed a wish to get a\r\npassage to this Country in a Public Vessel. Mr. Dawson is charged with\r\norders to the Captain of the Maryland to receive and accommodate you\r\nback if you can be ready to depart at such a short warning. Rob't R.\r\nLivingston is appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the Republic of\r\nFrance, but will not leave this, till we receive the ratification of\r\nthe Convention by Mr. Dawson. I am in hopes you will find us returned\r\ngenerally to sentiments worthy of former times. In these it will be\r\nyour glory to have steadily laboured and with as much effect as any man\r\nliving. That you may long live to continue your useful Labours and to\r\nreap the reward in the thankfulness of Nations is my sincere prayer.\r\nAccept assurances of my high esteem and affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, Citizens of the United States, is the Letter about which the\r\nleaders and tools of the Federal faction, without knowing its contents\r\nor the occasion of writing it, have wasted so many malignant falsehoods.\r\nIt is a Letter which, on account of its wise economy and peaceable\r\nprinciples, and its forbearance to reproach, will be read by every good\r\nMan and every good Citizen with pleasure; and the faction, mortified at\r\nits appearance, will have to regret they forced it into publication. The\r\nleast atonement they can now offer is to make the Letter as public as\r\nthey have made their own infamy, and learn to lie no more.\r\n\r\nThe same injustice they shewed to Mr. Jefferson they shewed to me. I\r\nhad employed myself in Europe, and at my own expense, in forming and\r\npromoting a plan that would, in its operation, have benefited the\r\nCommerce of America; and the faction here invented and circulated an\r\naccount in the papers they employ, that I had given a plan to the French\r\nfor burning all the towns on the Coast from Savannah to Baltimore. Were\r\nI to prosecute them for this (and I do not promise that I will not, for\r\nthe Liberty of the Press is not the liberty of lying,) there is not a\r\nfederal judge, not even one of Midnight appointment, but must, from the\r\nnature of the case, be obliged to condemn them. The faction, however,\r\ncannot complain they have been restrained in any thing. They have had\r\ntheir full swing of lying uncontradicted; they have availed themselves,\r\nunopposed, of all the arts Hypocrisy could devise; and the event has\r\nbeen, what in all such cases it ever will and ought to be, _the ruin of\r\nthemselves_.\r\n\r\nThe Characters of the late and of the present Administrations are now\r\nsufficiently marked, and the adherents of each keep up the distinction.\r\nThe former Administration rendered itself notorious by outrage,\r\ncoxcombical parade, false alarms, a continued increase of taxes, and an\r\nunceasing clamor for War; and as every vice has a virtue opposed to\r\nit, the present Administration moves on the direct contrary line.\r\nThe question, therefore, at elections is not properly a question upon\r\nPersons, but upon principles. Those who are for Peace, moderate taxes,\r\nand mild Government, will vote for the Administration that conducts\r\nitself by those principles, in whatever hands that Administration may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThere are in the United States, and particularly in the middle States,\r\nseveral religious Sects, whose leading moral principle is PEACE. It is,\r\ntherefore, impossible that such Persons, consistently with the dictates\r\nof that principle, can vote for an Administration that is clamorous\r\nfor War. When moral principles, rather than Persons, are candidates for\r\nPower, to vote is to perform a moral duty, and not to vote is to neglect\r\na duty.\r\n\r\nThat persons who are hunting after places, offices, and contracts,\r\nshould be advocates for War, taxes, and extravagance, is not to be\r\nwondered at; but that so large a portion of the People who had nothing\r\nto depend upon but their Industry, and no other public prospect but that\r\nof paying taxes, and bearing the burden, should be advocates for the\r\nsame measures, is a thoughtlessness not easily accounted for. But reason\r\nis recovering her empire, and the fog of delusion is clearing away.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nBORDENTOWN, ON THE DELAWARE,\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, April 21, 1803.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 Endorsed: \"Sent by Gen. Bloomfield per Mr. Wilson for Mr.\r\n     Duane.\" And, in a later hand: \"Paine Letter 6. Found among\r\n     the Bartram Papers sent by Col. Carr.\"--Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. TO THE FRENCH INHABITANTS OF LOUISIANA.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 In a letter to Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury\r\n     (Oct 14, 1804), John Randolph of Roanoke proposed \"the\r\n     printing of -- thousand copies of Tom Paine's answer to\r\n     their remonstrance, and transmitting them by as many\r\n     thousand troops, who can speak a language perfectly\r\n     intelligible to the people of Louisiana, whatever that of\r\n     their government may be,\" The purchase of Louisiana was\r\n     announced to the Senate by President Jefferson, October 17,\r\n     1803.--Editor.\r\n\r\nA publication having the appearance of a memorial and remonstrance, to\r\nbe presented to Congress at the ensuing session, has appeared in several\r\npapers. It is therefore open to examination, and I offer you my remarks\r\nupon it. The title and introductory paragraph are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_To the Congress of the United States in the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives convened_: We the subscribers, planters, merchants, and\r\nother inhabitants of Louisiana, respectfully approach the legislature\r\nof the United States with a memorial of _our rights_, a remonstrance\r\nagainst certain laws which contravene them, and a petition for\r\nthat redress to which the laws of nature, sanctioned by positive\r\nstipulations, have entitled us.\"\r\n\r\nIt often happens that when one party, or one that thinks itself a party,\r\ntalks much about its rights, it puts those of the other party upon\r\nexamining into their own, and such is the effect produced by your\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nA single reading of that memorial will show it is the work of some\r\nperson who is not of your people. His acquaintance with the cause,\r\ncommencement, progress, and termination of the American revolution,\r\ndecides this point; and his making our merits in that revolution the\r\nground of your claims, as if our merits could become yours, show she\r\ndoes not understand your situation.\r\n\r\nWe obtained our rights by calmly understanding principles, and by the\r\nsuccessful event of a long, obstinate, and expensive war. But it is\r\nnot incumbent on us to fight the battles of the world for the world's\r\nprofit. You are already participating, without any merit or expense in\r\nobtaining it, the blessings of freedom acquired by ourselves; and in\r\nproportion as you become initiated into the principles and practice of\r\nthe representative system of government, of which you have yet had no\r\nexperience, you will participate more, and finally be partakers of the\r\nwhole. You see what mischief ensued in France by the possession of power\r\nbefore they understood principles. They earned liberty in words, but\r\nnot in fact. The writer of this was in France through the whole of\r\nthe revolution, and knows the truth of what he speaks; for after\r\nendeavouring to give it principle, he had nearly fallen a victim to its\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nThere is a great want of judgment in the person who drew up your\r\nmemorial. He has mistaken your case, and forgotten his own; and by\r\ntrying to court your applause has injured your pretensions. He has\r\nwritten like a lawyer, straining every point that would please his\r\nclient, without studying his advantage. I find no fault with the\r\ncomposition of the memorial, for it is well written; nor with the\r\nprinciples of liberty it contains, considered in the abstract. The error\r\nlies in the misapplication of them, and in assuming a ground they have\r\nnot a right to stand upon. Instead of their serving you as a ground of\r\nreclamation against us, they change into a satire on yourselves. Why\r\ndid you not speak thus when you ought to have spoken it? We fought for\r\nliberty when you stood quiet in slavery.\r\n\r\nThe author of the memorial injudiciously confounding two distinct\r\ncases together, has spoken as if he was the memorialist of a body of\r\nAmericans, who, after sharing equally with us in all the dangers and\r\nhardships of the revolutionary war, had retired to a distance and made\r\na settlement for themselves. If, in such a situation, Congress had\r\nestablished a temporary government over them, in which they were not\r\npersonally consulted, they would have had a right to speak as the\r\nmemorial speaks. But your situation is different from what the situation\r\nof such persons would be, and therefore their ground of reclamation\r\ncannot of right become yours. You are arriving at freedom by the easiest\r\nmeans that any people ever enjoyed it; without contest, without expense,\r\nand even without any contrivance of your own. And you already so far\r\nmistake principles, that under the name of _rights_ you ask for _powers;\r\npower to import and enslave Africans_; and _to govern_ a territory that\r\n_we have purchased_.\r\n\r\nTo give colour to your memorial, you refer to the treaty of cession, (in\r\nwhich _you were not_ one of the contracting parties,) concluded at Paris\r\nbetween the governments of the United States and France.\r\n\r\n\"The third article\" you say \"of the treaty lately concluded at\r\nParis declares, that the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be\r\nincorporated in the union of the United States, and admitted _as soon as\r\npossible, according to the principles_ of the Federal Constitution, to\r\nthe enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens\r\nof the United States; and _in the mean time_, they shall be protected\r\nin the enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the exercise of the\r\nreligion they profess.\"\r\n\r\nAs from your former condition, you cannot be much acquainted with\r\ndiplomatic policy, and I am convinced that even the gentleman who\r\ndrew up the memorial is not, I will explain to you the grounds of this\r\narticle. It may prevent your running into further errors.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Louisiana had been so often ceded to different European\r\npowers, that it became a necessary article on the part of France,\r\nand for the security of Spain, the ally of France, and which accorded\r\nperfectly with our own principles and intentions, that it should be\r\n_ceded no more_; and this article, stipulating for the incorporation of\r\nLouisiana into the union of the United States, stands as a bar against\r\nall future cession, and at the same time, as well as \"_in the mean\r\ntime_\" secures to you a civil and political permanency, personal\r\nsecurity and liberty which you never enjoyed before.\r\n\r\nFrance and Spain might suspect, (and the suspicion would not have been\r\nill-founded had the cession been treated for in the administration of\r\nJohn Adams, or when Washington was president, and Alexander Hamilton\r\npresident over him,) that we _bought_ Louisiana for the British\r\ngovernment, or with a view of selling it to her; and though such\r\nsuspicion had no just ground to stand upon with respect to our present\r\npresident, Thomas Jefferson, who is not only not a man of intrigue but\r\nwho possesses that honest pride of principle that cannot be intrigued\r\nwith, and which keeps intriguers at a distance, the article was\r\nnevertheless necessary as a precaution against future contingencies.\r\nBut you, from not knowing the political ground of the article, apply\r\nto yourselves _personally_ and _exclusively_, what had reference to the\r\n_territory_, to prevent its falling into the hands of any foreign\r\npower that might endanger the [establishment of] _Spanish_ dominion in\r\nAmerica, or those of the _French_ in the West India Islands.\r\n\r\nYou claim, (you say), to be incorporated into the union of the United\r\nStates, and your remonstrances on this subject are unjust and without\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nYou are already _incorporated_ into it as fully and effectually as the\r\nAmericans themselves are, who are settled in Louisiana. You enjoy the\r\nsame rights, privileges, advantages, and immunities, which they\r\nenjoy; and when Louisiana, or some part of it, shall be erected into a\r\nconstitutional State, you also will be citizens equal with them.\r\n\r\nYou speak in your memorial, as if you were the only people who were\r\nto live in Louisiana, and as if the territory was purchased that\r\nyou exclusively might govern it. In both these cases you are greatly\r\nmistaken. The emigrations from the United States into the purchased\r\nterritory, and the population arising therefrom, will, in a few years,\r\nexceed you in numbers. It is but twenty-six years since Kentucky\r\nbegan to be settled, and it already contains more than _double_ your\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn a candid view of the case, you ask for what would be injurious to\r\nyourselves to receive, and unjust in us to grant. _Injurious_, because\r\nthe settlement of Louisiana will go on much faster under the government\r\nand guardianship of Congress, then if the government of it were\r\ncommitted to _your_ hands; and consequently, the landed property\r\nyou possessed as individuals when the treaty was concluded, or have\r\npurchased since, will increase so much faster in value.--_Unjust to\r\nourselves_, because as the reimbursements of the purchase money must\r\ncome out of the sale of the lands to new settlers, the government of it\r\ncannot suddenly go out of the hands of Congress. They are guardians of\r\nthat property for _all the people of the United States_. And besides\r\nthis, as the new settlers will be chiefly from the United States, it\r\nwould be unjust and ill policy to put them and their property under the\r\njurisdiction of a people whose freedom they had contributed to purchase.\r\nYou ought also to recollect, that the French Revolution has not\r\nexhibited to the world that grand display of principles and rights, that\r\nwould induce settlers from other countries to put themselves under a\r\nFrench jurisdiction in Louisiana. Beware of intriguers who may push you\r\non from private motives of their own.\r\n\r\nYou complain of two cases, one of which you have _no right_, no concern\r\nwith; and the other is founded in direct injustice.\r\n\r\nYou complain that Congress has passed a law to divide the country\r\ninto two territories. It is not improper to inform you, that after the\r\nrevolutionary war ended, Congress divided the territory acquired by\r\nthat war into ten territories; each of which was to be erected into a\r\nconstitutional State, when it arrived at a certain population mentioned\r\nin the Act; and, in the mean time, an officer appointed by the\r\nPresident, as the Governor of Louisiana now is, presided, as Governor\r\nof the Western Territory, over all such parts as have not arrived at\r\nthe maturity of _statehood_. Louisiana will require to be divided\r\ninto twelve States or more; but this is a matter that belongs to _the\r\npurchaser_ of the territory of Louisiana, and with which the inhabitants\r\nof the town of New-Orleans have no right to interfere; and beside this,\r\nit is probable that the inhabitants of the other territory would choose\r\nto be independent of New-Orleans. They might apprehend, that on some\r\nspeculating pretence, their produce might be put in requisition, and a\r\nmaximum price put on it--a thing not uncommon in a French government.\r\nAs a general rule, without refining upon sentiment, one may put\r\nconfidence in the justice of those who have no inducement to do us\r\ninjustice; and this is the case Congress stands in with respect to both\r\nterritories, and to all other divisions that may be laid out, and to all\r\ninhabitants and settlers, of whatever nation they may be.\r\n\r\nThere can be no such thing as what the memorial speaks of, that is, _of\r\na Governor appointed by the President who may have no interest in the\r\nwelfare of Louisiana_. He must, from the nature of the case, have more\r\ninterest in it than any other person can have. He is entrusted with the\r\ncare of an extensive tract of country, now the property of the United\r\nStates by purchase. The value of those lands will depend on the\r\nincreasing prosperity of Louisiana, its agriculture, commerce, and\r\npopulation. You have only a local and partial interest in the town of\r\nNew-Orleans, or its vicinity; and if, in consequence of exploring the\r\ncountry, new seats of commerce should offer, his general interest would\r\nlead him to open them, and your partial interest to shut them up.\r\n\r\nThere is probably some justice in your remark, as it applies to the\r\ngovernments under which you _formerly_ lived. Such governments\r\nalways look with jealousy, and an apprehension of revolt, on colonies\r\nincreasing in prosperity and population, and they send governors to\r\n_keep them down_. But when you argue from the conduct of governments\r\n_distant and despotic_, to that of _domestic_ and _free_ government, it\r\nshows you do not understand the principles and interest of a Republic,\r\nand to put you right is friendship. We have had experience, and you have\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe other case to which I alluded, as being founded in direct injustice,\r\nis that in which you petition for _power_, under the name of _rights_,\r\nto import and enslave Africans!\r\n\r\n_Dare you put up a petition to Heaven for such a power, without fearing\r\nto be struck from the earth by its justice?_\r\n\r\n_Why, then, do you ask it of man against man?_\r\n\r\n_Do you want to renew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?_\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon Sense.\r\n\r\nSept 22, 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Paine\r\n\r\n\r\nCollected And Edited By Moncure Daniel Conway\r\n\r\nVOLUME IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF REASON\r\n\r\n\r\n(1796)\r\n\r\n\r\n   Contents\r\n\r\n   Editor's Introduction\r\n\r\n                     Part One\r\n  Chapter I - The Author's Profession Of Faith\r\n  Chapter II - Of Missions And Revelations\r\n  Chapter III - Concerning The Character of Jesus Christ, And His History\r\n  Chapter IV - Of The Bases Of Christianity\r\n  Chapter V - Examination In Detail Of The Preceding Bases\r\n  Chapter VI - Of The True Theology\r\n  Chapter VII - Examination Of The Old Testament\r\n  Chapter VIII - Of The New Testament\r\n  Chapter IX - In What The True Revelation Consists\r\n  Chapter X - Concerning God, And The Lights Cast On His Existence And\r\n              Attributes By The Bible\r\n  Chapter XI - Of The Theology Of The Christians; And The True Theology\r\n  Chapter XII - The Effects Of Christianism On Education; Proposed Reforms\r\n  Chapter XIII - Comparison Of Christianism With The Religious Ideas\r\n                 Inspired By Nature\r\n  Chapter XIV - System Of The Universe\r\n  Chapter XV - Advantages Of The Existence Of Many Worlds In Each Solar\r\n               System\r\n  Chapter XVI - Applications Of The Preceding To The System Of The\r\n                Christians\r\n  Chapter XVII - Of The Means Employed In All Time, And Almost\r\n                 Universally, To Deceive The Peoples\r\n  Recapitulation\r\n\r\n                          Part Two\r\n  Preface\r\n  Chapter I - The Old Testament\r\n  Chapter II - The New Testament\r\n  Chapter III - Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWITH SOME RESULTS OF RECENT RESEARCHES.\r\n\r\nIN the opening year, 1793, when revolutionary France had beheaded its\r\nking, the wrath turned next upon the King of kings, by whose grace every\r\ntyrant claimed to reign. But eventualities had brought among them a\r\ngreat English and American heart--Thomas Paine. He had pleaded for Louis\r\nCaper--\"Kill the king but spare the man.\" Now he pleaded,--\"Disbelieve\r\nin the King of kings, but do not confuse with that idol the Father of\r\nMankind!\"\r\n\r\nIn Paine's Preface to the Second Part of \"The Age of Reason\" he\r\ndescribes himself as writing the First Part near the close of the year\r\n1793. \"I had not finished it more than six hours, in the state it has\r\nsince appeared, before a guard came about three in the morning, with an\r\norder signed by the two Committees of Public Safety and Surety General,\r\nfor putting me in arrestation.\" This was on the morning of December 28.\r\nBut it is necessary to weigh the words just quoted--\"in the state it has\r\nsince appeared.\" For on August 5, 1794, Francois Lanthenas, in an\r\nappeal for Paine's liberation, wrote as follows: \"I deliver to Merlin\r\nde Thionville a copy of the last work of T. Payne [The Age of Reason],\r\nformerly our colleague, and in custody since the decree excluding\r\nforeigners from the national representation. This book was written by\r\nthe author in the beginning of the year '93 (old style). I undertook its\r\ntranslation before the revolution against priests, and it was published\r\nin French about the same time. Couthon, to whom I sent it, seemed\r\noffended with me for having translated this work.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the frown of Couthon, one of the most atrocious colleagues of\r\nRobespierre, this early publication seems to have been so effectually\r\nsuppressed that no copy bearing that date, 1793, can be found in France\r\nor elsewhere. In Paine's letter to Samuel Adams, printed in the present\r\nvolume, he says that he had it translated into French, to stay the\r\nprogress of atheism, and that he endangered his life \"by opposing\r\natheism.\" The time indicated by Lanthenas as that in which he submitted\r\nthe work to Couthon would appear to be the latter part of March, 1793,\r\nthe fury against the priesthood having reached its climax in the decrees\r\nagainst them of March 19 and 26. If the moral deformity of Couthon, even\r\ngreater than that of his body, be remembered, and the readiness with\r\nwhich death was inflicted for the most theoretical opinion not approved\r\nby the \"Mountain,\" it will appear probable that the offence given\r\nCouthon by Paine's book involved danger to him and his translator.\r\nOn May 31, when the Girondins were accused, the name of Lanthenas was\r\nincluded, and he barely escaped; and on the same day Danton persuaded\r\nPaine not to appear in the Convention, as his life might be in danger.\r\nWhether this was because of the \"Age of Reason,\" with its fling at the\r\n\"Goddess Nature\" or not, the statements of author and translator\r\nare harmonized by the fact that Paine prepared the manuscript, with\r\nconsiderable additions and changes, for publication in English, as he\r\nhas stated in the Preface to Part II.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the French and English versions, sentence by sentence,\r\nproved to me that the translation sent by Lanthenas to Merlin de\r\nThionville in 1794 is the same as that he sent to Couthon in 1793. This\r\ndiscovery was the means of recovering several interesting sentences\r\nof the original work. I have given as footnotes translations of such\r\nclauses and phrases of the French work as appeared to be important.\r\nThose familiar with the translations of Lanthenas need not be reminded\r\nthat he was too much of a literalist to depart from the manuscript\r\nbefore him, and indeed he did not even venture to alter it in an\r\ninstance (presently considered) where it was obviously needed. Nor would\r\nLanthenas have omitted any of the paragraphs lacking in his translation.\r\nThis original work was divided into seventeen chapters, and these I have\r\nrestored, translating their headings into English. The \"Age of Reason\"\r\nis thus for the first time given to the world with nearly its original\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that Paine could not have read the proof of his\r\n\"Age of Reason\" (Part I.) which went through the press while he was in\r\nprison. To this must be ascribed the permanence of some sentences as\r\nabbreviated in the haste he has described. A notable instance is the\r\ndropping out of his estimate of Jesus the words rendered by Lanthenas\r\n\"trop peu imite, trop oublie, trop meconnu.\" The addition of these\r\nwords to Paine's tribute makes it the more notable that almost the only\r\nrecognition of the human character and life of Jesus by any theological\r\nwriter of that generation came from one long branded as an infidel.\r\n\r\nTo the inability of the prisoner to give his work any revision must be\r\nattributed the preservation in it of the singular error already alluded\r\nto, as one that Lanthenas, but for his extreme fidelity, would have\r\ncorrected. This is Paine's repeated mention of six planets, and\r\nenumeration of them, twelve years after the discovery of Uranus. Paine\r\nwas a devoted student of astronomy, and it cannot for a moment be\r\nsupposed that he had not participated in the universal welcome of\r\nHerschel's discovery. The omission of any allusion to it convinces me\r\nthat the astronomical episode was printed from a manuscript written\r\nbefore 1781, when Uranus was discovered. Unfamiliar with French in 1793,\r\nPaine might not have discovered the erratum in Lanthenas' translation,\r\nand, having no time for copying, he would naturally use as much as\r\npossible of the same manuscript in preparing his work for English\r\nreaders. But he had no opportunity of revision, and there remains an\r\nerratum which, if my conjecture be correct, casts a significant light\r\non the paragraphs in which he alludes to the preparation of the work. He\r\nstates that soon after his publication of \"Common Sense\" (1776), he \"saw\r\nthe exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government\r\nwould be followed by a revolution in the system of religion,\" and that\r\n\"man would return to the pure, unmixed, and unadulterated belief of\r\none God and no more.\" He tells Samuel Adams that it had long been his\r\nintention to publish his thoughts upon religion, and he had made a\r\nsimilar remark to John Adams in 1776. Like the Quakers among whom he\r\nwas reared Paine could then readily use the phrase \"word of God\" for\r\nanything in the Bible which approved itself to his \"inner light,\" and\r\nas he had drawn from the first Book of Samuel a divine condemnation\r\nof monarchy, John Adams, a Unitarian, asked him if he believed in the\r\ninspiration of the Old Testament. Paine replied that he did not, and\r\nat a later period meant to publish his views on the subject. There is\r\nlittle doubt that he wrote from time to time on religious points, during\r\nthe American war, without publishing his thoughts, just as he worked on\r\nthe problem of steam navigation, in which he had invented a practicable\r\nmethod (ten years before John Fitch made his discovery) without\r\npublishing it. At any rate it appears to me certain that the part of\r\n\"The Age of Reason\" connected with Paine's favorite science, astronomy,\r\nwas written before 1781, when Uranus was discovered.\r\n\r\nPaine's theism, however invested with biblical and Christian\r\nphraseology, was a birthright. It appears clear from several allusions\r\nin \"The Age of Reason\" to the Quakers that in his early life, or\r\nbefore the middle of the eighteenth century, the people so called were\r\nsubstantially Deists. An interesting confirmation of Paine's statements\r\nconcerning them appears as I write in an account sent by Count Leo\r\nTolstoi to the London 'Times' of the Russian sect called Dukhobortsy\r\n(The Times, October 23, 1895). This sect sprang up in the last century,\r\nand the narrative says:\r\n\r\n\"The first seeds of the teaching called afterwards 'Dukhoborcheskaya'\r\nwere sown by a foreigner, a Quaker, who came to Russia. The fundamental\r\nidea of his Quaker teaching was that in the soul of man dwells God\r\nhimself, and that He himself guides man by His inner word. God lives\r\nin nature physically and in man's soul spiritually. To Christ, as to an\r\nhistorical personage, the Dukhobortsy do not ascribe great importance...\r\nChrist was God's son, but only in the sense in which we call, ourselves\r\n'sons of God.' The purpose of Christ's sufferings was no other than to\r\nshow us an example of suffering for truth. The Quakers who, in 1818,\r\nvisited the Dukhobortsy, could not agree with them upon these religious\r\nsubjects; and when they heard from them their opinion about Jesus\r\nChrist (that he was a man), exclaimed 'Darkness!' From the Old and New\r\nTestaments,' they say, 'we take only what is useful,' mostly the moral\r\nteaching.... The moral ideas of the Dukhobortsy are the following:--All\r\nmen are, by nature, equal; external distinctions, whatsoever they may\r\nbe, are worth nothing. This idea of men's equality the Dukhoborts have\r\ndirected further, against the State authority.... Amongst themselves\r\nthey hold subordination, and much more, a monarchical Government, to be\r\ncontrary to their ideas.\"\r\n\r\nHere is an early Hicksite Quakerism carried to Russia long before the\r\nbirth of Elias Hicks, who recovered it from Paine, to whom the American\r\nQuakers refused burial among them. Although Paine arraigned the union\r\nof Church and State, his ideal Republic was religious; it was based on\r\na conception of equality based on the divine son-ship of every man. This\r\nfaith underlay equally his burden against claims to divine partiality by\r\na \"Chosen People,\" a Priesthood, a Monarch \"by the grace of God,\" or\r\nan Aristocracy. Paine's \"Reason\" is only an expansion of the Quaker's\r\n\"inner light\"; and the greater impression, as compared with previous\r\nrepublican and deistic writings made by his \"Rights of Man\" and \"Age\r\nof Reason\" (really volumes of one work), is partly explained by the\r\napostolic fervor which made him a spiritual, successor of George Fox.\r\n\r\nPaine's mind was by no means skeptical, it was eminently instructive.\r\nThat he should have waited until his fifty-seventh year before\r\npublishing his religious convictions was due to a desire to work out\r\nsome positive and practicable system to take the place of that which he\r\nbelieved was crumbling. The English engineer Hall, who assisted Paine in\r\nmaking the model of his iron bridge, wrote to his friends in England,\r\nin 1786: \"My employer has Common Sense enough to disbelieve most of the\r\ncommon systematic theories of Divinity, but does not seem to establish\r\nany for himself.\" But five years later Paine was able to lay the\r\ncorner-stone of his temple: \"With respect to religion itself, without\r\nregard to names, and as directing itself from the universal family of\r\nmankind to the 'Divine object of all adoration, it is man bringing to\r\nhis Maker the fruits of his heart; and though those fruits may differ\r\nfrom each other like the fruits of the earth, the grateful tribute of\r\nevery one, is accepted.\" (\"Rights of Man.\" See my edition of Paine's\r\nWritings, ii., p. 326.) Here we have a reappearance of George Fox\r\nconfuting the doctor in America who \"denied the light and Spirit of\r\nGod to be in every one; and affirmed that it was not in the Indians.\r\nWhereupon I called an Indian to us, and asked him 'whether or not, when\r\nhe lied, or did wrong to anyone, there was not something in him that\r\nreproved him for it?' He said, 'There was such a thing in him that did\r\nso reprove him; and he was ashamed when he had done wrong, or spoken\r\nwrong.' So we shamed the doctor before the governor and the people.\"\r\n(Journal of George Fox, September 1672.)\r\n\r\nPaine, who coined the phrase \"Religion of Humanity\" (The Crisis, vii.,\r\n1778), did but logically defend it in \"The Age of Reason,\" by denying a\r\nspecial revelation to any particular tribe, or divine authority in\r\nany particular creed of church; and the centenary of this much-abused\r\npublication has been celebrated by a great conservative champion of\r\nChurch and State, Mr. Balfour, who, in his \"Foundations of Belief,\"\r\naffirms that \"inspiration\" cannot be denied to the great Oriental\r\nteachers, unless grapes may be gathered from thorns.\r\n\r\nThe centenary of the complete publication of \"The Age of Reason,\"\r\n(October 25, 1795), was also celebrated at the Church Congress, Norwich,\r\non October 10, 1895, when Professor Bonney, F.R.S., Canon of Manchester,\r\nread a paper in which he said: \"I cannot deny that the increase of\r\nscientific knowledge has deprived parts of the earlier books of the\r\nBible of the historical value which was generally attributed to them by\r\nour forefathers. The story of Creation in the Book of Genesis, unless we\r\nplay fast and loose either with words or with science, cannot be brought\r\ninto harmony with what we have learnt from geology. Its ethnological\r\nstatements are imperfect, if not sometimes inaccurate. The stories of\r\nthe Fall, of the Flood, and of the Tower of Babel, are incredible in\r\ntheir present form. Some historical element may underlie many of the\r\ntraditions in the first eleven chapters in that book, but this we cannot\r\nhope to recover.\" Canon Bonney proceeded to say of the New Testament\r\nalso, that \"the Gospels are not so far as we know, strictly\r\ncontemporaneous records, so we must admit the possibility of variations\r\nand even inaccuracies in details being introduced by oral tradition.\"\r\nThe Canon thinks the interval too short for these importations to be\r\nserious, but that any question of this kind is left open proves the Age\r\nof Reason fully upon us. Reason alone can determine how many texts are\r\nas spurious as the three heavenly witnesses (i John v. 7), and like\r\nit \"serious\" enough to have cost good men their lives, and persecutors\r\ntheir charities. When men interpolate, it is because they believe their\r\ninterpolation seriously needed. It will be seen by a note in Part II. of\r\nthe work, that Paine calls attention to an interpolation introduced into\r\nthe first American edition without indication of its being an editorial\r\nfootnote. This footnote was: \"The book of Luke was carried by a majority\r\nof one only. Vide Moshelm's Ecc. History.\" Dr. Priestley, then in\r\nAmerica, answered Paine's work, and in quoting less than a page from the\r\n\"Age of Reason\" he made three alterations,--one of which changed \"church\r\nmythologists\" into \"Christian mythologists,\"--and also raised the\r\neditorial footnote into the text, omitting the reference to Mosheim.\r\nHaving done this, Priestley writes: \"As to the gospel of Luke being\r\ncarried by a majority of one only, it is a legend, if not of Mr. Paine's\r\nown invention, of no better authority whatever.\" And so on with further\r\ncastigation of the author for what he never wrote, and which he himself\r\n(Priestley) was the unconscious means of introducing into the text\r\nwithin the year of Paine's publication.\r\n\r\nIf this could be done, unintentionally by a conscientious and exact man,\r\nand one not unfriendly to Paine, if such a writer as Priestley could\r\nmake four mistakes in citing half a page, it will appear not very\r\nwonderful when I state that in a modern popular edition of \"The Age\r\nof Reason,\" including both parts, I have noted about five hundred\r\ndeviations from the original. These were mainly the accumulated efforts\r\nof friendly editors to improve Paine's grammar or spelling; some were\r\nmisprints, or developed out of such; and some resulted from the sale\r\nin London of a copy of Part Second surreptitiously made from the\r\nmanuscript. These facts add significance to Paine's footnote (itself\r\naltered in some editions!), in which he says: \"If this has happened\r\nwithin such a short space of time, notwithstanding the aid of printing,\r\nwhich prevents the alteration of copies individually; what may not have\r\nhappened in a much greater length of time, when there was no printing,\r\nand when any man who could write, could make a written copy, and call it\r\nan original, by Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.\"\r\n\r\nNothing appears to me more striking, as an illustration of the\r\nfar-reaching effects of traditional prejudice, than the errors into\r\nwhich some of our ablest contemporary scholars have fallen by reason of\r\ntheir not having studied Paine. Professor Huxley, for instance, speaking\r\nof the freethinkers of the eighteenth century, admires the acuteness,\r\ncommon sense, wit, and the broad humanity of the best of them, but says\r\n\"there is rarely much to be said for their work as an example of the\r\nadequate treatment of a grave and difficult investigation,\" and that\r\nthey shared with their adversaries \"to the full the fatal weakness of\r\na priori philosophizing.\" [NOTE: Science and Christian Tradition, p.\r\n18 (Lon. ed., 1894).] Professor Huxley does not name Paine, evidently\r\nbecause he knows nothing about him. Yet Paine represents the\r\nturning-point of the historical freethinking movement; he renounced the\r\n'a priori' method, refused to pronounce anything impossible outside\r\npure mathematics, rested everything on evidence, and really founded the\r\nHuxleyan school. He plagiarized by anticipation many things from the\r\nrationalistic leaders of our time, from Strauss and Baur (being the\r\nfirst to expatiate on \"Christian Mythology\"), from Renan (being the\r\nfirst to attempt recovery of the human Jesus), and notably from Huxley,\r\nwho has repeated Paine's arguments on the untrustworthiness of the\r\nbiblical manuscripts and canon, on the inconsistencies of the narratives\r\nof Christ's resurrection, and various other points. None can be more\r\nloyal to the memory of Huxley than the present writer, and it is even\r\nbecause of my sense of his grand leadership that he is here mentioned as\r\na typical instance of the extent to which the very elect of free-thought\r\nmay be unconsciously victimized by the phantasm with which they are\r\ncontending. He says that Butler overthrew freethinkers of the eighteenth\r\ncentury type, but Paine was of the nineteenth century type; and it was\r\nprecisely because of his critical method that he excited more animosity\r\nthan his deistical predecessors. He compelled the apologists to defend\r\nthe biblical narratives in detail, and thus implicitly acknowledge\r\nthe tribunal of reason and knowledge to which they were summoned. The\r\nultimate answer by police was a confession of judgment. A hundred years\r\nago England was suppressing Paine's works, and many an honest Englishman\r\nhas gone to prison for printing and circulating his \"Age of Reason.\"\r\nThe same views are now freely expressed; they are heard in the seats of\r\nlearning, and even in the Church Congress; but the suppression of Paine,\r\nbegun by bigotry and ignorance, is continued in the long indifference of\r\nthe representatives of our Age of Reason to their pioneer and founder.\r\nIt is a grievous loss to them and to their cause. It is impossible to\r\nunderstand the religious history of England, and of America, without\r\nstudying the phases of their evolution represented in the writings\r\nof Thomas Paine, in the controversies that grew out of them with such\r\npractical accompaniments as the foundation of the Theophilanthropist\r\nChurch in Paris and New York, and of the great rationalist wing of\r\nQuakerism in America.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the case with scholars in our time, those of Paine's\r\ntime took the \"Age of Reason\" very seriously indeed. Beginning with\r\nthe learned Dr. Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, a large number of\r\nlearned men replied to Paine's work, and it became a signal for the\r\ncommencement of those concessions, on the part of theology, which have\r\ncontinued to our time; and indeed the so-called \"Broad Church\" is to\r\nsome extent an outcome of \"The Age of Reason.\" It would too much enlarge\r\nthis Introduction to cite here the replies made to Paine (thirty-six are\r\ncatalogued in the British Museum), but it may be remarked that they\r\nwere notably free, as a rule, from the personalities that raged in\r\nthe pulpits. I must venture to quote one passage from his very learned\r\nantagonist, the Rev. Gilbert Wakefield, B.A., \"late Fellow of Jesus\r\nCollege, Cambridge.\" Wakefield, who had resided in London during all the\r\nPaine panic, and was well acquainted with the slanders uttered against\r\nthe author of \"Rights of Man,\" indirectly brands them in answering\r\nPaine's argument that the original and traditional unbelief of the Jews,\r\namong whom the alleged miracles were wrought, is an important evidence\r\nagainst them. The learned divine writes:\r\n\r\n\"But the subject before us admits of further illustration from the\r\nexample of Mr. Paine himself. In this country, where his opposition to\r\nthe corruptions of government has raised him so many adversaries,\r\nand such a swarm of unprincipled hirelings have exerted themselves in\r\nblackening his character and in misrepresenting all the transactions\r\nand incidents of his life, will it not be a most difficult, nay an\r\nimpossible task, for posterity, after a lapse of 1700 years, if such a\r\nwreck of modern literature as that of the ancient, should intervene, to\r\nidentify the real circumstances, moral and civil, of the man? And will\r\na true historian, such as the Evangelists, be credited at that future\r\nperiod against such a predominant incredulity, without large and\r\nmighty accessions of collateral attestation? And how transcendently\r\nextraordinary, I had almost said miraculous, will it be estimated\r\nby candid and reasonable minds, that a writer whose object was a\r\nmelioration of condition to the common people, and their deliverance\r\nfrom oppression, poverty, wretchedness, to the numberless blessings of\r\nupright and equal government, should be reviled, persecuted, and burned\r\nin effigy, with every circumstance of insult and execration, by these\r\nvery objects of his benevolent intentions, in every corner of the\r\nkingdom?\" After the execution of Louis XVI., for whose life Paine\r\npleaded so earnestly,--while in England he was denounced as an\r\naccomplice in the deed,--he devoted himself to the preparation of a\r\nConstitution, and also to gathering up his religious compositions and\r\nadding to them. This manuscript I suppose to have been prepared in what\r\nwas variously known as White's Hotel or Philadelphia House, in Paris,\r\nNo. 7 Passage des Petits Peres. This compilation of early and fresh\r\nmanuscripts (if my theory be correct) was labelled, \"The Age of Reason,\"\r\nand given for translation to Francois Lanthenas in March 1793. It is\r\nentered, in Qudrard (La France Literaire) under the year 1793, but with\r\nthe title \"L'Age de la Raison\" instead of that which it bore in\r\n1794, \"Le Siecle de la Raison.\" The latter, printed \"Au Burcau de\r\nl'imprimerie, rue du Theatre-Francais, No. 4,\" is said to be by \"Thomas\r\nPaine, Citoyen et cultivateur de l'Amerique septentrionale, secretaire\r\ndu Congres du departement des affaires etrangeres pendant la guerre\r\nd'Amerique, et auteur des ouvrages intitules: LA SENS COMMUN et LES\r\nDROITS DE L'HOMME.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution was advancing to increasing terrors, Paine,\r\nunwilling to participate in the decrees of a Convention whose sole legal\r\nfunction was to frame a Constitution, retired to an old mansion\r\nand garden in the Faubourg St. Denis, No. 63. Mr. J.G. Alger, whose\r\nresearches in personal details connected with the Revolution are\r\noriginal and useful, recently showed me in the National Archives\r\nat Paris, some papers connected with the trial of Georgeit, Paine's\r\nlandlord, by which it appears that the present No. 63 is not, as I had\r\nsupposed, the house in which Paine resided. Mr. Alger accompanied me to\r\nthe neighborhood, but we were not able to identify the house. The\r\narrest of Georgeit is mentioned by Paine in his essay on \"Forgetfulness\"\r\n(Writings, iii., 319). When his trial came on one of the charges was\r\nthat he had kept in his house \"Paine and other Englishmen,\"--Paine\r\nbeing then in prison,--but he (Georgeit) was acquitted of the paltry\r\naccusations brought against him by his Section, the \"Faubourg du Nord.\"\r\nThis Section took in the whole east side of the Faubourg St. Denis,\r\nwhereas the present No. 63 is on the west side. After Georgeit (or\r\nGeorger) had been arrested, Paine was left alone in the large mansion\r\n(said by Rickman to have been once the hotel of Madame de Pompadour),\r\nand it would appear, by his account, that it was after the execution\r\n(October 31, 1793) Of his friends the Girondins, and political comrades,\r\nthat he felt his end at hand, and set about his last literary bequest\r\nto the world,--\"The Age of Reason,\"--in the state in which it has since\r\nappeared, as he is careful to say. There was every probability, during\r\nthe months in which he wrote (November and December 1793) that he would\r\nbe executed. His religious testament was prepared with the blade of\r\nthe guillotine suspended over him,--a fact which did not deter pious\r\nmythologists from portraying his death-bed remorse for having written\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\nIn editing Part I. of \"The Age of Reason,\" I follow closely the first\r\nedition, which was printed by Barrois in Paris from the manuscript, no\r\ndoubt under the superintendence of Joel Barlow, to whom Paine, on\r\nhis way to the Luxembourg, had confided it. Barlow was an American\r\nex-clergyman, a speculator on whose career French archives cast an\r\nunfavorable light, and one cannot be certain that no liberties were\r\ntaken with Paine's proofs.\r\n\r\nI may repeat here what I have stated in the outset of my editorial work\r\non Paine that my rule is to correct obvious misprints, and also any\r\npunctuation which seems to render the sense less clear. And to that I\r\nwill now add that in following Paine's quotations from the Bible I have\r\nadopted the Plan now generally used in place of his occasionally too\r\nextended writing out of book, chapter, and verse.\r\n\r\nPaine was imprisoned in the Luxembourg on December 28, 1793, and\r\nreleased on November 4, 1794. His liberation was secured by his old\r\nfriend, James Monroe (afterwards President), who had succeeded his\r\n(Paine's) relentless enemy, Gouverneur Morris, as American Minister in\r\nParis. He was found by Monroe more dead than alive from semi-starvation,\r\ncold, and an abscess contracted in prison, and taken to the Minister's\r\nown residence. It was not supposed that he could survive, and he owed\r\nhis life to the tender care of Mr. and Mrs. Monroe. It was while thus\r\na prisoner in his room, with death still hovering over him, that Paine\r\nwrote Part Second of \"The Age of Reason.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was published in London by H.D. Symonds on October 25, 1795,\r\nand claimed to be \"from the Author's manuscript.\" It is marked as\r\n\"Entered at Stationers Hall,\" and prefaced by an apologetic note of\r\n\"The Bookseller to the Public,\" whose commonplaces about avoiding both\r\nprejudice and partiality, and considering \"both sides,\" need not be\r\nquoted. While his volume was going through the press in Paris, Paine\r\nheard of the publication in London, which drew from him the following\r\nhurried note to a London publisher, no doubt Daniel Isaacs Eaton:\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--I have seen advertised in the London papers the second Edition\r\n[part] of the Age of Reason, printed, the advertisement says, from the\r\nAuthor's Manuscript, and entered at Stationers Hall. I have never sent\r\nany manuscript to any person. It is therefore a forgery to say it is\r\nprinted from the author's manuscript; and I suppose is done to give the\r\nPublisher a pretence of Copy Right, which he has no title to.\r\n\r\n\"I send you a printed copy, which is the only one I have sent to London.\r\nI wish you to make a cheap edition of it. I know not by what means any\r\ncopy has got over to London. If any person has made a manuscript copy\r\nI have no doubt but it is full of errors. I wish you would talk to Mr.\r\n----- upon this subject as I wish to know by what means this trick has\r\nbeen played, and from whom the publisher has got possession of any copy.\r\n\r\n\"T. PAINE.\r\n\r\n\"PARIS, December 4, 1795\"\r\n\r\nEaton's cheap edition appeared January 1, 1796, with the above letter on\r\nthe reverse of the title. The blank in the note was probably \"Symonds\"\r\nin the original, and possibly that publisher was imposed upon. Eaton,\r\nalready in trouble for printing one of Paine's political pamphlets, fled\r\nto America, and an edition of the \"Age of Reason\" was issued under a new\r\ntitle; no publisher appears; it is said to be \"printed for, and sold by\r\nall the Booksellers in Great Britain and Ireland.\" It is also said to\r\nbe \"By Thomas Paine, author of several remarkable performances.\" I have\r\nnever found any copy of this anonymous edition except the one in my\r\npossession. It is evidently the edition which was suppressed by the\r\nprosecution of Williams for selling a copy of it.\r\n\r\nA comparison with Paine's revised edition reveals a good many clerical\r\nand verbal errors in Symonds, though few that affect the sense. The\r\nworst are in the preface, where, instead of \"1793,\" the misleading\r\ndate \"1790\" is given as the year at whose close Paine completed Part\r\nFirst,--an error that spread far and wide and was fastened on by his\r\ncalumnious American \"biographer,\" Cheetham, to prove his inconsistency.\r\nThe editors have been fairly demoralized by, and have altered in\r\ndifferent ways, the following sentence of the preface in Symonds: \"The\r\nintolerant spirit of religious persecution had transferred itself into\r\npolitics; the tribunals, styled Revolutionary, supplied the place of the\r\nInquisition; and the Guillotine of the State outdid the Fire and Faggot\r\nof the Church.\" The rogue who copied this little knew the care with\r\nwhich Paine weighed words, and that he would never call persecution\r\n\"religious,\" nor connect the guillotine with the \"State,\" nor concede\r\nthat with all its horrors it had outdone the history of fire and faggot.\r\nWhat Paine wrote was: \"The intolerant spirit of church persecution had\r\ntransferred itself into politics; the tribunals, styled Revolutionary,\r\nsupplied the place of an Inquisition and the Guillotine, of the Stake.\"\r\n\r\nAn original letter of Paine, in the possession of Joseph Cowen, ex-M.P.,\r\nwhich that gentleman permits me to bring to light, besides being one\r\nof general interest makes clear the circumstances of the original\r\npublication. Although the name of the correspondent does not appear on\r\nthe letter, it was certainly written to Col. John Fellows of New\r\nYork, who copyrighted Part I. of the \"Age of Reason.\" He published the\r\npamphlets of Joel Barlow, to whom Paine confided his manuscript on his\r\nway to prison. Fellows was afterwards Paine's intimate friend in New\r\nYork, and it was chiefly due to him that some portions of the author's\r\nwritings, left in manuscript to Madame Bonneville while she was a\r\nfreethinker were rescued from her devout destructiveness after her\r\nreturn to Catholicism. The letter which Mr. Cowen sends me, is dated at\r\nParis, January 20, 1797.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--Your friend Mr. Caritat being on the point of his departure for\r\nAmerica, I make it the opportunity of writing to you. I received two\r\nletters from you with some pamphlets a considerable time past, in which\r\nyou inform me of your entering a copyright of the first part of the Age\r\nof Reason: when I return to America we will settle for that matter.\r\n\r\n\"As Doctor Franklin has been my intimate friend for thirty years past\r\nyou will naturally see the reason of my continuing the connection with\r\nhis grandson. I printed here (Paris) about fifteen thousand of the\r\nsecond part of the Age of Reason, which I sent to Mr. F[ranklin] Bache.\r\nI gave him notice of it in September 1795 and the copy-right by my\r\nown direction was entered by him. The books did not arrive till April\r\nfollowing, but he had advertised it long before.\r\n\r\n\"I sent to him in August last a manuscript letter of about 70 pages,\r\nfrom me to Mr. Washington to be printed in a pamphlet. Mr. Barnes of\r\nPhiladelphia carried the letter from me over to London to be forwarded\r\nto America. It went by the ship Hope, Cap: Harley, who since his return\r\nfrom America told me that he put it into the post office at New York for\r\nBache. I have yet no certain account of its publication. I mention this\r\nthat the letter may be enquired after, in case it has not been published\r\nor has not arrived to Mr. Bache. Barnes wrote to me, from London 29\r\nAugust informing me that he was offered three hundred pounds sterling\r\nfor the manuscript. The offer was refused because it was my intention it\r\nshould not appear till it appeared in America, as that, and not England\r\nwas the place for its operation.\r\n\r\n\"You ask me by your letter to Mr. Caritat for a list of my several\r\nworks, in order to publish a collection of them. This is an undertaking\r\nI have always reserved for myself. It not only belongs to me of right,\r\nbut nobody but myself can do it; and as every author is accountable (at\r\nleast in reputation) for his works, he only is the person to do it. If\r\nhe neglects it in his life-time the case is altered. It is my intention\r\nto return to America in the course of the present year. I shall then\r\n[do] it by subscription, with historical notes. As this work will employ\r\nmany persons in different parts of the Union, I will confer with you\r\nupon the subject, and such part of it as will suit you to\r\nundertake, will be at your choice. I have sustained so much loss, by\r\ndisinterestedness and inattention to money matters, and by accidents,\r\nthat I am obliged to look closer to my affairs than I have done. The\r\nprinter (an Englishman) whom I employed here to print the second part\r\nof 'the Age of Reason' made a manuscript copy of the work while he was\r\nprinting it, which he sent to London and sold. It was by this means that\r\nan edition of it came out in London.\r\n\r\n\"We are waiting here for news from America of the state of the federal\r\nelections. You will have heard long before this reaches you that the\r\nFrench government has refused to receive Mr. Pinckney as minister. While\r\nMr. Monroe was minister he had the opportunity of softening matters with\r\nthis government, for he was in good credit with them tho' they were in\r\nhigh indignation at the infidelity of the Washington Administration.\r\nIt is time that Mr. Washington retire, for he has played off so much\r\nprudent hypocrisy between France and England that neither government\r\nbelieves anything he says.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend, etc.,\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS PAINE.\"\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Symonds' stolen edition must have got ahead of that\r\nsent by Paine to Franklin Bache, for some of its errors continue in\r\nall modern American editions to the present day, as well as in those of\r\nEngland. For in England it was only the shilling edition--that\r\nrevised by Paine--which was suppressed. Symonds, who ministered to the\r\nhalf-crown folk, and who was also publisher of replies to Paine, was\r\nleft undisturbed about his pirated edition, and the new Society for the\r\nsuppression of Vice and Immorality fastened on one Thomas Williams, who\r\nsold pious tracts but was also convicted (June 24, 1797) of having sold\r\none copy of the \"Age of Reason.\" Erskine, who had defended Paine at his\r\ntrial for the \"Rights of Man,\" conducted the prosecution of Williams.\r\nHe gained the victory from a packed jury, but was not much elated by\r\nit, especially after a certain adventure on his way to Lincoln's Inn. He\r\nfelt his coat clutched and beheld at his feet a woman bathed in tears.\r\nShe led him into the small book-shop of Thomas Williams, not yet called\r\nup for judgment, and there he beheld his victim stitching tracts in a\r\nwretched little room, where there were three children, two suffering\r\nwith Smallpox. He saw that it would be ruin and even a sort of murder to\r\ntake away to prison the husband, who was not a freethinker, and lamented\r\nhis publication of the book, and a meeting of the Society which had\r\nretained him was summoned. There was a full meeting, the Bishop of\r\nLondon (Porteus) in the chair. Erskine reminded them that Williams was\r\nyet to be brought up for sentence, described the scene he had witnessed,\r\nand Williams' penitence, and, as the book was now suppressed, asked\r\npermission to move for a nominal sentence. Mercy, he urged, was a part\r\nof the Christianity they were defending. Not one of the Society took his\r\nside,--not even \"philanthropic\" Wilberforce--and Erskine threw up his\r\nbrief. This action of Erskine led the Judge to give Williams only a year\r\nin prison instead of the three he said had been intended.\r\n\r\nWhile Williams was in prison the orthodox colporteurs were circulating\r\nErskine's speech on Christianity, but also an anonymous sermon \"On the\r\nExistence and Attributes of the Deity,\" all of which was from Paine's\r\n\"Age of Reason,\" except a brief \"Address to the Deity\" appended.\r\nThis picturesque anomaly was repeated in the circulation of Paine's\r\n\"Discourse to the Theophilanthropists\" (their and the author's names\r\nremoved) under the title of \"Atheism Refuted.\" Both of these pamphlets\r\nare now before me, and beside them a London tract of one page just sent\r\nfor my spiritual benefit. This is headed \"A Word of Caution.\" It begins\r\nby mentioning the \"pernicious doctrines of Paine,\" the first being \"that\r\nthere is No GOD\" (sic,) then proceeds to adduce evidences of divine\r\nexistence taken from Paine's works. It should be added that this one\r\ndingy page is the only \"survival\" of the ancient Paine effigy in the\r\ntract form which I have been able to find in recent years, and to this\r\nno Society or Publisher's name is attached.\r\n\r\nThe imprisonment of Williams was the beginning of a thirty years' war\r\nfor religious liberty in England, in the course of which occurred many\r\nnotable events, such as Eaton receiving homage in his pillory at Choring\r\nCross, and the whole Carlile family imprisoned,--its head imprisoned\r\nmore than nine years for publishing the \"Age of Reason.\" This last\r\nvictory of persecution was suicidal. Gentlemen of wealth, not adherents\r\nof Paine, helped in setting Carlile up in business in Fleet Street,\r\nwhere free-thinking publications have since been sold without\r\ninterruption. But though Liberty triumphed in one sense, the \"Age of\r\nReason.\" remained to some extent suppressed among those whose attention\r\nit especially merited. Its original prosecution by a Society for the\r\nSuppression of Vice (a device to, relieve the Crown) amounted to a libel\r\nupon a morally clean book, restricting its perusal in families; and the\r\nfact that the shilling book sold by and among humble people was alone\r\nprosecuted, diffused among the educated an equally false notion that the\r\n\"Age of Reason\" was vulgar and illiterate. The theologians, as we\r\nhave seen, estimated more justly the ability of their antagonist,\r\nthe collaborator of Franklin, Rittenhouse, and Clymer, on whom the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania had conferred the degree of Master of\r\nArts,--but the gentry confused Paine with the class described by Burke\r\nas \"the swinish multitude.\" Skepticism, or its free utterance, was\r\ntemporarily driven out of polite circles by its complication with the\r\nout-lawed vindicator of the \"Rights of Man.\" But that long combat has\r\nnow passed away. Time has reduced the \"Age of Reason\" from a flag of\r\npopular radicalism to a comparatively conservative treatise, so far as\r\nits negations are concerned. An old friend tells me that in his youth\r\nhe heard a sermon in which the preacher declared that \"Tom Paine was\r\nso wicked that he could not be buried; his bones were thrown into a box\r\nwhich was bandied about the world till it came to a button-manufacturer;\r\nand now Paine is travelling round the world in the form of buttons!\"\r\nThis variant of the Wandering Jew myth may now be regarded as\r\nunconscious homage to the author whose metaphorical bones may be\r\nrecognized in buttons now fashionable, and some even found useful in\r\nholding clerical vestments together.\r\n\r\nBut the careful reader will find in Paine's \"Age of Reason\" something\r\nbeyond negations, and in conclusion I will especially call attention to\r\nthe new departure in Theism indicated in a passage corresponding to a\r\nfamous aphorism of Kant, indicated by a note in Part II. The discovery\r\nalready mentioned, that Part I. was written at least fourteen years\r\nbefore Part II., led me to compare the two; and it is plain that while\r\nthe earlier work is an amplification of Newtonian Deism, based on the\r\nphenomena of planetary motion, the work of 1795 bases belief in God on\r\n\"the universal display of himself in the works of the creation and by\r\nthat repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad actions, and disposition\r\nto do good ones.\" This exaltation of the moral nature of man to be the\r\nfoundation of theistic religion, though now familiar, was a hundred\r\nyears ago a new affirmation; it has led on a conception of deity\r\nsubversive of last-century deism, it has steadily humanized religion,\r\nand its ultimate philosophical and ethical results have not yet been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I - THE AUTHOR'S PROFESSION OF FAITH.\r\n\r\nIT has been my intention, for several years past, to publish my thoughts\r\nupon religion; I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the\r\nsubject, and from that consideration, had reserved it to a more advanced\r\nperiod of life. I intended it to be the last offering I should make to\r\nmy fellow-citizens of all nations, and that at a time when the purity of\r\nthe motive that induced me to it could not admit of a question, even by\r\nthose who might disapprove the work.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France, of the total\r\nabolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything\r\nappertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles\r\nof faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work\r\nof this kind exceedingly necessary, lest, in the general wreck of\r\nsuperstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we\r\nlose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\r\n\r\nAs several of my colleagues, and others of my fellow-citizens of France,\r\nhave given me the example of making their voluntary and individual\r\nprofession of faith, I also will make mine; and I do this with all that\r\nsincerity and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI believe the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties\r\nconsist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our\r\nfellow-creatures happy.\r\n\r\nBut, lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in\r\naddition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the\r\nthings I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by\r\nthe Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the\r\nProtestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my\r\nown church.\r\n\r\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or\r\nTurkish, appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify\r\nand enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\r\n\r\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe\r\notherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to\r\nmine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally\r\nfaithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in\r\ndisbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express\r\nit, that mental lying has produced in society. When a man has so far\r\ncorrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe\r\nhis professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared\r\nhimself for the commission of every other crime. He takes up the trade\r\nof a priest for the sake of gain, and, in order to qualify himself for\r\nthat trade, he begins with a perjury. Can we conceive anything more\r\ndestructive to morality than this?\r\n\r\nSoon after I had published the pamphlet COMMON SENSE, in America, I saw\r\nthe exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government\r\nwould be followed by a revolution in the system of religion. The\r\nadulterous connection of church and state, wherever it had taken place,\r\nwhether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, had so effectually prohibited, by\r\npains and penalties, every discussion upon established creeds, and upon\r\nfirst principles of religion, that until the system of government should\r\nbe changed, those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before\r\nthe world; but that whenever this should be done, a revolution in the\r\nsystem of religion would follow. Human inventions and priest-craft\r\nwould be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed, and\r\nunadulterated belief of one God, and no more.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II - OF MISSIONS AND REVELATIONS.\r\n\r\nEVERY national church or religion has established itself by pretending\r\nsome special mission from God, communicated to certain individuals. The\r\nJews have their Moses; the Christians their Jesus Christ, their apostles\r\nand saints; and the Turks their Mahomet; as if the way to God was not\r\nopen to every man alike.\r\n\r\nEach of those churches shows certain books, which they call revelation,\r\nor the Word of God. The Jews say that their Word of God was given by God\r\nto Moses face to face; the Christians say, that their Word of God came\r\nby divine inspiration; and the Turks say, that their Word of God (the\r\nKoran) was brought by an angel from heaven. Each of those churches\r\naccuses the other of unbelief; and, for my own part, I disbelieve them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAs it is necessary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I\r\nproceed further into the subject, offer some observations on the word\r\n'revelation.' Revelation when applied to religion, means something\r\ncommunicated immediately from God to man.\r\n\r\nNo one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a\r\ncommunication if he pleases. But admitting, for the sake of a case, that\r\nsomething has been revealed to a certain person, and not revealed to any\r\nother person, it is revelation to that person only. When he tells it to\r\na second person, a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on, it\r\nceases to be a revelation to all those persons. It is revelation to the\r\nfirst person only, and hearsay to every other, and, consequently, they\r\nare not obliged to believe it.\r\n\r\nIt is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call anything a revelation\r\nthat comes to us at second hand, either verbally or in writing.\r\nRevelation is necessarily limited to the first communication. After\r\nthis, it is only an account of something which that person says was\r\na revelation made to him; and though he may find himself obliged to\r\nbelieve it, it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same\r\nmanner, for it was not a revelation made to me, and I have only his word\r\nfor it that it was made to him.\r\n\r\nWhen Moses told the children of Israel that he received the two tables\r\nof the commandments from the hand of God, they were not obliged to\r\nbelieve him, because they had no other authority for it than his telling\r\nthem so; and I have no other authority for it than some historian\r\ntelling me so, the commandments carrying no internal evidence of\r\ndivinity with them. They contain some good moral precepts such as any\r\nman qualified to be a lawgiver or a legislator could produce himself,\r\nwithout having recourse to supernatural intervention. [NOTE: It is,\r\nhowever, necessary to except the declamation which says that God 'visits\r\nthe sins of the fathers upon the children'. This is contrary to every\r\nprinciple of moral justice.--Author.]\r\n\r\nWhen I am told that the Koran was written in Heaven, and brought to\r\nMahomet by an angel, the account comes to near the same kind of hearsay\r\nevidence and second hand authority as the former. I did not see the\r\nangel myself, and therefore I have a right not to believe it.\r\n\r\nWhen also I am told that a woman, called the Virgin Mary, said, or gave\r\nout, that she was with child without any cohabitation with a man, and\r\nthat her betrothed husband, Joseph, said that an angel told him so, I\r\nhave a right to believe them or not: such a circumstance required a\r\nmuch stronger evidence than their bare word for it: but we have not even\r\nthis; for neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such matter themselves.\r\nIt is only reported by others that they said so. It is hearsay upon\r\nhearsay, and I do not chose to rest my belief upon such evidence.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, not difficult to account for the credit that was given\r\nto the story of Jesus Christ being the Son of God. He was born when the\r\nheathen mythology had still some fashion and repute in the world, and\r\nthat mythology had prepared the people for the belief of such a story.\r\nAlmost all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology\r\nwere reputed to be the sons of some of their gods. It was not a new\r\nthing at that time to believe a man to have been celestially begotten;\r\nthe intercourse of gods with women was then a matter of familiar\r\nopinion. Their Jupiter, according to their accounts, had cohabited with\r\nhundreds; the story therefore had nothing in it either new, wonderful,\r\nor obscene; it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among\r\nthe people called Gentiles, or mythologists, and it was those people\r\nonly that believed it. The Jews, who had kept strictly to the belief of\r\none God, and no more, and who had always rejected the heathen mythology,\r\nnever credited the story.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how the theory of what is called the Christian\r\nChurch, sprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology. A direct\r\nincorporation took place in the first instance, by making the reputed\r\nfounder to be celestially begotten. The trinity of gods that then\r\nfollowed was no other than a reduction of the former plurality, which\r\nwas about twenty or thirty thousand. The statue of Mary succeeded the\r\nstatue of Diana of Ephesus. The deification of heroes changed into the\r\ncanonization of saints. The Mythologists had gods for everything; the\r\nChristian Mythologists had saints for everything. The church became as\r\ncrowded with the one, as the pantheon had been with the other; and Rome\r\nwas the place of both. The Christian theory is little else than the\r\nidolatry of the ancient mythologists, accommodated to the purposes\r\nof power and revenue; and it yet remains to reason and philosophy to\r\nabolish the amphibious fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III - CONCERNING THE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST, AND HIS HISTORY.\r\n\r\nNOTHING that is here said can apply, even with the most distant\r\ndisrespect, to the real character of Jesus Christ. He was a virtuous and\r\nan amiable man. The morality that he preached and practiced was of the\r\nmost benevolent kind; and though similar systems of morality had been\r\npreached by Confucius, and by some of the Greek philosophers, many years\r\nbefore, by the Quakers since, and by many good men in all ages, it has\r\nnot been exceeded by any.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ wrote no account of himself, of his birth, parentage, or\r\nanything else. Not a line of what is called the New Testament is of his\r\nwriting. The history of him is altogether the work of other people; and\r\nas to the account given of his resurrection and ascension, it was the\r\nnecessary counterpart to the story of his birth. His historians, having\r\nbrought him into the world in a supernatural manner, were obliged to\r\ntake him out again in the same manner, or the first part of the story\r\nmust have fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told, exceeds\r\neverything that went before it. The first part, that of the miraculous\r\nconception, was not a thing that admitted of publicity; and therefore\r\nthe tellers of this part of the story had this advantage, that though\r\nthey might not be credited, they could not be detected. They could not\r\nbe expected to prove it, because it was not one of those things that\r\nadmitted of proof, and it was impossible that the person of whom it was\r\ntold could prove it himself.\r\n\r\nBut the resurrection of a dead person from the grave, and his ascension\r\nthrough the air, is a thing very different, as to the evidence it admits\r\nof, to the invisible conception of a child in the womb. The resurrection\r\nand ascension, supposing them to have taken place, admitted of public\r\nand ocular demonstration, like that of the ascension of a balloon, or\r\nthe sun at noon day, to all Jerusalem at least. A thing which everybody\r\nis required to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it\r\nshould be equal to all, and universal; and as the public visibility of\r\nthis last related act was the only evidence that could give sanction\r\nto the former part, the whole of it falls to the ground, because that\r\nevidence never was given. Instead of this, a small number of persons,\r\nnot more than eight or nine, are introduced as proxies for the whole\r\nworld, to say they saw it, and all the rest of the world are called\r\nupon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not believe the\r\nresurrection; and, as they say, would not believe without having ocular\r\nand manual demonstration himself. So neither will I; and the reason is\r\nequally as good for me, and for every other person, as for Thomas.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain to attempt to palliate or disguise this matter. The story,\r\nso far as relates to the supernatural part, has every mark of fraud and\r\nimposition stamped upon the face of it. Who were the authors of it is\r\nas impossible for us now to know, as it is for us to be assured that the\r\nbooks in which the account is related were written by the persons whose\r\nnames they bear. The best surviving evidence we now have respecting this\r\naffair is the Jews. They are regularly descended from the people who\r\nlived in the time this resurrection and ascension is said to have\r\nhappened, and they say 'it is not true.' It has long appeared to me a\r\nstrange inconsistency to cite the Jews as a proof of the truth of the\r\nstory. It is just the same as if a man were to say, I will prove the\r\ntruth of what I have told you, by producing the people who say it is\r\nfalse.\r\n\r\nThat such a person as Jesus Christ existed, and that he was crucified,\r\nwhich was the mode of execution at that day, are historical relations\r\nstrictly within the limits of probability. He preached most excellent\r\nmorality, and the equality of man; but he preached also against the\r\ncorruptions and avarice of the Jewish priests, and this brought upon\r\nhim the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of priest-hood. The\r\naccusation which those priests brought against him was that of sedition\r\nand conspiracy against the Roman government, to which the Jews were\r\nthen subject and tributary; and it is not improbable that the Roman\r\ngovernment might have some secret apprehension of the effects of his\r\ndoctrine as well as the Jewish priests; neither is it improbable that\r\nJesus Christ had in contemplation the delivery of the Jewish nation\r\nfrom the bondage of the Romans. Between the two, however, this virtuous\r\nreformer and revolutionist lost his life. [NOTE: The French work has\r\nhere: \"However this may be, for one or the other of these suppositions\r\nthis virtuous reformer, this revolutionist, too little imitated,\r\ntoo much forgotten, too much misunderstood, lost his life.\"--Editor.\r\n(Conway)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV - OF THE BASES OF CHRISTIANITY.\r\n\r\nIT is upon this plain narrative of facts, together with another case I\r\nam going to mention, that the Christian mythologists, calling themselves\r\nthe Christian Church, have erected their fable, which for absurdity\r\nand extravagance is not exceeded by anything that is to be found in the\r\nmythology of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe ancient mythologists tell us that the race of Giants made war\r\nagainst Jupiter, and that one of them threw a hundred rocks against him\r\nat one throw; that Jupiter defeated him with thunder, and confined\r\nhim afterwards under Mount Etna; and that every time the Giant turns\r\nhimself, Mount Etna belches fire. It is here easy to see that the\r\ncircumstance of the mountain, that of its being a volcano, suggested the\r\nidea of the fable; and that the fable is made to fit and wind itself up\r\nwith that circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe Christian mythologists tell that their Satan made war against the\r\nAlmighty, who defeated him, and confined him afterwards, not under a\r\nmountain, but in a pit. It is here easy to see that the first fable\r\nsuggested the idea of the second; for the fable of Jupiter and the\r\nGiants was told many hundred years before that of Satan.\r\n\r\nThus far the ancient and the Christian mythologists differ very little\r\nfrom each other. But the latter have contrived to carry the matter much\r\nfarther. They have contrived to connect the fabulous part of the story\r\nof Jesus Christ with the fable originating from Mount Etna; and, in\r\norder to make all the parts of the story tie together, they have taken\r\nto their aid the traditions of the Jews; for the Christian mythology is\r\nmade up partly from the ancient mythology, and partly from the Jewish\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nThe Christian mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were\r\nobliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is\r\nthen introduced into the garden of Eden in the shape of a snake, or a\r\nserpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with\r\nEve, who is no ways surprised to hear a snake talk; and the issue of\r\nthis tete-a-tate is, that he persuades her to eat an apple, and the\r\neating of that apple damns all mankind.\r\n\r\nAfter giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have\r\nsupposed that the church mythologists would have been kind enough to\r\nsend him back again to the pit, or, if they had not done this, that they\r\nwould have put a mountain upon him, (for they say that their faith\r\ncan remove a mountain) or have put him under a mountain, as the former\r\nmythologists had done, to prevent his getting again among the women,\r\nand doing more mischief. But instead of this, they leave him at large,\r\nwithout even obliging him to give his parole. The secret of which is,\r\nthat they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of\r\nmaking him, they bribed him to stay. They promised him ALL the Jews, ALL\r\nthe Turks by anticipation, nine-tenths of the world beside, and Mahomet\r\ninto the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulness of the\r\nChristian Mythology?\r\n\r\nHaving thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven, in which none\r\nof the combatants could be either killed or wounded--put Satan into\r\nthe pit--let him out again--given him a triumph over the whole\r\ncreation--damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, there Christian\r\nmythologists bring the two ends of their fable together. They represent\r\nthis virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and\r\nman, and also the Son of God, celestially begotten, on purpose to be\r\nsacrificed, because they say that Eve in her longing [NOTE: The French\r\nwork has: \"yielding to an unrestrained appetite.\"--Editor.] had eaten an\r\napple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V - EXAMINATION IN DETAIL OF THE PRECEDING BASES.\r\n\r\nPUTTING aside everything that might excite laughter by its absurdity,\r\nor detestation by its profaneness, and confining ourselves merely to\r\nan examination of the parts, it is impossible to conceive a story more\r\nderogatory to the Almighty, more inconsistent with his wisdom, more\r\ncontradictory to his power, than this story is.\r\n\r\nIn order to make for it a foundation to rise upon, the inventors were\r\nunder the necessity of giving to the being whom they call Satan a power\r\nequally as great, if not greater, than they attribute to the Almighty.\r\nThey have not only given him the power of liberating himself from\r\nthe pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power\r\nincrease afterwards to infinity. Before this fall they represent him\r\nonly as an angel of limited existence, as they represent the rest.\r\nAfter his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipresent. He exists\r\neverywhere, and at the same time. He occupies the whole immensity of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nNot content with this deification of Satan, they represent him as\r\ndefeating by stratagem, in the shape of an animal of the creation,\r\nall the power and wisdom of the Almighty. They represent him as having\r\ncompelled the Almighty to the direct necessity either of surrendering\r\nthe whole of the creation to the government and sovereignty of this\r\nSatan, or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth,\r\nand exhibiting himself upon a cross in the shape of a man.\r\n\r\nHad the inventors of this story told it the contrary way, that is, had\r\nthey represented the Almighty as compelling Satan to exhibit himself\r\non a cross in the shape of a snake, as a punishment for his\r\nnew transgression, the story would have been less absurd, less\r\ncontradictory. But, instead of this they make the transgressor triumph,\r\nand the Almighty fall.\r\n\r\nThat many good men have believed this strange fable, and lived very good\r\nlives under that belief (for credulity is not a crime) is what I have no\r\ndoubt of. In the first place, they were educated to believe it, and they\r\nwould have believed anything else in the same manner. There are also\r\nmany who have been so enthusiastically enraptured by what they conceived\r\nto be the infinite love of God to man, in making a sacrifice of himself,\r\nthat the vehemence of the idea has forbidden and deterred them from\r\nexamining into the absurdity and profaneness of the story. The more\r\nunnatural anything is, the more is it capable of becoming the object\r\nof dismal admiration. [NOTE: The French work has \"blind and\" preceding\r\ndismal.--Editor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI - OF THE TRUE THEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nBUT if objects for gratitude and admiration are our desire, do they not\r\npresent themselves every hour to our eyes? Do we not see a fair creation\r\nprepared to receive us the instant we are born--a world furnished to our\r\nhands, that cost us nothing? Is it we that light up the sun; that pour\r\ndown the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we sleep\r\nor wake, the vast machinery of the universe still goes on. Are these\r\nthings, and the blessings they indicate in future, nothing to, us? Can\r\nour gross feelings be excited by no other subjects than tragedy and\r\nsuicide? Or is the gloomy pride of man become so intolerable, that\r\nnothing can flatter it but a sacrifice of the Creator?\r\n\r\nI know that this bold investigation will alarm many, but it would be\r\npaying too great a compliment to their credulity to forbear it on that\r\naccount. The times and the subject demand it to be done. The suspicion\r\nthat the theory of what is called the Christian church is fabulous, is\r\nbecoming very extensive in all countries; and it will be a consolation\r\nto men staggering under that suspicion, and doubting what to believe and\r\nwhat to disbelieve, to see the subject freely investigated. I therefore\r\npass on to an examination of the books called the Old and the New\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII - EXAMINATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.\r\n\r\nTHESE books, beginning with Genesis and ending with Revelations, (which,\r\nby the bye, is a book of riddles that requires a revelation to explain\r\nit) are, we are told, the word of God. It is, therefore, proper for\r\nus to know who told us so, that we may know what credit to give to the\r\nreport. The answer to this question is, that nobody can tell, except\r\nthat we tell one another so. The case, however, historically appears to\r\nbe as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen the church mythologists established their system, they collected\r\nall the writings they could find, and managed them as they pleased. It\r\nis a matter altogether of uncertainty to us whether such of the writings\r\nas now appear under the name of the Old and the New Testament, are in\r\nthe same state in which those collectors say they found them; or whether\r\nthey added, altered, abridged, or dressed them up.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, they decided by vote which of the books out of the\r\ncollection they had made, should be the WORD OF GOD, and which should\r\nnot. They rejected several; they voted others to be doubtful, such as\r\nthe books called the Apocrypha; and those books which had a majority of\r\nvotes, were voted to be the word of God. Had they voted otherwise, all\r\nthe people since calling themselves Christians had believed otherwise;\r\nfor the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other. Who the\r\npeople were that did all this, we know nothing of. They call themselves\r\nby the general name of the Church; and this is all we know of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nAs we have no other external evidence or authority for believing these\r\nbooks to be the word of God, than what I have mentioned, which is no\r\nevidence or authority at all, I come, in the next place, to examine the\r\ninternal evidence contained in the books themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the former part of this essay, I have spoken of revelation. I now\r\nproceed further with that subject, for the purpose of applying it to the\r\nbooks in question.\r\n\r\nRevelation is a communication of something, which the person, to whom\r\nthat thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done a thing,\r\nor seen it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it, or\r\nseen it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it.\r\n\r\nRevelation, therefore, cannot be applied to anything done upon earth of\r\nwhich man is himself the actor or the witness; and consequently all the\r\nhistorical and anecdotal part of the Bible, which is almost the whole of\r\nit, is not within the meaning and compass of the word revelation, and,\r\ntherefore, is not the word of God.\r\n\r\nWhen Samson ran off with the gate-posts of Gaza, if he ever did so, (and\r\nwhether he did or not is nothing to us,) or when he visited his Delilah,\r\nor caught his foxes, or did anything else, what has revelation to do\r\nwith these things? If they were facts, he could tell them himself; or\r\nhis secretary, if he kept one, could write them, if they were worth\r\neither telling or writing; and if they were fictions, revelation could\r\nnot make them true; and whether true or not, we are neither the better\r\nnor the wiser for knowing them. When we contemplate the immensity of\r\nthat Being, who directs and governs the incomprehensible WHOLE, of which\r\nthe utmost ken of human sight can discover but a part, we ought to feel\r\nshame at calling such paltry stories the word of God.\r\n\r\nAs to the account of the creation, with which the book of Genesis opens,\r\nit has all the appearance of being a tradition which the Israelites had\r\namong them before they came into Egypt; and after their departure from\r\nthat country, they put it at the head of their history, without telling,\r\nas it is most probable that they did not know, how they came by it.\r\nThe manner in which the account opens, shows it to be traditionary. It\r\nbegins abruptly. It is nobody that speaks. It is nobody that hears. It\r\nis addressed to nobody. It has neither first, second, nor third person.\r\nIt has every criterion of being a tradition. It has no voucher. Moses\r\ndoes not take it upon himself by introducing it with the formality that\r\nhe uses on other occasions, such as that of saying, \"The Lords spake\r\nunto Moses, saying.\"\r\n\r\nWhy it has been called the Mosaic account of the creation, I am at\r\na loss to conceive. Moses, I believe, was too good a judge of such\r\nsubjects to put his name to that account. He had been educated among\r\nthe Egyptians, who were a people as well skilled in science, and\r\nparticularly in astronomy, as any people of their day; and the silence\r\nand caution that Moses observes, in not authenticating the account, is\r\na good negative evidence that he neither told it nor believed it.--The\r\ncase is, that every nation of people has been world-makers, and the\r\nIsraelites had as much right to set up the trade of world-making as any\r\nof the rest; and as Moses was not an Israelite, he might not chose to\r\ncontradict the tradition. The account, however, is harmless; and this is\r\nmore than can be said for many other parts of the Bible.\r\n\r\nWhenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the\r\ncruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with\r\nwhich more than half the Bible [NOTE: It must be borne in mind that by\r\nthe \"Bible\" Paine always means the Old Testament alone.--Editor.] is\r\nfilled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a\r\ndemon, than the Word of God. It is a history of wickedness, that\r\nhas served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my own part, I\r\nsincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.\r\n\r\nWe scarcely meet with anything, a few phrases excepted, but what\r\ndeserves either our abhorrence or our contempt, till we come to the\r\nmiscellaneous parts of the Bible. In the anonymous publications, the\r\nPsalms, and the Book of Job, more particularly in the latter, we find\r\na great deal of elevated sentiment reverentially expressed of the power\r\nand benignity of the Almighty; but they stand on no higher rank than\r\nmany other compositions on similar subjects, as well before that time as\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe Proverbs which are said to be Solomon's, though most probably\r\na collection, (because they discover a knowledge of life, which his\r\nsituation excluded him from knowing) are an instructive table of ethics.\r\nThey are inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not\r\nmore wise and oeconomical than those of the American Franklin.\r\n\r\nAll the remaining parts of the Bible, generally known by the name of the\r\nProphets, are the works of the Jewish poets and itinerant preachers,\r\nwho mixed poetry, anecdote, and devotion together--and those works still\r\nretain the air and style of poetry, though in translation. [NOTE: As\r\nthere are many readers who do not see that a composition is poetry,\r\nunless it be in rhyme, it is for their information that I add this note.\r\n\r\nPoetry consists principally in two things--imagery and composition. The\r\ncomposition of poetry differs from that of prose in the manner of mixing\r\nlong and short syllables together. Take a long syllable out of a line\r\nof poetry, and put a short one in the room of it, or put a long syllable\r\nwhere a short one should be, and that line will lose its poetical\r\nharmony. It will have an effect upon the line like that of misplacing a\r\nnote in a song.\r\n\r\nThe imagery in those books called the Prophets appertains altogether to\r\npoetry. It is fictitious, and often extravagant, and not admissible in\r\nany other kind of writing than poetry.\r\n\r\nTo show that these writings are composed in poetical numbers, I will\r\ntake ten syllables, as they stand in the book, and make a line of the\r\nsame number of syllables, (heroic measure) that shall rhyme with the\r\nlast word. It will then be seen that the composition of those books is\r\npoetical measure. The instance I shall first produce is from Isaiah:--\r\n\r\n  \"Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth\r\n  'T is God himself that calls attention forth.\r\n\r\nAnother instance I shall quote is from the mournful Jeremiah, to which\r\nI shall add two other lines, for the purpose of carrying out the figure,\r\nand showing the intention of the poet.\r\n\r\n  \"O, that mine head were waters and mine eyes\r\n  Were fountains flowing like the liquid skies;\r\n  Then would I give the mighty flood release\r\n  And weep a deluge for the human race.\"--Author.]\r\n\r\nThere is not, throughout the whole book called the Bible, any word that\r\ndescribes to us what we call a poet, nor any word that describes what we\r\ncall poetry. The case is, that the word prophet, to which a later times\r\nhave affixed a new idea, was the Bible word for poet, and the word\r\n'propesying' meant the art of making poetry. It also meant the art of\r\nplaying poetry to a tune upon any instrument of music.\r\n\r\nWe read of prophesying with pipes, tabrets, and horns--of prophesying\r\nwith harps, with psalteries, with cymbals, and with every other\r\ninstrument of music then in fashion. Were we now to speak of prophesying\r\nwith a fiddle, or with a pipe and tabor, the expression would have no\r\nmeaning, or would appear ridiculous, and to some people contemptuous,\r\nbecause we have changed the meaning of the word.\r\n\r\nWe are told of Saul being among the prophets, and also that he\r\nprophesied; but we are not told what they prophesied, nor what he\r\nprophesied. The case is, there was nothing to tell; for these prophets\r\nwere a company of musicians and poets, and Saul joined in the concert,\r\nand this was called prophesying.\r\n\r\nThe account given of this affair in the book called Samuel, is, that\r\nSaul met a company of prophets; a whole company of them! coming down\r\nwith a psaltery, a tabret, a pipe, and a harp, and that they prophesied,\r\nand that he prophesied with them. But it appears afterwards, that Saul\r\nprophesied badly, that is, he performed his part badly; for it is said\r\nthat an \"evil spirit from God [NOTE: As thos; men who call themselves\r\ndivines and commentators are very fond of puzzling one another, I leave\r\nthem to contest the meaning of the first part of the phrase, that of an\r\nevil spirit of God. I keep to my text. I keep to the meaning of the word\r\nprophesy.--Author.] came upon Saul, and he prophesied.\"\r\n\r\nNow, were there no other passage in the book called the Bible, than\r\nthis, to demonstrate to us that we have lost the original meaning of the\r\nword prophesy, and substituted another meaning in its place, this alone\r\nwould be sufficient; for it is impossible to use and apply the word\r\nprophesy, in the place it is here used and applied, if we give to it the\r\nsense which later times have affixed to it. The manner in which it is\r\nhere used strips it of all religious meaning, and shews that a man might\r\nthen be a prophet, or he might Prophesy, as he may now be a poet or a\r\nmusician, without any regard to the morality or the immorality of his\r\ncharacter. The word was originally a term of science, promiscuously\r\napplied to poetry and to music, and not restricted to any subject upon\r\nwhich poetry and music might be exercised.\r\n\r\nDeborah and Barak are called prophets, not because they predicted\r\nanything, but because they composed the poem or song that bears their\r\nname, in celebration of an act already done. David is ranked among the\r\nprophets, for he was a musician, and was also reputed to be (though\r\nperhaps very erroneously) the author of the Psalms. But Abraham, Isaac,\r\nand Jacob are not called prophets; it does not appear from any accounts\r\nwe have, that they could either sing, play music, or make poetry.\r\n\r\nWe are told of the greater and the lesser prophets. They might as well\r\ntell us of the greater and the lesser God; for there cannot be degrees\r\nin prophesying consistently with its modern sense. But there are degrees\r\nin poetry, and there-fore the phrase is reconcilable to the case, when\r\nwe understand by it the greater and the lesser poets.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether unnecessary, after this, to offer any observations upon\r\nwhat those men, styled prophets, have written. The axe goes at once\r\nto the root, by showing that the original meaning of the word has been\r\nmistaken, and consequently all the inferences that have been drawn from\r\nthose books, the devotional respect that has been paid to them, and\r\nthe laboured commentaries that have been written upon them, under\r\nthat mistaken meaning, are not worth disputing about.--In many things,\r\nhowever, the writings of the Jewish poets deserve a better fate than\r\nthat of being bound up, as they now are, with the trash that accompanies\r\nthem, under the abused name of the Word of God.\r\n\r\nIf we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things, we must\r\nnecessarily affix the idea, not only of unchangeableness, but of the\r\nutter impossibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident\r\nwhatever, in that which we would honour with the name of the Word of\r\nGod; and therefore the Word of God cannot exist in any written or human\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe continually progressive change to which the meaning of words is\r\nsubject, the want of an universal language which renders translation\r\nnecessary, the errors to which translations are again subject, the\r\nmistakes of copyists and printers, together with the possibility of\r\nwilful alteration, are of themselves evidences that human language,\r\nwhether in speech or in print, cannot be the vehicle of the Word of\r\nGod.--The Word of God exists in something else.\r\n\r\nDid the book called the Bible excel in purity of ideas and expression\r\nall the books now extant in the world, I would not take it for my\r\nrule of faith, as being the Word of God; because the possibility would\r\nnevertheless exist of my being imposed upon. But when I see throughout\r\nthe greatest part of this book scarcely anything but a history of the\r\ngrossest vices, and a collection of the most paltry and contemptible\r\ntales, I cannot dishonour my Creator by calling it by his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII - OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.\r\n\r\nTHUS much for the Bible; I now go on to the book called the New\r\nTestament. The new Testament! that is, the 'new' Will, as if there could\r\nbe two wills of the Creator.\r\n\r\nHad it been the object or the intention of Jesus Christ to establish a\r\nnew religion, he would undoubtedly have written the system himself, or\r\nprocured it to be written in his life time. But there is no publication\r\nextant authenticated with his name. All the books called the New\r\nTestament were written after his death. He was a Jew by birth and by\r\nprofession; and he was the son of God in like manner that every other\r\nperson is; for the Creator is the Father of All.\r\n\r\nThe first four books, called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, do not give\r\na history of the life of Jesus Christ, but only detached anecdotes of\r\nhim. It appears from these books, that the whole time of his being a\r\npreacher was not more than eighteen months; and it was only during this\r\nshort time that those men became acquainted with him. They make mention\r\nof him at the age of twelve years, sitting, they say, among the Jewish\r\ndoctors, asking and answering them questions. As this was several years\r\nbefore their acquaintance with him began, it is most probable they had\r\nthis anecdote from his parents. From this time there is no account of\r\nhim for about sixteen years. Where he lived, or how he employed himself\r\nduring this interval, is not known. Most probably he was working at his\r\nfather's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not appear that\r\nhe had any school education, and the probability is, that he could not\r\nwrite, for his parents were extremely poor, as appears from their not\r\nbeing able to pay for a bed when he was born. [NOTE: One of the few\r\nerrors traceable to Paine's not having a Bible at hand while writing\r\nPart I. There is no indication that the family was poor, but the reverse\r\nmay in fact be inferred.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious that the three persons whose names are the\r\nmost universally recorded were of very obscure parentage. Moses was a\r\nfoundling; Jesus Christ was born in a stable; and Mahomet was a mule\r\ndriver. The first and the last of these men were founders of different\r\nsystems of religion; but Jesus Christ founded no new system. He called\r\nmen to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God. The\r\ngreat trait in his character is philanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he was apprehended shows that he was not much known,\r\nat that time; and it shows also that the meetings he then held with\r\nhis followers were in secret; and that he had given over or suspended\r\npreaching publicly. Judas could no otherways betray him than by giving\r\ninformation where he was, and pointing him out to the officers that went\r\nto arrest him; and the reason for employing and paying Judas to do this\r\ncould arise only from the causes already mentioned, that of his not\r\nbeing much known, and living concealed.\r\n\r\nThe idea of his concealment, not only agrees very ill with his reputed\r\ndivinity, but associates with it something of pusillanimity; and\r\nhis being betrayed, or in other words, his being apprehended, on the\r\ninformation of one of his followers, shows that he did not intend to be\r\napprehended, and consequently that he did not intend to be crucified.\r\n\r\nThe Christian mythologists tell us that Christ died for the sins of the\r\nworld, and that he came on Purpose to die. Would it not then have been\r\nthe same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox, of old age, or\r\nof anything else?\r\n\r\nThe declaratory sentence which, they say, was passed upon Adam, in case\r\nhe ate of the apple, was not, that thou shalt surely be crucified, but,\r\nthou shale surely die. The sentence was death, and not the manner of\r\ndying. Crucifixion, therefore, or any other particular manner of dying,\r\nmade no part of the sentence that Adam was to suffer, and consequently,\r\neven upon their own tactic, it could make no part of the sentence that\r\nChrist was to suffer in the room of Adam. A fever would have done as\r\nwell as a cross, if there was any occasion for either.\r\n\r\nThis sentence of death, which, they tell us, was thus passed upon Adam,\r\nmust either have meant dying naturally, that is, ceasing to live, or\r\nhave meant what these mythologists call damnation; and consequently,\r\nthe act of dying on the part of Jesus Christ, must, according to their\r\nsystem, apply as a prevention to one or other of these two things\r\nhappening to Adam and to us.\r\n\r\nThat it does not prevent our dying is evident, because we all die;\r\nand if their accounts of longevity be true, men die faster since the\r\ncrucifixion than before: and with respect to the second explanation,\r\n(including with it the natural death of Jesus Christ as a substitute\r\nfor the eternal death or damnation of all mankind,) it is impertinently\r\nrepresenting the Creator as coming off, or revoking the sentence, by a\r\npun or a quibble upon the word death. That manufacturer of, quibbles,\r\nSt. Paul, if he wrote the books that bear his name, has helped this\r\nquibble on by making another quibble upon the word Adam. He makes there\r\nto be two Adams; the one who sins in fact, and suffers by proxy;\r\nthe other who sins by proxy, and suffers in fact. A religion thus\r\ninterlarded with quibble, subterfuge, and pun, has a tendency to\r\ninstruct its professors in the practice of these arts. They acquire the\r\nhabit without being aware of the cause.\r\n\r\nIf Jesus Christ was the being which those mythologists tell us he\r\nwas, and that he came into this world to suffer, which is a word they\r\nsometimes use instead of 'to die,' the only real suffering he could have\r\nendured would have been 'to live.' His existence here was a state\r\nof exilement or transportation from heaven, and the way back to his\r\noriginal country was to die.--In fine, everything in this strange system\r\nis the reverse of what it pretends to be. It is the reverse of truth,\r\nand I become so tired of examining into its inconsistencies and\r\nabsurdities, that I hasten to the conclusion of it, in order to proceed\r\nto something better.\r\n\r\nHow much, or what parts of the books called the New Testament, were\r\nwritten by the persons whose names they bear, is what we can know\r\nnothing of, neither are we certain in what language they were originally\r\nwritten. The matters they now contain may be classed under two heads:\r\nanecdote, and epistolary correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe four books already mentioned, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are\r\naltogether anecdotal. They relate events after they had taken place.\r\nThey tell what Jesus Christ did and said, and what others did and said\r\nto him; and in several instances they relate the same event differently.\r\nRevelation is necessarily out of the question with respect to those\r\nbooks; not only because of the disagreement of the writers, but because\r\nrevelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the persons\r\nwho saw them done, nor to the relating or recording of any discourse\r\nor conversation by those who heard it. The book called the Acts of the\r\nApostles (an anonymous work) belongs also to the anecdotal part.\r\n\r\nAll the other parts of the New Testament, except the book of enigmas,\r\ncalled the Revelations, are a collection of letters under the name of\r\nepistles; and the forgery of letters has been such a common practice\r\nin the world, that the probability is at least equal, whether they are\r\ngenuine or forged. One thing, however, is much less equivocal, which\r\nis, that out of the matters contained in those books, together with\r\nthe assistance of some old stories, the church has set up a system of\r\nreligion very contradictory to the character of the person whose name\r\nit bears. It has set up a religion of pomp and of revenue in pretended\r\nimitation of a person whose life was humility and poverty.\r\n\r\nThe invention of a purgatory, and of the releasing of souls therefrom,\r\nby prayers, bought of the church with money; the selling of pardons,\r\ndispensations, and indulgences, are revenue laws, without bearing that\r\nname or carrying that appearance. But the case nevertheless is, that\r\nthose things derive their origin from the proxysm of the crucifixion,\r\nand the theory deduced therefrom, which was, that one person could stand\r\nin the place of another, and could perform meritorious services for him.\r\nThe probability, therefore, is, that the whole theory or doctrine of\r\nwhat is called the redemption (which is said to have been accomplished\r\nby the act of one person in the room of another) was originally\r\nfabricated on purpose to bring forward and build all those secondary\r\nand pecuniary redemptions upon; and that the passages in the books upon\r\nwhich the idea of theory of redemption is built, have been manufactured\r\nand fabricated for that purpose. Why are we to give this church credit,\r\nwhen she tells us that those books are genuine in every part, any more\r\nthan we give her credit for everything else she has told us; or for the\r\nmiracles she says she has performed? That she could fabricate writings\r\nis certain, because she could write; and the composition of the writings\r\nin question, is of that kind that anybody might do it; and that she did\r\nfabricate them is not more inconsistent with probability, than that she\r\nshould tell us, as she has done, that she could and did work miracles.\r\n\r\nSince, then, no external evidence can, at this long distance of time,\r\nbe produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine called\r\nredemption or not, (for such evidence, whether for or against, would be\r\nsubject to the same suspicion of being fabricated,) the case can only be\r\nreferred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of itself; and\r\nthis affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication. For\r\nthe internal evidence is, that the theory or doctrine of redemption\r\nhas for its basis an idea of pecuniary justice, and not that of moral\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nIf I owe a person money, and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me\r\nin prison, another person can take the debt upon himself, and pay it for\r\nme. But if I have committed a crime, every circumstance of the case is\r\nchanged. Moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty even if\r\nthe innocent would offer itself. To suppose justice to do this, is to\r\ndestroy the principle of its existence, which is the thing itself. It is\r\nthen no longer justice. It is indiscriminate revenge.\r\n\r\nThis single reflection will show that the doctrine of redemption is\r\nfounded on a mere pecuniary idea corresponding to that of a debt which\r\nanother person might pay; and as this pecuniary idea corresponds again\r\nwith the system of second redemptions, obtained through the means of\r\nmoney given to the church for pardons, the probability is that the same\r\npersons fabricated both the one and the other of those theories;\r\nand that, in truth, there is no such thing as redemption; that it is\r\nfabulous; and that man stands in the same relative condition with his\r\nMaker he ever did stand, since man existed; and that it is his greatest\r\nconsolation to think so.\r\n\r\nLet him believe this, and he will live more consistently and morally,\r\nthan by any other system. It is by his being taught to contemplate\r\nhimself as an out-law, as an out-cast, as a beggar, as a mumper, as\r\none thrown as it were on a dunghill, at an immense distance from his\r\nCreator, and who must make his approaches by creeping, and cringing to\r\nintermediate beings, that he conceives either a contemptuous disregard\r\nfor everything under the name of religion, or becomes indifferent, or\r\nturns what he calls devout. In the latter case, he consumes his life\r\nin grief, or the affectation of it. His prayers are reproaches. His\r\nhumility is ingratitude. He calls himself a worm, and the fertile earth\r\na dunghill; and all the blessings of life by the thankless name of\r\nvanities. He despises the choicest gift of God to man, the GIFT OF\r\nREASON; and having endeavoured to force upon himself the belief of a\r\nsystem against which reason revolts, he ungratefully calls it human\r\nreason, as if man could give reason to himself.\r\n\r\nYet, with all this strange appearance of humility, and this contempt for\r\nhuman reason, he ventures into the boldest presumptions. He finds fault\r\nwith everything. His selfishness is never satisfied; his ingratitude is\r\nnever at an end. He takes on himself to direct the Almighty what to do,\r\neven in the govemment of the universe. He prays dictatorially. When\r\nit is sunshine, he prays for rain, and when it is rain, he prays for\r\nsunshine. He follows the same idea in everything that he prays for;\r\nfor what is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the\r\nAlmighty change his mind, and act otherwise than he does? It is as if he\r\nwere to say--thou knowest not so well as I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX - IN WHAT THE TRUE REVELATION CONSISTS.\r\n\r\nBUT some perhaps will say--Are we to have no word of God--no revelation?\r\nI answer yes. There is a Word of God; there is a revelation.\r\n\r\nTHE WORD OF GOD IS THE CREATION WE BEHOLD: And it is in this word,\r\nwhich no human invention can counterfeit or alter, that God speaketh\r\nuniversally to man.\r\n\r\nHuman language is local and changeable, and is therefore incapable of\r\nbeing used as the means of unchangeable and universal information.\r\nThe idea that God sent Jesus Christ to publish, as they say, the glad\r\ntidings to all nations, from one end of the earth unto the other, is\r\nconsistent only with the ignorance of those who know nothing of the\r\nextent of the world, and who believed, as those world-saviours\r\nbelieved, and continued to believe for several centuries, (and that in\r\ncontradiction to the discoveries of philosophers and the experience of\r\nnavigators,) that the earth was flat like a trencher; and that a man\r\nmight walk to the end of it.\r\n\r\nBut how was Jesus Christ to make anything known to all nations? He could\r\nspeak but one language, which was Hebrew; and there are in the world\r\nseveral hundred languages. Scarcely any two nations speak the same\r\nlanguage, or understand each other; and as to translations, every\r\nman who knows anything of languages, knows that it is impossible to\r\ntranslate from one language into another, not only without losing a\r\ngreat part of the original, but frequently of mistaking the sense; and\r\nbesides all this, the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time\r\nChrist lived.\r\n\r\nIt is always necessary that the means that are to accomplish any end\r\nbe equal to the accomplishment of that end, or the end cannot be\r\naccomplished. It is in this that the difference between finite and\r\ninfinite power and wisdom discovers itself. Man frequently fails in\r\naccomplishing his end, from a natural inability of the power to the\r\npurpose; and frequently from the want of wisdom to apply power properly.\r\nBut it is impossible for infinite power and wisdom to fail as man\r\nfaileth. The means it useth are always equal to the end: but human\r\nlanguage, more especially as there is not an universal language, is\r\nincapable of being used as an universal means of unchangeable and\r\nuniform information; and therefore it is not the means that God useth in\r\nmanifesting himself universally to man.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the CREATION that all our ideas and conceptions of a\r\nword of God can unite. The Creation speaketh an universal language,\r\nindependently of human speech or human language, multiplied and various\r\nas they be. It is an ever existing original, which every man can read.\r\nIt cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be lost; it\r\ncannot be altered; it cannot be suppressed. It does not depend upon the\r\nwill of man whether it shall be published or not; it publishes itself\r\nfrom one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and\r\nto all worlds; and this word of God reveals to man all that is necessary\r\nfor man to know of God.\r\n\r\nDo we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of\r\nthe creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom? We see it in the\r\nunchangeable order by which the incomprehensible Whole is governed. Do\r\nwe want to contemplate his munificence? We see it in the abundance with\r\nwhich he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it\r\nin his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful. In\r\nfine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the\r\nscripture, which any human hand might make, but the scripture called the\r\nCreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X - CONCERNING GOD, AND THE LIGHTS CAST ON HIS EXISTENCE\r\n\r\nAND ATTRIBUTES BY THE BIBLE.\r\n\r\nTHE only idea man can affix to the name of God, is that of a first\r\ncause, the cause of all things. And, incomprehensibly difficult as it is\r\nfor a man to conceive what a first cause is, he arrives at the belief\r\nof it, from the tenfold greater difficulty of disbelieving it. It is\r\ndifficult beyond description to conceive that space can have no end;\r\nbut it is more difficult to conceive an end. It is difficult beyond the\r\npower of man to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time; but\r\nit is more impossible to conceive a time when there shall be no time.\r\n\r\nIn like manner of reasoning, everything we behold carries in itself the\r\ninternal evidence that it did not make itself. Every man is an evidence\r\nto himself, that he did not make himself; neither could his father make\r\nhimself, nor his grandfather, nor any of his race; neither could any\r\ntree, plant, or animal make itself; and it is the conviction arising\r\nfrom this evidence, that carries us on, as it were, by necessity, to\r\nthe belief of a first cause eternally existing, of a nature totally\r\ndifferent to any material existence we know of, and by the power of\r\nwhich all things exist; and this first cause, man calls God.\r\n\r\nIt is only by the exercise of reason, that man can discover God. Take\r\naway that reason, and he would be incapable of understanding anything;\r\nand in this case it would be just as consistent to read even the book\r\ncalled the Bible to a horse as to a man. How then is it that those\r\npeople pretend to reject reason?\r\n\r\nAlmost the only parts in the book called the Bible, that convey to\r\nus any idea of God, are some chapters in Job, and the 19th Psalm; I\r\nrecollect no other. Those parts are true deistical compositions;\r\nfor they treat of the Deity through his works. They take the book of\r\nCreation as the word of God; they refer to no other book; and all the\r\ninferences they make are drawn from that volume.\r\n\r\nI insert in this place the 19th Psalm, as paraphrased into English verse\r\nby Addison. I recollect not the prose, and where I write this I have not\r\nthe opportunity of seeing it:\r\n\r\n  The spacious firmament on high,\r\n  With all the blue etherial sky,\r\n  And spangled heavens, a shining frame,\r\n  Their great original proclaim.\r\n  The unwearied sun, from day to day,\r\n  Does his Creator's power display,\r\n  And publishes to every land\r\n  The work of an Almighty hand.\r\n  Soon as the evening shades prevail,\r\n  The moon takes up the wondrous tale,\r\n  And nightly to the list'ning earth\r\n  Repeats the story of her birth;\r\n  Whilst all the stars that round her burn,\r\n  And all the planets, in their turn,\r\n  Confirm the tidings as they roll,\r\n  And spread the truth from pole to pole.\r\n  What though in solemn silence all\r\n  Move round this dark terrestrial ball\r\n  What though no real voice, nor sound,\r\n  Amidst their radiant orbs be found,\r\n  In reason's ear they all rejoice,\r\n  And utter forth a glorious voice,\r\n  Forever singing as they shine,\r\n  THE HAND THAT MADE US IS DIVINE.\r\n\r\nWhat more does man want to know, than that the hand or power that made\r\nthese things is divine, is omnipotent? Let him believe this, with the\r\nforce it is impossible to repel if he permits his reason to act, and his\r\nrule of moral life will follow of course.\r\n\r\nThe allusions in job have all of them the same tendency with this Psalm;\r\nthat of deducing or proving a truth that would be otherwise unknown,\r\nfrom truths already known.\r\n\r\nI recollect not enough of the passages in Job to insert them correctly;\r\nbut there is one that occurs to me that is applicable to the subject I\r\nam speaking upon. \"Canst thou by searching find out God; canst thou find\r\nout the Almighty to perfection?\"\r\n\r\nI know not how the printers have pointed this passage, for I keep no\r\nBible; but it contains two distinct questions that admit of distinct\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nFirst, Canst thou by searching find out God? Yes. Because, in the first\r\nplace, I know I did not make myself, and yet I have existence; and by\r\nsearching into the nature of other things, I find that no other thing\r\ncould make itself; and yet millions of other things exist; therefore it\r\nis, that I know, by positive conclusion resulting from this search, that\r\nthere is a power superior to all those things, and that power is God.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection? No. Not only\r\nbecause the power and wisdom He has manifested in the structure of the\r\nCreation that I behold is to me incomprehensible; but because even this\r\nmanifestation, great as it is is probably but a small display of that\r\nimmensity of power and wisdom, by which millions of other worlds, to me\r\ninvisible by their distance, were created and continue to exist.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that both of these questions were put to the reason of the\r\nperson to whom they are supposed to have been addressed; and it is only\r\nby admitting the first question to be answered affirmatively, that the\r\nsecond could follow. It would have been unnecessary, and even absurd, to\r\nhave put a second question, more difficult than the first, if the first\r\nquestion had been answered negatively. The two questions have different\r\nobjects; the first refers to the existence of God, the second to his\r\nattributes. Reason can discover the one, but it falls infinitely short\r\nin discovering the whole of the other.\r\n\r\nI recollect not a single passage in all the writings ascribed to the men\r\ncalled apostles, that conveys any idea of what God is. Those writings\r\nare chiefly controversial; and the gloominess of the subject they dwell\r\nupon, that of a man dying in agony on a cross, is better suited to the\r\ngloomy genius of a monk in a cell, by whom it is not impossible they\r\nwere written, than to any man breathing the open air of the Creation.\r\nThe only passage that occurs to me, that has any reference to the works\r\nof God, by which only his power and wisdom can be known, is related to\r\nhave been spoken by Jesus Christ, as a remedy against distrustful care.\r\n\"Behold the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither do they spin.\"\r\nThis, however, is far inferior to the allusions in Job and in the 19th\r\nPsalm; but it is similar in idea, and the modesty of the imagery is\r\ncorrespondent to the modesty of the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI - OF THE THEOLOGY OF THE CHRISTIANS; AND THE TRUE THEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nAs to the Christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of\r\natheism; a sort of religious denial of God. It professes to believe in a\r\nman rather than in God. It is a compound made up chiefly of man-ism with\r\nbut little deism, and is as near to atheism as twilight is to darkness.\r\nIt introduces between man and his Maker an opaque body, which it calls\r\na redeemer, as the moon introduces her opaque self between the earth\r\nand the sun, and it produces by this means a religious or an irreligious\r\neclipse of light. It has put the whole orbit of reason into shade.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this obscurity has been that of turning everything upside\r\ndown, and representing it in reverse; and among the revolutions it has\r\nthus magically produced, it has made a revolution in Theology.\r\n\r\nThat which is now called natural philosophy, embracing the whole circle\r\nof science, of which astronomy occupies the chief place, is the study of\r\nthe works of God, and of the power and wisdom of God in his works, and\r\nis the true theology.\r\n\r\nAs to the theology that is now studied in its place, it is the study of\r\nhuman opinions and of human fancies concerning God. It is not the\r\nstudy of God himself in the works that he has made, but in the works\r\nor writings that man has made; and it is not among the least of the\r\nmischiefs that the Christian system has done to the world, that it\r\nhas abandoned the original and beautiful system of theology, like a\r\nbeautiful innocent, to distress and reproach, to make room for the hag\r\nof superstition.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Job and the 19th Psalm, which even the church admits to be\r\nmore ancient than the chronological order in which they stand in the\r\nbook called the Bible, are theological orations conformable to the\r\noriginal system of theology. The internal evidence of those orations\r\nproves to a demonstration that the study and contemplation of the works\r\nof creation, and of the power and wisdom of God revealed and manifested\r\nin those works, made a great part of the religious devotion of the\r\ntimes in which they were written; and it was this devotional study and\r\ncontemplation that led to the discovery of the principles upon which\r\nwhat are now called Sciences are established; and it is to the discovery\r\nof these principles that almost all the Arts that contribute to the\r\nconvenience of human life owe their existence. Every principal art has\r\nsome science for its parent, though the person who mechanically performs\r\nthe work does not always, and but very seldom, perceive the connection.\r\n\r\nIt is a fraud of the Christian system to call the sciences 'human\r\ninventions;' it is only the application of them that is human.\r\nEvery science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and\r\nunalterable as those by which the universe is regulated and governed.\r\nMan cannot make principles, he can only discover them.\r\n\r\nFor example: Every person who looks at an almanack sees an account when\r\nan eclipse will take place, and he sees also that it never fails to\r\ntake place according to the account there given. This shows that man is\r\nacquainted with the laws by which the heavenly bodies move. But it would\r\nbe something worse than ignorance, were any church on earth to say that\r\nthose laws are an human invention.\r\n\r\nIt would also be ignorance, or something worse, to say that the\r\nscientific principles, by the aid of which man is enabled to calculate\r\nand foreknow when an eclipse will take place, are an human invention.\r\nMan cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable; and the\r\nscientific principles he employs for this purpose must, and are, of\r\nnecessity, as eternal and immutable as the laws by which the heavenly\r\nbodies move, or they could not be used as they are to ascertain the time\r\nwhen, and the manner how, an eclipse will take place.\r\n\r\nThe scientific principles that man employs to obtain the foreknowledge\r\nof an eclipse, or of any thing else relating to the motion of the\r\nheavenly bodies, are contained chiefly in that part of science that\r\nis called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when\r\napplied to the study of the heavenly bodies, is called astronomy;\r\nwhen applied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean, it is called\r\nnavigation; when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a rule\r\nand compass, it is called geometry; when applied to the construction\r\nof plans of edifices, it is called architecture; when applied to the\r\nmeasurement of any portion of the surface of the earth, it is called\r\nland-surveying. In fine, it is the soul of science. It is an eternal\r\ntruth: it contains the mathematical demonstration of which man speaks,\r\nand the extent of its uses are unknown.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, that man can make or draw a triangle, and therefore a\r\ntriangle is an human invention.\r\n\r\nBut the triangle, when drawn, is no other than the image of the\r\nprinciple: it is a delineation to the eye, and from thence to the mind,\r\nof a principle that would otherwise be imperceptible. The triangle does\r\nnot make the principle, any more than a candle taken into a room that\r\nwas dark, makes the chairs and tables that before were invisible. All\r\nthe properties of a triangle exist independently of the figure, and\r\nexisted before any triangle was drawn or thought of by man. Man had no\r\nmore to do in the formation of those properties or principles, than\r\nhe had to do in making the laws by which the heavenly bodies move; and\r\ntherefore the one must have the same divine origin as the other.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as, it may be said, that man can make a triangle,\r\nso also, may it be said, he can make the mechanical instrument called\r\na lever. But the principle by which the lever acts, is a thing distinct\r\nfrom the instrument, and would exist if the instrument did not; it\r\nattaches itself to the instrument after it is made; the instrument,\r\ntherefore, can act no otherwise than it does act; neither can all the\r\nefforts of human invention make it act otherwise. That which, in all\r\nsuch cases, man calls the effect, is no other than the principle itself\r\nrendered perceptible to the senses.\r\n\r\nSince, then, man cannot make principles, from whence did he gain a\r\nknowledge of them, so as to be able to apply them, not only to things on\r\nearth, but to ascertain the motion of bodies so immensely distant from\r\nhim as all the heavenly bodies are? From whence, I ask, could he gain\r\nthat knowledge, but from the study of the true theology?\r\n\r\nIt is the structure of the universe that has taught this knowledge to\r\nman. That structure is an ever-existing exhibition of every principle\r\nupon which every part of mathematical science is founded. The offspring\r\nof this science is mechanics; for mechanics is no other than the\r\nprinciples of science applied practically. The man who proportions the\r\nseveral parts of a mill uses the same scientific principles as if he had\r\nthe power of constructing an universe, but as he cannot give to matter\r\nthat invisible agency by which all the component parts of the immense\r\nmachine of the universe have influence upon each other, and act in\r\nmotional unison together, without any apparent contact, and to which\r\nman has given the name of attraction, gravitation, and repulsion, he\r\nsupplies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth and\r\ncogs. All the parts of man's microcosm must visibly touch. But could\r\nhe gain a knowledge of that agency, so as to be able to apply it in\r\npractice, we might then say that another canonical book of the word of\r\nGod had been discovered.\r\n\r\nIf man could alter the properties of the lever, so also could he alter\r\nthe properties of the triangle: for a lever (taking that sort of lever\r\nwhich is called a steel-yard, for the sake of explanation) forms, when\r\nin motion, a triangle. The line it descends from, (one point of that\r\nline being in the fulcrum,) the line it descends to, and the chord of\r\nthe arc, which the end of the lever describes in the air, are the\r\nthree sides of a triangle. The other arm of the lever describes also a\r\ntriangle; and the corresponding sides of those two triangles, calculated\r\nscientifically, or measured geometrically,--and also the sines,\r\ntangents, and secants generated from the angles, and geometrically\r\nmeasured,--have the same proportions to each other as the different\r\nweights have that will balance each other on the lever, leaving the\r\nweight of the lever out of the case.\r\n\r\nIt may also be said, that man can make a wheel and axis; that he can put\r\nwheels of different magnitudes together, and produce a mill. Still the\r\ncase comes back to the same point, which is, that he did not make the\r\nprinciple that gives the wheels those powers. This principle is as\r\nunalterable as in the former cases, or rather it is the same principle\r\nunder a different appearance to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe power that two wheels of different magnitudes have upon each other\r\nis in the same proportion as if the semi-diameter of the two wheels\r\nwere joined together and made into that kind of lever I have described,\r\nsuspended at the part where the semi-diameters join; for the two wheels,\r\nscientifically considered, are no other than the two circles generated\r\nby the motion of the compound lever.\r\n\r\nIt is from the study of the true theology that all our knowledge of\r\nscience is derived; and it is from that knowledge that all the arts have\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nThe Almighty lecturer, by displaying the principles of science in the\r\nstructure of the universe, has invited man to study and to imitation. It\r\nis as if he had said to the inhabitants of this globe that we call ours,\r\n\"I have made an earth for man to dwell upon, and I have rendered the\r\nstarry heavens visible, to teach him science and the arts. He can now\r\nprovide for his own comfort, AND LEARN FROM MY MUNIFICENCE TO ALL, TO BE\r\nKIND TO EACH OTHER.\"\r\n\r\nOf what use is it, unless it be to teach man something, that his eye is\r\nendowed with the power of beholding, to an incomprehensible distance, an\r\nimmensity of worlds revolving in the ocean of space? Or of what use is\r\nit that this immensity of worlds is visible to man? What has man to do\r\nwith the Pleiades, with Orion, with Sirius, with the star he calls the\r\nnorth star, with the moving orbs he has named Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,\r\nVenus, and Mercury, if no uses are to follow from their being visible?\r\nA less power of vision would have been sufficient for man, if the\r\nimmensity he now possesses were given only to waste itself, as it were,\r\non an immense desert of space glittering with shows.\r\n\r\nIt is only by contemplating what he calls the starry heavens, as the\r\nbook and school of science, that he discovers any use in their being\r\nvisible to him, or any advantage resulting from his immensity of\r\nvision. But when he contemplates the subject in this light, he sees an\r\nadditional motive for saying, that nothing was made in vain; for in vain\r\nwould be this power of vision if it taught man nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII - THE EFFECTS OF CHRISTIANISM ON EDUCATION; PROPOSED\r\nREFORMS.\r\n\r\nAs the Christian system of faith has made a revolution in theology, so\r\nalso has it made a revolution in the state of learning. That which is\r\nnow called learning, was not learning originally. Learning does not\r\nconsist, as the schools now make it consist, in the knowledge of\r\nlanguages, but in the knowledge of things to which language gives names.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were a learned people, but learning with them did not consist\r\nin speaking Greek, any more than in a Roman's speaking Latin, or a\r\nFrenchman's speaking French, or an Englishman's speaking English. From\r\nwhat we know of the Greeks, it does not appear that they knew or studied\r\nany language but their own, and this was one cause of their becoming\r\nso learned; it afforded them more time to apply themselves to better\r\nstudies. The schools of the Greeks were schools of science and\r\nphilosophy, and not of languages; and it is in the knowledge of the\r\nthings that science and philosophy teach that learning consists.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the scientific learning that now exists, came to us from the\r\nGreeks, or the people who spoke the Greek language. It therefore\r\nbecame necessary to the people of other nations, who spoke a different\r\nlanguage, that some among them should learn the Greek language, in order\r\nthat the learning the Greeks had might be made known in those nations,\r\nby translating the Greek books of science and philosophy into the mother\r\ntongue of each nation.\r\n\r\nThe study, therefore, of the Greek language (and in the same manner for\r\nthe Latin) was no other than the drudgery business of a linguist; and\r\nthe language thus obtained, was no other than the means, or as it were\r\nthe tools, employed to obtain the learning the Greeks had. It made no\r\npart of the learning itself; and was so distinct from it as to make it\r\nexceedingly probable that the persons who had studied Greek sufficiently\r\nto translate those works, such for instance as Euclid's Elements, did\r\nnot understand any of the learning the works contained.\r\n\r\nAs there is now nothing new to be learned from the dead languages, all\r\nthe useful books being already translated, the languages are become\r\nuseless, and the time expended in teaching and in learning them is\r\nwasted. So far as the study of languages may contribute to the progress\r\nand communication of knowledge (for it has nothing to do with the\r\ncreation of knowledge) it is only in the living languages that new\r\nknowledge is to be found; and certain it is, that, in general, a\r\nyouth will learn more of a living language in one year, than of a dead\r\nlanguage in seven; and it is but seldom that the teacher knows much of\r\nit himself. The difficulty of learning the dead languages does not arise\r\nfrom any superior abstruseness in the languages themselves, but in their\r\nbeing dead, and the pronunciation entirely lost. It would be the same\r\nthing with any other language when it becomes dead. The best Greek\r\nlinguist that now exists does not understand Greek so well as a Grecian\r\nplowman did, or a Grecian milkmaid; and the same for the Latin,\r\ncompared with a plowman or a milkmaid of the Romans; and with respect\r\nto pronunciation and idiom, not so well as the cows that she milked. It\r\nwould therefore be advantageous to the state of learning to abolish\r\nthe study of the dead languages, and to make learning consist, as it\r\noriginally did, in scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe apology that is sometimes made for continuing to teach the dead\r\nlanguages is, that they are taught at a time when a child is not capable\r\nof exerting any other mental faculty than that of memory. But this\r\nis altogether erroneous. The human mind has a natural disposition to\r\nscientific knowledge, and to the things connected with it. The first and\r\nfavourite amusement of a child, even before it begins to play, is that\r\nof imitating the works of man. It builds bouses with cards or sticks; it\r\nnavigates the little ocean of a bowl of water with a paper boat; or dams\r\nthe stream of a gutter, and contrives something which it calls a mill;\r\nand it interests itself in the fate of its works with a care that\r\nresembles affection. It afterwards goes to school, where its genius is\r\nkilled by the barren study of a dead language, and the philosopher is\r\nlost in the linguist.\r\n\r\nBut the apology that is now made for continuing to teach the dead\r\nlanguages, could not be the cause at first of cutting down learning to\r\nthe narrow and humble sphere of linguistry; the cause therefore must be\r\nsought for elsewhere. In all researches of this kind, the best evidence\r\nthat can be produced, is the internal evidence the thing carries with\r\nitself, and the evidence of circumstances that unites with it; both of\r\nwhich, in this case, are not difficult to be discovered.\r\n\r\nPutting then aside, as matter of distinct consideration, the outrage\r\noffered to the moral justice of God, by supposing him to make the\r\ninnocent suffer for the guilty, and also the loose morality and low\r\ncontrivance of supposing him to change himself into the shape of a man,\r\nin order to make an excuse to himself for not executing his supposed\r\nsentence upon Adam; putting, I say, those things aside as matter of\r\ndistinct consideration, it is certain that what is called the\r\nchristian system of faith, including in it the whimsical account of\r\nthe creation--the strange story of Eve, the snake, and the apple--the\r\namphibious idea of a man-god--the corporeal idea of the death of a\r\ngod--the mythological idea of a family of gods, and the christian\r\nsystem of arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three, are all\r\nirreconcilable, not only to the divine gift of reason, that God has\r\ngiven to man, but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and\r\nwisdom of God by the aid of the sciences, and by studying the structure\r\nof the universe that God has made.\r\n\r\nThe setters up, therefore, and the advocates of the Christian system of\r\nfaith, could not but foresee that the continually progressive knowledge\r\nthat man would gain by the aid of science, of the power and wisdom of\r\nGod, manifested in the structure of the universe, and in all the works\r\nof creation, would militate against, and call into question, the truth\r\nof their system of faith; and therefore it became necessary to their\r\npurpose to cut learning down to a size less dangerous to their project,\r\nand this they effected by restricting the idea of learning to the dead\r\nstudy of dead languages.\r\n\r\nThey not only rejected the study of science out of the christian\r\nschools, but they persecuted it; and it is only within about the last\r\ntwo centuries that the study has been revived. So late as 1610, Galileo,\r\na Florentine, discovered and introduced the use of telescopes, and by\r\napplying them to observe the motions and appearances of the heavenly\r\nbodies, afforded additional means for ascertaining the true structure\r\nof the universe. Instead of being esteemed for these discoveries, he was\r\nsentenced to renounce them, or the opinions resulting from them, as a\r\ndamnable heresy. And prior to that time Virgilius was condemned to be\r\nburned for asserting the antipodes, or in other words, that the earth\r\nwas a globe, and habitable in every part where there was land; yet the\r\ntruth of this is now too well known even to be told. [NOTE: I cannot\r\ndiscover the source of this statement concerning the ancient author\r\nwhose Irish name Feirghill was Latinized into Virgilius. The British\r\nMuseum possesses a copy of the work (Decalogiunt) which was the pretext\r\nof the charge of heresy made by Boniface, Archbishop of Mayence, against\r\nVirgilius, Abbot--bishop of Salzburg, These were leaders of the\r\nrival \"British\" and \"Roman parties, and the British champion made a\r\ncountercharge against Boniface of irreligious practices.\" Boniface had\r\nto express a \"regret,\" but none the less pursued his rival. The Pope,\r\nZachary II., decided that if his alleged \"doctrine, against God and his\r\nsoul, that beneath the earth there is another world, other men, or\r\nsun and moon,\" should be acknowledged by Virgilius, he should be\r\nexcommunicated by a Council and condemned with canonical sanctions.\r\nWhatever may have been the fate involved by condemnation with \"canonicis\r\nsanctionibus,\" in the middle of the eighth century, it did not fall on\r\nVirgilius. His accuser, Boniface, was martyred, 755, and it is probable\r\nthat Virgilius harmonied his Antipodes with orthodoxy. The gravamen of\r\nthe heresy seems to have been the suggestion that there were men not of\r\nthe progeny of Adam. Virgilius was made Bishop of Salzburg in 768. He\r\nbore until his death, 789, the curious title, \"Geometer and Solitary,\"\r\nor \"lone wayfarer\" (Solivagus). A suspicion of heresy clung to his\r\nmemory until 1233, when he was raised by Gregory IX, to sainthood beside\r\nhis accuser, St. Boniface.--Editor. (Conway)]\r\n\r\nIf the belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief, it would make\r\nno part of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them. There was no\r\nmoral ill in believing the earth was flat like a trencher, any more than\r\nthere was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe; neither\r\nwas there any moral ill in believing that the Creator made no other\r\nworld than this, any more than there was moral virtue in believing that\r\nhe made millions, and that the infinity of space is filled with worlds.\r\nBut when a system of religion is made to grow out of a supposed system\r\nof creation that is not true, and to unite itself therewith in a manner\r\nalmost inseparable therefrom, the case assumes an entirely different\r\nground. It is then that errors, not morally bad, become fraught with\r\nthe same mischiefs as if they were. It is then that the truth, though\r\notherwise indifferent itself, becomes an essential, by becoming the\r\ncriterion that either confirms by corresponding evidence, or denies by\r\ncontradictory evidence, the reality of the religion itself. In this\r\nview of the case it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possible\r\nevidence that the structure of the heavens, or any other part of\r\ncreation affords, with respect to systems of religion. But this, the\r\nsupporters or partizans of the christian system, as if dreading the\r\nresult, incessantly opposed, and not only rejected the sciences, but\r\npersecuted the professors. Had Newton or Descartes lived three or four\r\nhundred years ago, and pursued their studies as they did, it is most\r\nprobable they would not have lived to finish them; and had Franklin\r\ndrawn lightning from the clouds at the same time, it would have been at\r\nthe hazard of expiring for it in flames.\r\n\r\nLater times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but,\r\nhowever unwilling the partizans of the Christian system may be to\r\nbelieve or to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true, that the age of\r\nignorance commenced with the Christian system. There was more knowledge\r\nin the world before that period, than for many centuries afterwards; and\r\nas to religious knowledge, the Christian system, as already said,\r\nwas only another species of mythology; and the mythology to which it\r\nsucceeded, was a corruption of an ancient system of theism. [NOTE by\r\nPaine: It is impossible for us now to know at what time the heathen\r\nmythology began; but it is certain, from the internal evidence that it\r\ncarries, that it did not begin in the same state or condition in which\r\nit ended. All the gods of that mythology, except Saturn, were of modern\r\ninvention. The supposed reign of Saturn was prior to that which is\r\ncalled the heathen mythology, and was so far a species of theism that\r\nit admitted the belief of only one God. Saturn is supposed to have\r\nabdicated the govemment in favour of his three sons and one daughter,\r\nJupiter, Pluto, Neptune, and Juno; after this, thousands of other\r\ngods and demigods were imaginarily created, and the calendar of gods\r\nincreased as fast as the calendar of saints and the calendar of courts\r\nhave increased since.\r\n\r\nAll the corruptions that have taken place, in theology and in religion\r\nhave been produced by admitting of what man calls 'revealed religion.'\r\nThe mythologists pretended to more revealed religion than the christians\r\ndo. They had their oracles and their priests, who were supposed to\r\nreceive and deliver the word of God verbally on almost all occasions.\r\n\r\nSince then all corruptions down from Moloch to modern predestinarianism,\r\nand the human sacrifices of the heathens to the christian sacrifice of\r\nthe Creator, have been produced by admitting of what is called revealed\r\nreligion, the most effectual means to prevent all such evils and\r\nimpositions is, not to admit of any other revelation than that which is\r\nmanifested in the book of Creation., and to contemplate the Creation as\r\nthe only true and real word of God that ever did or ever will exist;\r\nand every thing else called the word of God is fable and\r\nimposition.--Author.]\r\n\r\nIt is owing to this long interregnum of science, and to no other cause,\r\nthat we have now to look back through a vast chasm of many hundred years\r\nto the respectable characters we call the Ancients. Had the progression\r\nof knowledge gone on proportionably with the stock that before existed,\r\nthat chasm would have been filled up with characters rising superior in\r\nknowledge to each other; and those Ancients we now so much admire\r\nwould have appeared respectably in the background of the scene. But\r\nthe christian system laid all waste; and if we take our stand about\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century, we look back through that long\r\nchasm, to the times of the Ancients, as over a vast sandy desert, in\r\nwhich not a shrub appears to intercept the vision to the fertile hills\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nIt is an inconsistency scarcely possible to be credited, that any\r\nthing should exist, under the name of a religion, that held it to be\r\nirreligious to study and contemplate the structure of the universe that\r\nGod had made. But the fact is too well established to be denied. The\r\nevent that served more than any other to break the first link in this\r\nlong chain of despotic ignorance, is that known by the name of the\r\nReformation by Luther. From that time, though it does not appear to have\r\nmade any part of the intention of Luther, or of those who are called\r\nReformers, the Sciences began to revive, and Liberality, their\r\nnatural associate, began to appear. This was the only public good the\r\nReformation did; for, with respect to religious good, it might as well\r\nnot have taken place. The mythology still continued the same; and a\r\nmultiplicity of National Popes grew out of the downfall of the Pope of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII - COMPARISON OF CHRISTIANISM WITH THE RELIGIOUS IDEAS\r\nINSPIRED BY NATURE.\r\n\r\nHAVING thus shewn, from the internal evidence of things, the cause\r\nthat produced a change in the state of learning, and the motive for\r\nsubstituting the study of the dead languages, in the place of the\r\nSciences, I proceed, in addition to the several observations already\r\nmade in the former part of this work, to compare, or rather to confront,\r\nthe evidence that the structure of the universe affords, with the\r\nchristian system of religion. But as I cannot begin this part better\r\nthan by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at an early part of\r\nlife, and which I doubt not have occurred in some degree to almost every\r\nother person at one time or other, I shall state what those ideas were,\r\nand add thereto such other matter as shall arise out of the subject,\r\ngiving to the whole, by way of preface, a short introduction.\r\n\r\nMy father being of the quaker profession, it was my good fortune to have\r\nan exceedingly good moral education, and a tolerable stock of useful\r\nlearning. Though I went to the grammar school, I did not learn Latin,\r\nnot only because I had no inclination to learn languages, but because of\r\nthe objection the quakers have against the books in which the language\r\nis taught. But this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the\r\nsubjects of all the Latin books used in the school.\r\n\r\nThe natural bent of my mind was to science. I had some turn, and\r\nI believe some talent for poetry; but this I rather repressed than\r\nencouraged, as leading too much into the field of imagination. As\r\nsoon as I was able, I purchased a pair of globes, and attended the\r\nphilosophical lectures of Martin and Ferguson, and became afterwards\r\nacquainted with Dr. Bevis, of the society called the Royal Society, then\r\nliving in the Temple, and an excellent astronomer.\r\n\r\nI had no disposition for what was called politics. It presented to\r\nmy mind no other idea than is contained in the word jockeyship. When,\r\ntherefore, I turned my thoughts towards matters of government, I had to\r\nform a system for myself, that accorded with the moral and philosophic\r\nprinciples in which I had been educated. I saw, or at least I thought I\r\nsaw, a vast scene opening itself to the world in the affairs of America;\r\nand it appeared to me, that unless the Americans changed the plan they\r\nwere then pursuing, with respect to the government of England, and\r\ndeclared themselves independent, they would not only involve themselves\r\nin a multiplicity of new difficulties, but shut out the prospect that\r\nwas then offering itself to mankind through their means. It was from\r\nthese motives that I published the work known by the name of Common\r\nSense, which is the first work I ever did publish, and so far as I can\r\njudge of myself, I believe I should never have been known in the world\r\nas an author on any subject whatever, had it not been for the affairs\r\nof America. I wrote Common Sense the latter end of the year 1775, and\r\npublished it the first of January, 1776. Independence was declared the\r\nfourth of July following. [NOTE: The pamphlet Common Sense was first\r\nadvertised, as \"just published,\" on January 10, 1776. His plea for the\r\nOfficers of Excise, written before leaving England, was printed, but not\r\npublished until 1793. Despite his reiterated assertion that Common Sense\r\nwas the first work he ever published the notion that he was \"junius\"\r\nstill finds some believers. An indirect comment on our Paine-Junians\r\nmay be found in Part 2 of this work where Paine says a man capable of\r\nwriting Homer \"would not have thrown away his own fame by giving it to\r\nanother.\" It is probable that Paine ascribed the Letters of Junius to\r\nThomas Hollis. His friend F. Lanthenas, in his translation of the Age of\r\nReason (1794) advertises his translation of the Letters of Junius from\r\nthe English \"(Thomas Hollis).\" This he could hardly have done without\r\nconsultation with Paine. Unfortunately this translation of Junius cannot\r\nbe found either in the Bibliotheque Nationale or the British Museum, and\r\nit cannot be said whether it contains any attempt at an identification\r\nof Junius--Editor.]\r\n\r\nAny person, who has made observations on the state and progress of the\r\nhuman mind, by observing his own, can not but have observed, that there\r\nare two distinct classes of what are called Thoughts; those that we\r\nproduce in ourselves by reflection and the act of thinking, and those\r\nthat bolt into the mind of their own accord. I have always made it a\r\nrule to treat those voluntary visitors with civility, taking care to\r\nexamine, as well as I was able, if they were worth entertaining; and it\r\nis from them I have acquired almost all the knowledge that I have. As\r\nto the learning that any person gains from school education, it serves\r\nonly, like a small capital, to put him in the way of beginning learning\r\nfor himself afterwards. Every person of learning is finally his own\r\nteacher; the reason of which is, that principles, being of a distinct\r\nquality to circumstances, cannot be impressed upon the memory; their\r\nplace of mental residence is the understanding, and they are never so\r\nlasting as when they begin by conception. Thus much for the introductory\r\npart.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I was capable of conceiving an idea, and acting upon it\r\nby reflection, I either doubted the truth of the christian system, or\r\nthought it to be a strange affair; I scarcely knew which it was: but I\r\nwell remember, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing a sermon\r\nread by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee of the church, upon\r\nthe subject of what is called Redemption by the death of the Son of God.\r\nAfter the sermon was ended, I went into the garden, and as I was going\r\ndown the garden steps (for I perfectly recollect the spot) I revolted at\r\nthe recollection of what I had heard, and thought to myself that it was\r\nmaking God Almighty act like a passionate man, that killed his son,\r\nwhen he could not revenge himself any other way; and as I was sure a man\r\nwould be hanged that did such a thing, I could not see for what purpose\r\nthey preached such sermons. This was not one of those kind of thoughts\r\nthat had any thing in it of childish levity; it was to me a serious\r\nreflection, arising from the idea I had that God was too good to do such\r\nan action, and also too almighty to be under any necessity of doing it.\r\nI believe in the same manner to this moment; and I moreover believe,\r\nthat any system of religion that has anything in it that shocks the mind\r\nof a child, cannot be a true system.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if parents of the christian profession were ashamed to tell\r\ntheir children any thing about the principles of their religion. They\r\nsometimes instruct them in morals, and talk to them of the goodness of\r\nwhat they call Providence; for the Christian mythology has five deities:\r\nthere is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, the God\r\nProvidence, and the Goddess Nature. But the christian story of God the\r\nFather putting his son to death, or employing people to do it, (for that\r\nis the plain language of the story,) cannot be told by a parent to a\r\nchild; and to tell him that it was done to make mankind happier and\r\nbetter, is making the story still worse; as if mankind could be improved\r\nby the example of murder; and to tell him that all this is a mystery, is\r\nonly making an excuse for the incredibility of it.\r\n\r\nHow different is this to the pure and simple profession of Deism! The\r\ntrue deist has but one Deity; and his religion consists in contemplating\r\nthe power, wisdom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in\r\nendeavouring to imitate him in every thing moral, scientifical, and\r\nmechanical.\r\n\r\nThe religion that approaches the nearest of all others to true Deism, in\r\nthe moral and benign part thereof, is that professed by the quakers: but\r\nthey have contracted themselves too much by leaving the works of God out\r\nof their system. Though I reverence their philanthropy, I can not help\r\nsmiling at the conceit, that if the taste of a quaker could have been\r\nconsulted at the creation, what a silent and drab-colored creation it\r\nwould have been! Not a flower would have blossomed its gaieties, nor a\r\nbird been permitted to sing.\r\n\r\nQuitting these reflections, I proceed to other matters. After I had\r\nmade myself master of the use of the globes, and of the orrery, [NOTE by\r\nPaine: As this book may fall into the bands of persons who do not know\r\nwhat an orrery is, it is for their information I add this note, as the\r\nname gives no idea of the uses of the thing. The orrery has its name\r\nfrom the person who invented it. It is a machinery of clock-work,\r\nrepresenting the universe in miniature: and in which the revolution of\r\nthe earth round itself and round the sun, the revolution of the moon\r\nround the earth, the revolution of the planets round the sun, their\r\nrelative distances from the sun, as the center of the whole system,\r\ntheir relative distances from each other, and their different\r\nmagnitudes, are represented as they really exist in what we call the\r\nheavens.--Author.] and conceived an idea of the infinity of space, and\r\nof the eternal divisibility of matter, and obtained, at least, a general\r\nknowledge of what was called natural philosophy, I began to compare, or,\r\nas I have before said, to confront, the internal evidence those things\r\nafford with the christian system of faith.\r\n\r\nThough it is not a direct article of the christian system that this\r\nworld that we inhabit is the whole of the habitable creation, yet it is\r\nso worked up therewith, from what is called the Mosaic account of the\r\ncreation, the story of Eve and the apple, and the counterpart of that\r\nstory, the death of the Son of God, that to believe otherwise, that is,\r\nto believe that God created a plurality of worlds, at least as numerous\r\nas what we call stars, renders the christian system of faith at once\r\nlittle and ridiculous; and scatters it in the mind like feathers in the\r\nair. The two beliefs can not be held together in the same mind; and he\r\nwho thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either.\r\n\r\nThough the belief of a plurality of worlds was familiar to the\r\nancients, it is only within the last three centuries that the extent and\r\ndimensions of this globe that we inhabit have been ascertained. Several\r\nvessels, following the tract of the ocean, have sailed entirely round\r\nthe world, as a man may march in a circle, and come round by the\r\ncontrary side of the circle to the spot he set out from. The circular\r\ndimensions of our world, in the widest part, as a man would measure the\r\nwidest round of an apple, or a ball, is only twenty-five thousand and\r\ntwenty English miles, reckoning sixty-nine miles and an half to an\r\nequatorial degree, and may be sailed round in the space of about three\r\nyears. [NOTE by Paine: Allowing a ship to sail, on an average, three\r\nmiles in an hour, she would sail entirely round the world in less than\r\none year, if she could sail in a direct circle, but she is obliged to\r\nfollow the course of the ocean.--Author.]\r\n\r\nA world of this extent may, at first thought, appear to us to be\r\ngreat; but if we compare it with the immensity of space in which it is\r\nsuspended, like a bubble or a balloon in the air, it is infinitely less\r\nin proportion than the smallest grain of sand is to the size of\r\nthe world, or the finest particle of dew to the whole ocean, and is\r\ntherefore but small; and, as will be hereafter shown, is only one of a\r\nsystem of worlds, of which the universal creation is composed.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to gain some faint idea of the immensity of space\r\nin which this and all the other worlds are suspended, if we follow a\r\nprogression of ideas. When we think of the size or dimensions of, a\r\nroom, our ideas limit themselves to the walls, and there they stop.\r\nBut when our eye, or our imagination darts into space, that is, when\r\nit looks upward into what we call the open air, we cannot conceive any\r\nwalls or boundaries it can have; and if for the sake of resting our\r\nideas we suppose a boundary, the question immediately renews itself, and\r\nasks, what is beyond that boundary? and in the same manner, what beyond\r\nthe next boundary? and so on till the fatigued imagination returns and\r\nsays, there is no end. Certainly, then, the Creator was not pent for\r\nroom when he made this world no larger than it is; and we have to seek\r\nthe reason in something else.\r\n\r\nIf we take a survey of our own world, or rather of this, of which the\r\nCreator has given us the use as our portion in the immense system of\r\ncreation, we find every part of it, the earth, the waters, and the air\r\nthat surround it, filled, and as it were crowded with life, down from\r\nthe largest animals that we know of to the smallest insects the naked\r\neye can behold, and from thence to others still smaller, and totally\r\ninvisible without the assistance of the microscope. Every tree, every\r\nplant, every leaf, serves not only as an habitation, but as a world\r\nto some numerous race, till animal existence becomes so exceedingly\r\nrefined, that the effluvia of a blade of grass would be food for\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nSince then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is it to be\r\nsupposed that the immensity of space is a naked void, lying in eternal\r\nwaste? There is room for millions of worlds as large or larger than\r\nours, and each of them millions of miles apart from each other.\r\n\r\nHaving now arrived at this point, if we carry our ideas only one thought\r\nfurther, we shall see, perhaps, the true reason, at least a very good\r\nreason for our happiness, why the Creator, instead of making one immense\r\nworld, extending over an immense quantity of space, has preferred\r\ndividing that quantity of matter into several distinct and separate\r\nworlds, which we call planets, of which our earth is one. But before I\r\nexplain my ideas upon this subject, it is necessary (not for the sake\r\nof those that already know, but for those who do not) to show what the\r\nsystem of the universe is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV - SYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\nTHAT part of the universe that is called the solar system (meaning the\r\nsystem of worlds to which our earth belongs, and of which Sol, or in\r\nEnglish language, the Sun, is the center) consists, besides the Sun, of\r\nsix distinct orbs, or planets, or worlds, besides the secondary bodies,\r\ncalled the satellites, or moons, of which our earth has one that attends\r\nher in her annual revolution round the Sun, in like manner as the\r\nother satellites or moons, attend the planets or worlds to which they\r\nseverally belong, as may be seen by the assistance of the telescope.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is the center round which those six worlds or planets revolve at\r\ndifferent distances therefrom, and in circles concentric to each other.\r\nEach world keeps constantly in nearly the same tract round the Sun, and\r\ncontinues at the same time turning round itself, in nearly an upright\r\nposition, as a top turns round itself when it is spinning on the ground,\r\nand leans a little sideways.\r\n\r\nIt is this leaning of the earth (23 1/2 degrees) that occasions summer\r\nand winter, and the different length of days and nights. If the earth\r\nturned round itself in a position perpendicular to the plane or level\r\nof the circle it moves in round the Sun, as a top turns round when it\r\nstands erect on the ground, the days and nights would be always of the\r\nsame length, twelve hours day and twelve hours night, and the season\r\nwould be uniformly the same throughout the year.\r\n\r\nEvery time that a planet (our earth for example) turns round itself, it\r\nmakes what we call day and night; and every time it goes entirely round\r\nthe Sun, it makes what we call a year, consequently our world turns\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five times round itself, in going once round the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nThe names that the ancients gave to those six worlds, and which are\r\nstill called by the same names, are Mercury, Venus, this world that we\r\ncall ours, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They appear larger to the eye than\r\nthe stars, being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the\r\nstars are. The planet Venus is that which is called the evening star,\r\nand sometimes the morning star, as she happens to set after, or rise\r\nbefore the Sun, which in either case is never more than three hours.\r\n\r\nThe Sun as before said being the center, the planet or world nearest the\r\nSun is Mercury; his distance from the Sun is thirty-four million miles,\r\nand he moves round in a circle always at that distance from the Sun, as\r\na top may be supposed to spin round in the tract in which a horse goes\r\nin a mill. The second world is Venus; she is fifty-seven million miles\r\ndistant from the Sun, and consequently moves round in a circle much\r\ngreater than that of Mercury. The third world is this that we inhabit,\r\nand which is eighty-eight million miles distant from the Sun, and\r\nconsequently moves round in a circle greater than that of Venus. The\r\nfourth world is Mars; he is distant from the sun one hundred and\r\nthirty-four million miles, and consequently moves round in a circle\r\ngreater than that of our earth. The fifth is Jupiter; he is distant from\r\nthe Sun five hundred and fifty-seven million miles, and consequently\r\nmoves round in a circle greater than that of Mars. The sixth world is\r\nSaturn; he is distant from the Sun seven hundred and sixty-three million\r\nmiles, and consequently moves round in a circle that surrounds the\r\ncircles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets.\r\n\r\nThe space, therefore, in the air, or in the immensity of space, that\r\nour solar system takes up for the several worlds to perform their\r\nrevolutions in round the Sun, is of the extent in a strait line of the\r\nwhole diameter of the orbit or circle in which Saturn moves round the\r\nSun, which being double his distance from the Sun, is fifteen hundred\r\nand twenty-six million miles; and its circular extent is nearly five\r\nthousand million; and its globical content is almost three thousand five\r\nhundred million times three thousand five hundred million square miles.\r\n[NOTE by Paine: If it should be asked, how can man know these things? I\r\nhave one plain answer to give, which is, that man knows how to calculate\r\nan eclipse, and also how to calculate to a minute of time when the\r\nplanet Venus, in making her revolutions round the Sun, will come in a\r\nstrait line between our earth and the Sun, and will appear to us about\r\nthe size of a large pea passing across the face of the Sun. This happens\r\nbut twice in about a hundred years, at the distance of about eight years\r\nfrom each other, and has happened twice in our time, both of which were\r\nforeknown by calculation. It can also be known when they will happen\r\nagain for a thousand years to come, or to any other portion of time.\r\nAs therefore, man could not be able to do these things if he did not\r\nunderstand the solar system, and the manner in which the revolutions of\r\nthe several planets or worlds are performed, the fact of calculating an\r\neclipse, or a transit of Venus, is a proof in point that the knowledge\r\nexists; and as to a few thousand, or even a few million miles, more\r\nor less, it makes scarcely any sensible difference in such immense\r\ndistances.--Author.]\r\n\r\nBut this, immense as it is, is only one system of worlds. Beyond this,\r\nat a vast distance into space, far beyond all power of calculation, are\r\nthe stars called the fixed stars. They are called fixed, because they\r\nhave no revolutionary motion, as the six worlds or planets have that\r\nI have been describing. Those fixed stars continue always at the same\r\ndistance from each other, and always in the same place, as the Sun does\r\nin the center of our system. The probability, therefore, is that each of\r\nthose fixed stars is also a Sun, round which another system of worlds or\r\nplanets, though too remote for us to discover, performs its revolutions,\r\nas our system of worlds does round our central Sun. By this easy\r\nprogression of ideas, the immensity of space will appear to us to be\r\nfilled with systems of worlds; and that no part of space lies at\r\nwaste, any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left\r\nunoccupied.\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to convey, in a familiar and easy manner, some\r\nidea of the structure of the universe, I return to explain what I before\r\nalluded to, namely, the great benefits arising to man in consequence of\r\nthe Creator having made a Plurality of worlds, such as our system is,\r\nconsisting of a central Sun and six worlds, besides satellites, in\r\npreference to that of creating one world only of a vast extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV - ADVANTAGES OF THE EXISTENCE OF MANY WORLDS IN EACH SOLAR\r\nSYSTEM.\r\n\r\nIT is an idea I have never lost sight of, that all our knowledge of\r\nscience is derived from the revolutions (exhibited to our eye and from\r\nthence to our understanding) which those several planets or worlds of\r\nwhich our system is composed make in their circuit round the Sun.\r\n\r\nHad then the quantity of matter which these six worlds contain been\r\nblended into one solitary globe, the consequence to us would have\r\nbeen, that either no revolutionary motion would have existed, or not a\r\nsufficiency of it to give us the ideas and the knowledge of science we\r\nnow have; and it is from the sciences that all the mechanical arts that\r\ncontribute so much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived.\r\n\r\nAs therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, so also must it be\r\nbelieved that he organized the structure of the universe in the most\r\nadvantageous manner for the benefit of man; and as we see, and from\r\nexperience feel, the benefits we derive from the structure of the\r\nuniverse, formed as it is, which benefits we should not have had the\r\nopportunity of enjoying if the structure, so far as relates to our\r\nsystem, had been a solitary globe, we can discover at least one reason\r\nwhy a plurality of worlds has been made, and that reason calls forth the\r\ndevotional gratitude of man, as well as his admiration.\r\n\r\nBut it is not to us, the inhabitants of this globe, only, that the\r\nbenefits arising from a plurality of worlds are limited. The inhabitants\r\nof each of the worlds of which our system is composed, enjoy the same\r\nopportunities of knowledge as we do. They behold the revolutionary\r\nmotions of our earth, as we behold theirs. All the planets revolve\r\nin sight of each other; and, therefore, the same universal school of\r\nscience presents itself to all.\r\n\r\nNeither does the knowledge stop here. The system of worlds next to us\r\nexhibits, in its revolutions, the same principles and school of science,\r\nto the inhabitants of their system, as our system does to us, and in\r\nlike manner throughout the immensity of space.\r\n\r\nOur ideas, not only of the almightiness of the Creator, but of his\r\nwisdom and his beneficence, become enlarged in proportion as we\r\ncontemplate the extent and the structure of the universe. The solitary\r\nidea of a solitary world, rolling or at rest in the immense ocean of\r\nspace, gives place to the cheerful idea of a society of worlds, so\r\nhappily contrived as to administer, even by their motion, instruction\r\nto man. We see our own earth filled with abundance; but we forget to\r\nconsider how much of that abundance is owing to the scientific knowledge\r\nthe vast machinery of the universe has unfolded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI - APPLICATION OF THE PRECEDING TO THE SYSTEM OF THE\r\nCHRISTIANS.\r\n\r\nBUT, in the midst of those reflections, what are we to think of the\r\nchristian system of faith that forms itself upon the idea of only\r\none world, and that of no greater extent, as is before shown, than\r\ntwenty-five thousand miles. An extent which a man, walking at the rate\r\nof three miles an hour for twelve hours in the day, could he keep on in\r\na circular direction, would walk entirely round in less than two years.\r\nAlas! what is this to the mighty ocean of space, and the almighty power\r\nof the Creator!\r\n\r\nFrom whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that\r\nthe Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his\r\nprotection, should quit the care of all the rest, and come to die in our\r\nworld, because, they say, one man and one woman had eaten an apple! And,\r\non the other hand, are we to suppose that every world in the boundless\r\ncreation had an Eve, an apple, a serpent, and a redeemer? In this case,\r\nthe person who is irreverently called the Son of God, and sometimes\r\nGod himself, would have nothing else to do than to travel from world\r\nto world, in an endless succession of death, with scarcely a momentary\r\ninterval of life.\r\n\r\nIt has been by rejecting the evidence, that the word, or works of God in\r\nthe creation, affords to our senses, and the action of our reason upon\r\nthat evidence, that so many wild and whimsical systems of faith, and of\r\nreligion, have been fabricated and set up. There may be many systems of\r\nreligion that so far from being morally bad are in many respects morally\r\ngood: but there can be but ONE that is true; and that one necessarily\r\nmust, as it ever will, be in all things consistent with the ever\r\nexisting word of God that we behold in his works. But such is the\r\nstrange construction of the christian system of faith, that every\r\nevidence the heavens affords to man, either directly contradicts it or\r\nrenders it absurd.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to believe, and I always feel pleasure in encouraging\r\nmyself to believe it, that there have been men in the world who\r\npersuaded themselves that what is called a pious fraud, might, at least\r\nunder particular circumstances, be productive of some good. But the\r\nfraud being once established, could not afterwards be explained; for\r\nit is with a pious fraud as with a bad action, it begets a calamitous\r\nnecessity of going on.\r\n\r\nThe persons who first preached the christian system of faith, and in\r\nsome measure combined with it the morality preached by Jesus Christ,\r\nmight persuade themselves that it was better than the heathen mythology\r\nthat then prevailed. From the first preachers the fraud went on to\r\nthe second, and to the third, till the idea of its being a pious fraud\r\nbecame lost in the belief of its being true; and that belief became\r\nagain encouraged by the interest of those who made a livelihood by\r\npreaching it.\r\n\r\nBut though such a belief might, by such means, be rendered almost\r\ngeneral among the laity, it is next to impossible to account for the\r\ncontinual persecution carried on by the church, for several hundred\r\nyears, against the sciences, and against the professors of science, if\r\nthe church had not some record or tradition that it was originally\r\nno other than a pious fraud, or did not foresee that it could not be\r\nmaintained against the evidence that the structure of the universe\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII - OF THE MEANS EMPLOYED IN ALL TIME, AND ALMOST\r\nUNIVERSALLY, TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLES.\r\n\r\nHAVING thus shown the irreconcileable inconsistencies between the real\r\nword of God existing in the universe, and that which is called the word\r\nof God, as shown to us in a printed book that any man might make, I\r\nproceed to speak of the three principal means that have been employed in\r\nall ages, and perhaps in all countries, to impose upon mankind.\r\n\r\nThose three means are Mystery, Miracle, and Prophecy, The first two\r\nare incompatible with true religion, and the third ought always to be\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Mystery, everything we behold is, in one sense, a\r\nmystery to us. Our own existence is a mystery: the whole vegetable world\r\nis a mystery. We cannot account how it is that an acorn, when put into\r\nthe ground, is made to develop itself and become an oak. We know not how\r\nit is that the seed we sow unfolds and multiplies itself, and returns to\r\nus such an abundant interest for so small a capital.\r\n\r\nThe fact however, as distinct from the operating cause, is not a\r\nmystery, because we see it; and we know also the means we are to\r\nuse, which is no other than putting the seed in the ground. We know,\r\ntherefore, as much as is necessary for us to know; and that part of\r\nthe operation that we do not know, and which if we did, we could not\r\nperform, the Creator takes upon himself and performs it for us. We are,\r\ntherefore, better off than if we had been let into the secret, and left\r\nto do it for ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut though every created thing is, in this sense, a mystery, the word\r\nmystery cannot be applied to moral truth, any more than obscurity can\r\nbe applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth,\r\nand not a God of mystery or obscurity. Mystery is the antagonist\r\nof truth. It is a fog of human invention that obscures truth, and\r\nrepresents it in distortion. Truth never envelops itself in mystery;\r\nand the mystery in which it is at any time enveloped, is the work of its\r\nantagonist, and never of itself.\r\n\r\nReligion, therefore, being the belief of a God, and the practice of\r\nmoral truth, cannot have connection with mystery. The belief of a God,\r\nso far from having any thing of mystery in it, is of all beliefs the\r\nmost easy, because it arises to us, as is before observed, out of\r\nnecessity. And the practice of moral truth, or, in other words, a\r\npractical imitation of the moral goodness of God, is no other than our\r\nacting towards each other as he acts benignly towards all. We cannot\r\nserve God in the manner we serve those who cannot do without such\r\nservice; and, therefore, the only idea we can have of serving God, is\r\nthat of contributing to the happiness of the living creation that God\r\nhas made. This cannot be done by retiring ourselves from the society of\r\nthe world, and spending a recluse life in selfish devotion.\r\n\r\nThe very nature and design of religion, if I may so express it, prove\r\neven to demonstration that it must be free from every thing of mystery,\r\nand unincumbered with every thing that is mysterious. Religion,\r\nconsidered as a duty, is incumbent upon every living soul alike, and,\r\ntherefore, must be on a level to the understanding and comprehension of\r\nall. Man does not learn religion as he learns the secrets and mysteries\r\nof a trade. He learns the theory of religion by reflection. It arises\r\nout of the action of his own mind upon the things which he sees, or upon\r\nwhat he may happen to hear or to read, and the practice joins itself\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nWhen men, whether from policy or pious fraud, set up systems of religion\r\nincompatible with the word or works of God in the creation, and not\r\nonly above but repugnant to human comprehension, they were under the\r\nnecessity of inventing or adopting a word that should serve as a bar\r\nto all questions, inquiries and speculations. The word mystery answered\r\nthis purpose, and thus it has happened that religion, which is in itself\r\nwithout mystery, has been corrupted into a fog of mysteries.\r\n\r\nAs mystery answered all general purposes, miracle followed as an\r\noccasional auxiliary. The former served to bewilder the mind, the latter\r\nto puzzle the senses. The one was the lingo, the other the legerdemain.\r\n\r\nBut before going further into this subject, it will be proper to inquire\r\nwhat is to be understood by a miracle.\r\n\r\nIn the same sense that every thing may be said to be a mystery, so also\r\nmay it be said that every thing is a miracle, and that no one thing is\r\na greater miracle than another. The elephant, though larger, is not a\r\ngreater miracle than a mite: nor a mountain a greater miracle than an\r\natom. To an almighty power it is no more difficult to make the one than\r\nthe other, and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to\r\nmake one. Every thing, therefore, is a miracle, in one sense; whilst,\r\nin the other sense, there is no such thing as a miracle. It is a miracle\r\nwhen compared to our power, and to our comprehension. It is not a\r\nmiracle compared to the power that performs it. But as nothing in this\r\ndescription conveys the idea that is affixed to the word miracle, it is\r\nnecessary to carry the inquiry further.\r\n\r\nMankind have conceived to themselves certain laws, by which what they\r\ncall nature is supposed to act; and that a miracle is something contrary\r\nto the operation and effect of those laws. But unless we know the whole\r\nextent of those laws, and of what are commonly called the powers of\r\nnature, we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us\r\nwonderful or miraculous, be within, or be beyond, or be contrary to, her\r\nnatural power of acting.\r\n\r\nThe ascension of a man several miles high into the air, would have\r\neverything in it that constitutes the idea of a miracle, if it were not\r\nknown that a species of air can be generated several times lighter than\r\nthe common atmospheric air, and yet possess elasticity enough to prevent\r\nthe balloon, in which that light air is inclosed, from being compressed\r\ninto as many times less bulk, by the common air that surrounds it. In\r\nlike manner, extracting flashes or sparks of fire from the human body,\r\nas visibly as from a steel struck with a flint, and causing iron or\r\nsteel to move without any visible agent, would also give the idea of a\r\nmiracle, if we were not acquainted with electricity and magnetism; so\r\nalso would many other experiments in natural philosophy, to those who\r\nare not acquainted with the subject. The restoring persons to life who\r\nare to appearance dead as is practised upon drowned persons, would also\r\nbe a miracle, if it were not known that animation is capable of being\r\nsuspended without being extinct.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are performances by slight of hand, and by persons\r\nacting in concert, that have a miraculous appearance, which, when known,\r\nare thought nothing of. And, besides these, there are mechanical and\r\noptical deceptions. There is now an exhibition in Paris of ghosts or\r\nspectres, which, though it is not imposed upon the spectators as a fact,\r\nhas an astonishing appearance. As, therefore, we know not the extent to\r\nwhich either nature or art can go, there is no criterion to determine\r\nwhat a miracle is; and mankind, in giving credit to appearances, under\r\nthe idea of their being miracles, are subject to be continually imposed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nSince then appearances are so capable of deceiving, and things not\r\nreal have a strong resemblance to things that are, nothing can be more\r\ninconsistent than to suppose that the Almighty would make use of means,\r\nsuch as are called miracles, that would subject the person who performed\r\nthem to the suspicion of being an impostor, and the person who related\r\nthem to be suspected of lying, and the doctrine intended to be supported\r\nthereby to be suspected as a fabulous invention.\r\n\r\nOf all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to\r\nany system or opinion to which the name of religion has been given, that\r\nof miracle, however successful the imposition may have been, is the most\r\ninconsistent. For, in the first place, whenever recourse is had to show,\r\nfor the purpose of procuring that belief (for a miracle, under any\r\nidea of the word, is a show) it implies a lameness or weakness in the\r\ndoctrine that is preached. And, in the second place, it is degrading the\r\nAlmighty into the character of a show-man, playing tricks to amuse and\r\nmake the people stare and wonder. It is also the most equivocal sort of\r\nevidence that can be set up; for the belief is not to depend upon the\r\nthing called a miracle, but upon the credit of the reporter, who says\r\nthat he saw it; and, therefore, the thing, were it true, would have no\r\nbetter chance of being believed than if it were a lie.\r\n\r\nSuppose I were to say, that when I sat down to write this book, a hand\r\npresented itself in the air, took up the pen and wrote every word that\r\nis herein written; would any body believe me? Certainly they would not.\r\nWould they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact?\r\nCertainly they would not. Since then a real miracle, were it to happen,\r\nwould be subject to the same fate as the falsehood, the inconsistency\r\nbecomes the greater of supposing the Almighty would make use of means\r\nthat would not answer the purpose for which they were intended, even if\r\nthey were real.\r\n\r\nIf we are to suppose a miracle to be something so entirely out of the\r\ncourse of what is called nature, that she must go out of that course\r\nto accomplish it, and we see an account given of such a miracle by the\r\nperson who said he saw it, it raises a question in the mind very easily\r\ndecided, which is,--Is it more probable that nature should go out of\r\nher course, or that a man should tell a lie? We have never seen, in our\r\ntime, nature go out of her course; but we have good reason to believe\r\nthat millions of lies have been told in the same time; it is, therefore,\r\nat least millions to one, that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie.\r\n\r\nThe story of the whale swallowing Jonah, though a whale is large\r\nenough to do it, borders greatly on the marvellous; but it would have\r\napproached nearer to the idea of a miracle, if Jonah had swallowed the\r\nwhale. In this, which may serve for all cases of miracles, the matter\r\nwould decide itself as before stated, namely, Is it more probable that a\r\nman should have, swallowed a whale, or told a lie?\r\n\r\nBut suppose that Jonah had really swallowed the whale, and gone with\r\nit in his belly to Nineveh, and to convince the people that it was true\r\nhave cast it up in their sight, of the full length and size of a whale,\r\nwould they not have believed him to have been the devil instead of a\r\nprophet? or if the whale had carried Jonah to Nineveh, and cast him up\r\nin the same public manner, would they not have believed the whale to\r\nhave been the devil, and Jonah one of his imps?\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the\r\nNew Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ,\r\nand carrying him to the top of a high mountain; and to the top of the\r\nhighest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him\r\nall the kingdoms of the world. How happened it that he did not discover\r\nAmerica? or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nI have too much respect for the moral character of Christ to believe\r\nthat he told this whale of a miracle himself: neither is it easy to\r\naccount for what purpose it could have been fabricated, unless it were\r\nto impose upon the connoisseurs of miracles, as is sometimes practised\r\nupon the connoisseurs of Queen Anne's farthings, and collectors of\r\nrelics and antiquities; or to render the belief of miracles ridiculous,\r\nby outdoing miracle, as Don Quixote outdid chivalry; or to embarrass the\r\nbelief of miracles, by making it doubtful by what power, whether of God\r\nor of the devil, any thing called a miracle was performed. It requires,\r\nhowever, a great deal of faith in the devil to believe this miracle.\r\n\r\nIn every point of view in which those things called miracles can be\r\nplaced and considered, the reality of them is improbable, and their\r\nexistence unnecessary. They would not, as before observed, answer any\r\nuseful purpose, even if they were true; for it is more difficult to\r\nobtain belief to a miracle, than to a principle evidently moral, without\r\nany miracle. Moral principle speaks universally for itself. Miracle\r\ncould be but a thing of the moment, and seen but by a few; after this it\r\nrequires a transfer of faith from God to man to believe a miracle upon\r\nman's report. Instead, therefore, of admitting the recitals of miracles\r\nas evidence of any system of religion being true, they ought to be\r\nconsidered as symptoms of its being fabulous. It is necessary to the\r\nfull and upright character of truth that it rejects the crutch; and it\r\nis consistent with the character of fable to seek the aid that truth\r\nrejects. Thus much for Mystery and Miracle.\r\n\r\nAs Mystery and Miracle took charge of the past and the present, Prophecy\r\ntook charge of the future, and rounded the tenses of faith. It was\r\nnot sufficient to know what had been done, but what would be done. The\r\nsupposed prophet was the supposed historian of times to come; and if\r\nhe happened, in shooting with a long bow of a thousand years, to strike\r\nwithin a thousand miles of a mark, the ingenuity of posterity could make\r\nit point-blank; and if he happened to be directly wrong, it was only\r\nto suppose, as in the case of Jonah and Nineveh, that God had repented\r\nhimself and changed his mind. What a fool do fabulous systems make of\r\nman!\r\n\r\nIt has been shewn, in a former part of this work, that the original\r\nmeaning of the words prophet and prophesying has been changed, and that\r\na prophet, in the sense of the word as now used, is a creature of modern\r\ninvention; and it is owing to this change in the meaning of the words,\r\nthat the flights and metaphors of the Jewish poets, and phrases and\r\nexpressions now rendered obscure by our not being acquainted with the\r\nlocal circumstances to which they applied at the time they were used,\r\nhave been erected into prophecies, and made to bend to explanations\r\nat the will and whimsical conceits of sectaries, expounders, and\r\ncommentators. Every thing unintelligible was prophetical, and every\r\nthing insignificant was typical. A blunder would have served for a\r\nprophecy; and a dish-clout for a type.\r\n\r\nIf by a prophet we are to suppose a man to whom the Almighty\r\ncommunicated some event that would take place in future, either there\r\nwere such men, or there were not. If there were, it is consistent to\r\nbelieve that the event so communicated would be told in terms that could\r\nbe understood, and not related in such a loose and obscure manner as to\r\nbe out of the comprehension of those that heard it, and so equivocal\r\nas to fit almost any circumstance that might happen afterwards. It is\r\nconceiving very irreverently of the Almighty, to suppose he would\r\ndeal in this jesting manner with mankind; yet all the things called\r\nprophecies in the book called the Bible come under this description.\r\n\r\nBut it is with Prophecy as it is with Miracle. It could not answer the\r\npurpose even if it were real. Those to whom a prophecy should be told\r\ncould not tell whether the man prophesied or lied, or whether it had\r\nbeen revealed to him, or whether he conceited it; and if the thing that\r\nhe prophesied, or pretended to prophesy, should happen, or some thing\r\nlike it, among the multitude of things that are daily happening, nobody\r\ncould again know whether he foreknew it, or guessed at it, or whether\r\nit was accidental. A prophet, therefore, is a character useless and\r\nunnecessary; and the safe side of the case is to guard against being\r\nimposed upon, by not giving credit to such relations.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Mystery, Miracle, and Prophecy, are appendages that\r\nbelong to fabulous and not to true religion. They are the means by which\r\nso many Lo heres! and Lo theres! have been spread about the world,\r\nand religion been made into a trade. The success of one impostor gave\r\nencouragement to another, and the quieting salvo of doing some good by\r\nkeeping up a pious fraud protected them from remorse.\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\nHAVING now extended the subject to a greater length than I first\r\nintended, I shall bring it to a close by abstracting a summary from the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nFirst, That the idea or belief of a word of God existing in print, or in\r\nwriting, or in speech, is inconsistent in itself for the reasons already\r\nassigned. These reasons, among many others, are the want of an universal\r\nlanguage; the mutability of language; the errors to which translations\r\nare subject, the possibility of totally suppressing such a word; the\r\nprobability of altering it, or of fabricating the whole, and imposing it\r\nupon the world.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That the Creation we behold is the real and ever existing word\r\nof God, in which we cannot be deceived. It proclaimeth his power, it\r\ndemonstrates his wisdom, it manifests his goodness and beneficence.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That the moral duty of man consists in imitating the moral\r\ngoodness and beneficence of God manifested in the creation towards all\r\nhis creatures. That seeing as we daily do the goodness of God to all\r\nmen, it is an example calling upon all men to practise the same towards\r\neach other; and, consequently, that every thing of persecution and\r\nrevenge between man and man, and every thing of cruelty to animals, is a\r\nviolation of moral duty.\r\n\r\nI trouble not myself about the manner of future existence. I content\r\nmyself with believing, even to positive conviction, that the power that\r\ngave me existence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he\r\npleases, either with or without this body; and it appears more probable\r\nto me that I shall continue to exist hereafter than that I should have\r\nhad existence, as I now have, before that existence began.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, in one point, all nations of the earth and all\r\nreligions agree. All believe in a God. The things in which they disgrace\r\nare the redundancies annexed to that belief; and therefore, if ever an\r\nuniversal religion should prevail, it will not be believing any thing\r\nnew, but in getting rid of redundancies, and believing as man believed\r\nat first. [\"In the childhood of the world,\" according to the first\r\n(French) version; and the strict translation of the final sentence is:\r\n\"Deism was the religion of Adam, supposing him not an imaginary being;\r\nbut none the less must it be left to all men to follow, as is their\r\nright, the religion and worship they prefer.\"--Editor.] Adam, if ever\r\nthere was such a man, was created a Deist; but in the mean time, let\r\nevery man follow, as he has a right to do, the religion and worship he\r\nprefers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF REASON - PART II\r\n\r\n\r\n   Contents\r\n\r\n  * Preface\r\n  * Chapter I - The Old Testament\r\n  * Chapter II - The New Testament\r\n  * Chapter III - Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI HAVE mentioned in the former part of The Age of Reason that it had\r\nlong been my intention to publish my thoughts upon Religion; but that I\r\nhad originally reserved it to a later period in life, intending it to\r\nbe the last work I should undertake. The circumstances, however, which\r\nexisted in France in the latter end of the year 1793, determined me to\r\ndelay it no longer. The just and humane principles of the Revolution\r\nwhich Philosophy had first diffused, had been departed from. The Idea,\r\nalways dangerous to Society as it is derogatory to the Almighty,--that\r\npriests could forgive sins,--though it seemed to exist no longer, had\r\nblunted the feelings of humanity, and callously prepared men for the\r\ncommission of all crimes. The intolerant spirit of church persecution\r\nhad transferred itself into politics; the tribunals, stiled\r\nRevolutionary, supplied the place of an Inquisition; and the Guillotine\r\nof the Stake. I saw many of my most intimate friends destroyed; others\r\ndaily carried to prison; and I had reason to believe, and had also\r\nintimations given me, that the same danger was approaching myself.\r\n\r\nUnder these disadvantages, I began the former part of the Age of Reason;\r\nI had, besides, neither Bible nor Testament [It must be borne in mind\r\nthat throughout this work Paine generally means by \"Bible\" only the Old\r\nTestament, and speaks of the New as the \"Testament.\"--Editor.] to\r\nrefer to, though I was writing against both; nor could I procure any;\r\nnotwithstanding which I have produced a work that no Bible Believer,\r\nthough writing at his ease and with a Library of Church Books about him,\r\ncan refute. Towards the latter end of December of that year, a motion\r\nwas made and carried, to exclude foreigners from the Convention. There\r\nwere but two, Anacharsis Cloots and myself; and I saw I was particularly\r\npointed at by Bourdon de l'Oise, in his speech on that motion.\r\n\r\nConceiving, after this, that I had but a few days of liberty, I sat down\r\nand brought the work to a close as speedily as possible; and I had not\r\nfinished it more than six hours, in the state it has since appeared,\r\n[This is an allusion to the essay which Paine wrote at an earlier part\r\nof 1793. See Introduction.--Editor.] before a guard came there, about\r\nthree in the morning, with an order signed by the two Committees of\r\nPublic Safety and Surety General, for putting me in arrestation as\r\na foreigner, and conveying me to the prison of the Luxembourg. I\r\ncontrived, in my way there, to call on Joel Barlow, and I put the\r\nManuscript of the work into his hands, as more safe than in my\r\npossession in prison; and not knowing what might be the fate in France\r\neither of the writer or the work, I addressed it to the protection of\r\nthe citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is justice that I say, that the guard who executed this order, and\r\nthe interpreter to the Committee of General Surety, who accompanied\r\nthem to examine my papers, treated me not only with civility, but with\r\nrespect. The keeper of the 'Luxembourg, Benoit, a man of good heart,\r\nshewed to me every friendship in his power, as did also all his family,\r\nwhile he continued in that station. He was removed from it, put\r\ninto arrestation, and carried before the tribunal upon a malignant\r\naccusation, but acquitted.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been in Luxembourg about three weeks, the Americans then in\r\nParis went in a body to the Convention to reclaim me as their countryman\r\nand friend; but were answered by the President, Vadier, who was also\r\nPresident of the Committee of Surety General, and had signed the order\r\nfor my arrestation, that I was born in England. [These excited Americans\r\ndo not seem to have understood or reported the most important item in\r\nVadeer's reply, namely that their application was \"unofficial,\" i.e. not\r\nmade through or sanctioned by Gouverneur Morris, American Minister.\r\nFor the detailed history of all this see vol. iii.--Editor.] I heard no\r\nmore, after this, from any person out of the walls of the prison, till\r\nthe fall of Robespierre, on the 9th of Thermidor--July 27, 1794.\r\n\r\nAbout two months before this event, I was seized with a fever that in\r\nits progress had every symptom of becoming mortal, and from the effects\r\nof which I am not recovered. It was then that I remembered with renewed\r\nsatisfaction, and congratulated myself most sincerely, on having written\r\nthe former part of The Age of Reason. I had then but little expectation\r\nof surviving, and those about me had less. I know therefore by\r\nexperience the conscientious trial of my own principles.\r\n\r\nI was then with three chamber comrades: Joseph Vanheule of Bruges,\r\nCharles Bastfni, and Michael Robyns of Louvain. The unceasing and\r\nanxious attention of these three friends to me, by night and day, I\r\nremember with gratitude and mention with pleasure. It happened that a\r\nphysician (Dr. Graham) and a surgeon, (Mr. Bond,) part of the suite of\r\nGeneral O'Hara, [The officer who at Yorktown, Virginia, carried out\r\nthe sword of Cornwallis for surrender, and satirically offered it to\r\nRochambeau instead of Washington. Paine loaned him 300 pounds when he\r\n(O'Hara) left the prison, the money he had concealed in the lock of\r\nhis cell-door.--Editor.] were then in the Luxembourg: I ask not myself\r\nwhether it be convenient to them, as men under the English Government,\r\nthat I express to them my thanks; but I should reproach myself if I did\r\nnot; and also to the physician of the Luxembourg, Dr. Markoski.\r\n\r\nI have some reason to believe, because I cannot discover any other, that\r\nthis illness preserved me in existence. Among the papers of Robespierre\r\nthat were examined and reported upon to the Convention by a Committee of\r\nDeputies, is a note in the hand writing of Robespierre, in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Demander que Thomas Paine soit decrete d'accusation, pour l'interet de\r\nl'Amerique autant que de la France.\"\r\n\r\n[Demand that Thomas Paine be decreed of accusation, for the interest\r\nof America, as well as of France.] From what cause it was that the\r\nintention was not put in execution, I know not, and cannot inform\r\nmyself; and therefore I ascribe it to impossibility, on account of that\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nThe Convention, to repair as much as lay in their power the injustice I\r\nhad sustained, invited me publickly and unanimously to return into the\r\nConvention, and which I accepted, to shew I could bear an injury without\r\npermitting it to injure my principles or my disposition. It is not\r\nbecause right principles have been violated, that they are to be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nI have seen, since I have been at liberty, several publications written,\r\nsome in America, and some in England, as answers to the former part of\r\n\"The Age of Reason.\" If the authors of these can amuse themselves by so\r\ndoing, I shall not interrupt them, They may write against the work, and\r\nagainst me, as much as they please; they do me more service than they\r\nintend, and I can have no objection that they write on. They will find,\r\nhowever, by this Second Part, without its being written as an answer to\r\nthem, that they must return to their work, and spin their cobweb over\r\nagain. The first is brushed away by accident.\r\n\r\nThey will now find that I have furnished myself with a Bible and\r\nTestament; and I can say also that I have found them to be much worse\r\nbooks than I had conceived. If I have erred in any thing, in the former\r\npart of the Age of Reason, it has been by speaking better of some parts\r\nthan they deserved.\r\n\r\nI observe, that all my opponents resort, more or less, to what they call\r\nScripture Evidence and Bible authority, to help them out. They are\r\nso little masters of the subject, as to confound a dispute about\r\nauthenticity with a dispute about doctrines; I will, however, put them\r\nright, that if they should be disposed to write any more, they may know\r\nhow to begin.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAINE. October, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I - THE OLD TESTAMENT\r\n\r\nIT has often been said that any thing may be proved from the Bible; but\r\nbefore any thing can be admitted as proved by Bible, the Bible itself\r\nmust be proved to be true; for if the Bible be not true, or the truth of\r\nit be doubtful, it ceases to have authority, and cannot be admitted as\r\nproof of any thing.\r\n\r\nIt has been the practice of all Christian commentators on the Bible, and\r\nof all Christian priests and preachers, to impose the Bible on the\r\nworld as a mass of truth, and as the word of God; they have disputed\r\nand wrangled, and have anathematized each other about the supposeable\r\nmeaning of particular parts and passages therein; one has said and\r\ninsisted that such a passage meant such a thing, another that it meant\r\ndirectly the contrary, and a third, that it meant neither one nor the\r\nother, but something different from both; and this they have called\r\nunderstanding the Bible.\r\n\r\nIt has happened, that all the answers that I have seen to the former\r\npart of 'The Age of Reason' have been written by priests: and these\r\npious men, like their predecessors, contend and wrangle, and understand\r\nthe Bible; each understands it differently, but each understands it\r\nbest; and they have agreed in nothing but in telling their readers that\r\nThomas Paine understands it not.\r\n\r\nNow instead of wasting their time, and heating themselves in fractious\r\ndisputations about doctrinal points drawn from the Bible, these men\r\nought to know, and if they do not it is civility to inform them,\r\nthat the first thing to be understood is, whether there is sufficient\r\nauthority for believing the Bible to be the word of God, or whether\r\nthere is not?\r\n\r\nThere are matters in that book, said to be done by the express command\r\nof God, that are as shocking to humanity, and to every idea we have of\r\nmoral justice, as any thing done by Robespierre, by Carrier, by Joseph\r\nle Bon, in France, by the English government in the East Indies, or by\r\nany other assassin in modern times. When we read in the books ascribed\r\nto Moses, Joshua, etc., that they (the Israelites) came by stealth upon\r\nwhole nations of people, who, as the history itself shews, had given\r\nthem no offence; that they put all those nations to the sword; that they\r\nspared neither age nor infancy; that they utterly destroyed men, women\r\nand children; that they left not a soul to breathe; expressions that are\r\nrepeated over and over again in those books, and that too with exulting\r\nferocity; are we sure these things are facts? are we sure that the\r\nCreator of man commissioned those things to be done? Are we sure that\r\nthe books that tell us so were written by his authority?\r\n\r\nIt is not the antiquity of a tale that is an evidence of its truth;\r\non the contrary, it is a symptom of its being fabulous; for the more\r\nancient any history pretends to be, the more it has the resemblance of\r\na fable. The origin of every nation is buried in fabulous tradition, and\r\nthat of the Jews is as much to be suspected as any other.\r\n\r\nTo charger the commission of things upon the Almighty, which in their\r\nown nature, and by every rule of moral justice, are crimes, as all\r\nassassination is, and more especially the assassination of infants, is\r\nmatter of serious concern. The Bible tells us, that those assassinations\r\nwere done by the express command of God. To believe therefore the Bible\r\nto be true, we must unbelieve all our belief in the moral justice of\r\nGod; for wherein could crying or smiling infants offend? And to read\r\nthe Bible without horror, we must undo every thing that is tender,\r\nsympathising, and benevolent in the heart of man. Speaking for myself,\r\nif I had no other evidence that the Bible is fabulous, than the\r\nsacrifice I must make to believe it to be true, that alone would be\r\nsufficient to determine my choice.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to all the moral evidence against the Bible, I will, in\r\nthe progress of this work, produce such other evidence as even a\r\npriest cannot deny; and show, from that evidence, that the Bible is not\r\nentitled to credit, as being the word of God.\r\n\r\nBut, before I proceed to this examination, I will show wherein the Bible\r\ndiffers from all other ancient writings with respect to the nature of\r\nthe evidence necessary to establish its authenticity; and this is is\r\nthe more proper to be done, because the advocates of the Bible, in their\r\nanswers to the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' undertake to say, and\r\nthey put some stress thereon, that the authenticity of the Bible is as\r\nwell established as that of any other ancient book: as if our belief of\r\nthe one could become any rule for our belief of the other.\r\n\r\nI know, however, but of one ancient book that authoritatively challenges\r\nuniversal consent and belief, and that is Euclid's Elements of Geometry;\r\n[Euclid, according to chronological history, lived three hundred years\r\nbefore Christ, and about one hundred before Archimedes; he was of the\r\ncity of Alexandria, in Egypt.--Author.] and the reason is, because it\r\nis a book of self-evident demonstration, entirely independent of its\r\nauthor, and of every thing relating to time, place, and circumstance.\r\nThe matters contained in that book would have the same authority they\r\nnow have, had they been written by any other person, or had the work\r\nbeen anonymous, or had the author never been known; for the identical\r\ncertainty of who was the author makes no part of our belief of the\r\nmatters contained in the book. But it is quite otherwise with respect to\r\nthe books ascribed to Moses, to Joshua, to Samuel, etc.: those are\r\nbooks of testimony, and they testify of things naturally incredible;\r\nand therefore the whole of our belief, as to the authenticity of those\r\nbooks, rests, in the first place, upon the certainty that they were\r\nwritten by Moses, Joshua, and Samuel; secondly, upon the credit we give\r\nto their testimony. We may believe the first, that is, may believe the\r\ncertainty of the authorship, and yet not the testimony; in the same\r\nmanner that we may believe that a certain person gave evidence upon a\r\ncase, and yet not believe the evidence that he gave. But if it should\r\nbe found that the books ascribed to Moses, Joshua, and Samuel, were not\r\nwritten by Moses, Joshua, and Samuel, every part of the authority and\r\nauthenticity of those books is gone at once; for there can be no such\r\nthing as forged or invented testimony; neither can there be anonymous\r\ntestimony, more especially as to things naturally incredible; such\r\nas that of talking with God face to face, or that of the sun and moon\r\nstanding still at the command of a man.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of the other ancient books are works of genius; of\r\nwhich kind are those ascribed to Homer, to Plato, to Aristotle, to\r\nDemosthenes, to Cicero, etc. Here again the author is not an essential\r\nin the credit we give to any of those works; for as works of genius they\r\nwould have the same merit they have now, were they anonymous. Nobody\r\nbelieves the Trojan story, as related by Homer, to be true; for it is\r\nthe poet only that is admired, and the merit of the poet will remain,\r\nthough the story be fabulous. But if we disbelieve the matters related\r\nby the Bible authors (Moses for instance) as we disbelieve the things\r\nrelated by Homer, there remains nothing of Moses in our estimation, but\r\nan imposter. As to the ancient historians, from Herodotus to Tacitus, we\r\ncredit them as far as they relate things probable and credible, and no\r\nfurther: for if we do, we must believe the two miracles which Tacitus\r\nrelates were performed by Vespasian, that of curing a lame man, and a\r\nblind man, in just the same manner as the same things are told of Jesus\r\nChrist by his historians. We must also believe the miracles cited by\r\nJosephus, that of the sea of Pamphilia opening to let Alexander and his\r\narmy pass, as is related of the Red Sea in Exodus. These miracles are\r\nquite as well authenticated as the Bible miracles, and yet we do not\r\nbelieve them; consequently the degree of evidence necessary to establish\r\nour belief of things naturally incredible, whether in the Bible or\r\nelsewhere, is far greater than that which obtains our belief to natural\r\nand probable things; and therefore the advocates for the Bible have no\r\nclaim to our belief of the Bible because that we believe things stated\r\nin other ancient writings; since that we believe the things stated\r\nin those writings no further than they are probable and credible, or\r\nbecause they are self-evident, like Euclid; or admire them because they\r\nare elegant, like Homer; or approve them because they are sedate, like\r\nPlato; or judicious, like Aristotle.\r\n\r\nHaving premised these things, I proceed to examine the authenticity of\r\nthe Bible; and I begin with what are called the five books of Moses,\r\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. My intention is to\r\nshew that those books are spurious, and that Moses is not the author of\r\nthem; and still further, that they were not written in the time of Moses\r\nnor till several hundred years afterwards; that they are no other than\r\nan attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he\r\nis said to have lived, and also of the times prior thereto, written by\r\nsome very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship, several hundred\r\nyears after the death of Moses; as men now write histories of things\r\nthat happened, or are supposed to have happened, several hundred or\r\nseveral thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nThe evidence that I shall produce in this case is from the books\r\nthemselves; and I will confine myself to this evidence only. Were I to\r\nrefer for proofs to any of the ancient authors, whom the advocates of\r\nthe Bible call prophane authors, they would controvert that authority,\r\nas I controvert theirs: I will therefore meet them on their own ground,\r\nand oppose them with their own weapon, the Bible.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is no affirmative evidence that Moses is\r\nthe author of those books; and that he is the author, is altogether an\r\nunfounded opinion, got abroad nobody knows how. The style and manner\r\nin which those books are written give no room to believe, or even to\r\nsuppose, they were written by Moses; for it is altogether the style and\r\nmanner of another person speaking of Moses. In Exodus, Leviticus and\r\nNumbers, (for every thing in Genesis is prior to the times of Moses and\r\nnot the least allusion is made to him therein,) the whole, I say, of\r\nthese books is in the third person; it is always, the Lord said unto\r\nMoses, or Moses said unto the Lord; or Moses said unto the people,\r\nor the people said unto Moses; and this is the style and manner that\r\nhistorians use in speaking of the person whose lives and actions they\r\nare writing. It may be said, that a man may speak of himself in the\r\nthird person, and, therefore, it may be supposed that Moses did; but\r\nsupposition proves nothing; and if the advocates for the belief that\r\nMoses wrote those books himself have nothing better to advance than\r\nsupposition, they may as well be silent.\r\n\r\nBut granting the grammatical right, that Moses might speak of himself in\r\nthe third person, because any man might speak of himself in that manner,\r\nit cannot be admitted as a fact in those books, that it is Moses who\r\nspeaks, without rendering Moses truly ridiculous and absurd:--for\r\nexample, Numbers xii. 3: \"Now the man Moses was very MEEK, above all the\r\nmen which were on the face of the earth.\" If Moses said this of himself,\r\ninstead of being the meekest of men, he was one of the most vain and\r\narrogant coxcombs; and the advocates for those books may now take which\r\nside they please, for both sides are against them: if Moses was not the\r\nauthor, the books are without authority; and if he was the author, the\r\nauthor is without credit, because to boast of meekness is the reverse of\r\nmeekness, and is a lie in sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn Deuteronomy, the style and manner of writing marks more evidently\r\nthan in the former books that Moses is not the writer. The manner here\r\nused is dramatical; the writer opens the subject by a short introductory\r\ndiscourse, and then introduces Moses as in the act of speaking, and when\r\nhe has made Moses finish his harrangue, he (the writer) resumes his own\r\npart, and speaks till he brings Moses forward again, and at last closes\r\nthe scene with an account of the death, funeral, and character of Moses.\r\n\r\nThis interchange of speakers occurs four times in this book: from the\r\nfirst verse of the first chapter, to the end of the fifth verse, it is\r\nthe writer who speaks; he then introduces Moses as in the act of making\r\nhis harrangue, and this continues to the end of the 40th verse of the\r\nfourth chapter; here the writer drops Moses, and speaks historically of\r\nwhat was done in consequence of what Moses, when living, is supposed to\r\nhave said, and which the writer has dramatically rehearsed.\r\n\r\nThe writer opens the subject again in the first verse of the fifth\r\nchapter, though it is only by saying that Moses called the people of\r\nIsrael together; he then introduces Moses as before, and continues him\r\nas in the act of speaking, to the end of the 26th chapter. He does the\r\nsame thing at the beginning of the 27th chapter; and continues Moses\r\nas in the act of speaking, to the end of the 28th chapter. At the 29th\r\nchapter the writer speaks again through the whole of the first verse,\r\nand the first line of the second verse, where he introduces Moses for\r\nthe last time, and continues him as in the act of speaking, to the end\r\nof the 33d chapter.\r\n\r\nThe writer having now finished the rehearsal on the part of Moses, comes\r\nforward, and speaks through the whole of the last chapter: he begins by\r\ntelling the reader, that Moses went up to the top of Pisgah, that he\r\nsaw from thence the land which (the writer says) had been promised to\r\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob; that he, Moses, died there in the land of\r\nMoab, that he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, but that no\r\nman knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day, that is unto the time in\r\nwhich the writer lived who wrote the book of Deuteronomy. The writer\r\nthen tells us, that Moses was one hundred and ten years of age when he\r\ndied--that his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated; and he\r\nconcludes by saying, that there arose not a prophet since in Israel\r\nlike unto Moses, whom, says this anonymous writer, the Lord knew face to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shewn, as far as grammatical evidence implies, that\r\nMoses was not the writer of those books, I will, after making a few\r\nobservations on the inconsistencies of the writer of the book of\r\nDeuteronomy, proceed to shew, from the historical and chronological\r\nevidence contained in those books, that Moses was not, because he could\r\nnot be, the writer of them; and consequently, that there is no authority\r\nfor believing that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of men, women, and\r\nchildren, told of in those books, were done, as those books say they\r\nwere, at the command of God. It is a duty incumbent on every true deist,\r\nthat he vindicates the moral justice of God against the calumnies of the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the book of Deuteronomy, whoever he was, for it is an\r\nanonymous work, is obscure, and also contradictory with himself in the\r\naccount he has given of Moses.\r\n\r\nAfter telling that Moses went to the top of Pisgah (and it does not\r\nappear from any account that he ever came down again) he tells us, that\r\nMoses died there in the land of Moab, and that he buried him in a valley\r\nin the land of Moab; but as there is no antecedent to the pronoun he,\r\nthere is no knowing who he was, that did bury him. If the writer meant\r\nthat he (God) buried him, how should he (the writer) know it? or why\r\nshould we (the readers) believe him? since we know not who the writer\r\nwas that tells us so, for certainly Moses could not himself tell where\r\nhe was buried.\r\n\r\nThe writer also tells us, that no man knoweth where the sepulchre of\r\nMoses is unto this day, meaning the time in which this writer lived;\r\nhow then should he know that Moses was buried in a valley in the land\r\nof Moab? for as the writer lived long after the time of Moses, as is\r\nevident from his using the expression of unto this day, meaning a great\r\nlength of time after the death of Moses, he certainly was not at his\r\nfuneral; and on the other hand, it is impossible that Moses himself\r\ncould say that no man knoweth where the sepulchre is unto this day. To\r\nmake Moses the speaker, would be an improvement on the play of a child\r\nthat hides himself and cries nobody can find me; nobody can find Moses.\r\n\r\nThis writer has no where told us how he came by the speeches which he\r\nhas put into the mouth of Moses to speak, and therefore we have a right\r\nto conclude that he either composed them himself, or wrote them from\r\noral tradition. One or other of these is the more probable, since he\r\nhas given, in the fifth chapter, a table of commandments, in which that\r\ncalled the fourth commandment is different from the fourth commandment\r\nin the twentieth chapter of Exodus. In that of Exodus, the reason given\r\nfor keeping the seventh day is, because (says the commandment) God made\r\nthe heavens and the earth in six days, and rested on the seventh; but in\r\nthat of Deuteronomy, the reason given is, that it was the day on which\r\nthe children of Israel came out of Egypt, and therefore, says this\r\ncommandment, the Lord thy God commanded thee to kee the sabbath-day This\r\nmakes no mention of the creation, nor that of the coming out of Egypt.\r\nThere are also many things given as laws of Moses in this book, that are\r\nnot to be found in any of the other books; among which is that inhuman\r\nand brutal law, xxi. 18, 19, 20, 21, which authorizes parents, the\r\nfather and the mother, to bring their own children to have them stoned\r\nto death for what it pleased them to call stubbornness.--But priests\r\nhave always been fond of preaching up Deuteronomy, for Deuteronomy\r\npreaches up tythes; and it is from this book, xxv. 4, they have taken\r\nthe phrase, and applied it to tything, that \"thou shalt not muzzle\r\nthe ox when he treadeth Out the corn:\" and that this might not escape\r\nobservation, they have noted it in the table of contents at the head of\r\nthe chapter, though it is only a single verse of less than two lines. O\r\npriests! priests! ye are willing to be compared to an ox, for the sake\r\nof tythes. [An elegant pocket edition of Paine's Theological Works\r\n(London. R. Carlile, 1822) has in its title a picture of Paine, as a\r\nMoses in evening dress, unfolding the two tables of his \"Age of Reason\"\r\nto a farmer from whom the Bishop of Llandaff (who replied to this work)\r\nhas taken a sheaf and a lamb which he is carrying to a church at the\r\nsummit of a well stocked hill.--Editor.]--Though it is impossible for\r\nus to know identically who the writer of Deuteronomy was, it is not\r\ndifficult to discover him professionally, that he was some Jewish\r\npriest, who lived, as I shall shew in the course of this work, at least\r\nthree hundred and fifty years after the time of Moses.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak of the historical and chronological evidence. The\r\nchronology that I shall use is the Bible chronology; for I mean not to\r\ngo out of the Bible for evidence of any thing, but to make the Bible\r\nitself prove historically and chronologically that Moses is not the\r\nauthor of the books ascribed to him. It is therefore proper that I\r\ninform the readers (such an one at least as may not have the opportunity\r\nof knowing it) that in the larger Bibles, and also in some smaller ones,\r\nthere is a series of chronology printed in the margin of every page for\r\nthe purpose of showing how long the historical matters stated in each\r\npage happened, or are supposed to have happened, before Christ, and\r\nconsequently the distance of time between one historical circumstance\r\nand another.\r\n\r\nI begin with the book of Genesis.--In Genesis xiv., the writer gives an\r\naccount of Lot being taken prisoner in a battle between the four kings\r\nagainst five, and carried off; and that when the account of Lot being\r\ntaken came to Abraham, that he armed all his household and marched to\r\nrescue Lot from the captors; and that he pursued them unto Dan. (ver.\r\n14.)\r\n\r\nTo shew in what manner this expression of Pursuing them unto Dan applies\r\nto the case in question, I will refer to two circumstances, the one in\r\nAmerica, the other in France. The city now called New York, in America,\r\nwas originally New Amsterdam; and the town in France, lately called\r\nHavre Marat, was before called Havre-de-Grace. New Amsterdam was changed\r\nto New York in the year 1664; Havre-de-Grace to Havre Marat in the year\r\n1793. Should, therefore, any writing be found, though without date,\r\nin which the name of New-York should be mentioned, it would be certain\r\nevidence that such a writing could not have been written before, and\r\nmust have been written after New Amsterdam was changed to New York, and\r\nconsequently not till after the year 1664, or at least during the course\r\nof that year. And in like manner, any dateless writing, with the name\r\nof Havre Marat, would be certain evidence that such a writing must have\r\nbeen written after Havre-de-Grace became Havre Marat, and consequently\r\nnot till after the year 1793, or at least during the course of that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nI now come to the application of those cases, and to show that there\r\nwas no such place as Dan till many years after the death of Moses; and\r\nconsequently, that Moses could not be the writer of the book of Genesis,\r\nwhere this account of pursuing them unto Dan is given.\r\n\r\nThe place that is called Dan in the Bible was originally a town of the\r\nGentiles, called Laish; and when the tribe of Dan seized upon this\r\ntown, they changed its name to Dan, in commemoration of Dan, who was the\r\nfather of that tribe, and the great grandson of Abraham.\r\n\r\nTo establish this in proof, it is necessary to refer from Genesis to\r\nchapter xviii. of the book called the Book of judges. It is there said\r\n(ver. 27) that \"they (the Danites) came unto Laish to a people that were\r\nquiet and secure, and they smote them with the edge of the sword [the\r\nBible is filled with murder] and burned the city with fire; and they\r\nbuilt a city, (ver. 28,) and dwelt therein, and [ver. 29,] they called\r\nthe name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan, their father; howbeit\r\nthe name of the city was Laish at the first.\"\r\n\r\nThis account of the Danites taking possession of Laish and changing it\r\nto Dan, is placed in the book of Judges immediately after the death of\r\nSamson. The death of Samson is said to have happened B.C. 1120 and\r\nthat of Moses B.C. 1451; and, therefore, according to the historical\r\narrangement, the place was not called Dan till 331 years after the death\r\nof Moses.\r\n\r\nThere is a striking confusion between the historical and the\r\nchronological arrangement in the book of judges. The last five chapters,\r\nas they stand in the book, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, are put chronologically\r\nbefore all the preceding chapters; they are made to be 28 years before\r\nthe 16th chapter, 266 before the 15th, 245 before the 13th, 195 before\r\nthe 9th, go before the 4th, and 15 years before the 1st chapter. This\r\nshews the uncertain and fabulous state of the Bible. According to the\r\nchronological arrangement, the taking of Laish, and giving it the name\r\nof Dan, is made to be twenty years after the death of Joshua, who was\r\nthe successor of Moses; and by the historical order, as it stands in\r\nthe book, it is made to be 306 years after the death of Joshua, and 331\r\nafter that of Moses; but they both exclude Moses from being the writer\r\nof Genesis, because, according to either of the statements, no such a\r\nplace as Dan existed in the time of Moses; and therefore the writer of\r\nGenesis must have been some person who lived after the town of Laish had\r\nthe name of Dan; and who that person was nobody knows, and consequently\r\nthe book of Genesis is anonymous, and without authority.\r\n\r\nI come now to state another point of historical and chronological\r\nevidence, and to show therefrom, as in the preceding case, that Moses is\r\nnot the author of the book of Genesis.\r\n\r\nIn Genesis xxxvi. there is given a genealogy of the sons and descendants\r\nof Esau, who are called Edomites, and also a list by name of the kings\r\nof Edom; in enumerating of which, it is said, verse 31, \"And these are\r\nthe kings that reigned in Edom, before there reigned any king over the\r\nchildren of Israel.\"\r\n\r\nNow, were any dateless writing to be found, in which, speaking of any\r\npast events, the writer should say, these things happened before there\r\nwas any Congress in America, or before there was any Convention in\r\nFrance, it would be evidence that such writing could not have been\r\nwritten before, and could only be written after there was a Congress\r\nin America or a Convention in France, as the case might be; and,\r\nconsequently, that it could not be written by any person who died before\r\nthere was a Congress in the one country, or a Convention in the other.\r\n\r\nNothing is more frequent, as well in history as in conversation, than\r\nto refer to a fact in the room of a date: it is most natural so to do,\r\nbecause a fact fixes itself in the memory better than a date; secondly,\r\nbecause the fact includes the date, and serves to give two ideas at\r\nonce; and this manner of speaking by circumstances implies as positively\r\nthat the fact alluded to is past, as if it was so expressed. When a\r\nperson in speaking upon any matter, says, it was before I was married,\r\nor before my son was born, or before I went to America, or before I went\r\nto France, it is absolutely understood, and intended to be understood,\r\nthat he has been married, that he has had a son, that he has been in\r\nAmerica, or been in France. Language does not admit of using this mode\r\nof expression in any other sense; and whenever such an expression is\r\nfound anywhere, it can only be understood in the sense in which only it\r\ncould have been used.\r\n\r\nThe passage, therefore, that I have quoted--that \"these are the kings\r\nthat reigned in Edom, before there reigned any king over the children\r\nof Israel,\" could only have been written after the first king began to\r\nreign over them; and consequently that the book of Genesis, so far from\r\nhaving been written by Moses, could not have been written till the time\r\nof Saul at least. This is the positive sense of the passage; but the\r\nexpression, any king, implies more kings than one, at least it implies\r\ntwo, and this will carry it to the time of David; and, if taken in\r\na general sense, it carries itself through all times of the Jewish\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nHad we met with this verse in any part of the Bible that professed to\r\nhave been written after kings began to reign in Israel, it would have\r\nbeen impossible not to have seen the application of it. It happens then\r\nthat this is the case; the two books of Chronicles, which give a history\r\nof all the kings of Israel, are professedly, as well as in fact, written\r\nafter the Jewish monarchy began; and this verse that I have quoted,\r\nand all the remaining verses of Genesis xxxvi. are, word for word, In 1\r\nChronicles i., beginning at the 43d verse.\r\n\r\nIt was with consistency that the writer of the Chronicles could say as\r\nhe has said, 1 Chron. i. 43, \"These are the kings that reigned in Edom,\r\nbefore there reigned any king ever the children of Israel,\" because he\r\nwas going to give, and has given, a list of the kings that had reigned\r\nin Israel; but as it is impossible that the same expression could have\r\nbeen used before that period, it is as certain as any thing can be\r\nproved from historical language, that this part of Genesis is taken from\r\nChronicles, and that Genesis is not so old as Chronicles, and probably\r\nnot so old as the book of Homer, or as AEsop's Fables; admitting Homer\r\nto have been, as the tables of chronology state, contemporary with\r\nDavid or Solomon, and AEsop to have lived about the end of the Jewish\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nTake away from Genesis the belief that Moses was the author, on which\r\nonly the strange belief that it is the word of God has stood, and there\r\nremains nothing of Genesis but an anonymous book of stories, fables, and\r\ntraditionary or invented absurdities, or of downright lies. The story of\r\nEve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the\r\nArabian Tales, without the merit of being entertaining, and the account\r\nof men living to eight and nine hundred years becomes as fabulous as the\r\nimmortality of the giants of the Mythology.\r\n\r\nBesides, the character of Moses, as stated in the Bible, is the most\r\nhorrid that can be imagined. If those accounts be true, he was the\r\nwretch that first began and carried on wars on the score or on the\r\npretence of religion; and under that mask, or that infatuation,\r\ncommitted the most unexampled atrocities that are to be found in the\r\nhistory of any nation. Of which I will state only one instance:\r\n\r\nWhen the Jewish army returned from one of their plundering and murdering\r\nexcursions, the account goes on as follows (Numbers xxxi. 13): \"And\r\nMoses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation,\r\nwent forth to meet them without the camp; and Moses was wroth with the\r\nofficers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains\r\nover hundreds, which came from the battle; and Moses said unto them,\r\n'Have ye saved all the women alive?' behold, these caused the children\r\nof Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against\r\nthe Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the\r\ncongregation of the Lord. Now therefore, 'kill every male among the\r\nlittle ones, and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with\r\nhim; but all the women-children that have not known a man by lying with\r\nhim, keep alive for Yourselves.'\"\r\n\r\nAmong the detestable villains that in any period of the world have\r\ndisgraced the name of man, it is impossible to find a greater than\r\nMoses, if this account be true. Here is an order to butcher the boys, to\r\nmassacre the mothers, and debauch the daughters.\r\n\r\nLet any mother put herself in the situation of those mothers, one child\r\nmurdered, another destined to violation, and herself in the hands of\r\nan executioner: let any daughter put herself in the situation of\r\nthose daughters, destined as a prey to the murderers of a mother and a\r\nbrother, and what will be their feelings? It is in vain that we attempt\r\nto impose upon nature, for nature will have her course, and the religion\r\nthat tortures all her social ties is a false religion.\r\n\r\nAfter this detestable order, follows an account of the plunder taken,\r\nand the manner of dividing it; and here it is that the profaneings of\r\npriestly hypocrisy increases the catalogue of crimes. Verse 37, \"And the\r\nLord's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen;\r\nand the beeves were thirty and six thousand, of which the Lord's tribute\r\nwas threescore and twelve; and the asses were thirty thousand, of which\r\nthe Lord's tribute was threescore and one; and the persons were sixteen\r\nthousand, of which the Lord's tribute was thirty and two.\" In short, the\r\nmatters contained in this chapter, as well as in many other parts of the\r\nBible, are too horrid for humanity to read, or for decency to hear;\r\nfor it appears, from the 35th verse of this chapter, that the number\r\nof women-children consigned to debauchery by the order of Moses was\r\nthirty-two thousand.\r\n\r\nPeople in general know not what wickedness there is in this pretended\r\nword of God. Brought up in habits of superstition, they take it for\r\ngranted that the Bible is true, and that it is good; they permit\r\nthemselves not to doubt of it, and they carry the ideas they form of the\r\nbenevolence of the Almighty to the book which they have been taught to\r\nbelieve was written by his authority. Good heavens! it is quite another\r\nthing, it is a book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy; for what can be\r\ngreater blasphemy, than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders\r\nof the Almighty!\r\n\r\nBut to return to my subject, that of showing that Moses is not the\r\nauthor of the books ascribed to him, and that the Bible is spurious.\r\nThe two instances I have already given would be sufficient, without any\r\nadditional evidence, to invalidate the authenticity of any book that\r\npretended to be four or five hundred years more ancient than the matters\r\nit speaks of, refers to, them as facts; for in the case of pursuing them\r\nunto Dan, and of the kings that reigned over the children of Israel; not\r\neven the flimsy pretence of prophecy can be pleaded. The expressions are\r\nin the preter tense, and it would be downright idiotism to say that a\r\nman could prophecy in the preter tense.\r\n\r\nBut there are many other passages scattered throughout those books that\r\nunite in the same point of evidence. It is said in Exodus, (another of\r\nthe books ascribed to Moses,) xvi. 35: \"And the children of Israel did\r\neat manna until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna until\r\nthey came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the children of Israel ate manna or not, or what manna was, or\r\nwhether it was anything more than a kind of fungus or small mushroom, or\r\nother vegetable substance common to that part of the country, makes no\r\npart of my argument; all that I mean to show is, that it is not Moses\r\nthat could write this account, because the account extends itself beyond\r\nthe life time of Moses. Moses, according to the Bible, (but it is such\r\na book of lies and contradictions there is no knowing which part to\r\nbelieve, or whether any) died in the wilderness, and never came upon\r\nthe borders of 'the land of Canaan; and consequently, it could not be\r\nhe that said what the children of Israel did, or what they ate when they\r\ncame there. This account of eating manna, which they tell us was written\r\nby Moses, extends itself to the time of Joshua, the successor of\r\nMoses, as appears by the account given in the book of Joshua, after\r\nthe children of Israel had passed the river Jordan, and came into the\r\nborders of the land of Canaan. Joshua, v. 12: \"And the manna ceased on\r\nthe morrow, after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither\r\nhad the children of Israel manna any more, but they did eat of the fruit\r\nof the land of Canaan that year.\"\r\n\r\nBut a more remarkable instance than this occurs in Deuteronomy; which,\r\nwhile it shows that Moses could not be the writer of that book, shows\r\nalso the fabulous notions that prevailed at that time about giants' In\r\nDeuteronomy iii. 11, among the conquests said to be made by Moses, is\r\nan account of the taking of Og, king of Bashan: \"For only Og, king\r\nof Bashan, remained of the race of giants; behold, his bedstead was a\r\nbedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine\r\ncubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after\r\nthe cubit of a man.\" A cubit is 1 foot 9 888/1000 inches; the length\r\ntherefore of the bed was 16 feet 4 inches, and the breadth 7 feet 4\r\ninches: thus much for this giant's bed. Now for the historical part,\r\nwhich, though the evidence is not so direct and positive as in the\r\nformer cases, is nevertheless very presumable and corroborating\r\nevidence, and is better than the best evidence on the contrary side.\r\n\r\nThe writer, by way of proving the existence of this giant, refers to his\r\nbed, as an ancient relick, and says, is it not in Rabbath (or Rabbah)\r\nof the children of Ammon? meaning that it is; for such is frequently the\r\nbible method of affirming a thing. But it could not be Moses that said\r\nthis, because Moses could know nothing about Rabbah, nor of what was in\r\nit. Rabbah was not a city belonging to this giant king, nor was it one\r\nof the cities that Moses took. The knowledge therefore that this bed was\r\nat Rabbah, and of the particulars of its dimensions, must be referred to\r\nthe time when Rabbah was taken, and this was not till four hundred\r\nyears after the death of Moses; for which, see 2 Sam. xii. 26: \"And Joab\r\n[David's general] fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and\r\ntook the royal city,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAs I am not undertaking to point out all the contradictions in time,\r\nplace, and circumstance that abound in the books ascribed to Moses, and\r\nwhich prove to demonstration that those books could not be written by\r\nMoses, nor in the time of Moses, I proceed to the book of Joshua, and\r\nto shew that Joshua is not the author of that book, and that it is\r\nanonymous and without authority. The evidence I shall produce is\r\ncontained in the book itself: I will not go out of the Bible for proof\r\nagainst the supposed authenticity of the Bible. False testimony is\r\nalways good against itself.\r\n\r\nJoshua, according to Joshua i., was the immediate successor of Moses; he\r\nwas, moreover, a military man, which Moses was not; and he continued as\r\nchief of the people of Israel twenty-five years; that is, from the time\r\nthat Moses died, which, according to the Bible chronology, was B.C.\r\n1451, until B.C. 1426, when, according to the same chronology, Joshua\r\ndied. If, therefore, we find in this book, said to have been written\r\nby Joshua, references to facts done after the death of Joshua, it is\r\nevidence that Joshua could not be the author; and also that the book\r\ncould not have been written till after the time of the latest fact\r\nwhich it records. As to the character of the book, it is horrid; it is\r\na military history of rapine and murder, as savage and brutal as those\r\nrecorded of his predecessor in villainy and hypocrisy, Moses; and the\r\nblasphemy consists, as in the former books, in ascribing those deeds to\r\nthe orders of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the book of Joshua, as is the case in the preceding\r\nbooks, is written in the third person; it is the historian of Joshua\r\nthat speaks, for it would have been absurd and vainglorious that Joshua\r\nshould say of himself, as is said of him in the last verse of the sixth\r\nchapter, that \"his fame was noised throughout all the country.\"--I now\r\ncome more immediately to the proof.\r\n\r\nIn Joshua xxiv. 31, it is said \"And Israel served the Lord all the days\r\nof Joshua, and all the days of the elders that over-lived Joshua.\" Now,\r\nin the name of common sense, can it be Joshua that relates what people\r\nhad done after he was dead? This account must not only have been written\r\nby some historian that lived after Joshua, but that lived also after the\r\nelders that out-lived Joshua.\r\n\r\nThere are several passages of a general meaning with respect to time,\r\nscattered throughout the book of Joshua, that carries the time in which\r\nthe book was written to a distance from the time of Joshua, but without\r\nmarking by exclusion any particular time, as in the passage above\r\nquoted. In that passage, the time that intervened between the death\r\nof Joshua and the death of the elders is excluded descriptively and\r\nabsolutely, and the evidence substantiates that the book could not have\r\nbeen written till after the death of the last.\r\n\r\nBut though the passages to which I allude, and which I am going to\r\nquote, do not designate any particular time by exclusion, they imply a\r\ntime far more distant from the days of Joshua than is contained between\r\nthe death of Joshua and the death of the elders. Such is the passage, x.\r\n14, where, after giving an account that the sun stood still upon Gibeon,\r\nand the moon in the valley of Ajalon, at the command of Joshua, (a tale\r\nonly fit to amuse children) [NOTE: This tale of the sun standing still\r\nupon Motint Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, is one of\r\nthose fables that detects itself. Such a circumstance could not have\r\nhappened without being known all over the world. One half would have\r\nwondered why the sun did not rise, and the other why it did not set; and\r\nthe tradition of it would be universal; whereas there is not a nation\r\nin the world that knows anything about it. But why must the moon stand\r\nstill? What occasion could there be for moonlight in the daytime, and\r\nthat too whilst the sun shined? As a poetical figure, the whole is well\r\nenough; it is akin to that in the song of Deborah and Barak, The stars\r\nin their courses fought against Sisera; but it is inferior to the\r\nfigurative declaration of Mahomet to the persons who came to expostulate\r\nwith him on his goings on, Wert thou, said he, to come to me with the\r\nsun in thy right hand and the moon in thy left, it should not alter my\r\ncareer. For Joshua to have exceeded Mahomet, he should have put the sun\r\nand moon, one in each pocket, and carried them as Guy Faux carried his\r\ndark lanthorn, and taken them out to shine as he might happen to want\r\nthem. The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related that it\r\nis difficult to class them separately. One step above the sublime makes\r\nthe ridiculous, and one step above the ridiculous makes the sublime\r\nagain; the account, however, abstracted from the poetical fancy, shews\r\nthe ignorance of Joshua, for he should have commanded the earth to have\r\nstood still.--Author.] the passage says: \"And there was no day like\r\nthat, before it, nor after it, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of a\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nThe time implied by the expression after it, that is, after that day,\r\nbeing put in comparison with all the time that passed before it, must,\r\nin order to give any expressive signification to the passage, mean a\r\ngreat length of time:--for example, it would have been ridiculous to\r\nhave said so the next day, or the next week, or the next month, or the\r\nnext year; to give therefore meaning to the passage, comparative with\r\nthe wonder it relates, and the prior time it alludes to, it must mean\r\ncenturies of years; less however than one would be trifling, and less\r\nthan two would be barely admissible.\r\n\r\nA distant, but general time is also expressed in chapter viii.; where,\r\nafter giving an account of the taking the city of Ai, it is said, ver.\r\n28th, \"And Joshua burned Ai, and made it an heap for ever, a desolation\r\nunto this day;\" and again, ver. 29, where speaking of the king of Ai,\r\nwhom Joshua had hanged, and buried at the entering of the gate, it is\r\nsaid, \"And he raised thereon a great heap of stones, which remaineth\r\nunto this day,\" that is, unto the day or time in which the writer of the\r\nbook of Joshua lived. And again, in chapter x. where, after speaking of\r\nthe five kings whom Joshua had hanged on five trees, and then thrown in\r\na cave, it is said, \"And he laid great stones on the cave's mouth, which\r\nremain unto this very day.\"\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the several exploits of Joshua, and of the tribes, and\r\nof the places which they conquered or attempted, it is said, xv. 63, \"As\r\nfor the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah\r\ncould not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of\r\nJudah AT JERUSALEM unto this day.\" The question upon this passage is, At\r\nwhat time did the Jebusites and the children of Judah dwell together at\r\nJerusalem? As this matter occurs again in judges i. I shall reserve my\r\nobservations till I come to that part.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shewn from the book of Joshua itself, without any auxiliary\r\nevidence whatever, that Joshua is not the author of that book, and\r\nthat it is anonymous, and consequently without authority, I proceed, as\r\nbefore-mentioned, to the book of Judges.\r\n\r\nThe book of Judges is anonymous on the face of it; and, therefore, even\r\nthe pretence is wanting to call it the word of God; it has not so much\r\nas a nominal voucher; it is altogether fatherless.\r\n\r\nThis book begins with the same expression as the book of Joshua. That of\r\nJoshua begins, chap i. 1, Now after the death of Moses, etc., and this\r\nof the Judges begins, Now after the death of Joshua, etc. This, and the\r\nsimilarity of stile between the two books, indicate that they are the\r\nwork of the same author; but who he was, is altogether unknown; the only\r\npoint that the book proves is that the author lived long after the time\r\nof Joshua; for though it begins as if it followed immediately after his\r\ndeath, the second chapter is an epitome or abstract of the whole book,\r\nwhich, according to the Bible chronology, extends its history through a\r\nspace of 306 years; that is, from the death of Joshua, B.C. 1426 to the\r\ndeath of Samson, B.C. 1120, and only 25 years before Saul went to seek\r\nhis father's asses, and was made king. But there is good reason to\r\nbelieve, that it was not written till the time of David, at least, and\r\nthat the book of Joshua was not written before the same time.\r\n\r\nIn Judges i., the writer, after announcing the death of Joshua, proceeds\r\nto tell what happened between the children of Judah and the native\r\ninhabitants of the land of Canaan. In this statement the writer, having\r\nabruptly mentioned Jerusalem in the 7th verse, says immediately after,\r\nin the 8th verse, by way of explanation, \"Now the children of Judah had\r\nfought against Jerusalem, and taken it;\" consequently this book could\r\nnot have been written before Jerusalem had been taken. The reader will\r\nrecollect the quotation I have just before made from Joshua xv. 63,\r\nwhere it said that the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at\r\nJerusalem at this day; meaning the time when the book of Joshua was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThe evidence I have already produced to prove that the books I have\r\nhitherto treated of were not written by the persons to whom they are\r\nascribed, nor till many years after their death, if such persons ever\r\nlived, is already so abundant, that I can afford to admit this passage\r\nwith less weight than I am entitled to draw from it. For the case is,\r\nthat so far as the Bible can be credited as an history, the city of\r\nJerusalem was not taken till the time of David; and consequently, that\r\nthe book of Joshua, and of Judges, were not written till after the\r\ncommencement of the reign of David, which was 370 years after the death\r\nof Joshua.\r\n\r\nThe name of the city that was afterward called Jerusalem was originally\r\nJebus, or Jebusi, and was the capital of the Jebusites. The account of\r\nDavid's taking this city is given in 2 Samuel, v. 4, etc.; also in 1\r\nChron. xiv. 4, etc. There is no mention in any part of the Bible that it\r\nwas ever taken before, nor any account that favours such an opinion.\r\nIt is not said, either in Samuel or in Chronicles, that they \"utterly\r\ndestroyed men, women and children, that they left not a soul to\r\nbreathe,\" as is said of their other conquests; and the silence here\r\nobserved implies that it was taken by capitulation; and that the\r\nJebusites, the native inhabitants, continued to live in the place\r\nafter it was taken. The account therefore, given in Joshua, that \"the\r\nJebusites dwell with the children of Judah\" at Jerusalem at this day,\r\ncorresponds to no other time than after taking the city by David.\r\n\r\nHaving now shown that every book in the Bible, from Genesis to Judges,\r\nis without authenticity, I come to the book of Ruth, an idle, bungling\r\nstory, foolishly told, nobody knows by whom, about a strolling\r\ncountry-girl creeping slily to bed to her cousin Boaz. [The text of\r\nRuth does not imply the unpleasant sense Paine's words are likely to\r\nconvey.--Editor.] Pretty stuff indeed to be called the word of God. It\r\nis, however, one of the best books in the Bible, for it is free from\r\nmurder and rapine.\r\n\r\nI come next to the two books of Samuel, and to shew that those books\r\nwere not written by Samuel, nor till a great length of time after\r\nthe death of Samuel; and that they are, like all the former books,\r\nanonymous, and without authority.\r\n\r\nTo be convinced that these books have been written much later than the\r\ntime of Samuel, and consequently not by him, it is only necessary\r\nto read the account which the writer gives of Saul going to seek his\r\nfather's asses, and of his interview with Samuel, of whom Saul went\r\nto enquire about those lost asses, as foolish people now-a-days go to a\r\nconjuror to enquire after lost things.\r\n\r\nThe writer, in relating this story of Saul, Samuel, and the asses, does\r\nnot tell it as a thing that had just then happened, but as an ancient\r\nstory in the time this writer lived; for he tells it in the language or\r\nterms used at the time that Samuel lived, which obliges the writer to\r\nexplain the story in the terms or language used in the time the writer\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nSamuel, in the account given of him in the first of those books, chap.\r\nix. 13 called the seer; and it is by this term that Saul enquires after\r\nhim, ver. 11, \"And as they [Saul and his servant] went up the hill to\r\nthe city, they found young maidens going out to draw water; and they\r\nsaid unto them, Is the seer here?\" Saul then went according to the\r\ndirection of these maidens, and met Samuel without knowing him, and said\r\nunto him, ver. 18, \"Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is? and\r\nSamuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer.\"\r\n\r\nAs the writer of the book of Samuel relates these questions and answers,\r\nin the language or manner of speaking used in the time they are said\r\nto have been spoken, and as that manner of speaking was out of use when\r\nthis author wrote, he found it necessary, in order to make the story\r\nunderstood, to explain the terms in which these questions and\r\nanswers are spoken; and he does this in the 9th verse, where he says,\r\n\"Before-time in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he\r\nspake, Come let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a prophet,\r\nwas before-time called a seer.\" This proves, as I have before said, that\r\nthis story of Saul, Samuel, and the asses, was an ancient story at the\r\ntime the book of Samuel was written, and consequently that Samuel did\r\nnot write it, and that the book is without authenticity.\r\n\r\nBut if we go further into those books the evidence is still more\r\npositive that Samuel is not the writer of them; for they relate things\r\nthat did not happen till several years after the death of Samuel. Samuel\r\ndied before Saul; for i Samuel, xxviii. tells, that Saul and the witch\r\nof Endor conjured Samuel up after he was dead; yet the history of\r\nmatters contained in those books is extended through the remaining part\r\nof Saul's life, and to the latter end of the life of David, who succeeded\r\nSaul. The account of the death and burial of Samuel (a thing which he\r\ncould not write himself) is related in i Samuel xxv.; and the chronology\r\naffixed to this chapter makes this to be B.C. 1060; yet the history of\r\nthis first book is brought down to B.C. 1056, that is, to the death of\r\nSaul, which was not till four years after the death of Samuel.\r\n\r\nThe second book of Samuel begins with an account of things that did not\r\nhappen till four years after Samuel was dead; for it begins with the\r\nreign of David, who succeeded Saul, and it goes on to the end of David's\r\nreign, which was forty-three years after the death of Samuel; and,\r\ntherefore, the books are in themselves positive evidence that they were\r\nnot written by Samuel.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through all the books in the first part of the Bible,\r\nto which the names of persons are affixed, as being the authors of those\r\nbooks, and which the church, styling itself the Christian church, have\r\nimposed upon the world as the writings of Moses, Joshua and Samuel; and\r\nI have detected and proved the falsehood of this imposition.--And now ye\r\npriests, of every description, who have preached and written against the\r\nformer part of the 'Age of Reason,' what have ye to say? Will ye with\r\nall this mass of evidence against you, and staring you in the face,\r\nstill have the assurance to march into your pulpits, and continue to\r\nimpose these books on your congregations, as the works of inspired\r\npenmen and the word of God? when it is as evident as demonstration can\r\nmake truth appear, that the persons who ye say are the authors, are not\r\nthe authors, and that ye know not who the authors are. What shadow of\r\npretence have ye now to produce for continuing the blasphemous fraud?\r\nWhat have ye still to offer against the pure and moral religion of\r\ndeism, in support of your system of falsehood, idolatry, and pretended\r\nrevelation? Had the cruel and murdering orders, with which the Bible\r\nis filled, and the numberless torturing executions of men, women, and\r\nchildren, in consequence of those orders, been ascribed to some friend,\r\nwhose memory you revered, you would have glowed with satisfaction at\r\ndetecting the falsehood of the charge, and gloried in defending his\r\ninjured fame. It is because ye are sunk in the cruelty of superstition,\r\nor feel no interest in the honour of your Creator, that ye listen to the\r\nhorrid tales of the Bible, or hear them with callous indifference. The\r\nevidence I have produced, and shall still produce in the course of this\r\nwork, to prove that the Bible is without authority, will, whilst it\r\nwounds the stubbornness of a priest, relieve and tranquillize the minds\r\nof millions: it will free them from all those hard thoughts of the\r\nAlmighty which priestcraft and the Bible had infused into their minds,\r\nand which stood in everlasting opposition to all their ideas of his\r\nmoral justice and benevolence.\r\n\r\nI come now to the two books of Kings, and the two books of\r\nChronicles.--Those books are altogether historical, and are chiefly\r\nconfined to the lives and actions of the Jewish kings, who in general\r\nwere a parcel of rascals: but these are matters with which we have no\r\nmore concern than we have with the Roman emperors, or Homer's account of\r\nthe Trojan war. Besides which, as those books are anonymous, and as we\r\nknow nothing of the writer, or of his character, it is impossible for\r\nus to know what degree of credit to give to the matters related therein.\r\nLike all other ancient histories, they appear to be a jumble of fable\r\nand of fact, and of probable and of improbable things, but which\r\ndistance of time and place, and change of circumstances in the world,\r\nhave rendered obsolete and uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe chief use I shall make of those books will be that of comparing\r\nthem with each other, and with other parts of the Bible, to show the\r\nconfusion, contradiction, and cruelty in this pretended word of God.\r\n\r\nThe first book of Kings begins with the reign of Solomon, which,\r\naccording to the Bible chronology, was B.C. 1015; and the second\r\nbook ends B.C. 588, being a little after the reign of Zedekiah, whom\r\nNebuchadnezzar, after taking Jerusalem and conquering the Jews, carried\r\ncaptive to Babylon. The two books include a space of 427 years.\r\n\r\nThe two books of Chronicles are an history of the same times, and in\r\ngeneral of the same persons, by another author; for it would be absurd\r\nto suppose that the same author wrote the history twice over. The first\r\nbook of Chronicles (after giving the genealogy from Adam to Saul, which\r\ntakes up the first nine chapters) begins with the reign of David; and\r\nthe last book ends, as in the last book of Kings, soon, after the reign\r\nof Zedekiah, about B.C. 588. The last two verses of the last chapter\r\nbring the history 52 years more forward, that is, to 536. But these\r\nverses do not belong to the book, as I shall show when I come to speak\r\nof the book of Ezra.\r\n\r\nThe two books of Kings, besides the history of Saul, David, and Solomon,\r\nwho reigned over all Israel, contain an abstract of the lives of\r\nseventeen kings, and one queen, who are stiled kings of Judah; and\r\nof nineteen, who are stiled kings of Israel; for the Jewish nation,\r\nimmediately on the death of Solomon, split into two parties, who chose\r\nseparate kings, and who carried on most rancorous wars against each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThese two books are little more than a history of assassinations,\r\ntreachery, and wars. The cruelties that the Jews had accustomed\r\nthemselves to practise on the Canaanites, whose country they had\r\nsavagely invaded, under a pretended gift from God, they afterwards\r\npractised as furiously on each other. Scarcely half their kings died a\r\nnatural death, and in some instances whole families were destroyed\r\nto secure possession to the successor, who, after a few years, and\r\nsometimes only a few months, or less, shared the same fate. In 2 Kings\r\nx., an account is given of two baskets full of children's heads, seventy\r\nin number, being exposed at the entrance of the city; they were the\r\nchildren of Ahab, and were murdered by the orders of Jehu, whom Elisha,\r\nthe pretended man of God, had anointed to be king over Israel, on\r\npurpose to commit this bloody deed, and assassinate his predecessor. And\r\nin the account of the reign of Menahem, one of the kings of Israel who\r\nhad murdered Shallum, who had reigned but one month, it is said, 2 Kings\r\nxv. 16, that Menahem smote the city of Tiphsah, because they opened\r\nnot the city to him, and all the women therein that were with child he\r\nripped up.\r\n\r\nCould we permit ourselves to suppose that the Almighty would distinguish\r\nany nation of people by the name of his chosen people, we must suppose\r\nthat people to have been an example to all the rest of the world of\r\nthe purest piety and humanity, and not such a nation of ruffians and\r\ncut-throats as the ancient Jews were,--a people who, corrupted by and\r\ncopying after such monsters and imposters as Moses and Aaron, Joshua,\r\nSamuel, and David, had distinguished themselves above all others on the\r\nface of the known earth for barbarity and wickedness. If we will not\r\nstubbornly shut our eyes and steel our hearts it is impossible not to\r\nsee, in spite of all that long-established superstition imposes upon the\r\nmind, that the flattering appellation of his chosen people is no other\r\nthan a LIE which the priests and leaders of the Jews had invented to\r\ncover the baseness of their own characters; and which Christian priests\r\nsometimes as corrupt, and often as cruel, have professed to believe.\r\n\r\nThe two books of Chronicles are a repetition of the same crimes; but the\r\nhistory is broken in several places, by the author leaving out the reign\r\nof some of their kings; and in this, as well as in that of Kings, there\r\nis such a frequent transition from kings of Judah to kings of Israel,\r\nand from kings of Israel to kings of Judah, that the narrative\r\nis obscure in the reading. In the same book the history sometimes\r\ncontradicts itself: for example, in 2 Kings, i. 17, we are told, but in\r\nrather ambiguous terms, that after the death of Ahaziah, king of Israel,\r\nJehoram, or Joram, (who was of the house of Ahab), reigned in his stead\r\nin the second Year of Jehoram, or Joram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of\r\nJudah; and in viii. 16, of the same book, it is said, \"And in the fifth\r\nyear of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then\r\nking of Judah, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat king of judah, began to\r\nreign.\" That is, one chapter says Joram of Judah began to reign in the\r\nsecond year of Joram of Israel; and the other chapter says, that Joram\r\nof Israel began to reign in the fifth year of Joram of Judah.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the most extraordinary matters related in one history, as\r\nhaving happened during the reign of such or such of their kings, are not\r\nto be found in the other, in relating the reign of the same king: for\r\nexample, the two first rival kings, after the death of Solomon, were\r\nRehoboam and Jeroboam; and in i Kings xii. and xiii. an account is given\r\nof Jeroboam making an offering of burnt incense, and that a man, who\r\nis there called a man of God, cried out against the altar (xiii. 2): \"O\r\naltar, altar! thus saith the Lord: Behold, a child shall be born unto\r\nthe house of David, Josiah by name, and upon thee shall he offer the\r\npriests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones\r\nshall be burned upon thee.\" Verse 4: \"And it came to pass, when king\r\nJeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the\r\naltar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay\r\nhold on him; and his hand which he put out against him dried up so that\r\nhe could not pull it again to him.\"\r\n\r\nOne would think that such an extraordinary case as this, (which is\r\nspoken of as a judgement,) happening to the chief of one of the parties,\r\nand that at the first moment of the separation of the Israelites into\r\ntwo nations, would, if it,. had been true, have been recorded in both\r\nhistories. But though men, in later times, have believed all that the\r\nprophets have said unto them, it does appear that those prophets, or\r\nhistorians, disbelieved each other: they knew each other too well.\r\n\r\nA long account also is given in Kings about Elijah. It runs through\r\nseveral chapters, and concludes with telling, 2 Kings ii. 11, \"And it\r\ncame to pass, as they (Elijah and Elisha) still went on, and talked,\r\nthat, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire,\r\nand parted them both asunder, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into\r\nheaven.\" Hum! this the author of Chronicles, miraculous as the story is,\r\nmakes no mention of, though he mentions Elijah by name; neither does he\r\nsay anything of the story related in the second chapter of the same book\r\nof Kings, of a parcel of children calling Elisha bald head; and that\r\nthis man of God (ver. 24) \"turned back, and looked upon them, and cursed\r\nthem in the name of the Lord; and there came forth two she-bears out of\r\nthe wood, and tare forty and two children of them.\" He also passes over\r\nin silence the story told, 2 Kings xiii., that when they were burying a\r\nman in the sepulchre where Elisha had been buried, it happened that the\r\ndead man, as they were letting him down, (ver. 21) \"touched the bones\r\nof Elisha, and he (the dead man) revived, and stood up on his feet.\" The\r\nstory does not tell us whether they buried the man, notwithstanding he\r\nrevived and stood upon his feet, or drew him up again. Upon all these\r\nstories the writer of the Chronicles is as silent as any writer of the\r\npresent day, who did not chose to be accused of lying, or at least of\r\nromancing, would be about stories of the same kind.\r\n\r\nBut, however these two historians may differ from each other with\r\nrespect to the tales related by either, they are silent alike with\r\nrespect to those men styled prophets whose writings fill up the latter\r\npart of the Bible. Isaiah, who lived in the time of Hezekiab, is\r\nmentioned in Kings, and again in Chronicles, when these histories are\r\nspeaking of that reign; but except in one or two instances at most, and\r\nthose very slightly, none of the rest are so much as spoken of, or even\r\ntheir existence hinted at; though, according to the Bible chronology,\r\nthey lived within the time those histories were written; and some of\r\nthem long before. If those prophets, as they are called, were men of\r\nsuch importance in their day, as the compilers of the Bible, and priests\r\nand commentators have since represented them to be, how can it be\r\naccounted for that not one of those histories should say anything about\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThe history in the books of Kings and of Chronicles is brought forward,\r\nas I have already said, to the year B.C. 588; it will, therefore, be\r\nproper to examine which of these prophets lived before that period.\r\n\r\nHere follows a table of all the prophets, with the times in which they\r\nlived before Christ, according to the chronology affixed to the first\r\nchapter of each of the books of the prophets; and also of the number of\r\nyears they lived before the books of Kings and Chronicles were written:\r\n\r\nTABLE of the Prophets, with the time in which they lived before Christ,\r\nand also before the books of Kings and Chronicles were written:\r\n\r\n                      Years     Years before\r\n       NAMES.         before     Kings and     Observations.\r\n                      Christ.

First, as I have already stated, that the passage in\r\nGenesis refers itself for time to Chronicles; secondly, that the book\r\nof Chronicles, to which this passage refers itself, was not begun to be\r\nwritten until at least eight hundred and sixty years after the time of\r\nMoses. To prove this, we have only to look into 1 Chronicles iii. 15,\r\nwhere the writer, in giving the genealogy of the descendants of\r\nDavid, mentions Zedekiah; and it was in the time of Zedekiah that\r\nNebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, B.C. 588, and consequently more than\r\n860 years after Moses. Those who have superstitiously boasted of the\r\nantiquity of the Bible, and particularly of the books ascribed to Moses,\r\nhave done it without examination, and without any other authority\r\nthan that of one credulous man telling it to another: for, so far as\r\nhistorical and chronological evidence applies, the very first book in\r\nthe Bible is not so ancient as the book of Homer, by more than three\r\nhundred years, and is about the same age with AEsop's Fables.\r\n\r\nI am not contending for the morality of Homer; on the contrary, I think\r\nit a book of false glory, and tending to inspire immoral and mischievous\r\nnotions of honour; and with respect to AEsop, though the moral is in\r\ngeneral just, the fable is often cruel; and the cruelty of the fable\r\ndoes more injury to the heart, especially in a child, than the moral\r\ndoes good to the judgment.\r\n\r\nHaving now dismissed Kings and Chronicles, I come to the next in course,\r\nthe book of Ezra.\r\n\r\nAs one proof, among others I shall produce to shew the disorder in which\r\nthis pretended word of God, the Bible, has been put together, and the\r\nuncertainty of who the authors were, we have only to look at the first\r\nthree verses in Ezra, and the last two in 2 Chronicles; for by what kind\r\nof cutting and shuffling has it been that the first three verses in Ezra\r\nshould be the last two verses in 2 Chronicles, or that the last two in 2\r\nChronicles should be the first three in Ezra? Either the authors did not\r\nknow their own works or the compilers did not know the authors.\r\n\r\nLast Two Verses of 2 Chronicles.\r\n\r\nVer. 22. Now in the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, that the word\r\nof the Lord, spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, might be accomplished,\r\nthe Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, that he made\r\na proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing,\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nearth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to\r\nbuild him an house in Jerusalem which is in Judah. Who is there among\r\nyou of all his people? the Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.\r\n***\r\n\r\nFirst Three Verses of Ezra.\r\n\r\nVer. 1. Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of\r\nthe Lord, by the mouth of Jeremiah, might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred\r\nup the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, that he made a proclamation\r\nthroughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying.\r\n\r\n2. Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given\r\nme all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an\r\nhouse at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.\r\n\r\n3. Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and\r\nlet him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of\r\nthe Lord God of Israel (he is the God) which is in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n*** The last verse in Chronicles is broken abruptly, and ends in the\r\nmiddle of the phrase with the word 'up' without signifying to what\r\nplace. This abrupt break, and the appearance of the same verses in\r\ndifferent books, show as I have already said, the disorder and ignorance\r\nin which the Bible has been put together, and that the compilers of\r\nit had no authority for what they were doing, nor we any authority for\r\nbelieving what they have done. [NOTE I observed, as I passed along,\r\nseveral broken and senseless passages in the Bible, without thinking\r\nthem of consequence enough to be introduced in the body of the work;\r\nsuch as that, 1 Samuel xiii. 1, where it is said, \"Saul reigned one\r\nyear; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, Saul chose him\r\nthree thousand men,\" &c. The first part of the verse, that Saul reigned\r\none year has no sense, since it does not tell us what Saul did, nor\r\nsay any thing of what happened at the end of that one year; and it is,\r\nbesides, mere absurdity to say he reigned one year, when the very\r\nnext phrase says he had reigned two for if he had reigned two, it was\r\nimpossible not to have reigned one.\r\n\r\nAnother instance occurs in Joshua v. where the writer tells us a story\r\nof an angel (for such the table of contents at the head of the chapter\r\ncalls him) appearing unto Joshua; and the story ends abruptly, and\r\nwithout any conclusion. The story is as follows:--Ver. 13. \"And it came\r\nto pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and\r\nlooked, and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword\r\ndrawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him and said unto him, Art thou\r\nfor us, or for our adversaries?\" Verse 14, \"And he said, Nay; but as\r\ncaptain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his\r\nface to the earth, and did worship and said unto him, What saith my Lord\r\nunto his servant?\" Verse 15, \"And the captain of the Lord's host said\r\nunto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon\r\nthou standeth is holy. And Joshua did so.\"--And what then? nothing: for\r\nhere the story ends, and the chapter too.\r\n\r\nEither this story is broken off in the middle, or it is a story told\r\nby some Jewish humourist in ridicule of Joshua's pretended mission from\r\nGod, and the compilers of the Bible, not perceiving the design of\r\nthe story, have told it as a serious matter. As a story of humour and\r\nridicule it has a great deal of point; for it pompously introduces an\r\nangel in the figure of a man, with a drawn sword in his hand, before\r\nwhom Joshua falls on his face to the earth, and worships (which is\r\ncontrary to their second commandment;) and then, this most important\r\nembassy from heaven ends in telling Joshua to pull off his shoe. It\r\nmight as well have told him to pull up his breeches.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that the Jews did not credit every thing their\r\nleaders told them, as appears from the cavalier manner in which they\r\nspeak of Moses, when he was gone into the mount. As for this Moses, say\r\nthey, we wot not what is become of him. Exod. xxxii. 1.--Author.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that has any appearance of certainty in the book of Ezra\r\nis the time in which it was written, which was immediately after the\r\nreturn of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity, about B.C. 536. Ezra\r\n(who, according to the Jewish commentators, is the same person as is\r\ncalled Esdras in the Apocrypha) was one of the persons who returned, and\r\nwho, it is probable, wrote the account of that affair. Nebemiah, whose\r\nbook follows next to Ezra, was another of the returned persons; and who,\r\nit is also probable, wrote the account of the same affair, in the book\r\nthat bears his name. But those accounts are nothing to us, nor to any\r\nother person, unless it be to the Jews, as a part of the history of\r\ntheir nation; and there is just as much of the word of God in those\r\nbooks as there is in any of the histories of France, or Rapin's history\r\nof England, or the history of any other country.\r\n\r\nBut even in matters of historical record, neither of those writers are\r\nto be depended upon. In Ezra ii., the writer gives a list of the tribes\r\nand families, and of the precise number of souls of each, that returned\r\nfrom Babylon to Jerusalem; and this enrolment of the persons so returned\r\nappears to have been one of the principal objects for writing the\r\nbook; but in this there is an error that destroys the intention of the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nThe writer begins his enrolment in the following manner (ii. 3): \"The\r\nchildren of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy and four.\" Ver. 4,\r\n\"The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.\" And in this\r\nmanner he proceeds through all the families; and in the 64th verse, he\r\nmakes a total, and says, the whole congregation together was forty and\r\ntwo thousand three hundred and threescore.\r\n\r\nBut whoever will take the trouble of casting up the several particulars,\r\nwill find that the total is but 29,818; so that the error is 12,542.\r\nWhat certainty then can there be in the Bible for any thing?\r\n\r\n[Here Mr. Paine includes the long list of numbers from the Bible of all\r\nthe children listed and the total thereof. This can be had directly from\r\nthe Bible.]\r\n\r\nNehemiah, in like manner, gives a list of the returned families, and\r\nof the number of each family. He begins as in Ezra, by saying (vii. 8):\r\n\"The children of Parosh, two thousand three hundred and seventy-two;\"\r\nand so on through all the families. (The list differs in several of the\r\nparticulars from that of Ezra.) In ver. 66, Nehemiah makes a total, and\r\nsays, as Ezra had said, \"The whole congregation together was forty and\r\ntwo thousand three hundred and threescore.\" But the particulars of this\r\nlist make a total but of 31,089, so that the error here is 11,271. These\r\nwriters may do well enough for Bible-makers, but not for any thing where\r\ntruth and exactness is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe next book in course is the book of Esther. If Madam Esther thought\r\nit any honour to offer herself as a kept mistress to Ahasuerus, or as a\r\nrival to Queen Vashti, who had refused to come to a drunken king in the\r\nmidst of a drunken company, to be made a show of, (for the account\r\nsays, they had been drinking seven days, and were merry,) let Esther and\r\nMordecai look to that, it is no business of ours, at least it is none of\r\nmine; besides which, the story has a great deal the appearance of being\r\nfabulous, and is also anonymous. I pass on to the book of Job.\r\n\r\nThe book of Job differs in character from all the books we have hitherto\r\npassed over. Treachery and murder make no part of this book; it is the\r\nmeditations of a mind strongly impressed with the vicissitudes of human\r\nlife, and by turns sinking under, and struggling against the pressure.\r\nIt is a highly wrought composition, between willing submission and\r\ninvoluntary discontent; and shows man, as he sometimes is, more disposed\r\nto be resigned than he is capable of being. Patience has but a small\r\nshare in the character of the person of whom the book treats; on the\r\ncontrary, his grief is often impetuous; but he still endeavours to keep\r\na guard upon it, and seems determined, in the midst of accumulating\r\nills, to impose upon himself the hard duty of contentment.\r\n\r\nI have spoken in a respectful manner of the book of Job in the former\r\npart of the 'Age of Reason,' but without knowing at that time what I\r\nhave learned since; which is, that from all the evidence that can be\r\ncollected, the book of Job does not belong to the Bible.\r\n\r\nI have seen the opinion of two Hebrew commentators, Abenezra and\r\nSpinoza, upon this subject; they both say that the book of Job carries\r\nno internal evidence of being an Hebrew book; that the genius of the\r\ncomposition, and the drama of the piece, are not Hebrew; that it has\r\nbeen translated from another language into Hebrew, and that the author\r\nof the book was a Gentile; that the character represented under the name\r\nof Satan (which is the first and only time this name is mentioned in\r\nthe Bible) [In a later work Paine notes that in \"the Bible\" (by which\r\nhe always means the Old Testament alone) the word Satan occurs also in 1\r\nChron. xxi. 1, and remarks that the action there ascribed to Satan is\r\nin 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, attributed to Jehovah (\"Essay on Dreams\"). In these\r\nplaces, however, and in Ps. cix. 6, Satan means \"adversary,\" and is so\r\ntranslated (A.S. version) in 2 Sam. xix. 22, and 1 Kings v. 4, xi. 25.\r\nAs a proper name, with the article, Satan appears in the Old Testament\r\nonly in Job and in Zech. iii. 1, 2. But the authenticity of the passage\r\nin Zechariah has been questioned, and it may be that in finding the\r\nproper name of Satan in Job alone, Paine was following some opinion\r\nmet with in one of the authorities whose comments are condensed in his\r\nparagraph.--Editor.] does not correspond to any Hebrew idea; and that\r\nthe two convocations which the Deity is supposed to have made of those\r\nwhom the poem calls sons of God, and the familiarity which this supposed\r\nSatan is stated to have with the Deity, are in the same case.\r\n\r\nIt may also be observed, that the book shows itself to be the production\r\nof a mind cultivated in science, which the Jews, so far from being\r\nfamous for, were very ignorant of. The allusions to objects of natural\r\nphilosophy are frequent and strong, and are of a different cast to any\r\nthing in the books known to be Hebrew. The astronomical names, Pleiades,\r\nOrion, and Arcturus, are Greek and not Hebrew names, and it does not\r\nappear from any thing that is to be found in the Bible that the Jews\r\nknew any thing of astronomy, or that they studied it, they had no\r\ntranslation of those names into their own language, but adopted the\r\nnames as they found them in the poem. [Paine's Jewish critic, David\r\nLevi, fastened on this slip (\"Defence of the Old Testament,\" 1797, p.\r\n152). In the original the names are Ash (Arcturus), Kesil' (Orion),\r\nKimah' (Pleiades), though the identifications of the constellations in\r\nthe A.S.V. have been questioned.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nThat the Jews did translate the literary productions of the Gentile\r\nnations into the Hebrew language, and mix them with their own, is not a\r\nmatter of doubt; Proverbs xxxi. i, is an evidence of this: it is there\r\nsaid, The word of king Lemuel, the prophecy which his mother taught him.\r\nThis verse stands as a preface to the proverbs that follow, and which\r\nare not the proverbs of Solomon, but of Lemuel; and this Lemuel was not\r\none of the kings of Israel, nor of Judah, but of some other country, and\r\nconsequently a Gentile. The Jews however have adopted his proverbs; and\r\nas they cannot give any account who the author of the book of Job was,\r\nnor how they came by the book, and as it differs in character from the\r\nHebrew writings, and stands totally unconnected with every other\r\nbook and chapter in the Bible before it and after it, it has all the\r\ncircumstantial evidence of being originally a book of the Gentiles.\r\n[The prayer known by the name of Agur's Prayer, in Proverbs\r\nxxx.,--immediately preceding the proverbs of Lemuel,--and which is the\r\nonly sensible, well-conceived, and well-expressed prayer in the Bible,\r\nhas much the appearance of being a prayer taken from the Gentiles.\r\nThe name of Agur occurs on no other occasion than this; and he is\r\nintroduced, together with the prayer ascribed to him, in the same\r\nmanner, and nearly in the same words, that Lemuel and his proverbs are\r\nintroduced in the chapter that follows. The first verse says, \"The words\r\nof Agur, the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy:\" here the word prophecy\r\nis used with the same application it has in the following chapter of\r\nLemuel, unconnected with anything of prediction. The prayer of Agur is\r\nin the 8th and 9th verses, \"Remove far from me vanity and lies; give\r\nme neither riches nor poverty, but feed me with food convenient for me;\r\nlest I be full and deny thee and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor\r\nand steal, and take the name of my God in vain.\" This has not any of the\r\nmarks of being a Jewish prayer, for the Jews never prayed but when\r\nthey were in trouble, and never for anything but victory, vengeance,\r\nor riches.--Author. (Prov. xxx. 1, and xxxi. 1) the word \"prophecy\" in\r\nthese verses is translated \"oracle\" or \"burden\" (marg.) in the revised\r\nversion.--The prayer of Agur was quoted by Paine in his plea for the\r\nofficers of Excise, 1772.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nThe Bible-makers, and those regulators of time, the Bible chronologists,\r\nappear to have been at a loss where to place and how to dispose of\r\nthe book of Job; for it contains no one historical circumstance, nor\r\nallusion to any, that might serve to determine its place in the Bible.\r\nBut it would not have answered the purpose of these men to have informed\r\nthe world of their ignorance; and, therefore, they have affixed it to\r\nthe aera of B.C. 1520, which is during the time the Israelites were in\r\nEgypt, and for which they have just as much authority and no more than\r\nI should have for saying it was a thousand years before that period. The\r\nprobability however is, that it is older than any book in the Bible; and\r\nit is the only one that can be read without indignation or disgust.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of what the ancient Gentile world (as it is called) was\r\nbefore the time of the Jews, whose practice has been to calumniate and\r\nblacken the character of all other nations; and it is from the Jewish\r\naccounts that we have learned to call them heathens. But, as far as\r\nwe know to the contrary, they were a just and moral people, and not\r\naddicted, like the Jews, to cruelty and revenge, but of whose profession\r\nof faith we are unacquainted. It appears to have been their custom\r\nto personify both virtue and vice by statues and images, as is done\r\nnow-a-days both by statuary and by painting; but it does not follow from\r\nthis that they worshipped them any more than we do.--I pass on to the\r\nbook of,\r\n\r\nPsalms, of which it is not necessary to make much observation. Some of\r\nthem are moral, and others are very revengeful; and the greater part\r\nrelates to certain local circumstances of the Jewish nation at the time\r\nthey were written, with which we have nothing to do. It is, however,\r\nan error or an imposition to call them the Psalms of David; they are a\r\ncollection, as song-books are now-a-days, from different song-writers,\r\nwho lived at different times. The 137th Psalm could not have been\r\nwritten till more than 400 years after the time of David, because it\r\nis written in commemoration of an event, the captivity of the Jews in\r\nBabylon, which did not happen till that distance of time. \"By the rivers\r\nof Babylon we sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged\r\nour harps upon the willows, in the midst thereof; for there they that\r\ncarried us away captive required of us a song, saying, sing us one\r\nof the songs of Zion.\" As a man would say to an American, or to a\r\nFrenchman, or to an Englishman, sing us one of your American songs, or\r\nyour French songs, or your English songs. This remark, with respect to\r\nthe time this psalm was written, is of no other use than to show (among\r\nothers already mentioned) the general imposition the world has been\r\nunder with respect to the authors of the Bible. No regard has been paid\r\nto time, place, and circumstance; and the names of persons have been\r\naffixed to the several books which it was as impossible they should\r\nwrite, as that a man should walk in procession at his own funeral.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Proverbs. These, like the Psalms, are a collection, and that\r\nfrom authors belonging to other nations than those of the Jewish nation,\r\nas I have shewn in the observations upon the book of Job; besides which,\r\nsome of the Proverbs ascribed to Solomon did not appear till two hundred\r\nand fifty years after the death of Solomon; for it is said in xxv. i,\r\n\"These are also proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah, king of\r\nJudah, copied out.\" It was two hundred and fifty years from the time of\r\nSolomon to the time of Hezekiah. When a man is famous and his name is\r\nabroad he is made the putative father of things he never said or did;\r\nand this, most probably, has been the case with Solomon. It appears to\r\nhave been the fashion of that day to make proverbs, as it is now to\r\nmake jest-books, and father them upon those who never saw them. [A \"Tom\r\nPaine's Jest Book\" had appeared in London with little or nothing of\r\nPaine in it.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nThe book of Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher, is also ascribed to Solomon,\r\nand that with much reason, if not with truth. It is written as the\r\nsolitary reflections of a worn-out debauchee, such as Solomon was, who\r\nlooking back on scenes he can no longer enjoy, cries out All is Vanity!\r\nA great deal of the metaphor and of the sentiment is obscure, most\r\nprobably by translation; but enough is left to show they were strongly\r\npointed in the original. [Those that look out of the window shall\r\nbe darkened, is an obscure figure in translation for loss of\r\nsight.--Author.] From what is transmitted to us of the character of\r\nSolomon, he was witty, ostentatious, dissolute, and at last melancholy.\r\nHe lived fast, and died, tired of the world, at the age of fifty-eight\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred wives, and three hundred concubines, are worse than\r\nnone; and, however it may carry with it the appearance of heightened\r\nenjoyment, it defeats all the felicity of affection, by leaving it no\r\npoint to fix upon; divided love is never happy. This was the case\r\nwith Solomon; and if he could not, with all his pretensions to wisdom,\r\ndiscover it beforehand, he merited, unpitied, the mortification he\r\nafterwards endured. In this point of view, his preaching is unnecessary,\r\nbecause, to know the consequences, it is only necessary to know the\r\ncause. Seven hundred wives, and three hundred concubines would have\r\nstood in place of the whole book. It was needless after this to say that\r\nall was vanity and vexation of spirit; for it is impossible to derive\r\nhappiness from the company of those whom we deprive of happiness.\r\n\r\nTo be happy in old age it is necessary that we accustom ourselves to\r\nobjects that can accompany the mind all the way through life, and that\r\nwe take the rest as good in their day. The mere man of pleasure is\r\nmiserable in old age; and the mere drudge in business is but little\r\nbetter: whereas, natural philosophy, mathematical and mechanical\r\nscience, are a continual source of tranquil pleasure, and in spite of\r\nthe gloomy dogmas of priests, and of superstition, the study of those\r\nthings is the study of the true theology; it teaches man to know and to\r\nadmire the Creator, for the principles of science are in the creation,\r\nand are unchangeable, and of divine origin.\r\n\r\nThose who knew Benjamin Franklin will recollect, that his mind was\r\never young; his temper ever serene; science, that never grows grey, was\r\nalways his mistress. He was never without an object; for when we cease\r\nto have an object we become like an invalid in an hospital waiting for\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSolomon's Songs, amorous and foolish enough, but which wrinkled\r\nfanaticism has called divine.--The compilers of the Bible have placed\r\nthese songs after the book of Ecclesiastes; and the chronologists have\r\naffixed to them the aera of B.C. 1014, at which time Solomon, according\r\nto the same chronology, was nineteen years of age, and was then\r\nforming his seraglio of wives and concubines. The Bible-makers and\r\nthe chronologists should have managed this matter a little better,\r\nand either have said nothing about the time, or chosen a time less\r\ninconsistent with the supposed divinity of those songs; for Solomon was\r\nthen in the honey-moon of one thousand debaucheries.\r\n\r\nIt should also have occurred to them, that as he wrote, if he did\r\nwrite, the book of Ecclesiastes, long after these songs, and in which\r\nhe exclaims that all is vanity and vexation of spirit, that he included\r\nthose songs in that description. This is the more probable, because he\r\nsays, or somebody for him, Ecclesiastes ii. 8, I got me men-singers,\r\nand women-singers [most probably to sing those songs], and musical\r\ninstruments of all sorts; and behold (Ver. ii), \"all was vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit.\" The compilers however have done their work but by\r\nhalves; for as they have given us the songs they should have given us\r\nthe tunes, that we might sing them.\r\n\r\nThe books called the books of the Prophets fill up all the remaining\r\npart of the Bible; they are sixteen in number, beginning with Isaiah and\r\nending with Malachi, of which I have given a list in the observations\r\nupon Chronicles. Of these sixteen prophets, all of whom except the\r\nlast three lived within the time the books of Kings and Chronicles were\r\nwritten, two only, Isaiah and Jeremiah, are mentioned in the history of\r\nthose books. I shall begin with those two, reserving, what I have to say\r\non the general character of the men called prophets to another part of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nWhoever will take the trouble of reading the book ascribed to Isaiah,\r\nwill find it one of the most wild and disorderly compositions ever put\r\ntogether; it has neither beginning, middle, nor end; and, except a short\r\nhistorical part, and a few sketches of history in the first two or\r\nthree chapters, is one continued incoherent, bombastical rant, full of\r\nextravagant metaphor, without application, and destitute of meaning; a\r\nschool-boy would scarcely have been excusable for writing such stuff;\r\nit is (at least in translation) that kind of composition and false taste\r\nthat is properly called prose run mad.\r\n\r\nThe historical part begins at chapter xxxvi., and is continued to the\r\nend of chapter xxxix. It relates some matters that are said to have\r\npassed during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, at which time Isaiah\r\nlived. This fragment of history begins and ends abruptly; it has not the\r\nleast connection with the chapter that precedes it, nor with that which\r\nfollows it, nor with any other in the book. It is probable that\r\nIsaiah wrote this fragment himself, because he was an actor in the\r\ncircumstances it treats of; but except this part there are scarcely two\r\nchapters that have any connection with each other. One is entitled, at\r\nthe beginning of the first verse, the burden of Babylon; another, the\r\nburden of Moab; another, the burden of Damascus; another, the burden of\r\nEgypt; another, the burden of the Desert of the Sea; another, the burden\r\nof the Valley of Vision: as you would say the story of the Knight of the\r\nBurning Mountain, the story of Cinderella, or the glassen slipper, the\r\nstory of the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already shown, in the instance of the last two verses of 2\r\nChronicles, and the first three in Ezra, that the compilers of the Bible\r\nmixed and confounded the writings of different authors with each other;\r\nwhich alone, were there no other cause, is sufficient to destroy the\r\nauthenticity of an compilation, because it is more than presumptive\r\nevidence that the compilers are ignorant who the authors were. A very\r\nglaring instance of this occurs in the book ascribed to Isaiah: the\r\nlatter part of the 44th chapter, and the beginning of the 45th, so far\r\nfrom having been written by Isaiah, could only have been written by some\r\nperson who lived at least an hundred and fifty years after Isaiah was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThese chapters are a compliment to Cyrus, who permitted the Jews to\r\nreturn to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity, to rebuild Jerusalem\r\nand the temple, as is stated in Ezra. The last verse of the 44th\r\nchapter, and the beginning of the 45th [Isaiah] are in the following\r\nwords: \"That saith of Cyrus, he is my shepherd, and shall perform all\r\nmy pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, thou shalt be built; and to\r\nthe temple thy foundations shall be laid: thus saith the Lord to his\r\nenointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations\r\nbefore him, and I will loose the loins of kings to open before him the\r\ntwo-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be shut; I will go before\r\nthee,\" etc.\r\n\r\nWhat audacity of church and priestly ignorance it is to impose this book\r\nupon the world as the writing of Isaiah, when Isaiah, according to their\r\nown chronology, died soon after the death of Hezekiah, which was\r\nB.C. 698; and the decree of Cyrus, in favour of the Jews returning to\r\nJerusalem, was, according to the same chronology, B.C. 536; which is a\r\ndistance of time between the two of 162 years. I do not suppose that the\r\ncompilers of the Bible made these books, but rather that they picked up\r\nsome loose, anonymous essays, and put them together under the names\r\nof such authors as best suited their purpose. They have encouraged the\r\nimposition, which is next to inventing it; for it was impossible but\r\nthey must have observed it.\r\n\r\nWhen we see the studied craft of the scripture-makers, in making\r\nevery part of this romantic book of school-boy's eloquence bend to the\r\nmonstrous idea of a Son of God, begotten by a ghost on the body of a\r\nvirgin, there is no imposition we are not justified in suspecting them\r\nof. Every phrase and circumstance are marked with the barbarous hand of\r\nsuperstitious torture, and forced into meanings it was impossible they\r\ncould have. The head of every chapter, and the top of every page, are\r\nblazoned with the names of Christ and the Church, that the unwary reader\r\nmight suck in the error before he began to read.\r\n\r\nBehold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son (Isa. vii. I4), has been\r\ninterpreted to mean the person called Jesus Christ, and his mother Mary,\r\nand has been echoed through christendom for more than a thousand years;\r\nand such has been the rage of this opinion, that scarcely a spot in\r\nit but has been stained with blood and marked with desolation in\r\nconsequence of it. Though it is not my intention to enter into\r\ncontroversy on subjects of this kind, but to confine myself to show\r\nthat the Bible is spurious,--and thus, by taking away the foundation, to\r\noverthrow at once the whole structure of superstition raised thereon,--I\r\nwill however stop a moment to expose the fallacious application of this\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nWhether Isaiah was playing a trick with Ahaz, king of Judah, to whom\r\nthis passage is spoken, is no business of mine; I mean only to show\r\nthe misapplication of the passage, and that it has no more reference\r\nto Christ and his mother, than it has to me and my mother. The story is\r\nsimply this:\r\n\r\nThe king of Syria and the king of Israel (I have already mentioned that\r\nthe Jews were split into two nations, one of which was called Judah, the\r\ncapital of which was Jerusalem, and the other Israel) made war jointly\r\nagainst Ahaz, king of Judah, and marched their armies towards Jerusalem.\r\nAhaz and his people became alarmed, and the account says (Is. vii. 2),\r\nTheir hearts were moved as the trees of the wood are moved with the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of things, Isaiah addresses himself to Ahaz, and\r\nassures him in the name of the Lord (the cant phrase of all the\r\nprophets) that these two kings should not succeed against him; and to\r\nsatisfy Ahaz that this should be the case, tells him to ask a sign.\r\nThis, the account says, Ahaz declined doing; giving as a reason that he\r\nwould not tempt the Lord; upon which Isaiah, who is the speaker, says,\r\nver. 14, \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold a\r\nvirgin shall conceive and bear a son;\" and the 16th verse says, \"And\r\nbefore this child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good,\r\nthe land which thou abhorrest or dreadest [meaning Syria and the kingdom\r\nof Israel] shall be forsaken of both her kings.\" Here then was the sign,\r\nand the time limited for the completion of the assurance or promise;\r\nnamely, before this child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIsaiah having committed himself thus far, it became necessary to him,\r\nin order to avoid the imputation of being a false prophet, and the\r\nconsequences thereof, to take measures to make this sign appear. It\r\ncertainly was not a difficult thing, in any time of the world, to find\r\na girl with child, or to make her so; and perhaps Isaiah knew of one\r\nbeforehand; for I do not suppose that the prophets of that day were any\r\nmore to be trusted than the priests of this: be that, however, as it\r\nmay, he says in the next chapter, ver. 2, \"And I took unto me faithful\r\nwitnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of\r\nJeberechiah, and I went unto the prophetess, and she conceived and bare\r\na son.\"\r\n\r\nHere then is the whole story, foolish as it is, of this child and this\r\nvirgin; and it is upon the barefaced perversion of this story that the\r\nbook of Matthew, and the impudence and sordid interest of priests in\r\nlater times, have founded a theory, which they call the gospel; and\r\nhave applied this story to signify the person they call Jesus Christ;\r\nbegotten, they say, by a ghost, whom they call holy, on the body of\r\na woman engaged in marriage, and afterwards married, whom they call a\r\nvirgin, seven hundred years after this foolish story was told; a theory\r\nwhich, speaking for myself, I hesitate not to believe, and to say, is as\r\nfabulous and as false as God is true. [In Is. vii. 14, it is said that\r\nthe child should be called Immanuel; but this name was not given to\r\neither of the children, otherwise than as a character, which the word\r\nsignifies. That of the prophetess was called Maher-shalalhash-baz, and\r\nthat of Mary was called Jesus.--Author.]\r\n\r\nBut to show the imposition and falsehood of Isaiah we have only to\r\nattend to the sequel of this story; which, though it is passed over in\r\nsilence in the book of Isaiah, is related in 2 Chronicles, xxviii;\r\nand which is, that instead of these two kings failing in their attempt\r\nagainst Ahaz, king of Judah, as Isaiah had pretended to foretel in the\r\nname of the Lord, they succeeded: Ahaz was defeated and destroyed; an\r\nhundred and twenty thousand of his people were slaughtered; Jerusalem\r\nwas plundered, and two hundred thousand women and sons and daughters\r\ncarried into captivity. Thus much for this lying prophet and imposter\r\nIsaiah, and the book of falsehoods that bears his name. I pass on to the\r\nbook of Jeremiah. This prophet, as he is called, lived in the time that\r\nNebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, in the reign of Zedekiah, the last\r\nking of Judah; and the suspicion was strong against him that he was\r\na traitor in the interest of Nebuchadnezzar. Every thing relating to\r\nJeremiah shows him to have been a man of an equivocal character: in\r\nhis metaphor of the potter and the clay, (ch. xviii.) he guards his\r\nprognostications in such a crafty manner as always to leave himself a\r\ndoor to escape by, in case the event should be contrary to what he had\r\npredicted. In the 7th and 8th verses he makes the Almighty to say,\r\n\"At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a\r\nkingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and destroy it, if that nation,\r\nagainst whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent me\r\nof the evil that I thought to do unto them.\" Here was a proviso against\r\none side of the case: now for the other side. Verses 9 and 10, \"At what\r\ninstant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to\r\nbuild and to plant it, if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not\r\nmy voice, then I will repent me of the good wherewith I said I would\r\nbenefit them.\" Here is a proviso against the other side; and, according\r\nto this plan of prophesying, a prophet could never be wrong, however\r\nmistaken the Almighty might be. This sort of absurd subterfuge, and\r\nthis manner of speaking of the Almighty, as one would speak of a man, is\r\nconsistent with nothing but the stupidity of the Bible.\r\n\r\nAs to the authenticity of the book, it is only necessary to read it in\r\norder to decide positively that, though some passages recorded therein\r\nmay have been spoken by Jeremiah, he is not the author of the book. The\r\nhistorical parts, if they can be called by that name, are in the most\r\nconfused condition; the same events are several times repeated, and that\r\nin a manner different, and sometimes in contradiction to each other;\r\nand this disorder runs even to the last chapter, where the history, upon\r\nwhich the greater part of the book has been employed, begins anew, and\r\nends abruptly. The book has all the appearance of being a medley of\r\nunconnected anecdotes respecting persons and things of that time,\r\ncollected together in the same rude manner as if the various and\r\ncontradictory accounts that are to be found in a bundle of newspapers,\r\nrespecting persons and things of the present day, were put together\r\nwithout date, order, or explanation. I will give two or three examples\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the account of chapter xxxvii. that the army of\r\nNebuchadnezzer, which is called the army of the Chaldeans, had besieged\r\nJerusalem some time; and on their hearing that the army of Pharaoh of\r\nEgypt was marching against them, they raised the siege and retreated for\r\na time. It may here be proper to mention, in order to understand this\r\nconfused history, that Nebuchadnezzar had besieged and taken Jerusalem\r\nduring the reign of Jehoakim, the redecessor of Zedekiah; and that it\r\nwas Nebuchadnezzar who had make Zedekiah king, or rather viceroy; and\r\nthat this second siege, of which the book of Jeremiah treats, was in\r\nconsequence of the revolt of Zedekiah against Nebuchadnezzar. This\r\nwill in some measure account for the suspicion that affixes\r\nitself to Jeremiah of being a traitor, and in the interest of\r\nNebuchadnezzar,--whom Jeremiah calls, xliii. 10, the servant of God.\r\n\r\nChapter xxxvii. 11-13, says, \"And it came to pass, that, when the army\r\nof the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem, for fear of Pharaoh's\r\narmy, that Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem, to go (as this account\r\nstates) into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the\r\nmidst of the people; and when he was in the gate of Benjamin a captain\r\nof the ward was there, whose name was Irijah... and he took Jeremiah the\r\nprophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans; then Jeremiah said,\r\nIt is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans.\" Jeremiah being thus\r\nstopt and accused, was, after being examined, committed to prison, on\r\nsuspicion of being a traitor, where he remained, as is stated in the\r\nlast verse of this chapter.\r\n\r\nBut the next chapter gives an account of the imprisonment of Jeremiah,\r\nwhich has no connection with this account, but ascribes his imprisonment\r\nto another circumstance, and for which we must go back to chapter\r\nxxi. It is there stated, ver. 1, that Zedekiah sent Pashur the son of\r\nMalchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, to Jeremiah,\r\nto enquire of him concerning Nebuchadnezzar, whose army was then before\r\nJerusalem; and Jeremiah said to them, ver. 8, \"Thus saith the Lord,\r\nBehold I set before you the way of life, and the way of death; he that\r\nabideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine, and by\r\nthe pestilence; but he that goeth out and falleth to the Chaldeans that\r\nbesiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.\"\r\n\r\nThis interview and conference breaks off abruptly at the end of the 10th\r\nverse of chapter xxi.; and such is the disorder of this book that we\r\nhave to pass over sixteen chapters upon various subjects, in order to\r\ncome at the continuation and event of this conference; and this brings\r\nus to the first verse of chapter xxxviii., as I have just mentioned. The\r\nchapter opens with saying, \"Then Shaphatiah, the son of Mattan, Gedaliah\r\nthe son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of\r\nMalchiah, (here are more persons mentioned than in chapter xxi.) heard\r\nthe words that Jeremiah spoke unto all the people, saying, Thus saith\r\nthe Lord, He that remaineth in this city, shall die by the sword, by\r\nfamine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans\r\nshall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live\";\r\n[which are the words of the conference;] therefore, (say they to\r\nZedekiah,) \"We beseech thee, let this man be put to death, for thus he\r\nweakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the\r\nhands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them; for this man\r\nseeketh not the welfare of the people, but the hurt:\" and at the 6th\r\nverse it is said, \"Then they took Jeremiah, and put him into the dungeon\r\nof Malchiah.\"\r\n\r\nThese two accounts are different and contradictory. The one ascribes his\r\nimprisonment to his attempt to escape out of the city; the other to his\r\npreaching and prophesying in the city; the one to his being seized by\r\nthe guard at the gate; the other to his being accused before Zedekiah\r\nby the conferees. [I observed two chapters in I Samuel (xvi. and xvii.)\r\nthat contradict each other with respect to David, and the manner he\r\nbecame acquainted with Saul; as Jeremiah xxxvii. and xxxviii. contradict\r\neach other with respect to the cause of Jeremiah's imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIn 1 Samuel, xvi., it is said, that an evil spirit of God troubled Saul,\r\nand that his servants advised him (as a remedy) \"to seek out a man who\r\nwas a cunning player upon the harp.\" And Saul said, ver. 17, \"Provide me\r\nnow a man that can play well, and bring him to me. Then answered one\r\nof his servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse, the\r\nBethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty man, and a man of\r\nwar, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with\r\nhim; wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David,\r\nthy son. And (verse 21) David came to Saul, and stood before him, and\r\nhe loved him greatly, and he became his armour-bearer; and when the\r\nevil spirit from God was upon Saul, (verse 23) David took his harp, and\r\nplayed with his hand, and Saul was refreshed, and was well.\"\r\n\r\nBut the next chapter (xvii.) gives an account, all different to this, of\r\nthe manner that Saul and David became acquainted. Here it is ascribed\r\nto David's encounter with Goliah, when David was sent by his father to\r\ncarry provision to his brethren in the camp. In the 55th verse of\r\nthis chapter it is said, \"And when Saul saw David go forth against the\r\nPhilistine (Goliah) he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner,\r\nwhose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, 0 king, I\r\ncannot tell. And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.\r\nAnd as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took\r\nhim and brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his\r\nhand; and Saul said unto him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And\r\nDavid answered, I am the son of thy servant, Jesse, the Betblehemite,\"\r\nThese two accounts belie each other, because each of them supposes Saul\r\nand David not to have known each other before. This book, the Bible, is\r\ntoo ridiculous for criticism.--Author.]\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter (Jer. xxxix.) we have another instance of the\r\ndisordered state of this book; for notwithstanding the siege of the\r\ncity by Nebuchadnezzar has been the subject of several of the preceding\r\nchapters, particularly xxxvii. and xxxviii., chapter xxxix. begins as\r\nif not a word had been said upon the subject, and as if the reader was\r\nstill to be informed of every particular respecting it; for it begins\r\nwith saying, ver. 1, \"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in\r\nthe tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army,\r\nagainst Jerusalem, and besieged it,\" etc.\r\n\r\nBut the instance in the last chapter (lii.) is still more glaring; for\r\nthough the story has been told over and over again, this chapter still\r\nsupposes the reader not to know anything of it, for it begins by saying,\r\nver. i, \"Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,\r\nand he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was\r\nHamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\" (Ver. 4,) \"And it came\r\nto pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, that\r\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against\r\nJerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible that any one man, and more particularly Jeremiah,\r\ncould have been the writer of this book. The errors are such as could\r\nnot have been committed by any person sitting down to compose a work.\r\nWere I, or any other man, to write in such a disordered manner, no\r\nbody would read what was written, and every body would suppose that the\r\nwriter was in a state of insanity. The only way, therefore, to\r\naccount for the disorder is, that the book is a medley of detached\r\nunauthenticated anecdotes, put together by some stupid book-maker, under\r\nthe name of Jeremiah; because many of them refer to him, and to the\r\ncircumstances of the times he lived in.\r\n\r\nOf the duplicity, and of the false predictions of Jeremiah, I shall\r\nmention two instances, and then proceed to review the remainder of the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nIt appears from chapter xxxviii. that when Jeremiah was in prison,\r\nZedekiah sent for him, and at this interview, which was private,\r\nJeremiah pressed it strongly on Zedekiah to surrender himself to the\r\nenemy. \"If,\" says he, (ver. 17,) \"thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the\r\nking of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live,\" etc. Zedekiah was\r\napprehensive that what passed at this conference should be known; and\r\nhe said to Jeremiah, (ver. 25,) \"If the princes [meaning those of Judah]\r\nhear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto\r\nthee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not\r\nfrom us, and we will not put thee to death; and also what the king said\r\nunto thee; then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication\r\nbefore the king that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's\r\nhouse, to die there. Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and\r\nasked him, and \"he told them according to all the words the king had\r\ncommanded.\" Thus, this man of God, as he is called, could tell a lie, or\r\nvery strongly prevaricate, when he supposed it would answer his purpose;\r\nfor certainly he did not go to Zedekiah to make this supplication,\r\nneither did he make it; he went because he was sent for, and he\r\nemployed that opportunity to advise Zedekiah to surrender himself to\r\nNebuchadnezzar.\r\n\r\nIn chapter xxxiv. 2-5, is a prophecy of Jeremiah to Zedekiah in these\r\nwords: \"Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will give this city into the hand\r\nof the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire; and thou\r\nshalt not escape out of his hand, but thou shalt surely be taken, and\r\ndelivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the\r\nking of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou\r\nshalt go to Babylon. Yet hear the word of the Lord; O Zedekiah, king,\r\nof Judah, thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not die by the sword, but thou\r\nshalt die in Peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former\r\nkings that were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee, and\r\nthey will lament thee, saying, Ah, Lord! for I have pronounced the word,\r\nsaith the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nNow, instead of Zedekiah beholding the eyes of the king of Babylon,\r\nand speaking with him mouth to mouth, and dying in peace, and with the\r\nburning of odours, as at the funeral of his fathers, (as Jeremiah had\r\ndeclared the Lord himself had pronounced,) the reverse, according to\r\nchapter Iii., 10, 11 was the case; it is there said, that the king of\r\nBabylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: then he put out the\r\neyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon,\r\nand put him in prison till the day of his death.\r\n\r\nWhat then can we say of these prophets, but that they are impostors and\r\nliars?\r\n\r\nAs for Jeremiah, he experienced none of those evils. He was taken into\r\nfavour by Nebuchadnezzar, who gave him in charge to the captain of the\r\nguard (xxxix, 12), \"Take him (said he) and look well to him, and do\r\nhim no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.\" Jeremiah\r\njoined himself afterwards to Nebuchadnezzar, and went about prophesying\r\nfor him against the Egyptians, who had marched to the relief of\r\nJerusalem while it was besieged. Thus much for another of the lying\r\nprophets, and the book that bears his name.\r\n\r\nI have been the more particular in treating of the books ascribed to\r\nIsaiah and Jeremiah, because those two are spoken of in the books of\r\nKings and Chronicles, which the others are not. The remainder of the\r\nbooks ascribed to the men called prophets I shall not trouble myself\r\nmuch about; but take them collectively into the observations I shall\r\noffer on the character of the men styled prophets.\r\n\r\nIn the former part of the 'Age of Reason,' I have said that the word\r\nprophet was the Bible-word for poet, and that the flights and metaphors\r\nof Jewish poets have been foolishly erected into what are now called\r\nprophecies. I am sufficiently justified in this opinion, not only\r\nbecause the books called the prophecies are written in poetical\r\nlanguage, but because there is no word in the Bible, except it be the\r\nword prophet, that describes what we mean by a poet. I have also said,\r\nthat the word signified a performer upon musical instruments, of which\r\nI have given some instances; such as that of a company of prophets,\r\nprophesying with psalteries, with tabrets, with pipes, with harps, etc.,\r\nand that Saul prophesied with them, 1 Sam. x., 5. It appears from this\r\npassage, and from other parts in the book of Samuel, that the word\r\nprophet was confined to signify poetry and music; for the person who was\r\nsupposed to have a visionary insight into concealed things, was not a\r\nprophet but a seer, [I know not what is the Hebrew word that corresponds\r\nto the word seer in English; but I observe it is translated into French\r\nby Le Voyant, from the verb voir to see, and which means the person who\r\nsees, or the seer.--Author.]\r\n\r\n[The Hebrew word for Seer, in 1 Samuel ix., transliterated, is\r\nchozeh, the gazer, it is translated in Is. xlvii. 13, \"the\r\nstargazers.\"--Editor.] (i Sam, ix. 9;) and it was not till after the\r\nword seer went out of use (which most probably was when Saul banished\r\nthose he called wizards) that the profession of the seer, or the art of\r\nseeing, became incorporated into the word prophet.\r\n\r\nAccording to the modern meaning of the word prophet and prophesying, it\r\nsignifies foretelling events to a great distance of time; and it became\r\nnecessary to the inventors of the gospel to give it this latitude of\r\nmeaning, in order to apply or to stretch what they call the prophecies\r\nof the Old Testament, to the times of the New. But according to the Old\r\nTestament, the prophesying of the seer, and afterwards of the prophet,\r\nso far as the meaning of the word \"seer\" was incorporated into that of\r\nprophet, had reference only to things of the time then passing, or very\r\nclosely connected with it; such as the event of a battle they were going\r\nto engage in, or of a journey, or of any enterprise they were going to\r\nundertake, or of any circumstance then pending, or of any difficulty\r\nthey were then in; all of which had immediate reference to themselves\r\n(as in the case already mentioned of Ahaz and Isaiah with respect to the\r\nexpression, Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,) and not\r\nto any distant future time. It was that kind of prophesying that\r\ncorresponds to what we call fortune-telling; such as casting nativities,\r\npredicting riches, fortunate or unfortunate marriages, conjuring for\r\nlost goods, etc.; and it is the fraud of the Christian church, not that\r\nof the Jews, and the ignorance and the superstition of modern, not that\r\nof ancient times, that elevated those poetical, musical, conjuring,\r\ndreaming, strolling gentry, into the rank they have since had.\r\n\r\nBut, besides this general character of all the prophets, they had also\r\na particular character. They were in parties, and they prophesied for\r\nor against, according to the party they were with; as the poetical and\r\npolitical writers of the present day write in defence of the party they\r\nassociate with against the other.\r\n\r\nAfter the Jews were divided into two nations, that of Judah and that of\r\nIsrael, each party had its prophets, who abused and accused each other\r\nof being false prophets, lying prophets, impostors, etc.\r\n\r\nThe prophets of the party of Judah prophesied against the prophets of\r\nthe party of Israel; and those of the party of Israel against those\r\nof Judah. This party prophesying showed itself immediately on the\r\nseparation under the first two rival kings, Rehoboam and Jeroboam. The\r\nprophet that cursed, or prophesied against the altar that Jeroboam had\r\nbuilt in Bethel, was of the party of Judah, where Rehoboam was king; and\r\nhe was way-laid on his return home by a prophet of the party of Israel,\r\nwho said unto him (i Kings xiii.) \"Art thou the man of God that came\r\nfrom Judah? and he said, I am.\" Then the prophet of the party of Israel\r\nsaid to him \"I am a prophet also, as thou art, [signifying of Judah,]\r\nand an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him\r\nback with thee unto thine house, that he may eat bread and drink\r\nwater; but (says the 18th verse) he lied unto him.\" The event, however,\r\naccording to the story, is, that the prophet of Judah never got back\r\nto Judah; for he was found dead on the road by the contrivance of the\r\nprophet of Israel, who no doubt was called a true prophet by his own\r\nparty, and the prophet of Judah a lying prophet.\r\n\r\nIn 2 Kings, iii., a story is related of prophesying or conjuring that\r\nshews, in several particulars, the character of a prophet. Jehoshaphat\r\nking of Judah, and Joram king of Israel, had for a while ceased their\r\nparty animosity, and entered into an alliance; and these two, together\r\nwith the king of Edom, engaged in a war against the king of Moab. After\r\nuniting and marching their armies, the story says, they were in great\r\ndistress for water, upon which Jehoshaphat said, \"Is there not here a\r\nprophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him? and one of\r\nthe servants of the king of Israel said here is Elisha. [Elisha was of\r\nthe party of Judah.] And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah said, The word of\r\nthe Lord is with him.\" The story then says, that these three kings went\r\ndown to Elisha; and when Elisha [who, as I have said, was a Judahmite\r\nprophet] saw the King of Israel, he said unto him, \"What have I to do\r\nwith thee, get thee to the prophets of thy father and the prophets of\r\nthy mother. Nay but, said the king of Israel, the Lord hath called these\r\nthree kings together, to deliver them into the hands of the king of\r\nMoab,\" (meaning because of the distress they were in for water;) upon\r\nwhich Elisha said, \"As the Lord of hosts liveth before whom I stand,\r\nsurely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, king\r\nof Judah, I would not look towards thee nor see thee.\" Here is all\r\nthe venom and vulgarity of a party prophet. We are now to see the\r\nperformance, or manner of prophesying.\r\n\r\nVer. 15. \"'Bring me,' (said Elisha), 'a minstrel'; and it came to pass,\r\nwhen the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.\" Here\r\nis the farce of the conjurer. Now for the prophecy: \"And Elisha said,\r\n[singing most probably to the tune he was playing], Thus saith the Lord,\r\nMake this valley full of ditches;\" which was just telling them what\r\nevery countryman could have told them without either fiddle or farce,\r\nthat the way to get water was to dig for it.\r\n\r\nBut as every conjuror is not famous alike for the same thing, so neither\r\nwere those prophets; for though all of them, at least those I have\r\nspoken of, were famous for lying, some of them excelled in cursing.\r\nElisha, whom I have just mentioned, was a chief in this branch of\r\nprophesying; it was he that cursed the forty-two children in the name\r\nof the Lord, whom the two she-bears came and devoured. We are to suppose\r\nthat those children were of the party of Israel; but as those who will\r\ncurse will lie, there is just as much credit to be given to this story\r\nof Elisha's two she-bears as there is to that of the Dragon of Wantley,\r\nof whom it is said:\r\n\r\n     Poor children three devoured be,\r\n     That could not with him grapple;\r\n     And at one sup he eat them up,\r\n     As a man would eat an apple.\r\n\r\nThere was another description of men called prophets, that amused\r\nthemselves with dreams and visions; but whether by night or by day\r\nwe know not. These, if they were not quite harmless, were but little\r\nmischievous. Of this class are,\r\n\r\nEZEKIEL and DANIEL; and the first question upon these books, as upon all\r\nthe others, is, Are they genuine? that is, were they written by Ezekiel\r\nand Daniel?\r\n\r\nOf this there is no proof; but so far as my own opinion goes, I am more\r\ninclined to believe they were, than that they were not. My reasons for\r\nthis opinion are as follows: First, Because those books do not contain\r\ninternal evidence to prove they were not written by Ezekiel and Daniel,\r\nas the books ascribed to Moses, Joshua, Samuel, etc., prove they were\r\nnot written by Moses, Joshua, Samuel, etc.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because they were not written till after the Babylonish\r\ncaptivity began; and there is good reason to believe that not any book\r\nin the bible was written before that period; at least it is proveable,\r\nfrom the books themselves, as I have already shown, that they were not\r\nwritten till after the commencement of the Jewish monarchy.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Because the manner in which the books ascribed to Ezekiel and\r\nDaniel are written, agrees with the condition these men were in at the\r\ntime of writing them.\r\n\r\nHad the numerous commentators and priests, who have foolishly employed\r\nor wasted their time in pretending to expound and unriddle those books,\r\nbeen carred into captivity, as Ezekiel and Daniel were, it would greatly\r\nhave improved their intellects in comprehending the reason for this mode\r\nof writing, and have saved them the trouble of racking their invention,\r\nas they have done to no purpose; for they would have found that\r\nthemselves would be obliged to write whatever they had to write,\r\nrespecting their own affairs, or those of their friends, or of their\r\ncountry, in a concealed manner, as those men have done.\r\n\r\nThese two books differ from all the rest; for it is only these that are\r\nfilled with accounts of dreams and visions: and this difference arose\r\nfrom the situation the writers were in as prisoners of war, or prisoners\r\nof state, in a foreign country, which obliged them to convey even\r\nthe most trifling information to each other, and all their political\r\nprojects or opinions, in obscure and metaphorical terms. They pretend to\r\nhave dreamed dreams, and seen visions, because it was unsafe for them to\r\nspeak facts or plain language. We ought, however, to suppose, that the\r\npersons to whom they wrote understood what they meant, and that it\r\nwas not intended anybody else should. But these busy commentators\r\nand priests have been puzzling their wits to find out what it was not\r\nintended they should know, and with which they have nothing to do.\r\n\r\nEzekiel and Daniel were carried prisoners to Babylon, under the first\r\ncaptivity, in the time of Jehoiakim, nine years before the second\r\ncaptivity in the time of Zedekiah. The Jews were then still numerous,\r\nand had considerable force at Jerusalem; and as it is natural to suppose\r\nthat men in the situation of Ezekiel and Daniel would be meditating the\r\nrecovery of their country, and their own deliverance, it is reasonable\r\nto suppose that the accounts of dreams and visions with which these\r\nbooks are filled, are no other than a disguised mode of correspondence\r\nto facilitate those objects: it served them as a cypher, or secret\r\nalphabet. If they are not this, they are tales, reveries, and nonsense;\r\nor at least a fanciful way of wearing off the wearisomeness of\r\ncaptivity; but the presumption is, they are the former.\r\n\r\nEzekiel begins his book by speaking of a vision of cherubims, and of a\r\nwheel within a wheel, which he says he saw by the river Chebar, in\r\nthe land of his captivity. Is it not reasonable to suppose that by the\r\ncherubims he meant the temple at Jerusalem, where they had figures of\r\ncherubims? and by a wheel within a wheel (which as a figure has always\r\nbeen understood to signify political contrivance) the project or means\r\nof recovering Jerusalem? In the latter part of his book he supposes\r\nhimself transported to Jerusalem, and into the temple; and he refers\r\nback to the vision on the river Chebar, and says, (xliii- 3,) that this\r\nlast vision was like the vision on the river Chebar; which indicates\r\nthat those pretended dreams and visions had for their object the\r\nrecovery of Jerusalem, and nothing further.\r\n\r\nAs to the romantic interpretations and applications, wild as the dreams\r\nand visions they undertake to explain, which commentators and priests\r\nhave made of those books, that of converting them into things which they\r\ncall prophecies, and making them bend to times and circumstances as far\r\nremote even as the present day, it shows the fraud or the extreme folly\r\nto which credulity or priestcraft can go.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything can be more absurd than to suppose that men situated\r\nas Ezekiel and Daniel were, whose country was over-run, and in the\r\npossession of the enemy, all their friends and relations in captivity\r\nabroad, or in slavery at home, or massacred, or in continual danger of\r\nit; scarcely any thing, I say, can be more absurd than to suppose that\r\nsuch men should find nothing to do but that of employing their time and\r\ntheir thoughts about what was to happen to other nations a thousand or\r\ntwo thousand years after they were dead; at the same time nothing more\r\nnatural than that they should meditate the recovery of Jerusalem, and\r\ntheir own deliverance; and that this was the sole object of all the\r\nobscure and apparently frantic writing contained in those books.\r\n\r\nIn this sense the mode of writing used in those two books being forced\r\nby necessity, and not adopted by choice, is not irrational; but, if we\r\nare to use the books as prophecies, they are false. In Ezekiel xxix.\r\n11., speaking of Egypt, it is said, \"No foot of man shall pass through\r\nit, nor foot of beast pass through it; neither shall it be inhabited for\r\nforty years.\" This is what never came to pass, and consequently it is\r\nfalse, as all the books I have already reviewed are.--I here close this\r\npart of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the former part of 'The Age of Reason' I have spoken of Jonah, and\r\nof the story of him and the whale.--A fit story for ridicule, if it was\r\nwritten to be believed; or of laughter, if it was intended to try what\r\ncredulity could swallow; for, if it could swallow Jonah and the whale it\r\ncould swallow anything.\r\n\r\nBut, as is already shown in the observations on the book of Job and of\r\nProverbs, it is not always certain which of the books in the Bible are\r\noriginally Hebrew, or only translations from the books of the Gentiles\r\ninto Hebrew; and, as the book of Jonah, so far from treating of\r\nthe affairs of the Jews, says nothing upon that subject, but treats\r\naltogether of the Gentiles, it is more probable that it is a book of\r\nthe Gentiles than of the Jews, [I have read in an ancient Persian poem\r\n(Saadi, I believe, but have mislaid the reference) this phrase: \"And now\r\nthe whale swallowed Jonah: the sun set.\"--Editor.] and that it has been\r\nwritten as a fable to expose the nonsense, and satyrize the vicious and\r\nmalignant character, of a Bible-prophet, or a predicting priest.\r\n\r\nJonah is represented, first as a disobedient prophet, running away from\r\nhis mission, and taking shelter aboard a vessel of the Gentiles, bound\r\nfrom Joppa to Tarshish; as if he ignorantly supposed, by such a paltry\r\ncontrivance, he could hide himself where God could not find him. The\r\nvessel is overtaken by a storm at sea; and the mariners, all of whom are\r\nGentiles, believing it to be a judgement on account of some one on board\r\nwho had committed a crime, agreed to cast lots to discover the offender;\r\nand the lot fell upon Jonah. But before this they had cast all their\r\nwares and merchandise over-board to lighten the vessel, while Jonah,\r\nlike a stupid fellow, was fast asleep in the hold.\r\n\r\nAfter the lot had designated Jonah to be the offender, they questioned\r\nhim to know who and what he was? and he told them he was an Hebrew;\r\nand the story implies that he confessed himself to be guilty. But these\r\nGentiles, instead of sacrificing him at once without pity or mercy, as a\r\ncompany of Bible-prophets or priests would have done by a Gentile in the\r\nsame case, and as it is related Samuel had done by Agag, and Moses by\r\nthe women and children, they endeavoured to save him, though at the risk\r\nof their own lives: for the account says, \"Nevertheless [that is, though\r\nJonah was a Jew and a foreigner, and the cause of all their misfortunes,\r\nand the loss of their cargo] the men rowed hard to bring the boat\r\nto land, but they could not, for the sea wrought and was tempestuous\r\nagainst them.\" Still however they were unwilling to put the fate of the\r\nlot into execution; and they cried, says the account, unto the Lord,\r\nsaying, \"We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man's life,\r\nand lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Lord, hast done as it\r\npleased thee.\" Meaning thereby, that they did not presume to judge Jonah\r\nguilty, since that he might be innocent; but that they considered the\r\nlot that had fallen upon him as a decree of God, or as it pleased\r\nGod. The address of this prayer shows that the Gentiles worshipped one\r\nSupreme Being, and that they were not idolaters as the Jews represented\r\nthem to be. But the storm still continuing, and the danger encreasing,\r\nthey put the fate of the lot into execution, and cast Jonah in the sea;\r\nwhere, according to the story, a great fish swallowed him up whole and\r\nalive!\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider Jonah securely housed from the storm in the\r\nfish's belly. Here we are told that he prayed; but the prayer is\r\na made-up prayer, taken from various parts of the Psalms, without\r\nconnection or consistency, and adapted to the distress, but not at all\r\nto the condition that Jonah was in. It is such a prayer as a Gentile,\r\nwho might know something of the Psalms, could copy out for him. This\r\ncircumstance alone, were there no other, is sufficient to indicate that\r\nthe whole is a made-up story. The prayer, however, is supposed to have\r\nanswered the purpose, and the story goes on, (taking-off at the same\r\ntime the cant language of a Bible-prophet,) saying, \"The Lord spake unto\r\nthe fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon dry land.\"\r\n\r\nJonah then received a second mission to Nineveh, with which he sets\r\nout; and we have now to consider him as a preacher. The distress he is\r\nrepresented to have suffered, the remembrance of his own disobedience as\r\nthe cause of it, and the miraculous escape he is supposed to have had,\r\nwere sufficient, one would conceive, to have impressed him with sympathy\r\nand benevolence in the execution of his mission; but, instead of this,\r\nhe enters the city with denunciation and malediction in his mouth,\r\ncrying, \"Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.\"\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider this supposed missionary in the last act of his\r\nmission; and here it is that the malevolent spirit of a Bible-prophet,\r\nor of a predicting priest, appears in all that blackness of character\r\nthat men ascribe to the being they call the devil.\r\n\r\nHaving published his predictions, he withdrew, says the story, to the\r\neast side of the city.--But for what? not to contemplate in retirement\r\nthe mercy of his Creator to himself or to others, but to wait, with\r\nmalignant impatience, the destruction of Nineveh. It came to pass,\r\nhowever, as the story relates, that the Ninevites reformed, and that\r\nGod, according to the Bible phrase, repented him of the evil he had said\r\nhe would do unto them, and did it not. This, saith the first verse of\r\nthe last chapter, displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry.\r\nHis obdurate heart would rather that all Nineveh should be destroyed,\r\nand every soul, young and old, perish in its ruins, than that his\r\nprediction should not be fulfilled. To expose the character of a prophet\r\nstill more, a gourd is made to grow up in the night, that promises him\r\nan agreeable shelter from the heat of the sun, in the place to which he\r\nis retired; and the next morning it dies.\r\n\r\nHere the rage of the prophet becomes excessive, and he is ready to\r\ndestroy himself. \"It is better, said he, for me to die than to live.\"\r\nThis brings on a supposed expostulation between the Almighty and the\r\nprophet; in which the former says, \"Doest thou well to be angry for the\r\ngourd? And Jonah said, I do well to be angry even unto death. Then\r\nsaid the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast\r\nnot laboured, neither madest it to grow, which came up in a night, and\r\nperished in a night; and should not I spare Nineveh, that great city,\r\nin which are more than threescore thousand persons, that cannot discern\r\nbetween their right hand and their left?\"\r\n\r\nHere is both the winding up of the satire, and the moral of the fable.\r\nAs a satire, it strikes against the character of all the Bible-prophets,\r\nand against all the indiscriminate judgements upon men, women and\r\nchildren, with which this lying book, the bible, is crowded; such as\r\nNoah's flood, the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, the\r\nextirpation of the Canaanites, even to suckling infants, and women with\r\nchild; because the same reflection 'that there are more than threescore\r\nthousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their\r\nleft,' meaning young children, applies to all their cases. It satirizes\r\nalso the supposed partiality of the Creator for one nation more than for\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAs a moral, it preaches against the malevolent spirit of prediction; for\r\nas certainly as a man predicts ill, he becomes inclined to wish it. The\r\npride of having his judgment right hardens his heart, till at last\r\nhe beholds with satisfaction, or sees with disappointment, the\r\naccomplishment or the failure of his predictions.--This book ends\r\nwith the same kind of strong and well-directed point against prophets,\r\nprophecies and indiscriminate judgements, as the chapter that Benjamin\r\nFranklin made for the Bible, about Abraham and the stranger, ends\r\nagainst the intolerant spirit of religious persecutions--Thus much for\r\nthe book Jonah. [The story of Abraham and the Fire-worshipper, ascribed\r\nto Franklin, is from Saadi. (See my \"Sacred Anthology,\" p. 61.) Paine\r\nhas often been called a \"mere scoffer,\" but he seems to have been among\r\nthe first to treat with dignity the book of Jonah, so especially liable\r\nto the ridicule of superficial readers, and discern in it the highest\r\nconception of Deity known to the Old Testament.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nOf the poetical parts of the Bible, that are called prophecies, I have\r\nspoken in the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' and already in this,\r\nwhere I have said that the word for prophet is the Bible-word for Poet,\r\nand that the flights and metaphors of those poets, many of which have\r\nbecome obscure by the lapse of time and the change of circumstances,\r\nhave been ridiculously erected into things called prophecies, and\r\napplied to purposes the writers never thought of. When a priest quotes\r\nany of those passages, he unriddles it agreeably to his own views, and\r\nimposes that explanation upon his congregation as the meaning of the\r\nwriter. The whore of Babylon has been the common whore of all the\r\npriests, and each has accused the other of keeping the strumpet; so well\r\ndo they agree in their explanations.\r\n\r\nThere now remain only a few books, which they call books of the lesser\r\nprophets; and as I have already shown that the greater are impostors,\r\nit would be cowardice to disturb the repose of the little ones. Let\r\nthem sleep, then, in the arms of their nurses, the priests, and both be\r\nforgotten together.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through the Bible, as a man would go through a wood with\r\nan axe on his shoulder, and fell trees. Here they lie; and the priests,\r\nif they can, may replant them. They may, perhaps, stick them in the\r\nground, but they will never make them grow.--I pass on to the books of\r\nthe New Testament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II - THE NEW TESTAMENT\r\n\r\nTHE New Testament, they tell us, is founded upon the prophecies of the\r\nOld; if so, it must follow the fate of its foundation.\r\n\r\nAs it is nothing extraordinary that a woman should be with child before\r\nshe was married, and that the son she might bring forth should be\r\nexecuted, even unjustly, I see no reason for not believing that such a\r\nwoman as Mary, and such a man as Joseph, and Jesus, existed; their mere\r\nexistence is a matter of indifference, about which there is no ground\r\neither to believe or to disbelieve, and which comes under the common\r\nhead of, It may be so, and what then? The probability however is that\r\nthere were such persons, or at least such as resembled them in part\r\nof the circumstances, because almost all romantic stories have been\r\nsuggested by some actual circumstance; as the adventures of Robinson\r\nCrusoe, not a word of which is true, were suggested by the case of\r\nAlexander Selkirk.\r\n\r\nIt is not then the existence or the non-existence, of the persons that\r\nI trouble myself about; it is the fable of Jesus Christ, as told in\r\nthe New Testament, and the wild and visionary doctrine raised thereon,\r\nagainst which I contend. The story, taking it as it is told, is\r\nblasphemously obscene. It gives an account of a young woman engaged\r\nto be married, and while under this engagement, she is, to speak plain\r\nlanguage, debauched by a ghost, under the impious pretence, (Luke i.\r\n35,) that \"the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the\r\nHighest shall overshadow thee.\" Notwithstanding which, Joseph afterwards\r\nmarries her, cohabits with her as his wife, and in his turn rivals the\r\nghost. This is putting the story into intelligible language, and when\r\ntold in this manner, there is not a priest but must be ashamed to own\r\nit. [Mary, the supposed virgin, mother of Jesus, had several other\r\nchildren, sons and daughters. See Matt. xiii. 55, 56.--Author.]\r\n\r\nObscenity in matters of faith, however wrapped up, is always a token of\r\nfable and imposture; for it is necessary to our serious belief in God,\r\nthat we do not connect it with stories that run, as this does, into\r\nludicrous interpretations. This story is, upon the face of it, the same\r\nkind of story as that of Jupiter and Leda, or Jupiter and Europa, or any\r\nof the amorous adventures of Jupiter; and shews, as is already stated\r\nin the former part of 'The Age of Reason,' that the Christian faith is\r\nbuilt upon the heathen Mythology.\r\n\r\nAs the historical parts of the New Testament, so far as concerns Jesus\r\nChrist, are confined to a very short space of time, less than two\r\nyears, and all within the same country, and nearly to the same spot, the\r\ndiscordance of time, place, and circumstance, which detects the fallacy\r\nof the books of the Old Testament, and proves them to be impositions,\r\ncannot be expected to be found here in the same abundance. The New\r\nTestament compared with the Old, is like a farce of one act, in which\r\nthere is not room for very numerous violations of the unities. There\r\nare, however, some glaring contradictions, which, exclusive of the\r\nfallacy of the pretended prophecies, are sufficient to show the story of\r\nJesus Christ to be false.\r\n\r\nI lay it down as a position which cannot be controverted, first, that\r\nthe agreement of all the parts of a story does not prove that story\r\nto be true, because the parts may agree, and the whole may be false;\r\nsecondly, that the disagreement of the parts of a story proves the whole\r\ncannot be true. The agreement does not prove truth, but the disagreement\r\nproves falsehood positively.\r\n\r\nThe history of Jesus Christ is contained in the four books ascribed to\r\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John.--The first chapter of Matthew begins with\r\ngiving a genealogy of Jesus Christ; and in the third chapter of Luke\r\nthere is also given a genealogy of Jesus Christ. Did these two agree, it\r\nwould not prove the genealogy to be true, because it might nevertheless\r\nbe a fabrication; but as they contradict each other in every particular,\r\nit proves falsehood absolutely. If Matthew speaks truth, Luke speaks\r\nfalsehood; and if Luke speaks truth, Matthew speaks falsehood: and as\r\nthere is no authority for believing one more than the other, there is no\r\nauthority for believing either; and if they cannot be believed even\r\nin the very first thing they say, and set out to prove, they are not\r\nentitled to be believed in any thing they say afterwards. Truth is an\r\nuniform thing; and as to inspiration and revelation, were we to admit\r\nit, it is impossible to suppose it can be contradictory. Either then the\r\nmen called apostles were imposters, or the books ascribed to them have\r\nbeen written by other persons, and fathered upon them, as is the case in\r\nthe Old Testament.\r\n\r\nThe book of Matthew gives (i. 6), a genealogy by name from David, up,\r\nthrough Joseph, the husband of Mary, to Christ; and makes there to be\r\ntwent eight generations. The book of Luke gives also a genealogy by\r\nname from Christ, through Joseph the husband of Mary, down to David, and\r\nmakes there to be forty-three generations; besides which, there is only\r\nthe two names of David and Joseph that are alike in the two lists.--I\r\nhere insert both genealogical lists, and for the sake of perspicuity and\r\ncomparison, have placed them both in the same direction, that is, from\r\nJoseph down to David.\r\n\r\n   Genealogy, according to            Genealogy, according to\r\n        Matthew.

To find therefore the average age of each\r\nperson mentioned in the list, at the time his first son was born, it\r\nis only necessary to divide 1080 by 27, which gives 40 years for each\r\nperson. As the life-time of man was then but of the same extent it is\r\nnow, it is an absurdity to suppose, that 27 following generations should\r\nall be old bachelors, before they married; and the more so, when we are\r\ntold that Solomon, the next in succession to David, had a house full of\r\nwives and mistresses before he was twenty-one years of age. So far from\r\nthis genealogy being a solemn truth, it is not even a reasonable lie.\r\nThe list of Luke gives about twenty-six years for the average age, and\r\nthis is too much.--Author.]\r\n\r\nNow, if these men, Matthew and Luke, set out with a falsehood between\r\nthem (as these two accounts show they do) in the very commencement of\r\ntheir history of Jesus Christ, and of who, and of what he was, what\r\nauthority (as I have before asked) is there left for believing the\r\nstrange things they tell us afterwards? If they cannot be believed in\r\ntheir account of his natural genealogy, how are we to believe them when\r\nthey tell us he was the son of God, begotten by a ghost; and that\r\nan angel announced this in secret to his mother? If they lied in one\r\ngenealogy, why are we to believe them in the other? If his natural\r\ngenealogy be manufactured, which it certainly is, why are we not to\r\nsuppose that his celestial genealogy is manufactured also, and that the\r\nwhole is fabulous? Can any man of serious reflection hazard his future\r\nhappiness upon the belief of a story naturally impossible, repugnant\r\nto every idea of decency, and related by persons already detected of\r\nfalsehood? Is it not more safe that we stop ourselves at the plain,\r\npure, and unmixed belief of one God, which is deism, than that we\r\ncommit ourselves on an ocean of improbable, irrational, indecent, and\r\ncontradictory tales?\r\n\r\nThe first question, however, upon the books of the New Testament, as\r\nupon those of the Old, is, Are they genuine? were they written by the\r\npersons to whom they are ascribed? For it is upon this ground only that\r\nthe strange things related therein have been credited. Upon this point,\r\nthere is no direct proof for or against; and all that this state of a\r\ncase proves is doubtfulness; and doubtfulness is the opposite of belief.\r\nThe state, therefore, that the books are in, proves against themselves\r\nas far as this kind of proof can go.\r\n\r\nBut, exclusive of this, the presumption is that the books called the\r\nEvangelists, and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not\r\nwritten by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and that they are impositions.\r\nThe disordered state of the history in these four books, the silence of\r\none book upon matters related in the other, and the disagreement that\r\nis to be found among them, implies that they are the productions of some\r\nunconnected individuals, many years after the things they pretend to\r\nrelate, each of whom made his own legend; and not the writings of men\r\nliving intimately together, as the men called apostles are supposed to\r\nhave done: in fine, that they have been manufactured, as the books of\r\nthe Old Testament have been, by other persons than those whose names\r\nthey bear.\r\n\r\nThe story of the angel announcing what the church calls the immaculate\r\nconception, is not so much as mentioned in the books ascribed to Mark,\r\nand John; and is differently related in Matthew and Luke. The former\r\nsays the angel, appeared to Joseph; the latter says, it was to Mary;\r\nbut either Joseph or Mary was the worst evidence that could have been\r\nthought of; for it was others that should have testified for them, and\r\nnot they for themselves. Were any girl that is now with child to say,\r\nand even to swear it, that she was gotten with child by a ghost, and\r\nthat an angel told her so, would she be believed? Certainly she would\r\nnot. Why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we\r\nnever saw, told by nobody knows who, nor when, nor where? How strange\r\nand inconsistent is it, that the same circumstance that would weaken\r\nthe belief even of a probable story, should be given as a motive for\r\nbelieving this one, that has upon the face of it every token of absolute\r\nimpossibility and imposture.\r\n\r\nThe story of Herod destroying all the children under two years old,\r\nbelongs altogether to the book of Matthew; not one of the rest mentions\r\nanything about it. Had such a circumstance been true, the universality\r\nof it must have made it known to all the writers, and the thing would\r\nhave been too striking to have been omitted by any. This writer tell us,\r\nthat Jesus escaped this slaughter, because Joseph and Mary were warned\r\nby an angel to flee with him into Egypt; but he forgot to make provision\r\nfor John [the Baptist], who was then under two years of age. John,\r\nhowever, who staid behind, fared as well as Jesus, who fled; and\r\ntherefore the story circumstantially belies itself.\r\n\r\nNot any two of these writers agree in reciting, exactly in the same\r\nwords, the written inscription, short as it is, which they tell us was\r\nput over Christ when he was crucified; and besides this, Mark says, He\r\nwas crucified at the third hour, (nine in the morning;) and John says it\r\nwas the sixth hour, (twelve at noon.) [According to John, (xix. 14)\r\nthe sentence was not passed till about the sixth hour (noon,) and\r\nconsequently the execution could not be till the afternoon; but Mark\r\n(xv. 25) Says expressly that he was crucified at the third hour, (nine\r\nin the morning,)--Author.]\r\n\r\nThe inscription is thus stated in those books:\r\n\r\nMatthew--This is Jesus the king of the Jews. Mark--The king of the Jews.\r\nLuke--This is the king of the Jews. John--Jesus of Nazareth the king of\r\nthe Jews.\r\n\r\nWe may infer from these circumstances, trivial as they are, that those\r\nwriters, whoever they were, and in whatever time they lived, were\r\nnot present at the scene. The only one of the men called apostles who\r\nappears to have been near to the spot was Peter, and when he was accused\r\nof being one of Jesus's followers, it is said, (Matthew xxvi. 74,) \"Then\r\nPeter began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man:\" yet\r\nwe are now called to believe the same Peter, convicted, by their own\r\naccount, of perjury. For what reason, or on what authority, should we do\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nThe accounts that are given of the circumstances, that they tell us\r\nattended the crucifixion, are differently related in those four books.\r\n\r\nThe book ascribed to Matthew says 'there was darkness over all the land\r\nfrom the sixth hour unto the ninth hour--that the veil of the temple\r\nwas rent in twain from the top to the bottom--that there was an\r\nearthquake--that the rocks rent--that the graves opened, that the bodies\r\nof many of the saints that slept arose and came out of their graves\r\nafter the resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared unto\r\nmany.' Such is the account which this dashing writer of the book of\r\nMatthew gives, but in which he is not supported by the writers of the\r\nother books.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the book ascribed to Mark, in detailing the circumstances\r\nof the crucifixion, makes no mention of any earthquake, nor of the rocks\r\nrending, nor of the graves opening, nor of the dead men walking out. The\r\nwriter of the book of Luke is silent also upon the same points. And\r\nas to the writer of the book of John, though he details all the\r\ncircumstances of the crucifixion down to the burial of Christ, he\r\nsays nothing about either the darkness--the veil of the temple--the\r\nearthquake--the rocks--the graves--nor the dead men.\r\n\r\nNow if it had been true that these things had happened, and if the\r\nwriters of these books had lived at the time they did happen, and\r\nhad been the persons they are said to be--namely, the four men called\r\napostles, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,--it was not possible for them,\r\nas true historians, even without the aid of inspiration, not to have\r\nrecorded them. The things, supposing them to have been facts, were of\r\ntoo much notoriety not to have been known, and of too much importance\r\nnot to have been told. All these supposed apostles must have been\r\nwitnesses of the earthquake, if there had been any, for it was not\r\npossible for them to have been absent from it: the opening of the graves\r\nand resurrection of the dead men, and their walking about the city, is\r\nof still greater importance than the earthquake. An earthquake is always\r\npossible, and natural, and proves nothing; but this opening of the\r\ngraves is supernatural, and directly in point to their doctrine, their\r\ncause, and their apostleship. Had it been true, it would have filled\r\nup whole chapters of those books, and been the chosen theme and general\r\nchorus of all the writers; but instead of this, little and trivial\r\nthings, and mere prattling conversation of 'he said this and she said\r\nthat' are often tediously detailed, while this most important of all,\r\nhad it been true, is passed off in a slovenly manner by a single dash\r\nof the pen, and that by one writer only, and not so much as hinted at by\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy thing to tell a lie, but it is difficult to support the\r\nlie after it is told. The writer of the book of Matthew should have told\r\nus who the saints were that came to life again, and went into the city,\r\nand what became of them afterwards, and who it was that saw them; for he\r\nis not hardy enough to say that he saw them himself;--whether they came\r\nout naked, and all in natural buff, he-saints and she-saints, or whether\r\nthey came full dressed, and where they got their dresses; whether they\r\nwent to their former habitations, and reclaimed their wives, their\r\nhusbands, and their property, and how they were received; whether they\r\nentered ejectments for the recovery of their possessions, or brought\r\nactions of crim. con. against the rival interlopers; whether they\r\nremained on earth, and followed their former occupation of preaching or\r\nworking; or whether they died again, or went back to their graves alive,\r\nand buried themselves.\r\n\r\nStrange indeed, that an army of saints should retum to life, and nobody\r\nknow who they were, nor who it was that saw them, and that not a word\r\nmore should be said upon the subject, nor these saints have any thing\r\nto tell us! Had it been the prophets who (as we are told) had formerly\r\nprophesied of these things, they must have had a great deal to say.\r\nThey could have told us everything, and we should have had posthumous\r\nprophecies, with notes and commentaries upon the first, a little better\r\nat least than we have now. Had it been Moses, and Aaron, and Joshua, and\r\nSamuel, and David, not an unconverted Jew had remained in all Jerusalem.\r\nHad it been John the Baptist, and the saints of the times then present,\r\neverybody would have known them, and they would have out-preached and\r\nout-famed all the other apostles. But, instead of this, these saints are\r\nmade to pop up, like Jonah's gourd in the night, for no purpose at all\r\nbut to wither in the morning.--Thus much for this part of the story.\r\n\r\nThe tale of the resurrection follows that of the crucifixion; and in\r\nthis as well as in that, the writers, whoever they were, disagree so\r\nmuch as to make it evident that none of them were there.\r\n\r\nThe book of Matthew states, that when Christ was put in the sepulchre\r\nthe Jews applied to Pilate for a watch or a guard to be placed over the\r\nseptilchre, to prevent the body being stolen by the disciples; and that\r\nin consequence of this request the sepulchre was made sure, sealing the\r\nstone that covered the mouth, and setting a watch. But the other books\r\nsay nothing about this application, nor about the sealing, nor the\r\nguard, nor the watch; and according to their accounts, there were none.\r\nMatthew, however, follows up this part of the story of the guard or the\r\nwatch with a second part, that I shall notice in the conclusion, as it\r\nserves to detect the fallacy of those books.\r\n\r\nThe book of Matthew continues its account, and says, (xxviii. 1,) that\r\nat the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn, towards the first day of\r\nthe week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.\r\nMark says it was sun-rising, and John says it was dark. Luke says it\r\nwas Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other\r\nwomen, that came to the sepulchre; and John states that Mary Magdalene\r\ncame alone. So well do they agree about their first evidence! They all,\r\nhowever, appear to have known most about Mary Magdalene; she was a woman\r\nof large acquaintance, and it was not an ill conjecture that she might\r\nbe upon the stroll. [The Bishop of Llandaff, in his famous \"Apology,\"\r\ncensured Paine severely for this insinuation against Mary Magdalene, but\r\nthe censure really falls on our English version, which, by a\r\nchapter-heading (Luke vii.), has unwarrantably identified her as the\r\nsinful woman who anointed Jesus, and irrevocably branded her.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nThe book of Matthew goes on to say (ver. 2): \"And behold there was a\r\ngreat earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and\r\ncame and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it\" But\r\nthe other books say nothing about any earthquake, nor about the angel\r\nrolling back the stone, and sitting upon it and, according to their\r\naccount, there was no angel sitting there. Mark says the angel [Mark\r\nsays \"a young man,\" and Luke \"two men.\"--Editor.] was within the\r\nsepulchre, sitting on the right side. Luke says there were two, and they\r\nwere both standing up; and John says they were both sitting down, one at\r\nthe head and the other at the feet.\r\n\r\nMatthew says, that the angel that was sitting upon the stone on the\r\noutside of the sepulchre told the two Marys that Christ was risen, and\r\nthat the women went away quickly. Mark says, that the women, upon seeing\r\nthe stone rolled away, and wondering at it, went into the sepulchre, and\r\nthat it was the angel that was sitting within on the right side, that\r\ntold them so. Luke says, it was the two angels that were Standing\r\nup; and John says, it was Jesus Christ himself that told it to Mary\r\nMagdalene; and that she did not go into the sepulchre, but only stooped\r\ndown and looked in.\r\n\r\nNow, if the writers of these four books had gone into a court of justice\r\nto prove an alibi, (for it is of the nature of an alibi that is\r\nhere attempted to be proved, namely, the absence of a dead body by\r\nsupernatural means,) and had they given their evidence in the same\r\ncontradictory manner as it is here given, they would have been in danger\r\nof having their ears cropt for perjury, and would have justly deserved\r\nit. Yet this is the evidence, and these are the books, that have been\r\nimposed upon the world as being given by divine inspiration, and as the\r\nunchangeable word of God.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the book of Matthew, after giving this account, relates\r\na story that is not to be found in any of the other books, and which is\r\nthe same I have just before alluded to. \"Now,\" says he, [that is, after\r\nthe conversation the women had had with the angel sitting upon the\r\nstone,] \"behold some of the watch [meaning the watch that he had said\r\nhad been placed over the sepulchre] came into the city, and shawed unto\r\nthe chief priests all the things that were done; and when they were\r\nassembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave large money\r\nunto the soldiers, saying, Say ye, that his disciples came by night, and\r\nstole him away while we slept; and if this come to the governor's ears,\r\nwe will persuade him, and secure you. So they took the money, and did as\r\nthey were taught; and this saying [that his disciples stole him away] is\r\ncommonly reported among the Jews until this day.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression, until this day, is an evidence that the book ascribed\r\nto Matthew was not written by Matthew, and that it has been manufactured\r\nlong after the times and things of which it pretends to treat; for\r\nthe expression implies a great length of intervening time. It would be\r\ninconsistent in us to speak in this manner of any thing happening in our\r\nown time. To give, therefore, intelligible meaning to the expression,\r\nwe must suppose a lapse of some generations at least, for this manner of\r\nspeaking carries the mind back to ancient time.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity also of the story is worth noticing; for it shows the\r\nwriter of the book of Matthew to have been an exceeding weak and foolish\r\nman. He tells a story that contradicts itself in point of possibility;\r\nfor though the guard, if there were any, might be made to say that the\r\nbody was taken away while they were asleep, and to give that as a\r\nreason for their not having prevented it, that same sleep must also have\r\nprevented their knowing how, and by whom, it was done; and yet they are\r\nmade to say that it was the disciples who did it. Were a man to tender\r\nhis evidence of something that he should say was done, and of the manner\r\nof doing it, and of the person who did it, while he was asleep, and\r\ncould know nothing of the matter, such evidence could not be received:\r\nit will do well enough for Testament evidence, but not for any thing\r\nwhere truth is concerned.\r\n\r\nI come now to that part of the evidence in those books, that respects\r\nthe pretended appearance of Christ after this pretended resurrection.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the book of Matthew relates, that the angel that was\r\nsitting on the stone at the mouth of the sepulchre, said to the two\r\nMarys (xxviii. 7), \"Behold Christ is gone before you into Galilee, there\r\nye shall see him; lo, I have told you.\" And the same writer at the next\r\ntwo verses (8, 9,) makes Christ himself to speak to the same purpose to\r\nthese women immediately after the angel had told it to them, and that\r\nthey ran quickly to tell it to the disciples; and it is said (ver. 16),\r\n\"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where\r\nJesus had appointed them; and, when they saw him, they worshipped him.\"\r\n\r\nBut the writer of the book of John tells us a story very different to\r\nthis; for he says (xx. 19) \"Then the same day at evening, being the\r\nfirst day of the week, [that is, the same day that Christ is said\r\nto have risen,] when the doors were shut, where the disciples were\r\nassembled, for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Matthew the eleven were marching to Galilee, to meet Jesus\r\nin a mountain, by his own appointment, at the very time when, according\r\nto John, they were assembled in another place, and that not by\r\nappointment, but in secret, for fear of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the book of Luke xxiv. 13, 33-36, contradicts that of\r\nMatthew more pointedly than John does; for he says expressly, that the\r\nmeeting was in Jerusalem the evening of the same day that he (Christ)\r\nrose, and that the eleven were there.\r\n\r\nNow, it is not possible, unless we admit these supposed disciples the\r\nright of wilful lying, that the writers of these books could be any of\r\nthe eleven persons called disciples; for if, according to Matthew,\r\nthe eleven went into Galilee to meet Jesus in a mountain by his own\r\nappointment, on the same day that he is said to have risen, Luke and\r\nJohn must have been two of that eleven; yet the writer of Luke says\r\nexpressly, and John implies as much, that the meeting was that same day,\r\nin a house in Jerusalem; and, on the other hand, if, according to Luke\r\nand John, the eleven were assembled in a house in Jerusalem, Matthew\r\nmust have been one of that eleven; yet Matthew says the meeting was in a\r\nmountain in Galilee, and consequently the evidence given in those books\r\ndestroy each other.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the book of Mark says nothing about any meeting in\r\nGalilee; but he says (xvi. 12) that Christ, after his resurrection,\r\nappeared in another form to two of them, as they walked into the\r\ncountry, and that these two told it to the residue, who would not\r\nbelieve them. [This belongs to the late addition to Mark, which\r\noriginally ended with xvi. 8.--Editor.] Luke also tells a story, in\r\nwhich he keeps Christ employed the whole of the day of this pretended\r\nresurrection, until the evening, and which totally invalidates the\r\naccount of going to the mountain in Galilee. He says, that two of them,\r\nwithout saying which two, went that same day to a village called Emmaus,\r\nthree score furlongs (seven miles and a half) from Jerusalem, and\r\nthat Christ in disguise went with them, and stayed with them unto the\r\nevening, and supped with them, and then vanished out of their sight, and\r\nreappeared that same evening, at the meeting of the eleven in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThis is the contradictory manner in which the evidence of this pretended\r\nreappearance of Christ is stated: the only point in which the writers\r\nagree, is the skulking privacy of that reappearance; for whether it\r\nwas in the recess of a mountain in Galilee, or in a shut-up house in\r\nJerusalem, it was still skulking. To what cause then are we to assign\r\nthis skulking? On the one hand, it is directly repugnant to the supposed\r\nor pretended end, that of convincing the world that Christ was risen;\r\nand, on the other hand, to have asserted the publicity of it would have\r\nexposed the writers of those books to public detection; and, therefore,\r\nthey have been under the necessity of making it a private affair.\r\n\r\nAs to the account of Christ being seen by more than five hundred at\r\nonce, it is Paul only who says it, and not the five hundred who say it\r\nfor themselves. It is, therefore, the testimony of but one man, and that\r\ntoo of a man, who did not, according to the same account, believe a\r\nword of the matter himself at the time it is said to have happened.\r\nHis evidence, supposing him to have been the writer of Corinthians xv.,\r\nwhere this account is given, is like that of a man who comes into a\r\ncourt of justice to swear that what he had sworn before was false. A man\r\nmay often see reason, and he has too always the right of changing his\r\nopinion; but this liberty does not extend to matters of fact.\r\n\r\nI now come to the last scene, that of the ascension into heaven.--Here\r\nall fear of the Jews, and of every thing else, must necessarily have\r\nbeen out of the question: it was that which, if true, was to seal the\r\nwhole; and upon which the reality of the future mission of the disciples\r\nwas to rest for proof. Words, whether declarations or promises, that\r\npassed in private, either in the recess of a mountain in Galilee, or in\r\na shut-up house in Jerusalem, even supposing them to have been spoken,\r\ncould not be evidence in public; it was therefore necessary that this\r\nlast scene should preclude the possibility of denial and dispute; and\r\nthat it should be, as I have stated in the former part of 'The Age of\r\nReason,' as public and as visible as the sun at noon-day; at least it\r\nought to have been as public as the crucifixion is reported to have\r\nbeen.--But to come to the point.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the writer of the book of Matthew does not say a\r\nsyllable about it; neither does the writer of the book of John. This\r\nbeing the case, is it possible to suppose that those writers, who affect\r\nto be even minute in other matters, would have been silent upon this,\r\nhad it been true? The writer of the book of Mark passes it off in a\r\ncareless, slovenly manner, with a single dash of the pen, as if he was\r\ntired of romancing, or ashamed of the story. So also does the writer of\r\nLuke. And even between these two, there is not an apparent agreement,\r\nas to the place where this final parting is said to have been. [The last\r\nnine verses of Mark being ungenuine, the story of the ascension\r\nrests exclusively on the words in Luke xxiv. 51, \"was carried up into\r\nheaven,\"--words omitted by several ancient authorities.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nThe book of Mark says that Christ appeared to the eleven as they sat at\r\nmeat, alluding to the meeting of the eleven at Jerusalem: he then states\r\nthe conversation that he says passed at that meeting; and immediately\r\nafter says (as a school-boy would finish a dull story,) \"So then, after\r\nthe Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and\r\nsat on the right hand of God.\" But the writer of Luke says, that the\r\nascension was from Bethany; that he (Christ) led them out as far as\r\nBethany, and was parted from them there, and was carried up into heaven.\r\nSo also was Mahomet: and, as to Moses, the apostle Jude says, ver. 9.\r\nThat 'Michael and the devil disputed about his body.' While we believe\r\nsuch fables as these, or either of them, we believe unworthily of the\r\nAlmighty.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through the examination of the four books ascribed to\r\nMatthew, Mark, Luke and John; and when it is considered that the whole\r\nspace of time, from the crucifixion to what is called the ascension, is\r\nbut a few days, apparently not more than three or four, and that all the\r\ncircumstances are reported to have happened nearly about the same spot,\r\nJerusalem, it is, I believe, impossible to find in any story upon record\r\nso many and such glaring absurdities, contradictions, and falsehoods, as\r\nare in those books. They are more numerous and striking than I had any\r\nexpectation of finding, when I began this examination, and far more\r\nso than I had any idea of when I wrote the former part of 'The Age of\r\nReason.' I had then neither Bible nor Testament to refer to, nor could I\r\nprocure any. My own situation, even as to existence, was becoming every\r\nday more precarious; and as I was willing to leave something behind me\r\nupon the subject, I was obliged to be quick and concise. The quotations\r\nI then made were from memory only, but they are correct; and the\r\nopinions I have advanced in that work are the effect of the most clear\r\nand long-established conviction,--that the Bible and the Testament are\r\nimpositions upon the world;--that the fall of man, the account of Jesus\r\nChrist being the Son of God, and of his dying to appease the wrath\r\nof God, and of salvation by that strange means, are all fabulous\r\ninventions, dishonourable to the wisdom and power of the Almighty;--that\r\nthe only true religion is deism, by which I then meant and now mean\r\nthe belief of one God, and an imitation of his moral character, or the\r\npractice of what are called moral virtues;--and that it was upon this\r\nonly (so far as religion is concerned) that I rested all my hopes of\r\nhappiness hereafter. So say I now--and so help me God.\r\n\r\nBut to retum to the subject.--Though it is impossible, at this distance\r\nof time, to ascertain as a fact who were the writers of those four books\r\n(and this alone is sufficient to hold them in doubt, and where we doubt\r\nwe do not believe) it is not difficult to ascertain negatively that\r\nthey were not written by the persons to whom they are ascribed. The\r\ncontradictions in those books demonstrate two things:\r\n\r\nFirst, that the writers cannot have been eye-witnesses and ear-witnesses\r\nof the matters they relate, or they would have related them without\r\nthose contradictions; and, consequently that the books have not been\r\nwritten by the persons called apostles, who are supposed to have been\r\nwitnesses of this kind.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the writers, whoever they were, have not acted in\r\nconcerted imposition, but each writer separately and individually for\r\nhimself, and without the knowledge of the other.\r\n\r\nThe same evidence that applies to prove the one, applies equally to\r\nprove both cases; that is, that the books were not written by the men\r\ncalled apostles, and also that they are not a concerted imposition. As\r\nto inspiration, it is altogether out of the question; we may as well\r\nattempt to unite truth and falsehood, as inspiration and contradiction.\r\n\r\nIf four men are eye-witnesses and ear-witnesses to a scene, they will\r\nwithout any concert between them, agree as to time and place, when and\r\nwhere that scene happened. Their individual knowledge of the thing, each\r\none knowing it for himself, renders concert totally unnecessary; the\r\none will not say it was in a mountain in the country, and the other at\r\na house in town; the one will not say it was at sunrise, and the other\r\nthat it was dark. For in whatever place it was and whatever time it was,\r\nthey know it equally alike.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other hand, if four men concert a story, they will make their\r\nseparate relations of that story agree and corroborate with each other\r\nto support the whole. That concert supplies the want of fact in the one\r\ncase, as the knowledge of the fact supersedes, in the other case, the\r\nnecessity of a concert. The same contradictions, therefore, that\r\nprove there has been no concert, prove also that the reporters had no\r\nknowledge of the fact, (or rather of that which they relate as a fact,)\r\nand detect also the falsehood of their reports. Those books, therefore,\r\nhave neither been written by the men called apostles, nor by imposters\r\nin concert.--How then have they been written?\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who are fond of believing there is much of that\r\nwhich is called wilful lying, or lying originally, except in the case of\r\nmen setting up to be prophets, as in the Old Testament; for prophesying\r\nis lying professionally. In almost all other cases it is not difficult\r\nto discover the progress by which even simple supposition, with the aid\r\nof credulity, will in time grow into a lie, and at last be told as a\r\nfact; and whenever we can find a charitable reason for a thing of this\r\nkind, we ought not to indulge a severe one.\r\n\r\nThe story of Jesus Christ appearing after he was dead is the story of an\r\napparition, such as timid imaginations can always create in vision,\r\nand credulity believe. Stories of this kind had been told of the\r\nassassination of Julius Caesar not many years before, and they generally\r\nhave their origin in violent deaths, or in execution of innocent\r\npersons. In cases of this kind, compassion lends its aid, and\r\nbenevolently stretches the story. It goes on a little and a little\r\nfarther, till it becomes a most certain truth. Once start a ghost, and\r\ncredulity fills up the history of its life, and assigns the cause of its\r\nappearance; one tells it one way, another another way, till there are as\r\nmany stories about the ghost, and about the proprietor of the ghost, as\r\nthere are about Jesus Christ in these four books.\r\n\r\nThe story of the appearance of Jesus Christ is told with that strange\r\nmixture of the natural and impossible, that distinguishes legendary tale\r\nfrom fact. He is represented as suddenly coming in and going out when\r\nthe doors are shut, and of vanishing out of sight, and appearing again,\r\nas one would conceive of an unsubstantial vision; then again he is\r\nhungry, sits down to meat, and eats his supper. But as those who tell\r\nstories of this kind never provide for all the cases, so it is here:\r\nthey have told us, that when he arose he left his grave-clothes behind\r\nhim; but they have forgotten to provide other clothes for him to appear\r\nin afterwards, or to tell us what he did with them when he ascended;\r\nwhether he stripped all off, or went up clothes and all. In the case of\r\nElijah, they have been careful enough to make him throw down his mantle;\r\nhow it happened not to be burnt in the chariot of fire, they also have\r\nnot told us; but as imagination supplies all deficiencies of this kind,\r\nwe may suppose if we please that it was made of salamander's wool.\r\n\r\nThose who are not much acquainted with ecclesiastical history, may\r\nsuppose that the book called the New Testament has existed ever since\r\nthe time of Jesus Christ, as they suppose that the books ascribed\r\nto Moses have existed ever since the time of Moses. But the fact is\r\nhistorically otherwise; there was no such book as the New Testament till\r\nmore than three hundred years after the time that Christ is said to have\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nAt what time the books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, began\r\nto appear, is altogether a matter of uncertainty. There is not the least\r\nshadow of evidence of who the persons were that wrote them, nor at what\r\ntime they were written; and they might as well have been called by the\r\nnames of any of the other supposed apostles as by the names they are now\r\ncalled. The originals are not in the possession of any Christian\r\nChurch existing, any more than the two tables of stone written on, they\r\npretend, by the finger of God, upon Mount Sinai, and given to Moses,\r\nare in the possession of the Jews. And even if they were, there is no\r\npossibility of proving the hand-writing in either case. At the time\r\nthose four books were written there was no printing, and consequently\r\nthere could be no publication otherwise than by written copies, which\r\nany man might make or alter at pleasure, and call them originals. Can\r\nwe suppose it is consistent with the wisdom of the Almighty to commit\r\nhimself and his will to man upon such precarious means as these; or that\r\nit is consistent we should pin our faith upon such uncertainties? We\r\ncannot make nor alter, nor even imitate, so much as one blade of grass\r\nthat he has made, and yet we can make or alter words of God as easily\r\nas words of man. [The former part of the 'Age of Reason' has not been\r\npublished two years, and there is already an expression in it that is\r\nnot mine. The expression is: The book of Luke was carried by a majority\r\nof one voice only. It may be true, but it is not I that have said it.\r\nSome person who might know of that circumstance, has added it in a note\r\nat the bottom of the page of some of the editions, printed either in\r\nEngland or in America; and the printers, after that, have erected it\r\ninto the body of the work, and made me the author of it. If this has\r\nhappened within such a short space of time, notwithstanding the aid of\r\nprinting, which prevents the alteration of copies individually, what may\r\nnot have happened in a much greater length of time, when there was no\r\nprinting, and when any man who could write could make a written copy and\r\ncall it an original by Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John?--Author.]\r\n\r\n[The spurious addition to Paine's work alluded to in his footnote drew on\r\nhim a severe criticism from Dr. Priestley (\"Letters to a Philosophical\r\nUnbeliever,\" p. 75), yet it seems to have been Priestley himself who, in\r\nhis quotation, first incorporated into Paine's text the footnote added\r\nby the editor of the American edition (1794). The American added:\r\n\"Vide Moshiem's (sic) Ecc. History,\" which Priestley omits. In a modern\r\nAmerican edition I notice four verbal alterations introduced into the\r\nabove footnote.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nAbout three hundred and fifty years after the time that Christ is\r\nsaid to have lived, several writings of the kind I am speaking of were\r\nscattered in the hands of divers individuals; and as the church had\r\nbegun to form itself into an hierarchy, or church government, with\r\ntemporal powers, it set itself about collecting them into a code, as\r\nwe now see them, called 'The New Testament.' They decided by vote, as I\r\nhave before said in the former part of the Age of Reason, which of those\r\nwritings, out of the collection they had made, should be the word of\r\nGod, and which should not. The Robbins of the Jews had decided, by vote,\r\nupon the books of the Bible before.\r\n\r\nAs the object of the church, as is the case in all national\r\nestablishments of churches, was power and revenue, and terror the\r\nmeans it used, it is consistent to suppose that the most miraculous and\r\nwonderful of the writings they had collected stood the best chance of\r\nbeing voted. And as to the authenticity of the books, the vote stands in\r\nthe place of it; for it can be traced no higher.\r\n\r\nDisputes, however, ran high among the people then calling themselves\r\nChristians, not only as to points of doctrine, but as to the\r\nauthenticity of the books. In the contest between the person called St.\r\nAugustine, and Fauste, about the year 400, the latter says, \"The books\r\ncalled the Evangelists have been composed long after the times of the\r\napostles, by some obscure men, who, fearing that the world would not\r\ngive credit to their relation of matters of which they could not be\r\ninformed, have published them under the names of the apostles; and\r\nwhich are so full of sottishness and discordant relations, that there is\r\nneither agreement nor connection between them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in another place, addressing himself to the advocates of those\r\nbooks, as being the word of God, he says, \"It is thus that your\r\npredecessors have inserted in the scriptures of our Lord many things\r\nwhich, though they carry his name, agree not with his doctrine.\" This is\r\nnot surprising, since that we have often proved that these things have\r\nnot been written by himself, nor by his apostles, but that for the\r\ngreatest part they are founded upon tales, upon vague reports, and put\r\ntogether by I know not what half-Jews, with but little agreement between\r\nthem; and which they have nevertheless published under the name of the\r\napostles of our Lord, and have thus attributed to them their own errors\r\nand their lies. [I have taken these two extracts from Boulanger's Life\r\nof Paul, written in French; Boulanger has quoted them from the writings\r\nof Augustine against Fauste, to which he refers.--Author.]\r\n\r\nThis Bishop Faustus is usually styled \"The Manichaeum,\" Augustine having\r\nentitled his book, Contra Frustum Manichaeum Libri xxxiii., in which\r\nnearly the whole of Faustus' very able work is quoted.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will see by those extracts that the authenticity of the\r\nbooks of the New Testament was denied, and the books treated as tales,\r\nforgeries, and lies, at the time they were voted to be the word of God.\r\nBut the interest of the church, with the assistance of the faggot, bore\r\ndown the opposition, and at last suppressed all investigation. Miracles\r\nfollowed upon miracles, if we will believe them, and men were taught to\r\nsay they believed whether they believed or not. But (by way of throwing\r\nin a thought) the French Revolution has excommunicated the church\r\nfrom the power of working miracles; she has not been able, with the\r\nassistance of all her saints, to work one miracle since the revolution\r\nbegan; and as she never stood in greater need than now, we may, without\r\nthe aid of divination, conclude that all her former miracles are\r\ntricks and lies. [Boulanger in his life of Paul, has collected from the\r\necclesiastical histories, and the writings of the fathers as they are\r\ncalled, several matters which show the opinions that prevailed among the\r\ndifferent sects of Christians, at the time the Testament, as we now see\r\nit, was voted to be the word of God. The following extracts are from the\r\nsecond chapter of that work:\r\n\r\n[The Marcionists (a Christian sect) asserted that the evangelists were\r\nfilled with falsities. The Manichaeans, who formed a very numerous\r\nsect at the commencement of Christianity, rejected as false all the New\r\nTestament, and showed other writings quite different that they gave for\r\nauthentic. The Corinthians, like the Marcionists, admitted not the Acts\r\nof the Apostles. The Encratites and the Sevenians adopted neither the\r\nActs, nor the Epistles of Paul. Chrysostom, in a homily which he made\r\nupon the Acts of the Apostles, says that in his time, about the year\r\n400, many people knew nothing either of the author or of the book. St.\r\nIrene, who lived before that time, reports that the Valentinians, like\r\nseveral other sects of the Christians, accused the scriptures of being\r\nfilled with imperfections, errors, and contradictions. The Ebionites, or\r\nNazarenes, who were the first Christians, rejected all the Epistles of\r\nPaul, and regarded him as an impostor. They report, among other things,\r\nthat he was originally a Pagan; that he came to Jerusalem, where he\r\nlived some time; and that having a mind to marry the daughter of the\r\nhigh priest, he had himself been circumcised; but that not being able to\r\nobtain her, he quarrelled with the Jews and wrote against circumcision,\r\nand against the observation of the Sabbath, and against all the legal\r\nordinances.--Author.] [Much abridged from the Exam. Crit. de la Vie de\r\nSt. Paul, by N.A. Boulanger, 1770.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the lapse of more than three hundred years intervening\r\nbetween the time that Christ is said to have lived and the time the\r\nNew Testament was formed into a book, we must see, even without the\r\nassistance of historical evidence, the exceeding uncertainty there is\r\nof its authenticity. The authenticity of the book of Homer, so far as\r\nregards the authorship, is much better established than that of the New\r\nTestament, though Homer is a thousand years the most ancient. It was\r\nonly an exceeding good poet that could have written the book of Homer,\r\nand, therefore, few men only could have attempted it; and a man capable\r\nof doing it would not have thrown away his own fame by giving it to\r\nanother. In like manner, there were but few that could have composed\r\nEuclid's Elements, because none but an exceeding good geometrician could\r\nhave been the author of that work.\r\n\r\nBut with respect to the books of the New Testament, particularly such\r\nparts as tell us of the resurrection and ascension of Christ, any person\r\nwho could tell a story of an apparition, or of a man's walking, could\r\nhave made such books; for the story is most wretchedly told. The chance,\r\ntherefore, of forgery in the Testament is millions to one greater than\r\nin the case of Homer or Euclid. Of the numerous priests or parsons of\r\nthe present day, bishops and all, every one of them can make a sermon,\r\nor translate a scrap of Latin, especially if it has been translated\r\na thousand times before; but is there any amongst them that can write\r\npoetry like Homer, or science like Euclid? The sum total of a parson's\r\nlearning, with very few exceptions, is a, b, ab, and hic, haec, hoc;\r\nand their knowledge of science is, three times one is three; and this is\r\nmore than sufficient to have enabled them, had they lived at the time,\r\nto have written all the books of the New Testament.\r\n\r\nAs the opportunities of forgery were greater, so also was the\r\ninducement. A man could gain no advantage by writing under the name of\r\nHomer or Euclid; if he could write equal to them, it would be better\r\nthat he wrote under his own name; if inferior, he could not succeed.\r\nPride would prevent the former, and impossibility the latter. But with\r\nrespect to such books as compose the New Testament, all the inducements\r\nwere on the side of forgery. The best imagined history that could have\r\nbeen made, at the distance of two or three hundred years after the time,\r\ncould not have passed for an original under the name of the real\r\nwriter; the only chance of success lay in forgery; for the church wanted\r\npretence for its new doctrine, and truth and talents were out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBut as it is not uncommon (as before observed) to relate stories of\r\npersons walking after they are dead, and of ghosts and apparitions of\r\nsuch as have fallen by some violent or extraordinary means; and as the\r\npeople of that day were in the habit of believing such things, and of\r\nthe appearance of angels, and also of devils, and of their getting into\r\npeople's insides, and shaking them like a fit of an ague, and of their\r\nbeing cast out again as if by an emetic--(Mary Magdalene, the book of\r\nMark tells us had brought up, or been brought to bed of seven devils;)\r\nit was nothing extraordinary that some story of this kind should get\r\nabroad of the person called Jesus Christ, and become afterwards the\r\nfoundation of the four books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\r\nEach writer told a tale as he heard it, or thereabouts, and gave to his\r\nbook the name of the saint or the apostle whom tradition had given as\r\nthe eye-witness. It is only upon this ground that the contradictions in\r\nthose books can be accounted for; and if this be not the case, they are\r\ndownright impositions, lies, and forgeries, without even the apology of\r\ncredulity.\r\n\r\nThat they have been written by a sort of half Jews, as the foregoing\r\nquotations mention, is discernible enough. The frequent references\r\nmade to that chief assassin and impostor Moses, and to the men called\r\nprophets, establishes this point; and, on the other hand, the church\r\nhas complimented the fraud, by admitting the Bible and the Testament\r\nto reply to each other. Between the Christian-Jew and the\r\nChristian-Gentile, the thing called a prophecy, and the thing prophesied\r\nof, the type and the thing typified, the sign and the thing signified,\r\nhave been industriously rummaged up, and fitted together like old locks\r\nand pick-lock keys. The story foolishly enough told of Eve and the\r\nserpent, and naturally enough as to the enmity between men and serpents\r\n(for the serpent always bites about the heel, because it cannot reach\r\nhigher, and the man always knocks the serpent about the head, as the\r\nmost effectual way to prevent its biting;) [\"It shall bruise thy head,\r\nand thou shalt bruise his heel.\" Gen. iii. 15.--Author.] this foolish\r\nstory, I say, has been made into a prophecy, a type, and a promise to\r\nbegin with; and the lying imposition of Isaiah to Ahaz, 'That a virgin\r\nshall conceive and bear a son,' as a sign that Ahaz should conquer,\r\nwhen the event was that he was defeated (as already noticed in the\r\nobservations on the book of Isaiah), has been perverted, and made to\r\nserve as a winder up.\r\n\r\nJonah and the whale are also made into a sign and type. Jonah is Jesus,\r\nand the whale is the grave; for it is said, (and they have made Christ\r\nto say it of himself, Matt. xii. 40), \"For as Jonah was three days and\r\nthree nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days\r\nand three nights in the heart of the earth.\" But it happens, awkwardly\r\nenough, that Christ, according to their own account, was but one day\r\nand two nights in the grave; about 36 hours instead of 72; that is, the\r\nFriday night, the Saturday, and the Saturday night; for they say he was\r\nup on the Sunday morning by sunrise, or before. But as this fits quite\r\nas well as the bite and the kick in Genesis, or the virgin and her son\r\nin Isaiah, it will pass in the lump of orthodox things.--Thus much for\r\nthe historical part of the Testament and its evidences.\r\n\r\nEpistles of Paul--The epistles ascribed to Paul, being fourteen in\r\nnumber, almost fill up the remaining part of the Testament. Whether\r\nthose epistles were written by the person to whom they are ascribed is\r\na matter of no great importance, since that the writer, whoever he was,\r\nattempts to prove his doctrine by argument. He does not pretend to\r\nhave been witness to any of the scenes told of the resurrection and the\r\nascension; and he declares that he had not believed them.\r\n\r\nThe story of his being struck to the ground as he was journeying to\r\nDamascus, has nothing in it miraculous or extraordinary; he escaped with\r\nlife, and that is more than many others have done, who have been struck\r\nwith lightning; and that he should lose his sight for three days, and be\r\nunable to eat or drink during that time, is nothing more than is common\r\nin such conditions. His companions that were with him appear not to have\r\nsuffered in the same manner, for they were well enough to lead him the\r\nremainder of the journey; neither did they pretend to have seen any\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nThe character of the person called Paul, according to the accounts\r\ngiven of him, has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism; he had\r\npersecuted with as much heat as he preached afterwards; the stroke\r\nhe had received had changed his thinking, without altering his\r\nconstitution; and either as a Jew or a Christian he was the same zealot.\r\nSuch men are never good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach.\r\nThey are always in extremes, as well of action as of belief.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine he sets out to prove by argument, is the resurrection of\r\nthe same body: and he advances this as an evidence of immortality.\r\nBut so much will men differ in their manner of thinking, and in the\r\nconclusions they draw from the same premises, that this doctrine of\r\nthe resurrection of the same body, so far from being an evidence of\r\nimmortality, appears to me to be an evidence against it; for if I have\r\nalready died in this body, and am raised again in the same body in which\r\nI have died, it is presumptive evidence that I shall die again. That\r\nresurrection no more secures me against the repetition of dying, than an\r\nague-fit, when past, secures me against another. To believe therefore in\r\nimmortality, I must have a more elevated idea than is contained in the\r\ngloomy doctrine of the resurrection.\r\n\r\nBesides, as a matter of choice, as well as of hope, I had rather have a\r\nbetter body and a more convenient form than the present. Every animal\r\nin the creation excels us in something. The winged insects, without\r\nmentioning doves or eagles, can pass over more space with greater ease\r\nin a few minutes than man can in an hour. The glide of the smallest\r\nfish, in proportion to its bulk, exceeds us in motion almost beyond\r\ncomparison, and without weariness. Even the sluggish snail can ascend\r\nfrom the bottom of a dungeon, where man, by the want of that ability,\r\nwould perish; and a spider can launch itself from the top, as a playful\r\namusement. The personal powers of man are so limited, and his heavy\r\nframe so little constructed to extensive enjoyment, that there is\r\nnothing to induce us to wish the opinion of Paul to be true. It is too\r\nlittle for the magnitude of the scene, too mean for the sublimity of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBut all other arguments apart, the consciousness of existence is the\r\nonly conceivable idea we can have of another life, and the continuance\r\nof that consciousness is immortality. The consciousness of existence, or\r\nthe knowing that we exist, is not necessarily confined to the same form,\r\nnor to the same matter, even in this life.\r\n\r\nWe have not in all cases the same form, nor in any case the same matter,\r\nthat composed our bodies twenty or thirty years ago; and yet we are\r\nconscious of being the same persons. Even legs and arms, which make up\r\nalmost half the human frame, are not necessary to the consciousness of\r\nexistence. These may be lost or taken away and the full consciousness\r\nof existence remain; and were their place supplied by wings, or other\r\nappendages, we cannot conceive that it could alter our consciousness of\r\nexistence. In short, we know not how much, or rather how little, of our\r\ncomposition it is, and how exquisitely fine that little is, that creates\r\nin us this consciousness of existence; and all beyond that is like the\r\npulp of a peach, distinct and separate from the vegetative speck in the\r\nkernel.\r\n\r\nWho can say by what exceeding fine action of fine matter it is that a\r\nthought is produced in what we call the mind? and yet that thought\r\nwhen produced, as I now produce the thought I am writing, is capable\r\nof becoming immortal, and is the only production of man that has that\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nStatues of brass and marble will perish; and statues made in imitation\r\nof them are not the same statues, nor the same workmanship, any more\r\nthan the copy of a picture is the same picture. But print and reprint\r\na thought a thousand times over, and that with materials of any kind,\r\ncarve it in wood, or engrave it on stone, the thought is eternally\r\nand identically the same thought in every case. It has a capacity of\r\nunimpaired existence, unaffected by change of matter, and is essentially\r\ndistinct, and of a nature different from every thing else that we know\r\nof, or can conceive. If then the thing produced has in itself a capacity\r\nof being immortal, it is more than a token that the power that produced\r\nit, which is the self-same thing as consciousness of existence, can\r\nbe immortal also; and that as independently of the matter it was first\r\nconnected with, as the thought is of the printing or writing it first\r\nappeared in. The one idea is not more difficult to believe than the\r\nother; and we can see that one is true.\r\n\r\nThat the consciousness of existence is not dependent on the same form\r\nor the same matter, is demonstrated to our senses in the works of\r\nthe creation, as far as our senses are capable of receiving that\r\ndemonstration. A very numerous part of the animal creation preaches to\r\nus, far better than Paul, the belief of a life hereafter. Their little\r\nlife resembles an earth and a heaven, a present and a future state; and\r\ncomprises, if it may be so expressed, immortality in miniature.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful parts of the creation to our eye are the winged\r\ninsects, and they are not so originally. They acquire that form and\r\nthat inimitable brilliancy by progressive changes. The slow and creeping\r\ncaterpillar worm of to day, passes in a few days to a torpid figure, and\r\na state resembling death; and in the next change comes forth in all the\r\nminiature magnificence of life, a splendid butterfly. No resemblance of\r\nthe former creature remains; every thing is changed; all his powers\r\nare new, and life is to him another thing. We cannot conceive that the\r\nconsciousness of existence is not the same in this state of the animal\r\nas before; why then must I believe that the resurrection of the same\r\nbody is necessary to continue to me the consciousness of existence\r\nhereafter?\r\n\r\nIn the former part of 'The Agee of Reason.' I have called the creation\r\nthe true and only real word of God; and this instance, or this text, in\r\nthe book of creation, not only shows to us that this thing may be so,\r\nbut that it is so; and that the belief of a future state is a rational\r\nbelief, founded upon facts visible in the creation: for it is not more\r\ndifficult to believe that we shall exist hereafter in a better state and\r\nform than at present, than that a worm should become a butterfly, and\r\nquit the dunghill for the atmosphere, if we did not know it as a fact.\r\n\r\nAs to the doubtful jargon ascribed to Paul in 1 Corinthians xv., which\r\nmakes part of the burial service of some Christian sectaries, it is\r\nas destitute of meaning as the tolling of a bell at the funeral; it\r\nexplains nothing to the understanding, it illustrates nothing to the\r\nimagination, but leaves the reader to find any meaning if he can. \"All\r\nflesh,\" says he, \"is not the same flesh. There is one flesh of men,\r\nanother of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.\" And what\r\nthen? nothing. A cook could have said as much. \"There are also,\" says\r\nhe, \"bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial; the glory of the celestial\r\nis one and the glory of the terrestrial is the other.\" And what then?\r\nnothing. And what is the difference? nothing that he has told. \"There\r\nis,\" says he, \"one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and\r\nanother glory of the stars.\" And what then? nothing; except that he says\r\nthat one star differeth from another star in glory, instead of distance;\r\nand he might as well have told us that the moon did not shine so bright\r\nas the sun. All this is nothing better than the jargon of a conjuror,\r\nwho picks up phrases he does not understand to confound the credulous\r\npeople who come to have their fortune told. Priests and conjurors are of\r\nthe same trade.\r\n\r\nSometimes Paul affects to be a naturalist, and to prove his system of\r\nresurrection from the principles of vegetation. \"Thou fool\" says he,\r\n\"that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die.\" To which one\r\nmight reply in his own language, and say, Thou fool, Paul, that which\r\nthou sowest is not quickened except it die not; for the grain that dies\r\nin the ground never does, nor can vegetate. It is only the living grains\r\nthat produce the next crop. But the metaphor, in any point of view, is\r\nno simile. It is succession, and [not] resurrection.\r\n\r\nThe progress of an animal from one state of being to another, as from a\r\nworm to a butterfly, applies to the case; but this of a grain does not,\r\nand shows Paul to have been what he says of others, a fool.\r\n\r\nWhether the fourteen epistles ascribed to Paul were written by him\r\nor not, is a matter of indifference; they are either argumentative or\r\ndogmatical; and as the argument is defective, and the dogmatical part is\r\nmerely presumptive, it signifies not who wrote them. And the same may\r\nbe said for the remaining parts of the Testament. It is not upon the\r\nEpistles, but upon what is called the Gospel, contained in the four\r\nbooks ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and upon the pretended\r\nprophecies, that the theory of the church, calling itself the Christian\r\nChurch, is founded. The Epistles are dependant upon those, and must\r\nfollow their fate; for if the story of Jesus Christ be fabulous, all\r\nreasoning founded upon it, as a supposed truth, must fall with it.\r\n\r\nWe know from history, that one of the principal leaders of this church,\r\nAthanasius, lived at the time the New Testament was formed; [Athanasius\r\ndied, according to the Church chronology, in the year 371--Author.] and\r\nwe know also, from the absurd jargon he has left us under the name of\r\na creed, the character of the men who formed the New Testament; and we\r\nknow also from the same history that the authenticity of the books of\r\nwhich it is composed was denied at the time. It was upon the vote of\r\nsuch as Athanasius that the Testament was decreed to be the word of God;\r\nand nothing can present to us a more strange idea than that of decreeing\r\nthe word of God by vote. Those who rest their faith upon such authority\r\nput man in the place of God, and have no true foundation for future\r\nhappiness. Credulity, however, is not a crime, but it becomes criminal\r\nby resisting conviction. It is strangling in the womb of the conscience\r\nthe efforts it makes to ascertain truth. We should never force belief\r\nupon ourselves in any thing.\r\n\r\nI here close the subject on the Old Testament and the New. The evidence\r\nI have produced to prove them forgeries, is extracted from the books\r\nthemselves, and acts, like a two-edge sword, either way. If the evidence\r\nbe denied, the authenticity of the Scriptures is denied with it, for it\r\nis Scripture evidence: and if the evidence be admitted, the authenticity\r\nof the books is disproved. The contradictory impossibilities, contained\r\nin the Old Testament and the New, put them in the case of a man who\r\nswears for and against. Either evidence convicts him of perjury, and\r\nequally destroys reputation.\r\n\r\nShould the Bible and the Testament hereafter fall, it is not that I\r\nhave done it. I have done no more than extracted the evidence from\r\nthe confused mass of matters with which it is mixed, and arranged that\r\nevidence in a point of light to be clearly seen and easily comprehended;\r\nand, having done this, I leave the reader to judge for himself, as I\r\nhave judged for myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III - CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIN the former part of 'The Age of Reason' I have spoken of the three\r\nfrauds, mystery, miracle, and Prophecy; and as I have seen nothing in\r\nany of the answers to that work that in the least affects what I have\r\nthere said upon those subjects, I shall not encumber this Second Part\r\nwith additions that are not necessary.\r\n\r\nI have spoken also in the same work upon what is celled revelation, and\r\nhave shown the absurd misapplication of that term to the books of\r\nthe Old Testament and the New; for certainly revelation is out of the\r\nquestion in reciting any thing of which man has been the actor or the\r\nwitness. That which man has done or seen, needs no revelation to tell\r\nhim he has done it, or seen it--for he knows it already--nor to enable\r\nhim to tell it or to write it. It is ignorance, or imposition, to apply\r\nthe term revelation in such cases; yet the Bible and Testament are\r\nclassed under this fraudulent description of being all revelation.\r\n\r\nRevelation then, so far as the term has relation between God and man,\r\ncan only be applied to something which God reveals of his will to man;\r\nbut though the power of the Almighty to make such a communication is\r\nnecessarily admitted, because to that power all things are possible,\r\nyet, the thing so revealed (if any thing ever was revealed, and which,\r\nby the bye, it is impossible to prove) is revelation to the person only\r\nto whom it is made. His account of it to another is not revelation; and\r\nwhoever puts faith in that account, puts it in the man from whom the\r\naccount comes; and that man may have been deceived, or may have dreamed\r\nit; or he may be an impostor and may lie. There is no possible criterion\r\nwhereby to judge of the truth of what he tells; for even the morality of\r\nit would be no proof of revelation. In all such cases, the proper\r\nanswer should be, \"When it is revealed to me, I will believe it to be\r\nrevelation; but it is not and cannot be incumbent upon me to believe\r\nit to be revelation before; neither is it proper that I should take the\r\nword of man as the word of God, and put man in the place of God.\" This\r\nis the manner in which I have spoken of revelation in the former part of\r\nThe Age of Reason; and which, whilst it reverentially admits revelation\r\nas a possible thing, because, as before said, to the Almighty all things\r\nare possible, it prevents the imposition of one man upon another, and\r\nprecludes the wicked use of pretended revelation.\r\n\r\nBut though, speaking for myself, I thus admit the possibility of\r\nrevelation, I totally disbelieve that the Almighty ever did communicate\r\nany thing to man, by any mode of speech, in any language, or by any kind\r\nof vision, or appearance, or by any means which our senses are capable\r\nof receiving, otherwise than by the universal display of himself in the\r\nworks of the creation, and by that repugnance we feel in ourselves to\r\nbad actions, and disposition to good ones. [A fair parallel of the then\r\nunknown aphorism of Kant: \"Two things fill the soul with wonder and\r\nreverence, increasing evermore as I meditate more closely upon them:\r\nthe starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.\" (Kritik\r\nderpraktischen Vernunfe, 1788). Kant's religious utterances at the\r\nbeginning of the French Revolution brought on him a royal mandate\r\nof silence, because he had worked out from \"the moral law within\" a\r\nprinciple of human equality precisely similar to that which Paine had\r\nderived from his Quaker doctrine of the \"inner light\" of every man.\r\nAbout the same time Paine's writings were suppressed in England. Paine\r\ndid not understand German, but Kant, though always independent in\r\nthe formation of his opinions, was evidently well acquainted with the\r\nliterature of the Revolution, in America, England, and France.--Editor.]\r\n\r\nThe most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the\r\ngreatest miseries, that have afflicted the human race have had their\r\norigin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. It\r\nhas been the most dishonourable belief against the character of the\r\ndivinity, the most destructive to morality, and the peace and happiness\r\nof man, that ever was propagated since man began to exist. It is better,\r\nfar better, that we admitted, if it were possible, a thousand devils to\r\nroam at large, and to preach publicly the doctrine of devils, if there\r\nwere any such, than that we permitted one such impostor and monster\r\nas Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and the Bible prophets, to come with the\r\npretended word of God in his mouth, and have credit among us.\r\n\r\nWhence arose all the horrid assassinations of whole nations of men,\r\nwomen, and infants, with which the Bible is filled; and the bloody\r\npersecutions, and tortures unto death and religious wars, that since\r\nthat time have laid Europe in blood and ashes; whence arose they, but\r\nfrom this impious thing called revealed religion, and this monstrous\r\nbelief that God has spoken to man? The lies of the Bible have been the\r\ncause of the one, and the lies of the Testament [of] the other.\r\n\r\nSome Christians pretend that Christianity was not established by the\r\nsword; but of what period of time do they speak? It was impossible that\r\ntwelve men could begin with the sword: they had not the power; but no\r\nsooner were the professors of Christianity sufficiently powerful to\r\nemploy the sword than they did so, and the stake and faggot too; and\r\nMahomet could not do it sooner. By the same spirit that Peter cut off\r\nthe ear of the high priest's servant (if the story be true) he would\r\ncut off his head, and the head of his master, had he been able. Besides\r\nthis, Christianity grounds itself originally upon the [Hebrew] Bible,\r\nand the Bible was established altogether by the sword, and that in the\r\nworst use of it--not to terrify, but to extirpate. The Jews made\r\nno converts: they butchered all. The Bible is the sire of the [New]\r\nTestament, and both are called the word of God. The Christians read\r\nboth books; the ministers preach from both books; and this thing\r\ncalled Christianity is made up of both. It is then false to say that\r\nChristianity was not established by the sword.\r\n\r\nThe only sect that has not persecuted are the Quakers; and the only\r\nreason that can be given for it is, that they are rather Deists than\r\nChristians. They do not believe much about Jesus Christ, and they\r\ncall the scriptures a dead letter. [This is an interesting and correct\r\ntestimony as to the beliefs of the earlier Quakers, one of whom was\r\nPaine's father.--Editor.] Had they called them by a worse name, they had\r\nbeen nearer the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent on every man who reverences the character of the\r\nCreator, and who wishes to lessen the catalogue of artificial miseries,\r\nand remove the cause that has sown persecutions thick among mankind,\r\nto expel all ideas of a revealed religion as a dangerous heresy, and an\r\nimpious fraud. What is it that we have learned from this pretended thing\r\ncalled revealed religion? Nothing that is useful to man, and every\r\nthing that is dishonourable to his Maker. What is it the Bible teaches\r\nus?--repine, cruelty, and murder. What is it the Testament teaches\r\nus?--to believe that the Almighty committed debauchery with a woman\r\nengaged to be married; and the belief of this debauchery is called\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nAs to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinly\r\nscattered in those books, they make no part of this pretended thing,\r\nrevealed religion. They are the natural dictates of conscience, and the\r\nbonds by which society is held together, and without which it cannot\r\nexist; and are nearly the same in all religions, and in all societies.\r\nThe Testament teaches nothing new upon this subject, and where it\r\nattempts to exceed, it becomes mean and ridiculous. The doctrine of not\r\nretaliating injuries is much better expressed in Proverbs, which is\r\na collection as well from the Gentiles as the Jews, than it is in the\r\nTestament. It is there said, (Xxv. 2 I) \"If thine enemy be hungry,\r\ngive him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:\"\r\n[According to what is called Christ's sermon on the mount, in the book\r\nof Matthew, where, among some other [and] good things, a great deal of\r\nthis feigned morality is introduced, it is there expressly said, that\r\nthe doctrine of forbearance, or of not retaliating injuries, was not\r\nany part of the doctrine of the Jews; but as this doctrine is found in\r\n\"Proverbs,\" it must, according to that statement, have been copied from\r\nthe Gentiles, from whom Christ had learned it. Those men whom Jewish and\r\nChristian idolators have abusively called heathen, had much better and\r\nclearer ideas of justice and morality than are to be found in the Old\r\nTestament, so far as it is Jewish, or in the New. The answer of Solon on\r\nthe question, \"Which is the most perfect popular govemment,\" has never\r\nbeen exceeded by any man since his time, as containing a maxim of\r\npolitical morality, \"That,\" says he, \"where the least injury done to\r\nthe meanest individual, is considered as an insult on the whole\r\nconstitution.\" Solon lived about 500 years before Christ.--Author.] but\r\nwhen it is said, as in the Testament, \"If a man smite thee on the right\r\ncheek, turn to him the other also,\" it is assassinating the dignity of\r\nforbearance, and sinking man into a spaniel.\r\n\r\nLoving, of enemies is another dogma of feigned morality, and has besides\r\nno meaning. It is incumbent on man, as a moralist, that he does not\r\nrevenge an injury; and it is equally as good in a political sense, for\r\nthere is no end to retaliation; each retaliates on the other, and calls\r\nit justice: but to love in proportion to the injury, if it could be\r\ndone, would be to offer a premium for a crime. Besides, the word enemies\r\nis too vague and general to be used in a moral maxim, which ought\r\nalways to be clear and defined, like a proverb. If a man be the enemy\r\nof another from mistake and prejudice, as in the case of religious\r\nopinions, and sometimes in politics, that man is different to an enemy\r\nat heart with a criminal intention; and it is incumbent upon us, and\r\nit contributes also to our own tranquillity, that we put the best\r\nconstruction upon a thing that it will bear. But even this erroneous\r\nmotive in him makes no motive for love on the other part; and to say\r\nthat we can love voluntarily, and without a motive, is morally and\r\nphysically impossible.\r\n\r\nMorality is injured by prescribing to it duties that, in the first\r\nplace, are impossible to be performed, and if they could be would be\r\nproductive of evil; or, as before said, be premiums for crime. The maxim\r\nof doing as we would be done unto does not include this strange doctrine\r\nof loving enemies; for no man expects to be loved himself for his crime\r\nor for his enmity.\r\n\r\nThose who preach this doctrine of loving their enemies, are in general\r\nthe greatest persecutors, and they act consistently by so doing; for the\r\ndoctrine is hypocritical, and it is natural that hypocrisy should act\r\nthe reverse of what it preaches. For my own part, I disown the doctrine,\r\nand consider it as a feigned or fabulous morality; yet the man does not\r\nexist that can say I have persecuted him, or any man, or any set of men,\r\neither in the American Revolution, or in the French Revolution; or that\r\nI have, in any case, returned evil for evil. But it is not incumbent on\r\nman to reward a bad action with a good one, or to return good for evil;\r\nand wherever it is done, it is a voluntary act, and not a duty. It\r\nis also absurd to suppose that such doctrine can make any part of a\r\nrevealed religion. We imitate the moral character of the Creator by\r\nforbearing with each other, for he forbears with all; but this doctrine\r\nwould imply that he loved man, not in proportion as he was good, but as\r\nhe was bad.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the nature of our condition here, we must see there is\r\nno occasion for such a thing as revealed religion. What is it we want\r\nto know? Does not the creation, the universe we behold, preach to us the\r\nexistence of an Almighty power, that governs and regulates the whole?\r\nAnd is not the evidence that this creation holds out to our senses\r\ninfinitely stronger than any thing we can read in a book, that any\r\nimposter might make and call the word of God? As for morality, the\r\nknowledge of it exists in every man's conscience.\r\n\r\nHere we are. The existence of an Almighty power is sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated to us, though we cannot conceive, as it is impossible we\r\nshould, the nature and manner of its existence. We cannot conceive how\r\nwe came here ourselves, and yet we know for a fact that we are here.\r\nWe must know also, that the power that called us into being, can if he\r\nplease, and when he pleases, call us to account for the manner in which\r\nwe have lived here; and therefore without seeking any other motive\r\nfor the belief, it is rational to believe that he will, for we know\r\nbeforehand that he can. The probability or even possibility of the thing\r\nis all that we ought to know; for if we knew it as a fact, we should be\r\nthe mere slaves of terror; our belief would have no merit, and our best\r\nactions no virtue.\r\n\r\nDeism then teaches us, without the possibility of being deceived, all\r\nthat is necessary or proper to be known. The creation is the Bible of\r\nthe deist. He there reads, in the hand-writing of the Creator himself,\r\nthe certainty of his existence, and the immutability of his power; and\r\nall other Bibles and Testaments are to him forgeries. The probability\r\nthat we may be called to account hereafter, will, to reflecting minds,\r\nhave the influence of belief; for it is not our belief or disbelief that\r\ncan make or unmake the fact. As this is the state we are in, and which\r\nit is proper we should be in, as free agents, it is the fool only, and\r\nnot the philosopher, nor even the prudent man, that will live as if\r\nthere were no God.\r\n\r\nBut the belief of a God is so weakened by being mixed with the strange\r\nfable of the Christian creed, and with the wild adventures related in\r\nthe Bible, and the obscurity and obscene nonsense of the Testament, that\r\nthe mind of man is bewildered as in a fog. Viewing all these things in\r\na confused mass, he confounds fact with fable; and as he cannot believe\r\nall, he feels a disposition to reject all. But the belief of a God is\r\na belief distinct from all other things, and ought not to be confounded\r\nwith any. The notion of a Trinity of Gods has enfeebled the belief of\r\none God. A multiplication of beliefs acts as a division of belief; and\r\nin proportion as anything is divided, it is weakened.\r\n\r\nReligion, by such means, becomes a thing of form instead of fact; of\r\nnotion instead of principle: morality is banished to make room for\r\nan imaginary thing called faith, and this faith has its origin in a\r\nsupposed debauchery; a man is preached instead of a God; an execution is\r\nan object for gratitude; the preachers daub themselves with the blood,\r\nlike a troop of assassins, and pretend to admire the brilliancy it gives\r\nthem; they preach a humdrum sermon on the merits of the execution; then\r\npraise Jesus Christ for being executed, and condemn the Jews for doing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA man, by hearing all this nonsense lumped and preached together,\r\nconfounds the God of the Creation with the imagined God of the\r\nChristians, and lives as if there were none.\r\n\r\nOf all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none\r\nmore derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant\r\nto reason, and more contradictory in itself, than this thing called\r\nChristianity. Too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too\r\ninconsistent for practice, it renders the heart torpid, or produces only\r\natheists and fanatics. As an engine of power, it serves the purpose of\r\ndespotism; and as a means of wealth, the avarice of priests; but so\r\nfar as respects the good of man in general, it leads to nothing here or\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe only religion that has not been invented, and that has in it every\r\nevidence of divine originality, is pure and simple deism. It must have\r\nbeen the first and will probably be the last that man believes. But pure\r\nand simple deism does not answer the purpose of despotic governments.\r\nThey cannot lay hold of religion as an engine but by mixing it with\r\nhuman inventions, and making their own authority a part; neither does it\r\nanswer the avarice of priests, but by incorporating themselves and their\r\nfunctions with it, and becoming, like the government, a party in the\r\nsystem. It is this that forms the otherwise mysterious connection of\r\nchurch and state; the church human, and the state tyrannic.\r\n\r\nWere a man impressed as fully and strongly as he ought to be with the\r\nbelief of a God, his moral life would be regulated by the force of\r\nbelief; he would stand in awe of God, and of himself, and would not do\r\nthe thing that could not be concealed from either. To give this belief\r\nthe full opportunity of force, it is necessary that it acts alone. This\r\nis deism.\r\n\r\nBut when, according to the Christian Trinitarian scheme, one part of God\r\nis represented by a dying man, and another part, called the Holy Ghost,\r\nby a flying pigeon, it is impossible that belief can attach itself to\r\nsuch wild conceits. [The book called the book of Matthew, says, (iii.\r\n16,) that the Holy Ghost descended in the shape of a dove. It might as\r\nwell have said a goose; the creatures are equally harmless, and the one\r\nis as much a nonsensical lie as the other. Acts, ii. 2, 3, says, that\r\nit descended in a mighty rushing wind, in the shape of cloven tongues:\r\nperhaps it was cloven feet. Such absurd stuff is fit only for tales of\r\nwitches and wizards.--Author.]\r\n\r\nIt has been the scheme of the Christian church, and of all the other\r\ninvented systems of religion, to hold man in ignorance of the Creator,\r\nas it is of government to hold him in ignorance of his rights.\r\nThe systems of the one are as false as those of the other, and are\r\ncalculated for mutual support. The study of theology as it stands in\r\nChristian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing;\r\nit rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no\r\ndata; it can demonstrate nothing; and admits of no conclusion. Not any\r\nthing can be studied as a science without our being in possession of the\r\nprinciples upon which it is founded; and as this is not the case with\r\nChristian theology, it is therefore the study of nothing.\r\n\r\nInstead then of studying theology, as is now done, out of the Bible and\r\nTestament, the meanings of which books are always controverted, and the\r\nauthenticity of which is disproved, it is necessary that we refer to the\r\nBible of the creation. The principles we discover there are eternal, and\r\nof divine origin: they are the foundation of all the science that exists\r\nin the world, and must be the foundation of theology.\r\n\r\nWe can know God only through his works. We cannot have a conception of\r\nany one attribute, but by following some principle that leads to it.\r\nWe have only a confused idea of his power, if we have not the means of\r\ncomprehending something of its immensity. We can have no idea of his\r\nwisdom, but by knowing the order and manner in which it acts. The\r\nprinciples of science lead to this knowledge; for the Creator of man is\r\nthe Creator of science, and it is through that medium that man can see\r\nGod, as it were, face to face.\r\n\r\nCould a man be placed in a situation, and endowed with power of vision\r\nto behold at one view, and to contemplate deliberately, the structure of\r\nthe universe, to mark the movements of the several planets, the cause\r\nof their varying appearances, the unerring order in which they revolve,\r\neven to the remotest comet, their connection and dependence on each\r\nother, and to know the system of laws established by the Creator, that\r\ngoverns and regulates the whole; he would then conceive, far beyond what\r\nany church theology can teach him, the power, the wisdom, the vastness,\r\nthe munificence of the Creator. He would then see that all the knowledge\r\nman has of science, and that all the mechanical arts by which he renders\r\nhis situation comfortable here, are derived from that source: his mind,\r\nexalted by the scene, and convinced by the fact, would increase in\r\ngratitude as it increased in knowledge: his religion or his worship\r\nwould become united with his improvement as a man: any employment he\r\nfollowed that had connection with the principles of the creation,--as\r\neverything of agriculture, of science, and of the mechanical arts,\r\nhas,--would teach him more of God, and of the gratitude he owes to\r\nhim, than any theological Christian sermon he now hears. Great objects\r\ninspire great thoughts; great munificence excites great gratitude; but\r\nthe grovelling tales and doctrines of the Bible and the Testament are\r\nfit only to excite contempt.\r\n\r\nThough man cannot arrive, at least in this life, at the actual scene I\r\nhave described, he can demonstrate it, because he has knowledge of the\r\nprinciples upon which the creation is constructed. We know that the\r\ngreatest works can be represented in model, and that the universe can be\r\nrepresented by the same means. The same principles by which we measure\r\nan inch or an acre of ground will measure to millions in extent. A\r\ncircle of an inch diameter has the same geometrical properties as a\r\ncircle that would circumscribe the universe. The same properties of a\r\ntriangle that will demonstrate upon paper the course of a ship, will\r\ndo it on the ocean; and, when applied to what are called the heavenly\r\nbodies, will ascertain to a minute the time of an eclipse, though those\r\nbodies are millions of miles distant from us. This knowledge is of\r\ndivine origin; and it is from the Bible of the creation that man has\r\nlearned it, and not from the stupid Bible of the church, that teaches\r\nman nothing. [The Bible-makers have undertaken to give us, in the first\r\nchapter of Genesis, an account of the creation; and in doing this they\r\nhave demonstrated nothing but their ignorance. They make there to have\r\nbeen three days and three nights, evenings and mornings, before there\r\nwas any sun; when it is the presence or absence of the sun that is the\r\ncause of day and night--and what is called his rising and setting that\r\nof morning and evening. Besides, it is a puerile and pitiful idea, to\r\nsuppose the Almighty to say, \"Let there be light.\" It is the imperative\r\nmanner of speaking that a conjuror uses when he says to his cups and\r\nballs, Presto, be gone--and most probably has been taken from it,\r\nas Moses and his rod is a conjuror and his wand. Longinus calls this\r\nexpression the sublime; and by the same rule the conjurer is sublime\r\ntoo; for the manner of speaking is expressively and grammatically the\r\nsame. When authors and critics talk of the sublime, they see not how\r\nnearly it borders on the ridiculous. The sublime of the critics, like\r\nsome parts of Edmund Burke's sublime and beautiful, is like a windmill\r\njust visible in a fog, which imagination might distort into a flying\r\nmountain, or an archangel, or a flock of wild geese.--Author.]\r\n\r\nAll the knowledge man has of science and of machinery, by the aid of\r\nwhich his existence is rendered comfortable upon earth, and without\r\nwhich he would be scarcely distinguishable in appearance and condition\r\nfrom a common animal, comes from the great machine and structure of the\r\nuniverse. The constant and unwearied observations of our ancestors\r\nupon the movements and revolutions of the heavenly bodies, in what are\r\nsupposed to have been the early ages of the world, have brought this\r\nknowledge upon earth. It is not Moses and the prophets, nor Jesus\r\nChrist, nor his apostles, that have done it. The Almighty is the great\r\nmechanic of the creation, the first philosopher, and original teacher of\r\nall science. Let us then learn to reverence our master, and not forget\r\nthe labours of our ancestors.\r\n\r\nHad we, at this day, no knowledge of machinery, and were it possible\r\nthat man could have a view, as I have before described, of the structure\r\nand machinery of the universe, he would soon conceive the idea of\r\nconstructing some at least of the mechanical works we now have; and the\r\nidea so conceived would progressively advance in practice. Or could a\r\nmodel of the universe, such as is called an orrery, be presented before\r\nhim and put in motion, his mind would arrive at the same idea. Such an\r\nobject and such a subject would, whilst it improved him in knowledge\r\nuseful to himself as a man and a member of society, as well as\r\nentertaining, afford far better matter for impressing him with a\r\nknowledge of, and a belief in the Creator, and of the reverence and\r\ngratitude that man owes to him, than the stupid texts of the Bible and\r\nthe Testament, from which, be the talents of the preacher; what they\r\nmay, only stupid sermons can be preached. If man must preach, let him\r\npreach something that is edifying, and from the texts that are known to\r\nbe true.\r\n\r\nThe Bible of the creation is inexhaustible in texts. Every part of\r\nscience, whether connected with the geometry of the universe, with\r\nthe systems of animal and vegetable life, or with the properties of\r\ninanimate matter, is a text as well for devotion as for philosophy--for\r\ngratitude, as for human improvement. It will perhaps be said, that if\r\nsuch a revolution in the system of religion takes place, every preacher\r\nought to be a philosopher. Most certainly, and every house of devotion a\r\nschool of science.\r\n\r\nIt has been by wandering from the immutable laws of science, and the\r\nlight of reason, and setting up an invented thing called \"revealed\r\nreligion,\" that so many wild and blasphemous conceits have been formed\r\nof the Almighty. The Jews have made him the assassin of the human\r\nspecies, to make room for the religion of the Jews. The Christians have\r\nmade him the murderer of himself, and the founder of a new religion\r\nto supersede and expel the Jewish religion. And to find pretence and\r\nadmission for these things, they must have supposed his power or his\r\nwisdom imperfect, or his will changeable; and the changeableness of the\r\nwill is the imperfection of the judgement. The philosopher knows that\r\nthe laws of the Creator have never changed, with respect either to the\r\nprinciples of science, or the properties of matter. Why then is it to be\r\nsupposed they have changed with respect to man?\r\n\r\nI here close the subject. I have shown in all the foregoing parts of\r\nthis work that the Bible and Testament are impositions and forgeries;\r\nand I leave the evidence I have produced in proof of it to be refuted,\r\nif any one can do it; and I leave the ideas that are suggested in the\r\nconclusion of the work to rest on the mind of the reader; certain as\r\nI am that when opinions are free, either in matters of govemment or\r\nreligion, truth will finally and powerfully prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART II",
