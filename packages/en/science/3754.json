The grub.\r\n2. The grub digging its galleries in the trunk of the oak.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT CAPRICORN: THE MALE AND THE FEMALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT 1. The mole is fixed fore and aft, with a lashing of raphia,\r\nto a light horizontal cross-bar resting on two forks. The Necrophori,\r\nafter long tiring themselves in digging under the body, end by severing\r\nthe bonds.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT 2. A dead mouse is placed on the branches of a tuft of\r\nthyme. By dint of jerking, shaking and tugging at the body, the\r\nBurying-beetles succeed in extricating it from the twigs and bringing\r\nit down.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT 3. With a ligament of raphia, the Mole is fixed by the hind\r\nfeet to a twig planted vertically in the soil. The head and shoulders\r\ntouch the ground. By digging under these, the Necrophori at the same\r\ntime uproot the gibbet, which eventually falls, dragged over by the\r\nweight of its burden.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT 4. The stake is slanting; the Mole touches the ground, but\r\nat a point two inches from the base of the gibbet. The Burying-beetles\r\nbegin by digging to no purpose under the body. They make no attempt to\r\noverturn the stake. In this experiment they obtain the Mole at last by\r\nemploying the usual method, that is by gnawing the bond.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUEBOTTLE LAYING HER EGGS IN THE SLIT OF A DEAD BIRD'S BEAK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LYCOSA LIFTING HER WHITE BAG OF EGGS TOWARDS THE SUN, TO ASSIST THE\r\nHATCHING.\r\nThe Lycosa lying head downwards on the edge of her pit, holding in her\r\nhind-legs her white bag of eggs and lifting them towards the sun, to\r\nassist the hatching.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANDED EPEIRA INSCRIBING HER FLOURISH, AFTER FINISHING HER WEB.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANDED EPEIRA LETTING HERSELF DROP BY THE END OF HER THREAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANDED EPEIRA SWATHING HER CAPTURE.\r\nThe web has given way in many places during the struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSMIA-NESTS IN A BRAMBLE TWIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSMIA-NESTS INSIDE A REED.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL HIVE INVENTED BY THE AUTHOR TO STUDY THE OSMIA'S LAYING.\r\nIt consists of reed-stumps arranged Pan-pipe fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD NESTS USED BY THE OSMIA IN LAYING HER EGGS.\r\n\r\n1. Nest of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs.\r\n\r\n2. Osmia-grubs in empty shells of the Garden Snail.\r\n\r\n3. Nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLOW-WORM: a, male; b, female.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABBAGE CATERPILLAR: a, the caterpillars; b, the cocoons of their\r\nparasite, Microgaster glomeratus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERS OF INSTINCT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. THE HARMAS.\r\n\r\nThis is what I wished for, hoc erat in votis: a bit of land, oh, not so\r\nvery large, but fenced in, to avoid the drawbacks of a public way; an\r\nabandoned, barren, sun-scorched bit of land, favoured by thistles and\r\nby Wasps and Bees. Here, without fear of being troubled by the\r\npassers-by, I could consult the Ammophila and the Sphex (two species of\r\nDigger-or Hunting-wasps.--Translator's Note.) and engage in that\r\ndifficult conversation whose questions and answers have experiment for\r\ntheir language; here, without distant expeditions that take up my time,\r\nwithout tiring rambles that strain my nerves, I could contrive my plans\r\nof attack, lay my ambushes and watch their effects at every hour of the\r\nday. Hoc erat in votis. Yes, this was my wish, my dream, always\r\ncherished, always vanishing into the mists of the future.\r\n\r\nAnd it is no easy matter to acquire a laboratory in the open fields,\r\nwhen harassed by a terrible anxiety about one's daily bread. For forty\r\nyears have I fought, with steadfast courage, against the paltry plagues\r\nof life; and the long-wished-for laboratory has come at last. What it\r\nhas cost me in perseverance and relentless work I will not try to say.\r\nIt has come; and, with it--a more serious condition--perhaps a little\r\nleisure. I say perhaps, for my leg is still hampered with a few links\r\nof the convict's chain.\r\n\r\nThe wish is realized. It is a little late, O! my pretty insects! I\r\ngreatly fear that the peach is offered to me when I am beginning to\r\nhave no teeth wherewith to eat it. Yes, it is a little late: the wide\r\nhorizons of the outset have shrunk into a low and stifling canopy, more\r\nand more straitened day by day. Regretting nothing in the past, save\r\nthose whom I have lost; regretting nothing, not even my first youth;\r\nhoping nothing either, I have reached the point at which, worn out by\r\nthe experience of things, we ask ourselves if life be worth the living.\r\n\r\nAmid the ruins that surround me, one strip of wall remains standing,\r\nimmovable upon its solid base: my passion for scientific truth. Is that\r\nenough, O! my busy insects, to enable me to add yet a few seemly pages\r\nto your history? Will my strength not cheat my good intentions? Why,\r\nindeed, did I forsake you so long?\r\n\r\nFriends have reproached me for it. Ah, tell them, tell those friends,\r\nwho are yours as well as mine, tell them that it was not forgetfulness\r\non my part, not weariness, nor neglect: I thought of you; I was\r\nconvinced that the Cerceris' (A species of Digger-wasp.--Translator's\r\nNote.) cave had more fair secrets to reveal to us, that the chase of\r\nthe Sphex held fresh surprises in store. But time failed me; I was\r\nalone, deserted, struggling against misfortune. Before philosophizing,\r\none had to live. Tell them that, and they will pardon me.\r\n\r\nOthers have reproached me with my style, which has not the solemnity,\r\nnay, better, the dryness of the schools. They fear lest a page that is\r\nread without fatigue should not always be the expression of the truth.\r\nWere I to take their word for it, we are profound only on condition of\r\nbeing obscure. Come here, one and all of you--you, the sting-bearers,\r\nand you, the wing-cased armour-clads--take up my defence and bear\r\nwitness in my favour. Tell of the intimate terms on which I live with\r\nyou, of the patience with which I observe you, of the care with which I\r\nrecord your actions. Your evidence is unanimous: yes, my pages, though\r\nthey bristle not with hollow formulas nor learned smatterings, are the\r\nexact narrative of facts observed, neither more nor less; and whoso\r\ncares to question you in his turn will obtain the same replies.\r\n\r\nAnd then, my dear insects, if you cannot convince those good people,\r\nbecause you do not carry the weight of tedium, I, in my turn, will say\r\nto them:\r\n\r\n\"You rip up the animal and I study it alive; you turn it into an object\r\nof horror and pity, whereas I cause it to be loved; you labour in a\r\ntorture-chamber and dissecting-room, I make my observations under the\r\nblue sky, to the song of the Cicadae (The Cicada Cigale, an insect akin\r\nto the Grasshopper and found more particularly in the south of\r\nFrance.--Translator's Note.); you subject cell and protoplasm to\r\nchemical tests, I study instinct in its loftiest manifestations; you\r\npry into death, I pry into life. And why should I not complete my\r\nthought: the boars have muddied the clear stream; natural history,\r\nyouth's glorious study, has, by dint of cellular improvements, become a\r\nhateful and repulsive thing. Well, if I write for men of learning, for\r\nphilosophers, who, one day, will try to some extent to unravel the\r\ntough problem of instinct, I write also, I write above all things, for\r\nthe young, I want to make them love the natural history which you make\r\nthem hate; and that is why, while keeping strictly to the domain of\r\ntruth, I avoid your scientific prose, which too often, alas, seems\r\nborrowed from some Iroquois idiom!\"\r\n\r\nBut this is not my business for the moment: I want to speak of the bit\r\nof land long cherished in my plans to form a laboratory of living\r\nentomology, the bit of land which I have at last obtained in the\r\nsolitude of a little village. It is a \"harmas,\" the name given, in this\r\ndistrict (The country round Sérignan, in Provence.--Translator's\r\nNote.), to an untilled, pebbly expanse abandoned to the vegetation of\r\nthe thyme. It is too poor to repay the work of the plough; but the\r\nSheep passes there in spring, when it has chanced to rain and a little\r\ngrass shoots up.\r\n\r\nMy harmas, however, because of its modicum of red earth swamped by a\r\nhuge mass of stones, has received a rough first attempt at cultivation:\r\nI am told that vines once grew here. And, in fact, when we dig the\r\nground before planting a few trees, we turn up, here and there, remains\r\nof the precious stock, half carbonized by time. The three-pronged fork,\r\ntherefore, the only implement of husbandry that can penetrate such a\r\nsoil as this, has entered here; and I am sorry, for the primitive\r\nvegetation has disappeared. No more thyme, no more lavender, no more\r\nclumps of kermes-oak, the dwarf oak that forms forests across which we\r\nstep by lengthening our stride a little. As these plants, especially\r\nthe first two, might be of use to me by offering the Bees and Wasps a\r\nspoil to forage, I am compelled to reinstate them in the ground whence\r\nthey were driven by the fork.\r\n\r\nWhat abounds without my mediation is the invaders of any soil that is\r\nfirst dug up and then left for a time to its own resources. We have, in\r\nthe first rank, the couch-grass, that execrable weed which three years\r\nof stubborn warfare have not succeeded in exterminating. Next, in\r\nrespect of number, come the centauries, grim-looking one and all,\r\nbristling with prickles or starry halberds. They are the\r\nyellow-flowered centaury, the mountain centaury, the star-thistle and\r\nthe rough centaury: the first predominates. Here and there, amid their\r\ninextricable confusion, stands, like a chandelier with spreading orange\r\nflowers for lights, the fierce Spanish oyster-plant, whose spikes are\r\nstrong as nails. Above it towers the Illyrian cotton-thistle, whose\r\nstraight and solitary stalk soars to a height of three to six feet and\r\nends in large pink tufts. Its armour hardly yields before that of the\r\noyster-plant. Nor must we forget the lesser thistle-tribe, with, first\r\nof all, the prickly or \"cruel\" thistle, which is so well armed that the\r\nplant-collector knows not where to grasp it; next, the spear-thistle,\r\nwith its ample foliage, ending each of its veins with a spear-head;\r\nlastly, the black knap-weed, which gathers itself into a spiky knot. In\r\namong these, in long lines armed with hooks, the shoots of the blue\r\ndewberry creep along the ground. To visit the prickly thicket when the\r\nWasp goes foraging, you must wear boots that come to mid-leg or else\r\nresign yourself to a smarting in the calves. As long as the ground\r\nretains a few remnants of the vernal rains, this rude vegetation does\r\nnot lack a certain charm, when the pyramids of the oyster-plant and the\r\nslender branches of the cotton-thistle rise above the wide carpet\r\nformed by the yellow-flowered centaury's saffron heads; but let the\r\ndroughts of summer come and we see but a desolate waste, which the\r\nflame of a match would set ablaze from one end to the other. Such is,\r\nor rather was, when I took possession of it, the Eden of bliss where I\r\nmean to live henceforth alone with the insect. Forty years of desperate\r\nstruggle have won it for me.\r\n\r\nEden, I said; and, from the point of view that interests me, the\r\nexpression is not out of place. This cursed ground, which no one would\r\nhave had at a gift to sow with a pinch of turnip-seed, is an earthly\r\nparadise for the Bees and the Wasps. Its mighty growth of thistles and\r\ncentauries draws them all to me from everywhere around. Never, in my\r\ninsect-hunting memories, have I seen so large a population at a single\r\nspot; all the trades have made it their rallying-point. Here come\r\nhunters of every kind of game, builders in clay, weavers of cotton\r\ngoods, collectors of pieces cut from a leaf or the petals of a flower,\r\narchitects in paste-board, plasterers mixing mortar, carpenters boring\r\nwood, miners digging underground galleries, workers handling\r\ngoldbeater's skin and many more.\r\n\r\nWho is this one? An Anthidium. (A Cotton-bee.--Translator's Note.) She\r\nscrapes the cobwebby stalk of the yellow-flowered centaury and gathers\r\na ball of wadding which she carries off proudly in the tips of her\r\nmandibles. She will turn it, under ground, into cotton-felt satchels to\r\nhold the store of honey and the egg. And these others, so eager for\r\nplunder? They are Megachiles (Leaf-cutting Bees.--Translator's Note.),\r\ncarrying under their bellies their black, white, or blood-red\r\nreaping-brushes. They will leave the thistles to visit the neighbouring\r\nshrubs and there cut from the leaves oval pieces which will be made\r\ninto a fit receptacle to contain the harvest. And these, clad in black\r\nvelvet? They are Chalicodomae (Mason-bees.--Translator's Note.), who\r\nwork with cement and gravel. We could easily find their masonry on the\r\nstones in the harmas. And these, noisily buzzing with a sudden flight?\r\nThey are the Anthophorae (a species of Wild Bees.--Translator's Note.),\r\nwho live in the old walls and the sunny banks of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNow come the Osmiae. One stacks her cells in the spiral staircase of an\r\nempty snail-shell; another, attacking the pith of a dry bit of bramble,\r\nobtains for her grubs a cylindrical lodging and divides it into floors\r\nby means of partition-walls; a third employs the natural channel of a\r\ncut reed; a fourth is a rent-free tenant of the vacant galleries of\r\nsome Mason-bee. Here are the Macrocerae and the Eucerae, whose males\r\nare proudly horned; the Dasypodae, who carry an ample brush of bristles\r\non their hind-legs for a reaping implement; the Andrenae, so manyfold\r\nin species; the slender-bellied Halicti. (Osmiae, Macrocerae, Eucerae,\r\nDasypodae, Andrenae, and Halicti are all different species of Wild\r\nBees.--Translator's Note.) I omit a host of others. If I tried to\r\ncontinue this record of the guests of my thistles, it would muster\r\nalmost the whole of the honey-yielding tribe. A learned entomologist of\r\nBordeaux, Professor Pérez, to whom I submit the naming of my prizes,\r\nonce asked me if I had any special means of hunting, to send him so\r\nmany rarities and even novelties. I am not at all an experienced and\r\nstill less a zealous hunter, for the insect interests me much more when\r\nengaged in its work than when stuck on a pin in a cabinet. The whole\r\nsecret of my hunting is reduced to my dense nursery of thistles and\r\ncentauries.\r\n\r\nBy a most fortunate chance, with this populous family of\r\nhoney-gatherers was allied the whole hunting tribe. The builders' men\r\nhad distributed here and there, in the harmas, great mounds of sand and\r\nheaps of stones, with a view of running up some surrounding walls. The\r\nwork dragged on slowly; and the materials found occupants from the\r\nfirst year. The Mason-bees had chosen the interstices between the\r\nstones as a dormitory where to pass the night in serried groups. The\r\npowerful Eyed Lizard, who, when close-pressed, attacks wide-mouthed\r\nboth man and dog, had selected a cave wherein to lie in wait for the\r\npassing Scarab (A Dung-beetle known also as the Sacred\r\nBeetle.--Translator's Note.); the Black-eared Chat, garbed like a\r\nDominican, white-frocked with black wings, sat on the top stone,\r\nsinging his short rustic lay: his nest, with its sky-blue eggs, must be\r\nsomewhere in the heap. The little Dominican disappeared with the loads\r\nof stones. I regret him: he would have been a charming neighbour. The\r\nEyed Lizard I do not regret at all.\r\n\r\nThe sand sheltered a different colony. Here, the Bembeces (A species of\r\nDigger-wasps.--Translator's Note.) were sweeping the threshold of their\r\nburrows, flinging a curve of dust behind them; the Languedocian Sphex\r\nwas dragging her Ephippigera (A species of Green\r\nGrasshopper--Translator's Note.) by the antennae; a Stizus (A species\r\nof Hunting-wasp.--Translator's Note.) was storing her preserves of\r\nCicadellae. (Froghoppers--Translator's Note.) To my sorrow, the masons\r\nended by evicting the sporting tribe; but, should I ever wish to recall\r\nit, I have but to renew the mounds of sand: they will soon all be\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHunters that have not disappeared, their homes being different, are the\r\nAmmophilae, whom I see fluttering, one in spring, the others in autumn,\r\nalong the garden-walks and over the lawns, in search of a caterpillar;\r\nthe Pompili (The Pompilus is a species of Hunting-wasp known also as\r\nthe Ringed Calicurgus--Translator's Note.), who travel alertly, beating\r\ntheir wings and rummaging in every corner in quest of a Spider. The\r\nlargest of them waylays the Narbonne Lycosa (Known also as the\r\nBlack-bellied Tarantula--Translator's Note.), whose burrow is not\r\ninfrequent in the harmas. This burrow is a vertical well, with a curb\r\nof fescue-grass intertwined with silk. You can see the eyes of the\r\nmighty Spider gleam at the bottom of the den like little diamonds, an\r\nobject of terror to most. What a prey and what dangerous hunting for\r\nthe Pompilus! And here, on a hot summer afternoon, is the Amazon-ant,\r\nwho leaves her barrack-rooms in long battalions and marches far afield\r\nto hunt for slaves. We will follow her in her raids when we find time.\r\nHere again, around a heap of grasses turned to mould, are Scoliae\r\n(Large Hunting-wasps--Translator's Note.) an inch and a half long, who\r\nfly gracefully and dive into the heap, attracted by a rich prey, the\r\ngrubs of Lamellicorns, Oryctes, and Cetoniae. (Different species of\r\nBeetles. The Cetonia is the Rose-chafer--Translator's Note.)\r\n\r\nWhat subjects for study! And there are more to come. The house was as\r\nutterly deserted as the ground. When man was gone and peace assured,\r\nthe animal hastily seized on everything. The Warbler took up his abode\r\nin the lilac-shrubs; the Greenfinch settled in the thick shelter of the\r\ncypresses; the Sparrow carted rags and straw under every slate; the\r\nSerin-finch, whose downy nest is no bigger than half an apricot, came\r\nand chirped in the plane-tree tops; the Scops made a habit of uttering\r\nhis monotonous, piping note here, of an evening; the bird of Pallas\r\nAthene, the Owl, came hurrying along to hoot and hiss.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house is a large pond, fed by the aqueduct that\r\nsupplies the village pumps with water. Here, from half a mile and more\r\naround, come the Frogs and Toads in the lovers' season. The Natterjack,\r\nsometimes as large as a plate, with a narrow stripe of yellow down his\r\nback, makes his appointments here to take his bath; when the evening\r\ntwilight falls, we see hopping along the edge the Midwife Toad, the\r\nmale, who carries a cluster of eggs, the size of peppercorns, wrapped\r\nround his hind-legs: the genial paterfamilias has brought his precious\r\npacket from afar, to leave it in the water and afterwards retire under\r\nsome flat stone, whence he will emit a sound like a tinkling bell.\r\nLastly, when not croaking amid the foliage, the Tree-frogs indulge in\r\nthe most graceful dives. And so, in May, as soon as it is dark, the\r\npond becomes a deafening orchestra: it is impossible to talk at table,\r\nimpossible to sleep. We had to remedy this by means perhaps a little\r\ntoo rigorous. What could we do? He who tries to sleep and cannot needs\r\nbecome ruthless.\r\n\r\nBolder still, the Wasp has taken possession of the dwelling-house. On\r\nmy door-sill, in a soil of rubbish, nestles the White-banded Sphex:\r\nwhen I go indoors, I must be careful not to damage her burrows, not to\r\ntread upon the miner absorbed in her work. It is quite a quarter of a\r\ncentury since I last saw the saucy Cricket-hunter. When I made her\r\nacquaintance, I used to visit her at a few miles' distance: each time,\r\nit meant an expedition under the blazing August sun. To-day I find her\r\nat my door; we are intimate neighbours. The embrasure of the closed\r\nwindow provides an apartment of a mild temperature for the Pelopaeus.\r\n(A species of Mason-wasp--Translator's Note.) The earth-built nest is\r\nfixed against the freestone wall. To enter her home, the\r\nSpider-huntress uses a little hole left open by accident in the\r\nshutters. On the mouldings of the Venetian blinds, a few stray\r\nMason-bees build their group of cells; inside the outer shutters, left\r\najar, a Eumenes (Another Mason-wasp--Translator's Note.) constructs her\r\nlittle earthen dome, surmounted by a short, bell-mouthed neck. The\r\nCommon Wasp and the Polistes (A Wasp that builds her nest in\r\ntrees--Translator's Note.) are my dinner-guests: they visit my table to\r\nsee if the grapes served are as ripe as they look.\r\n\r\nHere surely--and the list is far from complete--is a company both\r\nnumerous and select, whose conversation will not fail to charm my\r\nsolitude, if I succeed in drawing it out, my dear beasts of former\r\ndays, my old friends, and others, more recent acquaintances, all are\r\nhere, hunting, foraging, building in close proximity. Besides, should\r\nwe wish to vary the scene of observation, the mountain (Mont Ventoux,\r\nan outlying summit of the Alps, 6,270 feet high.--Translator's Note.)\r\nis but a few hundred steps away, with its tangle of arbutus, rock-roses\r\nand arborescent heather; with its sandy spaces dear to the Bembeces;\r\nwith its marly slopes exploited by different Wasps and Bees. And that\r\nis why, foreseeing these riches, I have abandoned the town for the\r\nvillage and come to Sérignan to weed my turnips and water my lettuces.\r\n\r\nLaboratories are being founded at great expense, on our Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean coasts, where people cut up small sea-animals, of but\r\nmeagre interest to us; they spend a fortune on powerful microscopes,\r\ndelicate dissecting-instruments, engines of capture, boats,\r\nfishing-crews, aquariums, to find out how the yolk of an Annelid's (A\r\nred-blooded Worm.--Translator's Note.) egg is constructed, a question\r\nwhereof I have never yet been able to grasp the full importance; and\r\nthey scorn the little land-animal, which lives in constant touch with\r\nus, which provides universal psychology with documents of inestimable\r\nvalue, which too often threatens the public wealth by destroying our\r\ncrops. When shall we have an entomological laboratory for the study not\r\nof the dead insect, steeped in alcohol, but of the living insect; a\r\nlaboratory having for its object the instinct, the habits, the manner\r\nof living, the work, the struggles, the propagation of that little\r\nworld with which agriculture and philosophy have most seriously to\r\nreckon? To know thoroughly the history of the destroyer of our vines\r\nmight perhaps be more important than to know how this or that\r\nnerve-fibre of a Cirriped ends (Cirripeds are sea-animals with\r\nhair-like legs, including the Barnacles and Acorn-shells.--Translator's\r\nNote.); to establish by experiment the line of demarcation between\r\nintellect and instinct; to prove, by comparing facts in the zoological\r\nprogression, whether human reason be an irreducible faculty or not: all\r\nthis ought surely to take precedence of the number of joints in a\r\nCrustacean's antenna. These enormous questions would need an army of\r\nworkers; and we have not one. The fashion is all for the Mollusc and\r\nthe Zoophyte. (Zoophytes are plant-like sea-animals, including\r\nStar-fishes, Jelly-fishes, Sea-anemones, and Sponges.--Translator's\r\nNote.) The depths of the sea are explored with many drag-nets; the soil\r\nwhich we tread is consistently disregarded. While waiting for the\r\nfashion to change, I open my harmas laboratory of living entomology;\r\nand this laboratory shall not cost the ratepayers one farthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. THE GREEN GRASSHOPPER.\r\n\r\nWe are in the middle of July. The astronomical dog-days are just\r\nbeginning; but in reality the torrid season has anticipated the\r\ncalendar and for some weeks past the heat has been overpowering.\r\n\r\nThis evening in the village they are celebrating the National Festival.\r\n(The 14th of July, the anniversary of the fall of the\r\nBastille.--Translator's Note.) While the little boys and girls are\r\nhopping round a bonfire whose gleams are reflected upon the\r\nchurch-steeple, while the drum is pounded to mark the ascent of each\r\nrocket, I am sitting alone in a dark corner, in the comparative\r\ncoolness that prevails at nine o'clock, harking to the concert of the\r\nfestival of the fields, the festival of the harvest, grander by far\r\nthan that which, at this moment, is being celebrated in the village\r\nsquare with gunpowder, lighted torches, Chinese lanterns and, above\r\nall, strong drink. It has the simplicity of beauty and the repose of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIt is late; and the Cicadae are silent. Glutted with light and heat,\r\nthey have indulged in symphonies all the livelong day. The advent of\r\nthe night means rest for them, but a rest frequently disturbed. In the\r\ndense branches of the plane-trees a sudden sound rings out like a cry\r\nof anguish, strident and short. It is the desperate wail of the Cicada,\r\nsurprised in his quietude by the Green Grasshopper, that ardent\r\nnocturnal huntress, who springs upon him, grips him in the side, opens\r\nand ransacks his abdomen. An orgy of music, followed by butchery.\r\n\r\nI have never seen and never shall see that supreme expression of our\r\nnational revelry, the military review at Longchamp; nor do I much\r\nregret it. The newspapers tell me as much about it as I want to know.\r\nThey give me a sketch of the site. I see, installed here and there amid\r\nthe trees, the ominous Red Cross, with the legend, \"Military Ambulance;\r\nCivil Ambulance.\" There will be bones broken, apparently; cases of\r\nsunstroke; regrettable deaths, perhaps. It is all provided for and all\r\nin the programme.\r\n\r\nEven here, in my village, usually so peaceable, the festival will not\r\nend, I am ready to wager, without the exchange of a few blows, that\r\ncompulsory seasoning of a day of merry-making. No pleasure, it appears,\r\ncan be fully relished without an added condiment of pain.\r\n\r\nLet us listen and meditate far from the tumult. While the disembowelled\r\nCicada utters his protest, the festival up there in the plane-trees is\r\ncontinued with a change of orchestra. It is now the time of the\r\nnocturnal performers. Hard by the place of slaughter, in the green\r\nbushes, a delicate ear perceives the hum of the Grasshoppers. It is the\r\nsort of noise that a spinning-wheel makes, a very unobtrusive sound, a\r\nvague rustle of dry membranes rubbed together. Above this dull bass\r\nthere rises, at intervals, a hurried, very shrill, almost metallic\r\nclicking. There you have the air and the recitative, intersected by\r\npauses. The rest is the accompaniment.\r\n\r\nDespite the assistance of a bass, it is a poor concert, very poor\r\nindeed, though there are about ten executants in my immediate vicinity.\r\nThe tone lacks intensity. My old tympanum is not always capable of\r\nperceiving these subtleties of sound. The little that reaches me is\r\nextremely sweet and most appropriate to the calm of twilight. Just a\r\nlittle more breadth in your bow-stroke, my dear Green Grasshopper, and\r\nyour technique would be better than the hoarse Cicada's, whose name and\r\nreputation you have been made to usurp in the countries of the north.\r\n\r\nStill, you will never equal your neighbour, the little bell-ringing\r\nToad, who goes tinkling all round, at the foot of the plane-trees,\r\nwhile you click up above. He is the smallest of my batrachian folk and\r\nthe most venturesome in his expeditions.\r\n\r\nHow often, at nightfall, by the last glimmers of daylight, have I not\r\ncome upon him as I wandered through my garden, hunting for ideas!\r\nSomething runs away, rolling over and over in front of me. Is it a dead\r\nleaf blown along by the wind? No, it is the pretty little Toad\r\ndisturbed in the midst of his pilgrimage. He hurriedly takes shelter\r\nunder a stone, a clod of earth, a tuft of grass, recovers from his\r\nexcitement and loses no time in picking up his liquid note.\r\n\r\nOn this evening of national rejoicing, there are nearly a dozen of him\r\ntinkling against one another around me. Most of them are crouching\r\namong the rows of flower-pots that form a sort of lobby outside my\r\nhouse. Each has his own note, always the same, lower in one case,\r\nhigher in another, a short, clear note, melodious and of exquisite\r\npurity.\r\n\r\nWith their slow, rhythmical cadence, they seem to be intoning litanies.\r\n\"Cluck,\" says one; \"click,\" responds another, on a finer note; \"clock,\"\r\nadds a third, the tenor of the band. And this is repeated indefinitely,\r\nlike the bells of the village pealing on a holiday: \"cluck, click,\r\nclock; cluck, click, clock!\"\r\n\r\nThe batrachian choristers remind me of a certain harmonica which I used\r\nto covet when my six-year-old ear began to awaken to the magic of\r\nsounds. It consisted of a series of strips of glass of unequal length,\r\nhung on two stretched tapes. A cork fixed to a wire served as a hammer.\r\nImagine an unskilled hand striking at random on this key-board, with a\r\nsudden clash of octaves, dissonances and topsy-turvy chords; and you\r\nwill have a pretty clear idea of the Toads' litany.\r\n\r\nAs a song, this litany has neither head nor tail to it; as a collection\r\nof pure sounds, it is delicious. This is the case with all the music in\r\nnature's concerts. Our ear discovers superb notes in it and then\r\nbecomes refined and acquires, outside the realities of sound, that\r\nsense of order which is the first condition of beauty.\r\n\r\nNow this sweet ringing of bells between hiding-place and hiding-place\r\nis the matrimonial oratorio, the discreet summons which every Jack\r\nissues to his Jill. The sequel to the concert may be guessed without\r\nfurther enquiry; but what it would be impossible to foresee is the\r\nstrange finale of the wedding. Behold the father, in this case a real\r\npaterfamilias, in the noblest sense of the word, coming out of his\r\nretreat one day in an unrecognizable state. He is carrying the future,\r\ntight-packed around his hind-legs; he is changing houses laden with a\r\ncluster of eggs the size of peppercorns. His calves are girt, his\r\nthighs are sheathed with the bulky burden; and it covers his back like\r\na beggar's wallet, completely deforming him.\r\n\r\nWhither is he going, dragging himself along, incapable of jumping,\r\nthanks to the weight of his load? He is going, the fond parent, where\r\nthe mother refuses to go; he is on his way to the nearest pond, whose\r\nwarm waters are indispensable to the tadpoles' hatching and existence.\r\nWhen the eggs are nicely ripened around his legs under the humid\r\nshelter of a stone, he braves the damp and the daylight, he the\r\npassionate lover of dry land and darkness; he advances by short stages,\r\nhis lungs congested with fatigue. The pond is far away, perhaps; no\r\nmatter: the plucky pilgrim will find it.\r\n\r\nHe's there. Without delay, he dives, despite his profound antipathy to\r\nbathing; and the cluster of eggs is instantly removed by the legs\r\nrubbing against each other. The eggs are now in their element; and the\r\nrest will be accomplished of itself. Having fulfilled his obligation to\r\ngo right under, the father hastens to return to his well-sheltered\r\nhome. He is scarcely out of sight before the little black tadpoles are\r\nhatched and playing about. They were but waiting for the contact of the\r\nwater in order to burst their shells.\r\n\r\nAmong the singers in the July gloaming, one alone, were he able to vary\r\nhis notes, could vie with the Toad's harmonious bells. This is the\r\nlittle Scops-owl, that comely nocturnal bird of prey, with the round\r\ngold eyes. He sports on his forehead two small feathered horns which\r\nhave won for him in the district the name of Machoto banarudo, the\r\nHorned Owl. His song, which is rich enough to fill by itself the still\r\nnight air, is of a nerve-shattering monotony. With imperturbable and\r\nmeasured regularity, for hours on end, \"kew, kew,\" the bird spits out\r\nits cantata to the moon.\r\n\r\nOne of them has arrived at this moment, driven from the plane-trees in\r\nthe square by the din of the rejoicings, to demand my hospitality. I\r\ncan hear him in the top of a cypress near by. From up there, dominating\r\nthe lyrical assembly, at regular intervals he cuts into the vague\r\norchestration of the Grasshoppers and the Toads.\r\n\r\nHis soft note is contrasted, intermittently, with a sort of Cat's mew,\r\ncoming from another spot. This is the call of the Common Owl, the\r\nmeditative bird of Minerva. After hiding all day in the seclusion of a\r\nhollow olive-tree, he started on his wanderings when the shades of\r\nevening began to fall. Swinging along with a sinuous flight, he came\r\nfrom somewhere in the neighbourhood to the pines in my enclosure,\r\nwhence he mingles his harsh mewing, slightly softened by distance, with\r\nthe general concert.\r\n\r\nThe Green Grasshopper's clicking is too faint to be clearly perceived\r\namidst these clamourers; all that reaches me is the least ripple, just\r\nnoticeable when there is a moment's silence. He possesses as his\r\napparatus of sound only a modest drum and scraper, whereas they, more\r\nhighly privileged, have their bellows, the lungs, which send forth a\r\ncolumn of vibrating air. There is no comparison possible. Let us return\r\nto the insects.\r\n\r\nOne of these, though inferior in size and no less sparingly equipped,\r\ngreatly surpasses the Grasshopper in nocturnal rhapsodies. I speak of\r\nthe pale and slender Italian Cricket (Oecanthus pellucens, Scop.), who\r\nis so puny that you dare not take him up for fear of crushing him. He\r\nmakes music everywhere among the rosemary-bushes, while the Glow-worms\r\nlight up their blue lamps to complete the revels. The delicate\r\ninstrumentalist consists chiefly of a pair of large wings, thin and\r\ngleaming as strips of mica. Thanks to these dry sails, he fiddles away\r\nwith an intensity capable of drowning the Toads' fugue. His performance\r\nsuggests, but with more brilliancy, more tremolo in the execution, the\r\nsong of the Common Black Cricket. Indeed the mistake would certainly be\r\nmade by any one who did not know that, by the time the very hot weather\r\ncomes, the true Cricket, the chorister of spring, has disappeared. His\r\npleasant violin has been succeeded by another more pleasant still and\r\nworthy of special study. We shall return to him at an opportune moment.\r\n\r\nThese then, limiting ourselves to select specimens, are the principal\r\nparticipants in this musical evening: the Scops-owl, with his\r\nlanguorous solos; the Toad, that tinkler of sonatas; the Italian\r\nCricket, who scrapes the first string of a violin; and the Green\r\nGrasshopper, who seems to beat a tiny steel triangle.\r\n\r\nWe are celebrating to-day, with greater uproar than conviction, the new\r\nera, dating politically from the fall of the Bastille; they, with\r\nglorious indifference to human things, are celebrating the festival of\r\nthe sun, singing the happiness of existence, sounding the loud hosanna\r\nof the July heats.\r\n\r\nWhat care they for man and his fickle rejoicings! For whom or for what\r\nwill our squibs be spluttering a few years hence? Far-seeing indeed\r\nwould he be who could answer the question. Fashions change and bring us\r\nthe unexpected. The time-serving rocket spreads its sheaf of sparks for\r\nthe public enemy of yesterday, who has become the idol of to-day.\r\nTomorrow it will go up for somebody else.\r\n\r\nIn a century or two, will any one, outside the historians, give a\r\nthought to the taking of the Bastille? It is very doubtful. We shall\r\nhave other joys and also other cares.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little farther ahead. A day will come, so everything\r\nseems to tell us, when, after making progress upon progress, man will\r\nsuccumb, destroyed by the excess of what he calls civilization. Too\r\neager to play the god, he cannot hope for the animal's placid\r\nlongevity; he will have disappeared when the little Toad is still\r\nsaying his litany, in company with the Grasshopper, the Scops-owl and\r\nthe others. They were singing on this planet before us; they will sing\r\nafter us, celebrating what can never change, the fiery glory of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nI will dwell no longer on this festival and will become once more the\r\nnaturalist, anxious to obtain information concerning the private life\r\nof the insect. The Green Grasshopper (Locusta viridissima, Lin.) does\r\nnot appear to be common in my neighbourhood. Last year, intending to\r\nmake a study of this insect and finding my efforts to hunt it\r\nfruitless, I was obliged to have recourse to the good offices of a\r\nforest-ranger, who sent me a pair of couples from the Lagarde plateau,\r\nthat bleak district where the beech-tree begins its escalade of the\r\nVentoux.\r\n\r\nNow and then freakish fortune takes it into her head to smile upon the\r\npersevering. What was not to be found last year has become almost\r\ncommon this summer. Without leaving my narrow enclosure, I obtain as\r\nmany Grasshoppers as I could wish. I hear them rustling at night in the\r\ngreen thickets. Let us make the most of the windfall, which perhaps\r\nwill not occur again.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June my treasures are installed, in a sufficient number\r\nof couples, under a wire cover standing on a bed of sand in an earthen\r\npan. It is indeed a magnificent insect, pale-green all over, with two\r\nwhitish stripes running down its sides. Its imposing size, its slim\r\nproportions and its great gauze wings make it the most elegant of our\r\nLocustidae. I am enraptured with my captives. What will they teach me?\r\nWe shall see. For the moment, we must feed them.\r\n\r\nI offer the prisoners a leaf of lettuce. They bite into it, certainly,\r\nbut very sparingly and with a scornful tooth. It soon becomes plain\r\nthat I am dealing with half-hearted vegetarians. They want something\r\nelse: they are beasts of prey, apparently. But what manner of prey? A\r\nlucky chance taught me.\r\n\r\nAt break of day I was pacing up and down outside my door, when\r\nsomething fell from the nearest plane-tree with a shrill grating sound.\r\nI ran up and saw a Grasshopper gutting the belly of a struggling\r\nCicada. In vain the victim buzzed and waved his limbs: the other did\r\nnot let go, dipping her head right into the entrails and rooting them\r\nout by small mouthfuls.\r\n\r\nI knew what I wanted to know: the attack had taken place up above,\r\nearly in the morning, while the Cicada was asleep; and the plunging of\r\nthe poor wretch, dissected alive, had made assailant and assailed fall\r\nin a bundle to the ground. Since then I have repeatedly had occasion to\r\nwitness similar carnage.\r\n\r\nI have even seen the Grasshopper--the height of audacity, this--dart in\r\npursuit of a Cicada in mad flight. Even so does the Sparrow-hawk pursue\r\nthe Swallow in the sky. But the bird of prey here is inferior to the\r\ninsect. It attacks a weaker than itself. The Grasshopper, on the other\r\nhand, assaults a colossus, much larger than herself and stronger; and\r\nnevertheless the result of the unequal fight is not in doubt. The\r\nGrasshopper rarely fails with the sharp pliers of her powerful jaws to\r\ndisembowel her capture, which, being unprovided with weapons, confines\r\nitself to crying out and kicking.\r\n\r\nThe main thing is to retain one's hold of the prize, which is not\r\ndifficult in somnolent darkness. Any Cicada encountered by the fierce\r\nLocustid on her nocturnal rounds is bound to die a lamentable death.\r\nThis explains those sudden agonized notes which grate through the woods\r\nat late, unseasonable hours, when the cymbals have long been silent.\r\nThe murderess in her suit of apple-green has pounced on some sleeping\r\nCicada.\r\n\r\nMy boarders' menu is settled: I will feed them on Cicadae. They take\r\nsuch a liking to this fare that, in two or three weeks, the floor of\r\nthe cage is a knacker's yard strewn with heads and empty thoraces, with\r\ntorn-off wings and disjointed legs. The belly alone disappears almost\r\nentirely. This is the tit-bit, not very substantial, but extremely\r\ntasty, it would seem. Here, in fact, in the insect's crop, the syrup is\r\naccumulated, the sugary sap which the Cicada's gimlet taps from the\r\ntender bark. Is it because of this dainty that the prey's abdomen is\r\npreferred to any other morsel? It is quite possible.\r\n\r\nI do, in fact, with a view to varying the diet, decide to serve up some\r\nvery sweet fruits, slices of pear, grape-bits, bits of melon. All this\r\nmeets with delighted appreciation. The Green Grasshopper resembles the\r\nEnglish: she dotes on underdone meat seasoned with jelly. This perhaps\r\nis why, on catching the Cicada, she first rips up his paunch, which\r\nsupplies a mixture of flesh and preserves.\r\n\r\nTo eat Cicadae and sugar is not possible in every part of the country.\r\nIn the north, where she abounds, the Green Grasshopper would not find\r\nthe dish which attracts her so strongly here. She must have other\r\nresources. To convince myself of this, I give her Anoxiae (A. pilosa,\r\nFab.), the summer equivalent of the spring Cockchafer. The Beetle is\r\naccepted without hesitation. Nothing is left of him but the wing-cases,\r\nhead and legs. The result is the same with the magnificent plump Pine\r\nCockchafer (Melolontha fullo, Lin.), a sumptuous morsel which I find\r\nnext day eviscerated by my gang of knackers.\r\n\r\nThese examples teach us enough. They tell us that the Grasshopper is an\r\ninveterate consumer of insects, especially of those which are not\r\nprotected by too hard a cuirass; they are evidence of tastes which are\r\nhighly carnivorous, but not exclusively so, like those of the Praying\r\nMantis, who refuses everything except game. The butcher of the Cicadae\r\nis able to modify an excessively heating diet with vegetable fare.\r\nAfter meat and blood, sugary fruit-pulp; sometimes even, for lack of\r\nanything better, a little green stuff.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, cannibalism is prevalent. True, I never witness in my\r\nGrasshopper-cages the savagery which is so common in the Praying\r\nMantis, who harpoons her rivals and devours her lovers; but, if some\r\nweakling succumb, the survivors hardly ever fail to profit by his\r\ncarcass as they would in the case of any ordinary prey. With no\r\nscarcity of provisions as an excuse, they feast upon their defunct\r\ncompanion. For the rest, all the sabre-bearing clan display, in varying\r\ndegrees, a propensity for filling their bellies with their maimed\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, the Grasshoppers live together very peacefully in my\r\ncages. No serious strife ever takes place among them, nothing beyond a\r\nlittle rivalry in the matter of food. I hand in a piece of pear. A\r\nGrasshopper alights on it at once. Jealously she kicks away any one\r\ntrying to bite at the delicious morsel. Selfishness reigns everywhere.\r\nWhen she has eaten her fill, she makes way for another, who in her turn\r\nbecomes intolerant. One after the other, all the inmates of the\r\nmenagerie come and refresh themselves. After cramming their crops, they\r\nscratch the soles of their feet a little with their mandibles, polish\r\nup their forehead and eyes with a leg moistened with spittle and then,\r\nhanging to the trellis-work or lying on the sand in a posture of\r\ncontemplation, blissfully they digest and slumber most of the day,\r\nespecially during the hottest part of it.\r\n\r\nIt is in the evening, after sunset, that the troop becomes lively. By\r\nnine o'clock the animation is at its height. With sudden rushes they\r\nclamber to the top of the dome, to descend as hurriedly and climb up\r\nonce more. They come and go tumultuously, run and hop around the\r\ncircular track and, without stopping, nibble at the good things on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe males are stridulating by themselves, here and there, teasing the\r\npassing fair with their antennae. The future mothers stroll about\r\ngravely, with their sabre half-raised. The agitation and feverish\r\nexcitement means that the great business of pairing is at hand. The\r\nfact will escape no practised eye.\r\n\r\nIt is also what I particularly wish to observe. My wish is satisfied,\r\nbut not fully, for the late hours at which events take place did not\r\nallow me to witness the final act of the wedding. It is late at night\r\nor early in the morning that things happen.\r\n\r\nThe little that I see is confined to interminable preludes. Standing\r\nface to face, with foreheads almost touching, the lovers feel and sound\r\neach other for a long time with their limp antennae. They suggest two\r\nfencers crossing and recrossing harmless foils. From time to time, the\r\nmale stridulates a little, gives a few short strokes of the bow and\r\nthen falls silent, feeling perhaps too much overcome to continue.\r\nEleven o'clock strikes; and the declaration is not yet over. Very\r\nregretfully, but conquered by sleepiness, I quit the couple.\r\n\r\nNext morning, early, the female carries, hanging at the bottom of her\r\novipositor, a queer bladder-like arrangement, an opaline capsule, the\r\nsize of a large pea and roughly subdivided into a small number of\r\negg-shaped vesicles. When the insect walks, the thing scrapes along the\r\nground and becomes dirty with sticky grains of sand. The Grasshopper\r\nthen makes a banquet off this fertilizing capsule, drains it slowly of\r\nits contents, and devours it bit by bit; for a long time she chews and\r\nrechews the gummy morsel and ends by swallowing it all down. In less\r\nthan half a day, the milky burden has disappeared, consumed with zest\r\ndown to the last atom.\r\n\r\nThis inconceivable banquet must be imported, one would think, from\r\nanother planet, so far removed is it from earthly habits. What a\r\nsingular race are the Locustidae, one of the oldest in the animal\r\nkingdom on dry land and, like the Scolopendra and the Cephalopod,\r\nacting as a belated representative of the manners of antiquity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. THE EMPUSA.\r\n\r\nThe sea, life's first foster-mother, still preserves in her depths many\r\nof those singular and incongruous shapes which were the earliest\r\nattempts of the animal kingdom; the land, less fruitful, but with more\r\ncapacity for progress, has almost wholly lost the strange forms of\r\nother days. The few that remain belong especially to the series of\r\nprimitive insects, insects exceedingly limited in their industrial\r\npowers and subject to very summary metamorphoses, if to any at all. In\r\nmy district, in the front rank of those entomological anomalies which\r\nremind us of the denizens of the old coal-forests, stand the Mantidae,\r\nincluding the Praying Mantis, so curious in habits and structure. Here\r\nalso is the Empusa (E. pauperata, Latr.), the subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\nHer larva is certainly the strangest creature among the terrestrial\r\nfauna of Provence: a slim, swaying thing of so fantastic an appearance\r\nthat uninitiated fingers dare not lay hold of it. The children of my\r\nneighbourhood, impressed by its startling shape, call it \"the\r\nDevilkin.\" In their imaginations, the queer little creature savours of\r\nwitchcraft. One comes across it, though always sparsely, in spring, up\r\nto May; in autumn; and sometimes in winter, if the sun be strong. The\r\ntough grasses of the waste-lands, the stunted bushes which catch the\r\nsun and are sheltered from the wind by a few heaps of stones are the\r\nchilly Empusa's favourite abode.\r\n\r\nLet us give a rapid sketch of her. The abdomen, which always curls up\r\nso as to join the back, spreads paddle wise and twists into a crook.\r\nPointed scales, a sort of foliaceous expansions arranged in three rows,\r\ncover the lower surface, which becomes the upper surface because of the\r\ncrook aforesaid. The scaly crook is propped on four long, thin stilts,\r\non four legs armed with knee-pieces, that is to say, carrying at the\r\nend of the thigh, where it joins the shin, a curved, projecting blade\r\nnot unlike that of a cleaver.\r\n\r\nAbove this base, this four-legged stool, rises, at a sudden angle, the\r\nstiff corselet, disproportionately long and almost perpendicular. The\r\nend of this bust, round and slender as a straw, carries the\r\nhunting-trap, the grappling limbs, copied from those of the Mantis.\r\nThey consist of a terminal harpoon, sharper than a needle, and a cruel\r\nvice, with the jaws toothed like a saw. The jaw formed by the arm\r\nproper is hollowed into a groove and carries on either side five long\r\nspikes, with smaller indentations in between. The jaw formed by the\r\nforearm is similarly furrowed, but its double saw, which fits into the\r\ngroove of the upper arm when at rest, is formed of finer, closer and\r\nmore regular teeth. The magnifying-glass reveals a score of equal\r\npoints in each row. The machine only lacks size to be a fearful\r\nimplement of torture.\r\n\r\nThe head is in keeping with this arsenal. What a queer-shaped head it\r\nis! A pointed face, with walrus moustaches furnished by the palpi;\r\nlarge goggle eyes; between them, a dirk, a halberd blade; and, on the\r\nforehead a mad, unheard of thing: a sort of tall mitre, an extravagant\r\nhead-dress that juts forward, spreading right and left into peaked\r\nwings and cleft along the top. What does the Devilkin want with that\r\nmonstrous pointed cap, than which no wise man of the East, no\r\nastrologer of old ever wore a more splendiferous? This we shall learn\r\nwhen we see her out hunting.\r\n\r\nThe dress is commonplace; grey tints predominate. Towards the end of\r\nthe larval period, after a few moultings, it begins to give a glimpse\r\nof the adult's richer livery and becomes striped, still very faintly,\r\nwith pale-green, white and pink. Already the two sexes are\r\ndistinguished by their antennae. Those of the future mothers are\r\nthread-like; those of the future males are distended into a spindle at\r\nthe lower half, forming a case or sheath whence graceful plumes will\r\nspring at a later date.\r\n\r\nBehold the creature, worthy of a Callot's fantastic pencil. (Jacques\r\nCallot (1592-1635), the French engraver and painter, famed for the\r\ngrotesque nature of his subjects.--Translator's Note.) If you come\r\nacross it in the bramble-bushes, it sways upon its four stilts, it wags\r\nits head, it looks at you with a knowing air, it twists its mitre round\r\nand peers over its shoulder. You seem to read mischief in its pointed\r\nface. You try to take hold of it. The imposing attitude ceases\r\nforthwith, the raised corselet is lowered and the creature makes off\r\nwith mighty strides, helping itself along with its fighting-limbs,\r\nwhich clutch the twigs. The flight need not last long, if you have a\r\npractised eye. The Empusa is captured, put into a screw of paper, which\r\nwill save her frail limbs from sprains, and lastly penned in a\r\nwire-gauze cage. In this way, in October, I obtain a flock sufficient\r\nfor my purpose.\r\n\r\nHow to feed them? My Devilkins are very little; they are a month or two\r\nold at most. I give them Locusts suited to their size, the smallest\r\nthat I can find. They refuse them. Nay more, they are frightened of\r\nthem. Should a thoughtless Locust meekly approach one of the Empusae,\r\nsuspended by her four hind-legs to the trellised dome, the intruder\r\nmeets with a bad reception. The pointed mitre is lowered; and an angry\r\nthrust sends him rolling. We have it: the wizard's cap is a defensive\r\nweapon, a protective crest. The Ram charges with his forehead, the\r\nEmpusa butts with her mitre.\r\n\r\nBut this does not mean dinner. I serve up the House-fly, alive. She is\r\naccepted, without hesitation. The moment that the Fly comes within\r\nreach, the watchful Devilkin turns her head, bends the stalk of her\r\ncorselet slantwise and, flinging out her fore-limb, harpoons the Fly\r\nand grips her between her two saws. No Cat pouncing upon a Mouse could\r\nbe quicker.\r\n\r\nThe game, however small, is enough for a meal. It is enough for the\r\nwhole day, often for several days. This is my first surprise: the\r\nextreme abstemiousness of these fiercely-armed insects. I was prepared\r\nfor ogres: I find ascetics satisfied with a meagre collation at rare\r\nintervals. A Fly fills their belly for twenty-four hours at least.\r\n\r\nThus passes the late autumn: the Empusae, more and more temperate from\r\nday to day, hang motionless from the wire gauze. Their natural\r\nabstinence is my best ally, for Flies grow scarce; and a time comes\r\nwhen I should be hard put to it to keep the menageries supplied with\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nDuring the three winter months, nothing stirs. From time to time, on\r\nfine days, I expose the cage to the sun's rays, in the window. Under\r\nthe influence of this heat-bath, the captives stretch their legs a\r\nlittle, sway from side to side, make up their minds to move about, but\r\nwithout displaying any awakening appetite. The rare Midges that fall to\r\nmy assiduous efforts do not appear to tempt them. It is a rule for them\r\nto spend the cold season in a state of complete abstinence.\r\n\r\nMy cages tell me what must happen outside, during the winter. Ensconced\r\nin the crannies of the rockwork, in the sunniest places, the young\r\nEmpusae wait, in a state of torpor, for the return of the hot weather.\r\nNotwithstanding the shelter of a heap of stones, there must be painful\r\nmoments when the frost is prolonged and the snow penetrates little by\r\nlittle into the best-protected crevices. No matter: hardier than they\r\nlook, the refugees escape the dangers of the winter season. Sometimes,\r\nwhen the sun is strong, they venture out of their hiding-place and come\r\nto see if spring be nigh.\r\n\r\nSpring comes. We are in March. My prisoners bestir themselves, change\r\ntheir skin. They need victuals. My catering difficulties recommence.\r\nThe House-fly, so easy to catch, is lacking in these days. I fall back\r\nupon earlier Diptera: Eristales, or Drone-flies. The Empusa refuses\r\nthem. They are too big for her and can offer too strenuous a\r\nresistance. She wards off their approach with blows of her mitre.\r\n\r\nA few tender morsels, in the shape of very young Grasshoppers, are\r\nreadily accepted. Unfortunately, such windfalls do not often find their\r\nway into my sweeping-net. Abstinence becomes obligatory until the\r\narrival of the first Butterflies. Henceforth, Pieris brassicae, the\r\nWhite Cabbage Butterfly, will contribute the greater portion of the\r\nvictuals.\r\n\r\nLet loose in the wire cage, the Pieris is regarded as excellent game.\r\nThe Empusa lies in wait for her, seizes her, but releases her at once,\r\nlacking the strength to overpower her. The Butterfly's great wings,\r\nbeating the air, give her shock after shock and compel her to let go. I\r\ncome to the weakling's assistance and cut the wings of her prey with my\r\nscissors. The maimed ones, still full of life, clamber up the\r\ntrellis-work and are forthwith grabbed by the Empusae, who, in no way\r\nfrightened by their protests, crunch them up. The dish is to their\r\ntaste and, moreover, plentiful, so much so that there are always some\r\ndespised remnants.\r\n\r\nThe head only and the upper portion of the breast are devoured: the\r\nrest--the plump abdomen, the best part of the thorax, the legs and\r\nlastly, of course, the wing-stumps--is flung aside untouched. Does this\r\nmean that the tenderest and most succulent morsels are chosen? No, for\r\nthe belly is certainly more juicy; and the Empusa refuses it, though\r\nshe eats up her House-fly to the last particle. It is a strategy of\r\nwar. I am again in the presence of a neck-specialist as expert as the\r\nMantis herself in the art of swiftly slaying a victim that struggles\r\nand, in struggling, spoils the meal.\r\n\r\nOnce warned, I soon perceive that the game, be it Fly, Locust,\r\nGrasshopper, or Butterfly, is always struck in the neck, from behind.\r\nThe first bite is aimed at the point containing the cervical ganglia\r\nand produces sudden death or immobility. Complete inertia will leave\r\nthe consumer in peace, the essential condition of every satisfactory\r\nrepast.\r\n\r\nThe Devilkin, therefore, frail though she be, possesses the secret of\r\nimmediately destroying the resistance of her prey. She bites at the\r\nback of the neck first, in order to give the finishing stroke. She goes\r\non nibbling around the original attacking-point. In this way the\r\nButterfly's head and the upper part of the breast are disposed of. But,\r\nby that time, the huntress is surfeited: she wants so little! The rest\r\nlies on the ground, disdained, not for lack of flavour, but because\r\nthere is too much of it. A Cabbage Butterfly far exceeds the capacity\r\nof the Empusa's stomach. The Ants will benefit by what is left.\r\n\r\nThere is one other matter to be mentioned, before observing the\r\nmetamorphosis. The position adopted by the young Empusae in the\r\nwire-gauze cage is invariably the same from start to finish. Gripping\r\nthe trellis-work by the claws of its four hind-legs, the insect\r\noccupies the top of the dome and hangs motionless, back downwards, with\r\nthe whole of its body supported by the four suspension-points. If it\r\nwishes to move, the front harpoons open, stretch out, grasp a mesh and\r\ndraw it to them. When the short walk is over, the lethal arms are\r\nbrought back against the chest. One may say that it is nearly always\r\nthe four hind-shanks which alone support the suspended insect.\r\n\r\nAnd this reversed position, which seems to us so trying, lasts for no\r\nshort while: it is prolonged, in my cages, for ten months without a\r\nbreak. The Fly on the ceiling, it is true, occupies the same attitude;\r\nbut she has her moments of rest: she flies, she walks in a normal\r\nposture, she spreads herself flat in the sun. Besides, her acrobatic\r\nfeats do not cover a long period. The Empusa, on the other hand,\r\nmaintains her curious equilibrium for ten months on end, without a\r\nbreak. Hanging from the trellis-work, back downwards, she hunts, eats,\r\ndigests, dozes, casts her skin, undergoes her transformation, mates,\r\nlays her eggs and dies. She clambered up there when she was still quite\r\nyoung; she falls down, full of days, a corpse.\r\n\r\nThings do not happen exactly like this under natural conditions. The\r\ninsect stands on the bushes back upwards; it keeps its balance in the\r\nregular attitude and turns over only in circumstances that occur at\r\nlong intervals. The protracted suspension of my captives is all the\r\nmore remarkable inasmuch as it is not at all an innate habit of their\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt reminds one of the Bats, who hang, head downwards, by their\r\nhind-legs from the roof of their caves. A special formation of the toes\r\nenables birds to sleep on one leg, which automatically and without\r\nfatigue clutches the swaying bough. The Empusa shows me nothing akin to\r\ntheir contrivance. The extremity of her walking-legs has the ordinary\r\nstructure: a double claw at the tip, a double steelyard-hook; and that\r\nis all.\r\n\r\nI could wish that anatomy would show me the working of the muscles and\r\nnerves in those tarsi, in those legs more slender than threads, the\r\naction of the tendons that control the claws and keep them gripped for\r\nten months, unwearied in waking and sleeping. If some dexterous scalpel\r\nshould ever investigate this problem, I can recommend another, even\r\nmore singular than that of the Empusa, the Bat and the bird. I refer to\r\nthe attitude of certain Wasps and Bees during the night's rest.\r\n\r\nAn Ammophila with red fore-legs (A. holosericea) is plentiful in my\r\nenclosure towards the end of August and selects a certain\r\nlavender-border for her dormitory. At dusk, especially after a stifling\r\nday, when a storm is brewing, I am sure to find the strange sleeper\r\nsettled there. Never was more eccentric attitude adopted for a night's\r\nrest! The mandibles bite right into the lavender-stem. Its square shape\r\nsupplies a firmer hold than a round stalk would do. With this one and\r\nonly prop, the animal's body juts out stiffly, at full length, with\r\nlegs folded. It forms a right angle with the supporting axis, so much\r\nso that the whole weight of the insect, which has turned itself into\r\nthe arm of a lever rests upon the mandibles.\r\n\r\nThe Ammophila sleeps extended in space by virtue of her mighty jaws. It\r\ntakes an animal to think of a thing like that, which upsets all our\r\npreconceived ideas of repose. Should the threatening storm burst,\r\nshould the stalk sway in the wind, the sleeper is not troubled by her\r\nswinging hammock; at most, she presses her fore-legs for a moment\r\nagainst the tossed mast. As soon as equilibrium is restored, the\r\nfavourite posture, that of the horizontal lever, is resumed, perhaps\r\nthe mandibles, like the bird's toes, possess the faculty of gripping\r\ntighter in proportion to the rocking of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe Ammophila is not the only one to sleep in this singular position,\r\nwhich is copied by many others--Anthidia (Cotton-bees.--Translator's\r\nNote.), Odyneri (A genus of Mason-wasps.--Translator's Note.), Eucerae\r\n(A species of Burrowing-bees.--Translator's Note.)--and mainly by the\r\nmales. All grip a stalk with their mandibles and sleep with their\r\nbodies outstretched and their legs folded back. Some, the stouter\r\nspecies, allow themselves to rest the tip of their arched abdomen\r\nagainst the pole.\r\n\r\nThis visit to the dormitory of certain Wasps and Bees does not explain\r\nthe problem of the Empusa; it sets up another one, no less difficult.\r\nIt shows us how deficient we are in insight, when it comes to\r\ndifferentiating between fatigue and rest in the cogs of the animal\r\nmachine. The Ammophila, with the static paradox afforded by her\r\nmandibles; the Empusa, with her claws unwearied by ten months' hanging,\r\nleave the physiologist perplexed and make him wonder what really\r\nconstitutes rest. In absolute fact, there is no rest, apart from that\r\nwhich puts an end to life. The struggle never ceases; some muscle is\r\nalways toiling, some nerve straining. Sleep, which resembles a return\r\nto the peace of non-existence, is, like waking, an effort, here of the\r\nleg, of the curled tail; there of the claw, of the jaws.\r\n\r\nThe transformation is effected about the middle of May, and the adult\r\nEmpusa makes her appearance. She is even more remarkable in figure and\r\nattire than the Praying Mantis. Of her youthful eccentricities, she\r\nretains the pointed mitre, the saw-like arm-guards, the long bust, the\r\nknee-pieces, the three rows of scales on the lower surface of the\r\nbelly; but the abdomen is now no longer twisted into a crook and the\r\nanimal is comelier to look upon. Large pale-green wings, pink at the\r\nshoulder and swift in flight in both sexes, cover the belly, which is\r\nstriped white and green underneath. The male, the dandy sex, adorns\r\nhimself with plumed antennae, like those of certain Moths, the Bombyx\r\ntribe. In respect of size, he is almost the equal of his mate.\r\n\r\nSave for a few slight structural details, the Empusa is the Praying\r\nMantis. The peasant confuses them. When, in spring, he meets the mitred\r\ninsect, he thinks he sees the common Prègo-Dieu, who is a daughter of\r\nthe autumn. Similar forms would seem to indicate similarity of habits.\r\nIn fact, led away by the extraordinary armour, we should be tempted to\r\nattribute to the Empusa a mode of life even more atrocious than that of\r\nthe Mantis. I myself thought so at first; and any one, relying upon\r\nfalse analogies, would think the same. It is a fresh error: for all her\r\nwarlike aspect, the Empusa is a peaceful creature that hardly repays\r\nthe trouble of rearing.\r\n\r\nInstalled under the gauze bell, whether in assemblies of half a dozen\r\nor in separate couples, she at no time loses her placidity. Like the\r\nlarva, she is very abstemious and contents herself with a Fly or two as\r\nher daily ration.\r\n\r\nBig eaters are naturally quarrelsome. The Mantis, bloated with Locusts,\r\nsoon becomes irritated and shows fight. The Empusa, with her frugal\r\nmeals, does not indulge in hostile demonstrations. There is no strife\r\namong neighbours nor any of those sudden unfurlings of the wings so\r\ndear to the Mantis when she assumes the spectral attitude and puffs\r\nlike a startled Adder; never the least inclination for those cannibal\r\nbanquets whereat the sister who has been worsted in the fight is\r\ndevoured. Such atrocities or here unknown.\r\n\r\nUnknown also are tragic nuptials. The male is enterprising and\r\nassiduous and is subjected to a long trial before succeeding. For days\r\nand days he worries his mate, who ends by yielding. Due decorum is\r\npreserved after the wedding. The feathered groom retires, respected by\r\nhis bride, and does his little bit of hunting, without danger of being\r\napprehended and gobbled up.\r\n\r\nThe two sexes live together in peace and mutual indifference until the\r\nmiddle of July. Then the male, grown old and decrepit, takes counsel\r\nwith himself, hunts no more, becomes shaky in his walk, creeps down\r\nfrom the lofty heights of the trellised dome and at last collapses on\r\nthe ground. His end comes by a natural death. And remember that the\r\nother, the male of the Praying Mantis, ends in the stomach of his\r\ngluttonous spouse.\r\n\r\nThe laying follows close upon the disappearance of the males.\r\n\r\nOne word more on comparative manners. The Mantis goes in for battle and\r\ncannibalism; the Empusa is peaceable and respects her kind. To what\r\ncause are these profound moral differences due, when the organic\r\nstructure is the same? Perhaps to the difference of diet. Frugality, in\r\nfact, softens character, in animals as in men; gross feeding brutalizes\r\nit. The gormandizer gorged with meat and strong drink, a fruitful\r\nsource of savage outbursts, could not possess the gentleness of the\r\nascetic who dips his bread into a cup of milk. The Mantis is that\r\ngormandizer, the Empusa that ascetic.\r\n\r\nGranted. But whence does the one derive her voracious appetite, the\r\nother her temperate ways, when it would seem as though their almost\r\nidentical structure ought to produce an identity of needs? These\r\ninsects tell us, in their fashion, what many have already told us: that\r\npropensities and aptitudes do not depend exclusively upon anatomy; high\r\nabove the physical laws that govern matter rise other laws that govern\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. THE CAPRICORN.\r\n\r\nMy youthful meditations owe some happy moments to Condillac's famous\r\nstatue which, when endowed with the sense of smell, inhales the scent\r\nof a rose and out of that single impression creates a whole world of\r\nideas. (Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, Abbé de Mureaux (1715-80), the\r\nleading exponent of sensational philosophy. His most important work is\r\nthe \"Traité des sensations,\" in which he imagines a statue, organized\r\nlike a man, and endows it with the senses one by one, beginning with\r\nthat of smell. He argues by a process of imaginative reconstruction\r\nthat all human faculties and all human knowledge are merely transformed\r\nsensation, to the exclusion of any other principle, that, in short,\r\neverything has its source in sensation: man is nothing but what he has\r\nacquired.--Translator's Note.) My twenty-year-old mind, full of faith\r\nin syllogisms, loved to follow the deductive jugglery of the\r\nabbé-philosopher: I saw, or seemed to see, the statue take life in that\r\naction of the nostrils, acquiring attention, memory, judgment and all\r\nthe psychological paraphernalia, even as still waters are aroused and\r\nrippled by the impact of a grain of sand. I recovered from my illusion\r\nunder the instruction of my abler master, the animal. The Capricorn\r\nshall teach us that the problem is more obscure than the abbé led me to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nWhen wedge and mallet are at work, preparing my provision of firewood\r\nunder the grey sky that heralds winter, a favourite relaxation creates\r\na welcome break in my daily output of prose. By my express orders, the\r\nwoodman has selected the oldest and most ravaged trunks in his stack.\r\nMy tastes bring a smile to his lips; he wonders by what whimsy I prefer\r\nwood that is worm-eaten--chirouna, as he calls it--to sound wood which\r\nburns so much better. I have my views on the subject; and the worthy\r\nman submits to them.\r\n\r\nAnd now to us two, O my fine oak-trunk seamed with scars, gashed with\r\nwounds whence trickle the brown drops smelling of the tan-yard. The\r\nmallet drives home, the wedges bite, the wood splits. What do your\r\nflanks contain? Real treasures for my studies. In the dry and hollow\r\nparts, groups of various insects, capable of living through the bad\r\nseason of the year, have taken up their winter quarters: in the\r\nlow-roofed galleries, galleries which some Buprestis-beetle has built,\r\nOsmia-bees, working their paste of masticated leaves, have piled their\r\ncells, one above the other; in the deserted chambers and vestibules,\r\nMegachiles (Leaf-cutting Bees.--Translator's Note.) have arranged their\r\nleafy jars; in the live wood, filled with juicy saps, the larvae of the\r\nCapricorn (Cerambyx miles), the chief author of the oak's undoing, have\r\nset up their home.\r\n\r\nStrange creatures, of a verity, are these grubs, for an insect of\r\nsuperior organization: bits of intestines crawling about! At this time\r\nof year, the middle of autumn, I meet them of two different ages. The\r\nolder are almost as thick as one's finger; the others hardly attain the\r\ndiameter of a pencil. I find, in addition, pupae more or less fully\r\ncoloured, perfect insects, with a distended abdomen, ready to leave the\r\ntrunk when the hot weather comes again. Life inside the wood,\r\ntherefore, lasts three years. How is this long period of solitude and\r\ncaptivity spent? In wandering lazily through the thickness of the oak,\r\nin making roads whose rubbish serves as food. The horse in Job swallows\r\nthe ground in a figure of speech; the Capricorn's grub literally eats\r\nits way. (\"Chafing and raging, he swalloweth the ground, neither doth\r\nhe make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.\"--Job 39, 23\r\n(Douai version).--Translator's Note.) With its carpenter's gouge, a\r\nstrong black mandible, short, devoid of notches, scooped into a\r\nsharp-edged spoon, it digs the opening of its tunnel. The piece cut out\r\nis a mouthful which, as it enters the stomach, yields its scanty juices\r\nand accumulates behind the worker in heaps of wormed wood. The refuse\r\nleaves room in front by passing through the worker. A labour at once of\r\nnutrition and of road-making, the path is devoured while constructed;\r\nit is blocked behind as it makes way ahead. That, however, is how all\r\nthe borers who look to wood for victuals and lodging set about their\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFor the harsh work of its two gouges, or curved chisels, the larva of\r\nthe Capricorn concentrates its muscular strength in the front of its\r\nbody, which swells into a pestle-head. The Buprestis-grubs, those other\r\nindustrious carpenters, adopt a similar form; they even exaggerate\r\ntheir pestle. The part that toils and carves hard wood requires a\r\nrobust structure; the rest of the body, which has but to follow after,\r\ncontinues slim. The essential thing is that the implement of the jaws\r\nshould possess a solid support and a powerful motor. The Cerambyx-larva\r\nstrengthens its chisels with a stout, black, horny armour that\r\nsurrounds the mouth; yet, apart from its skull and its equipment of\r\ntools, the grub has a skin as fine as satin and white as ivory. This\r\ndead white comes from a copious layer of grease which the animal's\r\nspare diet would not lead us to suspect. True, it has nothing to do, at\r\nevery hour of the day and night, but gnaw. The quantity of wood that\r\npasses into its stomach makes up for the dearth of nourishing elements.\r\n\r\nThe legs, consisting of three pieces, the first globular, the last\r\nsharp-pointed, are mere rudiments, vestiges. They are hardly a\r\nmillimetre long. (.039 inch.--Translator's Note.) For this reason they\r\nare of no use whatever for walking; they do not even bear upon the\r\nsupporting surface, being kept off it by the obesity of the chest. The\r\norgans of locomotion are something altogether different. The grub of\r\nthe Capricorn moves at the same time on its back and belly; instead of\r\nthe useless legs of the thorax, it has a walking-apparatus almost\r\nresembling feet, which appear, contrary to every rule, on the dorsal\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe first seven segments of the abdomen have, both above and below, a\r\nfour-sided facet, bristling with rough protuberances. This the grub can\r\neither expand or contract, making it stick out or lie flat at will. The\r\nupper facets consist of two excrescences separated by the mid-dorsal\r\nline; the lower ones have not this divided appearance. These are the\r\norgans of locomotion, the ambulacra. When the larva wishes to move\r\nforwards, it expands its hinder ambulacra, those on the back as well as\r\nthose on the belly, and contracts its front ones. Fixed to the side of\r\nthe narrow gallery by their ridges, the hind-pads give the grub a\r\npurchase. The flattening of the fore-pads, by decreasing the diameter,\r\nallows it to slip forward and to take half a step. To complete the step\r\nthe hind-quarters have to be brought up the same distance. With this\r\nobject, the front pads fill out and provide support, while those behind\r\nshrink and leave free scope for their segments to contract.\r\n\r\nWith the double support of its back and belly, with alternate puffings\r\nand shrinkings, the animal easily advances or retreats along its\r\ngallery, a sort of mould which the contents fill without a gap. But if\r\nthe locomotory pads grip only on one side progress becomes impossible.\r\nWhen placed on the smooth wood of my table, the animal wriggles slowly;\r\nit lengthens and shortens without advancing by a hair's-breadth. Laid\r\non the surface of a piece of split oak, a rough, uneven surface, due to\r\nthe gash made by the wedge, it twists and writhes, moves the front part\r\nof its body very slowly from left to right and right to left, lifts it\r\na little, lowers it and begins again. These are the most extensive\r\nmovements made. The vestigial legs remain inert and absolutely useless.\r\nThen why are they there? It were better to lose them altogether, if it\r\nbe true that crawling inside the oak has deprived the animal of the\r\ngood legs with which it started. The influence of environment, so\r\nwell-inspired in endowing the grub with ambulatory pads, becomes a\r\nmockery when it leaves it these ridiculous stumps. Can the structure,\r\nperchance, be obeying other rules than those of environment?\r\n\r\nThough the useless legs, the germs of the future limbs, persist, there\r\nis no sign in the grub of the eyes wherewith the Cerambyx will be\r\nrichly gifted. The larva has not the least trace of organs of vision.\r\nWhat would it do with sight in the murky thickness of a tree-trunk?\r\nHearing is likewise absent. In the never-troubled silence of the oak's\r\ninmost heart, the sense of hearing would be a non-sense. Where sounds\r\nare lacking, of what use is the faculty of discerning them? Should\r\nthere be any doubts, I will reply to them with the following\r\nexperiment. Split lengthwise, the grub's abode leaves a half-tunnel\r\nwherein I can watch the occupant's doings. When left alone, it now\r\ngnaws the front of its gallery, now rests, fixed by its ambulacra to\r\nthe two sides of the channel. I avail myself of these moments of quiet\r\nto inquire into its power of perceiving sounds. The banging of hard\r\nbodies, the ring of metallic objects, the grating of a file upon a saw\r\nare tried in vain. The animal remains impassive. Not a wince, not a\r\nmovement of the skin; no sign of awakened attention. I succeed no\r\nbetter when I scratch the wood close by with a hard point, to imitate\r\nthe sound of some neighbouring larva gnawing the intervening thickness.\r\nThe indifference to my noisy tricks could be no greater in a lifeless\r\nobject. The animal is deaf.\r\n\r\nCan it smell? Everything tells us no. Scent is of assistance in the\r\nsearch for food. But the Capricorn grub need not go in quest of\r\neatables: it feeds on its home, it lives on the wood that gives it\r\nshelter. Let us make an attempt or two, however. I scoop in a log of\r\nfresh cypress-wood a groove of the same diameter as that of the natural\r\ngalleries and I place the worm inside it. Cypress-wood is strongly\r\nscented; it possesses in a high degree that resinous aroma which\r\ncharacterizes most of the pine family. Well, when laid in the\r\nodoriferous channel, the larva goes to the end, as far as it can go,\r\nand makes no further movement. Does not this placid quiescence point to\r\nthe absence of a sense of smell? The resinous flavour, so strange to\r\nthe grub which has always lived in oak, ought to vex it, to trouble it;\r\nand the disagreeable impression ought to be revealed by a certain\r\ncommotion, by certain attempts to get away. Well, nothing of the kind\r\nhappens: once the larva has found the right position in the groove, it\r\ndoes not stir. I do more: I set before it, at a very short distance, in\r\nits normal canal, a piece of camphor. Again, no effect. Camphor is\r\nfollowed by naphthaline. Still nothing. After these fruitless\r\nendeavours, I do not think that I am going too far when I deny the\r\ncreature a sense of smell.\r\n\r\nTaste is there, no doubt. But such taste! The food is without variety:\r\noak, for three years at a stretch, and nothing else. What can the\r\ngrub's palate appreciate in this monotonous fare? The tannic relish of\r\na fresh piece, oozing with sap, the uninteresting flavour of an\r\nover-dry piece, robbed of its natural condiment: these probably\r\nrepresent the whole gustative scale.\r\n\r\nThere remains touch, the far-spreading, passive sense common to all\r\nlive flesh that quivers under the goad of pain. The sensitive schedule\r\nof the Cerambyx-grub, therefore, is limited to taste and touch, both\r\nexceedingly obtuse. This almost brings us to Condillac's statue. The\r\nimaginary being of the philosopher had one sense only, that of smell,\r\nequal in delicacy to our own; the real being, the ravager of the oak,\r\nhas two, inferior, even when put together, to the former, which so\r\nplainly perceived the scent of a rose and distinguished it so clearly\r\nfrom any other. The real case will bear comparison with the fictitious.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the psychology of a creature possessing such a powerful\r\ndigestive organism combined with such a feeble set of senses? A vain\r\nwish has often come to me in my dreams; it is to be able to think, for\r\na few minutes, with the crude brain of my Dog, to see the world with\r\nthe faceted eyes of a Gnat. How things would change in appearance! They\r\nwould change much more if interpreted by the intellect of the grub.\r\nWhat have the lessons of touch and taste contributed to that\r\nrudimentary receptacle of impressions? Very little; almost nothing. The\r\nanimal knows that the best bits possess an astringent flavour; that the\r\nsides of a passage not carefully planed are painful to the skin. This\r\nis the utmost limit of its acquired wisdom. In comparison, the statue\r\nwith the sensitive nostrils was a marvel of knowledge, a paragon too\r\ngenerously endowed by its inventor. It remembered, compared, judged,\r\nreasoned: does the drowsily digesting paunch remember? Does it compare?\r\nDoes it reason? I defined the Capricorn-grub as a bit of an intestine\r\nthat crawls about. The undeniable accuracy of this definition provides\r\nme with my answer: the grub has the aggregate of sense-impressions that\r\na bit of an intestine may hope to have.\r\n\r\nAnd this nothing-at-all is capable of marvellous acts of foresight;\r\nthis belly, which knows hardly aught of the present, sees very clearly\r\ninto the future. Let us take an illustration on this curious subject.\r\nFor three years on end the larva wanders about in the thick of the\r\ntrunk; it goes up, goes down, turns to this side and that; it leaves\r\none vein for another of better flavour, but without moving too far from\r\nthe inner depths, where the temperature is milder and greater safety\r\nreigns. A day is at hand, a dangerous day for the recluse obliged to\r\nquit its excellent retreat and face the perils of the surface. Eating\r\nis not everything: we have to get out of this. The larva, so\r\nwell-equipped with tools and muscular strength, finds no difficulty in\r\ngoing where it pleases, by boring through the wood; but does the coming\r\nCapricorn, whose short spell of life must be spent in the open air,\r\npossess the same advantages? Hatched inside the trunk, will the\r\nlong-horned insect be able to clear itself a way of escape?\r\n\r\nThat is the difficulty which the worm solves by inspiration. Less\r\nversed in things of the future, despite my gleams of reason, I resort\r\nto experiment with a view to fathoming the question. I begin by\r\nascertaining that the Capricorn, when he wishes to leave the trunk, is\r\nabsolutely unable to make use of the tunnel wrought by the larva. It is\r\na very long and very irregular maze, blocked with great heaps of wormed\r\nwood. Its diameter decreases progressively from the final blind alley\r\nto the starting-point. The larva entered the timber as slim as a tiny\r\nbit of straw; it is to-day as thick as my finger. In its three years'\r\nwanderings it always dug its gallery according to the mould of its\r\nbody. Evidently, the road by which the larva entered and moved about\r\ncannot be the Capricorn's exit-way: his immoderate antennae, his long\r\nlegs, his inflexible armour-plates would encounter an insuperable\r\nobstacle in the narrow, winding corridor, which would have to be\r\ncleared of its wormed wood and, moreover, greatly enlarged. It would be\r\nless fatiguing to attack the untouched timber and dig straight ahead.\r\nIs the insect capable of doing so? We shall see.\r\n\r\nI make some chambers of suitable size in oak logs chopped in two; and\r\neach of my artificial cells receives a newly transformed Cerambyx, such\r\nas my provisions of firewood supply, when split by the wedge, in\r\nOctober. The two pieces are then joined and kept together with a few\r\nbands of wire. June comes. I hear a scraping inside my billets. Will\r\nthe Capricorns come out, or not? The delivery does not seem difficult\r\nto me: there is hardly three-quarters of an inch to pierce. Not one\r\nemerges. When all is silence, I open my apparatus. The captives, from\r\nfirst to last, are dead. A vestige of sawdust, less than a pinch of\r\nsnuff, represents all their work.\r\n\r\nI expected more from those sturdy tools, their mandibles. But, as I\r\nhave said elsewhere, the tool does not make the workman. In spite of\r\ntheir boring-implements, the hermits die in my cases for lack of skill.\r\nI subject others to less arduous tests. I enclose them in spacious\r\nreed-stumps, equal in diameter to the natal cell. The obstacle to be\r\npierced is the natural diaphragm, a yielding partition two or three\r\nmillimetres thick. (.078 to .117 inch.--Translator's Note.) Some free\r\nthemselves; others cannot. The less vibrant ones succumb, stopped by\r\nthe frail barrier. What would it be if they had to pass through a\r\nthickness of oak?\r\n\r\nWe are now persuaded: despite his stalwart appearance, the Capricorn is\r\npowerless to leave the tree-trunk by his unaided efforts. It therefore\r\nfalls to the worm, to the wisdom of that bit of an intestine, to\r\nprepare the way for him. We see renewed, in another form, the feats of\r\nprowess of the Anthrax, whose pupa, armed with trepans, bores through\r\nrock on the feeble Fly's behalf. Urged by a presentiment that to us\r\nremains an unfathomable mystery, the Cerambyx-grub leaves the inside of\r\nthe oak, its peaceful retreat, its unassailable stronghold, to wriggle\r\ntowards the outside, where lives the foe, the Woodpecker, who may\r\ngobble up the succulent little sausage. At the risk of its life, it\r\nstubbornly digs and gnaws to the very bark, of which it leaves no more\r\nintact than the thinnest film, a slender screen. Sometimes, even, the\r\nrash one opens the window wide.\r\n\r\nThis is the Capricorn's exit-hole. The insect will have but to file the\r\nscreen a little with its mandibles, to bump against it with its\r\nforehead, in order to bring it down; it will even have nothing to do\r\nwhen the window is free, as often happens. The unskilled carpenter,\r\nburdened with his extravagant head-dress, will emerge from the darkness\r\nthrough this opening when the summer heats arrive.\r\n\r\nAfter the cares of the future come the cares of the present. The larva,\r\nwhich has just opened the aperture of escape, retreats some distance\r\ndown its gallery and, in the side of the exit-way, digs itself a\r\ntransformation-chamber more sumptuously furnished and barricaded than\r\nany that I have ever seen. It is a roomy niche, shaped like a flattened\r\nellipsoid, the length of which reaches eighty to a hundred millimetres.\r\n(3 to 4 inches.--Translator's Note.) The two axes of the cross-section\r\nvary: the horizontal measures twenty-five to thirty millimetres (.975\r\nto 1.17 inch.--Translator's Note.); the vertical measures only fifteen.\r\n(.585 inch.--Translator's Note.) This greater dimension of the cell,\r\nwhere the thickness of the perfect insect is concerned, leaves a\r\ncertain scope for the action of its legs when the time comes for\r\nforcing the barricade, which is more than a close-fitting mummy-case\r\nwould do.\r\n\r\nThe barricade in question, a door which the larva builds to exclude the\r\ndangers from without, is two-and even three-fold. Outside, it is a\r\nstack of woody refuse, of particles of chopped timber; inside, a\r\nmineral hatch, a concave cover, all in one piece, of a chalky white.\r\nPretty often, but not always, there is added to these two layers an\r\ninner casing of shavings. Behind this compound door, the larva makes\r\nits arrangements for the metamorphosis. The sides of the chamber are\r\nrasped, thus providing a sort of down formed of ravelled woody fibres,\r\nbroken into minute shreds. The velvety matter, as and when obtained, is\r\napplied to the wall in a continuous felt at least a millimetre thick.\r\n(.039 inch.--Translator's Note.) The chamber is thus padded throughout\r\nwith a fine swan's-down, a delicate precaution taken by the rough worm\r\non behalf of the tender pupa.\r\n\r\nLet us hark back to the most curious part of the furnishing, the\r\nmineral hatch or inner door of the entrance. It is an elliptical\r\nskull-cap, white and hard as chalk, smooth within and knotted without,\r\nresembling more or less closely an acorn-cup. The knots show that the\r\nmatter is supplied in small, pasty mouthfuls, solidifying outside in\r\nslight projections which the insect does not remove, being unable to\r\nget at them, and polished on the inside surface, which is within the\r\nworm's reach. What can be the nature of that singular lid whereof the\r\nCerambyx furnishes me with the first specimen? It is as hard and\r\nbrittle as a flake of lime-stone. It can be dissolved cold in nitric\r\nacid, discharging little gaseous bubbles. The process of solution is a\r\nslow one, requiring several hours for a tiny fragment. Everything is\r\ndissolved, except a few yellowish flocks, which appear to be of an\r\norganic nature. As a matter of fact, a piece of the hatch, when\r\nsubjected to heat, blackens, proving the presence of an organic glue\r\ncementing the mineral matter. The solution becomes muddy if oxalate of\r\nammonia be added; it then deposits a copious white precipitate. These\r\nsigns indicate calcium carbonate. I look for urate of ammonia, that\r\nconstantly recurring product of the various stages of the\r\nmetamorphoses. It is not there: I find not the least trace of murexide.\r\nThe lid, therefore, is composed solely of carbonate of lime and of an\r\norganic cement, no doubt of an albuminous character, which gives\r\nconsistency to the chalky paste.\r\n\r\nHad circumstances served me better, I should have tried to discover in\r\nwhich of the worm's organs the stony deposit dwells. I am however,\r\nconvinced: it is the stomach, the chylific ventricle, that supplies the\r\nchalk. It keeps it separated from the food, either as original matter\r\nor as a derivative of the ammonium urate; it purges it of all foreign\r\nbodies, when the larval period comes to an end, and holds it in reserve\r\nuntil the time comes to disgorge it. This freestone factory causes me\r\nno astonishment: when the manufacturer undergoes his change, it serves\r\nfor various chemical works. Certain Oil-beetles, such as the Sitaris,\r\nlocate in it the urate of ammonia, the refuse of the transformed\r\norganism; the Sphex, the Pelopaei, the Scoliae use it to manufacture\r\nthe shellac wherewith the silk of the cocoon is varnished. Further\r\ninvestigations will only swell the aggregate of the products of this\r\nobliging organ.\r\n\r\nWhen the exit-way is prepared and the cell upholstered in velvet and\r\nclosed with a threefold barricade, the industrious worm has concluded\r\nits task. It lays aside its tools, sheds its skin and becomes a nymph,\r\na pupa, weakness personified, in swaddling-clothes, on a soft couch.\r\nThe head is always turned towards the door. This is a trifling detail\r\nin appearance; but it is everything in reality. To lie this way or that\r\nin the long cell is a matter of great indifference to the grub, which\r\nis very supple, turning easily in its narrow lodging and adopting\r\nwhatever position it pleases. The coming Capricorn will not enjoy the\r\nsame privileges. Stiffly girt in his horn cuirass, he will not be able\r\nto turn from end to end; he will not even be capable of bending, if\r\nsome sudden wind should make the passage difficult. He must absolutely\r\nfind the door in front of him, lest he perish in the casket. Should the\r\ngrub forget this little formality, should it lie down to its nymphal\r\nsleep with its head at the back of the cell, the Capricorn is\r\ninfallibly lost: his cradle becomes a hopeless dungeon.\r\n\r\nBut there is no fear of this danger: the knowledge of our bit of an\r\nintestine is too sound in things of the future for the grub to neglect\r\nthe formality of keeping its head to the door. At the end of spring,\r\nthe Capricorn, now in possession of his full strength, dreams of the\r\njoys of the sun, of the festivals of light. He wants to get out. What\r\ndoes he find before him? A heap of filings easily dispersed with his\r\nclaws; next, a stone lid which he need not even break into fragments:\r\nit comes undone in one piece; it is removed from its frame with a few\r\npushes of the forehead, a few tugs of the claws. In fact, I find the\r\nlid intact on the threshold of the abandoned cells. Last comes a second\r\nmass of woody remnants, as easy to disperse as the first. The road is\r\nnow free: the Cerambyx has but to follow the spacious vestibule, which\r\nwill lead him, without the possibility of mistake, to the exit. Should\r\nthe window not be open, all that he has to do is to gnaw through a thin\r\nscreen: an easy task; and behold him outside, his long antennae aquiver\r\nwith excitement.\r\n\r\nWhat have we learnt from him? Nothing, from him; much from his grub.\r\nThis grub, so poor in sensory organs, gives us no little food for\r\nreflection with its prescience. It knows that the coming Beetle will\r\nnot be able to cut himself a road through the oak and it bethinks\r\nitself of opening one for him at its own risk and peril. It knows that\r\nthe Cerambyx, in his stiff armour, will never be able to turn and make\r\nfor the orifice of the cell; and it takes care to fall into its nymphal\r\nsleep with its head to the door. It knows how soft the pupa's flesh\r\nwill be and upholsters the bedroom with velvet. It knows that the enemy\r\nis likely to break in during the slow work of the transformation and,\r\nto set a bulwark against his attacks, it stores a calcium pap inside\r\nits stomach. It knows the future with a clear vision, or, to be\r\naccurate, behaves as though it knew it. Whence did it derive the\r\nmotives of its actions? Certainly not from the experience of the\r\nsenses. What does it know of the outside world? Let us repeat, as much\r\nas a bit of an intestine can know. And this senseless creature fills us\r\nwith amazement! I regret that the clever logician, instead of\r\nconceiving a statue smelling a rose, did not imagine it gifted with\r\nsome instinct. How quickly he would have recognized that, quite apart\r\nfrom sense-impressions, the animal, including man, possesses certain\r\npsychological resources, certain inspirations that are innate and not\r\nacquired!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. THE BURYING-BEETLES: THE BURIAL.\r\n\r\nBeside the footpath in April lies the Mole, disembowelled by the\r\npeasant's spade; at the foot of the hedge the pitiless urchin has\r\nstoned to death the Lizard, who was about to don his green,\r\npearl-embellished costume. The passer-by has thought it a meritorious\r\ndeed to crush beneath his heel the chance-met Adder; and a gust of wind\r\nhas thrown a tiny unfeathered bird from its nest. What will become of\r\nthese little bodies and of so many other pitiful remnants of life? They\r\nwill not long offend our sense of sight and smell. The sanitary\r\nofficers of the fields are legion.\r\n\r\nAn eager freebooter, ready for any task, the Ant is the first to come\r\nhastening and begin, particle by particle, to dissect the corpse. Soon\r\nthe odour of the corpse attracts the Fly, the genitrix of the odious\r\nmaggot. At the same time, the flattened Silpha, the glistening,\r\nslow-trotting Horn-beetle, the Dermestes, powdered with snow upon the\r\nabdomen, and the slender Staphylinus, all, whence coming no one knows,\r\nhurry hither in squads, with never-wearied zeal, investigating, probing\r\nand draining the infection.\r\n\r\nWhat a spectacle, in the spring, beneath a dead Mole! The horror of\r\nthis laboratory is a beautiful sight for one who is able to observe and\r\nto meditate. Let us overcome our disgust; let us turn over the unclean\r\nrefuse with our foot. What a swarming there is beneath it, what a\r\ntumult of busy workers! The Silphae, with wing-cases wide and dark, as\r\nthough in mourning, fly distraught, hiding in the cracks in the soil;\r\nthe Saprini, of polished ebony which mirrors the sunlight, jog hastily\r\noff, deserting their workshop; the Dermestes, of whom one wears a\r\nfawn-coloured tippet, spotted with white, seek to fly away, but, tipsy\r\nwith their putrid nectar, tumble over and reveal the immaculate\r\nwhiteness of their bellies, which forms a violent contrast with the\r\ngloom of the rest of their attire.\r\n\r\nWhat were they doing there, all these feverish workers? They were\r\nmaking a clearance of death on behalf of life. Transcendent alchemists,\r\nthey were transforming that horrible putridity into a living and\r\ninoffensive product. They were draining the dangerous corpse to the\r\npoint of rendering it as dry and sonorous as the remains of an old\r\nslipper hardened on the refuse-heap by the frosts of winter and the\r\nheats of summer. They were working their hardest to render the carrion\r\ninnocuous.\r\n\r\nOthers will soon put in their appearance, smaller creatures and more\r\npatient, who will take over the relic and exploit it ligament by\r\nligament, bone by bone, hair by hair, until the whole has been resumed\r\nby the treasury of life. All honour to these purifiers! Let us put back\r\nthe Mole and go our way.\r\n\r\nSome other victim of the agricultural labours of spring--a Shrew-mouse,\r\nField-mouse, Mole, Frog, Adder, or Lizard--will provide us with the\r\nmost vigorous and famous of these expurgators of the soil. This is the\r\nBurying-beetle, the Necrophorus, so different from the cadaveric mob in\r\ndress and habits. In honour of his exalted functions he exhales an\r\nodour of musk; he bears a red tuft at the tip of his antennae; his\r\nbreast is covered with nankeen; and across his wing-cases he wears a\r\ndouble, scalloped scarf of vermilion. An elegant, almost sumptuous\r\ncostume, very superior to that of the others, but yet lugubrious, as\r\nbefits your undertaker's man.\r\n\r\nHe is no anatomical dissector, cutting his subject open, carving its\r\nflesh with the scalpel of his mandibles; he is literally a gravedigger,\r\na sexton. While the others--Silphae, Dermestes, Horn-beetles--gorge\r\nthemselves with the exploited flesh, without, of course, forgetting the\r\ninterests of the family, he, a frugal eater, hardly touches his booty\r\non his own account. He buries it entire, on the spot, in a cellar where\r\nthe thing, duly ripened, will form the diet of his larvae. He buries it\r\nin order to establish his progeny therein.\r\n\r\nThis hoarder of dead bodies, with his stiff and almost heavy movements,\r\nis astonishingly quick at storing away wreckage. In a shift of a few\r\nhours, a comparatively enormous animal--a Mole, for\r\nexample--disappears, engulfed by the earth. The others leave the dried,\r\nemptied carcass to the air, the sport of the winds for months on end;\r\nhe, treating it as a whole, makes a clean job of things at once. No\r\nvisible trace of his work remains but a tiny hillock, a burial-mound, a\r\ntumulus.\r\n\r\nWith his expeditious method, the Necrophorus is the first of the little\r\npurifiers of the fields. He is also one of the most celebrated of\r\ninsects in respect of his psychical capacities. This undertaker is\r\nendowed, they say, with intellectual faculties approaching to reason,\r\nsuch as are not possessed by the most gifted of the Bees and Wasps, the\r\ncollectors of honey or game. He is honoured by the two following\r\nanecdotes, which I quote from Lacordaire's \"Introduction to\r\nEntomology,\" the only general treatise at my disposal:\r\n\r\n\"Clairville,\" says the author, \"records that he saw a Necrophorus\r\nvespillo, who, wishing to bury a dead Mouse and finding the soil on\r\nwhich the body lay too hard, proceeded to dig a hole at some distance\r\nin soil more easily displaced. This operation completed, he attempted\r\nto bury the Mouse in this cavity, but, not succeeding, he flew away,\r\nreturning a few moments later accompanied by four of his fellows, who\r\nassisted him to move the Mouse and bury it.\"\r\n\r\nIn such actions, Lacordaire adds, we cannot refuse to admit the\r\nintervention of reason.\r\n\r\n\"The following case,\" he continues, \"recorded by Gledditsch, has also\r\nevery indication of the intervention of reason. One of his friends,\r\nwishing to desiccate a Frog, placed it on the top of a stick thrust\r\ninto the ground, in order to make sure that the Necrophori should not\r\ncome and carry it off. But this precaution was of no effect; the\r\ninsects, being unable to reach the Frog, dug under the stick and,\r\nhaving caused it to fall, buried it as well as the body.\" (\"Suites a\r\nBuffon. Introduction a l'entomologie\" volume 2 pages 460-61.--Author's\r\nNote.)\r\n\r\nTo grant, in the intellect of the insect, a lucid understanding of the\r\nrelations between cause and effect, between the end and the means, is\r\nan affirmation of serious import. I know of scarcely any better adapted\r\nto the philosophical brutalities of my time. But are these two little\r\nstories really true? Do they involve the consequences deduced from\r\nthem? Are not those who accept them as reliable testimony a little\r\nover-simple?\r\n\r\nTo be sure, simplicity is needed in entomology. Without a good dose of\r\nthis quality, a mental defect in the eyes of practical folk, who would\r\nbusy himself with the lesser creatures? Yes, let us be simple, without\r\nbeing childishly credulous. Before making insects reason, let us reason\r\na little ourselves; let us, above all, consult the experimental test. A\r\nfact gathered at hazard, without criticism, cannot establish a law.\r\n\r\nI do not propose, O valiant grave-diggers, to belittle your merits;\r\nsuch is far from being my intention. I have that in my notes, on the\r\nother hand, which will do you more honour than the case of the gibbet\r\nand the Frog; I have gleaned, for your benefit, examples of prowess\r\nwhich will shed a new lustre upon your reputation.\r\n\r\nNo, my intention is not to lessen your renown. However, it is not the\r\nbusiness of impartial history to maintain a given thesis; it follows\r\nwhither the facts lead it. I wish simply to question you upon the power\r\nof logic attributed to you. Do you or do you not enjoy gleams of\r\nreason? Have you within you the humble germ of human thought? That is\r\nthe problem before us.\r\n\r\nTo solve it we will not rely upon the accidents which good fortune may\r\nnow and again procure for us. We must employ the breeding-cage, which\r\nwill permit of assiduous visits, continued inquiry and a variety of\r\nartifices. But how populate the cage? The land of the olive-tree is not\r\nrich in Necrophori. To my knowledge it possesses only a single species,\r\nN. vestigator (Hersch.); and even this rival of the grave-diggers of\r\nthe north is pretty scarce. The discovery of three or four in the\r\ncourse of the spring was as much as my searches yielded in the old\r\ndays. This time, if I do not resort to the ruses of the trapper, I\r\nshall obtain them in no greater numbers; whereas I stand in need of at\r\nleast a dozen.\r\n\r\nThese ruses are very simple. To go in search of the layer-out of\r\nbodies, who exists only here and there in the country-side, would be\r\nalmost always waste of time; the favourable month, April, would elapse\r\nbefore my cage was suitably populated. To run after him is to trust too\r\nmuch to accident; so we will make him come to us by scattering in the\r\norchard an abundant collection of dead Moles. To this carrion, ripened\r\nby the sun, the insect will not fail to hasten from the various points\r\nof the horizon, so accomplished is he in the detection of such a\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nI make an arrangement with a gardener in the neighbourhood, who, two or\r\nthree times a week, supplements the penury of my acre and a half of\r\nstony ground, providing me with vegetables raised in a better soil. I\r\nexplain to him my urgent need of Moles, an indefinite number of moles.\r\nBattling daily with trap and spade against the importunate excavator\r\nwho uproots his crops, he is in a better position than any one else to\r\nprocure for me that which I regard for the moment as more precious than\r\nhis bunches of asparagus or his white-heart cabbages.\r\n\r\nThe worthy man at first laughs at my request, being greatly surprised\r\nby the importance which I attribute to the abhorrent creature, the\r\nDarboun; but at last he consents, not without a suspicion at the back\r\nof his mind that I am going to make myself a wonderful flannel-lined\r\nwaist-coat with the soft, velvety skins of the Moles, something good\r\nfor pains in the back. Very well. We settle the matter. The essential\r\nthing is that the Darbouns shall reach me.\r\n\r\nThey reach me punctually, by twos, by threes, by fours, packed in a few\r\ncabbage-leaves, at the bottom of the gardener's basket. The worthy man\r\nwho lent himself with such good grace to my strange requirements will\r\nnever guess how much comparative psychology will owe him! In a few days\r\nI was the possessor of thirty Moles, which were scattered here and\r\nthere, as they reached me, in bare portions of the orchard, amid the\r\nrosemary-bushes, the arbutus-trees, and the lavender-beds.\r\n\r\nNow it only remained to wait and to examine, several times a day, the\r\nunder-side of my little corpses, a disgusting task which any one would\r\navoid who had not the sacred fire in his veins. Only little Paul, of\r\nall the household, lent me the aid of his nimble hand to seize the\r\nfugitives. I have already stated that the entomologist has need of\r\nsimplicity of mind. In this important business of the Necrophori, my\r\nassistants were a child and an illiterate.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul's visits alternating with mine, we had not long to wait.\r\nThe four winds of heaven bore forth in all directions the odour of the\r\ncarrion; and the undertakers hurried up, so that the experiments, begun\r\nwith four subjects, were continued with fourteen, a number not attained\r\nduring the whole of my previous searches, which were unpremeditated and\r\nin which no bait was used as decoy. My trapper's ruse was completely\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nBefore I report the results obtained in the cage, let us for a moment\r\nstop to consider the normal conditions of the labours that fall to the\r\nlot of the Necrophori. The Beetle does not select his head of game,\r\nchoosing one in proportion to his strength, as do the predatory Wasps;\r\nhe accepts it as hazard presents it to him. Among his finds there are\r\nlittle creatures, such as the Shrew-mouse; animals of medium size, such\r\nas the Field-mouse; and enormous beasts, such as the Mole, the\r\nSewer-rat and the Snake, any of which exceeds the powers of excavation\r\nof a single grave-digger. In the majority of cases transportation is\r\nimpossible, so disproportioned is the burden to the motive-power. A\r\nslight displacement, caused by the effort of the insects' backs, is all\r\nthat can possibly be effected.\r\n\r\nAmmophilus and Cerceris, Sphex and Pompilus excavate their burrows\r\nwherever they please; they carry their prey thither on the wing, or, if\r\ntoo heavy, drag it afoot. The Necrophorus knows no such facilities in\r\nhis task. Incapable of carrying the monstrous corpse, no matter where\r\nencountered, he is forced to dig the grave where the body lies.\r\n\r\nThis obligatory place of sepulture may be in stony soil; it may occupy\r\nthis or that bare spot, or some other where the grass, especially the\r\ncouch-grass, plunges into the ground its inextricable network of little\r\ncords. There is a great probability, too, that a bristle of stunted\r\nbrambles may support the body at some inches from the soil. Slung by\r\nthe labourers' spade, which has just broken his back, the Mole falls\r\nhere, there, anywhere, at random; and where the body falls, no matter\r\nwhat the obstacles--provided they be not insurmountable--there the\r\nundertaker must utilize it.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of inhumation are capable of such variety as causes us\r\nalready to foresee that the Necrophorus cannot employ fixed methods in\r\nthe accomplishment of his labours. Exposed to fortuitous hazards, he\r\nmust be able to modify his tactics within the limits of his modest\r\nperceptions. To saw, to break, to disentangle, to lift, to shake, to\r\ndisplace: these are so many methods of procedure which are\r\nindispensable to the grave-digger in a predicament. Deprived of these\r\nresources, reduced to uniformity of method, the insect would be\r\nincapable of pursuing the calling which has fallen to its lot.\r\n\r\nWe see at once how imprudent it would be to draw conclusions from an\r\nisolated case in which rational coordination or premeditated intention\r\nmight appear to intervene. Every instinctive action no doubt has its\r\nmotive; but does the animal in the first place judge whether the action\r\nis opportune? Let us begin by a careful consideration of the creature's\r\nlabours; let us support each piece of evidence by others; and then we\r\nshall be able to answer the question.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, a word as to diet. A general scavenger, the\r\nBurying-beetle refuses nothing in the way of cadaveric putridity. All\r\nis good to his senses, feathered game or furry, provided that the\r\nburden do not exceed his strength. He exploits the batrachian or the\r\nreptile with no less animation, he accepts without hesitation\r\nextraordinary finds, probably unknown to his race, as witness a certain\r\nGold-fish, a red Chinese Carp, whose body, placed in one of my cages,\r\nwas instantly considered an excellent tit-bit and buried according to\r\nthe rules. Nor is butcher's meat despised. A mutton-cutlet, a strip of\r\nbeefsteak, in the right stage of maturity, disappeared beneath the\r\nsoil, receiving the same attention as those which were lavished on the\r\nMole or the Mouse. In short, the Necrophorus has no exclusive\r\npreferences; anything putrid he conveys underground.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of his industry, therefore, presents no sort of\r\ndifficulty. If one kind of game be lacking, some other--the first to\r\nhand--will very well replace it. Neither is there much trouble in\r\nestablishing the site of his industry. A capacious dish-cover of wire\r\ngauze is sufficient, resting on an earthen pan filled to the brim with\r\nfresh, heaped sand. To obviate criminal attempts on the part of the\r\nCats, whom the game would not fail to tempt, the cage is installed in a\r\nclosed room with glazed windows, which in winter is the refuge of the\r\nplants and in summer an entomological laboratory.\r\n\r\nNow to work. The Mole lies in the centre of the enclosure. The soil,\r\neasily shifted and homogeneous, realizes the best conditions for\r\ncomfortable work. Four Necrophori, three males and a female, are there\r\nwith the body. They remain invisible, hidden beneath the carcass, which\r\nfrom time to time seems to return to life, shaken from end to end by\r\nthe backs of the workers. An observer not in the secret would be\r\nsomewhat astonished to see the dead creature move. From time to time,\r\none of the sextons, almost always a male, emerges and goes the rounds\r\nof the animal, which he explores, probing its velvet coat. He hurriedly\r\nreturns, appears again, once more investigates and creeps back under\r\nthe corpse.\r\n\r\nThe tremors become more pronounced; the carcass oscillates, while a\r\ncushion of sand, pushed outward from below, grows up all about it. The\r\nMole, by reason of his own weight and the efforts of the grave-diggers,\r\nwho are labouring at their task beneath him, gradually sinks, for lack\r\nof support, into the undermined soil.\r\n\r\nPresently the sand which has been pushed outward quivers under the\r\nthrust of the invisible miners, slips into the pit and covers the\r\ninterred Mole. It is a clandestine burial. The body seems to disappear\r\nof itself, as though engulfed by a fluid medium. For a long time yet,\r\nuntil the depth is regarded as sufficient, the body will continue to\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\nIt is, when all is taken into account, a very simple operation. As the\r\ndiggers, underneath the corpse, deepen the cavity into which it sinks,\r\ntugged and shaken by the sextons, the grave, without their\r\nintervention, fills of itself by the mere downfall of the shaken soil.\r\nUseful shovels at the tips of their claws, powerful backs, capable of\r\ncreating a little earthquake: the diggers need nothing more for the\r\npractice of their profession. Let us add--for this is an essential\r\npoint--the art of continually jerking and shaking the body, so as to\r\npack it into a lesser volume and cause it to pass when passage is\r\nobstructed. We shall presently see that this art plays a part of the\r\ngreatest importance in the industry of the Necrophori.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has disappeared, the Mole is still far from having reached\r\nhis destination. Let us leave the undertakers to complete their task.\r\nWhat they are now doing below ground is a continuation of what they did\r\non the surface and would teach us nothing new. We will wait for two or\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nThe moment has come. Let us inform ourselves of what is happening down\r\nthere. Let us visit the retting-vat. I shall invite no one to be\r\npresent at the exhumation. Of those about me, only little Paul has the\r\ncourage to assist me.\r\n\r\nThe Mole is a Mole no longer, but a greenish horror, putrid, hairless,\r\nshrunk into a round, greasy mass. The thing must have undergone careful\r\nmanipulation to be thus condensed into a small volume, like a fowl in\r\nthe hands of the cook, and, above all, to be so completely deprived of\r\nits fur. Is this culinary procedure undertaken in respect of the\r\nlarvae, which might be incommoded by the fur? Or is it just a casual\r\nresult, a mere loss of hair due to putridity? I am not certain. But it\r\nis always the case that these exhumations, from first to last, have\r\nrevealed the furry game furless and the feathered game featherless,\r\nexcept for the tail-feathers and the pinion-feathers of the wings.\r\nReptiles and fish, on the other hand, retain their scales.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the unrecognizable thing which was once a Mole. The\r\ntit-bit lies in a spacious crypt, with firm walls, a regular workshop,\r\nworthy of being the bake-house of a Copris-beetle. Except for the fur,\r\nwhich is lying in scattered flocks, it is intact. The grave-diggers\r\nhave not eaten into it; it is the patrimony of the sons, not the\r\nprovision of the parents, who, in order to sustain themselves, levy at\r\nmost a few mouthfuls of the ooze of putrid humours.\r\n\r\nBeside the dish which they are kneading and protecting are two\r\nNecrophori; a couple, no more. Four collaborated in the burial. What\r\nhas become of the other two, both males? I find them hidden in the\r\nsoil, at a distance, almost at the surface.\r\n\r\nThis observation is not an isolated one. Whenever I am present at a\r\nburial undertaken by a squad in which the males, zealous one and all,\r\npredominate, I find presently, when the burial is completed, only one\r\ncouple in the mortuary cellar. Having lent their assistance, the rest\r\nhave discreetly retired.\r\n\r\nThese grave-diggers, in truth, are remarkable fathers. They have\r\nnothing of the happy-go-lucky paternal carelessness that is the general\r\nrule among insects, which plague and pester the mother for a moment\r\nwith their attentions and thereupon leave her to care for the\r\noffspring! But those who in the other races are unemployed in this case\r\nlabour valiantly, now in the interest of their own family, now for the\r\nsake of another's, without distinction. If a couple is in difficulties,\r\nhelpers arrive, attracted by the odour of carrion; anxious to serve a\r\nlady, they creep under the body, work at it with back and claw, bury it\r\nand then go their ways, leaving the householders to their happiness.\r\n\r\nFor some time longer these latter manipulate the morsel in concert,\r\nstripping it of fur or feather, trussing it and allowing it to simmer\r\nto the taste of the larvae. When all is in order, the couple go forth,\r\ndissolving their partnership, and each, following his fancy,\r\nrecommences elsewhere, even if only as a mere auxiliary.\r\n\r\nTwice and no oftener hitherto have I found the father preoccupied by\r\nthe future of his sons and labouring in order to leave them rich: it\r\nhappens with certain Dung-beetles and with the Necrophori, who bury\r\ndead bodies. Scavengers and undertakers both have exemplary morals. Who\r\nwould look for virtue in such a quarter?\r\n\r\nWhat follows--the larval existence and the metamorphosis--is a\r\nsecondary detail and, for that matter, familiar. It is a dry subject\r\nand I shall deal with it briefly. About the end of May, I exhume a\r\nBrown Rat, buried by the grave-diggers a fortnight earlier. Transformed\r\ninto a black, sticky jelly, the horrible dish provides me with fifteen\r\nlarvae, already, for the most part, of the normal size. A few adults,\r\nconnections, assuredly, of the brood, are also stirring amid the\r\ninfected mass. The period of hatching is over now; and food is\r\nplentiful. Having nothing else to do, the foster-parents have sat down\r\nto the feast with the nurselings.\r\n\r\nThe undertakers are quick at rearing a family. It is at most a\r\nfortnight since the Rat was laid in the earth; and here already is a\r\nvigorous population on the verge of the metamorphosis. Such precocity\r\namazes me. It would seem as though the liquefaction of carrion, deadly\r\nto any other stomach, is in this case a food productive of especial\r\nenergy, which stimulates the organism and accelerates its growth, so\r\nthat the victuals may be consumed before its approaching conversion\r\ninto mould. Living chemistry makes haste to outstrip the ultimate\r\nreactions of mineral chemistry.\r\n\r\nWhite, naked, blind, possessing the habitual attributes of life in\r\ndarkness, the larva, with its lanceolate outline, is slightly\r\nreminiscent of the grub of the Ground-beetle. The mandibles are black\r\nand powerful, making excellent scissors for dissection. The limbs are\r\nshort, but capable of a quick, toddling gait. The segments of the\r\nabdomen are armoured on the upper surface with a narrow reddish plate,\r\narmed with four tiny spikes, whose office apparently is to furnish\r\npoints of support when the larva quits the natal dwelling and dives\r\ninto the soil, there to undergo the transformation. The thoracic\r\nsegments are provided with wider plates, but unarmed.\r\n\r\nThe adults discovered in the company of their larval family, in this\r\nputridity that was a Rat, are all abominably verminous. So shiny and\r\nneat in their attire, when at work under the first Moles of April, the\r\nNecrophori, when June approaches, become odious to look upon. A layer\r\nof parasites envelops them; insinuating itself into the joints, it\r\nforms an almost continuous surface. The insect presents a misshapen\r\nappearance under this overcoat of vermin, which my hair-pencil can\r\nhardly brush aside. Driven off the belly, the horde make the tour of\r\nthe sufferer and encamp on his back, refusing to relinquish their hold.\r\n\r\nI recognize among them the Beetle's Gamasis, the Tick who so often\r\nsoils the ventral amethyst of our Geotrupes. No; the prizes of life do\r\nnot fall to the share of the useful. Necrophori and Geotrupes devote\r\nthemselves to works of general salubrity; and these two corporations,\r\nso interesting in the accomplishment of their hygienic functions, so\r\nremarkable for their domestic morality, are given over to the vermin of\r\npoverty. Alas, of this discrepancy between the services rendered and\r\nthe harshness of life there are many other examples outside the world\r\nof scavengers and undertakers!\r\n\r\nThe Burying-beetles display an exemplary domestic morality, but it does\r\nnot persist until the end. During the first fortnight of June, the\r\nfamily being sufficiently provided for, the sextons strike work and my\r\ncages are deserted, so far as the surface is concerned, in spite of new\r\narrivals of Mice and Sparrows. From time to time some grave-digger\r\nleaves the subsoil and comes crawling languidly in the fresh air.\r\n\r\nAnother rather curious fact now attracts my attention. All, as soon as\r\nthey emerge from underground, are cripples, whose limbs have been\r\namputated at the joints, some higher up, some lower down. I see one\r\nmutilated Beetle who has only one leg left entire. With this odd limb\r\nand the stumps of the others lamentably tattered, scaly with vermin, he\r\nrows himself, as it were, over the dusty surface. A comrade emerges,\r\none better off for legs, who finishes the cripple and cleans out his\r\nabdomen. So my thirteen remaining Necrophori end their days,\r\nhalf-devoured by their companions, or at least shorn of several limbs.\r\nThe pacific relations of the outset are succeeded by cannibalism.\r\n\r\nHistory tells us that certain peoples, the Massagetae and others, used\r\nto kill their aged folk in order to spare them the miseries of\r\nsenility. The fatal blow on the hoary skull was in their eyes an act of\r\nfilial piety. The Necrophori have their share of these ancient\r\nbarbarities. Full of days and henceforth useless, dragging out a weary\r\nexistence, they mutually exterminate one another. Why prolong the agony\r\nof the impotent and the imbecile?\r\n\r\nThe Massagetae might invoke, as an excuse for their atrocious custom, a\r\ndearth of provisions, which is an evil counsellor; not so the\r\nNecrophori, for, thanks to my generosity, victuals are superabundant,\r\nboth beneath the soil and on the surface. Famine plays no part in this\r\nslaughter. Here we have the aberration of exhaustion, the morbid fury\r\nof a life on the point of extinction. As is generally the case, work\r\nbestows a peaceable disposition on the grave-digger, while inaction\r\ninspires him with perverted tastes. Having no longer anything to do, he\r\nbreaks his fellow's limbs, eats him up, heedless of being mutilated or\r\neaten up himself. This is the ultimate deliverance of verminous old\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. THE BURYING-BEETLES: EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed to the rational prowess which has earned for the\r\nNecrophorus the better part of his renown and, to begin with, let us\r\nsubmit the case related by Clairville--that of the too hard soil and\r\nthe call for assistance--to experimental test.\r\n\r\nWith this object in view, I pave the centre of the space beneath the\r\ncover, level with the soil, with a brick and sprinkle the latter with a\r\nthin layer of sand. This will be the soil in which digging is\r\nimpracticable. All about it, for some distance and on the same level,\r\nspreads the loose soil, which is easy to dig.\r\n\r\nIn order to approximate to the conditions of the little story, I must\r\nhave a Mouse; with a Mole, a heavy mass, the work of removal would\r\nperhaps present too much difficulty. To obtain the Mouse I place my\r\nfriends and neighbours under requisition; they laugh at my whim but\r\nnone the less proffer their traps. Yet, the moment a Mouse is needed,\r\nthat very common animal becomes rare. Braving decorum in his speech,\r\nwhich follows the Latin of his ancestors, the Provençal says, but even\r\nmore crudely than in my translation: \"If you look for dung, the Asses\r\nbecome constipated!\"\r\n\r\nAt last I possess the Mouse of my dreams! She comes to me from that\r\nrefuge, furnished with a truss of straw, in which official charity\r\ngives the hospitality of a day to the beggar wandering over the face of\r\nthe fertile earth; from that municipal hostel whence one invariably\r\nemerges verminous. O Réaumur, who used to invite marquises to see your\r\ncaterpillars change their skins, what would you have said of a future\r\ndisciple conversant with such wretchedness as this? Perhaps it is well\r\nthat we should not be ignorant of it, so that we may take compassion on\r\nthe sufferings of beasts.\r\n\r\nThe Mouse so greatly desired is mine. I place her upon the centre of\r\nthe brick. The grave-diggers under the wire cover are now seven in\r\nnumber, of whom three are females. All have gone to earth: some are\r\ninactive, close to the surface; the rest are busy in their crypts. The\r\npresence of the fresh corpse is promptly perceived. About seven o'clock\r\nin the morning, three Necrophori hurry up, two males and a female. They\r\nslip under the Mouse, who moves in jerks, a sign of the efforts of the\r\nburying-party. An attempt is made to dig into the layer of sand which\r\nhides the brick, so that a bank of sand accumulates about the body.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of hours the jerks continue without results. I profit by\r\nthe circumstance to investigate the manner in which the work is\r\nperformed. The bare brick allows me to see what the excavated soil\r\nconcealed from me. If it is necessary to move the body, the Beetle\r\nturns over; with his six claws he grips the hair of the dead animal,\r\nprops himself upon his back and pushes, making a lever of his head and\r\nthe tip of his abdomen. If digging is required, he resumes the normal\r\nposition. So, turn and turn about, the sexton strives, now with his\r\nclaws in the air, when it is a question of shifting the body or\r\ndragging it lower down; now with his feet on the ground, when it is\r\nnecessary to deepen the grave.\r\n\r\nThe point at which the Mouse lies is finally recognized as\r\nunassailable. A male appears in the open. He explores the specimen,\r\ngoes the round of it, scratches a little at random. He goes back; and\r\nimmediately the body rocks. Is he advising his collaborators of what he\r\nhas discovered? Is he arranging matters with a view to their\r\nestablishing themselves elsewhere, on propitious soil?\r\n\r\nThe facts are far from confirming this idea. When he shakes the body,\r\nthe others imitate him and push, but without combining their efforts in\r\na given direction, for, after advancing a little towards the edge of\r\nthe brick, the burden goes back again, returning to the point of\r\ndeparture. In the absence of any concerted understanding, their efforts\r\nof leverage are wasted. Nearly three hours are occupied by oscillations\r\nwhich mutually annul one another. The Mouse does not cross the little\r\nsand-hill heaped about it by the rakes of the workers.\r\n\r\nFor the second time a male emerges and makes a round of exploration. A\r\nbore is made in workable earth, close beside the brick. This is a trial\r\nexcavation, to reveal the nature of the soil; a narrow well, of no\r\ngreat depth, into which the insect plunges to half its length. The\r\nwell-sinker returns to the other workers, who arch their backs, and the\r\nload progresses a finger's-breadth towards the point recognized as\r\nfavourable. Have they done the trick this time? No, for after a while\r\nthe Mouse recoils. No progress towards a solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nNow two males come out in search of information, each of his own\r\naccord. Instead of stopping at the point already sounded, a point most\r\njudiciously chosen, it seemed, on account of its proximity, which would\r\nsave laborious transportation, they precipitately scour the whole area\r\nof the cage, sounding the soil on this side and on that and ploughing\r\nsuperficial furrows in it. They get as far from the brick as the limits\r\nof the enclosure permit.\r\n\r\nThey dig, by preference, against the base of the cover; here they make\r\nseveral borings, without any reason, so far as I can see, the bed of\r\nsoil being everywhere equally assailable away from the brick; the first\r\npoint sounded is abandoned for a second, which is rejected in its turn.\r\nA third and a fourth are tried; then another and yet another. At the\r\nsixth point the selection is made. In all these cases the excavation is\r\nby no means a grave destined to receive the Mouse, but a mere trial\r\nboring, of inconsiderable depth, its diameter being that of the\r\ndigger's body.\r\n\r\nA return is made to the Mouse, who suddenly quivers, oscillates,\r\nadvances, recoils, first in one direction, then in another, until in\r\nthe end the little hillock of sand is crossed. Now we are free of the\r\nbrick and on excellent soil. Little by little the load advances. This\r\nis no cartage by a team hauling in the open, but a jerky displacement,\r\nthe work of invisible levers. The body seems to move of its own accord.\r\n\r\nThis time, after so many hesitations, their efforts are concerted; at\r\nall events, the load reaches the region sounded far more rapidly than I\r\nexpected. Then begins the burial, according to the usual method. It is\r\none o'clock. The Necrophori have allowed the hour-hand of the clock to\r\ngo half round the dial while verifying the condition of the surrounding\r\nspots and displacing the Mouse.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment it appears at the outset that the males play a major\r\npart in the affairs of the household. Better-equipped, perhaps, than\r\ntheir mates, they make investigations when a difficulty occurs; they\r\ninspect the soil, recognize whence the check arises and choose the\r\npoint at which the grave shall be made. In the lengthy experiment of\r\nthe brick, the two males alone explored the surroundings and set to\r\nwork to solve the difficulty. Confiding in their assistance, the\r\nfemale, motionless beneath the Mouse, awaited the result of their\r\ninvestigations. The tests which are to follow will confirm the merits\r\nof these valiant auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the point where the Mouse lay being recognized as\r\npresenting an insurmountable resistance, there was no grave dug in\r\nadvance, a little farther off, in the light soil. All attempts were\r\nlimited, I repeat, to shallow soundings which informed the insect of\r\nthe possibility of inhumation.\r\n\r\nIt is absolute nonsense to speak of their first preparing the grave to\r\nwhich the body will afterwards be carted. To excavate the soil, our\r\ngrave-diggers must feel the weight of their dead on their backs. They\r\nwork only when stimulated by the contact of its fur. Never, never in\r\nthis world do they venture to dig a grave unless the body to be buried\r\nalready occupies the site of the cavity. This is absolutely confirmed\r\nby my two and a half months and more of daily observations.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Clairville's anecdote bears examination no better. We are\r\ntold that the Necrophorus in difficulties goes in search of assistance\r\nand returns with companions who assist him to bury the Mouse. This, in\r\nanother form, is the edifying story of the Sacred Beetle whose pellet\r\nhad rolled into a rut, powerless to withdraw his treasure from the\r\ngulf, the wily Dung-beetle called together three or four of his\r\nneighbours, who benevolently recovered the pellet, returning to their\r\nlabours after the work of salvage.\r\n\r\nThe exploit--so ill-interpreted--of the thieving pill-roller sets me on\r\nmy guard against that of the undertaker. Shall I be too exigent if I\r\nenquire what precautions the observer adopted to recognize the owner of\r\nthe Mouse on his return, when he reappears, as we are told, with four\r\nassistants? What sign denotes that one of the five who was able, in so\r\nrational a manner, to appeal for help? Can one even be sure that the\r\none to disappear returns and forms one of the band? There is nothing to\r\nindicate it; and this was the essential point which a sterling observer\r\nwas bound not to neglect. Were they not rather five chance Necrophori\r\nwho, guided by the smell, without any previous understanding, hastened\r\nto the abandoned Mouse to exploit her on their own account? I incline\r\nto this opinion, the most likely of all in the absence of exact\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nProbability becomes certainty if we submit the case to the verification\r\nof experiment. The test with the brick already gives us some\r\ninformation. For six hours my three specimens exhausted themselves in\r\nefforts before they got to the length of removing their booty and\r\nplacing it on practicable soil. In this long and heavy task helpful\r\nneighbours would have been anything but unwelcome. Four other\r\nNecrophori, buried here and there under a little sand, comrades and\r\nacquaintances, helpers of the day before, were occupying the same cage;\r\nand not one of those concerned thought of summoning them to give\r\nassistance. Despite their extreme embarrassment, the owners of the\r\nMouse accomplished their task to the end, without the least help,\r\nthough this could have been so easily requisitioned.\r\n\r\nBeing three, one might say, they considered themselves sufficiently\r\nstrong; they needed no one else to lend them a hand. The objection does\r\nnot hold good. On many occasions and under conditions even more\r\ndifficult than those presented by a stony soil, I have again and again\r\nseen isolated Necrophori exhausting themselves in striving against my\r\nartifices; yet not once did they leave their work to recruit helpers.\r\nCollaborators, it is true, did often arrive, but they were convoked by\r\ntheir sense of smell, not by the first possessor. They were fortuitous\r\nhelpers; they were never called in. They were welcomed without\r\ndisagreement, but also without gratitude. They were not summoned; they\r\nwere tolerated. In the glazed shelter where I keep the cage I happened\r\nto catch one of these chance assistants in the act. Passing that way in\r\nthe night and scenting dead flesh, he had entered where none of his\r\nkind had yet penetrated of his own free will. I surprised him on the\r\nwire-gauze dome of the cover. If the wire had not prevented him, he\r\nwould have set to work incontinently, in company with the rest. Had my\r\ncaptives invited him? Assuredly not. He had hastened thither attracted\r\nby the odour of the Mole, heedless of the efforts of others. So it was\r\nwith those whose obliging assistance is extolled. I repeat, in respect\r\nof their imaginary prowess, what I have said elsewhere of that of the\r\nSacred Beetles: the story is a childish one, worthy of ranking with any\r\nfairy-tale written for the amusement of the simple.\r\n\r\nA hard soil, necessitating the removal of the body, is not the only\r\ndifficulty familiar to the Necrophori. Often, perhaps more often than\r\nnot, the ground is covered with grass, above all with couch-grass,\r\nwhose tenacious rootlets form an inextricable network below the\r\nsurface. To dig in the interstices is possible, but to drag the dead\r\nanimal through them is another matter: the meshes of the net are too\r\nclose to give it passage. Will the grave-digger find himself reduced to\r\nimpotence by such an impediment, which must be an extremely common one?\r\nThat could not be.\r\n\r\nExposed to this or that habitual obstacle in the exercise of his\r\ncalling, the animal is always equipped accordingly; otherwise his\r\nprofession would be impracticable. No end is attained without the\r\nnecessary means and aptitudes. Besides that of the excavator, the\r\nNecrophorus certainly possesses another art: the art of breaking the\r\ncables, the roots, the stolons, the slender rhizomes which check the\r\nbody's descent into the grave. To the work of the shovel and the pick\r\nmust be added that of the shears. All this is perfectly logical and may\r\nbe foreseen with complete lucidity. Nevertheless, let us invoke\r\nexperiment, the best of witnesses.\r\n\r\nI borrow from the kitchen-range an iron trivet whose legs will supply a\r\nsolid foundation for the engine which I am devising. This is a coarse\r\nnetwork of strips of raphia, a fairly accurate imitation of the network\r\nof couch-grass roots. The very irregular meshes are nowhere wide enough\r\nto admit of the passage of the creature to be buried, which in this\r\ncase is a Mole. The trivet is planted with its three feet in the soil\r\nof the cage; its top is level with the surface of the soil. A little\r\nsand conceals the meshes. The Mole is placed in the centre; and my\r\nsquad of sextons is let loose upon the body.\r\n\r\nWithout a hitch the burial is accomplished in the course of an\r\nafternoon. The hammock of raphia, almost equivalent to the natural\r\nnetwork of couch-grass turf, scarcely disturbs the process of\r\ninhumation. Matters do not go forward quite so quickly; and that is\r\nall. No attempt is made to shift the Mole, who sinks into the ground\r\nwhere he lies. The operation completed, I remove the trivet. The\r\nnetwork is broken at the spot where the corpse lay. A few strips have\r\nbeen gnawed through; a small number, only so many as were strictly\r\nnecessary to permit the passage of the body.\r\n\r\nWell done, my undertakers! I expected no less of your savoir-faire. You\r\nhave foiled the artifices of the experimenter by employing your\r\nresources against natural obstacles. With mandibles for shears, you\r\nhave patiently cut my threads as you would have gnawed the cordage of\r\nthe grass-roots. This is meritorious, if not deserving of exceptional\r\nglorification. The most limited of the insects which work in earth\r\nwould have done as much if subjected to similar conditions.\r\n\r\nLet us ascend a stage in the series of difficulties. The Mole is now\r\nfixed with a lashing of raphia fore and aft to a light horizontal\r\ncross-bar which rests on two firmly-planted forks. It is like a joint\r\nof venison on a spit, though rather oddly fastened. The dead animal\r\ntouches the ground throughout the length of its body.\r\n\r\nThe Necrophori disappear under the corpse, and, feeling the contact of\r\nits fur, begin to dig. The grave grows deeper and an empty space\r\nappears, but the coveted object does not descend, retained as it is by\r\nthe cross-bar which the two forks keep in place. The digging slackens,\r\nthe hesitations become prolonged.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the grave-diggers ascends to the surface, wanders over\r\nthe Mole, inspects him and ends by perceiving the hinder strap.\r\nTenaciously he gnaws and ravels it. I hear the click of the shears that\r\ncompletes the rupture. Crack! The thing is done. Dragged down by his\r\nown weight, the Mole sinks into the grave, but slantwise, with his head\r\nstill outside, kept in place by the second ligature.\r\n\r\nThe Beetles proceed to the burial of the hinder part of the Mole; they\r\ntwitch and jerk it now in this direction, now in that. Nothing comes of\r\nit; the thing refuses to give. A fresh sortie is made by one of them to\r\ndiscover what is happening overhead. The second ligature is perceived,\r\nis severed in turn, and henceforth the work proceeds as well as could\r\nbe desired.\r\n\r\nMy compliments, perspicacious cable-cutters! But I must not exaggerate.\r\nThe lashings of the Mole were for you the little cords with which you\r\nare so familiar in turfy soil. You have severed them, as well as the\r\nhammock of the previous experiment, just as you sever with the blades\r\nof your shears any natural filament which stretches across your\r\ncatacombs. It is, in your calling, an indispensable knack. If you had\r\nhad to learn it by experience, to think it out before practising it,\r\nyour race would have disappeared, killed by the hesitations of its\r\napprenticeship, for the spots fertile in Moles, Frogs, Lizards and\r\nother victuals to your taste are usually grass-covered.\r\n\r\nYou are capable of far better things yet; but, before proceeding to\r\nthese, let us examine the case when the ground bristles with slender\r\nbrushwood, which holds the corpse at a short distance from the ground.\r\nWill the find thus suspended by the hazard of its fall remain\r\nunemployed? Will the Necrophori pass on, indifferent to the superb\r\ntit-bit which they see and smell a few inches above their heads, or\r\nwill they make it descend from its gibbet?\r\n\r\nGame does not abound to such a point that it can be disdained if a few\r\nefforts will obtain it. Before I see the thing happen I am persuaded\r\nthat it will fall, that the Necrophori, often confronted by the\r\ndifficulties of a body which is not lying on the soil, must possess the\r\ninstinct to shake it to the ground. The fortuitous support of a few\r\nbits of stubble, of a few interlaced brambles, a thing so common in the\r\nfields, should not be able to baffle them. The overthrow of the\r\nsuspended body, if placed too high, should certainly form part of their\r\ninstinctive methods. For the rest, let us watch them at work.\r\n\r\nI plant in the sand of the cage a meagre tuft of thyme. The shrub is at\r\nmost some four inches in height. In the branches I place a Mouse,\r\nentangling the tail, the paws and the neck among the twigs in order to\r\nincrease the difficulty. The population of the cage now consists of\r\nfourteen Necrophori and will remain the same until the close of my\r\ninvestigations. Of course they do not all take part simultaneously in\r\nthe day's work; the majority remain underground, somnolent, or occupied\r\nin setting their cellars in order. Sometimes only one, often two, three\r\nor four, rarely more, busy themselves with the dead creature which I\r\noffer them. To-day two hasten to the Mouse, who is soon perceived\r\noverhead in the tuft of thyme.\r\n\r\nThey gain the summit of the plant by way of the wire trellis of the\r\ncage. Here are repeated, with increased hesitation, due to the\r\ninconvenient nature of the support, the tactics employed to remove the\r\nbody when the soil is unfavourable. The insect props itself against a\r\nbranch, thrusting alternately with back and claws, jerking and shaking\r\nvigorously until the point where at it is working is freed from its\r\nfetters. In one brief shift, by dint of heaving their backs, the two\r\ncollaborators extricate the body from the entanglement of twigs. Yet\r\nanother shake; and the Mouse is down. The burial follows.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new in this experiment; the find has been dealt with\r\njust as though it lay upon soil unsuitable for burial. The fall is the\r\nresult of an attempt to transport the load.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to set up the Frog's gibbet celebrated by Gledditsch.\r\nThe batrachian is not indispensable; a Mole will serve as well or even\r\nbetter. With a ligament of raphia I fix him, by his hind-legs, to a\r\ntwig which I plant vertically in the ground, inserting it to no great\r\ndepth. The creature hangs plumb against the gibbet, its head and\r\nshoulders making ample contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nThe gravediggers set to work beneath the part which lies upon the\r\nground, at the very foot of the stake; they dig a funnel-shaped hole,\r\ninto which the muzzle, the head and the neck of the mole sink little by\r\nlittle. The gibbet becomes uprooted as they sink and eventually falls,\r\ndragged over by the weight of its heavy burden. I am assisting at the\r\nspectacle of the overturned stake, one of the most astonishing examples\r\nof rational accomplishment which has ever been recorded to the credit\r\nof the insect.\r\n\r\nThis, for one who is considering the problem of instinct, is an\r\nexciting moment. But let us beware of forming conclusions as yet; we\r\nmight be in too great a hurry. Let us ask ourselves first whether the\r\nfall of the stake was intentional or fortuitous. Did the Necrophori lay\r\nit bare with the express intention of causing it to fall? Or did they,\r\non the contrary, dig at its base solely in order to bury that part of\r\nthe mole which lay on the ground? that is the question, which, for the\r\nrest, is very easy to answer.\r\n\r\nThe experiment is repeated; but this time the gibbet is slanting and\r\nthe Mole, hanging in a vertical position, touches the ground at a\r\ncouple of inches from the base of the gibbet. Under these conditions\r\nabsolutely no attempt is made to overthrow the latter. Not the least\r\nscrape of a claw is delivered at the foot of the gibbet. The entire\r\nwork of excavation is accomplished at a distance, under the body, whose\r\nshoulders are lying on the ground. There--and there only--a hole is dug\r\nto receive the free portion of the body, the part accessible to the\r\nsextons.\r\n\r\nA difference of an inch in the position of the suspended animal\r\nannihilates the famous legend. Even so, many a time, the most\r\nelementary sieve, handled with a little logic, is enough to winnow the\r\nconfused mass of affirmations and to release the good grain of truth.\r\n\r\nYet another shake of the sieve. The gibbet is oblique or vertical\r\nindifferently; but the Mole, always fixed by a hinder limb to the top\r\nof the twig, does not touch the soil; he hangs a few fingers'-breadths\r\nfrom the ground, out of the sextons' reach.\r\n\r\nWhat will the latter do? Will they scrape at the foot of the gibbet in\r\norder to overturn it? By no means; and the ingenuous observer who\r\nlooked for such tactics would be greatly disappointed. No attention is\r\npaid to the base of the support. It is not vouchsafed even a stroke of\r\nthe rake. Nothing is done to overturn it, nothing, absolutely nothing!\r\nIt is by other methods that the Burying-beetles obtain the Mole.\r\n\r\nThese decisive experiments, repeated under many different forms, prove\r\nthat never, never in this world do the Necrophori dig, or even give a\r\nsuperficial scrape, at the foot of the gallows, unless the hanging body\r\ntouch the ground at that point. And, in the latter case, if the twig\r\nshould happen to fall, its fall is in nowise an intentional result, but\r\na mere fortuitous effect of the burial already commenced.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, did the owner of the Frog of whom Gledditsch tells us\r\nreally see? If his stick was overturned, the body placed to dry beyond\r\nthe assaults of the Necrophori must certainly have touched the soil: a\r\nstrange precaution against robbers and the damp! We may fittingly\r\nattribute more foresight to the preparer of dried Frogs and allow him\r\nto hang the creature some inches from the ground. In this case all my\r\nexperiments emphatically assert that the fall of the stake undermined\r\nby the sextons is a pure matter of imagination.\r\n\r\nYet another of the fine arguments in favour of the reasoning power of\r\nanimals flies from the light of investigation and founders in the\r\nslough of error! I admire your simple faith, you masters who take\r\nseriously the statements of chance-met observers, richer in imagination\r\nthan in veracity; I admire your credulous zeal, when, without\r\ncriticism, you build up your theories on such absurdities.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed. The stake is henceforth planted vertically, but the\r\nbody hanging on it does not reach the base: a condition which suffices\r\nto ensure that there is never any digging at this point. I make use of\r\na Mouse, who, by reason of her trifling weight, will lend herself\r\nbetter to the insect's manoeuvres. The dead body is fixed by the\r\nhind-legs to the top of the stake with a ligature of raphia. It hangs\r\nplumb, in contact with the stick.\r\n\r\nVery soon two Necrophori have discovered the tit-bit. They climb up the\r\nminiature mast; they explore the body, dividing its fur by thrusts of\r\nthe head. It is recognized to be an excellent find. So to work. Here we\r\nhave again, but under far more difficult conditions, the tactics\r\nemployed when it was necessary to displace the unfavourably situated\r\nbody: the two collaborators slip between the Mouse and the stake, when,\r\ntaking a grip of the latter and exerting a leverage with their backs,\r\nthey jerk and shake the body, which oscillates, twirls about, swings\r\naway from the stake and relapses. All the morning is passed in vain\r\nattempts, interrupted by explorations on the animal's body.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the cause of the check is at last recognized; not very\r\nclearly, for in the first place the two obstinate riflers of the\r\ngallows attack the hind-legs of the Mouse, a little below the ligature.\r\nThey strip them bare, flay them and cut away the flesh about the heel.\r\nThey have reached the bone, when one of them finds the raphia beneath\r\nhis mandibles. This, to him, is a familiar thing, representing the\r\ngramineous fibre so frequent in the case of burial in grass-covered\r\nsoil. Tenaciously the shears gnaw at the bond; the vegetable fetter is\r\nsevered and the Mouse falls, to be buried a little later.\r\n\r\nIf it were isolated, this severance of the suspending tie would be a\r\nmagnificent performance; but considered in connection with the sum of\r\nthe Beetle's customary labours it loses all far-reaching significance.\r\nBefore attacking the ligature, which was not concealed in any way, the\r\ninsect exerted itself for a whole morning in shaking the body, its\r\nusual method. Finally, finding the cord, it severed it, as it would\r\nhave severed a ligament of couch-grass encountered underground.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions devised for the Beetle, the use of the shears is\r\nthe indispensable complement of the use of the shovel; and the modicum\r\nof discernment at his disposal is enough to inform him when the blades\r\nof his shears will be useful. He cuts what embarrasses him with no more\r\nexercise of reason than he displays when placing the corpse\r\nunderground. So little does he grasp the connection between cause and\r\neffect that he strives to break the bone of the leg before gnawing at\r\nthe bast which is knotted close beside him. The difficult task is\r\nattacked before the extremely simple.\r\n\r\nDifficult, yes, but not impossible, provided that the Mouse be young. I\r\nbegin again with a ligature of iron wire, on which the shears of the\r\ninsect can obtain no purchase, and a tender Mouselet, half the size of\r\nan adult. This time a tibia is gnawed through, cut in two by the\r\nBeetle's mandibles near the spring of the heel. The detached member\r\nleaves plenty of space for the other, which readily slips from the\r\nmetallic band; and the little body falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nBut, if the bone be too hard, if the body suspended be that of a Mole,\r\nan adult Mouse, or a Sparrow, the wire ligament opposes an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to the attempts of the Necrophori, who, for\r\nnearly a week, work at the hanging body, partly stripping it of fur or\r\nfeather and dishevelling it until it forms a lamentable object, and at\r\nlast abandon it, when desiccation sets in. A last resource, however,\r\nremains, one as rational as infallible. It is to overthrow the stake.\r\nOf course, not one dreams of doing so.\r\n\r\nFor the last time let us change our artifices. The top of the gibbet\r\nconsists of a little fork, with the prongs widely opened and measuring\r\nbarely two-fifths of an inch in length. With a thread of hemp, less\r\neasily attacked than a strip of raphia, I bind together, a little above\r\nthe heels, the hind-legs of an adult Mouse; and between the legs I slip\r\none of the prongs of the fork. To make the body fall it is enough to\r\nslide it a little way upwards; it is like a young Rabbit hanging in the\r\nfront of a poulterer's shop.\r\n\r\nFive Necrophori come to inspect my preparations. After a great deal of\r\nfutile shaking, the tibiae are attacked. This, it seems, is the method\r\nusually employed when the body is retained by one of its limbs in some\r\nnarrow fork of a low-growing plant. While trying to saw through the\r\nbone--a heavy job this time--one of the workers slips between the\r\nshackled limbs. So situated, he feels against his back the furry touch\r\nof the Mouse. Nothing more is needed to arouse his propensity to thrust\r\nwith his back. With a few heaves of the lever the thing is done; the\r\nMouse rises a little, slides over the supporting peg and falls to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIs this manoeuvre really thought out? Has the insect indeed perceived,\r\nby the light of a flash of reason, that in order to make the tit-bit\r\nfall it was necessary to unhook it by sliding it along the peg? Has it\r\nreally perceived the mechanism of suspension? I know some\r\npersons--indeed, I know many--who, in the presence of this magnificent\r\nresult, would be satisfied without further investigation.\r\n\r\nMore difficult to convince, I modify the experiment before drawing a\r\nconclusion. I suspect that the Necrophorus, without any prevision of\r\nthe consequences of his action, heaved his back simply because he felt\r\nthe legs of the creature above him. With the system of suspension\r\nadopted, the push of the back, employed in all cases of difficulty, was\r\nbrought to bear first upon the point of support; and the fall resulted\r\nfrom this happy coincidence. That point, which has to be slipped along\r\nthe peg in order to unhook the object, ought really to be situated at a\r\nshort distance from the Mouse, so that the Necrophori shall no longer\r\nfeel her directly against their backs when they push.\r\n\r\nA piece of wire binds together now the tarsi of a Sparrow, now the\r\nheels of a Mouse and is bent, at a distance of three-quarters of an\r\ninch or so, into a little ring, which slips very loosely over one of\r\nthe prongs of the fork, a short, almost horizontal prong. To make the\r\nhanging body fall, the slightest thrust upon this ring is sufficient;\r\nand, owing to its projection from the peg, it lends itself excellently\r\nto the insect's methods. In short, the arrangement is the same as it\r\nwas just now, with this difference, that the point of support is at a\r\nshort distance from the suspended animal.\r\n\r\nMy trick, simple though it be, is fully successful. For a long time the\r\nbody is repeatedly shaken, but in vain; the tibiae or tarsi, unduly\r\nhard, refuse to yield to the patient saw. Sparrows and Mice grow dry\r\nand shrivelled, unused, upon the gibbet. Sooner in one case, later in\r\nanother, my Necrophori abandon the insoluble problem in mechanics: to\r\npush, ever so little, the movable support and so to unhook the coveted\r\ncarcass.\r\n\r\nCurious reasoners, in faith! If they had had, but now, a lucid idea of\r\nthe mutual relations between the shackled limbs and the suspending peg;\r\nif they had made the Mouse fall by a reasoned manoeuvre, whence comes\r\nit that the present artifice, no less simple than the first, is to them\r\nan insurmountable obstacle? For days and days they work on the body,\r\nexamine it from head to foot, without becoming aware of the movable\r\nsupport, the cause of their misadventure. In vain do I prolong my\r\nwatch; never do I see a single one of them push it with his foot or\r\nbutt it with his head.\r\n\r\nTheir defeat is not due to lack of strength. Like the Geotrupes, they\r\nare vigorous excavators. Grasped in the closed hand, they insinuate\r\nthemselves through the interstices of the fingers and plough up your\r\nskin in a fashion to make you very quickly loose your hold. With his\r\nhead, a robust ploughshare, the Beetle might very easily push the ring\r\noff its short support. He is not able to do so because he does not\r\nthink of it; he does not think of it because he is devoid of the\r\nfaculty attributed to him, in order to support its thesis, by the\r\ndangerous prodigality of transformism.\r\n\r\nDivine reason, sun of the intellect, what a clumsy slap in thy august\r\ncountenance, when the glorifiers of the animal degrade thee with such\r\ndullness!\r\n\r\nLet us now examine under another aspect the mental obscurity of the\r\nNecrophori. My captives are not so satisfied with their sumptuous\r\nlodging that they do not seek to escape, especially when there is a\r\ndearth of labour, that sovran consoler of the afflicted, man or beast.\r\nInternment within the wire cover palls upon them. So, the Mole buried\r\nand all in order in the cellar, they stray uneasily over the wire-gauze\r\nof the dome; they clamber up, descend, ascend again and take to flight,\r\na flight which instantly becomes a fall, owing to collision with the\r\nwire grating. They pick themselves up and begin again. The sky is\r\nsuperb; the weather is hot, calm and propitious for those in search of\r\nthe Lizard crushed beside the footpath. Perhaps the effluvia of the\r\ngamy tit-bit have reached them, coming from afar, imperceptible to any\r\nother sense than that of the Sexton-beetles. So my Necrophori are fain\r\nto go their ways.\r\n\r\nCan they? Nothing would be easier if a glimmer of reason were to aid\r\nthem. Through the wire network, over which they have so often strayed,\r\nthey have seen, outside, the free soil, the promised land which they\r\nlong to reach. A hundred times if once have they dug at the foot of the\r\nrampart. There, in vertical wells, they take up their station, drowsing\r\nwhole days on end while unemployed. If I give them a fresh Mole, they\r\nemerge from their retreat by the entrance corridor and come to hide\r\nthemselves beneath the belly of the beast. The burial over, they\r\nreturn, one here, one there, to the confines of the enclosure and\r\ndisappear beneath the soil.\r\n\r\nWell, in two and a half months of captivity, despite long stays at the\r\nbase of the trellis, at a depth of three-quarters of an inch beneath\r\nthe surface, it is rare indeed for a Necrophorus to succeed in\r\ncircumventing the obstacle, to prolong his excavation beneath the\r\nbarrier, to make an elbow in it and to bring it out on the other side,\r\na trifling task for these vigorous creatures. Of fourteen only one\r\nsucceeded in escaping.\r\n\r\nA chance deliverance and not premeditated; for, if the happy event had\r\nbeen the result of a mental combination, the other prisoners,\r\npractically his equals in powers of perception, would all, from first\r\nto last, discover by rational means the elbowed path leading to the\r\nouter world; and the cage would promptly be deserted. The failure of\r\nthe great majority proves that the single fugitive was simply digging\r\nat random. Circumstances favoured him; and that is all. Do not let us\r\nmake it a merit that he succeeded where all the others failed.\r\n\r\nLet us also beware of attributing to the Necrophori an understanding\r\nmore limited than is usual in entomological psychology. I find the\r\nineptness of the undertaker in all the insects reared under the wire\r\ncover, on the bed of sand into which the rim of the dome sinks a little\r\nway. With very rare exceptions, fortuitous accidents, no insect has\r\nthought of circumventing the barrier by way of the base; none has\r\nsucceeded in gaining the exterior by means of a slanting tunnel, not\r\neven though it were a miner by profession, as are the Dung-beetles par\r\nexcellence. Captives under the wire dome, but desirous of escape,\r\nSacred Beetles, Geotrupes, Copres, Gymnopleuri, Sisyphi, all see about\r\nthem the freedom of space, the joys of the open sunlight; and not one\r\nthinks of going round under the rampart, a front which would present no\r\ndifficulty to their pick-axes.\r\n\r\nEven in the higher ranks of animality, examples of similar mental\r\nobfuscation are not lacking. Audubon relates how, in his days, the wild\r\nTurkeys were caught in North America.\r\n\r\nIn a clearing known to be frequented by these birds, a great cage was\r\nconstructed with stakes driven into the ground. In the centre of the\r\nenclosure opened a short tunnel, which dipped under the palisade and\r\nreturned to the surface outside the cage by a gentle slope, which was\r\nopen to the sky. The central opening, large enough to give a bird free\r\npassage, occupied only a portion of the enclosure, leaving around it,\r\nagainst the circle of stakes, a wide unbroken zone. A few handfuls of\r\nmaize were scattered in the interior of the trap, as well as round\r\nabout it, and in particular along the sloping path, which passed under\r\na sort of bridge and led to the centre of the contrivance. In short,\r\nthe Turkey-trap presented an ever-open door. The bird found it in order\r\nto enter, but did not think of looking for it in order to return by it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the famous American ornithologist, the Turkeys, lured by\r\nthe grains of maize, descended the insidious slope, entered the short\r\nunderground passage and beheld, at the end of it, plunder and the\r\nlight. A few steps farther and the gluttons emerged, one by one, from\r\nbeneath the bridge. They distributed themselves about the enclosure.\r\nThe maize was abundant; and the Turkeys' crops grew swollen.\r\n\r\nWhen all was gathered, the band wished to retreat, but not one of the\r\nprisoners paid any attention to the central hole by which he had\r\narrived. Gobbling uneasily, they passed again and again across the\r\nbridge whose arch was yawning beside them; they circled round against\r\nthe palisade, treading a hundred times in their own footprints; they\r\nthrust their necks, with their crimson wattles, through the bars; and\r\nthere, with beaks in the open air, they remained until they were\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nRemember, inept fowl, the occurrences of a little while ago; think of\r\nthe tunnel which led you hither! If there be in that poor brain of\r\nyours an atom of capacity, put two ideas together and remind yourself\r\nthat the passage by which you entered is there and open for your\r\nescape! You will do nothing of the kind. The light, an irresistible\r\nattraction, holds you subjugated against the palisade; and the shadow\r\nof the yawning pit, which has but lately permitted you to enter and\r\nwill quite as readily permit of your exit, leaves you indifferent. To\r\nrecognize the use of this opening you would have to reflect a little,\r\nto evolve the past; but this tiny retrospective calculation is beyond\r\nyour powers. So the trapper, returning a few days later, will find a\r\nrich booty, the entire flock imprisoned!\r\n\r\nOf poor intellectual repute, does the Turkey deserve his name for\r\nstupidity? He does not appear to be more limited than another. Audubon\r\ndepicts him as endowed with certain useful ruses, in particular when he\r\nhas to baffle the attacks of his nocturnal enemy, the Virginian Owl. As\r\nfor his actions in the snare with the underground passage, any other\r\nbird, impassioned of the light, would do the same.\r\n\r\nUnder rather more difficult conditions, the Necrophorus repeats the\r\nineptness of the Turkey. When he wishes to return to the open daylight,\r\nafter resting in a short burrow against the rim of the wire cover, the\r\nBeetle, seeing a little light filtering down through the loose soil,\r\nreascends by the path of entry, incapable of telling himself that it\r\nwould suffice to prolong the tunnel as far in the opposite direction\r\nfor him to reach the outer world beyond the wall and gain his freedom.\r\nHere again is one in whom we shall seek in vain for any indication of\r\nreflection. Like the rest, in spite of his legendary renown, he has no\r\nguide but the unconscious promptings of instinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. THE BLUEBOTTLE.\r\n\r\nTo purge the earth of death's impurities and cause deceased animal\r\nmatter to be once more numbered among the treasures of life there are\r\nhosts of sausage-queens, including, in our part of the world, the\r\nBluebottle (Calliphora vomitaria, Lin.) and the Grey Flesh-fly\r\n(Sarcophaga carnaria, Lin.) Every one knows the first, the big,\r\ndark-blue Fly who, after effecting her designs in the ill-watched\r\nmeat-safe, settles on our window-panes and keeps up a solemn buzzing,\r\nanxious to be off in the sun and ripen a fresh emission of germs. How\r\ndoes she lay her eggs, the origin of the loathsome maggot that battens\r\npoisonously on our provisions whether of game or butcher's meat? What\r\nare her stratagems and how can we foil them? This is what I propose to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nThe Bluebottle frequents our homes during autumn and a part of winter,\r\nuntil the cold becomes severe; but her appearance in the fields dates\r\nback much earlier. On the first fine day in February, we shall see her\r\nwarming herself, chillily, against the sunny walls. In April, I notice\r\nher in considerable numbers on the laurustinus. It is here that she\r\nseems to pair, while sipping the sugary exudations of the small white\r\nflowers. The whole of the summer season is spent out of doors, in brief\r\nflights from one refreshment-bar to the next. When autumn comes, with\r\nits game, she makes her way into our houses and remains until the hard\r\nfrosts.\r\n\r\nThis suits my stay-at-home habits and especially my legs, which are\r\nbending under the weight of years. I need not run after the subjects of\r\nmy present study; they call on me. Besides, I have vigilant assistants.\r\nThe household knows of my plans. One and all bring me, in a little\r\nscrew of paper, the noisy visitor just captured against the panes.\r\n\r\nThus do I fill my vivarium, which consists of a large, bell-shaped cage\r\nof wire-gauze, standing in an earthenware pan full of sand. A mug\r\ncontaining honey is the dining-room of the establishment. Here the\r\ncaptives come to recruit themselves in their hours of leisure. To\r\noccupy their maternal cares, I employ small birds--Chaffinches,\r\nLinnets, Sparrows--brought down, in the enclosure, by my son's gun.\r\n\r\nI have just served up a Linnet shot two days ago. I next place in the\r\ncage a Bluebottle, one only, to avoid confusion. Her fat belly\r\nproclaims the advent of laying-time. An hour later, when the excitement\r\nof being put in prison is allayed, my captive is in labour. With eager,\r\njerky steps, she explores the morsel of game, goes from the head to the\r\ntail, returns from the tail to the head, repeats the action several\r\ntimes and at last settles near an eye, a dimmed eye sunk into its\r\nsocket.\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor bends at a right angle and dives into the junction of\r\nthe beak, straight down to the root. Then the eggs are emitted for\r\nnearly half an hour. The layer, utterly absorbed in her serious\r\nbusiness, remains stationary and impassive and is easily observed\r\nthrough my lens. A movement on my part would doubtless scare her; but\r\nmy restful presence gives her no anxiety. I am nothing to her.\r\n\r\nThe discharge does not go on continuously until the ovaries are\r\nexhausted; it is intermittent and performed in so many packets. Several\r\ntimes over, the Fly leaves the bird's beak and comes to take a rest\r\nupon the wire-gauze, where she brushes her hind-legs one against the\r\nother. In particular, before using it again, she cleans, smooths and\r\npolishes her laying-tool, the probe that places the eggs. Then, feeling\r\nher womb still teeming, she returns to the same spot at the joint of\r\nthe beak. The delivery is resumed, to cease presently and then begin\r\nanew. A couple of hours are thus spent in alternate standing near the\r\neye and resting on the wire-gauze.\r\n\r\nAt last it is over. The Fly does not go back to the bird, a proof that\r\nher ovaries are exhausted. The next day she is dead. The eggs are\r\ndabbed in a continuous layer, at the entrance to the throat, at the\r\nroot of the tongue, on the membrane of the palate. Their number appears\r\nconsiderable; the whole inside of the gullet is white with them. I fix\r\na little wooden prop between the two mandibles of the beak, to keep\r\nthem open and enable me to see what happens.\r\n\r\nI learn in this way that the hatching takes place in a couple of days.\r\nAs soon as they are born, the young vermin, a swarming mass, leave the\r\nplace where they are and disappear down the throat.\r\n\r\nThe beak of the bird invaded was closed at the start, as far as the\r\nnatural contact of the mandibles allowed. There remained a narrow slit\r\nat the base, sufficient at most to admit the passage of a horse-hair.\r\nIt was through this that the laying was performed. Lengthening her\r\novipositor like a telescope, the mother inserted the point of her\r\nimplement, a point slightly hardened with a horny armour. The fineness\r\nof the probe equals the fineness of the aperture. But, if the beak were\r\nentirely closed, where would the eggs be laid then?\r\n\r\nWith a tied thread I keep the two mandibles in absolute contact; and I\r\nplace a second Bluebottle in the presence of the Linnet, whom the\r\ncolonists have already entered by the beak. This time the laying takes\r\nplace on one of the eyes, between the lid and the eyeball. At the\r\nhatching, which again occurs a couple of days later, the grubs make\r\ntheir way into the fleshy depths of the socket. The eyes and the beak,\r\ntherefore, form the two chief entrances into feathered game.\r\n\r\nThere are others; and these are the wounds. I cover the Linnet's head\r\nwith a paper hood which will prevent invasion through the beak and\r\neyes. I serve it, under the wire-gauze bell, to a third egg-layer. The\r\nbird has been struck by a shot in the breast, but the sore is not\r\nbleeding: no outer stain marks the injured spot. Moreover, I am careful\r\nto arrange the feathers, to smooth them with a hair-pencil, so that the\r\nbird looks quite smart and has every appearance of being untouched.\r\n\r\nThe Fly is soon there. She inspects the Linnet from end to end; with\r\nher front tarsi she fumbles at the breast and belly. It is a sort of\r\nauscultation by sense of touch. The insect becomes aware of what is\r\nunder the feathers by the manner in which these react. If scent lends\r\nits assistance, it can only be very slightly, for the game is not yet\r\nhigh. The wound is soon found. No drop of blood is near it, for it is\r\nclosed by a plug of down rammed into it by the shot. The Fly takes up\r\nher position without separating the feathers or uncovering the wound.\r\nShe remains here for two hours without stirring, motionless, with her\r\nabdomen concealed beneath the plumage. My eager curiosity does not\r\ndistract her from her business for a moment.\r\n\r\nWhen she has finished, I take her place. There is nothing either on the\r\nskin or at the mouth of the wound. I have to withdraw the downy plug\r\nand dig to some depth before discovering the eggs. The ovipositor has\r\ntherefore lengthened its extensible tube and pushed beyond the feather\r\nstopper driven in by the lead. The eggs are in one packet; they number\r\nabout three hundred.\r\n\r\nWhen the beak and eyes are rendered inaccessible, when the body,\r\nmoreover, has no wounds, the laying still takes place, but this time in\r\na hesitating and niggardly fashion. I pluck the bird completely, the\r\nbetter to watch what happens; also, I cover the head with a paper hood\r\nto close the usual means of access. For a long time, with jerky steps,\r\nthe mother explores the body in every direction; she takes her stand by\r\npreference on the head, which she sounds by tapping on it with her\r\nfront tarsi. She knows that the openings which she needs are there,\r\nunder the paper; but she also knows how frail are her grubs, how\r\npowerless to pierce their way through the strange obstacle which stops\r\nher as well and interferes with the work of her ovipositor. The cowl\r\ninspires her with profound distrust. Despite the tempting bait of the\r\nveiled head, not an egg is laid on the wrapper, slight though it may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nWeary of vain attempts to compass this obstacle, the Fly at last\r\ndecides in favour of other points, but not on the breast, belly, or\r\nback, where the hide would seem too tough and the light too intrusive.\r\nShe needs dark hiding-places, corners where the skin is very delicate.\r\nThe spots chosen are the cavity of the axilla, corresponding with our\r\narm-pit, and the crease where the thigh joins the belly. Eggs are laid\r\nin both places, but not many, showing that the groin and the axilla are\r\nadopted only reluctantly and for lack of a better spot.\r\n\r\nWith an unplucked bird, also hooded, the same experiment failed: the\r\nfeathers prevent the Fly from slipping into those deep places. Let us\r\nadd, in conclusion, that, on a skinned bird, or simply on a piece of\r\nbutcher's meat, the laying is effected on any part whatever, provided\r\nthat it be dark. The gloomiest corners are the favourite ones.\r\n\r\nIt follows from all this that, to lay her eggs, the Bluebottle picks\r\nout either naked wounds or else the mucous membranes of the mouth or\r\neyes, which are not protected by a skin of any thickness. She also\r\nneeds darkness.\r\n\r\nThe perfect efficiency of the paper bag, which prevents the inroads of\r\nthe worms through the eye-sockets or the beak, suggests a similar\r\nexperiment with the whole bird. It is a matter of wrapping the body in\r\na sort of artificial skin which will be as discouraging to the Fly as\r\nthe natural skin. Linnets, some with deep wounds, others almost intact,\r\nare placed one by one in paper envelopes similar to those in which the\r\nnursery-gardener keeps his seeds, envelopes just folded, without being\r\nstuck. The paper is quite ordinary and of middling thickness. Torn\r\npieces of newspaper serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nThese sheaths with the corpses inside them are freely exposed to the\r\nair, on the table in my study, where they are visited, according to the\r\ntime of day, in dense shade and in bright sunlight. Attracted by the\r\neffluvia from the dead meat, the Bluebottles haunt my laboratory, the\r\nwindows of which are always open. I see them daily alighting on the\r\nenvelopes and very busily exploring them, apprised of the contents by\r\nthe gamy smell. Their incessant coming and going is a sign of intense\r\ncupidity; and yet none of them decides to lay on the bags. They do not\r\neven attempt to slide their ovipositor through the slits of the folds.\r\nThe favourable season passes and not an egg is laid on the tempting\r\nwrappers. All the mothers abstain, judging the slender obstacle of the\r\npaper to be more than the vermin will be able to overcome.\r\n\r\nThis caution on the Fly's part does not at all surprise me: motherhood\r\neverywhere has great gleams of perspicacity. What does astonish me is\r\nthe following result. The parcels containing the Linnets are left for a\r\nwhole year uncovered on the table; they remain there for a second year\r\nand a third. I inspect the contents from time to time. The little birds\r\nare intact, with unrumpled feathers, free from smell, dry and light,\r\nlike mummies. They have become not decomposed, but mummified.\r\n\r\nI expected to see them putrefying, running into sanies, like corpses\r\nleft to rot in the open air. On the contrary, the birds have dried and\r\nhardened, without undergoing any change. What did they want for their\r\nputrefaction? simply the intervention of the Fly. The maggot,\r\ntherefore, is the primary cause of dissolution after death; it is,\r\nabove all, the putrefactive chemist.\r\n\r\nA conclusion not devoid of value may be drawn from my paper game-bags.\r\nIn our markets, especially in those of the South, the game is hung\r\nunprotected from the hooks on the stalls. Larks strung up by the dozen\r\nwith a wire through their nostrils, Thrushes, Plovers, Teal,\r\nPartridges, Snipe, in short, all the glories of the spit which the\r\nautumn migration brings us, remain for days and weeks at the mercy of\r\nthe Flies. The buyer allows himself to be tempted by a goodly exterior;\r\nhe makes his purchase and, back at home, just when the bird is being\r\nprepared for roasting, he discovers that the promised dainty is alive\r\nwith worms. O horror! There is nothing for it but to throw the\r\nloathsome, verminous thing away.\r\n\r\nThe Bluebottle is the culprit here. Everybody knows it, and nobody\r\nthinks seriously of shaking off her tyranny: not the retailer, nor the\r\nwholesale dealer, nor the killer of the game. What is wanted to keep\r\nthe maggots out? Hardly anything: to slip each bird into a paper\r\nsheath. If this precaution were taken at the start, before the Flies\r\narrive, any game would be safe and could be left indefinitely to attain\r\nthe degree of ripeness required by the epicure's palate.\r\n\r\nStuffed with olives and myrtleberries, the Corsican Blackbirds are\r\nexquisite eating. We sometimes receive them at Orange, layers of them,\r\npacked in baskets through which the air circulates freely and each\r\ncontained in a paper wrapper. They are in a state of perfect\r\npreservation, complying with the most exacting demands of the kitchen.\r\nI congratulate the nameless shipper who conceived the bright idea of\r\nclothing his Blackbirds in paper. Will his example find imitators? I\r\ndoubt it.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a serious objection to this method of\r\npreservation. In its paper shroud, the article is invisible; it is not\r\nenticing; it does not inform the passer-by of its nature and qualities.\r\nThere is one resource left which would leave the bird uncovered: simply\r\nto case the head in a paper cap. The head being the part most menaced,\r\nbecause of the mucous membrane of the throat and eyes, it would be\r\nenough, as a rule, to protect the head, in order to keep off the Flies\r\nand thwart their attempts.\r\n\r\nLet us continue to study the Bluebottle, while varying our means of\r\ninformation. A tin, about four inches deep, contains a piece of\r\nbutcher's meat. The lid is not put in quite straight and leaves a\r\nnarrow slit at one point of its circumference, allowing, at most, of\r\nthe passage of a fine needle. When the bait begins to give off a gamy\r\nscent, the mothers come, singly or in numbers. They are attracted by\r\nthe odour which, transmitted through a thin crevice, hardly reaches my\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\nThey explore the metal receptacle for some time, seeking an entrance.\r\nFinding naught that enables them to reach the coveted morsel, they\r\ndecide to lay their eggs on the tin, just beside the aperture.\r\nSometimes, when the width of the passage allows of it, they insert the\r\novipositor into the tin and lay the eggs inside, on the very edge of\r\nthe slit. Whether outside or in, the eggs are dabbed down in a fairly\r\nregular and absolutely white layer.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the Bluebottle refusing to lay her eggs on the paper bag,\r\nnotwithstanding the carrion fumes of the Linnet enclosed; yet now,\r\nwithout hesitation, she lays them on a sheet of metal. Can the nature\r\nof the floor make any difference to her? I replace the tin lid by a\r\npaper cover stretched and pasted over the orifice. With the point of my\r\nknife I make a narrow slit in this new lid. That is quite enough: the\r\nparent accepts the paper.\r\n\r\nWhat determined her, therefore, is not simply the smell, which can\r\neasily be perceived even through the uncut paper, but, above all, the\r\ncrevice, which will provide an entrance for the vermin, hatched\r\noutside, near the narrow passage. The maggots' mother has her own\r\nlogic, her prudent foresight. She knows how feeble her wee grubs will\r\nbe, how powerless to cut their way through an obstacle of any\r\nresistance; and so, despite the temptation of the smell, she refrains\r\nfrom laying, so long as she finds no entrance through which the\r\nnew-born worms can slip unaided.\r\n\r\nI wanted to know whether the colour, the shininess, the degree of\r\nhardness and other qualities of the obstacle would influence the\r\ndecision of a mother obliged to lay her eggs under exceptional\r\nconditions. With this object in view, I employed small jars, each\r\nbaited with a bit of butcher's meat. The respective lids were made of\r\ndifferent-coloured paper, of oil-skin, or of some of that tin-foil,\r\nwith its gold or coppery sheen, which is used for sealing\r\nliqueur-bottles. On not one of these covers did the mothers stop, with\r\nany desire to deposit their eggs; but, from the moment that the knife\r\nhad made the narrow slit, all the lids were, sooner or later, visited\r\nand all, sooner or later, received the white shower somewhere near the\r\ngash. The look of the obstacle, therefore, does not count; dull or\r\nbrilliant, drab or coloured: these are details of no importance; the\r\nthing that matters is that there should be a passage to allow the grubs\r\nto enter.\r\n\r\nThough hatched outside, at a distance from the coveted morsel, the\r\nnew-born worms are well able to find their refectory. As they release\r\nthemselves from the egg, without hesitation, so accurate is their\r\nscent, they slip beneath the edge of the ill-joined lid, or through the\r\npassage cut by the knife. Behold them entering upon their promised\r\nland, their reeking paradise.\r\n\r\nEager to arrive, do they drop from the top of the wall? Not they!\r\nSlowly creeping, they make their way down the side of the jar; they use\r\ntheir fore-part, ever in quest of information, as a crutch and grapnel\r\nin one. They reach the meat and at once instal themselves upon it.\r\n\r\nLet us continue our investigation, varying the conditions. A large\r\ntest-tube, measuring nine inches high, is baited at the bottom with a\r\nlump of butcher's meat. It is closed with wire-gauze, whose meshes, two\r\nmillimetres wide (.078 inch.--Translator's Note.), do not permit of the\r\nFly's passage. The Bluebottle comes to my apparatus, guided by scent\r\nrather than sight. She hastens to the test-tube, whose contents are\r\nveiled under an opaque cover, with the same alacrity as to the open\r\ntube. The invisible attracts her quite as much as the visible.\r\n\r\nShe stays awhile on the lattice of the mouth, inspects it attentively;\r\nbut, whether because circumstances failed to serve me, or because the\r\nwire network inspired her with distrust, I never saw her dab her eggs\r\nupon it for certain. As her evidence was doubtful, I had recourse to\r\nthe Flesh-fly (Sarcophaga carnaria).\r\n\r\nThis Fly is less finicking in her preparations, she has more faith in\r\nthe strength of her worms, which are born ready-formed and vigorous,\r\nand easily shows me what I wish to see. She explores the trellis-work,\r\nchooses a mesh through which she inserts the tip of her abdomen, and,\r\nundisturbed by my presence, emits, one after the other, a certain\r\nnumber of grubs, about ten or so. True, her visits will be repeated,\r\nincreasing the family at a rate of which I am ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe new-born worms, thanks to a slight viscidity, cling for a moment to\r\nthe wire-gauze; they swarm, wriggle, release themselves and leap into\r\nthe chasm. It is a nine-inch drop at least. When this is done, the\r\nmother makes off, knowing for a certainty that her offspring will shift\r\nfor themselves. If they fall on the meat, well and good; if they fall\r\nelsewhere, they can reach the morsel by crawling.\r\n\r\nThis confidence in the unknown factor of the precipice, with no\r\nindication but that of smell, deserves fuller investigation. From what\r\nheight will the Flesh-fly dare to let her children drop? I top the\r\ntest-tube with another tube, the width of the neck of a claret-bottle.\r\nThe mouth is closed either with wire-gauze or with a paper cover with a\r\nslight cut in it. Altogether, the apparatus measures twenty-five inches\r\nin height. No matter: the fall is not serious for the lithe backs of\r\nthe young grubs; and, in a few days, the test-tube is filled with\r\nlarvae, in which it is easy to recognize the Flesh-fly's family by the\r\nfringed coronet that opens and shuts at the maggot's stern like the\r\npetals of a little flower. I did not see the mother operating: I was\r\nnot there at the time; but there is no doubt possible of her coming,\r\nnor of the great dive taken by the family: the contents of the\r\ntest-tube furnish me with a duly authenticated certificate.\r\n\r\nI admire the leap and, to obtain one better still, I replace the tube\r\nby another, so that the apparatus now stands forty-six inches high. The\r\ncolumn is erected at a spot frequented by Flies, in a dim light. Its\r\nmouth, closed with a wire-gauze cover, reaches the level of various\r\nother appliances, test-tubes and jars, which are already stocked or\r\nawaiting their colony of vermin. When the position is well-known to the\r\nFlies, I remove the other tubes and leave the column, lest the visitors\r\nshould turn aside to easier ground.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the Bluebottle and the Flesh-fly perch on the\r\ntrellis-work, make a short investigation and then decamp. Throughout\r\nthe summer season, for three whole months, the apparatus remains where\r\nit is, without result: never a worm. What is the reason? Does the\r\nstench of the meat not spread, coming from that depth? Certainly it\r\nspreads: it is unmistakable to my dulled nostrils and still more so to\r\nthe nostrils of my children, whom I call to bear witness. Then why does\r\nthe Flesh-fly, who but now was dropping her grubs from a goodly height,\r\nrefuse to let them fall from the top of a column twice as high? Does\r\nshe fear lest her worms should be bruised by an excessive drop? There\r\nis nothing about her to point to anxiety aroused by the length of the\r\nshaft. I never see her explore the tube or take its size. She stands on\r\nthe trellised orifice; and there the matter ends. Can she be apprised\r\nof the depth of the chasm by the comparative faintness of the offensive\r\nodours that arise from it? Can the sense of smell measure the distance\r\nand judge whether it be acceptable or not? Perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that, despite the attraction of the scent, the\r\nFlesh-fly does not expose her worms to disproportionate falls. Can she\r\nknow beforehand that, when the chrysalids break, her winged family,\r\nknocking with a sudden flight against the sides of a tall chimney, will\r\nbe unable to get out? This foresight would be in agreement with the\r\nrules which order maternal instinct according to future needs.\r\n\r\nBut, when the fall does not exceed a certain depth, the budding worms\r\nof the Flesh-fly are dropped without a qualm, as all our experiments\r\nshow. This principle has a practical application which is not without\r\nits value in matters of domestic economy. It is as well that the\r\nwonders of entomology should sometimes give us a hint of commonplace\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nThe usual meat-safe is a sort of large cage with a top and bottom of\r\nwood and four wire-gauze sides. Hooks fixed into the top are used\r\nwhereby to hang pieces which we wish to protect from the Flies. Often,\r\nso as to employ the space to the best advantage, these pieces are\r\nsimply laid on the floor of the cage. With these arrangements, are we\r\nsure of warding off the Fly and her vermin?\r\n\r\nNot at all. We may protect ourselves against the Bluebottle, who is not\r\nmuch inclined to lay her eggs at a distance from the meat; but there is\r\nstill the Flesh-fly, who is more venturesome and goes more briskly to\r\nwork and who will slip the grubs through a hole in the meshes and drop\r\nthem inside the safe. Agile as they are and well able to crawl, the\r\nworms will easily reach anything on the floor; the only things secure\r\nfrom their attacks will be the pieces hanging from the ceiling. It is\r\nnot in the nature of maggots to explore the heights, especially if this\r\nimplies climbing down a string in addition.\r\n\r\nPeople also use wire-gauze dish-covers. The trellised dome protects the\r\ncontents even less than does the meat-safe. The Flesh-fly takes no heed\r\nof it. She can drop her worms through the meshes on the covered joint.\r\n\r\nThen what are we to do? Nothing could be simpler. We need only wrap the\r\nbirds which we wish to preserve--Thrushes, Partridges, Snipe and so\r\non--in separate paper envelopes; and the same with our beef and mutton.\r\nThis defensive armour alone, while leaving ample room for the air to\r\ncirculate, makes any invasion by the worms impossible; even without a\r\ncover or a meat-safe: not that paper possesses any special preservative\r\nvirtues, but solely because it forms an impenetrable barrier. The\r\nBluebottle carefully refrains from laying her eggs upon it and the\r\nFlesh-fly from bringing forth her offspring, both of them knowing that\r\ntheir new-born young are incapable of piercing the obstacle.\r\n\r\nPaper is equally successful in our strife against the Moths, those\r\nplagues of our furs and clothes. To keep away these wholesale ravagers,\r\npeople generally use camphor, naphthalene, tobacco, bunches of\r\nlavender, and other strong-scented remedies. Without wishing to malign\r\nthose preservatives, we are bound to admit that the means employed are\r\nnone too effective. The smell does very little to prevent the havoc of\r\nthe Moths.\r\n\r\nI would therefore advise our housewives, instead of all this chemist's\r\nstuff, to use newspapers of a suitable shape and size. Take whatever\r\nyou wish to protect--your furs, your flannel, or your clothes--and pack\r\neach article carefully in a newspaper, joining the edges with a double\r\nfold, well pinned. If this joining is properly done, the Moth will\r\nnever get inside. Since my advice has been taken and this method\r\nemployed in my household, the old damage has no longer been repeated.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Fly. A piece of meat is hidden in a jar under a layer\r\nof fine, dry sand, a finger's-breadth thick. The jar has a wide mouth\r\nand is left quite open. Let whoso come that will, attracted by the\r\nsmell. The Bluebottles are not long in inspecting what I have prepared\r\nfor them: they enter the jar, go out and come back again, inquiring\r\ninto the invisible thing revealed by its fragrance. A diligent watch\r\nenables me to see them fussing about, exploring the sandy expanse,\r\ntapping it with their feet, sounding it with their proboscis. I leave\r\nthe visitors undisturbed for a fortnight or three weeks. None of them\r\nlays any eggs.\r\n\r\nThis is a repetition of what the paper bag, with its dead bird, showed\r\nme. The Flies refuse to lay on the sand, apparently for the same\r\nreasons. The paper was considered an obstacle which the frail vermin\r\nwould not be able to overcome. With sand, the case is worse. Its\r\ngrittiness would hurt the new-born weaklings, its dryness would absorb\r\nthe moisture indispensable to their movements. Later, when preparing\r\nfor the metamorphosis, when their strength has come to them, the grubs\r\nwill dig the earth quite well and be able to descend: but, at the\r\nstart, that would be very dangerous for them. Knowing these\r\ndifficulties, the mothers, however greatly tempted by the smell,\r\nabstain from breeding. As a matter of fact, after long waiting, fearing\r\nlest some packets of eggs may have escaped my attention, I inspect the\r\ncontents of the jar from top to bottom. Meat and sand contain neither\r\nlarvae nor pupae: the whole is absolutely deserted.\r\n\r\nThe layer of sand being only a finger's-breadth thick, this experiment\r\nrequires certain precautions. The meat may expand a little, in going\r\nbad, and protrude in one or two places. However small the fleshy eyots\r\nthat show above the surface, the Flies come to them and breed.\r\nSometimes also the juices oozing from the putrid meat soak a small\r\nextent of the sandy floor. That is enough for the maggot's first\r\nestablishment. These causes of failure are avoided with a layer of sand\r\nabout an inch thick. Then the Bluebottle, the Flesh-fly, and other\r\nFlies whose grubs batten on dead bodies are kept at a proper distance.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of awakening us to a proper sense of our insignificance,\r\npulpit orators sometimes make an unfair use of the grave and its worms.\r\nLet us put no faith in their doleful rhetoric. The chemistry of man's\r\nfinal dissolution is eloquent enough of our emptiness: there is no need\r\nto add imaginary horrors. The worm of the sepulchre is an invention of\r\ncantankerous minds, incapable of seeing things as they are. Covered by\r\nbut a few inches of earth, the dead can sleep their quiet sleep: no Fly\r\nwill ever come to take advantage of them.\r\n\r\nAt the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous invasion is\r\npossible; aye, it is the invariable rule. For the melting down and\r\nremoulding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than the\r\nlowest of the brutes. Then the Fly exercises her rights and deals with\r\nus as she does with any ordinary animal refuse. Nature treats us with\r\nmagnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed in\r\nher crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are 1 and all alike.\r\nThere you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours:\r\nequality in the presence of the maggot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. THE PINE-PROCESSIONARY.\r\n\r\nDrover Dingdong's Sheep followed the Ram which Panurge had maliciously\r\nthrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea, one after the other,\r\n\"for you know,\" says Rabelais, \"it is the nature of the sheep always to\r\nfollow the first, wheresoever it goes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike, not from foolishness, but\r\nfrom necessity: where the first goes all the others go, in a regular\r\nstring, with not an empty space between them.\r\n\r\nThey proceed in single file, in a continuous row, each touching with\r\nits head the rear of the one in front of it. The complex twists and\r\nturns described in his vagaries by the caterpillar leading the van are\r\nscrupulously described by all the others. No Greek theoria winding its\r\nway to the Eleusinian festivals was ever more orderly. Hence the name\r\nof Processionary given to the gnawer of the pine.\r\n\r\nHis character is complete when we add that he is a rope-dancer all his\r\nlife long: he walks only on the tight-rope, a silken rail placed in\r\nposition as he advances. The caterpillar who chances to be at the head\r\nof the procession dribbles his thread without ceasing and fixes it on\r\nthe path which his fickle preferences cause him to take. The thread is\r\nso tiny that the eye, though armed with a magnifying-glass, suspects it\r\nrather than sees it.\r\n\r\nBut a second caterpillar steps on the slender foot-board and doubles it\r\nwith his thread; a third trebles it; and all the others, however many\r\nthere be, add the sticky spray from their spinnerets, so much so that,\r\nwhen the procession has marched by, there remains, as a record of its\r\npassing, a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmers in the\r\nsun. Very much more sumptuous than ours, their system of road-making\r\nconsists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing. We sprinkle\r\nour roads with broken stones and level them by the pressure of a heavy\r\nsteam-roller; they lay over their paths a soft satin rail, a work of\r\ngeneral interest to which each contributes his thread.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of all this luxury? Could they not, like other\r\ncaterpillars, walk about without these costly preparations? I see two\r\nreasons for their mode of progression. It is night when the\r\nProcessionaries sally forth to browse upon the pine-leaves. They leave\r\ntheir nest, situated at the top of a bough, in profound darkness; they\r\ngo down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that has\r\nnot yet been gnawed, a branch which becomes lower and lower by degrees\r\nas the consumers finish stripping the upper storeys; they climb up this\r\nuntouched branch and spread over the green needles.\r\n\r\nWhen they have had their suppers and begin to feel the keen night air,\r\nthe next thing is to return to the shelter of the house. Measured in a\r\nstraight line, the distance is not great, hardly an arm's length; but\r\nit cannot be covered in this way on foot. The caterpillars have to\r\nclimb down from one crossing to the next, from the needle to the twig,\r\nfrom the twig to the branch, from the branch to the bough and from the\r\nbough, by a no less angular path, to go back home. It is useless to\r\nrely upon sight as a guide on this long and erratic journey. The\r\nProcessionary, it is true, has five ocular specks on either side of his\r\nhead, but they are so infinitesimal, so difficult to make out through\r\nthe magnifying-glass, that we cannot attribute to them any great power\r\nof vision. Besides, what good would those short-sighted lenses be in\r\nthe absence of light, in black darkness?\r\n\r\nIt is equally useless to think of the sense of smell. Has the\r\nProcessional any olfactory powers or has he not? I do not know. Without\r\ngiving a positive answer to the question, I can at least declare that\r\nhis sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him\r\nfind his way. This is proved, in my experiments, by a number of hungry\r\ncaterpillars that, after a long fast, pass close beside a pine-branch\r\nwithout betraying any eagerness of showing a sign of stopping. It is\r\nthe sense of touch that tells them where they are. So long as their\r\nlips do not chance to light upon the pasture-land, not one of them\r\nsettles there, though he be ravenous. They do not hasten to food which\r\nthey have scented from afar; they stop at a branch which they encounter\r\non their way.\r\n\r\nApart from sight and smell, what remains to guide them in returning to\r\nthe nest? The ribbon spun on the road. In the Cretan labyrinth, Theseus\r\nwould have been lost but for the clue of thread with which Ariadne\r\nsupplied him. The spreading maze of the pine-needles is, especially at\r\nnight, as inextricable a labyrinth as that constructed for Minos. The\r\nProcessionary finds his way through it, without the possibility of a\r\nmistake, by the aid of his bit of silk. At the time for going home,\r\neach easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the\r\nneighbouring threads, spread fanwise by the diverging herd; one by one\r\nthe scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon, which started from\r\nthe nest; and the sated caravan finds its way back to the manor with\r\nabsolute certainty.\r\n\r\nLonger expeditions are made in the daytime, even in winter, if the\r\nweather be fine. Our caterpillars then come down from the tree, venture\r\non the ground, march in procession for a distance of thirty yards or\r\nso. The object of these sallies is not to look for food, for the native\r\npine-tree is far from being exhausted: the shorn branches hardly count\r\namid the vast leafage. Moreover, the caterpillars observe complete\r\nabstinence till nightfall. The trippers have no other object than a\r\nconstitutional, a pilgrimage to the outskirts to see what these are\r\nlike, possibly an inspection of the locality where, later on, they mean\r\nto bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that, in these greater evolutions, the guiding\r\ncord is not neglected. It is now more necessary than ever. All\r\ncontribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets, as is the\r\ninvariable rule whenever there is a progression. Not one takes a step\r\nforward without fixing to the path the thread from his lips.\r\n\r\nIf the series forming the procession be at all long, the ribbon is\r\ndilated sufficiently to make it easy to find; nevertheless, on the\r\nhomeward journey, it is not picked up without some hesitation. For\r\nobserve that the caterpillars when on the march never turn completely;\r\nto wheel round on their tight-rope is a method utterly unknown to them.\r\nIn order therefore to regain the road already covered, they have to\r\ndescribe a zigzag whose windings and extent are determined by the\r\nleader's fancy. Hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes\r\nprolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of\r\ndoors. It is not a serious matter. They collect into a motionless\r\ncluster. To-morrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or\r\nlater be successful. Oftener still the winding curve meets the\r\nguide-thread at the first attempt. As soon as the first caterpillar has\r\nthe rail between his legs, all hesitation ceases; and the band makes\r\nfor the nest with hurried steps.\r\n\r\nThe use of this silk-tapestried roadway is evident from a second point\r\nof view. To protect himself against the severity of the winter which he\r\nhas to face when working, the Pine Caterpillar weaves himself a shelter\r\nin which he spends his bad hours, his days of enforced idleness. Alone,\r\nwith none but the meagre resources of his silk-glands, he would find\r\ndifficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the\r\nwinds. A substantial dwelling, proof against snow, gales and icy fogs,\r\nrequires the cooperation of a large number. Out of the individual's\r\npiled-up atoms, the community obtains a spacious and durable\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise takes a long time to complete. Every evening, when the\r\nweather permits, the building has to be strengthened and enlarged. It\r\nis indispensable, therefore, that the corporation of workers should not\r\nbe dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insects are\r\nstill in the caterpillar stage. But, without special arrangements, each\r\nnocturnal expedition at grazing-time would be a cause of separation. At\r\nthat moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism.\r\nThe caterpillars become more or less scattered, settling singly on the\r\nbranches around; each browses his pine-needle separately. How are they\r\nto find one another afterwards and become a community again?\r\n\r\nThe several threads left on the road make this easy. With that guide,\r\nevery caterpillar, however far he may be, comes back to his companions\r\nwithout ever missing the way. They come hurrying from a host of twigs,\r\nfrom here, from there, from above, from below; and soon the scattered\r\nlegion reforms into a group. The silk thread is something more than a\r\nroad-making expedient: it is the social bond, the system that keeps the\r\nmembers of the brotherhood indissolubly united.\r\n\r\nAt the head of every procession, long or short, goes a first\r\ncaterpillar whom I will call the leader of the march or file, though\r\nthe word leader, which I use for the want of a better, is a little out\r\nof place here. Nothing, in fact, distinguishes this caterpillar from\r\nthe others: it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line\r\nup; and mere chance brings him to the front. Among the Processionaries,\r\nevery captain is an officer of fortune. The actual leader leads;\r\npresently he will be a subaltern, if the line should break up in\r\nconsequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order.\r\n\r\nHis temporary functions give him an attitude of his own. While the\r\nothers follow passively in a close file, he, the captain, tosses\r\nhimself about and with an abrupt movement flings the front of his body\r\nhither and thither. As he marches ahead he seems to be seeking his way.\r\nDoes he in point of fact explore the country? Does he choose the most\r\npracticable places? Or are his hesitations merely the result of the\r\nabsence of a guiding thread on ground that has not yet been covered?\r\nHis subordinates follow very placidly, reassured by the cord which they\r\nhold between their legs; he, deprived of that support, is uneasy.\r\n\r\nWhy cannot I read what passes under his black, shiny skull, so like a\r\ndrop of tar to look at? To judge by actions, there is here a modicum of\r\ndiscernment which is able, after experimenting, to recognize excessive\r\nroughnesses, over-slippery surfaces, dusty places that offer no\r\nresistance and, above all, the threads left by other excursionists.\r\nThis is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the\r\nProcessionaries has taught me as to their mentality. Poor brains,\r\nindeed; poor creatures, whose commonwealth has its safety hanging upon\r\na thread!\r\n\r\nThe processions vary greatly in length. The finest that I have seen\r\nmanoeuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yards and\r\nnumbered about three hundred caterpillars, drawn up with absolute\r\nprecision in a wavy line. But, if there were only two in a row the\r\norder would still be perfect: the second touches and follows the first.\r\n\r\nBy February I have processions of all lengths in the greenhouse. What\r\ntricks can I play upon them? I see only two: to do away with the\r\nleader; and to cut the thread.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the leader of the file produces nothing striking. If\r\nthe thing is done without creating a disturbance, the procession does\r\nnot alter its ways at all. The second caterpillar, promoted to captain,\r\nknows the duties of his rank off-hand: he selects and leads, or rather\r\nhe hesitates and gropes.\r\n\r\nThe breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either. I remove\r\na caterpillar from the middle of the file. With my scissors, so as not\r\nto cause a commotion in the ranks, I cut the piece of ribbon on which\r\nhe stood and clear away every thread of it. As a result of this breach,\r\nthe procession acquires two marching leaders, each independent of the\r\nother. It may be that the one in the rear joins the file ahead of him,\r\nfrom which he is separated by but a slender interval; in that case,\r\nthings return to their original condition. More frequently, the two\r\nparts do not become reunited. In that case, we have two distinct\r\nprocessions, each of which wanders where it pleases and diverges from\r\nthe other. Nevertheless, both will be able to return to the nest by\r\ndiscovering sooner or later, in the course of their peregrinations, the\r\nribbon on the other side of the break.\r\n\r\nThese two experiments are only moderately interesting. I have thought\r\nout another, one more fertile in possibilities. I propose to make the\r\ncaterpillars describe a close circuit, after the ribbons running from\r\nit and liable to bring about a change of direction have been destroyed.\r\nThe locomotive engine pursues its invariable course so long as it is\r\nnot shunted on to a branch-line. If the Processionaries find the silken\r\nrail always clear in front of them, with no switches anywhere, will\r\nthey continue on the same track, will they persist in following a road\r\nthat never comes to an end? What we have to do is to produce this\r\ncircuit, which is unknown under ordinary conditions, by artificial\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nThe first idea that suggests itself is to seize with the forceps the\r\nsilk ribbon at the back of the train, to bend it without shaking it and\r\nto bring the end of it ahead of the file. If the caterpillar marching\r\nin the van steps upon it, the thing is done: the others will follow him\r\nfaithfully. The operation is very simple in theory but most difficult\r\nin practice and produces no useful results. The ribbon, which is\r\nextremely slight, breaks under the weight of the grains of sand that\r\nstick to it and are lifted with it. If it does not break, the\r\ncaterpillars at the back, however delicately we may go to work, feel a\r\ndisturbance which makes them curl up or even let go.\r\n\r\nThere is a yet greater difficulty: the leader refuses the ribbon laid\r\nbefore him; the cut end makes him distrustful. Failing to see the\r\nregular, uninterrupted road, he slants off to the right or left, he\r\nescapes at a tangent. If I try to interfere and to bring him back to\r\nthe path of my choosing, he persists in his refusal, shrivels up, does\r\nnot budge, and soon the whole procession is in confusion. We will not\r\ninsist: the method is a poor one, very wasteful of effort for at best a\r\nproblematical success.\r\n\r\nWe ought to interfere as little as possible and obtain a natural closed\r\ncircuit. Can it be done? Yes. It lies in our power, without the least\r\nmeddling, to see a procession march along a perfect circular track. I\r\nowe this result, which is eminently deserving of our attention, to pure\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nOn the shelf with the layer of sand in which the nests are planted\r\nstand some big palm-vases measuring nearly a yard and a half in\r\ncircumference at the top. The caterpillars often scale the sides and\r\nclimb up to the moulding which forms a cornice around the opening. This\r\nplace suits them for their processions, perhaps because of the absolute\r\nfirmness of the surface, where there is no fear of landslides, as on\r\nthe loose, sandy soil below; and also, perhaps, because of the\r\nhorizontal position, which is favourable to repose after the fatigue of\r\nthe ascent. It provides me with a circular track all ready-made. I have\r\nnothing to do but wait for an occasion propitious to my plans. This\r\noccasion is not long in coming.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, 1896, a little before twelve o'clock in the\r\nday, I discover a numerous troop making their way up and gradually\r\nreaching the popular cornice. Slowly, in single file, the caterpillars\r\nclimb the great vase, mount the ledge and advance in regular\r\nprocession, while others are constantly arriving and continuing the\r\nseries. I wait for the string to close up, that is to say, for the\r\nleader, who keeps following the circular moulding, to return to the\r\npoint from which he started. My object is achieved in a quarter of an\r\nhour. The closed circuit is realized magnificently, in something very\r\nnearly approaching a circle.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to get rid of the rest of the ascending column, which\r\nwould disturb the fine order of the procession by an excess of\r\nnewcomers; it is also important that we should do away with all the\r\nsilken paths, both new and old, that can put the cornice into\r\ncommunication with the ground. With a thick hair-pencil I sweep away\r\nthe surplus climbers; with a big brush, one that leaves no smell behind\r\nit--for this might afterwards prove confusing--I carefully rub down the\r\nvase and get rid of every thread which the caterpillars have laid on\r\nthe march. When these preparations are finished, a curious sight awaits\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn the interrupted circular procession there is no longer a leader.\r\nEach caterpillar is preceded by another on whose heels he follows\r\nguided by the silk track, the work of the whole party; he again has a\r\ncompanion close behind him, following him in the same orderly way. And\r\nthis is repeated without variation throughout the length of the chain.\r\nNone commands, or rather none modifies the trail according to his\r\nfancy; all obey, trusting in the guide who ought normally to lead the\r\nmarch and who in reality has been abolished by my trickery.\r\n\r\nFrom the first circuit of the edge of the tub the rail of silk has been\r\nlaid in position and is soon turned into a narrow ribbon by the\r\nprocession, which never ceases dribbling its thread as it goes. The\r\nrail is simply doubled and has no branches anywhere, for my brush has\r\ndestroyed them all. What will the caterpillars do on this deceptive,\r\nclosed path? Will they walk endlessly round and round until their\r\nstrength gives out entirely?\r\n\r\nThe old schoolmen were fond of quoting Buridan's Ass, that famous\r\nDonkey who, when placed between two bundles of hay, starved to death\r\nbecause he was unable to decide in favour of either by breaking the\r\nequilibrium between two equal but opposite attractions. They slandered\r\nthe worthy animal. The Ass, who is no more foolish than any one else,\r\nwould reply to the logical snare by feasting off both bundles. Will my\r\ncaterpillars show a little of his mother wit? Will they, after many\r\nattempts, be able to break the equilibrium of their closed circuit,\r\nwhich keeps them on a road without a turning? Will they make up their\r\nminds to swerve to this side or that, which is the only method of\r\nreaching their bundle of hay, the green branch yonder, quite near, not\r\ntwo feet off?\r\n\r\nI thought that they would and I was wrong. I said to myself:\r\n\r\n\"The procession will go on turning for some time, for an hour, two\r\nhours, perhaps; then the caterpillars will perceive their mistake. They\r\nwill abandon the deceptive road and make their descent somewhere or\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nThat they should remain up there, hard pressed by hunger and the lack\r\nof cover, when nothing prevented them from going away, seemed to me\r\ninconceivable imbecility. Facts, however, forced me to accept the\r\nincredible. Let us describe them in detail.\r\n\r\nThe circular procession begins, as I have said, on the 30th of January,\r\nabout midday, in splendid weather. The caterpillars march at an even\r\npace, each touching the stern of the one in front of him. The unbroken\r\nchain eliminates the leader with his changes of direction; and all\r\nfollow mechanically, as faithful to their circle as are the hands of a\r\nwatch. The headless file has no liberty left, no will; it has become\r\nmere clockwork. And this continues for hours and hours. My success goes\r\nfar beyond my wildest suspicions. I stand amazed at it, or rather I am\r\nstupefied.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the multiplied circuits change the original rail into a\r\nsuperb ribbon a twelfth of an inch broad. I can easily see it\r\nglittering on the red ground of the pot. The day is drawing to a close\r\nand no alteration has yet taken place in the position of the trail. A\r\nstriking proof confirms this.\r\n\r\nThe trajectory is not a plane curve, but one which, at a certain point,\r\ndeviates and goes down a little way to the lower surface of the\r\ncornice, returning to the top some eight inches farther. I marked these\r\ntwo points of deviation in pencil on the vase at the outset. Well, all\r\nthat afternoon and, more conclusive still, on the following days, right\r\nto the end of this mad dance, I see the string of caterpillars dip\r\nunder the ledge at the first point and come to the top again at the\r\nsecond. Once the first thread is laid, the road to be pursued is\r\npermanently established.\r\n\r\nIf the road does not vary, the speed does. I measure nine centimetres\r\n(3 1/2 inches.--Translator's Note.) a minute as the average distance\r\ncovered. But there are more or less lengthy halts; the pace slackens at\r\ntimes, especially when the temperature falls. At ten o'clock in the\r\nevening the walk is little more than a lazy swaying of the body. I\r\nforesee an early halt, in consequence of the cold, of fatigue and\r\ndoubtless also of hunger.\r\n\r\nGrazing-time has arrived. The caterpillars have come crowding from all\r\nthe nests in the greenhouse to browse upon the pine-branches planted by\r\nmyself beside the silken purses. Those in the garden do the same, for\r\nthe temperature is mild. The others, lined up along the earthenware\r\ncornice, would gladly take part in the feast; they are bound to have an\r\nappetite after a ten hours' walk. The branch stands green and tempting\r\nnot a hand's-breadth away. To reach it they need but go down; and the\r\npoor wretches, foolish slaves of their ribbon that they are, cannot\r\nmake up their minds to do so. I leave the famished ones at half-past\r\nten, persuaded that they will take counsel with their pillow and that\r\non the morrow things will have resumed their ordinary course.\r\n\r\nI was wrong. I was expecting too much of them when I accorded them that\r\nfaint gleam of intelligence which the tribulations of a distressful\r\nstomach ought, one would think, to have aroused. I visit them at dawn.\r\nThey are lined up as on the day before, but motionless. When the air\r\ngrows a little warmer, they shake off their torpor, revive and start\r\nwalking again. The circular procession begins anew, like that which I\r\nhave already seen. There is nothing more and nothing less to be noted\r\nin their machine-like obstinacy.\r\n\r\nThis time it is a bitter night. A cold snap has supervened, was indeed\r\nforetold in the evening by the garden caterpillars, who refused to come\r\nout despite appearances which to my duller senses seemed to promise a\r\ncontinuation of the fine weather. At daybreak the rosemary-walks are\r\nall asparkle with rime and for the second time this year there is a\r\nsharp frost. The large pond in the garden is frozen over. What can the\r\ncaterpillars in the conservatory be doing? Let us go and see.\r\n\r\nAll are ensconced in their nests, except the stubborn processionists on\r\nthe edge of the vase, who, deprived of shelter as they are, seem to\r\nhave spent a very bad night. I find them clustered in two heaps,\r\nwithout any attempt at order. They have suffered less from the cold,\r\nthus huddled together.\r\n\r\n'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody any good. The severity of the night\r\nhas caused the ring to break into two segments which will, perhaps,\r\nafford a chance of safety. Each group, as it survives and resumes its\r\nwalk, will presently be headed by a leader who, not being obliged to\r\nfollow a caterpillar in front of him, will possess some liberty of\r\nmovement and perhaps be able to make the procession swerve to one side.\r\nRemember that, in the ordinary processions, the caterpillar walking\r\nahead acts as a scout. While the others, if nothing occurs to create\r\nexcitement, keep to their ranks, he attends to his duties as a leader\r\nand is continually turning his head to this side and that,\r\ninvestigating, seeking, groping, making his choice. And things happen\r\nas he decides: the band follows him faithfully. Remember also that,\r\neven on a road which has already been travelled and beribboned, the\r\nguiding caterpillar continues to explore.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the Processionaries who have lost their\r\nway on the ledge will find a chance of safety here. Let us watch them.\r\nOn recovering from their torpor, the two groups line up by degrees into\r\ntwo distinct files. There are therefore two leaders, free to go where\r\nthey please, independent of each other. Will they succeed in leaving\r\nthe enchanted circle? At the sight of their large black heads swaying\r\nanxiously from side to side, I am inclined to think so for a moment.\r\nBut I am soon undeceived. As the ranks fill out, the two sections of\r\nthe chain meet and the circle is reconstituted. The momentary leaders\r\nonce more become simple subordinates; and again the caterpillars march\r\nround and round all day.\r\n\r\nFor the second time in succession, the night, which is very calm and\r\nmagnificently starry, brings a hard frost. In the morning the\r\nProcessionaries on the tub, the only ones who have camped unsheltered,\r\nare gathered into a heap which largely overflows both sides of the\r\nfatal ribbon. I am present at the awakening of the numbed ones. The\r\nfirst to take the road is, as luck will have it, outside the track.\r\nHesitatingly he ventures into unknown ground. He reaches the top of the\r\nrim and descends upon the other side on the earth in the vase. He is\r\nfollowed by six others, no more. Perhaps the rest of the troop, who\r\nhave not fully recovered from their nocturnal torpor, are too lazy to\r\nbestir themselves.\r\n\r\nThe result of this brief delay is a return to the old track. The\r\ncaterpillars embark on the silken trail and the circular march is\r\nresumed, this time in the form of a ring with a gap in it. There is no\r\nattempt, however, to strike a new course on the part of the guide whom\r\nthis gap has placed at the head. A chance of stepping outside the magic\r\ncircle has presented itself at last; and he does not know how to avail\r\nhimself of it.\r\n\r\nAs for the caterpillars who have made their way to the inside of the\r\nvase, their lot is hardly improved. They climb to the top of the palm,\r\nstarving and seeking for food. Finding nothing to eat that suits them,\r\nthey retrace their steps by following the thread which they have left\r\non the way, climb the ledge of the pot, strike the procession again\r\nand, without further anxiety, slip back into the ranks. Once more the\r\nring is complete, once more the circle turns and turns.\r\n\r\nThen when will the deliverance come? There is a legend that tells of\r\npoor souls dragged along in an endless round until the hellish charm is\r\nbroken by a drop of holy water. What drop will good fortune sprinkle on\r\nmy Processionaries to dissolve their circle and bring them back to the\r\nnest? I see only two means of conjuring the spell and obtaining a\r\nrelease from the circuit. These two means are two painful ordeals. A\r\nstrange linking of cause and effect: from sorrow and wretchedness good\r\nis to come.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, shriveling as the result of cold, the caterpillars gather\r\ntogether without any order, heap themselves some on the path, some,\r\nmore numerous these, outside it. Among the latter there may be, sooner\r\nor later, some revolutionary who, scorning the beaten track, will trace\r\nout a new road and lead the troop back home. We have just seen an\r\ninstance of it. Seven penetrated to the interior of the vase and\r\nclimbed the palm. True, it was an attempt with no result but still an\r\nattempt. For complete success, all that need be done would have been to\r\ntake the opposite slope. An even chance is a great thing. Another time\r\nwe shall be more successful.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the exhaustion due to fatigue and hunger. A lame\r\none stops, unable to go farther. In front of the defaulter the\r\nprocession still continues to wend its way for a short time. The ranks\r\nclose up and an empty space appears. On coming to himself and resuming\r\nthe march, the caterpillar who has caused the breach becomes a leader,\r\nhaving nothing before him. The least desire for emancipation is all\r\nthat he wants to make him launch the band into a new path which perhaps\r\nwill be the saving path.\r\n\r\nIn short, when the Processionaries' train is in difficulties, what it\r\nneeds, unlike ours, is to run off the rails. The side-tracking is left\r\nto the caprice of a leader who alone is capable of turning to the right\r\nor left; and this leader is absolutely non-existent so long as the ring\r\nremains unbroken. Lastly, the breaking of the circle, the one stroke of\r\nluck, is the result of a chaotic halt, caused principally by excess of\r\nfatigue or cold.\r\n\r\nThe liberating accident, especially that of fatigue, occurs fairly\r\noften. In the course of the same day, the moving circumference is cut\r\nup several times into two or three sections; but continuity soon\r\nreturns and no change takes place. Things go on just the same. The bold\r\ninnovator who is to save the situation has not yet had his inspiration.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new on the fourth day, after an icy night like the\r\nprevious one; nothing to tell except the following detail. Yesterday I\r\ndid not remove the trace left by the few caterpillars who made their\r\nway to the inside of the vase. This trace, together with a junction\r\nconnecting it with the circular road, is discovered in the course of\r\nthe morning. Half the troop takes advantage of it to visit the earth in\r\nthe pot and climb the palm; the other half remains on the ledge and\r\ncontinues to walk along the old rail. In the afternoon the band of\r\nemigrants rejoins the others, the circuit is completed and things\r\nreturn to their original condition.\r\n\r\nWe come to the fifth day. The night frost becomes more intense, without\r\nhowever as yet reaching the greenhouse. It is followed by bright\r\nsunshine in a calm and limpid sky. As soon as the sun's rays have\r\nwarmed the panes a little, the caterpillars, lying in heaps, wake up\r\nand resume their evolutions on the ledge of the vase. This time the\r\nfine order of the beginning is disturbed and a certain disorder becomes\r\nmanifest, apparently an omen of deliverance near at hand. The\r\nscouting-path inside the vase, which was upholstered in silk yesterday\r\nand the day before, is to-day followed to its origin on the rim by a\r\npart of the band and is then deserted after a short loop. The other\r\ncaterpillars follow the usual ribbon. The result of this bifurcation is\r\ntwo almost equal files, walking along the ledge in the same direction,\r\nat a short distance from each other, sometimes meeting, separating\r\nfarther on, in every case with some lack of order.\r\n\r\nWeariness increases the confusion. The crippled, who refuse to go on,\r\nare many. Breaches increase; files are split up into sections each of\r\nwhich has its leader, who pokes the front of his body this way and that\r\nto explore the ground. Everything seems to point to the disintegration\r\nwhich will bring safety. My hopes are once more disappointed. Before\r\nthe night the single file is reconstituted and the invincible gyration\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nHeat comes, just as suddenly as the cold did. To-day, the 4th of\r\nFebruary, is a beautiful, mild day. The greenhouse is full of life.\r\nNumerous festoons of caterpillars, issuing from the nests, meander\r\nalong the sand on the shelf. Above them, at every moment, the ring on\r\nthe ledge of the vase breaks up and comes together again. For the first\r\ntime I see daring leaders who, drunk with heat, standing only on their\r\nhinder prolegs at the extreme edge of the earthenware rim, fling\r\nthemselves forward into space, twisting about, sounding the depths. The\r\nendeavour is frequently repeated, while the whole troop stops. The\r\ncaterpillars' heads give sudden jerks, their bodies wriggle.\r\n\r\nOne of the pioneers decides to take the plunge. He slips under the\r\nledge. Four follow him. The others, still confiding in the perfidious\r\nsilken path, dare not copy him and continue to go along the old road.\r\n\r\nThe short string detached from the general chain gropes about a great\r\ndeal, hesitates long on the side of the vase; it goes half-way down,\r\nthen climbs up again slantwise, rejoins and takes its place in the\r\nprocession. This time the attempt has failed, though at the foot of the\r\nvase, not nine inches away, there lay a bunch of pine-needles which I\r\nhad placed there with the object of enticing the hungry ones. Smell and\r\nsight told them nothing. Near as they were to the goal, they went up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNo matter, the endeavour has its uses. Threads were laid on the way and\r\nwill serve as a lure to further enterprise. The road of deliverance has\r\nits first landmarks. And, two days later, on the eighth day of the\r\nexperiment, the caterpillars--now singly, anon in small groups, then\r\nagain in strings of some length--come down from the ledge by following\r\nthe staked-out path. At sunset the last of the laggards is back in the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nNow for a little arithmetic. For seven times twenty-four hours the\r\ncaterpillars have remained on the ledge of the vase. To make an ample\r\nallowance for stops due to the weariness of this one or that and above\r\nall for the rest taken during the colder hours of the night, we will\r\ndeduct one-half of the time. This leaves eighty-four hours' walking.\r\nThe average pace is nine centimetres a minute. (3 1/2\r\ninches.--Translator's Note.) The aggregate distance covered, therefore,\r\nis 453 metres, a good deal more than a quarter of a mile, which is a\r\ngreat walk for these little crawlers. The circumference of the vase,\r\nthe perimeter of the track, is exactly 1 metre 35. (4 feet 5\r\ninches.--Translator's Note.) Therefore the circle covered, always in\r\nthe same direction and always without result, was described three\r\nhundred and thirty-five times.\r\n\r\nThese figures surprise me, though I am already familiar with the\r\nabysmal stupidity of insects as a class whenever the least accident\r\noccurs. I feel inclined to ask myself whether the Processionaries were\r\nnot kept up there so long by the difficulties and dangers of the\r\ndescent rather than by the lack of any gleam of intelligence in their\r\nbenighted minds. The facts, however, reply that the descent is as easy\r\nas the ascent.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar has a very supple back, well adapted for twisting round\r\nprojections or slipping underneath. He can walk with the same ease\r\nvertically or horizontally, with his back down or up. Besides, he never\r\nmoves forward until he has fixed his thread to the ground. With this\r\nsupport to his feet, he has no falls to fear, no matter what his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nI had a proof of this before my eyes during a whole week. As I have\r\nalready said, the track, instead of keeping on one level, bends twice,\r\ndips at a certain point under the ledge of the vase and reappears at\r\nthe top a little farther on. At one part of the circuit, therefore, the\r\nprocession walks on the lower surface of the rim; and this inverted\r\nposition implies so little discomfort or danger that it is renewed at\r\neach turn for all the caterpillars from first to last.\r\n\r\nIt is out of the question then to suggest the dread of a false step on\r\nthe edge of the rim which is so nimbly turned at each point of\r\ninflexion. The caterpillars in distress, starved, shelterless, chilled\r\nwith cold at night, cling obstinately to the silk ribbon covered\r\nhundreds of times, because they lack the rudimentary glimmers of reason\r\nwhich would advise them to abandon it.\r\n\r\nExperience and reflection are not in their province. The ordeal of a\r\nfive hundred yards' march and three to four hundred turns teach them\r\nnothing; and it takes casual circumstances to bring them back to the\r\nnest. They would perish on their insidious ribbon if the disorder of\r\nthe nocturnal encampments and the halts due to fatigue did not cast a\r\nfew threads outside the circular path. Some three or four move along\r\nthese trails, laid without an object, stray a little way and, thanks to\r\ntheir wanderings, prepare the descent, which is at last accomplished in\r\nshort strings favoured by chance.\r\n\r\nThe school most highly honoured to-day is very anxious to find the\r\norigin of reason in the dregs of the animal kingdom. Let me call its\r\nattention to the Pine Processionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. THE SPIDERS.\r\n\r\nTHE NARBONNE LYCOSA, OR BLACK-BELLIED TARANTULA.\r\n\r\nTHE BURROW.\r\n\r\nMichelet has told us how, as a printer's apprentice in a cellar, he\r\nestablished amicable relations with a Spider. (Jules Michelet\r\n(1798-1874), author of \"L'Oiseau\" and \"L'Insecte,\" in addition to the\r\nhistorical works for which he is chiefly known. As a lad, he helped his\r\nfather, a printer by trade, in setting type.--Translator's Note.) At a\r\ncertain hour of the day, a ray of sunlight would glint through the\r\nwindow of the gloomy workshop and light up the little compositor's\r\ncase. Then his eight-legged neighbour would come down from her web and\r\non the edge of the case take her share of the sunshine. The boy did not\r\ninterfere with her; he welcomed the trusting visitor as a friend and as\r\na pleasant diversion from the long monotony. When we lack the society\r\nof our fellow-men, we take refuge in that of animals, without always\r\nlosing by the change.\r\n\r\nI do not, thank God, suffer from the melancholy of a cellar: my\r\nsolitude is gay with light and verdure; I attend, whenever I please,\r\nthe fields' high festival, the Thrushes' concert, the Crickets'\r\nsymphony; and yet my friendly commerce with the Spider is marked by an\r\neven greater devotion than the young type-setter's. I admit her to the\r\nintimacy of my study, I make room for her among my books, I set her in\r\nthe sun on my window-ledge, I visit her assiduously at her home, in the\r\ncountry. The object of our relations is not to create a means of escape\r\nfrom the petty worries of life, pin-pricks whereof I have my share like\r\nother men, a very large share, indeed; I propose to submit to the\r\nSpider a host of questions whereto, at times, she condescends to reply.\r\n\r\nTo what fair problems does not the habit of frequenting her give rise!\r\nTo set them forth worthily, the marvellous art which the little printer\r\nwas to acquire were not too much. One needs the pen of a Michelet; and\r\nI have but a rough, blunt pencil. Let us try, nevertheless: even when\r\npoorly clad, truth is still beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe most robust Spider in my district is the Narbonne Lycosa, or\r\nBlack-bellied Tarantula, clad in black velvet on the lower surface,\r\nespecially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey\r\nand white rings around the legs. Her favourite home is the dry, pebbly\r\nground, covered with sun-scorched thyme. In my harmas laboratory there\r\nare quite twenty of this Spider's burrows. Rarely do I pass by one of\r\nthese haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam, like\r\ndiamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of the hermit. The\r\nfour others, which are much smaller, are not visible at that depth.\r\n\r\nWould I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my\r\nhouse, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a\r\ndreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from\r\nstone to stone. The love of lucre has laid waste the land. Because wine\r\npaid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine. Then came\r\nthe Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land\r\nis now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy\r\ngrasses sprout among the pebbles. This waste-land is the Lycosa's\r\nparadise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred\r\nburrows within a limited range.\r\n\r\nThese dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and\r\nthen bent elbow-wise. The average diameter is an inch. On the edge of\r\nthe hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts\r\nand even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut. The whole is kept in\r\nplace and cemented with silk. Often, the Spider confines herself to\r\ndrawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties\r\ndown with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades\r\nfrom the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of\r\na masonry constructed of small stones. The nature of the kerb is\r\ndecided by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in\r\nthe close neighbourhood of the building-yard. There is no selection:\r\neverything meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.\r\n\r\nThe direction is perpendicular, in so far as obstacles, frequent in a\r\nsoil of this kind, permit. A bit of gravel can be extracted and hoisted\r\noutside; but a flint is an immovable boulder which the Spider avoids by\r\ngiving a bend to her gallery. If more such are met with, the residence\r\nbecomes a winding cave, with stone vaults, with lobbies communicating\r\nby means of sharp passages.\r\n\r\nThis lack of plan has no attendant drawbacks, so well does the owner,\r\nfrom long habit, know every corner and storey of her mansion. If any\r\ninteresting buzz occur overhead, the Lycosa climbs up from her rugged\r\nmanor with the same speed as from a vertical shaft. Perhaps she even\r\nfinds the windings and turnings an advantage, when she has to drag into\r\nher den a prey that happens to defend itself.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the end of the burrow widens into a side-chamber, a lounge\r\nor resting-place where the Spider meditates at length and is content to\r\nlead a life of quiet when her belly is full.\r\n\r\nWhen she reaches maturity and is once settled, the Lycosa becomes\r\neminently domesticated. I have been living in close communion with her\r\nfor the last three years. I have installed her in large earthen pans on\r\nthe window-sills of my study and I have her daily under my eyes. Well,\r\nit is very rarely that I happen on her outside, a few inches from her\r\nhole, back to which she bolts at the least alarm.\r\n\r\nWe may take it then that, when not in captivity, the Lycosa does not go\r\nfar afield to gather the wherewithal to build her parapet and that she\r\nmakes shift with what she finds upon her threshold. In these\r\nconditions, the building-stones are soon exhausted and the masonry\r\nceases for lack of materials.\r\n\r\nThe wish came over me to see what dimensions the circular edifice would\r\nassume, if the Spider were given an unlimited supply. With captives to\r\nwhom I myself act as purveyor the thing is easy enough. Were it only\r\nwith a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these\r\nrelations with the big Spider of the waste-lands, let me describe how\r\nmy subjects are housed.\r\n\r\nA good-sized earthenware pan, some nine inches deep, is filled with a\r\nred, clayey earth, rich in pebbles, similar, in short, to that of the\r\nplaces haunted by the Lycosa. Properly moistened into a paste, the\r\nartificial soil is heaped, layer by layer, around a central reed, of a\r\nbore equal to that of the animal's natural burrow. When the receptacle\r\nis filled to the top, I withdraw the reed, which leaves a yawning,\r\nperpendicular shaft. I thus obtain the abode which shall replace that\r\nof the fields.\r\n\r\nTo find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk in the\r\nneighbourhood. When removed from her own dwelling, which is turned\r\ntopsy-turvy by my trowel, and placed in possession of the den produced\r\nby my art, the Lycosa at once disappears into that den. She does not\r\ncome out again, seeks nothing better elsewhere. A large wire-gauze\r\ncover rests on the soil in the pan and prevents escape.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the watch, in this respect, makes no demand upon my\r\ndiligence. The prisoner is satisfied with her new abode and manifests\r\nno regret for her natural burrow. There is no attempt at flight on her\r\npart. Let me not omit to add that each pan must receive not more than\r\none inhabitant. The Lycosa is very intolerant. To her a neighbour is\r\nfair game, to be eaten without scruple when one has might on one's\r\nside. Time was when, unaware of this fierce intolerance, which is more\r\nsavage still at breeding time, I saw hideous orgies perpetrated in my\r\noverstocked cages. I shall have occasion to describe those tragedies\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nLet us meanwhile consider the isolated Lycosae. They do not touch up\r\nthe dwelling which I have moulded for them with a bit of reed; at most,\r\nnow and again, perhaps with the object of forming a lounge or bedroom\r\nat the bottom, they fling out a few loads of rubbish. But all, little\r\nby little, build the kerb that is to edge the mouth.\r\n\r\nI have given them plenty of first-rate materials, far superior to those\r\nwhich they use when left to their own resources. These consist, first,\r\nfor the foundations, of little smooth stones, some of which are as\r\nlarge as an almond. With this road-metal are mingled short strips of\r\nraphia, or palm-fibre, flexible ribbons, easily bent. These stand for\r\nthe Spider's usual basket-work, consisting of slender stalks and dry\r\nblades of grass. Lastly, by way of an unprecedented treasure, never yet\r\nemployed by a Lycosa, I place at my captives' disposal some thick\r\nthreads of wool, cut into inch lengths.\r\n\r\nAs I wish, at the same time, to find out whether my animals, with the\r\nmagnificent lenses of their eyes, are able to distinguish colours and\r\nprefer one colour to another, I mix up bits of wool of different hues:\r\nthere are red, green, white, and yellow pieces. If the Spider have any\r\npreference, she can choose where she pleases.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa always works at night, a regrettable circumstance, which\r\ndoes not allow me to follow the worker's methods. I see the result; and\r\nthat is all. Were I to visit the building-yard by the light of a\r\nlantern, I should be no wiser. The Spider, who is very shy, would at\r\nonce dive into her lair; and I should have lost my sleep for nothing.\r\nFurthermore, she is not a very diligent labourer; she likes to take her\r\ntime. Two or three bits of wool or raphia placed in position represent\r\na whole night's work. And to this slowness we must add long spells of\r\nutter idleness.\r\n\r\nTwo months pass; and the result of my liberality surpasses my\r\nexpectations. Possessing more windfalls than they know what to do with,\r\nall picked up in their immediate neighbourhood, my Lycosae have built\r\nthemselves donjon-keeps the like of which their race has not yet known.\r\nAround the orifice, on a slightly sloping bank, small, flat, smooth\r\nstones have been laid to form a broken, flagged pavement. The larger\r\nstones, which are Cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal\r\nthat has shifted them, are employed as abundantly as the others.\r\n\r\nOn this rockwork stands the donjon. It is an interlacing of raphia and\r\nbits of wool, picked up at random, without distinction of shade. Red\r\nand white, green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order. The\r\nLycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate result is a sort of muff, a couple of inches high. Bands\r\nof silk, supplied by the spinnerets, unite the pieces, so that the\r\nwhole resembles a coarse fabric. Without being absolutely faultless,\r\nfor there are always awkward pieces on the outside, which the worker\r\ncould not handle, the gaudy building is not devoid of merit. The bird\r\nlining its nest would do no better. Whoso sees the curious,\r\nmany-coloured productions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my\r\nindustry, contrived with a view to some experimental mischief; and his\r\nsurprise is great when I confess who the real author is. No one would\r\never believe the Spider capable of constructing such a monument.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that, in a state of liberty, on our barren\r\nwaste-lands, the Lycosa does not indulge in such sumptuous\r\narchitecture. I have given the reason: she is too great a stay-at-home\r\nto go in search of materials and she makes use of the limited resources\r\nwhich she finds around her. Bits of earth, small chips of stone, a few\r\ntwigs, a few withered grasses: that is all, or nearly all. Wherefore\r\nthe work is generally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly\r\nattracts attention.\r\n\r\nMy captives teach us that, when materials are plentiful, especially\r\ntextile materials that remove all fears of landslip, the Lycosa\r\ndelights in tall turrets. She understands the art of donjon-building\r\nand puts it into practice as often as she possesses the means.\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this turret? My pans will tell us that. An\r\nenthusiastic votary of the chase, so long as she is not permanently\r\nfixed, the Lycosa, once she has set up house, prefers to lie in ambush\r\nand wait for the quarry. Every day, when the heat is greatest, I see my\r\ncaptives come up slowly from under ground and lean upon the battlements\r\nof their woolly castle-keep. They are then really magnificent in their\r\nstately gravity. With their swelling belly contained within the\r\naperture, their head outside, their glassy eyes staring, their legs\r\ngathered for a spring, for hours and hours they wait, motionless,\r\nbathing voluptuously in the sun.\r\n\r\nShould a tit-bit to her liking happen to pass, forthwith the watcher\r\ndarts from her tall tower, swift as an arrow from the bow. With a\r\ndagger-thrust in the neck, she stabs the jugular of the Locust,\r\nDragon-fly or other prey whereof I am the purveyor; and she as quickly\r\nscales the donjon and retires with her capture. The performance is a\r\nwonderful exhibition of skill and speed.\r\n\r\nVery seldom is a quarry missed, provided that it pass at a convenient\r\ndistance, within the range of the huntress' bound. But, if the prey be\r\nat some distance, for instance on the wire of the cage, the Lycosa\r\ntakes no notice of it. Scorning to go in pursuit, she allows it to roam\r\nat will. She never strikes except when sure of her stroke. She achieves\r\nthis by means of her tower. Hiding behind the wall, she sees the\r\nstranger advancing, keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he\r\ncomes within reach. These abrupt tactics make the thing a certainty.\r\nThough he were winged and swift of flight, the unwary one who\r\napproaches the ambush is lost.\r\n\r\nThis presumes, it is true, an exemplary patience on the Lycosa's part;\r\nfor the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims. At best,\r\nthe ledge provided by the turret may, at rare intervals, tempt some\r\nweary wayfarer to use it as a resting-place. But, if the quarry do not\r\ncome to-day, it is sure to come to-morrow, the next day, or later, for\r\nthe Locusts hop innumerable in the waste-land, nor are they always able\r\nto regulate their leaps. Some day or other, chance is bound to bring\r\none of them within the purlieus of the burrow. This is the moment to\r\nspring upon the pilgrim from the ramparts. Until then, we maintain a\r\nstoical vigilance. We shall dine when we can; but we shall end by\r\ndining.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa, therefore, well aware of these lingering eventualities,\r\nwaits and is not unduly distressed by a prolonged abstinence. She has\r\nan accommodating stomach, which is satisfied to be gorged to-day and to\r\nremain empty afterwards for goodness knows how long. I have sometimes\r\nneglected my catering duties for weeks at a time; and my boarders have\r\nbeen none the worse for it. After a more or less protracted fast, they\r\ndo not pine away, but are smitten with a wolf-like hunger. All these\r\nravenous eaters are alike: they guzzle to excess to-day, in\r\nanticipation of to-morrow's dearth.\r\n\r\nTHE LAYING.\r\n\r\nChance, a poor stand-by, sometimes contrives very well. At the\r\nbeginning of the month of August, the children call me to the far side\r\nof the enclosure, rejoicing in a find which they have made under the\r\nrosemary-bushes. It is a magnificent Lycosa, with an enormous belly,\r\nthe sign of an impending delivery.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning, ten days later, I find her preparing for her\r\nconfinement. A silk network is first spun on the ground, covering an\r\nextent about equal to the palm of one's hand. It is coarse and\r\nshapeless, but firmly fixed. This is the floor on which the Spider\r\nmeans to operate.\r\n\r\nOn this foundation, which acts as a protection from the sand, the\r\nLycosa fashions a round mat, the size of a two-franc piece and made of\r\nsuperb white silk. With a gentle, uniform movement, which might be\r\nregulated by the wheels of a delicate piece of clockwork, the tip of\r\nthe abdomen rises and falls, each time touching the supporting base a\r\nlittle farther away, until the extreme scope of the mechanism is\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nThen, without the Spider's moving her position, the oscillation is\r\nresumed in the opposite direction. By means of this alternate motion,\r\ninterspersed with numerous contacts, a segment of the sheet is\r\nobtained, of a very accurate texture. When this is done, the Spider\r\nmoves a little along a circular line and the loom works in the same\r\nmanner on another segment.\r\n\r\nThe silk disk, a sort of hardy concave paten, now no longer receives\r\nanything from the spinnerets in its centre; the marginal belt alone\r\nincreases in thickness. The piece thus becomes a bowl-shaped porringer,\r\nsurrounded by a wide, flat edge.\r\n\r\nThe time for the laying has come. With one quick emission, the viscous,\r\npale-yellow eggs are laid in the basin, where they heap together in the\r\nshape of a globe which projects largely outside the cavity. The\r\nspinnerets are once more set going. With short movements, as the tip of\r\nthe abdomen rises and falls to weave the round mat, they cover up the\r\nexposed hemisphere. The result is a pill set in the middle of a\r\ncircular carpet.\r\n\r\nThe legs, hitherto idle, are now working. They take up and break off\r\none by one the threads that keep the round mat stretched on the coarse\r\nsupporting network. At the same time the fangs grip this sheet, lift it\r\nby degrees, tear it from its base and fold it over upon the globe of\r\neggs. It is a laborious operation. The whole edifice totters, the floor\r\ncollapses, fouled with sand. By a movement of the legs, those soiled\r\nshreds are cast aside. Briefly, by means of violent tugs of the fangs,\r\nwhich pull, and broom-like efforts of the legs, which clear away, the\r\nLycosa extricates the bag of eggs and removes it as a clear-cut mass,\r\nfree from any adhesion.\r\n\r\nIt is a white-silk pill, soft to the touch and glutinous. Its size is\r\nthat of an average cherry. An observant eye will notice, running\r\nhorizontally around the middle, a fold which a needle is able to raise\r\nwithout breaking it. This hem, generally undistinguishable from the\r\nrest of the surface, is none other than the edge of the circular mat,\r\ndrawn over the lower hemisphere. The other hemisphere, through which\r\nthe youngsters will go out, is less well fortified: its only wrapper is\r\nthe texture spun over the eggs immediately after they were laid.\r\n\r\nThe work of spinning, followed by that of tearing, is continued for a\r\nwhole morning, from five to nine o'clock. Worn out with fatigue, the\r\nmother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless. I shall see no\r\nmore to-day. Next morning, I find the Spider carrying the bag of eggs\r\nslung from her stern.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, until the hatching, she does not leave go of the precious\r\nburden, which, fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament, drags\r\nand bumps along the ground. With this load banging against her heels,\r\nshe goes about her business; she walks or rests, she seeks her prey,\r\nattacks it and devours it. Should some accident cause the wallet to\r\ndrop off, it is soon replaced. The spinnerets touch it somewhere,\r\nanywhere, and that is enough: adhesion is at once restored.\r\n\r\nWhen the work is done, some of them emancipate themselves, think they\r\nwill have a look at the country before retiring for good and all. It is\r\nthese whom we meet at times, wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag\r\nbehind them. Sooner or later, however, the vagrants return home; and\r\nthe month of August is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow\r\nwill bring the mother up, with her wallet slung behind her. I am able\r\nto procure as many as I want and, with them, to indulge in certain\r\nexperiments of the highest interest.\r\n\r\nIt is a sight worth seeing, that of the Lycosa dragging her treasure\r\nafter her, never leaving it, day or night, sleeping or waking, and\r\ndefending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe. If I\r\ntry to take the bag from her, she presses it to her breast in despair,\r\nhangs on to my pincers, bites them with her poison-fangs. I can hear\r\nthe daggers grating on the steel. No, she would not allow herself to be\r\nrobbed of the wallet with impunity, if my fingers were not supplied\r\nwith an implement.\r\n\r\nBy dint of pulling and shaking the pill with the forceps, I take it\r\nfrom the Lycosa, who protests furiously. I fling her in exchange a pill\r\ntaken from another Lycosa. It is at once seized in the fangs, embraced\r\nby the legs and hung on to the spinneret. Her own or another's: it is\r\nall one to the Spider, who walks away proudly with the alien wallet.\r\nThis was to be expected, in view of the similarity of the pills\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nA test of another kind, with a second subject, renders the mistake more\r\nstriking. I substitute, in the place of the lawful bag which I have\r\nremoved, the work of the Silky Epeira. The colour and softness of the\r\nmaterial are the same in both cases; but the shape is quite different.\r\nThe stolen object is a globe; the object presented in exchange is an\r\nelliptical conoid studded with angular projections along the edge of\r\nthe base. The Spider takes no account of this dissimilarity. She\r\npromptly glues the queer bag to her spinnerets and is as pleased as\r\nthough she were in possession of her real pill. My experimental\r\nvillainies have no other consequence beyond an ephemeral carting. When\r\nhatching-time arrives, early in the case of Lycosa, late in that of the\r\nEpeira, the gulled Spider abandons the strange bag and pays it no\r\nfurther attention.\r\n\r\nLet us penetrate yet deeper into the wallet-bearer's stupidity. After\r\ndepriving the Lycosa of her eggs, I throw her a ball of cork, roughly\r\npolished with a file and of the same size as the stolen pill. She\r\naccepts the corky substance, so different from the silk purse, without\r\nthe least demur. One would have thought that she would recognize her\r\nmistake with those eight eyes of hers, which gleam like precious\r\nstones. The silly creature pays no attention. Lovingly she embraces the\r\ncork ball, fondles it with her palpi, fastens it to her spinnerets and\r\nthenceforth drags it after her as though she were dragging her own bag.\r\n\r\nLet us give another the choice between the imitation and the real. The\r\nrightful pill and the cork ball are placed together on the floor of the\r\njar. Will the Spider be able to know the one that belongs to her? The\r\nfool is incapable of doing so. She makes a wild rush and seizes\r\nhaphazard at one time her property, at another my sham product.\r\nWhatever is first touched becomes a good capture and is forthwith hung\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIf I increase the number of cork balls, if I put in four or five of\r\nthem, with the real pill among them, it is seldom that the Lycosa\r\nrecovers her own property. Attempts at inquiry, attempts at selection\r\nthere are none. Whatever she snaps up at random she sticks to, be it\r\ngood or bad. As there are more of the sham pills of cork, these are the\r\nmost often seized by the Spider.\r\n\r\nThis obtuseness baffles me. Can the animal be deceived by the soft\r\ncontact of the cork? I replace the cork balls by pellets of cotton or\r\npaper, kept in their round shape with a few bands of thread. Both are\r\nvery readily accepted instead of the real bag that has been removed.\r\n\r\nCan the illusion be due to the colouring, which is light in the cork\r\nand not unlike the tint of the silk globe when soiled with a little\r\nearth, while it is white in the paper and the cotton, when it is\r\nidentical with that of the original pill? I give the Lycosa, in\r\nexchange for her work, a pellet of silk thread, chosen of a fine red,\r\nthe brightest of all colours. The uncommon pill is as readily accepted\r\nand as jealously guarded as the others.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks and more the Lycosa trails the bag of eggs hanging to\r\nher spinnerets. The reader will remember the experiments described in\r\nthe preceding section, particularly those with the cork ball and the\r\nthread pellet which the Spider so foolishly accepts in exchange for the\r\nreal pill. Well, this exceedingly dull-witted mother, satisfied with\r\naught that knocks against her heels, is about to make us wonder at her\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nWhether she come up from her shaft to lean upon the kerb and bask in\r\nthe sun, whether she suddenly retire underground in the face of danger,\r\nor whether she be roaming the country before settling down, never does\r\nshe let go her precious bag, that very cumbrous burden in walking,\r\nclimbing or leaping. If, by some accident, it become detached from the\r\nfastening to which it is hung, she flings herself madly on her treasure\r\nand lovingly embraces it, ready to bite whoso would take it from her. I\r\nmyself am sometimes the thief. I then hear the points of the\r\npoison-fangs grinding against the steel of my pincers, which tug in one\r\ndirection while the Lycosa tugs in the other. But let us leave the\r\nanimal alone: with a quick touch of the spinnerets, the pill is\r\nrestored to its place; and the Spider strides off, still menacing.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of summer, all the householders, old or young, whether\r\nin captivity on the window-sill or at liberty in the paths of the\r\nenclosure, supply me daily with the following improving sight. In the\r\nmorning, as soon as the sun is hot and beats upon their burrow, the\r\nanchorites come up from the bottom with their bag and station\r\nthemselves at the opening. Long siestas on the threshold in the sun are\r\nthe order of the day throughout the fine season; but, at the present\r\ntime, the position adopted is a different one. Formerly, the Lycosa\r\ncame out into the sun for her own sake. Leaning on the parapet, she had\r\nthe front half of her body outside the pit and the hinder half inside.\r\nThe eyes took their fill of light; the belly remained in the dark. When\r\ncarrying her egg-bag, the Spider reverses the posture: the front is in\r\nthe pit, the rear outside. With her hind-legs she holds the white pill\r\nbulging with germs lifted above the entrance; gently she turns and\r\nturns it, so as to present every side to the life-giving rays. And this\r\ngoes on for half the day, so long as the temperature is high; and it is\r\nrepeated daily, with exquisite patience, during three or four weeks. To\r\nhatch its eggs, the bird covers them with the quilt of its breast; it\r\nstrains them to the furnace of its heart. The Lycosa turns hers in\r\nfront of the hearth of hearths: she gives them the sun as an incubator.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of September the young ones, who have been some time\r\nhatched, are ready to come out.\r\n\r\nThe whole family emerges from the bag straightway. Then and there, the\r\nyoungsters climb to the mother's back. As for the empty bag, now a\r\nworthless shred, it is flung out of the burrow; the Lycosa does not\r\ngive it a further thought. Huddled together, sometimes in two or three\r\nlayers, according to their number, the little ones cover the whole back\r\nof the mother, who, for seven or eight months to come, will carry her\r\nfamily night and day. Nowhere can we hope to see a more edifying\r\ndomestic picture than that of the Lycosa clothed in her young.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I meet a little band of gipsies passing along the\r\nhigh-road on their way to some neighbouring fair. The new-born babe\r\nmewls on the mother's breast, in a hammock formed out of a kerchief.\r\nThe last-weaned is carried pick-a-back; a third toddles clinging to its\r\nmother's skirts; others follow closely, the biggest in the rear,\r\nferreting in the blackberry-laden hedgerows. It is a magnificent\r\nspectacle of happy-go-lucky fruitfulness. They go their way, penniless\r\nand rejoicing. The sun is hot and the earth is fertile.\r\n\r\nBut how this picture pales before that of the Lycosa, that incomparable\r\ngipsy whose brats are numbered by the hundred! And one and all of them,\r\nfrom September to April, without a moment's respite, find room upon the\r\npatient creature's back, where they are content to lead a tranquil life\r\nand to be carted about.\r\n\r\nThe little ones are very good; none moves, none seeks a quarrel with\r\nhis neighbours. Clinging together, they form a continuous drapery, a\r\nshaggy ulster under which the mother becomes unrecognizable. Is it an\r\nanimal, a fluff of wool, a cluster of small seeds fastened to one\r\nanother? 'Tis impossible to tell at the first glance.\r\n\r\nThe equilibrium of this living blanket is not so firm but that falls\r\noften occur, especially when the mother climbs from indoors and comes\r\nto the threshold to let the little ones take the sun. The least brush\r\nagainst the gallery unseats a part of the family. The mishap is not\r\nserious. The Hen, fidgeting about her Chicks, looks for the strays,\r\ncalls them, gathers them together. The Lycosa knows not these maternal\r\nalarms. Impassively, she leaves those who drop off to manage their own\r\ndifficulty, which they do with wonderful quickness. Commend me to those\r\nyoungsters for getting up without whining, dusting themselves and\r\nresuming their seat in the saddle! The unhorsed ones promptly find a\r\nleg of the mother, the usual climbing-pole; they swarm up it as fast as\r\nthey can and recover their places on the bearer's back. The living bark\r\nof animals is reconstructed in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nTo speak here of mother-love were, I think, extravagant. The Lycosa's\r\naffection for her offspring hardly surpasses that of the plant, which\r\nis unacquainted with any tender feeling and nevertheless bestows the\r\nnicest and most delicate care upon its seeds. The animal, in many\r\ncases, knows no other sense of motherhood. What cares the Lycosa for\r\nher brood! She accepts another's as readily as her own; she is\r\nsatisfied so long as her back is burdened with a swarming crowd,\r\nwhether it issue from her ovaries or elsewhere. There is no question\r\nhere of real maternal affection.\r\n\r\nI have described elsewhere the prowess of the Copris watching over\r\ncells that are not her handiwork and do not contain her offspring. With\r\na zeal which even the additional labour laid upon her does not easily\r\nweary, she removes the mildew from the alien dung-balls, which far\r\nexceed the regular nests in number; she gently scrapes and polishes and\r\nrepairs them; she listens attentively and enquires by ear into each\r\nnurseling's progress. Her real collection could not receive greater\r\ncare. Her own family or another's: it is all one to her.\r\n\r\nThe Lycosa is equally indifferent. I take a hair-pencil and sweep the\r\nliving burden from one of my Spiders, making it fall close to another\r\ncovered with her little ones. The evicted youngsters scamper about,\r\nfind the new mother's legs outspread, nimbly clamber up these and mount\r\non the back of the obliging creature, who quietly lets them have their\r\nway. They slip in among the others, or, when the layer is too thick,\r\npush to the front and pass from the abdomen to the thorax and even to\r\nthe head, though leaving the region of the eyes uncovered. It does not\r\ndo to blind the bearer: the common safety demands that. They know this\r\nand respect the lenses of the eyes, however populous the assembly be.\r\nThe whole animal is now covered with a swarming carpet of young, all\r\nexcept the legs, which must preserve their freedom of action, and the\r\nunder part of the body, where contact with the ground is to be feared.\r\n\r\nMy pencil forces a third family upon the already over-burdened Spider;\r\nand this too is peacefully accepted. The youngsters huddle up closer,\r\nlie one on top of the other in layers and room is found for all. The\r\nLycosa has lost the last semblance of an animal, has become a nameless\r\nbristling thing that walks about. Falls are frequent and are followed\r\nby continual climbings.\r\n\r\nI perceive that I have reached the limits, not of the bearer's\r\ngood-will, but of equilibrium. The Spider would adopt an indefinite\r\nfurther number of foundlings, if the dimensions of her back afforded\r\nthem a firm hold. Let us be content with this. Let us restore each\r\nfamily to its mother, drawing at random from the lot. There must\r\nnecessarily be interchanges, but that is of no importance: real\r\nchildren and adopted children are the same thing in the Lycosa's eyes.\r\n\r\nOne would like to know if, apart from my artifices, in circumstances\r\nwhere I do not interfere, the good-natured dry-nurse sometimes burdens\r\nherself with a supplementary family; it would also be interesting to\r\nlearn what comes of this association of lawful offspring and strangers.\r\nI have ample materials wherewith to obtain an answer to both questions.\r\nI have housed in the same cage two elderly matrons laden with\r\nyoungsters. Each has her home as far removed from the other's as the\r\nsize of the common pan permits. The distance is nine inches or more. It\r\nis not enough. Proximity soon kindles fierce jealousies between those\r\nintolerant creatures, who are obliged to live far apart so as to secure\r\nadequate hunting-grounds.\r\n\r\nOne morning I catch the two harridans fighting out their quarrel on the\r\nfloor. The loser is laid flat upon her back; the victress, belly to\r\nbelly with her adversary, clutches her with her legs and prevents her\r\nfrom moving a limb. Both have their poison-fangs wide open, ready to\r\nbite without yet daring, so mutually formidable are they. After a\r\ncertain period of waiting, during which the pair merely exchange\r\nthreats, the stronger of the two, the one on top, closes her lethal\r\nengine and grinds the head of the prostrate foe. Then she calmly\r\ndevours the deceased by small mouthfuls.\r\n\r\nNow what do the youngsters do, while their mother is being eaten?\r\nEasily consoled, heedless of the atrocious scene, they climb on the\r\nconqueror's back and quietly take their places among the lawful family.\r\nThe ogress raises no objection, accepts them as her own. She makes a\r\nmeal off the mother and adopts the orphans.\r\n\r\nLet us add that, for many months yet, until the final emancipation\r\ncomes, she will carry them without drawing any distinction between them\r\nand her own young. Henceforth the two families, united in so tragic a\r\nfashion, will form but one. We see how greatly out of place it would be\r\nto speak, in this connection, of mother-love and its fond\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\nDoes the Lycosa at least feed the younglings who, for seven months,\r\nswarm upon her back? Does she invite them to the banquet when she has\r\nsecured a prize? I thought so at first; and, anxious to assist at the\r\nfamily repast, I devoted special attention to watching the mothers eat.\r\nAs a rule, the prey is consumed out of sight, in the burrow; but\r\nsometimes also a meal is taken on the threshold, in the open air.\r\nBesides, it is easy to rear the Lycosa and her family in a wire-gauze\r\ncage, with a layer of earth wherein the captive will never dream of\r\nsinking a well, such work being out of season. Everything then happens\r\nin the open.\r\n\r\nWell, while the mother munches, chews, expresses the juices and\r\nswallows, the youngsters do not budge from their camping-ground on her\r\nback. Not one quits its place nor gives a sign of wishing to slip down\r\nand join in the meal. Nor does the mother extend an invitation to them\r\nto come and recruit themselves, nor put any broken victuals aside for\r\nthem. She feeds and the others look on, or rather remain indifferent to\r\nwhat is happening. Their perfect quiet during the Lycosa's feast points\r\nto the possession of a stomach that knows no cravings.\r\n\r\nThen with what are they sustained, during their seven months'\r\nupbringing on the mother's back? One conceives a notion of exudations\r\nsupplied by the bearer's body, in which case the young would feed on\r\ntheir mother, after the manner of parasitic vermin, and gradually drain\r\nher strength.\r\n\r\nWe must abandon this notion. Never are they seen to put their mouths to\r\nthe skin that should be a sort of teat to them. On the other hand, the\r\nLycosa, far from being exhausted and shrivelling, keeps perfectly well\r\nand plump. She has the same pot-belly when she finishes rearing her\r\nyoung as when she began. She has not lost weight: far from it; on the\r\ncontrary, she has put on flesh: she has gained the wherewithal to beget\r\na new family next summer, one as numerous as to-day's.\r\n\r\nOnce more, with what do the little ones keep up their strength? We do\r\nnot like to suggest reserves supplied by the egg as rectifying the\r\nanimal's expenditure of vital force, especially when we consider that\r\nthose reserves, themselves so close to nothing, must be economized in\r\nview of the silk, a material of the highest importance, of which a\r\nplentiful use will be made presently. There must be other powers at\r\nplay in the tiny animal's machinery.\r\n\r\nTotal abstinence from food could be understood, if it were accompanied\r\nby inertia: immobility is not life. But the young Lycosae, though\r\nusually quiet on their mother's back, are at all times ready for\r\nexercise and for agile swarming. When they fall from the maternal\r\nperambulator, they briskly pick themselves up, briskly scramble up a\r\nleg and make their way to the top. It is a splendidly nimble and\r\nspirited performance. Besides, once seated, they have to keep a firm\r\nbalance in the mass; they have to stretch and stiffen their little\r\nlimbs in order to hang on to their neighbours. As a matter of fact,\r\nthere is no absolute rest for them. Now physiology teaches us that not\r\na fibre works without some expenditure of energy. The animal, which can\r\nbe likened, in no small measure, to our industrial machines, demands,\r\non the one hand, the renovation of its organism, which wears out with\r\nmovement, and, on the other, the maintenance of the heat transformed\r\ninto action. We can compare it with the locomotive-engine. As the iron\r\nhorse performs its work, it gradually wears out its pistons, its rods,\r\nits wheels, its boiler-tubes, all of which have to be made good from\r\ntime to time. The founder and the smith repair it, supply it, so to\r\nspeak, with 'plastic food,' the food that becomes embodied with the\r\nwhole and forms part of it. But, though it have just come from the\r\nengine-shop, it is still inert. To acquire the power of movement it\r\nmust receive from the stoker a supply of 'energy-producing food'; in\r\nother words, he lights a few shovelfuls of coal in its inside. This\r\nheat will produce mechanical work.\r\n\r\nEven so with the beast. As nothing is made from nothing, the egg\r\nsupplies first the materials of the new-born animal; then the plastic\r\nfood, the smith of living creatures, increases the body, up to a\r\ncertain limit, and renews it as it wears away. The stoker works at the\r\nsame time, without stopping. Fuel, the source of energy, makes but a\r\nshort stay in the system, where it is consumed and furnishes heat,\r\nwhence movement is derived. Life is a fire-box. Warmed by its food, the\r\nanimal machine moves, walks, runs, jumps, swims, flies, sets its\r\nlocomotory apparatus going in a thousand manners.\r\n\r\nTo return to the young Lycosae, they grow no larger until the period of\r\ntheir emancipation. I find them at the age of seven months the same as\r\nwhen I saw them at their birth. The egg supplied the materials\r\nnecessary for their tiny frames; and, as the loss of waste substance\r\nis, for the moment, excessively small, or even nil, additional plastic\r\nfood is not needed so long as the wee creature does not grow. In this\r\nrespect, the prolonged abstinence presents no difficulty. But there\r\nremains the question of energy-producing food, which is indispensable,\r\nfor the little Lycosa moves, when necessary, and very actively at that.\r\nTo what shall we attribute the heat expended upon action, when the\r\nanimal takes absolutely no nourishment?\r\n\r\nAn idea suggests itself. We say to ourselves that, without being life,\r\na machine is something more than matter, for man has added a little of\r\nhis mind to it. Now the iron beast, consuming its ration of coal, is\r\nreally browsing the ancient foliage of arborescent ferns in which solar\r\nenergy has accumulated.\r\n\r\nBeasts of flesh and blood act no otherwise. Whether they mutually\r\ndevour one another or levy tribute on the plant, they invariably\r\nquicken themselves with the stimulant of the sun's heat, a heat stored\r\nin grass, fruit, seed and those which feed on such. The sun, the soul\r\nof the universe, is the supreme dispenser of energy.\r\n\r\nInstead of being served up through the intermediary of food and passing\r\nthrough the ignominious circuit of gastric chemistry, could not this\r\nsolar energy penetrate the animal directly and charge it with activity,\r\neven as the battery charges an accumulator with power? Why not live on\r\nsun, seeing that, after all, we find naught but sun in the fruits which\r\nwe consume?\r\n\r\nChemical science, that bold revolutionary, promises to provide us with\r\nsynthetic foodstuffs. The laboratory and the factory will take the\r\nplace of the farm. Why should not physical science step in as well? It\r\nwould leave the preparation of plastic food to the chemist's retorts;\r\nit would reserve for itself that of energy-producing food which,\r\nreduced to its exact terms, ceases to be matter. With the aid of some\r\ningenious apparatus, it would pump into us our daily ration of solar\r\nenergy, to be later expended in movement, whereby the machine would be\r\nkept going without the often painful assistance of the stomach and its\r\nadjuncts. What a delightful world, where one could lunch off a ray of\r\nsunshine!\r\n\r\nIs it a dream, or the anticipation of a remote reality? The problem is\r\none of the most important that science can set us. Let us first hear\r\nthe evidence of the young Lycosae regarding its possibilities.\r\n\r\nFor seven months, without any material nourishment, they expend\r\nstrength in moving. To wind up the mechanism of their muscles, they\r\nrecruit themselves direct with heat and light. During the time when she\r\nwas dragging the bag of eggs behind her, the mother, at the best\r\nmoments of the day, came and held up her pill to the sun. With her two\r\nhind-legs she lifted it out of the ground into the full light; slowly\r\nshe turned it and turned it, so that every side might receive its share\r\nof the vivifying rays. Well, this bath of life, which awakened the\r\ngerms, is now prolonged to keep the tender babes active.\r\n\r\nDaily, if the sky be clear, the Lycosa, carrying her young, comes up\r\nfrom the burrow, leans on the kerb and spends long hours basking in the\r\nsun. Here, on their mother's back, the youngsters stretch their limbs\r\ndelightedly, saturate themselves with heat, take in reserves of\r\nmotor-power, absorb energy.\r\n\r\nThey are motionless; but, if I only blow upon them, they stampede as\r\nnimbly as though a hurricane were passing. Hurriedly, they disperse;\r\nhurriedly, they reassemble: a proof that, without material nourishment,\r\nthe little animal machine is always at full pressure, ready to work.\r\nWhen the shade comes, mother and sons go down again, surfeited with\r\nsolar emanations. The feast of energy at the Sun Tavern is finished for\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. THE BANDED EPEIRA.\r\n\r\nBUILDING THE WEB.\r\n\r\nThe fowling-snare is one of man's ingenious villainies. With lines,\r\npegs and poles, two large, earth-coloured nets are stretched upon the\r\nground, one to the right, the other to the left of a bare surface. A\r\nlong cord, pulled at the right moment by the fowler, who hides in a\r\nbrushwood hut, works them and brings them together suddenly, like a\r\npair of shutters.\r\n\r\nDivided between the two nets are the cages of the decoy-birds--Linnets\r\nand Chaffinches, Greenfinches and Yellowhammers, Buntings and\r\nOrtolans--sharp-eared creatures which, on perceiving the distant\r\npassage of a flock of their own kind, forthwith utter a short calling\r\nnote. One of them, the Sambé, an irresistible tempter, hops about and\r\nflaps his wings in apparent freedom. A bit of twine fastens him to his\r\nconvict's stake. When, worn with fatigue and driven desperate by his\r\nvain attempts to get away, the sufferer lies down flat and refuses to\r\ndo his duty, the fowler is able to stimulate him without stirring from\r\nhis hut. A long string sets in motion a little lever working on a\r\npivot. Raised from the ground by this diabolical contrivance, the bird\r\nflies, falls down and flies up again at each jerk of the cord.\r\n\r\nThe fowler waits, in the mild sunlight of the autumn morning. Suddenly,\r\ngreat excitement in the cages. The Chaffinches chirp their rallying\r\ncry:\r\n\r\n\"Pinck! Pinck!\"\r\n\r\nThere is something happening in the sky. The Sambé, quick! They are\r\ncoming, the simpletons; they swoop down upon the treacherous floor.\r\nWith a rapid movement, the man in ambush pulls his string. The nets\r\nclose and the whole flock is caught.\r\n\r\nMan has wild beast's blood in his veins. The fowler hastens to the\r\nslaughter. With his thumb he stifles the beating of the captives'\r\nhearts, staves in their skulls. The little birds, so many piteous heads\r\nof game, will go to market, strung in dozens on a wire passed through\r\ntheir nostrils.\r\n\r\nFor scoundrelly ingenuity, the Epeira's net can bear comparison with\r\nthe fowler's; it even surpasses it when, on patient study, the main\r\nfeatures of its supreme perfection stand revealed. What refinement of\r\nart for a mess of Flies! Nowhere, in the whole animal kingdom, has the\r\nneed to eat inspired a more cunning industry. If the reader will\r\nmeditate upon the description that follows, he will certainly share my\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nIn bearing and colouring, Epeira fasciata is the handsomest of the\r\nSpiders of the South. On her fat belly, a mighty silk-warehouse nearly\r\nas large as a hazel-nut, are alternate yellow, black and silver sashes,\r\nto which she owes her epithet of Banded. Around that portly abdomen the\r\neight long legs, with their dark- and pale-brown rings, radiate like\r\nspokes.\r\n\r\nAny small prey suits her; and, as long as she can find supports for her\r\nweb, she settles wherever the Locust hops, wherever the Fly hovers,\r\nwherever the Dragon-fly dances or the Butterfly flits. As a rule,\r\nbecause of the greater abundance of game, she spreads her toils across\r\nsome brooklet, from bank to bank among the rushes. She also stretches\r\nthem, but not so assiduously, in the thickets of evergreen oak, on the\r\nslopes with the scrubby greenswards, dear to the Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nHer hunting-weapon is a large upright web, whose outer boundary, which\r\nvaries according to the disposition of the ground, is fastened to the\r\nneighbouring branches by a number of moorings. Let us see, first of\r\nall, how the ropes which form the framework of the building are\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nAll day invisible, crouching amid the cypress-leaves, the Spider, at\r\nabout eight o'clock in the evening, solemnly emerges from her retreat\r\nand makes for the top of a branch. In this exalted position she sits\r\nfor sometime laying her plans with due regard to the locality; she\r\nconsults the weather, ascertains if the night will be fine. Then,\r\nsuddenly, with her eight legs widespread, she lets herself drop\r\nstraight down, hanging to the line that issues from her spinnerets.\r\nJust as the rope-maker obtains the even output of his hemp by walking\r\nbackwards, so does the Epeira obtain the discharge of hers by falling.\r\nIt is extracted by the weight of her body.\r\n\r\nThe descent, however, has not the brute speed which the force of\r\ngravity would give it, if uncontrolled. It is governed by the action of\r\nthe spinnerets, which contract or expand their pores, or close them\r\nentirely, at the faller's pleasure. And so, with gentle moderation, she\r\npays out this living plumb-line, of which my lantern clearly shows me\r\nthe plumb, but not always the line. The great squab seems at such times\r\nto be sprawling in space, without the least support.\r\n\r\nShe comes to an abrupt stop two inches from the ground; the silk-reel\r\nceases working. The Spider turns round, clutches the line which she has\r\njust obtained and climbs up by this road, still spinning. But, this\r\ntime, as she is no longer assisted by the force of gravity, the thread\r\nis extracted in another manner. The two hind-legs, with a quick\r\nalternate action, draw it from the wallet and let it go.\r\n\r\nOn returning to her starting-point, at a height of six feet or more,\r\nthe Spider is now in possession of a double line, bent into a loop and\r\nfloating loosely in a current of air. She fixes her end where it suits\r\nher and waits until the other end, wafted by the wind, has fastened its\r\nloop to the adjacent twigs.\r\n\r\nFeeling her thread fixed, the Epeira runs along it repeatedly, from end\r\nto end, adding a fibre to it on each journey. Whether I help or not,\r\nthis forms the \"suspension cable,\" the main piece of the framework. I\r\ncall it a cable, in spite of its extreme thinness, because of its\r\nstructure. It looks as though it were single, but, at the two ends, it\r\nis seen to divide and spread, tuft-wise, into numerous constituent\r\nparts, which are the product of as many crossings. These diverging\r\nfibres, with their several contact-points, increase the steadiness of\r\nthe two extremities.\r\n\r\nThe suspension-cable is incomparably stronger than the rest of the work\r\nand lasts for an indefinite time. The web is generally shattered after\r\nthe night's hunting and is nearly always rewoven on the following\r\nevening. After the removal of the wreckage, it is made all over again,\r\non the same site, cleared of everything except the cable from which the\r\nnew network is to hang.\r\n\r\nOnce the cable is laid, in this way or in that, the Spider is in\r\npossession of a base that allows her to approach or withdraw from the\r\nleafy piers at will. From the height of the cable she lets herself slip\r\nto a slight depth, varying the points of her fall. In this way she\r\nobtains, to right and left, a few slanting cross-bars, connecting the\r\ncable with the branches.\r\n\r\nThese cross-bars, in their turn, support others in ever changing\r\ndirections. When there are enough of them, the Epeira need no longer\r\nresort to falls in order to extract her threads; she goes from one cord\r\nto the next, always wire-drawing with her hind-legs. This results in a\r\ncombination of straight lines owning no order, save that they are kept\r\nin one nearly perpendicular plane. Thus is marked out a very irregular\r\npolygonal area, wherein the web, itself a work of magnificent\r\nregularity, shall presently be woven.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the web, starting from the centre, a wide opaque\r\nribbon descends zigzag-wise across the radii. This is the Epeira's\r\ntrade-mark, the flourish of an artist initialling his creation. \"Fecit\r\nSo-and-so,\" she seems to say, when giving the last throw of the shuttle\r\nto her handiwork.\r\n\r\nThat the Spider feels satisfied when, after passing and repassing from\r\nspoke to spoke, she finishes her spiral, is beyond a doubt: the work\r\nachieved ensures her food for a few days to come. But, in this\r\nparticular case, the vanity of the spinstress has naught to say to the\r\nmatter: the strong silk zigzag is added to impart greater firmness to\r\nthe web.\r\n\r\nTHE LIME-SNARE.\r\n\r\nThe spiral network of the Epeirae possesses contrivances of fearsome\r\ncunning. The thread that forms it is seen with the naked eye to differ\r\nfrom that of the framework and the spokes. It glitters in the sun,\r\nlooks as though it were knotted and gives the impression of a chaplet\r\nof atoms. To examine it through the lens on the web itself is scarcely\r\nfeasible, because of the shaking of the fabric, which trembles at the\r\nleast breath. By passing a sheet of glass under the web and lifting it,\r\nI take away a few pieces of thread to study, pieces that remain fixed\r\nto the glass in parallel lines. Lens and microscope can now play their\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe sight is perfectly astounding. Those threads, on the borderland\r\nbetween the visible and the invisible, are very closely twisted twine,\r\nsimilar to the gold cord of our officers' sword-knots. Moreover, they\r\nare hollow. The infinitely slender is a tube, a channel full of a\r\nviscous moisture resembling a strong solution of gum arabic. I can see\r\na diaphanous trail of this moisture trickling through the broken ends.\r\nUnder the pressure of the thin glass slide that covers them on the\r\nstage of the microscope, the twists lengthen out, become crinkled\r\nribbons, traversed from end to end, through the middle, by a dark\r\nstreak, which is the empty container.\r\n\r\nThe fluid contents must ooze slowly through the side of those tubular\r\nthreads, rolled into twisted strings, and thus render the network\r\nsticky. It is sticky, in fact, and in such a way as to provoke\r\nsurprise. I bring a fine straw flat down upon three or four rungs of a\r\nsector. However gentle the contact, adhesion is at once established.\r\nWhen I lift the straw, the threads come with it and stretch to twice or\r\nthree times their length, like a thread of india-rubber. At last, when\r\nover-taut, they loosen without breaking and resume their original form.\r\nThey lengthen by unrolling their twist, they shorten by rolling it\r\nagain; lastly, they become adhesive by taking the glaze of the gummy\r\nmoisture wherewith they are filled.\r\n\r\nIn short, the spiral thread is a capillary tube finer than any that our\r\nphysics will ever know. It is rolled into a twist so as to possess an\r\nelasticity that allows it, without breaking, to yield to the tugs of\r\nthe captured prey; it holds a supply of sticky matter in reserve in its\r\ntube, so as to renew the adhesive properties of the surface by\r\nincessant exudation, as they become impaired by exposure to the air. It\r\nis simply marvellous.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira hunts not with springs, but with lime-snares. And such\r\nlime-snares! Everything is caught in them, down to the dandelion-plume\r\nthat barely brushes against them. Nevertheless, the Epeira, who is in\r\nconstant touch with her web, is not caught in them. Why? Because the\r\nSpider has contrived for herself, in the middle of her trap, a floor in\r\nwhose construction the sticky spiral thread plays no part. There is\r\nhere, covering a space which, in the larger webs, is about equal to the\r\npalm of one's hand, a neutral fabric in which the exploring straw finds\r\nno adhesiveness anywhere.\r\n\r\nHere, on this central resting-floor, and here only, the Epeira takes\r\nher stand, waiting whole days for the arrival of the game. However\r\nclose, however prolonged her contact with this portion of the web, she\r\nruns no risk of sticking to it, because the gummy coating is lacking,\r\nas is the twisted and tubular structure, throughout the length of the\r\nspokes and throughout the extent of the auxiliary spiral. These pieces,\r\ntogether with the rest of the framework, are made of plain, straight,\r\nsolid thread.\r\n\r\nBut when a victim is caught, sometimes right at the edge of the web,\r\nthe Spider has to rush up quickly, to bind it and overcome its attempts\r\nto free itself. She is walking then upon her network; and I do not find\r\nthat she suffers the least inconvenience. The lime-threads are not even\r\nlifted by the movements of her legs.\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood, when a troop of us would go, on Thursdays (The weekly\r\nhalf-day in French schools.--Translator's Note.), to try and catch a\r\nGoldfinch in the hemp-fields, we used, before covering the twigs with\r\nglue, to grease our fingers with a few drops of oil, lest we should get\r\nthem caught in the sticky matter. Does the Epeira know the secret of\r\nfatty substances? Let us try.\r\n\r\nI rub my exploring straw with slightly oiled paper. When applied to the\r\nspiral thread of the web, it now no longer sticks to it. The principle\r\nis discovered. I pull out the leg of a live Epeira. Brought just as it\r\nis into contact with the lime-threads, it does not stick to them any\r\nmore than to the neutral cords, whether spokes or part of the\r\nframework. We were entitled to expect this, judging by the Spider's\r\ngeneral immunity.\r\n\r\nBut here is something that wholly alters the result. I put the leg to\r\nsoak for a quarter of an hour in disulphide of carbon, the best solvent\r\nof fatty matters. I wash it carefully with a brush dipped in the same\r\nfluid. When this washing is finished, the leg sticks to the\r\nsnaring-thread quite easily and adheres to it just as well as anything\r\nelse would, the unoiled straw, for instance.\r\n\r\nDid I guess aright when I judged that it was a fatty substance that\r\npreserved the Epeira from the snares of her sticky Catherine-wheel? The\r\naction of the carbon-disulphide seems to say yes. Besides, there is no\r\nreason why a substance of this kind, which plays so frequent a part in\r\nanimal economy, should not coat the Spider very slightly by the mere\r\nact of perspiration. We used to rub our fingers with a little oil\r\nbefore handling the twigs in which the Goldfinch was to be caught; even\r\nso the Epeira varnishes herself with a special sweat, to operate on any\r\npart of her web without fear of the lime-threads.\r\n\r\nHowever, an unduly protracted stay on the sticky threads would have its\r\ndrawbacks. In the long run, continual contact with those threads might\r\nproduce a certain adhesion and inconvenience to the Spider, who must\r\npreserve all her agility in order to rush upon the prey before it can\r\nrelease itself. For this reason, gummy threads are never used in\r\nbuilding the post of interminable waiting.\r\n\r\nIt is only on her resting-floor that the Epeira sits, motionless and\r\nwith her eight legs outspread, ready to mark the least quiver in the\r\nnet. It is here, again, that she takes her meals, often long-drawn out,\r\nwhen the joint is a substantial one; it is hither that, after trussing\r\nand nibbling it, she drags her prey at the end of a thread, to consume\r\nit at her ease on a non-viscous mat. As a hunting-post and refectory,\r\nthe Epeira has contrived a central space, free from glue.\r\n\r\nAs for the glue itself, it is hardly possible to study its chemical\r\nproperties, because the quantity is so slight. The microscope shows it\r\ntrickling from the broken threads in the form of a transparent and more\r\nor less granular streak. The following experiment will tell us more\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nWith a sheet of glass passed across the web, I gather a series of\r\nlime-threads which remain fixed in parallel lines. I cover this sheet\r\nwith a bell-jar standing in a depth of water. Soon, in this atmosphere\r\nsaturated with humidity, the threads become enveloped in a watery\r\nsheath, which gradually increases and begins to flow. The twisted shape\r\nhas by this time disappeared; and the channel of the thread reveals a\r\nchaplet of translucent orbs, that is to say, a series of extremely fine\r\ndrops.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-four hours the threads have lost their contents and are\r\nreduced to almost invisible streaks. If I then lay a drop of water on\r\nthe glass, I get a sticky solution similar to that which a particle of\r\ngum arabic might yield. The conclusion is evident: the Epeira's glue is\r\na substance that absorbs moisture freely. In an atmosphere with a high\r\ndegree of humidity, it becomes saturated and percolates by sweating\r\nthrough the side of the tubular threads.\r\n\r\nThese data explain certain facts relating to the work of the net. The\r\nEpeirae weave at very early hours, long before dawn. Should the air\r\nturn misty, they sometimes leave that part of the task unfinished: they\r\nbuild the general framework, they lay the spokes, they even draw the\r\nauxiliary spiral, for all these parts are unaffected by excess of\r\nmoisture; but they are very careful not to work at the lime-threads,\r\nwhich, if soaked by the fog, would dissolve into sticky shreds and lose\r\ntheir efficacy by being wetted. The net that was started will be\r\nfinished to-morrow, if the atmosphere be favourable.\r\n\r\nWhile the highly-absorbent character of the snaring-thread has its\r\ndrawbacks, it also has compensating advantages. The Epeirae, when\r\nhunting by day, affect those hot places, exposed to the fierce rays of\r\nthe sun, wherein the Crickets delight. In the torrid heats of the\r\ndog-days, therefore, the lime-threads, but for special provisions,\r\nwould be liable to dry up, to shrivel into stiff and lifeless\r\nfilaments. But the very opposite happens. At the most scorching times\r\nof the day they continue supple, elastic and more and more adhesive.\r\n\r\nHow is this brought about? By their very powers of absorption. The\r\nmoisture of which the air is never deprived penetrates them slowly; it\r\ndilutes the thick contents of their tubes to the requisite degree and\r\ncauses it to ooze through, as and when the earlier stickiness\r\ndecreases. What bird-catcher could vie with the Garden Spider in the\r\nart of laying lime-snares? And all this industry and cunning for the\r\ncapture of a Moth!\r\n\r\nI should like an anatomist endowed with better implements than mine and\r\nwith less tired eyesight to explain to us the work of the marvellous\r\nrope-yard. How is the silken matter moulded into a capillary tube? How\r\nis this tube filled with glue and tightly twisted? And how does this\r\nsame mill also turn out plain threads, wrought first into a framework\r\nand then into muslin and satin? What a number of products to come from\r\nthat curious factory, a Spider's belly! I behold the results, but fail\r\nto understand the working of the machine. I leave the problem to the\r\nmasters of the microtome and the scalpel.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNT.\r\n\r\nThe Epeirae are monuments of patience in their lime-snare. With her\r\nhead down and her eight legs widespread, the Spider occupies the centre\r\nof the web, the receiving-point of the information sent along the\r\nspokes. If anywhere, behind or before, a vibration occur, the sign of a\r\ncapture, the Epeira knows about it, even without the aid of sight. She\r\nhastens up at once.\r\n\r\nUntil then, not a movement: one would think that the animal was\r\nhypnotized by her watching. At most, on the appearance of anything\r\nsuspicious, she begins shaking her nest. This is her way of inspiring\r\nthe intruder with awe. If I myself wish to provoke the singular alarm,\r\nI have but to tease the Epeira with a bit of straw. You cannot have a\r\nswing without an impulse of some sort. The terror-stricken Spider, who\r\nwishes to strike terror into others, has hit upon something much\r\nbetter. With nothing to push her, she swings with the floor of ropes.\r\nThere is no effort, no visible exertion. Not a single part of the\r\nanimal moves; and yet everything trembles. Violent shaking proceeds\r\nfrom apparent inertia. Rest causes commotion.\r\n\r\nWhen calm is restored, she resumes her attitude, ceaselessly pondering\r\nthe harsh problem of life:\r\n\r\n\"Shall I dine to-day, or not?\"\r\n\r\nCertain privileged beings, exempt from those anxieties, have food in\r\nabundance and need not struggle to obtain it. Such is the Gentle, who\r\nswims blissfully in the broth of the putrefying Adder. Others--and, by\r\na strange irony of fate, these are generally the most gifted--only\r\nmanage to eat by dint of craft and patience.\r\n\r\nYou are of their company, O my industrious Epeirae! So that you may\r\ndine, you spend your treasures of patience nightly; and often without\r\nresult. I sympathize with your woes, for I, who am as concerned as you\r\nabout my daily bread, I also doggedly spread my net, the net for\r\ncatching ideas, a more elusive and less substantial prize than the\r\nMoth. Let us not lose heart. The best part of life is not in the\r\npresent, still less in the past; it lies in the future, the domain of\r\nhope. Let us wait.\r\n\r\nAll day long, the sky, of a uniform grey, has appeared to be brewing a\r\nstorm. In spite of the threatened downpour, my neighbour, who is a\r\nshrewd weather-prophet, has come out of the cypress-tree and begun to\r\nrenew her web at the regular hour. Her forecast is correct: it will be\r\na fine night. See, the steaming-pan of the clouds splits open; and,\r\nthrough the apertures, the moon peeps, inquisitively. I too, lantern in\r\nhand, am peeping. A gust of wind from the north clears the realms on\r\nhigh; the sky becomes magnificent; perfect calm reigns below. The Moths\r\nbegin their nightly rounds. Good! One is caught, a mighty fine one. The\r\nSpider will dine to-day.\r\n\r\nWhat happens next, in an uncertain light, does not lend itself to\r\naccurate observation. It is better to turn to those Garden Spiders who\r\nnever leave their web and who hunt mainly in the daytime. The Banded\r\nand the Silky Epeira, both of whom live on the rosemaries in the\r\nenclosure, shall show us in broad daylight the innermost details of the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nI myself place on the lime-snare a victim of my selecting. Its six legs\r\nare caught without more ado. If the insect raises one of its tarsi and\r\npulls towards itself, the treacherous thread follows, unwinds slightly\r\nand, without letting go or breaking, yields to the captive's desperate\r\njerks. Any limb released only tangles the others still more and is\r\nspeedily recaptured by the sticky matter. There is no means of escape,\r\nexcept by smashing the trap with a sudden effort whereof even powerful\r\ninsects are not always capable.\r\n\r\nWarned by the shaking of the net, the Epeira hastens up; she turns\r\nround about the quarry; she inspects it at a distance, so as to\r\nascertain the extent of the danger before attacking. The strength of\r\nthe snareling will decide the plan of campaign. Let us first suppose\r\nthe usual case, that of an average head of game, a Moth or Fly of some\r\nsort. Facing her prisoner, the Spider contracts her abdomen slightly\r\nand touches the insect for a moment with the end of her spinnerets;\r\nthen, with her front tarsi, she sets her victim spinning. The Squirrel,\r\nin the moving cylinder of his cage, does not display a more graceful or\r\nnimbler dexterity. A cross-bar of the sticky spiral serves as an axis\r\nfor the tiny machine, which turns, turns swiftly, like a spit. It is a\r\ntreat to the eyes to see it revolve.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of this circular motion? It is this: the brief\r\ncontact of the spinnerets has given a starting-point for a thread,\r\nwhich the Spider must now draw from her silk warehouse and gradually\r\nroll around the captive, so as to swathe him in a winding-sheet which\r\nwill overpower any effort made. It is the exact process employed in our\r\nwire-mills: a motor-driven spool revolves and, by its action, draws the\r\nwire through the narrow eyelet of a steel plate, making it of the\r\nfineness required, and, with the same movement, winds it round and\r\nround its collar.\r\n\r\nEven so with the Epeira's work. The Spider's front tarsi are the motor;\r\nthe revolving spool is the captured insect; the steel eyelet is the\r\naperture of the spinnerets. To bind the subject with precision and\r\ndispatch nothing could be better than this inexpensive and highly\r\neffective method.\r\n\r\nLess frequently, a second process is employed. With a quick movement,\r\nthe Spider herself turns round about the motionless insect, crossing\r\nthe web first at the top and then at the bottom and gradually placing\r\nthe fastenings of her line. The great elasticity of the lime-threads\r\nallows the Epeira to fling herself time after time right into the web\r\nand to pass through it without damaging the net.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose the case of some dangerous game: a Praying Mantis,\r\nfor instance, brandishing her lethal limbs, each hooked and fitted with\r\na double saw; an angry Hornet, darting her awful sting; a sturdy\r\nBeetle, invincible under his horny armour. These are exceptional\r\nmorsels, hardly ever known to the Epeirae. Will they be accepted, if\r\nsupplied by my stratagems?\r\n\r\nThey are, but not without caution. The game is seen to be perilous of\r\napproach and the Spider turns her back upon it instead of facing it;\r\nshe trains her rope-cannon upon it. Quickly the hind-legs draw from the\r\nspinnerets something much better than single cords. The whole\r\nsilk-battery works at one and the same time, firing a regular volley of\r\nribbons and sheets, which a wide movement of the legs spreads fan-wise\r\nand flings over the entangled prisoner. Guarding against sudden starts,\r\nthe Epeira casts her armfuls of bands on the front- and hind-parts,\r\nover the legs and over the wings, here, there and everywhere,\r\nextravagantly. The most fiery prey is promptly mastered under this\r\navalanche. In vain the Mantis tries to open her saw-toothed arm-guards;\r\nin vain the Hornet makes play with her dagger; in vain the Beetle\r\nstiffens his legs and arches his back: a fresh wave of threads swoops\r\ndown and paralyses every effort.\r\n\r\nThe ancient retiarius, when pitted against a powerful wild beast,\r\nappeared in the arena with a rope-net folded over his left shoulder.\r\nThe animal made its spring. The man, with a sudden movement of his\r\nright arm, cast the net after the manner of the fisherman; he covered\r\nthe beast and tangled it in the meshes. A thrust of the trident gave\r\nthe quietus to the vanquished foe.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira acts in like fashion, with this advantage, that she is able\r\nto renew her armful of fetters. Should the first not suffice, a second\r\ninstantly follows and another and yet another, until the reserves of\r\nsilk become exhausted.\r\n\r\nWhen all movement ceases under the snowy winding-sheet, the Spider goes\r\nup to her bound prisoner. She has a better weapon than the bestiarius'\r\ntrident: she has her poison-fangs. She gnaws at the Locust, without\r\nundue persistence, and then withdraws, leaving the torpid patient to\r\npine away.\r\n\r\nThese lavished, far-flung ribbons threaten to exhaust the factory; it\r\nwould be much more economical to resort to the method of the spool;\r\nbut, to turn the machine, the Spider would have to go up to it and work\r\nit with her leg. This is too risky; and hence the continuous spray of\r\nsilk, at a safe distance. When all is used up, there is more to come.\r\n\r\nStill, the Epeira seems concerned at this excessive outlay. When\r\ncircumstances permit, she gladly returns to the mechanism of the\r\nrevolving spool. I saw her practice this abrupt change of tactics on a\r\nbig Beetle, with a smooth, plump body, which lent itself admirably to\r\nthe rotary process. After depriving the beast of all power of movement,\r\nshe went up to it and turned her corpulent victim as she would have\r\ndone with a medium-sized Moth.\r\n\r\nBut with the Praying Mantis, sticking out her long legs and her\r\nspreading wings, rotation is no longer feasible. Then, until the quarry\r\nis thoroughly subdued, the spray of bandages goes on continuously, even\r\nto the point of drying up the silk glands. A capture of this kind is\r\nruinous. It is true that, except when I interfered, I have never seen\r\nthe Spider tackle that formidable provender.\r\n\r\nBe it feeble or strong, the game is now neatly trussed, by one of the\r\ntwo methods. The next move never varies. The bound insect is bitten,\r\nwithout persistency and without any wound that shows. The Spider next\r\nretires and allows the bite to act, which it soon does. She then\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nIf the victim be small, a Clothes-moth, for instance, it is consumed on\r\nthe spot, at the place where it was captured. But, for a prize of some\r\nimportance, on which she hopes to feast for many an hour, sometimes for\r\nmany a day, the Spider needs a sequestered dining-room, where there is\r\nnaught to fear from the stickiness of the network. Before going to it,\r\nshe first makes her prey turn in the converse direction to that of the\r\noriginal rotation. Her object is to free the nearest spokes, which\r\nsupplied pivots for the machinery. They are essential factors which it\r\nbehoves her to keep intact, if need be by sacrificing a few cross-bars.\r\n\r\nIt is done; the twisted ends are put back into position. The\r\nwell-trussed game is at last removed from the web and fastened on\r\nbehind with a thread. The Spider then marches in front and the load is\r\ntrundled across the web and hoisted to the resting-floor, which is both\r\nan inspection-post and a dining-hall. When the Spider is of a species\r\nthat shuns the light and possesses a telegraph-line, she mounts to her\r\ndaytime hiding-place along this line, with the game bumping against her\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nWhile she is refreshing herself, let us enquire into the effects of the\r\nlittle bite previously administered to the silk-swathed captive. Does\r\nthe Spider kill the patient with a view to avoiding unseasonable jerks,\r\nprotests so disagreeable at dinner-time? Several reasons make me doubt\r\nit. In the first place, the attack is so much veiled as to have all the\r\nappearance of a mere kiss. Besides, it is made anywhere, at the first\r\nspot that offers. The expert slayers employ methods of the highest\r\nprecision: they give a stab in the neck, or under the throat; they\r\nwound the cervical nerve-centres, the seat of energy. The paralysers,\r\nthose accomplished anatomists, poison the motor nerve-centres, of which\r\nthey know the number and position. The Epeira possesses none of this\r\nfearsome knowledge. She inserts her fangs at random, as the Bee does\r\nher sting. She does not select one spot rather than another; she bites\r\nindifferently at whatever comes within reach. This being so, her poison\r\nwould have to possess unparalleled virulence to produce a corpse-like\r\ninertia no matter which the point attacked. I can scarcely believe in\r\ninstantaneous death resulting from the bite, especially in the case of\r\ninsects, with their highly-resistant organisms.\r\n\r\nBesides, is it really a corpse that the Epeira wants, she who feeds on\r\nblood much more than on flesh? It were to her advantage to suck a live\r\nbody, wherein the flow of the liquids, set in movement by the pulsation\r\nof the dorsal vessel, that rudimentary heart of insects, must act more\r\nfreely than in a lifeless body, with its stagnant fluids. The game\r\nwhich the Spider means to suck dry might very well not be dead. This is\r\neasily ascertained.\r\n\r\nI place some Locusts of different species on the webs in my menagerie,\r\none on this, another on that. The Spider comes rushing up, binds the\r\nprey, nibbles at it gently and withdraws, waiting for the bite to take\r\neffect. I then take the insect and carefully strip it of its silken\r\nshroud. The Locust is not dead; far from it; one would even think that\r\nhe had suffered no harm. I examine the released prisoner through the\r\nlens in vain; I can see no trace of a wound.\r\n\r\nCan he be unscathed, in spite of the sort of kiss which I saw given to\r\nhim just now? You would be ready to say so, judging by the furious way\r\nin which he kicks in my fingers. Nevertheless, when put on the ground,\r\nhe walks awkwardly, he seems reluctant to hop. Perhaps it is a\r\ntemporary trouble, caused by his terrible excitement in the web. It\r\nlooks as though it would soon pass.\r\n\r\nI lodge my Locusts in cages, with a lettuce-leaf to console them for\r\ntheir trials; but they will not be comforted. A day elapses, followed\r\nby a second. Not one of them touches the leaf of salad; their appetite\r\nhas disappeared. Their movements become more uncertain, as though\r\nhampered by irresistible torpor. On the second day they are dead,\r\neveryone irrecoverably dead.\r\n\r\nThe Epeira, therefore, does not incontinently kill her prey with her\r\ndelicate bite; she poisons it so as to produce a gradual weakness,\r\nwhich gives the blood-sucker ample time to drain her victim, without\r\nthe least risk, before the rigor mortis stops the flow of moisture.\r\n\r\nThe meal lasts quite twenty-four hours, if the joint be large; and to\r\nthe very end the butchered insect retains a remnant of life, a\r\nfavourable condition for the exhausting of the juices. Once again, we\r\nsee a skilful method of slaughter, very different from the tactics in\r\nuse among the expert paralysers or slayers. Here there is no display of\r\nanatomical science. Unacquainted with the patient's structure, the\r\nSpider stabs at random. The virulence of the poison does the rest.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some very few cases in which the bite is speedily\r\nmortal. My notes speak of an Angular Epeira grappling with the largest\r\nDragon-fly in my district (Aeshna grandis, Lin.) I myself had entangled\r\nin the web this head of big game, which is not often captured by the\r\nEpeirae. The net shakes violently, seems bound to break its moorings.\r\nThe Spider rushes from her leafy villa, runs boldly up to the giantess,\r\nflings a single bundle of ropes at her and, without further\r\nprecautions, grips her with her legs, tries to subdue her and then digs\r\nher fangs into the Dragon-fly's back. The bite is prolonged in such a\r\nway as to astonish me. This is not the perfunctory kiss with which I am\r\nalready familiar; it is a deep, determined wound. After striking her\r\nblow, the Spider retires to a certain distance and waits for her poison\r\nto take effect.\r\n\r\nI at once remove the Dragon-fly. She is dead, really and truly dead.\r\nLaid upon my table and left alone for twenty-four hours, she makes not\r\nthe slightest movement. A prick of which my lens cannot see the marks,\r\nso sharp-pointed are the Epeira's weapons, was enough, with a little\r\ninsistence, to kill the powerful animal. Proportionately, the\r\nRattlesnake, the Horned Viper, the Trigonocephalus and other ill-famed\r\nserpents produce less paralysing effects upon their victims.\r\n\r\nAnd these Epeirae, so terrible to insects, I am able to handle without\r\nany fear. My skin does not suit them. If I persuaded them to bite me,\r\nwhat would happen to me? Hardly anything. We have more cause to dread\r\nthe sting of a nettle than the dagger which is fatal to Dragon-flies.\r\nThe same virus acts differently upon this organism and that, is\r\nformidable here and quite mild there. What kills the insect may easily\r\nbe harmless to us. Let us not, however, generalize too far. The\r\nNarbonne Lycosa, that other enthusiastic insect-huntress, would make us\r\npay dearly if we attempted to take liberties with her.\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to watch the Epeira at dinner. I light upon\r\none, the Banded Epeira, at the moment, about three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, when she has captured a Locust. Planted in the centre of the\r\nweb, on her resting-floor, she attacks the venison at the joint of a\r\nhaunch. There is no movement, not even of the mouth-parts, so far as I\r\nam able to discover. The mouth lingers, close-applied, at the point\r\noriginally bitten. There are no intermittent mouthfuls, with the\r\nmandibles moving backwards and forwards. It is a sort of continuous\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nI visit my Epeira at intervals. The mouth does not change its place. I\r\nvisit her for the last time at nine o'clock in the evening. Matters\r\nstand exactly as they did: after six hours' consumption, the mouth is\r\nstill sucking at the lower end of the right haunch. The fluid contents\r\nof the victim are transferred to the ogress's belly, I know not how.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the Spider is still at table. I take away her dish.\r\nNaught remains of the Locust but his skin, hardly altered in shape, but\r\nutterly drained and perforated in several places. The method,\r\ntherefore, was changed during the night. To extract the non-fluent\r\nresidue, the viscera and muscles, the stiff cuticle had to be tapped\r\nhere, there and elsewhere, after which the tattered husk, placed bodily\r\nin the press of the mandibles, would have been chewed, re-chewed and\r\nfinally reduced to a pill, which the sated Spider throws up. This would\r\nhave been the end of the victim, had I not taken it away before the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhether she wound or kill, the Epeira bites her captive somewhere or\r\nother, no matter where. This is an excellent method on her part,\r\nbecause of the variety of the game that comes her way. I see her\r\naccepting with equal readiness whatever chance may send her:\r\nButterflies and Dragon-flies, Flies and Wasps, small Dung-beetles and\r\nLocusts. If I offer her a Mantis, a Bumble-bee, an Anoxia--the\r\nequivalent of the common Cockchafer--and other dishes probably unknown\r\nto her race, she accepts all and any, large and small, thin-skinned and\r\nhorny-skinned, that which goes afoot and that which takes winged\r\nflight. She is omnivorous, she preys on everything, down to her own\r\nkind, should the occasion offer.\r\n\r\nHad she to operate according to individual structure, she would need an\r\nanatomical dictionary; and instinct is essentially unfamiliar with\r\ngeneralities: its knowledge is always confined to limited points. The\r\nCerceres know their Weevils and their Buprestis-beetles absolutely; the\r\nSphex their Grasshoppers, their Crickets and their Locusts; the Scoliae\r\ntheir Cetonia- and Oryctes-grubs. (The Scolia is a Digger-wasp, like\r\nthe Cerceris and the Sphex, and feeds her larvae on the grubs of the\r\nCetonia, or Rose-chafer, and the Oryctes, or\r\nRhinoceros-beetle.--Translator's Note.) Even so the other paralysers.\r\nEach has her own victim and knows nothing of any of the others.\r\n\r\nThe same exclusive tastes prevail among the slayers. Let us remember,\r\nin this connection, Philanthus apivorus and, especially, the Thomisus,\r\nthe comely Spider who cuts Bees' throats. They understand the fatal\r\nblow, either in the neck or under the chin, a thing which the Epeira\r\ndoes not understand; but, just because of this talent, they are\r\nspecialists. Their province is the Domestic Bee.\r\n\r\nAnimals are a little like ourselves: they excel in an art only on\r\ncondition of specializing in it. The Epeira, who, being omnivorous, is\r\nobliged to generalize, abandons scientific methods and makes up for\r\nthis by distilling a poison capable of producing torpor and even death,\r\nno matter what the point attacked.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the large variety of game, we wonder how the Epeira manages\r\nnot to hesitate amid those many diverse forms, how, for instance, she\r\npasses from the Locust to the Butterfly, so different in appearance. To\r\nattribute to her as a guide an extensive zoological knowledge were\r\nwildly in excess of what we may reasonably expect of her poor\r\nintelligence. The thing moves, therefore it is worth catching: this\r\nformula seems to sum up the Spider's wisdom.\r\n\r\nTHE TELEGRAPH-WIRE.\r\n\r\nOf the six Garden Spiders that form the object of my observations, two\r\nonly, the Banded and the Silky Epeira, remain constantly in their webs,\r\neven under the blinding rays of a fierce sun. The others, as a rule, do\r\nnot show themselves until nightfall. At some distance from the net they\r\nhave a rough-and-ready retreat in the brambles, an ambush made of a few\r\nleaves held together by stretched threads. It is here that, for the\r\nmost part, they remain in the daytime, motionless and sunk in\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nBut the shrill light that vexes them is the joy of the fields. At such\r\ntimes the Locust hops more nimbly than ever, more gaily skims the\r\nDragon-fly. Besides, the limy web, despite the rents suffered during\r\nthe night, is still in serviceable condition. If some giddy-pate allow\r\nhimself to be caught, will the Spider, at the distance whereto she has\r\nretired, be unable to take advantage of the windfall? Never fear. She\r\narrives in a flash. How is she apprised? Let us explain the matter.\r\n\r\nThe alarm is given by the vibration of the web, much more than by the\r\nsight of the captured object. A very simple experiment will prove this.\r\nI lay upon a Banded Epeira's lime-threads a Locust that second\r\nasphyxiated with carbon disulphide. The carcass is placed in front, or\r\nbehind, or at either side of the Spider, who sits moveless in the\r\ncentre of the net. If the test is to be applied to a species with a\r\ndaytime hiding-place amid the foliage, the dead Locust is laid on the\r\nweb, more or less near the centre, no matter how.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, nothing happens at first. The Epeira remains in her\r\nmotionless attitude, even when the morsel is at a short distance in\r\nfront of her. She is indifferent to the presence of the game, does not\r\nseem to perceive it, so much so that she ends by wearing out my\r\npatience. Then, with a long straw, which enables me to conceal myself\r\nslightly, I set the dead insect trembling.\r\n\r\nThat is quite enough. The Banded Epeira and the Silky Epeira hasten to\r\nthe central floor; the others come down from the branch; all go to the\r\nLocust, swathe him with tape, treat him, in short, as they would treat\r\na live prey captured under normal conditions. It took the shaking of\r\nthe web to decide them to attack.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the grey colour of the Locust is not sufficiently conspicuous\r\nto attract attention by itself. Then let us try red, the brightest\r\ncolour to our retina and probably also to the Spiders'. None of the\r\ngame hunted by the Epeirae being clad in scarlet, I make a small bundle\r\nout of red wool, a bait of the size of a Locust. I glue it to the web.\r\n\r\nMy stratagem succeeds. As long as the parcel is stationary, the Spider\r\nis not roused; but, the moment it trembles, stirred by my straw, she\r\nruns up eagerly.\r\n\r\nThere are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and,\r\nwithout further enquiries, swathe it in silk after the manner of the\r\nusual game. They even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait,\r\nfollowing the rule of the preliminary poisoning. Then and then only the\r\nmistake is recognized and the tricked Spider retires and does not come\r\nback, unless it be long afterwards, when she flings the lumbersome\r\nobject out of the web.\r\n\r\nThere are also clever ones. Like the others, these hasten to the\r\nred-woollen lure, which my straw insidiously keeps moving; they come\r\nfrom their tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the\r\nweb; they explore it with their palpi and their legs; but, soon\r\nperceiving that the thing is valueless, they are careful not to spend\r\ntheir silk on useless bonds. My quivering bait does not deceive them.\r\nIt is flung out after a brief inspection.\r\n\r\nStill, the clever ones, like the silly ones, run even from a distance,\r\nfrom their leafy ambush. How do they know? Certainly not by sight.\r\nBefore recognizing their mistake, they have to hold the object between\r\ntheir legs and even to nibble at it a little. They are extremely\r\nshort-sighted. At a hand's-breadth's distance, the lifeless prey,\r\nunable to shake the web, remains unperceived. Besides, in many cases,\r\nthe hunting takes place in the dense darkness of the night, when sight,\r\neven if it were good, would not avail.\r\n\r\nIf the eyes are insufficient guides, even close at hand, how will it be\r\nwhen the prey has to be spied from afar? In that case, an intelligence\r\napparatus for long-distance work becomes indispensable. We have no\r\ndifficulty in detecting the apparatus.\r\n\r\nLet us look attentively behind the web of any Epeira with a daytime\r\nhiding-place: we shall see a thread that starts from the centre of the\r\nnetwork, ascends in a slanting line outside the plane of the web and\r\nends at the ambush where the Spider lurks all day. Except at the\r\ncentral point, there is no connection between this thread and the rest\r\nof the work, no interweaving with the scaffolding-threads. Free of\r\nimpediment, the line runs straight from the centre of the net to the\r\nambush-tent. Its length averages twenty-two inches. The Angular Epeira,\r\nsettled high up in the trees, has shown me some as long as eight or\r\nnine feet.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this slanting line is a foot-bridge which allows\r\nthe Spider to repair hurriedly to the web, when summoned by urgent\r\nbusiness, and then, when her round is finished, to return to her hut.\r\nIn fact, it is the road which I see her follow, in going and coming.\r\nBut is that all? No; for, if the Epeira had no aim in view but a means\r\nof rapid transit between her tent and the net, the foot-bridge would be\r\nfastened to the upper edge of the web. The journey would be shorter and\r\nthe slope less steep.\r\n\r\nWhy, moreover, does this line always start in the centre of the sticky\r\nnetwork and nowhere else? Because that is the point where the spokes\r\nmeet and, therefore, the common centre of vibration. Anything that\r\nmoves upon the web sets it shaking. All then that is needed is a thread\r\nissuing from this central point to convey to a distance the news of a\r\nprey struggling in some part or other of the net. The slanting cord,\r\nextending outside the plane of the web, is more than a foot-bridge: it\r\nis, above all, a signalling-apparatus, a telegraph-wire.\r\n\r\nLet us try experiment. I place a Locust on the network. Caught in the\r\nsticky toils, he plunges about. Forthwith, the Spider issues\r\nimpetuously from her hut, comes down the foot-bridge, makes a rush for\r\nthe Locust, wraps him up and operates on him according to rule. Soon\r\nafter, she hoists him, fastened by a line to her spinneret, and drags\r\nhim to her hiding-place, where a long banquet will be held. So far,\r\nnothing new: things happen as usual.\r\n\r\nI leave the Spider to mind her own affairs for some days before I\r\ninterfere with her. I again propose to give her a Locust; but this time\r\nI first cut the signalling-thread with a touch of the scissors, without\r\nshaking any part of the edifice. The game is then laid on the web.\r\nComplete success: the entangled insect struggles, sets the net\r\nquivering; the Spider, on her side, does not stir, as though heedless\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nThe idea might occur to one that, in this business, the Epeira stays\r\nmotionless in her cabin since she is prevented from hurrying down,\r\nbecause the foot-bridge is broken. Let us undeceive ourselves: for one\r\nroad open to her there are a hundred, all ready to bring her to the\r\nplace where her presence is now required. The network is fastened to\r\nthe branches by a host of lines, all of them very easy to cross. Well,\r\nthe Epeira embarks upon none of them, but remains moveless and\r\nself-absorbed.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because her telegraph, being out of order, no longer tells her of\r\nthe shaking of the web. The captured prey is too far off for her to see\r\nit; she is all unwitting. A good hour passes, with the Locust still\r\nkicking, the Spider impassive, myself watching. Nevertheless, in the\r\nend, the Epeira wakes up: no longer feeling the signalling-thread,\r\nbroken by my scissors, as taut as usual under her legs, she comes to\r\nlook into the state of things. The web is reached, without the least\r\ndifficulty, by one of the lines of the framework, the first that\r\noffers. The Locust is then perceived and forthwith enswathed, after\r\nwhich the signalling-thread is remade, taking the place of the one\r\nwhich I have broken. Along this road the Spider goes home, dragging her\r\nprey behind her.\r\n\r\nMy neighbour, the mighty Angular Epeira, with her telegraph-wire nine\r\nfeet long, has even better things in store for me. One morning I find\r\nher web, which is now deserted, almost intact, a proof that the night's\r\nhunting has not been good. The animal must be hungry. With a piece of\r\ngame for a bait, I hope to bring her down from her lofty retreat.\r\n\r\nI entangle in the web a rare morsel, a Dragon-fly, who struggles\r\ndesperately and sets the whole net a-shaking. The other, up above,\r\nleaves her lurking-place amid the cypress-foliage, strides swiftly down\r\nalong her telegraph-wire, comes to the Dragon-fly, trusses her and at\r\nonce climbs home again by the same road, with her prize dangling at her\r\nheels by a thread. The final sacrifice will take place in the quiet of\r\nthe leafy sanctuary.\r\n\r\nA few days later I renew my experiment under the same conditions, but,\r\nthis time, I first cut the signalling-thread. In vain I select a large\r\nDragon-fly, a very restless prisoner; in vain I exert my patience: the\r\nSpider does not come down all day. Her telegraph being broken, she\r\nreceives no notice of what is happening nine feet below. The entangled\r\nmorsel remains where it lies, not despised, but unknown. At nightfall\r\nthe Epeira leaves her cabin, passes over the ruins of her web, finds\r\nthe Dragon-fly and eats him on the spot, after which the net is\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nThe Epeirae, who occupy a distant retreat by day, cannot do without a\r\nprivate wire that keeps them in permanent communication with the\r\ndeserted web. All of them have one, in point of fact, but only when age\r\ncomes, age prone to rest and to long slumbers. In their youth, the\r\nEpeirae, who are then very wide awake, know nothing of the art of\r\ntelegraphy. Besides, their web, a short-lived work whereof hardly a\r\ntrace remains on the morrow, does not allow of this kind of industry.\r\nIt is no use going to the expense of a signalling-apparatus for a\r\nruined snare wherein nothing can now be caught. Only the old Spiders,\r\nmeditating or dozing in their green tent, are warned from afar, by\r\ntelegraph, of what takes place on the web.\r\n\r\nTo save herself from keeping a close watch that would degenerate into\r\ndrudgery and to remain alive to events even when resting, with her back\r\nturned on the net, the ambushed Spider always has her foot upon the\r\ntelegraph-wire. Of my observations on this subject, let me relate the\r\nfollowing, which will be sufficient for our purpose.\r\n\r\nAn Angular Epeira, with a remarkably fine belly, has spun her web\r\nbetween two laurustine-shrubs, covering a width of nearly a yard. The\r\nsun beats upon the snare, which is abandoned long before dawn. The\r\nSpider is in her day manor, a resort easily discovered by following the\r\ntelegraph-wire. It is a vaulted chamber of dead leaves, joined together\r\nwith a few bits of silk. The refuge is deep: the Spider disappears in\r\nit entirely, all but her rounded hind-quarters, which bar the entrance\r\nto her donjon.\r\n\r\nWith her front half plunged into the back of her hut, the Epeira\r\ncertainly cannot see her web. Even if she had good sight, instead of\r\nbeing purblind, her position could not possibly allow her to keep the\r\nprey in view. Does she give up hunting during this period of bright\r\nsunlight? Not at all. Look again.\r\n\r\nWonderful! One of her hind-legs is stretched outside the leafy cabin;\r\nand the signalling-thread ends just at the tip of that leg. Whoso has\r\nnot seen the Epeira in this attitude, with her hand, so to speak, on\r\nthe telegraph-receiver, knows nothing of one of the most curious\r\ninstances of animal cleverness. Let any game appear upon the scene; and\r\nthe slumberer, forthwith aroused by means of the leg receiving the\r\nvibrations, hastens up. A Locust whom I myself lay on the web procures\r\nher this agreeable shock and what follows. If she is satisfied with her\r\nbag, I am still more satisfied with what I have learnt.\r\n\r\nOne word more. The web is often shaken by the wind. The different parts\r\nof the framework, tossed and teased by the eddying air-currents, cannot\r\nfail to transmit their vibration to the signalling-thread.\r\nNevertheless, the Spider does not quit her hut and remains indifferent\r\nto the commotion prevailing in the net. Her line, therefore, is\r\nsomething better than a bell-rope that pulls and communicates the\r\nimpulse given: it is a telephone capable, like our own, of transmitting\r\ninfinitesimal waves of sound. Clutching her telephone-wire with a toe,\r\nthe Spider listens with her leg; she perceives the innermost\r\nvibrations; she distinguishes between the vibration proceeding from a\r\nprisoner and the mere shaking caused by the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. THE EUMENES.\r\n\r\nA wasp-like garb of motley black and yellow; a slender and graceful\r\nfigure; wings not spread out flat, when resting, but folded lengthwise\r\nin two; the abdomen a sort of chemist's retort, which swells into a\r\ngourd and is fastened to the thorax by a long neck, first distending\r\ninto a pear, then shrinking to a thread; a leisurely and silent flight;\r\nlonely habits. There we have a summary sketch of the Eumenes. My part\r\nof the country possesses two species: the larger, Eumenes Amedei, Lep.,\r\nmeasures nearly an inch in length; the other, Eumenes pomiformis,\r\nFabr., is a reduction of the first to the scale of one-half. (I include\r\nthree species promiscuously under this one name, that is to say,\r\nEumenes pomiformis, Fabr., E. bipunctis, Sauss., and E. dubius, Sauss.\r\nAs I did not distinguish between them in my first investigations, which\r\ndate a very long time back, it is not possible for me to ascribe to\r\neach of them its respective nest. But their habits are the same, for\r\nwhich reason this confusion does not injuriously affect the order of\r\nideas in the present chapter.--Author's Note.)\r\n\r\nSimilar in form and colouring, both possess a like talent for\r\narchitecture; and this talent is expressed in a work of the highest\r\nperfection which charms the most untutored eye. Their dwelling is a\r\nmasterpiece. The Eumenes follow the profession of arms, which is\r\nunfavourable to artistic effort; they stab a prey with their sting;\r\nthey pillage and plunder. They are predatory Hymenoptera, victualling\r\ntheir grubs with caterpillars. It will be interesting to compare their\r\nhabits with those of the operator on the Grey Worm. (Ammophila hirsuta,\r\nwho hunts the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of Noctua segetum, the Dart or\r\nTurnip Moth.--Translator's Note.) Though the quarry--caterpillars in\r\neither case--remain the same, perhaps instinct, which is liable to vary\r\nwith the species, has fresh glimpses in store for us. Besides, the\r\nedifice built by the Eumenes in itself deserves inspection.\r\n\r\nThe Hunting Wasps whose story we have described in former volumes are\r\nwonderfully well versed in the art of wielding the lancet; they astound\r\nus with their surgical methods, which they seem to have learnt from\r\nsome physiologist who allows nothing to escape him; but those skilful\r\nslayers have no merit as builders of dwelling-houses. What is their\r\nhome, in point of fact? An underground passage, with a cell at the end\r\nof it; a gallery, an excavation, a shapeless cave. It is miner's work,\r\nnavvy's work: vigorous sometimes, artistic never. They use the pick-axe\r\nfor loosening, the crowbar for shifting, the rake for extracting the\r\nmaterials, but never the trowel for laying. Now in the Eumenes we see\r\nreal masons, who build their houses bit by bit with stone and mortar\r\nand run them up in the open, either on the firm rock or on the shaky\r\nsupport of a bough. Hunting alternates with architecture; the insect is\r\na Nimrod or a Vitruvius by turns. (Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman\r\narchitect and engineer.--Translator's Note.)\r\n\r\nAnd, first of all, what sites do these builders select for their homes?\r\nShould you pass some little garden-wall, facing south, in a\r\nsun-scorched corner, look at the stones that are not covered with\r\nplaster, look at them one by one, especially the largest; examine the\r\nmasses of boulders, at no great height from the ground, where the\r\nfierce rays have heated them to the temperature of a Turkish bath; and,\r\nperhaps, if you seek long enough, you will light upon the structure of\r\nEumenes Amedei. The insect is scarce and lives apart; a meeting is an\r\nevent upon which we must not count with too great confidence. It is an\r\nAfrican species and loves the heat that ripens the carob and the date.\r\nIt haunts the sunniest spots and selects rocks or firm stones as a\r\nfoundation for its nest. Sometimes also, but seldom, it copies the\r\nChalicodoma of the Walls and builds upon an ordinary pebble. (Or\r\nMason-bee.--Translator's Note.)\r\n\r\nEumenes pomiformis is much more common and is comparatively indifferent\r\nto the nature of the foundation whereon she erects her cells. She\r\nbuilds on walls, on isolated stones, on the wood of the inner surface\r\nof half-closed shutters; or else she adopts an aerial base, the slender\r\ntwig of a shrub, the withered sprig of a plant of some sort. Any form\r\nof support serves her purpose. Nor does she trouble about shelter. Less\r\nchilly than her African cousin, she does not shun the unprotected\r\nspaces exposed to every wind that blows.\r\n\r\nWhen erected on a horizontal surface, where nothing interferes with it,\r\nthe structure of Eumenes Amedei is a symmetrical cupola, a spherical\r\nskull-cap, with, at the top, a narrow passage just wide enough for the\r\ninsect, and surmounted by a neatly funnelled neck. It suggests the\r\nround hut of the Eskimo or of the ancient Gael, with its central\r\nchimney. Two centimetres and a half (.97 inch.--Translator's Note.),\r\nmore or less, represent the diameter, and two centimetres the height.\r\n(.78 inch.--Translator's Note.) When the support is a perpendicular\r\nplane, the building still retains the domed shape, but the entrance-\r\nand exit-funnel opens at the side, upwards. The floor of this apartment\r\ncalls for no labour: it is supplied direct by the bare stone.\r\n\r\nHaving chosen the site, the builder erects a circular fence about three\r\nmillimetres thick. (.118 inch.--Translator's Note.) The materials\r\nconsist of mortar and small stones. The insect selects its stone-quarry\r\nin some well-trodden path, on some neighbouring road, at the driest,\r\nhardest spots. With its mandibles, it scrapes together a small quantity\r\nof dust and saturates it with saliva until the whole becomes a regular\r\nhydraulic mortar which soon sets and is no longer susceptible to water.\r\nThe Mason-bees have shown us a similar exploitation of the beaten paths\r\nand of the road-mender's macadam. All these open-air builders, all\r\nthese erectors of monuments exposed to wind and weather require an\r\nexceedingly dry stone-dust; otherwise the material, already moistened\r\nwith water, would not properly absorb the liquid that is to give it\r\ncohesion; and the edifice would soon be wrecked by the rains. They\r\npossess the sense of discrimination of the plasterer, who rejects\r\nplaster injured by damp. We shall see presently how the insects that\r\nbuild under shelter avoid this laborious macadam-scraping and give the\r\npreference to fresh earth already reduced to a paste by its own\r\ndampness. When common lime answers our purpose, we do not trouble about\r\nRoman cement. Now Eumenes Amedei requires a first-class cement, even\r\nbetter than that of the Chalicodoma of the Walls, for the work, when\r\nfinished, does not receive the thick covering wherewith the Mason-bee\r\nprotects her cluster of cells. And therefore the cupola-builder, as\r\noften as she can, uses the highway as her stone-pit.\r\n\r\nWith the mortar, flints are needed. These are bits of gravel of an\r\nalmost unvarying size--that of a peppercorn--but of a shape and kind\r\ndiffering greatly, according to the places worked. Some are\r\nsharp-cornered, with facets determined by chance fractures; some are\r\nround, polished by friction under water. Some are of limestone, others\r\nof silicic matter. The favourite stones, when the neighbourhood of the\r\nnest permits, are little nodules of quartz, smooth and semitransparent.\r\nThese are selected with minute care. The insect weighs them, so to say,\r\nmeasures them with the compass of its mandibles and does not accept\r\nthem until after recognizing in them the requisite qualities of size\r\nand hardness.\r\n\r\nA circular fence, we were saying, is begun on the bare rock. Before the\r\nmortar sets, which does not take long, the mason sticks a few stones\r\ninto the soft mass, as the work advances. She dabs them half-way into\r\nthe cement, so as to leave them jutting out to a large extent, without\r\npenetrating to the inside, where the wall must remain smooth for the\r\nsake of the larva's comfort. If necessary, a little plaster is added,\r\nto tone down the inner protuberances. The solidly embedded stonework\r\nalternates with the pure mortarwork, of which each fresh course\r\nreceives its facing of tiny encrusted pebbles. As the edifice is\r\nraised, the builder slopes the construction a little towards the centre\r\nand fashions the curve which will give the spherical shape. We employ\r\narched centrings to support the masonry of a dome while building: the\r\nEumenes, more daring than we, erects her cupola without any\r\nscaffolding.\r\n\r\nA round orifice is contrived at the summit; and, on this orifice, rises\r\na funnelled mouthpiece built of pure cement. It might be the graceful\r\nneck of some Etruscan vase. When the cell is victualled and the egg\r\nlaid, this mouthpiece is closed with a cement plug; and in this plug is\r\nset a little pebble, one alone, no more: the ritual never varies. This\r\nwork of rustic architecture has naught to fear from the inclemency of\r\nthe weather; it does not yield to the pressure of the fingers; it\r\nresists the knife that attempts to remove it without breaking it. Its\r\nnipple shape and the bits of gravel wherewith it bristles all over the\r\noutside remind one of certain cromlechs of olden time, of certain\r\ntumuli whose domes are strewn with Cyclopean stones.\r\n\r\nSuch is the appearance of the edifice when the cell stands alone; but\r\nthe Hymenopteron nearly always fixes other domes against her first, to\r\nthe number of five, six, or more. This shortens the labour by allowing\r\nher to use the same partition for two adjoining rooms. The original\r\nelegant symmetry is lost and the whole now forms a cluster which, at\r\nfirst sight, appears to be merely a clod of dry mud, sprinkled with\r\ntiny pebbles. But let us examine the shapeless mass more closely and we\r\nshall perceive the number of chambers composing the habitation with the\r\nfunnelled mouths, each quite distinct and each furnished with its\r\ngravel stopper set in the cement.\r\n\r\nThe Chalicodoma of the Walls employs the same building methods as\r\nEumenes Amedei: in the courses of cement she fixes, on the outside,\r\nsmall stones of minor bulk. Her work begins by being a turret of rustic\r\nart, not without a certain prettiness; then, when the cells are placed\r\nside by side, the whole construction degenerates into a lump governed\r\napparently by no architectural rule. Moreover, the Mason-bee covers her\r\nmass of cells with a thick layer of cement, which conceals the original\r\nrockwork edifice. The Eumenes does not resort to this general coating:\r\nher building is too strong to need it; she leaves the pebbly facings\r\nuncovered, as well as the entrances to the cells. The two sorts of\r\nnests, although constructed of similar materials, are therefore easily\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe Eumenes' cupola is the work of an artist; and the artist would be\r\nsorry to cover his masterpiece with whitewash. I crave forgiveness for\r\na suggestion which I advance with all the reserve befitting so delicate\r\na subject. Would it not be possible for the cromlech-builder to take a\r\npride in her work, to look upon it with some affection and to feel\r\ngratified by this evidence of her cleverness? Might there not be an\r\ninsect science of aesthetics? I seem at least to catch a glimpse, in\r\nthe Eumenes, of a propensity to beautify her work. The nest must be,\r\nbefore all, a solid habitation, an inviolable stronghold; but, should\r\nornament intervene without jeopardizing the power of resistance, will\r\nthe worker remain indifferent to it? Who would say?\r\n\r\nLet us set forth the facts. The orifice at the top, if left as a mere\r\nhole, would suit the purpose quite as well as an elaborate door: the\r\ninsect would lose nothing in regard to facilities for coming and going\r\nand would gain by shortening the labour. Yet we find, on the contrary,\r\nthe mouth of an amphora, gracefully curved, worthy of a potter's wheel.\r\nA choice cement and careful work are necessary for the confection of\r\nits slender, funnelled shaft. Why this nice finish, if the builder be\r\nwholly absorbed in the solidity of her work?\r\n\r\nHere is another detail: among the bits of gravel employed for the outer\r\ncovering of the cupola, grains of quartz predominate. They are polished\r\nand translucent; they glitter slightly and please the eye. Why are\r\nthese little pebbles preferred to chips of lime-stone, when both\r\nmaterials are found in equal abundance around the nest?\r\n\r\nA yet more remarkable feature: we find pretty often, encrusted on the\r\ndome, a few tiny, empty snail-shells, bleached by the sun. The species\r\nusually selected by the Eumenes is one of the smaller Helices--Helix\r\nstrigata--frequent on our parched slopes. I have seen nests where this\r\nHelix took the place of pebbles almost entirely. They were like boxes\r\nmade of shells, the work of a patient hand.\r\n\r\nA comparison offers here. Certain Australian birds, notably the\r\nBower-birds, build themselves covered walks, or playhouses, with\r\ninterwoven twigs, and decorate the two entrances to the portico by\r\nstrewing the threshold with anything that they can find in the shape of\r\nglittering, polished, or bright-coloured objects. Every door-sill is a\r\ncabinet of curiosities where the collector gathers smooth pebbles,\r\nvariegated shells, empty snail-shells, parrot's feathers, bones that\r\nhave come to look like sticks of ivory. The odds and ends mislaid by\r\nman find a home in the bird's museum, where we see pipe-stems, metal\r\nbuttons, strips of cotton stuff and stone axe-heads.\r\n\r\nThe collection at either entrance to the bower is large enough to fill\r\nhalf a bushel. As these objects are of no use to the bird, its only\r\nmotive for accumulating them must be an art-lover's hobby. Our common\r\nMagpie has similar tastes: any shiny thing that he comes upon he picks\r\nup, hides and hoards.\r\n\r\nWell, the Eumenes, who shares this passion for bright pebbles and empty\r\nsnail-shells, is the Bower-bird of the insect world; but she is a more\r\npractical collector, knows how to combine the useful and the ornamental\r\nand employs her finds in the construction of her nest, which is both a\r\nfortress and a museum. When she finds nodules of translucent quartz,\r\nshe rejects everything else: the building will be all the prettier for\r\nthem. When she comes across a little white shell, she hastens to\r\nbeautify her dome with it; should fortune smile and empty snail-shells\r\nabound, she encrusts the whole fabric with them, until it becomes the\r\nsupreme expression of her artistic taste. Is this so? Or is it not so?\r\nWho shall decide?\r\n\r\nThe nest of Eumenes pomiformis is the size of an average cherry and\r\nconstructed of pure mortar, without the least outward pebblework. Its\r\nshape is exactly similar to that which we have just described. When\r\nbuilt upon a horizontal base of sufficient extent, it is a dome with a\r\ncentral neck, funnelled like the mouth of an urn. But when the\r\nfoundation is reduced to a mere point, as on the twig of a shrub, the\r\nnest becomes a spherical capsule, always, of course, surmounted by a\r\nneck. It is then a miniature specimen of exotic pottery, a paunchy\r\nalcarraza. Its thickens is very slight, less than that of a sheet of\r\npaper; it crushes under the least effort of the fingers. The outside is\r\nnot quite even. It displays wrinkles and seams, due to the different\r\ncourses of mortar, or else knotty protuberances distributed almost\r\nconcentrically.\r\n\r\nBoth Hymenoptera accumulate caterpillars in their coffers, whether\r\ndomes or jars. Let us give an abstract of the bill of fare. These\r\ndocuments, for all their dryness, possess a value; they will enable\r\nwhoso cares to interest himself in the Eumenes to perceive to what\r\nextent instinct varies the diet, according to the place and season. The\r\nfood is plentiful, but lacks variety. It consists of tiny caterpillars,\r\nby which I mean the grubs of small Butterflies. We learn this from the\r\nstructure, for we observe in the prey selected by either Hymenopteran\r\nthe usual caterpillar organism. The body is composed of twelve\r\nsegments, not including the head. The first three have true legs, the\r\nnext two are legless, then come two segments with prolegs, two legless\r\nsegments and, lastly, a terminal segment with prolegs. It is exactly\r\nthe same structure which we saw in the Ammophila's Grey Worm.\r\n\r\nMy old notes give the following description of the caterpillars found\r\nin the nest of Eumenes Amedei: \"a pale green or, less often, a\r\nyellowish body, covered with short white hairs; head wider than the\r\nfront segment, dead-black and also bristling with hairs. Length: 16 to\r\n18 millimetres (.63 to .7 inch.--Translator's Note.); width: about 3\r\nmillimetres.\" (.12 inch.--Translator's Note.) A quarter of a century\r\nand more has elapsed since I jotted down this descriptive sketch; and\r\nto-day, at Sérignan, I find in the Eumenes' larder the same game which\r\nI noticed long ago at Carpentras. Time and distance have not altered\r\nthe nature of the provisions.\r\n\r\nThe number of morsels served for the meal of each larva interests us\r\nmore than the quality. In the cells of Eumenes Amedei, I find sometimes\r\nfive caterpillars and sometimes ten, which means a difference of a\r\nhundred per cent in the quantity of the food, for the morsels are of\r\nexactly the same size in both cases. Why this unequal supply, which\r\ngives a double portion to one larva and a single portion to another?\r\nThe diners have the same appetite: what one nurseling demands a second\r\nmust demand, unless we have here a different menu, according to the\r\nsexes. In the perfect stage the males are smaller than the females, are\r\nhardly half as much in weight or volume. The amount of victuals,\r\ntherefore, required to bring them to their final development may be\r\nreduced by one-half. In that case, the well-stocked cells belong to\r\nfemales; the others, more meagrely supplied, belong to males.\r\n\r\nBut the egg is laid when the provisions are stored; and this egg has a\r\ndetermined sex, though the most minute examination is not able to\r\ndiscover the differences which will decide the hatching of a female or\r\na male. We are therefore needs driven to this strange conclusion: the\r\nmother knows beforehand the sex of the egg which she is about to lay;\r\nand this knowledge allows her to fill the larder according to the\r\nappetite of the future grub. What a strange world, so wholly different\r\nfrom ours! We fall back upon a special sense to explain the Ammophila's\r\nhunting; what can we fall back upon to account for this intuition of\r\nthe future? Can the theory of chances play a part in the hazy problem?\r\nIf nothing is logically arranged with a foreseen object, how is this\r\nclear vision of the invisible acquired?\r\n\r\nThe capsules of Eumenes pomiformis are literally crammed with game. It\r\nis true that the morsels are very small. My notes speak of fourteen\r\ngreen caterpillars in one cell and sixteen in a second cell. I have no\r\nother information about the integral diet of this Wasp, whom I have\r\nneglected somewhat, preferring to study her cousin, the builder of\r\nrockwork domes. As the two sexes differ in size, although to a lesser\r\ndegree than in the case of Eumenes Amedei, I am inclined to think that\r\nthose two well-filled cells belonged to females and that the males'\r\ncells must have a less sumptuous table. Not having seen for myself, I\r\nam content to set down this mere suspicion.\r\n\r\nWhat I have seen and often seen is the pebbly nest, with the larva\r\ninside and the provisions partly consumed. To continue the rearing at\r\nhome and follow my charge's progress from day to day was a business\r\nwhich I could not resist; besides, as far as I was able to see, it was\r\neasily managed. I had had some practice in this foster-father's trade;\r\nmy association with the Bembex, the Ammophila, the Sphex (three species\r\nof Digger-wasps.--Translator's Note.) and many others had turned me\r\ninto a passable insect-rearer. I was no novice in the art of dividing\r\nan old pen-box into compartments in which I laid a bed of sand and, on\r\nthis bed, the larva and her provisions delicately removed from the\r\nmaternal cell. Success was almost certain at each attempt: I used to\r\nwatch the larvae at their meals, I saw my nurselings grow up and spin\r\ntheir cocoons. Relying upon the experience thus gained, I reckoned upon\r\nsuccess in raising my Eumenes.\r\n\r\nThe results, however, in no way answered to my expectations. All my\r\nendeavours failed; and the larva allowed itself to die a piteous death\r\nwithout touching its provisions.\r\n\r\nI ascribed my reverse to this, that and the other cause: perhaps I had\r\ninjured the frail grub when demolishing the fortress; a splinter of\r\nmasonry had bruised it when I forced open the hard dome with my knife;\r\na too sudden exposure to the sun had surprised it when I withdrew it\r\nfrom the darkness of its cell; the open air might have dried up its\r\nmoisture. I did the best I could to remedy all these probable reasons\r\nof failure. I went to work with every possible caution in breaking open\r\nthe home; I cast the shadow of my body over the nest, to save the grub\r\nfrom sunstroke; I at once transferred larva and provisions into a glass\r\ntube and placed this tube in a box which I carried in my hand, to\r\nminimize the jolting on the journey. Nothing was of avail: the larva,\r\nwhen taken from its dwelling, always allowed itself to pine away.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I persisted in explaining my want of success by the\r\ndifficulties attending the removal. Eumenes Amedei's cell is a strong\r\ncasket which cannot be forced without sustaining a shock; and the\r\ndemolition of a work of this kind entails such varied accidents that we\r\nare always liable to think that the worm has been bruised by the\r\nwreckage. As for carrying home the nest intact on its support, with a\r\nview to opening it with greater care than is permitted by a\r\nrough-and-ready operation in the fields, that is out of the question:\r\nthe nest nearly always stands on an immovable rock or on some big stone\r\nforming part of a wall. If I failed in my attempts at rearing, it was\r\nbecause the larva had suffered when I was breaking up her house. The\r\nreason seemed a good one; and I let it go at that.\r\n\r\nIn the end, another idea occurred to me and made me doubt whether my\r\nrebuffs were always due to clumsy accidents. The Eumenes' cells are\r\ncrammed with game: there are ten caterpillars in the cell of Eumenes\r\nAmedei and fifteen in that of Eumenes pomiformis. These caterpillars,\r\nstabbed no doubt, but in a manner unknown to me, are not entirely\r\nmotionless. The mandibles seize upon what is presented to them, the\r\nbody buckles and unbuckles, the hinder half lashes out briskly when\r\nstirred with the point of a needle. At what spot is the egg laid amid\r\nthat swarming mass, where thirty mandibles can make a hole in it, where\r\na hundred and twenty pairs of legs can tear it? When the victuals\r\nconsist of a single head of game, these perils do not exist; and the\r\negg is laid on the victim not at hazard, but upon a judiciously chosen\r\nspot. Thus, for instance, Ammophila hirsuta fixes hers, by one end,\r\ncross-wise, on the Grey Worm, on the side of the first prolegged\r\nsegment. The eggs hang over the caterpillar's back, away from the legs,\r\nwhose proximity might be dangerous. The worm, moreover, stung in the\r\ngreater number of its nerve-centres, lies on one side, motionless and\r\nincapable of bodily contortions or said an jerks of its hinder\r\nsegments. If the mandibles try to snap, if the legs give a kick or two,\r\nthey find nothing in front of them: the Ammophila's egg is at the\r\nopposite side. The tiny grub is thus able, as soon as it hatches, to\r\ndig into the giant's belly in full security.\r\n\r\nHow different are the conditions in the Eumenes' cell. The caterpillars\r\nare imperfectly paralysed, perhaps because they have received but a\r\nsingle stab; they toss about when touched with a pin; they are bound to\r\nwriggle when bitten by the larva. If the egg is laid on one of them,\r\nthe first morsel will, I admit, be consumed without danger, on\r\ncondition that the point of attack be wisely chosen; but there remain\r\nothers which are not deprived of every means of defence. Let a movement\r\ntake place in the mass; and the egg, shifted from the upper layer, will\r\ntumble into a pitfall of legs and mandibles. The least thing is enough\r\nto jeopardize its existence; and this least thing has every chance of\r\nbeing brought about in the disordered heap of caterpillars. The egg, a\r\ntiny cylinder, transparent as crystal, is extremely delicate: a touch\r\nwithers it, the least pressure crushes it.\r\n\r\nNo, its place is not in the mass of provisions, for the caterpillars, I\r\nrepeat, are not sufficiently harmless. Their paralysis is incomplete,\r\nas is proved by their contortions when I irritate them and shown, on\r\nthe other hand, by a very important fact. I have sometimes taken from\r\nEumenes Amedei's cell a few heads of game half transformed into\r\nchrysalids. It is evident that the transformation was effected in the\r\ncell itself and, therefore, after the operation which the Wasp had\r\nperformed upon them. Whereof does this operation consist? I cannot say\r\nprecisely, never having seen the huntress at work. The sting most\r\ncertainly has played its part; but where? And how often? This is what\r\nwe do not know. What we are able to declare is that the torpor is not\r\nvery deep, inasmuch as the patient sometimes retains enough vitality to\r\nshed its skin and become a chrysalid. Everything thus tends to make us\r\nask by what stratagem the egg is shielded from danger.\r\n\r\nThis stratagem I longed to discover; I would not be put off by the\r\nscarcity of nests, by the irksomeness of the searches, by the risk of\r\nsunstroke, by the time taken up, by the vain breaking open of\r\nunsuitable cells; I meant to see and I saw. Here is my method: with the\r\npoint of a knife and a pair of nippers, I make a side opening, a\r\nwindow, beneath the dome of Eumenes Amedei and Eumenes pomiformis. I\r\nwork with the greatest care, so as not to injure the recluse. Formerly\r\nI attacked the cupola from the top, now I attack it from the side. I\r\nstop when the breach is large enough to allow me to see the state of\r\nthings within.\r\n\r\nWhat is this state of things? I pause to give the reader time to\r\nreflect and to think out for himself a means of safety that will\r\nprotect the egg and afterwards the grub in the perilous conditions\r\nwhich I have set forth. Seek, think and contrive, such of you as have\r\ninventive minds. Have you guessed it? Do you give it up? I may as well\r\ntell you.\r\n\r\nThe egg is not laid upon the provisions; it is hung from the top of the\r\ncupola by a thread which vies with that of a Spider's web for\r\nslenderness. The dainty cylinder quivers and swings to and fro at the\r\nleast breath; it reminds me of the famous pendulum suspended from the\r\ndome of the Pantheon to prove the rotation of the earth. The victuals\r\nare heaped up underneath.\r\n\r\nSecond act of this wondrous spectacle. In order to witness it, we must\r\nopen a window in cell upon cell until fortune deigns to smile upon us.\r\nThe larva is hatched and already fairly large. Like the egg, it hangs\r\nperpendicularly, by the rear, from the ceiling; but the suspensory cord\r\nhas gained considerably in length and consists of the original thread\r\neked out by a sort of ribbon. The grub is at dinner: head downwards, it\r\nis digging into the limp belly of one of the caterpillars. I touch up\r\nthe game that is still intact with a straw. The caterpillars grow\r\nrestless. The grub forthwith retires from the fray. And how? Marvel is\r\nadded to marvels: what I took for a flat cord, for a ribbon, at the\r\nlower end of the suspensory thread, is a sheath, a scabbard, a sort of\r\nascending gallery wherein the larva crawls backwards and makes its way\r\nup. The cast shell of the egg, retaining its cylindrical form and\r\nperhaps lengthened by a special operation on the part of the new-born\r\ngrub, forms this safety-channel. At the least sign of danger in the\r\nheap of caterpillars, the larva retreats into its sheath and climbs\r\nback to the ceiling, where the swarming rabble cannot reach it. When\r\npeace is restored, it slides down its case and returns to table, with\r\nits head over the viands and its rear upturned and ready to withdraw in\r\ncase of need.\r\n\r\nThird and last act. Strength has come; the larva is brawny enough not\r\nto dread the movements of the caterpillars' bodies. Besides, the\r\ncaterpillars, mortified by fasting and weakened by a prolonged torpor,\r\nbecome more and more incapable of defence. The perils of the tender\r\nbabe are succeeded by the security of the lusty stripling; and the\r\ngrub, henceforth scorning its sheathed lift, lets itself drop upon the\r\ngame that remains. And thus the banquet ends in normal fashion.\r\n\r\nThat is what I saw in the nests of both species of the Eumenes and that\r\nis what I showed to friends who were even more surprised than I by\r\nthese ingenious tactics. The egg hanging from the ceiling, at a\r\ndistance from the provisions, has naught to fear from the caterpillars,\r\nwhich flounder about below. The new-hatched larva, whose suspensory\r\ncord is lengthened by the sheath of the egg, reaches the game and takes\r\na first cautious bite at it. If there be danger, it climbs back to the\r\nceiling by retreating inside the scabbard. This explains the failure of\r\nmy earlier attempts. Not knowing of the safety-thread, so slender and\r\nso easily broken, I gathered at one time the egg, at another the young\r\nlarva, after my inroads at the top had caused them to fall into the\r\nmiddle of the live victuals. Neither of them was able to thrive when\r\nbrought into direct contact with the dangerous game.\r\n\r\nIf any one of my readers, to whom I appealed just now, has thought out\r\nsomething better than the Eumenes' invention, I beg that he will let me\r\nknow: there is a curious parallel to be drawn between the inspirations\r\nof reason and the inspirations of instinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. THE OSMIAE.\r\n\r\nTHEIR HABITS.\r\n\r\nFebruary has its sunny days, heralding spring, to which rude winter\r\nwill reluctantly yield place. In snug corners, among the rocks, the\r\ngreat spurge of our district, the characias of the Greeks, the jusclo\r\nof the Provençals, begins to lift its drooping inflorescence and\r\ndiscreetly opens a few sombre flowers. Here the first midges of the\r\nyear will come to slake their thirst. By the time that the tip of the\r\nstalks reaches the perpendicular, the worst of the cold weather will be\r\nover.\r\n\r\nAnother eager one, the almond-tree, risking the loss of its fruit,\r\nhastens to echo these preludes to the festival of the sun, preludes\r\nwhich are too often treacherous. A few days of soft skies and it\r\nbecomes a glorious dome of white flowers, each twinkling with a roseate\r\neye. The country, which still lacks green, seems dotted everywhere with\r\nwhite-satin pavilions. 'Twould be a callous heart indeed that could\r\nresist the magic of this awakening.\r\n\r\nThe insect nation is represented at these rites by a few of its more\r\nzealous members. There is first of all the Honey-bee, the sworn enemy\r\nof strikes, who profits by the least lull of winter to find out if some\r\nrosemary or other is not beginning to open somewhere near the hive. The\r\ndroning of the busy swarms fills the flowery vault, while a snow of\r\npetals falls softly to the foot of the tree.\r\n\r\nTogether with the population of harvesters there mingles another, less\r\nnumerous, of mere drinkers, whose nesting-time has not yet begun. This\r\nis the colony of the Osmiae, those exceedingly pretty solitary bees,\r\nwith their copper-coloured skin and bright-red fleece. Two species have\r\ncome hurrying up to take part in the joys of the almond-tree: first,\r\nthe Horned Osmia, clad in black velvet on the head and breast, with red\r\nvelvet on the abdomen; and, a little later, the Three-horned Osmia,\r\nwhose livery must be red and red only. These are the first delegates\r\ndespatched by the pollen-gleaners to ascertain the state of the season\r\nand attend the festival of the early blooms.\r\n\r\n'Tis but a moment since they burst their cocoon, the winter abode: they\r\nhave left their retreats in the crevices of the old walls; should the\r\nnorth wind blow and set the almond-tree shivering, they will hasten to\r\nreturn to them. Hail to you, O my dear Osmiae, who yearly, from the far\r\nend of the harmas, opposite snow-capped Ventoux (A mountain in the\r\nProvençal Alps, near Carpentras and Sérignan 6,271 feet.--Translator's\r\nNote.), bring me the first tidings of the awakening of the insect\r\nworld! I am one of your friends; let us talk about you a little.\r\n\r\nMost of the Osmiae of my region do not themselves prepare the dwelling\r\ndestined for the laying. They want ready-made lodgings, such as the old\r\ncells and old galleries of Anthophorae and Chalicodomae. If these\r\nfavourite haunts are lacking, then a hiding-place in the wall, a round\r\nhole in some bit of wood, the tube of a reed, the spiral of a dead\r\nSnail under a heap of stones are adopted, according to the tastes of\r\nthe several species. The retreat selected is divided into chambers by\r\npartition-walls, after which the entrance to the dwelling receives a\r\nmassive seal. That is the sum-total of the building done.\r\n\r\nFor this plasterer's rather than mason's work, the Horned and the\r\nThree-horned Osmia employ soft earth. This material is a sort of dried\r\nmud, which turns to pap on the addition of a drop of water. The two\r\nOsmiae limit themselves to gathering natural soaked earth, mud in\r\nshort, which they allow to dry without any special preparation on their\r\npart; and so they need deep and well-sheltered retreats, into which the\r\nrain cannot penetrate, or the work would fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nLatreille's Osmia uses different materials for her partitions and her\r\ndoors. She chews the leaves of some mucilaginous plant, some mallow\r\nperhaps, and then prepares a sort of green putty with which she builds\r\nher partitions and finally closes the entrance to the dwelling. When\r\nshe settles in the spacious cells of the Masked Anthophora (Anthophora\r\npersonata, Illig.), the entrance to the gallery, which is wide enough\r\nto admit a man's finger, is closed with a voluminous plug of this\r\nvegetable paste. On the earthy banks, hardened by the sun, the home is\r\nthen betrayed by the gaudy colour of the lid. It is as though the\r\nauthorities had closed the door and affixed to it their great seals of\r\ngreen wax.\r\n\r\nSo far then as their building-materials are concerned, the Osmiae whom\r\nI have been able to observe are divided into two classes: one building\r\ncompartments with mud, the other with a green-tinted vegetable putty.\r\nTo the latter belongs Latreille's Osmia. The first section includes the\r\nHorned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia, both so remarkable for the\r\nhorny tubercles on their faces.\r\n\r\nThe great reed of the south, Arundo donax, is often used, in the\r\ncountry, for making rough garden-shelters against the mistral or just\r\nfor fences. These reeds, the ends of which are chopped off to make them\r\nall the same length, are planted perpendicularly in the earth. I have\r\noften explored them in the hope of finding Osmia-nests. My search has\r\nvery seldom succeeded. The failure is easily explained. The partitions\r\nand the closing-plug of the Horned and of the Three-horned Osmia are\r\nmade, as we have seen, of a sort of mud which water instantly reduces\r\nto pap. With the upright position of the reeds, the stopper of the\r\nopening would receive the rain and would become diluted; the ceilings\r\nof the storeys would fall in and the family would perish by drowning.\r\nTherefore the Osmia, who knew of these drawbacks before I did, refuses\r\nthe reeds when they are placed perpendicularly.\r\n\r\nThe same reed is used for a second purpose. We make canisses of it,\r\nthat is to say, hurdles, which, in spring, serve for the rearing of\r\nSilkworms and, in autumn, for the drying of figs. At the end of April\r\nand during May, which is the time when the Osmiae work, the canisses\r\nare indoors, in the Silkworm nurseries, where the Bee cannot take\r\npossession of them; in autumn, they are outside, exposing their layers\r\nof figs and peeled peaches to the sun; but by that time the Osmiae have\r\nlong disappeared. If, however, during the spring, an old, disused\r\nhurdle is left out of doors, in a horizontal position, the Three-horned\r\nOsmia often takes possession of it and makes use of the two ends, where\r\nthe reeds lie truncated and open.\r\n\r\nThere are other quarters that suit the Three-horned Osmia, who is not\r\nparticular, it seems to me, and will make shift with any hiding-place,\r\nso long as it have the requisite conditions of diameter, solidity,\r\nsanitation and kindly darkness. The most original dwellings that I know\r\nher to occupy are disused Snail-shells, especially the house of the\r\nCommon Snail (Helix aspersa). Let us go to the slope of the hills thick\r\nwith olive-trees and inspect the little supporting-walls which are\r\nbuilt of dry stones and face the south. In the crevices of this\r\ninsecure masonry we shall reap a harvest of old Snail-shells, plugged\r\nwith earth right up to the orifice. The family of the Three-horned\r\nOsmia is settled in the spiral of those shells, which is subdivided\r\ninto chambers by mud partitions.\r\n\r\nThe Three-pronged Osmia (O. Tridentata, Duf. and Per.) alone creates a\r\nhome of her own, digging herself a channel with her mandibles in dry\r\nbramble and sometimes in danewort.\r\n\r\nThe Osmia loves mystery. She wants a dark retreat, hidden from the eye.\r\nI would like, nevertheless, to watch her in the privacy of her home and\r\nto witness her work with the same facility as if she were nest-building\r\nin the open air. Perhaps there are some interesting characteristics to\r\nbe picked up in the depths of her retreats. It remains to be seen\r\nwhether my wish can be realized.\r\n\r\nWhen studying the insect's mental capacity, especially its very\r\nretentive memory for places, I was led to ask myself whether it would\r\nnot be possible to make a suitably-chosen Bee build in any place that I\r\nwished, even in my study. And I wanted, for an experiment of this sort,\r\nnot an individual but a numerous colony. My preference lent towards the\r\nThree-horned Osmia, who is very plentiful in my neighbourhood, where,\r\ntogether with Latreille's Osmia, she frequents in particular the\r\nmonstrous nests of the Chalicodoma of the Sheds. I therefore thought\r\nout a scheme for making the Three-horned Osmia accept my study as her\r\nsettlement and build her nest in glass tubes, through which I could\r\neasily watch the progress. To these crystal galleries, which might well\r\ninspire a certain distrust, were to be added more natural retreats:\r\nreeds of every length and thickness and disused Chalicodoma-nests taken\r\nfrom among the biggest and the smallest. A scheme like this sounds mad.\r\nI admit it, while mentioning that perhaps none ever succeeded so well\r\nwith me. We shall see as much presently.\r\n\r\nMy method is extremely simple. All I ask is that the birth of my\r\ninsects, that is to say, their first seeing the light, their emerging\r\nfrom the cocoon, should take place on the spot where I propose to make\r\nthem settle. Here there must be retreats of no matter what nature, but\r\nof a shape similar to that in which the Osmia delights. The first\r\nimpressions of sight, which are the most long-lived of any, shall bring\r\nback my insects to the place of their birth. And not only will the\r\nOsmiae return, through the always open windows, but they will also\r\nnidify on the natal spot, if they find something like the necessary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAnd so, all through the winter, I collect Osmia-cocoons picked up in\r\nthe nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds; I go to Carpentras to glean a\r\nmore plentiful supply in the nests of the Anthophora. I spread out my\r\nstock in a large open box on a table which receives a bright diffused\r\nlight but not the direct rays of the sun. The table stands between two\r\nwindows facing south and overlooking the garden. When the moment of\r\nhatching comes, those two windows will always remain open to give the\r\nswarm entire liberty to go in and out as it pleases. The glass tubes\r\nand reed-stumps are laid here and there, in fine disorder, close to the\r\nheaps of cocoons and all in a horizontal position, for the Osmia will\r\nhave nothing to do with upright reeds. Although such a precaution is\r\nnot indispensable, I take care to place some cocoons in each cylinder.\r\nThe hatching of some of the Osmiae will therefore take place under\r\ncover of the galleries destined to be the building-yard later; and the\r\nsite will be all the more deeply impressed on their memory. When I have\r\nmade these comprehensive arrangements, there is nothing more to be\r\ndone; and I wait patiently for the building-season to open.\r\n\r\nMy Osmiae leave their cocoons in the second half of April. Under the\r\nimmediate rays of the sun, in well-sheltered nooks, the hatching would\r\noccur a month earlier, as we can see from the mixed population of the\r\nsnowy almond-tree. The constant shade in my study has delayed the\r\nawakening, without, however, making any change in the nesting-period,\r\nwhich synchronizes with the flowering of the thyme. We now have, around\r\nmy working-table, my books, my jars and my various appliances, a\r\nbuzzing crowd that goes in and out of the windows at every moment. I\r\nenjoin the household henceforth not to touch a thing in the insects'\r\nlaboratory, to do no more sweeping, no more dusting. They might disturb\r\na swarm and make it think that my hospitality was not to be trusted.\r\nDuring four or five weeks I witness the work of a number of Osmiae\r\nwhich is much too large to allow my watching their individual\r\noperations. I content myself with a few, whom I mark with\r\ndifferent-coloured spots to distinguish them; and I take no notice of\r\nthe others, whose finished work will have my attention later.\r\n\r\nThe first to appear are the males. If the sun is bright, they flutter\r\naround the heap of tubes as if to take careful note of the locality;\r\nblows are exchanged and the rival swains indulge in mild skirmishing on\r\nthe floor, then shake the dust off their wings. They fly assiduously\r\nfrom tube to tube, placing their heads in the orifices to see if some\r\nfemale will at last make up her mind to emerge.\r\n\r\nOne does, in point of fact. She is covered with dust and has the\r\ndisordered toilet that is inseparable from the hard work of the\r\ndeliverance. A lover has seen her, so has a second, likewise a third.\r\nAll crowd round her. The lady responds to their advances by clashing\r\nher mandibles, which open and shut rapidly, several times in\r\nsuccession. The suitors forthwith fall back; and they also, no doubt to\r\nkeep up their dignity, execute savage mandibular grimaces. Then the\r\nbeauty retires into the arbour and her wooers resume their places on\r\nthe threshold. A fresh appearance of the female, who repeats the play\r\nwith her jaws; a fresh retreat of the males, who do the best they can\r\nto flourish their own pincers. The Osmiae have a strange way of\r\ndeclaring their passion: with that fearsome gnashing of their\r\nmandibles, the lovers look as though they meant to devour each other.\r\nIt suggests the thumps affected by our yokels in their moments of\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuous idyll is soon over. The females, who grow more numerous\r\nfrom day to day, inspect the premises; they buzz outside the glass\r\ngalleries and the reed dwellings; they go in, stay for a while, come\r\nout, go in again and then fly away briskly into the garden. They\r\nreturn, first one, then another. They halt outside, in the sun, or on\r\nthe shutters fastened back against the wall; they hover in the\r\nwindow-recess, come inside, go to the reeds and give a glance at them,\r\nonly to set off again and to return soon after. Thus do they learn to\r\nknow their home, thus do they fix their birthplace in their memory. The\r\nvillage of our childhood is always a cherished spot, never to be\r\neffaced from our recollection. The Osmia's life endures for a month;\r\nand she acquires a lasting remembrance of her hamlet in a couple of\r\ndays. 'Twas there that she was born; 'twas there that she loved; 'tis\r\nthere that she will return. Dulces reminiscitur Argos.\r\n\r\n  (Now falling by another's wound, his eyes\r\n  He casts to heaven, on Argos thinks and dies.\r\n  --\"Aeneid\" Book 10, Dryden's translation.)\r\n\r\nAt last each has made her choice. The work of construction begins; and\r\nmy expectations are fulfilled far beyond my wishes. The Osmiae build\r\nnests in all the retreats which I have placed at their disposal. And\r\nnow, O my Osmiae, I leave you a free field!\r\n\r\nThe work begins with a thorough spring-cleaning of the home. Remnants\r\nof cocoons, dirt consisting of spoilt honey, bits of plaster from\r\nbroken partitions, remains of dried Mollusc at the bottom of a shell:\r\nthese and much other insanitary refuse must first of all disappear.\r\nViolently the Osmia tugs at the offending object and tears it out; and\r\nthen off she goes in a desperate hurry, to dispose of it far away from\r\nthe study. They are all alike, these ardent sweepers: in their\r\nexcessive zeal, they fear lest they should block up the speck of dust\r\nwhich they might drop in front of the new house. The glass tubes, which\r\nI myself have rinsed under the tap, are not exempt from a scrupulous\r\ncleaning. The Osmia dusts them, brushes them thoroughly with her tarsi\r\nand then sweeps them out backwards. What does she pick up? Not a thing.\r\nIt makes no difference: as a conscientious housewife, she gives the\r\nplace a touch of the broom nevertheless.\r\n\r\nNow for the provisions and the partition-walls. Here the order of the\r\nwork changes according to the diameter of the cylinder. My glass tubes\r\nvary greatly in dimensions. The largest have an inner width of a dozen\r\nmillimetres (Nearly half an inch.--Translator's Note.); the narrowest\r\nmeasure six or seven. (About a quarter of an inch.--Translator's Note.)\r\nIn the latter, if the bottom suit her, the Osmia sets to work bringing\r\npollen and honey. If the bottom do not suit her, if the sorghum-pith\r\nplug with which I have closed the rear-end of the tube be too irregular\r\nand badly-joined, the Bee coats it with a little mortar. When this\r\nsmall repair is made, the harvesting begins.\r\n\r\nIn the wider tubes, the work proceeds quite differently. At the moment\r\nwhen the Osmia disgorges her honey and especially at the moment when,\r\nwith her hind-tarsi, she rubs the pollen-dust from her ventral brush,\r\nshe needs a narrow aperture, just big enough to allow of her passage. I\r\nimagine that in a straitened gallery the rubbing of her whole body\r\nagainst the sides gives the harvester a support for her brushing-work.\r\nIn a spacious cylinder this support fails her; and the Osmia starts\r\nwith creating one for herself, which she does by narrowing the channel.\r\nWhether it be to facilitate the storing of the victuals or for any\r\nother reason, the fact remains that the Osmia housed in a wide tube\r\nbegins with the partitioning.\r\n\r\nHer division is made by a dab of clay placed at right angles to the\r\naxis of the cylinder, at a distance from the bottom determined by the\r\nordinary length of a cell. The wad is not a complete round; it is more\r\ncrescent-shaped, leaving a circular space between it and one side of\r\nthe tube. Fresh layers are swiftly added to the dab of clay; and soon\r\nthe tube is divided by a partition which has a circular opening at the\r\nside of it, a sort of dog-hole through which the Osmia will proceed to\r\nknead the Bee-bread. When the victualling is finished and the egg laid\r\nupon the heap, the whole is closed and the filled-up partition becomes\r\nthe bottom of the next cell. Then the same method is repeated, that is\r\nto say, in front of the just completed ceiling a second partition is\r\nbuilt, again with a side-passage, which is stouter, owing to its\r\ndistance from the centre, and better able to withstand the numerous\r\ncomings and goings of the housewife than a central orifice, deprived of\r\nthe direct support of the wall, could hope to be. When this partition\r\nis ready, the provisioning of the second cell is effected; and so on\r\nuntil the wide cylinder is completely stocked.\r\n\r\nThe building of this preliminary party-wall, with a narrow, round\r\ndog-hole, for a chamber to which the victuals will not be brought until\r\nlater is not restricted to the Three-horned Osmia; it is also\r\nfrequently found in the case of the Horned Osmia and of Latreille's\r\nOsmia. Nothing could be prettier than the work of the last-named, who\r\ngoes to the plants for her material and fashions a delicate sheet in\r\nwhich she cuts a graceful arch. The Chinaman partitions his house with\r\npaper screens; Latreille's Osmia divides hers with disks of thin green\r\ncardboard perforated with a serving-hatch which remains until the room\r\nis completely furnished. When we have no glass houses at our disposal,\r\nwe can see these little architectural refinements in the reeds of the\r\nhurdles, if we open them at the right season.\r\n\r\nBy splitting the bramble-stumps in the course of July, we perceive also\r\nthat the Three-pronged Osmia notwithstanding her narrow gallery,\r\nfollows the same practice as Latreille's Osmia, with a difference. She\r\ndoes not build a party-wall, which the diameter of the cylinder would\r\nnot permit; she confines herself to putting up a frail circular pad of\r\ngreen putty, as though to limit, before any attempt at harvesting, the\r\nspace to be occupied by the Bee-bread, whose depth could not be\r\ncalculated afterwards if the insect did not first mark out its\r\nconfines.\r\n\r\nIf, in order to see the Osmia's nest as a whole, we split a reed\r\nlengthwise, taking care not to disturb its contents; or, better still,\r\nif we select for examination the string of cells built in a glass tube,\r\nwe are forthwith struck by one detail, namely, the uneven distances\r\nbetween the partitions, which are placed almost at right angles to the\r\naxis of the cylinder. It is these distances which fix the size of the\r\nchambers, which, with a similar base, have different heights and\r\nconsequently unequal holding-capacities. The bottom partitions, the\r\noldest, are farther apart; those of the front part, near the orifice,\r\nare closer together. Moreover, the provisions are plentiful in the\r\nloftier cells, whereas they are niggardly and reduced to one-half or\r\neven one-third in the cells of lesser height. Let me say at once that\r\nthe large cells are destined for the females and the small ones for the\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE SEXES.\r\n\r\nDoes the insect which stores up provisions proportionate to the needs\r\nof the egg which it is about to lay know beforehand the sex of that\r\negg? Or is the truth even more paradoxical? What we have to do is to\r\nturn this suspicion into a certainty demonstrated by experiment. And\r\nfirst let us find out how the sexes are arranged.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to ascertain the chronological order of a laying,\r\nexcept by going to suitably-chosen species. Fortunately there are a few\r\nspecies in which we do not find this difficulty: these are the Bees who\r\nkeep to one gallery and build their cells in storeys. Among the number\r\nare the different inhabitants of the bramble-stumps, notably the\r\nThree-pronged Osmiae, who form an excellent subject for observation,\r\npartly because they are of imposing size--bigger than any other\r\nbramble-dwellers in my neighbourhood--partly because they are so\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly recall the Osmia's habits. Amid the tangle of a hedge, a\r\nbramble-stalk is selected, still standing, but a mere withered stump.\r\nIn this the insect digs a more or less deep tunnel, an easy piece of\r\nwork owing to the abundance of soft pith. Provisions are heaped up\r\nright at the bottom of the tunnel and an egg is laid on the surface of\r\nthe food: that is the first-born of the family. At a height of some\r\ntwelve millimetres (About half an inch.--Translator's Note.), a\r\npartition is fixed. This gives a second storey, which in its turn\r\nreceives provisions and an egg, the second in order of primogeniture.\r\nAnd so it goes on, storey by storey, until the cylinder is full. Then\r\nthe thick plug of the same green material of which the partitions are\r\nformed closes the home and keeps out marauders.\r\n\r\nIn this common cradle, the chronological order of births is perfectly\r\nclear. The first-born of the family is at the bottom of the series; the\r\nlast-born is at the top, near the closed door. The others follow from\r\nbottom to top in the same order in which they followed in point of\r\ntime. The laying is numbered automatically; each cocoon tells us its\r\nrespective age by the place which it occupies.\r\n\r\nA number of eggs bordering on fifteen represents the entire family of\r\nan Osmia, and my observations enable me to state that the distribution\r\nof the sexes is not governed by any rule. All that I can say in general\r\nis that the complete series begins with females and nearly always ends\r\nwith males. The incomplete series--those which the insect has laid in\r\nvarious places--can teach us nothing in this respect, for they are only\r\nfragments starting we know not whence; and it is impossible to tell\r\nwhether they should be ascribed to the beginning, to the end, or to an\r\nintermediate period of the laying. To sum up: in the laying of the\r\nThree-pronged Osmia, no order governs the succession of the sexes;\r\nonly, the series has a marked tendency to begin with females and to\r\nfinish with males.\r\n\r\nThe mother occupies herself at the start with the stronger sex, the\r\nmore necessary, the better-gifted, the female sex, to which she devotes\r\nthe first flush of her laying and the fullness of her vigour; later,\r\nwhen she is perhaps already at the end of her strength, she bestows\r\nwhat remains of her maternal solicitude upon the weaker sex, the\r\nless-gifted, almost negligible male sex. There are, however, other\r\nspecies where this law becomes absolute, constant and regular.\r\n\r\nIn order to go more deeply into this curious question I installed some\r\nhives of a new kind on the sunniest walls of my enclosure. They\r\nconsisted of stumps of the great reed of the south, open at one end,\r\nclosed at the other by the natural knot and gathered into a sort of\r\nenormous pan-pipe, such as Polyphemus might have employed. The\r\ninvitation was accepted: Osmiae came in fairly large numbers, to\r\nbenefit by the queer installation.\r\n\r\nThree Osmiae especially (O. Tricornis, Latr., O. cornuta, Latr., O.\r\nLatreillii, Spin.) gave me splendid results, with reed-stumps arranged\r\neither against the wall of my garden, as I have just said, or near\r\ntheir customary abode, the huge nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.\r\nOne of them, the Three-horned Osmia, did better still: as I have\r\ndescribed, she built her nests in my study, as plentifully as I could\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nWe will consult this last, who has furnished me with documents beyond\r\nmy fondest hopes, and begin by asking her of how many eggs her average\r\nlaying consists. Of the whole heap of colonized tubes in my study, or\r\nelse out of doors, in the hurdle-reeds and the pan-pipe appliances, the\r\nbest-filled contains fifteen cells, with a free space above the series,\r\na space showing that the laying is ended, for, if the mother had any\r\nmore eggs available, she would have lodged them in the room which she\r\nleaves unoccupied. This string of fifteen appears to be rare; it was\r\nthe only one that I found. My attempts at indoor rearing, pursued\r\nduring two years with glass tubes or reeds, taught me that the\r\nThree-horned Osmia is not much addicted to long series. As though to\r\ndecrease the difficulties of the coming deliverance, she prefers short\r\ngalleries, in which only a part of the laying is stacked. We must then\r\nfollow the same mother in her migration from one dwelling to the next\r\nif we would obtain a complete census of her family. A spot of colour,\r\ndropped on the Bee's thorax with a paint-brush while she is absorbed in\r\nclosing up the mouth of the tunnel, enables us to recognize the Osmia\r\nin her various homes.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the swarm that resided in my study furnished me, in the\r\nfirst year, with an average of twelve cells. Next year, the summer\r\nappeared to be more favourable and the average became rather higher,\r\nreaching fifteen. The most numerous laying performed under my eyes, not\r\nin a tube, but in a succession of Snail-shells, reached the figure of\r\ntwenty-six. On the other hand, layings of between eight and ten are not\r\nuncommon. Lastly, taking all my records together, the result is that\r\nthe family of the Osmia fluctuates roundabout fifteen in number.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the great differences in size apparent in the\r\ncells of one and the same series. The partitions, at first widely\r\nspaced, draw gradually nearer to one another as they come closer to the\r\naperture, which implies roomy cells at the back and narrow cells in\r\nfront. The contents of these compartments are no less uneven between\r\none portion and another of the string. Without any exception known to\r\nme, the large cells, those with which the series starts, have more\r\nabundant provisions than the straitened cells with which the series\r\nends. The heap of honey and pollen in the first is twice or even thrice\r\nas large as that in the second. In the last cells, the most recent in\r\ndate, the victuals are but a pinch of pollen, so niggardly in amount\r\nthat we wonder what will become of the larva with that meagre ration.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the Osmia, when nearing the end of the laying,\r\nattaches no importance to her last-born, to whom she doles out space\r\nand food so sparingly. The first-born receive the benefit of her early\r\nenthusiasm: theirs is the well-spread table, theirs the spacious\r\napartments. The work has begun to pall by the time that the last eggs\r\nare laid; and the last-comers have to put up with a scurvy portion of\r\nfood and a tiny corner.\r\n\r\nThe difference shows itself in another way after the cocoons are spun.\r\nThe large cells, those at the back, receive the bulky cocoons; the\r\nsmall ones, those in front, have cocoons only half or a third as big.\r\nBefore opening them and ascertaining the sex of the Osmia inside, let\r\nus wait for the transformation into the perfect insect, which will take\r\nplace towards the end of summer. If impatience get the better of us, we\r\ncan open them at the end of July or in August. The insect is then in\r\nthe nymphal stage; and it is easy, under this form, to distinguish the\r\ntwo sexes by the length of the antennae, which are larger in the males,\r\nand by the glassy protuberances on the forehead, the sign of the future\r\narmour of the females. Well, the small cocoons, those in the narrow\r\nfront cells, with their scanty store of provisions, all belong to\r\nmales; the big cocoons, those in the spacious and well-stocked cells at\r\nthe back, all belong to females.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is definite: the laying of the Three-horned Osmia\r\nconsists of two distinct groups, first a group of females and then a\r\ngroup of males.\r\n\r\nWith my pan-pipe apparatus displayed on the walls of my enclosure and\r\nwith old hurdle-reeds left lying flat out of doors, I obtained the\r\nHorned Osmia in fair quantities. I persuaded Latreille's Osmia to build\r\nher nest in reeds, which she did with a zeal which I was far from\r\nexpecting. All that I had to do was to lay some reed-stumps\r\nhorizontally within her reach, in the immediate neighbourhood of her\r\nusual haunts, namely, the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds. Lastly,\r\nI succeeded without difficulty in making her build her nests in the\r\nprivacy of my study, with glass tubes for a house. The result surpassed\r\nmy hopes.\r\n\r\nWith both these Osmiae, the division of the gallery is the same as with\r\nthe Three-horned Osmia. At the back are large cells with plentiful\r\nprovisions and widely-spaced partitions; in front, small cells, with\r\nscanty provisions and partitions close together. Also, the larger cells\r\nsupplied me with big cocoons and females; the smaller cells gave me\r\nlittle cocoons and males. The conclusion therefore is exactly the same\r\nin the case of all three Osmiae.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions, as my notes show, apply likewise, in every respect,\r\nto the various species of Mason-bees; and one clear and simple rule\r\nstands out from this collection of facts. Apart from the strange\r\nexception of the Three-pronged Osmia, who mixes the sexes without any\r\norder, the Bees whom I studied and probably a crowd of others produce\r\nfirst a continuous series of females and then a continuous series of\r\nmales, the latter with less provisions and smaller cells. This\r\ndistribution of the sexes agrees with what we have long known of the\r\nHive-bee, who begins her laying with a long sequence of workers, or\r\nsterile females, and ends it with a long sequence of males. The analogy\r\ncontinues down to the capacity of the cells and the quantities of\r\nprovisions. The real females, the Queen-bees, have wax cells\r\nincomparably more spacious than the cells of the males and receive a\r\nmuch larger amount of food. Everything therefore demonstrates that we\r\nare here in the presence of a general rule.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL DETERMINATION OF THE SEXES.\r\n\r\nBut does this rule express the whole truth? Is there nothing beyond a\r\nlaying in two series? Are the Osmiae, the Chalicodomae and the rest of\r\nthem fatally bound by this distribution of the sexes into two distinct\r\ngroups, the male group following upon the female group, without any\r\nmixing of the two? Is the mother absolutely powerless to make a change\r\nin this arrangement, should circumstances require it?\r\n\r\nThe Three-pronged Osmia already shows us that the problem is far from\r\nbeing solved. In the same bramble-stump, the two sexes occur very\r\nirregularly, as though at random. Why this mixture in the series of\r\ncocoons of a Bee closely related to the Horned Osmia and the\r\nThree-horned Osmia, who stack theirs methodically by separate sexes in\r\nthe hollow of a reed? What the Bee of the brambles does cannot her\r\nkinswomen of the reeds do too? Nothing, so far as I know, explains this\r\nfundamental difference in a physiological act of primary importance.\r\nThe three Bees belong to the same genus; they resemble one another in\r\ngeneral outline, internal structure and habits; and, with this close\r\nsimilarity, we suddenly find a strange dissimilarity.\r\n\r\nThere is just one thing that might possibly arouse a suspicion of the\r\ncause of this irregularity in the Three-pronged Osmia's laying. If I\r\nopen a bramble-stump in the winter to examine the Osmia's nest, I find\r\nit impossible, in the vast majority of cases, to distinguish positively\r\nbetween a female and a male cocoon: the difference in size is so small.\r\nThe cells, moreover, have the same capacity: the diameter of the\r\ncylinder is the same throughout and the partitions are almost always\r\nthe same distance apart. If I open it in July, the victualling-period,\r\nit is impossible for me to distinguish between the provisions destined\r\nfor the males and those destined for the females. The measurement of\r\nthe column of honey gives practically the same depth in all the cells.\r\nWe find an equal quantity of space and food for both sexes.\r\n\r\nThis result makes us foresee what a direct examination of the two sexes\r\nin the adult form tells us. The male does not differ materially from\r\nthe female in respect of size. If he is a trifle smaller, it is\r\nscarcely noticeable, whereas, in the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned\r\nOsmia, the male is only half or a third the size of the female, as we\r\nhave seen from the respective bulk of their cocoons. In the Mason-bee\r\nof the Walls there is also a difference in size, though less\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\nThe Three-pronged Osmia has not therefore to trouble about adjusting\r\nthe dimensions of the dwelling and the quantity of the food to the sex\r\nof the egg which she is about to lay; the measure is the same from one\r\nend of the series to the other. It does not matter if the sexes\r\nalternate without order: one and all will find what they need, whatever\r\ntheir position in the row. The two other Osmiae, with their great\r\ndisparity in size between the two sexes, have to be careful about the\r\ntwofold consideration of board and lodging.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought about this curious question, the more probable it\r\nappeared to me that the irregular series of the Three-pronged Osmia and\r\nthe regular series of the other Osmiae and of the Bees in general were\r\nall traceable to a common law. It seemed to me that the arrangement in\r\na succession first of females and then of males did not account for\r\neverything. There must be something more. And I was right: that\r\narrangement in series is only a tiny fraction of the reality, which is\r\nremarkable in a very different way. This is what I am going to prove by\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe succession first of females and then of males is not, in fact,\r\ninvariable. Thus, the Chalicodoma, whose nests serve for two or three\r\ngenerations, ALWAYS lays male eggs in the old male cells, which can be\r\nrecognized by their lesser capacity, and female eggs in the old female\r\ncells of more spacious dimensions.\r\n\r\nThis presence of both sexes at a time, even when there are but two\r\ncells free, one spacious and the other small, proves in the plainest\r\nfashion that the regular distribution observed in the complete nests of\r\nrecent production is here replaced by an irregular distribution,\r\nharmonizing with the number and holding-capacity of the chambers to be\r\nstocked. The Mason-bee has before her, let me suppose, only five vacant\r\ncells: two larger and three smaller. The total space at her disposal\r\nwould do for about a third of the laying. Well, in the two large cells,\r\nshe puts females; in the three small cells she puts males.\r\n\r\nAs we find the same sort of thing in all the old nests, we must needs\r\nadmit that the mother knows the sex of the eggs which she is going to\r\nlay, because that egg is placed in a cell of the proper capacity. We\r\ncan go further, and admit that the mother alters the order of\r\nsuccession of the sexes at her pleasure, because her layings, between\r\none old nest and another, are broken up into small groups of males and\r\nfemales according to the exigencies of space in the actual nest which\r\nshe happens to be occupying.\r\n\r\nHere then is the Chalicodoma, when mistress of an old nest of which she\r\nhas not the power to alter the arrangement, breaking up her laying into\r\nsections comprising both sexes just as required by the conditions\r\nimposed upon her. She therefore decides the sex of the egg at will,\r\nfor, without this prerogative, she could not, in the chambers of the\r\nnest which she owes to chance, deposit unerringly the sex for which\r\nthose chambers were originally built; and this happens however small\r\nthe number of chambers to be filled.\r\n\r\nWhen the mother herself founds the dwelling, when she lays the first\r\nrows of bricks, the females come first and the males at the finish.\r\nBut, when she is in the presence of an old nest, of which she is quite\r\nunable to alter the general arrangement, how is she to make use of a\r\nfew vacant rooms, the large and small alike, if the sex of the egg be\r\nalready irrevocably fixed? She can only do so by abandoning the\r\narrangement in two consecutive rows and accommodating her laying to the\r\nvaried exigencies of the home. Either she finds it impossible to make\r\nan economical use of the old nest, a theory refuted by the evidence, or\r\nelse she determines at will the sex of the egg which she is about to\r\nlay.\r\n\r\nThe Osmiae themselves will furnish the most conclusive evidence on the\r\nlatter point. We have seen that these Bees are not generally miners,\r\nwho themselves dig out the foundation of their cells. They make use of\r\nthe old structures of others, or else of natural retreats, such as\r\nhollow stems, the spirals of empty shells and various hiding-places in\r\nwalls, clay or wood. Their work is confined to repairs to the house,\r\nsuch as partitions and covers. There are plenty of these retreats; and\r\nthe insects would always find first-class ones if it thought of going\r\nany distance to look for them. But the Osmia is a stay-at-home: she\r\nreturns to her birthplace and clings to it with a patience extremely\r\ndifficult to exhaust. It is here, in this little familiar corner, that\r\nshe prefers to settle her progeny. But then the apartments are few in\r\nnumber and of all shapes and sizes. There are long and short ones,\r\nspacious ones and narrow. Short of expatriating herself, a Spartan\r\ncourse, she has to use them all, from first to last, for she has no\r\nchoice. Guided by these considerations, I embarked on the experiments\r\nwhich I will now describe.\r\n\r\nI have said how my study became a populous hive, in which the\r\nThree-horned Osmia built her nests in the various appliances which I\r\nhad prepared for her. Among these appliances, tubes, either of glass or\r\nreed, predominated. There were tubes of all lengths and widths. In the\r\nlong tubes, entire or almost entire layings, with a series of females\r\nfollowed by a series of males, were deposited. As I have already\r\nreferred to this result, I will not discuss it again. The short tubes\r\nwere sufficiently varied in length to lodge one or other portion of the\r\ntotal laying. Basing my calculations on the respective lengths of the\r\ncocoons of the two sexes, on the thickness of the partitions and the\r\nfinal lid, I shortened some of these to the exact dimensions required\r\nfor two cocoons only, of different sexes.\r\n\r\nWell, these short tubes, whether of glass or reed, were seized upon as\r\neagerly as the long tubes. Moreover, they yielded this splendid result:\r\ntheir contents, only a part of the total laying, always began with\r\nfemale and ended with male cocoons. This order was invariable; what\r\nvaried was the number of cells in the long tubes and the proportion\r\nbetween the two sorts of cocoons, sometimes males predominating and\r\nsometimes females.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted with tubes too small to receive all her family, the\r\nOsmia is in the same plight as the Mason-bee in the presence of an old\r\nnest. She thereupon acts exactly as the Chalicodoma does. She breaks up\r\nher laying, divides it into series as short as the room at her disposal\r\ndemands; and each series begins with females and ends with males. This\r\nbreaking up, on the one hand, into sections in all of which both sexes\r\nare represented and the division, on the other hand, of the entire\r\nlaying into just two groups, one female, the other male, when the\r\nlength of the tube permits, surely provide us with ample evidence of\r\nthe insect's power to regulate the sex of the egg according to the\r\nexigencies of space.\r\n\r\nAnd besides the exigencies of space one might perhaps venture to add\r\nthose connected with the earlier development of the males. These burst\r\ntheir cocoons a couple of weeks or more before the females; they are\r\nthe first who hasten to the sweets of the almond-tree. In order to\r\nrelease themselves and emerge into the glad sunlight without disturbing\r\nthe string of cocoons wherein their sisters are still sleeping, they\r\nmust occupy the upper end of the row; and this, no doubt, is the reason\r\nthat makes the Osmia end each of her broken layings with males. Being\r\nnext to the door, these impatient ones will leave the home without\r\nupsetting the shells that are slower in hatching.\r\n\r\nI had offered at the same time to the Osmiae in my study some old nests\r\nof the Mason-bee of the Shrubs, which are clay spheroids with\r\ncylindrical cavities in them. These cavities are formed, as in the old\r\nnests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, of the cell properly so-called\r\nand of the exit-way which the perfect insect cut through the outer\r\ncoating at the time of its deliverance. The diameter is about 7\r\nmillimetres (.273 inch.--Translator's Note.); their depth at the centre\r\nof the heap is 23 millimetres (.897 inch.--Translator's Note.) and at\r\nthe edge averages 14 millimetres. (.546 inch.--Translator's Note.)\r\n\r\nThe deep central cells receive only the females of the Osmia; sometimes\r\neven the two sexes together, with a partition in the middle, the female\r\noccupying the lower and the male the upper storey. Lastly, the deeper\r\ncavities on the circumference are allotted to females and the shallower\r\nto males.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Three-horned Osmia prefers to haunt the habitations of\r\nthe Bees who nidify in populous colonies, such as the Mason-bee of the\r\nSheds and the Hairy-footed Anthophora, in whose nests I have noted\r\nsimilar facts.\r\n\r\nThus the sex of the egg is optional. The choice rests with the mother,\r\nwho is guided by considerations of space and, according to the\r\naccommodation at her disposal, which is frequently fortuitous and\r\nincapable of modification, places a female in this cell and a male in\r\nthat, so that both may have a dwelling of a size suited to their\r\nunequal development. This is the unimpeachable evidence of the numerous\r\nand varied facts which I have set forth. People unfamiliar with insect\r\nanatomy--the public for whom I write--would probably give the following\r\nexplanation of this marvellous prerogative of the Bee: the mother has\r\nat her disposal a certain number of eggs, some of which are irrevocably\r\nfemale and the others irrevocably male: she is able to pick out of\r\neither group the one which she wants at the actual moment; and her\r\nchoice is decided by the holding capacity of the cell that has to be\r\nstocked. Everything would then be limited to a judicious selection from\r\nthe heap of eggs.\r\n\r\nShould this idea occur to him, the reader must hasten to reject it.\r\nNothing could be more false, as the most casual reference to anatomy\r\nwill show. The female reproductive apparatus of the Hymenoptera\r\nconsists generally of six ovarian tubes, something like glove-fingers,\r\ndivided into bunches of three and ending in a common canal, the\r\noviduct, which carries the eggs outside. Each of these glove-fingers is\r\nfairly wide at the base, but tapers sharply towards the tip, which is\r\nclosed. It contains, arranged in a row, one after the other, like beads\r\non a string, a certain number of eggs, five or six for instance, of\r\nwhich the lower ones are more or less developed, the middle ones\r\nhalfway towards maturity, and the upper ones very rudimentary. Every\r\nstage of evolution is here represented, distributed regularly from\r\nbottom to top, from the verge of maturity to the vague outlines of the\r\nembryo. The sheath clasps its string of ovules so closely that any\r\ninversion of the order is impossible. Besides, an inversion would\r\nresult in a gross absurdity: the replacing of a riper egg by another in\r\nan earlier stage of development.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in each ovarian tube, in each glove-finger, the emergence of\r\nthe eggs occurs according to the order governing their arrangement in\r\nthe common sheath; and any other sequence is absolutely impossible.\r\nMoreover, at the nesting-period, the six ovarian sheaths, one by one\r\nand each in its turn, have at their base an egg which in a very short\r\ntime swells enormously. Some hours or even a day before the laying,\r\nthat egg by itself represents or even exceeds in bulk the whole of the\r\novigerous apparatus. This is the egg which is on the point of being\r\nlaid. It is about to descend into the oviduct, in its proper order, at\r\nits proper time; and the mother has no power to make another take its\r\nplace. It is this egg, necessarily this egg and no other, that will\r\npresently be laid upon the provisions, whether these be a mess of honey\r\nor a live prey; it alone is ripe, it alone lies at the entrance to the\r\noviduct; none of the others, since they are farther back in the row and\r\nnot at the right stage of development, can be substituted at this\r\ncrisis. Its birth is inevitable.\r\n\r\nWhat will it yield, a male or a female? No lodging has been prepared,\r\nno food collected for it; and yet both food and lodging have to be in\r\nkeeping with the sex that will proceed from it. And here is a much more\r\npuzzling condition: the sex of that egg, whose advent is predestined,\r\nhas to correspond with the space which the mother happens to have found\r\nfor a cell. There is therefore no room for hesitation, strange though\r\nthe statement may appear: the egg, as it descends from its ovarian\r\ntube, has no determined sex. It is perhaps during the few hours of its\r\nrapid development at the base of its ovarian sheath, it is perhaps on\r\nits passage through the oviduct that it receives, at the mother's\r\npleasure, the final impress that will produce, to match the cradle\r\nwhich it has to fill, either a female or a male.\r\n\r\nPERMUTATIONS OF SEX.\r\n\r\nThereupon the following question presents itself. Let us admit that,\r\nwhen the normal conditions remain, a laying would have yielded m\r\nfemales and n males. Then, if my conclusions are correct, it must be in\r\nthe mother's power, when the conditions are different, to take from the\r\nm group and increase the n group to the same extent; it must be\r\npossible for her laying to be represented as m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, etc.\r\nfemales and by n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, etc. males, the sum of m + n\r\nremaining constant, but one of the sexes being partly permuted into the\r\nother. The ultimate conclusion even cannot be disregarded: we must\r\nadmit a set of eggs represented by m - m, or zero, females and of n + m\r\nmales, one of the sexes being completely replaced by the other.\r\nConversely, it must be possible for the feminine series to be augmented\r\nfrom the masculine series to the extent of absorbing it entirely. It\r\nwas to solve this question and some others connected with it that I\r\nundertook, for the second time, to rear the Three-horned Osmia in my\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThe problem on this occasion is a more delicate one; but I am also\r\nbetter-equipped. My apparatus consists of two small closed\r\npacking-cases, with the front side of each pierced with forty holes, in\r\nwhich I can insert my glass tubes and keep them in a horizontal\r\nposition. I thus obtain for the Bees the darkness and mystery which\r\nsuit their work and for myself the power of withdrawing from my hive,\r\nat any time, any tube that I wish, with the Osmia inside, so as to\r\ncarry it to the light and follow, if need be with the aid of the lens,\r\nthe operations of the busy worker. My investigations, however frequent\r\nand minute, in no way hinder the peaceable Bee, who remains absorbed in\r\nher maternal duties.\r\n\r\nI mark a plentiful number of my guests with a variety of dots on the\r\nthorax, which enables me to follow any one Osmia from the beginning to\r\nthe end of her laying. The tubes and their respective holes are\r\nnumbered; a list, always lying open on my desk, enables me to note from\r\nday to day, sometimes from hour to hour, what happens in each tube and\r\nparticularly the actions of the Osmiae whose backs bear distinguishing\r\nmarks. As soon as one tube is filled, I replace it by another.\r\nMoreover, I have scattered in front of either hive a few handfuls of\r\nempty Snail-shells, specially chosen for the object which I have in\r\nview. Reasons which I will explain later led me to prefer the shells of\r\nHelix caespitum. Each of the shells, as and when stocked, received the\r\ndate of the laying and the alphabetical sign corresponding with the\r\nOsmia to whom it belonged. In this way, I spent five or six weeks in\r\ncontinual observation. To succeed in an enquiry, the first and foremost\r\ncondition is patience. This condition I fulfilled; and it was rewarded\r\nwith the success which I was justified in expecting.\r\n\r\nThe tubes employed are of two kinds. The first, which are cylindrical\r\nand of the same width throughout, will be of use for confirming the\r\nfacts observed in the first year of my experiments in indoor rearing.\r\nThe others, the majority, consist of two cylinders which are of very\r\ndifferent diameters, set end to end. The front cylinder, the one which\r\nprojects a little way outside the hive and forms the entrance-hole,\r\nvaries in width between 8 and 12 millimetres. (Between .312 and .468\r\ninch.--Translator's Note.) The second, the back one, contained entirely\r\nwithin my packing-case, is closed at its far end and is 5 to 6\r\nmillimetres in diameter. (.195 to .234 inch.--Translator's Note.) Each\r\nof the two parts of the double-galleried tunnel, one narrow and one\r\nwide, measures at most a decimetre in length. (3.9\r\ninches.--Translator's Note.) I thought it advisable to have these short\r\ntubes, as the Osmia is thus compelled to select different lodgings,\r\neach of them being insufficient in itself to accommodate the total\r\nlaying. In this way I shall obtain a greater variety in the\r\ndistribution of the sexes. Lastly, at the mouth of each tube, which\r\nprojects slightly outside the case, there is a little paper tongue,\r\nforming a sort of perch on which the Osmia alights on her arrival and\r\ngiving easy access to the house. With these facilities, the swarm\r\ncolonized fifty-two double-galleried tubes, thirty-seven cylindrical\r\ntubes, seventy-eight Snail-shells and a few old nests of the Mason-bee\r\nof the Shrubs. From this rich mine of material I will take what I want\r\nto prove my case.\r\n\r\nEvery series, even when incomplete, begins with females and ends with\r\nmales. To this rule I have not yet found an exception, at least in\r\ngalleries of normal diameter. In each new abode the mother busies\r\nherself first of all with the more important sex. Bearing this point in\r\nmind, would it be possible for me, by manoeuvring, to obtain an\r\ninversion of this order and make the laying begin with males? I think\r\nso, from the results already ascertained and the irresistible\r\nconclusions to be drawn from them. The double-galleried tubes are\r\ninstalled in order to put my conjectures to the proof.\r\n\r\nThe back gallery, 5 or 6 millimetres wide (.195 to .234\r\ninch.--Translator's Note.), is too narrow to serve as a lodging for\r\nnormally developed females. If, therefore, the Osmia, who is very\r\neconomical of her space, wishes to occupy them, she will be obliged to\r\nestablish males there. And her laying must necessarily begin here,\r\nbecause this corner is the rear-most part of the tube. The foremost\r\ngallery is wide, with an entrance-door on the front of the hive. Here,\r\nfinding the conditions to which she is accustomed, the mother will go\r\non with her laying in the order which she prefers.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what has happened. Of the fifty-two double-galleried\r\ntubes, about a third did not have their narrow passage colonized. The\r\nOsmia closed its aperture communicating with the large passage; and the\r\nlatter alone received the eggs. This waste of space was inevitable. The\r\nfemale Osmiae, though nearly always larger than the males, present\r\nmarked differences among one another: some are bigger, some are\r\nsmaller. I had to adjust the width of the narrow galleries to Bees of\r\naverage dimensions. It may happen therefore that a gallery is too small\r\nto admit the large-sized mothers to whom chance allots it. When the\r\nOsmia is unable to enter the tube, obviously she will not colonize it.\r\nShe then closes the entrance to this space which she cannot use and\r\ndoes her laying beyond it, in the wide tube. Had I tried to avoid these\r\nuseless apparatus by choosing tubes of larger calibre, I should have\r\nencountered another drawback: the medium-sized mothers, finding\r\nthemselves almost comfortable, would have decided to lodge females\r\nthere. I had to be prepared for it: as each mother selected her house\r\nat will and as I was unable to interfere in her choice, a narrow tube\r\nwould be colonized or not, according as the Osmia who owned it was or\r\nwas not able to make her way inside.\r\n\r\nThere remain some forty pairs of tubes with both galleries colonized.\r\nIn these there are two things to take into consideration. The narrow\r\nrear tubes of 5 or 5 1/2 millimetres (.195 to .214 inch.--Translator's\r\nNote.)--and these are the most numerous--contain males and males only,\r\nbut in short series, between one and five. The mother is here so much\r\nhampered in her work that they are rarely occupied from end to end; the\r\nOsmia seems in a hurry to leave them and to go and colonize the front\r\ntube, whose ample space will leave her the liberty of movement\r\nnecessary for her operations. The other rear tubes, the minority, whose\r\ndiameter is about 6 millimetres (.234 inch.--Translator's Note.),\r\ncontain sometimes only females and sometimes females at the back and\r\nmales towards the opening. One can see that a tube a trifle wider and a\r\nmother slightly smaller would account for this difference in the\r\nresults. Nevertheless, as the necessary space for a female is barely\r\nprovided in this case, we see that the mother avoids as far as she can\r\na two-sex arrangement beginning with males and that she adopts it only\r\nin the last extremity. Finally, whatever the contents of the small tube\r\nmay be, those of the large one, following upon it, never vary and\r\nconsist of females at the back and males in front.\r\n\r\nThough incomplete, because of circumstances very difficult to control,\r\nthe result of the experiment is none the less very remarkable.\r\nTwenty-five apparatus contain only males in their narrow gallery, in\r\nnumbers varying from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. After these\r\ncomes the colony of the large gallery, beginning with females and\r\nending with males. And the layings in these apparatus do not always\r\nbelong to late summer or even to the intermediate period: a few small\r\ntubes contain the earliest eggs of the entire swarm. A couple of\r\nOsmiae, more forward than the others, set to work on the 23rd of April.\r\nBoth of them started their laying by placing males in the narrow tubes.\r\nThe meagre supply of provisions was enough in itself to show the sex,\r\nwhich proved later to be in accordance with my anticipations. We see\r\nthen that, by my artifices, the whole swarm starts with the converse of\r\nthe normal order. This inversion is continued, at no matter what\r\nperiod, from the beginning to the end of the operations. The series\r\nwhich, according to rule, would begin with females now begins with\r\nmales. Once the larger gallery is reached, the laying is pursued in the\r\nusual order.\r\n\r\nWe have advanced one step and that no small one: we have seen that the\r\nOsmia, when circumstances require it, is capable of reversing the\r\nsequence of the sexes. Would it be possible, provided that the tube\r\nwere long enough, to obtain a complete inversion, in which the entire\r\nseries of the males should occupy the narrow gallery at the back and\r\nthe entire series of the females the roomy gallery in front? I think\r\nnot; and I will tell you why.\r\n\r\nLong and narrow cylinders are by no means to the Osmia's taste, not\r\nbecause of their narrowness but because of their length. Observe that\r\nfor each load of honey brought the worker is obliged to move backwards\r\ntwice. She enters, head first, to begin by disgorging the honey-syrup\r\nfrom her crop. Unable to turn in a passage which she blocks entirely,\r\nshe goes out backwards, crawling rather than walking, a laborious\r\nperformance on the polished surface of the glass and a performance\r\nwhich, with any other surface, would still be very awkward, as the\r\nwings are bound to rub against the wall with their free end and are\r\nliable to get rumpled or bent. She goes out backwards, reaches the\r\noutside, turns round and goes in again, but this time the opposite way,\r\nso as to brush off the load of pollen from her abdomen on to the heap.\r\nIf the gallery is at all long, this crawling backwards becomes\r\ntroublesome after a time; and the Osmia soon abandons a passage that is\r\ntoo small to allow of free movement. I have said that the narrow tubes\r\nof my apparatus are, for the most part, only very incompletely\r\ncolonized. The Bee, after lodging a small number of males in them,\r\nhastens to leave them. In the wide front gallery she can stay where she\r\nis and still be able to turn round easily for her different\r\nmanipulations; she will avoid those two long journeys backwards, which\r\nare so exhausting and so bad for her wings.\r\n\r\nAnother reason no doubt prompts her not to make too great a use of the\r\nnarrow passage, in which she would establish males, followed by females\r\nin the part where the gallery widens. The males have to leave their\r\ncells a couple of weeks or more before the females. If they occupy the\r\nback of the house they will die prisoners or else they will overturn\r\neverything on their way out. This risk is avoided by the order which\r\nthe Osmia adopts.\r\n\r\nIn my tubes, with their unusual arrangement, the mother might well find\r\nthe dilemma perplexing: there is the narrowness of the space at her\r\ndisposal and there is the emergence later on. In the narrow tubes, the\r\nwidth is insufficient for the females; on the other hand, if she lodges\r\nmales there, they are liable to perish, since they will be prevented\r\nfrom issuing at the proper moment. This would perhaps explain the\r\nmother's hesitation and her obstinacy in settling females in some of my\r\napparatus which looked as if they could suit none but males.\r\n\r\nA suspicion occurs to me, a suspicion aroused by my attentive\r\nexamination of the narrow tubes. All, whatever the number of their\r\ninmates, are carefully plugged at the opening, just as separate tubes\r\nwould be. It might therefore be the case that the narrow gallery at the\r\nback was looked upon by the Osmia not as the prolongation of the large\r\nfront gallery, but as an independent tube. The facility with which the\r\nworker turns as soon as she reaches the wide tube, her liberty of\r\naction, which is now as great as in a doorway communicating with the\r\nouter air, might well be misleading and cause the Osmia to treat the\r\nnarrow passage at the back as though the wide passage in front did not\r\nexist. This would account for the placing of the female in the large\r\ntube above the males in the small tube, an arrangement contrary to her\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nI will not undertake to decide whether the mother really appreciates\r\nthe danger of my snares, or whether she makes a mistake in considering\r\nonly the space at her disposal and beginning with males, who are liable\r\nto remain imprisoned. At any rate, I perceive a tendency to deviate as\r\nlittle as possible from the order which safeguards the emergence of\r\nboth sexes. This tendency is demonstrated by her repugnance to\r\ncolonizing my narrow tubes with long series of males. However, so far\r\nas we are concerned, it does not matter much what passes at such times\r\nin the Osmia's little brain. Enough for us to know that she dislikes\r\nnarrow and long tubes, not because they are narrow, but because they\r\nare at the same time long.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, she does very well with a short tube of the same\r\ndiameter. Such are the cells in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the\r\nShrubs and the empty shells of the Garden Snail. With the short tube\r\nthe two disadvantages of the long tube are avoided. She has very little\r\nof that crawling backwards to do when she has a Snail-shell for the\r\nhome of her eggs and scarcely any when the home is the cell of the\r\nMason-bee. Moreover, as the stack of cocoons numbers two or three at\r\nmost, the deliverance will be exempt from the difficulties attached to\r\na long series. To persuade the Osmia to nidify in a single tube long\r\nenough to receive the whole of her laying and at the same time narrow\r\nenough to leave her only just the possibility of admittance appears to\r\nme a project without the slightest chance of success: the Bee would\r\nstubbornly refuse such a dwelling or would content herself with\r\nentrusting only a very small portion of her eggs to it. On the other\r\nhand, with narrow but short cavities, success, without being easy,\r\nseems to me at least quite possible. Guided by these considerations, I\r\nembarked upon the most arduous part of my problem: to obtain the\r\ncomplete or almost complete permutation of one sex with the other; to\r\nproduce a laying consisting only of males by offering the mother a\r\nseries of lodgings suited only to males.\r\n\r\nLet us in the first place consult the old nests of the Mason-bee of the\r\nShrubs. I have said that these mortar spheroids, pierced all over with\r\nlittle cylindrical cavities, are a adopted pretty eagerly by the\r\nThree-horned Osmia, who colonizes them before my eyes with females in\r\nthe deep cells and males in the shallow cells. That is how things go\r\nwhen the old nest remains in its natural state. With a grater, however,\r\nI scrape the outside of another nest so as to reduce the depth of the\r\ncavities to some ten millimetres. (About two-fifths of an\r\ninch.--Translator's Note.) This leaves in each cell just room for one\r\ncocoon, surmounted by the closing stopper. Of the fourteen cavities in\r\nthe nests, I leave two intact, measuring fifteen millimetres in depth.\r\n(.585 inch.--Translator's Note.) Nothing could be more striking than\r\nthe result of this experiment, made in the first year of my home\r\nrearing. The twelve cavities whose depth had been reduced all received\r\nmales; the two cavities left untouched received females.\r\n\r\nA year passes and I repeat the experiment with a nest of fifteen cells;\r\nbut this time all the cells are reduced to the minimum depth with the\r\ngrater. Well, the fifteen cells, from first to last, are occupied by\r\nmales. It must be quite understood that, in each case, all the\r\noffspring belonged to one mother, marked with her distinguishing dot\r\nand kept in sight as long as her laying lasted. He would indeed be\r\ndifficult to please who refused to bow before the results of these two\r\nexperiments. If, however, he is not yet convinced, here is something to\r\nremove his last doubts.\r\n\r\nThe Three-horned Osmia often settles her family in old shells,\r\nespecially those of the Common Snail (Helix aspersa), who is so common\r\nunder the stone-heaps and in the crevices of the little unmortared\r\nwalls that support our terraces. In this species the spiral is wide\r\nopen, so that the Osmia, penetrating as far down as the helical passage\r\npermits, finds, immediately above the point which is too narrow to\r\npass, the space necessary for the cell of a female. This cell is\r\nsucceeded by others, wider still, always for females, arranged in a\r\nline in the same way as in a straight tube. In the last whorl of the\r\nspiral, the diameter would be too great for a single row. Then\r\nlongitudinal partitions are added to the transverse partitions, the\r\nwhole resulting in cells of unequal dimensions in which males\r\npredominate, mixed with a few females in the lower storeys. The\r\nsequence of the sexes is therefore what it would be in a straight tube\r\nand especially in a tube with a wide bore, where the partitioning is\r\ncomplicated by subdivisions on the same level. A single Snail-shell\r\ncontains room for six or eight cells. A large, rough earthen stopper\r\nfinishes the nest at the entrance to the shell.\r\n\r\nAs a dwelling of this sort could show us nothing new, I chose for my\r\nswarm the Garden Snail (Helix caespitum), whose shell, shaped like a\r\nsmall swollen Ammonite, widens by slow degrees, the diameter of the\r\nusable portion, right up to the mouth, being hardly greater than that\r\nrequired by a male Osmia-cocoon. Moreover, the widest part, in which a\r\nfemale might find room, has to receive a thick stopping-plug, below\r\nwhich there will often be a free space. Under all these conditions, the\r\nhouse will hardly suit any but males arranged one after the other.\r\n\r\nThe collection of shells placed at the foot of each hive includes\r\nspecimens of different sizes. The smallest are 18 millimetres (.7\r\ninch.--Translator's Note.) in diameter and the largest 24 millimetres.\r\n(.936 inch.--Translator's Note.) There is room for two cocoons, or\r\nthree at most, according to their dimensions.\r\n\r\nNow these shells were used by my visitors without any hesitation,\r\nperhaps even with more eagerness than the glass tubes, whose slippery\r\nsides might easily be a little annoying to the Bee. Some of them were\r\noccupied on the first few days of the laying; and the Osmia who had\r\nstarted with a home of this sort would pass next to a second\r\nSnail-shell, in the immediate neighbourhood of the first, to a third, a\r\nfourth and others still, always close together, until her ovaries were\r\nemptied. The whole family of one mother would thus be lodged in\r\nSnail-shells which were duly marked with the date of the laying and a\r\ndescription of the worker. The faithful adherents of the Snail-shell\r\nwere in the minority. The greater number left the tubes to come to the\r\nshells and then went back from the shells to the tubes. All, after\r\nfilling the spiral staircase with two or three cells, closed the house\r\nwith a thick earthen stopper on a level with the opening. It was a long\r\nand troublesome task, in which the Osmia displayed all her patience as\r\na mother and all her talents as a plasterer.\r\n\r\nWhen the pupae are sufficiently matured, I proceed to examine these\r\nelegant abodes. The contents fill me with joy: they fulfil my\r\nanticipations to the letter. The great, the very great majority of the\r\ncocoons turn out to be males; here and there, in the bigger cells, a\r\nfew rare females appear. The smallness of the space has almost done\r\naway with the stronger sex. This result is demonstrated by the\r\nsixty-eight Snail-shells colonized. But, of this total number, I must\r\nuse only those series which received an entire laying and were occupied\r\nby the same Osmia from the beginning to the end of the egg-season. Here\r\nare a few examples, taken from among the most conclusive.\r\n\r\nFrom the 6th of May, when she started operations, to the 25th of May,\r\nthe date at which her laying ceased, one Osmia occupied seven\r\nSnail-shells in succession. Her family consists of fourteen cocoons, a\r\nnumber very near the average; and, of these fourteen cocoons, twelve\r\nbelong to males and only two to females.\r\n\r\nAnother, between the 9th and 27th of May, stocked six Snail-shells with\r\na family of thirteen, including ten males and three females.\r\n\r\nA third, between the 2nd and 29th of May colonized eleven Snail-shells,\r\na prodigious task. This industrious one was also exceedingly prolific.\r\nShe supplied me with a family of twenty-six, the largest which I have\r\never obtained from one Osmia. Well, this abnormal progeny consisted of\r\ntwenty-five males and one female.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to go on, after this magnificent example, especially\r\nas the other series would all, without exception, give us the same\r\nresult. Two facts are immediately obvious: the Osmia is able to reverse\r\nthe order of her laying and to start with a more or less long series of\r\nmales before producing any females. There is something better still;\r\nand this is the proposition which I was particularly anxious to prove:\r\nthe female sex can be permuted with the male sex and can be permuted to\r\nthe point of disappearing altogether. We see this especially in the\r\nthird case, where the presence of a solitary female in a family of\r\ntwenty-six is due to the somewhat larger diameter of the corresponding\r\nSnail-shell.\r\n\r\nThere would still remain the inverse permutation: to obtain only\r\nfemales and no males, or very few. The first permutation makes the\r\nsecond seem very probable, although I cannot as yet conceive a means of\r\nrealizing it. The only condition which I can regulate is the dimensions\r\nof the home. When the rooms are small, the males abound and the females\r\ntend to disappear. With generous quarters, the converse would not take\r\nplace. I should obtain females and afterwards an equal number of males,\r\nconfined in small cells which, in case of need, would be bounded by\r\nnumerous partitions. The factor of space does not enter into the\r\nquestion here. What artifice can we then employ to provoke this second\r\npermutation? So far, I can think of nothing that is worth attempting.\r\n\r\nIt is time to conclude. Leading a retired life, in the solitude of a\r\nvillage, having quite enough to do with patiently and obscurely\r\nploughing my humble furrow, I know little about modern scientific\r\nviews. In my young days I had a passionate longing for books and found\r\nit difficult to procure them; to-day, when I could almost have them if\r\nI wanted, I am ceasing to wish for them. It is what usually happens as\r\nlife goes on. I do not therefore know what may have been done in the\r\ndirection whither this study of the sexes has led me. If I am stating\r\npropositions that are really new or at least more comprehensive than\r\nthe propositions already known, my words will perhaps sound heretical.\r\nNo matter: as a simple translator of facts, I do not hesitate to make\r\nmy statement, being fully persuaded that time will turn my heresy into\r\northodoxy. I will therefore recapitulate my conclusions.\r\n\r\nBees lay their eggs in series of first females and then males, when the\r\ntwo sexes are of different sizes and demand an unequal quantity of\r\nnourishment. When the two sexes are alike in size, as in the case of\r\nLatreille's Osmia, the same sequence may occur, but less regularly.\r\n\r\nThis dual arrangement disappears when the place chosen for the nest is\r\nnot large enough to contain the entire laying. We then see broken\r\nlayings, beginning with females and ending with males.\r\n\r\nThe egg, as it issues from the ovary, has not yet a fixed sex. The\r\nfinal impress that produces the sex is given at the moment of laying,\r\nor a little before.\r\n\r\nSo as to be able to give each larva the amount of space and food that\r\nsuits it according as it is male or female, the mother can choose the\r\nsex of the egg which she is about to lay. To meet the conditions of the\r\nbuilding, which is often the work of another or else a natural retreat\r\nthat admits of little or no alteration, she lays either a male egg or a\r\nfemale egg AS SHE PLEASES. The distribution of the sexes depends upon\r\nherself. Should circumstances require it, the order of the laying can\r\nbe reversed and begin with males; lastly, the entire laying can contain\r\nonly one sex.\r\n\r\nThe same privilege is possessed by the predatory Hymenoptera, the\r\nWasps, at least by those in whom the two sexes are of a different size\r\nand consequently require an amount of nourishment that is larger in the\r\none case than in the other. The mother must know the sex of the egg\r\nwhich she is going to lay; she must be able to choose the sex of that\r\negg so that each larva may obtain its proper portion of food.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, when the sexes are of different sizes, every insect\r\nthat collects food and prepares or selects a dwelling for its offspring\r\nmust be able to choose the sex of the egg in order to satisfy without\r\nmistake the conditions imposed upon it.\r\n\r\nThe question remains how this optional assessment of the sexes is\r\neffected. I know absolutely nothing about it. If I should ever learn\r\nanything about this delicate point, I shall owe it to some happy chance\r\nfor which I must wait, or rather watch, patiently.\r\n\r\nThen what explanation shall I give of the wonderful facts which I have\r\nset forth? Why, none, absolutely none. I do not explain facts, I relate\r\nthem. Growing daily more sceptical of the interpretations suggested to\r\nme and more hesitating as to those which I myself may have to suggest,\r\nthe more I observe and experiment, the more clearly I see rising out of\r\nthe black mists of possibility an enormous note of interrogation.\r\n\r\nDear insects, my study of you has sustained me and continues to sustain\r\nme in my heaviest trials; I must take leave of you for to-day. The\r\nranks are thinning around me and the long hopes have fled. Shall I be\r\nable to speak of you again? (This forms the closing paragraph of Volume\r\n3 of the \"Souvenirs entomologiques,\" of which the author lived to\r\npublish seven more volumes, containing over 2,500 pages and nearly\r\n850,000 words.--Translator's Note.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. THE GLOW-WORM.\r\n\r\nFew insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm, that\r\ncurious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of life,\r\nkindles a beacon at its tail-end. Who does not know it, at least by\r\nname? Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen from\r\nthe moon at its full? The Greeks of old called it lampouris, meaning,\r\nthe bright-tailed. Science employs the same term: it calls it the\r\nlantern-bearer, Lampyris noctiluca, Lin. In this case the common name\r\nis inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when translated, becomes\r\nboth expressive and accurate.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we might easily cavil at the word \"worm.\" The Lampyris is not\r\na worm at all, not even in general appearance. He has six short legs,\r\nwhich he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a trot-about. In the\r\nadult state the male is correctly garbed in wing-cases, like the true\r\nBeetle that he is. The female is an ill-favoured thing who knows naught\r\nof the delights of flying: all her life long she retains the larval\r\nshape, which, for the rest, is similar to that of the male, who himself\r\nis imperfect so long as he has not achieved the maturity that comes\r\nwith pairing-time. Even in this initial stage the word \"worm\" is out of\r\nplace. We French have the expression \"Naked as a worm\" to point to the\r\nlack of any defensive covering. Now the Lampyris is clothed, that is to\r\nsay, he wears an epidermis of some consistency; moreover, he is rather\r\nrichly coloured: his body is dark brown all over, set off with pale\r\npink on the thorax, especially on the lower surface. Finally, each\r\nsegment is decked at the hinder edge with two spots of a fairly bright\r\nred. A costume like this was never worn by a worm.\r\n\r\nLet us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the\r\nLampyris feeds upon. That master of the art of gastronomy,\r\nBrillat-Savarin, said: \"Show me what you eat and I will tell you what\r\nyou are.\"\r\n\r\nA similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to\r\nevery insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the least to\r\nthe greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the\r\nworld; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents of\r\nlife. Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is an\r\neater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with rare\r\nvillainy. His regular prey is the Snail.\r\n\r\nThis detail has long been known to entomologists. What is not so well\r\nknown, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have read, is\r\nthe curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other instance\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nBefore he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anaesthetic: he\r\nchloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of our\r\nmodern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before operating\r\non him. The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of a cherry,\r\nsuch as, for instance, Helix variabilis, Drap., who, in the hot\r\nweather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and other long, dry\r\nstalks by the road-side and there remains motionless, in profound\r\nmeditation, throughout the scorching summer days. It is in some such\r\nresting-place as this that I have often been privileged to light upon\r\nthe Lampyris banqueting on the prey which he had just paralysed on its\r\nshaky support by his surgical artifices.\r\n\r\nBut he is familiar with other preserves. He frequents the edges of the\r\nirrigating ditches, with their cool soil, their varied vegetation, a\r\nfavourite haunt of the Mollusc. Here, he treats the game on the ground;\r\nand, under these conditions, it is easy for me to rear him at home and\r\nto follow the operator's performance down to the smallest detail.\r\n\r\nI will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight. I place a\r\nlittle grass in a wide glass jar. In this I instal a few Glow-worms and\r\na provision of snails of a suitable size, neither too large nor too\r\nsmall, chiefly Helix variabilis. We must be patient and wait. Above\r\nall, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired events come\r\nunexpectedly and do not last long.\r\n\r\nHere we are at last. The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the prey,\r\nwhich, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the shell, except\r\nthe edge of the mantle, which projects slightly. Then the hunter's\r\nweapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that cannot be plainly\r\nperceived without the aid of a lens. It consists of two mandibles bent\r\nback powerfully into a hook, very sharp and as thin as a hair. The\r\nmicroscope reveals the presence of a slender groove running throughout\r\nthe length. And that is all.\r\n\r\nThe insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument. It\r\nall happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than\r\nbites. As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of \"tweaksies\"\r\nto express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something more like a\r\ntickling than a serious pinch. Let us use that word. In conversing with\r\nanimals, language loses nothing by remaining juvenile. It is the right\r\nway for the simple to understand one another.\r\n\r\nThe Lampyris doles out his tweaks. He distributes them methodically,\r\nwithout hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as though\r\nhe wished to ascertain the effect produced. Their number is not great:\r\nhalf a dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it of all power\r\nof movement. That other pinches are administered later, at the time of\r\neating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain,\r\nbecause the sequel escapes me. The first few, however--there are never\r\nmany--are enough to impart inertia and loss of all feeling to the\r\nMollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might almost say lightning, methods of\r\nthe Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils some poison or other by\r\nmeans of his grooved hooks.\r\n\r\nHere is the proof of the sudden efficacy of those twitches, so mild in\r\nappearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated on the\r\nedge of the mantle some four or five times. I prick him with a fine\r\nneedle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its shell, still\r\nleaves exposed. There is no quiver of the wounded tissues, no reaction\r\nagainst the brutality of the needle. A corpse itself could not give\r\nfewer signs of life.\r\n\r\nHere is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me\r\nSnails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the foot\r\nslowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent. A few\r\ndisordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the\r\nMollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the front\r\npart loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become limp and\r\ngive way under their own weight, dangling feebly like a broken stick.\r\nThis condition persists.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Snail really dead? Not at all, for I can resuscitate the seeming\r\ncorpse at will. After two or three days of that singular condition\r\nwhich is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the patient and,\r\nthough this is not really essential to success, I give him a douche\r\nwhich will represent the shower so dear to the able-bodied Mollusc. In\r\nabout a couple of days, my prisoner, but lately injured by the\r\nGlow-worm's treachery, is restored to his normal state. He revives, in\r\na manner; he recovers movement and sensibility. He is affected by the\r\nstimulus of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts out his\r\ntentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred. The general torpor,\r\na sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright. The dead returns to\r\nlife. What name shall we give to that form of existence which, for a\r\ntime, abolishes the power of movement and the sense of pain? I can see\r\nbut one that is approximately suitable: anaesthesia. The exploits of a\r\nhost of Wasps whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is\r\nmotionless though not dead have taught us the skilful art of the\r\nparalysing insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its\r\nvenom. We have now a humble little animal that first produces complete\r\nanaesthesia in its patient. Human science did not in reality invent\r\nthis art, which is one of the wonders of latter-day surgery. Much\r\nearlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,\r\nothers knew it as well. The animal's knowledge had a long start of\r\nours; the method alone has changed. Our operators proceed by making us\r\ninhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by\r\ninjecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in\r\ninfinitesimal doses. Might we not one day be able to benefit from this\r\nhint? What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for us,\r\nif we understood the beastie's secrets better!\r\n\r\nWhat does the Lampyris want with anaesthetical talent against a\r\nharmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never\r\nbegin the quarrel of his own accord? I think I see. We find in Algeria\r\na beetle known as Drilus maroccanus, who, though non-luminous,\r\napproaches our Glow-worm in his organization and especially in his\r\nhabits. He, too, feeds on Land Molluscs. His prey is a Cyclostome with\r\na graceful spiral shell, tightly closed with a stony lid which is\r\nattached to the animal by a powerful muscle. The lid is a movable door\r\nwhich is quickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal into his house\r\nand as easily opened when the hermit goes forth. With this system of\r\nclosing, the abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus knows it.\r\n\r\nFixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof the\r\nLampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the\r\nlook-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time. At last the\r\nneed of air and food obliges the besieged non-combatant to show\r\nhimself: at least, the door is set slightly ajar. That is enough. The\r\nDrilus is on the spot and strikes his blow. The door can no longer be\r\nclosed; and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress. Our\r\nfirst impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with a\r\nquick-acting pair of shears. This idea must be dismissed. The Drilus is\r\nnot well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy mass so\r\npromptly. The operation has to succeed at once, at the first touch: if\r\nnot, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full vigour, and the\r\nsiege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever, exposing the insect to\r\nfasts indefinitely prolonged. Although I have never come across the\r\nDrilus, who is a stranger to my district, I conjecture a method of\r\nattack very similar to that of the Glow-worm. Like our own Snail-eater,\r\nthe Algerian insect does not cut its victim into small pieces: it\r\nrenders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a few tweaks which are\r\neasily distributed, if the lid but half-opens for a second. That will\r\ndo. The besieger thereupon enters and, in perfect quiet, consumes a\r\nprey incapable of the least muscular effort. That is how I see things\r\nby the unaided light of logic.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the Glow-worm. When the Snail is on the ground,\r\ncreeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents any\r\ndifficulty. The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's\r\nfore-part to a great extent exposed. Here, on the edges of the mantle,\r\ncontracted by the fear of danger, the Mollusc is vulnerable and\r\nincapable of defence. But it also frequently happens that the Snail\r\noccupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or\r\nperhaps to the smooth surface of a stone. This support serves him as a\r\ntemporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might try\r\nto molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express condition\r\nthat no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting circumference. If,\r\non the other hand, in the frequent case when the shell does not fit its\r\nsupport quite closely, some point, however tiny, be left uncovered,\r\nthis is enough for the subtle tools of the Lampyris, who just nibbles\r\nat the Mollusc and at once plunges him into that profound immobility\r\nwhich favours the tranquil proceedings of the consumer.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings are marked by extreme prudence. The assailant has to\r\nhandle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which would\r\nmake the Snail let go his support and, at the very least, precipitate\r\nhim from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully slumbering. Now any\r\ngame falling to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss, for the\r\nGlow-worm has no great zeal for hunting-expeditions: he profits by the\r\ndiscoveries which good luck sends him, without undertaking assiduous\r\nsearches. It is essential, therefore, that the equilibrium of a prize\r\nperched on the top of a stalk and only just held in position by a touch\r\nof glue should be disturbed as little as possible during the onslaught;\r\nit is necessary that the assailant should go to work with infinite\r\ncircumspection and without producing pain, lest any muscular reaction\r\nshould provoke a fall and endanger the prize. As we see, sudden and\r\nprofound anaesthesia is an excellent means of enabling the Lampyris to\r\nattain his object, which is to consume his prey in perfect quiet.\r\n\r\nWhat is his manner of consuming it? Does he really eat, that is to say,\r\ndoes he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute\r\nparticles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus? I think\r\nnot. I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives' mouths.\r\nThe Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word: he drinks\r\nhis fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms his prey by\r\na method recalling that of the maggot. Like the flesh-eating grub of\r\nthe Fly, he too is able to digest before consuming; he liquefies his\r\nprey before feeding on it.\r\n\r\nThis is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by the\r\nGlow-worm. The operator is nearly always alone, even when the prize is\r\na large one, like the common Snail, Helix aspersa. Soon a number of\r\nguests hasten up--two, three, or more--and, without any quarrel with\r\nthe real proprietor, all alike fall to. Let us leave them to themselves\r\nfor a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the opening\r\ndownwards. The contents flow out as easily as would soup from an\r\noverturned saucepan. When the sated diners retire from this gruel, only\r\ninsignificant leavings remain.\r\n\r\nThe matter is obvious. By repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks\r\nwhich we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the Mollusc is\r\nconverted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish\r\nthemselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of\r\nsome special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it. In\r\nconsequence of this method, which first converts the food into a\r\nliquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from the\r\ntwo fangs which sting the patient and inject the anaesthetic poison and\r\nat the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning the solid\r\nflesh into fluid. Those two tiny implements, which can just be examined\r\nthrough the lens, must, it seems, have some other object. They are\r\nhollow, and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, who sucks and\r\ndrains her capture without having to divide it; but there is this great\r\ndifference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants, which are\r\nafterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the sand,\r\nwhereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquifier, leaves nothing, or next\r\nto nothing. With similar tools, the one simply sucks the blood of his\r\nprey and the other turns every morsel of his to account, thanks to a\r\npreliminary liquefaction.\r\n\r\nAnd this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is\r\nsometimes anything but steady. My rearing-glasses supply me with\r\nmagnificent examples. Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in\r\nmy apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass\r\npane, and fix themselves to it with a speck of glair. This is a mere\r\ntemporary halt, in which the Mollusc is miserly with his adhesive\r\nproduct, and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and send it\r\nto the bottom of the jar.\r\n\r\nNow it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself up there, with\r\nthe help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak legs.\r\nHe selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find an\r\nentrance-slit, nibbles at it a little, renders it insensible and,\r\nwithout delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume for\r\ndays on end.\r\n\r\nWhen he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;\r\nand yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint\r\nstickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in\r\nthe smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit gradually\r\nconverted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which the\r\nfirst attack was delivered. These small details tell us how promptly\r\nthe anaesthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how dexterously the\r\nGlow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to fall from a very\r\nslippery, vertical support and without even shaking him on his slight\r\nline of adhesion.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy\r\nlegs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is needed\r\nto defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable. And this\r\napparatus the Lampyris possesses. At the hinder end of the animal we\r\nsee a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen short, fleshy\r\nappendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster, sometimes spread into a\r\nrosette. There is your organ of adhesion and locomotion. If he would\r\nfix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth surface, such as a\r\ngrass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and spreads it wide on the\r\nsupport, to which it adheres by its own stickiness. The same organ,\r\nrising and falling, opening and closing, does much to assist the act of\r\nprogression. In short, the Glow-worm is a new sort of self-propelled\r\ncripple, who decks his hind-quarters with a dainty white rose, a kind\r\nof hand with twelve fingers, not jointed, but moving in every\r\ndirection: tubular fingers which do not seize, but stick.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and\r\nbrush. At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and\r\nrepasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder parts, a\r\nperformance made possible by the flexibility of his spine. This is done\r\npoint by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a\r\nscrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes in\r\nthe operation. What is his object in thus sponging himself, in dusting\r\nand polishing himself so carefully? It is a question, apparently, of\r\nremoving a few atoms of dust or else some traces of viscidity that\r\nremain from the evil contact with the Snail. A wash and brush-up is not\r\nsuperfluous when one leaves the tub in which the Mollusc has been\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nIf the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming\r\nhis prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be\r\nunknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself like\r\na beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving fame.\r\nLet us consider more particularly the female, who, while retaining her\r\nlarval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her best during the\r\nhottest part of summer. The lighting-apparatus occupies the last three\r\nsegments of the abdomen. On each of the first two it takes the form, on\r\nthe ventral surface, of a wide belt covering almost the whole of the\r\narch; on the third the luminous part is much less and consists simply\r\nof two small crescent-shaped markings, or rather two spots which shine\r\nthrough to the back and are visible both above and below the animal.\r\nBelts and spots emit a glorious white light, delicately tinged with\r\nblue. The general lighting of the Glow-worm thus comprises two groups:\r\nfirst, the wide belts of the two segments preceding the last; secondly,\r\nthe two spots of the final segments. The two belts, the exclusive\r\nattribute of the marriageable female, are the parts richest in light:\r\nto glorify her wedding, the future mother dons her brightest gauds; she\r\nlights her two resplendent scarves. But, before that, from the time of\r\nthe hatching, she had only the modest rush-light of the stern. This\r\nefflorescence of light is the equivalent of the final metamorphosis,\r\nwhich is usually represented by the gift of wings and flight. Its\r\nbrilliance heralds the pairing-time. Wings and flight there will be\r\nnone: the female retains her humble larval form, but she kindles her\r\nblazing beacon.\r\n\r\nThe male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,\r\nacquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he\r\npossesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end\r\nsegment. This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the\r\nentire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season. It appears\r\nupon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged. And we\r\nmust not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on\r\nthe ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the female\r\nshine only under the abdomen.\r\n\r\nMy hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were; but,\r\nas far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the\r\nluminous organs. I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to separate\r\npretty nearly half of one of the shining belts. I place my preparation\r\nunder the microscope. On the skin a sort of white-wash lies spread,\r\nformed of a very fine, granular substance. This is certainly the\r\nlight-producing matter. To examine this white layer more closely is\r\nbeyond the power of my weary eyes. Just beside it is a curious\r\nair-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches suddenly into a\r\nsort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications. These creep over the\r\nluminous sheet, or even dip into it. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs\r\nand the work produced is an oxidation. The white sheet supplies the\r\noxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush\r\ndistributes the flow of air over it. There remains the question of the\r\nsubstance whereof this sheet is formed. The first suggestion was\r\nphosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word. The Glow-worm was\r\ncalcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the simple\r\nsubstances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has obtained a\r\nsatisfactory answer along these lines. Phosphorus seems to play no part\r\nhere, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is sometimes\r\nbestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam. The answer lies elsewhere, no one\r\nknows where.\r\n\r\nWe are better-informed as regards another question. Has the Glow-worm a\r\nfree control of the light which he emits? Can he turn it on or down or\r\nput it out as he pleases? Has he an opaque screen which is drawn over\r\nthe flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed? There is no\r\nneed for any such mechanism: the insect has something better for its\r\nrevolving light.\r\n\r\nThe thick air-tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the\r\nflow of air and the light is intensified; the same tube, swayed by the\r\nanimal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the\r\nlight grows fainter or even goes out. It is, in short, the mechanism of\r\na lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.\r\n\r\nExcitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion. We must here\r\ndistinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the\r\nexclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the\r\nmodest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any\r\nage. In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden\r\nand complete, or nearly so. In my nocturnal hunts for young Glow-worms,\r\nmeasuring about 5 millimetres long (.195 inch.--Translator's Note.), I\r\ncan plainly see the glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the\r\nleast false step disturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at\r\nonce and the coveted insect becomes invisible. Upon the full-grown\r\nfemales, lit up with their nuptial scarves, even a violent start has\r\nbut a slight effect and often none at all.\r\n\r\nI fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my\r\nmenagerie of females in the open air. The explosion produces no result.\r\nThe illumination continues, as bright and placid as before. I take a\r\nspray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the flock. Not\r\none of my animals puts out its light; at the very most, there is a\r\nbrief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases. I send a puff\r\nof smoke from my pipe into the cage. This time the pause is more\r\nmarked. There are even some extinctions, but these do not last long.\r\nCalm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly as ever. I take\r\nsome of the captives in my fingers, turn and return them, tease them a\r\nlittle. The illumination continues and is not much diminished, if I do\r\nnot press hard with my thumb. At this period, with the pairing close at\r\nhand, the insect is in all the fervour of its passionate splendour, and\r\nnothing short of very serious reasons would make it put out its signals\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm\r\nhimself manages his lighting apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling it\r\nat will; but there is one point at which the voluntary agency of the\r\ninsect is without effect. I detach a strip of the epidermis showing one\r\nof the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube, which I close\r\nwith a plug of damp wadding, to avoid an over-rapid evaporation. Well,\r\nthis scrap of carcass shines away merrily, although not quite as\r\nbrilliantly as on the living body.\r\n\r\nLife's aid is now superfluous. The oxidizable substance, the\r\nluminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding\r\natmosphere; the flow of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;\r\nand the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as\r\nwhen it is produced by the contact of the air with the real phosphorus\r\nof the chemists. Let us add that, in aerated water, the luminousness\r\ncontinues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it is extinguished\r\nin water deprived of its air by boiling. No better proof could be found\r\nof what I have already propounded, namely, that the Glow-worm's light\r\nis the effect of a slow oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark\r\ndropped by the full moon. Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble\r\nilluminant. If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect\r\ndarkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, and even\r\nwords, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible beyond\r\na narrow zone. A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's patience.\r\n\r\nSuppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another. Each\r\nof them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to light up\r\nits neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each individual\r\nspecimen. But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in which our\r\neyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a medium distance.\r\nThe collective lights confuse the light-bearers into one vague whole.\r\n\r\nPhotography gives us a striking proof of this. I have a score of\r\nfemales, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage in\r\nthe open air. A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their\r\nestablishment. When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle\r\nand strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at\r\nevery point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous\r\nclusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the\r\nphotographer's plates and paper. My hopes were disappointed. All that I\r\nobtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense there\r\naccording to the numbers forming the group. There is no picture of the\r\nGlow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of thyme. For\r\nwant of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is represented by a\r\nblurred splash of white on a black ground.\r\n\r\nThe beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,\r\ninvitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the\r\nlower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the summoned\r\nmales, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel overhead, in the\r\nair, sometimes a great way up. In its normal position, therefore, the\r\nglittering lure is concealed from the eyes of those concerned; it is\r\ncovered by the thick bulk of the bride. The lantern ought really to\r\ngleam on the back and not under the belly; otherwise the light is\r\nhidden under a bushel.\r\n\r\nThe anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every female\r\nhas her little wiles of coquetry. At nightfall, every evening, my caged\r\ncaptives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have thoughtfully\r\nfurnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper branches, those\r\nmost in sight. Here, instead of keeping quiet, as they did at the foot\r\nof the bush just now, they indulge in violent exercises, twist the tip\r\nof their very flexible abdomen, turn it to one side, turn it to the\r\nother, jerk it in every direction. In this way, the searchlight cannot\r\nfail to gleam, at one moment or another, before the eyes of every male\r\nwho goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood, whether on the ground or in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIt is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching\r\nLarks. If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird\r\nindifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it\r\nexcites it.\r\n\r\nWhile the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains, the\r\nmale, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited to\r\ncatch from afar the least reflection of the calling signal. His\r\ncorselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in\r\nthe form of a peaked cap or a shade, the object of which appears to be\r\nto limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the luminous\r\nspeck to be discerned. Under this arch are the two eyes, which are\r\nrelatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a skull-cap and\r\ncontiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow groove for the\r\ninsertion of the antennae. This double eye, occupying almost the whole\r\nface of the insect and contained in the cavern formed by the spreading\r\npeak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclops' eye.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the pairing the illumination becomes much fainter, is\r\nalmost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble fairy-lamp\r\nof the last segment. This discreet night-light is enough for the\r\nwedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects, lingering\r\nover their respective affairs, murmur the universal marriage-hymn. The\r\nlaying follows very soon. The round, white eggs are laid, or rather\r\nstrewn at random, without the least care on the mother's part, either\r\non the more or less cool earth or on a blade of grass. These brilliant\r\nones know nothing at all of family affection.\r\n\r\nHere is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even\r\nwhen still contained in the mother's womb. If I happen by accident to\r\ncrush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny\r\nstreak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel filled\r\nwith a phosphorescent fluid. The lens shows me that I am wrong. The\r\nluminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of the ovary.\r\nBesides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of the eggs is\r\nalready made manifest through this clumsy midwifery. A soft opalescent\r\nlight shines through the integument of the belly.\r\n\r\nThe hatching follows soon after the laying. The young of either sex\r\nhave two little rush-lights on the last segment. At the approach of the\r\nsevere weather they go down into the ground, but not very far. In my\r\nrearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose earth, they\r\ndescend to a depth of three or four inches at most. I dig up a few in\r\nmid-winter. I always find them carrying their faint stern-light. About\r\nthe month of April they come up again to the surface, there to continue\r\nand complete their evolution.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of light.\r\nThe eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise. The full-grown females are\r\nmagnificent lighthouses, the adult males retain the glimmer which the\r\ngrubs already possessed. We can understand the object of the feminine\r\nbeacon; but of what use is all the rest of the pyrotechnic display? To\r\nmy great regret, I cannot tell. It is and will be, for many a day to\r\ncome, perhaps for all time, the secret of animal physics, which is\r\ndeeper than the physics of the books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. THE CABBAGE-CATERPILLAR.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage of our modern kitchen-gardens is a semi-artificial plant,\r\nthe produce of our agricultural ingenuity quite as much as of the\r\nniggardly gifts of nature. Spontaneous vegetation supplied us with the\r\nlong-stalked, scanty-leaved, ill-smelling wilding, as found, according\r\nto the botanists, on the ocean cliffs. He had need of a rare\r\ninspiration who first showed faith in this rustic clown and proposed to\r\nimprove it in his garden-patch.\r\n\r\nProgressing by infinitesimal degrees, culture wrought miracles. It\r\nbegan by persuading the wild cabbage to discard its wretched leaves,\r\nbeaten by the sea-winds, and to replace them by others, ample and\r\nfleshy and close-fitting. The gentle cabbage submitted without protest.\r\nIt deprived itself of the joys of light by arranging its leaves in a\r\nlarge compact head, white and tender. In our day, among the successors\r\nof those first tiny hearts, are some that, by virtue of their massive\r\nbulk, have earned the glorious name of chou quintal, as who should say\r\na hundredweight of cabbage. They are real monuments of green stuff.\r\n\r\nLater, man thought of obtaining a generous dish with a thousand little\r\nsprays of the inflorescence. The cabbage consented. Under the cover of\r\nthe central leaves, it gorged with food its sheaves of blossom, its\r\nflower-stalks, its branches and worked the lot into a fleshy\r\nconglomeration. This is the cauliflower, the broccoli.\r\n\r\nDifferently entreated, the plant, economizing in the centre of its\r\nshoot, set a whole family of close-wrapped cabbages ladder-wise on a\r\ntall stem. A multitude of dwarf leaf-buds took the place of the\r\ncolossal head. This is the Brussels sprout.\r\n\r\nNext comes the turn of the stump, an unprofitable, almost wooden,\r\nthing, which seemed never to have any other purpose than to act as a\r\nsupport for the plant. But the tricks of gardeners are capable of\r\neverything, so much so that the stalk yields to the grower's\r\nsuggestions and becomes fleshy and swells into an ellipse similar to\r\nthe turnip, of which it possesses all the merits of corpulence, flavour\r\nand delicacy; only the strange product serves as a base for a few\r\nsparse leaves, the last protests of a real stem that refuses to lose\r\nits attributes entirely. This is the cole-rape.\r\n\r\nIf the stem allows itself to be allured, why not the root? It does, in\r\nfact, yield to the blandishments of agriculture: it dilates its pivot\r\ninto a flat turnip, which half emerges from the ground. This is the\r\nrutabaga, or swede, the turnip-cabbage of our northern districts.\r\n\r\nIncomparably docile under our nursing, the cabbage has given its all\r\nfor our nourishment and that of our cattle: its leaves, its flowers,\r\nits buds, its stalk, its root; all that it now wants is to combine the\r\nornamental with the useful, to smarten itself, to adorn our flowerbeds\r\nand cut a good figure on a drawing-room table. It has done this to\r\nperfection, not with its flowers, which, in their modesty, continue\r\nintractable, but with its curly and variegated leaves, which have the\r\nundulating grace of Ostrich-feathers and the rich colouring of a mixed\r\nbouquet. None who beholds it in this magnificence will recognize the\r\nnear relation of the vulgar \"greens\" that form the basis of our\r\ncabbage-soup.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage, first in order of date in our kitchen-gardens, was held in\r\nhigh esteem by classic antiquity, next after the bean and, later, the\r\npea; but it goes much farther back, so far indeed that no memories of\r\nits acquisition remain. History pays but little attention to these\r\ndetails: it celebrates the battle-fields whereon we meet our death, but\r\nscorns to speak of the ploughed fields whereby we thrive; it knows the\r\nnames of the kings' bastards, but cannot tell us the origin of wheat.\r\nThat is the way of human folly.\r\n\r\nThis silence respecting the precious plants that serve as food is most\r\nregrettable. The cabbage in particular, the venerable cabbage, that\r\ndenizen of the most ancient garden-plots, would have had extremely\r\ninteresting things to teach us. It is a treasure in itself, but a\r\ntreasure twice exploited, first by man and next by the caterpillar of\r\nthe Pieris, the common Large White Butterfly whom we all know (Pieris\r\nbrassicae, Lin.). This caterpillar feeds indiscriminately on the leaves\r\nof all varieties of cabbage, however dissimilar in appearance: he\r\nnibbles with the same appetite red cabbage and broccoli, curly greens\r\nand savoy, swedes and turnip-tops, in short, all that our ingenuity,\r\nlavish of time and patience, has been able to obtain from the original\r\nplant since the most distant ages.\r\n\r\nBut what did the caterpillar eat before our cabbages supplied him with\r\ncopious provender? Obviously the Pieris did not wait for the advent of\r\nman and his horticultural works in order to take part in the joys of\r\nlife. She lived without us and would have continued to live without us.\r\nA Butterfly's existence is not subject to ours, but rightfully\r\nindependent of our aid.\r\n\r\nBefore the white-heart, the cauliflower, the savoy and the others were\r\ninvented, the Pieris' caterpillar certainly did not lack food: he\r\nbrowsed on the wild cabbage of the cliffs, the parent of all the\r\nlatter-day wealth; but, as this plant is not widely distributed and is,\r\nin any case, limited to certain maritime regions, the welfare of the\r\nButterfly, whether on plain or hill, demanded a more luxuriant and more\r\ncommon plant for pasturage. This plant was apparently one of the\r\nCruciferae, more or less seasoned with sulpheretted essence, like the\r\ncabbages. Let us experiment on these lines.\r\n\r\nI rear the Pieris' caterpillars from the egg upwards on the wall-rocket\r\n(Diplotaxis tenuifolia, Dec.), which imbibes strong spices along the\r\nedge of the paths and at the foot of the walls. Penned in a large\r\nwire-gauze bell-cage, they accept this provender without demur; they\r\nnibble it with the same appetite as if it were cabbage; and they end by\r\nproducing chrysalids and Butterflies. The change of fare causes not the\r\nleast trouble.\r\n\r\nI am equally successful with other crucifers of a less marked flavour:\r\nwhite mustard (Sinapis incana, Lin.), dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria,\r\nLin.), wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum, Lin.), whitlow pepperwort\r\n(Lepidium draba, Lin.), hedge-mustard (Sisymbrium officinale, Scop.).\r\nOn the other hand, the leaves of the lettuce, the bean, the pea, the\r\ncorn-salad are obstinately refused. Let us be content with what we have\r\nseen: the fare has been sufficiently varied to show us that the\r\ncabbage-caterpillar feeds exclusively on a large number of crucifers,\r\nperhaps even on all.\r\n\r\nAs these experiments are made in the enclosure of a bell-cage, one\r\nmight imagine that captivity impels the flock to feed, in the absence\r\nof better things, on what it would refuse were it free to hunt for\r\nitself. Having naught else within their reach, the starvelings consume\r\nany and all Cruciferae, without distinction of species. Can things\r\nsometimes be the same in the open fields, where I play none of my\r\ntricks? Can the family of the White Butterfly be settled on other\r\nCrucifers than the cabbage? I start a quest along the paths near the\r\ngardens and end by finding on wild radish and white mustard colonies as\r\ncrowded and prosperous as those established on cabbage.\r\n\r\nNow, except when the metamorphosis is at hand, the caterpillar of the\r\nWhite Butterfly never travels: he does all his growing on the identical\r\nplant whereon he saw the light. The caterpillars observed on the wild\r\nradish, as well as other households, are not, therefore, emigrants who\r\nhave come as a matter of fancy from some cabbage-patch in the\r\nneighbourhood: they have hatched on the very leaves where I find them.\r\nHence I arrive at this conclusion: the White Butterfly, who is fitful\r\nin her flight, chooses cabbage first, to dab her eggs upon, and\r\ndifferent Cruciferae next, varying greatly in appearance.\r\n\r\nHow does the Pieris manage to know her way about her botanical domain?\r\nWe have seen the Larini (A species of Weevils found on\r\nthistle-heads.--Translator's Note.), those explorers of fleshy\r\nreceptacles with an artichoke flavour, astonish us with their knowledge\r\nof the flora of the thistle tribe; but their lore might, at a pinch, be\r\nexplained by the method followed at the moment of housing the egg. With\r\ntheir rostrum, they prepare niches and dig out basins in the receptacle\r\nexploited and consequently they taste the thing a little before\r\nentrusting their eggs to it. On the other hand, the Butterfly, a\r\nnectar-drinker, makes not the least enquiry into the savoury qualities\r\nof the leafage; at most dipping her proboscis into the flowers, she\r\nabstracts a mouthful of syrup. This means of investigation, moreover,\r\nwould be of no use to her, for the plant selected for the establishing\r\nof her family is, for the most part, not yet in flower. The mother\r\nflits for a moment around the plant; and that swift examination is\r\nenough: the emission of eggs takes place if the provender be found\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\nThe botanist, to recognize a crucifer, requires the indication provided\r\nby the flower. Here the Pieris surpasses us. She does not consult the\r\nseed-vessel, to see if it be long or short, nor yet the petals, four in\r\nnumber and arranged in a cross, because the plant, as a rule, is not in\r\nflower; and still she recognizes offhand what suits her caterpillars,\r\nin spite of profound differences that would embarrass any but a\r\nbotanical expert.\r\n\r\nUnless the Pieris has an innate power of discrimination to guide her,\r\nit is impossible to understand the great extent of her vegetable realm.\r\nShe needs for her family Cruciferae, nothing but Cruciferae; and she\r\nknows this group of plants to perfection. I have been an enthusiastic\r\nbotanist for half a century and more. Nevertheless, to discover if this\r\nor that plant, new to me, is or is not one of the Cruciferae, in the\r\nabsence of flowers and fruits I should have more faith in the\r\nButterfly's statements than in all the learned records of the books.\r\nWhere science is apt to make mistakes instinct is infallible.\r\n\r\nThe Pieris has two families a year: one in April and May, the other in\r\nSeptember. The cabbage-patches are renewed in those same months. The\r\nButterfly's calendar tallies with the gardener's: the moment that\r\nprovisions are in sight, consumers are forthcoming for the feast.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are a bright orange-yellow and do not lack prettiness when\r\nexamined under the lens. They are blunted cones, ranged side by side on\r\ntheir round base and adorned with finely-scored longitudinal ridges.\r\nThey are collected in slabs, sometimes on the upper surface, when the\r\nleaf that serves as a support is spread wide, sometimes on the lower\r\nsurface when the leaf is pressed to the next ones. Their number varies\r\nconsiderably. Slabs of a couple of hundred are pretty frequent;\r\nisolated eggs, or eggs collected in small groups, are, on the contrary,\r\nrare. The mother's output is affected by the degree of quietness at the\r\nmoment of laying.\r\n\r\nThe outer circumference of the group is irregularly formed, but the\r\ninside presents a certain order. The eggs are here arranged in straight\r\nrows backing against one another in such a way that each egg finds a\r\ndouble support in the preceding row. This alternation, without being of\r\nan irreproachable precision, gives a fairly stable equilibrium to the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nTo see the mother at her laying is no easy matter: when examined too\r\nclosely, the Pieris decamps at once. The structure of the work,\r\nhowever, reveals the order of the operations pretty clearly. The\r\novipositor swings slowly first in this direction, then in that, by\r\nturns; and a new egg is lodged in each space between two adjoining eggs\r\nin the previous row. The extent of the oscillation determines the\r\nlength of the row, which is longer or shorter according to the layer's\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\nThe hatching takes place in about a week. It is almost simultaneous for\r\nthe whole mass: as soon as one caterpillar comes out of its egg, the\r\nothers come out also, as though the natal impulse were communicated\r\nfrom one to the other. In the same way, in the nest of the Praying\r\nMantis, a warning seems to be spread abroad, arousing every one of the\r\npopulation. It is a wave propagated in all directions from the point\r\nfirst struck.\r\n\r\nThe egg does not open by means of a dehiscence similar to that of the\r\nvegetable-pods whose seeds have attained maturity; it is the new-born\r\ngrub itself that contrives an exit-way by gnawing a hole in its\r\nenclosure. In this manner, it obtains near the top of the cone a\r\nsymmetrical dormer-window, clean-edged, with no joins nor unevenness of\r\nany kind, showing that this part of the wall has been nibbled away and\r\nswallowed. But for this breach, which is just wide enough for the\r\ndeliverance, the egg remains intact, standing firmly on its base. It is\r\nnow that the lens is best able to take in its elegant structure. What\r\nit sees is a bag made of ultra-fine gold-beater's skin, translucent,\r\nstiff and white, retaining the complete form of the original egg. A\r\nscore of streaked and knotted lines run from the top to the base. It is\r\nthe wizard's pointed cap, the mitre with the grooves carved into\r\njewelled chaplets. All said, the Cabbage-caterpillar's birth-casket is\r\nan exquisite work of art.\r\n\r\nThe hatching of the lot is finished in a couple of hours and the\r\nswarming family musters on the layer of swaddling-clothes, still in the\r\nsame position. For a long time, before descending to the fostering\r\nleaf, it lingers on this kind of hot-bed, is even very busy there. Busy\r\nwith what? It is browsing a strange kind of grass, the handsome mitres\r\nthat remain standing on end. Slowly and methodically, from top to base,\r\nthe new-born grubs nibble the wallets whence they have just emerged. By\r\nto-morrow, nothing is left of these but a pattern of round dots, the\r\nbases of the vanished sacks.\r\n\r\nAs his first mouthfuls, therefore, the Cabbage-caterpillar eats the\r\nmembranous wrapper of his egg. This is a regulation diet, for I have\r\nnever seen one of the little grubs allow itself to be tempted by the\r\nadjacent green stuff before finishing the ritual repast whereat skin\r\nbottles furnish forth the feast. It is the first time that I have seen\r\na larva make a meal of the sack in which it was born. Of what use can\r\nthis singular fare be to the budding caterpillar? I suspect as follows:\r\nthe leaves of the cabbage are waxed and slippery surfaces and nearly\r\nalways slant considerably. To graze on them without risking a fall,\r\nwhich would be fatal in earliest childhood, is hardly possible unless\r\nwith moorings that afford a steady support. What is needed is bits of\r\nsilk stretched along the road as fast as progress is made, something\r\nfor the legs to grip, something to provide a good anchorage even when\r\nthe grub is upside down. The silk-tubes, where those moorings are\r\nmanufactured, must be very scantily supplied in a tiny, new-born\r\nanimal; and it is expedient that they be filled without delay with the\r\naid of a special form of nourishment. Then what shall the nature of the\r\nfirst food be? Vegetable matter, slow to elaborate and niggardly in its\r\nyield, does not fulfil the desired conditions at all well, for time\r\npresses and we must trust ourselves safely to the slippery leaf. An\r\nanimal diet would be preferable: it is easier to digest and undergoes\r\nchemical changes in a shorter time. The wrapper of the egg is of a\r\nhorny nature, as silk itself is. It will not take long to transform the\r\none into the other. The grub therefore tackles the remains of its egg\r\nand turns it into silk to carry with it on its first journeys.\r\n\r\nIf my surmise is well-founded, there is reason to believe that, with a\r\nview to speedily filling the silk-glands to which they look to supply\r\nthem with ropes, other caterpillars beginning their existence on smooth\r\nand steeply-slanting leaves also take as their first mouthful the\r\nmembranous sack which is all that remains of the egg.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the platform of birth-sacks which was the first\r\ncamping-ground of the White Butterfly's family is razed to the ground;\r\nnaught remains but the round marks of the individual pieces that\r\ncomposed it. The structure of piles has disappeared; the prints left by\r\nthe piles remain. The little caterpillars are now on the level of the\r\nleaf which shall henceforth feed them. They are a pale orange-yellow,\r\nwith a sprinkling of white bristles. The head is a shiny black and\r\nremarkably powerful; it already gives signs of the coming gluttony. The\r\nlittle animal measures scarcely two millimetres in length. (.078\r\ninch.--Translator's Note.)\r\n\r\nThe troop begins its steadying-work as soon as it comes into contact\r\nwith its pasturage, the green cabbage-leaf. Here, there, in its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, each grub emits from its spinning glands short\r\ncables so slender that it takes an attentive lens to catch a glimpse of\r\nthem. This is enough to ensure the equilibrium of the almost\r\nimponderable atom.\r\n\r\nThe vegetarian meal now begins. The grub's length promptly increases\r\nfrom two millimetres to four. Soon, a moult takes place which alters\r\nits costume: its skin becomes speckled, on a pale-yellow ground, with a\r\nnumber of black dots intermingled with white bristles. Three or four\r\ndays of rest are necessary after the fatigue of breaking cover. When\r\nthis is over, the hunger-fit starts that will make a ruin of the\r\ncabbage within a few weeks.\r\n\r\nWhat an appetite! What a stomach, working continuously day and night!\r\nIt is a devouring laboratory, through which the foodstuffs merely pass,\r\ntransformed at once. I serve up to my caged herd a bunch of leaves\r\npicked from among the biggest: two hours later, nothing remains but the\r\nthick midribs; and even these are attacked when there is any delay in\r\nrenewing the victuals. At this rate a \"hundredweight-cabbage,\" doled\r\nout leaf by leaf, would not last my menagerie a week.\r\n\r\nThe gluttonous animal, therefore, when it swarms and multiplies, is a\r\nscourge. How are we to protect our gardens against it? In the days of\r\nPliny, the great Latin naturalist, a stake was set up in the middle of\r\nthe cabbage-bed to be preserved; and on this stake was fixed a Horse's\r\nskull bleached in the sun: a Mare's skull was considered even better.\r\nThis sort of bogey was supposed to ward off the devouring brood.\r\n\r\nMy confidence in this preservative is but an indifferent one; my reason\r\nfor mentioning it is that it reminds me of a custom still observed in\r\nour own days, at least in my part of the country. Nothing is so\r\nlong-lived as absurdity. Tradition has retained in a simplified form,\r\nthe ancient defensive apparatus of which Pliny speaks. For the Horse's\r\nskull our people have substituted an egg-shell on the top of a switch\r\nstuck among the cabbages. It is easier to arrange; also it is quite as\r\nuseful, that is to say, it has no effect whatever.\r\n\r\nEverything, even the nonsensical, is capable of explanation with a\r\nlittle credulity. When I question the peasants, our neighbours, they\r\ntell me that the effect of the egg-shell is as simple as can be: the\r\nButterflies, attracted by the whiteness, come and lay their eggs upon\r\nit. Broiled by the sun and lacking all nourishment on that thankless\r\nsupport, the little caterpillars die; and that makes so many fewer.\r\n\r\nI insist; I ask them if they have ever seen slabs of eggs or masses of\r\nyoung caterpillars on those white shells.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" they reply, with one voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was done in the old days and so we go on doing it: that's all we\r\nknow; and that's enough for us.\"\r\n\r\nI leave it at that, persuaded that the memory of the Horse's skull,\r\nused once upon a time, is ineradicable, like all the rustic absurdities\r\nimplanted by the ages.\r\n\r\nWe have, when all is said, but one means of protection, which is to\r\nwatch and inspect the cabbage-leaves assiduously and crush the slabs of\r\neggs between our finger and thumb and the caterpillars with our feet.\r\nNothing is so effective as this method, which makes great demands on\r\none's time and vigilance. What pains to obtain an unspoilt cabbage! And\r\nwhat a debt do we not owe to those humble scrapers of the soil, those\r\nragged heroes, who provide us with the wherewithal to live!\r\n\r\nTo eat and digest, to accumulate reserves whence the Butterfly will\r\nissue: that is the caterpillar's one and only business. The\r\nCabbage-caterpillar performs it with insatiable gluttony. Incessantly\r\nit browses, incessantly digests: the supreme felicity of an animal\r\nwhich is little more than an intestine. There is never a distraction,\r\nunless it be certain see-saw movements which are particularly curious\r\nwhen several caterpillars are grazing side by side, abreast. Then, at\r\nintervals, all the heads in the row are briskly lifted and as briskly\r\nlowered, time after time, with an automatic precision worthy of a\r\nPrussian drill-ground. Can it be their method of intimidating an always\r\npossible aggressor? Can it be a manifestation of gaiety, when the\r\nwanton sun warms their full paunches? Whether sign of fear or sign of\r\nbliss, this is the only exercise that the gluttons allow themselves\r\nuntil the proper degree of plumpness is attained.\r\n\r\nAfter a month's grazing, the voracious appetite of my caged herd is\r\nassuaged. The caterpillars climb the trelliswork in every direction,\r\nwalk about anyhow, with their forepart raised and searching space. Here\r\nand there, as they pass, the swaying herd put forth a thread. They\r\nwander restlessly, anxiously to travel afar. The exodus now prevented\r\nby the trellised enclosure I once saw under excellent conditions. At\r\nthe advent of the cold weather, I had placed a few cabbage-stalks,\r\ncovered with caterpillars, in a small greenhouse. Those who saw the\r\ncommon kitchen vegetable sumptuously lodged under glass, in the company\r\nof the pelargonium and the Chinese primrose, were astonished at my\r\ncurious fancy. I let them smile. I had my plans: I wanted to find out\r\nhow the family of the Large White Butterfly behaves when the cold\r\nweather sets in. Things happened just as I wished. At the end of\r\nNovember, the caterpillars, having grown to the desired extent, left\r\nthe cabbages, one by one, and began to roam about the walls. None of\r\nthem fixed himself there or made preparations for the transformation. I\r\nsuspected that they wanted the choice of a spot in the open air,\r\nexposed to all the rigours of winter. I therefore left the door of the\r\nhothouse open. Soon the whole crowd had disappeared.\r\n\r\nI found them dispersed all over the neighbouring walls, some thirty\r\nyards off. The thrust of a ledge, the eaves formed by a projecting bit\r\nof mortar served them as a shelter where the chrysalid moult took place\r\nand where the winter was passed. The Cabbage-caterpillar possesses a\r\nrobust constitution, unsusceptible to torrid heat or icy cold. All that\r\nhe needs for his metamorphosis is an airy lodging, free from permanent\r\ndamp.\r\n\r\nThe inmates of my fold, therefore, move about for a few days on the\r\ntrelliswork, anxious to travel afar in search of a wall. Finding none\r\nand realizing that time presses, they resign themselves. Each one,\r\nsupporting himself on the trellis, first weaves around himself a thin\r\ncarpet of white silk, which will form the sustaining layer at the time\r\nof the laborious and delicate work of the nymphosis. He fixes his\r\nrear-end to this base by a silk pad and his fore-part by a strap that\r\npasses under his shoulders and is fixed on either side to the carpet.\r\nThus slung from his three fastenings, he strips himself of his larval\r\napparel and turns into a chrysalis in the open air, with no protection\r\nsave that of the wall, which the caterpillar would certainly have found\r\nhad I not interfered.\r\n\r\nOf a surety, he would be short-sighted indeed that pictured a world of\r\ngood things prepared exclusively for our advantage. The earth, the\r\ngreat foster-mother, has a generous breast. At the very moment when\r\nnourishing matter is created, even though it be with our own zealous\r\naid, she summons to the feast host upon host of consumers, who are all\r\nthe more numerous and enterprising in proportion as the table is more\r\namply spread. The cherry of our orchards is excellent eating: a maggot\r\ncontends with us for its possession. In vain do we weigh suns and\r\nplanets: our supremacy, which fathoms the universe, cannot prevent a\r\nwretched worm from levying its toll on the delicious fruit. We make\r\nourselves at home in a cabbage bed: the sons of the Pieris make\r\nthemselves at home there too. Preferring broccoli to wild radish, they\r\nprofit where we have profited; and we have no remedy against their\r\ncompetition save caterpillar-raids and egg-crushing, a thankless,\r\ntedious, and none too efficacious work.\r\n\r\nEvery creature has its claims on life. The Cabbage-caterpillar eagerly\r\nputs forth his own, so much so that the cultivation of the precious\r\nplant would be endangered if others concerned did not take part in its\r\ndefence. These others are the auxiliaries (The author employs this word\r\nto denote the insects that are helpful, while describing as \"ravagers\"\r\nthe insects that are hurtful to the farmer's crops.--Translator's\r\nNote.), our helpers from necessity and not from sympathy. The words\r\nfriend and foe, auxiliaries and ravagers are here the mere conventions\r\nof a language not always adapted to render the exact truth. He is our\r\nfoe who eats or attacks our crops; our friend is he who feeds upon our\r\nfoes. Everything is reduced to a frenzied contest of appetites.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the might that is mine, of trickery, of highway robbery,\r\nclear out of that, you, and make room for me: give me your seat at the\r\nbanquet! That is the inexorable law in the world of animals and more or\r\nless, alas, in our own world as well!\r\n\r\nNow, among our entomological auxiliaries, the smallest in size are the\r\nbest at their work. One of them is charged with watching over the\r\ncabbages. She is so small, she works so discreetly that the gardener\r\ndoes not know her, has not even heard of her. Were he to see her by\r\naccident, flitting around the plant which she protects, he would take\r\nno notice of her, would not suspect the service rendered. I propose to\r\nset forth the tiny midget's deserts.\r\n\r\nScientists call her Microgaster glomeratus. What exactly was in the\r\nmind of the author of the name Microgaster, which means little belly?\r\nDid he intend to allude to the insignificance of the abdomen? Not so.\r\nHowever slight the belly may be, the insect nevertheless possesses one,\r\ncorrectly proportioned to the rest of the body, so that the classic\r\ndenomination, far from giving us any information, might mislead us,\r\nwere we to trust it wholly. Nomenclature, which changes from day to day\r\nand becomes more and more cacophonous, is an unsafe guide. Instead of\r\nasking the animal what its name is, let us begin by asking:\r\n\r\n\"What can you do? What is your business?\"\r\n\r\nWell, the Microgaster's business is to exploit the Cabbage-caterpillar,\r\na clearly-defined business, admitting of no possible confusion. Would\r\nwe behold her works? In the spring, let us inspect the neighbourhood of\r\nthe kitchen-garden. Be our eye never so unobservant, we shall notice\r\nagainst the walls or on the withered grasses at the foot of the hedges\r\nsome very small yellow cocoons, heaped into masses the size of a\r\nhazel-nut.\r\n\r\nBeside each group lies a Cabbage-caterpillar, sometimes dying,\r\nsometimes dead, and always presenting a most tattered appearance. These\r\ncocoons are the work of the Microgaster's family, hatched or on the\r\npoint of hatching into the perfect stage; the caterpillar is the dish\r\nwhereon that family has fed during its larval state. The epithet\r\nglomeratus, which accompanies the name of Microgaster, suggests this\r\nconglomeration of cocoons. Let us collect the clusters as they are,\r\nwithout seeking to separate them, an operation which would demand both\r\npatience and dexterity, for the cocoons are closely united by the\r\ninextricable tangle of their surface-threads. In May a swarm of pigmies\r\nwill sally forth, ready to get to business in the cabbages.\r\n\r\nColloquial language uses the terms Midge and Gnat to describe the tiny\r\ninsects which we often see dancing in a ray of sunlight. There is\r\nsomething of everything in those aerial ballets. It is possible that\r\nthe persecutrix of the Cabbage-caterpillar is there, along with many\r\nanother; but the name of Midge cannot properly be applied to her. He\r\nwho says Midge says Fly, Dipteron, two-winged insect; and our friend\r\nhas four wings, one and all adapted for flying. By virtue of this\r\ncharacteristic and others no less important, she belongs to the order\r\nof Hymenoptera. (This order includes the Ichneumon-flies, of whom the\r\nMicrogaster is one.--Translator's Note.) No matter: as our language\r\npossesses no more precise term outside the scientific vocabulary, let\r\nus use the expression Midge, which pretty well conveys the general\r\nidea. Our Midge, the Microgaster, is the size of an average Gnat. She\r\nmeasures 3 or 4 millimetres. (.117 to .156 inch.--Translator's Note.)\r\nThe two sexes are equally numerous and wear the same costume, a black\r\nuniform, all but the legs, which are pale red. In spite of this\r\nlikeness, they are easily distinguished. The male has an abdomen which\r\nis slightly flattened and, moreover, curved at the tip; the female,\r\nbefore the laying, has hers full and perceptibly distended by its\r\novular contents. This rapid sketch of the insect should be enough for\r\nour purpose.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to know the grub and especially to inform ourselves of its\r\nmanner of living, it is advisable to rear in a cage a numerous herd of\r\nCabbage-caterpillars. Whereas a direct search on the cabbages in our\r\ngarden would give us but a difficult and uncertain harvest, by this\r\nmeans we shall daily have as many as we wish before our eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the course of June, which is the time when the caterpillars quit\r\ntheir pastures and go far afield to settle on some wall or other, those\r\nin my fold, finding nothing better, climb to the dome of the cage to\r\nmake their preparations and to spin a supporting network for the\r\nchrysalid's needs. Among these spinners we see some weaklings working\r\nlistlessly at their carpet. Their appearance makes us deem them in the\r\ngrip of a mortal disease. I take a few of them and open their bellies,\r\nusing a needle by way of a scalpel. What comes out is a bunch of green\r\nentrails, soaked in a bright yellow fluid, which is really the\r\ncreature's blood. These tangled intestines swarm with little lazy\r\ngrubs, varying greatly in number, from ten or twenty at least to\r\nsometimes half a hundred. They are the offspring of the Microgaster.\r\n\r\nWhat do they feed on? The lens makes conscientious enquiries; nowhere\r\ndoes it manage to show me the vermin attacking solid nourishment, fatty\r\ntissues, muscles or other parts; nowhere do I see them bite, gnaw, or\r\ndissect. The following experiment will tell us more fully: I pour into\r\na watch-glass the crowds extracted from the hospitable paunches. I\r\nflood them with caterpillar's blood obtained by simple pricks; I place\r\nthe preparation under a glass bell-jar, in a moist atmosphere, to\r\nprevent evaporation; I repeat the nourishing bath by means of fresh\r\nbleedings and give them the stimulant which they would have gained from\r\nthe living caterpillar. Thanks to these precautions, my charges have\r\nall the appearance of excellent health; they drink and thrive. But this\r\nstate of things cannot last long. Soon ripe for the transformation, my\r\ngrubs leave the dining-room of the watch-glass as they would have left\r\nthe caterpillar's belly; they come to the ground to try and weave their\r\ntiny cocoons. They fail in the attempt and perish. They have missed a\r\nsuitable support, that is to say, the silky carpet provided by the\r\ndying caterpillar. No matter: I have seen enough to convince me. The\r\nlarvae of the Microgaster do not eat in the strict sense of the word;\r\nthey live on soup; and that soup is the caterpillar's blood.\r\n\r\nExamine the parasites closely and you shall see that their diet is\r\nbound to be a liquid one. They are little white grubs, neatly\r\nsegmented, with a pointed forepart splashed with tiny black marks, as\r\nthough the atom had been slaking its thirst in a drop of ink. It moves\r\nits hind-quarters slowly, without shifting its position. I place it\r\nunder the microscope. The mouth is a pore, devoid of any apparatus for\r\ndisintegration-work: it has no fangs, no horny nippers, no mandibles;\r\nits attack is just a kiss. It does not chew, it sucks, it takes\r\ndiscreet sips at the moisture all around it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it refrains entirely from biting is confirmed by my\r\nautopsy of the stricken caterpillars. In the patient's belly,\r\nnotwithstanding the number of nurselings who hardly leave room for the\r\nnurse's entrails, everything is in perfect order; nowhere do we see a\r\ntrace of mutilation. Nor does aught on the outside betray any havoc\r\nwithin. The exploited caterpillars graze and move about peacefully,\r\ngiving no sign of pain. It is impossible for me to distinguish them\r\nfrom the unscathed ones in respect of appetite and untroubled\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nWhen the time approaches to weave the carpet for the support of the\r\nchrysalis, an appearance of emaciation at last points to the evil that\r\nis at their vitals. They spin nevertheless. They are stoics who do not\r\nforget their duty in the hour of death. At last they expire, quite\r\nsoftly, not of any wounds, but of anaemia, even as a lamp goes out when\r\nthe oil comes to an end. And it has to be. The living caterpillar,\r\ncapable of feeding himself and forming blood, is a necessity for the\r\nwelfare of the grubs; he has to last about a month, until the\r\nMicrogaster's offspring have achieved their full growth. The two\r\ncalendars synchronize in a remarkable way. When the caterpillar leaves\r\noff eating and makes his preparations for the metamorphosis, the\r\nparasites are ripe for the exodus. The bottle dries up when the\r\ndrinkers cease to need it; but until that moment it must remain more or\r\nless well-filled, although becoming limper daily. It is important,\r\ntherefore, that the caterpillar's existence be not endangered by wounds\r\nwhich, even though very tiny, would stop the working of the\r\nblood-fountains. With this intent, the drainers of the bottle are, in a\r\nmanner of speaking, muzzled; they have by way of a mouth a pore that\r\nsucks without bruising.\r\n\r\nThe dying caterpillar continues to lay the silk of his carpet with a\r\nslow oscillation of the head. The moment now comes for the parasites to\r\nemerge. This happens in June and generally at nightfall. A breach is\r\nmade on the ventral surface or else in the sides, never on the back:\r\none breach only, contrived at a point of minor resistance, at the\r\njunction of two segments; for it is bound to be a toilsome business, in\r\nthe absence of a set of filing-tools. Perhaps the grubs take one\r\nanother's places at the point attacked and come by turns to work at it\r\nwith a kiss.\r\n\r\nIn one short spell, the whole tribe issues through this single opening\r\nand is soon wriggling about, perched on the surface of the caterpillar.\r\nThe lens cannot perceive the hole, which closes on the instant. There\r\nis not even a haemorrhage: the bottle has been drained too thoroughly.\r\nYou must press it between your fingers to squeeze out a few drops of\r\nmoisture and thus discover the place of exit.\r\n\r\nAround the caterpillar, who is not always quite dead and who sometimes\r\neven goes on weaving his carpet a moment longer, the vermin at once\r\nbegin to work at their cocoons. The straw-coloured thread, drawn from\r\nthe silk-glands by a backward jerk of the head, is first fixed to the\r\nwhite network of the caterpillar and then produces adjacent warp-beams,\r\nso that, by mutual entanglements, the individual works are welded\r\ntogether and form an agglomeration in which each of the grubs has its\r\nown cabin. For the moment, what is woven is not the real cocoon, but a\r\ngeneral scaffolding which will facilitate the construction of the\r\nseparate shells. All these frames rest upon those adjoining and, mixing\r\nup their threads, become a common edifice wherein each grub contrives a\r\nshelter for itself. Here at last the real cocoon is spun, a pretty\r\nlittle piece of closely-woven work.\r\n\r\nIn my rearing-jars I obtain as many groups of these tiny shells as my\r\nfuture experiments can wish for. Three-fourths of the caterpillars have\r\nsupplied me with them, so ruthless has been the toll of the spring\r\nbirths. I lodge these groups, one by one, in separate glass tubes, thus\r\nforming a collection on which I can draw at will, while, in view of my\r\nexperiments, I keep under observation the whole swarm produced by one\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\nThe adult Microgaster appears a fortnight later, in the middle of June.\r\nThere are fifty in the first tube examined. The riotous multitude is in\r\nthe full enjoyment of the pairing-season, for the two sexes always\r\nfigure among the guests of any one caterpillar. What animation! What an\r\norgy of love! The carnival of these pigmies bewilders the observer and\r\nmakes his head swim.\r\n\r\nMost of the females, wishful of liberty, plunge down to the waist\r\nbetween the glass of the tube and the plug of cotton-wool that closes\r\nthe end turned to the light; but the lower halves remain free and form\r\na circular gallery in front of which the males hustle one another, take\r\none another's places and hastily operate. Each bides his turn, each\r\nattends to his little matters for a few moments and then makes way for\r\nhis rivals and goes off to start again elsewhere. The turbulent wedding\r\nlasts all the morning and begins afresh next day, a mighty throng of\r\ncouples embracing, separating and embracing once more.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that, in gardens, the mated ones,\r\nfinding themselves in isolated couples, would keep quieter. Here, in\r\nthe tube, things degenerate into a riot because the assembly is too\r\nnumerous for the narrow space.\r\n\r\nWhat is lacking to complete its happiness? Apparently a little food, a\r\nfew sugary mouthfuls extracted from the flowers. I serve up some\r\nprovisions in the tubes: not drops of honey, in which the puny\r\ncreatures would get stuck, but little strips of paper spread with that\r\ndainty. They come to them, take their stand on them and refresh\r\nthemselves. The fare appears to agree with them. With this diet,\r\nrenewed as the strips dry up, I can keep them in very good condition\r\nuntil the end of my inquisition.\r\n\r\nThere is another arrangement to be made. The colonists in my spare\r\ntubes are restless and quick of flight; they will have to be\r\ntransferred presently to sundry vessels without my risking the loss of\r\na good number, or even the whole lot, a loss which my hands, my forceps\r\nand other means of coercion would be unable to prevent by checking the\r\nnimble movements of the tiny prisoners. The irresistible attraction of\r\nthe sunlight comes to my aid. If I lay one of my tubes horizontally on\r\nthe table, turning one end towards the full light of a sunny window,\r\nthe captives at once make for the brighter end and play about there for\r\na long while, without seeking to retreat. If I turn the tube in the\r\nopposite direction, the crowd immediately shifts its quarters and\r\ncollects at the other end. The brilliant sunlight is its great joy.\r\nWith this bait, I can send it whithersoever I please.\r\n\r\nWe will therefore place the new receptacle, jar or test-tube, on the\r\ntable, pointing the closed end towards the window. At its mouth, we\r\nopen one of the full tubes. No other precaution is needed: even though\r\nthe mouth leaves a large interval free, the swarm hastens into the\r\nlighted chamber. All that remains to be done is to close the apparatus\r\nbefore moving it. The observer is now in control of the multitude,\r\nwithout appreciable losses, and is able to question it at will.\r\n\r\nWe will begin by asking:\r\n\r\n\"How do you manage to lodge your germs inside the caterpillar?\"\r\n\r\nThis question and others of the same category, which ought to take\r\nprecedence of everything else, are generally neglected by the impaler\r\nof insects, who cares more for the niceties of nomenclature than for\r\nglorious realities. He classifies his subjects, dividing them into\r\nregiments with barbarous labels, a work which seems to him the highest\r\nexpression of entomological science. Names, nothing but names: the rest\r\nhardly counts. The persecutor of the Pieris used to be called\r\nMicrogaster, that is to say, little belly: to-day she is called\r\nApanteles, that is to say, the incomplete. What a fine step forward! We\r\nnow know all about it!\r\n\r\nCan our friend at least tell us how \"the Little Belly\" or \"the\r\nIncomplete\" gets into the caterpillar? Not a bit of it! A book which,\r\njudging by its recent date, should be the faithful echo of our actual\r\nknowledge, informs us that the Microgaster inserts her eggs direct into\r\nthe caterpillar's body. It goes on to say that the parasitic vermin\r\ninhabit the chrysalis, whence they make their way out by perforating\r\nthe stout horny wrapper. Hundreds of times have I witnessed the exodus\r\nof the grubs ripe for weaving their cocoons; and the exit has always\r\nbeen made through the skin of the caterpillar and never through the\r\narmour of the chrysalis. The fact that its mouth is a mere clinging\r\npore, deprived of any offensive weapon, would even lead me to believe\r\nthat the grub is incapable of perforating the chrysalid's covering.\r\n\r\nThis proved error makes me doubt the other proposition, though logical,\r\nafter all, and agreeing with the methods followed by a host of\r\nparasites. No matter: my faith in what I read in print is of the\r\nslightest; I prefer to go straight to facts. Before making a statement\r\nof any kind, I want to see, what I call seeing. It is a slower and more\r\nlaborious process; but it is certainly much safer.\r\n\r\nI will not undertake to lie in wait for what takes place on the\r\ncabbages in the garden: that method is too uncertain and besides does\r\nnot lend itself to precise observation. As I have in hand the necessary\r\nmaterials, to wit, my collection of tubes swarming with the parasites\r\nnewly hatched into the adult form, I will operate on the little table\r\nin my animals' laboratory. A jar with a capacity of about a litre\r\n(About 1 3/4 pints, or .22 gallon.--Translator's Note.) is placed on\r\nthe table, with the bottom turned towards the window in the sun. I put\r\ninto it a cabbage-leaf covered with caterpillars, sometimes fully\r\ndeveloped, sometimes half-way, sometimes just out of the egg. A strip\r\nof honeyed paper will serve the Microgaster as a dining room, if the\r\nexperiment is destined to take some time. Lastly, by the method of\r\ntransfer which I described above, I send the inmates of one of my tubes\r\ninto the apparatus. Once the jar is closed, there is nothing left to do\r\nbut to let things take their course and to keep an assiduous watch, for\r\ndays and weeks, if need be. Nothing worth remarking can escape me.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars graze placidly, heedless of their terrible attendants.\r\nIf some giddy-pates in the turbulent swarm pass over the caterpillars'\r\nspines, these draw up their fore-part with a jerk and as suddenly lower\r\nit again; and that is all: the intruders forthwith decamp. Nor do the\r\nlatter seem to contemplate any harm: they refresh themselves on the\r\nhoney-smeared strip, they come and go tumultuously. Their short flights\r\nmay land them, now in one place, now in another, on the browsing herd,\r\nbut they pay no attention to it. What we see is casual meetings, not\r\ndeliberate encounters.\r\n\r\nIn vain I change the flock of caterpillars and vary their age; in vain\r\nI change the squad of parasites; in vain I follow events in the jar for\r\nlong hours, morning and evening, both in a dim light and in the full\r\nglare of the sun: I succeed in seeing nothing, absolutely nothing, on\r\nthe parasite's side, that resembles an attack. No matter what the\r\nill-informed authors say--ill-informed because they had not the\r\npatience to see for themselves--the conclusion at which I arrive is\r\npositive: to inject the germs, the Microgaster never attacks the\r\ncaterpillars.\r\n\r\nThe invasion, therefore, is necessarily effected through the\r\nButterfly's eggs themselves, as experiment will prove. My broad jar\r\nwould tell against the inspection of the troop, kept at too great a\r\ndistance by the glass enclosure, and I therefore select a tube an inch\r\nwide. I place in this a shred of cabbage-leaf, bearing a slab of eggs,\r\nas laid by the Butterfly. I next introduce the inmates of one of my\r\nspare vessels. A strip of paper smeared with honey accompanies the new\r\narrivals.\r\n\r\nThis happens early in July. Soon, the females are there, fussing about,\r\nsometimes to the extent of blackening the whole slab of yellow eggs.\r\nThey inspect the treasure, flutter their wings and brush their\r\nhind-legs against each other, a sign of keen satisfaction. They sound\r\nthe heap, probe the interstices with their antennae and tap the\r\nindividual eggs with their palpi; then, this one here, that one there,\r\nthey quickly apply the tip of their abdomen to the egg selected. Each\r\ntime, we see a slender, horny prickle darting from the ventral surface,\r\nclose to the end. This is the instrument that deposits the germ under\r\nthe film of the egg; it is the inoculation-needle. The operation is\r\nperformed calmly and methodically, even when several mothers are\r\nworking at one and the same time. Where one has been, a second goes,\r\nfollowed by a third, a fourth and others yet, nor am I able definitely\r\nto see the end of the visits paid to the same egg. Each time, the\r\nneedle enters and inserts a germ.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in such a crowd, for the eye to follow the successive\r\nmothers who hasten to lay in each; but there is one quite practicable\r\nmethod by which we can estimate the number of germs introduced into a\r\nsingle egg, which is, later, to open the ravaged caterpillars and count\r\nthe grubs which they contain. A less repugnant means is to number the\r\nlittle cocoons heaped up around each dead caterpillar. The total will\r\ntell us how many germs were injected, some by the same mother returning\r\nseveral times to the egg already treated, others by different mothers.\r\nWell, the number of these cocoons varies greatly. Generally, it\r\nfluctuates in the neighbourhood of twenty, but I have come across as\r\nmany as sixty-five; and nothing tells me that this is the extreme\r\nlimit. What hideous industry for the extermination of a Butterfly's\r\nprogeny!\r\n\r\nI am fortunate at this moment in having a highly-cultured visitor,\r\nversed in the profundities of philosophic thought. I make way for him\r\nbefore the apparatus wherein the Microgaster is at work. For an hour\r\nand more, standing lens in hand, he, in his turn, looks and sees what I\r\nhave just seen; he watches the layers who go from one egg to the other,\r\nmake their choice, draw their slender lancet and prick what the stream\r\nof passers-by, one after the other, have already pricked. Thoughtful\r\nand a little uneasy, he puts down his lens at last.
