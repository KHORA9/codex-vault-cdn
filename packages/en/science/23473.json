The \"dry bones\" of the official publications are clothed\r\nwith materials which may be supplemented at will by the student of\r\nMilitary History, and the Lectures may thus, it is hoped, be of\r\nassistance to Infantry Officers, either in the course of their own\r\nstudies, or as a convenient groundwork upon which the instruction of\r\nothers may be based.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the work may be gathered from the Table of Contents and\r\nfrom the Index, and it will be seen that the general Principles\r\nunderlying the Art of Warfare are included in the scheme, while\r\nadvantage has been taken of the revision of the official Text-books to\r\nincorporate in the Lectures the lessons gained from the experience of\r\nleaders in the Great War.\r\n\r\nUpwards of 230 citations are made of \"Battle incidents,\" and, as an\r\nexample of the Author's methods, attention may perhaps be directed to\r\nthe reinforcement of the Text-book Principle of co-operation and mutual\r\nsupport by the citation of an instance, on the grand {viii} scale, by\r\nArmy Corps (during the _First Battle of the Marne_), and on the minor\r\nscale, by tanks, bombers, aircraft, and riflemen (during the _First\r\nBattle of the Somme_); to the successful application of established\r\nPrinciples by the Advanced Guard Commander at _Nachod_, and to the\r\nneglect of those Principles by \"Jeb\" Stuart at _Evelington Heights_,\r\nand by the Prussian Advanced Guard Commanders in 1870; and to the value\r\nof Musketry Training by instancing the successes achieved at the\r\n_Heights of Abraham_, at _Bunker Hill_, _Coruña_, and at\r\n_Fredericksburg_, which were repeated during the _Retreat from Mons_\r\nand at the _Second Battle of the Somme_.\r\n\r\nWhile every effort has been made to achieve accuracy in citation, and\r\nto avoid ambiguity or error in the enunciation of Principles, the\r\nAuthor will be very grateful if his readers will notify to him (at the\r\naddress of the Publishers) any inaccuracies or omissions which may come\r\nunder their notice.\r\n\r\nLONDON,\r\n  March, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{ix}\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGES\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF BATTLES CITED  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  xv-xvii\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS CITED IN THE LECTURES . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      xix\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF WARFARE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      1-5\r\n\r\n  Principles of War--Popular fallacies--Authorities quoted in\r\n  support of Fixed Principles (Gen.

The long and laborious line of study is the only safe way, and\r\nthere are many pitfalls to be avoided on the road.  One of these\r\npitfalls is dug by those who maintain, whenever a new war breaks out,\r\nthat all previous warlike knowledge must be thrown on the scrap-heap\r\nand attention paid only to the problems of the hour.  Another is the\r\nalluring trap that Warfare is \"merely a matter of common sense\"; and a\r\nthird is the oft-expressed idea that knowledge is required of the\r\nGeneral, and that compliance with orders is sufficient for the\r\nSubaltern Officer.\r\n\r\nKNOWLEDGE OF PRINCIPLES ESSENTIAL.--With regard to the first of these\r\ndifficulties, the opinions of recognised authorities on the Art of\r\nWarfare may be consulted.  \"The cardinal principles on which the art of\r\nwar is based are few and unchangeable, resembling in this the code of\r\nmorality; but their application varies with the theatre of the war, the\r\ngenius and temper of the people engaged, and the kind of arms employed\"\r\n(General R. Taylor, C.S. Army).  \"Although the manifold inventions of\r\nmodern times have given to warfare {2} a wider scope and fresh\r\nmaterials, it remains obedient to the same laws as in the past; but it\r\napplies these laws with means more numerous, more powerful, and more\r\ndelicate\" (Marshal Foch).  \"This war has given us no new principles;\r\nbut different mechanical appliances--and in particular the rapid\r\nimprovement and multiplication of aeroplanes, the use of immense\r\nnumbers of machine guns and Lewis guns, the employment of vast\r\nquantities of barbed wire as effective obstacles, the enormous\r\nexpansion of artillery, and the provision of great masses of motor\r\ntransport--have introduced new problems of considerable complexity\r\nconcerning the effective co-operation of the different arms and\r\nservices.  Much thought has had to be bestowed upon determining how new\r\ndevices could be combined in the best manner with the machinery already\r\nworking\" (Marshal Haig).\r\n\r\nThe laws of war are not in themselves difficult to understand, but\r\ntheir successful application on the field of battle requires that they\r\nshould be carefully studied and considered in all their aspects.  \"The\r\nmind can only be trained to this by close study of campaigns, and by\r\nthe solution of definite problems on maps and on the ground\" (General\r\nSir E. B. Hamley).  \"A lifelong experience of military study and\r\nthought has taught me that the principle of the tactical employment of\r\ntroops must be instinctive.  I know that in putting the Science of War\r\ninto practice it is necessary that its main tenets should form, so to\r\nspeak, part of one's flesh and blood.  In war there is little time to\r\nthink, and the right thing to do must come like a flash--it must\r\npresent itself to the mind as perfectly _obvious_\" (Marshal French).\r\nThe same idea is expressed by the Generalissimo of the largest\r\nvictorious force that was ever controlled by one mind.  \"Generally\r\nspeaking, grave situations partially obscure even a bright intellect.\r\nIt is therefore with a fully equipped mind that one ought to start in\r\norder to make war or even to understand {3} war.  No study is possible\r\non the battlefield; one does there simply what one _can_ in order to\r\napply what one knows.  In order to _do_ even a little one has to know a\r\ngreat deal, and to know it well. . . .  The right solution imposes\r\nitself; namely, the application, according to circumstances, of fixed\r\nprinciples. . . .  Incapacity and ignorance cannot be called\r\nextenuating circumstances, for knowledge is within the reach of all\"\r\n(Marshal Foch); and in the words of Napoleon's own maxim: \"The only way\r\nto learn the art of war is to read and _re-read_ the campaigns of the\r\ngreat captains.\"\r\n\r\nTHE \"COMMON-SENSE\" FALLACY.--The fallacy that warfare is \"merely a\r\nmatter of common sense\" has been exposed by Colonel G. F. R. Henderson,\r\nin his contrast of the conduct of the American Civil War of 1861-1865,\r\nwhen it was controlled by President Lincoln and his Cabinet in\r\nWashington, and when it was handed over without reserve to a\r\nprofessional soldier in the field (General Grant).  Few mortals have\r\npossessed \"common sense\" in greater abundance than Abraham Lincoln, and\r\nyet he permitted interference with his generals' plans, which were\r\nfrequently brought to nought by such interference, and but for a like\r\nhindrance of the Confederate generals by Jefferson Davis this\r\nwell-intentioned \"common sense\" would have been even more disastrous.\r\n\"Men who, aware of their ignorance, would probably have shrunk from\r\nassuming charge of a squad of infantry in action had no hesitation\r\nwhatever in attempting to direct a mighty army\" (Henderson, \"Stonewall\r\nJackson\").\r\n\r\nIn June, 1863, the Confederate Armies were scattered from Strasburg (in\r\nthe Valley) to Fredericksburg (in Spottsylvania); General Hooker,\r\ncommanding the Army of the Potomac in the field, begged to be allowed\r\nto attack Lee's Corps in detail.  Success was certain, but permission\r\nwas refused.  The one and only idea of the Federal Government was to\r\nkeep the Army of the Potomac between Lee and the Federal Capital.\r\n\r\n{4}\r\n\r\nTHE \"HIGHER RANKS\" FALLACY.--The same writer has also protested\r\nvehemently against the idea that the practice of strategy in the field\r\nis confined to the higher ranks.  \"Every officer in charge of a\r\ndetached force or flying column, every officer who for the time being\r\nhas to act independently, every officer in charge of a patrol, is\r\nconstantly brought face to face with strategical considerations; and\r\nsuccess or failure, even where the force is insignificant, will depend\r\nupon his familiarity with strategical principles\" (\"The Science of\r\nWar\").  In the same way, General Sir E. B. Hamley, in \"The Operations\r\nof War Explained,\" points out that a commander who cannot look beyond\r\nthe local situation is not competent to command a detachment, however\r\nsmall.  In addition, it must be remembered that superior knowledge of\r\nthe art of war, thorough acquaintance with duty, and large experience,\r\nseldom fail to command submission and respect.  Troops fight with\r\nmarked success when they feel that their leader \"knows his job,\" and in\r\nevery Army troops are the critics of their leaders.  The achievements\r\nof Jackson's forces in the _Shenandoah Valley Campaign_ of 1862 were\r\nalmost superhuman, but under Stonewall Jackson the apparently\r\nimpossible tasks were undertaken and achieved.  General Ewell, one of\r\nJackson's commanders, stated that he shivered whenever one of\r\nStonewall's couriers approached him.  \"I was always expecting him to\r\norder me to assault the North Pole!  But, if he _had_ ordered, we\r\nshould have done it!\"\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY FOR STUDY.--It is not pretended by any sane writer that\r\nstudy alone will make a perfect officer, for it is universally\r\nrecognised that no amount of theoretical training can supply the\r\nknowledge gained by direct and immediate association with troops in the\r\nfield; nor is it claimed that study will make a dull man brilliant, or\r\nconfer resolution and rapid decision on one who is timid and irresolute\r\nby nature.  But \"the quick, {5} the resolute, the daring, deciding and\r\nacting rapidly, as is their nature, will be all the more likely to\r\ndecide and act correctly in proportion as they have studied the art\r\nthey are called upon to practise\" (\"The Science of War\").  Theory,\r\napplied to the profession of arms, is to some a word of most obnoxious\r\nsound, but it is obnoxious only to those who refuse to listen to the\r\nadvice, or to take warning from the practice, of Napoleon, of\r\nWellington, of Foch, and of many of the most famous generals of\r\nhistory.  \"A man thoroughly penetrated with the spirit of Napoleon's\r\nwarfare would hardly fail in all circumstances to make his enemy's\r\ncommunications his first objective; and if Wellington's tactical\r\nmethods had become a second nature to him it would be strange indeed if\r\nhe were seduced into delivering a purely frontal attack. . . .  The\r\nsame tactical principles regulate the combat of a large force and a\r\nsmall, and it is the thorough grasp of the principles, combined with\r\ncourage and coolness, that makes a capable leader, whether of a platoon\r\nor an army corps\" (\"The Science of War\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{6}\r\n\r\nSTRATEGY AND TACTICS\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Strategy and Tactics have often been treated by\r\nnon-military writers as if they were independent branches of the\r\nsoldier's profession, but while they may indeed be separately defined\r\nit will be found in practice that they cannot be separately considered.\r\nThe theatre of operations is the kingdom of Strategy, the province of\r\nTactics is the field of battle, but when the battlefield is reached it\r\nso far transcends in importance every other point in the theatre of\r\noperations that no _tactical_ end is worth aiming at in preference to\r\nstriking with all available strength at the field force of the enemy,\r\nand this, it will be seen, is the goal of all _strategical_\r\ncombinations.  \"Strategy must ever be striving for Tactical success;\r\nTactics must ever keep in mind the Strategical situation and must\r\nconstantly aim at creating fresh Strategical opportunities.  Tactics\r\nwithout Strategy resembles a man without legs; Strategy without Tactics\r\nis like a man without arms\" (General Sir E. B. Hamley).  \"To seek out\r\nthe enemy's armies--the centre of the adversary's power--in order to\r\nbeat and destroy them; to adopt, with this sole end in view, the\r\ndirection and tactics which will lead to it in the quickest and safest\r\nway: such is the whole mental attitude of modern war.  No Strategy can\r\nhenceforth prevail over that which aims at ensuring Tactical results,\r\nvictory by fighting\" (Marshal Foch).\r\n\r\nLocal successes on the _field of battle_ often have effects that are\r\nfelt throughout the _theatre of operations_.  Lord Roberts's advance on\r\nPretoria relieved the pressure on Kimberley in the west and on\r\nLadysmith in the east, and these centres are upwards of 300 miles\r\napart.  _The {7} First Battle of the Somme_ (July 1, 1916) not only\r\nrelieved the pressure on Verdun but held in position large enemy forces\r\nwhich would otherwise have been employed against our Allies in the\r\nEast.  General Byng's surprise attack at Cambrai (November 20, 1917)\r\nwas followed by a determined counter-attack by the Germans on November\r\n30, which appeared to nullify the results achieved from November 20 to\r\n25; but \"there is evidence that German divisions intended for the\r\nItalian theatre were diverted to the Cambrai front, and it is probable\r\nthat the further concentration of German forces against Italy was\r\nsuspended for at least two weeks at a most critical period, when our\r\nAllies were making their first stand on the Piave Line\" (Sir D. Haig's\r\nDispatches).\r\n\r\nA tactical defeat may sometimes be risked to serve a strategic end.  In\r\nJune, 1864, General Hunter was operating with a Federal army in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and owing to shortage of supplies was forced to fall\r\nback.  In so doing he uncovered the National Capital, and General Early\r\nwas sent by the Confederate Commander-in-Chief to capture Washington.\r\nGeneral Grant took immediate steps to protect the capital by the\r\ndispatch of troops, and to further this end, General Lew Wallace,[1] on\r\nhis own initiative, confronted Early's corps at the _Monocacy_ on July\r\n8, 1864.  He met the enemy and was defeated, but he delayed Early's\r\ncorps until the troops sent by Grant were in position.  \"If Early had\r\nbeen but one day _earlier_ he might have entered the capital before the\r\narrival of the reinforcements I had sent.  General Wallace contributed\r\non this occasion, by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater\r\nbenefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an\r\nequal force to render by means of a victory\" (Grant's \"Memoirs\").  A\r\ntactical success may be not only useless, but actually inopportune, if\r\nit is out of accord with the plans of the higher command.  On the\r\nmorning of June 18, 1815, Marshal Grouchy was in {8} pursuit of the\r\nPrussians whom Napoleon had defeated on June 16 at Ligny.  Although\r\nurged \"to march to the sound of the cannon\" (at Waterloo), Grouchy\r\npushed on eastwards, where he found Thielmann's Prussian Corps of\r\n16,000 men holding the passage across the Dyle at Wavre.  The _Battle\r\nof Wavre_ was begun at 4 p.m. on June 18, and by 11 a.m. on the next\r\nday Grouchy was victorious.  But his victory was barren.  His tactical\r\nachievement was useless to the higher command and had exposed his own\r\nforce to considerable danger.  As he sat down to pen a vainglorious\r\ndispatch to the Emperor, he received the news that Napoleon was a\r\nfugitive and the Imperial Army defeated and scattered.  Grouchy's\r\nfeeble and false manoeuvres had permitted Blücher to join forces with\r\nWellington.  To the Emperor's dismay it was the Prussians who came from\r\nthe eastward to the sound of the cannon: \"C'est les Prussiens qui\r\nviennent!\"\r\n\r\nMORAL.--It is seen that Strategy may be defined as the art of\r\nconcentrating troops at the required strength, at the required time, at\r\nthe required place, for the purpose of overthrowing the enemy's main\r\narmies; while Tactics may be defined as the art of arranging and\r\nhandling troops so concentrated for the purpose of defeating the enemy\r\nwhen encountered.  But although Strategy may be considered as the art\r\nof bringing an opponent to battle, and Tactics as the art of defeating\r\nhim in action, there are excluded from these definitions many\r\nconsiderations which influence a commander in the field.\r\n\r\nThe art of war does not commence with a strategical reconnaissance from\r\nthe air, or the saddle, to ascertain whether, and if so in what\r\nlocality and in what strength, hostile troops are being concentrated.\r\nFrom information so obtained, the physical force of an enemy may indeed\r\nbe determined; but \"in war (said Napoleon) moral force is to the\r\nphysical (that is, to numbers and {9} armament) as three to one,\" and\r\nupwards of a hundred years later the same idea has again been\r\nexpressed.  \"To understand war you must go beyond its instruments and\r\nmaterials; you must study in the book of history, conscientiously\r\nanalysed, armies, troops in movement and in action, with their needs,\r\ntheir passions, their devotions, their capacities of all kinds.  That\r\nis the essence of the subject, that is the point of departure for a\r\nreasonable study of the art of war\" (Marshal Foch).  And while dealing\r\nwith moral force it must be remembered that the moral force of opposing\r\nleaders of nations or of armies is at least as important as that of the\r\nnations or armies themselves, for a war is a struggle between human\r\nintelligences rather than between masses of men.  \"There have been\r\nsoldiers' battles but never a soldiers' campaign\" (\"The Science of\r\nWar\").  \"It was not the Roman legions which conquered Gaul, it was\r\nCaesar.  It was not the French Army which reached the Weser and the\r\nInn, it was Turenne\" (Napoleon).  A commander must, therefore, take\r\ninto account the character, the moral fibre, as well as the ability and\r\nthe means at the disposal of his adversary.  He must project his mind\r\nto his adversary's council chamber, and putting himself in his place\r\nmust conjecture how a man of that character and of that ability will\r\nact under the given circumstances.\r\n\r\nHistory supplies many examples of mental activity of this kind.[2]\r\nNapoleon predicted the impetuous onset of the Russian left wing against\r\nhis right at _Austerlitz_, Dec. 2, 1805, because he knew the\r\ntemperament of the Tsar Alexander.  At Austerlitz, the most brilliant\r\nof all his battles, Napoleon had 70,000 troops and was confronted by\r\n80,000 Austrians and Russians drawn up on the Heights of Pratzen.  His\r\nplan was to draw the weight of the Russian attack against his\r\nright--which was so disposed as to invite the headstrong and {10}\r\nself-confident Tsar \"to administer a lesson in generalship to\r\nNapoleon\"--and then to launch a superior attack against the Heights,\r\nwhich contained a village and a knoll, the key to the position; and\r\nfinally to hurl his General Reserve in a decisive counter-attack on the\r\nRussians when they were involved in battle with his right wing.  When\r\nthe rattle of musketry and booming of the guns showed that his right\r\nwas engaged, Napoleon launched Murat, Bernadotte, and Soult against the\r\nallied centre; when Soult was master of the village and the knoll, and\r\nas the broken remnants of the enemy's centre were streaming down the\r\nreverse slopes of the Pratzen Ridge, the French centre wheeled round to\r\nthe right and threw itself upon the flank and rear of the Russians, who\r\nwere still heavily engaged in their original attack.  These operations\r\nwere completely successful and over 40,000 of the opposing armies were\r\naccounted for.  Wellington defeated Soult at Sauroren in the Pyrenees\r\n(July 28, 1813) by taking advantage of a minor incident.  He had ridden\r\nforward to see the disposition of the French forces, and as his men\r\ncheered him all along the line, he turned to his staff and said, \"Soult\r\nis a very cautious commander.  He will delay his attack to find out\r\nwhat those cheers mean; that will give time for the Sixth Division to\r\narrive and I shall beat him\"--and the event turned out exactly as he\r\nhad predicted.  Generals R. E. Lee and T. J. Jackson frequently played\r\nupon the nervousness of President Lincoln for the safety of Washington,\r\nand by threatening to cross the Potomac induced him to withdraw troops\r\nthat were advancing against Richmond.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL MORAL.--The moral fibre of the nation and of the troops must\r\nalso be taken into consideration.  \"The common theory that, in order to\r\nwin, an army must have superiority of rifles and cannon, better bases,\r\nmore wisely chosen positions, is radically false.  For it leaves out of\r\naccount the most important part of the {11} problem, that which\r\nanimates it and makes it live, man--with his moral, intellectual, and\r\nphysical qualities\" (Marshal Foch).\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE AND MORALITY.--The discipline, courage, and endurance of the\r\ntroops, as well as the cause for which they are fighting, are at least\r\nof equal importance to their armament and numbers.  \"If their\r\ndiscipline and leading be defective, Providence seldom sides with the\r\nbig battalions . . . and troops that cannot march are untrustworthy\r\nauxiliaries\" (\"The Science of War\").  \"An army which cannot march well\r\nis almost certain to be outmanoeuvred.  A general whose strategy is\r\nbased upon time calculations that are rendered inaccurate by the\r\nbreakdown of the marching power of his troops runs grave risk of\r\ndisaster.  It is therefore necessary that the question of marching\r\nshould be studied, not only by generals and staff officers, but by\r\nregimental officers and men.  It is on the latter that the hardships\r\nand exertions fall, and their cheerful endurance can best be ensured by\r\nteaching them the great results attainable by an army which can move\r\nfaster and further than its adversary, as well as the dangers incurred\r\nby an army which allows itself to be out-marched. . . .  Superior\r\nmobility alone enabled Frederick the Great to move 'like a panther\r\nround an ox' so as to place his army across the enemy's flank.  The\r\ndiscipline of his troops enabled him to apply the principles of\r\ncombination\" (General Sir E. B. Hamley).  \"Nothing compensates for\r\nabsence of discipline; and the constant watchfulness that is necessary\r\nin war, even when danger seems remote, can only be secured by\r\ndiscipline, which makes of duty a habit\" (General R. Taylor, C.S.\r\nArmy).  At the _Battle of Hastings_ (Oct. 14, 1066) lack of discipline\r\nand disobedience of orders changed the fate of the English nation and\r\nbrought about the Norman Conquest.  Harold, the English king, had\r\ndefeated the forces of Harold Hadraade, {12} King of Norway, at\r\nStamford Bridge in Yorkshire (Sept. 25, 1066).  Four days later, Duke\r\nWilliam of Normandy landed in Pevensey Bay, with 60,000 horse and foot.\r\nHarold hastened south to meet him with troops exhausted by battle and\r\nmarching.  After halting six days in London to collect reinforcements,\r\nthe English force entrenched itself on the hill of Sautlache and\r\nawaited attack.  The Normans were unable to penetrate the abattis, but\r\nthey gained the victory which changed the whole history of the English\r\nrace by the stratagem of a feigned retreat.  Harold's undisciplined\r\nauxiliaries, contrary to direct orders (which were obeyed by the\r\n\"regular\" troops in the centre), swarmed out of the palisades in\r\npursuit of the fleeing Normans, who suddenly turned about and\r\npenetrated the English lines mingled with the discomfited auxiliaries.\r\nHad the \"irregulars\" shown the same sense of discipline as the\r\n\"regulars\" there had been no Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nWith regard to marching, General T. J. Jackson once observed, in reply\r\nto an allusion to his severe marching, that \"it is better to lose one\r\nman in marching than five in fighting.\"  Acting on this principle he\r\ninvariably surprised his enemy, the most notable instances being his\r\nsurprise of Milroy at McDowell, of Banks and Fremont in the Valley, of\r\nMcClellan's right at Gaines's Mill, of Pope at the Second Manassas, and\r\nhis last and greatest of Hooker at Chancellorsville.\r\n\r\nTIME.--Time is often a supreme factor in warfare, and the superior\r\nmobility of troops will gain for their commander a great strategical\r\nadvantage.  Reserves are of little value if they cannot be concentrated\r\nat the right spot at the right moment, and steamships, railways, and\r\nmechanical transport thus play an important part in war.  The mobility\r\nof infantry is often the deciding factor in battle, and campaigns have\r\nbeen won by the legs of soldiers as much as by their arms.\r\n\r\n{13}\r\n\r\nWEATHER.--The weather is an important factor in war, and its influence\r\nappears to have increased in modern times.  Mists and fogs militate\r\nagainst observation by aircraft, and poor visibility interferes with\r\nthe work of artillery.  Roads are broken up by the weight of modern\r\ntraffic, and in a shelled area the craters become impassable after a\r\nfew days rain, making the supply of food, stores and ammunition a\r\nserious problem.  Such conditions multiply the difficulties of attack,\r\nas the ground of the encounter consists principally of hastily dug\r\ntrenches which become running streams of mud; and they assist the\r\ndefence, as the pursuit is delayed, while the ground behind the\r\ndefending force is less liable to be churned up by shell fire.  The bad\r\nweather of September, 1916, caused a delay in the Allied advance\r\nagainst Sailly-Saillesel and Le Transloy and made it necessary to\r\nabandon the plan at the moment when previous successes seemed to have\r\nbrought it within the grasp of the commanders.  As the season advanced\r\nand the bad weather continued the plans of the Allies had to be\r\nreduced, and the brilliant successes already achieved afforded some\r\nindication of what might have been accomplished had the weather\r\npermitted the plans to be carried out as originally intended.\r\n\r\nHEALTH.--\"Wars may be won or lost by the standard of health and moral\r\nof the opposing forces.  Moral depends to a very large extent upon the\r\nfeeding and general well-being of the troops.  Badly supplied troops\r\nwill invariably be low in moral, and an army ravaged by disease ceases\r\nto be a fighting force.  The feeding and health of the fighting forces\r\nare dependent upon the rearward services, and so it may be argued that\r\nwith the rearward services rests victory or defeat\" (Marshal Haig).\r\n\r\nHUMAN NATURE.--Human nature is affected by discipline, fear, hunger,\r\nconfidence in or distrust of leaders, and by a variety of other\r\ninfluences, and human {14} nature is more important than armament and\r\nnumbers.  \"No great deeds have ever been performed by an army in which\r\nthe qualities of courage and steadfast endurance are wanting\" (General\r\nSir E. B. Hamley), and the steadfast endurance of a nation and of its\r\nleaders is also a factor of supreme importance.  Time occupied in\r\npreparation for battle, or in manoeuvring for the \"weather gauge,\" is\r\nseldom wasted; but it involves the risk of a weak-kneed executive\r\nyielding to popular clamour.  Against the strategical and tactical\r\ngenius of Hannibal, Quintus Fabius Maximus invoked the aid of time to\r\nafford him opportunities to strike.  His \"Fabian Tactics\" have become\r\nproverbial, and earned for him at the time the opprobrious epithet\r\n\"Cunctator,\" which the epigram[3] of Ennius has immortalised in his\r\nhonour.  Popular clamour led to a division of authority with Varro, and\r\nto the disaster of _Cannae_ (B.C. 216).  General G. B. McClellan was\r\nrecalled from the Army of the Potomac on account of his failure to\r\nconvert the drawn battle of the _Antietam_ (Sept. 17, 1862) into a\r\nvictory, and the army was handed over to General Burnside, who suffered\r\ndefeat at _Fredericksburg_ (Dec. 13, 1862) with terrible slaughter.\r\n\"But the stout heart of the American nation quickly rallied, and\r\ninspired by the loyal determination of Abraham Lincoln the United\r\nStates turned once more to their apparently hopeless task\" (Colonel G.\r\nF. R. Henderson).  McClellan's forte was organisation, and although at\r\nfirst slow in the field, he had assembled and trained a magnificent\r\nfighting force, with which he was \"feeling his way to victory.\"  He\r\nsuffered defeat indeed at _Gaines's Mill_ (June 27, 1862), the first\r\nact in the drama of the _Seven Days' Battle around Richmond_.  Day\r\nafter day he fell back through swamp and forest, battling with Lee's\r\nvictorious troops.  But there was no further disaster.  Under the most\r\nadverse and dispiriting circumstances the Army of the Potomac fairly\r\nheld their own until {15} they reached the impregnable position of\r\nMalvern Hill.  There McClellan turned at bay and repulsed with heavy\r\nslaughter the disjointed attacks of the Army of Northern Virginia.  He\r\nhad withdrawn his army intact and had effected a change of base,\r\nunknown to the Confederate General Staff, from the York River to the\r\nJames.  This proved his strategic power, as did the dispositions at\r\n_Malvern Hill_ (July 1, 1862) his tactical ability, and his work was\r\naccomplished in spite of the intrigues of politicians and the\r\nopposition of the executive, and in face of the military genius of\r\nGenerals R. E. Lee and T. J. Jackson.  At the Antietam he forced the\r\nConfederates to give battle, and although tactically indecisive, the\r\nengagement caused the withdrawal of Lee's army into Virginia.\r\nMcClellan's successors were far less competent, and the magnificent\r\nArmy of the Potomac met with frequent disasters, until it formed the\r\nsolid nucleus of the forces of General Meade, which inflicted upon Lee\r\nhis first defeat and saved the Union at _Gettysburg_ (July 1-3, 1863),\r\nand finally under Grant, in conjunction with the Armies of the West,\r\ncrushed the life out of the Confederacy at _Appomattox_.\r\n\r\nGeneral G. H. Thomas, in command of the U.S. Army of the Cumberland,\r\nrefused battle with the Confederates in Nashville until he had prepared\r\ncavalry and made every other arrangement for pursuit.  Constancy of\r\npurpose was the salient feature of Thomas's military character.  He\r\nwould not fight until he was ready.  The civil authorities urgently\r\ndemanded that he should advance.  So great was the tension that Grant\r\nfinally sent General J. A. Logan to supersede Thomas; but before Logan\r\narrived Thomas had won the _Battle of Nashville_ (Dec. 15-16, 1864),\r\nthe most crushing victory of the war.\r\n\r\nLord Roberts landed in Cape Town on Jan. 10, 1900, and popular\r\nexpectation was degenerating into impatience when a co-ordinated\r\nadvance of French's cavalry and the Sixth and Ninth Infantry Divisions\r\n{16} resulted in the relief of beleagured cities distant from the field\r\nof battle, and in the surrender on the field of Cronje's force at\r\n_Paardeberg_ (Feb. 27, 1900), on the anniversary of Majuba.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF FRANCE.--In all calculations on which a declaration of\r\nwar is based the moral fibre of the actual and potential enemy nations\r\nis fully considered.  It is difficult to imagine that the Headquarters\r\nStaff of the German and Austrian Armies failed to bring under review\r\nthe moral of the nations against whom their armies were to be launched\r\nin July, 1914.  The Spirit of France had shown no signs of\r\ndeterioration, but was to be quelled by a rapid advance through neutral\r\nterritories, to bring about a bewildered collapse, as in 1870, before\r\nthe Russian mobilisation was complete, and \"Nous sommes trahis\" was\r\nagain to be heard from the disheartened troops.  But the calm\r\ndetermination of the commander and his generals in the dark days of\r\nAugust, 1914, prevented the bewildered collapse, and the _Defence of\r\nVerdun_ from February to August, 1916, and the cheers of the _poilus_,\r\nas they recaptured the _Chemin des Dames_ in April-July, 1917, replaced\r\nthe capitulation of Sedan and of Metz and the \"Nous sommes trahis\" of\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN.--Britain was not expected to take an active part in the\r\nstruggle, and if she did the affairs of Ireland, the Suffragette\r\nmovement, and the general decadence of the nation would prevent a\r\nwhole-hearted prosecution of the war.  A small force only could be sent\r\nto Europe; it would be swallowed up in the \"bewildered collapse,\" and\r\nno reinforcements could be spared.  The extent of the miscalculation is\r\nshown in Mr. Lloyd George's speech in the House of Commons on July 3,\r\n1919, in which the Prime Minister stated that the British Empire had\r\nput 7,700,000 men under arms, had raised 9,500,000,000 pounds in taxes\r\nand loans, and had suffered upwards of 8,000,000 casualties on land and\r\n{17} sea.  It was also shown that during the last two years of the war\r\nthe British armies had borne the brunt of the heaviest fighting on the\r\nWestern Front in France and at the same time had destroyed the armed\r\nforces of the Turkish Empire in the East.  The risk of compelling\r\nBritain to take part was undertaken, and the first great strategical\r\nblunder of the war was committed.\r\n\r\nAMERICA.--In the third year of the War America had gradually been\r\nbrought into the arena, and a further miscalculation arrayed the\r\nhundred millions of a free and united nation against the autocracies of\r\nCentral Europe.\r\n\r\nLORD ROBERTS.--Other brains than German had considered the possibility\r\nof an armed conflict in Europe.  For many years Lord Roberts had\r\nadvocated universal military service in the United Kingdom, as a\r\nprocedure beneficial in itself, and imperative on account of the clear\r\nintentions of the Headquarters Staff of the German Army.  \"Germany\r\nstrikes when Germany's hour has struck,\" was his warning note, and\r\nalthough apparently unheeded by the nation, his warning was not without\r\neffect upon the training of the Regular Army.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HENDERSON.--Military writers in the United Kingdom had also\r\nconsidered the possibility of a conflict with the armed forces of\r\nGermany, and in all their treatises the moral of the nation was passed\r\nunder review.  Colonel G. F. R. Henderson, in \"The Science of War,\" had\r\neven envisaged a struggle in which not only the troops of Britain and\r\nthe Overseas Dominions but those of the United States would take part,\r\nand his estimate of the moral of the race on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, and in both hemispheres, was fully justified by the events of\r\nthe War.  Colonel Henderson found in the race something more than\r\ntoughness in its moral fibre, for he adds, \"Tactical ability is the\r\nbirthright of {18} our race. . . .  In a conflict on the vastest scale\r\n(the American Civil War) the tactics of the American troops, at a very\r\nearly period, were superior to those of the Prussians in 1866.  In\r\nStrategy, controlled as it was on both sides by the civil governments\r\nand not by the military chiefs, grave errors were committed, but on the\r\nfield of battle the racial instinct asserted itself.  Nor were the\r\nlarger tactical manoeuvres even of 1870 an improvement on those of the\r\nAmerican campaigns. . . .  But in 1878, Skobeleff, the first of\r\nEuropean generals to master the problem of the offensive, knew the\r\nAmerican War 'by heart,' and in his successful assaults on the Turkish\r\nredoubts he followed the plan of the American generals on both sides,\r\nwhen attempting to carry such positions; to follow up the assaulting\r\ncolumns with fresh troops, without waiting for the first column to be\r\nrepulsed.\"  After the Civil War, General Forrest, a cavalry leader of\r\nthe Confederate States Army, was asked to what he attributed his\r\nsuccess in so many actions.  He replied: \"Well, I reckon I got there\r\nfirst with the most men,\" thereby stating in a nutshell the key to the\r\nArt of War.  \"At Nachod, the Austrian commander had numbers on his\r\nside, yet he sent into action part only of his forces, and it was by\r\nnumbers that he was beaten\" (Marshal Foch).  With regard to the moral\r\nof the race Colonel Henderson makes this emphatic statement: \"In the\r\nlast nine months of the American Civil War, time and again, according\r\nto all precedent, one side or the other ought to have been whipped, but\r\nit declined to be anything of the sort.  The losses show this.  This\r\nwas due in no small measure to the quality which the troops on both\r\nsides inherited from the stock that furnished his infantry to the Duke\r\nof Wellington.  Never to know when they were beaten was a\r\ncharacteristic of both North and South.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CONTEMPTIBLE LITTLE ARMY.--In place of the general decadence of the\r\nBritish race, upon which the German Staff appear to have relied, this\r\ncharacteristic {19} quality of endurance was exhibited by French's\r\n\"Contemptible Little Army\" during the _Retreat from Mons_ in August,\r\n1914, at the _First Battle of Ypres_ (October 20, 1914), and at the\r\n_Second Battle of Ypres_ (April 22, 1915).  Of his \"Contemptible Little\r\nArmy\" Marshal French writes in his book, \"1914\": \"The British Army had\r\nindeed suffered severely, and had performed a herculean task in\r\nreaching its present position in such fighting form, and its _moral_\r\nhad withstood the ordeal.  I think the Germans were probably justified\r\nin doubting our offensive powers, but the thing they forgot was the\r\nnation from which we spring.\"\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ARMIES.--From 1915 to 1918 the New Armies, raised, equipped,\r\nand trained during the War, and representing the Empire in arms,\r\ndisplayed the same inherent quality, and disproved for ever the charge\r\nof decadence that had been brought against the British race.  \"That\r\nthese troops should have accomplished so much under such conditions,\r\nand against an army and a nation whose chief concern for so many years\r\nhad been preparation for war, constitutes a feat of which the history\r\nof our nation records no equal. . . .  Troops from every part of the\r\nBritish Isles and from every Dominion and quarter of the Empire,\r\nwhether Regulars, Territorials, or men of the New Armies, have borne a\r\nshare in the battle. . . .  Among all the long roll of victories borne\r\non the colours of our regiments, there has never been a higher test of\r\nthe endurance and resolution of our Infantry.  They have shown\r\nthemselves worthy of the highest traditions of our race, and of the\r\nproud records of former wars\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatch, December 23,\r\n1916).\r\n\r\n\"Our new and hastily trained armies have shown once again that they are\r\ncapable of meeting and beating the enemy's best troops, even under\r\nconditions which favoured his defence to a degree which it required the\r\ngreatest endurance, determination, and heroism to {20} overcome\" (Sir\r\nD. Haig's Dispatch, December 25, 1917).  \"It is no disparagement of the\r\ngallant deeds performed on other fronts to say that, in the stubborn\r\nstruggle for the line of hills which stretches from Wytschaete to\r\nPasschendaele, the great armies that to-day are shouldering the burden\r\nof our Empire have shown themselves worthy of the regiments which, in\r\nOctober and November of 1914, made Ypres take rank for ever amongst the\r\nmost glorious of British battles\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatch, December 25,\r\n1917).  \"The British infantryman has always had the reputation of\r\nfighting his best in an uphill battle, and time and again in the\r\nhistory of our country, by sheer tenacity and determination of purpose,\r\nhas won victory from a numerically superior foe.  Thrown once more upon\r\nthe defensive by circumstances over which he had no control, but which\r\nwill not persist, he has shown himself to possess in full measure the\r\ntraditional qualities of his race\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatch, July 20,\r\n1918).  \"Throughout this long period of incessant fighting against\r\ngreatly superior numbers the behaviour of all arms of the British\r\nforces engaged was magnificent.  What they achieved is best described\r\nin the words of the French General (Maistre) under whose orders they\r\ncame, who wrote of them: 'They have enabled us to establish a barrier\r\nagainst which the hostile waves have beaten and shattered themselves.\r\nCela aucun des témoins français ne l'oubliera'\" (Sir D. Haig's\r\nDispatch, December 21, 1918).\r\n\r\nAfter four years of fighting, at the close of a defensive campaign of\r\nthe utmost severity, protracted by the efforts of the enemy from March\r\n21-July 17, 1918, the New Armies passed from the guard to the thrust.\r\nThey were everywhere victorious, and in nine pitched battles they\r\ncaptured upwards of 175,000 prisoners and 2,600 guns.\r\n\r\n\"In order to estimate the ardour and endurance of these troops during\r\nthis final stage, it will be enough to mention the dates and importance\r\nof the main events--\r\n\r\n{21}\r\n\r\n\"_Battle of Amiens_ (Aug. 8-13) in which the IV.

Armies: 19,000\r\nprisoners, 450 guns.\"\r\n\r\n(Marshal Foch.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN METHOD.--The principles which underlie the Art of War would\r\nthus appear to be based on constant factors, but the methods of their\r\napplication are susceptible to change, for in their application the\r\nprinciples are subject to the influence of successive inventions.\r\nGunpowder abolished the bow and arrow and the knight in armour; the\r\nbayonet affixed to the musket superseded the pike; the rifle outranged\r\nthe musket; the breech-loader and the magazine attachment progressively\r\nincreased the rate of fire; smokeless powder rendered a firing line\r\nalmost invisible; the flat trajectory of the small-arms bullet\r\nincreased the danger-zone in an advance; the increased power, mobility,\r\nand accuracy of the field gun[4] rendered certain {22} formations\r\nobsolete in the attack; the general advance in the rate and accuracy of\r\nfire from rifles, machine guns, and artillery made attack on a strongly\r\norganised position possible only when surprise in the time and place of\r\nthe thrust neutralises the advantages of the defence, or when an\r\noverwhelming barrage of shells and bullets covers the advance and\r\nsmothers the enemy's resistance.  The advent of a third service, by the\r\naddition of the Air to the Sea and Land Services, increased the\r\nfacilities for reconnaissance[5] and added to the difficulties of\r\nconcealing movement during the hours of daylight.  These and similar\r\ninfluences have brought about changes in certain respects, amongst\r\nwhich the most pronounced is the increased use of field entrenchments,\r\nand tactical methods have been evolved to meet the necessities of the\r\ncase, or modified to suit the new requirements.[6]\r\n\r\nBut no inventions can shift the burden of war from the shoulders of the\r\ninfantryman.  \"Despite the enormous development of mechanical invention\r\nin every phase of warfare, the place which the infantryman has always\r\nheld as the main substance and foundation of an army is as secure\r\nto-day as in any period of history.  The infantryman remains the\r\nbackbone of defence and the spearhead of the attack.  At no time has\r\nthe reputation of the British infantryman been higher, or his\r\nachievement more worthy of his renown. . . .  Immense as the\r\ninfluence of mechanical devices may be, they cannot by themselves\r\ndecide a campaign.  Their true _rôle_ is that of assisting the\r\ninfantryman. . . .  They cannot replace him.  Only by the rifle and\r\nbayonet of the infantryman can the decisive victory be won\" (Sir D.\r\nHaig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\n{23}\r\n\r\nTHE TEXT-BOOKS.--Changes in tactical methods are recorded from time to\r\ntime in circulars issued by the General Staff, to be embodied\r\neventually in the official text-books.  These text-books (\"Infantry\r\nTraining\" and \"Field Service Regulations\") are the foundation upon\r\nwhich the study of Infantry Tactics should be based, and of these books\r\nColonel G. F. R. Henderson has left behind him the following opinion:\r\n\"That portion of our own text-books which refers to Infantry in Attack\r\nand Defence is merely the essence of Tactics.  There is no single\r\nsentence that is not of primary importance, no single principle laid\r\ndown that can be violated with impunity, no single instruction that\r\nshould not be practised over and over again.\"  After four years of\r\nwarfare, in which the principles enunciated in the text-books had been\r\nput to the most searching of all tests (_i.e._ practical application in\r\nWar), the General Staff of the Army was able to preface a list of its\r\nrecent publications with the following exhortation: \"It must be\r\nremembered that the principles laid down in Field Service Regulations\r\nand in Infantry Training are still the basis of all sound knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the final victorious campaign, Marshal Haig emphasised\r\nthe truth of this claim: \"The longer the war lasted the more\r\nemphatically has it been realised that our original organisation and\r\ntraining were based on correct principles.  The danger of altering them\r\ntoo much, to deal with some temporary phase, has been greater than the\r\nrisk of adjusting them too little. . . .  The experience gained in this\r\nwar alone, without the study and practice of lessons learned from other\r\ncampaigns, could not have sufficed to meet the ever-changing tactics\r\nwhich have characterised the fighting.  There was required also the\r\nsound basis of military knowledge supplied by our Training Manuals and\r\nStaff Colleges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Author of \"Ben Hur.\"\r\n\r\n[2] For an example in military fiction, see _The Second Degree_ in \"The\r\nGreen Curve.\"\r\n\r\n[3] \"Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.\"\r\n\r\n[4] The term \"field gun\" was limited to the 18-pounder until the _Boer\r\nWar_, when heavy guns were used as mobile artillery.  In the Great War,\r\nmechanical transport brought into the field of battle guns of the\r\nlargest calibre.  Quick-firing field guns were first used by the\r\nAbyssinians against the Italians at the Battle of Adowa (February 29,\r\n1896).\r\n\r\n[5] Reconnoitring balloons were first used by the Army of the Potomac\r\nat the Battle of Fredericksburg (December 12, 1862).  Aeroplanes were\r\nused in warfare for the first time in 1911, during the Italo-Turkish\r\ncampaign in Tripoli, North Africa.\r\n\r\n[6] Heavily armoured cars, known as \"Tanks,\" were introduced during the\r\nFirst Battle of the Somme, September 15, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{24}\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE\r\n\r\n\"Theoretically, a well conducted battle is a decisive attack\r\nsuccessfully carried out.\"--MARSHAL FOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Art of War, in order to arrive at its aim (which is to impose its\r\nwill upon the enemy), knows but one means, the destruction of the\r\nadversary's organised forces.  So we arrive at the battle, the only\r\nargument of war, the only proper end that may be given to strategical\r\noperations, and we begin by establishing the fact that to accomplish\r\nthe aim of war the battle cannot be purely defensive.  The results of a\r\ndefensive battle are exclusively negative; it may check the enemy in\r\nhis march; it may prevent him from achieving his immediate aim; but it\r\nnever leads to his destruction, and so is powerless to achieve the\r\nwished-for victory.  Therefore, every defensive battle must terminate\r\nwith an offensive action or there will be no result\" (Marshal Foch).\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE BATTLE.--No two battles are precisely similar,\r\nbut there are certain characteristics common to every battle.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the issue is almost always uncertain, for events\r\nwhich no human sagacity could provide against may occur to defeat the\r\nwisest plans.  The best chances, therefore, are on the side of the\r\ncommander who is provided with sufficient means to achieve his object,\r\nwho forms his plans with the greatest sagacity, and executes them with\r\nthe greatest ability.  Decisive success has followed the combinations\r\nof great commanders, and in the long run victory pays homage to\r\nknowledge of the principles which underlie the art of war.  {25}\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the human factor always plays its part in battle.\r\nTroops lacking in discipline are liable to panic in face of a sudden\r\ndisaster, and even the best troops are liable to become unsteady if\r\ntheir flank is gained.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, a comparatively small body of fresh troops thrown\r\ninto action at the right moment against greater numbers, if the latter\r\nare exhausted by fighting, may achieve a success out of all proportion\r\nto their numbers.  For this reason a prudent commander will endeavour\r\nto retain under his control some portion of his reserves, to be thrown\r\nin after his adversary has exhausted his own reserve power.\r\n\r\nTo be superior at the point of attack is the Art of Warfare in a\r\nnutshell, and for this reason attacks on separate points of a position\r\nmust be properly synchronised to be effective.  The unbeaten enemy will\r\notherwise possess a mobile reserve with which to reinforce threatened\r\npoints.  The attacks must be so timed that he throws them in piecemeal\r\nor fails to reach the point mainly threatened.\r\n\r\nMcClellan's position with the Army of the Potomac on _Malvern Hill_\r\n(July 1, 1862) was a desperate position to attack in front, but it\r\ncould have been turned on the right.  The hill dominated the ground to\r\nthe north, and also the road on which Lee's Army of Northern Virginia\r\nwas approaching, and was crowned with numerous heavy guns, against\r\nwhich Lee's artillery was powerless.  It was Lee's intention to open\r\nwith an attack by a division, supported by two brigades, on the right\r\nof the position, and when this force was at grips with the Army of the\r\nPotomac, to assault the centre with a bayonet charge.  About 5 p.m. the\r\nsound of cheering was heard near the right of the position, and\r\nmistaking this for the signal, General D. H. Hill launched the attack\r\non the centre.  The first line of defence was carried, but the Northern\r\nArmy was unoccupied in the other parts of the line, and reinforcements\r\nquickly {26} beat off the attack with heavy loss.  After this attack\r\nhad failed, Magruder's division arrived in position and the attack on\r\nthe right flank was delivered with similar results.  Both attacks were\r\ncarried out with superb courage, but partial blows of this nature are\r\nwithout the first elements of success, and McClellan's movements were\r\nnot again molested.\r\n\r\nPHASES OF THE BATTLE.--There are three principal phases of every\r\nbattle.  Information must be obtained by observation and by fighting;\r\nadvantage must be taken of information so obtained to strike where the\r\nblow or blows will be most effective; success obtained by fighting must\r\nbe developed until the enemy is annihilated.\r\n\r\n_Information and the Initiative_.--Much work requires to be done in the\r\nair and on the land before the rival armies come face to face.\r\nAircraft and the independent cavalry (advanced mounted troops and fast\r\ntanks detached from divisions for the purpose), endeavour to ascertain\r\nwhether, and if so in what locality and in what strength, troops are\r\nbeing concentrated by the enemy.  From information so obtained the\r\nHeadquarters Staff are able to conjecture the intentions and aims of\r\nthe enemy, and the extent to which their own intentions and aims have\r\nbeen perceived by the enemy.  After the enemy is encountered this\r\ninformation is at the service of the Commander of the troops, but it\r\nwill generally require to be supplemented by fighting.  On each side\r\nthe commander will be striving to obtain the _initiative_, to impose\r\nhis will upon his opponent, for the commander who loses the initiative\r\nis compelled to conform to the plans and movements of his adversary,\r\ninstead of bringing into operation plans and movements better suited to\r\nhis own purposes.  Each is scheming to obtain or retain the liberty of\r\nmanoeuvre, in the same way as, in the days of sailing ships, a naval\r\ncommander strove to get the \"weather gauge\" in every encounter.\r\n\r\nThe initiative won by the Strategy of one commander {27} is sometimes\r\nwrested from him by the Tactics of his adversary.  This was exemplified\r\nat the _Battle of Salamanca_ (July 22, 1812).  Wellington, the\r\ngeneralissimo of the Anglo-Portuguese forces, had decided to withdraw\r\nbehind the River Tormes to the stronghold Ciudad Rodrigo, and had\r\ndispatched his train to that centre.  The French Commander (Marmont),\r\nin his eagerness to intercept Wellington's line of retreat, moved part\r\nof his force to the Heights of Miranda, thus threatening Wellington's\r\nright and rear, but leaving a gap of two miles between the detached\r\nforce and his main army.  Wellington noted the fresh disposition of\r\nMarmont's army through his telescope, and exclaiming, \"That will do!\"\r\nhe abandoned all idea of the withdrawal which had been forced upon him\r\nby Marmont's previous manoeuvres, and hurled part of his force against\r\nthe detached body (which was defeated before Marmont could send\r\nassistance) and at the same time barred the progress of the main army,\r\nwhich was forced to leave the field.  Wellington afterwards declared,\r\n\"I never saw an army receive such a beating.\"  If the Spanish General\r\nin alliance with Wellington had not, contrary to the most explicit\r\ninstructions, evacuated the Castle of Alba de Tormes (which commanded\r\nthe fords over which the French retreated), \"not one-third of Marmont's\r\narmy would have escaped\" (Napier).\r\n\r\nAs at Salamanca, where the liberty of manoeuvre which had been won by\r\nthe Strategy of Marmont was wrested from him by the Tactics of\r\nWellington, so at the final phase of the _First Battle of the Marne_\r\n(September, 1914), the initiative was regained by tactical adroitness.\r\nRapidity of action was the great German asset, while that of Russia was\r\nan inexhaustible supply of troops.  To obtain a quick decision the\r\nGermans went to every length.  Of the main routes for the invasion of\r\nFrance chosen for their armies, two led through the neutral territories\r\nof Luxemburg and Belgium, and only one through France, and their\r\nadvance there broke {28} down, almost at the first, at the only point\r\nwhere it was legitimately conducted, for the German armies failed to\r\npierce the French Front at the Gap of Charmes (Vosges), and their\r\ndefeat at the _Battle of Baccarat_ (August 25, 1914) led to the\r\ndecisive defeat at the First Battle of the Marne.  They then abandoned,\r\nfor the moment, all hopes of a quick decision in a war of manoeuvre and\r\nretiring to their prepared lines of defence on the Aisne, relied upon\r\nmethodically prepared and regularly constructed trench systems, and\r\nupon the hand grenade, the trench mortar, and the other weapons of\r\nclose combat, for superiority in a long campaign of trench siege\r\nwarfare, which endured until the collapse of Russia in 1917 freed for\r\nan offensive movement on the requisite scale in 1918 upwards of\r\n1,500,000 men.  At the _First Battle of the Marne_, the five German\r\narmies, which were following up the Franco-British left and centre,\r\nwere extended from Amiens to Verdun, but on September 8, 1914, the\r\nGerman I. Army (General von Kluck) was so placed by the impetuosity of\r\nthe march that a wide gap separated it from the remainder of the German\r\nforces.  To the north-west of Paris a new French Army, collected from\r\nthe Metropolitan garrison and from the south-eastern frontier, had been\r\nassembled and pushed out in motor transports by the zeal and\r\nintelligence of the Military Governor of Paris (General Gallieni); and\r\nto avoid this menace to his flank and line of communications, and to\r\nregain touch with the other German armies, one of which (under the\r\nCrown Prince) was unsuccessfully engaged in battle, General von Kluck\r\nadopted the extremely hazardous course of a flank march, across the\r\nfront of the Franco-British left wing.  Upon receiving intelligence of\r\nthis manoeuvre from the Air Service in Paris, General Joffre, seeing\r\nthe opportunity of gaining the initiative, ordered an advance to the\r\nattack on September 6, and the First Battle of the Marne, which\r\nresulted from this order, changed the character of the fighting on the\r\n{29} Western Front.  The decisive blow was strategical rather than\r\ntactical.  It was delivered on a battlefield of 6,000 square miles, and\r\ninvolved, throughout that area, a struggle of six great armies,\r\nnumbering in all 700,000 troops, against a similar number of armies of\r\nat least equal strength.  No counter-attack on such a scale had\r\npreviously been delivered in any campaign, and the scarcely interrupted\r\nadvance of the German armies received a permanent check, while the\r\nstrategic aim of the German Staff, namely, the speedy annihilation in\r\nthe field of the Franco-British armies, had to be definitely abandoned.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE BATTLE.--The \"atmosphere\" of battle is thus depicted\r\nin \"The Science of War\": \"When two armies are face to face and one is\r\nsuperior in numbers to the other, the commander of the smaller army is\r\nconfronted by two problems.  If the superior army is not yet\r\nconcentrated, or is so distributed that the different parts cannot\r\nreadily support each other, it may be defeated in detail.  If the\r\nsuperior army is already concentrated, its commander may be induced, by\r\none means or another, to make detachments, and thus to be weak\r\neverywhere.  The first problem is solved by rapidity of manoeuvre,\r\nsurprise marches, secrecy, feints to bewilder the adversary in his\r\nconcentration, and action on unexpected lines.  The second, by skilful\r\nthreatening of points for the defence of which the adversary will\r\ndetach forces; by concealment of his dispositions; and by drawing the\r\nadversary into terrain where part only of his superior forces can be\r\nemployed.\"  \"The power of striking 'like a bolt from the blue' is of\r\nthe greatest value in war.  Surprise was the foundation of almost all\r\nthe great strategical combinations of the past, as it will be of those\r\nto come.  The first thought and the last of the great general is to\r\noutwit his adversary and to strike where he is least expected.  To what\r\nFederal soldier did it occur on the {30} morning of _Chancellorsville_\r\n(May 2-8, 1863) that Lee, confronted by 90,000 Northerners, would\r\ndetach Stonewall Jackson with more than half his own force of 43,000 to\r\nattack his adversary in the rear\" (\"The Science of War\").  Surprise was\r\nthe chief cause of success in the _First Battle of Cambrai_ (November\r\n20, 1917) when General Sir Julian Byng launched the III. Army at dawn\r\nagainst the highly organised defensive position known as the\r\n\"Hindenburg Line.\"  The wire entanglements in front of this position\r\nwere exceptionally deep, and had not been broken by gun-fire.  Behind\r\nthem the Germans were resting in apparent security and such information\r\nas they were able to obtain by raiding reconnaissances was not\r\ncorroborated by the fierce and prolonged artillery bombardment which\r\nwas at that time regarded as the inseparable prelude to an attack in\r\nforce.  The advance was preceded by battalions of Tanks, with Infantry\r\nin close support, and was followed by Cavalry, to round up fugitives\r\nand disorganise reinforcements.  The artillery had previously been\r\nstrengthened and was directed against the support and reserve lines, to\r\nprevent the Germans from massing for counter-attacks and to break up\r\ntheir formations.  Aircraft carried out reconnaissance during the\r\nbattle from a low altitude and harassed the defenders with fire action.\r\nAn advance was made into the strongest part of the German defensive\r\nsystem on a twenty-mile front to a depth of five miles, and secured\r\nupwards of 11,000 prisoners, 150 guns, and considerable quantities of\r\nstores and materials, and although after-events neutralised the initial\r\nsuccesses, the advance of November 20, 1917, will ever remain an\r\nexample of the value of surprise in war.  \"Surprise strikes with terror\r\neven those who are by far the stronger.  A new weapon of war may ensure\r\nit, or a sudden appearance of a force larger than the adversary's, or a\r\nconcentration of forces upon a point at which the adversary is not\r\nready instantaneously to parry the blow.  But if the methods {31} be\r\nvarious, the aim is always to produce the same moral effect upon the\r\nenemy--terror--by creating in him at the swift apparition of unexpected\r\nand incontestably powerful means, the sentiment of impotence, the\r\nconviction that he cannot conquer--that is to say, that he is\r\nconquered.  And this supreme blow of unexpected vigour need not be\r\ndirected upon the whole of the enemy's army.  For an army is an animate\r\nand organised being, a collection of organs, of which the loss even of\r\na single one leads to death\" (Marshal Foch).  At almost any period of\r\nthe battle, and in almost every phase of fighting, surprise can be\r\nbrought about by a sudden and unexpected outburst of effective machine\r\ngun or other form of fire.  \"A sudden effective fire will have a\r\nparticularly demoralising effect on the enemy; it is often\r\nadvantageous, therefore, to seek for surprise effects of this sort by\r\ntemporarily withholding fire\" (\"Infantry Training, 1921\").\r\n\r\nTHE DECISIVE BLOW.--The preparatory action and the development usually\r\ntake the form of a converging movement of separated forces, so timed as\r\nto strike the adversary's front and flank simultaneously, in order to\r\nthreaten the enemy's line of communications, for the line of supply is\r\nas vital to the existence of an army as the heart to the life of a\r\nhuman being.  \"Perhaps no situation is more pitiable than that of a\r\ncommander who has permitted an enemy to sever his communications.  He\r\nsees the end of his resources at hand, but not the means to replenish\r\nthem\" (General Sir E. B. Hamley).  The decisive blow will be delivered\r\nby the General Reserve, which will be secretly concentrated and\r\nlaunched as secretly as possible; and the commander of the whole force\r\nwill so distribute his troops that about half his available force can\r\nbe kept in hand for this decisive blow, on a part of the enemy's front\r\nif sufficient penetration has been effected, or on a flank.  The point\r\nchosen becomes the vital {32} point, and success there means success at\r\nall points.  Once routed, the enemy must be relentlessly pursued and\r\nprevented from regaining order and moral.\r\n\r\nA battle was fought in the year B.C. 331, nearly 2,300 years ago, at\r\nArbela,[1] in Mesopotamia, the Eastern theatre of operations in the\r\nGreat War of 1914-18, and it deserves study to show the eternal nature\r\nof the main principles which underlie the Art of War.  Alexander the\r\nGreat invaded the territories of Darius, King of the Medes and\r\nPersians, with the strategic aim of defeating his adversary's main\r\narmies in a decisive battle.  The Macedonian forces were preceded by an\r\nAdvanced Guard of Cavalry, and from information obtained by the\r\nVanguard, Alexander was made aware of the strength and position of the\r\nPersian forces.  By a careful reconnaissance of the ground in company\r\nwith his Corps Commanders, Alexander was able to forestall a projected\r\nmovement, and by advancing in two lines of battle in such a way that\r\nhis troops could at any moment be thrown into a compact figure fringed\r\nwith spears, which formed an impenetrable hedge against cavalry, he\r\nfound a remedy for the disadvantages of the ground, which afforded no\r\nprotection to either of his flanks.  After advancing in these two lines\r\nAlexander manoeuvred his troops into a phalanx, or wedge-shaped figure,\r\nand this wedge he drove into the masses of the enemy to force the wings\r\nasunder.  In spite of local reverses in parts of the field, the depth\r\nand weight of the main attack carried it through the enemy's forces:\r\nthe survivors were captured or dispersed, and the victory was complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The site of this battle was probably Gaugamela, about 60 miles from\r\nthe present Arbil, which is 40 miles from Mosul, on the Baghdad road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\nHOW BATTLES ARE INFLUENCED\r\n\r\nOnce troops are launched in battle their success or failure depends\r\nupon such influences as the commander can bring to bear, upon the\r\nco-operation of his subordinate commanders, and upon the moral and\r\ntraining of the troops engaged.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMANDER'S INFLUENCE is shown, first in his orders for the\r\noperations, and later by the method in which he employs the forces\r\nretained in his hand for the decisive blow.  Personal control, by the\r\ncommander, of troops committed to battle, is not only impossible but\r\nshould be unnecessary, as such control and leading is the function of\r\nhis subordinates, who should be fully acquainted with his intentions\r\nand must be trusted to carry them into execution.  Other, and more\r\nimportant, duties have to be undertaken by the commander, and it is\r\nessential that he should not allow his attention to be diverted from\r\nhis main object by local incidents, which are matters for his\r\nsubordinates to deal with.  \"A sound system of command is based upon\r\nthree facts: an army cannot be effectively controlled by direct orders\r\nfrom headquarters; the man on the spot is the best judge of the\r\nsituation; intelligent co-operation is of infinitely more value than\r\nmechanical obedience\" (\"The Science of War\").  A campaign resolves\r\nitself into a struggle between human intelligences.  Each commander\r\nwill endeavour to defeat his adversary in battle, and his principal\r\nweapon is his General Reserve.  If he can exhaust the reserve power of\r\nhis adversary, while maintaining his own intact, he can proceed to\r\nvictory at his own time, and he will endeavour to exhaust the hostile\r\nreserves by causing {34} them to be thrown in piecemeal, in ignorance\r\nof the spot where the decisive blow is to fall.  During the campaign on\r\nthe Western Front in 1918 the Allies were able to conserve their\r\nstrength throughout the attacks from March 21 to July 15, and when they\r\npassed from the guard to the thrust they extended their front of attack\r\nfrom day to day, calculating correctly that this gradual extension\r\nwould mislead the enemy as to where the main blow would fall, and would\r\ncause him to throw in his reserves piecemeal.\r\n\r\n\"The subordinate commanders must bring to fruit with all the means at\r\ntheir disposal the scheme of the higher command, therefore they must,\r\nabove all, understand that thought and then make of their means the use\r\nbest suited to circumstances--of which, however, they are the only\r\njudge. . . .  The Commander-in-Chief cannot take the place of his\r\nsubordinates--he cannot think and decide for them.  In order to think\r\nstraight and to decide rightly it would be necessary for him to see\r\nthrough their eyes, to look at things from the place in which they\r\nactually stand, to be everywhere at the same moment\" (Marshal Foch).\r\nStudents of military history will remember that the Prussian\r\nCommander-in-Chief and his Chief Staff Officer, during the highly\r\nsuccessful campaign of 1870-71, did not come within sound of the guns\r\nuntil five pitched battles had been fought by their subordinate\r\ncommanders.  Outside the fog of battle, with its absorbing interests\r\nand distractions, the commander can retain his sense of proportion[1]\r\nand can decide where and when he will make his final effort.  News of\r\nthe battle reaches him from his immediate subordinates, and from the\r\naccounts of successes and failures he is able to judge the weaknesses\r\nand strength of his own and his adversary's dispositions, to use part\r\nof his reserves as reinforcements, {35} if he must, or to husband them\r\nwith confidence in the success of the operations, until the time comes\r\nfor him to launch them for the final blow.\r\n\r\nINFORMATION.--In order that the commander's influence may be exerted to\r\nthe best advantage it is essential that all vital information should\r\nreach him promptly, and that his orders should be communicated without\r\ndelay.  Subordinate commanders must keep their superiors and commanders\r\nof neighbouring units regularly informed as to the progress of the\r\nbattle, and of important changes in the situation as they occur.\r\nRunners, who can be trusted to carry a verbal message or written order,\r\nare attached to each unit engaged and to its headquarters.  Higher\r\nunits than battalions can usually depend on the Signal Service for\r\nintercommunication, but whenever necessary, a supply of runners and\r\nmounted orderlies must be available for their use.  This ensures\r\nco-operation, and enables mutual support to be rendered.  Information\r\nreceived must be transmitted at once to all whom it concerns, and\r\norders received from superiors must be communicated without delay to\r\ncommanders of all units affected.\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION.--\"Co-operation when in contact with the enemy is no easy\r\nmatter to bring about.  There are, however, three means of overcoming\r\nthe difficulty: constant communication between the units; thorough\r\nreconnaissance of the ground over which the movements are to be made;\r\nclear and well-considered orders\" (\"The Science of War\").  Each\r\ncommander who issues orders for Attack or Defence should assemble his\r\nsubordinate commanders, if possible in view of the ground over which\r\nthe troops are to operate, explain his orders, and satisfy himself that\r\neach subordinate understands his respective task.  \"Combination depends\r\non the efficiency of the chain of control connecting the brain of the\r\ncommander through all grades down to the {36} corporal's squad; on the\r\nintelligence of subordinate leaders in grasping and applying the\r\ncommander's plans; on the discipline which ensures intelligent\r\nobedience to the directing will; and on the mobility which gives rapid\r\neffect to that will, and permits advantage to be taken of fleeting\r\nopportunities.  Every fresh development in the means of transmitting\r\norders and information rapidly, permits of an extension of the\r\ncommander's influence, and makes more perfect combination possible and\r\nover wider areas\" (General Sir E. B. Hamley).  Even when, and\r\nparticularly when, forces are engaged in battle, reconnaissance must be\r\ncarried on and information gained must be communicated at once.  It\r\nwill frequently happen that a suitable moment for the decisive attack,\r\nor decisive counter-stroke, will be found only after long and severe\r\nfighting.  Systematic arrangements for obtaining, sifting, and\r\ntransmitting information throughout the battle are therefore of the\r\nhighest importance.  Information must be gained not only by troops and\r\naircraft actually engaged, but by supports and reserves, who will often\r\nbe able to see what is invisible to the forward troops.  In such cases,\r\nmore than in any other, information must be communicated at once.  By\r\nintelligent observation superintending commanders can co-operate with\r\none another, can anticipate situations as they develop, and decide at\r\nthe time what steps will be necessary to meet them.  A general\r\nreconnaissance will be in progress during every modern battle by\r\nobservers in aircraft and in observation balloons.  In addition, local\r\nreconnaissance by means of patrols and scouts will usually discover an\r\nopening that might otherwise be lost, and may warn a commander of an\r\nintended movement against him, which might otherwise develop into a\r\ndisagreeable surprise.\r\n\r\nCo-operation and Mutual Support were developed in their highest form by\r\nthe Allied Corps Commanders in the _First Battle of the Marne_\r\n(August-September, 1914).  {37} In this campaign close on 1,500,000\r\ntroops were engaged on both sides, and the Corps Commanders,\r\nparticularly those of the French VI. Army (Manoury), III. Army\r\n(Sarrail), and the Military Governor of Paris (Gallieni), were\r\ncontinuously in touch with one another, and frequently rendered\r\nassistance, unasked, by fire and by movement.  Co-operation of a novel\r\nkind was exhibited on a minor scale during the First Battle of the\r\nSomme.  An attack was launched on _Gueudecourt_ (September 26, 1916) by\r\nthe 21st Division, and a protecting trench was captured as a\r\npreliminary to the larger movement.  A tank, followed up by infantry\r\nbombers, proceeded along the parapet of the trench firing its machine\r\nguns, while an aeroplane swooped over the trench firing its Lewis guns.\r\nThe survivors in the trench surrendered, and the garrison was collected\r\nby supporting infantry, who advanced in response to signals from the\r\naeroplane.\r\n\r\nFIRE TACTICS.--It has already been noted that the battle is the only\r\nargument of war; it is also the final test of training, and on the\r\nbattlefield no part of the syllabus is more severely tested than that\r\ndevoted to _musketry_.  The fire tactics of an army, its combination of\r\nfire and movement, the direction and control by the leaders and the\r\nfire discipline of the rank and file, make for success or failure on\r\nthe field of battle.  The fire must be directed by the fire unit\r\ncommander against an objective chosen with intelligence and accurately\r\ndefined; it must be controlled by the sub-unit commander, who must be\r\nable to recognise the objectives indicated, to regulate the rate of\r\nfire, and to keep touch with the state of the ammunition supply.  Fire\r\ndiscipline must be maintained, so that there is the strictest\r\ncompliance with verbal orders and signals, and application on the\r\nbattlefield of the habits inculcated during the training period.  The\r\ntime when fire is to be opened is often left to the discretion of the\r\nfire-unit commander, but, generally speaking, fire should be opened by\r\nan {38} attacking force only when a further advance without opening\r\nfire is impossible; and even in defence, when access to the ammunition\r\nreserve is likely to be far easier than in an attack, withholding fire\r\nuntil close range is reached is generally more effective than opening\r\nat a longer range.  The tactical value of a withering fire at close\r\nrange from a hitherto passive defender has again and again been proved\r\nin battle.  On the _Heights of Abraham_ (September 13, 1759) General\r\nWolfe had assembled his troops and he awaited Montcalm's attack.  Not a\r\nshot was fired by the defenders until the attacking force was within\r\nforty paces, and three minutes later a bayonet charge into the broken\r\nfoe swept the French helplessly before it.  At the _Battle of Bunker\r\nHill_ (June 17, 1775) the American colonists inflicted a loss of 46 per\r\ncent. on the assaulting British force, by reserving their fire \"until\r\nthe badges and buttons of the tunics could be clearly identified.\"  At\r\nthe _Battle of Fredericksburg_ (December 13, 1862) General Meagher's\r\nIrish Brigade of the U.S. Army of the Potomac assaulted Marye's Hill,\r\n1,200 strong.  The defending Confederates reserved their fire until the\r\nassailants were 100 yards from their position and drove them off with a\r\nloss of 937 out of the 1,200.  In August, 1914, the British Regular\r\nArmy, during the _Retreat from Mons_, reserved their fire until the\r\nGermans arrived at the most deadly point of their rifles' trajectory,\r\nand again and again drove off all except the dead and mortally wounded.\r\nThroughout the Great War, troops fully trained in the British system of\r\nmusketry and using the short magazine Lee Enfield rifle, proved beyond\r\ndispute the values of the system and of the weapon.  In a review of the\r\nmethods adopted to check the great German offensive in the spring of\r\n1918, a circular issued by the General Staff states: \"Rapid rifle fire\r\nwas the decisive factor in these operations.  The men had confidence in\r\ntheir rifles and knew how to use them.\"\r\n\r\nSuperiority of fire can only be gained by the close {39} co-operation\r\nof the artillery and infantry at every stage of the battle, and unless\r\ninfantry co-operate, the artillery is not likely to produce any\r\ndecisive effect.  Long-range machine-gun fire is an important auxiliary\r\nto the artillery in covering and supporting the advance of attacking\r\ninfantry.  Enfilade fire, the most telling of all, is more easily\r\nbrought to bear than of old owing to the increase in the effective\r\nrange and in the rate of fire.  Supports and local reserves will\r\nusually co-operate most effectively with forward troops by bringing\r\nfire to bear upon the flank of such bodies of the enemy as are holding\r\nup a movement by frontal fire.  During the counter-attack for the\r\nrecapture of _The Bluff_, in the Ypres Salient (March 2, 1916) by\r\ntroops of the 3rd and 17th Divisions, the right and centre gained their\r\nobjectives.  The left attacking party, at the first attempt, failed to\r\nreach the German trenches, but those who had penetrated to the German\r\nline on the right realised the situation and brought a Lewis gun to\r\nbear on the enemy's line of resistance, completely enfilading his\r\ntrenches, and thus enabling the left company to reach its goal.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT.--The influence of movement is inseparable from that of fire,\r\nas it enables fire to be opened and is a means of escaping the full\r\neffects of fire; while it is often possible to move one unit only in\r\nconjunction with the fire of another.  It can also be used to relieve\r\none unit from the effects of fire concentrated upon it by moving\r\nanother unit against the enemy.  A steady and rapid advance of troops\r\nhas the twofold effect of closing to a range from which an ascendency\r\nin the fire-fight can be secured, and also of reducing the losses of\r\nthe advancing force, for if the troops remained stationary in the open\r\nunder heavy fire, at a known range, the losses would clearly be greater\r\nthan if they advanced, and would be suffered without gaining ground\r\ntowards the objective, while the closer the {40} assaulting line gets\r\nto the objective, and the steadier its advance, the less confidence\r\nwill the enemy have in their power to stem the advance, and the fewer\r\ncasualties will be suffered in consequence.  No \"sealed pattern\" is\r\nlaid down as to the movement and formation of infantry under fire, but\r\ncertain definite principles are put forward in the text-books.  Where\r\nsecurity is the first need, as in the case of protecting forces\r\n(advanced, flank, or rear guards), movement should be effected by\r\nbounds from one tactical position to another under covering fire from\r\nsupporting troops; where the objective is the primary consideration,\r\nsecurity must be subordinated to the need of reaching the objective.\r\nAgainst artillery fire, or long-range infantry fire, the formation\r\nrecommended by the text-books is small shallow columns, each on a\r\nnarrow front, such as platoons in fours or sections in file, arranged\r\non an irregular front, so that the range from the enemy's guns to each\r\nis different.  Troops coming suddenly under such fire will avoid\r\ncasualties more easily by moving forward and outwards in this way\r\nrather than by remaining under such cover as may be improvised in a\r\nposition the exact range of which is obviously known to the enemy.\r\nAgainst effective machine-gun or rifle fire deployment into line, or\r\ninto \"arrowhead\" formation with the flanks thrown well back, is\r\npreferable to a single line extended at so many paces interval, as it\r\nis scarcely more vulnerable and is infinitely easier to control.\r\n\r\nIn retiring, losses are generally heavier than in advancing, or in\r\nmaintaining a fire-fight from the position gained until a diversion by\r\nsupporting troops enables a further bound to be made.  The enemy is\r\ngenerally able to deliver a well-directed stream of lead against\r\nretiring troops, mainly because he is less harassed by the return fire.\r\nRetirements must therefore be carried out on the principle of alternate\r\nbounds under covering fire of co-operating bodies, which withdraw, in\r\ntheir turn, under covering fire from the troops they have protected.\r\n{41} Such alternate retirements are the essence of rear-guard tactics,\r\nbut, although certain other phases of battle action justify the\r\nwithdrawal of troops, it must always be remembered that a position held\r\nagainst counter-attack is better than a position captured by assault,\r\nfor it is a position that does not require to be assaulted.  It is\r\noften impossible to predict the value of resistance at a particular\r\npoint, and the fate of a nation may depend upon a platoon commander's\r\ngrit in holding on at all costs.  In the campaign of 1814,\r\nBrigadier-General Moreau was sent to the _Fortress of Soissons_, with\r\ninstructions to hold the town.  His garrison consisted of about 1,200\r\nall arms, with 20 guns.  At 10.30 a.m. on March 2, the fortress was\r\nbombarded by Winzingerode's Russians and Bülow's Prussians, and at 8\r\np.m. an assault was delivered.  This was easily repulsed and a\r\ncounter-attack threw back the assailants to their own lines.  The\r\nbombardment was resumed until 10 p.m., when the garrison had a total\r\nloss of 23 killed and 123 wounded.  During the night the besiegers sent\r\na flag of truce to Moreau, and on March 3 that general capitulated with\r\nall the honours of war \"in order to preserve 1,000 fighting men for the\r\nEmperor.\"  His action cost Napoleon his throne, for had Moreau held out\r\nthe Emperor would have crushed his most implacable foe, Blücher (who\r\nescaped from the toils in which he was enmeshed, _viâ_ the bridge at\r\nSoissons), and the campaign would have been at an end.  If Moreau had\r\nexhausted all the means of defence, as the regulations of war ordain,\r\nhe could certainly have held out for another 48 hours, and as heavy\r\nfiring was audible in the vicinity it should have been clear to him\r\nthat help was at hand.  At the _First Battle of Ypres_ (October\r\n20-November 20, 1914) the Regular Army of the United Kingdom, at the\r\noutset, was filling so extensive a gap in the defensive line, that in\r\nmany parts there was but one rifle for 17 yards of front, and there\r\nwere neither local nor general reserves.  The {42} assaulting German\r\nforces greatly outnumbered the defenders and brought up machine guns\r\nand artillery in overpowering strength.  The British artillery was not\r\nonly overweighted but was so short of ammunition that Marshal French\r\nwas compelled to limit their daily number of rounds.  But the line was\r\nheld, and a counter-attack, headed by the 2nd Battalion of the\r\nWorcestershire Regiment, on October 31, with the bayonet, restored the\r\nline at _Gheluvelt_, at the most critical moment of the battle, and the\r\nGermans did not get through the defences.  This stubborn resistance\r\nthrew the Germans behind their entrenchments, and the \"Advance to\r\nCalais\" was stemmed by French's \"Contemptible Little Army.\"  At the\r\n_Second Battle of Ypres_ (April 22-May 18, 1915) surprise in the time\r\nand nature of the attack, by the secret concentration of forces and the\r\nintroduction of poison gas, gained an initial advantage for the Germans\r\nand left the British flank uncovered.  A Canadian division\r\ncounter-attacked on the German flank, and by May 18 the Allies had\r\nregained many of the captured positions.  During the First Battle of\r\nthe Somme troops of the Royal West Kent and the Queen's Regiments\r\neffected a lodgment in _Trônes Wood_ (July 14, 1916).  They maintained\r\ntheir position all night in the northern corner of the wood, although\r\ncompletely surrounded by the enemy, and assisted in the final capture\r\nand clearance of the wood at 8 a.m. the next day.  Similar instances\r\noccurred in _Bourlon Village_ (November 25-27, 1917) when parties of\r\nthe 13th East Surrey Regiment held out in the south-east corner of the\r\nvillage, during a German counter-attack, and maintained their position\r\nuntil touch was re-established with them 48 hours later; and in a group\r\nof fortified farms south of _Polygon Wood_ (September 26, 1917) during\r\nthe Third Battle of Ypres, when two companies of the Argyll and\r\nSutherland Highlanders held out all night, although isolated from the\r\nrest of the 33rd and 39th Divisions, until a renewed attack {43}\r\ncleared the district of hostile forces.  On April 9, 1918, during the\r\nGermans' desperate endeavours to break through the investing Allies'\r\nlines, the ruins of _Givenchy_ were held by the 55th West Lancashire\r\n(Territorial) Division, and the right edge of the neck through which\r\nvon Arnim and von Quast hoped to extend, in order to widen the wedge\r\ninto the Valley of the Lys, was firmly held, while the left edge (the\r\nMessines Ridge) was recaptured by a counter-attack by the 9th Division.\r\nThe centre of the line was also stoutly held by the Guards' and other\r\ndivisions, many of which had suffered heavy losses in the V. Army\r\nduring the German attack in the last week of March.  After 21 days of\r\nthe most stubborn fighting (March 21-April 11, 1918) of which the\r\n_Attack on the Lys_ had formed part, Marshal Sir D. Haig issued an\r\norder of the day emphasising the value of holding each position at all\r\ncosts.  \"Every position must be held to the last man.  There must be no\r\nretirement. . . .  The safety of our homes and the freedom of mankind\r\ndepend alike upon the conduct of each one of us at this critical\r\nmoment. . . .  Victory will belong to the side which holds out\r\nlongest.\"  Sir D. Haig's after-order, on April 23, 1918 (St. George's\r\nDay), awarded special praise to the troops under his command.  The\r\nnumber of divisions employed by the Germans from March 21 to April 23,\r\n1918, against the British alone was 102 (approximately 1,500,000\r\ntroops), and many of them were thrown in twice or three times.  \"In\r\nresisting the heavy blows which such a concentration of troops has\r\nenabled the enemy to direct against the British Army, all ranks, arms,\r\nand services have behaved with a gallantry, courage, and resolution for\r\nwhich no praise can be too high\" (Haig's Dispatch).\r\n\r\nCOVERING FIRE.--The energetic and determined support of the infantry by\r\nfire is the main duty of machine-gun units throughout the whole course\r\nof the battle.  In the attack, machine-gun platoons, Lewis gun\r\nsections, {44} or rifle sections detailed to give covering fire, must\r\ntake care to select as targets those bodies of the enemy whose fire is\r\nchiefly checking the advance.  Machine-gun platoons are sometimes\r\nbrigaded, and at others left to battalion commanders, and their action\r\nafter a temporary success in providing covering fire may depend upon\r\ntheir tactical distribution at the time.  Infantry platoons detailed to\r\ngive covering fire must join in the advance as soon as their own fire\r\nceases to be effective in aiding the forward troops, unless definite\r\norders to the contrary have been received.\r\n\r\nFIRE AND MOVEMENT.--It is thus seen that Fire and Movement are\r\ninseparably associated, and judiciously employed in combination they\r\nenable infantry to achieve its object in battle, to bring such a\r\nsuperiority of fire to bear as to make an advance to close quarters\r\npossible, so that the enemy may be induced to surrender or may be\r\noverwhelmed by a bayonet assault; and to prepare by similar means for\r\nfurther advances, until the enemy is entirely hemmed in or completely\r\nrouted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In fiction, this point (that the generalissimo must not allow his\r\nsense of proportion to be distorted by local successes or reverses) is\r\nclearly brought out in _The Point of View_, a story in \"The Green\r\nCurve\" by Ole-Luk-Oie (General Swinton).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{45}\r\n\r\nTYPES OF BATTLE ACTION\r\n\r\nA battle must practically always be of the nature of Attack and\r\nDefence, but the attitude originally assumed by either of the opposing\r\nforces may be reversed during an engagement.  A vigorous counter-attack\r\nby an army offering battle in a defensive position may throw the\r\nadversary on the defensive, while an assailant may fight a delaying\r\naction in one part of the field, although in another part his action\r\nmay be essentially offensive.  There are three distinct systems of\r\nBattle Action: the entirely defensive; the entirely offensive; and the\r\ncombined, or defensive-offensive system.\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENSIVE BATTLE has seldom effected positive results, except,\r\nperhaps, at _Gettysburg_ (July 1-3, 1863), where Meade permitted Lee to\r\nbreak his forces against a strong position, with the result that the\r\nArmy of Northern Virginia had to withdraw, and the invasion of the\r\nNorth came to an end.  It must, however, be borne in mind that General\r\nLee was badly served by his subordinate, and General Meade's success\r\nwas largely due to this factor.  On the second day of Gettysburg (July\r\n2, 1863), General J. B. Hood's 1st Division of General J. Longstreet's\r\nI. Army Corps was deploying round the left of the Federal Army south of\r\nthe Round Tops.  He saw a chance to strike and requested permission\r\nfrom Longstreet.  Hood's plan was the only one which gave a reasonable\r\nchance of decisive victory with the troops available.  Longstreet, in\r\nobedience to the letter of his orders, but contrary to their spirit,\r\nrefused to sanction Hood's advance.  Longstreet's failure to seize a\r\nfleeting opportunity sounded the death-knell of the Confederate cause.\r\n\r\n{46}\r\n\r\nBurnside was defeated at _Fredericksburg_ (December 10-16, 1862) by\r\npurely defensive tactics, but Lee had intended to follow up his victory\r\nby a decisive counter-blow, which Burnside escaped by extricating the\r\nArmy of the Potomac before the blow fell.  Success, even to the limited\r\ndegree achieved by Meade or Lee, seldom follows the adoption of purely\r\ndefensive tactics.  \"There is no such thing as an 'impregnable\r\nposition,' for any position the defence of which is merely passive is\r\nbound to be carried at last by a manoeuvring enemy\" (Marshal Foch).\r\n\r\nTHE OFFENSIVE BATTLE.--The Entirely Offensive system has been employed\r\nby many of the greatest commanders, including Marlborough at _Blenheim_\r\n(August 2, 1704), _Ramillies_ (May 23, 1706), and _Malplaquet_\r\n(September 11, 1709); Frederick the Great, notably at _Leuthen_\r\n(December 5, 1757); Napoleon, Wellington, and Grant, as also by the\r\nPrussian generals at almost every engagement in the campaigns of 1866\r\nand 1870-71.  The disadvantage of the system is that lack of success\r\nmay entail not only a local disaster but the wreck and annihilation of\r\nthe whole army.\r\n\r\nAt the _Battle of Blenheim_ (August 2, 1704), Marlborough, \"the\r\ngreatest captain of his age,\" had concentrated his forces with those of\r\nPrince Eugene of Savoy the previous day and commanded an army of 56,000\r\nmen with 52 guns.  He was confronted by the joint armies of Marshal\r\nTallard and the Elector of Bavaria, amounting to 60,000 men with 61\r\nguns.  It was necessary for Marlborough to attack before Villeroy\r\njoined the enemy, or to withdraw until a more favourable opportunity\r\npresented itself.  The right flank of his opponents rested on high\r\nhills, which were protected by detached posts, and the left flank on\r\nthe Danube, while opposite the centre was the marshy valley of the\r\nRiver Nebel, with several branches running through the swampy ground.\r\nMarlborough decided that a battle {47} was absolutely necessary and he\r\nattacked the next day.  Like Hannibal, he relied principally on his\r\ncavalry for achieving his decisive success, and this predilection was\r\nknown to the opposing commanders.  He attacked the enemy's right and\r\nleft wings, and when heavily engaged with varying fortunes launched his\r\ndecisive attack against the centre, where the difficulties of the\r\nground caused it to be least expected.  Marlborough lost 5,000 killed\r\nand 8,000 wounded.  The vanquished armies were almost destroyed, at\r\nleast 40,000 being accounted for, with 12,000 killed, 14,000 wounded\r\nand missing, and 14,000 prisoners.\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENSIVE-OFFENSIVE BATTLE.--The Defensive-Offensive system\r\nconsists in taking up a position which the enemy must attack, and in\r\ndelivering a decisive counter-stroke when the adversary has exhausted\r\nhis strength.  This system has been employed in almost every campaign.\r\nBy such means Napoleon achieved his classic victories of _Marengo_\r\n(June 14, 1800), _Austerlitz_ (December 2, 1805), and _Dresden_ (August\r\n27, 1813); and Wellington his Peninsular victories at _Vittoria_ (June\r\n21, 1813), _Orthez_ (February 27, 1814), and _Toulouse_ (April 10,\r\n1814), in addition to his final triumph at _Waterloo_ (June 18, 1815);\r\nand it was the method adopted by Marshal Foch in the decisive campaign\r\nof 1918, which endured from March until the Armistice in November.\r\n\r\nAt the _Battle of Waterloo_ (June 18, 1815), the decisive\r\ncounter-stroke was delivered, in accordance with Wellington's\r\npre-arranged plan, by a force coming from a distance to the scene of\r\naction.  On the morning of June 17, when Wellington resolved to make a\r\nstand at Waterloo, he was aware that the Prussians, who were mostly\r\nyoung troops, had been beaten at Ligny; that Napoleon had, before that\r\nbattle, over 120,000 men, and that he himself had, all told, 68,000, of\r\nwhom 31,000, including the King's German Legion, were {48} British.\r\nYet he withdrew from Quatre Bras with the full determination of\r\nstanding at Waterloo and of fighting Napoleon's army, if Marshal\r\nBlücher would come to his assistance with one Army Corps.  Napoleon\r\nattacked on June 18 with 72,000 men and 246 guns, against Wellington's\r\n68,000 men with 156 guns, at 11 a.m., but he was unable to shift the\r\nline or break through the squares.  At 4.30 p.m. one of Blücher's corps\r\nwas delivering the promised counter-attack against Napoleon's line of\r\ncommunications.  Soon after 9 p.m.  Wellington and Blücher met at La\r\nBelle Alliance, Napoleon's headquarters before the battle, and the\r\npursuit was in full swing.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for restoring the battle and for turning impending defeat\r\ninto a crushing victory are frequently offered during an engagement.\r\nGeneral Lee's thin lines at _Antietam_ or _Sharpsburg_ (September 17,\r\n1862), slowly fed by men jaded by heavy marching, were sorely pressed,\r\nbut there was a lull in the Federal attack when Hooker's advance was\r\nchecked.  Had General McClellan at that moment thrown in \"his last man\r\nand his last horse\" in a vigorous reinforcing attack, _Antietam_ would\r\nnot have been a drawn battle, and Lee would not have retired at his\r\nleisure into Virginia.  Lee's great victory at _Chancellorsville_ (May\r\n2-3, 1863), although marred by the accident which deprived him of\r\nStonewall Jackson, was a striking instance of the success of the\r\nDefensive-Offensive system at the hands of a great commander, who\r\ndefeated 90,000 troops with less than half that number, by a containing\r\ndefence with 13,000 men and a decisive counter-stroke with the\r\nremainder.\r\n\r\nBut while this combined system is regarded by most authorities as the\r\nbest, when circumstances warrant its adoption, it is the highest test\r\nof generalship to seize the right moment to pass from the guard to the\r\nthrust.  This is the problem which confronted Marshal Foch, the\r\ngeneralissimo of the Allied Forces, during the great {49} German\r\noffensive movement on the Western Front in 1918.  The defensive _rôle_\r\nendured from March 21 until July 17, 1918, and although many local\r\ncounter-attacks were made along the whole battle front, the Allies did\r\nnot pass from the guard to the thrust until the decisive counter-stroke\r\nwas commenced in the _Second Battle of the Marne_ (July 18, 1918) on a\r\nfront of 27 miles from Fontenoy to Belleau, which drove the Germans\r\nback across the Marne on July 20.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE (July 18, 1918).--The great German\r\noffensive of March-June, 1918, was renewed on July 15, when the\r\nartillery preparation opened shortly after midnight and troops were\r\npoured across the Marne in small boats and over pontoon bridges.  The\r\nattack was not unexpected.  Adequate reserves were ready and in place,\r\nand a heavy counter-bombardment on the German troops in their positions\r\nof assembly, close to their front-line trenches, caused heavy\r\ncasualties.  The Germans succeeded in penetrating the French and\r\nAmerican positions in parts of the 50-mile front to a maximum depth of\r\n4 miles south-west of Reims, but on the Plains of Champagne little\r\nprogress was made and the attack lost its momentum.  During the attack\r\nof March 21, 1918, the advance was not held up until it was within\r\nstriking distance of its ultimate objective, and the offensive on the\r\nAisne in May, 1918, secured an advance of 12 miles.  Captured documents\r\nshowed that the attack of July east of Reims was intended to reach the\r\nMarne at Eperney and Chalons, an advance of 21 miles.  A feature of the\r\nearlier days of the battle was a spirited counter-attack near Fossoy\r\n(on the extreme left of the German forces) by a division of the\r\nAmerican Army which thrust the Germans behind their first line and\r\ncaptured upwards of 1,000 prisoners, the ground regained in the river\r\nbend being consolidated and held by the American division.  The battle\r\ncontinued for three days before the German {50} attack was brought to a\r\nstandstill, and at 4.80 a.m. on July 18 a counter-attack by the French,\r\nAmerican, and Italian forces changed the whole aspect of the campaign,\r\nand led to the final triumph of the Allies and to the downfall of the\r\nCentral Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{51}\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACK\r\n\r\n\"Surprise is at all times the assailant's strongest weapon.\"--\"Field\r\nService Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1920).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of every commander who possesses the power of manoeuvre is to\r\nseek out the enemy and destroy his organised forces.  The Attack is the\r\nculminating point of all manoeuvres to this end, and every commander\r\nwill endeavour to achieve his aim by a sudden and unexpected assault on\r\na part of the enemy's defences.\r\n\r\nThe achievement of this aim is only possible when a commander has\r\nassembled a sufficient force for his purpose, and has obtained, by\r\nreconnaissance and by fighting, information as to the vulnerability of\r\nthe hostile position.  The commander will then endeavour to break the\r\nenemy's formation so suddenly as to disconcert all his plans; to retain\r\na compact force with which to follow up the blow without giving the\r\nenemy a moment's breathing space; to drive a wedge into the heart of\r\nhis disordered masses, forcing his wings asunder; and to pursue and\r\nannihilate the scattered forces of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Unless a decision is quickly obtained in the opening weeks of a modern\r\ncampaign the opposing armies tend to become immobile, chiefly owing to\r\nthe great power conferred on the defence by modern armaments.  The\r\narmies will then be distributed in great depth, and the attackers are\r\nfaced with the necessity of breaking through not one position only, but\r\na series of positions, extending back to a depth of several miles\"\r\n(\"Infantry Training, 1921\").\r\n\r\nPenetration, followed by the sundering of the Franco-British Armies,\r\nwas clearly the intention of the German {52} High Command in the\r\n_Second Battle of the Somme_, which opened on March 21, 1918.  The\r\nGerman Armies had entrenched themselves after the First Battle of the\r\nMarne (September, 1914), and for 43 months had been confronted by the\r\nAllied Nations of Britain, France, and Belgium, reinforced at the close\r\nby Portuguese troops and by the National Army of the United States.\r\n\r\nWithin the investing lines of the Western Front the German Armies were\r\nbesieged, the barrier reaching from the Belgian coast to the frontier\r\nof Switzerland, while the armies of Austria-Hungary were similarly\r\npenned in by the army of Italy, from Switzerland to the Adriatic.  The\r\ninternal collapse of Russia, in 1917, enabled von Hindenburg to assume\r\nthe offensive, with upwards of 1,500,000 men released from the Eastern\r\nFront, and part of this reserve power was projected, with the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Armies, in a fierce attack on the Italian lines.  The\r\nsuccess of this manoeuvre continued until reinforcements were\r\ndispatched from other parts of the Allied lines, and a diversion in the\r\nregion of Cambrai by the British III. Army, under Sir Julian Byng\r\n(November 20, 1917), prevented the dispatch of further German reserve\r\npower to the Italian Front, and necessitated a counter-thrust in\r\nFrance.  The battlefields of France again resumed their importance as\r\nthe vital point in the theatre of operations, and in the spring of\r\n1918, profiting by the improved positions and prospects in the West,\r\nLudendorff attempted to break through the investing lines on a 50-mile\r\nfront.  The attack was heralded by a terrific bombardment, and\r\nculminated in a desperate thrust against the British Armies north and\r\nsouth of the River Somme, the points of penetration aimed at being the\r\nBritish right, where it was linked up with the French on the River\r\nOise, in the neighbourhood of La Fère, and the British line of\r\ncommunications in the neighbourhood of Amiens.  The whole British line\r\nopposite the thrust was hurled back and the territory regained by the\r\nFranco-British {53} advance on the Somme in July, 1916, was recaptured\r\nby the German Armies.  But this was not a battle for towns or\r\nterritory, as the German hammer blows were intended to drive a wedge\r\nbetween the British and French Armies, to roll up the British flank\r\nnorthwards to the sea-coast and the French flank southwards to Paris,\r\nand to capture the main line of communication between these Northern\r\nand Southern Armies.  By skilful reinforcement of threatened points,\r\nMarshal Haig frustrated the primary object of the attack, and by the\r\naid of the French Armies the whole line fell back, disputing the ground\r\nwith the utmost resolution, and maintaining the line without losing\r\ntouch between the south and north.  The German wedge was thrust in, but\r\nevery attempt to effect a breach and to pour through the line was\r\nfrustrated by the Allies.  During the battle the French and British\r\nArmies became intermingled, and to preserve unity of control a\r\nGeneralissimo was appointed in the person of General Foch, who had\r\ncommanded the French IX. Army at the First Battle of the Marne in\r\nSeptember, 1914, and the French Armies of the Somme during the advance\r\nin July, 1916.  General Pershing, commanding the Army of the United\r\nStates, gave a free hand to the Generalissimo to incorporate American\r\ntroops wherever they might be needed in the field, and Marshal Haig and\r\nGeneral Retain remained in command of the British and French Armies.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ATTACK.--The object of every attack is to break down the\r\nenemy's resistance by the weight and direction of fire and to complete\r\nhis overthrow by assault, by the delivery of a decisive blow with as\r\nlarge a portion as possible of the attacking force against a selected\r\npoint or portion of the enemy's position.  The term \"Decisive Attack\"\r\ndoes not imply that the influence of other attacks is indecisive, but\r\nrather that it is the culmination of gradually increasing pressure\r\nrelentlessly applied to the enemy from the moment when contact with him\r\nis first obtained.\r\n\r\n{54}\r\n\r\nTWO PLANS OF ATTACK.--There are two plans of attack.  In the first, the\r\ndirection in which the decisive blow is to be delivered is determined\r\nbeforehand; an adequate force is detailed and pushed forward for this\r\npurpose, and at the same time another part of the force is detailed to\r\nattack another portion of the enemy's position, to keep his attention\r\nthere, to pin his troops in position, to prevent him sending\r\nreinforcements to the part mainly threatened, and ultimately to drive\r\nhome with the successful assault of the main attack.  The rest of the\r\nforce is small and is retained in General Reserve to meet emergencies.\r\n\r\nIn the second plan, a general action is developed by a part of the\r\nattacking force and the remainder is retained in General Reserve, to be\r\nthrown in when the opportunity arrives, at the right time and in the\r\nright place.  In this case, the \"remainder\" is not less than half the\r\navailable force.\r\n\r\nThe first plan can be adopted when the commander of the attacking force\r\nhas definite information as to the extent of the enemy's position, when\r\nhe knows where its flanks rest and when he knows the approximate\r\nstrength of the forces arrayed against him.  It must also be possible,\r\nwithout undue risk, to divide the attacking force into parties of such\r\nstrength that neither can be overwhelmed by the enemy in detail, and it\r\nis to be noted that in the case of a serious check there is only a\r\nsmall General Reserve to restore the battle.  The second plan can be\r\nadopted when information is incomplete, and owing to the strong force\r\nretained by the commander in General Reserve, the situation can be\r\nexploited and developed by fighting without undue risk.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH OF THE ATTACK.--It must always be remembered that a commander\r\ncan never be too strong when making an attack, for he can never be\r\nperfectly sure of what force he may encounter, or at what moment the\r\nadversary may make a counter-attack.  An attack {55} on an enemy\r\npresupposes a superiority of force at the place where the attack is\r\nmade, for war is but the art of being stronger than the enemy at the\r\nright place at the right time, and for an attack to have a reasonable\r\nhope of success the attackers, at the point where the penetration takes\r\nplace, must be superior.\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION OF THE TROOPS.--Each phase of the Attack will normally\r\nrequire three separate bodies of troops for its execution: a _Forward\r\nBody_ to seek out for, and when located attack, the enemy along the\r\nwhole front of the sector allotted to it and by relentless pressure to\r\nwear down the enemy's resistance in order to discover the weak portions\r\nof the defence; _Supports_ to penetrate the weak portions of the\r\ndefence and forthwith to attack the flanks and rear of those portions\r\nof the defence which are holding up the Attack; with Local Reserves for\r\ndealing with local counter-attacks; and a _General Reserve_ by means of\r\nwhich the commander exploits success or retrieves failure.\r\n\r\nTHE FORWARD BODY, THE SUPPORTS, AND THE LOCAL RESERVES.--The paramount\r\nduty of all leaders in the firing line is to get their troops forward,\r\nand if every leader is imbued with the determination to close with the\r\nenemy, he will be unconsciously assisting his neighbour also, for, as a\r\nrule, the best method of supporting a neighbouring unit is to advance.\r\nBut an attack is often held up by well-directed machine-gun fire, and\r\nby determined and well-trained riflemen in concealed or well-prepared\r\npositions.  The tactics to be pursued under these circumstances are\r\nthus outlined in \"Infantry Training, 1921\": \"When forward troops are\r\nheld up by the enemy's organised fire at close ranges they must keep\r\nhim pinned to his ground and absorb his attention by maintaining a\r\nvigorous fire and working their way closer when opportunity offers.  It\r\nwill be the duty of the Supports to turn the flank of, and enfilade,\r\nthat portion of the enemy's defences where a garrison is opposing {56}\r\nthe Forward Body.  To achieve this, Supports may have to quit their\r\ndirect line of advance and follow in the wake of a neighbouring unit,\r\nwhich is able to advance.  It must constantly be borne in mind that\r\npressure should be brought on the enemy by supporting troops in places\r\nwhere the attack is progressing rather than where it is held up, never\r\nby the mere reinforcement or thickening up of a line of troops who have\r\nbeen unable to advance.  There must be no slackening of pressure,\r\nmeanwhile, by the forward troops who are temporarily held up, or the\r\ndefenders will be able to turn their attention to the flanking attacks\r\nwhich are being directed against them.\"  The Local Reserves are for\r\nlocal counter-attacks by fire or movement against similar efforts by\r\nthe Local Reserves of the enemy.  In modern campaigns this work is\r\neffectively carried out by the overhead fire of machine guns\r\ndistributed in depth, and the mobile Local Reserves may thus consist of\r\nsmaller units detached for the purpose by the Forward Body or by the\r\nSupports.  During the great German offensive in the spring of 1918 the\r\n_Attacks on the Somme and the Lys_ were constantly held up by the\r\nvigour and tenacity of the Franco-British defence, and to meet the\r\nnecessities of the case the following instructions were issued by the\r\nGerman General Staff: \"If the assaulting troops are held up by\r\nmachine-gun fire they are to lie down and keep up a steady rifle fire,\r\nwhile Supports in the rear and on the flank try to work round the\r\nflanks and rear of the machine-gun nests which are holding up the\r\nAttack.  Meanwhile, the commander of the battalion which is responsible\r\nfor the Attack is to arrange for artillery and light trench-mortar\r\nsupport, and should protect his own flanks from machine-gun fire by\r\nmeans of smoke.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL RESERVE.--In a modern campaign against civilised troops it\r\nwill seldom, or never, happen that the efforts of the Forward Body,\r\nSupports, and Local Reserves will annihilate the enemy and so prevent\r\nhim from regaining cohesion and fighting power.  Even if {57} every\r\npart of the position against which an assault is delivered is captured\r\nand held, the enemy will not, by that means alone, cease to exist as a\r\nfighting force, and if he is permitted to withdraw with a semblance of\r\norder and moral the work of the Attacking Force will be of little\r\navail.  The destruction of the enemy and not the mere capture of the\r\nground of the encounter is the ultimate aim of the commander.  He will,\r\ntherefore, accept the best available opportunity for the destruction of\r\nthe enemy by overwhelming them in some part of the battlefield during\r\nthe successful operations of his Attacking Force.  It may, however,\r\nhappen that the efforts of the Attacking Force are generally\r\nunsuccessful and the enemy may be on the point of gaining the upper\r\nhand.  By means of the General Reserve the commander exploits the\r\nsuccess or retrieves the failure of the Attacking Force.  The commander\r\nwill have selected some point or position in the enemy's defensive\r\nsystem against which he can direct his decisive attack.  This point\r\ncannot, as a rule, be determined until it has been revealed by the\r\nsuccesses of the Forward Body and the Supports, and when it has been\r\nselected it must be struck unexpectedly and in the greatest possible\r\nstrength.  While, therefore, the Forward Body, Supports, and Local\r\nReserves must be adequate in numbers for the task allotted to them, a\r\ncommander will generally retain about half his available force for the\r\ndelivery of the Decisive Attack, and when this decisive blow has been\r\ndelivered the Reserve will carry on the pursuit of the beaten enemy\r\nuntil such time as other Infantry, or Cavalry, or Tanks, have caught up\r\nand passed them.  If the attacking troops fail to obtain their\r\nobjective the commander has at his disposal the means of relieving\r\nexhausted troops and of dealing with the \"decisive counter-attack\" of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMANDER'S PLANS.--Once troops are committed to the assault the\r\ncommander is powerless to divert them to another purpose.  His control\r\nis exercised in {58} the correct interpretation or adaptation of his\r\noriginal plan by his subordinate commanders.  Before launching his\r\ntroops to the attack in accordance with the decisions arrived at from\r\ninformation received, the commander will assemble his subordinates and\r\nthe representatives of co-operating arms or formations in order that\r\nhis plans may be explained.  This conference should be held at such a\r\ntime as will enable his subordinates to explain their _rôle_ to the\r\nsub-unit commanders.  Wherever possible the conference should be\r\npreceded by a personal reconnaissance of the ground over which the\r\nattack is to be made, otherwise a map of the district concerned must be\r\nsubstituted for the actual view.\r\n\r\nThe commander will be influenced in his plans by the state of the\r\ncampaign at the time of the decision to attack.  In the opening stages\r\nof a campaign in a thickly populated country, and generally throughout\r\na campaign in less settled districts, a war of manoeuvre will lead to\r\nthe \"Encounter Battle,\" and the objective to be aimed at will be\r\nlimited only by the power of endurance of his troops, the weather\r\nconditions, and the possibility of supplying his victorious troops with\r\nammunition and food.  Under other conditions, the objective will be\r\nsubject to further limitations, as the defensive position will be\r\norganised in great depth, and while effective penetration will thus be\r\nmore difficult to achieve it must, of necessity, be accompanied by\r\nwidening in proportion to its depth in order that space for manoeuvre\r\nand facility for communication may be secured.  The Infantry Attack\r\nwill be conducted on the same lines in both forms of battle, but the\r\ngreater the organisation of the defensive position the more limited\r\nwill be the depth to which the attack can be carried on and the greater\r\ndifficulty will there be in launching reserves in pursuit.\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF ASSEMBLY.--A column in march formation will very rarely\r\nmove to its attack position, or \"jumping-off place,\" from column of\r\nroute except {59} where there are concealed lines of approach to the\r\nspot.  A Position of Assembly will therefore be assigned, and this will\r\nbe chosen with a view to cover for the troops and facilities for the\r\nissue of food and hot drink, the distribution of ammunition and the\r\nfilling of water bottles.  As a general rule, it is left to the\r\nbattalion commander to select Positions of Assembly for each of his\r\ncompanies.  When large bodies of troops are assembled with a view to\r\nimmediate action, it must always be remembered that large forces cannot\r\nbe moved by a single road if all arms are to be brought into action at\r\nthe right moment.  In April, 1864, General Banks, with 25,000 U.S.\r\ntroops, moved from Grand Ecore to _Pleasant Hill_ in the Red River\r\nValley.  Although lateral roads existed, his column marched on one main\r\nroad only, and twenty miles separated his front and rear.  As he came\r\ninto action with General Forrest, of the Confederate Army, the head of\r\nhis column was defeated and thrown back again and again by forces\r\ninferior in total strength, but superior on the field of the encounter.\r\nHad General Banks used two or more parallel roads, which were available\r\nfor his use, the Confederates on the spot would have been quickly\r\noverpowered.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACKING FORCE.--The commander must decide against which portion\r\nor portions of the hostile position, or along which lines of advance,\r\nhis Fire Attack shall be developed.  As the object of this movement is\r\nto pin the enemy to his position, to wear down his resistance\r\ngenerally, and particularly at the point where the Decisive Attack is\r\nto be delivered, as well as to effect a lodgment in the position, it is\r\nclear that the greater the extent of the objective the better, and one\r\nor both flanks should be threatened if possible.  But whenever a Fire\r\nAttack is developed it must be in sufficient strength to occupy the\r\nenemy's attention fully and it must be carried through with vigour once\r\nbegun.  One {60} to three rifles per yard of the objective to be\r\nassailed is generally regarded as the requisite strength of the Forward\r\nBody, Supports, and Local Reserves.  At _St. Privat_ (August 18, 1870)\r\na first and second line made a frontal attack and came under fire of\r\nthe French chassepots, to which their own shorter-ranged rifles could\r\nmake no effective reply.  The lines pressed on, but were ultimately\r\nbrought to a standstill through lack of reinforcements, which could\r\nhave been sent up against the flank of the fire position which was\r\nholding up the attack, under cover of the fire of the troops in\r\nposition, and would thus have carried the Forward Body to the assault.\r\n\r\nEqually unsuccessful was Osman Pasha's attempt to break through the\r\ninvesting lines at _Plevna_ (December 10, 1877).  With 15,000 troops he\r\npierced the Russian lines, and another resolute effort would have\r\ncarried the sortie through the investing forces.  But the 15,000\r\nSupports could not get out of the town as the bridges and gates were\r\nblocked with fugitives and wagons.\r\n\r\nTHE DECISIVE ATTACK.--The commander must also decide the point and\r\ndirection of the Decisive Attack.  This will be made on a part of the\r\nfront or on a flank, and it may be predetermined in accordance with\r\ninformation concerning the hostile dispositions, or it may have to be\r\nascertained by further fighting.  The advantages of a _Frontal Attack_\r\nare that, if successful, the enemy's force is broken in two parts, the\r\nseparated wings may be driven back in divergent directions and\r\noverwhelmed in detail, and a decisive victory is thus obtained.  The\r\ndisadvantages are that the force assaulting a part of the enemy's front\r\ndraws upon itself the concentrated fire of the whole hostile line, and\r\nunless the Fire Attack can master this fire the decisive blow will be\r\nheld up, while an unsuccessful frontal attack invites the enemy to\r\nadvance and to envelop the assailants.  The advantages of a _Flank\r\nAttack_ are that {61} the enemy's line of retreat is threatened, and\r\nonly the threatened flank can concentrate its fire on the assailant.\r\nThe disadvantages of a Flank Attack are that the enveloping troops have\r\nto face a similar danger on their own outer flank, for upon this point\r\nthe defender will almost certainly direct his counter-stroke, and for\r\nthis reason a decisive blow on the enemy's flank must be followed up by\r\nstrong reserves.  The flank chosen for attack will be that which\r\naffords the best opportunities for converging fire from the supporting\r\nartillery, which gives the best line of advance for the infantry, and\r\nwhere success will have the most decisive results, the last depending\r\nmainly on the extent to which the enemy's line of retreat is\r\nthreatened.  Where the various requisites are in conflict, the flank\r\naffording the greatest advantages for converging fire from the\r\nartillery will be chosen.  Nothing destroys the moral of men in action\r\nso speedily and effectually as a flank attack, and except by this\r\nmethod good infantry will seldom be beaten.\r\n\r\nA decisive attack, to be completely successful, must be followed up by\r\nfresh troops before the assaulting waves have been checked.  Lee had\r\ncrossed the Potomac and desired \"to defeat the last army of the\r\nFederals in the east and drive the Northern Government from\r\nWashington.\"  The battle of _Gettysburg_ lasted three days (July 1-3,\r\n1863).  On the first, the army of Northern Virginia was uniformly\r\nsuccessful; on the second, the fortunes of battle swayed to and fro; on\r\nthe third, Lee decided to make a Napoleonic decisive attack with half\r\nhis available troops against Meade's centre.  But the spirited attack\r\nof the first 15,000, after penetrating the line, was checked, and the\r\nremaining 15,000 did not arrive in support, so that the attack died\r\ndown, was repulsed, and withdrew in disorder.\r\n\r\nAt _Chattanooga_ (November 25, 1868) Grant's decisive attack was\r\nsuccessful, although delivered against a part of the position which\r\nappeared to be impregnable, on account of the strength of the attack,\r\nthrough {62} distribution in depth; 25,000 men were hurled against the\r\nentrenchments in three lines, and the support of the third line carried\r\nthe waves of the attack through the defences.\r\n\r\nDETAILING THE UNITS.--The commander will detail the units for carrying\r\nout the Fire Attack, which will generally require one to three rifles\r\nper yard of the objective.  This force will be placed under a definite\r\ncommander, who will distribute it into a Forward Body to develop the\r\nattack in the firing line; Supports, to enable the Forward Body to\r\nassault the position; and Local Reserves to maintain or restore the\r\nadvantages gained, their main function being to repel counter-attacks\r\nby similar bodies of the enemy and to maintain the offensive spirit.\r\n\r\nThe commander will also detail the units for carrying out the Decisive\r\nAttack, which will require three to five rifles per yard of the portion\r\nof the position against which it is projected.  This force, under a\r\ndefinite commander, is distributed for the attack in depth, so that the\r\nstrength and weight of the blow carries it home against all opposition.\r\nThe force is retained by the commander of the whole attacking troops,\r\nto be thrown in at the right time and in the right place.  It also\r\nremains in hand to restore the battle in case of an unexpected check,\r\nor to cover the withdrawal of the remainder of the troops if it is\r\ndesired to break off the engagement.\r\n\r\nTHE ARTILLERY.--The position of the artillery will be settled in\r\nconsultation with the artillery commander, the decision resting on the\r\nobjects in view, which are, to assist the infantry in its advance by\r\nkeeping down hostile gun and rifle fire--therefore, in the initial\r\nstages, a commanding position is required; during the decisive stage\r\nconcentration on the objective of the decisive blow is required; and\r\nafter the successful assault guns may be required to be hurried forward\r\nto repel {63} counter-attacks, to break down protracted opposition, and\r\nto complete the rout by harassing the fleeing enemy.  When the attack\r\nis directed against a position the defence of which is known to have\r\nbeen elaborately organised, a pre-arranged covering fire in the form of\r\nan artillery barrage, lifted in successive stages as the attack\r\nadvances, may require to be organised some time before the attack is\r\nlaunched.  It will be necessary to detail an escort for the guns,\r\nunless the distribution of the troops for the attack already provides\r\nsuch protection.  At the _Battle of Verneville_ (August 18, 1870) the\r\n9th Prussian Corps Artillery had been pushed forward against the French\r\nposition at Armandvillers-Folie.  The fire of the French infantry\r\ncaused a loss of 13 officers and 187 other ranks, and one battery was\r\ndisabled, before the guns were withdrawn.  There was no infantry escort\r\nto keep the attacking riflemen at a distance.  At the _Battle of\r\nColenso_ (December 15, 1899) two batteries of field artillery advanced\r\ninto action without an escort, and without previous reconnaissance\r\nunlimbered on a projecting spit of land in a loop of the Tugela River.\r\nFrontal fire from hidden trenches on the opposite bank and enfilade\r\nfire from a re-entrant flank killed all the horses and the greater part\r\nof the personnel, and although the utmost gallantry was shown by all\r\nranks ten of the twelve guns were left in Boer hands.  Infantry\r\nregimental officers and battalion commanders must be acquainted with\r\nthe amount of ammunition carried by their accompanying artillery, in\r\norder that ammunition may not be wasted by calling for fire on targets\r\nof secondary importance.  All reserves, whether they have been\r\nspecially detailed or not for the purpose, must of their own accord\r\nmake every effort to assist in getting forward guns and ammunition.\r\nOne of the outstanding lessons of the War of 1914-1918 is the\r\npossibility of placing even the heaviest artillery close behind the\r\ninfantry fighting line owing to the mobility afforded by motor traction\r\nand to the security against {64} counter-attack provided by the deadly\r\nfire of the magazine rifles and machine guns of their escort, and of\r\nthe Lewis guns allotted to the batteries themselves.\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALRY.--The opportunities for cavalry action in an attack depend\r\nupon the character of the defensive operations.  Against a highly\r\norganised defensive position there will be no openings for mounted\r\ntroops until a wide penetration gives space for manoeuvre.  Before the\r\nattack during an \"Encounter Battle\" the cavalry will have been out on\r\nreconnaissance in front of the attacking force; during the attack they\r\nmay be called on to assist by dismounted fire action, and by local\r\ncounter-strokes as mounted troops (against cavalry, or against infantry\r\ndisorganised by the breakdown of a movement), but must not be allowed\r\nto impair their speed or freshness; after the successful assault the\r\nPursuit is their special duty, not necessarily on the heels of the\r\nenemy, but on lines parallel to their retreat, to hamper his movements,\r\nto round up stragglers, and to threaten their communications.\r\nGenerally speaking, such a position as is required will be found on a\r\nflank, or slightly in advance of a flank of the attacking force.\r\n\"Cavalry make it possible for a general to adopt the most skilful of\r\nall manoeuvres, the converging attack, and properly handled, as at\r\n_Appomattox_ or _Paardeberg_, to bring about the crowning triumph of\r\nGrand Tactics, the hemming in a force so closely that it has either to\r\nattack at a disadvantage or to surrender\" (Henderson).  In the\r\nMesopotamian campaign a surprise attack of General Sir S. Maude's\r\nforces on September 27-29, 1917, against the Turkish forces assembling\r\nnear _Ramadie_, 65 miles north-west of Baghdad, was converted into the\r\nsurrender of the Turkish commander and about 4,000 all arms by the\r\nenveloping tactics of the Anglo-Indian Cavalry Division.  A similar\r\nmanoeuvre on March 26, 1918, by the cavalry of the Mesopotamian Field\r\nForce (commanded at that time by General Sir W. R. Marshall, {65} who\r\nsucceeded after General Maude's death from cholera), resulted in the\r\nsurrender of over 5,000 Turks, including a divisional commander, 22\r\nmiles north-west of Hit.  The prisoners were fugitives from the battle\r\nof _Baghdadieh_, and the cavalry were astride their communications.\r\n\"On the morning of the Armistice (November 11, 1918) two British\r\nCavalry Divisions were on the march east of the Scheldt, and before\r\norders to stop reached them they had already gained a line 10 miles in\r\nfront of our infantry outposts.  There is no doubt that, had the\r\nadvance of the cavalry been allowed to continue, the enemy's\r\ndisorganised retreat would have been turned into a rout\" (Sir D. Haig's\r\nDispatches).  The absence of cavalry at the critical moment has often\r\ndecided the issue of a campaign.  After the action of _Gaines's Mill_\r\n(June 27, 1862) General J. E. B. Stuart was dispatched by Lee with the\r\nConfederate cavalry on a false scent to White House, south of the York\r\nRiver, to which base Lee believed McClellan to be retreating.  But\r\nMcClellan had shifted his base to Harrison's Landing, on the James\r\nRiver, and the Confederate cavalry did not regain touch with the Army\r\nof the Potomac until July 3, two days after the failure of Lee's attack\r\non Malvern Hill.  Had Stuart been available with his cavalry throughout\r\nthat critical period McClellan's huge trains would have fallen an easy\r\nprey to the Confederate horsemen, and the roads through the forests and\r\nswamps to Malvern Hill could have been blocked.  Absence of cavalry\r\nbefore the first day of _Gettysburg_ (July 1, 1863) hampered the\r\nConfederate leaders, and lack of information caused them to act with\r\nunnecessary caution when boldness would have carried everything before\r\nthem.  General Stuart had once more been sent away on a raiding\r\nexpedition.  After the victorious attack of General Early's division a\r\nhandful of General Buford's U.S. cavalry enabled the defeated 1st Corps\r\nof Meade's army to save their guns and to retire unmolested.  A\r\nthousand {66} Confederate sabres would have brushed Buford aside, and\r\nJuly 1 would have been disastrous to the National cause.\r\n\r\nDuring the German offensive of March-July, 1918, \"even two or three\r\nwell-trained cavalry divisions might have driven a wedge between the\r\nFrench and British Armies.  Their presence could not have failed to\r\nhave added greatly to the difficulties of our task\" (Sir D. Haig's\r\nDispatches).  During the _Battle of Cambrai_ (November 20, 1917) a\r\nsquadron of the Fort Garry Horse crossed the Scheldt Canal, and after\r\ncapturing a German battery and dispersing a large body of infantry,\r\nmaintained itself by rifle fire in a sunken road until nightfall, when\r\nit withdrew to the British lines with its prisoners.  During the\r\n_Battle of Amiens_ (August 8-18, 1918) the cavalry were concentrated\r\nbehind the battle front by a series of night marches, and on the first\r\nday of the battle they advanced 23 miles from their position of\r\nassembly.  Throughout the battle they rendered most gallant and\r\nvaluable service.  During the Second _Battle of Le Cateau_ (October\r\n6-12, 1918) cavalry were instrumental in harassing the enemy in his\r\nretreat and preventing him from completing the destruction of the\r\nrailway, and when the infantry were held up by heavy machine-gun fire\r\nfrom Cattigny Wood and Clary \"a dashing charge by the Fort Garry Horse\r\ngained a footing in Cattigny Wood and assisted our infantry to press\r\nforward.  Further east, Dragoon Guards and Canadian Cavalry were\r\ninstrumental in the capture of Hennechy, Reumont, and Troisvilles\" (Sir\r\nD. Haig's Dispatches).  In the early stages of the campaign in _North\r\nRussia_ (August-September, 1918) a handful of cavalry on either bank of\r\nthe North Dwina River could have kept the Bolshevik forces constantly\r\non the run, and could have prevented the successive reorganisation of\r\ntheir demoralised forces, which the slower progress of the pursuing\r\ninfantry was unable to accomplish.  A few squadrons of cavalry could\r\nhave dispersed the whole {67} Bolshevik force in the Archangel\r\nProvince.  Tanks are usefully employed in the pursuit, as artillery,\r\nthe only effective enemy of the tank, is unlikely to remain in action\r\nwith the rearward troops of a disorganised enemy; and a new terror has\r\nbeen added to the pursuit by the advent of self-propelled, man-carrying\r\nAircraft, armed with machine guns and bombs, and possibly even with\r\nlight quick-firing artillery.  During the final stages of the\r\nvictorious _Allied Advance_ in November, 1918, the retreating German\r\nArmies were continuously harassed from the air.  \"Throughout the day\r\n(November 5, 1918) the roads, packed with the enemy's troops and\r\ntransport, afforded excellent targets to our airmen, who took full\r\nadvantage of their opportunities, despite the unfavourable weather.\r\nOver 30 guns, which bombs and machine-gun fire from the air had forced\r\nthe enemy to abandon, were captured by a battalion of the 25th Division\r\nin the field near Le Presau\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL ENGINEERS.--The position and employment of the Royal\r\nEngineers will be determined by the commander who issues orders for the\r\nAttack, and as the main function of this corps in the Attack is the\r\nremoval or bridging of obstacles to the advance, and the strengthening\r\nof the position when captured, the Royal Engineers will probably remain\r\nwith the troops to which the decisive attack is entrusted.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS.--The position of hospitals and clearing stations\r\nwill be settled in consultation with the S.M.O.  Aid posts and advanced\r\ndressing stations will be established under battalion arrangements in\r\nconnection with the medical officer of the units concerned.\r\n\r\nSUPPLY.--The position of the Train, with its reserve supplies of\r\nammunition and of food for men and horses, will depend upon facilities\r\nfor communication with the attacking force and upon security against\r\nartillery fire {68} or surprise attack from the air or land.  The\r\nposition will probably be well in rear, and at the junction of roads\r\nleading forward to the attacking troops.  Rations will be brought up to\r\nunits under arrangements by the commanders of the battalion or other\r\nunits concerned.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMANDER'S POSITION.--The position of the commander who issues the\r\norders for the Attack must be fixed, and must be made known to\r\nsubordinate commanders, as it will be the place to which reports will\r\nbe sent.  In the case of a small force the commander will generally\r\nstay with the General Reserve; if the force is fairly large, and\r\ncomposed of all arms, he will probably be on the main artillery\r\nposition; but in the case of a large force he should be well out of\r\nreach of the distraction of local incidents.  If the commander of a\r\nlarge force moves from his stated position he must leave a senior\r\nofficer of his staff to represent him on the spot and to forward urgent\r\ncommunications to him in his changed position.  In the case of a small\r\nforce a commander who vacates his stated position must arrange to leave\r\na runner in the position stated as his headquarters, in order that\r\nmessages may reach him without delay.\r\n\r\nBATTLE REPORTS.--The successful exploitation of success depends largely\r\non the accuracy of the information gained by the commander from all\r\nparts of the battlefield.  Reports are required from all who have\r\ninformation to impart and they should be made out on previously\r\nprepared message cards, stating the exact position of the sender at the\r\ntime of the report; the progress made by the unit under the command of\r\nthe sender, or by neighbouring or other units whose action has been\r\nobserved; the degree of the enemy's resistance; enemy movements; and\r\nthe plans of the officer making the report and the method to be adopted\r\nin carrying out such plans.\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\nREORGANISATION AND PURSUIT.--Once a successful assault has been\r\ndelivered, subordinate commanders must immediately regain control of\r\ntheir commands, and must see that the fleeing enemy is pursued by fire,\r\nwhile local reserves follow up and secure the position against\r\ncounter-attack.  Superior commanders must take steps to organise the\r\npursuit, to cut off the enemy's line of retreat, and to complete his\r\noverthrow.  No victory is ever complete if the enemy is permitted to\r\nretire unmolested from the field of battle, and given time to recover\r\norder and moral.  \"Never let up in a pursuit while your troops have\r\nstrength to follow\" was a favourite maxim of Stonewall Jackson.  The\r\npursuit is the task of the infantry until it is taken over by aircraft,\r\ncavalry, and tanks, and the limits to which the infantry will carry the\r\npursuit will be fixed by the commander, who will bear in mind the\r\nprinciple that \"Success must be followed up until the enemy's power is\r\nruined\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1920)).  If the fruits\r\nof victory are to be secured the work must be put in hand whilst the\r\nenemy is still reeling under the shock of defeat.  A few hours' delay\r\ngives him time to recover his equilibrium, to organise a rearguard, and\r\nto gain several miles on his rearward march.  In modern warfare motor\r\ntransport may enable the comparatively immobile infantry to achieve the\r\nmobility of cavalry, if arrangements for embussing them have previously\r\nbeen made, and in a few hours infantry may thus be transported beyond\r\nthe reach of pursuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{70}\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF INFANTRY FOR THE ATTACK\r\n\r\n\"Only by the rifle and bayonet of the infantryman can the decisive\r\nvictory be won.\"--MARSHAL HAIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formations in which Infantry move to the Attack must be such as\r\nwill enable them to achieve their object by the combination of Fire and\r\nMovement.  For this purpose, the forward troops must be furnished with\r\nsupports belonging to the same unit as themselves, in order that a\r\nconnected leading may produce a joint action of the whole.\r\n\r\nTHE PLATOON.--The smallest unit which can be divided into independent\r\nbodies, each capable of Fire and Movement, is the platoon, the four\r\nsections of which can pin the enemy to his position by fire and can\r\nmanoeuvre round his flanks.  The normal distribution of the platoon for\r\nthe Attack is either the Square or the Diamond Formation.  In the\r\n_Square Formation_, two sections are forward covering the frontage\r\nallotted to the platoon, and the remaining two sections are in support,\r\nin such formation as may keep them in readiness for instant manoeuvre\r\nwith due regard to the avoidance of unnecessary loss.  In the _Diamond\r\nFormation_, one section leads to reconnoitre and to pin down the enemy,\r\nwhile the remaining three sections are held in readiness to manoeuvre\r\nfor the decisive attack at the point in the enemy's defence which\r\noffers the best prospect of success.  The Diamond Formation is that\r\nbest suited to an Attack in an Encounter Battle, when the nature of the\r\nenemy's dispositions are imperfectly known.  It possesses the great\r\nadvantage of preserving {71} the power of manoeuvre for three-quarters\r\nof the platoon until the action of the leading section has developed\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nIn each case (except when the Attack is launched against a highly\r\norganised defensive position), the forward sections will be preceded by\r\n_Ground Scouts_, to find the most covered line of advance and the best\r\nfire positions, and to guard against ambush.  These Ground Scouts\r\nadvance until checked, when they remain in observation until joined by\r\nthe leading sections.  During the early stages of the Attack in an\r\nEncounter Battle _Flank Scouts_ may be required until such time as the\r\ndeployment of the platoon renders them unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAgainst a highly organised defensive system platoons may not be able to\r\nadvance to the Attack without a barrage, and it is essential that all\r\nmovements should conform exactly to the timing of the barrage and that\r\nthe troops should keep under the back edge of the shrapnel curtain, so\r\nas to deliver their assault before the enemy has time to bring rifles\r\nand machine guns into play.  Under such circumstances, Ground scouts\r\nmust be dispensed with.  Such a position will not be attacked without\r\ncareful previous reconnaissance and the lines of advance will have been\r\nchosen beforehand.  The Square Formation will be that usually adopted\r\nfor attacks on highly organised defensive positions, with the two rifle\r\nsections forward and the two Lewis-gun sections in support.  The\r\nLewis-gun sections are thus able to protect the flanks of the rifle\r\nsections, and to deal with isolated enemy machine guns, or concealed\r\nbodies of riflemen, which might come into action with reverse or\r\nenfilade fire after the forward sections have passed over the occupied\r\nground.\r\n\r\nTHE PLATOON COMMANDER.--The platoon commander must explain the\r\nsituation to his subordinates and point out the line of advance.  He\r\nshould usually move with the forward sections during the preparatory\r\n{72} phase of an Attack, and when the forward sections have been\r\ncommitted to the Attack he should assume control of the supporting\r\nsections and move with them.  If his platoon is in support, he will\r\nthus be with the forward sections before the platoon is involved in the\r\nfight.  The success of Infantry in the Attack depends not only on dash,\r\ncontrol, and leading, but upon the intelligent co-operation of support\r\ncommanders, who must keep themselves acquainted with the course of the\r\nbattle by intelligent observation and will thus possess an\r\n\"appreciation of the situation\" before involving their men in action,\r\nand can direct the supports to the right spot at the right time, to\r\ninfluence the battle by fire and by movement, without hesitation or\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPANY.--The normal distribution of the company, when acting with\r\nother companies of the battalion, is two platoons forward and two in\r\nsupport.  To meet the expectation of a stubborn resistance, or to cover\r\nan unusually extensive frontage, three platoons may be forward, with\r\none in support; and where information as to the enemy's dispositions is\r\nlacking, but strong opposition is unlikely, one platoon may be forward\r\nwith three in support, thus enabling the company commander to use any\r\nor all the supports to influence the attack on obtaining information as\r\nto the point in the enemy's position which offers the best prospect of\r\nsuccess.  When the frontage allotted to a company is above the normal,\r\nthe leading platoons should not endeavour to cover the whole front, but\r\ngaps should be left between them; otherwise the men will be so widely\r\nextended as to deprive the leaders of the power of control.\r\n\r\nWhen a company is acting independently, the normal formation will be\r\ntwo platoons forward, with one in support, and one in reserve.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPANY COMMANDER.--The company commander will allot the tasks and\r\nthe frontages of his {73} platoons and give orders as to their\r\ndistribution, and must state where he will be himself during the\r\nAttack.  His position will be determined by the necessity of keeping\r\ninformed throughout the Attack of the situation and of the progress of\r\nhis platoons, and he is responsible that all essential information on\r\nthese points is passed back to the battalion commander.  He must also\r\nkeep in touch with companies on his flanks, sending out patrols for\r\nthis purpose, if necessary; and must use every opportunity afforded by\r\nthe fire or smoke provided by other units or arms to get forward or\r\nround the enemy's flanks.  He will use his supporting platoons to push\r\nthrough where the resistance is weak in order to turn the flank of\r\nthose portions of the enemy which are holding up the advance.  As soon\r\nas this temporary phase has been brought to a successful conclusion the\r\ncompany commander must reorganise his platoons and secure their advance\r\non the objective.  When the objective has been gained the position must\r\nbe consolidated and patrols sent out to prevent surprise.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTALION.--The distribution of the battalion depends entirely upon\r\nthe nature of the task allotted to it.  Where the enemy's dispositions\r\nare known and considerable resistance is anticipated in the earlier\r\nstages of the Attack, the battalion will normally be distributed with\r\ntwo companies forward, one in support and one in reserve.  The forward\r\nbody should thus be strong enough to develop the Attack to such a point\r\nthat a decisive blow can be delivered by the supports against the main\r\nresistance, and the reserve company is in hand for the completing\r\nstages of the action or for stabilising the local battle.  Where the\r\nenemy's dispositions and the degree of resistance are still the subject\r\nof conjecture, one company only may be forward, with two in support, so\r\nthat the main strength of the battalion will not be committed to any\r\ndefinite _rôle_ before it is needed and before the situation of the\r\nenemy is discovered.\r\n\r\n{74}\r\n\r\nTHE BATTALION COMMANDER.--\"The powers of personal control of a\r\nbattalion commander upon the field of battle are limited, and success\r\nwill depend, in a great measure, on the clearness of the orders which\r\ncommit his leading companies to the Attack\" (\"Infantry Training,\r\n1921\").  The battalion commander should be supplied with any details\r\nconcerning the enemy and of co-operating troops.  He must understand\r\nhis objective, the limits of his frontage, and the extent of help which\r\nhe will receive from the other arms.  In addition to such information\r\nas is supplied regarding the enemy's strength and dispositions,\r\nparticularly with regard to wire (or other obstacles) and machine guns,\r\nhe must ascertain the best positions of assembly for his companies, the\r\nbest lines of approach to the objective, the most covered line of\r\nadvance for his supports and reserves, and the best position for his\r\nown headquarters during each stage of the Attack.  In his orders for\r\nthe Attack he will reveal all information concerning the movements and\r\ndispositions of the enemy and of co-operating troops and arms; he will\r\nallot tasks to the companies and to the machine-gun platoon (if not\r\nbrigaded) and will define the frontage of the forward companies; he\r\nwill also detail the assembly positions, give compass-bearings for the\r\nadvance, describe the action of other arms in support, make the\r\nnecessary signalling arrangements, notify the zero hour, arrange for\r\nthe synchronisation of watches, notify his own position before, during,\r\nand after the Attack, and indicate the point to which reports are to be\r\nsent, notify the medical arrangements, and issue instructions as to the\r\ncollection of stragglers, the escort and destination of prisoners, the\r\nsupply of ammunition, and the equipment to be worn.  The quartermaster\r\nwill receive orders as to the bringing up of rations during the battle.\r\nBefore issuing to the Attack a proportion of officers and other ranks\r\nwill be detailed to remain behind, to replace casualties when the\r\nengagement is over.\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\nThe position of the battalion commander will be chosen with a view to\r\nkeeping in touch with the progress of the Attack in all its stages and\r\nof influencing the fight by means of the reserves.  Personal control is\r\ndifficult to exercise once troops are committed to the fight, but\r\nopportunities for rapid decision were frequently offered to battalion\r\ncommanders in the Great War, and seized with a success which\r\ntransformed a check into a victory.  In 1916 a battalion commander of\r\nthe Coldstream Guards, seeing his command disorganised by fire and\r\nresistance, by personal example rallied and reorganised the waves of\r\nthe Attack and added the necessary momentum to the assault, which then\r\nreached its objective.  On April 14, 1917, the commander of a battalion\r\nof the Royal Newfoundland Regiment witnessed the launching of a local\r\ncounter-attack by the Germans on the village of _Monchy-le-Preux_, and\r\nby a rapid advance with the fighting portion of his headquarters,\r\nstaved off the attack until the arrival of reinforcements from the 88th\r\nBrigade enabled it to be driven back in disorder.  On November 30,\r\n1917, during the German counter-attack from Fontaine Notre Dame to\r\nTadpole Copse, in the Northern Sector of the _Cambrai_ zone, the\r\nGermans forced their way into our foremost positions, and opened a gap\r\nbetween the 1/6th and 1/15th London Regiments.  Local counter-attacks\r\nled by the two battalion commanders with all available men, including\r\nthe personnel of their respective headquarters, once more restored the\r\nsituation.  In March, 1918, during the most critical period of the\r\nGerman thrust at Amiens, a battalion commander of the Border Regiment\r\nagain and again, on horseback and on foot, personally restored the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\nDEFENSIVE ACTION\r\n\r\n\"The soul of the Defence is the Counter-Attack.\"--MARSHAL FOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefensive action may be initiated by a commander in the field, or it\r\nmay be imposed upon him by the enemy, and a commander may rely upon\r\nfortification to assist him in defeating the enemy, or he may employ\r\nmanoeuvre to effect or to postpone a decision.\r\n\r\nA commander may desire to pin the enemy to an attack upon a fortified\r\nposition, garrisoned by a portion only of his force, while he detaches\r\nanother (and probably greater) portion to attack the enemy from an\r\nunexpected quarter.  An outstanding example of this form of action is\r\nexhibited in the _Battle of Chancellorsville_ (May 2-3, 1863), where\r\nLee kept at bay Hooker's army of 90,000 with one-third of his force and\r\ndetached Stonewall Jackson with 30,000 men to attack the Federal rear.\r\nAction of this kind is peculiarly effective, but it requires a secrecy\r\nwhich modern aircraft would almost certainly unveil, and if the\r\nmanoeuvre failed to escape observation it would probably result in\r\ndisaster both to the retaining force and to the detached troops.\r\n\r\nA different form of the combination of defence with manoeuvre is the\r\nDefensive-Offensive battle, with examples of which the history of\r\nWarfare is amply supplied--Marengo, Austerlitz, and Waterloo being\r\ntypical battles of this nature.  In this form of defensive action a\r\ncommander invites the enemy to attack a well-chosen position, and after\r\nexhausting the enemy's strength and holding up the assault, the\r\ncommander passes from the guard to the thrust and overwhelms {77} the\r\nexhausted foe by an irresistible and sustained counter-attack with all\r\nthe means at his disposal.\r\n\r\nA position is sometimes occupied as a matter of necessity, sometimes\r\nmerely as a matter of tactical prudence.  At _Nachod_ (June 27, 1866)\r\nthe Prussian Advanced Guard hurriedly established a defensive position\r\nand kept at bay the whole Austrian Army, while the Prussian Army\r\nemerged in security from a defile and manoeuvred into battle array.\r\nThe _Pass of Thermopylae_ was occupied in B.C. 480 by 1,400 Greeks\r\nunder Leonidas, King of Sparta, to withstand the Persian hosts of\r\nXerxes, and although the Greek force was destroyed by an attack from\r\nthe rear (through the disclosure of a secret path by a renegade in the\r\nPersian service), the resistance offered to the \"invincible\" Persians\r\nemboldened the Greeks in their future encounters, and led to the\r\nultimate defeat of the invaders.  According to the legendary history of\r\nRome, Horatius Cocles and two companions defended the _Sublician\r\nBridge_ over the Tiber against Lars Porsena and the whole army of the\r\nEtruscans.  This legendary heroism was equalled or surpassed during the\r\n_Second Battle of the Somme_ (March 21, 1918).  \"The bridges across the\r\nCrozat and Somme Canals were destroyed, though in some cases not with\r\nentire success, it being probable that certain of them were still\r\npracticable for infantry.  Instances of great bravery occurred in the\r\ndestruction of these bridges.  In one case, when the electrical\r\nconnection for firing the demolition charge had failed, the officer\r\nresponsible for the destruction of the bridge personally lit the\r\ninstantaneous fuse and blew up the bridge.  By extraordinary good\r\nfortune he was not killed\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).  At _Rorke's\r\nDrift_ (January 22, 1879) a force of 80 other ranks of the 24th\r\nRegiment, under Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead, with about 40 hospital\r\ncases, drove off the repeated attacks of 4,000 Zulus, part of\r\nCetewayo's army which had surprised and annihilated the garrison {78}\r\nat _Isandhlwana_ earlier the same day.  An astounding feat of arms was\r\nperformed by a small body of troops during the withdrawal of the\r\nBritish Army in face of the overwhelming German attack at the _Second\r\nBattle of the Somme_.  A detachment of about 100 officers and men of\r\nthe 61st Brigade, 20th Division, was detailed to cover the withdrawal\r\nof their division at _Le Quesnoy_ (March 27,1918).  Under the command\r\nof their Brigade-Major (Captain E. P. Combe, M.C.) the detachment\r\nsuccessfully held the enemy at bay from early morning until 6 p.m.,\r\nwhen the eleven survivors withdrew under orders, having accomplished\r\ntheir task.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of the occupation of an area for an actual or\r\npotential tactical purpose.  Before the _Battle of Salamanca_ (July 22,\r\n1812) a Spanish force had been detached by Wellington to cover a ford\r\nof the River Tormes by occupying the castle of Alba de Tormes, but the\r\nforce was withdrawn without Wellington's knowledge, and Marmont's\r\ndefeated army retired unmolested over the ford to the fortress of\r\nValladolid.  In the campaign of 1814, Napoleon placed a garrison of\r\n1,200 in the _Fortress of Soissons_, but on March 3,1814, the garrison\r\ncapitulated without exhausting all the means of defence as the\r\nregulations of War ordain, and the bridge at Soissons enabled Blücher\r\nand Bülow to unite their forces across the River Aisne.  In the\r\nWaterloo campaign, Wellington stationed 17,000 men at _Hal_ and\r\n_Tubize_, 8 miles from his right on the field of battle at Waterloo, to\r\nrepel a possible turning movement and to form a rallying point if his\r\ncentre was broken, and with 67,000 men took up a position astride the\r\nNivelle-Brussels and Charleroi-Brussels roads which met at Mont St.\r\nJean.  He was deprived of the services of this detachment and modern\r\ncriticism has been directed against this disposition of his forces.  It\r\nis, however, permissible to suggest that the security of his right\r\nflank, and the possession of a rallying point, inspired him with the\r\nconfidence which enabled him to {79} withstand the sustained attacks of\r\nNapoleon until the arrival of Blücher's corps permitted him to\r\noverwhelm his adversary.\r\n\r\nA further form of defensive action is the occupation of a series of\r\nextemporised positions and the orderly withdrawal to a further series\r\nbefore the actual assault of the enemy, resistance being combined with\r\nmanoeuvre for the purpose of delaying the enemy's advance or of holding\r\nup his pursuit.  Delaying action of this kind is commonly employed in\r\nrearguard fighting, when the object to be gained is time rather than\r\nposition, and the offensive action of the defender is limited to local\r\ncounter-attacks at favourable or desperate moments.  But the guiding\r\nprinciple in all defensive operations, including delaying action, must\r\nbe that \"when an enemy has liberty of manoeuvre, the passive occupation\r\nof a position, however strong, can rarely be justified, and always\r\ninvolves the risk of crushing defeat\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\"\r\nvol. ii. (1920)).\r\n\r\nTHE OFFENSIVE SPIRIT.--Although there are many forms of defensive\r\naction the soul of the Defence in every case is a vigorous offensive\r\nspirit.  In the Active Defence, the Decisive Counter-Attack, ending in\r\nthe overthrow of the enemy, is the manoeuvre originally in view when\r\nthe defensive _rôle_ is adopted.  In the Passive Defence against\r\nsuperior numbers.  Local Counter-Attacks end with the recapture of a\r\ntactical point or the repulse of a determined assault, and in the\r\nDelaying Action they overwhelm by surprise fire or assault a detached\r\nforce which has advanced with such rapidity as to enable the defenders,\r\nwithout undue risk, to cut off and annihilate the isolated enemy body.\r\nWhatever the tactical situation, it is by the vigour of the offensive\r\nspirit alone that success may be achieved in the face of a determined\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nMODERN WARFARE.--In modern warfare the defensive position plays a part\r\nof increasing importance, owing {80} to the great power conferred on\r\nthe defence by modern armaments.  \"Machine guns and barbed wire permit\r\nthe rapid organisation of defensive points of a value which cannot be\r\ndisputed.  In particular, they have given to a trench, or to a natural\r\nobstacle, a solidity which permits a front to be extended in a manner\r\nunsuspected before this war; they permit the prompt consolidation of a\r\nlarge system that is easy to hold\" (Marshal Foch).  \"The modern rifle\r\nand machine gun add tenfold to the relative power of the Defence as\r\nagainst the Attack.  It has thus become a practical operation to place\r\nthe heaviest artillery in position close behind the infantry fighting\r\nline, not only owing to the mobility afforded by motor traction but\r\nalso because the old dread of losing the guns before they could be got\r\naway no longer exists\" (Marshal French).  It is thus possible to hold\r\nthe forward positions of a highly organised defensive system with a\r\nminimum of exposure to loss, the extra strength of the position\r\ncounterbalancing the reduction in numbers, but a preference for\r\ndefensive action of this kind may generally be regarded as an admission\r\nthat a victorious outcome of the campaign is not anticipated at the\r\ntime of its adoption in the theatre in which it is employed.  \"It is of\r\nparamount importance that in those parts of a theatre of operations\r\nwhere a commander aims at decision a war of movement must never be\r\nallowed to lapse into position warfare so long as a further advance is\r\npossible.  Position warfare can never of itself achieve victory\"\r\n(\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1920)).  However strong\r\nentrenchments may be they will not defeat the adversary's main armies,\r\nnor can they withstand indefinitely the attacks of a determined and\r\nwell-armed enemy.  It is scarcely even probable that an army behind\r\nentrenchments can by that means alone inflict such losses on its\r\nassailants as will enable the initiative, or liberty of manoeuvre, to\r\nbe regained and the assailant's main armies to be defeated.  The\r\noperations on both sides {81} are in the nature of a siege, and however\r\nprolonged the siege, the advantage will be gained in the long run by\r\nsuperiority of aggressive action in the air and over and under the\r\nground.  In addition to the absence of opportunity for the grand\r\noffensive there are two further points of difference between defensive\r\naction in Position Warfare and the defence in a War of Manoeuvre.  The\r\nfirst of these is the inevitable absence of flanks to be assailed, as\r\nthe operations necessitate a connected line of strong points from sea\r\nto sea, or from the sea to the impassable barrier of neutral territory.\r\nMounted troops are therefore doomed to inaction in their most important\r\nsphere, until the lines have been breached and the enemy is forced to\r\nretreat, and the opportunities for delivering flank attacks are\r\nmeanwhile confined to the infantry, and will be due to irregularities\r\nin the alignment of the strong points, upon which enfilade fire may be\r\nbrought to bear.  The second point of difference is the abundance of\r\ntime at the disposal of commanders for developing and rehearsing\r\nelaborate systems of attack and defence, and for obtaining detailed\r\nplans of the hostile works, through continuous reconnaissance by the\r\nAir Service.  In most countries there must be, of necessity, a\r\nprolonged period of inactivity on both sides in a Position War, owing\r\nto the severity of winter conditions, or to the occurrence of the rainy\r\nseason, and during that period it will seldom be possible to penetrate\r\nthe enemy's main defences on such a scale as to bring about the grand\r\noffensive.  But this is a period of inactivity in appearance rather\r\nthan in fact, for no defensive system is ever perfect, no strong point\r\nbut needs further consolidation, new trenches are constantly\r\nconstructed or improved, and fresh areas are covered with wire\r\nentanglements.  Guns of all calibres, underground mines and light\r\nmortars are ever at work, demolishing, wounding, and killing, while\r\nlachrymatory and asphyxiating shell-fire is to be expected at all\r\ntimes.  On a smaller scale, snipers on both sides have a daily bag, and\r\n{82} observers are ever at their posts noting every change, however\r\ninsignificant, and every new piece of work; \"listening posts\" are\r\ndetecting hostile plans, while patrols are collecting information and\r\nraiding parties are reconnoitring, destroying defences, and inflicting\r\nlosses, it being the first principle of a raid that it should result in\r\ngreater losses to the enemy than to the troops which carry it out.\r\n\r\nENTRENCHMENTS.--Entrenchments have been employed in the defence from\r\nthe earliest times.  The Roman walls in Britain, the Great Wall of\r\nChina, the earthworks in the Russian War of 1854-1855, in the American\r\nCivil War of 1861-1864, in the Russo-Turkish War of 1878, and the\r\nRusso-Japanese War of 1904-1905 are notable examples.  But in no war\r\nprevious to that of 1914-1918 have they played so important a part.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous series of entrenchments in previous wars were\r\nthose constructed in 1810 by Colonel R. Fletcher, of the Royal\r\nEngineers, at _Torres Vedras_.  These fortifications extended for 50\r\nmiles and contained 126 closed works, mounting 247 guns, and behind\r\nthese lines Wellington amassed stores and reinforcements until the\r\nretreat of Masséna enabled him to resume the initiative.  In front of\r\nthese lines everything that could support the French armies had been\r\nremoved; behind them Wellington's forces were well provided in every\r\nrespect.  On October 10, 1810, Masséna was confronted by the\r\nentrenchments, the existence of which had been kept a profound secret,\r\nwhile their strength prevented them from being carried by assault.\r\nBefore the end of October a Portuguese spy wrote to Wellington: \"Heaven\r\nforgive me if I wrong the French in believing they have eaten my cat\"\r\n(Napier).  During the night of November 14-15, Masséna broke up his\r\ncamp and withdrew.  But it was not the lines of Torres Vedras which won\r\nback the Peninsula.  Spain and Portugal were saved by the bold march\r\nnorthwards {83} to Vittoria.  \"In six weeks Wellington marched, with\r\n100,000 men, 600 miles, passed six great rivers, gained one decisive\r\nbattle, invested two fortresses, and drove 120,000 veteran French\r\ntroops from Spain\" (Napier).\r\n\r\nDEFENSIVE SYSTEMS.--\"Whether it is the intention of the commander to\r\nresume the offensive at an early date or whether it is likely that the\r\ndefensive system will be occupied for a considerable period, the\r\nprinciples on which the construction of all defences should be\r\nundertaken are the same.  All defensive systems should be planned from\r\nthe outset in such a way that they can easily be adapted to the\r\nrequirements of a prolonged defence.  The ground must be thoroughly\r\nreconnoitred and should at the first be divided into a series of\r\ntactical posts and defended localities.  These posts should be\r\nself-supporting, but should be so sited that the garrisons mutually\r\nsupport each other by fire.  The gaps between the posts must be covered\r\nby the fire of the garrison of the posts, and machine guns may also be\r\nsited to bring fire to bear from positions in rear and to the flanks\"\r\n(\"Infantry Training, 1921\").  This principle must govern the choice of\r\nthe position to be defended as well as the organisation of the position\r\nfor defence, and troops detailed for the defence of an area must\r\ncontinue to improve the defensive arrangements in that area until such\r\ntime as the offensive is resumed.\r\n\r\nCHOOSING A POSITION.--The framework of the modern defence consists of\r\nartillery and machine guns; into this framework are fitted the defence\r\nposts or defended localities garrisoned by infantry, who are\r\nresponsible for holding their ground at all costs and for inflicting\r\nthe greatest possible loss on the enemy.  A commander will require a\r\nposition which affords elasticity for increasing the resistance as the\r\nattackers penetrate the defences, and depth will thus be essential.  He\r\nwill require a position wide enough to prevent the whole of his front\r\nbeing masked by a retaining attack of a part of the {84} enemy's forces\r\nwhile a strong flank attack is simultaneously delivered; and in a War\r\nof Manoeuvre he will require facilities for the Decisive Counter-Attack.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the position will develop automatically in a War of\r\nPosition, but it must always be sufficient to enable troops to assemble\r\nin rear of the forward position before moving up and to afford rest to\r\ntroops when withdrawn from the front line.  The width of the position\r\nwill generally depend upon the strength of the defending force, the\r\nguiding principle being to keep about half the force in General\r\nReserve; if, therefore, the remainder of the force is insufficient for\r\nthe purpose of holding the defences the position is too wide for the\r\ntactical requirements of the Active Defence.  In Position Warfare,\r\nhowever, a defensive system must necessarily be extended beyond the\r\nlimits that are practicable in the Active Defence, and the numbers\r\navailable for the garrison are supplemented by denying ground to the\r\nattack by means of obstacles, the removal of which is prevented by\r\nmachine-gun and rifle fire.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTPOST ZONE.--For the Active Defence of a position the defensive\r\nsystem will consist of an Outpost Zone and a Battle Position.  The\r\nOutpost Zone is garrisoned by a protective force which keeps a constant\r\nwatch on the enemy and absorbs the first shock of the attack, watch\r\nbeing kept by means of well-concealed sentry posts on the Line of\r\nObservation, supported by a chain of small self-contained defensive\r\nposts, while resistance is offered by a series of self-contained,\r\nmutually supporting defence posts on the Outpost Line of Resistance.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE POSITION.--The Battle Position will be established in the\r\narea in which the commander decides to fight out the battle and break\r\nthe enemy's attack.  It therefore forms the keystone of the whole\r\ndefensive position and must be organised in depth to afford elasticity\r\nfor defensive action.  \"In principle, in order to protect {85} the\r\nbattle position from being obliterated by a preliminary bombardment, it\r\nshould be beyond effective range of the enemy's mortars\" (\"Field\r\nService Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1920)).\r\n\r\nTHE SEMI-PERMANENT SYSTEM.--When a campaign is prolonged in any area\r\nwithout decisive results a War of Position may be developed by one or\r\nboth of the combatants.  In such cases the Outpost Zone is developed\r\ninto an intricate trench system, with protective avenues leading from\r\nfront to rear and with deep dugouts to protect the garrison from\r\nartillery fire.  The Battle Position will probably coincide with the\r\nOutpost Zone, the trenches being used for the purposes of observation\r\nuntil the fire positions are manned to resist an assault.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the line on the Western Front of the Great War, \"Pill-box\"\r\nforts, constructed of concrete, took the place of continuous lines of\r\ntrenches.  These machine-gun forts were garrisoned, according to size,\r\nby groups from 5 to 50 strong, and were echeloned in plan, to sweep all\r\napproaches, and together to command with their mutually supporting fire\r\nthe whole area over which they were spread, the intervening ground\r\nbeing entangled with wire so placed as to invite attacking troops into\r\nplaces where flanking fire may be poured into them.  The advantages of\r\nthe pill-box system over the continuous line of strong points are\r\nprincipally defensive.  Fewer men are required for them than for the\r\ntrench systems, and there is less liability of loss from artillery\r\nfire.  But there are certain grave disadvantages.  Well-directed\r\nartillery fire is liable to destroy some of the pill boxes, and a\r\ndirect hit from a heavy gun will possibly put a larger fort out of\r\naction, thus crippling the defence by the removal of a peg on which the\r\nwhole scheme depends.  Supports and reserves are necessarily far in\r\nrear and must be brought up through the open to repel successful\r\nattacks, while a defensive scheme {86} composed entirely on the\r\npill-box plan is less suitable for aggressive action than\r\nentrenchments, there being fewer facilities for assembling troops prior\r\nto the attack.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CHARACTERISTICS.--Whatever the system of defence or phase of\r\nwarfare, every commander must guard his flanks and keep in touch with\r\nneighbouring units.  He must always be ready to assist a neighbouring\r\ncommander by enfilade fire or by a relieving counter-attack; or to\r\nthrow back a defensive flank in the event of a neighbouring post being\r\ncaptured by the enemy.  Each post, occupied for the Defence (except in\r\nDelaying Actions, where manoeuvre takes the place of a settled\r\nresistance), forms a self-contained centre of resistance, capable of\r\nall-round fire, and the duty of the garrison is to defend the area\r\nallotted to it to the last man and the last round.\r\n\r\nTHE ACTIVE DEFENCE.--The Active Defence may be considered according to\r\nthe reason which prompted the commander of the force to occupy the\r\nposition.  It may have been deliberately chosen as a position which the\r\nenemy must attack, and in the hope of delivering during that attack a\r\ncrushing and decisive counter-blow; or it may have been chosen of\r\nnecessity, to meet an attack by deployment on the ground of the\r\nencounter, with the same hope of delivering a decisive counter-stroke\r\nwhen the opportunity arrives.\r\n\r\nThere is little difference in the steps to be taken by the commander,\r\nas in the first case a General Reserve is specially detailed for the\r\ncounter-stroke; and in the second, the position will be held with as\r\nfew troops as the tactical situation permits, in order to provide as\r\nlarge a General Reserve as possible for the Grand Offensive.  A\r\ncommander will be influenced by many considerations in his choice of a\r\ndefensive position:--\r\n\r\n(i) _The position must suit the plan of operations_; it must be \"in the\r\nenemy's way,\" and this the commander must be able to judge from the\r\nmap.  It is {87} to be noted that to bar the enemy's way it is not\r\nalways essential to get astride his lines of advance, as a position on\r\nparallel lines, threatening his flank and rear, cannot be ignored by\r\nthe enemy, unless he is strong enough to detach a part of his force to\r\nmask the defender's position, while he proceeds to his objective with\r\nhis main army.  \"It was a mistake to assume that in order to cover\r\nTurin one had to stand astride the road leading to that town; the\r\narmies united at Dego would have covered Turin, because they would have\r\nstood on the flank of the road leading to that town\" (Napoleon).\r\n\r\n(ii) _The position must not be too extensive_ for the troops at the\r\ndisposal of the commander, and this will be governed by the extent of\r\nthe line to be actually held.  It will consist of a series of mutually\r\nsupporting tactical points, which can be held as \"pivots on which to\r\nhinge the defence of the position,\" and the object must be to obtain\r\nthe maximum of fire effect on all ground over which the enemy can\r\nadvance with the minimum of exposure to his fire.  A rough-and-ready\r\nrule is that unless one rifle per yard of the frontage occupied can be\r\nsupplied by the \"troops to hold the position\" (which should not exceed\r\none-half the available force) then the position is too extensive and\r\nshould be narrowed.  On the other hand, too narrow a front may enable\r\nthe enemy to develop, early in the engagement, strong flank attacks,\r\nwhich may make the position untenable before the time is ripe for the\r\nassumption of the offensive.  The _Condé-Mons-Binche_ line held on\r\nAugust 22-23, 1914, by Sir J. French's army (I. Corps, General Sir D.\r\nHaig; II. Corps, General Sir H. L. Smith-Dorrien) had a total width of\r\n25 miles, and the troops at disposal, including General Sir E. H. H.\r\nAllenby's Cavalry Division, consisted of about 75,000 all arms.  The\r\nfrontage actually held did not exhaust half this force at the rate of\r\none rifle per yard, and a position in rear had also been selected,\r\nbetween Jerlain and Maubeuge, with a frontage of 15 miles.  The\r\n_Retreat from Mons_ was {88} due not to the excessive width of\r\nfrontage, but to the success of the German attack on the French V.\r\nCorps at Charleroi (August 23, 1914), which left the right flank of the\r\nBritish Army \"in the air,\" while two German Corps were working round\r\nthe left flank.  The British III. Corps (General Sir W. P. Pulteney)\r\ndid not arrive until the retreat was in full swing.  At the _First\r\nBattle of Ypres_ (October 31, 1914) many parts of the line were held\r\nwith one rifle for 17 yards, and there were no Supports or Local or\r\nGeneral Reserves.  Yet the line was not only maintained but a\r\ncounter-attack at Gheluvelt thrust the attacking Germans behind their\r\nentrenchments.\r\n\r\n(iii) _There must be a clear field of fire_ to prevent the enemy\r\napproaching unmolested within effective range, and particularly within\r\nclose range, from which the enemy will endeavour to establish an\r\nascendency in the fire-fight.\r\n\r\n(iv) _The flanks must be secure_, or at least as strong as possible.  A\r\nflank resting on a deep river or a marsh may be regarded as secure, and\r\na flank extending to the sea, or to the boundary of a neutral State.  A\r\nflank on high ground which commands all approaches and provides means\r\nof distant observation may be called strong.  It is a great advantage\r\nif one flank can be posted so strongly as to compel the enemy to make\r\nhis main attack on the other, as this will enable the defender to\r\nforecast the direction of the decisive attack and to dispose his\r\nGeneral Reserve to meet and overwhelm it.\r\n\r\n(v) _There should be facilities for cover_ on the position and\r\nconcealed avenues of approach from the rear.  A crest affords cover on\r\nthe reverse slopes and woods provide concealment, while time enables\r\nartificial means to be adopted.  Tactical cover can be provided by\r\ncavalry and advanced troops in the early stages of manoeuvre-battle,\r\nand in removing this cover the troops can withdraw in such a way as to\r\nlure the enemy on {89} to a false position.  They can also induce\r\npremature deployments by the enemy, and movements across the front of\r\nthe real position.\r\n\r\n(vi) _There should be good artillery positions_ to provide effective\r\nfire on all hostile avenues of approach, and counter-battery work on\r\nhostile artillery positions.  There should also be firm ground and good\r\nroads for the movement of guns, and an absence of landmarks for the\r\nenemy to range on.  Guns of the heaviest calibre take part in all\r\nmodern battles, their disposition being settled in conference with the\r\nartillery commander.  A battery of field artillery requires 100 yards\r\nfrontage for its six guns, and there is usually an interval of 25 yards\r\nbetween batteries.\r\n\r\n(vii) _There must be depth_ to allow for the disposal and movement of\r\nthe Supports and Reserves, and for manoeuvres to recapture the forward\r\ndefences, or to issue to the counter-attack.\r\n\r\n(viii) _There must be good lateral and frontal communication_ in order\r\nthat any part of the line can be quickly reinforced.  A position\r\nastride an unfordable stream, or high ridge or deep ravine should\r\ntherefore be avoided.  At the _Battle of Dresden_ (August 26, 1813) the\r\nAllies were encamped on the left bank of the Elbe.  Their forces were\r\nposted on the heights, but the position was cut transversely by a deep\r\nravine, so that the left wing was isolated from the centre and right.\r\nThis vicious disposition did not escape the penetrating eye of\r\nNapoleon, who attacked their isolated wing with superior forces and\r\nrouted it completely, with the capture of 10,000 prisoners, before any\r\nassistance could arrive.  The task of creating lateral communications,\r\nif none exist, is of the utmost importance, as they enable a commander\r\nto achieve the primary object of every military manoeuvre, to meet the\r\nenemy with superior forces at the desired point.\r\n\r\n(ix) _There should be good lines of withdrawal_, and these should be\r\nhorizontal, or only slightly oblique, to {90} the main position, and\r\nnot parallel with the general alignment.  This is a point of the first\r\nimportance, for if the Lines of Communication lead straight to the rear\r\na force that is overwhelmed by the attack can withdraw to selected\r\npositions and towards its base, if it can keep the line intact and\r\nprevent its flanks being turned.  A wide base, with alternative lines\r\nof approach, is of the greatest value, and when there is undue risk of\r\nthe Lines of Communication to a base being intercepted, an alternative\r\nbase, with lines of withdrawal thereto from the unexposed flank, is an\r\nacceptable safeguard, as the defence can be protracted while the\r\nwithdrawing force concentrates upon the changed base.  Such a change of\r\nbase was effected by Marshal French during the _Retreat from Mons_, and\r\namongst many historical examples may be quoted General McClellan's\r\ntransfer of the _Army of the Potomac_ from the York to the James River\r\nin July, 1862, during the _Seven Days' Battle around Richmond_.\r\nGeneral Grant changed his base no fewer than five times during the\r\n_Campaign in the Wilderness_ (May, 1864), from Washington to Orange and\r\nAlexandria Railroad, then to Fredericksburg on the Rappahannock, then\r\nto Port Royal, further east on that river, then to White House on the\r\nPamunkey (a branch of the York River), and finally to the James River.\r\n\"His army was always well supplied, even his enormous numbers of\r\nwounded were carried straight away to the base and thence to\r\nWashington, without any difficulty, and he had no obstacles whatever to\r\nfight against as regards either feeding his army or keeping up the\r\nsupply of ammunition\" (Henderson).  In withdrawing a defeated wing it\r\nmay even be advantageous to rally the troops at a point distant from\r\nthe field of battle, and to cause the pursuer, uncertain as to the\r\ndirection of the retreat, to make detachments which can be overthrown\r\nby sudden counter-attacks, or to lure a pursuer from the field where\r\ntheir presence is required, as Grouchy was lured after Napoleon's\r\ndefeat of the Prussians at Ligny {91} (June 16, 1815).  The object of\r\nNapoleon's attack on the Allies was the separation of Wellington's\r\nAnglo-Belgian force from the Prussian Army under Blücher, and after the\r\ndefeat of the latter at Ligny the Emperor directed Marshal Grouchy to\r\npursue the Prussians and to drive them eastwards.  Grouchy conducted a\r\nleisurely pursuit and engaged an insignificant part of the Prussian\r\nArmy (_The Battle of Wavre_, June 18-19, 1815), while the main body of\r\nthe Prussians moved westwards and assisted in the overthrow of Napoleon\r\nat Waterloo.\r\n\r\n(x) _There should be favourable ground and a good line of advance for\r\nthe Decisive Counter-Attack_.  In order, therefore, to overthrow the\r\nenemy, a position should not be chosen behind an impassable feature\r\nwhich neither side can cross.  At _Ramillies_ (May 23, 1706), one wing\r\nof the enemy was posted behind a marsh, where it was both unassailable\r\nand unable to attack.  Marlborough, therefore, ignored that wing\r\nentirely, and bringing his whole force against the remaining wing, won\r\neasily a decisive victory.  The only occasions when an impassable\r\nfeature is welcome are in the Passive Defence of a small force against\r\noverwhelming odds (as was seen in August, 1914, when the Belgians\r\noccupied a position behind the _River Gette_), and in the Delaying\r\nAction of a Rear-guard fighting for time for the Main Body to get away.\r\nIn such cases a Decisive Counter-Attack is not contemplated.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION OF A DEFENSIVE POSITION.--The framework of the _defence_ is\r\nprovided by artillery and machine-gun fire; the backbone of the\r\n_offence_ is the infantry.  The Commander will _divide the troops_ into\r\n(a) _Troops to hold the position_, and (b) _General Reserve_, the\r\ngolden rule being to make (a) as small as the tactical situation\r\npermits in order that (b) may be as large as possible, and its work\r\nabsolutely decisive.  Under no circumstances {92} should the General\r\nReserve be much below half the available force.\r\n\r\nOf these two portions, the _Troops to hold the position_ consist of\r\ninfantry occupying a series of mutually supporting tactical strong\r\npoints, not necessarily continuous, and of irregular alignment so as to\r\ncover with the defender's fire not only the ground over which the enemy\r\ncan advance, but the front and flanks of neighbouring strong points.\r\nThis line will be strengthened, as and when necessary, by throwing in\r\nthe supports, and it will be assisted at critical moments by the local\r\nreserves, which, coming up unseen, will deliver local counter-attacks\r\non the assaulting enemy, and will thus restore the battle at threatened\r\npoints by relieving the pressure on the front line.  Their work\r\ncompleted they will be rallied and withdrawn again into local reserve,\r\nand it is highly important that they should be kept well under control,\r\nor their successful efforts may be neutralised by local reserves of the\r\nattacking force.  At _Talavera_ (July 27, 1809) a portion of the\r\nBritish force followed up the repulsed French columns too far, and\r\nbeing in turn broken and driven back, was pursued closely by the enemy\r\nand retired in disorder to the position.  At the battle of\r\n_Fredericksburg_ (December 13, 1862) two brigades emerged from the\r\nConfederate position and drove Meade's division of the Army of the\r\nPotomac out of their lines.  But they rushed on with reckless\r\nimpetuosity and were finally driven back with heavy loss.  Local\r\ncounter-attacks keep alive an offensive spirit in the defenders,\r\nexhaust the enemy's powers, draw his reserves into the battle, and thus\r\nprepare the opportunity for the Decisive Counter-Attack.  The local\r\nreserves of flank sections should usually be echeloned in rear of the\r\nflank, which can thus be protected at need by determined\r\ncounter-attacks on the flank of the enveloping force.\r\n\r\n_The General Reserve is for the Decisive Counter-Attack_ and is held\r\nfor this purpose in the hands of the {93} commander of the whole force,\r\nin order that it may be used to crush and overthrow the enemy's main\r\nattack.  The opportunity for this effort is generally obtained only\r\nwhen the enemy has thrown into action his own General Reserve for the\r\ndecisive attack, and has received a check.  A bold and resolute\r\ncounter-attack at that moment is bound to achieve a decisive success.\r\nBut the assumption of the _grand offensive should not be confined to\r\nthe General Reserve alone_.  Commanders of sections of the defence who\r\nare permitted by the local situation to do so, must at once join in the\r\ndecisive counter-attack, unless express orders to the contrary have\r\nbeen received; and any definite success obtained must be the signal for\r\nthe whole force to press the enemy with the utmost vigour.  This\r\nopportunity will be fleeting, and there must be no delay in seizing it.\r\nEvery preparation must therefore be made in anticipation of the\r\nopportunity so that a pre-arranged plan may be put into execution.  \"To\r\ninitiate a counter-attack on a large scale without due time for\r\npreparation, co-ordination, and movement of troops is to court failure,\r\nwith heavy casualties and resulting demoralisation\" (\"Field Service\r\nRegulations,\" vol. ii. (1920)).\r\n\r\nThat the soul of the defence is the counter-attack was shown at the\r\nbattle of _Spottsylvania_ (May 12, 1864).  General Hancock's Corps\r\n(from Grant's combined armies) had assaulted and captured part of Lee's\r\nentrenchments in the Wilderness of Virginia; 20,000 men had assaulted\r\nand captured the Salient, taking 4,000 prisoners; they then pressed\r\nforward, and sweeping everything before them, drove a wedge right into\r\nthe Confederate position.  \"But Lee, recognising the weakness of the\r\nSalient, had caused another line of entrenchments to be constructed\r\nabout half a mile in rear.  By this second line the Federals were\r\nsuddenly brought up.  The confusion was very great, the battalions had\r\nintermingled in the excitement of the charge, and the officers could\r\nneither make their orders {94} heard nor form their men for another\r\nrush.  Lee threw in his reserves.  He made a tremendous counter-attack.\r\nEvery single battalion he could collect was ordered to attack, and the\r\nvigour of the blow was such that the whole of these 20,000 men were\r\ndriven back beyond the first line of entrenchments, and the\r\nConfederates recaptured their first position\" (Henderson).\r\n\r\n_He will select positions for the Artillery_, in consultation with the\r\ncommander of that arm, the objects in view being: to command lines of\r\napproach so that the assailant may be shelled and forced to deploy\r\nearly and so to indicate his plan of attack; to delay the advance; to\r\ncombine with the infantry in the close defence of the main position; to\r\nsupport local counter-attacks; to destroy hostile batteries by\r\ncounter-battery work; and to combine eventually in the Decisive\r\nCounter-Attack.  The increased mobility of guns of the heaviest calibre\r\nowing to motor traction, and the increased defensive power of the\r\nprotective quick-firing small arms, enable guns to be placed close\r\nbehind the infantry firing line without undue risk of capture.\r\n\r\n_He will divide the position into sectors_, each garrisoned by a\r\ndistinct unit, under a definite commander.  The mutually supporting\r\ntactical points (farmsteads, villages, woods, ridges, knolls, etc.)\r\nwill usually be held in groups, under group commanders, with definite\r\nsubordinate commanders, and the group commander will probably control\r\nthe local reserves of that group, with which he can assist any of the\r\nunits in times of need.  The units from which such groups are formed\r\nwill usually be complete sections.\r\n\r\n_He will decide the position of the General Reserve_.  This will be the\r\nlocality best suited for the advance to the decisive counter-attack, if\r\nit is to be delivered from a distance; or near the point where the\r\nenemy's decisive attack is expected, if it is intended to hurl the\r\nGeneral Reserve into the flank and rear of the enemy's main {95} attack\r\nwhile it is heavily engaged with the troops holding the position.  As\r\nsurprise is essential to success, the position of the General Reserve\r\nshould be concealed as long as possible.  The position of the General\r\nReserve will depend upon the ascertained intentions of the enemy.  At\r\nthe _Second Battle of the Somme_ (March 21, 1918) the intentions of the\r\nGerman commander were ascertained during the first day's fighting.  \"As\r\nby this time (_i.e._ the evening of March 21) it had become clear that\r\npractically the whole of the enemy's striking force had been committed\r\nto this one battle, my plans already referred to for collecting\r\nreserves from other parts of the British front were put into immediate\r\nexecution.  By drawing away local reserves and thinning out the front\r\nnot attacked, it was possible to reinforce the battle by eight\r\ndivisions before the end of the month\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\n_He must decide the position_, and to some extent the action, of the\r\nCavalry.  Before defensive action in a War of Manoeuvre the cavalry\r\nhave been out on reconnaissance, and during the early stages they have\r\nendeavoured to lure the assailants on to a false position.  During the\r\nbattle they will frustrate the efforts of opposing mounted troops, will\r\nprotect a vulnerable flank, and will assist generally by dismounted\r\nfire action.  After the victorious counter-attack they will emerge in\r\npursuit.  In case of a reverse they will delay the enemy's victorious\r\nadvance by fire action and by mounted tactics to protect the\r\nwithdrawing forces from the depredations of hostile cavalry.  A\r\nposition near a flank will usually be occupied.\r\n\r\nThere have been many examples of protection by cavalry of a force that\r\nhas been worsted.  After the _Combat of Roliça_ (August 17, 1808)\r\nGeneral Delaborde retreated by alternate masses, protecting his\r\nmovements by short, vigorous charges of cavalry.  At _Chancellorsville_\r\n(May 3, 1863), and on the first day of _Gettysburg_ (July 1, 1863), a\r\nhandful of United States {96} cavalry held up the pursuit and staved\r\noff disaster.  At _Königgratz_ (_Sadowa_), (July 3, 1866), the charges\r\nof the Austrian cavalry drove back the Prussian Horse and enabled\r\nBenedek's defeated troops to get back in safety.  At _Rezonville_\r\n(August 16, 1870) von Bredow's Cavalry Brigade was ordered to charge\r\nthe French batteries and their infantry escort, in order to give some\r\nbreathing time for the hard-pressed Prussian infantry.  The charge was\r\nsuccessful and the time was gained, but as at _Balaclava_ (October 26,\r\n1854) there were few survivors from \"Von Bredow's Todtenritt\" (death\r\nride).  After the battle of _Le Cateau_ (August 26, 1918) and during\r\nthe _Retreat from Mons_, the British cavalry, under General Allenby,\r\neffectively held off the enemy and enabled the British troops to move\r\nunmolested.  During the great German offensive in the spring of 1918\r\nthe withdrawal of the troops at _Cugny_ (March 24, 1918) was made\r\npossible by a brilliant mounted charge by a squadron of the 16th\r\nCavalry Brigade, which broke through the German line, taking over 100\r\nprisoners, and sabring a large number of the enemy.  During the retreat\r\nin that area units of the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions proved so\r\neffective in delaying the enemy's advance that other units were horsed\r\nduring the progress of the battle in order to increase the supply of\r\ncavalry.  \"Without the assistance of mounted troops, skilfully handled\r\nand gallantly led, the enemy could scarcely have been prevented from\r\nbreaking through the long and thinly held front of broken and wooded\r\nground before the French reinforcements had had time to arrive. . . .\r\nThe absence of hostile cavalry at this period was a marked feature of\r\nthe battle.  Had the German command had at their disposal even two or\r\nthree well-trained cavalry divisions, a wedge might have been driven\r\nbetween the French and British Armies.  Their presence could not have\r\nfailed to have added greatly to the difficulties of our task\" (Sir D.\r\nHaig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\n{97}\r\n\r\n_He must select a rallying place_ in rear of the main position from\r\nwhich to recapture the front line, as General Lee recovered the\r\n\"Salient\" in the Wilderness of Virginia.\r\n\r\n_He must arrange for the reorganisation_ of his victorious forces and\r\nfor the pursuit and complete overthrow of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{98}\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AND RECONNAISSANCE\r\n\r\n\"Surprise consists in the hard fact that the enemy suddenly appears in\r\nconsiderable numbers without his presence having been known to be so\r\nnear for want of information; and without it being possible to assemble\r\nagainst him for want of protection.\"--MARSHAL FOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery commander of a force, however large or small, is responsible for\r\nthe protection of his command against surprise, and a force can only be\r\nregarded as secure from surprise when protection is furnished in every\r\ndirection from which interference is possible.  Detachments are\r\ntherefore provided by every commander, their duty being to warn him if\r\nhostile forces are discovered in the vicinity of such forces, and to\r\ngain time, at all risks and at any sacrifice, for the commander of the\r\ntroops they protect to carry out his plans unimpeded by the enemy.  \"A\r\nmission of protection does not necessarily imply a defensive attitude,\r\nit will often be better performed by an offensive\" (Marshal Foch).\r\nThere is the closest connection between Reconnaissance and Protection.\r\nIt is only by finding out the location, strength and movements of the\r\nenemy that a commander can decide how best to protect his troops, and\r\nthe forces he employs to protect his troops against surprise will very\r\nlargely prevent the enemy finding out his own strength and\r\ndispositions.  Detailed and timely information about the enemy and the\r\ntheatre of operations is a necessary factor in War and the value of the\r\ninformation depends on whether it can reach the authorities in time to\r\nbe of use.\r\n\r\nFacilities for reconnaissance have been enormously increased by the\r\nintroduction of man-carrying, self-propelled Aircraft.  Before their\r\nintroduction reconnaissance {99} at a distance from the forward troops\r\nwas limited by the speed and endurance of the cavalryman's horse, and\r\nby the skill of the cavalry scout in penetrating the preventive screen\r\nof hostile cavalry, and in escaping the net spread out to catch him on\r\nthe return journey.  His radius of operations was comparatively small,\r\nthat of the aërial observer is practically unlimited, as his machine\r\nwill carry him over the hostile area, and unless he is driven down by\r\nopposing aircraft, or crippled by defensive fire from the ground, he\r\nreturns in a comparatively short space of time to his base, with his\r\nbudget of news, and may bring with him a series of photographs.\r\n\r\nPOSITION WARFARE.--When opposing forces are entrenched at no great\r\ndistance from one another, photographs taken from the air lead to the\r\ndiscovery of new works from which the intentions of the enemy can be\r\npredicted.  On the Western Front in the Great War, photographs taken\r\nfrom the air revealed the construction in the German training area of\r\nactual sectors of British trenches in facsimile, thus indicating the\r\nrehearsal of an attack on a definite part of the line.  Hostile\r\naircraft are prevented from carrying out similar observational\r\njourneys, the resistance of defending squadrons is overcome, and\r\nwhenever a favourable target is presented, casualties are caused by\r\nbullets and bombs.  Observers report all suspicious movements and\r\nchanges in trench construction, and from photographs taken at daily\r\nintervals maps of hostile trenches are constructed and revised.\r\nInfantry patrols and raiding parties are sent out by night and by day,\r\nand information is gleaned from the uniforms and badges of captured\r\nprisoners as to the distribution of hostile troops, while changes in\r\nthe plan of trenches, in the siting of wire entanglements, or in the\r\nemplacements of guns and mortars are duly noted.  In addition, troops\r\nin observation posts, in or ahead of the front line, in favourable and\r\nunsuspected {100} localities, are constantly observing the enemy, and\r\nsentries over all posts containing troops are ready at all times of the\r\nday and night to alarm the local garrisons.  Resistance is afforded by\r\na series of mutually supporting strong points, sufficiently garrisoned\r\nby troops who guard against surprise and hold their ground against\r\nattack.  Entrenchments, with dug-outs and shelters, provide protection\r\nfrom fire, and barbed wire entanglements prevent unbroken rushes by the\r\nenemy, and entice him into openings that are swept by rifle and\r\nmachine-gun fire.  Box respirators and other appliances nullify the\r\neffects of gas, and camouflage disguises the position of trenches,\r\ntroops, guns, and dumps, and so screens them from observation and\r\ndirect bombardment, while it provides unsuspected means of observing\r\nthe enemy's movements.\r\n\r\nMANOEUVRE WARFARE.--In a War of Manoeuvre the steps taken to obtain\r\nsecurity against surprise vary with the situation of the troops.\r\nHostile aircraft flying high from the ground are dealt with by\r\ncounter-attack by armed aeroplanes, but as aërial fighting requires\r\nspace for manoeuvre hostile machines flying within 3,000 feet of the\r\nground must be dealt with by machine gun, Lewis gun, or concentrated\r\nrifle fire, except in cases where it is essential to conceal from the\r\nenemy that a certain position or locality is occupied, and where the\r\ntroops are so well hidden as to escape detection unless they open fire.\r\nMovement is easily detected by low-flying aeroplanes, and in fair\r\nweather troops can be recognised as hostile or friendly by an observer\r\nat 500 feet, while movements of formed bodies on a road are visible at\r\n5,000 feet.  Troops remaining stationary in shaded places may easily\r\nescape observation, and if small bodies in irregular formation lie face\r\ndownwards they are difficult to detect, even in the open.  When a force\r\nis in movement, detachments move with it to afford protection in every\r\ndirection from which interference {101} is possible; and when a force\r\nis at rest, detachments with similar duties secure it from disturbance\r\nand keep off attack until it can be met or developed without\r\ndisadvantage.  These phases are dealt with under the headings of \"THE\r\nADVANCED GUARD,\" \"FLANK ATTACKS AND FLANK GUARDS,\" \"THE REAR GUARD,\"\r\nand \"OUTPOSTS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{102}\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCED GUARD\r\n\r\n\"Fabius, the saviour of Rome, used to say that a commander could not\r\nmake a more disgraceful excuse than to plead, 'I never expected it.'\r\nIt is, in truth, a most shameful reason for any soldier to urge.\r\nImagine everything, expect everything.\"--SENECA, \"_De Ira._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery moving body of troops must be protected by detachments, the force\r\ndetached to precede the advance being known as an Advanced Guard, and\r\nwhen a body of troops so protected halts, the responsibility for\r\nprotection during the halts remains with the troops which have been\r\nprotecting the march until they are relieved, the commander of the\r\nAdvanced Guard exercising his discretion as to halting at once or\r\nmoving forward to occupy a position which may be of more tactical\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.--The strength of this Guard depends on the proximity of the\r\nenemy, but it must always be strong enough to brush aside slight\r\nopposition, so that the advance of the force it is covering may not be\r\ndelayed by small hostile forces, and to resist the enemy, when\r\nencountered in strength, for such time as will enable the force it is\r\ncovering to prepare to meet or deliver an attack.  No general rule as\r\nto the numerical strength of an Advanced Guard can be given, as the\r\nnumber of troops required depends almost entirely upon the tactical\r\nsituation and the country through which the protected force is passing.\r\nIt should, however, whenever possible be composed of a complete unit or\r\nformation under its own commander, and it is found in practice that an\r\nAdvanced Guard will seldom be less than one-eighth or more than a\r\nquarter of the whole {103} force.  When a large force is advancing in\r\nseveral columns on parallel roads it will be preceded by a \"Strategical\r\nAdvanced Guard,\" which protects the front and flanks of all the\r\ncolumns.  The \"Tactical Advanced Guard\" provided by each column may\r\nthen be reduced in strength.\r\n\r\nDISTANCE.--The distance at which it moves ahead of the force it is\r\ncovering depends upon the nature of the country through which the force\r\nis moving, upon the strength of the Main Body, and upon the tactical\r\nsituation, but it must always be sufficient to enable the Main Body to\r\ndeploy, to get into battle formation--unmolested by the enemy's\r\nartillery, if required to do so.  It is clear, therefore, that the\r\nlarger the Main Body the greater the distance must be, as more time\r\nwill be required for deployment.  The Advanced Guard of a Brigade of\r\ninfantry, with artillery, would move at a distance of 1 to 2 miles\r\nbetween the Main Guard and the Main Body, with the mounted patrols of\r\nthe Vanguard 4 to 5 miles ahead of the Main Body.  These mounted\r\npatrols would discover the presence of an enemy, and with the supports\r\nof the Vanguard would feel for his strength and ascertain his\r\ndispositions.  The Main Guard would either assist in brushing him away\r\nor would resist, in the best available position, any attempts to attack\r\nthe Main Body while the latter formed up for battle.\r\n\r\nIN ADVANCES.--Infantry forming part of an Advanced Guard to a force\r\nadvancing must always act with dash and resolution, but their action\r\nmust always be regulated by the one motive of complying with the\r\nintentions of the commander of the force they are covering.  Any action\r\ncontemplated by the Advanced Guard commander must therefore be\r\nconsidered from the point of view of its effects upon the plans of the\r\ncommander of the main body, but if these plans are not known, the\r\nguiding principle will be _to regulate his action solely in the\r\ninterests {104} of the force he is covering_, and by driving in the\r\nadvanced troops of the enemy he will obtain information which will\r\nassist his superior in coming to a decision, without interfering with\r\nhis liberty of action, whereas hesitation and delay may give the\r\ninitiative to the enemy.  For this reason, a wide turning movement by\r\nthe Advanced Guard troops is seldom possible, as time is thereby lost\r\nand the front of the Main Body is uncovered.  \"The ruling factor should\r\nbe the discovery of some tactical locality held by the enemy, the\r\ncapture of which will compel his whole line to fall back.  If this\r\npoint can be discovered the whole energies of the Advanced Guard should\r\nbe directed against it alone, and elsewhere a defensive attitude should\r\nbe adopted, to avoid surprise of or interference with the Main Body\"\r\n(General R. C. B. Haking).\r\n\r\nIt must always be assumed that the enemy will have taken all the\r\nnecessary steps to protect himself and to hamper reconnaissance by an\r\nadversary.  If, therefore, hostile troops are known to be in a certain\r\nlocality, opposition must be expected before that locality is reached,\r\nand study of the map should enable the Advanced Guard commander to\r\ndetermine the approximate neighbourhood in which opposition may be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nIN RETREATS.--While it is clear that a force advancing towards the\r\nenemy must always be preceded by an Advanced Guard it must not be\r\nforgotten that a force withdrawing from the enemy must also be so\r\nprotected, even when it is moving in or towards friendly territory.\r\nSuch a force will not only prevent the Main Body being surprised by an\r\nenergetic enemy, pursuing swiftly and getting round to attack where he\r\nis least expected, but will also prevent the Main Body being delayed by\r\nobstacles, and can delay the pursuit by preparing bridges, etc., for\r\ndemolition, which can be completed by the Rear Guard when the Main Body\r\nhas passed over {105} them.  It can also reconnoitre the route to be\r\nfollowed, so that the Main Body can proceed without delay.\r\n\r\nTRAINING.--In formulating any scheme for the exercise of troops in\r\nAdvanced Guard work all officers and other ranks should be made to\r\nunderstand the nature of the scheme, and should be informed (a) whether\r\nthe force is advancing or retreating, whether it is moving before or\r\nafter action with the enemy, and whether it is in a friendly or a\r\nhostile country; (b) what is known of the enemy; (c) the direction and\r\nobjective of the march; (d) the general intentions of the commander of\r\nthe Main Body; and (e) the general instructions issued to the commander\r\nof the Advanced Guard.  \"Unless such exercises are carried out in a\r\npractical manner, young officers and inexperienced N.C.O.'s will get\r\nthe impression that an Advanced Guard consists merely of a procession\r\nof small bodies of infantry, strung out at fixed intervals on a single\r\nroad.  It is of the highest importance that the training should be\r\ncarried out on the lines that would be adopted in action\" (G.H.Q.\r\nCircular).\r\n\r\nTACTICAL PRINCIPLES.--\"Speed of advance is the first consideration when\r\nnot in contact with the enemy.  Hence an Advanced Guard will move on a\r\nnarrow front along roads and other channels of communication, with such\r\ndistances between advanced and supporting bodies as to avoid\r\npossibility of surprise.  When in contact with, or in the vicinity of,\r\nthe enemy, security and speed of advance are equal considerations.\r\nHence the Advanced Guard should move by bounds on a broad fighting\r\nfront across country\" (\"Infantry Training, 1921\").\r\n\r\nBefore an Advanced Guard commander moves off in compliance with his\r\ninstructions he will take certain steps in accordance with these\r\ntactical principles.  He will divide his troops into two portions,\r\nknown as the _Vanguard_ and the _Main Guard_, and as the duties of the\r\n{106} Vanguard are reconnaissance in general, as well as the protection\r\nin particular of the Main Guard, it will contain a large proportion of\r\nmobile troops, with infantry for assault and resistance, and engineers\r\nfor clearing the way through or over obstacles.  Aircraft, in advance\r\nof the Vanguard, not only increase the area under search and expedite\r\nthe discovery of the enemy, but prevent surprise and assist the\r\nAdvanced Guard as a whole by close co-operation in feeling for and\r\nfighting the enemy when encountered.  \"In order to reconnoitre one must\r\ncompel the enemy to show himself wherever he may be.  To this end he\r\nhas to be attacked until the extent of his position has been clearly\r\ndefined.  But the attack is made with the intention not to bring on an\r\naction.  The skirmishing lines will advance, but they must be able to\r\ndisengage themselves at a given moment.  Pressure is exercised from a\r\ndistance without allowing the forces exerting that pressure to become\r\ntied up\" (Marshal Foch).  The duty of the Main Guard is Resistance,\r\nthat is to say, fighting.  It will therefore consist mainly of\r\ninfantry, with artillery and machine guns, and the troops will move in\r\nthe order in which they will come into action.  The Vanguard will be\r\npreceded by scouts, special attention being paid to roads and tracks\r\nparallel with the advance.  This screen is followed by the remainder of\r\nthe Vanguard, in collected formation, until it is in contact with or in\r\nthe vicinity of the enemy, with protection at all times against local\r\nsurprise.  The Main Guard follows, in touch with the Vanguard, and with\r\nlocal protection.  Both portions have definite commanders, and the\r\ncommander of the whole Advanced Guard will probably move with the\r\nsupports of the Vanguard.  The commander will also determine the\r\n_relative distances_ between the Vanguard and the Main Guard, these\r\nbeing regulated by the strength of the Advanced Guard, and being based\r\nupon the necessity of one part supporting the other.  The distance of\r\nthe {107} Advanced Guard ahead of the Main Body may have been mentioned\r\nin the operation orders, but if it is left to the discretion of the\r\nAdvanced Guard commander he will be guided solely by the interests of\r\nthe force he is covering, and his decision will be influenced by the\r\nnature of the country (whether it is open, or intersected by woods,\r\nhedges, sunken roads, etc., which make observation even by aircraft a\r\nmatter of great difficulty) and by the tactical situation, such\r\ndistance being chosen as will suit these conditions, while admitting\r\nthe fulfilment of the objects in view, viz.:--to obtain information\r\nconcerning the enemy and to prevent hostile reconnaissance; to prevent\r\nsurprise and delay; and to enable the Main Body to deploy into battle\r\nformation without interruption by the enemy's fire.\r\n\r\nIt is also the duty of the commander to ensure _communication_ between\r\nthe various parts of the Advanced Guard and between that force and the\r\nMain Body, by arranging for mounted orderlies and cyclists, signallers\r\nand connecting files, in addition to the contact patrols furnished by\r\nthe Air Service, and to such telegraphic and telephonic communication\r\nas can be provided in the field by the Signals.  This is of the first\r\nimportance, as the action of the commanders of the Advanced Guard and\r\nof the Main Body will depend on information received, and not only must\r\ninformation be gained by every available means, but it must also be\r\ncommunicated without delay to all concerned while it is fresh and\r\nbefore it becomes stale.  It must also be remembered that negative\r\ninformation (_e.g._ that such and such a village has been thoroughly\r\nsearched and no trace of the enemy found) is at least of equal value to\r\npositive information.  The repetition or confirmation of information\r\nalready sent are also of importance, as it is clearly of value to a\r\ncommander to know positively that the enemy is still absent, or still\r\npresent, at a certain time in a certain locality.  In the American\r\nCivil War, during an encounter battle between {108} advanced troops,\r\nthe commander of the cavalry of the United States Army held up the\r\nConfederate advanced troops.  A sharp fight took place at _Sulphur\r\nSprings_ (October 12, 1863) and the United States cavalry commander\r\nbecame so absorbed in the battle that he failed to send information to\r\nheadquarters, and General Meade did not learn that he was in contact\r\nwith the Army of Northern Virginia until late in the afternoon.  In the\r\ncampaign of _Fredericksburg_, General R. E. Lee, with the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia, was confronted by General Burnside, with the Army of\r\nthe Potomac.  On November 15, 1862, a patrol of Confederate cavalry\r\ndiscovered Burnside's troops moving eastwards, and another patrol\r\nbrought news the same day that gunboats and transports had entered\r\nAcguia Creek on the Potomac.  These two pieces of information,\r\ncollected at points 40 miles distant from one another, gave Lee an\r\ninsight into his opponent's design.  Information gained by aircraft on\r\nSeptember 4 and 5, 1914, and communicated immediately to General\r\nJoffre, led to the discovery of the flank march across the\r\nFranco-British front by the German I. Army, and to the decisive\r\ncounter-attack at the _First Battle of the Marne_ (September 6, 1914).\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Guard commander must be careful how he becomes seriously\r\nengaged, and must avoid any enterprise not strictly in accordance with\r\nthe known intentions of the commander of the Main Body.  The tendency\r\nto independent action of this kind, which militates against the success\r\nof the best laid plans, was very observable in the early battles of the\r\nFranco-Prussian War of 1870-1871.  Actions were hastily entered on by\r\nAdvanced Guards, maintained with varying success by the gradual arrival\r\nof reinforcements, and finally concluded with barren results and losses\r\nin excess of those inflicted.  At the _Battle of Spicheren_ (August 6,\r\n1870) the Advanced Guard of the 14th Prussian Division commenced the\r\nbattle, which had to {109} be sustained for three hours by 11\r\nbattalions against 39.  During the next three hours 8 more battalions\r\narrived, and at the conclusion of the battle only 27 battalions and 10\r\nbatteries in all had come into action against a whole French Corps, and\r\nthere were two French Corps within reach of the one engaged.  Had these\r\n\"marched to the sound of the cannon,\" as Napoleon would have marched,\r\nthe 14th Prussian Division would have been unable to extricate itself\r\nwithout complete disaster.  At the _Battle of Worth_ (August 6, 1870)\r\nthe Prussian Crown Prince had expressed his intention not to engage the\r\nFrench on that day.  Yet the Advanced Guard of the V. Corps brought on\r\na battle into which the Bavarian Corps was perforce drawn.  The Crown\r\nPrince sent word for the action to be discontinued, but the advanced\r\ntroops were so seriously involved in the battle that reinforcements had\r\nto be sent into action.  Although tactically successful the battle was\r\nout of accord with the settled plans of the Commander-in-Chief.  In the\r\nsame way the Advanced Guard of the VII. Prussian Corps, contrary to the\r\nletter and the spirit of the orders of the commander of the I. Army,\r\nprecipitated an action at _Colombey_ (August 14, 1870).  Other troops\r\nwere drawn into the fight, and finally the whole of the I. Army was\r\nengaged in a battle which its commander not only disapproved but had\r\nexpressly forbidden.  The battle had no tactical or strategical\r\nresults, and heavy losses were sustained on both sides.  \"Precipitate\r\naction of this kind prevents the troops being engaged in the most\r\nadvantageous manner.  For when a small force is engaged against a\r\nlarger one it becomes necessary, as reinforcements arrive, to move them\r\nup to support some point already hard pressed, and the whole force is\r\nthus used up and disseminated, instead of being employed collectively\r\nwhere an effective blow may be struck.  Thus the direction of the fight\r\nis surrendered to the enemy, as at Spicheren and Colombey.  The French\r\npositions were so strong that the German {110} reinforcements as they\r\narrived were frittered away in support of troops already engaged, and\r\nthe state of the latter during the action was frequently very critical.\r\nAt Colombey the battle resolved itself into a desperate struggle along\r\nthe front of the French position, where the Prussians made little\r\nimpression, while their losses considerably exceeded those inflicted on\r\nthe French\" (Clery).  It is thus seen that the commander of the\r\nAdvanced Guard must limit his aggressive action in accordance with his\r\ninstructions and with the tactical and strategical requirements of the\r\nforce he is covering.  But his action in _protecting_ the Main Body is\r\nunfettered by any considerations of prudence, and must ever be vigorous\r\nand resolute, any risks being taken that ensure the safety of the Main\r\nBody.  On the morning of the _Battle of Nachod_ (June 27, 1866) the\r\nAdvanced Guard of General Steinmetz's V. Corps (of the Army of the\r\nCrown Prince of Prussia) was in bivouacs on a plateau, after emerging\r\nfrom a long and narrow defile through which the Main Body must march to\r\nthe open country beyond.  About 8 a.m. the cavalry of the Vanguard was\r\nchecked by the advanced troops of the VI. Austrian Corps.  It was\r\nimperative that the Prussian Advanced Guard should hold the plateau\r\nuntil the Main Body had extricated itself from the defile.  By the\r\nrapid and accurate fire of the infantry and horse artillery, and the\r\nco-operation of the cavalry against the Austrian squadrons, the thin\r\nline was maintained for more than three hours.  Less than 7 battalions\r\nof infantry, with 13 squadrons of cavalry and 3 batteries of light\r\nartillery, kept in check 21 battalions, 11 squadrons, and 4 batteries.\r\nHad the Advanced Guard suffered itself to be driven back on the Main\r\nBody in the defile a disaster could scarcely have been avoided, and\r\nowing to the steadfast endurance of the Advanced Guard the Main Body\r\nwas able to drive the Austrian Corps from the field.\r\n\r\nADVANCED GUARD PROBLEMS.--The Advanced Guard commander must be able to\r\nappreciate without delay {111} the situation which confronts his force,\r\nand to solve the problem before him with regard solely to the interests\r\nof the force he is covering.\r\n\r\n(a) If the Vanguard is held up by the enemy who is ascertained to be\r\ninferior in strength to the Advanced Guard, the commander will transmit\r\ninformation to the Main Body and will attack vigorously to disperse the\r\nenemy, in order that the movements of the Main Body may not be delayed.\r\nA fire attack would be organised on the front of the enemy, supported\r\nby close-range artillery fire, and a turning movement with Lewis guns\r\nand rifles on one or both flanks.  If the enemy held to a covered\r\nposition they could be ejected by rifle bombers or light mortars from a\r\nflank, while artillery and machine guns prevented aimed fire at the\r\nattacking force.\r\n\r\n(b) If fire is opened on the Vanguard and definite information as to\r\nthe strength and dispositions of the enemy cannot be ascertained, such\r\ninformation as had been gained would be transmitted and a bold\r\nprocedure would be adopted in order that the information might be\r\nsupplemented as quickly as possible.  The commander would reinforce his\r\nVanguard with infantry from the Main Guard, and should be able to force\r\nthe enemy to disclose his position and strength, but unless ordered to\r\ndo so would take care not to become so involved in action that the Main\r\nBody would be compelled to come up and extricate them.\r\n\r\n(c) If the enemy is encountered when the Advanced Guard commander knows\r\nthat it is the intention of his superior to deliver an attack the\r\ninformation would be transmitted with an outline of the steps taken in\r\nseizing and securing all tactical points that will be of service to the\r\nMain Body.  The Advanced Guard would work on a wider front than would\r\notherwise be used by a force of that strength, and the artillery would\r\nbe posted with a view to its position being adopted as the main\r\nartillery position.\r\n\r\n{112}\r\n\r\n(d) If, under similar circumstances, the intention not to be drawn into\r\na decisive engagement is known by the Advanced Guard commander he would\r\nlimit his activities to reconnaissance of the enemy's position and\r\nnumbers, and while hampering the enemy and preventing him from finding\r\nout particulars concerning the Main Body, he must take care not to\r\nbecome involved in a general engagement.\r\n\r\n(e) A case may easily occur in which vigorous action is demanded,\r\nwhether the commander of the Main Body intends to attack at once or to\r\ndefer an engagement.  Such a situation would arise if the Vanguard\r\ndiscovered the approach of the enemy towards a ridge or other position\r\nof tactical advantage, and if the Advanced Guard commander could, by a\r\nrapid advance, forestall the enemy in the occupation of such a\r\nposition, his failure to do so, or hesitation in waiting for explicit\r\norders to do so, would be a grave neglect of duty.\r\n\r\n(f) In the American Civil War a tactical blunder of another kind, due\r\nto the impetuosity of the commander of the Independent Cavalry of the\r\nArmy of Northern Virginia, prevented the Southern commander from\r\nobtaining a great strategical advantage over the Army of the Potomac.\r\nThe latter force had been withdrawn by General McClellan, after the\r\nSeven Days' Battle around Richmond, to a secure position at Malvern\r\nHill, where the assaults of the Army of Northern Virginia were beaten\r\nback with heavy losses.  McClellan continued the withdrawal and had\r\nreached Harrison's Landing on the James River.  The Independent Cavalry\r\nof the Southern Army had previously been dispatched on a false scent,\r\nbut at 9 a.m. on July 3 touch was regained with the Northern forces,\r\nwhich were sighted from _Evelington Heights_ (July 3, 1862), a\r\ncommanding ridge within two miles of the bivouacs of the Army of the\r\nPotomac, which was resting in apparent security, with inadequate\r\nprecautions against surprise.  General J. E. B. Stuart, the Confederate\r\ncavalry commander, {113} reached Evelington Heights with 1,200 sabres\r\nand carbines and one light howitzer, and the whole Army of the Potomac,\r\n90,000 all arms, was in bivouacs in full view from the Heights, and it\r\nwas clear that his presence was not suspected.  The nearest column of\r\nthe force he was covering was six miles away, and there remained about\r\nten hours of daylight.  It is easy to see, after the event, that this\r\nwas a case where \"Silence is golden.\"  Stuart should have sent the\r\ninformation to Lee and to every column commander, urging them to press\r\non at all speed, while he occupied the Heights with his dismounted men\r\nwith the determination to hold his position with fire action, if\r\ndiscovered, until the arrival of one or more columns of the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia.  But he failed to appreciate the situation, and\r\nforgetting the larger question, he seized the opportunity to spread\r\npanic in the ranks of the Army of the Potomac, and opened fire with his\r\none light howitzer.  The Northerners recovered from the panic caused by\r\nthis unexpected attack, when it was realised that only one gun was in\r\naction against them, and attacked and captured the Heights, and were\r\nstrongly entrenched there before the nearest Confederate column arrived.\r\n\r\n(g) Among the examples of Advanced Guard work in Marshal Foch's\r\n\"Principles of War\" is a problem for a battalion as the Advanced Guard\r\nof a Brigade.  \"What is the problem the battalion commander has to\r\nsolve?  It consists in preparing for the brigade to go into action\r\nagainst an enemy who may debouch from Bettwiller.  What does the\r\nbrigade require for such an action?  It requires the _space_ necessary\r\nfor the full employment of its forces, and the _time_ necessary for\r\ntheir arrival and deployment.  In order to achieve that double task the\r\nbattalion commander orders his troops to occupy _the whole space\r\nnecessary_, and places them in points where they may hold on for the\r\n_necessary time_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{114}\r\n\r\nFLANK ATTACKS AND FLANK GUARDS\r\n\r\n\"A man thoroughly penetrated with the spirit of Napoleon's warfare\r\nwould hardly fail to make his enemy's communications his first\r\nobjective.\"---Col. G. F. R. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flanks are the most vulnerable points of an army, for an attack\r\nupon these points subjects the defenders to enfilade fire, and is\r\ndelivered by troops arrayed in attack formation against an enemy that\r\nis not in a position to repel the attack.  The consequences of a\r\nsuccessful Flank Attack are so far-reaching that every effort will be\r\nmade by a commander to bring about such a consummation in order that he\r\nmay sever his adversary's communications, bring him to the end of his\r\nresources, and deprive him of the means of replenishing them.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, there is any possibility of a column on the march being\r\nattacked in flank a force must be detached to protect that flank, and\r\nif both flanks are exposed to attack both must be similarly protected.\r\nThe flank is the most vulnerable part of a moving column, and an attack\r\ndriven home upon that part has every prospect of success, for it will\r\nbe delivered by a force that is distributed in depth against a force\r\nthat is protracted in width after changing front to meet the attack,\r\nand the absence of depth in the defending force will deprive the\r\ndefence of the principal source of strength in resisting attack.\r\n\r\nAn independent column is liable to attack on either of its flanks,\r\nunless the nature of the country through which it is passing provides\r\nsecurity for one or the other in the form of an impenetrable feature\r\n(such as a wide, {115} trackless marsh), or an impassable barrier (such\r\nas a neutral frontier).  The outer columns of a force moving on\r\nparallel routes will have an exposed flank, while their inner flank is\r\nprotected by maintaining touch with the neighbouring column.\r\n\r\nFlank Guards may be furnished by the Main Body, or by the Advanced\r\nGuard, and this point will be made clear in the orders for the\r\noperations.  Their composition, strength, and distribution, and the\r\ninterval at which they move on the flank of the Main Body, are similar\r\nto those of an Advanced Guard, while their action under all\r\ncircumstances is governed by the same tactical considerations, the\r\nprinciple underlying every action of a Flank Guard commander being\r\ncompliance with the known intentions of the commander of the Main Body,\r\nand the sacrifice of the interests of the Flank Guard to preserve the\r\ninterests of the Main Body.  The same duties of reconnaissance and\r\nprotection have also to be carried out, and communication with the Main\r\nBody has to be maintained.  For the purposes of reconnaissance and\r\ncommunication Aircraft are even more effective than in Advanced Guard\r\nwork, while observation patrols supplement and confirm the reports of\r\naërial observers.  The work of protection varies with the nature of the\r\ncountry through which the Guard and the Main Body are moving at the\r\nparticular time.  In open country the Flank Guard may be keeping pace\r\nwith the Main Body at a regularly maintained interval, and on parallel\r\nlines.  In close country, and in hilly or mountainous districts, it may\r\nbe necessary to occupy a successive series of tactical positions on the\r\nexposed flank, any of which can be reinforced and held at need to\r\nsafeguard the passage of the Main Body.  In order that the whole column\r\nmay be protected, from the head of the Main Body to the train in rear,\r\nunbroken touch must be maintained both with the Advanced and the Rear\r\nGuard, and incursions between these forces and itself must be prevented\r\nby the Flank Guard.\r\n\r\n{116}\r\n\r\nIn addition to the protection of a column on the march, Flank Guard\r\nwork is of the highest importance on the Lines of Communications and in\r\nthe protection of Convoys.  On the _Lines of Communications_ raids from\r\nthe air or land may always be expected in Manoeuvre Warfare, and one\r\nflank is usually more vulnerable than the other.  A _Convoy_, when\r\nparked, is liable to attack from any quarter; and when on the march it\r\nmay be assailed from any direction, especially when the adversary can\r\ndetach mounted troops, or infantry rendered mobile by motor transport,\r\nor raiding bodies carried in Aircraft.  Frequently, however, one flank\r\nonly of the Lines of Communications is vulnerable owing to the\r\ngeographical or tactical situation, and the work of protecting traffic\r\nor Convoys on the Lines of Communications is Flank Guard work, with due\r\nprecautions against surprise from all quarters, the Main Guard\r\nremaining with the Convoy and securing its safe arrival at its\r\ndestination, rather than seeking an encounter with the enemy.  The most\r\nefficient way to protect a Convoy is to piquet the road daily with\r\ntroops sent out from posts on the line; but when it is necessary to\r\nsend a Convoy by a route which cannot be protected in this way a\r\nspecial escort must be provided.  The commander of an escort will not\r\nengage the enemy if his task can be accomplished without fighting.  If\r\nfighting is inevitable the enemy should be engaged as far from the\r\nConvoy as possible, and it will not be halted and parked, except as a\r\nlast resort.  In the case of mechanical transport the whole of the\r\nescort will be carried in motor vehicles, and except where parallel\r\nroads are in existence, little can be done to secure flank protection\r\nwhile on the move.  A portion of such escort will move with the Convoy\r\nand a portion will be sent ahead to secure any bridges or defiles which\r\nhave to be passed, the outlet of any defile being secured before the\r\nConvoy is permitted to enter the defile.  In the case of a horsed\r\nConvoy the escort will usually consist of infantry, with a proportion\r\n{117} of mobile troops.  Small Advanced and Rear Guards will be\r\ndetailed and sufficient men will be posted along the column to ensure\r\norder and easy communication.  The remainder of the escort will usually\r\nmove on that flank from which attack is most likely.\r\n\r\nThe far-ranging raid on the Lines of Communications was a notable\r\nfeature of the American Civil War.  It was freely employed on both\r\nsides and was often harmful to the object of the attack and usually\r\nprofitable to the raiders, especially to those of the South, by reason\r\nof the replenishment of stores.  General Turner Ashby, the dashing\r\ncavalry leader in the Shenandoah Valley, was a constant source of\r\nterror to the Northern Generals, and his death while protecting the\r\nmovements to _Cross Keys_ (June 6, 1862) was a terrible blow to\r\nStonewall Jackson, who employed his mounted troops with more skill than\r\nany other commander, Confederate or Federal.  General R. E. Lee\r\npossessed a great cavalry leader in J. E. B. Stuart, \"but cool-headed\r\nas he was, Lee appears to have been fascinated by the idea of throwing\r\na great body of horsemen across his enemy's communications, spreading\r\nterror among his supply trains, cutting his telegraphs and destroying\r\nhis magazines.  Yet in hardly a single instance did such expeditions\r\ninflict more than temporary discomfort on the enemy; and the\r\nConfederate Armies were led more than once into false manoeuvres for\r\nwant of the information which only the cavalry could supply.  Lee at\r\n_Malvern Hill_ and _Gettysburg_, and, on the side of the North, Hooker\r\nat _Chancellorsville_, and Grant at _Spottsylvania_, owed defeat in\r\ngreat measure to the absence of their mounted troops on raiding\r\nexcursions.  In the Valley, on the contrary, success was made possible\r\nbecause Jackson kept his cavalry to its legitimate duty\" (Henderson\r\n\"Stonewall Jackson\").  In the Russo-Japanese War a column of 500\r\nCossacks, under Colonel Madritov, made a bold raid on the\r\ncommunications of the Japanese I. Army in the last days of April, 1904.\r\nThe raid involved a {118} ride of 240 miles and was carried out in\r\nentire ignorance of the imminent attack upon General Zasulich's force\r\nby the Japanese I. Army at the _Battle of the Yalu_ (May 1, 1904).  On\r\narrival at his objective Colonel Madritov found nothing to attack, as\r\nthe base of the Japanese I. Army had been shifted from the Korean\r\nfrontier to a shorter sea base at the Yalu mouth.  On his return he\r\nfound his General in disordered flight, and had his small force been\r\navailable at the Battle of the Yalu it could have protected the retreat\r\nto Hamatan and Feng-hwang-cheng.  Raids and attacks outside the centre\r\nof operations, however daring, have no permanent value.\r\n\r\nIn the South African War a disaster to a Convoy at _Sannah's Post_, or\r\n_Koorn Spruit_ (March 31, 1900), was caused by the absence of\r\nprecautions in front of a retreating force, the wagons being permitted\r\nto enter a defile (the Spruit crossed the road at right-angles and was\r\nheld by the Boers) before the exit had been secured.  Earlier in the\r\nsame campaign a Convoy of 800 wagons was lost at _Ramdam_ (February 13,\r\n1900).  An ambushed force of Boers killed all the transport animals and\r\nthe wagons were abandoned.  No escort had been provided for the Convoy,\r\nwhich entered the ambushed area without previous reconnaissance.\r\nThroughout the South African War the activities of De Wet emphasised\r\nthe vulnerability of the Lines of Communications.\r\n\r\nWhere the tactical situation permits, arrangements should be made to\r\nprotect the Lines of Communications by offensive action.  An engagement\r\nmay be invited in a suitable position, the protecting troops holding\r\nthe raiders with a Delaying Action while reinforcements are summoned to\r\nconverge on the battlefield for the purpose of surrounding and\r\nexterminating the raiders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{119}\r\n\r\nTHE REAR GUARD\r\n\r\nA Rear Guard is essential to a force advancing in order to pick up the\r\nstragglers, to keep off marauders, and to prevent surprise by an\r\nenergetic enemy who may detach a force for a surprise attack on the\r\nrear of the advancing column.\r\n\r\nBut its most important work is the protection of a retreating force,\r\nand this work will vary in difficulty with the freshness and enterprise\r\nof the enemy and the spirit and determination of the force that is\r\nbeing pursued.  Generally speaking, Rear Guard fighting against an\r\nunexhausted enemy is the most difficult and most dangerous of all\r\nmilitary enterprises.  When a Rear Guard halts to fight it is being\r\nseparated every minute from the Main Body, which is moving away from\r\nit, while every minute brings reinforcements to the enemy.  The work\r\nrequires great tactical skill, as it is the duty of the commander to\r\ndelay pursuit by occupying positions from which he withdraws at the\r\nlast moment, without becoming involved in a general engagement, from\r\nthe meshes of which it may be necessary for the Main Body to return and\r\nextricate him.  The work also requires great moral courage, as it is\r\nthe duty of the commander to risk the loss of his force if by so doing\r\nhe is adopting the only means of saving the Main Body.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.--The strength of the Rear Guard will depend upon the energy,\r\nstrength, and closeness of the pursuit, the condition of the Main Body\r\n(and whether it is withdrawing voluntarily or upon compulsion after an\r\nunsuccessful engagement) and upon the nature of the country, but it\r\nwill generally amount to not less than {120} one-fifth or more than\r\none-third of the whole force, and will be selected, as a rule, from\r\nthose who have been least severely engaged.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION.--Its composition depends upon the work to be performed,\r\nand this calls for detachments of all arms of the land service, in\r\naddition to _Aircraft_, which can prevent surprise by reconnaissance\r\nover the hostile area and can harass the pursuing columns by day and by\r\nnight by fire-action with Lewis guns and bombs.  _Mounted troops_ are\r\nrequired to extend the area watched and to prolong the resistance by\r\nreason of their superior mobility, in addition to their counter-action\r\nas cavalry.  _Artillery_ are required to open long-range fire on the\r\nenemy's columns and so to cause delay by deployment; and to concentrate\r\nupon them while in, or emerging from, a defile.  _Infantry_ and\r\n_Machine-gun Platoons_ are required for prolonged fire-fights and local\r\ncounter-attacks, during which sudden bursts of machine and Lewis-gun\r\nfire will do the greatest execution.  _Engineers_ provide sappers for\r\nthe creation of obstacles and traps, and for the demolition of bridges\r\nand viaducts.  _Mechanical Transport_ may be required to add to the\r\nmobility of the infantry.  The _Medical Service_ is called upon to\r\nprovide attention and ambulances for the wounded and for the sick and\r\nworn-out troops.\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Rear Guard is divided into two parts--the Rear Party\r\nand the Main Guard.  The _Rear Party_ consists, like the Vanguard of\r\nthe Advanced Guard, of patrols and supports; the rest of the force\r\nforms the _Main Guard_, and marches in the order in which the troops\r\nare required, viz.: Artillery (with escort), Mounted Troops (if any\r\nremain over from the Rear Party), Infantry, Medical Services and\r\nAmbulances, and the Sappers of the Royal Engineers.  The guns can thus\r\nopen fire whenever required, and the sappers, who are furthest away\r\nfrom the pursuit, will have the longer time to prepare obstacles and\r\ndemolitions, the {121} latter being completed by the Rear Party.\r\nCommunication must always be secured and maintained between the Rear\r\nParty and the Main Guard, and between the Rear Guard and the Main Body.\r\n\r\nDISTANCE.--The distance at which the Rear Guard works is governed by\r\nthe duty it has to perform, viz.: to permit the withdrawal of the Main\r\nBody to be carried out without interruption by the enemy, and to effect\r\nthis it will usually be necessary for the Machine Gun and Infantry\r\nPlatoons of the Main Guard to keep within effective range of positions\r\nfrom which hostile artillery might molest the Main Body.  The commander\r\nwill probably remain with this part of his force, as its work is of the\r\nhighest importance; in any case his position must be made known and\r\nthere should be definite commanders of the Rear Party and the Main\r\nGuard.  But while the distance separating the Rear Guard from the Main\r\nBody must be sufficient, it must not be too great, or the enemy may\r\npenetrate between it and the Main Body, and not only will the Rear\r\nGuard be cut off and liable to destruction but it will cease to protect\r\nthe Main Body.\r\n\r\nTACTICAL PRINCIPLES.--The tactical work of a Rear Guard is carried out\r\naccording to the following principles:--\r\n\r\n_The Rear Party watches_, and it must watch _all_ the roads and tracks\r\nby which the pursuing force can advance, and is responsible that the\r\nenemy does not get round the flanks (which may or may not be specially\r\nprotected by Flank Guards).  Reconnaissance by Aircraft for the\r\ndiscovery of intended outflanking movements is probably of greater\r\nvalue in Rear Guard work than in any other military action.  The Rear\r\nParty also resists the hostile advanced troops as long as possible,\r\nwithdrawing before it is outflanked.  \"An outflanking manoeuvre is\r\nspecially convenient when attacking a Rear Guard, for the latter cannot\r\nfulfil its mission once it has been turned\" (Marshal Foch).\r\n\r\n{122}\r\n\r\n_The Main Guard fights for time_.  If the withdrawal is more or less\r\nunmolested, or if such pursuit as is offered can be dealt with by the\r\nRear Party, the Main Guard can continue its march, taking care not to\r\nclose in on the Main Body; and while falling back it can demolish\r\nbridges, create obstacles, prepare ambushes, and so on, employing all\r\ndevices (within the laws of war) for delaying the enemy.  When hotly\r\npursued it must gain time at all costs for the army it is covering, and\r\nmust not allow itself to be driven back on to the Main Body; or it will\r\nhamper that force and cease to protect it.  Time can be gained by\r\ncompelling the enemy to halt to reconnoitre a position, by making him\r\ndeploy into attack formation, and by making him go out of his way in\r\norder to envelop a flank.  But before an attack reaches a position in\r\nsuch strength as to ensure success, and before the enveloping force can\r\nachieve its object, sub-divisions of the Main Guard will withdraw in\r\nsuccession under covering fire from those still in the line, which also\r\nwithdraw in their turn under covering fire from the sub-divisions in\r\ntheir new positions, to tactical points further back, from which again\r\nthey cover the withdrawal of the forces which had protected their own\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nCertain points must be noted about the positions chosen for these\r\nsuccessive fire-fights, and the choice of the positions is so difficult\r\nthat an experienced staff officer should be specially detailed for the\r\nwork, Positions chosen must be in the enemy's way and the lines of\r\nwithdrawal to them must not converge; they must be easy to defend and\r\ndifficult to attack; the flanks must be secure from direct attack and\r\neffective enfilade fire, necessitating a wide detour (and consequent\r\ngain of time from the enemy) before they can be threatened; long-range\r\nartillery fire on the lines of approach should be possible in order to\r\ndelay and break up the enemy's advance; and each position chosen for\r\nthe next line of resistance should be unseen by the {123} pursuing\r\nenemy, and sufficiently far away from the line last occupied to induce\r\nhim to resume his march formation.  This will necessitate a repetition\r\non the part of the enemy of all the stages of the attack--the discovery\r\nand the report on the position, the decision to attack, and the\r\ndeployment into attack formation.  It will often be of advantage for a\r\nRear Guard to take up a delaying position one or two hours before dark,\r\nas the enemy will then have to attack with darkness approaching and may\r\nwish to defer the attack until daylight, thus gaining several hours for\r\nthe protected force.\r\n\r\n\"The first position taken up by a Rear Guard after an unsuccessful\r\nfight must be held longer, as a rule, than the subsequent positions,\r\nbecause when once the defeated army has got well away along the roads\r\nand has regained some semblance of organisation, the march continues\r\nwithout interruption unless some obstacle has to be crossed\" (General\r\nHaking, \"Staff Rides\").  It can also be noted that as it is seldom the\r\nintention of the Rear Guard commander to deliver a decisive\r\ncounter-attack, he can detail a very large proportion of his force to\r\nhold the successive positions, with local reserves, for purely local\r\ncounter-attacks; and for the same reason, an obstacle in front of his\r\nposition (which would make that position unsuitable for the Active\r\nDefence, as it would prevent the advance of the General Reserve to the\r\ndecisive counter-attack) is most welcome in the Delaying Action of a\r\nRear Guard fighting for time for its Main Body.\r\n\r\nWhen at length a line of resistance is evacuated, the heavy artillery\r\nwill be withdrawn first to move to a distant fire position, then the\r\nslow moving infantry and the light artillery (under the protective fire\r\nof the aircraft and mobile troops), and last the cavalry and other\r\nmobile troops, who by reason of their superior mobility, can hang on to\r\nthe last and can protect the flanks of the Rear Guard as they fall\r\nback, before {124} resuming their work as a Rear Party, observing and\r\nresisting the advanced troops of the pursuing force.\r\n\r\nDuring a close pursuit the Rear Guard commander will be called upon to\r\nexercise all his faculties and to exert all his tactical ability in\r\nhandling his command.  One of the most anxious times before him will be\r\nwhen the Main Body is passing through a defile, as such a passage will\r\nnot only delay its march but will make its columns particularly\r\nvulnerable and helpless.  In the case of defiles Napoleon's maxim must\r\nbe borne in mind: \"It is contrary to the principles of war to let one's\r\nparks and heavy artillery enter a defile if the other end is not held\r\nalso.\"  At _Sannah's Post_ (March 31, 1900) the train was permitted to\r\nenter a defile caused by the banks of the Koorn River without the\r\nprevious occupation of that defile, and all the wagons were captured.\r\nThis not only emphasises the necessity for an Advanced Guard in\r\nretreat, but points to the need of tactical knowledge on the part of\r\nthe Rear Guard commander, especially in mountainous country or in\r\nterrain cut up by woods and marshes, where the train is liable to cause\r\ndelays, as the withdrawing force is compelled to march in a long drawn\r\ncolumn.  Extra time must be gained by the Main Guard to enable the Main\r\nBody to emerge from the defile.  The Rear Guard commander must\r\ntherefore adapt his plans to suit the country through which the Main\r\nBody has to pass, as well as the country in which he will himself fight\r\nDelaying Actions.  A good map and ability to use it, and close\r\nco-operation with the Main Body, must be determining factors for\r\nsuccess or failure.\r\n\r\nTRAINING.--When troops are being exercised in Rear Guard work\r\nopportunities should be taken to explain the difficulties of choosing\r\nsuitable positions, of withdrawing from them when involved in battle,\r\nof the paramount necessity for mutual support, and of accepting {125}\r\nany risk that may be required to safeguard the Main Body.  Stress\r\nshould be laid upon the importance of Fire Tactics (the judicious\r\ncombination of Fire and Movement), the greatest of all factors in a\r\nsuccessful Rear Guard battle, and upon the ability to read and\r\nunderstand a map, an essential qualification in all movements of troops\r\nand indispensable in Rear Guard fighting.  From the map a platoon\r\ncommander must be able to predict the probable line of the enemy's\r\nadvance against the line of resistance as well as the best route to be\r\ntaken when, at length, he withdraws his platoon to another fire\r\nposition in rear; while he must be prepared to throw his platoon in\r\nlocal counter-attack on the flank or rear of an assaulting party that\r\nhas become detached from its supports and therefore affords a fleeting\r\nopportunity for a local fighting success, and a rapid advance for this\r\npurpose along a route unseen to the foe, a speedy reorganisation after\r\nvictory, and a rapid withdrawal to the point of issue, or to a line in\r\nrear, can best be achieved by use of the map and reconnaissance of the\r\nground of the encounter.\r\n\r\nEYE FOR GROUND.--One of the secrets of Napoleon's extraordinary\r\nsuccesses was his \"eye for ground.\"  \"It was not until I went to Jena\r\nand Austerlitz that I really grasped what an important part an eye for\r\nground like Napoleon's, or blindness as to ground like his opponent's\r\nat both those battles, may play in Grand Tactics, that is, the art of\r\ngeneralship\" (Colonel G. F. R. Henderson, \"The Science of War\").  The\r\nsame was true of General R. E. Lee, particularly in the Wilderness\r\nCampaign, when it was not only the entrenchments but the natural\r\nfeatures of the ground on which he relied in his defensive tactics.\r\n\"His eye for ground must have been extraordinary.  The campaign was\r\nfought over a very large area, an area of very close country, with few\r\nmarked natural features; and yet in the midst of woods, jungles, and\r\nstreams, with very little time at his disposal, he always seems to have\r\nselected positions than which none could have been stronger\" (Colonel\r\nG. F. R. Henderson, \"The Science of War\").\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF REAR GUARD WORK.--During the Retreat from Mons the Rear\r\nGuard of the II. Corps of the British Expeditionary Force delayed the\r\npursuit by the daring and devotion of its cavalry and artillery, and by\r\nsubordinating its plans to the interests of the Main Body enabled the\r\nCorps Commander (General Sir H. Smith-Dorrien) not only to throw off\r\nthe pursuit but to effect a junction with the other wing of the British\r\nArmy.  The retreat took place after the First _Battle of Le Cateau_\r\n(August 26, 1914), and during the period of the retreat the insecurity\r\nof the British Army through the breakdown of a co-operating force\r\nrendered it liable to disaster.  But the moral of Marshal French and\r\nhis commanders, the stubborn fighting instincts of the British race,\r\nand the excellence of the musketry training of the Regular Army in\r\ntimes of peace, prevented the retreat from becoming a rout.  The care\r\ntaken in training the troops in Fire Tactics, and particularly in\r\nreloading with \"eyes on the mark and butts to the shoulder,\" was most\r\nabundantly justified.  The accuracy and volume of the rifle fire\r\ndeceived the enemy as to the nature of the troops employed against\r\nthem, and the dismounted troops and infantry with their rifles were\r\nreported as \"battalions of machine gunners.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the _Second Battle of the Somme_ (March, 1918), the British III,\r\nand V. Armies fought a series of Rear Guard battles, and the enemy's\r\nadvance was made at a very heavy cost.  \"Units retreated stubbornly\r\nfrom one position to another as they found them turned and threatened\r\nwith isolation; but at many points fierce engagements were fought, and\r\nwhenever the enemy attempted a frontal attack he was beaten off with\r\nloss\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).  The machine gun proved its\r\neffectiveness again and again during the British {127} withdrawal, and\r\ntwelve machine guns of the 63rd Division, posted in _Les Boeufs_ (March\r\n24, 1918), held up the enemy's advance from Morval at a critical\r\nperiod, and enabled the division to reach the position assigned to it.\r\nThe losses inflicted on the enemy by machine-gun and rifle and\r\nLewis-gun bullets were so heavy that by March 25 Von Below's XVII. Army\r\nwas described in German dispatches as \"quite exhausted.\"  During the\r\nsame battle a detachment of about 100 officers and other ranks, under\r\nthe command of the Brigade-Major of the 61st Brigade, held the enemy at\r\nbay from early morning until 6 p.m. at _Le Quesnoy_ (March 27, 1918)\r\nand enabled the 20th Division to retire to its destined position.\r\n\r\nAt the _Combat of Roliça_ (August 17, 1808) the French General\r\nDelaborde was outnumbered by the Anglo-Portuguese forces under Sir A.\r\nWellesley, and being driven from his first and second positions he\r\nwithdrew to the mountains.  During his retreat \"he brought every arm\r\ninto action at the proper time . . . and retreated by alternative\r\nmasses, protecting his movements by short, vigorous charges of cavalry\r\n. . . and he fell back, disputing the ground, to Quinta de Bugagliera\"\r\n(Napier).\r\n\r\nIn December, 1808, and January, 1809, General Sir John Moore withdrew\r\nto Coruña before the armies of Napoleon (and when the Emperor returned\r\nto Madrid, before those of Marshal Soult).  \"He conducted his long and\r\narduous retreat with sagacity, intelligence, and fortitude\" (Napier),\r\nand it is interesting to note that as in the Retreat from Mons in 1914\r\nand at the Second Battle of the Somme in 1918, so in the rear-guard\r\nactions which preceded the embarkation of Sir John Moore's Army, the\r\nmusketry of the British troops was the deciding factor: \"the English\r\nmuskets were all new, the ammunition fresh; and whether from the\r\npeculiar construction of the muskets, the physical strength and\r\ncoolness of the men, or all combined, {128} the English fire is the\r\nmost destructive known\" (Napier).\r\n\r\nAt _Bristow Station_ (October 14, 1863) during General Meade's campaign\r\nin Northern Virginia (after his defeat of General Lee at Gettysburg,\r\nJuly 1-3, 1863), a surprise attack by Stuart's cavalry and infantry\r\nfrom General Rode's Division caused the withdrawal of the Federal\r\ntroops.  General Warren covered the retirement and eventually withdrew\r\nhis own forces unmolested after beating off several attacks with\r\nclose-range musket fire.\r\n\r\nJean Victor Moreau, one of the greatest generals of the French\r\nRepublic, became a general of division at the age of 33, and by his\r\nskill in extricating his forces from apparently certain disaster\r\nestablished in retreat a far greater reputation for generalship than\r\nhis brilliant victories secured for him.  In the spring of 1796 he\r\ndefeated Latour at _Rastatt_ and the Archduke Charles at _Ettlingen_,\r\nand drove the Austrians back to the Danube, but owing to the defeat and\r\nretreat of Jourdan he was compelled to regain the Rhine in a desperate\r\nand apparently hopeless effort.  Yet he not only preserved his army\r\nintact but brought with him over 5,000 prisoners.  In 1798 he again\r\nsaved his army from destruction when hard pressed by the Russians and\r\nAustrians in Italy.  Retreat was by no means his only or favourite\r\nmanoeuvre, as he subsequently gained victory after victory over the\r\nAustrians in the campaign of 1800, drove them back behind the River\r\nInn, and won the decisive victory of _Hohenlinden_ (December 3, 1800),\r\nwhere the Austrians and their Bavarian allies lost 17,000 men and 74\r\nguns against a total loss of 5,000 on the side of the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\nOUTPOSTS\r\n\r\nOpposing forces come into conflict through the encounter of the\r\nAdvanced Guards of moving columns; through the approach of a pursuing\r\nforce to the Rear Guard of a retreating enemy; through the attack of a\r\nmoving force on an enemy in position; and through the renewal of an\r\nengagement which has died down between opposing forces.\r\n\r\nEvery commander will endeavour to prevent interference with his plans\r\nand future movements, and while striving to surprise and outwit the\r\nenemy he will exert every endeavour to prevent the application of this\r\nvital principle by the enemy.  The commander of a force that is at rest\r\nwill require security for that force in order that its rest may be\r\nundisturbed, and he will require the security to be assured in order\r\nthat his plans for the overthrow of the enemy may be developed.  He\r\nwill, therefore, detach a portion of his force to ensure this security\r\nby observation, to prevent the secret occupation of localities the\r\nhostile possession of which will interfere with his plans; and by\r\nresistance to hostile movements he will secure the rest of the Main\r\nBody.\r\n\r\nThe force detailed to protect troops at rest is known as Outposts, and\r\ntheir duty is to preserve the security of the Main Body.  Outposts\r\nprotect the Main Body from surprise by Observation, and if attacked\r\nthey gain time by Resistance until the commander of the Main Body can\r\nput his plans into execution by the occupation of the position in which\r\nhe intends to receive attack.  Observation is carried out by Aircraft,\r\nby Patrols (mobile troops by day and infantry by night), and by\r\nSentries; Resistance is provided by Sentry Groups and by troops {130}\r\nin defensive positions, called the Piquets, which have other troops as\r\nSupports.  In certain cases a Local Reserve and a General Reserve are\r\nalso provided.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.--Work in the Outpost Line is most exhausting.  Not a man or a\r\nhorse should be employed there if their services can be dispensed with,\r\nand although the number of troops allotted for the work depends almost\r\nentirely upon the nature of the country and the tactical situation, it\r\nis laid down in the text-books that if an unnecessarily large\r\nproportion of the whole force is so employed the force will suffer in\r\nefficiency.  It can also be seen that although the work is of the first\r\nimportance and fraught with the greatest difficulties, it is clearly\r\npossible for a comparatively small body of troops to carry it out.\r\nObservation requires intelligence and vigilance rather than numbers;\r\nResistance can be provided by the Delaying Action on a wide front of\r\nsmall numbers of skilled troops with the relative advantage conferred\r\nupon them in defence by machine guns and small arms, and with the\r\nassurance of support from their Main Body close at hand.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATION.--A force can only be regarded as secure from surprise when\r\nevery body of the enemy within striking distance is so closely watched\r\nthat it can make no movement by night or day without its becoming known\r\nimmediately to the observers of the Outposts.  By day the Outpost\r\ncommander will carry out Reconnaissance some distance ahead of his\r\nposition by means of Aircraft and Patrols of mounted troops and\r\ncyclists, while the commander of each Outpost company keeps the\r\napproaches to the position under observation by sentries, so posted as\r\nto see and hear unobserved by a hostile force.  By night, the Aircraft\r\nand mounted troops are unable to render much assistance as moving\r\npatrols, and the work of Reconnaissance and Observation falls upon the\r\nplatoons of the Outpost companies.\r\n\r\n{131}\r\n\r\nRESISTANCE.--For the purposes of Resistance the Outpost commander will\r\nrely upon his infantry and upon such artillery and machine guns as may\r\nbe allotted to him, and if the area he is occupying is that in which\r\nthe commander of the Main Body will meet attack the Outposts will be\r\nprovided with a greater proportion of artillery and machine guns.\r\nResistance is offered by the entrenchment of each Sentry Group in an\r\nall-round post, and depth and elasticity are given to the defence by\r\nthe establishment of entrenched Piquets in selected, mutually\r\nsupporting positions commanding with their fire every avenue of\r\napproach, covering the flanks of neighbouring Piquets, and so arranged\r\nin plan as to bring converging fire upon the enemy as he advances to\r\nthe attack.  These Piquet positions will be strengthened, when\r\nrequired, by the Supports, who will either assist in manning the\r\ndefences of the Piquets or will occupy similarly prepared defensive\r\nposts on the flank.  Local Reserves may sometimes be required for local\r\ncounter-attacks, and in certain cases a General Reserve is provided.\r\nThe degree of Resistance to be offered by the Sentry Groups depends on\r\nthe tactical situation and will be specified by the Outpost commander.\r\nIn certain cases the Sentry Groups are permitted in face of a heavy\r\nattack to fall back to the Piquets, but if they do so they must be\r\nwarned of the danger of arriving headlong on the Piquet only just ahead\r\nof the enemy.  In consequence of this danger such retirements are\r\nrarely permissible at night.  The Piquets are generally posted on the\r\nOutpost Line of Resistance, in which case they hold their positions to\r\nthe last man and the last round, until further orders are received from\r\nthe commander of the force protected.\r\n\r\nDISTANCE.--The distance of the Outpost position from the troops\r\nprotected is regulated by the time the latter will require to prepare\r\nfor action and by the importance of preventing the enemy's field\r\nartillery from {132} approaching within effective range of the ground\r\non which these troops will deploy if attacked.  Heavy guns and mortars,\r\nalthough motor traction gives them great mobility, are unlikely to\r\naccompany the enemy's Advanced Guard, and preparation to withstand or\r\nprevent their fire will not usually be required from Outpost troops.\r\nThe effective range of shrapnel is 5,500 yards, the limit of the\r\neffective range of machine guns is 2,000 yards, and of Lewis guns and\r\nrifles the effective limit is 1,400 yards.  The position on which the\r\nMain Body will deploy will thus be protected from the shrapnel of field\r\nartillery, if the possible fire-positions of that arm are brought under\r\neffective fire from machine guns 3,500 yards from the Position of\r\nDeployment, with Lewis guns and rifles about 500 yards further forward.\r\nOn the other hand, especially in the case of small forces (against\r\nwhich artillery will not be likely to be sent), the distance must not\r\nbe such as would permit of the Outposts being cut off, or as would\r\nnecessitate the employment of an undue proportion of men on Outpost\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTPOST COMMANDER.--Before halting, a commander should first decide\r\non his dispositions in case of attack, and then arrange the quartering\r\nof his command and the general position of the Outposts.  In the case\r\nof a small independent force the commander of the force will usually\r\nhimself detail the whole of the Outpost troops, and will either retain\r\nthe command in his own hand or appoint an officer to command them, In\r\nsuch a case the disposition of the troops will probably be that of a\r\nperimeter camp, preparation being made against attack from all\r\ndirections.  In the case of large bodies Outpost troops will usually\r\nconsist of all arms, and a definite commander will always be appointed.\r\nThis commander will, when necessary, divide the Outpost line into\r\nsectors, delegating responsibility for the holding of each sector to\r\nthe commander of a subordinate unit or formation, and defining the\r\nlimits {133} of sectors by distinctive features such as trees,\r\ncottages, or streams.  The tops of hills or the bottoms of valleys are\r\nnot suitable as tactical boundaries, and roads should be inclusive to\r\none or other sector, for a road used as a boundary may be neglected by\r\none of the commands it divides under the impression that it is the duty\r\nof the other command to patrol it.\r\n\r\nINFORMATION AND ORDERS.--The Outpost commander must have definite\r\ninformation on the following points:--\r\n\r\nI.  What is known of the enemy and information concerning friendly\r\nbodies of troops working against the enemy.\r\n\r\nII.  The intentions of the commander of the force he is protecting,\r\nwhere the Main Body will rest and the period it will stay there, and\r\nwhether it is intended to engage the enemy if he advances, and if so on\r\nwhat position.\r\n\r\nIII.  The general line of the Outposts, the troops at disposal for the\r\nwork, and whether there are other troops on the left and right.\r\n\r\nIV.  The hour at which the Outposts are to be relieved and the place to\r\nwhich reports are to be sent.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the above information he will give such orders as are\r\nimmediately necessary for protection against surprise.  He will then\r\nallot the task of Observation to his mobile troops and will decide on a\r\nLine of Resistance for the Outpost troops.  He will co-ordinate his\r\narrangements with those of neighbouring Outpost commanders and will\r\nensure that no ground on his flanks remains unwatched.\r\n\r\nThe Outpost commander will then issue orders to his subordinate\r\ncommanders on the following points:--\r\n\r\n(1) Information concerning the enemy and his own troops so far as they\r\naffect the Outposts.\r\n\r\n(2) The general line to be occupied and his frontage and limits of each\r\nsubordinate commander.\r\n\r\n(3) The distribution of the mobile troops, artillery, and machine guns.\r\n\r\n{134}\r\n\r\n(4) Instructions as to the degree of resistance to be offered and the\r\ngeneral line of the Outpost Line of Resistance.\r\n\r\n(5) Special arrangements by night.\r\n\r\n(6) Regulations as to smoking, fires, and cooking.\r\n\r\n(7) The hour at which the Outposts will be relieved.\r\n\r\n(8) The place to which reports are to be sent.\r\n\r\n(9) Instructions as to the accommodation of the Reserves (if any are\r\nprovided) and whether the Supports (and Reserves, if any) may take off\r\naccoutrements, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen he receives information that the Outposts are in position, he will\r\ntransmit the information to the commander who appointed him.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTPOST LINE OF RESISTANCE.--Retirements under fire to a supporting\r\nline are dangerous, especially at night.  As a general rule, therefore,\r\nthe Piquets should be posted on the Outpost Line of Resistance.\r\nCo-operation, intercommunication, and the exercise of command will be\r\nfacilitated by placing the Piquets along well-defined natural features,\r\nor in the vicinity of roads.  But the tactical situation may demand\r\nthat the line adopted should afford facilities for a most stubborn\r\nresistance as well as facilities for observation, and the former\r\nnecessity will far outweigh the latter.\r\n\r\nIf the force is likely to remain halted for several days, especially if\r\nthe operations are likely to lapse into Position Warfare, commanding\r\nground is of great value to the artillery, and the Outpost Line of\r\nResistance will probably develop into the Outpost zone of a defensive\r\nposition.  On the other hand, if halted for only one night, artillery\r\nwill not be largely employed, and commanding ground is not essential.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTPOST COMPANY.--The Outpost Company is the Outpost infantry unit,\r\nthe company commander providing Piquets, Supports, and Detached Posts\r\nas required.  Upon receiving his orders the commander will move his\r\ncommand, with due precautions against {135} surprise, to the allotted\r\nground where the men will be halted under cover.  Before proceeding to\r\nthe part of the line assigned to him the commander of the Outpost\r\ncompany will detail a force to precede his advance and cover his\r\noperations, and the force so pushed forward will not be withdrawn until\r\nhis Piquets have entrenched themselves.  By the map he can decide the\r\nnumber of Piquets he will require, in accordance with the number of\r\nroads to be watched, the facilities for resistance, and the\r\nrequirements for patrolling.  The extent of frontage allotted to an\r\nOutpost company depends upon the number of avenues of approach (roads\r\nand tracks, and open, unfenced country) to be watched, and under\r\nordinary circumstances a frontage up to 1,500 or 2,000 yards may be\r\nallotted to a company with 4 platoons at fighting strength.  Each\r\nPiquet should consist of a complete unit and should be posted on a good\r\ndefensive position.  The Support (or Supports, if more than one is\r\ndetailed for the company frontage) should also be composed of a\r\ncomplete unit, and should generally be posted 400 to 800 yards in rear\r\nof the Piquets, with good lines of approach to each.  _Detached Posts_\r\nmay be required, to watch an extreme flank, or to occupy a position in\r\nfront of the Sentry line, where the enemy might otherwise collect\r\nunseen for the attack or initiate steps for hostile reconnaissance.  A\r\nfurther use is to deal with traffic through the line, where a main road\r\nhas no Piquet upon it.  The Outpost company commander must inform his\r\nPiquet commander, and his immediate superior, of his position, as all\r\nreports received by the Piquets require to be sent to him, and his\r\nsuperior commander will need to keep in communication with him at all\r\ntimes.  The first duty of a Piquet commander (who is almost invariably\r\na Platoon commander) is to consolidate his position by entrenchment and\r\nby all available means, and to prepare a range card, so that the enemy\r\nmay not approach without heavy loss; and if the Piquet has a Support\r\nordered to reinforce it in case {136} of attack, the entrenchments must\r\nbe constructed to accommodate the supporting troops (including the\r\nSentry Groups thrown out, if these have been ordered to withdraw to the\r\nPiquet in case of a heavy attack).  The commander must impress on all\r\nmen of his Piquet the importance of gaining a clear mental picture of\r\ntheir surroundings while daylight lasts, so that they may the more\r\neasily find their way about by night.  On his way to the position the\r\nPiquet commander will decide from the map what roads he has to watch\r\nand where sentries will need to be posted, and he will provide from his\r\nplatoon, patrols and sentries (with the necessary reliefs for the\r\npatrols), will detail the various duties, and will make the necessary\r\nsanitary arrangements.  His sentries should be posted as expeditiously\r\nas possible, and his patrols sent out at once.  The number of patrols\r\nto be furnished depends upon the nature of the country, and as each\r\npatrol requires two reliefs, their number should not be greater than\r\ncircumstances demand.  The duties of infantry patrols are to search the\r\nground and buildings, etc., for about 2,000 yards in front of the\r\nsentry line, to find out whether the enemy is there or not, and if the\r\nenemy is found to be close at hand to watch his movements and report\r\nfrequently.  The number of Sentry Groups depends upon the nature of the\r\ncountry and the height of the line of observation, but between them the\r\ngroups must be answerable for the whole of the ground in front of their\r\nPiquet (up to its junction on the left and right with neighbouring\r\nPiquets).  A Sentry Group consists of 6 men under a N.C.O. (2 on duty\r\nand 4 off), and groups are usually posted not more than 400 yards from\r\ntheir Piquet, and hold their ground unless ordered to withdraw.  If\r\ninvisible from their Piquet a connecting sentry should be posted by the\r\nPiquet commander.  Sentry Groups required for night dispositions only\r\nwill not be posted until after dark.  In order to prevent the men of\r\nthe Piquet being unnecessarily disturbed at night the N.C.O. and {137}\r\nmen of each relief must be made to bivouac together, apart from other\r\nreliefs and from the remainder of the Piquet.  A sentry will always be\r\nposted over the Piquet, to watch the Sentry Groups and connecting\r\nsentries, and ready to alarm the Piquet at any moment of need.  Patrols\r\nconsist as a rule of a complete unit of 3 to 8 men under a N.C.O., and\r\nshould be formed of men trained as scouts, although it will sometimes\r\nbe possible to use only single scouts for this purpose, owing to the\r\nvigilance of the enemy.  Standing patrols may also have to be\r\nfurnished, if required to watch some special point, particularly at\r\nnight, or at the junction of roads converging towards the Piquet line,\r\nat cross roads, etc., when they are out of sight of the sentries.  The\r\nPiquet will stand to arms, every man in his allotted place, an hour\r\nbefore dawn, and will remain alert until the patrols (which are\r\ninvariably sent out about that time) have reported absence of movement\r\nby the enemy.  Outposts are generally relieved at dawn, so that the\r\nforce is doubled at the hour of danger.  All troops in the Outpost Line\r\nmust entrench themselves, if posted as sentries, or in the Piquet or\r\nSupport positions, and must be ready at any moment to resist a sudden\r\nattack.  A detachment of Royal Engineers will usually be available to\r\nsuperintend the consolidation of the main position.\r\n\r\nDAY AND NIGHT WORK.--By day, the work of an Outpost Line will consist\r\nin Reconnaissance of the approaches for some miles by the Aircraft and\r\nmounted troops and cyclists, while infantry, with artillery and machine\r\nguns, hold the Line of Resistance.  By night, the mounted troops will\r\nbe withdrawn, except such \"Cossack Posts\" (standing patrols of mounted\r\ntroops) and \"Vedettes\" (mounted sentries), as it may be deemed\r\nnecessary to leave established in front of the line, while Aircraft\r\nwill have much difficulty in discerning movement.  The whole work of\r\nobservation and resistance therefore falls on the infantry, who may be\r\nin their day {138} position or may be withdrawn to the reverse slope of\r\na ridge, in order to obtain a sky line by night upon which to train\r\ntheir rifles.\r\n\r\nNeglect of the Principles of War is almost inevitably followed by\r\ndisaster, and Protection is the first of the Tactical Principles.\r\nDuring the later stages of the Franco-Prussian War a French force of\r\nthe strength of a brigade was billeted in the _Chateau of Chambord_\r\n(December 9, 1870), which stands in a large park, near Blois.  No\r\noutpost precautions were taken, and the Chateau was captured by two\r\ncompanies of Prussian infantry.  The minor disasters suffered by\r\nBritish arms in the South African War were almost entirely due to\r\nneglect of the warnings contained in the official text-books.  In spite\r\nof the established superiority of the Boers in mobility and vigilance\r\nthe most elementary precautions against surprise were frequently\r\nneglected.  At _Tweefontein_ (December 24, 1901) a force of Yeomanry\r\nwas surprised in an unprotected camp by a mobile force of Boers, and\r\nheavy losses were suffered.  The mystic atmosphere of Christmas Eve was\r\ninsufficient protection against the militancy of Christian De Wet.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OUTPOSTS.--When a battle dies down at night, or when the forces\r\nare in close proximity and a battle is imminent, the whole of the\r\ntroops must be kept in readiness for instant action.  Protection by\r\nOutposts in the normal formation is generally impossible and can only\r\nbe provided by patrols, who keep touch with the enemy without causing\r\nunnecessary alarms or looking for purposeless encounters, and by\r\nsentries over the Forward Troops, which take the place of the Piquets.\r\nThe troops must be ready at any moment to repel attacks with bullets\r\nand bayonets.  Unless otherwise ordered, the patrols should refrain\r\naltogether from aggressive action and should confine their operations\r\nto secret observation of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, essential that touch with the enemy {139} should be\r\nmaintained as advances, withdrawals, and other surprise movements, are\r\nusually prepared and often carried out under cover of darkness when\r\nhostile troops are within striking distance.  In the American Civil\r\nWar, by losing touch with the Northern Army, the Southern Army\r\npermitted it to escape although it had been very severely mauled.\r\nDuring the Third Battle of Ypres (July 31-November 6, 1917) the Allies\r\nrenewed the attack on a six-mile front from Zonnebeke to Langemarck\r\n(the junction of the Franco-British Armies in Flanders).  This action,\r\nknown as the _Battle of Broenbeck_, or _Brombeek_ (October 9, 1917),\r\nwas marked by the successful repulse of counter-attacks by the 1st\r\nBattalion Royal Newfoundland Regiment through the correct employment of\r\nBattle Outposts.  Germans massing for the counter-attack in Taube Farm\r\nwere pinned by Lewis-gun and rifle fire, while a message sent to the\r\nsupporting artillery caused the annihilation of the enemy; another\r\nattacking force was destroyed by Lewis-gun and rifle fire, before it\r\nwas launched.  A defensive flank was also formed under heavy fire, and\r\nfrom this flank a further counter-attack was similarly dealt with.  The\r\ncasualties of the Newfoundlanders throughout this battle were 50\r\nkilled, 14 missing, and 132 wounded out of a total strength of 500 all\r\nranks, and the losses inflicted by them probably exceeded 800.\r\n\r\nAfter the _Battle of Fredericksburg_ (December 13, 1862) the Army of\r\nthe Potomac under Gen. Burnside eluded the vigilance of Gen. R. E. Lee,\r\nwho had defeated it on December 13, 1862.  Burnside withdrew (December\r\n15, 1862) across the Potomac to Stafford Heights with the whole of his\r\narmy, under cover of a heavy storm.  If special orders had been given\r\nby the Outpost commanders for constant and vigorous patrolling, and if\r\nscouts had been instructed to penetrate the Federal lines from time to\r\ntime at all risks, Burnside could have been attacked at a disadvantage\r\nwhile on the move and should have been driven into the Potomac.  {140}\r\nDuring the battle itself a Confederate Brigade was surprised in its own\r\nfront line through failure to patrol a triangular wood which jutted out\r\nin front of the position and screened the brigade on the left with\r\nwhich touch was not maintained.  At all times of action with enemy\r\nforces all ground to the front or flank must be kept under close\r\nobservation, or surprise may lead to disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{141}\r\n\r\nTACTICAL RECONNAISSANCE\r\n\r\nReconnaissance during battle has been dealt with under \"Influences on\r\nthe Battle\" and in other lectures, and owing to the close connection\r\nbetween the two subjects a number of points concerning reconnaissance\r\nin general have been noted in dealing with Protection.  It has also\r\nbeen seen that observation by Aircraft, Patrols, and Sentries is\r\nessential to Protection both in Position Warfare and the War of\r\nManoeuvre, and that Reconnaissance is the essence of Protection.  There\r\nremain, however, two forms of Reconnaissance that have not yet been\r\nconsidered, namely: the Reconnaissance of a Position with a view to\r\nattacking it, and the Reconnaissance of an unoccupied position with a\r\nview to occupying it for defence.\r\n\r\nRECONNAISSANCE FOR ATTACK.--The first of these is the constant duty of\r\nall commanders in the line during Position Warfare, and it is carried\r\nout by Patrols and Raiding Parties, who provide information which\r\nsupplements the photographs and reports of the Air Service, and enables\r\na commander to arrive at a decision.  In a War of Manoeuvre\r\nreconnaissance by the Air Service is equally important, and it is\r\nsupplemented by the work of the Patrols of the Advanced Guard, but\r\nprincipally by that of specially selected Intelligence Officers,\r\nworking in conjunction with, or independent of, the Vanguard.  Such\r\nofficers would be in possession of information which it might not be\r\npossible to reveal to the commander of the Patrols of the Vanguard, and\r\ntheir special training would give an added value to their report.  The\r\nchief {142} points to be ascertained concerning a hostile position\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n   I.  The extent of the position occupied.\r\n\r\n  II.  Weak points of the position.\r\n\r\n III.  Points, the capture of which would facilitate enfilade or\r\n       reverse fire, and would thus render the rest of the position\r\n       untenable.\r\n\r\n  IV.  Best line of attack.\r\n\r\n   V.  Supporting positions, for covering, converging, enfilade,\r\n       and traversing fire.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to gather this information without alarming the\r\nenemy, or giving notice of impending attack.\r\n\r\nInformation on further points can be gained by fighting, and\r\n_Reconnaissance by Raids_ is a common feature of Position Warfare.  By\r\nsuch means additional information can be gained, as to:--\r\n\r\n   VI.  Names of regiments holding the position, judged from\r\n        identity discs, badges, buttons, etc.\r\n\r\n  VII.  Whether preparations are being made for an attack\r\n        (discoverable by ear as well as eye), or bombardment, etc.\r\n        (from examination of shell dumps, etc.).\r\n\r\n VIII.  Position of machine guns (Pill-boxes or other), mortars, etc.\r\n\r\n   IX.  Condition of intervening ground and of the wire entanglements.\r\n\r\n    X.  Effects of recent bombardments.\r\n\r\n   XI.  Moral of the enemy.\r\n\r\nRECONNAISSANCE FOR OCCUPATION.--In the Reconnaissance of a Position\r\nwith a view to occupying it for the purposes of receiving attack, the\r\npoints to be noted are:--\r\n\r\n    I.  The best line for the establishment of a series of mutually\r\n        supporting tactical points to be held by the infantry.\r\n\r\n{143}\r\n\r\n   II.  The best means of protecting the flanks.\r\n\r\n  III.  The best position for the artillery and machine guns.\r\n\r\n   IV.  The tactical key to the position.\r\n\r\n    V.  The line from which attack may be expected.\r\n\r\n   VI.  The best line for the counter-attack.\r\n\r\n  VII.  The positions for the supports and reserves.\r\n\r\nand, additionally, in the case of a War of Manoeuvre:--\r\n\r\n VIII.  The best position for the cavalry.\r\n\r\n   IX.  Alternative positions in rear from which, after\r\n        reorganisation, to recapture the front line, with the best\r\n        line of withdrawal to them.\r\n\r\nAdditional information would be required in Position Warfare as to the\r\nbest lines for avenues communicating from the old to the new position,\r\nand as to the time required to consolidate the new position against\r\nattack (including the conversion of the parados into parapet, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{144}\r\n\r\nNIGHT OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why darkness is preferable to daylight in\r\ncertain military operations.  Secrecy is usually the aim of all movement,\r\nand the increased power of observation due to the advent of the Air\r\nService has caused an increase in the necessity for certain movements\r\nbeing made during the hours of darkness.  In all Night Operations (except\r\nmarches undertaken by night to avoid the heat of the day) surprise is the\r\nmain object; secrecy of preparation is therefore essential, and steps\r\nmust be taken to prevent discovery of the intended movement, and to\r\nprevent the information leaking out through the indiscretion of\r\nsubordinates.  Orders will be communicated beforehand only to those\r\nofficers from whom action is required, and until the troops reach the\r\nposition of assembly no more should be made known to them than is\r\nabsolutely necessary.  It may even be advisable, in order to deceive\r\nspies, that misleading orders should originally be given out.  Secrecy of\r\nintention as well as of preparation is essential.  Frederick the Great is\r\nreported to have said, \"If I thought my coat knew my plans I would burn\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nNIGHT MARCHES.--Night Marches are the movement of columns in march\r\nformation, and their object may be merely to avoid the heat of the day;\r\nbut they are also one of the chief means by which a commander can outwit,\r\ndeceive, and surprise the enemy--the principal aim of the strategist--by\r\noutflanking his position, by anticipating him in the occupation of a\r\nlocality, or by eluding him by the secret withdrawal of a force which\r\nappeared to be in a situation favourable to his plans.  {145} Forces may\r\nalso be secretly concentrated to decide the issue of a battle that is\r\nimminent, or of a battle that has begun in daylight.  Long marches of\r\nthis nature rarely culminate in an attack, and when shorter movements are\r\nmade with such an object in view, the \"March\" may be said to terminate\r\nwhen the Position of Assembly is reached, and from that point to become\r\nan \"Advance\" or an \"Assault.\"  There are certain essentials to success:--\r\n\r\nI.  _Direction_ towards the objective must always be maintained.  The\r\nroute must therefore be reconnoitred beforehand, and marked by the\r\nAdvanced Guard during the march, and if there are any intricacies in the\r\nroute, such as deviations from a well-defined road, local guides should\r\nbe secured.  Across open country a general direction can be maintained by\r\nmeans of the stars, and when these are not visible, by the compass.  (See\r\nChapter VIII., \"Manual of Map Reading.\")\r\n\r\nII.  _Protection_ against surprise attacks must be provided by Advanced,\r\nFlank, and Rear Guards, but (except in the obvious case of columns of\r\nmounted troops only) mounted troops will not be employed in this service.\r\nThe Advanced Guard will be small, and will usually consist of Patrols\r\nwithin 100 yards of the column, followed by connecting files, with the\r\nrest of the Advanced Guard in collective formation.  The Rear Guard will\r\nalso be smaller and nearer than during a daylight march.  Flanks will\r\nusually be protected by small bodies holding tactical positions, posted\r\nby the Advanced Guard, and withdrawn by the Rear Guard.\r\n\r\nIII.  _Secrecy_ must be maintained, and orders issued as late as\r\npossible, and the preparations carried on without ostentation.  The march\r\n{146} itself must be conducted in absolute silence and without lights of\r\nany kind.  Care must be taken to prevent or muffle sounds, and horses\r\nlikely to neigh must be left with the train.  In the case of a march to\r\nelude the enemy, Outposts will remain in position until daylight and will\r\nbe secretly withdrawn, to rejoin the column at the first opportunity, and\r\nbivouac fires, etc., will be kept burning.\r\n\r\nIV.  _Connection_.--Every commander must have and must maintain a fixed\r\nplace in the column, and an orderly officer must be detached from each\r\nunit to headquarters, so that instructions may be conveyed to such\r\ncommanders at all times.  Units must be closed up, and the usual\r\ndistances lessened or dispensed with, and connection must be maintained\r\nbetween units and their sub-divisions.  The pace should be uniform, but\r\nnot more than 2 miles an hour can be expected on a dark night, including\r\nhalts.  The time and periods of halts should be arranged before starting,\r\nand units must regain any distance lost before halting.  After crossing\r\nor clearing an obstacle the column should advance its own length and then\r\nbe halted until reported to be closed up again, and staff officers should\r\nbe detailed to superintend these matters.  In addition to these general\r\nprinciples there are certain axioms, which must become \"rules of thumb\"\r\nwith all concerned:--\r\n\r\nAn officer must march in rear of each unit.\r\n\r\nAll ranks must be informed what to do in case of alarm or attack.\r\n\r\nFire will not be opened without orders.\r\n\r\nMagazines will be charged, but no cartridge placed in the chamber.\r\n\r\nThere must be absolute silence, no smoking, no lights.\r\n\r\n{147}\r\n\r\nWhen halted, men may lie down in their places, but must not quit the\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nNIGHT ADVANCES.--Night advances are the movement of deployed troops to\r\ngain ground towards the hostile position with a view to delivering an\r\nassault at dawn.  They may take place as a preliminary to an engagement,\r\nor to continue one already begun with increased prospects of success.  In\r\nthe first case they are usually the sequel to a Night March, and in\r\neither case they are generally followed by an attack at dawn.  Surprise\r\nis the main object, even when they are undertaken for the purpose of\r\ngaining ground difficult to cross in daylight, from which to renew an\r\nengagement, as frequently happens during a campaign in a War of\r\nManoeuvre, while such advances are common features of Position Warfare.\r\nIn any case the ground won must be consolidated immediately, as a\r\ncounter-attack at or before dawn may always be expected, and if the\r\nground offers difficulties for entrenching, the necessary materials must\r\nbe carried by the troops.  Successive advances of this nature may enable\r\nthe troops to reach a jumping-off place for the final assault, and such\r\nadvances may be made on successive nights, the ground won being defended\r\nmeanwhile against counter-attacks.  Unless troops are already deployed\r\nfor the advance, a Position of Assembly will need to be selected, with a\r\nfurther Position of Deployment; but these positions sometimes coincide.\r\nThe deployment will be, as a rule, into shallow columns on a narrow\r\nfrontage at deploying intervals, in order that the final deployment of\r\nthe leading columns into the Forward Troops of the Attack may take place\r\nwithout delay when the moment for the assault arrives.  On reaching the\r\nobjective of the advance these columns would deploy into line, and each\r\nunit would entrench itself on the new position.  As it is essential for\r\nsuccess that _direction_ should be maintained and _connection_ preserved,\r\nthe ground over which the advance is to be made must be {148} examined\r\nbeforehand and landmarks noted, and touch must be kept by means of ropes\r\nor any available device.  Care must also be taken in consolidating the\r\nposition that the entrenchments have a general alignment towards the\r\nenemy and that they are so sited as to protect from enfilade fire.\r\n\r\nNight Assaults.--Night Assaults are delivered by troops already deployed\r\ninto attack formation.  It is an established tactical principle that\r\n\"when the conditions of the fire-fight are likely to be favourable, it is\r\nprobably better to accept the inevitable casualties that must result from\r\na struggle for fire supremacy, rather than adopt the undoubted hazards of\r\na night assault.\"  These conditions are frequently so unfavourable in\r\nPosition Warfare, owing to the strength of consolidated positions and to\r\nthe increasing accuracy and density of artillery fire, that assaults are\r\nmade of necessity in the hours of darkness, in preference to those of\r\ndaylight.  During the _Battle of the Somme_ (July 1-17, 1916) a night\r\nadvance was made by seven divisions on a front of about 4 miles.  The\r\ntroops moved out in the early hours of July 14, for a distance of about\r\n1,400 yards, and lined up in the darkness below a crest some 300 to 500\r\nyards from the enemy's trenches.  Their advance was covered by strong\r\npatrols and their correct deployment had been ensured by white tapes laid\r\nout on the ground earlier in the night of July 13-14.  The whole movement\r\nwas carried out unobserved and without touch being lost in any case.  The\r\nassault was delivered at 3.25 a.m., when there was just sufficient light\r\nto be able to distinguish friend from foe at short range, and along the\r\nwhole front attacked the troops were preceded by an effective artillery\r\nbarrage.  They swept over the enemy's first-line trenches and\r\nconsolidated their position in the defences beyond.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 10-11, 1917, the 32nd Division attacked and\r\ncaptured 1,500 yards of trench {149} line at the foot of the _Serre\r\nHill_.  The division formed up after dark and the attack began at 8.30\r\np.m., the objective was captured, and at 5 a.m. a determined\r\ncounter-attack was repulsed.  The capture of the _Vimy Ridge_ by Canadian\r\ntroops was due to an assault launched some time before dawn on April 9,\r\n1917: and the British victory of Messines (June 7, 1917) to an assault\r\nlaunched at 3.10 a.m.  In the latter case the Wytschaete-Messines\r\nposition, \"one of the Germans' most important strongholds on the Western\r\nFront, consisted of forward defences with an elaborate and intricate\r\nsystem of well-wired trenches and strong points, forming a defensive belt\r\nover a mile in depth, and the Germans had omitted no precautions to make\r\nthe position impregnable\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).  Nineteen deep\r\nmines under this position were fired at 3.10 a.m., and this was the\r\nsignal for the assault, which was immediately successful and was carried\r\nout under intense artillery protecting fire.  By nightfall of June 7 the\r\nwhole position had been recaptured, heavy losses inflicted, and over\r\n7,000 prisoners taken at a comparatively slight cost, by the II. Army,\r\nunder General Sir H. C. O. Plumer.  During the German offensive in 1918 a\r\ncounter-attack by three brigades was launched by night against the\r\nvillage of _Villers Brétonneux_.  The attack was launched at 10 p.m. on\r\nthe night of April 24-25.  By daybreak the village was surrounded, and by\r\nthe afternoon it was entirely recaptured with upwards of 1,000 prisoners.\r\nAmong the offensive operations which preceded the general advance of the\r\nAllies in July, 1918, was a highly successful night attack by the 2nd\r\nAustralian Division, on a front of about 2 miles, south of _Morlancourt_\r\n(June 10, 1918).  At 4.35 a.m. on May 12, 1864, one of General Ulysses\r\nGrant's Corps, under General Hancock, assaulted \"the Salient,\" part of\r\nGeneral Robert Lee's entrenchments in The Wilderness of Virginia\r\n(_Spottsylvania_).  20,000 men were assembled and a night advance was\r\nmade, {150} directed by compass, on an unusually dark and stormy night,\r\nwith part of the line of the advance densely wooded.  The assault was\r\nordered for 4 a.m., but a dense fog delayed the signal until 4.35 a.m.\r\nWhen the order was given, one of the divisions had some difficulty in\r\nmaking its way through a wood and marsh, but contrived to keep up with\r\nthe others, and reached the abattis at the same time.  The assault\r\nresulted in the capture of 4,000 prisoners and inflicted losses with the\r\nbayonet of over 2,000, with a total loss to the assailants of about\r\n2,000.  This manoeuvre consisted of a night march by compass of a whole\r\ncorps to a Position of Assembly within 1,200 yards of the hostile\r\noutposts, of an advance before dawn, and of a final assault of 20,000\r\ntroops.  The captured salient was afterwards retaken by the Confederates\r\nby a decisive counter-attack, rendered possible by the provision, in rear\r\nof the salient, of a second line of entrenchments (see _Battle of\r\nSpottsylvania_).\r\n\r\nOwing to the risks of confusion and the limitations imposed on the\r\nattacking movement, Night Assaults do not now carry the same comparative\r\nadvantages over Daylight Attacks as was the case before the introduction\r\nof _Smoke_.  Hence they will be restricted to attacks on a very limited\r\nobjective, as in the case of raids or attempts to capture special\r\ntactical localities.  But by employing Smoke only two elements of\r\nSurprise can be achieved.  The _direction_ and _weight_ of the blow are\r\nconcealed, but the appearance of Smoke will warn the enemy to expect an\r\nattack, and the _time_ of the blow is thus revealed.  Smoke will probably\r\nbe employed extensively in modern warfare and, except against an\r\nill-trained and undisciplined enemy, assaults by night will generally be\r\nundertaken to gain tactical points, to drive in advanced troops and\r\nOutposts, to capture advanced and detached posts, to rush an isolated\r\nforce guarding a bridge or defile, and in carrying out enterprises of a\r\nsimilar nature, in order to gain advantages {151} for further operations\r\nin daylight.  When more important assaults are made, a larger force than\r\na brigade will seldom be thrown against a single objective, although a\r\nseries of objectives may be simultaneously attacked with success over a\r\nwide front.  A Night Assault was delivered by two Federal brigades on the\r\nConfederate bridgehead at _Rappahannock Station_ (November 7, 1863).  One\r\nof the brigades was ultimately repulsed, but the other penetrated the\r\nConfederate position and cut off the retreat.  Upwards of 1,500 of the\r\ndefenders were captured or killed, and the small remnant evacuated the\r\nbridgehead.  In the Second Afghan War, General Sir F. Roberts marched up\r\nto the high passes leading out of the Kurram into the interior of\r\nAfghanistan, with a column of 3,200 all ranks and 13 guns.  He was\r\nopposed by the Amir's force of about 18,000 men with 11 guns at _Peiwar\r\nKotal_ (December 2, 1878).  Sir F. Roberts detached the greater part of\r\nhis force to occupy the heights on the flank of the Afghan position and\r\nattacked at daylight.  The Night March and subsequent attack were\r\ncompletely successful.  The enemy was defeated with great loss and all\r\nhis guns captured, the British losses being 20 killed and 78 wounded.\r\n_Tel-el-Kebir_ was an example of a Night March in battle formation of a\r\nforce of 11,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, and 60 guns, to attack an\r\nentrenched position at dawn, the object being to surprise the enemy and\r\nto cross the danger zone without exposing the assaulting troops to a\r\nprolonged fire action.  It resulted in a victory which decided the\r\nEgyptian campaign, and added the Nile Valley to the British Empire.  Sir\r\nGarnet Wolesley's force advanced in four columns marching abreast, with\r\nits left resting on the railway, and was successfully carried out, the\r\ntroops reaching a position, varying from 300 to 900 yards distance from\r\nthe objective, the assault being delivered at the conclusion of the\r\nmarch.  The Egyptian Army, under Arabi Pasha, fought steadily, and again\r\nand again renewed the fight, after falling back {152} within their\r\nentrenchments, but their flank was turned and the whole position\r\ncaptured.  The British loss was only 459 all ranks, and the Egyptians\r\nlost upwards of 2,500 killed and wounded, the remaining 23,000 being\r\ndispersed or captured.  A daylight advance and assault of so strong a\r\nposition could not have been successfully carried through at so small a\r\ncost to the attacking troops.  In the South African War there were two\r\nexamples of the unsuccessful Night Attack.  Major-General Gatacre essayed\r\na Night March followed by a Night Attack upon the Boers' position at\r\n_Stormberg_ (December 10, 1899), but he was misled by his guides in\r\nunknown ground and was himself surprised by the Boers and forced to\r\nretire with a loss of over 700 officers and other ranks.  On the\r\nfollowing day Lord Methuen delivered an attack upon Cronje's position\r\nbetween the Upper Modder River and the Kimberley road.  In a Night Attack\r\non _Magersfontein Hill_ (December 11, 1899) the Highland Brigade came\r\nunder heavy fire while still in assembly formation and lost its Brigadier\r\n(A. G. Wauchope) and 750 officers and other ranks.  In the later stages\r\nof the South African War, however, Night Marches followed by Raids were\r\nemployed with marked success, particularly in the Eastern Transvaal in\r\nNovember and December, 1901.\r\n\r\nExcept when the assaulting troops are already in position, it will be\r\nnecessary to choose Positions of Assembly and of Deployment, and to\r\nprecede the advance in the preliminary stages by lines of scouts, ahead\r\nand on the flanks, within 100 yards of the following troops.  On arrival\r\nat the jumping-off place these advanced scouts will await the arrival of\r\nthe assaulting force, and they should be directed to mark the ground for\r\nthe various units.  A scout from each Forward Platoon can thus mark the\r\ninner flank on which his Platoon will rest, and the direction of the\r\nwhole line will be assured.\r\n\r\nThe troops will usually advance, during the earlier {153} stages, in\r\nshallow columns on narrow frontages, at deploying intervals, and may\r\nmaintain this formation until the halted line of scouts is reached.\r\nOwing to the frequent necessity for halts to correct intervals, etc., and\r\nthe inherent difficulties of movements by night in open formations, no\r\ngreater rate than 1 mile an hour can be counted on.  When several\r\nobjectives are in view a corresponding series of Positions of Assembly\r\nand Deployment will be required, and care must be taken that the various\r\nadvancing forces do not converge.\r\n\r\nOwing to the difficulty of recognition, a distinguishing mark will\r\nusually be worn by the troops engaged, a watchword will usually be\r\nadopted and made known to all ranks, and the commander and staff should\r\nwear easily distinguishable badges.  If hostile patrols are encountered\r\nit is essential that they should be silenced, and any one encountered who\r\nis deficient of the badge and ignorant of the watchword should be\r\nsimilarly treated.\r\n\r\nThe risk of an assault being held up by unforeseen obstacles must also be\r\nprovided against, and Engineers or Pioneer Infantry should be present for\r\nremoving such obstacles.  If fire is opened by the enemy it is clear that\r\nall hope of surprise has vanished, and the troops must then press on at\r\nall costs; for if they advance as rapidly as possible they have a\r\nreasonable prospect of achieving their object, whereas a halt will\r\nincrease the enemy's power of resistance, and withdrawal will almost\r\ncertainly end in disaster.\r\n\r\nIn order that secrecy may be observed, details of the assault will\r\nusually be withheld from all except superior commanders from whom action\r\nis required, until the Position of Assembly is reached; but before the\r\ntroops leave that position all ranks must be made to understand the\r\nobjective in general, the particular task of the unit, and the formation\r\nto be adopted at the Position of Deployment.  In addition to this\r\ninformation, and to a knowledge of the general tactical principles\r\ninvolved, {154} there are certain axioms which must become \"rules of\r\nthumb\" with all ranks:--\r\n\r\nFire must not be opened without orders.\r\n\r\nMagazines must be charged but no cartridge placed in the chamber.\r\n\r\nUntil daylight the bayonet only to be used.\r\n\r\nAbsolute silence to be maintained until the signal for the assault is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nNo smoking; no lights.\r\n\r\nIf obstacles are encountered each man will lie down in his place until\r\nthey are removed.\r\n\r\nIf hostile fire is opened, all ranks must press on at once with the\r\nutmost spirit and determination and overpower the enemy with the bayonet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{155}\r\n\r\nFIGHTING IN CLOSE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nClose country has a marked influence on Tactics owing to the\r\nrestrictions it imposes on view and on movement.  Forest, jungle, and\r\nbush, mountains and ravines, rivers and streams are natural obstacles,\r\nwhile cultivation adds woods and plantations, fences and hedges, high\r\ngrowing crops, farm houses, villages and towns, with sunken roads below\r\nthe surface of the adjoining land, and civilisation brings in its train\r\na network of railways and canals with embankments and bridges, and the\r\nnatural difficulties of close country are thereby increased.  The\r\nobstruction to movement is more or less constant, except in\r\n\"continental\" climates, where frost and snow render movement possible\r\nin winter over the deepest rivers or marshes, and over roads and tracks\r\nwhich are scarcely practicable in the summer season.  The obstruction\r\nto view is greater when trees and hedges are in leaf than when the\r\nleaves have fallen.\r\n\r\nWhen the advantages and disadvantages of fighting in close country are\r\nweighed in the balance there appears to be a distinct tendency in\r\nfavour of the Attack over the Defence.\r\n\r\nAn Attacking force can usually obtain cover in the early stages of the\r\naction and loss can therefore be avoided in approaching the objective,\r\nwhile the screening of its movements and dispositions generally enables\r\nthe Attacking force to surprise the Defence as to the direction and\r\nweight of the blow to be delivered.  Troops fighting in close country\r\nare often unable to see what is going on around them, and the \"sense of\r\nsecurity\" is lessened by the knowledge that a flank may be successfully\r\nassailed without warning.  This favours the {156} Attack more than the\r\nDefence, as the counter-attack, which is the soul of all defensive\r\noperations, requires previous organisation to be thoroughly effective.\r\n\r\nSAVAGE WARFARE.--In Savage Warfare the inherent difficulties of\r\nfighting in close country are often increased by the disparity of\r\nnumbers on the side of the civilised troops and by the fanatical\r\ncourage of the savages.  Discipline, self-reliance, vigilance, and\r\njudgment in the application of the Principles of War, are required to\r\novercome these added difficulties.  A vigorous offensive, Strategical\r\nas well as Tactical, is _always_ the best method of conducting\r\noperations in Savage Warfare, and for the purpose of Protection\r\nvigilance must be exercised to an even greater degree than in any other\r\nform of warfare.  At _Isandhlwana_ (January 22, 1879) the British camp\r\nat the foot of Isandhlwana Hill was surprised and overwhelmed by a Zulu\r\nArmy, 10,000 strong, and almost the whole of the garrison killed; and\r\nyet in the evening of the same day 120 all ranks (40 sick being\r\nincluded in that number) beat off the repeated attacks of 4,000 Zulus\r\nat _Rorke's Drift_.  In the operations after the fall of Khartoum a\r\ndesert column under Major-General Sir J. McNeill was surprised in dense\r\nbush while constructing a zeriba at _Tofrik_ (March 22, 1885), but\r\nafter twenty minutes' fierce fighting the Mahdist Arabs were driven off\r\nwith more than 1,000 killed.  In the operations in Upper Egypt against\r\nthe invading Mahdists a vigorous strategical and tactical offensive led\r\nto the _Battle of Toski_ (August 3, 1889) and resulted in the defeat\r\nand complete destruction of the invaders, with but slight loss to the\r\nAnglo-Egyptian force under General Sir F. W. Grenfell.  At the\r\nbeginning of the Christian Era three well-disciplined Roman legions\r\nwere decoyed into the fastnesses of the _Teutoberger Wald_ (A.D. 9) and\r\nthere attacked and annihilated by the Cherusci, a Saxon tribe, under\r\ntheir king Arminius, and this defeat of Quintilius Varus is included by\r\nSir Edward Creasey among the {157} \"Fifteen Decisive Battles of the\r\nWorld.\"  Fighting in close country against more or less savage tribes\r\nis frequently the task of British troops in East and West Africa, while\r\nthe Indian Frontier constantly requires to be defended by expeditions\r\nagainst tribal levies in hilly and mountainous districts.  In \"Field\r\nService Regulations\" (Part II.), 1921, the peculiarities of various\r\nsavage races by whom the Outposts of the British Empire are liable to\r\nbe assailed are carefully noted.\r\n\r\nIN CIVILIZED WARFARE.--The military history of Europe and America\r\nabounds with accounts of fierce fighting in close country.  In all ages\r\nwoods and villages play an important part in war.  They form natural\r\nmagnets for troops operating in their neighbourhood.  The fact of their\r\nbeing easily visible, and named on maps, causes them to be adopted as\r\nobjectives in the Attack or as boundaries in the Defence, and in all\r\noperations troops are instinctively drawn towards them in search of\r\ncover, or to obtain water, supplies, and shelter.  Their situation is\r\nalso likely to make them of tactical importance, as woods are\r\nfrequently on the slopes of hills and may be occupied in a defensive\r\nscheme to force an assailant to deploy before reaching the main\r\nposition, while villages are naturally situated on roads, which must be\r\nguarded as they are the normal avenues of approach for all troops.  In\r\nPosition Warfare the wood and the village are of the highest\r\nimportance, and whenever they are situated along the alignment, or near\r\nthe front, of a defensive position, they may always be assumed to be\r\noccupied and strongly organised as part of a series of mutually\r\nsupporting tactical points.  The names of woods, large and small, and\r\nof the most insignificant villages, were of everyday occurrence in\r\nreports on the fighting on the Western Front in the Great War as the\r\nscene of furious encounters, of attacks and counter-attacks, and there\r\nare 67 references to copses, woods, and forests in Marshal Haig's\r\nDispatches.  It {158} appears, however, to be generally admitted that\r\nclose country in general, and woods and villages in particular, favour\r\nDelaying Action rather than a protracted Defence, and in Position\r\nWarfare the advantages are therefore in favour of the Attack on account\r\nof the facilities offered for surprise through the concealment of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of successful Delaying Action in woods and\r\nvillages.  Some of the characteristics of such fighting were\r\nexemplified in the Franco-Prussian War.  At the _Battle of Gravelotte_\r\n(August 18, 1870) the Bois de Vaux, on the left of the French position,\r\ninduced Marshal Bazaine to mass his reserves on that flank, as it\r\nappeared to invite attack; whereas he was defeated by a turning\r\nmovement on the _other_ flank.  During an attack through the Bois de\r\nVaux a Prussian infantry battalion became so scattered that all\r\ncohesion was lost, a common danger in wood fighting.  At the earlier\r\n_Battle of Spicheren_ (August 6, 1870), however, two battalions\r\nmaintained their order and cohesion in Pfaffen Wood, and by moving\r\nthrough it in narrow columns were able to debouch in good order.  A\r\ntendency to loss of discipline through loss of control was exemplified\r\nat the same battle.  Other Prussian troops had captured Gifert Wood and\r\nthe officers were unable to organise an attack on a further position\r\nthrough the reluctance of the troops to leave the shelter of the wood.\r\nAt the _Battle of Worth_ (August 6, 1870) two French battalions held up\r\nthe attack of 18,000 Prussians for over an hour in the Niederwald,\r\nalthough no fortifications were employed; the difficulty of debouching\r\nfrom a captured wood was then experienced by the Prussians, as the\r\nfarther edge was kept under heavy fire by French troops in the\r\nneighbouring Elsasshausen Copse.  A decisive counter-attack cannot\r\nusually be organised in such warfare, although Lee managed to employ\r\n17,000 troops for that purpose with complete success at the _Battle of\r\nthe Wilderness_ (May 5-6, 1864).  Local {159} counter-attacks, however,\r\nare the normal incidents of defensive operations in woods, and in the\r\nNiederwald, at the _Battle of Worth_, several spirited counter-attacks\r\nwere made by the 96th French Regiment.\r\n\r\nVillages are even more attractive to troops than woods, and they figure\r\nin all battles as local centres of resistance.  One of the most\r\nspirited defences of a village took place at the _Battle of Sedan_\r\n(September 1, 1870) when a heroic struggle was maintained by French\r\nmarine infantry in the village of _Bazeilles_, and after the white flag\r\nhad been hoisted over the Fortress of Sedan the fight was stubbornly\r\nmaintained at the village of Balan, the second line of defence of the\r\nBazeilles position.  Visitors to the battlefield of Sedan are shown a\r\nlittle inn with the title, _A La Dernière Cartouche_, in commemoration\r\nof the struggle.  A highly successful Night Attack was made by the\r\nFrench on the village of _Noisseville_ (August 31, 1870), the normal\r\ndifficulties of defending the village being increased by the surprise\r\nand the darkness.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACK ON WOODS.--The opening stages of the attack on a wood\r\nresemble those in the attack on any other position, but once the outer\r\nfringe is gained the potential advantages offered by the narrow field\r\nof view and fire must be exploited to the full and surprise at weak\r\npoints must be achieved.  Flank attacks are exceptionally deadly under\r\nthese circumstances, as they may succeed before the other defending\r\ntroops are aware of the threatened attack, but the utmost precaution is\r\nnecessary to avoid traps, and scouts must precede all movement, while\r\nadvances must be made by rapid bounds to avoid aimed fire at close\r\nrange.  Supports and reserves must follow close to the forward troops\r\nin order to preserve cohesion and to afford immediate help.  Machine\r\nguns and light mortars are of very great value to give close support,\r\nthe latter taking the place of artillery and inflicting losses on {160}\r\nstockaded defenders.  Small woods should usually be attacked from the\r\nflanks under heavy fire from artillery until the attack turns inwards,\r\nwhile machine guns and Lewis guns are posted to prevent reinforcements\r\nreaching the wood and to cut off the retreat of the defenders.  During\r\nthe German counter-attacks at Cambrai (November 30-December 4, 1917)\r\n_Tanks_ were effectively employed in wood and village fighting, and\r\nwere in a great measure responsible for the capture of _Gauche Wood_,\r\nacting in co-operation with dismounted Indian cavalry of the 5th\r\nCavalry Division and with the Guards' Division; but although they\r\nreached the outskirts of _Villers Guislain_ they were forced to\r\nwithdraw, as the supporting infantry were unable to co-operate owing to\r\nthe fire of the enemy's machine guns.  At the _Battle of Messines_\r\n(June 7, 1917) a tank enabled the infantry to proceed with the advance\r\nby overcoming the machine guns posted in Fanny's Farm.  Generally\r\nspeaking, however, tanks are unable to manoeuvre in woods, owing to the\r\nmany insuperable obstructions, and their sphere of usefulness is\r\nlimited by the availability of rides or other cleared avenues of\r\napproach.  During the fighting for the interior of the wood\r\n\"reconnaissance during battle\" is of the highest importance, and the\r\nflanks of the attacking force will need to be specially guarded, on\r\naccount of the liability to counter-attack.  Touch must also be kept,\r\nto avoid loss of direction.  In the _advance from the captured\r\nposition_ great tactical skill is required, and if the defenders have\r\nestablished a fire position within close range it may only be possible\r\nto issue from the wood when co-operating troops have cleared or\r\nneutralised that position.  It may even be necessary to hold the rear\r\nedge against counter-attack and to debouch, after reorganisation, from\r\nboth flanks or from the opposite edge, to advance in two bodies against\r\nthe flanks of the fire position under harassing fire from the troops in\r\nthe further edge.  If the fire position is to be carried by direct\r\nassault, or if {161} it can be got under control and the advance is to\r\nbe continued, the successful troops must be reorganised within the wood\r\n(care being taken to avoid concentration in salients) and must deploy\r\nbefore advancing, to bound forward in one rush until clear of the wood.\r\n\r\nDEFENCE OF A WOOD.--The outer edge of a wood is particularly\r\nvulnerable, but some portions of it must of necessity be occupied for\r\npurposes of observation and resistance (particularly at night), while\r\nthe unoccupied portions are heavily entangled and made subject to\r\nenfilade fire from the occupied positions, machine and Lewis guns being\r\nparticularly suitable for the defensive positions, in concealed and\r\nstrengthened emplacements.  The perimeter should be divided into\r\nsections garrisoned by complete units under definite commanders.  Lines\r\nof defence must also be established in the interior, and lateral\r\ncommunications opened up through the trees, with easily distinguished\r\nmarks to direct troops issuing to counter-attacks, and time will be\r\nsaved by making several tracks rather than one wide road.  The second\r\nline of defence should contain an all-round defensive position from\r\nwhich all avenues of approach can be swept by machine and Lewis guns,\r\nand this position should also provide facilities for sorties to\r\ncounter-attack.  If the wood is too far from the Outpost Zone of the\r\ndefence to serve as a factor in the scheme steps must be taken to\r\nneutralise the advantages offered to an attacking force in a concealed\r\navenue of approach, either by the use of gas, or by bringing such a\r\nfire on the exits from the wood that a debouching enemy may suffer\r\nheavy loss or annihilation.  In most cases, an attacking force will be\r\nharassed, and a show of opposition will be made, in such a wood by\r\n_fighting patrols_, and obstacles can be placed in the near edge, with\r\nentanglements outside, so planned as to induce the attacking force to\r\ncollect in lanes enfiladed by machine guns.\r\n\r\n{162}\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACK ON VILLAGES.--There are three phases in the attack on a\r\nvillage as in the attack on a wood.  In the fight for the outer edge,\r\nthe front will probably be harassed by a fire attack, while one or both\r\nflanks are assaulted by all four sections of the platoon, under cover\r\nof fire from machine guns and Lewis guns.\r\n\r\nThe second phase may require reorganisation before the attack on the\r\nvillage itself, during which, reconnaissance, co-operation, and\r\ndispatch of information, are of the highest importance.  All captured\r\npoints must be immediately consolidated and the attack must be\r\nprosecuted with the utmost vigour.  Troops must be trained to enter\r\nbuildings from the rear, and to advance along the right edge of roads,\r\nclose to the walls and buildings there, to make hostile fire difficult\r\nwithout undue exposure.  Light mortars and rifle bombs, which can be\r\nfired into windows partially barricaded, or to fall behind street\r\nbarricades, are an important adjunct to the rifle and bayonet, and\r\nmachine guns and Lewis guns will have many opportunities in assisting\r\nor repelling a counter-attack and of keeping down the enemy's fire from\r\na commanding position at the end of a street.  _The Tank_ is at its\r\nbest in this form of warfare, as it can surmount or demolish almost any\r\nstreet barricade, and can be followed up at once by the infantry, but\r\nit must always be regarded as an auxiliary to the infantry, and not as\r\na principal.\r\n\r\nIn the third phase, the advance from the captured village, while the\r\nsupports are \"mopping up\" such of the garrison as have survived the\r\ncapture, previous reorganisation and deployment will probably be as\r\nessential as in wood fighting, and during all the phases of the\r\nstruggle in woods and villages sudden counter-attacks must always be\r\nexpected and local reserves to repel them must be provided.  In issuing\r\nfrom the village, rapid bounds to points from which the fire positions\r\nin rear can be brought under control will also be required.\r\n\r\n{163}\r\n\r\nDEFENCE OF A VILLAGE.--It is difficult to avoid the inclusion of\r\nvillages in a scheme of defence on account of the facilities afforded\r\nfor water, cover, and shelter, but while villages assist in the\r\nDelaying Action they are liable to become \"shell traps\" in a prolonged\r\ndefence, unless there is good cellarage accommodation, while the local\r\neffect of a bursting shell is also increased.\r\n\r\nThere are certain principles common to all defensive action in village\r\nfighting:--\r\n\r\n(1) The garrison should consist of a definite unit or formation under a\r\ndefinite commander.\r\n\r\n(2) The forward troops should be posted in front of the edge of the\r\nvillage, partly because of the vulnerability of the actual edge to\r\nartillery fire but mainly to prevent the attack from establishing\r\nitself in the forward buildings.  In the case of a small village it\r\nwill often be advantageous to occupy positions on the flanks commanding\r\nthe edge by fire, with a view to enticing the attack into the \"funnel\"\r\nthus provided.\r\n\r\n(3) Supports and Reserves must be centralised in order that they may be\r\nreadily available for instantaneous local counter-attacks, by which\r\nmeans alone a village can be defended against a determined enemy.\r\n\r\n(4) Houses should be loopholed and windows sand-bagged, while\r\nhouse-to-house communication must be improvised to increase the\r\ndefenders' power of manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n(5) The interior of the village should be defended by the cross fire of\r\nmachine guns and Lewis guns, but while churches and halls, and the\r\ninner edge of village greens and of squares, should be prepared for\r\ndetermined resistance, such places should not be occupied as billets,\r\nowing to the risk of loss from artillery bombardment.\r\n\r\n(6) The natural difficulties of maintaining control in village fighting\r\nrequire to be counteracted by increased effort and vigilance on the\r\npart of all leaders, and special arrangements must be made for\r\ncollecting information in report centres, the position of which must be\r\nmade known to all ranks in the defending force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{164}\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS ARMS\r\n\r\n\"The full power of an army can be exerted only when all its parts act\r\nin close combination, and this is not possible unless the members of\r\neach arm understand the characteristics of the other arms.  Each has\r\nits special characteristics and functions, and is dependent on the\r\nco-operation of the others\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii.\r\n(1921)).\r\n\r\n\"An intelligent understanding of 'the other man's job' is the first\r\nessential of successful co-operation.\"--MARSHAL HAIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANTRY\r\n\r\n\"Infantry is the arm which in the end wins battles\" (\"Field Service\r\nRegulations,\" vol. ii. (1921)).  The speed with which infantry can\r\nadvance, and the distance which can be covered in one day, are the only\r\nlimits to the striking power of well-trained infantry.  In the Great\r\nWar these limits were largely removed by the use of Mechanical\r\nTransport, and this means of transportation will be used increasingly\r\nin Modern Warfare, in order to bring fresh troops into or near the\r\nscene of action, or to expedite the removal of exhausted troops from\r\nthe battlefield.  Against these natural limits to mobility are the\r\ncompensating advantages of the power of infantry to move into and over\r\nalmost any ground by day or by night, and the rapidity with which\r\ntrained infantrymen can find or improvise cover.\r\n\r\nThe main object of battle is to close with the enemy and to destroy him\r\nby killing or capture, and it is this power to close with the enemy\r\nwhich makes infantry the decisive arm in battle.\r\n\r\nTHE RIFLE AND BAYONET.--The rifle is the principal infantry weapon, and\r\nthe British \"Short-magazine {165} Lee-Enfield\" rifle is the best rifle\r\nin action.  A trained rifleman can fire 15 aimed shots in a minute,\r\nreloading with the butt in the shoulder and eyes on the mark.  With the\r\nbayonet affixed the rifle is the principal weapon of close combat for\r\ndelivering or repelling an assault, and in Night Assaults infantry\r\ndepend entirely upon the bayonet.\r\n\r\nTHE ENTRENCHING TOOL, carried by all other ranks, is an invaluable\r\nadjunct to the rifle bullet and to the bayonet.  In a War of Manoeuvre,\r\nwhen infantry are frequently compelled to improvise defences on the\r\nfield of battle, by night as well as by day, the value of the\r\nEntrenching Tool can scarcely be exaggerated.  In Position Warfare, and\r\nin the organisation of an area for prolonged defence in a War of\r\nManoeuvre, heavier tools and materials of all kinds are available for\r\nthe consolidation of the defences, but for the rapid construction of\r\ntemporary defences by day or by night the Entrenching Tool alone has\r\nbeen proved to be highly effective.  When troops are \"digging\r\nthemselves in\" at night with this weapon care must be taken that some\r\nsystem is adopted to obtain a more or less regular line facing in the\r\nright direction.  By the extension of the men of an infantry section at\r\narm's length facing the enemy, and by moving the two men on each flank\r\ntwo paces outwards, and the two centre men two paces backwards, and\r\nthen causing the section to dig \"on the line of their toes,\" there will\r\nresult (even on the darkest night) a short fire trench with a central\r\ntraverse.  This sectional trench can be connected at the first\r\nopportunity with trenches dug by other sections similarly extended.\r\nDuring the _Retreat from Mons_ (August-September, 1914) the\r\n\"Contemptible Little Army,\" under Marshal French, frequently obtained,\r\nby means of the Entrenching Tool alone, shelter from bullets, and a\r\nsystem of fire trenches which cost the pursuing Germans hundreds of\r\nlives and materially delayed their movements.\r\n\r\n{166}\r\n\r\nTHE LEWIS GUN.--The Lewis gun is an automatic rifle, firing the same\r\nammunition as the S.-M.-L.-E.  rifle, and two Lewis-gun sections are\r\nincluded in each infantry platoon.  The rate of fire is increased by\r\nthe automatic action of the gun, the maximum rate permitting a drum of\r\n47 rounds to be fired in less than ten seconds, while one or two rounds\r\nonly may be fired if so required.  The mobility of the Lewis-gun\r\nsections is the same as that of other sections of the infantry platoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nRANGES OF RIFLES AND MACHINE GUNS\r\n\r\n  _Close_ range.  Up to 800 yards.\r\n  _Effective_ range.  Over 800 yards up to 2,000 yards.\r\n  _Long_ range.  Over 2,000 yards up to 2,900 yards.\r\n\r\nGRENADES.--Hand grenades and rifle grenades are adjuncts to the rifle\r\nand bayonet and the Lewis gun.  Their principal use is in clearing\r\nfortified posts, especially in Position Warfare.  The _hand grenade_,\r\nor bomb thrown by hand, is limited in range by the skill and strength\r\nof the thrower, and 30 to 40 yards may be regarded as the maximum\r\ndistance.  The _rifle grenade_ is effective up to about 400 yards, and\r\nis generally employed to provide a local barrage or to search cover.\r\nIn the latter case, a high angle of descent is used as with mortars or\r\nhowitzers.\r\n\r\nLIGHT MORTARS.--The _Light Mortar Section_ is an integral part of every\r\ninfantry battalion, and although sometimes brigaded for special\r\npurposes the sections normally work with their own battalions.  A\r\nsection of 2 light mortars, firing 11-lb. bombs, consists of 1 officer\r\nand 20 other ranks, and requires 2 horses and 1 G.S. limbered wagon.\r\nOwing to the high angle of descent the bombs can be fired behind, and\r\ncan search, high cover, while the mortars themselves are not very\r\nconspicuous objects and can be {167} readily moved for short distances,\r\nwhile they \"come into action\" in 30 seconds.  The comparatively slow\r\nflight of the bombs, however, enables the enemy to discover the\r\nlocation of the mortars, and necessitates the use of expedients to\r\navoid counter-artillery fire.  A maximum rate of 30 to 40 rounds a\r\nminute can be maintained for two or three minutes, if ammunition is\r\navailable, and at an angle of 45 degrees a range of 700 yards can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nMACHINE GUNS.--\"The principal characteristic of the machine gun is its\r\npower of delivering a concentrated volume of fire which can be\r\nsustained almost indefinitely, subject to limitations of ammunition\r\nsupply.  The ease with which the gun can be concealed in action and its\r\nfire controlled enable advantage to be taken of surprise effect\"\r\n(\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1921)).  The _Machine-gun\r\nPlatoon_ is an integral part of every infantry battalion, but in Attack\r\nmachine guns are frequently grouped for the purpose of providing\r\noverhead or other covering fire, while in Defence they form, with the\r\nartillery, the framework into which the defensive dispositions are\r\nfitted, and by reason of their fire-power machine guns enable a\r\ncommander to economise in the number of infantry allotted to a purely\r\ndefensive _rôle_.  The ranges are those given above for rifles and\r\nLewis guns, and the rate of fire is about 20 times that of a rifle,\r\nwhile 1,500 to 2,000 rounds may be fired continuously at a moment of\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTED TROOPS\r\n\r\nCAVALRY.--The principal characteristic of cavalry is its mobility.\r\nThis enables it to attack unexpectedly; to defend with determination\r\nwhile retaining the power to break off an action more easily than\r\ninfantry; to gain information and to afford protection at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the force protected; and to confirm {168}\r\nand exploit the success obtained in battle.  \"Cavalry is capable, if\r\nrequired, of undertaking most operations for which infantry would\r\nusually be employed, but the demands made by the care of horses reduce\r\nthe number of rifles which can actually be placed in action; and it\r\ntherefore lacks depth in comparison with similar infantry formations\"\r\n(\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1921)).  The cavalry arms are\r\nthe lance and sword for mounted action; horse artillery usually work\r\nwith cavalry, and the arms employed by cavalry for dismounted action\r\nare the rifle, the machine gun, and the Hotchkiss rifle.  Examples of\r\nthe employment of cavalry in modern warfare are given throughout the\r\n\"Lectures.\"\r\n\r\nMOUNTED RIFLES.--The characteristics and methods of employment of\r\nmounted rifles are similar to those of cavalry, with the exception that\r\nthey are not equipped for mounted action.  Mounted rifles, like\r\ncavalry, enable a commander to extend his attack or defence in a manner\r\nthat is most bewildering to infantry, and attempts by infantry to\r\noutflank a defending force of mounted rifles are generally frustrated\r\nby the mobility of the defending force, as was exemplified in the South\r\nAfrican War of 1899-1902.\r\n\r\nCYCLISTS.--Under favourable  conditions cyclists possess greater\r\nmobility than cavalry, and they can develop greater fire-power, as no\r\nhorse-holders are required.  They are, however, dependent upon roads,\r\nthey are vulnerable on the move, they cannot fight without dismounting,\r\nand they must return to their bicycles after action; whereas cavalry\r\nhorse-holders can meet dismounted troopers at a prearranged spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTILLERY\r\n\r\n\"The _rôle_ of artillery is to assist the other arms in breaking down\r\nopposition, and to afford all possible {169} support to the infantry,\r\nwith whom the eventual decision rests\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\"\r\nvol. ii. (1921)).\r\n\r\nAll classes of artillery are included in modern military operations.\r\nMotor traction enables the heaviest guns to be brought to the\r\nbattlefield and to be removed when a commander decides to withdraw from\r\nbattle, while the increase in the defensive power of obstacles and\r\nsmall arms fire, combined with the increase in mobility afforded by\r\nmotor traction, enables all but super-heavy artillery (which require a\r\nrailway mounting) to be placed close behind the infantry in Attack and\r\nDefence.  It is, however, obvious that the closest support can be given\r\nby the guns that are weakest in shell-power, on account of the\r\nsuperiority in mobility possessed by the lighter guns.\r\n\r\nIn Modern Warfare a great proportion of the work of artillery is\r\ncarried out, of necessity, in the hours of darkness, owing to the\r\nfrequency of movement by night to avoid aërial observation, and to the\r\nconsequent use of indirect artillery fire to inflict losses during such\r\nmovements.  The artillery personnel therefore requires to be relieved\r\nwith greater frequency than in the days before the use of aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe growth of artillery during the war was symbolical of the continual\r\nchanges in the methods of warfare, its numbers and power increasing out\r\nof all proportion to the experience of previous wars.  \"The 486 pieces\r\nof light and medium artillery with which we took the field in August,\r\n1914, were represented at the date of the Armistice by 6,437 guns and\r\nhowitzers of all natures, including pieces of the heaviest calibre\"\r\n(Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).  \"From the commencement of our offensive in\r\nAugust, 1918, to the conclusion of the Armistice some 700,000 tons of\r\nartillery ammunition were expended by the British Armies on the Western\r\nFront.  For the fortnight from August 21 to September 3, our daily\r\naverage expenditure exceeded {170} 11,000 tons, while for the three\r\ndays of the crucial battle on September 27, 28, and 29 (_Second Battle\r\nof Cambrai_) nearly 65,000 tons of ammunition were fired by our\r\nartillery\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\nIn the Table of Artillery Ranges on p. 173, the effective ranges of\r\nlight artillery firing H.E. shell are based on the use of No. 106 fuse.\r\n\"The invention of a new fuse known as '106,' which was first used at\r\nthe _Battle of Arras_ (April 9-June 7, 1917), enabled wire\r\nentanglements to be easily and quickly destroyed, and so modified our\r\nmethods of attacking organised positions.  By bursting the shell the\r\ninstant it touched the ground, and before it had become buried, the\r\ndestructive effect of the explosion was greatly increased.  It became\r\npossible to cut wire with a far less expenditure of time and\r\nammunition, and the factor of surprise was given a larger part in\r\noperations\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\nArtillery is classed under the designations Light, Medium, Heavy, and\r\nSuper-Heavy.\r\n\r\nLIGHT GUNS.--_Pack Guns_, with a calibre of 2.75 inches, are weakest in\r\nshell-power, but they possess a mobility greater than any other\r\nartillery and can be moved in country which would present insuperable\r\nobstacles to wheeled traffic.  _Pack Howitzers_, with a calibre of 3.7\r\ninches, are particularly valuable in close country, the high angle of\r\ndescent enabling the attack or defence to search the steepest cover.\r\n_Horse Artillery Guns_, firing a 13-pound shell, are the most mobile of\r\nall wheeled artillery and are normally employed with mounted troops.\r\nAll ranks of the Royal Horse Artillery are mounted, and its mobility is\r\nscarcely less than that of cavalry.  _Field Guns_, with a calibre of 3\r\ninches, firing an 18-pound shell, are the principal artillery weapon of\r\na field army.  Although inferior in mobility to Pack or Horse\r\nArtillery, they have greater shell-power and afford the principal\r\nsupport to infantry in closing with or repelling the enemy.  Their\r\npower to inflict casualties {171} by enfilade fire with shrapnel makes\r\nthem specially suitable in the defence, and the accuracy of modern\r\nweapons enables them to co-operate in the Attack with covering fire,\r\nunder the protection of which infantry may advance unimpeded to the\r\nassault.  In addition to their normal functions, and to their\r\nemployment in counter-battery work, they can be employed in the\r\nreduction of defences by bombardment with High Explosive shells, in\r\nneutralising an area by the use of gas shells, or in providing\r\nartificial cover by the production of _Smoke_.  _Field Howitzers_, with\r\na calibre of 4.5 inches, have increased offensive power and practically\r\nthe same mobility as field guns.\r\n\r\nLight guns are the principal weapons for protection against _Aircraft_\r\nand for defence against _Tanks_.  The Tank is powerless against\r\nartillery, and its most effective enemy is light artillery.  During the\r\n_First Battle of the Somme_ a new terror was added to the British\r\nattack by the introduction of the Tank, which surmounted inequalities\r\nin the ground, crushed the wire defences, and crossed the trenches.\r\nAlthough accompanied by infantry, it was regarded as an all-conquering\r\nand decisive factor.  At one period of the battle, however, a number of\r\nTanks were placed out of action by a single field gun, manned and fired\r\nwith the greatest gallantry by a single German artillery officer, who\r\nfired point-blank at each Tank as it surmounted the crest of a rise.\r\nInfantry were in close support, and a single Lewis-gun section could\r\nhave prevented the use of the field gun.\r\n\r\nMEDIUM GUNS.--Medium guns, firing a 60-pound shell, are principally\r\nemployed in counter-battery work and in fulfilling the functions of\r\n18-pound field guns at a greater range and with greater force.  _Medium\r\nHowitzers_ occupy the same relative position, their offensive power\r\nbeing greater than that of the Field Howitzer.\r\n\r\n{172}\r\n\r\nHEAVY GUNS.--Heavy guns of 6-inch calibre, firing a shell of 100\r\npounds, are used against targets beyond the range of light and medium\r\nguns, and with greater effect.  _Heavy Howitzers_, of 8-inch or\r\n9.2-inch calibre, are principally employed against covered batteries\r\nand strong defences, or for destroying wire entanglements with\r\ninstantaneous fuses.\r\n\r\nSUPER-HEAVY GUNS.--Super-heavy guns of a calibre of 9.2 inches and\r\nupwards are usually carried on railway mountings, and while they\r\npossess a high muzzle velocity, considerable shell-power, and a high\r\ndegree of mobility (which enables them to come into action in any part\r\nof the battlefield where suitable rails have been laid), their arc of\r\nfire is very restricted and their \"life\" is short.  _Super-Heavy\r\nHowitzers_, of 12-inch or 18-inch calibre, possess similar advantages\r\nand disadvantages to super-heavy guns.  Their normal use is the\r\ndestruction of permanent defences, the breaking down of bridges, etc.\r\nThe 12-inch weapon is also used on tractor-drawn mountings and is\r\nhighly effective in counter-battery work.\r\n\r\nThe table on p. 173 is based upon particulars given on p. 26 of \"Field\r\nService Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1921).\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL ENGINEERS\r\n\r\n\"All arms are responsible for the construction of their own works of\r\ndefence.  It is the duty of the Royal Engineers to assist them by\r\nengineer reconnaissances, plans, advice, technical supervision,\r\nprovision of materials and the construction of works requiring special\r\ntechnical skill. . . .  Although trained as fighting troops, engineers\r\nshould be regarded as reserves to be used only as a last resource;\r\ncasualties in their ranks are not easy to replace, and they may become\r\nneedlessly involved in the fighting and lost for work which may have an\r\nimportant bearing on the operations\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol.\r\nii.

G. Grant, the Chief Engineer to the V. Army.  On March 26 these were\r\nposted by General Grant, in accordance with orders given by the V. Army\r\ncommander, on the line of the old Amiens defences between Mezières,\r\nMarcelcave, and Hamel.  Subsequently, as General Grant could ill be\r\nspared from his proper duties, he was directed to hand over command of\r\nhis force to Major-Gen. G. G. S. Carey.  Except for General Carey's\r\nforce there were no reinforcements of any kind behind the divisions,\r\nwhich had been fighting for the most part since the opening of the\r\nbattle. . . .  On March 28 our line from Marcelcave to the Somme was\r\nmanned by Carey's Force, with the 1st Cavalry Division in close\r\nsupport. . . .  On March 29 the greater part of the British front south\r\nof the Somme was held by Carey's Force, assisted by the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision and such troops of the divisions originally engaged as it had\r\nnot yet been found possible to withdraw.  In rear of these troops, a\r\nfew of the divisions of the V. Army were given a brief opportunity to\r\nreassemble\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\n\r\nTANKS\r\n\r\nTanks are moving fortresses containing light artillery, machine guns,\r\nand rifles, and while capable of inflicting heavy losses by fire they\r\ncan also destroy obstacles, weapons, and personnel.  Their garrisons\r\nare protected against the fire of small arms and from shrapnel bullets,\r\nbut they are very vulnerable to other forms of artillery fire.  Their\r\nmobility and radius of action are governed by the amount of petrol\r\ncarried and by the physical endurance of the crew, but except over deep\r\ncuttings, {175} broad streams, swamps, very heavily shelled ground,\r\nrocky and mountainous country, or in thick woods they can move without\r\ndifficulty.  \"The power of delivering successful surprise attacks\r\nagainst almost any type of defences is one of the most important\r\nadvantages of the use of Tanks in large numbers\" (\"Field Service\r\nRegulations,\" vol. ii. (1921)).\r\n\r\nDuring the _First Battle of the Somme_ (September 1-November 18, 1916)\r\n\"Our new heavily armoured cars, known as 'Tanks,' now brought into\r\naction for the first time, successfully co-operated with the infantry,\r\nand coming as a surprise to the enemy rank and file, gave valuable help\r\nin breaking down their resistance. . . .  These cars proved of great\r\nvalue on various occasions, and the personnel in charge of them\r\nperformed many deeds of remarkable valour\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\n\r\nAIRCRAFT\r\n\r\nTwo classes of Aircraft are used in the field.  Aeroplanes, which are\r\nself-propelled and have an almost unlimited radius of action; and Kite\r\nBalloons, which, in favourable weather, can be towed by a lorry and can\r\nbe moved frequently without loss of efficiency.\r\n\r\nAEROPLANES are of the greatest value for reconnaissance and\r\ninter-communication, and not only obtain, and return to their base\r\nwith, information of the highest value, but facilitate personal\r\nreconnaissance of the battlefield by commanders and staff officers.\r\nTheir offensive and defensive action is also very great and the moral\r\neffect of their offensive action is of the highest value.  Although\r\naeroplane squadrons are mobile units they lose efficiency if the units\r\nare moved too frequently.  The action of aircraft in various phases of\r\nfighting is dealt with throughout the Lectures.\r\n\r\nKITE BALLOONS carry two observers, who can remain in telephonic\r\ncommunication with the ground up to a {176} height of 5,000 feet.\r\nInflated balloons can be moved in favourable weather at a maximum speed\r\nof 8 miles an hour while at a height of about 500 feet.  Their extreme\r\nvulnerability to artillery fire prevents their use close to the battle\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS\r\n\r\n\"The advisability of employing gas as a military weapon is a matter for\r\nconsideration by the authorities concerned before a campaign begins.\r\nOnce authorised, however, and assuming that weather conditions are\r\nfavourable, gas may be expected to play a part in every action. . . .\r\nThe different methods in which gas can be employed make it a weapon\r\nwhich can be used by all arms, thus _Artillery_ deal with gas shells,\r\n_Infantry_ with light mortar gas bombs, _Aircraft_ with aërial gas\r\nbombs, and _Engineers_ with all methods of use that call for special\r\nmanipulation\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1921)).\r\n\r\nGas was introduced by the Germans during the _Second Battle of Ypres_\r\n(April 22-May 18, 1915), and the numerous experiments and trials\r\nnecessary before gas can be used, and the great preparations which have\r\nto be made for its manufacture, show that its employment was not the\r\nresult of a desperate decision, but had been prepared for deliberately.\r\nDuring the _First Battle of the Somme_ (September 1-November 18, 1916)\r\n\"the employment by the enemy of gas and liquid flame as weapons of\r\noffence compelled us not only to discover ways to protect our troops\r\nfrom their effects, but also to devise means to make use of the same\r\ninstruments of destruction. . . .  Since we have been compelled, in\r\nself-defence, to use similar methods, it is satisfactory to be able to\r\nrecord, on the evidence of prisoners, of documents captured, and of our\r\nown observation, that the enemy has suffered heavy casualties from our\r\ngas attacks, while the means of protection adopted by us {177} have\r\nproved thoroughly effective\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE\r\n\r\nSmoke can be discharged from _Artillery_ shells, Artillery or\r\n_infantry_ mortar bombs, Infantry rifle grenades, smoke candles,\r\n_Aircraft_ bombs, _Engineers'_ stationary generators, or the exhaust\r\npipe of _Tanks_.  It is used to conceal movement for the purposes of\r\nsurprise or for reducing casualties, and can be so employed as to\r\nimpose night conditions on the enemy while one's own troops retain the\r\nnatural visibility; but while the weight and direction of an intended\r\nblow may thus be hidden from the enemy a warning is given of the time\r\nof its delivery.  It is possible, however, to mystify, as well as to\r\nsurprise, the enemy by the use of smoke, and its strategical and\r\ntactical value will ensure its adoption in Modern Warfare.  In the\r\nclosing battles of the Great War \"the use of smoke shells for covering\r\nthe advance of our infantry and masking the enemy's positions was\r\nintroduced and employed with increasing frequency and effect\" (Sir D.\r\nHaig's Dispatches).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{178}\r\n\r\nOPERATION ORDERS\r\n\r\nCombatant officers of every rank are required to issue orders of some\r\nkind or other, and orders for operations should always be committed to\r\npaper when circumstances permit.  The object of an operation order is\r\nto bring about a course of action in accordance with the intentions of\r\nthe commander, and with full co-operation between all units.\r\n\r\nOperation orders of a complicated nature are unlikely to be required\r\nfrom the pen of infantry officers in the junior ranks, and the rules\r\nfor drafting orders are stated in detail in the official text-books,\r\nfor the use of officers of the ranks that will be required to issue\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe general principles underlying orders of all kinds are that they\r\nshould be \"fool proof,\" and it has been remarked that the writer of\r\norders should always remember that at least one silly ass will try to\r\nmisunderstand them.  They must, therefore, be void of all ambiguity,\r\nand while containing every essential piece of information, and omitting\r\neverything that is clearly known already to the recipients, they should\r\nbe confined to facts, and conjecture should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"An operation order must contain just what the recipient requires to\r\nknow and nothing more.  It should tell him nothing which he can and\r\nshould arrange for himself, and, especially in the case of large\r\nforces, will only enter into details when details are absolutely\r\nnecessary.  Any attempt to prescribe to a subordinate at a distance\r\nanything which he, with a fuller knowledge of local conditions, should\r\nbe better able to decide on the spot, is likely to cramp his initiative\r\nin dealing with unforeseen developments, and will be avoided.  In {179}\r\nparticular, such expressions as 'Will await further orders' should be\r\navoided\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1921)).\r\n\r\nApart from the standing rules as to the printing of names of places in\r\nblock type, including a reference to the map used, dating and signing\r\nthe orders, numbering the copies, and stating the time and method of\r\nissue, etc., the general tenour of all operation orders will always be:\r\n_The enemy are. . . .  My intention is. . . .
