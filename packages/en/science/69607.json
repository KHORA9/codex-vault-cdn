The knowledge is not\r\nobtainable elsewhere; there is a conspiracy of silence on the essential\r\nmatters concerning sex conduct, and the object of the author has been\r\nto break the barriers of convention in this respect, recognizing as he\r\ndoes that no marriage can be a truly happy one unless both partners are\r\nfree to express the deepest feelings they have for each other without\r\ndegrading themselves or bringing into the world undesired children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe author is an idealist who recognizes the sacredness of the sex\r\nfunction and the right of children to be loved and desired before they\r\nare born. Very, very few of us can say truly that we were the outcome of\r\nthe conscious desire of our parents to beget us. They, however, were not\r\nto blame because they had not the knowledge which would have enabled them\r\nto control conception.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, see that our own marriage conduct brings us happiness and\r\nenjoyment in itself and for our children.\r\n\r\nA Book for Idealists by an Idealist\r\n\r\nThe greatest necessity to insure happiness in the married condition is to\r\nknow its obligations and privileges, and to have a sound understanding\r\nof sex conduct. This great book gives this information and is absolutely\r\nreliable throughout.\r\n\r\nDr. P. L. Clark, B. S., M. D., writing of this book says: “As regards\r\nsound principles and frank discussion I know no better book on this\r\nsubject than Bernard Bernard’s ‘Sex Conduct in Marriage.’ I strongly\r\nadvise all members of the Health School in need of reliable information\r\nto read this book.”\r\n\r\n“I feel grateful but cheated,” writes one man. “Grateful for the new\r\nunderstanding and joy in living that has come to us, cheated that we have\r\nlived five years without it.”\r\n\r\nSEX CONDUCT IN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nBy BERNARD BERNARD Editor-in-Chief of “Health and Life”\r\n\r\nAnswers simply and directly, those intimate questions which Mr. Bernard\r\nhas been called upon to answer innumerable times before, both personally\r\nand by correspondence. It is a simple, straightforward explanation,\r\nunclouded by ancient fetish or superstition.\r\n\r\nA few of the many headings are:—\r\n\r\n    When the Sex Function Should Be Used.\r\n    Sex Tragedies in Childhood.\r\n    The Consummation of Marriage.\r\n    The Art of a Beautiful Conception.\r\n    Sex Communion.\r\n    The Scientific Control of Conception.\r\n    Sex Fear Destroyed.\r\n    The Frequency of the Sex Act.\r\n    The Initiation to Matrimony.\r\n    Anatomy and Physiology of the Sex Organs.\r\n    The Spontaneous Expression of Love.\r\n    Why Women Have Been Subjected.\r\n    Men Who Marry in Ignorance.\r\n    Hereditary Passion.\r\n    Marriage a Joy to the End.\r\n\r\nSend your check or money order today for only $1.75 and this remarkable\r\nbook will be sent postpaid immediately in a plain wrapper.\r\n\r\n                       Health and Life Publications\r\n                    Room 46-333 South Dearborn Street\r\n                                 CHICAGO\r\n\r\n                      HEALTH AND LIFE PUBLICATIONS\r\n                      Room 46-333 S.

G. BIRCH\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DRUMS OF DOOM.\r\n\r\nThe first warning of the stupendous cataclysm that befell the earth in\r\nthe third decade of the twentieth century was recorded simultaneously in\r\nseveral parts of America during a night in early June. But, so little was\r\nits awful significance suspected at the time, it passed almost without\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI am certain that I entertained no forebodings; neither did the man\r\nwho was destined to play the leading role in the mighty drama that\r\nfollowed—Dr. Ferdinand Gresham, the eminent American astronomer. For we\r\nwere on a hunting and fishing trip in Labrador at the time, and were not\r\neven aware of the strange occurrence.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the nature of this first herald of disaster was not such as to\r\ncause alarm.\r\n\r\nAt 12 minutes past 3 o’clock a. m., when there began a lull in the\r\nnight’s aerial telegraph business, several of the larger wireless\r\nstations of the Western hemisphere simultaneously began picking up\r\nstrange signals out of the ether. They were faint and ghostly, as if\r\ncoming from a vast distance—equally far removed from New York and San\r\nFrancisco, Juneau and Panama.\r\n\r\nExactly two minutes apart the calls were repeated, with clock-like\r\nregularity. But the code used—if it _were_ a code—was undecipherable.\r\n\r\nUntil near dawn the signals continued—indistinct, unintelligible,\r\ninsistent.\r\n\r\nEvery station capable of transmitting messages over such great distances\r\nemphatically denied sending them. And no amateur apparatus was powerful\r\nenough to be the cause. As far as anyone could learn, the signals\r\noriginated nowhere upon the earth. It was as if some phantom were\r\nwhispering through the ether in the language of another planet.\r\n\r\nTwo nights later the calls were heard again, starting at almost the same\r\ninstant when they had been distinguished on the first occasion. But this\r\ntime they were precisely three minutes apart. And without the variation\r\nof a second they continued for more than an hour.\r\n\r\nThe next night they reappeared. And the next and the next. Now they began\r\nearlier than before—in fact, no one knew when they had started, for they\r\nwere sounding when the night’s business died down sufficiently for them\r\nto be heard. But each night, it was noticed, the interval between the\r\nsignals was exactly one minute longer than the night before.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the weird whispers ceased for a night or two, but always\r\nthey resumed with the same insistence, although with a newly-timed\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\nThis continued until early in July, when the pause between the calls had\r\nattained more than thirty minutes’ duration.\r\n\r\nThen the length of the lulls began to decrease erratically. One night the\r\nmysterious summons would be heard every nineteen and a quarter minutes;\r\nthe next night, every ten and a half minutes; at other times, twelve and\r\nthree-quarters minutes, or fourteen and a fifth, or fifteen and a third.\r\n\r\nStill the signals could not be deciphered, and their message—if they\r\ncontained one—remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nNewspapers and scientific journals at last began to speculate upon the\r\nmatter, advancing all manner of theories to account for the disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe only one of these conjectures attracting widespread attention,\r\nhowever, was that presented by Professor Howard Whiteman, the famous\r\ndirector of the United States naval observatory at Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whiteman voiced the opinion that the planet Mars was trying\r\nto establish communication with the earth—the mysterious calls being\r\nwireless signals sent across space by the inhabitants of our neighboring\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOur globe, moving through space much faster than Mars, and in a smaller\r\norbit, overtakes its neighboring planet once in a little over two years.\r\nFor some months Mars had been approaching the earth. At the beginning of\r\nJune it had been approximately 40,000,000 miles away, and at that time,\r\nProfessor Whiteman pointed out, the strange wireless calls had commenced.\r\nAs the two worlds drew closer together the signals increased slightly in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe scientist urged that while Mars remained close to us the government\r\nshould appropriate funds to enlarge one of the principal wireless\r\nstations in an effort to answer the overtures of our neighbors in space.\r\n\r\nBut when, after two more days, the ethereal signals ceased abruptly\r\nand week passed without their recurrence, Professor Whiteman’s theory\r\nbegan to be derided, and the whole thing was dismissed as some temporary\r\nphenomenon of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt was something of a shock, therefore, when, on the eighth night after\r\nthe cessation of the disturbances, the calls were suddenly resumed—much\r\nlouder than before, as if the power creating their electrical impulses\r\nhad been increased. Now wireless stations all over the world plainly\r\nheard the staccato, mystifying challenge coming out of the ether.\r\n\r\nThis time, too, the interval between the signals was of a new\r\nlength—eleven minutes and six seconds.\r\n\r\nThe next day the matter took on still further importance.\r\n\r\nScientists all along the Pacific Coast of the United States reported\r\nthat in the night their seismographs had recorded a series of light\r\nearthquakes; and it was noted that these tremors had occurred precisely\r\neleven minutes and six seconds apart—simultaneously with the sounding of\r\nthe mysterious wireless calls!\r\n\r\nAfter that the aerial signals did not stop during any part of the\r\ntwenty-four hours. And the earth shocks continued, gradually increasing\r\nin severity. They kept perfect time with the signals through the ether—a\r\nshock for every whisper, a rest for every pause. In the course of a\r\ncouple of weeks the quakes attained such force that in many places they\r\ncould be distinctly felt by anyone standing still upon solid ground.\r\n\r\nScience now became fully aware of the existence of some new and\r\nsinister—or at least unfathomed—force in the world, and began to give the\r\nmatter profound study.\r\n\r\nHowever, both Dr. Ferdinand Gresham and myself remained in complete\r\nignorance of these events; for, as I have said, we were in the interior\r\nof Labrador. We both possessed a keen love of the wilderness, where, in\r\nvigorous sports, we renewed our energy for the work to be done in the\r\ncities—the doctor’s as director of the great astronomical observatory at\r\nthe National University; mine in the prosaic channels of business.\r\n\r\nTo the public, which knew him only through his books and lectures, Dr.\r\nGresham perhaps appeared the last person in the world anyone would\r\nseek for a companion: a man silent, preoccupied, austere, unsociable.\r\nBut underneath this aloofness and taciturnity was a character of rare\r\nstrength, good nature and loveableness. And, once beyond the barriers\r\nof civilization, his austerity vanished, and he became a prince of good\r\nfellows, actually reveling in hardships and danger.\r\n\r\nThe complete change in him on such occasions brought to mind a strange\r\nphase of his life about which not even I, his most intimate associate,\r\nknew anything—a period in which he had undertaken a mysterious pilgrimage\r\nalone into the dark interior of China.\r\n\r\nI only knew that fifteen years before he had gone in quest of certain\r\namazing astronomical discoveries rumored to have been made by Buddhist\r\nsavants dwelling in monasteries far back in the Himalayas or the\r\nTian-Shan, or some of those inaccessible mountain fastnesses of Central\r\nAsia. After more than four years he had dragged back, ill and suffering,\r\nbearing hideous disfigurations upon his body, the look in his eyes of a\r\nman who had seen hell, and maintaining inviolate silence regarding his\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nOn regaining his health after the Chinese adventure, he had immersed\r\nhimself in silence and work, and year by year since then I had seen\r\nhim steadily rise in prominence in his profession. Indeed, his name\r\nhad come to stand for vastly more in the scientific world than merely\r\nthe advancement of astronomical knowledge. He was a deep student along\r\nmany lines of scientific endeavor—electricity, chemistry, mathematics,\r\nphysics, geology, even biology. To the development of wireless telegraphy\r\nand the wireless transmission of electrical energy he had devoted\r\nparticular effort.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and I had left New York a few days before the wireless\r\ndisturbances began. Returning by a small private vessel, which was not\r\nequipped with wireless, we continued in ignorance of the world’s danger.\r\n\r\nIt was during our homeward sea voyage that the earthquakes began to grow\r\nserious. Many buildings were damaged. In the western portions of the\r\nUnited States and Canada a number of persons were killed by the collapse\r\nof houses.\r\n\r\nGradually the affected area expanded. New York and Nagasaki, Buenos\r\nAires and Berlin, Vienna and Valparaiso began to take their places on\r\nthe casualty list. Even modern skyscrapers suffered broken windows and\r\nfalling plaster; sometimes they shook so violently that their occupants\r\nfled to the streets in a panic. Water and gas mains began to break.\r\n\r\nBefore long, in New York, one of the railroad tunnels under the Hudson\r\nRiver cracked and flooded, causing no loss of life, but spreading such\r\nalarm that all the tubes under and out of Manhattan were abandoned. This\r\nbrought about a fearful congestion of traffic in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nFinally, toward the beginning of August, the earthquakes became so\r\nserious that the newspapers were filled every day with accounts of the\r\nloss of scores—sometimes hundreds—of lives all over the world.\r\n\r\nThen came a happening fraught with a monstrous new terror, which was\r\nrevealed to the public one morning just as day dawned in New York.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding night, a great Atlantic liner, steaming westward\r\napproximately along the fiftieth parallel of latitude, had _run aground_\r\nabout 700 miles east of Cape Race, Newfoundland—at a point where all\r\nnautical charts showed the ocean to be _nearly two miles deep_!\r\n\r\nWithin an hour there had come reports of a similar nature from other\r\nships two or three hundred miles distant from the first one. There was\r\nno telling how vast in extent might be the upheaved portion of the sea\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nHardly had the wireless stations finished taking these startling stories\r\nfrom midocean before there began to arrive equally strange reports from\r\nother quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\nSomeone discovered that the sea level had risen almost six feet at New\r\nYork. The Sahara Desert had sunk to an unknown depth, and the sea was\r\nrushing in, ripping vast channels through the heart of Morocco, Tripoli\r\nand Egypt, obliterating cities and completely changing the whole face of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours the high water in New York harbor receded about a\r\nfoot. Mount Chimborazo, the majestic peak of more than 20,000 feet\r\naltitude in the Ecuadorean Andes, began to fall down and spread out over\r\nthe surrounding country. Then the mountains bordering the Panama Canal\r\nstarted to collapse for many miles, completely blocking that famous\r\nwaterway.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the Danube River ceased to flow in its accustomed direction\r\nand began, near its junction with the Save, to pour its waters back past\r\nBudapest and Vienna, turning the plains of western Austria into a series\r\nof spreading lakes.\r\n\r\nThe world awoke that summer morning to face a more desperate situation\r\nthan ever had confronted mankind during all the centuries of recorded\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAnd still no plausible explanation of the trouble—except the Martian\r\ntheory of Professor Howard Whiteman—was forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMen were dazed, astounded. A feeling of dread and terror began to settle\r\nupon the public.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, realizing the need of some sort of action, the\r\nPresident of the United States urged all the other civilized nations\r\nto send representatives to an international scientific congress in\r\nWashington, which should endeavor to determine the origin of the\r\nterrestrial disturbances and, if possible, suggest relief.\r\n\r\nAs speedily as airplanes could bring them, an imposing assemblage of the\r\nworld’s leading scientists gathered in Washington.\r\n\r\nBecause of his international reputation and the fact that the congress\r\nheld its sessions at the United States naval observatory of which he was\r\nchief, Professor Whiteman was chosen president of the body.\r\n\r\nFor a week the scientists debated—while the world waited in intense and\r\ngrowing anxiety. But the learned men accomplished nothing. They could\r\nnot even agree. The battle seemed one of man against nature, and man was\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\nIn a gloomy state of mind they began to consider adjournment. At 10\r\no’clock on the night of the nineteenth of August the question of\r\nterminating the sessions was scheduled for a final vote.\r\n\r\nThat night, as the hands of the clock on the wall above the presiding\r\nofficer’s head drew near the fateful hour, the tension throughout the\r\nassemblage became intensely dramatic. Everyone present knew in his heart\r\nthat further deliberation was useless, but the fate of the human race\r\nseemed to hang upon their decision.\r\n\r\nEven after the sound of the clock’s striking had died out upon the\r\nstillness of the room, Professor Whiteman remained seated; he seemed\r\nhaggard and downcast. At last, however, he drew himself up and opened his\r\nlips to speak.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a secretary tiptoed swiftly in and whispered briefly to\r\nthe presiding officer. Professor Whiteman gave a start and answered\r\nsomething that sent the secretary hurrying out.\r\n\r\nBetraying strange emotion, the scientist now addressed the assemblage.\r\nHis words came haltingly, as if he feared they would be greeted with\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “a strange thing has happened. A few minutes\r\nago—the wireless signals that have always accompanied the earthquakes\r\nceased abruptly. In their place came—a mysterious summons out of\r\nthe ether—whence no one knows—demanding a conversation with the\r\npresiding officer of this body. The sender of the message declares his\r\ncommunication has to do with the problem we have been trying to solve.\r\nOf course—this is probably some hoax—but our operator is greatly excited\r\nover the circumstances surrounding the call, and urges that we come to\r\nthe wireless room at once!”\r\n\r\nWith one accord, everyone rose and moved forward.\r\n\r\nLeading the way to another part of the observatory grounds, Professor\r\nWhiteman ushered the company into the operating room of the wireless\r\nplant—one of the most powerful in the world.\r\n\r\nA little knot of observatory officials already was clustered about the\r\noperator, their manner denoting that something unusual had been going on.\r\n\r\nAt a word from Professor Whiteman, the operator threw over his rheostat\r\nand the hum of the rotary spark filled the room. Then his fingers played\r\non the key while he sent out a few signals.\r\n\r\n“I’m letting them—_him_—know you’re ready, sir,” the operator explained\r\nto the astronomer, in a tone filled with awe.\r\n\r\nA few moments slipped by. Everyone waited breathlessly, all eyes glued\r\nupon the apparatus, as if to read the momentous message that was expected\r\nto come from—no one knew where.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was an involuntary movement of the muscles of the\r\noperator’s face, as if he were straining to hear something very faint and\r\nfar away; then he began writing slowly upon a pad that lay on his desk.\r\nAt his elbow the scientists unceremoniously crowded each other in their\r\neagerness to read:\r\n\r\n    “To the Presiding Officer of the International Scientific\r\n    Congress, Washington,” he wrote. “I am the dictator of human\r\n    destiny. Through control of the earth’s internal forces I am\r\n    master of every existing thing. I can blot out all life—destroy\r\n    the globe itself. It is my intention to abolish all present\r\n    governments and make myself emperor of the earth. As proof of\r\n    my power to do this, I”—there was a pause of several seconds,\r\n    which seemed like hours in the awful stillness—“I shall, at\r\n    midnight tomorrow, Thursday (Washington time), cause the\r\n    earthquakes to cease until further notice.\r\n\r\n                                                              “KWO.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER II._\r\n\r\nTHE DICTATOR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nBy the next morning the entire civilized world knew of the strange\r\nand threatening communication from the self-styled “dictator of human\r\ndestiny.”\r\n\r\nThe members of the scientific congress had sought to keep the matter\r\nsecret, but all the larger wireless stations of North America had picked\r\nup the message, and thence it found its way into the newspapers.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, such a communication would have attracted nothing more\r\nthan laughter, as a harmless prank; but the increasing menace of the\r\nearthquakes had wrought a state of nervous tension that was ready to\r\nclothe the whole affair with sinister significance.\r\n\r\nIt was an alarmed and hysterical public that gathered in the streets\r\nof all the great cities soon after daylight. One question was on every\r\ntongue:\r\n\r\nWho was this mysterious “KWO,” and was his message actually a momentous\r\ndeclaration to the human race, or merely a hoax perpetrated by some\r\nperson with an overly vivid imagination?\r\n\r\nEven the signature to the communication was such as to arouse curiosity.\r\nWas it a name? Or a combination of initials? Or a title, like “Rex,”\r\nsignifying king? Or a nom de plume? Or the name of a place?\r\n\r\nNo one could say.\r\n\r\nAnyone capable of discovering the secrets of the earth’s internal forces,\r\nand harnessing those forces for his own ends, unquestionably was the most\r\nwonderful scientist the world had ever seen; but, though every important\r\nnation of the globe was represented at the scientific congress in\r\nWashington, not one of those representatives had ever heard of successful\r\nexperiments along this line, or knew any prominent scientist named KWO,\r\nor one possessing initials that would make up that word. The name sounded\r\nOriental, but certainly no country of the Orient had produced a scientist\r\nof sufficient genius to accomplish this miracle.\r\n\r\nIt was a problem concerning which the best-informed persons knew no more\r\nthan the most untutored child, but one which was of paramount importance\r\nto the group of savants assembled in Washington. Until more light could\r\nbe shed on this subject they were powerless to form any conclusions.\r\nAccordingly, their first effort was to get into further communication\r\nwith their unknown correspondent.\r\n\r\nAll through the night the operator at the naval observatory’s wireless\r\nplant in Washington sat at his key, calling over and over again the three\r\nletters that constituted mankind’s only knowledge of its adversary:\r\n\r\n                              “KWO—KWO—KWO!”\r\n\r\nBut there was no answer. Absolute silence enveloped the menacing power.\r\n“KWO” had spoken. He would not speak again. And after twelve hours even\r\nthe most persistent members of the scientific body—who had remained\r\nconstantly in the wireless room throughout the night—reluctantly desisted\r\nfrom further attempts at communication.\r\n\r\nEven this failure found its way into the newspapers and helped to divide\r\npublic opinion. Many persons and influential papers insisted that “KWO’S”\r\nthreat was nothing more than a hoax. Others, however, were inclined to\r\naccept the message as the serious declaration of a human being with\r\npractically supernatural powers. In advancing this opinion they were\r\nsupported by the undeniable fact that from the time the mysterious\r\n“KWO” began his efforts to communicate with the head of the scientific\r\ncongress, until his message had been completed, the strange wireless\r\nsignals accompanying the earth tremors had ceased entirely—a thing that\r\nhad not happened before. When he was through speaking, the signals\r\nhad resumed their clocklike recurrence. It was as if some power had\r\ndeliberately cleared the ether for the transmission of this proclamation\r\nto mankind.\r\n\r\nA feeling of dread—of monstrous uncertainty—hung over everyone and\r\nincreased as the day wore on. Ordinary affairs were neglected, while the\r\ncrowds in public places steadily increased.\r\n\r\nBy nightfall of Thursday even the loudest scoffers at the genuineness\r\nof the “dictator’s” threat began to display symptoms of the general\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nWould the earthquakes begin to subside at midnight?\r\n\r\nUpon the answer to this question hung the fate of the world.\r\n\r\nIt was an exceedingly hot night in most parts of the United States.\r\nScarcely anywhere was a breath of air stirring; the whole country was\r\nblanketed by a suffocating wave of humidity. Low clouds that presaged\r\nrain—but never brought it—added to the general feeling of apprehension.\r\nIt was as if all nature had conspired to furnish a dramatic setting for\r\nthe events about to be enacted.\r\n\r\nAs midnight drew near the excitement became intense. In Europe, as\r\nwell as in America, vast throngs filled the streets in front of the\r\nnewspaper offices, watching the bulletin boards. The Consolidated News\r\nSyndicate had arranged special radio service from various scientific\r\ninstitutions—notably the Washington naval observatory, where savants were\r\nwatching the delicate instruments for recording earth shocks—and any\r\nvariation or subsidence in the tremors would be flashed to newspapers\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the hands of the clocks reached a point equivalent to two minutes of\r\nmidnight, Washington time, a vast hush fell upon the assembled thousands.\r\nThe very atmosphere became aquiver with suspense.\r\n\r\nBut if the scene in the streets was exciting, that within the instrument\r\nroom of the United States naval observatory, where the members of the\r\ninternational scientific congress waited was dramatic beyond description.\r\n\r\nAbout the room sat the scientists and a couple of representatives from\r\nthe Consolidated News. Professor Whiteman himself was stationed at the\r\nseismographs, while at his elbow sat Professor James Frisby, in direct\r\ntelephone communication with the wireless operator in another part of the\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe light was shaded and dim. The heat was stifling. Not a word was\r\nspoken. Scarcely a muscle moved. All were painfully alert.\r\n\r\nEvery eleven minutes and six seconds the building was shaken by a\r\nsubterranean shock. The windows rattled. The floor creaked. Even the\r\nchairs seemed to lift and heave. It had been that way for weeks. But\r\nwould this night see the end?\r\n\r\nWith maddening slowness, the hands of the big clock on the wall—its face\r\nilluminated by a tiny electric lamp—drew toward the hour of twelve.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came one of the earthquakes, that, while no different from\r\nits predecessors, heightened the tension like the crack of a whip.\r\n\r\nAll eyes flew to the timepiece. It registered thirty-four seconds past\r\n11:49 o’clock.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the next tremor would occur at precisely forty seconds after\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nIf the unknown “KWO” were an actual being, and kept his word—at that time\r\nthe shocks would begin to subside!\r\n\r\nThe suspense became terrible. The faces of the scientists were drawn and\r\npale. Beads of perspiration stood out on every brow. The minutes passed.\r\n\r\nThe electric correcting-device on the clock gave a sharp _click_,\r\ndenoting midnight. Forty seconds more! The suffocating atmosphere seemed\r\nalmost to turn cold under the pressure of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThen, almost before anyone could realize it, the earthquake had come and\r\ngone! And not one particle of diminution in its violence had been felt!\r\n\r\nA sigh of relief involuntarily passed around the room. Few moved or\r\nspoke, but there was a lessening of the strain on many faces. It was too\r\nsoon yet, of course, to be sure, but—in most hearts there began to dawn a\r\nfaint ray of hope that, after all, this “dictator of human destiny” might\r\nbe a myth.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly Professor Frisby raised his hand to command quiet, and bent\r\nmore intently over his telephone.\r\n\r\nA short silence followed. Then he turned to the gentlemen and announced\r\nin a voice that seemed curiously dry:\r\n\r\n“The operator reports that no wireless signal accompanied this last\r\nearthquake.”\r\n\r\nAgain the nerve tension in the assembly leaped like an electric spark.\r\nSeveral more minutes passed in silence.\r\n\r\nThen came another quake.\r\n\r\nHad there been a decrease in its force? Opinion was divided.\r\n\r\nAll eyes sped to Professor Whiteman, but he remained absorbed at his\r\nseismographs.\r\n\r\nIn this silence and keen suspense eleven minutes and six seconds again\r\ndragged by. Another earthquake came and went. Once more Professor Frisby\r\nannounced that there had been no wireless signal attending the tremor.\r\nThe savants began to settle themselves for a further wait, when—\r\n\r\nProfessor Whiteman left his instrument and came slowly forward. In the\r\ndim light his face looked lined and gray. Before the rows of seats he\r\nstopped and faltered a moment. Then he said:\r\n\r\n“_Gentlemen, the earthquakes are beginning to subside!_”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the scientists sat as if stunned. Everyone was too appalled\r\nto speak or move. Then the tension was broken by the rush of the\r\nConsolidated News men from the room to get their momentous tidings out to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAfter that the ground shocks died out with increasing rapidity. In an\r\nhour they had ceased entirely, and the tortured planet once more was\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nBut the tumult among the people had only started!\r\n\r\nWith a sudden shock the globe’s inhabitants realized that they were in\r\nthe grip of an unknown being endowed with supernatural power. Whether\r\nhe were man or demi-god, sane or mad, well disposed or malignant—no one\r\ncould guess. Where was his dwelling place, whence the source of his\r\npower, what would be the first manifestation of his authority, or how far\r\nwould he seek to enforce his control? Only time could answer.\r\n\r\nAs this situation dawned upon men, their fears burst all bounds. Frantic\r\nexcitement took possession of the throngs.\r\n\r\nOnly at the naval observatory in Washington was there calmness and\r\nrestraint. The gathering of scientists spent the night in earnest\r\ndeliberation of the course to be followed.\r\n\r\nFinally it was decided that nothing should be done for the present; they\r\nwould merely await events. When it had suited the mysterious “KWO” to\r\nannounce himself to the world he had done so. Thereafter, communication\r\nwith him had been impossible. Doubtless when he was ready to speak again\r\nhe would break his silence—not before. It was reasonable to suppose that,\r\nnow he had proved his power, he would not be long in stating his wishes\r\nor commands.\r\n\r\nEvents soon showed this surmise was correct.\r\n\r\nPromptly at noon the next day—there having in the meantime been no\r\nrecurrence of the earthquakes or electrical disturbances of the ether—the\r\nwireless at the naval observatory again received the mysterious call for\r\nthe presiding officer of the scientific congress.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whiteman had remained at the observatory, in anticipation of\r\nsuch a summons, and soon he, with other leading members of the scientific\r\nassembly, was at the side of the operator in the wireless room.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the call:\r\n\r\n                              “KWO—KWO—KWO!”\r\n\r\nwent forth into the ether, there came a response and the operator started\r\nwriting:\r\n\r\n    “_To the Presiding officer of the International Scientific\r\n    Congress_:\r\n\r\n    “_Communicate this to the various governments of the earth_:\r\n\r\n    “_As a preliminary to the establishment of my sole rule\r\n    throughout the world, the following demands must be complied\r\n    with_:\r\n\r\n    “_First: All standing armies shall be disbanded, and every\r\n    implement of warfare, of whatsoever nature, destroyed._\r\n\r\n    “_Second: All war vessels shall be assembled—those of the\r\n    Atlantic fleets midway between New York and Gibraltar, those\r\n    of the Pacific fleets midway between San Francisco and\r\n    Honolulu—and sunk._\r\n\r\n    “_Third: One-half of all the monetary gold supply of the world\r\n    shall be collected and turned over to my agents at places to be\r\n    announced later._\r\n\r\n    “_Fourth: At noon on the third day after the foregoing demands\r\n    have been complied with, all the existing governments shall\r\n    resign and surrender their powers to my agents, who will be on\r\n    hand to receive them._\r\n\r\n    “_In my next communication I will fix the date for the\r\n    fulfillment of these demands._\r\n\r\n    “_The alternative is the destruction of the globe._\r\n\r\n                                                            “_KWO._”\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of this eventful day that Dr. Gresham and I\r\nreturned from Labrador. A little after 10 o’clock we landed in New York\r\nand, taking a taxicab at the pier, started for our bachelor quarters in\r\napartments near each other west of Central Park.\r\n\r\nAs we reached the center of town we were amazed at the excited crowds\r\nthat filled the streets and at the prodigious din raised by newsboys\r\nselling extras.\r\n\r\nWe stopped the car and bought papers. Huge black headings told the story\r\nat a glance. Also, at the bottom of the first page, we found a brief\r\nchronological summary of all that had happened, from the very beginning\r\nof the mysterious wireless signals three months before. We scanned it\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished the newspaper article I turned to my companion—and was\r\nstruck with horror at the change in his appearance!\r\n\r\nHe was crumpled down upon the seat of the taxi, and his face had taken\r\non a ghastly hue. At first I though he had suffered a stroke. Only\r\nhis eyes held a sign of life, and they seemed fixed on something far\r\naway—something too terrifying to be a part of the world around us.\r\n\r\nSeizing him by the shoulders, I tried to arouse him, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake! What is the matter?”\r\n\r\nMy words had no effect, so I shook him roughly.\r\n\r\nThen he slowly began to come to his senses. His lips moved, without any\r\nsound passing them. But presently he found voice to murmur, as if talking\r\nin his sleep:\r\n\r\n“It has come! The Seuen-H’sin—_the terrible Seuen-H’sin_!”\r\n\r\nAn instant later, with a great effort, he drew himself together and spoke\r\nsharply to the chauffeur:\r\n\r\n“Quick! Never mind those addresses we gave you! Rush us to the Grand\r\nCentral Station! _Hurry!_”\r\n\r\nAs the car suddenly swerved into a side street, I turned to the doctor.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter? Where are you going?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“To Washington!” he snapped, in reply to my second question. “As fast as\r\nwe can get there!”\r\n\r\n“In connection with this earthquake terror?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” he told me; “for—”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then he finished in a strange, awed voice:\r\n\r\n“What the world has seen of this devil ‘KWO’ is only the faintest\r\nprelude to what may come—events so terrible, so utterly opposed to all\r\nhuman experience, that they would stagger the imagination! _This is the\r\nbeginning of the dissolution of our planet!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER III._\r\n\r\nTHE SORCERERS OF CHINA\r\n\r\n“Doubtless you never heard of the Seuen-H’sin.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Dr. Ferdinand Gresham, and these were the first words\r\nhe had uttered since we entered our private compartment on the midnight\r\nexpress for Washington, an hour before.\r\n\r\nI lowered my cigar expectantly.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said; “never until you spoke the name in a momentary fit of\r\nillness this evening.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor gave me a swift, searching glance, as if questioning what I\r\nmight have learned. Presently he went to the door and looked out into the\r\npassage, apparently assuring himself no one was within hearing; then,\r\nlocking the portal, he returned to his seat and said:\r\n\r\n“So you never heard of the Seuen-H’sin—‘The Sect of the Two Moons’? Then\r\nI will tell you: the Seuen-H’sin are the sorcerers of China, and the most\r\nmurderously diabolical breed of human beings on this earth! They are the\r\nmakers of these earthquakes that are aimed to wreck our world!”\r\n\r\nThe astronomer’s declaration so dumfounded me that I could only stare at\r\nhim, wondering if he were serious.\r\n\r\n“The Seuen-H’sin are sorcerers,” he repeated presently, “whose devilish\r\npower is shaking our planet to the core. And I say to you solemnly that\r\nthis ‘KWO’—who is Kwo-Sung-tao, high priest of the Seuen-H’sin—is a\r\nthousand times more dangerous than all the conquerors in history! Already\r\nhe has absolute control of a hundred millions of people—mind and body,\r\nbody and soul!—holding them enthralled by black arts so terrible that the\r\ncivilized mind cannot conceive of them!”\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham leaned forward, his eyes shining brightly, his voice\r\nbetraying deep emotion.\r\n\r\n“Have you any idea,” he demanded, “what goes on in the farthermost\r\ninterior of China? Has _any_ American or European?\r\n\r\n“We read of a republic superseding her ancient monarchy, and we meet her\r\nstudents who are sent here to our schools. We hear of the expansion of\r\nour commerce along the jagged edges of that great Unknown, and we learn\r\nof Chinese railroad projects fostered by our financiers. But no human\r\nbeing in the outside world could possibly conceive what takes place\r\nin that gigantic shadow land—vague and vast as the midnight heavens—a\r\ncontinent unknown, impenetrable!\r\n\r\n“Shut away in that remote interior—in a valley so little heard of that it\r\nis almost mythical—beyond trackless deserts and the loftiest mountains\r\non the globe—this terrible sect of sorcerers has been growing in power\r\nfor thousands of years, storing up secret energy that some day should\r\ninundate the world with horrors such as never have been known!\r\n\r\n“And yet you never heard of the Seuen-H’sin! No; nor has any other\r\nCaucasian, except, perhaps, a chance missionary or two.\r\n\r\n“But I tell you _I have seen them_!”\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham was becoming strangely excited, and his voice rose almost\r\nshrilly above the roar of the train.\r\n\r\n“I have seen them,” he went on. “I have crossed the Mountains of Fear,\r\nwhose summits tower as high as from the earth to the moon, and I have\r\nwatched the stars dance at night upon their glaciers. I have starved upon\r\nthe dead plains of Dzun-Sz’chuen, and I have swum the River of Death.\r\nI have slept in the Caves of Nganhwiu, where the hot winds never cease\r\nand the dead light their campfires on their journey to Nirvana. And I\r\nhave seen, too”—there was a strange, entranced look on his face as he\r\nspoke—“I have seen the Shadow of God on Tseih Hwan and K’eech-ch’a-gan!\r\nBut in the end I have dwelt in Wu-yang!\r\n\r\n“Wu-yang,” he continued, after a brief pause, “is the center of the\r\nSeuen-H’sin—a wondrous dream city beside a lake whose waters are as\r\nopalescent as the sky at dawn; where the gardens are sweet-scented with\r\na million blooms, and the air is filed with bird songs and the music of\r\ngolden bells.\r\n\r\n“But forgive me,” sighed the doctor, rousing himself from his ecstatic\r\ntrain of thought; “I speak in the allegories of another land!”\r\n\r\nWe were silent for a time, until finally I suggested:\r\n\r\n“And the Seuen-H’sin—The Sect of the Two Moons?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” responded Dr. Gresham: “In Wu-yang the Beautiful I dwelt among\r\nthem. For three years that city was my home. I labored in its workshops,\r\nstudied in its schools, and—yes; I will admit it—I took part in those\r\nhellish ceremonies in the Temple of the Moon God—to save myself from\r\ndeath by fiendish torture. And, as my reward, I watched those devils at\r\ntheir miraculous business—_the making of another moon_!”\r\n\r\nWe smoked a moment in silence. Then:\r\n\r\n“Surely,” I objected, “you do not believe in miracles!”\r\n\r\n“Miracles? Yes,” he affirmed seriously—“miracles of science. For the\r\nsorcerers of China are scientists—the greatest that this world has yet\r\nproduced! Talk to me of modern progress—our arts and sciences, our\r\ndiscoveries and inventions. Bah! They are child’s play—clap-trap!—beside\r\nthe accomplishments of this race of Chinese devils! We Americans boast of\r\nour Thomas Edison. Why, the Seuen-H’sin have a thousand Edisons!\r\n\r\n“Think of it—thousands of years before Copernicus discovered that the\r\nearth revolves around the sun, Chinese astronomers understood the\r\nnature of our solar system and accurately computed the movements of the\r\nstars. The use of the magnetic compass was ancient even in those days.\r\nA thousand years before Columbus was born their navigators visited the\r\nwestern coast of North America and maintained colonies for a time. In the\r\nyear 2657 B. C. savants of the Seuen-H’sin completed engineering projects\r\non the Yellow River that never have been surpassed. And forty centuries\r\nbefore Christ the physicians of China practiced inoculation against\r\nsmallpox and wrote erudite books on human anatomy.\r\n\r\n“Scientists? Why, man alive, the Seuen-H’sin are the greatest scientists\r\nthat ever lived! But they haven’t the machinery or the materials or the\r\nfactories that have made the Western nations great. There they are—shut\r\nup in their hidden valley, with no commercial incentives, no contact with\r\nthe world, no desire but to study and experiment.\r\n\r\n“Their scientific development through centuries beyond number\r\nhas had only one object, which was the basis of their fanatical\r\nreligion—the discovery of a means to split this earth and project\r\nan offshoot into space to form a second moon. And if our train\r\nstopped this minute you probably could feel them somewhere beneath\r\nyou—hammering—hammering—hammering away at the world with their terrible\r\nand mysterious power, which even now it may be too late to stop!”\r\n\r\nThe astronomer rose and paced the length of the compartment, apparently\r\nso deep in thought that I was loath to disturb him. But finally I asked:\r\n\r\n“Why do these sorcerers desire a second moon?”\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham resumed his seat and, lighting a fresh cigar, began:\r\n\r\n“Numerous legends that are almost as old as the human race represent\r\nthat the earth once had two moons. And not a few modern astronomers have\r\nheld the same theory. Mars has two satellites, Uranus four, Jupiter five\r\nand Saturn ten. The supposition of these scientists is that the second\r\nsatellite of the earth was shattered, and that its fragments are the\r\nmeteors which occasionally encounter our world in their flight.\r\n\r\n“Now, in the far, far distant past, before the days of Huang-ti and\r\nYu—even before the time of the great semi-mythical kings, Yao and\r\nShun—there ruled in China an emperor of peculiar fame—Ssu-chuan, the\r\nUniversal.\r\n\r\n“Ssu-chuan was a man of weak character and mediocre talents, but his\r\nreign was the greatest in all Chinese history, due to the intelligence\r\nand energy of his empress, Chwang-Keang.\r\n\r\n“In those days, the legends tell us, the world possessed two moons.\r\n\r\n“At the height of his prosperity Ssu-chuan fell in love with a very\r\nbeautiful girl, called Mei-hsi, who became his mistress.\r\n\r\n“The Empress Chwang-Keang was as plain as Mei-hsi was beautiful, and in\r\ntime the mistress prevailed upon her lord to plot his wife’s murder,\r\nso that Mei-hsi might be queen. Chwang-Keang was stabbed to death one\r\nevening in her garden.\r\n\r\n“With her death begins the history of Seuen-H’sin.\r\n\r\n“Simultaneous with the murder of the empress, one of the moons vanished\r\nfrom the sky. The Chinese legends say the spirit of the great ruler\r\ntook refuge upon the satellite, which fled with her from sight of the\r\nearth. Modern astronomers say the satellite probably was shattered by an\r\ninternal explosion.\r\n\r\n“Now that the firm hand of Chwang-Keang was lifted from affairs of state,\r\neverything went wrong in China—until the country reverted virtually to\r\nsavagery.\r\n\r\n“At last Ssu-chuan aroused himself from his pleasures sufficiently to\r\ntake alarm. He consulted his priests and seers, who assured him that\r\nheaven was angry because of the murder of Chwang-Keang. Never again,\r\nthey said, would China know happiness or prosperity until the vanished\r\nmoon returned, bringing the spirit of the dead empress to watch over the\r\naffairs of her beloved land. Upon her return, however, the glory of China\r\nwould rise again, and the Son of Heaven would rule the world.\r\n\r\n“Upon receiving these tidings, the legends relate, Ssu-chuan was consumed\r\nwith pious zeal.\r\n\r\n“Upon a lofty mountain behind the city he built the most magnificent\r\ntemple in the world, and installed there a special priesthood to beseech\r\nheaven to restore the second moon. This priesthood was named the\r\nSeuen-H’sin, or Sect of the Two Moons. The worship of the Moon God was\r\ndeclared the state religion.\r\n\r\n“Gradually the belief that the Seuen-H’sin was to restore the second\r\nmoon—and that, when this happened, the Celestial Kingdom again would\r\nenjoy universal rule—became the fanatical faith of a fourth of China.\r\n\r\n“But finally, in a fit of remorse, Ssu-chuan burnt himself alive in his\r\npalace.\r\n\r\n“The empire of Ssu-chuan dissolved, but the Seuen-H’sin grew greater.\r\nIts high priest attained the most terrible and far-reaching power in\r\nChina. But in the second century B. C., Shi-Hwang-ti, the great military\r\nemperor, made war upon the sorcerers and drove them across the Kuen-lun\r\nmountains. Still they retained great wealth and power; and in Wu-yang\r\nthey made a city that is the dream spot of the world, equipped with\r\nsplendid colleges for the study of astronomy and the sciences and magic.\r\n\r\n“As astronomical knowledge increased among the Seuen-H’sin, they came to\r\nbelieve that the moon once was a part of the earth, having been blown out\r\nof the hollow now filled by the Pacific Ocean. In this theory certain\r\neminent American and French astronomers lately have concurred.\r\n\r\n“The Chinese sorcerers conceived the idea that by scientific means the\r\nearth again could be rent asunder, and its offshoot projected into space\r\nto form a second moon. Henceforth, all their labors were directed toward\r\nfinding that means. And the lust for world domination became the religion\r\nof their race.\r\n\r\n“When I dwelt among them they seemed to be drawing near their goal—and\r\nnow they probably have reached it!\r\n\r\n“But if we may judge from these demands of Kwo-Sung-tao, their plans for\r\nworld conquest have taken a new and simpler turn: by threatening to use\r\ntheir mysterious force to dismember the globe they hope to subjugate\r\nmankind just as effectively as they expected to do by creating a second\r\nmoon and fulfilling their prophecy. Why wreck the earth, if they can\r\nconquer it by threats?\r\n\r\n“If they are able to enforce their demands it will not be long before\r\ncivilization is face-to-face with those powers of evil that grind\r\na quarter of China’s millions beneath their ghastly rule—a rule of\r\nfanaticism and terror that would stun the world!”\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham paused and peered out the window. There was an unearthly look\r\non his face when he again turned toward me.\r\n\r\n“I have seen,” he said, “those hideous powers of the Seuen-H’sin—things\r\nof horror such as the Western mind cannot conceive! When the beating of\r\nmy heart shall cease forever, when my body has been buried in the grave,\r\nand when the Seuen-H’sin’s torture scars”—he tore open his shirt and\r\nrevealed frightful cicatrices upon his chest—“have vanished in the final\r\ndissolution, then, even then, I shall not forget those devils out of hell\r\nin Wu-yang, and I shall feel their power clutching at my soul!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IV._\r\n\r\nDR. GRESHAM TAKES COMMAND\r\n\r\nIt was shortly before dawn when we alighted from the train in Washington.\r\nNewsboys were calling extras:\r\n\r\n“Terrible disaster! Nine thousand lives lost in Mississippi River!”\r\n\r\nPurchasing copies of the papers, Dr. Gresham called a taxicab and\r\ndirected the chauffeur to take us as rapidly as possible to the United\r\nStates Naval Observatory in Georgetown. We read the news as we rode along.\r\n\r\nThe great railroad bridge across the Mississippi River at St. Louis had\r\ncollapsed, plunging three trains into the stream and drowning virtually\r\nall the passengers; and a few minutes later the Mississippi had ceased to\r\nflow past the city, pouring into a huge gap that suddenly had opened in\r\nthe earth at a point about twenty-five miles northwest of the town.\r\n\r\nNearly everyone in St. Louis who could get an automobile had started for\r\nthe point where the Mississippi was tumbling into the earth, and before\r\nlong a vast crowd had assembled along the edges of the steaming chasm,\r\nwatching the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there had come a heavy shock underground and the crack had\r\nheaved nearly shut, sending a vast geyser, the full width of the stream,\r\nspouting a couple of thousand feet aloft. A few moments later this\r\nhuge column of water had thundered back upon the river banks where the\r\nspectators were gathered, stunning and engulfing thousands. At the same\r\ntime the gash had opened again and into it the torrent had swept the\r\nhelpless multitude. Then it had closed once more and remained so, and the\r\nriver had resumed its flow.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that more than 9,000 persons had perished.\r\n\r\n“Kwo-Sung-tao has stopped his earthquakes,” remarked Dr. Gresham, when\r\nhe had finished scanning the newspaper reports, “but irreparable damage\r\nhas been done. Enough water doubtless has found its way into the heated\r\ninterior of the globe to form a steam pressure that will play havoc.”\r\n\r\nSoon we drew up at the white-domed observatory crowning the wooded hill\r\nbeyond Wisconsin Avenue. It was our good fortune to find Professor Howard\r\nWhiteman and several prominent members of the international scientific\r\ncongress still there.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief conversation with these gentlemen—to whom he was well known\r\nby reputation—Dr. Gresham drew Professor Whiteman and two of his chief\r\nassistants aside and began questioning them about the disturbances. He\r\ngave not the slightest hint of his knowledge of the Seuen-H’sin.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was particularly interested in every detail regarding the\r\ncourse taken by the quakes—whether or not all of them had come from the\r\nsame direction, what that direction was, and how far away the point of\r\norigin seemed to be.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whiteman said the seismographs indicated the tremors all _had_\r\ncome from one direction—a point somewhere to the northwest—and had\r\ntraveled in a general southeasterly course. It was his opinion that the\r\nseat of the disturbances was about 3,000 miles distant—certainly not more\r\nthan 4,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThis appeared greatly to surprise my companion and to upset whatever\r\ntheories he might have in mind. Finally he asked to see all the data on\r\nthe tremors, especially the actual seismograph records. At once we were\r\ntaken to the building where these records were kept.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour Dr. Gresham intently studied the charts and\r\ncalculations, making new computations of his own and referring to\r\nnumerous maps. But the longer he worked, the more puzzled he became.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he looked up with an exclamation, and after seemingly weighing\r\nsome new idea, he turned to me and said:\r\n\r\n“Arthur, I need your help. Go to one of the newspaper offices and look\r\nthrough the files of old copies for an account of the capture of the\r\nPacific Steamship _Nippon_ by Chinese pirates. Try to find out what cargo\r\nthe vessel carried. If the newspaper accounts do not give this, then try\r\nat the State Department. But hurry!”\r\n\r\nWe had kept our taxicab waiting, so I was soon speeding toward one of the\r\nnewspaper offices on Pennsylvania Avenue. As I rode along I brought to\r\nmind the strange and terrible story of the great Pacific liner.\r\n\r\nThe _Nippon_ was the newest and largest of the fleet of huge ships in\r\nservice between San Francisco and the Orient. Fifteen months previous,\r\nwhile running from Nagasaki to Shanghai, across the entrance to the\r\nYellow Sea, she had encountered a typhoon of such violence that one of\r\nher propeller shafts was damaged, and after the storm abated she was\r\nobliged to stop at sea for repairs.\r\n\r\nIt was an intensely dark, quiet night. About midnight the officer of the\r\nwatch suddenly heard from the deck amidship a wild, long-drawn yell.\r\nThen all became quiet again. As he started to descend from the bridge he\r\nheard bare feet pattering along the deck below. And then more cries arose\r\nforward—the most awful sounds. Rushing to his cabin, he seized a revolver\r\nand returned to the deck.\r\n\r\nSurging over the rail at a dozen points were savage, half-naked yellow\r\nforms, gripping long, curved knives—the dreaded but almost-extinct\r\nChinese pirates of the Yellow Sea. The fiends swiftly attacked a number\r\nof passengers who had been promenading about, murdering them in cold\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other pirates were rushing to all parts of the ship.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he recovered from his first horrified shock, the officer\r\nleaped toward a group of the Chinamen and emptied his revolver into them.\r\nBut the pirates far outnumbered the cartridges in his weapon, and when\r\nhis last bullet had been fired several of the yellow devils darted at\r\nhim with gleaming knives. Whereupon the officer turned and fled to the\r\nwireless operator’s room nearby.\r\n\r\nHe got inside and fastened the heavy door just a second ahead of his\r\npursuers. While the Chinamen were battering at the portal, he had the\r\noperator send out wireless calls for help, telling what was occurring on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nSeveral ships and land stations picked up the strange story as far as I\r\nhave related it, at which point the message ceased abruptly.\r\n\r\nFrom that instant the _Nippon_ vanished as completely as if she never had\r\nexisted. Not one word ever again was heard of the vessel or of a single\r\nsoul on board.\r\n\r\nIt required only a few minutes’ search through the newspaper files to\r\nfind the information I sought, and soon I was back at the observatory.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham greeted me eagerly.\r\n\r\n“The Steamship _Nippon_,” I reported, “carried a cargo of American shoes,\r\nplows and lumber.”\r\n\r\nMy friend’s face fell with keen disappointment.\r\n\r\n“What else?” he inquired. “Weren’t there other things?”\r\n\r\n“Lots of odds and ends,” I replied—“pianos, automobiles, sewing machines,\r\nmachinery—”\r\n\r\n“_Machinery?_” the doctor shot out quickly. “What kind of machinery?”\r\n\r\nI drew from my pocket the penciled notes I had made at the newspaper\r\noffice and glanced over the items.\r\n\r\n“Some electrical equipment,” I answered. “Dynamos, turbines,\r\nswitchboards, copper cable—all such things—for a hydro-electric plant\r\nnear Hong-kong.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed the doctor in elation. “I was sure of it! We may be\r\ngetting at the mystery at last!”\r\n\r\nSeizing the memoranda, he ran his eyes hurriedly down the list of items.\r\nProfound confidence marked his bearing when he turned to Professor\r\nWhiteman a moment later and said:\r\n\r\n“I must obtain an immediate audience with the President of the United\r\nStates. You know him personally. Can you arrange it?”\r\n\r\nProfessor Whiteman could not conceal his surprise.\r\n\r\n“Concerning these earthquakes?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” my friend assured him.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer looked at his colleague keenly.\r\n\r\n“I will see what I can do,” he said. And he went off to a telephone.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes he was back.\r\n\r\n“The President and his cabinet meet at 9 o’clock,” announced the\r\ndirector. “You will be received at that hour.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham looked at his watch. It was 8:30.\r\n\r\n“If you will be so kind,” said Dr. Gresham, “I would like to have you go\r\nwith us to the President—and Sir William Belford, Monsieur Linne and the\r\nDuke de Rizzio as well, if they are still here. What we have to discuss\r\nis of the utmost importance to their governments, as well as to ours.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Whiteman signified his own willingness to go, and went to hunt\r\nthe other gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThis trio my friend had named comprised undoubtedly the leading minds\r\nof the international scientific congress. Sir William Belford was the\r\ngreat English physicist, head of the British delegation to the congress.\r\nMonsieur Camille Linne was the leader of the French group of scientists,\r\na distinguished electrical expert. And the Duke de Rizzio was the famous\r\nItalian inventor and wireless telegraph authority, who headed the\r\nrepresentatives from Rome.\r\n\r\nThe director soon returned with the three visitors, and we all hastened\r\nto the White House. Promptly at 9 o’clock we were ushered into the room\r\nwhere the nation’s chief executive and his cabinet—all grim and careworn\r\nfrom a night of sleepless anxiety—were in session.\r\n\r\nAs briefly as possible, Dr. Gresham told the story of the Seuen-H’sin.\r\n\r\n“It is their purpose,” he concluded, “to crack open the earth’s crust by\r\nthese repeated shocks, so the water from the oceans will pour into the\r\nglobe’s interior. There, coming into contact with incandescent matter,\r\nsteam will be generated until there is an explosion that will split the\r\nplanet in two.”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to the discredit of the President and his advisers that they\r\ncould not at once accept so fantastic a tale.\r\n\r\n“How can these Chinamen produce an artificial quaking of the earth?”\r\nasked the President.\r\n\r\n“That,” replied the astronomer frankly, “I am not prepared to answer\r\nyet—although I have a strong suspicion of the method employed.”\r\n\r\nFor the greater part of an hour the gentlemen questioned the astronomer.\r\nThey did not express doubt of his veracity in his account of the\r\nSeuen-H’sin, but merely questioned his judgment in attributing to that\r\nsect the terrible power to control the internal forces of the earth.\r\n\r\n“You are asking us,” objected the Secretary of State, “virtually to\r\nreturn to the Dark Ages and believe in magicians and sorcerers and\r\nsupernatural events!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all!” returned the astronomer. “I am asking you to deal with\r\nmodern facts—to grapple with scientific ideas that are so far ahead of\r\nour times the world is not prepared to accept them!”\r\n\r\n“Then you believe that an unheard-of group of Chinamen, hiding in some\r\nremote corner of the globe, has developed a higher form of science than\r\nthe brightest minds of all the civilized nations?” remarked the Attorney\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n“Events of the last few weeks seem to have demonstrated that,” replied\r\nDr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n“But,” protested the President, “if these Mongolians aim at splitting the\r\nglobe to project a new moon into the sky, why should they be satisfied\r\nwith an entirely different object—the acquisition of temporal power?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” the scientist informed him, “the acquisition of temporal power\r\nis their ultimate goal. Their only object in creating a second moon is to\r\nfulfill the prophecy that they should rule the earth again when two moons\r\nhung in the sky. If they can grasp universal rule _without_ splitting the\r\nglobe—merely by _threatening_ to do so—they are very much the gainers.”\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy next voiced a doubt.\r\n\r\n“But it is evident,” he remarked, “that if Kwo-Sung-tao makes the heavens\r\nfall, they will fall on his own head also!”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” admitted the astronomer.\r\n\r\n“Then,” persisted the Secretary, “is it likely that human beings would\r\nplot the destruction of the earth when they knew it would involve them,\r\ntoo, in the ruin?”\r\n\r\n“You forget,” returned the doctor, “that we are dealing with a band of\r\nreligious fanatics—undoubtedly the most irrational zealots that ever\r\nlived!\r\n\r\n“Besides,” he added, “the Seuen-H’sin, in spite of its threats, does not\r\nexpect to destroy the world completely. It contemplates no more than the\r\nblowing of a fragment off into space.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, shall be done?” inquired the President.\r\n\r\n“Place at my disposal one of the fastest destroyers of the Pacific\r\nfleet—equipped with certain scientific apparatus I shall devise—and let\r\nme deal with the Seuen-H’sin in my own way,” announced the astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe gathering at once voiced vigorous objection.\r\n\r\n“What you propose might mean war with China!” exclaimed the President.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” was the answer. “It is possible not a single shot will be\r\nfired. And, in any event, we will not go anywhere near China.”\r\n\r\nThe consternation of the officials increased.\r\n\r\n“We shall not go near China,” Dr. Gresham explained, “because I am\r\ncertain the leaders of the Seuen-H’sin are no longer there. At this very\r\nhour, I am convinced, Kwo-Sung-tao and his devilish band are very much\r\nnearer to us than you dream!”\r\n\r\nThe gathering broke into excited discussion.\r\n\r\n“After all,” remarked Sir William Belford, “suppose this expedition\r\n_should_ plunge us into hostilities. Unless something is done quickly, we\r\nare likely to meet a fate far worse than war!”\r\n\r\n“I am willing to do anything necessary to remove this menace from the\r\nworld—if the menace actually exists,” the President stated. “But I am\r\nunable to convince myself that these wireless messages threatening\r\nmankind are not merely the emanations of a crank, who is taking advantage\r\nof conditions over which he has no control.”\r\n\r\n“But I maintain,” argued Sir William, “that the sender of these messages\r\n_has_ fully demonstrated his control over our planet. He prophesied a\r\ndefinite performance, and that prophecy was fulfilled to the letter. We\r\ncannot attribute its fulfillment to natural causes, nor to any human\r\nagency other than his. I say it is time we recognized his power, and\r\ndealt with him as best we may.”\r\n\r\nSeveral others now began to incline to this view.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Attorney General joined in the discussion with considerable\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n“I must protest,” he interposed, “against what seems to me an\r\nextraordinary credulity upon the part of many of you gentlemen. I view\r\nthis affair as a rational human being. Some natural phenomenon occurred\r\nto disturb the solidity of the earth’s crust. That disturbance has\r\nceased. Some joker or lunatic was lucky enough to strike it right with\r\nhis prediction of this cessation—nothing more. The disturbance may never\r\nreappear. Or it may resume at any moment and end in a calamity. No one\r\ncan foretell. But when you ask me to believe that these earthquakes were\r\ndue to some human agency—that a mysterious bugaboo was responsible for\r\nthem—I tell you _no_!”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Linne had risen and was walking nervously up and down the room.\r\nPresently he turned to the Attorney General and remarked:\r\n\r\n“That is merely your opinion, sir. It is not proof. Why may these\r\nearthquakes not be due to some human agency? Have we not begun to solve\r\nall the mysteries of nature? A few years ago it was inconceivable that\r\nelectricity could ever be used for power, heat and light. May not many\r\nof the inconceivable things of today be the commonplace realities of\r\ntomorrow? We have earthquakes. Is it beyond imagination that the forces\r\nwhich produce them can be controlled?”\r\n\r\n“Still,” returned the Attorney General vigorously, “my answer is that\r\nwe have no adequate reason for attributing either the appearance or the\r\ncessation of these earthquakes to any human power! And I am unalterably\r\nopposed to making the government of the United States ridiculous by\r\nfitting out a naval expedition to combat a phantom adversary.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham now had risen and was standing behind his chair, his face\r\nflushed and his eyes shining. At this point he broke sharply into the\r\ndiscussion, the cold, cutting force of his words leaving no doubt of his\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “I did not come here to _argue_; I came to\r\n_help_! As surely as I am standing here, our world is upon the brink of\r\ndissolution! And I alone may be able to save it! But, if I am to do so,\r\nyou must agree absolutely to the course of action I propose!”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his watch. It was 10 o’clock.\r\n\r\n“At noon,” he announced, in tones of finality, “I shall return for my\r\nanswer!”\r\n\r\nAnd he turned and started for the door.\r\n\r\nIn the tenseness of those last few moments, almost no one had been\r\nconscious of the soft buzzing of the President’s telephone signal, or of\r\nthe fact that the executive had removed the receiver and was listening\r\ninto the instrument.\r\n\r\nNow, as Dr. Gresham reached the door, the President lifted a hand in a\r\ncommanding gesture and cried: “Wait!”\r\n\r\nThe astronomer turned back into the room.\r\n\r\nFor a minute, perhaps, the President listened at the telephone; and as\r\nhe did so the expression of his face underwent a grave change. Then,\r\ntelling the person at the other end of the wire to wait, he addressed the\r\ngathering:\r\n\r\n“The naval observatory at Georgetown is on the ’phone. There has just\r\nbeen another communication from ‘KWO.’ It says—”\r\n\r\nThe executive again spoke into the telephone: “Read the message once\r\nmore, please!”\r\n\r\nAfter a few seconds, speaking slowly, he repeated:\r\n\r\n    “‘_To the President Officer of the International Scientific\r\n    Congress:_\r\n\r\n    “‘_I hereby set the hour of noon, on the twenty-fifth day\r\n    of the next month, September, as the time when I shall\r\n    require compliance with the first three demands of my last\r\n    communication. The fulfillment of the fourth demand—the\r\n    resignation of all the existing governments—therefore, will\r\n    take place on the twenty-eighth day of September._\r\n\r\n    “‘_In order to facilitate the execution of my plans, I shall\r\n    require an answer by midnight next Saturday, one week from\r\n    today, from the governments of the world as to whether they\r\n    will comply with my terms of surrender. In the absence of a\r\n    favorable reply by that time, I shall terminate, absolutely and\r\n    forever, all negotiations with the human race, and shall cause\r\n    the earthquakes to resume and continue with increasing violence\r\n    until the earth is shattered._\r\n\r\n                                                          “‘_KWO._’”\r\n\r\nWhen the President finished reading and hung up the telephone, a\r\ndeathlike silence fell upon the gathering. Dr. Gresham, standing by the\r\ndoor, made no further movement to depart.\r\n\r\nThe President glanced at the faces about him, as if seeking some solution\r\nof the problem. But no aid was forthcoming from that source.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the silence was broken by a chair being pushed back from the\r\ntable, and Sir William Belford rose to speak.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “this is no time for hesitation. If the United\r\nStates does not immediately grant Dr. Gresham’s request for a naval\r\nexpedition against the Seuen-H’sin, Great Britain _will_ do so!”\r\n\r\nAt once Monsieur Linne spoke up: “And that is the attitude of France!”\r\n\r\nThe Duke de Rizzio nodded, as if in acquiescence.\r\n\r\nWithout further hesitation, the President announced his decision.\r\n\r\n“I will take the responsibility for acting first and explaining to\r\nCongress afterward,” he said. And, turning to the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nhe added:\r\n\r\n“Please see that Dr. Gresham gets whatever ships, men, money and supplies\r\nhe needs—without delay!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER V._\r\n\r\nBEGINNING A STRANGE VOYAGE\r\n\r\nImmediately after obtaining the President’s permission to combat the\r\nSeuen-H’sin, Dr. Ferdinand Gresham went into conference with the\r\nSecretary of the Navy and his aides. Soon telegraphic orders flew thick\r\nand fast from Washington, and before nightfall two high naval officers\r\nleft the capital for San Francisco personally to expedite arrangements\r\nfor the expedition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the doctor hurried me back to New York with instructions to\r\nvisit the electrical concern that had manufactured the dynamos and other\r\nequipment that had been aboard the Steamship _Nippon_, and obtain all the\r\ninformation possible about this machinery. This I did without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe government arranged with a big electrical machinery firm to place\r\na section of its plant at Dr. Gresham’s disposal, and as soon as the\r\nastronomer returned to New York he plunged into feverish activity at this\r\nshop, personally superintending the construction of his paraphernalia.\r\n\r\nAs fast as this apparatus was completed it was rushed off by airplane to\r\nthe Mare Island Navy Yard at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIt had already been settled that I was to accompany the doctor on his\r\nexpedition, so my friend availed himself of my services for many tasks.\r\nSome of these struck me as most odd.\r\n\r\nI had to purchase a large quantity of fine silks of brilliant hues,\r\nmostly orange, blue and violet; also a supply of grease paints and other\r\nmaterials for theatrical make-up. These articles were sent to Mare Island\r\nwith the scientific equipment.\r\n\r\nDay by day, the week which “KWO” had granted the world to announce\r\nits surrender slipped by. During this period the utmost secrecy was\r\nmaintained regarding the projected naval expedition. The public knew\r\nnothing of the strange story of the sorcerers of China. Anxiety was\r\nuniversal and acute.\r\n\r\nMany persons favored surrender to the would-be “emperor of the earth,”\r\narguing that any person who proposed to abolish war, possessed a\r\ngreatness of spirit far beyond any known statesman; they were willing\r\nto entrust the future of the world to such a dictator. Others contended\r\nthat the demand for destruction of all implements of war was merely a\r\nprecautionary measure against resistance to tyranny.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham urged to the authorities at Washington that in dealing with\r\nso unscrupulous and inhuman a foe as the sorcerers, equally unscrupulous\r\nmethods were justified. He proposed that the nations inform “KWO” they\r\nwould surrender, which would ward off the immediate resumption of the\r\nearthquakes and give the naval expedition time to accomplish its work.\r\n\r\nBut the governments could not agree upon any course of action; and in\r\nthis state of indecision the last day of grace drew toward its close.\r\n\r\nAs midnight approached, vast crowds assembled about the newspaper\r\noffices, eager to learn what was going to happen.\r\n\r\nAt last the fateful hour came—and passed in silence. The world had failed\r\nto concede its surrender.\r\n\r\nFive minutes more slipped into eternity.\r\n\r\nThen there was a sudden stir as bulletins appeared. Their message was\r\nbrief. At three minutes past 12 o’clock the wireless at the United States\r\nNaval Observatory had received this communication:\r\n\r\n    “_To All Mankind:_\r\n\r\n    “_I have given the world an opportunity to continue in peace\r\n    and prosperity. My offer has been rejected. The responsibility\r\n    is upon your own heads. This is my final message to the human\r\n    race._\r\n\r\n                                                            “_KWO._”\r\n\r\nWithin an hour the earthquakes resumed. And they were repeated, as\r\nbefore, exactly eleven minutes and six seconds apart.\r\n\r\nWith their reappearance vanished the last vestige of doubt that the\r\nterrestrial disturbances were due to human agency—to a being powerful\r\nenough to do what he chose with the planet.\r\n\r\nBy the end of three days it was noticed that the shocks were increasing\r\nin violence much swifter than previously, as if the earth’s crust had\r\nbeen so weakened that it could no longer resist the hammering.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Dr. Gresham announced that he was ready to leave for the\r\nPacific Coast. The government had one of its giant mail planes waiting\r\nat an aviation field on Long Island, and in its comfortable enclosed\r\ninterior we were whisked across the continent.\r\n\r\nIn less than two days we alighted at the Mare Island Navy Yard, where the\r\n_Albatross_, the destroyer that was to serve for our expedition, lay at\r\nour disposal.\r\n\r\nThe _Albatross_ was the newest, largest and fastest destroyer of the\r\nPacific fleet—an oil-burning craft carrying a crew of 117 men.\r\n\r\nMost of the boxes and crates of material that we had sent from New York\r\nbeing already on deck, the astronomer immediately went to work with a\r\ncorps of the navy’s electricians to assemble his apparatus.\r\n\r\nI was sent off to find six men tailors, all familiar with the making\r\nof theatrical costumes, who were willing to undertake a mysterious and\r\ndangerous sea voyage; also two actors skilled in make-up.\r\n\r\nAll during this time the earthquakes never varied from their interval of\r\neleven minutes and six seconds, and the seriousness of affairs throughout\r\nthe world continued to grow. In Europe and America deep fissures,\r\nsometimes hundreds of miles long, now appeared in the ground. Gradually\r\nit became apparent that these cracks in the earth’s crust were confined\r\nwithin a definite area, which roughly formed a circle touching the\r\nMississippi River on the west and Serbia on the east.\r\n\r\nThen, on the morning after our arrival in San Francisco, half a dozen\r\nnoted scientists—none of whom, however, belonged to the little group\r\nthat had been taken into Dr. Gresham’s confidence regarding the\r\nSeuen-H’sin—issued a warning to the public.\r\n\r\nThey prophesied that the world soon would be rent by an explosion, and\r\nthat the portion within the circular area already outlined would be blown\r\naway into space or would be pulverized.\r\n\r\nNearly one-fifth of the entire surface of the earth was included in this\r\ndoomed circle, embracing the most civilized countries of the globe—the\r\neastern half of the United States and Canada; all of the British Isles,\r\nFrance, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland and\r\nDenmark; and most of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Brazil. Here, too, were\r\nlocated the world’s greatest cities—New York, London, Paris, Berlin,\r\nVienna, Rome, Chicago, Boston, Washington and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe scientists urged the people of the eastern United States and Canada\r\nto flee immediately beyond the Rocky Mountains, while the inhabitants of\r\nwestern Europe were advised to take refuge east of the Carpathians.\r\n\r\nThe first result of this warning was simply to daze the public. But\r\nin a few hours the true character of the predicted happenings dawned\r\nupon people in full force. Then terror—blind, sickening, unreasoning\r\nterror—seized the masses, and there began the most gigantic and terrible\r\nexodus in the history of the earth—a migration that in a few hours\r\ndeveloped into a mad race of half the planet’s inhabitants across\r\nthousands of miles.\r\n\r\nTransportation systems were seized by the frenzied throngs and rendered\r\nuseless in the jam. People started frantically in airplanes, automobiles,\r\nhorsedrawn vehicles—even on foot. All restraints of law and order\r\nvanished in the hideous struggle of “every man for himself.”\r\n\r\nAt last, toward midnight of this day, Dr. Gresham finished his work.\r\nTogether we made a final tour of inspection through the ship—which gave\r\nme my first opportunity to see most of the scientific paraphernalia the\r\ndoctor had constructed.\r\n\r\nElectrical equipment was scattered everywhere—several big generators, a\r\nwhole battery of huge induction coils, submarine telephones, switchboards\r\nwith strange clocklike devices mounted upon them, and reels of heavy\r\ncopper wire.\r\n\r\nOne thing that particularly attracted my attention was an instrument at\r\nthe very bottom of the ship’s hold. It looked like the seismographs used\r\non land for recording earthquakes. I observed, too, that the wireless\r\ntelegraph equipment of the destroyer had been much enlarged, giving it an\r\nexceedingly wide radius.\r\n\r\nThe crated parts of two hydroplanes lay on deck, besides half a dozen\r\nlight, portable mountain mortars, with a quantity of high-explosive\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nAt the finish of our inspection, the doctor sought Commander Mitchell,\r\nthe vessel’s chief officer, and announced:\r\n\r\n“You may start at once—on the course I have outlined.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we were silently speeding toward the Golden Gate.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham and myself then went to bed.\r\n\r\nWhen we awoke the next morning we were out of sight of land and were\r\nsteaming at full speed north in the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VI._\r\n\r\nTHE COASTS OF MYSTERY\r\n\r\nHour after hour the destroyer kept up her furious pace almost due north\r\nin the Pacific. We never came in sight of land, and it was impossible for\r\nme to guess whence we were bound.\r\n\r\nThroughout the first day Dr. Gresham remained in his stateroom—silent,\r\ntroubled, buried in a mass of arithmetical calculations.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the ship the six tailors I had brought on board\r\nlabored diligently upon a number of Chinese costumes, the designs for\r\nwhich the doctor had sketched for them.\r\n\r\nAnd on deck a detail of men was busy unpacking and assembling one of the\r\ntwo hydroplanes.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the second day Dr. Gresham laid aside his calculations\r\nand began to display the keenest interest in the details of the voyage.\r\nAbout midnight he had the ship stopped, although neither land nor any\r\nother craft was in sight; whereupon he went to the hold and studied the\r\nhydro-seismographs. To my surprise I saw that, although we were adrift\r\nupon the restless ocean, the instrument was recording tremors similar\r\nto earthquakes on land. These occurred precisely eleven minutes and six\r\nseconds apart.\r\n\r\nSeeing my astonishment, the doctor explained:\r\n\r\n“It is possible to record earth shocks even at sea. The ocean bed imparts\r\nthe jar to the water, through which the tremor continues like the wave\r\ncaused by throwing a stone into a pond.”\r\n\r\nBut the thing which seemed to interest my friend most was that these\r\nshocks now appeared to be originating at some point to the northeast of\r\nus, instead of to the northwest, as we had noted them in Washington.\r\n\r\nSoon he ordered the vessel started again, this time on a northeasterly\r\ncourse, and the next morning we were close to land.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham, who at last had begun to throw off his taciturn mood, told\r\nme this was the coast of the almost unsettled province of Cassiar, in\r\nBritish Columbia. Later, as we began to pass behind some rugged islands,\r\nhe said we were entering Fitz Hugh Sound, a part of the “inland passage”\r\nto Alaska. We were now approximately 300 miles northwest of the city of\r\nVancouver.\r\n\r\n“Somewhere, not far to the north of here,” added the doctor, “is ‘The\r\nCountry of the Great Han,’ where Chinese navigators, directed by\r\nHuei-Sen, a Buddhist priest, landed and founded colonies in the year 499\r\nA. D. You will find it all recorded in ‘The Book of Changes,’ which was\r\nwritten in the reign of Tai-ming, in the dynasty of Yung: how, between\r\nthe years 499 and 556, Chinese adventurers made many trips across the\r\nPacific to these colonies, bringing to the wild inhabitants the laws of\r\nBuddha, his sacred books and images; building stone temples; and causing\r\nat last the rudeness of the natives’ customs to disappear.”\r\n\r\nWith this my friend left me, upon some summons from the ship’s commander,\r\nand I could learn no more.\r\n\r\nThe region into which we were now penetrating was one of the wildest\r\nand loneliest on the North American continent. The whole coastline was\r\nfringed by a chain of islands—the tops of a submerged mountain range.\r\nBetween these islands and the continent extended a maze of deep, narrow\r\nchannels, some of which connected in a continuous inland waterway. The\r\nmainland was a wilderness of lofty peaks, penetrated at intervals by\r\ntortuous fiords, which, according to the charts, sometimes extended\r\nerratically inland for a hundred miles or more. Back from the coast a few\r\nmiles, we could see the elevated gorges of the main range filled with\r\nglaciers, and occasionally one of these gigantic rivers of ice pushed\r\nout to the Sound, where its face broke away in an endless flotilla of\r\nicebergs.\r\n\r\nThe only dwellers in this region were the few inhabitants of the tiny\r\nIndian fishing villages, scattered many miles apart; and even of these we\r\nsaw not a sign throughout the day.\r\n\r\nToward nightfall the doctor had the _Albatross_ drop anchor in a quiet\r\nlagoon, and the hydroplane that had been assembled on deck was lowered to\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nIt now lacked two nights of the period of full moon, and the nearly\r\nround satellite hung well overhead as darkness fell, furnishing, in that\r\nclear atmosphere, a beautiful illumination in which every detail of the\r\nsurrounding mountains stood forth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last trace of daylight had vanished, Dr. Gresham, equipped\r\nwith a pair of powerful binoculars, appeared on deck, accompanied by an\r\naviator. He said nothing about where he was going; and, knowing his moods\r\nso intimately, I realized it was useless to seek information until he\r\nvolunteered it. But he handed me a large sealed envelope, remarking:\r\n\r\n“I am going for a trip that may take all night. In case I should not\r\nreturn by sun-up you will know something has happened to me, and you\r\nare to open this envelope and have Commander Mitchell act upon the\r\ninstructions it contains.”\r\n\r\nWith this, he gave me a firm hand-clasp that plainly was meant for a\r\npossible farewell, and followed the aviator into the plane. In a few\r\nmoments they were off, their new type of noiseless motor making scarcely\r\na sound, and soon were climbing towards the summits of the snow-crowned\r\npeaks to the eastward. Almost before we realized it, they were lost from\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to keep watch through the night for the return of my\r\nfriend; but after several hours I fell asleep and knew no more until dawn\r\nwas reddening the mountaintops. Then the throbbing of the destroyer’s\r\nengines awakened me, and I hurried on deck to find Dr. Gresham himself\r\ngiving orders for the vessel’s movements.\r\n\r\nThe scientist never once referred to the events of the night as he\r\npartook of a light breakfast and went to bed. However, I could tell by\r\nhis manner that he had not met with success.\r\n\r\nSlowly the ship continued northward most of that day, through the awesome\r\nfastnesses of Fitz Hugh Sound, until we reached the mouth of a grim fiord\r\nset down on the charts as Dean Channel. Here we cast anchor.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Dr. Gresham put in his appearance, viewed the\r\nmainland through his glasses, and then went into the ship’s hold to study\r\nhis earthquake recorder. What he observed apparently pleased him.\r\n\r\nThis night also was moonlit and crystal-clear; and, as before, when\r\ndaylight had departed, the doctor reminded me of the sealed orders I held\r\nagainst his failure to return at sunrise, bade me farewell, and started\r\noff in the airship, flying straight toward the range of peaks that walled\r\nthe eastern world.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion a series of remarkable happenings removed all difficulty\r\nof my keeping awake.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 o’clock, when I chanced to be visiting in the commander’s cabin,\r\nan officer came and informed us of some strange lights that had been\r\nobserved above the mountains at a distance inland. We went on deck and,\r\nsure enough, beheld a peculiar and inexplicable phenomenon.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast the heavens were illuminated at intervals by flashes\r\nof white light extending, fan-shaped, far overhead. The display was as\r\nbrilliant and beautiful as it was mysterious. For a good while we watched\r\nit—until I was suddenly struck with the regularity of the intervals\r\nbetween the flashes. Timing the lights with my watch, I found they\r\noccurred _precisely eleven minutes and six seconds apart_!\r\n\r\nWith a new idea in mind, I made a note of the exact instant when each\r\nflash appeared; then I went down into the hold of the ship and looked at\r\nDr. Gresham’s hydro-seismograph. As I suspected, the aerial flashes had\r\noccurred simultaneously with the earthquakes.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the deck the phenomenon in the sky had ceased, and it\r\ndid not appear again all night.\r\n\r\nBut shortly after midnight another portentous event occurred to claim\r\nundivided attention.\r\n\r\nThe powerful wireless of the _Albatross_, which could hear messages\r\ncoming and going throughout the United States and Canada, as well as\r\nover a great part of the Pacific Ocean, began to pick up accounts of\r\nterrible happenings all over the world. The fissures in the ground, which\r\nhad appeared shortly before we left San Francisco, had suddenly widened\r\nand lengthened into a nearly-unbroken ring about the portion of the\r\nglobe from which the inhabitants had been warned to flee. Within this\r\ndanger-circle the ground had begun to vibrate heavily and continuously—as\r\nthe lid of a tea kettle “dances” when the pressure of steam beneath it is\r\nseeking a vent.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the public from the doomed area had grown into an appalling\r\nhegira—until a fresh disaster, a few hours ago, had suddenly cut it\r\nshort: the Rocky Mountains had begun to fall down throughout most of\r\ntheir extent, obliterating all the railroads and other highways that\r\npenetrated their chain. Now the way to safety beyond the mountains was\r\nhopelessly blocked.\r\n\r\nAnd with this catastrophe hell had broken loose among the people of\r\nAmerica!\r\n\r\nIt was near dawn before these stories ceased. The officers and myself\r\nwere still discussing them when day broke and we beheld Dr. Gresham’s\r\nhydroplane circling high overhead, seeking a landing. In a few minutes\r\nthe doctor was with us.\r\n\r\nThe instant I set eyes on him I knew he had met with some degree of\r\nsuccess. But he said nothing until we were alone and I had poured out the\r\ntale of the night’s happenings.\r\n\r\n“So you saw the flashes?” remarked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“We were greatly puzzled by them,” I admitted. “And you?”\r\n\r\n“I was directly above them and saw them made,” he announced.\r\n\r\n“Saw them _made_?” I repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he assured me; “indeed, I have had a most interesting trip. I\r\nwould have taken you with me, only it would have increased the danger,\r\nwithout serving any purpose. However, I am going on another jaunt\r\ntonight, in which you might care to join me.”\r\n\r\nI told him I was most eager to do so.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” he approved; “then you had better go to bed and get all the\r\nrest you can, for our adventure will not be child’s play.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor then sought the ship’s commander and asked him to proceed very\r\nslowly up the deep and winding Dean Channel, keeping a sharp lookout\r\nahead. As soon as the vessel started we went to bed.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-afternoon when we awakened. Looking out our cabin portholes,\r\nwe saw we were moving slowly past lofty granite precipices that were so\r\nclose it seemed we might almost reach out and touch them. Quickly we got\r\non deck.\r\n\r\nUpon being informed that we had gone about seventy-five miles up Dean\r\nChannel, Dr. Gresham stationed himself on the bridge with a pair of\r\npowerful glasses, and for several hours gave the closest scrutiny ahead,\r\nas new vistas of the tortuous waterway unfolded.\r\n\r\nWe now seemed to be passing directly into the heart of the lofty Cascade\r\nMountain range that runs the length of Cassiar Province in British\r\nColumbia. At times the cliffs bordering the fiord drew in so close that\r\nit seemed we had reached the end of the channel, while again they rounded\r\nout into graceful slopes thickly carpeted with pines. Still there was no\r\nsign that the foot of man ever had trod this wilderness.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Dr. Gresham became very nervous, and toward\r\ntwilight he had the ship stopped and a launch lowered.\r\n\r\n“We will start at once,” he told me, “and Commander Mitchell will go with\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nTaking from me the sealed letter of instructions he had left in my care\r\nbefore starting on his airplane trips the previous nights, he handed it\r\nto the commander, saying: “Give this to the officer you leave in charge\r\nof the ship. It is his orders in case anything should happen to us and we\r\ndo not return by morning. Also, please triple the strength of the night\r\nwatch. Run your vessel close under the shadows of the bank, and keep her\r\npitch dark. We are now in the heart of the enemy’s country, and we can’t\r\ntell what sort of a lookout he may be keeping.”\r\n\r\nWhile Commander Mitchell was attending to these orders, the doctor sent\r\nme below to get a pair of revolvers for each of us. When I returned the\r\nthree of us entered the launch and put off up the channel.\r\n\r\nSlowly and noiselessly we moved ahead in the gathering shadows near\r\nshore. The astronomer sat in the bow, silent and alert, gazing constantly\r\nahead through his glasses.\r\n\r\nWe had proceeded scarcely fifteen minutes when the doctor suddenly\r\nordered the launch stopped. Handing his binoculars to me and pointing\r\nahead beyond a sharp bend we were just rounding, he exclaimed excitedly:\r\n\r\n“_Look!_”\r\n\r\nI did so, and to my astonishment saw a great steamship lying at a wharf!\r\n\r\nCommander Mitchell now had brought his glasses into use, and a moment\r\nlater he leaped to his feet, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“My God, men! _That’s the vanished Pacific liner Nippon!_”\r\n\r\nAn instant more and I also had discerned the name, standing out in white\r\nletters against the black stern. Soon I made a second discovery that\r\nthrilled me with amazement: faint columns of smoke were rising from the\r\nvessel’s funnels, as if she were manned by a crew and ready to sail!\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham was the first to speak; his excitement now had left him, and\r\nhe was cool and commanding.\r\n\r\n“Let us get back to the _Albatross_,” he said, “as quickly as we can!”\r\n\r\nOn board the destroyer, the doctor again cautioned Commander Mitchell\r\nabout keeping a sharp lookout and allowing no lights anywhere.\r\n\r\nThen the scientist and I hastened to our cabin, where Chinese suits of\r\ngorgeous silk had been laid out for us; they were part of the quantity of\r\nsuch garments my six tailors had been making. There were two outfits for\r\neach—one of flaming orange, which we put on first, and one of dark blue,\r\nwhich we slipped on over the other. Then one of the actors was summoned,\r\nand he made up our faces so skillfully that it would have been difficult\r\nto distinguish us from Chinamen.\r\n\r\nWhen the actor had left the room, the doctor handed me the revolvers I\r\nhad carried before, and also a long, villainous-looking knife. To these\r\nhe added a pair of field glasses. After similarly arming himself, he\r\nannounced:\r\n\r\n“I feel I must warn you, Arthur, that this trip may be the most perilous\r\nof your whole life. All the chances are against our living to see\r\ntomorrow’s sun, and if we die it is likely to be by the most fiendish\r\ntorture ever devised by human beings! Think well before you start!”\r\n\r\nI promptly assured him I was willing to go wherever he might lead.\r\n\r\n“But where,” I asked, “is that to be?”\r\n\r\n“We are going,” he answered, “into the hell-pits of the Seuen-H’sin!”\r\n\r\nAnd with that we entered the launch and put off into the coming darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VII._\r\n\r\nTHE MOON GOD’S TEMPLE\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the launch again brought us within sight of the\r\nmystery ship, the _Nippon_.\r\n\r\nHere we landed and had the seaman take the launch back to the destroyer.\r\nWith a final inspection of our revolvers and knives, we started forward\r\nthrough the rocks and timber toward the vessel.\r\n\r\nIt was the night of the full moon, but the satellite had not yet risen\r\nabove the mountains to the east, so we had only the soft gleam of the\r\nstars to light us on our way. In spite of the northern latitude, it was\r\nnot uncomfortably cold, and soon we were spellbound by the gorgeous\r\npanorama of the night. Above us, through the lattice-work of boughs, the\r\ncalm, cold stars moved majestically across the black immensity of space.\r\nThe dark was fragrant with the scent of pines. Strangely hushed and still\r\nthe universe appeared, as if in the silence world were whispering to\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe could now feel the periodic earthquakes very plainly—as if we were\r\ndirectly over the seat of the disturbances.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we reached the edge of the clearing about the _Nippon’s_\r\nwharf. There were no buildings, so we had an unobstructed view of the\r\nvessel, lying tied to the dock. Two or three lights shone faintly from\r\nher portholes, but no one was visible about her.\r\n\r\nThe wharf was at the entrance to a little side valley that ran off to\r\nthe southeast through a break in the precipitous wall of the fiord. From\r\nthis ravine poured a turbulent mountain stream which, I recalled from the\r\nship’s charts, was named Dean River.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief look around we discovered a wide, smooth roadway leading\r\nfrom the wharf into the valley, paralleling the stream. Keeping a\r\ncautious lookout, we began to follow this road, slipping along through\r\nthe timber at its side.\r\n\r\nIn about five minutes we came to a coal mine on the slope beside\r\nthe highway. From the looks of its dump, it was being worked\r\nconstantly—probably furnishing the fuel to keep fire under the _Nippon’s_\r\nboilers.\r\n\r\nFifteen more minutes passed in laborious climbing over rocks and fallen\r\ntimber, when all at once, after ascending a slight rise to another\r\nlevel of the valley’s floor, we beheld the lights of a village a short\r\ndistance beyond! At once Dr. Gresham changed our course to take us up the\r\nmountainside, whence we could look down upon the settlement.\r\n\r\nTo my amazement, we saw a neatly laid out town of more than a hundred\r\nhouses, with electric-lighted streets. Although the houses seemed\r\nto be built entirely of corrugated sheet iron—probably because a\r\nmore substantial type of construction would not have withstood the\r\nearthquakes—there was about the place an indefinable Chinese atmosphere.\r\n\r\nMy first shock of surprise at coming across this hidden city soon gave\r\nway to wonder that the outside world knew nothing of such a place—that\r\nit was not even indicated on the maps. But I recalled that on the land\r\nside it was unapproachable because of lofty mountains, beyond which lay\r\nan immense trackless wilderness; and on the water side it was a hundred\r\nmiles off even the navigation lanes to Alaska.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as we stood there in the timber, a deep-toned bell began to\r\ntoll on the summit of the low mountain above us.\r\n\r\n“The Temple of the Moon God!” exclaimed Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\nWith the sounding of the bell, the village awakened into life. From\r\nnearly every house came figures clad in flaming orange costumes, exactly\r\nlike the ones Dr. Gresham and myself wore beneath our outer suits. At the\r\nend of the town these figures mingled and turned into a roadway, and a\r\nfew moments later we saw they were coming up the hill directly toward us!\r\n\r\nNot knowing which way they would pass, we crouched in the dark and waited.\r\n\r\nStill the weird, mellow tocsin sounded above us—slowly, mystically,\r\nflooding the valley with somber, thrilling sound.\r\n\r\nAll at once we heard the tramping of many feet, and then perceived with\r\nalarm that the roadway up the mountainside passed not more than twenty\r\nfeet from where we lay! Along it the silent, strange procession was\r\nmounting the slope!\r\n\r\n“The Seuen-H’sin,” whispered my companion, “on their way to the hellish\r\ntemple rites!”\r\n\r\nScarcely breathing, we pressed flat upon the ground, fearful each instant\r\nwe might be discovered. For a period that seemed interminable the\r\nbrilliantly-clad figures continued to shuffle by—hundreds of them. But at\r\nlast there was an end of the marchers.\r\n\r\nImmediately Dr. Gresham rose and, motioning me to follow his example,\r\nquickly slipped off his blue outer costume and rolled it into a small\r\nbundle, which he tucked under his arm. I was ready an instant later.\r\n\r\nCreeping out to the road, we peered about to make certain no stragglers\r\nwere approaching; then we hurried after the ascending throng. It was only\r\na few moments until we overtook the rear ranks, whereupon we adopted\r\ntheir gait and followed silently, apparently attracting no attention.\r\n\r\nThe mountain was not very high, and at last we came out upon a spacious\r\nlevel area at the top. It was moderately well illuminated by electric\r\nlamps, and at the eastern end, near the edge of the eminence, we beheld\r\na stone temple into which the multitude was passing. Depositing our rolls\r\nof outer clothing in a spot where we could easily find them again, we\r\nmoved forward.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the walled mountaintop, or temple courtyard it might be\r\ncalled, I swiftly took in the strange surroundings. The temple was a\r\nthing to marvel at. It was all of stone, with high, fantastically-carved\r\nwalls and an imposing facade of rounded columns. On either side of the\r\ncentral structure were wings, or side halls, that ran off into the\r\ndarkness; and in front of these were walled courtyards with arched\r\ngateways, roofed with golden-yellow tiles. The structure must have\r\nrequired engineering skill of the highest order for its building, yet it\r\nappeared old, incredibly old, as if the storms of centuries had beaten\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nEverywhere about the walls were cracks—doubtless the result of the\r\nearthquakes—so numerous and pronounced that one wondered how the building\r\nheld together.\r\n\r\nPresently, as we advanced, I noticed an overturned and broken statue of\r\nBuddha, the stone figure partly overgrown with moss and lichens. As I\r\nstudied this I recalled the bit of history Dr. Gresham had related to me\r\na couple of days before as we journeyed northward on the _Albatross_—of\r\nthe Chinese navigators, directed by Huei-Sen, a Buddhist monk, who had\r\ncome “somewhere to the north” in the year 499 A. D. And I wondered if\r\nthis was, indeed, the “Country of the Great Han” that was discovered by\r\nthese Orientals in the long ago—if this might be one of the temples which\r\nHuei-Sen and his followers had built in the days a thousand years before\r\nColumbus.\r\n\r\nI whispered these questions to the doctor.\r\n\r\nWith an alarmed glance about us to make sure I had not been overheard, he\r\nanswered very low:\r\n\r\n“You have guessed it! But keep silent, as you value your life! Stay close\r\nto me and do whatever the others do!”\r\n\r\nWe were now at the entrance to the temple. Heavy yellow curtains covered\r\nthe portal, and within a gong droned slowly.\r\n\r\nSummoning courage, we pushed aside the draperies and entered.\r\n\r\nThe place was large and dimly lighted. Low red seats ran crossways in\r\nlong rows. At the far end, against the east wall, was the altar, before\r\nwhich were drawn deep yellow hangings. In front of these, under a hood\r\nof golden gauze, burned a solitary light. There was a terror in this\r\nmysterious dusk that gave me a strange thrill.\r\n\r\nThe audience was standing, silent, with bowed heads, by the rows of\r\nseats. Quaking inwardly, we took places in the last row, where the light\r\nwas dimmest. So perfectly were our costumes and make-up a match for those\r\naround us that we attracted no attention.\r\n\r\nAll at once the tempo of the gong’s droning changed, becoming slower and\r\nmore weird, and other gongs joined in at intervals. The illumination,\r\nwhich appeared to come solely from the ceiling, brightened somewhat.\r\n\r\nThen a door opened on the right, about midway of the building, and there\r\nappeared a being such as I never beheld before. He was tall and lean and\r\nwore a robe of golden silk. Behind him came another—a priest in superb\r\nviolet; and behind him a third in flaming orange. They wore high helmets\r\nwith feathery plumes.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of each priest were peculiar instruments—or images, if\r\nso they might be called. Above a handle about two feet long, held\r\nvertically, was a thin rod curved upward in a semi-circle, at each end of\r\nwhich was a flat disk about a foot in diameter—one disk of silver, the\r\nother of gold. As I scrutinized these emblems I wondered if they were\r\nmeant to symbolize the Seuen-H’sin’s belief in two moons.\r\n\r\nSlowly the priests advanced to a central aisle, then forward to an open\r\nspace, or hall of prayer, before the altar.\r\n\r\nThen a door opened on the left, opposite the first portal, and from it\r\nissued a fourth priest in robes of richest purple, followed by another in\r\ncrimson, and still another in wondrous green. They, also, wore the high,\r\nfeathery helmets and carried the instruments with gold and silver disks.\r\n\r\nWhen the last three had joined the first trio, other portals opened\r\nalong the sides of the temple and half a dozen more priests entered and\r\nstrode forward. The brilliant colors of their frocks seemed a part of the\r\ndevilish gong-droning. In the dim vastness of the temple they moved on,\r\nsilent as ghosts. There was something singularly depressing in the slow,\r\nnoiseless steps. It was as if they were walking to their death.\r\n\r\nStill the procession grew in numbers. Hitherto unnoticed\r\nportals gave entrance to more yellow, orange and violet-clad\r\npriests—demoniacal-looking beings, with lean, cruel, thoughtful faces and\r\nsomber, dreaming eyes.\r\n\r\nAt last the procession ended. There was a pause, after which the\r\naudience standing among the rows of red seats burst into low murmurs of\r\nsupplication. Sometimes the voices rose into a considerable humming\r\nsound; again they sank into a whisper. Suddenly the murmur of voices\r\nceased and there was a blare of unseen trumpets—a crashing vastness of\r\nsound; harsh, unearthly, infernal, so that I shivered in horror. Nothing\r\ncould be seen of the terrible orchestra; its notes seemed to come from a\r\ndark adjoining hall.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a pause—a thrilling period in which even the droning\r\ngongs were hushed; and then from an unseen portal came, slowly and alone,\r\na figure that all the rest seemed to have been waiting for.\r\n\r\nLeaning close to my ear, Dr. Gresham whispered:\r\n\r\n“_The high priest, Kwo-Sung-tao!_”\r\n\r\nWith leaping interest, I turned to view the personage—and was held\r\nspellbound by the amazing personality of this man who proposed to make\r\nhimself emperor of all the world.\r\n\r\nHe was old, _old_; small, shrunken; a very mummy of a man; bald, and\r\nwith a long white mustache; enveloped in a shroud of cloth of gold,\r\nembroidered with crimson dragons and dual gold and silver moons. But\r\nnever to my dying day can I forget that face, with its fearful eyes! All\r\nthe wisdom and power and wickedness of the world were blended there!\r\n\r\nStraight toward the altar the old man walked, looking neither to the\r\nright nor the left; and when he had mounted the steps he paused before\r\nthe curtains and turned. As his blazing eyes swept the hall the entire\r\nmultitude seemed to shrink and shrivel. An awful, sepulchral silence fell\r\nupon the crowd. The stillness hovered like a living thing. A thrill more\r\nintense than I had ever felt came over me; it swept me on cold waves into\r\nan ocean of strange, pulsing emotion.\r\n\r\nThen, abruptly, a hundred cymbals clashed, subdued drums rolled forth,\r\nand the infernal trumpets that had heralded the entrance of the high\r\npriest crashed out a demoniacal peal—a veritable anthem of damnation that\r\npierced me to the marrow.\r\n\r\nThe sound died out. The lights, too, began to sink. For a few moments\r\nnot a word was spoken; there was the stillness of death, of the end of\r\nthings. Presently all the illumination was gone save the solitary hooded\r\nlight in front of the altar.\r\n\r\nFrom his place at the head of the steps the high priest, Kwo-Sung-tao,\r\nmade a gesture. Silently, and by unseen means, the deep yellow hangings\r\nrolled away.\r\n\r\nThere, to my amazement, the whole end of the temple was open, and we\r\ncould look off from the mountaintop across innumerable valleys to the\r\ngreat range of peaks that walled the east. Out there the stars were\r\nshining, and near the horizon the blue-green heavens were tinged with a\r\nswimming silver mist.\r\n\r\nThe altar itself, if such it might be called, was a single block of\r\nundraped stone, about three feet high and four feet long, rising in the\r\ncenter of the platform.\r\n\r\nHardly had I taken in the scene before two of the priests hurried\r\nforward, dragging between them a nearly-naked and half-swooning Chinaman.\r\nCarrying him up the steps, they flung him on his back upon the altar\r\nblock and swiftly fastened his hands and feet to manacles on the sides of\r\nthe stone, so that his naked chest was centered upon the pedestal. The\r\npriests then descended from the altar, leaving Kwo-Sung-tao alone beside\r\nthe prisoner.\r\n\r\nStill within the temple the profound silence reigned. There was not a\r\nwhisper, not a rustle of the silken vestments.\r\n\r\nBut all at once we noticed that the eastern sky was growing brighter.\r\n\r\nThen from before the altar a single somber bass rolled forth in a wailing\r\nprayer—a mystical, unearthly sound, coming in shattered sobs:\r\n\r\n“_Na-mo O-mi-t’o-fo! Na-mo O-mi-t’o-fo!_”\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from over the edge of the world, the moon began to rise!\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for another hellish blast from the trumpets, followed\r\nby the beginning of a steady humming of countless gongs. Other voices\r\njoined the quivering bass, together growing louder—seeming to complain\r\nand sob and wail like the voices of tortured demons in the abyss.\r\n\r\nThe rhythmic sounds swelled louder and louder, higher and higher, until\r\nthe orb of night had climbed clear of the wall of mountains.\r\n\r\nDirectly against the silver disk I now saw silhouetted the stone altar\r\nholding its shrinking prisoner, with the high priest standing close\r\nbeside him. The priest’s right arm was upraised, and in his hand there\r\ngleamed a knife.\r\n\r\nStill the music grew in volume—tremendous, stunning, a terrific battle of\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nAll at once the high priest’s knife flashed downward—straight and deep\r\ninto the breast of the quivering wretch upon the stone—and in a moment\r\nhis other hand was raised in salutation to the moon, and in it was\r\nclutched the dripping heart of the human sacrifice!\r\n\r\nAt the sight my limbs grew shaky and my senses swam.\r\n\r\nBut at this instant, like a blow upon the head, came a lightning-crash\r\nof cymbals, a smiting of great gongs, and a climacteric roar from those\r\nagonizing trumpets of hell. Then even the single altar light went out,\r\nplunging the great hall in darkness.\r\n\r\nInstantly I felt Dr. Gresham’s hand upon my arm, and, dazed and helpless,\r\nI was dragged out of the temple.\r\n\r\nOutside the air released me from my stupor, and I raced beside the\r\nscientist to the spot where we had left our outer garments. In the shadow\r\nof the wall we slipped these on, and then fled panic-stricken down the\r\nmountainside.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VIII._\r\n\r\nTHE JAWS OF DEATH\r\n\r\nWe did not pause in our flight from the temple until we reached the foot\r\nof the mountain; then, still shaken by the horror of the scene we had\r\nwitnessed, we sat down to rest until the climbing moon should send its\r\nlight into the depths of the gorge.\r\n\r\nWe could discern little of our surroundings, but close at hand we could\r\nhear the river rushing between its rocky walls.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken until finally I inquired: “What next?”\r\n\r\nIn a low voice that indicated the need of caution even here, Dr. Gresham\r\nannounced:\r\n\r\n“The real work of the night still is before us. I would not have taken\r\nthe risk of visiting the temple but for the hope that we would learn more\r\nof the Seuen-H’sin’s layout than we did. Since nothing was gained there,\r\nwe must reconnoiter the country.”\r\n\r\n“That sacrifice of human life,” I asked—“what was its purpose?”\r\n\r\n“To propitiate their god,” the astronomer told me. “Every month, on the\r\nnight of the full moon—in every Seuen-H’sin temple in the world—that\r\nhideous slaughter takes place. At certain times the ceremony is\r\nelaborated into a thing infinitely more horrible.”\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the moon lifted itself clear of the valley’s eastern\r\nrim, and the depression was bathed in silvery radiance. This was the\r\nsignal for our start.\r\n\r\nHeading toward the sound of the river, we soon came to the road that led\r\nto the _Nippon’s_ wharf. Beside this highway was an electric transmission\r\nline, running on up into the canyon. Turning away from the wharf and the\r\nvillage, we proceeded to follow this line toward its source.\r\n\r\nInstead of traversing the road, however, we kept in the shadows of the\r\ntimber at its side; and it was well that we did so, for we had not gone\r\nfar before a group of Chinamen appeared around a bend in the highway,\r\nwalking rapidly toward the town. They wore dark clothes of the same\r\npattern as our own outer garments; and they passed without seeing us.\r\n\r\nFor fully two miles we followed the power line, until we began to pass\r\nnumerous groups of Chinamen in close succession—like crowds of men\r\ngetting off work.\r\n\r\nTo diminish the chance of our being discovered, Dr. Gresham and I turned\r\nup the mountainside. We climbed until we had reached a considerable\r\nheight above the floor of the gorge, and then, keeping at this elevation,\r\nwe again pursued the course of the electric line.\r\n\r\nAnother half hour passed in this scramble along the steep slope, and my\r\ncompanion began to betray uneasiness lest the road and its paralleling\r\ncopper wires which we could not see from here, had ended or had turned\r\noff up some tributary ravine—when suddenly there came to our ears a\r\nfaint roaring, as of a distant waterfall. At once Dr. Gresham was all\r\nalertness, and with quickened steps we pressed forward in the direction\r\nof the sound.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, as we rounded a shoulder of the mountain, we were\r\nstricken suddenly speechless by the sight, far below us, of a great\r\nbrilliantly-lighted building!\r\n\r\nFor a few moments we could only stand and gaze at the thing; but\r\npresently, as the timber about us partially obstructed our view, we moved\r\nforward to a barren rocky promontory jutting out from the mountainside.\r\n\r\nThe moon now was well up in the heavens, and from the brow of this\r\nheadland a vast expanse of country was visible—its every feature standing\r\nout, almost as clearly as in the daylight. But, to take advantage of this\r\nview, we were obliged to expose ourselves to discovery by any spies the\r\nSeuen-H’sin might have posted in the region. The danger was considerable,\r\nbut our curiosity regarding the lighted building was sufficient to\r\noutweight our caution.\r\n\r\nThe structure was too far distant to reveal much to the naked eye, so we\r\nquickly brought our field glasses into use: then we saw that the building\r\nwas directly upon the bank of the river, and that from its lower wall\r\nspouted a number of large, foaming streams of water, as if discharged\r\nunder terrific pressure. From these torrents, presumably, came the sound\r\nof the waterfall. The angle at which we were looking down upon the place\r\nprevented our seeing inside the building except at one corner, where,\r\nthrough a window, we could catch a glimpse of machinery running.\r\n\r\nBut, little as we could see, it was enough to convince me that the place\r\nwas a hydro-electric plant of enormous proportions, producing energy to\r\nthe extent of probably hundreds of thousands of horsepower.\r\n\r\nEven as I was reaching this conclusion, Dr. Gresham spoke:\r\n\r\n“There,” he said, “is the source of the Seuen-H’sin’s power, which is\r\ncausing all these upheavals throughout the world! That is where the\r\nyellow devils are at work upon their second moon!”\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke another of the great ground shocks rocked the earth. Too\r\namazed for comment, I stood staring at the plant until my companion added:\r\n\r\n“There is where those brilliant flashes in the heavens came from last\r\nnight. They were due to some accident in the machinery, causing a short\r\ncircuit. For two nights I had been circling over this entire range of\r\nmountains in the hydroplane, in search of the sorcerers’ workshop. The\r\nflashes were a fortunate circumstance that led me to the place.”\r\n\r\n“At last I understand,” I remarked presently, “why you were so deeply\r\ninterested, back there in Washington, in the Steamship _Nippon_ and the\r\nelectric plant she was transporting to Hong-kong. I suppose that is where\r\nthe sorcerers obtained all this machinery!”\r\n\r\n“Precisely!” agreed the astronomer. “That morning in Washington, when\r\nI got you to look up the inventory of the _Nippon’s_ cargo, I had this\r\nsolution of the mystery in mind. I knew from my years in Wu-yang that\r\nelectricity was the force the sorcerers would employ, and I was certain I\r\nhad seen mention in the newspapers of some exceptionally large electrical\r\nequipment aboard the _Nippon_. Those supposed pirates of the Yellow Sea\r\nwere in reality the murderous hordes of the Seuen-H’sin, who had come out\r\nto the coast after this outfit.”\r\n\r\n“But why,” I asked, “should these Chinamen, whose development of science\r\nis so far in advance of our own, have to get machinery from an inferior\r\npeople? I should think their own appliances would have made anything from\r\nthe rest of the world seem antiquated.”\r\n\r\n“You forget what I told you that first night we spoke of the Seuen-H’sin.\r\nTheir discoveries never were backed up by manufacturing; they possessed\r\nno raw materials or factories or industrial instincts. They did not need\r\nto make machinery themselves. In spite of their tremendous isolation,\r\nthey were watching everything in the outside world. They knew they could\r\nget plenty of machinery ready made—once they had perfected their method\r\nof operations.”\r\n\r\nI was still staring at the monster power plant below us when Dr. Gresham\r\nannounced:\r\n\r\n“I know now that my theory of the earthquakes’ origin was correct, and if\r\nwe get safely back to the _Albatross_ the defeat of the sorcerers’ plans\r\nis assured.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me one thing more,” I put in. “Why did the Chinamen come so far\r\nfrom their own country to establish their plant?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” the doctor replied, “this place was so hidden—yet so easy to\r\nreach. And the further they came from their own country to apply their\r\nelectric impulses to the earth, the less danger their native land would\r\nrun.”\r\n\r\n“Still, for my part, the main point of the whole problem remains\r\nunsolved,” I asserted. “How do the sorcerers use this electricity to\r\nshake the world?”\r\n\r\n“That,” replied the scientist, “requires too long an explanation for\r\nthe present moment. On the way back to the ship I will tell you the\r\nwhole thing. But now I must get a closer view of Kwo-Sung-tao’s strange\r\nworkshop.”\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Gresham was speaking, some unexplained feeling of\r\nuneasiness—perhaps some faint sound that had registered itself upon my\r\nsubconscious thoughts without my ears being aware of it—led my gaze to\r\nwander over the mountainside in our vicinity. As my eyes rested for\r\na moment upon some rocks about a hundred yards away, I fancied I saw\r\nsomething stir at the side of them.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dr. Gresham made a move to leave the promontory. Laying a\r\ndetaining hand swiftly upon his arm, I whispered:\r\n\r\n“_Wait! Stand still!_”\r\n\r\nUnquestioningly the astronomer obeyed; and for a couple of minutes I\r\nwatched the neighboring clump of rocks out of the corner of my eye.\r\nPresently I saw a darkly-clad figure crawl out of the shadow of the\r\npile, cross a patch of moonlight, and join two other figures at the edge\r\nof the timber. The trio stood looking in our direction a moment, while\r\napparently holding a whispered conference. Then all three disappeared\r\ninto the shadow of the woods.\r\n\r\nImmediately I announced to my companion:\r\n\r\n“We have been discovered! There are three Chinamen watching us from the\r\ntimber, not a hundred yards away!”\r\n\r\nThe scientist was silent a moment. Then:\r\n\r\n“Do they know you saw them?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” I replied.\r\n\r\nStill without looking around, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Where are they—directly behind us?”\r\n\r\n“No; well to the side—the side nearest the power plant.”\r\n\r\n“Good! Then we’ll move back toward the timber at once—go leisurely, as if\r\nwe suspected nothing. If we reach the cover of the woods all right, we’ll\r\nmake a dash for it. Head straight up for the top of the ridge—cross over\r\nand descend into the gulch on the other side—then detour back toward the\r\n_Albatross_. Stick to the shadows—travel as fast as we can—and try to\r\nthrow off pursuit!”\r\n\r\nMoving off as unconsciously as if we were totally unaware that we had\r\nbeen observed, we struck out for the timber—all the time keeping a sharp\r\nlookout, for we half expected the spies to head us off and attempt a\r\nsurprise attack. But we reached the darkness of the woods without even a\r\nglimpse of the Celestials; and instantly we broke into a run.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was too steep to permit much speed; moreover, the roughness\r\nof the ground and the down-timber hampered us greatly—yet we had the\r\nconsolation of knowing that it equally hampered our pursuers.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour we pressed on. The mountaintop was crossed, and we\r\ndescended into a canyon on the other side. No sight or sound of the\r\nChinamen had greeted us. Could they have surmised the course we would\r\ntake, and calmly let us proceed, while they returned for reinforcements\r\nto head us off? Or were they silently stalking us to find out who we were\r\nand whence we came? We could not tell. And there was the other chance,\r\ntoo, that we had shaken off pursuit.\r\n\r\nGradually this latter possibility became a definite hope, which grew as\r\nour overtaxed strength began to fail. Nevertheless, we pushed on until we\r\nwere so spent and winded that we could scarcely drag one foot after the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached a spot where the floor of the canyon widened out into\r\na tiny level park. Here the timber was so dense that we were swallowed up\r\nin almost complete darkness; and in this protecting mantle of shadow we\r\ndecided to stop for a brief rest. Stretching out upon the ground, with\r\nour arms extended at our sides, we lay silent, inhaling deep breaths of\r\nthe cool, refreshing mountain air.\r\n\r\nWe were now on the opposite side of a long and high mountain ridge from\r\nthe Chinese village, and, as nearly as we could estimate, not more than a\r\nmile or two from the _Albatross_.\r\n\r\nLying there on the ground, we could feel the earthquakes with startling\r\nviolence. We noticed that they no longer occurred only at intervals of\r\neleven minutes and a fraction—although they were particularly severe at\r\nthose periods—but that they kept up an almost continuous quivering, as if\r\nthe globe’s internal forces were bubbling restlessly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the wake of one of the heavier shocks of the eleven-minute\r\nperiod, the intense stillness was broken by a sharp report, followed by\r\na ripping sound from the bowels of the earth, that seemed to start close\r\nat hand and rush off into the distance, quickly dying out. From the\r\nmountainside above us came the crash of a falling tree and the clatter of\r\na few dislodged rocks bounding down the slope. The earth swayed as if a\r\ngiant gash had opened and closed within a few rods of us.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence made Dr. Gresham and myself sit up instantly. Nothing,\r\nhowever, was visible through the forest gloom of any changes in the\r\nlandscape. Again silence settled about us.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes passed.\r\n\r\nThen abruptly, from a short distance away, came the sound of something\r\nstirring. Sitting motionless, alert, we listened. Almost immediately we\r\nheard it again, and this time the sound did not die out. Something off\r\nthere in the timber was moving stealthily toward us!\r\n\r\nDropping back at full length upon the ground, with only our heads raised,\r\nwe kept a sharp watch.\r\n\r\nOnly a few more moments were we kept in suspense; then, across a slit\r\nof moonlight, we saw five Chinamen swiftly moving. They were slinking\r\nalong almost noiselessly, as if following a scent—and, with a shock, we\r\nrealized that it was ourselves they were tracking! We had not shaken off\r\nour pursuers, after all!\r\n\r\nEven before we could decide, in a whispered debate, what our next move\r\nshould be, our nerves again were whipped taut by other sounds close at\r\nhand—but now on the opposite side of the little valley from the first\r\nones. This time the sounds grew fainter—only to become louder again\r\nalmost immediately, as if the intruders were searching back and forth\r\nacross the flat. In a short while it became plain that they were drawing\r\ncloser to us.\r\n\r\n“What fools we were to stop to rest!” the astronomer complained.\r\n\r\n“I have a hunch we would have run into some of those spies if we had\r\nkept on,” I rejoined. “They must have headed us off and found that we\r\ndidn’t pass on down this canyon, else they wouldn’t be searching here so\r\nthoroughly.”\r\n\r\n“Right!” my friend agreed. “And now they’ve got us in a tight place!”\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” I suggested, “we slip across the valley and climb part way\r\nup that other mountainside—then try to work along through the timber up\r\nthere until we’re near the ship?”\r\n\r\n“Good!” he assented. “Come on!”\r\n\r\nLying at full length upon the ground and wriggling along like snakes, we\r\nheaded between two groups of the searchers. It was slow work, but we did\r\nnot dare even to rise to our knees to crawl. Twice we dimly made out, not\r\nfifty feet away, some of the Chinamen slinking along, apparently hunting\r\nover every foot of the region. We could not tell how many of them there\r\nwere now.\r\n\r\nAfter a time that seemed nearly endless we reached the edge of the flat.\r\nHere we rose to our feet to tackle the slope in front of us.\r\n\r\nAs we did so, two figures leaped out of the gloom close at hand and split\r\nthe night with cries of “_Fan kuei! Fan kuei!_” (“Foreign devils!”)\r\n\r\nThen they sprang to seize us.\r\n\r\nFurther concealment being impossible, we darted back into the valley, no\r\nlonger avoiding the patches of moonlight, but rather seeking them, so we\r\ncould see where we were going. We were heading for the fiord.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds other cries arose on all sides of us. It seemed we were\r\nsurrounded and that the whole region swarmed with Chinamen. Dark forms\r\nbegan to plunge out of the woods ahead to intercept us; the leading ones\r\nwere not sixty feet away.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to fight for it!” called Dr. Gresham. And our hands flew to\r\nour revolvers.\r\n\r\nBut before we could draw the weapons a great ripping and crashing sound\r\nburst forth upon the mountainside above us—the terrifying noise of rocks\r\nsplitting and grinding—an appalling turmoil! Terrified, pursued and\r\npursuers alike paused to glance upward.\r\n\r\nThere, in the brilliant moonlight, we saw a monster avalanche sweeping\r\ndownward, engulfing everything in its way!\r\n\r\nAbandoning the astronomer and myself, the Chinamen turned to flee further\r\nfrom the path of the landslide—and we all began running together down the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nOnly a few steps had we gone, however, when above the roaring of the\r\navalanche a new sound rang out—short, sharp, booming, like the report of\r\na giant gun.\r\n\r\nAs I glanced about through the blotches of moonlight and shadow, I saw\r\nseveral of the sorcerers just ahead suddenly halt, stagger and then drop\r\nfrom sight.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham and I stopped instantly, but not before we beheld other\r\nChinamen disappearing from view.\r\n\r\n_The earth had opened and they were falling in!_\r\n\r\nEven as we stood there, hesitating, the black maw yawned wider—to our\r\nvery feet—and with cries of horror we tried to stagger back. But we\r\nwere too late. The sides of the crack were crumbling in, and in another\r\ninstant the widening gash overtook us.\r\n\r\nAs his eyes met mine, I saw the astronomer topple backward and disappear.\r\n\r\nA second later the ground gave way beneath my own feet and I was plunged\r\ninto the blackness of the pit.\r\n\r\n_This extraordinary novel will be concluded in the June issue of WEIRD\r\nTALES._\r\n\r\n_Tell your newsdealer to reserve a copy for you._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET FEAR\r\n\r\n_A “Creepy” Detective Story_\r\n\r\nBy KENNETH DUANE WHIPPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was hot and breathless, as had been the day, and the humid\r\n_tang_ of the salt air smote my nostrils as, envying Martin his vacation\r\nrespite from the grind of police reporting, I turned off the broad, paved\r\nthoroughfare of Washington Avenue and started down Wharf Street, narrow\r\nand dimly lighted, toward my lodgings beyond the bridge.\r\n\r\nAs I passed the second dirty-globed street light I halted suddenly, with\r\nthe staccato sound of hurrying footsteps in my ears. Homeward bound from\r\nthe Journal office, where Martin’s work had kept me until after midnight,\r\nI had yielded to the temptation offered by the short cut. Now, with the\r\npeculiar emphatic insistence of the footfalls behind me, I began to\r\nwonder if I had chosen wisely.\r\n\r\nBrass buttons, glinting dully under the corner arc, reassured me. The\r\nnext instant I was roughly ordered to halt. I recognized the hoarse,\r\npanting voice of Patrolman Tom Kenton of the fourth precinct, whose beat,\r\nas I knew, lay along the wharves.\r\n\r\n“It’s me, Kenton—Jack Bowers, of the _Journal_,” I said. “What’s doing?”\r\n\r\nKenton peered at me keenly in the bad light. Then his face relaxed.\r\n\r\n“Man killed in Kellogg’s warehouse, just around the corner there,” he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“Killed? How?”\r\n\r\n“The sergeant didn’t say. I got it from him just now when I reported.\r\nSomeone ’phoned in a minute ago. Come along and see, if you want. It’s\r\nright in your line, and you’re a good friend of the captain’s.”\r\n\r\nI fell into step with him, finding some difficulty in keeping pace.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who ’phoned?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No. May be a joke. May be a frame-up. May be anything.”\r\n\r\nHis deep voice rumbled through the gloom of the dingy street, deserted\r\nsave for our hurrying figures. We crossed to the opposite side, passing\r\nbeneath a blue arc which flamed and sputtered naked through a jagged gash\r\nin its dirty, frosted globe.\r\n\r\nJust around the corner loomed the ramshackle bulk of Kellogg’s warehouse,\r\na four-story, wooden structure squatting above the river piers. On the\r\nground floor a broad entrance gaped blackly. At the left of the doorway,\r\nabout three feet above street level, the end of a loading platform jutted\r\nout of the darkness.\r\n\r\nBeyond the warehouse a narrow pier ran out toward midstream. I caught a\r\nglimpse of the riding lights of some small vessel, dimly outlined against\r\nthe gray-black of the oily water.\r\n\r\nKenton stopped at the corner of the warehouse to draw his revolver,\r\nmotioning me to remain where I was.\r\n\r\n“Stay here,” he said under his breath. “I’ll take a look. If it’s a\r\nframe-up there’s no need to get anyone else into it. Besides, you’d be\r\nmore help here.”\r\n\r\nHe squared his broad shoulders and was swallowed up by the oblong of\r\nblack. It did not require much urging to persuade me to stay outside.\r\nTimidly I peeped through a crack in the warped boarding. The dim ray\r\nof light which Kenton cast before him seemed only to accentuate the\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nThe light became stationary. I could distinguish Kenton bending over\r\nsomething on the dirt floor not fifteen feet inside the entrance. He\r\nlooked up and spoke softly.\r\n\r\n“Come ahead, Mr. Bowers,” he said. “No joke about this.”\r\n\r\nThere was a grim edge to his tone. With a shiver, I stepped through the\r\ndoorway and crossed to where he crouched above a motionless shape huddled\r\nagainst the side of the long loading platform.\r\n\r\nThe body was that of a man of large stature—more than six feet in height,\r\nas nearly as I could judge from the cramped position in which he lay.\r\nThere were no visible marks of violence, except for a frayed linen collar\r\npulled awry, which dangled by a single buttonhole from the shirt about\r\nthe powerful, corded neck. But as I bent closer to look at the features,\r\nI drew back with a gasp.\r\n\r\nThe face of the dead man was distorted by an expression of the utmost\r\nhorror and loathing. Around the dilated pupils of his large, bluish-gray\r\neyes, the ghastly whites showed in a pallid rim of fear. His irregular,\r\nreddish features, even in death, seemed fairly to writhe with terror. One\r\nlong, sinewy arm was thrown up across the lower part of his face, as if\r\nto ward off some unseen and terrible menace.\r\n\r\nShuddering, I stared across the body at Kenton’s homely, impassive face.\r\n\r\n“In heaven’s name, what happened to him?” I asked.\r\n\r\nKenton’s hands had been moving swiftly over the body. Now he spread them\r\napart in a little puzzled gesture.\r\n\r\n“There doesn’t seem to be any wound,” he said. “See if there isn’t a\r\nswitch around somewhere, Mr. Bowers. There ought to be a way of lighting\r\nup here.”\r\n\r\nI fumbled along the wall until my fingers encountered the round porcelain\r\nknob. A single grimy bulb, pendant from a cobwebbed rafter, threw a dim\r\ncircle of grewsome yellow light upon the floor of the warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe body had lain on its left side, facing the doorway. Kenton\r\nmethodically turned the corpse upon its face, his searching fingers\r\nexploring the back. To me, at least, it was a relief that the staring,\r\nterrified eyes were hidden from view, rather than gazing fearfully\r\nthrough the arch of the doorway into the narrow, empty street beyond.\r\n\r\n“There’s something queer about this,” said Kenton. “No wound at all, Mr.\r\nBowers, that I can find. No blood—not even a bruise, only this mark at\r\nthe throat.”\r\n\r\nI had not seen the mark before, and even now I had to look closely to\r\nfind it. It was scarcely more than a discoloration of the skin in a broad\r\nband beneath the chin. But there was no abrasion, much less a wound\r\nsufficient to cause the death of a powerful man like the one who lay\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nWith a shrug of his shoulders, Kenton rolled the body back to its\r\noriginal position. At once the ghastly eyes renewed their unwinking stare\r\nat the empty street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA sound from the doorway caused us both to turn. Only Kenton himself can\r\nsay what his imagination pictured there. For my part, I owned a feeling\r\nof distinct relief at sight of nothing more startling than a pair of\r\nragged-looking men peering in at the open door.\r\n\r\nAs we looked, a third derelict of the wharves joined them, pressing\r\ninquisitively forward toward the body on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Whassa trouble here?” asked one, curiously. “Somebody croak a guy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Kenton tersely. “Know him, any of you?”\r\n\r\nHis companion, who had been staring at the body, suddenly spoke in a\r\nstartled tone:\r\n\r\n“By gorry, it’s Terence McFadden! I’d never have known the boy with that\r\nlook on his face, except for the scar over his right eye. Look, Jim!\r\nSure, and he looks as if the divil was after him!”\r\n\r\nA confirmatory murmur came from the others. The grind of a street car’s\r\nwheels on the curve of Washington Avenue cut clearly across the low\r\nlapping of the waves against the rotting piles outside the warehouse.\r\nThe humid air, impregnated with the foul odors of the waterfront, was\r\nstifling.\r\n\r\nThe three men huddled closer, with fearful glances over their shoulders,\r\nas if striving to glimpse that which the eyes of the dead man watched.\r\nKenton alone seemed unaffected by the tension.\r\n\r\n“Know where he lives?”\r\n\r\n“Over on Twenty-fourth Street,” volunteered the third man. “But he’d\r\nbeen on the Tiger yonder this evening. I saw him go aboard. Why not call\r\nCaptain Dolan? Him and Terry was pals.”\r\n\r\n“What’s his name?”\r\n\r\n“Dolan—Captain Ira Dolan.”\r\n\r\n“Go and get him,” ordered Kenton, removing his cap and mopping his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThe man, not unwillingly, passed out of the circle of light. We heard his\r\nfootsteps on the planking of the pier, and his hail to the ship anchored\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nKenton turned to me, a worried look on his face.\r\n\r\n“Would you mind going down to Patton’s place on the corner and ’phoning\r\nin, Mr. Bowers?” he asked. “I wouldn’t ask it, but the captain knows you\r\nwell. Tell him I’m staying with the body. And ask him to have Doctor\r\nPotts come, if he’s there. I’d like to get to the bottom of this.”\r\n\r\nI was only too glad to get out of the warehouse, for the eerie atmosphere\r\nwas beginning to get on my nerves. When I returned, two of the somnolent\r\nloafers from Patton’s greasy lunch room, roused by my telephone message\r\nto Captain Watters of the fourth precinct, followed in my wake, muttering\r\nand rubbing their bleared eyes.\r\n\r\nLess than ten minutes had passed since we had found the dead man in\r\nKellogg’s old warehouse. Yet now a dozen frowsy wharf-rats fringed the\r\ndoorway, brought thither by some mysterious telepathic message borne on\r\nthe murky night air.\r\n\r\n“Be here in ten minutes,” I said, nodding to Kenton.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a man made his way through the crowd and hastened toward us.\r\nHis rugged, weather-beaten face took deeper lines from the dim light\r\noverhead, its high lights gleaming in the ghastly radiance like pieces\r\nof yellowed parchment. Yet there was power in the piercing blue eye, and\r\nstrength in every line of the tall, gaunt figure, now stooping suddenly\r\nover the body of the dead man.\r\n\r\n“Terence!” he cried, his voice harsh with grief. “Terence, lad!”\r\n\r\nKenton bent over and touched him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Are you Captain Dolan?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked up, one hand still resting upon the motionless body\r\nbeside which he knelt.\r\n\r\n“I am,” he said simply.\r\n\r\n“I understand this man—Terence McFadden, his name is?—”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan nodded.\r\n\r\n“I understand he was on board your ship tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Captain Dolan, rising to his feet.\r\n\r\n“What time did he leave?”\r\n\r\n“’Twas not more than half an hour ago, officer. Shortly after midnight,\r\nI would say. He was just aboard for a little farewell banquet,\r\ny’understand—just a friendly visit, eating and drinking and the like,\r\nbefore I leave at daybreak for another trip. I’m going down the coast.”\r\n\r\nKenton shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Never mind that. Have you any idea how he met his death? Had he any\r\nenemies that you know?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan ran his bony fingers through his grizzled locks, his eyes\r\nstill on the body of his friend.\r\n\r\n“Enemies he had aplenty, officer, like any two-fisted man with the\r\ndisposition of Terence McFadden. ’Twas only last week he cleaned up two\r\nof the Jerry Kramer gang that tried to hold him up with a pistol down\r\non this very street. But his worry tonight had nothing to do with them.\r\nA man like Terence could take care of himself against any man. Truth to\r\ntell, he was his own worst enemy.”\r\n\r\nKenton broke in sharply.\r\n\r\n“What’s that? He was worried tonight, you say?”\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a trace of evasion in Captain Dolan’s manner.\r\n\r\n“It was a piece he read in the paper. It fair spoiled his supper for him.”\r\n\r\n“What was it about?”\r\n\r\n“It was an item from the Zoo,” replied Captain Dolan.\r\n\r\nKenton fingered a button puzzledly, casting a mystified glance at me. It\r\nwas evident that his inquiries were not getting him anywhere.\r\n\r\nBefore he could question Captain Dolan further, the group about the\r\ndoorway behind us was thrust roughly aside, and Patrolman Corcoran, the\r\nnew officer from the adjacent beat, shouldered his way in. His right\r\nhand was twisted in the lapels of a short, squat foreigner with a\r\nswarthy face half hidden by a coarse, reddish-brown beard. The neck of\r\nhis sweat-soaked undershirt was open, and his sleeves were rolled above\r\nhairy, muscular forearms.\r\n\r\nCorcoran stared at the group about the lifeless body of Terence McFadden.\r\n\r\n“So it’s true, is it?” he curiously asked. “I thought ‘Big Jim’ here was\r\ntrying to give me a wrong steer.”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked Kenton.\r\n\r\n“Dobrowski, or some such name—‘Big Jim,’ they call him. He’s one of the\r\nKramer gang, they say.”\r\n\r\n“Where’d you get him?”\r\n\r\n“Caught him coming out of a basement over on Efton Street. He took one\r\nlook at me and ran like hell. So I rounded him up and asked him what was\r\nthe big idea of running. He just looked dumb, but I knew he’d been up to\r\nsomething. So I frisked him, and found—these!”\r\n\r\nHe pulled a watch and purse from the side pocket of his coat. Captain\r\nDolan leaned forward eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Terence’s!” he cried. “See if his initials are not in the back!”\r\n\r\nHe fairly snatched the watch from Corcoran’s hand. The younger patrolman\r\nturned to Kenton.\r\n\r\n“Who’s the old bird, anyway?” he asked in an undertone.\r\n\r\nKenton established the captain’s connection with the affair in a few\r\nwords. In the meantime the old man had pried open the gold case with his\r\nheavy thumbnail and was squinting inside.\r\n\r\n“See!” he affirmed, pointing to the initials “_T. J. M._” engraved there.\r\n\r\nCorcoran nodded carelessly.\r\n\r\n“‘Big Jim,’ all right,” he said decisively. “He’s the man that killed\r\nMcFadden here.”\r\n\r\n“Big Jim” stared at his captor, chewing vigorously.\r\n\r\n“No kill!” he exclaimed. “No kill!”\r\n\r\nKenton had been frowning perplexedly. Now he turned to Corcoran.\r\n\r\n“Say, Bill,” he demanded, “how did you get over here, anyhow? Who told\r\nyou there’d been a man killed?”\r\n\r\nTo our utter amazement, Corcoran jerked his thumb toward “Big Jim.”\r\n\r\n“He did,” he said.\r\n\r\n“_He_ did?” repeated Kenton incredulously. “Then you were the one that\r\n’phoned in to the sergeant?”\r\n\r\nCorcoran nodded, taking a tighter grip on the captive’s lapels.\r\n\r\n“I was going to call the wagon and go straight in with ‘Big Jim’ here.\r\nThen he told such a funny story that I thought maybe he was trying to\r\nstring me, so I marched him over here to make sure.”\r\n\r\nKenton shook his head.\r\n\r\n“That was no way to go,” he muttered under his breath. “Well, no matter.\r\nWhat does he say?”\r\n\r\n“Says he took this stuff away from McFadden, but didn’t kill him,”\r\nsneered Corcoran. “Doesn’t know who killed him, but he didn’t. Fishy?\r\nWell, I’ll tell the world!”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan again bent over the body of Terence McFadden. Then he\r\nlooked up at “Big Jim.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us what happened,” he commanded.\r\n\r\nWords popped turbulently from “Big Jim.” Either he was actually telling\r\nthe truth, or he had committed his story to heart.\r\n\r\n“No Kill!” he vociferated, gesticulating. “No kill! Take watch, but no\r\nkill! Hide for man—pull him in—fight—he dead! Take money—run—hide—”\r\n\r\nFear shone in his shifting eyes and on his swarthy, perspiring face. As\r\nhe glanced nervously about the building, the fantastic idea occurred to\r\nme that his fear was less of the police than of some unseen, intangible\r\nforce beyond his comprehension. I caught myself looking apprehensively\r\nover my own shoulder.\r\n\r\nCorcoran spat on the floor disgustedly.\r\n\r\n“Part of that yarn’s all right,” he said. “That part about his stealing\r\nthe watch and all, I mean. The rest is all bull. How would he get the\r\nstuff off a big guy like that without croaking him? How did he kill him,\r\nanyway?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan leaned forward, his eyes gleaming.\r\n\r\n“Yes, officer,” he repeated. “How did he kill him? Tell us that if you\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\nCorcoran thrust his captive toward Kenton and knelt beside the body. When\r\nhe looked up, his face was blank. Rising he turned savagely on “Big Jim.”\r\n\r\n“Come, now!” he ordered roughly, shaking the foreigner by the shoulder.\r\n“How did you kill him? Speak up!”\r\n\r\n“No kill!” repeated “Big Jim” stubbornly. “No kill!”\r\n\r\nCorcoran raised his club menacingly. Whether he would have struck “Big\r\nJim,” or merely wished to intimidate him, I do not know; he had not been\r\nlong on the force, and he felt his authority keenly. But Captain Dolan\r\nstepped forward, holding out an imperative hand.\r\n\r\n“One moment, officer!” he said sternly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a breathless instant the tableau held. Then Corcoran, closing his\r\namazed mouth, thrust his flushed face close to Captain Dolan’s.\r\n\r\n“What business have you got butting in on this, anyway?” he shouted.\r\n“Who told you to give orders? You seem to have been a friend of this\r\nfellow’s, by what Tom here says. But how do we know you didn’t have a\r\ngrudge against him and doped him tonight aboard your boat? How do we know\r\nyou didn’t give him wood alcohol or something to drink that put him down\r\nand out? You’d better just keep quiet and stick around here till the doc\r\ntakes a look at him.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan’s wrinkled, parchment-like face turned an angry red, and\r\nhis bony hands clenched. Then, suddenly, he relaxed, uttering a short,\r\nmirthless laugh.\r\n\r\n“In remaining here, as you request,” he replied, “’tis my idea to see\r\njustice done. Little love as Terence had for Jerry Kramer and his gang,\r\nhe would wish fair play, even for ‘Big Jim’ there. And for that reason\r\nI’ll be asking your kind indulgence while I tell you a little of Terence\r\nMcFadden.”\r\n\r\nCorcoran glared at the old man. Kenton shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Go ahead,” he said. “We’ve got to wait for the car.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan stood erect beneath the grimy electric bulb, which cast\r\na brassy gleam upon his grizzled locks. At his left stood Corcoran,\r\nscowling, one hand gripping his subdued prisoner. Beyond him Kenton\r\nleaned against the loading platform. I watched them from the shadows.\r\n\r\n“Every man of us has his secret fear,” began Captain Dolan abruptly, and\r\na trifle oratorically. “With one it’s the open sea. With another it’s a\r\nhorror of great heights. But we all have it. As for Terence McFadden, it\r\ntook no more than a little, long-tailed, hand-organ monkey to set him\r\na-shivering.\r\n\r\n“And they seemed to know it, too, the grinning devils. No sooner would\r\nhe pass a Dago organ-grinder on the corner than the little red-capped\r\nape would let out a chatter and make a rush for Terence. And would you\r\nbelieve me, the man would actually turn pale.\r\n\r\n“‘Come away, Ira,’ he’d say, clutching at me, ‘come away, Ira. Sure, and\r\nhe’ll be looking for a bite from the leg of ye.’\r\n\r\n“I mind me of a day when we went to the Zoo, Terence and I. ‘’Tis\r\nunderstood,’ says he, when we reached the gates, ‘that we make no visit\r\nto the monkey house.’\r\n\r\n“But I give him the laugh, with hints about his courage, d’ye mind, till\r\nat last he sets his teeth determined-like.\r\n\r\n“‘No man shall say Terence McFadden is a coward,’ says he. ‘Let us go in.’\r\n\r\n“The minute we enter the room, the place is in an uproar. The little\r\nyellow-haired monkeys are hanging by their tails and chattering, and even\r\nthe big apes down in the corner are roaring like devils let loose. ’Tis\r\nno use for me to point out to Terence that the hour for feeding is at\r\nhand. He will have none of it.\r\n\r\n“‘The beasts know me,’ he mutters between chattering teeth. ‘’Tis my\r\nblood they would be having.’\r\n\r\n“‘For why would they be having your blood?’ I asks.\r\n\r\n“‘I know not the why of it,’ says he, shaking in every limb, ‘but ’tis\r\nso.’\r\n\r\n“‘Rubbish!’ says I, for I wished to rid him of this foolish fear of his.\r\n‘Walk with me to this cage, and look the big chap in the eye. There’s no\r\nharm he can be doing to you, and him safe behind the bars!’\r\n\r\n“Terence was fair sweating with fear, but he grits his teeth, and arm in\r\narm we walk over to the cage. The big tawny fellow—the ugly-faced one by\r\nthe far door—sits there humped up in his corner, glowering at us with\r\neyes like coals.\r\n\r\n“‘Look, man,’ says I, ‘and give over your foolishness. Why, even in the\r\nopen ye’d be a match for him.’\r\n\r\n“No sooner are the words out of my mouth than the beast makes one jump\r\nfrom his corner and lands half way up the bars at the front of the cage,\r\nwith a roar that would blast the very soul of ye. I own I was startled,\r\nlittle as I fear monkeys and their likes.\r\n\r\n“But poor Terence gives a sort of gasp and leans against me, actually\r\nparalyzed with fear. His eyes are set in a glassy stare, like a dead\r\nman’s. And I swear to you that after I got him outside, it was half an\r\nhour before the color came back to his cheeks and his knees gave over\r\ntheir quivering.\r\n\r\n“‘Did ye see the horrible face of him?’ he gasps. ‘And the long arms\r\nreachin’ for me throat?’\r\n\r\n“And then he’d fall to trembling again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan paused as abruptly as he had begun. So vividly had he told\r\nhis story that he had been for the moment transported bodily to the\r\nmonkey house at the Zoo. Now, in the sudden silence, we moved uneasily,\r\nglancing at one another.\r\n\r\nCorcoran scratched his head in a puzzled manner.\r\n\r\n“What’s all this got to do with finding the murderer?” he burst out.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan shook his head.\r\n\r\n“There is no murderer,” he said.\r\n\r\nWe all looked startled, I imagine. Kenton would have spoken, but Captain\r\nDolan motioned him to silence. Even Corcoran, for once, found himself\r\nwithout words.\r\n\r\n“I spoke of an item in the paper tonight,” continued Captain Dolan.\r\n“Doubtless ’twas seen by all of you. Did you not read that one of the\r\ngorillas at the Zoo had escaped from its cage and was at large in the\r\ncity?”\r\n\r\nIn the breathless silence which ensued I felt a peculiar thrill of terror\r\npass up my spine. Kenton was fingering the holster of his revolver\r\nwith nervous, clumsy motions. In some uncanny manner the gaunt old\r\nsea-captain’s grim words of doubtful import had woven about us all a web\r\nof superstitious fear in which we vainly struggled, unable to grasp the\r\nsaving clew.\r\n\r\n“’Twas that item which spoiled his supper for Terence, when he read it\r\naboard the ship tonight. And no use I found it to reason with him. To his\r\nmind the grinning face of the big ape was peeping in at every porthole!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Corcoran whirled, peering into the blackness at the far end\r\nof the warehouse, where something stirred softly. Kenton drew his\r\npistol. I felt the goose-flesh rising along my arms. Only the dead man,\r\nundisturbed, stared unwinkingly in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe next moment a stray cat wandered leisurely into the circle of light\r\nand sat herself down to wash her dusty fur, blinking complacently up at\r\nour pallid faces. I wiped the cold drops from my forehead and breathed a\r\ndeep sigh.\r\n\r\nCorcoran turned almost pleadingly to Captain Dolan.\r\n\r\n“The gorilla—” he said. “Was it the gorilla from the Zoo that killed\r\nTerence McFadden?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I would not say that,” he answered.\r\n\r\nI stared at the parchment-like face in amazement. Like Corcoran, I had\r\njumped to this conclusion. Kenton drew his hand across his forehead in\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n“But you said there was no murder!” cried Corcoran. “Was it ‘Big Jim’\r\nthat killed him, after all?”\r\n\r\n“I would not say that,” repeated Captain Dolan.\r\n\r\nCorcoran looked at the old man dazedly. Then he spoke very softly and\r\nsoothingly, as one might interrogate a backward child:\r\n\r\n“Then tell me, Captain Dolan,” he said. “How did Terence McFadden die?”\r\n\r\n“He was murdered,” replied Captain Dolan.\r\n\r\nCorcoran stared.\r\n\r\n“Murdered? But you said there was no murderer!”\r\n\r\n“Nor was there,” said the captain.\r\n\r\nCorcoran dropped his hands helplessly. Kenton took up the interrogation.\r\n\r\n“Did he kill himself?” he demanded. “Was it suicide?”\r\n\r\n“I would not say that,” repeated Captain Dolan for the third time.\r\n\r\nBut Kenton was not to be baffled.\r\n\r\n“With what weapon was the man killed?” he asked doggedly.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan gazed at the contorted face of the man at his feet.\r\n\r\n“With one of the oldest weapons in the world,” he answered. “A weapon\r\nwhich has caused the death of many a brave man—aye, braver and more\r\npowerful than Terence here.”\r\n\r\nThe waves lapped saltily against the rotting piles at the far end of the\r\nwarehouse. In the darkness a rat squeaked, and the cat, interrupting its\r\ntoilet, darted out of the circle of light and vanished. In the darkness\r\nwas heard the sound of a speeding motor.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dolan raised his eyes from the corpse of his friend, and his\r\nvoice was very soft and compassionate:\r\n\r\n“Did I not say that Terence was his own worst enemy? Had it not been for\r\nthat foolish bewitchment of his—”\r\n\r\nHe turned and pointed suddenly toward “Big Jim,” standing stupidly there\r\nin the shadows. It seemed almost that the eyes of the dead man, following\r\nthe direction of his extended arm, were staring at the bestial, repulsive\r\nfeatures of the prisoner with sentient terror.\r\n\r\n“Look at the hairy arms of him!” he cried. “Look at the long, shaggy\r\nbeard! When he stood on the platform yonder by the door and crooked his\r\nelbow about the throat of Terence, do you think the poor lad knew of\r\nthe pistol stuck in his back, or the words of warning jabbered in some\r\nhaythin lingo? To the mind of Terence ’twas nothing less than the coming\r\ntrue of all his nightmares! Small wonder that his eyes are bursting from\r\ntheir sockets as he lies there with the grip of terror stopping the\r\nvalves of his heart and curdling the very blood in his veins!”\r\n\r\n“Then the name of the weapon—”\r\n\r\n“It is called Fear,” said Captain Dolan.\r\n\r\nThe throbbing motor sounded at the end of the street. With a _squeal_ of\r\nbrakes, the police car halted outside. Doctor Potts pushed through the\r\ncrowd and bent briefly over the body.\r\n\r\n“Heart failure,” he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whether or Not You Believe in Reincarnation, You Will Be Thrilled By\r\nReading_\r\n\r\nJUNGLE BEASTS\r\n\r\n_A Complete Novelette_\r\n\r\n_By_ WILLIAM P. BARRON\r\n\r\n\r\n“Look!” said the nurse to the young interne on the second floor of Dr.\r\nWinslow’s sanatorium. “See what I found in the table drawers of 112—the\r\npatient who was discharged last evening. Do you suppose this horrible\r\nstory can be true?”\r\n\r\nThe interne took the manuscript with a blase air. He had read so many of\r\nthese ravings on paper!\r\n\r\n“This one is really unusual,” said the nurse, noticing his manner.\r\n“Please read it.”\r\n\r\nMildly interested, the interne began to read:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A VAMPIRE\r\n\r\nWhy am I here in this place of madness, this house of diseased minds?\r\nBecause of a cat!\r\n\r\nAnd it is a cat that takes me away from this place—to go to my death! And\r\nmaybe this cat will follow on to haunt me in some other world, as it has\r\nin this. Who knows?\r\n\r\nThis doom had its beginning, as far as this life is concerned, when I was\r\na boy, a lonely boy in my grandmother’s house. My grandmother had a great\r\nyellow Tartar cat that she loved as only a lonely old woman can love a\r\ncat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because I was jealous of the love and attention my\r\ngrandmother lavished on Toi Wah—a boy’s natural antipathy for anything\r\nthat usurps the place he thinks is his by right. Or perhaps it was the\r\nsame inborn cruelty, the same impish impulse to inflict suffering on a\r\nhelpless dumb creature, which I have observed in other boys.\r\n\r\nAnyway, with or without reason, I hated this self-complacent,\r\nsupercilious animal that looked at me out of topaz eyes, with a look that\r\nseemed to see through and beyond me, as if I did not exist.\r\n\r\nI hated her with a hatred that could be satisfied only with her death,\r\nand I thought and brooded for hours, that should have been devoted to my\r\nstudies, of ways and means to bring this death about.\r\n\r\nI must be fair to myself. Toi Wah hated me too. I could sense it as I sat\r\nby my grandmother’s chair before the fire and looked across at Toi Wah,\r\nwho lay in a chair on the opposite side. At such times I would always\r\ncatch her watching me out of half-closed eyes, stealthily, furtively,\r\nnever off her guard.\r\n\r\nIf she lay in my grandmother’s lap and I leaned over to stroke her\r\nbeautiful yellow fur, I could feel her actually shrink from my hand, and\r\nshe would never purr, as she always did when my grandmother stroked her.\r\n\r\nSometimes I would hold her on my lap and pretend that I loved her. But as\r\nI stroked her, my hands would itch and twitch with the desire to clinch\r\nmy hand in her satiny skin, and with the other hand choke her until she\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nMy desire to kill would become so over-powering that my breath would\r\nbecome hurried, my heart would beat almost to suffocation and my face\r\nwould flush.\r\n\r\nUsually my grandmother, noticing my reddened face would glance up over\r\nher spectacles, from the book she was reading and say, “What ails you,\r\nRobert? You look flushed and feverish. Perhaps the room is too warm for\r\nyou. Put Toi Wah down and run out in the air for a while.”\r\n\r\nI would take Toi Wah then, and, holding her as tightly as I dared, and\r\nwith my teeth clenched to restrain myself, I would put her on her cushion\r\nand go out.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather had brought Toi Wah, a little yellow, fluffy, amber-eyed\r\nkitten, home with him in his ship from that mysterious land washed by the\r\nYellow Sea.\r\n\r\nAnd with Toi Wah had come a strange tale of her taking, stolen from an\r\nold Buddhist Monastery garden nestling among age-old pines beside the\r\nGrand Canal of China.\r\n\r\nAbout her neck was a beautifully-wrought collar of flexible gold, with a\r\ndragon engraved along its length, together with many Chinese characters\r\nand set with stones of Topaz and Jade. The collar was made so as to allow\r\nfor expansion as the need arose, so that Toi Wah was never without her\r\ncollar from her kittenhood to adult age. In fact, the collar could not be\r\nloosened without injury to the metal.\r\n\r\nOne day I descended into the kitchen with the cat in my arms and showed\r\nCharlie, our Chinese cook, who had sailed the Seven Seas with my\r\ngrandfather, the collar about her neck.\r\n\r\nThe old Chinaman stared until his eyes started from his head, all the\r\ntime making queer little noises in his throat. He rubbed his eyes and put\r\non his great horn spectacles and stared again, muttering to himself.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Charlie?” I asked, surprised at the old man, who was usually\r\nso stoically calm.\r\n\r\n“These velly gleat words,” he said at last, shaking his head cryptically.\r\n“Words no good flo you. Words good for velly gleat cat; Gland Lama cat.”\r\n\r\n“But what do the words say?” I urged.\r\n\r\nHe mooned over the inscription for a long time, fingering the collar\r\nlovingly, while Toi Wah lay passively in my arms and looked at him.\r\n\r\n“He say what I no can say good in English,” he explained at last. “He\r\nsay, ‘Death no can do, no can die.’ See? When Gland Lama cat wear this\r\ncolla’, no can die. No can be kill him—just change flom cat to some other\r\nthing; monkey—tiger—hoss—maybe man—next time,” he concluded vaguely.\r\n\r\n“He say, ‘Love me, I love you, hate me, I hate you.’ No can say good in\r\nEnglish what Chinese say. See?”\r\n\r\nAnd with this I had to be content for the time. Now I know the characters\r\nengraved on Toi Wah’s collar referred to a quotation from the seventh\r\nbook of Buddha, which, freely translated, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_That which is alive hath known death, and that which lives\r\n    can never die. Death is not; there is only a changing from\r\n    shape to shape, from life to life._\r\n\r\n    “_Mayhap the despised animal, walking in the dust of the road,\r\n    was one time King of Ind, or the consort of Ghengis Khan._\r\n\r\n    “_Do me no harm. Protect me, O Man, and I will protect thee.\r\n    Feed me, O Man, and I will feed thee. Love me, O Man, and I\r\n    will love thee. Hate me, and I will hate thee. Slay me, and I\r\n    will slay thee._\r\n\r\n    “_We be brothers, O Man, thou and I, from life to life, from\r\n    death to death, until Nirvana be won._”\r\n\r\nIf I had only known then, and stayed my hand, I would not now be haunted\r\nby this yellow terror that peers out at me from the dark; that follows\r\nafter me with softly padding feet; never nearer, never receding, until....\r\n\r\nToi Wah was mated with another Tartar cat of high degree, and became the\r\nmother of a kitten.\r\n\r\nAnd such a mother! Only the hard heart made cruel by fear would remain\r\nunsoftened by the great cat’s untiring devotion to her kitten.\r\n\r\nEverywhere she went she carried it in her mouth; never leaving it alone\r\nfor a moment, seeming to sense its danger from me; an abnormal, hated cat!\r\n\r\nHowever, she seemed to relent even toward me if I happened to pass her\r\nchair when she was nursing the little creature.\r\n\r\nAt such times she would lay stretching out her legs, opening and shutting\r\nher great paws in a sort of ecstasy, purring her utter content. She would\r\nlook up at me, maternal pride and joy glowing in her yellow eyes, soft\r\nand lustrous now, the hate and suspicion of me crowded out by mother love.\r\n\r\n“Look!” she seemed to say. “Look at this wonderful thing I have created\r\nout of my body! Do you not love it?”\r\n\r\nI did not love it. No! On the contrary, it intensified my hate by adding\r\nanother object to it.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother added fuel to the fire by sending me out to the shops to\r\nbuy delicacies for Toi Wah and her kitten; liverwurst and catnip for the\r\nmother, milk and cream for the kitten.\r\n\r\n“Robert, my son,” she would say to me, all unaware of my hatred, “Do\r\nyou know we have quite a royal family with us? These wonderful cats are\r\ndescended in an unbroken line from the cats of the Royal Household of\r\nGhengis Khan. The records were kept in the Buddhist Monastery from which\r\nToi Wah came.”\r\n\r\n“How did Grandfather get her?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Do not ask me, child,” the old lady smiled. “He told me only that he\r\nstole her in a spirit of bravado from the garden of this ancient Buddhist\r\nMonastery when egged on to do so by his friends. They were spending an\r\nidle week exploring the ancient towns along the Grand Canal of China, and\r\nwere attracted by the beautiful Tartar cats in this garden. It seemed the\r\nBuddhist Monks reared these cats as a sort of religious duty.\r\n\r\n“Your grandfather always believed that a Buddhist curse of some sort\r\nwent with Toi Wah after a Chinese merchant translated the Chinese\r\ncharacters on her collar for him. And he often said he wished that he had\r\nnot whisked her into the pocket of his big sou’wester jacket, when the\r\npriests were not looking.\r\n\r\n“Myself, I do not believe in these superstitious curses and omens, so I\r\nwould not let him take the collar off. In fact, he _could_ not do it; it\r\nwas so cunningly riveted.\r\n\r\n“He always feared some evil would come from the cat, but I have found her\r\na great comfort and a thing to love.”\r\n\r\nAnd she would hold out her hands to Toi Wah, and the great cat would leap\r\nin her lap and rub her head lovingly against my grandmother’s neck.\r\n\r\nAfter that I feared Toi Wah more than ever. This fear was an intangible,\r\nelusive thing. I could not understand it or analyze it; but it was very\r\nreal. If I wandered about the dim old passageways of my grandmother’s\r\nancient house, or explored the dusty cobwebby rooms, there seemed always\r\nto follow after me the soft padding sound of Toi Wah’s paws. Following,\r\nalways following after me, but never coming nearer; always just beyond\r\nwhere I could see.\r\n\r\nIt was maddening! Always to have following after me the stealthy, soft,\r\nalmost inaudible sound of padded feet. I could never win free from it\r\nwithin the house.\r\n\r\nIn my bedroom, sitting alone before the fire with the door locked and\r\nbolted, every corner of the room previously explored, the bed looked\r\nunder, I would always feel that she was sitting there behind me, watching\r\nme out of vigilant yellow eyes. Eyes that were full of suspicion and\r\nhate. Waiting, watching—for what? I did not know. I only feared.\r\n\r\nOut of this fear grew many unreal terrors. I came to believe that Toi Wah\r\nwas waiting a favorable chance to spring on me from behind, or when I was\r\nasleep, and to dig her great curved claws into my throat, tearing and\r\nrending it in her hate.\r\n\r\nI became so possessed by this fear that I fashioned a leather collar for\r\nmyself that fitted well up under my ears and around my neck. I wore this\r\nalways when I was alone in my room and when I slept, gaining some sense\r\nof security thereby. But in the night time! No one can know what I, a\r\nlonely boy, suffered then!\r\n\r\nMy eyes would no sooner close in drowsy weariness when the stealthy\r\npadding of Toi Wah’s footsteps would begin. I could hear them coming\r\nsoftly up the stairs, stealing along the dark passageway to my room, at\r\nthe end. They stopped there because the door was locked and bolted, with\r\nthe heavy chiffonier jammed against it as an extra precaution. I would\r\nlisten intently, and I fancied I could hear a faint scratching sound at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThen there would rush over me all the terrors of the dark. Suppose I had\r\nfailed to close the transom securely? If the transom was open Toi-Wah\r\ncould, with one great leap, win through and on to my bed. And then—\r\n\r\nThe cold sweat of fear would exude from every pore, as my imagination\r\nvisualized Toi Wah leaping through, and, with a snarl, pouncing upon my\r\nthroat with tooth and claw. I would shudder and tremblingly feel about my\r\nneck to make sure my leather collar was securely fastened.\r\n\r\nAt last, unable to stand the uncertainty any longer, I would leap out\r\nof bed, turn on the light, rush to the door, frantically drag the heavy\r\nchiffonier to one side, and throw open the door. Nothing!\r\n\r\nThen I would creep along the passageway to the head of the stairs, and\r\npeer down into the dimly-lighted hall. Nothing!\r\n\r\nLooking fearfully over my shoulder as I went, I would go back to my room,\r\nshut the door, lock and bolt it, push the chiffonier against it, assure\r\nmyself that the transom was closed, and jump into bed, burying my head\r\nbeneath the covers.\r\n\r\nThen I could sleep. Sleep only to dream that Toi Wah had crept softly\r\ninto the room and was sucking the breath out of my body. This was a\r\npopular superstition in the country years ago, and no doubt my dream was\r\naided by my being half suffocated beneath the bedclothes. But the dream\r\nwas none the less terrifying and real.\r\n\r\nNight after night I lived this life of cowering terror; of listening\r\nfor the haunting sound of stealthy, softly-padding footsteps always\r\nfollowing, never advancing, never receding.\r\n\r\nBut the day of my revenge came at last. How sweet it was then! How\r\nfrightful it seems now!\r\n\r\n\r\n_II._\r\n\r\nToi Wah’s kitten, now half grown, wandered away from his mother below\r\nstairs and up to my room. Returning home from school, I found him there,\r\nlying on the rug playing with one of my tennis balls.\r\n\r\nJoy filled my heart at the sight of him. I had just seen his mother\r\nsleeping placidly on my grandmother’s lap, who was also sleeping.\r\n\r\nI softly closed and locked the door. At last I would be rid of one of the\r\npests that made my life a hell! I put on my leather collar and the heavy\r\ngloves I used for working in the garden. I took these precautions because\r\neven of this small kitten I was afraid!\r\n\r\nUnaware of its danger, the kitten romped about the rug. I drew a long\r\nbreath, stooped and picked him up. He looked at me, sensed his danger,\r\nspat, and tried to squirm out of my hands.\r\n\r\n“Too late, you devil!” I exulted, holding him firmly.\r\n\r\nA buzzing came to my ears, a fullness of the head, a dryness of the\r\nmouth, as I choked him—choked him until his glazing yellow eyes started\r\nfrom their sockets and his tongue hung out. Choked him joyously,\r\nrelentlessly, deriving more pleasure from the death agony of this little\r\ncreature, whose mother I hated and feared, than I had ever known.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time I opened my hands and looked at him closely for any\r\nsigns of life. But he was quite dead. Of one of them at least, I was\r\nforever rid, I thought jubilantly as I gazed at the lifeless body. And\r\nthen—\r\n\r\nThere came a scratching at the door; and a loving, agonized _meow_!\r\n\r\nIt did not seem possible that any animal was capable of putting into the\r\nonly sound with which it could express itself, the anxious, yearning love\r\nthat sound conveyed.\r\n\r\nThe old fear clutched at my heart. It seems incredible that I, almost\r\na full-grown man, a football champion and all-round athlete, could be\r\nafraid of a cat in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nBut I was! Cold sweat poured down my back, and my hands trembled so that\r\nthe dead kitten fell with a soft _thump_ on the rug.\r\n\r\nThis sound aroused me from my semi-stupor of fear. Hastily, I threw up\r\nthe window-sash and tossed the inert little body out into the yard.\r\n\r\nI closed the window, and, with a studied nonchalance, walked whistling to\r\nthe door and opened it.\r\n\r\n“Come in, kittie,” I said innocently. “Poor kittie!”\r\n\r\nToi Wah ran in and frantically circled the room, _meowing_ piteously. She\r\npaid no attention to me, but ran here and there, under the bed, under the\r\nchiffonier, seeking in every corner of the large old-fashioned room.\r\n\r\nShe came at last to the rug before the fire, lowered her head and sniffed\r\nat the spot where, but a moment before, her darling had lain.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me, then, with great mournful eyes. Eyes with no hate in\r\nthem now, only unutterable sorrow. I have never seen in the eyes of any\r\ncreature the sorrow I saw there.\r\n\r\nThat look brought a queer lump in my throat. I was sorry now for what I\r\nhad done. If I could have recalled my act, I would have done so. But it\r\nwas too late. The dead kitten lay out in the yard.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Toi Wah looked at me, and then the sorrow in her eyes gave\r\nway to the old look of suspicion and hate. And then, with a yowl like a\r\nwolf, she sprang out of the room.\r\n\r\nAs night came on, my fear increased. I dared not go to bed. I was uneasy,\r\ntoo, craven that I was, for fear my grandmother would suspect me. But,\r\nfortunately for me, she thought the kitten had been stolen and never\r\ndreamed I had killed it.\r\n\r\nI lingered until the last moment before starting upstairs to bed. I\r\nstudiously avoided looking at Toi Wah as I passed her on my way to the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nI raced up the stairs and down the long passage to my bedroom. Hastily\r\nundressing, throwing my clothes here and there, I plunged into the very\r\ncenter of the bed and buried my head beneath the covers.\r\n\r\nThere I waited in shivering terror for the sound of padding footsteps.\r\nThey never came. And then, because I was tired out by the lateness of the\r\nhour, and perhaps also stupefied by the lack of fresh air in my room, I\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nFar in the night I heard the chimes from the church across the street,\r\nand opened my eyes. The moonlight was shining in from the window and I\r\nsaw two fiery eyes glaring at me from a corner.\r\n\r\nWas I in the clutches of a nightmare, engendered by my fears? Or had I,\r\nin my haste to get to bed, neglected to shut and lock my door? I do not\r\nknow, but suddenly there was a jar to the bed as something leaped upon it\r\nfrom the floor.\r\n\r\nI sat up, shivering with terror, and Toi Wah looked into my eyes and held\r\nthem. In her mouth she held the bedraggled body of her kitten. She laid\r\nit softly down on the coverlet, never taking her eyes from mine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a soft glow, a sort of halo, shone around her, and then, as I am\r\na living and an honorable man, _Toi Wah spoke to me_!\r\n\r\n\r\n_III._\r\n\r\nShe said—I could see her mouth move—“_He that hath slain shall slay\r\nagain. Then he that slayeth shall himself be slain._\r\n\r\n“_Yea, seventy times seven shall thy days be after my cycle is broken.\r\nThen, at this hour, shall I return that the thing may be accomplished\r\nafter Lord Buddha’s law._”\r\n\r\nThen the voice ceased, the halo faded. I felt the bed rebound as she\r\njumped to the floor, and there I heard the soft padding of her feet down\r\nthe passageway.\r\n\r\nI awoke with a shriek. My forehead was damp with sweat. My teeth were\r\nchattering. I looked and saw that my door was wide open. I leaped out of\r\nbed and turned on the light. Was it a hideous dream, a fearful nightmare?\r\n\r\nI do not know. But, lying there on the coverlet, was the wet muddy body\r\nof Toi Wah’s kitten.\r\n\r\nA live and famished man-eating tiger in the room could not have inspired\r\nme with greater terror. I dared not touch the cold dead thing. I dared\r\nnot remain in the room with it.\r\n\r\nI fled down the stairs, stumbling over furniture in the lower hall, until\r\nI reached the houseman’s room. Here I knocked and begged, with chattering\r\nteeth, to be allowed to remain on a couch in his room until morning,\r\ntelling him I had been frightened by a dreadful dream.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning I secretly took the dead kitten out in the garden\r\nand buried it deep, putting a pile of stones over the grave; watching\r\ncarefully for any glimpse of Toi Wah.\r\n\r\nAs I returned to the house, I met the old housekeeper, who stood with an\r\nanxious face at the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n“Master Robert, no wonder that you could not sleep the morn! Your poor\r\ngrandmother passed away in the night. It must have been after midnight,\r\nfor I did not leave her until the stroke of eleven.”\r\n\r\nMy heart leaped. Not for surprise or grief at my grandmother’s death.\r\nThat was a thing to be expected, and the cold aristocratic old lady had\r\nnot loved me over much.\r\n\r\nNor was it for joy that she had left me rich, the last of an old race\r\nwhose forbears went down to the sea in ships, bringing home the wealth of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nNo! I thought only that Toi Wah and I were on equal ground at last! And\r\nthat as soon as possible I would rid myself of the dread of her by day\r\nand my terror of her by night.\r\n\r\nMy inheritance would be a thing of little worth if I must spend anxious\r\ndays and fear-haunted nights. Toi Wah must die, in order that I might\r\nknow joyful days and sleep at night in peace.\r\n\r\nThe joyous blood throbbed in my head and hissed in my ears as I raced up\r\nto my room, got my leather collar and gloves and seized the great iron\r\npoker beside the fire-place.\r\n\r\nI carried these up to the attic, a small, close room, dimly lighted by a\r\nskylight. There were no openings here from which a cat could escape.\r\n\r\nThen I descended to my grandmother’s room. Already the corpse candles had\r\nbeen lighted. I gave only a glance at the quiet, gaunt, aristocratic old\r\nface, dignified even in death.\r\n\r\nI looked about in the flickering shadows thrown by the candles for Toi\r\nWah. I did not see her. Could it be that she, sensing her danger, had\r\nfled?\r\n\r\nMy heart sank. I drew my breath sharply.\r\n\r\n“The cat—Toi Wah?” I asked the housekeeper, who watched beside the dead.\r\n“Where is she?”\r\n\r\n“Under the bed,” she answered. “The poor creature is that distracted she\r\nwould not eat, and had to be driven from your grandmother’s side in order\r\nthat we might compose the body. She would not leave the room, but darted\r\nunder the bed there, snarling and spitting. It’s afraid of her I am.”\r\n\r\nI got down on my hands and knees and peered under the bed. Crouched in\r\nthe farthest corner was Toi Wah, and her great yellow eyes glared at me\r\nin terror and defiance.\r\n\r\n“It’s afraid of her, I am, Master Robert,” the housekeeper repeated.\r\n“Please take her away.”\r\n\r\nI was afraid of Toi Wah, too. So afraid of her that I could know no\r\npeace, nor happiness, if she lived. I was sure of that.\r\n\r\nIt is the coward who is dangerous. Fear kills always if it can. It never\r\ntemporizes, nor is it ever merciful. Beware of him who fears you.\r\n\r\nI crawled under the bed and seized her. She made no resistance, much to\r\nmy surprise, but I could feel her body trembling through my gloves. As my\r\nhand closed over her, she made a little sound like a gasp—that was all.\r\n\r\nI crawled out, and in the presence of the housekeeper, and the dead, I\r\nheld her lovingly in my arms, calling her “poor kittie” and stroking her\r\nlong yellow fur, while she lay passive, tremblingly passive, in my arms.\r\n\r\nI deceived the housekeeper, who thought I was venting my grief for my\r\ngrandmother’s death by loving and caressing the object of the old lady’s\r\naffection. I did not deceive Toi Wah. She lay quietly in my arms, but it\r\nwas the paralysis of terror; the nonresistant stupor of great fear. Her\r\nbody never ceased trembling, and her eyes were lifeless and dull. She\r\nseemed to know her fate and had accepted the inevitable.\r\n\r\nI carried her upstairs, threw her upon the floor and locked the door.\r\nI seized the poker beside the door and turned to slay her. Toi Wah lay\r\nwhere I had thrown her, crouched as if to spring, but she did not move.\r\nShe only looked at me.\r\n\r\nI did not fear her now. On my hands were heavy gauntlets, and about my\r\nthroat was the heavy leather guard I had made, bradded and studded with\r\nsteel and brass.\r\n\r\nToi Wah did not move. She only looked, but such a look! It appealed to\r\nthe merciless devil in my heart. It burned into my soul.\r\n\r\n“Kill me!” her great amber eyes seemed to say. “Kill me quickly and\r\nmercifully as you killed the darling of my heart. What sayeth the\r\nMaster: ‘Be merciful, and thy heart shall know peace.’ Today is yours,\r\ntomorrow—Who can say?”\r\n\r\nAs if in a dream, I stood and looked into her eyes. Looked until those\r\namber eyes converged into a dirty yellow pool around the edge of which\r\ngrew giant ferns and reeds taller than our forest trees. And a misty haze\r\nhung over the scene.\r\n\r\nInto the pool floated a canoe, a hollowed-out tree trunk. In the canoe\r\nwas a man, a woman, and a child, all naked except for skins about their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe man pushed toward the shore with a pole, and as he made a landing he\r\nleaped into the water and pulled the boat upon the bank.\r\n\r\nAs he pulled at the boat, the reeds quivered to the right of him, and a\r\ngreat yellow-colored tiger leaped from the cover of the ferns and seized\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nFor a moment it stood there, the man and woman paralyzed by fear and\r\nhorror. Then, blood dripping from its jaws, it leaped back among the\r\nreeds and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe face of the man in the boat _was mine_! And it was Toi Wah who held\r\nmy child in her dripping jaws! A great Toi Wah, with sabre teeth and\r\ndirty yellow hide, but still Toi Wah.\r\n\r\nThe pool faded and I stood there, looking into the eyes of my\r\ngrandmother’s Tartar cat.\r\n\r\nBut I knew! _At last I knew!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV._\r\n\r\nExplain it how you will, I knew that somewhere far back in that\r\nprehistoric time, Toi Wah had snatched away my first-born before my\r\ntortured eyes and that his tender flesh had filled a sabre-toothed\r\ntiger’s maw.\r\n\r\nNow had come the day of my revenge! I clutched the poker more firmly in\r\nmy hands. I stood and seized her by the collar that none of us had been\r\nable to unfasten. It came off in my hand!\r\n\r\nWonderingly, I looked at it, then cast it aside, to think no more of the\r\ncurious antique until....\r\n\r\nI was in haste to rid myself of this thing of hate and dread. My heart\r\nleaped. I ground my teeth in an ecstasy of joy; my cheeks burned. A\r\nfeeling of well-being and power made my whole body glow....\r\n\r\nI left her there, at last, on the blood-stained floor, a broken dead\r\nthing, and went out and locked the door after me.\r\n\r\nI was free at last! Free from the fear of claws and teeth in my quivering\r\nthroat. Free from the sound of softly-padding feet. I was a new man,\r\nindeed, for there sloughed from me all the old timidity and lack of\r\naggressiveness that this fear of Toi Wah had engendered in me. I went\r\nfrom my grandmother’s house to college, a man among men....\r\n\r\nI did not return again to the house of my inheritance until I brought\r\nmy bride—a shy, soft, fluffy little thing a lovely contrast to the\r\naggressive type of modern woman.\r\n\r\nShe was an old-world Eastern type, the daughter of a returned Chinese\r\nmissionary, educated in the Orient, and she had the manners and had\r\nabsorbed the ideals of the soft-voiced, secluded, home-loving Chinese\r\nwomen among whom she had been reared.\r\n\r\nHer light brown eyes and yellow hair, her slow, undulating graceful\r\nwalk, and her quaint old-fashioned ways attracted me; and after a short,\r\nimpetuous wooing we were wed.\r\n\r\nI was very happy. Only twenty-four, wealthy, and married to a loving and\r\nbeautiful girl whom I adored!\r\n\r\nI looked forward to a long life of peace and happiness, but it was\r\nnot to be. From the very day of my return to the accursed house of my\r\ngrandmother there was a change. What was it? I do not know, but I could\r\nfeel it. I could sense it, the very first day. A subtle something, a pall\r\nof gloom, intangible, elusive and baffling, began slowly to settle over\r\nme, stifling and suffocating the happiness that was mine before the evil\r\nday of my return home.\r\n\r\nI had returned from the village with some trifle of household necessity.\r\nThe servants had not yet arrived, and the housekeeper, old and infirm\r\nnow, was busy putting the place in order.\r\n\r\nReturning, I sought my wife, and found her in my grandmother’s room,\r\nstanding before the life-size portrait of Toi Wah, done in oil for my\r\ngrandmother by a great artist, who also loved cats as she had loved them.\r\n\r\nUntil that day Toi Wah had remained only a dim memory of a fear-driven\r\nboy’s cruel revenge. Purposely, I had put all thought of her out of my\r\nmind. But now it all returned, a horde of hateful memories, as I stood\r\nthere in the open door and saw my wife standing and gazing up at the\r\nlikeness of the great cat.\r\n\r\nAnd as she turned, startled at my entrance, what did I see?\r\n\r\nI saw, or thought I saw, a likeness, a great likeness, between the two!\r\nEyes, hair, the general expression—Why had I not noticed it before!\r\n\r\nAnd what else? In my wife’s eyes was the old fear, the ancient hate, I\r\nused to see in Toi Wah’s eyes when I came suddenly into my grandmother’s\r\nroom—this room! The look flashed out for an instant and was gone.\r\n\r\n“How you frightened me, Robert!” she laughed. “And the look in your face!\r\nWhat has happened?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I answered. “Nothing at all.”\r\n\r\n“But why did you look at me so?” she insisted. “Surely something has gone\r\namiss. Aren’t the servants coming? If they are not, I am not entirely\r\nuseless; I can even cook,” and she laughed again, an embarrassed laugh I\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nShe had the manner of having been surprised by my entrance, of being\r\ndetected in something, secret or hidden, which she was now trying to\r\ncover up and conceal.\r\n\r\n“Why,” I stammered confusedly, for this remarkable resemblance had thrown\r\nme quite off my feet, “nothing is wrong. Only I was suddenly struck,\r\nas you stood there by the portrait of my grandmother’s cat, by the\r\nremarkable resemblance; your hair, your eyes—the same color. That was\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Robert!” she laughed, holding up an admonishing finger.\r\n\r\nThis time I was sure of the note of confusion in her laugh, which seemed\r\nforced. My wife was not given to laughter, being a quiet, self-contained\r\nsort of person.\r\n\r\n“Imagine! I, like a cat!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said lightly, gathering her in my arms—for I, too, was\r\ndissembling, now that I had regained my self-possession and saw that I\r\nwas betraying my secret fear—“Toi Wah was a very beautiful and high-bred\r\ncat. Her ancestry dated back to Ghengis Khan. So to resemble her would\r\nnot be so bad, would it?” And I kissed her.\r\n\r\nDid she shrink from the caress? Did her body tremble in my arms? Or was\r\nit imagination, the stirring of old memories of Toi Wah, who shrank from\r\nmy lightest touch?\r\n\r\nI did not know. I do know, however, that my strange experience on that\r\nday was the beginning of the end; the end that is not yet, but is swiftly\r\non the way—for me!\r\n\r\n\r\n_V._\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on, I grew restless and uneasy; ill at ease and\r\ndissatisfied.\r\n\r\nSo after dinner I went for a long walk along the country roads. When I\r\nreturned my wife was asleep. I lay down softly beside her, and, tired out\r\nby my long walk, was soon asleep myself.\r\n\r\nAsleep, I dreamed. Dreamed of Toi Wah and Toi Wah’s kitten. And I heard\r\nagain, in my sleep, the plaintive cry of the cat mother as she called\r\nanxiously and lovingly for her kitten that would never return.\r\n\r\nSo vivid and so real was the dream that I awoke with a cry of the cat in\r\nmy ears. And as I awoke, I seemed to hear it again—plaintive, subdued, a\r\nhalf-cat, half-human cry, as if a woman had cried aloud and then quickly\r\nsuppressed the cry.\r\n\r\nAnd my wife was gone!\r\n\r\nI sprang up hastily. The moonlight was streaming through the window. It\r\nwas almost as light as day. She was nowhere in the room.\r\n\r\nI went swiftly down the hall and descended the stairs, making no noise\r\nwith my bare feet. The door of my grandmother’s room was open. I looked\r\nin. Two luminous eyes, with a greenish tinge, glowed out at me from the\r\nsemi-darkness of the far corner.\r\n\r\nFor an instant my heart stood still, and then raced palpitatingly on. I\r\ntook a deep breath and went toward the unknown thing with glowing eyes\r\nthat crouched in that corner.\r\n\r\nAs I reached the pool of moonlight in the center of the room, I heard a\r\ngasp of fear, a sudden movement, and my wife fled past me, out of the\r\nroom and up the stairs.\r\n\r\nI heard the bedroom door slam behind her, heard the key turn in the lock.\r\n\r\nAs she rushed past me and up the stairs, the patter of her feet fell on\r\nmy ears like the soft padding of Toi Wah’s footsteps that had filled\r\nmy youthful years with fear. My blood chilled at this old, until now,\r\nforgotten sound.\r\n\r\nWhat craven fear was this? I tried to pull myself together, to reason\r\nrationally. Fear of a cat long dead, whose mouldering bones were upstairs\r\non the attic floor! What was there to fear? Was I going mad?\r\n\r\nThe slamming of the bedroom door, the turning of the key in the lock,\r\ninstantly changed my thought and roused in me an overwhelming fury. Was\r\nI to be locked out of my own bedroom—_our_ bedroom?\r\n\r\nI rushed up the stairs. I knocked on the door, I rattled the knob. I\r\npounded with my fists on the panels. I shouted, “Open! _Open the door!_”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of my furious onslaught, the door suddenly opened and a\r\nsleepy-eyed little figure stood aside to allow me to enter.\r\n\r\n“Why, Robert!” she exclaimed, as I stood there, bewildered and ashamed,\r\na furious conflict of doubt, fear and uncertainty raging in my mind.\r\n“What’s the matter? Where have you been? I was sound asleep, and you\r\nfrightened me, shouting and pounding at the door.”\r\n\r\nWas I deceived? Partly. But in her eyes! Ah! In her eyes was that sly,\r\ninscrutable catlike look that I had never seen there until that day. And\r\nnow that look never leaves them, it is there always!\r\n\r\n“What were you doing below stairs—alone—in my grandmother’s room?” I\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\nShe arched her brows incredulously.\r\n\r\n“I?—below stairs? Why, Robert, what is wrong with you? I just this moment\r\nawoke from a sound sleep to let you in. How could I be below stairs?”\r\n\r\n“But the bedroom door was locked!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“You must have gone below yourself,” she explained, “and shut the door\r\nafter you. It has a spring lock. You surely must have had some hideous\r\ndream. Dear, come to bed now.” And she went back to bed.\r\n\r\nAgain I dissembled as I had that day when I found her standing before Toi\r\nWah’s portrait. I knew, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she was lying.\r\nI knew I had been fully awake and in my right senses when I had gone\r\ndown stairs and found her there. Evidently she desired to deceive me,\r\nand until I could fathom her motive I would pretend to believe her. So,\r\nmuttering something to the effect that she must be right, I got into bed\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nBut not to sleep. There came trooping into my harried mind all the old\r\nyouthful terrors of the dark, and I lived over all those terror-haunted\r\ndays when I dwelt in fear of Toi Wah or of a shadowy something, I knew\r\nnot what.\r\n\r\nLying there in the dark, I resolved that morning would find me leaving\r\nthat seemingly ghost-ridden place forever. My peace of mind, my\r\nhappiness, to be free from fear—these things were worth all the fine old\r\ncountry places in the world. And with this resolution, I slept.\r\n\r\nI slept far into the day, awaking at noon to find my wife had gone out\r\nwith some of our neighbors for a game of tennis and afternoon tea. So,\r\nclearly, I could not arrange to leave until the next day. I must await\r\nmy wife’s return, and in the meantime formulate some sort of reasonable\r\nexcuse to explain to her my precipitate return to town, after planning a\r\nyear’s sojourn in the country.\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, it was daylight now, sober matter-of-fact daylight, and,\r\nas was always the case with me, the terrors of the night then seemed\r\nunreal, half forgotten nightmares. So I dismissed the subject from my\r\nmind for the time being, and set out for a long walk across the fields.\r\n\r\nIt was near dinner time when I returned. As I opened the door of the\r\ndining-room, my wife turned from where she stood by the fire-place to\r\ngreet me, and I was again struck by her resemblance to Toi Wah. The\r\narrangement of her hair heightened this effect. And when she smiled!—I\r\ncannot describe it! Such a sly, secret, feline smile!\r\n\r\n“Robert,” she said, as she came to me and put up her lips to be kissed.\r\n“Do you know what day this is?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s my birthday, you forgetful boy! My twenty-first birthday, and\r\nI have a surprise for you.\r\n\r\n“The old Buddhist priest, who taught me when I was a child gave me a\r\nflagon of rare old Chinese Lotus wine, when he parted from me, which I\r\nwas to keep inviolate until my twenty-first birthday. I would be married\r\nthen, he said, and on that day I was to unseal the old flagon and drink\r\nthe wine with my husband in memory of my old teacher who would then be in\r\nthe bosom of Nirvana.\r\n\r\n“Look!” and she turned to the serving-table on which sat a small, squat\r\nwicker-covered flagon, and handed it to me.\r\n\r\nI looked at it curiously. It was sealed with a small brass seal, which\r\nwas stamped all over with dim Chinese characters.\r\n\r\n“What are these characters?” I asked, handing her the flagon.\r\n\r\nShe looked closely at the seal.\r\n\r\n“Oh! One of those wise old Buddhist sayings, which the Chinese stick on\r\neverything.” She smiled. “Shall I translate it? I can, you know.”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“_‘Wine maketh the heart glad or sad, good or evil. Drink Oh! Man to thy\r\nchoice!’_” she read.\r\n\r\nThen she pulled off the seal and poured out the wine; a thick amber\r\nliquid, so heavy that it poured like thick cream. Its bouquet filled the\r\nroom with a faint, far-off odor of lotus flowers.\r\n\r\n“Shall we drink now, Robert, or shall we wait until dinner is served?”\r\n\r\n“Let us drink now,” I said, curious to taste this Eastern wine, with\r\nwhich I was not familiar.\r\n\r\n“Amen!” said my wife, softly.\r\n\r\nThen she spoke, rapidly and softly under her breath, a few Chinese words,\r\nor so I judged them to be, and we drank the wine. There was not a great\r\ndeal in the flagon, and we drank it all before dinner was served.\r\n\r\nAs I sat at dinner a strange comfortable feeling gradually came over me.\r\nDistrust, fear, and apprehension died out of my mind, and my heart was\r\nlight. My wife and I laughed and talked together as we had done in the\r\ndays of our courtship. I was a different man.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we went into the music-room and she sang for me. Sang in a\r\nsweet low voice strange weird old songs of ancient China. Of the dragon\r\nbanner floating in the sun, and the watch fires on the hills. Of old\r\nTartar loves and hates. Of wrongs that never die, but pass on from age to\r\nage, from life to life, from death to death—unhasting, unending until the\r\ndebt be paid.\r\n\r\nI sat listening, dozing in a hazy mental languor, with the feeling\r\nforeign to me of late, that all was well with the world. I was peacefully\r\nhappy, and my wife’s sweet voice crooned on. Bedtime, the going up to our\r\nbedroom, and what followed after is only a blurred memory.\r\n\r\nI awoke, or seemed to awake (now that I am in this madhouse I do not\r\nreally know) far into the night.\r\n\r\nI awoke with a feeling of suffocation, a sensation of impending\r\ndissolution. I could not move, I could not speak. I had a sense of\r\nsomething indescribably evil, loathsome, blood-curdling, that was hanging\r\nover me, threatening my very life.\r\n\r\nI tried to open my eyes. The lids seemed to be weighted down. All the\r\nforce of my will could only slightly open them. Through this slight\r\nopening, I saw my wife bending over me, and the eyes that looked at me\r\n_were the inscrutable eyes of Toi Wah_!\r\n\r\n\r\n_VI._\r\n\r\nSlowly she bent down—I could sense the delicate fragrance of her\r\nhair—and applied her sweet, soft lips to mine. Again I felt that I was\r\nsuffocating, that the very breath of my life was being drawn from me.\r\n\r\nI concentrated all my will in the effort to struggle, and with tremendous\r\neffort I was able feebly to move an arm. My wife hastily took her lips\r\nfrom mine and looked at me closely, with the cruel amber eyes of the\r\ngreat Tartar cat, whose bones lay in my garret.\r\n\r\nOnce more she leaned over and applied her lips to mine. I lay there in\r\nhelpless lethargy, unable to move, but with an active mind that leaped\r\nback into the past, bringing to my memory all the old nursery tales\r\nof childhood of cats sucking the breath of sleeping children, of the\r\nfolklore tales that I had heard of helpless invalids done to death by\r\ncruel cats who stole their breath from them.\r\n\r\nI began to be aroused at last. Was my breath to be sucked from me by this\r\nhalf-human, half-cat that was bending over me? With a final despairing\r\neffort of my wine-sodden will, I raised my arms and pushed this soft\r\nsweet vampire from my breast and from the bed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the cold sweat of fear poured from my trembling body, I\r\nshouted for help. At last my servant came running up the stairs and\r\npounded on the door.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he called. “What is wrong, sir? Shall I go for the police?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is wrong,” answered my wife calmly. She had risen from where I\r\nhad thrown her and was arranging her disheveled hair. “Your master has\r\nhad a terrible dream, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“It is a lie!” I shouted. “Do not leave me alone with this vampire!”\r\n\r\nI sprang from bed, and, heedless of my wife’s semi-nude condition, I\r\nflung open the door. She shrank back, but I seized her by the wrist,\r\nbeside myself with nervous terror.\r\n\r\nAnd then—there on her wrist—I saw! I looked closely to be sure. Then\r\ninstantly all was clear to me. I was in doubt no longer. I _knew_!\r\n\r\n“Look!” I shrieked. “Here on her wrist! Toi Wah’s collar!” I do not know\r\nwhy I said it, or scarcely what I did say, but I knew it to be true!\r\n\r\n“Toi Wah’s collar!” I repeated. “She can’t take it off! _She is changing\r\ninto a cat!_ Look at her eyes! Look at her hair! Soon she will be Toi Wah\r\nagain with the collar about her neck, and then—”\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw my wife disconcerted for the first time. I felt the arm I\r\nhad seized, tremble in my frenzied grip.\r\n\r\n“Why, Robert!” she stammered. “I—I found this on the attic floor\r\nyesterday. And—and—thinking it a curious old Chinese relic, I put it on\r\nmy wrist. It’s a bracelet, not a collar!”\r\n\r\n“Take it off then!” I shouted. “Take it off! You can’t! You can’t, until\r\nyou become Toi Wah again, and then it will be about your neck. Read what\r\nit says! It is in your accursed tongue!\r\n\r\n“But you shall never live to madden me again with fear, to make my life\r\na hell of peering eyes and padding feet, and then to suck my breath at\r\nlast! I killed you once, I can do it again! And again and yet again in\r\nany shape the devils in hell may send you to prey upon honest men!”\r\n\r\nAnd I seized her by her beautiful throat. I meant to choke her until\r\nthose cruel yellow eyes started from their sockets, and then laugh as I\r\nsaw her gasping in the last agony of death.\r\n\r\nBut I was cheated. The servants overpowered me, and I was brought here to\r\nthis mad-house.\r\n\r\nI said I was perfectly sane then. I say it now. And learned alienists,\r\nsitting in council, have agreed with me. Tomorrow I am to be discharged\r\ninto the custody of my sweet cooing-voiced wife, who comes daily to see\r\nme. She kisses me with soft lying lips that long to suck my breath, or\r\nperhaps even rend the flesh of my throat with the little white teeth back\r\nof the cruel lips.\r\n\r\nSo tomorrow I will go forth—to die. To be murdered! I go to death just\r\nas surely as if the hangman waited to haul me to the gallows, or if the\r\nwarden stood outside to escort me to the electric chair.\r\n\r\nI _know_ it! I have told the learned psychologists and doctors that I\r\nknow it. But they laugh.\r\n\r\n“All a delusion!” they exclaim. “Why, your little wife loves you with\r\nall her loyal heart. Even with your finger-prints a bluish bruise about\r\nher tender throat, she loved you. That night when you awoke, frightened,\r\nto find her bending over you, she was only kissing you, in an effort to\r\nsoothe your troubled sleep.”\r\n\r\nBut I _know_! Therefore, I am setting all this down so that when I am\r\nfound dead the learned doctors may know that I was right and they were\r\nwrong. And so that Justice may be done.\r\n\r\nAnd yet—perhaps nothing can be done. I have ceased to struggle. I have\r\ngiven up. Like the Oriental, I say, “_Who can escape his fate?_”\r\n\r\nFor I shall die by Chinese justice, a Buddhist revenge for killing the\r\nTartar cat, Toi Wah. Toi Wah that I hated and feared, and have hated and\r\nfeared through all the lives that the two of us have lived, far, far back\r\nto that time when the yellow sabre-toothed tiger seized my first-born\r\nand fled with him among the reeds and ferns of the Paleozoic marshes, a\r\ndainty morsel for her kitten.\r\n\r\nAnd so—farewell!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Such a weird tale!” the nurse shuddered, as the interne finished the\r\nmanuscript. “Let us drive over to Cheshire Manor and—”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe this story?” interrupted the interne, tapping the\r\nmanuscript with his fingers, and skeptically lifting his eyebrows and\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n“No, of course not!” exclaimed the nurse, “but—the drive won’t do us any\r\nharm, and—I would like to make sure.”\r\n\r\nAs they stopped their car before the somber old mansion they were struck\r\nby the strange silence of the place. Not a servant answered their ring.\r\nAnd after a time, since the door stood open, they entered and began to\r\nascend the stairs.\r\n\r\nA strange, weird, lonesome sound floated down to them—the yowl of a cat.\r\n\r\nThey stopped for an instant and looked at each other, and then, reassured\r\nby the sunlight, and both being matter-of-fact professional people, they\r\npressed on. At the head of the stairs they faced a long passage at the\r\nend of which was an open door.\r\n\r\n“Look! That is the bedroom he wrote about,” whispered the nurse, grasping\r\nthe interne’s arm.\r\n\r\nThey walked softly down the passage to the door and looked in. On the\r\nbed lay the man they sought, glassy-eyed, with fallen jaw and livid\r\nface—_dead!_\r\n\r\nOn his breast stood a great yellow amber-eyed cat, who faced them with an\r\narched back and menacing snarl. Involuntarily, they drew back. The cat\r\nsprang past them and down the passageway to the stairs, uttering the same\r\nweird cry.\r\n\r\n“My God!” gasped the nurse, with pallid lips. “Did you see? About that\r\ncat’s neck—and it was a Tartar cat; I know the breed—about that cat’s\r\nneck was—was the Topaz and Jade collar—that—that he wrote about!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeighbors See “Sacred Heart” in Girl’s Death Room\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Lillian Daly, a very devout girl of Chicago, the\r\nreport spread that a “sacred heart” could be seen on the wall of the\r\nroom wherein she had died and that if any afflicted person should touch\r\nthis heart he or she would be instantly cured. At once the house at\r\n6724 Justine Street was visited by numbers of ill persons, all eager to\r\nexperience the magic cure. Two priests from neighborhood parishes visited\r\nthe house, but said they could not see the apparition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHold “Petting Parties” in Morgue\r\n\r\n\r\nA grisly spot for love-making was chosen by a wealthy undertaker of\r\nChicago, whose stories of “petting parties” in a morgue, wine parties in\r\na mortuary chapel and “shimmy” dances in an embalming room caused a woman\r\nto file suit against him for $50,000. The woman claims he attacked her\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eerie Adventure and Mammoth Treasure Were Found in_\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN CAVERNS\r\n\r\n_A Condensed Novel_\r\n\r\n_By_ JULIAN KILMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Ericson quietly toppled over and the paddle slipped from his grasp,\r\nour canoe was instantly broadside in the rapids. But Zangaree immediately\r\nbrought the heavily-laden craft head on, his skill once more saving our\r\nslender expedition from the disaster that had trailed us so persistently\r\nsince leaving the large steamer at Itacoatiara.\r\n\r\nA faint shout from the second canoe sounded through the din of racing\r\nwater. Evidently Van Dusee and Hardy had observed our mishap. I waved\r\na hand in reply, and then I bent over Ericson who lay with his eyes\r\nrolling. Instead of sunstroke, as I had assumed, he had been wounded; a\r\nthin stream of blood ran from his temple. Zangaree whirled the canoe to\r\nthe small islet we were just passing. But we were too late. Ericson was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe shock of our fellow-voyageur’s death was still on me as, amid the\r\namazing splendor of that tropical scene, we made preparations to dispose\r\nof the body. Much later in the night, when all were sleeping, I felt a\r\ntug at my mosquito netting, and in the dim starlight I made out Hardy’s\r\npioneer head, with its square-jawed face, peering at me.\r\n\r\nHe motioned me to follow him quietly. Wonderingly, I made my way after\r\nthis soldier of fortune, who, by the sheerest good luck, we had picked up\r\nin the Brazilian capital. Presently he stopped.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to continue your journey?” he asked.\r\n\r\nDespite Ericson’s death, I could not think otherwise; already we had come\r\nfour thousand miles, of which the last fifteen hundred had brought us\r\ninto the very interior of the South American continent. Too much capital\r\nand energy had been expended for us lightly to abandon our project. And I\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\n“You misunderstand,” he returned quickly. “It is not Ericson’s finish\r\nthat made me ask, _but the manner of it_!”\r\n\r\nThe thin edge of doubt as to Hardy’s fortitude perhaps began to insert\r\nitself into my mind. He observed it.\r\n\r\n“Damn it, man!” he exclaimed. “I am game. But you are to know that from\r\nnow on we’ll have to buck not only the elements, but that toad-faced _de_\r\nSilva as well.”\r\n\r\nAt mention of the Spaniard who had tricked and nearly outmaneuvered us at\r\nRio de Janiero with the officials, something like a chill came over me.\r\n\r\n“What brings him into this?” I demanded.\r\n\r\nHardy’s answer was dramatic enough.\r\n\r\n“Only this,” he said. “It is a little thing. But it killed Ericson.”\r\n\r\nI gazed at the slender blow-pipe arrow in Hardy’s hand. It had done for\r\nour archaeologist.\r\n\r\n“That type of arrow is unknown hereabouts,” went on Hardy. “It is\r\npoisoned and is used by the Amajuca Indians six hundred miles back on the\r\nAmazon. It means that we are being followed.”\r\n\r\nThe camp fire was dying out when Hardy and I returned from our talk,\r\nboth of us determined to make the additional four hundred miles that we\r\nestimated lay between us and the point we planned to reach—and to gain\r\nit by land if the water route on the gradually diminishing stream was to\r\nafford our enemies too easy an opportunity to decimate us.\r\n\r\nI stood there, surveying the sleeping figures of my comrades: Van Dusee,\r\nthe true scientist, whose interest in his beloved hemiptera seemed to\r\nrender him impervious to the sting of insect pests and the pains and\r\ndangers of our journey; young Anderson, son of the president of our\r\nInstitute; Zangaree, sleeping in his giant strength like a child.\r\n\r\nAnd Ericson! A lump came into my throat at the thought of the gallant\r\nfellow who had so suddenly come to an end. Had I known then what was in\r\nstore for the surviving members of our little band, surely I would have\r\ncried aloud, for all told, counting the mighty Zangaree, the half-breeds\r\nand Indians, we numbered only ten men.\r\n\r\nBy the time the morning sun was flooding the ravine with light, we were\r\nall astir. Caching much of our supplies, we ferried to the right-hand\r\nbank of the stream farther down. Here, with no sign of the enemy we\r\nsecreted our canoes in the bushes, and, distributing among ourselves\r\nammunition, food, a light silk tent, blankets and scientific impedimenta,\r\nwe shouldered our packs and started on the long hike inland.\r\n\r\nFor two days we made slow progress, because of the luxuriance of the\r\nundergrowth; but in time this gave way to vast primeval woods. Never\r\nshall I forget the solemn mystery of it! Trees rivaling in size the\r\ngigantic redwoods of California raised themselves to enormous height,\r\nwhere their tremendous columns spread out in Gothic curves, which\r\ninterlaced to form a great matted roof of green—architecture of the\r\nGreatest of All Architects!\r\n\r\nAs we walked noiselessly but hurriedly under the lash of Hardy’s\r\nimpatience amid the thick carpet of decaying vegetation, we were hushed\r\nin spite of ourselves. Vivid orchids and marvelously-colored lichens\r\nsmouldered upon the swarthy tree trunks. Climbing plants, monstrous and\r\nriotous in verdure, fought their way upward, seeking futilely at once to\r\nthrottle tree-life and to reach the sunlight.\r\n\r\nOf animal life there was little movement amid the majestic vaulted aisles\r\nwhich stretched from us as we pursued our way; but the slight though\r\nconstant agitation far above us told of that multitudinous world of snake\r\nand monkey, bird and sloth, which lived in the sunshine and regarded with\r\nwonder our puny stumbling figures in the depths below. At dawn the howler\r\nmonkeys and parrakeets filled the air with shrill chatter; and in the hot\r\nhours came the drone of insects.\r\n\r\nAs yet there had been no indication that any one was following us.\r\nIndeed, we seemed to be untold miles from civilization and I was\r\ncommenting to young Anderson on the likelihood of our escape from the\r\npursuit of _de_ Silva when I caught a look in Hardy’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, pshaw!” I exclaimed later, slightly nettled. “You are pessimistic,\r\nHardy. Had _de_ Silva been after us we should surely have heard from him\r\nbefore this.”\r\n\r\n“No. That isn’t so,” retorted Hardy. “Our leaving the river has deceived\r\nhim. I am satisfied that he planned an ambush farther along the stream.\r\nIn a short time he’ll discover we have given him the slip. Then he’ll be\r\nafter us.”\r\n\r\n“And just why, Hardy,” I demanded, “is this insane Spaniard following us?”\r\n\r\nHardy’s expression was quizzical.\r\n\r\n“I have a sort of hunch—that’s all,” he returned, non-committally.\r\n\r\nThe next day one of our Indians was missing. He had been sent back over\r\nthe trail a mile or so to recover a small rifle that had been lost. Hardy\r\nhimself and young Anderson made the tiresome hike to the rear to learn if\r\npossible the whereabouts of the Indian. Later, when the two rejoined us\r\nwithout the Indian, Hardy did not have anything to say.\r\n\r\nAnderson told me afterwards that they had found the Indian curled up at\r\nthe foot of a tree. He was dead without a mark on him.\r\n\r\nDepressing as was this development, our little party found scant time\r\nto discuss it. The way had grown much more difficult, for our road\r\npersistently ascended. Huge trees now gave place to palms, with thick\r\nunderbrush growing between. We traveled entirely by compass, but missed\r\nEricson, who had been a navigator and had from time to time “shot the\r\nsun” to verify our position.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day we encountered a tremendous wilderness of bamboo, which\r\ngrew so thickly that we could only penetrate it by cutting a pathway with\r\nthe machetes and bill-hooks of the Indians. It took us a long day, with\r\nonly two pauses of a half hour each to get clear of this yellow-walled\r\nobstacle.\r\n\r\nOnce free of it, we were glad to throw ourselves down for the first real\r\nrest which Hardy was willing that we should take. But it proved to be of\r\nshort duration, because Anderson, eternally on the move, discovered, less\r\nthan half a mile away, that another path recently had been cut through\r\nthe bamboo nearly paralleling ours.\r\n\r\nThat night we slept behind some slight attempt at a barricade. This\r\nprotection, consisting of a circle of thorn brush piled three feet high,\r\nat least sufficed to keep out a few wailing animals that filled the air\r\nwith weird noises, and most of us rested the night through without fear.\r\n\r\nNext morning I discovered the presence of a soil that was like sand. This\r\nwas consistent with the dryness of the air, but was disconcerting as I\r\nknew that the terrain and climate of the spot whither we were bound was\r\nof no such character as that which surrounded us.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that young Anderson made a second startling\r\ndiscovery, and one fraught with momentous consequences for our\r\nexpedition. Our compass was out of order. This defection was serious in\r\nthe extreme. It meant that we were lost, for there was no knowing how\r\nlong the instrument had been untrue.\r\n\r\nThe day went badly. The farther we progressed the more sandy it became.\r\nWe seemed about to enter upon a great desert, and to make matters worse\r\nour Indians showed signs of discontent. Our supply of water was low;\r\nstill we knew that only a day’s march behind us we had passed a stream\r\nof clear water. Study of the maps that night failed to account for any\r\nconsiderable expanse of desert, and it was decided to push boldly across\r\non the chance of later picking up our route.\r\n\r\nWe waited two days while Zangaree and the half-breeds made the trip\r\nback for additional water. Then we started. If our suffering in the\r\npast had been great, it now increased a hundredfold. The heat, instead\r\nof having that suffocating quality peculiar to humidity, was burning in\r\nits intensity; and, to add to our discomfort, Hardy kept us going at top\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nIn this the rest of us felt he was justified, as there could be no doubt\r\nthat _de_ Silva, with a larger party than ours, was in the general\r\nneighborhood, and looking for us. Hour after hour, until four days\r\ndragged by, we trudged on late into the night, with the aid of an erratic\r\ncompass, through that Sahara-like sea of rippling sand.\r\n\r\nBy the severest rationing of our supply it was estimated that we had less\r\nthan one day’s water. Our situation was serious. To go back was as deadly\r\nas to go on.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this point that our spirits were sent to low ebb by\r\nZangaree’s astounding discovery that we had doubled in our tracks in the\r\nnight and for two days _had been traveling in a circle_!\r\n\r\n\r\n_II._\r\n\r\nI think even young Anderson, for the time being, lost heart at sight\r\nof that bit of inanimate evidence—a trifle of card board that had been\r\ntossed aside—which drove home the knowledge that we were hopelessly lost.\r\n\r\nBut not for long was that restless youth depressed, and while Hardy and\r\nthe rest of us sat in solemn council that evening, he wandered off by\r\nhimself. Perhaps he had been gone half an hour when we heard him shout:\r\n\r\n“_Water!_”\r\n\r\nWe ran toward him, and presently came to what might be called a minute\r\noasis. Quickly a spade was brought and work was started at the damp spot\r\nlocated in the center.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I studied the environs. A few scrubby bushes grew about,\r\nwhile at one side stood a low triangular column of stones. I discovered\r\nthat each stone had cut in it a series of cuneiform inscriptions which\r\neven the untold years of contact with the eroding sand had failed to\r\neradicate.\r\n\r\nQuite idly I had laid my arm on the top when a curious thing happened;\r\nhalf of the upper stone, under the slight weight of my elbow, swung down\r\nsilently, as if on a ballasted hinge. Then I stared into the interior of\r\nthe column, which I had supposed solid, and saw, to my amazement, that a\r\nnarrow stairway led down.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of only a moment for me to crawl in, and presently, in\r\npitch darkness, I was following the steep stairway. My fingers told me\r\nthat the sides were firm and well-bricked.\r\n\r\nI came shortly to what seemed to be a tunnel, and in this I spent some\r\nfifteen minutes, finding the air good and congratulating myself on my\r\nsuccessful descent and discovery of the unique underground passage.\r\n\r\nI was about to start up again to tell my companions of my strange\r\ndiscovery when there was an explosion. It lifted the helmet from my head\r\nand was followed by the rattle of stones and debris that deluged and\r\nbuffeted and pounded me until I sank under the weight of the impact.\r\n\r\nWhen I regained consciousness I lay in the open air. Anderson was bending\r\nover me solicitously.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed. “Here you are—all sound except for a cracked arm.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe grinned at me. “Why, we were all helping at the water-hole when Van\r\nDusee missed you. He remembered that you had been standing by the stone\r\ncolumn one minute; the next you were gone, absolutely vanished, just as\r\nif the earth had opened up and swallowed you.”\r\n\r\n“Which in fact it had,” I said, grimly. “But wasn’t the top open?”\r\n\r\n“Open!” shouted Anderson. “I should say not. Hardy and I hammered that\r\npile of stone and we couldn’t make a dent in it. We never thought of\r\ntrying the top. Finally Hardy slipped a little dynamite under the column\r\nand we followed you down the stairway.”\r\n\r\nBy degrees I got my strength back.\r\n\r\n“Ready for some big news?” Anderson said, presently.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“All right, then. Hang on now. We came to South America to get scientific\r\ndata, didn’t we?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s all gone by the board now,” went on the young man. “We’re\r\ngoing to explore the Caverns of the Ataruipe.”\r\n\r\nThe “Caverns of the Ataruipe” meant precisely nothing to me.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me,” he explained. “The Ataruipe are a lost race of people.\r\nHardy picked up the dope during the time he hung around Rio; he says the\r\narchives of the Brazilian government are full of old maps purporting\r\nto give the location of treasure; some of these maps were made in the\r\nfifteenth century and actually purport to show where the ElDorado may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n“It is said that in earlier days expedition after expedition was fitted\r\nout and despatched to find the ‘Gilded King,’ a chap whose people had\r\nsuch quantities of gold that they built their houses of the solid metal.\r\nBut the best story of all is that of the Caverns of the Ataruipe, a race\r\nthat lived more than a thousand years ago, and came from Asia; they were\r\nwonderful goldsmiths, possessing untold quantities of gems and all the\r\nprecious metals. The legend is that the Ataruipe used to come in large\r\nnumbers down the rivers to the coast to trade, scattering among the\r\nnatives quantities of gold pieces of exquisite design such as had never\r\nbefore been seen; but that after a certain date no one ever saw them\r\nagain; nor has anyone ever been able to locate the particular part of the\r\ncountry where they resided.”\r\n\r\nAs the young man ran on a light began to dawn in my mind.\r\n\r\n“And _de_ Silva?” I interjected.\r\n\r\n“Sure! You’ve struck it!” was Anderson’s swift response. “Hardy says\r\nthe officials long have felt that the Ataruipe came from hereabouts,\r\nand Hardy claims the Spaniard, representing some of them, suspects our\r\nexpedition of searching for the treasure.”\r\n\r\n“Were the cuneiform inscriptions on the stone column examined?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Anderson. “Hardy got all that. I never saw him so\r\ninterested before. He swears we have struck it rich.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly I realized that my throat was burning with thirst.\r\n\r\n“How about some water?” I asked.\r\n\r\nIn a moment a brimming cup of the precious fluid was at my lips. I drank\r\ngreedily and, I fear, with little thought as to the source of supply.\r\n\r\nWhile we were yet discussing the altered aspect of our situation a voice\r\nhailed us, and we turned to discover Hardy just emerging from the hole\r\nthat gaped where the triangular stone column had stood. Following him\r\ncame Van Dusee and the rest of the party.\r\n\r\nWhen all were safely out Hardy touched a match to the long fuse he had\r\nlaid from a mine placed under the obstruction in the tunnel, which had\r\nprevented further progress. There came a dull _boom_, a whirl of air, and\r\nthen all was still.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir,” announced Hardy. “In the morning we shall see what we shall\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\nThere was little sleep for any of us that night, and before dawn we were\r\nready for the descent. My crippled arm made the way arduous for me, but\r\nit would have been doubly hard had not young Anderson lavished on me so\r\nsplendidly his surplus strength. Eagerly our party trailed along that\r\ntunnel, led by Hardy and Van Dusee.\r\n\r\nThe dynamite had done its work well, as the passageway, which ever\r\ncontinued to descend, was entirely cleared. After journeying, as near as\r\nwe could judge, about three-quarters of a mile, we came to a turn which\r\nappeared to be carrying us slowly upward and almost back in the direction\r\nfrom which we came.\r\n\r\nI noted that our candles were burning brightly and that the air\r\nremained surprisingly fresh. There was little conversation. Once Hardy\r\nspoke abruptly to the halfbreed Gomez, who pressed forward a trifle\r\nprecipitately.\r\n\r\nThe way grew suddenly light and I had about decided that the other end of\r\nthe mysterious tunnel would terminate at the surface, when there came a\r\ncry from ahead.\r\n\r\n“At last!” shouted Van Dusee.\r\n\r\nWe hurried forward, breathless with interest, and found ourselves\r\nconfronted by a high but very narrow stile, consisting of six steps of\r\nsome twenty-four inches each, and glaring down, with jaws wide-open\r\nand huge paws outstretched immediately over the apex, was a towering\r\nsculptured monster with brilliant green eyes.\r\n\r\nThe sight of that crouching beast, obviously placed there as a guard,\r\nwas one to appall the stoutest heart. In turn, we passed under the\r\nstupendous overhanging paws, all save Gomez, making way with a display of\r\nconfidence that we were far from feeling.\r\n\r\nIn a moment our blinking eyes beheld that for which we came: a gigantic\r\ncavern, nearly light as day. I think the wonder of that moment, as I\r\nbecame accustomed to the peculiar radiance of the light and my eyes took\r\nin the many evidences of an extinct, yet highly cultivated, life, will\r\nnever leave me.\r\n\r\nRow on row of seats in the form of a huge amphitheater lay in cathedral\r\nsilence before our fascinated gaze. At the sides there extended\r\nbeautifully-cut galleries, hewn out of the solid crystal rock and giving\r\nmute testimony of a civilization at least as ancient as that of the\r\nGreeks. Here and there the fresco-work was interrupted to give place to\r\nheroic-sized figures in pure white marble as marvelously sculptured as\r\nanything that ever left the mallet of Praxiteles. There were scores of\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nHigh above, I was interested to note that the ceiling was of the same\r\nrock-formation that had crystal clearness, which accounted for the\r\nplentitude of light, as I was certain we were not more than a hundred\r\nfeet below the surface.\r\n\r\nSlowly we began a circuit of that wonder-home of a lost people. To the\r\nright lay a vaulted passage, and we came presently to that. It was darker\r\nhere, and young Anderson and I, detaching ourselves from the rest of the\r\nparty, made our way along it. We came soon to a circular series of highly\r\nornamented chambers. Anderson was slightly in advance of me, and as he\r\npeered into the central and larger one of these I heard him draw in his\r\nbreath sharply.\r\n\r\n“Look at that!” he exclaimed, awe-struck.\r\n\r\nMy eyes followed his into the beautifully tapestried room, and there,\r\nseated in a high-backed, canopied, thronelike chair, extravagantly\r\nadorned with glistening jewels, was the figure of a man!\r\n\r\nHe was apparently in the full vigor of existence. The cast of his face\r\nwas Mongolian. _And he was smiling!_\r\n\r\nIt was too lifelike! We drew back.\r\n\r\nThen the certainty that he could not be living forced itself home; and\r\nwe entered that sacrosanct interior. Scores of highly-colored tapestries\r\nwere suspended from the walls, the exposed portions of which showed mural\r\ndecorations finer than any I had ever seen before and which, in tint and\r\nconception, were essentially Oriental.\r\n\r\nCloser view of the man who smiled at us showed a skin texture which even\r\nthe most wonderful embalming could not conceal as that of death.\r\n\r\nOur sense of having profaned the regal place presently wore off, and\r\nAnderson, as much, I fancied, from a nervous reaction as anything, moved\r\nnearer to the figure and lightly tapped it with the bamboo stick he\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\n“How are you, old top?” he asked.\r\n\r\nAn instant later the man, chair and canopy absolutely dissolved before\r\nour eyes and lay on the raised dais in a small pile of dust through which\r\nthe numerous diamonds and opals gleamed at us like evil spirits.\r\n\r\n“Let’s get out of here,” I muttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III._\r\n\r\nThe extent of the underground system seemed endless, as long, high-arched\r\ncorridors opened up in vistas before our astonished gaze.\r\n\r\nFrom another point I could hear the excitable Van Dusee, enraptured over\r\nsome new-found curio or work of art. Making careful note of our course,\r\nAnderson and I pressed on, coming shortly to a rough, unfinished cavern\r\nthat glowed with sunlight as if exposed to the open sky. There came a\r\nshout in my ear. It was from Anderson.\r\n\r\n“See!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd well might he cry out, for in the center of the chamber lay piles\r\nof delicately contrived golden goblets, mixed with hideous-jawed\r\ndragons, flying-birds, pedestals of intricate pattern—all in gold! But\r\nmost astounding of all were the replicas of human figures in gleaming\r\nyellow metal, some of them quite of life-size, others in miniature, that\r\ntilted here and there among the shining mass—all of the most exquisite\r\nworkmanship, though many pieces were dented and broken; apparently the\r\nmass had been allowed to accumulate by the addition, from time to time,\r\nof defective pieces.\r\n\r\nHowever, one piece, the reproduction of a slender female figure just\r\nbudding into womanhood, about eighteen inches in height, lay quite near\r\nus, as if unwittingly it had been dropped. Young Anderson picked it\r\nup. The figure was heavy but quite perfect. In silent amaze we studied\r\nthat exhibit of a handicraft that surely would have brought a shout of\r\nappreciation from Benvenuto Cellini, the great Italian goldsmith.\r\n\r\nI was about to stroll over to the pile of gold, when I heard the sound\r\nof someone running. Then a man burst into the chamber. His entrance was\r\nunseemly, and I turned to chide him.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty I recognized the half-breed Gomez. His eyes were\r\ndilated, his features transformed, as, mouthing unintelligible noises,\r\nhe ran toward that heap of yellow gold.\r\n\r\nIf his appearance was terrifying, the shriek that now left his lips came\r\nas a thing yet more awful. For before our gaze, while he was still a good\r\nthirty feet from the gold, there was a spurt of smoke from the running\r\nman, and he stumbled, curled up in a blaze of fire, and actually _burned\r\nto death_!\r\n\r\nIn my weakened condition my senses reeled at the sight and I caught at\r\nAnderson for support. Hardy and Van Dusee were soon with us, and again\r\nour worthy leader demonstrated his quick perception and resourcefulness.\r\n\r\n“Don’t move!” he commanded. “The place is full of death points!”\r\n\r\nA glimmering of his reasoning came to me, and I raised my eyes to what\r\nconstituted the ceiling of that extraordinary cavern. The answer flashed\r\nto me that the artificers of the Ataruipe must have fashioned portions of\r\nthat wondrously clear crystal formation overhead into gigantic burning\r\nglasses which, in that land of eternal sunshine, daily projected down\r\ninto the cavern focal points of condensed sun’s rays that were terrific\r\nin their heat units.\r\n\r\nBut Hardy was demonstrating, and we watched him. With a long bamboo the\r\ningenious chap _felt_ out the deadly heat points, each of which in turn\r\ndiscovered itself by sending a spurt of flame from the end of the pole.\r\n\r\nAltogether, there were nearly fifteen of the deadly contrivances in that\r\ncavern, none of which, with the exception of the most powerful one that\r\nhad killed Gomez, _being visible to the human eye_!\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was that the focal point invariably centered about\r\nfive feet ten inches from the basaltic floor—the precise point where the\r\nhead of the ordinary man would be while walking.\r\n\r\nBut if the discoveries made by Anderson and me were remarkable, those\r\nof the rest of the party were equally so. Zangaree had stumbled into\r\na chamber evidently reserved for the woman of that lost people. Here,\r\nmounted gems of unrivaled quality and size abounded, most of them proving\r\nthat the Ataruipe as jewelers were equally at home in precious stones and\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nThe apparel of the men in our party was filled to overflowing with the\r\nscintillant fragments; Zangaree, in pure Afric joy, tossed a handful\r\ninto the air and in the unusual light of the cavern they sparkled like\r\nfireworks as they fell. From the walls, lustrous opals flashed at us\r\ntheir iridescent rays; there were gems underfoot, cleverly laid in\r\nfantastic mosaics such as the mind of modern man never had conceived.\r\n\r\nIt was all too overwhelming, and we were a sobered party indeed when\r\nagain we assembled for the very necessary purpose of outlining our future\r\nplans. Of course, each one of us was rich, rich beyond the dreams of\r\navarice, and it seemed the end, or beginning of everything.\r\n\r\nI think that for the time being there was not a single one of us,\r\nlounging there in the pit of that ghostly amphitheater, who gave a\r\nthought to the long hard way we had come, or to the thousands of miles of\r\njungle and river that lay between us and the consummation of our desires.\r\n\r\nNight came on apace, and soon we found ourselves enveloped in a darkness\r\nthat was only saved from completeness by the trifling fire Hardy had\r\nbuilt. Van Dusee presently sprawled down at my side, and pulled at his\r\npipe, talked calmly, as I had never heard him talk before. For once the\r\nentomologist was gone. The thing, our experience, had swept him off his\r\nfeet; his pet subject was forgotten; he had gained new orientation.\r\n\r\n“Such artists!” he breathed prayerfully. “Those sculptured women! That\r\nexquisite miniature of Bobby’s! And all for what? To what end? Of what\r\navail? Ah! The futility of it!”\r\n\r\nAnd again he murmured, half to himself:\r\n\r\n“To think that a thousand, yea, two thousand years ago, these wonderful\r\npeople lived, breathed and had their being in this very place! What were\r\ntheir thoughts, their pleasures—and what, in Heaven’s name, became of the\r\nlast of them?”\r\n\r\nI told him of our experience with the figure which at Anderson’s touch\r\nhad disintegrated so swiftly that the incident seemed like black magic.\r\nAnd for the first time it occurred to me that, aside from the man I had\r\njust described, none of us had seen a single skeleton or other evidence\r\nof the human occupants.\r\n\r\nVan Dusee laughed shortly when I put my query.\r\n\r\n“We found their burying place, all right,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Where?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Thousands of them,” his voice went on, and in the darkness it seemed\r\nthat I _must_ be dreaming; “rows on rows of them up in those interminable\r\ngalleries, each body—or what was left of it—in a handsomely woven basket,\r\nwith gold trimming. Hardy and I passed along touching an occasional one\r\nfor the striking effect of seeing it crumble into nothingness—as your\r\nking did. Ah, the pity of it that poor Ericson did not live to see this!”\r\n\r\nVan Dusee’s voice droned on, and I fell asleep. I suppose I must have\r\nlain there for several hours, getting only such rest as is granted to a\r\nman with a recently-broken arm, when I awoke with a start. It was just\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nHardy was on his knees, his rifle poised, and his keen eyes fixed on the\r\nspot where the massive green-eyed dragon kept guard over the stile. He\r\nsigned to me not to disturb the others who still slept.\r\n\r\nIn a moment I detected some moving object as it came down our side of\r\nthat guardian monster. It was a man! I glanced swiftly at those of our\r\ngroup. They were all accounted for. This meant either that our trail had\r\nbeen discovered from above, or that there were surviving Ataruipe—which\r\nlast was incredible.\r\n\r\nEven as my mind grappled with the problem, another figure followed\r\nstealthily. Then Hardy’s gun spoke. The noise of the explosion seemed out\r\nof all proportion. The first man ran a little, then suddenly bent over as\r\nif hurt in the side. He was sliding to the ground when his follower ran\r\nto his assistance.\r\n\r\nHardy and I by this time were nearing the two strangers. The second man\r\nwas struggling furiously to get his companion up the steep stairway\r\nbeneath the dragon. Just as we came up, he succeeded with a final heave\r\nin landing the wounded man on the top step of the stile. Hardy raised his\r\ngun. I shouted:\r\n\r\n“Don’t shoot!”\r\n\r\nThen a dreadful thing happened. The apex-stone of the stair seemed\r\nsuddenly to sink beneath the combined weight of the two men. An instant\r\nlater, with the swiftness of thought, the gigantic paws of that stone\r\nmonster descended. They struck and crushed to death the two puny men who\r\nlay beneath; one of the bodies disappeared over the other side.\r\n\r\nAnd as Hardy and I stared at this additional example of diabolical\r\ningenuity, the apex-stone reappeared and the paws, as if alive, slowly\r\nbegan to elevate themselves to their original position, by some odd quirk\r\nof fate, surely not contemplated by the builder, carrying with them the\r\nbody of the slain man that had remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV._\r\n\r\nNo more was necessary to advise us that _de_ Silva had stumbled onto our\r\nblundering trail.\r\n\r\nThe dead man, caught in that ghastly embrace, was a white whom Hardy\r\nreadily recognized as an associate of the evil Spaniard in Rio de\r\nJaniero.\r\n\r\nThough we had been but twenty-four hours in the caverns of the Ataruipe,\r\nwe had observed no other sign of egress than the one that led to the\r\nwater hole. Nor, in fact, was there any reason to assume that the\r\noriginal occupants found it necessary to go abroad very frequently. And\r\nwhile it was likely there were other exits, yet in the vast system of\r\nthat underground world, with but a limited supply of food, it would be\r\nfolly for us to attempt to locate them.\r\n\r\nSo it was that all of us felt we should at once attempt to make our\r\nescape the way we had entered, even allowing for the probable attack\r\nplanned by _de_ Silva.\r\n\r\nFirst, therefore, we gave attention to that not unimportant matter as to\r\nhow much treasure we should take with us. It went without saying that\r\nwe planned a return with better transportation facilities, but that was\r\nin the future and much beclouded by the uncertain course of the divers\r\npersons in our band, once we were separated. Curious, indeed, was the\r\neffect on the individual members of our party of this struggle between\r\ncupidity and the instinct to survive the long journey home.\r\n\r\nLike drunken men, the half breed Castro and the Indians wandered around,\r\nhopelessly mulling over the golden treasure there in such quantities for\r\nthem to take, and which, oddly enough, seemed to attract the Indians so\r\nmuch more than the gems.\r\n\r\nAnderson and I stowed our pockets with diamonds and rubies and opals,\r\nbut the youth also clung to the miniature he had acquired on the first\r\nday. The artist in Van Dusee, so long latent in this man of science, now\r\nblazed forth with the fierce light of a falling star. Above all else,\r\nhe yearned for the party to carry to New York one of the surpassingly\r\nbeautiful heroic-sized female figures. For an hour he seriously\r\nexpostulated with Hardy, but received, I fear, slight sympathy from any\r\nof us, as one of the statues alone must have weighed many hundreds of\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nOur lack of interest in his project left Van Dusee in a pet, and he vowed\r\nfinally that he would not remove a single article from the caverns.\r\nHardy, always in character, asserted that he intended to have both eyes\r\nof the dragon guarding the apex of the stile, and in fact, actually did\r\nascend to the top step from which, by a daring feat of climbing, he swung\r\nhimself to the lower jaw and coolly proceeded to chisel the magnificent\r\nemerald-eyes from their ancient sockets. All this within five feet of the\r\nghastly trophy as yet in the paws of the stone animal!\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock in the afternoon we met for the last time in front of\r\nthe gigantic stone brute, his empty eye-sockets seeming to give him an\r\nexpression of increased ferocity as they bore down on us.\r\n\r\nVan Dusee, in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown, was begging\r\nfor just a little more time that he might get with his camera some final\r\nviews of the godlike stone images. So far as I know, the entomologist\r\nactually had made good his word, for when we left the caverns of the\r\nAtaruipe he did not have with him a single gem or bit of precious metal;\r\nmerely the camera with its recorded impressions.\r\n\r\nPresently Hardy took the lead over the fearsome stile. It had been\r\ndiscovered that there was no danger from the massive paws so long as the\r\ntop stone did not receive more than what was equal to the weight of a\r\nnormal man. This Hardy had tested. Surely that contrivance was an example\r\nof remarkable hydraulics!\r\n\r\nWith Zangaree, he cautiously moved along the five-foot golden statue that\r\nit had been decided to take to the surface; and, by dint of much easing\r\nand shifting of the heavy object, the two men succeeded in getting it\r\nsafely past the trap-stone.\r\n\r\nAs sick man of the expedition—and what expeditions do not have their sick\r\nman?—I brought up the rear with Anderson. Busied with my own thoughts, I\r\nfailed to note that one of the Indians had dropped out.\r\n\r\nKeeping my eyes on Anderson’s back, just a step below me, I slid my scant\r\nhundred and fifty-odd pounds (and thanked God for my light weight!) on to\r\nthe apex-stone, which was about four feet square and too broad to avoid\r\nentirely. As I worked my way along, for I was sitting, I was horrified to\r\nnote a sinking sensation—the block of stone was descending!\r\n\r\nThen the air was filled with two shrieks: mine, as I flung myself from\r\nthat place of death, and the cry of a man _behind_ me.\r\n\r\nThe terrific paws, cutting the air like rapiers, literally beheaded the\r\nIndian, who had stolen back in his greed for more gold, and then, in\r\nfollowing me too closely, had entrusted his weight to the trap with mine.\r\n\r\nThe gruesome tragedy depressed all of us, and I am certain we were\r\nrelieved when the immediate turn in the tunnel shut off from our view\r\nthe stone monster, then in the very act of elevating his two dreadful\r\npaws and leering at us, I could swear, with living malignancy for the\r\ndesecration of his features.\r\n\r\nWe had not proceeded far along the passageway when it became evident that\r\nour enemies were waiting for us.\r\n\r\nThe first indication was the different character of the air. It seemed\r\ncloser, and not to have any movement. The thought at once leapt into our\r\nminds that very likely the entrance by the water-hole had been blocked.\r\n\r\nAs time passed and we worked our way up the rather steep incline, there\r\ncould be no doubt about the situation. The thought was a terrifying one,\r\nand we pressed on, eager to know the worst.\r\n\r\nWhen finally we stood at the end of the tunnel there was not a ray\r\nof light from above. Wedged midway of the stair, reposed two of the\r\ncuneiform stones that had first attracted my attention. Apparently\r\nquantities of sand had been shoveled into the hole, for much of the fine\r\nstuff had trickled on down the steps almost to our feet.\r\n\r\nUse of dynamite in that narrow way was, of course, out of the question;\r\nimprisoned in the tunnel, we could not possibly live through the blast.\r\nHardy, therefore, set to work promptly to dislodge the stone. This was\r\ndangerous for the reason that it was literally suspended over him as he\r\nlabored and if suddenly released it meant an avalanche that would be\r\ncertain to destroy him who stood beneath.\r\n\r\nThe problem was cleverly solved by Hardy, who ascertained the location\r\nof the “key” strain. He proceeded by inserting immediately above this\r\nspot one foot of the golden statue we had lugged with us. Surely it was\r\nsacrilege to use that triumph of the goldsmith’s art as a crowbar!\r\n\r\nBut the statue nevertheless was effective as an instrument, as Hardy\r\nattached a rope around the bust which projected to within ten feet of the\r\ntunnel; and from this point of comparative safety the men put their full\r\nweight on the rope. There followed a moment of intense strain, the golden\r\nfigure, of none too stiff an alloy, appeared to bend—and then it came, a\r\nperfect welter of flying sand and debris that left us gasping.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes this cleared, and we could see Hardy grinning at us\r\nthrough the blessed daylight that poured down that stairway once more.\r\n\r\n“Who’ll be the first to greet _de_ Silva?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nI recall heretofore setting forth a number of reasons why we decided to\r\nattempt our escape via the water hole tunnel. It is my belief, on more\r\nmature reflection, that with all my care I have failed to state the most\r\nimportant one: that of the sheer desire of the majority of our party—a\r\ndesire that had been fed by the continued hounding _de_ Silva had given\r\nus—to meet him and fight it out.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the manner in which Hardy answered his own question by\r\nleaping up the stairway, afforded every evidence of how _he_ felt about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe followed closely. But nothing in the line ahead of me seemed to occur,\r\nand to our astonishment, on gaining the surface, there was no one to meet\r\nus. Soon we found the explanation, for not far distant lay the bodies of\r\na white man and an Indian. They were locked together in death, while a\r\nrod farther on was the body of another Indian. He had been shot in the\r\nback. Scattered about in the sand, evidently where the running man had\r\ndropped them when hit, were numbers of brilliant gems. _They were gems of\r\nthe Ataruipe!_\r\n\r\nIn frank wonder, we gazed upon that indisputable proof that at least some\r\nof the members of the _de_ Silva party, unbeknown to us, had got past the\r\nfatal stile and explored a portion of the caverns. But where was _de_\r\nSilva? And what had become of the rest of his crowd?\r\n\r\nOur interest in this matter soon gave way to that far more important\r\nproblem as to the direction in which we were to move. In the apparel of\r\nthe dead Spaniard Zangaree discovered a compass, and while this seemed\r\nalmost heaven-sent, yet it did not tell us the way we had come.\r\n\r\nA final effort was made to dislodge from the debris the beautiful statue\r\nwhich we had used as a lever, but it was solidly buried and we soon gave\r\nover the attempt. Then, with little further discussion, we shoved off,\r\nfollowing the trail of the many feet that led to the east from where we\r\nhad found the gems in the sand.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far when it became evident that those ahead of us were\r\nstruggling with the transportation of heavy objects, which it was thought\r\nmight prove to be golden statues. The correctness of this surmise was\r\nlater borne out in a dreadful manner, for about four o’clock in the\r\nafternoon we came upon one of the beautiful objects. It lay in the sand\r\nand only a few yards away were three more dead men. Again two of them\r\nwere Indians and the third a white, the features of all three being\r\nhorribly slashed with the knives that had been used in the fighting.\r\n\r\nNight overtook us still on the trail of the _de_ Silva party, which now,\r\njudging from the foot-marks, consisted of about six men. We slept well,\r\nand at dawn pressed on.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected happened—and it came as a glorious surprise—for by ten\r\nin the morning we sighted signs of vegetation, and an hour later were\r\nnearing the exact point of our departure into the desert the week before.\r\n\r\nThis quick return drove home forcibly that near-tragedy of our four days’\r\nwandering in a desert which, after all, was comparatively small in extent.\r\n\r\nOnce enabled to shield ourselves beneath the trees from the sun’s\r\npowerful rays, Hardy appeared willing to permit us to loaf a bit, and\r\nso it was that we whites had an opportunity to take stock of ourselves.\r\nPoor Van Dusee was thin to the point of emaciation, and I verily believe\r\nthe man was wasting away as much from disappointment as from hardship.\r\nAnderson, brilliant-eyed and lean, was the same enthusiast, while the\r\nimperturbable Hardy seemed not to have altered a whit: he was the\r\nidentical, brick-red, level-eyed, well-fleshed individual that we had\r\nfirst encountered in a cafe in Rio de Janiero in January. As for myself,\r\nI must have looked bad, as my arm had given me constant pain.\r\n\r\nBy this time we felt that _de_ Silva deemed our party to have been buried\r\nalive in the Caverns of the Ataruipe, for he had not taken the slightest\r\npains to conceal his trail. Thus it was that the tables, in fact, had\r\nturned. _We were now pursuing de Silva!_\r\n\r\nNo one of us voiced that thought, but that it was in the minds of each\r\nthere could be no doubt. Personally, I know that I did not care to\r\nanalyse my own attitude toward the cowardly Spaniard. I did not dare to!\r\nBut what remained unnecessary to phrase in words was that if _de_ Silva\r\ndid escape with his booty to Rio de Janiero, no one of our party would\r\nhave any opportunity to visit again the wonderland of the Ataruipe. And\r\nthis, especially to Hardy (for entirely mundane reasons) and to Van Dusee\r\n(for the purely esthetic) was unthinkable.\r\n\r\nWe pushed on, encountering fresh signs of the expedition ahead of us\r\nwhich evidently, owing to the heavy treasure its members carried, was\r\nmaking slower progress than we were. Very shortly we came through our\r\nhard-won channel in the bamboos, and from then on we kept sharp lookout\r\nfor _de_ Silva.\r\n\r\nOn our third morning in that interminable brushwood tract, while Anderson\r\nwas building a breakfast fire for which Zangaree and the Indians were\r\ncollecting dry wood, Van Dusee, who had strolled on a bit, called back to\r\nus quietly:\r\n\r\n“In that bush over there to the right,” he said, “is a white man. He is\r\nspying on us.”\r\n\r\nIt was only a moment before Anderson and Hardy, guns in hand, were on\r\ntheir way. I shouted a warning and followed more slowly. Suddenly Hardy\r\nlowered his rifle, and when I came up both he and young Anderson were\r\nsilently regarding a bit of thick brushwood.\r\n\r\nAnd well might they stare, for there, leering out at us, through the\r\nfoliage, was the face of _de_ Silva. It was livid and ghastly, and a\r\nnumber of vicious-looking red ants were moving jerkily around the face.\r\n\r\nCloser inspection was not needed to verify _de_ Silva’s decease; but as\r\nthe manner of it also concerned us we did.\r\n\r\nImmediately back of the brush in which had been thrust this shocking\r\nexhibit there was evidence of a furious struggle. The Spaniard’s body\r\nalso had been knifed, as were the others, and this within comparatively\r\nrecent hours, as the fresh appearance of the wounds testified.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of his companions, and somehow the conviction took\r\nform in our minds that _de_ Silva—a man who at one time, we learned\r\nafterwards, had been a professor of mathematics—very likely the last\r\nsurviving white man in his party, had been set upon by the others and\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\nBut we had little time or spirit to expend in comparison for this\r\nvillain, who, after all, had received his just deserts, and soon we were\r\nagain on our way. The Indians ahead of us may or may not have suspected\r\nour presence; at any rate, they were now making as good speed as we were,\r\nin spite of the fact that they still clung to the heavy golden statue.\r\n\r\nWe reached the vast primeval wood, without apparently gaining on them.\r\nOur burning desire was to get to the river at least as soon as the\r\nIndians so that that little matter of the possession of our canoes might\r\nbe definitely settled, for without the assistance of our light craft we\r\nwere, in the face of the rapidly approaching rainy season, doomed to\r\ncertain death amid the maze of that alluring yet deadly tropical fairy\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWe had spent one day in pushing on through the big woods, when a most\r\nuntoward event overtook us. That was the sudden and complete breakdown\r\nof poor Van Dusee. Day by day, I had observed his failing strength and\r\nI knew that it was on his nerve alone he had kept up with the rest of\r\nus. Poor chap! He lay now at full length amid the vaulted silences of\r\nthose stupendous trees, babbling first of his beloved _hemiptera_ and\r\nagain of the profound art in the sculpturing of the Ataruipe. It was not\r\npermissible to carry him, for the man was actually dying before our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe pitiful sight was too much even for the hardened Hardy, whose eyes\r\nonce actually filled with tears as he regarded the form of the plucky,\r\ndevoted, defeated, over-idealistic man of science. At noon that day Van\r\nDusee closed his eyes for the last time, and we buried him as reverently,\r\nbut as quickly, as possible. No time was there now for sentiment. The\r\ndelay of six hours might ultimately prove to be our death warrant.\r\n\r\nAll that unending night we drove on until at times it seemed that I\r\nmyself must follow Van Dusee. However, dawn came at last, and with it\r\nthe definite knowledge that Hardy had led us correctly, for there in the\r\ndistance lay the fringe of verdure defining the course of the river that\r\nmeant for us home and safety.\r\n\r\nIn that moment we needed no spur, and very soon we came abreast of the\r\nhiding place of our canoes. Zangaree, bounding ahead, disappeared into\r\nthe thicket. His black face reappeared almost immediately.\r\n\r\nNo necessity for him to speak. His expression told.\r\n\r\n_Both canoes were gone!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_V._\r\n\r\nIn my hypersensitive condition a pall of black despair settled over me.\r\nHere we were, rich beyond belief in precious gems and holding the key\r\nof knowledge of fabulous, undreamed-of wealth—and yet about to die like\r\ndefenseless stricken animals! The irony of it!\r\n\r\nBut it was not so with Hardy and Anderson. With great energy, they\r\nsearched the locality for traces of the miscreants (whom it had been\r\nhoped we had passed in the night), and, finding traces of them still\r\nfresh, set off in the manner of hounds in chase.\r\n\r\nThe two men had not far to go, for in less than an hour they reported\r\nback to us, procured more ammunition and led the way. So it came about\r\nthat, nearing them silently, we had our first view of the men who had\r\nkilled _de_ Silva. There were four of them, all Indians, hunched together\r\nin a circle on the bank of the river. One of them was talking. To one\r\nside, tilting rakishly against a tree, stood a three-quarter size statue\r\nof exquisite proportions done in solid gold.\r\n\r\nThere it was, prime art of the Ataruipe, pulled, hauled, carried and\r\ndragged thither by an infinity of patience and endurance on the part\r\nof those aborigines, who now gave no heed to the play of the sunlight\r\non that marvelous work of the goldsmiths; instead they were entirely\r\nengrossed in their own affairs. Our canoes were not visible, but we\r\nbelieved they were launched in the water, which at this point was placid\r\nand deep.\r\n\r\nHardy had just left us to get close to the river, when something, or\r\nsomeone of us, moved with too little caution, for the next instant the\r\nIndians were up, and, catching their treasure, ran down the bank of the\r\nstream. In full cry, we followed.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword, and the\r\nsentiment is as pretty as it is ancient; but of one thing I am certain\r\nand that is, even in this enlightened age, the sword, allegorical and\r\nactual, is a much swifter instrument than the pen.\r\n\r\nMuch happened in the next thirty seconds. Our two canoes rode the water\r\nnear at hand. Into one of them two of the Indians, with the help of\r\na third, cast the gold statue, the first two following it with their\r\nbodies. In a moment they reached midstream. But the canoe began to sink.\r\n\r\nSeveral shots split the air. I saw the two remaining Indians, now seated\r\nin our other canoe, were shooting at Hardy and young Anderson. Their fire\r\nwas promptly returned. It proved deadly. Both Indians were hit, and the\r\ncanoe began to drift.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Indians in the sinking canoe were fighting to shift the\r\nheavy weight of the statue, which must have punctured the bottom. They\r\nup-ended the figure precariously near the bow. The canoe listed suddenly,\r\ngoing nearly under water, and in that same instant there was a flash and\r\ninto the murky stream shot the figure of gold. But none of us had eyes\r\nfor that, because our ears were being filled with a succession of horrid\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nThey came from the swimming Indians, who perished miserably. The river\r\nwas alive with crocodiles.\r\n\r\nHardy always has maintained that even had we not recovered our own canoes\r\nas we finally did that day, in time we could have located those of\r\n_de_ Silva’s. But I have questioned it. That the Spaniard secreted his\r\ncanoes, without permitting the Indians to know their whereabouts, I was\r\nsatisfied; and this, it seemed to me, was confirmed by the fact that the\r\nIndians had made so surely for our canoes, the location of which they\r\nmust have found when de Silva retraced his course to the point where\r\nEricson had been killed. All of which meant to me that the other canoes\r\nwere well-hidden, indeed.\r\n\r\nOf the long journey back to Itacoatiara, where we were to catch the\r\nsteamer, there is little to tell. Hardy attempted a rough valuation of\r\nthe gems and odd bits of gold that our expedition carried. On the most\r\nconservative basis, it ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and\r\nthere was really no telling what the wealthy collectors of unique stones\r\nwould be willing to pay for some of our gems, which were of a size and\r\nclarity beyond description.\r\n\r\nPlans were discussed for a return to the Caverns of the Ataruipe next\r\nyear, and at Itacoatiara our two loyal Indians left us after having been\r\nbound to secrecy by oaths as formidable and impressive as the ingenuity\r\nof Hardy could make them.\r\n\r\nThat the doughty Hardy himself considered this method of questionable\r\nefficacy was evidenced by the droll expression of his eyes during the\r\nmummery. He, in fact, was placing entire reliance on the inability of\r\nthe dull-minded fellows to find their way back even if they tried,\r\ncoupled with the knowledge that the faithful Zangaree, who was to leave\r\nus but a short distance farther along, would be able to account for the\r\nIndians until our plans for return were perfected. Castro, the remaining\r\nhalf-breed, took the steamer with us for the long ride down the Amazon\r\nRiver to Rio de Janiero, and presented a much more difficult problem.\r\nThere had never been a time when Hardy completely trusted the half-breed,\r\nthough it was true he had not once during the entire experience by word\r\nor deed shown any sign of treachery.\r\n\r\nAt the Brazilian capital Anderson and I went to a hotel, leaving our\r\ncompanion to look after the half-breed. Hardy’s plan was frankly to go to\r\nthe officials and attempt an arrangement whereby the three of us, under\r\nproper guaranties, might be authorized to lead an expedition in behalf of\r\n“The United States of Brazil” to the Caverns of the Ataruipe.\r\n\r\nOn the second day, and while no word yet had come from Hardy, our rooms\r\nin the hotel were rifled in our absence and almost one-third of the gems\r\nstolen. Anderson had deposited with the hotel proprietor for safe-keeping\r\nhis golden replica and a goodly share of our gems; the rest we had\r\nsecreted about our rooms or carried on our persons.\r\n\r\nWe were totally unable to decide whether or not the thief had been\r\ninspired by a knowledge of our treasures. It was true we had been\r\nregarded curiously by many of the loungers about the hotel lobby and in\r\nthe streets, but no mention had been made of our experience.\r\n\r\nWe were debating the advisability of reporting to the police, but were\r\nrather hoping Hardy would come to us before we took this step. The\r\nfollowing day, a Tuesday, we were surprised to receive a visit from a\r\npompous-looking official. In hitchy English he informed us that as a\r\nspecial favor he had come to advise _los Americanos_ that they were about\r\nto be charged with the murder of one _de_ Silva, and that officers with\r\nwarrants were soon to be on hand.\r\n\r\nThen the gentleman grinned with surprising amiability, and added:\r\n\r\n“Ze next steamair for New York, she leave in three hour.”\r\n\r\nHe still stood, hat in hand, saying nothing further.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it came over me what he wanted. _He was out for himself!_\r\n\r\nFrequently since that incident, I have laughed at the quickness with\r\nwhich Anderson and I leapt at his fat, smug person. In less time than it\r\ntakes to tell it, we had booted, hauled and dragged that chap out into\r\nthe hall, where Anderson finished him off with a neat black eye for good\r\nmeasure. The flurry attracted attention, even on that tenth floor, and,\r\ndarting back into our rooms, young Anderson and I decided that it was\r\ntime for us to get out.\r\n\r\nWe packed our stuff, and a few minutes later called at the hotel\r\noffice for our valuables. These were handed over to us with gratifying\r\npromptness. Then we hailed a taxi and sped for the address Hardy had left\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nThough we could not see that anyone was following us, still there was\r\nmuch traffic in the streets, and we felt sure we were under constant\r\nobservation. At Hardy’s address we found a highly nervous old lady, who\r\nwas very deaf. With much difficulty, and repeated shouting of the name “H\r\nA R D Y” we finally made her understand.\r\n\r\nShe led us to his rooms up the stairs. Hardy was not there, nor was there\r\nmuch of his belongings in evidence. The old lady left us and returned\r\nafter a bit with a book. This she handed to me, making signs that it was\r\nfrom Hardy.\r\n\r\nThumbing it quickly through, I found what we were looking for. The\r\nmessage, folded and inserted between the pages of the book, was dated two\r\ndays previously. It ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_My Dear Comrades: Castro, the half-breed, double-crossed us.\r\n    His cut-throat crowd, I have just learned, are now waiting\r\n    for me outside, and I am writing this note in the hope that\r\n    you will follow me up and find it. You must at once leave\r\n    Brazil. Castro has informed certain political hangers-on of\r\n    the treasure. These fellows have trumped up a charge against\r\n    the three of us of having murdered de Silva. In five minutes I\r\n    shall leave this room by the window in an attempt to escape. I\r\n    have never yet waited for a Spaniard to come and get me. I like\r\n    to go to him first._\r\n\r\n    “_If you don’t hear from me before Tuesday you may reasonably\r\n    assume that I have been done in. The game is big and they’ll\r\n    go the limit. DO NOT TRUST ANYBODY, not even the local\r\n    American consul. He probably is all right, but in this land of\r\n    ‘honest graft’ the trail leads to high places, believe me. Get\r\n    that boat for New York that leaves Wednesday at four in the\r\n    afternoon. Good-bye and good luck!_\r\n\r\n                                                          “_HARDY._”\r\n\r\nI heard a sob from Anderson as we finished reading the missive. That the\r\nindomitable Hardy had come to his end seemed incredible, and yet not only\r\nhad Tuesday gone by with no word, but this was Wednesday, and less than\r\nthree hours remained before the boat sailed, with our passage and berth\r\narrangements still to be made.\r\n\r\nOutside, our taxi, with its motor still running, waited for us, and if\r\never mortal men were in a dilemma Anderson and I were those individuals.\r\nFinally Anderson strode over to me, and, with a look in his eyes such as\r\nI had never before seen, he said:\r\n\r\n“I can’t go and leave Hardy without making some effort to help him.”\r\n\r\nI gripped his hand. What a relief! It seemed almost as if already we had\r\nrescued him—and yet there we were, two utter strangers in that great\r\nSouth American city, with a band of conscienceless rascals after us,\r\nbacked by the power of the law!\r\n\r\nWe started down the stairs where we observed the old house-wife. She was\r\nreading a newspaper, which she now hurried to show us. And there, in a\r\ncomparatively prominent place, was the news that Hardy had been killed\r\nin what was designated as a street brawl. Even our slight knowledge of\r\nSpanish made that short paragraph all too intelligible.\r\n\r\nInto the taxi we hurried, with Anderson pinching my arm.\r\n\r\nI regarded him in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Different driver,” he said, nodding to the man on the front seat.\r\n\r\nI glanced sharply at the fellow, but could not say.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go on,” I murmured, “and trust to luck.”\r\n\r\n“You bet you!” returned the young man. “But there won’t be any luck about\r\nit. We’ll try this.”\r\n\r\nWhen the chauffeur turned around for instructions he got them in forcible\r\nand understandable proportions. Anderson’s revolver was within six inches\r\nof his back. The man went white.\r\n\r\n“_A vapor!_ The boat!” ordered Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe vigor of that driver’s assent was comical. His head rocked and bobbed\r\nwith eagerness.\r\n\r\n“_Si! Si! Madre de Dios!_” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral years have passed since the occurrence of the foregoing events,\r\nand young Anderson since has married. In his nest of a home, to which I\r\nam a frequent bachelor visitor in good standing, there is prominently\r\nlocated a certain replica of a beautiful young female just budding\r\ninto womanhood. It represents the best in the art of the Ataruipe and\r\nis regarded by the lady-of-the-house as perhaps just the least bit too\r\nnaturalistic.\r\n\r\nAmong artists and archaeologists, however, it has inspired more\r\ncontroversy than anything else in the present century. The trend of\r\nopinion is that the figure is an extravagant but exceedingly clever bit\r\nof modern work which is being foisted on a gullible public, ever too\r\nquick to give credence to cock-and-bull stories of lost treasure such as\r\nAnderson and I relate.\r\n\r\nThey ask for the camera and photographs that Van Dusee had. We say that\r\nwe did not miss them until on the boat bound for New York; that they were\r\nprobably stolen from our rooms at the hotel in Rio de Janiero.\r\n\r\nThey ask us for sight of some of the marvelous jewels. We show them some\r\nof the smaller ones, but they tell us these are ordinary and may have\r\nbeen acquired any place; and at their insistence for a view of the big\r\ngems we are compelled to advise them that the package handed us by the\r\nclever hotel clerk was a duplicate of the one we gave him containing\r\nthe select stones brought by us from the Caverns of the Ataruipe; that\r\nwe learned that it contained common pebbles some time before the port\r\nofficials at Rio de Janiero went through our effects, confiscating\r\neverything they could find and seeming particularly happy at discovering\r\nthe package described so minutely in their search-warrant—the one the\r\nscoundrel hotel clerk made up in imitation of Bobby’s wrapping, which we\r\nhad been careful to restore to its original appearance after discovering\r\nthe cheat.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but how did you save this beautiful statue if they got everything\r\nelse?” is the final thrust.\r\n\r\nAnd here Anderson lapses into silence, for the matter is a delicate one.\r\nIt involved thrusting the small package into the arms of a handsome\r\nyoung lady who stood in the throng that curiously watched us come\r\naboard the ship at the last moment under the guardianship of numbers of\r\nBrazilian officials, who hovered over us with the eagerness of flies. As\r\nshe caught Anderson’s eye and got the idea that leaped from it, I am sure\r\nshe giggled with delight at the ruse, for she was pure American.\r\n\r\nOnce a year each of us receives a communication from Rio de Janiero that\r\npurports to come from government officials. The letters are entirely\r\npreposterous in their content—they read like the notorious Spanish\r\nlegacy letters so long the vogue of confidence men, and speak urgently,\r\nearnestly—yea, almost beseechingly—of untold wealth that awaits us if\r\nwe will but come to Rio de Janiero and assist in the quest for the lost\r\nCaverns of the Ataruipe.\r\n\r\nBut we feel, young Anderson and I, that constant and continuous\r\ngovernmental search must be going forward for the immense treasure;\r\nand we feel, further, that in all fairness to the world at large that\r\nwonderful collection of art material should be restored to humanity; but\r\nwe find it difficult indeed to see just why two Americans—even conceding\r\nthat their help might be of value, which is doubtful—should assist a\r\ngreedy and unjust officialdom that is absolutely guilty of the death of\r\nthe best guide and friend it was ever the good fortune of either of us to\r\nhave encountered.\r\n\r\n_Another story by JULIAN KILMAN will appear in the next issue of WEIRD\r\nTALES. It is called “The Well,” and it’s a “creepy” yarn, warranted to\r\ngive you “goose-flesh” thrills._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWoman Receives Poems from Spirit World\r\n\r\n\r\nSeated in an Evanston drawing-room with some twenty other guests, Mrs.\r\nJohn H. Curran of St. Louis wrote quaint poetry by the yard, all of\r\nwhich, she claims, came from “Patience Worth,” who dwells in the land of\r\nspirits. Mrs. Curran declares that she first made the acquaintance of\r\n“Patience Worth” in July, 1913, while seated with a friend at a ouija\r\nboard. Suddenly the ouija wrote:\r\n\r\n“Many moons ago I lived. Again I come. Patience Worth is my name.”\r\n\r\nSince then, says Mrs. Curran, Patience has dictated to her numerous\r\npoems, dramas and stories. Most of these are in archaic Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\n“It is as though you spoke through a wall to a person every day,” said\r\nMrs. Curran in explaining the apparent phenomenon—“a person who would\r\ntell you his habits and customs. After several years of conversation,\r\nyou would know as much about that person as if he were in the same room\r\nwith you. So I feel about Patience Worth. I have never seen her, nor have\r\nI tried to picture her, but since she often talks in Anglo-Saxon I have\r\nconcluded that she must have lived on the Scottish border about the time\r\nof the Stuarts. She has given me stories in the language of the Bible, of\r\nthe Elizabethan age, the last century, and this.\r\n\r\n“It is not Spiritualism, and I am not a medium. I am perfectly normal\r\nwhen I receive messages from the personality who calls herself Patience\r\nWorth. In fact, I can converse with others in the room while she dictates\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\nThen, to prove her point, Mrs. Curran rapidly recited a poem that she\r\nclaimed was sent from the spirit world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMan Captures Lion, Barehanded\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Stanley Graham of Chicago goes lion hunting he needs no weapons save\r\nhis bare fists.

One is Lee Hin, a Chink that\r\ndresses like a white man and spends money like it was water. The other\r\nis the man I got acquainted with and got the dope out of. His name is\r\nWard—Jerry Ward. He’s boatman and runner for Lee Hin. I’ve found out\r\nthat they’re intending to pull off a job in a day or two. We can make a\r\ncleaning on them—get them with the goods on!”\r\n\r\nChief Jordan, a florid old fellow with iron-gray hair and kindly,\r\nobservant gray eyes, regarded Burke with disfavor, as if he were\r\nexamining a particularly noxious variety of insect or reptile. He pursed\r\nhis lips and looked deprecatingly at his assistant.\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Charlie?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t much to go on,” Greaves replied, his voice also tinged with\r\ndislike. “If Mr. Burke would tell us a little more—”\r\n\r\nBurke shook his bulldog head and growled deep down in his throat.\r\n\r\n“You gents know as well as me that I’m taking my life in my hands as it\r\nis. This Lee Hin is bad medicine. He’s got the craft of a Chink and the\r\neducation of a white man. If you’ll leave it all to me, I’ll frame things\r\nso’s you’ll get your birds. If you don’t—”\r\n\r\nMr. Burke clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth with an air of\r\nfinality. His furtive eyes were defiant, as if he perceived the disgust\r\nhis presence created. Moreover, there had been a dogged restraint and\r\ncircumspection in all that he said—carefully selecting his details,\r\npresenting some which would serve his purpose, suppressing others which\r\nmight incriminate him.\r\n\r\n“All right.” Jordan whirled his chair toward his flat-topped desk. “You\r\nkeep in touch with Mr. Greaves here, and we’ll work with you. Of course\r\nyou’re after the reward—”\r\n\r\nAgain Burke interrupted, doggedly, obstinately:\r\n\r\n“Not altogether, Chief. I could have made more by setting in with Lee\r\nHin. I’m an honest man, and I don’t take to this kind of job. But of\r\ncourse I’ll accept whatever money there is in it.”\r\n\r\nCharlie Greaves escorted Burke to the outer office and, with a feeling of\r\nrelief, saw him depart.\r\n\r\n“Well, Charlie, this is one end of the business that I call nasty,” Chief\r\nJordan said, as the inspector re-entered the inner office. “I’d give five\r\ndollars for a chance to kick that scoundrel all the way out of here and\r\ndown into the street!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll raise you five: I’d give ten!” Greaves replied. “Of course, he’s in\r\non this thing, but he’ll fix it so that we can’t do a thing to him!”\r\n\r\nJordan nodded.\r\n\r\n“Sure! And we’ve got to take up with even a cur like this, when he has\r\nanything definite to offer. All right—you keep tab on him and let me know\r\nif anything develops.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Lee Hin’s shack two lights were burning. One was in the front room,\r\nfurnished with a square pine table (on which stood the first light) and\r\ntwo steel cots covered with drab army blankets.\r\n\r\nThe second light was in Lee Hin’s study, at the back of the shack. On\r\na high stool, before an enameled bench, which ran the entire length of\r\nthis second room, sat Lee Hin himself. He was clad in white, from head to\r\nfoot, and over his mouth and nose he wore a mask of padded cotton.\r\n\r\nThe part of his face that was visible outside of this mask was keen\r\nand animated. His dark eyes glowed, and there was a double furrow of\r\nconcentration between them. He was stooping over a glass slide, on which\r\nhe had just dabbed a drop of a milky culture from a test tube. He worked\r\nfast, adding a minute drop of stain, then dropped a cover glass into\r\nplace and slipped the slide upon the revolving stand of his microscope.\r\n\r\nThis done, Lee Hin looked up at the young man standing at the other side\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n“Better not come too close, Jerry,” the Chinaman warned, with a\r\nsingularly tranquil and impersonal voice. “You know—there is death in the\r\nair of this room sometimes. I’m willing to risk my own life, but not the\r\nlives of my friends.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the impersonality of his voice, there was a subtle magnetism\r\nabout the Oriental: a radiation of power, which marked him as a born\r\nleader of men. His eyes warmed with the mellow light of friendship as he\r\nraised them to Jerry Ward’s face.\r\n\r\nJerry shuffled nearer the door, glancing suspiciously at the rows of\r\nculture tubes stacked in orderly ranks at the back of the enameled bench.\r\n\r\n“I never can make out what the devil you want to tinker with them crazy\r\nlittle bugs for, Hin,” he observed discontentedly. “If I had as much jack\r\nas you got—”\r\n\r\n“Money is not all there is in life, Jerry,” Lee Hin interrupted.\r\n“There is friendship—and service! I am doing this for my country. Her\r\nfisheries represent a tremendous source of wealth. The fungology and the\r\nbacteriology of fishes—it is an inexhaustible subject!”\r\n\r\nHe paused, glanced keenly at his companion, then abruptly changed the\r\ntopic:\r\n\r\n“I see you have not changed your clothing, my friend. I know only too\r\nwell what that means. The _Shanghai_ is due in this evening. Jerry, can’t\r\nyou see how this is going to end? Let me tell you something: that false\r\nfriend of yours, Burke, is even now scheming to get the best of you. Do\r\nyou know what is in his mind?”\r\n\r\nJerry shook his head, defiance and wonder in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you. He has fallen in love with Irene—with your girl. In his\r\nmalignant pig brain, he is thinking how he can get you out of the way. I\r\ncan feel it whenever he comes near—he radiates hatred like a pestilence!”\r\n\r\nJerry laughed uneasily.\r\n\r\n“You’re buggy, Hin,” he replied. “Burke won’t try to put no Indian sign\r\non me—he daresn’t. He’d pull himself in, if he shoved me!”\r\n\r\nLee Hin turned to his microscope.\r\n\r\n“What is willed to be, will be,” he observed sententiously. “No man can\r\novercome his destiny.”\r\n\r\nJerry tiptoed out of the room presently, much after the manner of an\r\nembarrassed gentleman with a hiccough trying to get quietly out of\r\nchurch. He felt ill at ease. There was something about Lee Hin——\r\n\r\nHe reflected, as he seated himself on the bench outside of the shack\r\nand stared out toward the open sea, that this Chinaman was a novel sort\r\nof employer. During the six months or better that Jerry had worked for\r\nhim, pulling the oars in the skiff while Lee Hin fished with variously\r\nbaited hooks at the end of his long, sea-green line, the Chinaman had\r\nnever given him a curt word or an uncivil order. He had treated Jerry\r\nas an equal, discounting the white man’s early dislike of Orientals and\r\nhis later uneasy recognition of Lee Hin’s intellectual superiority. From\r\nthat first moment to the present, there had been an impersonal gentleness\r\nabout the Chinaman that had reduced Jerry to a position of almost\r\nworshiping obedience.\r\n\r\nOnly on one matter had there been any disagreement between them: Lee Hin\r\nfelt strongly on the subject of opium smuggling. He would not positively\r\nforbid the young fellow to mix in this illegal traffic, but he was\r\ngradually bending him to his way of thinking, as much by his silent will\r\nforce as by his occasional incisive criticism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNight had fallen, and with it a fog shifted over the rocky shore and out\r\nupon the broad channel. Yellow lights flashed here and there, and the\r\nmournful voice of the fog signal kept up its doleful iteration.\r\n\r\nJerry shook himself and peered down toward the little cove. His skiff lay\r\nthere on its side, well above the reach of the rising tide.\r\n\r\nThrough the mists there came a low, resonant, deep-throated whistle.\r\nJerry stood up abruptly and entered the front room of the shack. From\r\none corner he took a lantern with a strip of red bunting tied over the\r\nchimney. This he lighted and carried down to where the skiff lay. On the\r\nend of a six foot stake, with a forked end, Jerry hung the lantern. Then\r\nhe took from his pocket an electric flashlight, snapped it a few times to\r\nbe sure bulb and battery were in good condition, and finally returned the\r\nflashlight to his pocket and pulled the skiff down into the water.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after he had pulled away from the shore, he would have been\r\ninvisible to anyone standing at his point of departure. The skiff was\r\npainted a slate gray; and, save for the whitish blotch of the man’s face\r\nin the darkness, there might have been nothing there but a partially\r\nsubmerged log floating out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe whistle came again, much nearer. Between the skiff and the shore\r\nthe cough of a motor boat sounded. Jerry let his oars rest, with their\r\ndripping blades an inch above the water. The launch passed on, and he\r\nresumed his rowing.\r\n\r\nThe fog lifted. He could see it hanging over the distant city, a lurid,\r\nangry glow where the illumination of the streets struck against it.\r\n\r\nNow the lights of the steamer showed in the darkness, high above the\r\nwater, moving silently and majestically down upon the man floating there\r\nlike a chip——\r\n\r\nJerry threw his weight against the oars. The steamer was almost upon\r\nhim. He sent the boat back its own length, measured with one keen glance\r\nthe distance he had allowed for clearance, and took from his pocket\r\nthe flashlight. The _Shanghai_ was opposite the spark of red that\r\nindicated the position of the lantern on the shore when Jerry flashed his\r\nsignal—three short flashes and a longer one.\r\n\r\nNext moment he had caught up his oars. From a port hole high above\r\nthere shot a dark object which swooped down and struck the water with a\r\nsmashing impact; two other bundles followed it.\r\n\r\nThe ship continued on its way, but at three points on the dark water\r\na tiny glow showed where the cork-buoyed packages of smoking opium\r\nwere floating. To each had been attached a small glass tube containing\r\nphosphorus, invisible at any great distance, but easily distinguished by\r\nthe man in the boat.\r\n\r\nJerry pushed the skiff forward with sturdy breast strokes. He reached\r\nover the side for the first of the packages and hauled it in. Another\r\nstroke carried him within reach of the second bundle.\r\n\r\nHe was just about to seize it when a warning sound reached him—the cough\r\nof a gas engine. In a flash he remembered the launch which had passed\r\nseaward close to shore. They had taken advantage of the same darkness\r\nthat had protected him.\r\n\r\nA light blazed out—the search light of the revenue boat.\r\n\r\nIn that instant the young man thought of his mother, old, placid,\r\ncredulous, to whom he had told fairy stories to account for the money\r\nhe gave her so prodigally at times. And he saw the dark eyes and the\r\noval face of a girl—his girl, Irene—and the face of Lee Hin, serene\r\nand impassive as if carved of ivory. It was Lee Hin who had warned him\r\nthis very evening; and warned him of the business itself, and of Burke,\r\nJerry’s associate in it.\r\n\r\nAs if it had been a spectre, summoned by this racing thought, a face\r\nstood out of the darkness ahead: the red, threatening face of Burke,\r\nstanding at the shoulder of another man in the prow of the launch.\r\n\r\n“That’s him!” Burke was saying, in his hoarse, growling voice. “Look out\r\nfor the dope—”\r\n\r\nJerry gripped an oar and swung himself to his feet. He cast a burning\r\nlook upon the informer.\r\n\r\n“You dirty dog—”\r\n\r\nThe nose of the launch rose on the swell. As it came down it caught the\r\nforward end of the skiff under its sharp keel.\r\n\r\nIn the same instant there was the _crack_ of a pistol, and Jerry pitched\r\nfrom his skiff into the water. Burke, the gun still quivering in his\r\nhand, stared over, searching the glistening surface of the tide.\r\n\r\n“Take that gun away from him!” a voice from the rear of the launch\r\ncommanded. “He had no business to shoot—”\r\n\r\n“I did it in self-defense!” Burke growled. “In another moment he would\r\nhave got me with that oar! Get a move on, you fellows! Grab that package!\r\nWe’ve got to get ashore before Lee Hin makes his getaway!”\r\n\r\nBut when they came to the shack of Lee Hin, ten minutes later, the lights\r\nwere out and the place was deserted.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the money he had saved from his profits in opium running Burke was\r\nable to travel north in first-class style. He sojourned for a time in\r\nCanada, then went east and visited New York.\r\n\r\nHe told himself he was through with dope. Every man’s hand was against\r\nthe drug-runner, while the vender of good moonshine or smuggled liquor\r\nwas looked upon as a public benefactor. No more opium for him—he would\r\nbecome a bootlegger.\r\n\r\nHe stayed in New York ten days, and discovered that the business he had\r\ncontemplated entering was organized like a trust or a shipping pool, and\r\nthat to enter it he must have “real money.” His little roll, which he had\r\nlooked upon with considerable complacency, was reduced to microscopic\r\nsize by comparison with the financial resources of these eastern\r\noperators.\r\n\r\nBurke cut his New York visit short. Memories were stirring uneasily\r\nwithin him—the face of a dark-eyed girl, which flashed upon him sometimes\r\nout of the dusk, and the smell of fog blowing gustily down Market Street.\r\nThere was nothing like that in the East. He went to Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago he stayed two days. He had purposed to remain at least a week,\r\nbut on that second day a feeling, which had come to him before, returned\r\nwith increased energy. It was what Burke called a “hunch.”\r\n\r\n“That little dame is thinking about me,” he growled down in his burly\r\nthroat. “She’s forgetting that scut, and I’m going back! I got a hunch\r\nshe’ll treat me right, now that she’s forgotten him!”\r\n\r\nThree nights later Burke was standing on the upper deck of the Oakland\r\nferry, looking with ferocious tenderness at the lights of his native\r\ncity. The clock in the tower of the Ferry Building showed that it was\r\nstill early; but a powdery fog was blowing down street, making it seem\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nBurke secured a room at a waterfront hotel. He scrubbed and groomed\r\nhimself, anointed his hair with perfume, and presently sallied forth. He\r\nwas going to test that hunch of his.\r\n\r\nHe journeyed to an outlying residential district. Down a side street he\r\ntramped stolidly. He turned a corner—and hesitated.\r\n\r\nThere, a few doors away, was the apartment house. He slipped along to the\r\ntradesmen’s entrance and stepped into its sheltering gloom. He didn’t\r\nfeel exactly comfortable. He had pictured himself going boldly up to the\r\ndoor and ringing the bell. Now he decided to wait a while—to reconnoiter.\r\n\r\nPeople came and went—elderly people; children; occasionally a girl whose\r\nhalf perceived figure brought him forward, tense and breathless. Then\r\nas he was starting toward the entrance of the apartment, the girl he\r\nwas hoping yet fearing to see came down the street from the opposite\r\ndirection, passed within five feet of him, and went into the house. She\r\nhad not seen him, but he had seen her.\r\n\r\nBurke realized that the impression of that pale, sorrowful face would be\r\nwith him till he died.\r\n\r\nHe left his retreat a few minutes later and walked slowly away. He could\r\nfeel the perspiration trickling down his forehead into his eyes. His\r\nheart pounded steadily at his ribs.\r\n\r\nBurke decided, without thinking much about the matter, to walk the\r\ntwo miles back to his hotel. He struck off down a street lit with\r\nold-fashioned gas lamps, whose straw-colored flames gleamed green and\r\nwitchlike in the eddying fog. He had steadied down to his habitual pace,\r\nand had no premonition to look behind him. If he had only had one of his\r\nhunches now....\r\n\r\nBut he didn’t. Perhaps it would have made little difference, in any case;\r\nfor the lithe figure, which had detached itself from the shadows of a\r\nvacant lot across from the apartment house as Burke departed, blended\r\neasily with the gloom of the late evening.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his hotel, somewhat reassured by his walk. His blood\r\ntingled and he felt thoroughly alive. He even grinned to himself as he\r\ntook his key from the night clerk and went up to his room on the second\r\nfloor. He had had a case of “nerves,” that was all.\r\n\r\n“Damned if I don’t think I’ve got kind of out of the habit of breathing\r\nthis fishy night air,” he told himself, with heavy jocularity. “Well,\r\nsomething give me the creeps, for sure!”\r\n\r\nHe closed his window and latched it securely. He had already locked his\r\ndoor, and now he braced a chair under the knob. There was no transom—no\r\nother opening through which a breath of night air could come, except a\r\nrather wide crack beneath the door.\r\n\r\nHe ignored this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes after Burke had locked himself into his room, the figure\r\nof a young Chinaman might have been seen journeying up Clay Street.\r\n\r\nThe face of this Chinaman was not an ordinary one. The lips were\r\nthin and passionless. The eyes were inscrutable. There was something\r\nimposing—something of impersonal power—in the serene and almost pitying\r\nexpression of that yellow, mask-like face.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman wore a loose-fitting silk blouse and silk trousers, and\r\nthick-soled felt slippers and a black silk cap. His arms were crossed\r\nover his chest, and his hands were concealed in the wide sleeves. He\r\nwalked with his head bowed, evidently in deep thought.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, he followed his rather devious way until it brought him to\r\na basement door, opening off from an obscure alley. Here he let himself\r\nin with a great brass key.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the room, he paused to shut and lock and finally to bar the\r\ndoor before turning on a light. It was a low-ceiled apartment of unusual\r\nextent, so that its farther walls were lost in obscurity. It was warm,\r\nalmost steamy; and there was a pungent smell as of seaweed, and the salt\r\nwind from the ocean.\r\n\r\nA bench with a white-enameled top was built against one wall. This bench\r\nwas covered with racks for test tubes and culture bottles, and with\r\nbell-jars, reagents, stains, a compound microscope with a revolving stand\r\nand other apparatus of various sorts.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer crossed over to this bench and selected a wide-mouthed vial,\r\ninto whose neck he fitted loosely a pledget of absorbent cotton. He\r\nplaced the bottle on the bench, convenient to a high stool on which he\r\nevidently intended to seat himself.\r\n\r\nNext he selected a surgeon’s forceps with long, thin points, and, with\r\nthis in his hand he crossed over to a keg placed on a wooden bench in a\r\ncorner of the room. The light, though dim here, sufficed to enable him\r\nto peer down through the netting that covered the keg and to perceive a\r\nmyriad of filmy creatures which clung to the under side of the netting.\r\n\r\nDeftly he raised the netting at one side, thrust his hand, armed with the\r\nforceps, underneath, and clipped one of the captives by its black-veined\r\nwings. Replacing the netting, he crossed over to the bench and seated\r\nhimself on the stool.\r\n\r\nWith the precision of one accustomed to the handling of minute objects,\r\nhe selected from a rack in front of him a tube, plugged with cotton and\r\npartly filled with a milky, clouded fluid. Still holding the little\r\ncreature he had taken from the keg by its captured wings, he removed the\r\ncotton stopper from this culture tube, dipped a tiny glass rod into the\r\nturbid fluid within, and applied the rod to the head of the captive. He\r\nthen placed the latter in the wide-mouthed vial, replaced the cotton\r\nstopper, and returned to the miniature rain-barrel for a new specimen.\r\n\r\nIt was slow work, but the man at the bench performed every action with\r\na machinelike regularity and an unrelaxing attention that showed the\r\nimportance he attached to it. At the end of half an hour he had two dozen\r\nprisoners in the vial. He held them up toward the light and crooned\r\ngently to them:\r\n\r\n“Little friends—little angels of justice! Justice? But how may I be sure—”\r\n\r\nHe laid the vial gently down and stood looking at it. His lips moved.\r\nThen his eyes lighted, and hastily he turned and selected another vial,\r\nthe exact counterpart of the one he had filled with the “little friends.”\r\n\r\nEquipped with this second vial and the forceps, he returned to the keg\r\nand presently he had placed in it a score or so of untreated insects.\r\nHe placed the two vials side by side, arranged the cotton which filled\r\nthe necks so that it furnished no clew to the identity of the bottle\r\ncontaining the original captives, and finally he closed his eyes and\r\nshuffled the vials swiftly about.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished this queer juggling of the bottles, the Chinaman\r\nbetook himself to a distant part of the basement, and from behind a\r\npiece of striped ticking, hanging against the wall he took a bundle of\r\nclothing. Quickly divesting himself of the garb he wore, he changed into\r\nthis new costume. It was a dilapidated suit, such as might have been\r\nworn by a Chinese laundryman in indigent circumstances.\r\n\r\nNext he secured some newspapers, which he folded in such a way as to\r\napproximate the size of laundered shirts. He placed six of these dummy\r\nshirts on a sheet of wrapping paper, folded the latter neatly, and tied\r\nit. Returning with this package to the bench, he wrote the name “Burke”\r\nclumsily on it with a soft leaded pencil, and, after it, some Chinese\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nAll this time he had resolutely refrained from glancing at the two\r\nvials, but when the package was ready he moved backward along the bench,\r\nfumbling behind him till his slim hand encountered one of the bottles.\r\n\r\nWithout glancing at it, he placed it carefully in an inner pocket of his\r\nragged blouse, tucked the bundle under his arm, crossed to the door, and\r\nturned off the light and went out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe night clerk of the Great Eastern Hotel, many of whose patrons were\r\nsea-faring men, was accustomed to seeing Chinese laundrymen delivering\r\nspecial orders of shirts and underwear at all hours of the day and night.\r\nHe therefore glanced negligently over his shoulder when a meek voice\r\nhailed him from the counter:\r\n\r\n“I say, Bossy Man—you sabe Captain Buck? Him come all same today?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Burke? All right, John—you’ll find him up in two-one-seven,\r\nstreet side, back of the hall. He’s in his room now.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman shuffled away, went padding up the stairs and down the long\r\nhall, and found the door of two-one-seven. Here he paused and considered.\r\nHe must make no mistake.\r\n\r\nHe tried the door softly. It was locked, of course. Then he knocked and\r\nraised his voice, speaking English in a way that would have startled the\r\nnight clerk:\r\n\r\n“Is this Mr. Peter Fitzgerald’s room?”\r\n\r\nA rumbling growl ended in a curse.\r\n\r\n“No, damn your silly eyes, it ain’t! Get away from that door!”\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman muttered an apology and retreated audibly. Half way down\r\nthe hall he stopped, took the vial from his pocket, and returned to\r\ntwo-one-seven.\r\n\r\nNoiselessly he approached the door and knelt down. He removed the pledget\r\nof cotton from the neck of the bottle and by the light of the hall lamp\r\ngently blew each tiny insect under the door as it was shaken clear of its\r\nglass prison.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, Lee Hin undressed and climbed into bed in the little\r\nchamber adjoining the basement laboratory.\r\n\r\nJust before he snapped off the light, he took a pledget of cotton out of\r\nthe neck of a wide-mouthed bottle and shook from the latter a score or so\r\nof buzzing insects.\r\n\r\n“Little friends!” he said gently. “May the spirit of justice which rules\r\nall things—which holds the suns in their appointed orbits as they swing\r\nthrough infinite space, and which guides the destinies of the tiniest\r\ninsect—may the God of all good men, of Moses and Confucius, decide—and\r\nstrike through you!”\r\n\r\nThen he turned out the light and went placidly to bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBurke slept but poorly that first night after his return.\r\n\r\nHe was just dropping into a doze when some blundering fool knocked at\r\nhis door by mistake; and after Burke recovered from the rage which this\r\nincident occasioned, a mosquito buzzed down out of the ceiling and bit\r\nhim on the neck. He killed the insect with the first slap; but a few\r\nminutes later, just as he was again becoming drowsy, another bit him\r\nunder the eye.\r\n\r\nAfter that it seemed to him that the room was full of mosquitoes. He made\r\nup his mind that his nerves were playing him tricks. There couldn’t be so\r\nmany of the tormenting insects in one room! He had seen none during the\r\nevening. He must be imagining half of it—but there were the bites!\r\n\r\nIt was nearly three o’clock before he finally fell asleep. And he slept\r\nlike a drugged man till late in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhen he got up and looked at himself in the glass, he was furious to find\r\nhis face disfigured by three great purple bites. There were at least a\r\ndozen others on his body, but those he didn’t mind. He was thinking of\r\nthe effect of these disfigurements on the girl, whom he had resolved to\r\nsee tonight.\r\n\r\nHe killed half a dozen blood filled mosquitoes, perched heavily in the\r\nwindow, and tramped downstairs to berate the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe clerk listened to him with gathering wrath.\r\n\r\n“Mosquitoes your grandmother!” he snarled. “We never have no mosquitoes\r\nin this house! I shouldn’t wonder if you had the itch. You better find a\r\nroom somewhere else!”\r\n\r\nBurke looked ferociously at him, but the clerk returned the glare with\r\ninterest. Not for nothing had he run a water-side hotel for ten years. He\r\nknew how to meet threat with threat. Burke went out and ate breakfast,\r\nfor which he discovered he had little appetite.\r\n\r\nHe put in most of the day walking the streets, thinking of his\r\ngrievances, and treating his mosquito bites. He bought a bottle of lotion\r\nfrom a druggist. The latter eyed the bites dubiously.\r\n\r\n“Those mosquitoes must have been some snapping turtles, friend!” he\r\ncommented. “They look more like tick bites. You’d better take something\r\nfor your blood—some of this compound—”\r\n\r\nBurke seized the lotion he had paid for and dashed from the store. His\r\nhead ached. Plainly, everyone was mad—everyone but himself.\r\n\r\nFor a time, during the middle of the day, the mosquito bites seemed to be\r\ngetting better; but Burke continued to apply the lotion, and to inspect\r\nhimself in the glass.\r\n\r\nHe would be fairly presentable by night, at this rate.\r\n\r\nIt was about four o’clock when he became aware of a shooting pain\r\nradiating from the bite he had first received—the one on his neck. He\r\njumped up and ran to the looking-glass. The thing had puffed up like a\r\nwalnut, and had turned an angry purplish color.\r\n\r\nFeverishly, Burke applied more lotion. He made a compress with a wet\r\ntowel and wrapped it around his neck. Hardly had he accomplished this\r\nwhen he perceived that another of the bites was swelling and growing\r\npainful. Within an hour and a half, he had a dozen of these inflamed\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nBurke realized that he would have to put off his visit to the girl until\r\nnext day. Probably the druggist was right—his blood was too thick. He\r\nmust buy a bottle of that stuff—that compound. He had been drinking too\r\nmuch bootleg whisky.\r\n\r\nHe went to bed early. The thought of food nauseated him. He sank into a\r\nheavy slumber, from which he was aroused by a voice in the room.\r\n\r\nIt was a thick voice, repeating long, meaningless strings of words. Burke\r\ntried to sit up to listen, and the voice ceased. He was not able to raise\r\nhimself, however. Something was wrong inside his head....\r\n\r\nIt was some time later that Burke discovered that the flat, babbling\r\nvoice was his own! It rose to a scream, then shifted into a screechy\r\nlaugh....\r\n\r\nStrange faces were bending over him. There was a man with a pointed\r\nbeard, who looked at him with pursed lips. This man was speaking:\r\n\r\n“I never encountered a case of the kind before. I would call it anthrax,\r\nbut for the number of the primary lesions. The interest is purely\r\nacademic, of course. He’ll be dead within twelve hours. Has he had any\r\nvisitors? Any way you can find out if he has any relatives or friends?”\r\n\r\nWith a strange detachment, as if he were already a spirit, Burke\r\nlistened. The night clerk was speaking:\r\n\r\n“There has been no mail for him, and no visitors—except a Chinaman, who\r\nbrought him a package of laundry. I guess he’s a stranger—”\r\n\r\nBurke’s face became purple, and his body drew itself into a great knot.\r\n_A Chinaman to see him!_ Laundry—he had had no laundry!\r\n\r\nSuddenly he understood. Perception shone through him like a searchlight.\r\n\r\n_A Chinaman never forgets! Lee Hin_—\r\n\r\nHe tried to shout the name. He must get his accusation into writing—\r\n\r\nIn the act of sitting up to demand paper and pen, he was caught up into a\r\ngreat darkness. He fell heavily back upon the bed.\r\n\r\n“Syncope!” said the man with the pointed beard. “I must write up this\r\ncase for the National Medical Journal.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLee Hin, looking upon the last scene in the drama, meditated deeply.\r\n\r\n“No man can escape his destiny,” he mused.\r\n\r\nThe last shovel of dirt was thrown over the mound, and the man who threw\r\nit deftly patted it into place with the rounded back of his spade.\r\n\r\nLee Hin walked gravely away. He passed along a graveled path and\r\napproached a distant part of the cemetery. In the shade of a hawthorne he\r\npaused and stood gently regarding the figure of a girl, kneeling beside a\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n“Poor little Irene!” he murmured.\r\n\r\nAnd then he strode silently down the path and out at the cemetery gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice Seize 800 Quarts of “Embalming Fluid”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuspicious of its peculiar odor, Chicago police confiscated 800 quarts\r\nof “embalming fluid,” found on an undertaker’s truck at the rear of 1400\r\nSouth Central Park Avenue. Investigating, the police discovered that each\r\nof the 800 quart bottles bore the label, “Cedar Brook.” Investigating\r\nfurther, they found that each bottle contained rye whisky. Three men were\r\narrested with the undertaker’s cargo. None could “remember” the name of\r\nthe man to whom they were told to deliver the “embalming fluid.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n21 Jewel Burlington\r\n\r\n    Adjusted to the Second\r\n    Adjusted to Temperature\r\n    Adjusted to Isochronism\r\n    Adjusted to Positions\r\n    21 Ruby and Sapphire Jewels\r\n    25 Year Gold Strata Case\r\n    Your Choice of Dials\r\n    (_Including Montgomery R.

W. Crane\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“But mother is too sick to be moved!” the girl said imploringly. She was\r\nrather slim, and a trifle taller than average. Her face was beautiful\r\ndespite the paleness of her cheeks and the slightly dark circles beneath\r\nher eyes. She taught the first grade pupils in the little community, and\r\nthey literally worshipped her.\r\n\r\n“If you will give me only a little more time, I am sure that I can get\r\nthe money,” she continued, and then waited anxiously for the wizen-faced\r\nman to reply.\r\n\r\n“No, sir!” the latter answered roughly, as he rubbed his hands together\r\nand frowned upon the girl. “Business is business! I’ve been wanting that\r\nhouse of yours for several years, and now I’m going to have it, unless,”\r\nhe smiled grimly, “you bring in the money to pay off the mortgage by\r\ntomorrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“But please, Mr. Seaman, I have no money! Mother’s illness has taken\r\neverything I had and more, too, but if you will wait just a little\r\nlonger....”\r\n\r\n“That will do! That will do!” the old man spoke in a rasping voice. “I’ve\r\nbeen too good to you already. And, then, there’s that little shack at the\r\nother edge of the village. You can move into that. It won’t hurt ye.”\r\n\r\n“But I tell you that mother is too ill to be moved!” the girl spoke\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\nThe shriveled old man waved his hand in a gesture of dismissal.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you any sympathy at all?” the young woman asked in one last\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n“_Sympathy?_ Bosh! That’s all foolishness! It leads to bankruptcy. That’s\r\nwhat I always used to tell your father before he died, but no, he could\r\nnot see it that way,” the old man spoke with infinite sarcasm. “Now don’t\r\ndisturb me any longer. There’s the door!” and he waved a claw-like hand\r\nin its direction.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood irresolutely a moment, while her face alternately flushed\r\nand then grew pale. She felt once as if she could murder the heartless\r\nold skinflint as he sat at his desk. There was no way to get the money,\r\nand she perceived that she was absolutely in the hands of this merciless\r\ncreature. With rage and despair consuming her spirit, she left the room.\r\n\r\nThe next day the girl and her invalid mother were forced to leave their\r\ncozy little home, and move into the damp, decaying house at the other end\r\nof the village. Neighbors insisted that the sick woman come into their\r\nhomes, but even in her illness the invalid was too proud to do so.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later the suffering of the poor woman was at an end. Out in the\r\ncemetery a haggard girl watched the lumpy, half-frozen clods of earth\r\nfall down upon the casket and shut in forever the body of her loved\r\none. She did not leave with most of her neighbors who had attended the\r\nfuneral, but stood silent, watching the swiftly filling hole.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were dry. There were no tears left to soothe her. She had wept\r\nat the words of the minister, but now she had ceased. A fierce bitterness\r\nfilled her heart.\r\n\r\nWhen the mound had been finished, the pastor gently touched her arm,\r\nintending to lead her back to the carriage. But the girl fiercely shook\r\noff the friendly hand.\r\n\r\n“Leave me alone!” she said.\r\n\r\n“But, it is damp and cold, and I want you to ride back home. All the\r\nother vehicles have gone.”\r\n\r\n“I can walk,” she answered shortly.\r\n\r\nThe minister regarded her a moment and decided that it might be best to\r\nlet her remain. He began to retrace his steps toward his conveyance.\r\nReaching a bend in the road, he looked back, but the solitary figure was\r\nstill standing motionless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy most of the villagers Mr. Seaman was considered to be the stingiest,\r\nmost tight-fisted old skinflint that ever lived. The older he became, the\r\nmore his mercilessness seemed to increase. Even the dogs—when they saw\r\nhim coming down the street—got out of his way.\r\n\r\nThe old man lived in a small ramshackle cottage at the edge of the\r\nvillage, and no one ever visited him there. He had a little office above\r\nthe local bank, and it was in this that his callers found him when they\r\nwished to adjust money matters.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks the old man had been feeling a peculiar numbness all\r\nalong his right side. At first he paid scarcely any heed to it, but it\r\ndid not go away. As a result, he began to pinch his right leg every\r\nmorning to see whether he was any better. He could notice no improvement,\r\nand as time passed, he believed that he was getting worse.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s just because I’m gettin’ older’n I used to be,” he\r\nthought, but this did not comfort him at all.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, he determined to consult the town’s physician, and\r\nalthough he regretted wasting his money in this manner, he went up to see\r\nDr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe physician told him that it acted very much like paralysis, and that a\r\ncomplete numbness of his whole body might result. Although this might be\r\ngradual, he said, it could occur at a sudden stroke.\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not try especially to allay the old man’s fears, for he\r\nshared the popular feeling toward the miser, and he saw that he was very\r\nsusceptible to suggestion.\r\n\r\nSeaman came away very much frightened. He did not appear to fear death\r\nitself, strange as this would seem. Perhaps it never occurred to him that\r\nhis paralysis might be fatal. What really terrified him, however, was\r\nthe idea that he might be rendered incapable of making either movement\r\nor sound, and that then he would be buried alive. This thought of being\r\nlocked up in a coffin while he was not actually dead, haunted him day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn his sleep he would dream of being locked within a casket, unable to\r\nutter a word, yet comprehending all that went on around him. He could\r\nhear the dirt fall shovelful after shovelful upon the box in which he was\r\nimprisoned. He could feel the air becoming oppressive.\r\n\r\nThen he would swing his arms sideways, only to find himself shut in. He\r\nwould kick, and endeavor to lift the lid, but six feet of damp earth\r\nwould be crushing it down against his feeble efforts. He would beat\r\nfrantically upon the encircling boards, but the hard-packed earth would\r\nmuffle the sound. He could feel the pitch-blackness of his stifling tomb.\r\n\r\nHe could not see. He had used up almost all the air within his narrow\r\ncoffin. He could imagine the grave-diggers walking around complacently\r\nseveral feet above him. If he could only make them hear! He was\r\nsmothering—buried alive!\r\n\r\nWith a scream of horror he would waken, and lay panting, as he tried to\r\nrecover from his nightmare. But he could not entirely push these dreams\r\naway, for he knew that there might be some truth in them. He had already\r\nseen an article in a magazine telling of just such a case. He decided\r\nthat he must find the article again.\r\n\r\nSearching for several hours through the pile of magazines which he kept\r\nstacked within one of his small rooms, he at length came upon the story\r\nwhich he had been seeking. Although it frightened him, he could not help\r\nreading it again.\r\n\r\nHe learned that for some reason the buried man had been dug up a few\r\nweeks after his interment, and when the casket had been opened, the dead\r\nman was found lying on his stomach with one hand clutching his scalp,\r\nfrom which most of the hair had been torn off.\r\n\r\nFascinated by the horror of the tale, he found himself reading it again.\r\nHe could not help himself. For the remainder of the night he would lie\r\nthinking of the possibility that he himself might be buried alive.\r\n\r\nIn the daytime he was obsessed with this same thought. Even while he\r\nwalked down the street to his office—and he found it more difficult to\r\ndo so each day—he could clearly imagine himself so paralyzed that the\r\nneighbors might take him to be dead. Mentally he could see them gathering\r\naround his bedside. He could feel them lift him into the casket. He could\r\nfeel himself driven to the cemetery, and lowered into the cold ground,\r\nall the while powerless to cry out or show in any way that he still\r\nlived. This idea almost smothered him, even while he was wide awake.\r\n\r\nHe grew haggard because of his fear, and would go about the town\r\nmuttering to himself, and occasionally flinging out his arms, as if to\r\npush off something that seemed to be enveloping him. People thought\r\nthat he was going crazy, and, indeed, his actions tended further to\r\nsubstantiate their judgment, for he grew more queer from day to day.\r\n\r\nAt last he went back to see Dr. Jackson, and confided his fears to him.\r\nThe latter only laughed, and told him not to worry for the townspeople\r\nwould not bury him before he was entirely dead.\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” the Doctor added, “the embalming fluid will kill you if you\r\naren’t dead already.”\r\n\r\n“No! _No! No!_” screamed the terrified old man. “I won’t be embalmed! I\r\nwon’t be embalmed!” and his voice rose more shrilly at each repetition.\r\n“Promise me that you won’t let them embalm me!” he demanded, and his eyes\r\nshone wildly.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor began to place credence in the reports of the town’s gossips\r\nconcerning the old man’s madness.\r\n\r\n“But every one’s embalmed nowadays,” he explained.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to be!” the miser said fiercely, as he began to\r\nshudder. “I might not be dead for sure, and if I were not embalmed, then\r\nI could come to life again.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor finally promised that he would not permit the poisonous\r\nchemicals to be placed within the old man’s veins, in case the latter\r\nshould die.\r\n\r\n“Now there is something else I want you to promise me,” the miser went\r\non. “I have been dreaming that I shall be buried alive. Oh, but I have,”\r\nhe added, as the Doctor began to shake his head. “If I were buried in the\r\nusual manner and should wake up ...,” here he trembled, and a look of\r\nhorror spread over his face. “But I won’t be buried that way!” he yelled\r\nin a frenzy. “Promise me that you will do as I say,” he exclaimed in a\r\ntone that expressed a mixture of both command and entreaty.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?” the Doctor asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to have a bell placed near my grave with a rope leading down\r\ninto my coffin, and then, if I revive, I shall pull the cord, and ring\r\nthe bell.”\r\n\r\n“But who would hear it?” Dr. Jackson asked, as he vainly strove to check\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there is a farm house not far from the cemetery, and somebody there\r\ncould hear it, and come and dig me up.”\r\n\r\n“You’d smother before they could ever get to you,” the Doctor objected.\r\n\r\n“No! No! I have everything planned, and I have it written down so that\r\nyou can do it just as I wish. I’ll pay you now for your trouble,” and he\r\nhanded the Doctor a fifty-dollar bill. “Promise me that you will do it,”\r\nhe pleaded.\r\n\r\nDr. Jackson, thinking it all to be nonsense, nevertheless promised, and\r\nthe miser slowly hobbled off.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor thought it all a good joke, and the news soon spread about the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n“And to think,” the Doctor said to a group of men standing in front of\r\nthe little drug store, “the old tight-wad gave me this fifty to see that\r\nhis fool notions were carried out,” and he showed them the bill.\r\n\r\nThe old man was the object of a great many jokes during the ensuing\r\nweeks, but he himself was feeling much more at ease to think that the\r\nDoctor had pledged himself to carry out his wishes.\r\n\r\nThe miser’s right leg, however, was growing more and more numb. Each\r\nmorning he would pinch it to see if there were any feeling left. It\r\nbecame very difficult for him to walk; so he decided to supervise,\r\npersonally, the erection of the bell.\r\n\r\nIt was a large iron one much like the ordinary farmhouse dinner bell\r\nwhich the rural housewife uses to notify the men in the field that dinner\r\nis ready. The old man had it fastened on a post, which was set in the\r\nground near the spot which he had chosen for his grave.\r\n\r\nThe time finally came when the shriveled figure of the miser did not\r\nappear upon the street, and investigation revealed him lying upon his\r\nbed, almost wholly paralyzed. Doctor Jackson obtained one of the\r\nmiddle-aged women of the village to wait upon him, and give him his food,\r\nfor he could not even move his arms to feed himself. For a few weeks\r\nmore he lay in this helpless condition gradually becoming more and more\r\ndependent upon his nurse. One morning he failed to open his eyes, and\r\nlay motionless, giving no sign of life whatever. Dr. Jackson had a great\r\nnumber of calls to make that day, and so it was not until late in the\r\nevening that he could attend the old fellow. Tired out from his labors,\r\nthe doctor made a hasty examination, and said there was no doubt about\r\nhis being dead.\r\n\r\nNext day the Doctor gave the miser’s written instructions to his\r\nman-of-all-work, and told him to see that they were fulfilled. The latter\r\nhad a hole bored in the lid of the coffin, through which the rope was\r\nto pass. One end of it was placed in the hand of the corpse, and the\r\nremainder of the rope was pushed through a one-inch pipe, and fastened\r\nto the bell. The pipe permitted the rope to be pulled easily; otherwise\r\nthe earth would have checked it. According to the miser’s orders, another\r\ntube connected the cheap casket with the open air. This was to permit him\r\nto breathe if he should not be entirely dead.\r\n\r\nThe earth was rapidly shoveled into the opening, and in a short time a\r\nmound of yellow clay marked the old skinflint’s last abode. It was unlike\r\nother newly-made graves, however, for a rope reached out of it to the\r\nbell near by, and six inches of an air-pipe protruded.\r\n\r\nThe grave-diggers left the spot, and returned to their homes. The\r\ncemetery was deserted unless one believes that the spirits of the dead\r\nhover above the last resting place of their bodies.\r\n\r\nAbout three o’clock next morning the sleepy telephone operator in the\r\nlittle office above the drug store received a call.\r\n\r\n“Hello! Hello!” a frightened woman’s voice exclaimed. “This is Harding’s.\r\nSay, that bell over in the cemetery has been ringing for ten minutes!\r\nIt’s getting louder and louder! Call the constable or somebody quick!\r\nThere ain’t any men folks at our place now, and we’re scared to death!”\r\n\r\nThe operator was wide awake, for everybody knew the story of the burial\r\nof the old miser. She called the Doctor, but could get no response. In\r\ndesperation she called the grave-diggers, and two others to go out to\r\nthe ghostly spot. As soon as she had sent them on their weird quest, she\r\ncalled the Harding farmhouse.\r\n\r\n“That bell quit ringin’ several minutes ago!” Mrs. Harding replied. “I\r\ndon’t know what to think!”\r\n\r\nThe four men reached the dark cemetery with its eery tombstones faintly\r\nvisible all about them. Hurriedly, and with conflicting emotions, they\r\nran to the new grave. What they saw startled them so that they almost\r\nturned back!\r\n\r\nThe rope, which had been fastened to the bell, now was tied to the foot\r\nof the post. Even as they looked, they could make out a slight movement\r\nof the rope! It grew taut, and then they could see it slacken!\r\n\r\n“Gosh! He’s come back to life!” one of the men whispered hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Look! Look!” his companion almost shouted, and pointed toward the\r\nair-pipe.\r\n\r\nHow it got there, they did not know, but a bucket was forced down over\r\nthe end of the tube into the fresh earth, cutting off all the air supply\r\nfrom the coffin.\r\n\r\nOne of the grave-diggers kicked the bucket off, and then they all set to\r\nwork digging. Frantically, yet fearfully, they threw out the fresh earth.\r\nTheir lanterns cast weird shadows about them, and dimly lighted up the\r\nsomber tombstones near by. They scarcely said a word, but when they did,\r\nit was in a very low tone.\r\n\r\nThud! A shovel had at last struck the wooden box. It startled the\r\nmen. They were not any less courageous than the average, but their\r\nsurroundings and the peculiar situation in which they found themselves\r\nwould have affected the nerves of anybody.\r\n\r\nQuickly they cleared off the top of the coffin.\r\n\r\n“Hello! Are you alive?” one of them called in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n“I think Hardings imagined they heard the bell ring,” one of the men\r\nmuttered.\r\n\r\n“But didn’t we see the rope move?” another objected.\r\n\r\n“Well, you can open the lid,” the first speaker added.\r\n\r\nThey held their two lanterns down inside the pit which they had just\r\nmade. The yellow flames flickered and spluttered. The bravest of the four\r\nmen used his shovel for a lever, and pried up the coffin top.\r\n\r\nSlowly, hesitatingly, he peered inside. An unexpected movement from\r\nwithin would have caused him instantly to drop the lid.\r\n\r\nHe still could not make out the dead man’s form. Carefully he jerked the\r\ntop clear back, and the four spectators were terrified. If they had been\r\nout of the pit in which they stood it is doubtful whether they would have\r\nremained for a second glance. As it was, they were standing on the edge\r\nof the casket, and could not readily escape.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s form was turned over, and hunched up, as if he had vainly\r\nstriven to lift the tons of earth that held him a captive. His right arm\r\nwas stretched out along the side of his prison, and the nails of his\r\nfingers were torn off. The sides of the casket were clawed and scratched,\r\nand the scalp of the dead man was frightfully lacerated. All his hair had\r\nbeen pulled out by the roots and a wad of it was still fiercely clasped\r\nin the miser’s left hand.\r\n\r\nEven while they looked on a greater fear consumed them.\r\n\r\n“_Ha-ha, ha-ha_,” demoniacal laughter came to their ears.\r\n\r\nThis was too much. Clawing and scrambling, they clambered over each other\r\nin trying to get out of the pit.\r\n\r\n“_Ha-ha, ha-ha_,” the shrill laughter continued from far up the hillside.\r\n\r\nIt pursued the fleeing men. To their terrified minds the fiendish sounds\r\nseemed to be taken up and re-echoed by each of the tombstones which they\r\npassed in their flight.\r\n\r\n“Ha-ha, ha-ha! Ha-ha, ha-ha! Ha-ha, ha-ha!” The ghostly shrieks rang in\r\ntheir ears, as they raced toward the village.\r\n\r\nUnexplained, the mystery continued to frighten the superstitious for two\r\ndays after the miser had been reburied. Then a tragedy partially turned\r\ntheir attention from this weird affair.\r\n\r\nThe body of the girl whose mother had been turned out of her home, was\r\nfound floating in the river not far from the little village.\r\n\r\n“Too bad!” the Doctor had said. “She must have lost her mind brooding\r\nover her mother’s death,” and this was the consensus of opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd no one ever thought to associate the gentle young school teacher with\r\nthe fiendish laughter which had floated over the cemetery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_This Story Has a Horrifying Climax_\r\n\r\nTHE FLOOR ABOVE\r\n\r\n_By_ M. HUMPHREYS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 17, 1922.—I sat down to breakfast this morning with a good\r\nappetite. The heat seemed over, and a cool wind blew in from my garden,\r\nwhere chrysanthemums were already budding. The sunshine streamed into\r\nthe room and fell pleasantly on Mrs. O’Brien’s broad face as she brought\r\nin the eggs and coffee. For a supposedly lonely old bachelor the world\r\nseemed to me a pretty good place. I was buttering my third set of waffles\r\nwhen the housekeeper again appeared, this time with the mail.\r\n\r\nI glanced carelessly at the three or four letters beside my plate. One of\r\nthem bore a strangely familiar handwriting. I gazed at it a minute, then\r\nseized it with a beating heart. Tears almost came into my eyes. There was\r\nno doubt about it—it was Arthur Barker’s handwriting! Shaky and changed,\r\nto be sure, but ten years have passed since I have seen Arthur, or,\r\nrather, since his mysterious disappearance.\r\n\r\nFor ten years I have not had a word from him. His people know no more\r\nthan I what has become of him, and long ago we gave him up for dead. He\r\nvanished without leaving a trace behind him. It seemed to me, too, that\r\nwith him vanished the last shreds of my youth. For Arthur was my dearest\r\nfriend in that happy time. We were boon companions, and many a mad prank\r\nwe played together.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after ten years of silence, Arthur was writing to me!\r\n\r\nThe envelope was postmarked Baltimore. Almost reluctantly—for I feared\r\nwhat it might contain—I passed my finger under the flap and opened it. It\r\nheld a single sheet of paper torn from a pad. But it was Arthur’s writing:\r\n\r\n    “_Dear Tom: Old man, can you run down to see me for a few days?\r\n    I’m afraid I’m in a bad way. ARTHUR._”\r\n\r\nScrawled across the bottom was the address, _536 N. Marathon street_.\r\n\r\nI have often visited Baltimore, but I cannot recall a street of that name.\r\n\r\nOf course I shall go.... But what a strange letter after ten years! There\r\nis something almost uncanny about it.\r\n\r\nI shall go tomorrow evening. I cannot possibly get off before then.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeptember 18.—I am leaving tonight. Mrs. O’Brien has packed my two\r\nsuitcases, and everything is in readiness for my departure. Ten minutes\r\nago I handed her the keys and she went off tearfully. She has been\r\nsniffling all day and I have been perplexed, for a curious thing occurred\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\nIt was about Arthur’s letter. Yesterday, when I had finished reading it,\r\nI took it to my desk and placed it in a small compartment together with\r\nother personal papers. I remember distinctly that it was on top, with a\r\nlavender card from my sister directly underneath. This morning I went to\r\nget it. It was gone.\r\n\r\nThere was the lavender card exactly where I had seen it, but Arthur’s\r\nletter had completely disappeared. I turned everything upside down, then\r\ncalled Mrs. O’Brien and we both searched, but in vain. Mrs. O’Brien, in\r\nspite of all I could say, took it upon herself to feel that I suspected\r\nher.... But what could have become of it? Fortunately I remember the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeptember 19.—I have arrived. I have seen Arthur. Even now he is in the\r\nnext room and I am supposed to be preparing for bed. But something tells\r\nme I shall not sleep a wink this night. I am strangely wrought up, though\r\nthere is not the shadow of an excuse for my excitement. I should be\r\nrejoicing to have found my friend again. And yet....\r\n\r\nI reached Baltimore this morning at eleven o’clock. The day was warm\r\nand beautiful, and I loitered outside the station a few minutes before\r\ncalling a taxi. The driver seemed well acquainted with the street I gave\r\nhim, and we rolled off across the bridge.\r\n\r\nAs I drew near my destination, I began to feel anxious and afraid.\r\nBut the ride lasted longer than I expected—Marathon Street seemed to\r\nbe located in the suburbs of the city. At last we turned into a dusty\r\nstreet, paved only in patches and lined with linden and aspen trees. The\r\nfallen leaves crunched beneath the tires. The September sun beat down\r\nwith a white intensity. The taxi drew up before a house in the middle of\r\na block that boasted not more than six dwellings. On each side of the\r\nhouse was a vacant lot, and it was set far back at the end of a long\r\nnarrow yard crowded with trees.\r\n\r\nI paid the driver, opened the gate and went in. The trees were so thick\r\nthat not until I was half way up the path did I get a good view of the\r\nhouse. It was three stories high, built of brick, in fairly good repair,\r\nbut lonely and deserted-looking. The blinds were closed in all of the\r\nwindows with the exception of two, one on the first, one on the second\r\nfloor. Not a sign of life anywhere, not a cat nor a milk bottle to break\r\nthe monotony of the leaves that carpeted the porch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut, overcoming my feeling of uneasiness, I resolutely set my suitcase on\r\nthe porch, caught at the old-fashioned bell, and gave an energetic jerk.\r\nA startling peal jangled through the silence. I waited, but there was no\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute I rang again. Then from the interior I heard a queer\r\ndragging sound, as if someone was coming slowly down the hall. The knob\r\nwas turned and the door opened. I saw before me an old woman, wrinkled,\r\nwithered, and filmy-eyed, who leaned on a crutch.\r\n\r\n“Does Mr. Barker live here?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, staring at me in a curious way, but made no move to invite me\r\nin.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve come to see him,” I said. “I’m a friend of his. He sent for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nAt that she drew slightly aside.\r\n\r\n“He’s upstairs,” she said in a cracked voice that was little more than a\r\nwhisper. “I can’t show you up. Hain’t been up a stair now in ten year.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” I replied, and, seizing my suitcase, I strode down\r\nthe long hall.\r\n\r\n“At the head of the steps,” came the whispering voice behind me. “The\r\ndoor at the end of the hall.”\r\n\r\nI climbed the cold dark stairway, passed along the short hall at the top,\r\nand stood before a closed door. I knocked.\r\n\r\n“Come in.” It was Arthur’s voice, and yet—not his.\r\n\r\nI opened the door and saw Arthur sitting on a couch, his shoulders\r\nhunched over, his eyes raised to mine.\r\n\r\nAfter all, ten years had not changed him so much. As I remembered him,\r\nhe was of medium height, inclined to be stout, and ruddy-faced with keen\r\ngray eyes. He was still stout, but had lost his color, and his eyes had\r\ndulled.\r\n\r\n“And where have you been all this time?” I demanded, when the first\r\ngreetings were over.\r\n\r\n“Here,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“In this house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t you let us hear from you?”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be making an effort to speak.\r\n\r\n“What did it matter? I didn’t suppose any one cared.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was my imagination, but I could not get rid of the thought\r\nthat Arthur’s pale eyes fixed tenaciously upon my face, were trying to\r\ntell me something, something quite different from what his lips said.\r\n\r\nI felt chilled. Although the blinds were open, the room was almost\r\ndarkened by the branches of the trees that pressed against the window.\r\nArthur had not given me his hand, had seemed troubled to know how to make\r\nme welcome. Yet of one thing I was certain: He needed me and he wanted me\r\nto know he needed me.\r\n\r\nAs I took a chair I glanced about the room. It was a typical\r\nlodging-house room, medium sized, flowered wall paper, worn matting,\r\nnondescript rugs, a wash-stand in one corner, a chiffonier in another, a\r\ntable in the center, two or three chairs, and the couch which evidently\r\nserved Arthur as a bed. But it was cold, strangely cold for such a warm\r\nday.\r\n\r\nArthur’s eyes had wandered uneasily to my suitcase. He made an effort to\r\ndrag himself to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Your room is back here,” he said, with a motion of his thumb.\r\n\r\n“No, wait,” I protested. “Let’s talk about yourself first. What’s wrong?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been sick.”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you a doctor? If not, I’ll get one.”\r\n\r\nAt this he started up with the first sign of animation he had shown.\r\n\r\n“No, Tom, don’t do it. Doctors can’t help me now. Besides, I hate them.\r\nI’m afraid of them.”\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed away, and I took pity on his agitation. I decided to\r\nlet the question of doctors drop for the moment.\r\n\r\n“As you say,” I assented carelessly.\r\n\r\nWithout more ado, I followed him into my room, which adjoined his and\r\nwas furnished in much the same fashion. But there were two windows, one\r\non each side, looking out on the vacant lots. Consequently, there was\r\nmore light, for which I was thankful. In a far corner I noticed a door,\r\nheavily bolted.\r\n\r\n“There’s one more room,” said Arthur, as I deposited my belongings. “One\r\nthat you’ll like. But we’ll have to go through the bath-room.”\r\n\r\nGroping our way through the musty bath-room, in which a tiny jet of gas\r\nwas flickering, we stepped into a large, almost luxurious chamber. It was\r\na library, well-furnished, carpeted, and surrounded by shelves fairly\r\nbulging with books. But for the chillness and bad light, it was perfect.\r\nAs I moved about, Arthur followed me with his eyes.\r\n\r\n“There are some rare works on botany—”\r\n\r\nI had already discovered them, a set of books that I would have given\r\nmuch to own. I could not contain my joy.\r\n\r\n“You won’t be so bored browsing around in here—”\r\n\r\nIn spite of my preoccupation, I pricked up my ears. In that monotonous\r\nvoice there was no sympathy with my joy. It was cold and tired.\r\n\r\nWhen I had satisfied my curiosity we returned to the front room, and\r\nArthur flung himself, or rather fell, upon the couch. It was nearly five\r\no’clock and quite dark. As I lighted the gas, I heard a sound below as of\r\nsomebody thumping on the wall.\r\n\r\n“That’s the old woman,” Arthur explained. “She cooks my meals, but she’s\r\ntoo lame to bring them up.”\r\n\r\nHe made a feeble attempt at rising, but I saw he was worn out.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stir,” I warned him. “I’ll bring up your food tonight.”\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, I found the dinner appetizing and well-cooked, and, in\r\nspite of the fact that I did not like the looks of the old woman, I ate\r\nwith relish. Arthur barely touched a few spoonfuls of soup to his lips\r\nand absently crumbled some bread in his plate.\r\n\r\nDirectly I had carried off the dishes, he wrapped his reddish-brown\r\ndressing-gown about him, stretched out at full length on the couch, and\r\nasked me to turn out the gas. When I had complied with his request, I\r\nagain heard his weak voice asking if I had everything I needed.\r\n\r\n“Everything,” I assured him, and then there was unbroken silence.\r\n\r\nI went to my room, finally, closed the door, and here I am sitting\r\nrestlessly between the two back windows that look out on the vacant lots.\r\n\r\nI have unpacked my clothes and turned down the bed, but I cannot make up\r\nmy mind to retire. If the truth be told, I hate to put out the light....\r\nThere is something disturbing in the way the dry leaves tap on the panes.\r\nAnd my heart is sad when I think of Arthur.\r\n\r\nI have found my old friend, but he is no longer my old friend. Why does\r\nhe fix his pale eyes so strangely on my face? What does he wish to tell\r\nme?\r\n\r\nBut these are morbid thoughts. I will put them out of my head. I will go\r\nto bed and get a good night’s rest. And tomorrow I will wake up finding\r\neverything right and as it should be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeptember 26.—Have been here a week today, and I have settled down to\r\nthis queer existence as if I had never known another. The day after my\r\narrival I discovered that the third volume of the botanical series was\r\ndone in Latin, which I have set myself the task of translating. It is\r\nabsorbing work, and when I have buried myself in one of the deep chairs\r\nby the library table, the hours fly fast.\r\n\r\nFor health’s sake I force myself to walk a few miles every day. I have\r\ntried to prevail on Arthur to do likewise, but he, who used to be so\r\nactive, now refuses to budge from the house. No wonder he is literally\r\nblue! For it is a fact that his complexion and the shadows about his eyes\r\nand temples, are decidedly blue.\r\n\r\nWhat does he do with himself all day? Whenever I enter his room, he is\r\nlying on the couch, a book beside him, which he never reads. He does\r\nnot seem to suffer any pain, for he never complains. After several\r\nineffectual attempts to get medical aid for him, I have given up\r\nmentioning the subject of a doctor. I feel that his trouble is more\r\nmental than physical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeptember 28.—A rainy day. It has been coming down in floods since dawn.\r\nAnd I got a queer turn this afternoon.\r\n\r\nAs I could not get out for my walk, I spent the morning staging a general\r\nhouse-cleaning. It was time! Dust and dirt everywhere. The bath-room,\r\nwhich has no window and is lighted by gas, was fairly overrun with\r\nwater-bugs and roaches. Of course I did not penetrate to Arthur’s room,\r\nbut I heard no sound from him as I swept and dusted.\r\n\r\nI made a good dinner and settled down in the library, feeling quite cosy.\r\nThe rain came down steadily and it had grown so cold that I decided to\r\nmake a fire later on. But once I had gathered my tablets and notebooks\r\nabout me I forgot the cold.\r\n\r\nI remember I was on the subject of the _Aster Tripolium_, a rare variety\r\nseldom found in this country. Turning a page, I came upon a specimen of\r\nthis very variety, dried, pressed flat, and pasted to the margin. Above\r\nit, in Arthur’s handwriting, I read:\r\n\r\n_September 27, 1912._\r\n\r\nI was bending close to examine it, when I felt a vague fear. It seemed to\r\nme that someone was in the room and was watching me. Yet I had not heard\r\nthe door open, nor seen anyone enter. I turned sharply and saw Arthur,\r\nwrapped in his reddish-brown dressing-gown, standing at my very elbow.\r\n\r\nHe was smiling—smiling for the first time since my arrival, and his dull\r\neyes were bright. But I did not like that smile. In spite of myself I\r\njerked away from him. He pointed at the aster.\r\n\r\n“It grew in the front yard under a linden tree. I found it yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday!” I shouted, my nerves on edge. “Good Lord man! Look! It was\r\nten years ago!”\r\n\r\nThe smile faded from his face.\r\n\r\n“Ten years ago,” he repeated thickly. “_Ten years ago?_”\r\n\r\nAnd with his hand pressed against his forehead, he went out of the room\r\nstill muttering, “_Ten years ago!_”...\r\n\r\nAs for me, this foolish incident has preyed on my mind and kept me from\r\ndoing any satisfactory work.... _September 27th_.... It is true, that was\r\nalso yesterday—ten years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 1.—One o’clock. A cheerful morning this has been, the sun shining\r\nbrightly, and a touch of frost in the air. I put in an excellent day’s\r\nwork in the library yesterday, and on the first mail this morning came a\r\nletter from Mrs. O’Brien. She says the _Scarab_ chrysanthemums are in\r\nfull bloom. I must positively run up for a day before they are gone.\r\n\r\nAs I lighted a cigar after breakfast, I happened to glance over at Arthur\r\nand was struck by a change in him. For he _has_ changed. I ask myself\r\nif my presence has not done him good. On my arrival he seemed without\r\nenergy, almost torpid, but now he is becoming restless. He wanders about\r\nthe room continually and sometimes shows a disposition to talk.\r\n\r\nYes, I am sure he is better. I am going for my walk now, and I feel\r\nconvinced that in a week’s time I shall have him accompanying me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive o’clock. Dusk is falling. O God! What has come over me? Am I the\r\nsame man that went out of this house three hours ago? And what has\r\nhappened!...\r\n\r\nI had a splendid walk, and was striding homeward in a fine glow. But as I\r\nturned the corner and came in sight of the house, it was as if I looked\r\nat death itself. I could hardly drag myself up the stairs, and when I\r\npeered into the shadowy chamber, and saw the man hunched up on the couch,\r\nwith his eyes fixed intently on my face, I could have screamed like a\r\nwoman. I wanted to fly, to rush out into the clear cold air and run—to\r\nrun and never come back! But I controlled myself, forced my feet to carry\r\nme to my room.\r\n\r\nThere is a weight of hopelessness at my heart. The darkness is advancing,\r\nswallowing up everything, but I have not the will to light the gas....\r\n\r\nNow there is a flicker in the front room. I am a fool; I must pull myself\r\ntogether. Arthur is lighting up, and downstairs I can hear the thumping\r\nthat announces dinner....\r\n\r\nIt is a queer thought that comes to me now, but it is odd I have not\r\nnoticed it before. We are about to sit down to our evening meal. Arthur\r\nwill eat practically nothing for he has no appetite. Yet he remains\r\nstout. It cannot be healthy fat, but even at that it seems to me that a\r\nman who eats as little as he does would become a living skeleton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 5.—Positively, I must see a doctor about myself, or soon I shall\r\nbe a nervous wreck. I am acting like a child. Last night I lost all\r\ncontrol and played the coward.\r\n\r\nI had gone to bed early, tired out with a hard day’s work. It was raining\r\nagain, and as I lay in bed I watched the little rivulets trickling down\r\nthe panes. Lulled by the sighing of the wind among the leaves, I fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nI awoke (how long afterward I cannot say) to feel a cold hand laid on my\r\narm. For a moment I lay paralyzed with terror. I would have cried aloud,\r\nbut I had no voice. At last I managed to sit up, to shake the hand off. I\r\nreached for the matches and lighted the gas.\r\n\r\nIt was Arthur who stood by my bed—Arthur wrapped in his eternal\r\nreddish-brown dressing-gown. He was excited. His blue face had a yellow\r\ntinge, and his eyes gleamed in the light.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” he whispered.\r\n\r\nI listened but I heard nothing.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you hear it?” he gasped, and he pointed upward.\r\n\r\n“Upstairs?” I stammered. “Is there somebody upstairs?”\r\n\r\nI strained my ears, and at last I fancied I could hear a fugitive sound\r\nlike the light tapping of footsteps.\r\n\r\n“It must be somebody walking about up there,” I suggested.\r\n\r\nBut at these words Arthur seemed to stiffen. The excitement died out of\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“No!” he cried in a sharp rasping voice. “No! It is nobody walking about\r\nup there!”\r\n\r\nAnd he fled into his room.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I lay trembling, afraid to move. But at last, fearing for\r\nArthur, I got up and crept to his door. He was lying on the couch, with\r\nhis face in the moonlight, apparently asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 6.—I had a talk with Arthur today. Yesterday I could not bring\r\nmyself to speak of the previous night’s happening, but all of this\r\nnonsense must be cleared away.\r\n\r\nWe were in the library. A fire was burning in the grate, and Arthur\r\nhad his feet on the fender. The slippers he wears, by the way, are as\r\nobjectionable to me as his dressing-gown. They are felt slippers, old and\r\nworn, and frayed around the edges as if they had been gnawed by rats. I\r\ncannot imagine why he does not get a new pair.\r\n\r\n“Say, old man,” I began abruptly, “do you own this house?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you rent any of it?”\r\n\r\n“Downstairs—to Mrs. Harlan.”\r\n\r\n“But upstairs?”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, then shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No, it’s inconvenient. There’s only a peculiar way to get upstairs.”\r\n\r\nI was struck by this.\r\n\r\n“By jove! you’re right. Where’s the staircase?”\r\n\r\nHe looked me full in the eyes.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember seeing a bolted door in a corner of your room? The\r\nstaircase runs from that door.”\r\n\r\nI did remember it, and somehow the memory made me uncomfortable. I said\r\nno more and decided not to refer to what had happened that night. It\r\noccurred to me that Arthur might have been walking in his sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 8.—When I went for my walk on Tuesday I dropped in and saw Dr.\r\nLorraine, who is an old friend. He expressed some surprise at my run-down\r\ncondition and wrote me a prescription.\r\n\r\nI am planning to go home next week. How pleasant it will be to walk in my\r\ngarden and listen to Mrs. O’Brien singing in the kitchen!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 9.—Perhaps I had better postpone my trip. I casually mentioned it\r\nto Arthur this morning.\r\n\r\nHe was lying relaxed on the sofa, but when I spoke of leaving he sat up\r\nas straight as a bolt. His eyes fairly blazed.\r\n\r\n“No, Tom, don’t go!” There was terror in his voice, and such pleading\r\nthat it wrung my heart.\r\n\r\n“You’ve stood it alone here ten years,” I protested. “And now—”\r\n\r\n“It’s not that,” he said. “But if you go, you will never come back.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all the faith you have in me?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got faith, Tom. But if you go, you’ll never come back.”\r\n\r\nI decided that I must humor the vagaries of a sick man.\r\n\r\n“All right,” I agreed. “I’ll not go. Anyway, not for some time.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 12.—What is it that hangs over this house like a cloud? For I\r\ncan no longer deny that there _is_ something—something indescribably\r\noppressive. It seems to pervade the whole neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAre all the houses on this block vacant? If not, why do I never see\r\nchildren playing in the street? Why are passers-by so rare? And why, when\r\nfrom the front window I do catch a glimpse of one, is he hastening away\r\nas fast as possible?\r\n\r\nI am feeling blue again. I know that I need a change, and this morning I\r\ntold Arthur definitely that I was going.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise he made no objection. In fact, he murmured a word of\r\nassent and smiled. He smiled as he smiled in the library that morning\r\nwhen he pointed at the _Aster Tripolium_. And I don’t like that smile.\r\nAnyway, it is settled. I shall go next week, Thursday, the 19th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 13.—I had a strange dream last night. Or was it a dream? It was\r\nso vivid.... All day long I have been seeing it over and over again.\r\n\r\nIn my dream I thought that I was lying there in my bed. The moon was\r\nshining brightly into the room, so that each piece of furniture stood\r\nout distinctly. The bureau is so placed that when I am lying on my back,\r\nwith my head high on the pillow, I can see full into the mirror.\r\n\r\nI thought I was lying in this manner and staring into the mirror. In this\r\nway I saw the bolted door in the far corner of the room. I tried to keep\r\nmy mind off it, to think of something else, but it drew my eyes like a\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that someone was in the room, a vague figure that I could\r\nnot recognize. It approached the door and caught at the bolts. It dragged\r\nat them and struggled, but in vain—they would not give way.\r\n\r\nThen it turned and showed me its agonized face. It was Arthur! I\r\nrecognized his reddish-brown dressing-gown.\r\n\r\nI sat up in bed and cried to him, but he was gone. I ran to his room, and\r\nthere he was, stretched out in the moonlight asleep. It must have been a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 15.—We are having Indian Summer weather now—almost oppressively\r\nwarm. I have been wandering about all day, unable to settle down to\r\nanything. This morning I felt so lonesome that when I took the breakfast\r\ndishes down, I tried to strike up a conversation with Mrs. Harlan.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have found her as solemn and uncommunicative as the Sphinx,\r\nbut as she took the tray from my hands, her wrinkles broke into the\r\nsemblance of a smile. Positively at that moment it seemed to me that she\r\nresembled Arthur. Was it her smile, or the expression of her eyes? Has\r\nshe, also, something to tell me?\r\n\r\n“Don’t you get lonesome here?” I asked her sympathetically.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I’m used to it now. I couldn’t stand it anywheres else.”\r\n\r\n“And do you expect to go on living here the rest of your life?”\r\n\r\n“That may not be very long, sir,” she said, and smiled again.\r\n\r\nHer words were simple enough, but the way she looked at me when she\r\nuttered them seemed to give them a double meaning. She hobbled away, and\r\nI went upstairs and wrote Mrs. O’Brien to expect me early on the morning\r\nof the 19th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 18, 10 a. m.—Am catching the twelve o’clock train tonight. Thank\r\nGod, I had the resolution to get away! I believe another week of this\r\nlife would drive me mad. And perhaps Arthur is right—perhaps I shall\r\nnever come back.\r\n\r\nI ask myself if I have become such a weakling as that, to desert him when\r\nhe needs me most. I don’t know. I don’t recognize myself any longer....\r\n\r\nBut of course I will be back. There is the translation, for one thing,\r\nwhich is coming along famously. I could never forgive myself for dropping\r\nit at the most vital point.\r\n\r\nAs for Arthur, when I return, I intend to give in to him no longer. I\r\nwill make myself master here and cure him against his will. Fresh air,\r\nchange of scene, a good doctor, these are the things he needs.\r\n\r\nBut what is his malady? Is it the influence of this house that has fallen\r\non him like a blight? One might imagine so, since it is having the same\r\neffect on me.\r\n\r\nYes, I have reached that point where I no longer sleep. At night I lie\r\nawake and try to keep my eyes off the mirror across the room. But in\r\nthe end I always find myself staring into it—watching the door with the\r\nheavy bolts. I long to rise from the bed and draw back the bolts, but I’m\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\nHow slowly the day goes by! The night will never come!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNine p. m.—Have packed my suitcase and put the room in order. Arthur must\r\nbe asleep.... I’m afraid the parting from him will be painful. I shall\r\nleave here at eleven o’clock in order to give myself plenty of time....\r\nIt is beginning to rain....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOctober 19.—At last! It has come! I am mad! I knew it! I felt it creeping\r\non me all the time! Have I not lived in this house a month? Have I not\r\nseen—. To have seen what I have seen, to have lived for a month as I have\r\nlived, one _must_ be mad....\r\n\r\nIt was ten o’clock. I was waiting impatiently for the last hour to pass.\r\nI had seated myself in a rocking-chair by the bed, my suitcase beside\r\nme, my back to the mirror. The rain no longer fell. I must have dozed off.\r\n\r\nBut all at once I was wide awake, my heart beating furiously. Something\r\nhad touched me. I leapt to my feet, and, turning sharply, my eyes fell\r\nupon the mirror. In it I saw the door just as I had seen it the other\r\nnight, and the figure fumbling with the bolt. I wheeled around, but there\r\nwas nothing there.\r\n\r\nI told myself that I was dreaming again, that Arthur was asleep in his\r\nbed. But I trembled as I opened the door of his room and peered in. The\r\nroom was empty, the bed not even crumpled. Lighting a match, I groped my\r\nway through the bath-room into the library.\r\n\r\nThe moon had come from under a cloud and was pouring in a silvery flood\r\nthrough the windows, but Arthur was not there. I stumbled back into my\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe moon was there, too.... And the door, the door in the corner was half\r\nopen. The bolt had been drawn. In the darkness I could just make out a\r\nflight of steps that wound upward.\r\n\r\nI could no longer hesitate. Striking another match, I climbed the black\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the top I found myself in total darkness, for the blinds\r\nwere tightly closed. Realizing that the room was probably a duplicate of\r\nthe one below, I felt along the wall until I came to the gas jet. For a\r\nmoment the flame flickered, then burned bright and clear.\r\n\r\nO God! what was it I saw? A table, thick with dust, and something wrapped\r\nin a reddish-brown dressing-gown, that sat with its elbows propped upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHow long had it been sitting there that it had grown more dry than the\r\ndust upon the table! For how many thousands of days and nights had the\r\nflesh rotted from that grinning skull!\r\n\r\nIn its bony fingers it still clutched a pencil. In front of it lay a\r\nsheet of scratch paper, yellow with age. With trembling fingers I brushed\r\naway the dust. It was dated _October 19, 1912_. It read:\r\n\r\n    “_Dear Tom: Old man, can you run down to see me for a few days?\r\n    I’m afraid I’m in a bad way—_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReads Story of Mankind on Egyptian Coffins\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. James H. Breasted, Egyptologist and director of the Haskell\r\nOriental Museum at the University of Chicago, is solving some of the\r\nmysteries of the beginning of the human race by inspecting sarcophagi of\r\nEgyptian kings. From Cairo, he wrote to his associate, Dr. William S.\r\nEdgerton:\r\n\r\n“You will be interested to know that Gardener and I have settled\r\ndown at the museum and have already devoted a week to the task we\r\nare undertaking. We have a very large amount of space placed at our\r\ndisposal, and our gallery, over 100 feet long, is already filled with\r\ndismounted coffins. The photographer is busily at work, and Gardener and\r\nI are copying industriously. The task proved to be far larger than we\r\nhad anticipated and also very much more difficult. It will be a matter\r\nof years, but I have never been more convinced of its necessity and\r\nusefulness than now.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Here’s a Grotesque, Fantastic Tale_\r\n\r\nPENELOPE\r\n\r\n_By_ Vincent Starrett\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMy friend Raymond is a fascinating fellow—a compendium of useless and\r\nentertaining lore.\r\n\r\nI can not think of a better companion for an evening with what the\r\nancients felicitously called “pipe and bowl.” When the latter is empty\r\nand the former going like a blast furnace, Raymond is the equal of any\r\nraconteur under the sun, moon and stars. A great fellow, indeed!\r\n\r\nAnd the sun, moon and stars, incidentally, are his familiars. They are\r\nno more puzzling to him than a railway time-table; much less, in fact.\r\nOccasionally, he lectures, and that is his only fault. I mean that his\r\nconversation by degrees slips from its informal, negligée ease and takes\r\non the rhetoric of the classroom. How he can talk! I shall never forget\r\nhis exposition of his theory of the wireless composition of the Absolute.\r\n\r\nNo matter! As a rule he is sound—although invariably he is outside\r\nthe pale. Had he cared to do so, he might have strung a kite-tail\r\nof alphabetic degrees after his name, years ago; but he scorns such\r\ntrappings. Orthodox science, of course, will have none of him; he knows\r\ntoo much. Grayfield of Anaconda University once said of him: “Raymond\r\nknows more things that aren’t so than any man I ever met.”\r\n\r\nAgain, no matter! The heresy of today is the orthodoxy of tomorrow, and\r\nthe radical of yesterday is the conservative of today. Thus does the\r\nworld progress—toward what? Perhaps insanity!\r\n\r\nWe sat at a table in my rooms and talked; that is, Raymond talked. I\r\nlistened. It made no difference what was said; it was all entertaining\r\nand amusing, and I had not seen him for a fortnight. When, quite\r\nsuddenly, his voice ceased, it was as if a powerful, natural flow of\r\nwater had been interrupted in its course.\r\n\r\nI looked at him across the table, and was in time to see him squeeze the\r\nlast golden drop from his glass and set down the tumbler with a sigh. His\r\nhand trembled. Instinctively, we both looked at the bottle. It was empty.\r\n\r\n“It is glorious!” said Raymond. “I have not felt so light-headed since\r\nPenelope was in perihelion.”\r\n\r\nI looked at him suspiciously. I had always claimed that Raymond’s\r\nclearest view of the stars was through a colored bottle used as a\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and unsteadily crossed the floor to collapse\r\nupon a couch. In an instant he was asleep and snoring. It was the\r\npromptest performance by the man that I had ever seen, and I was lost in\r\nadmiration. But as my wife was due at any moment, I withheld my wonder\r\nand shook him into wakefulness. After a bit he sat up with a stare.\r\n\r\n“Give us an arm, old chap,” he murmured; and after a moment: “The heat\r\nhere is awful.”\r\n\r\nI assisted him to his feet, and we ricocheted to the balcony upon which\r\nlong doors opened at the front of the room. The light breeze impinged\r\npleasantly upon our senses. We were two floors up, and from somewhere\r\nbelow ascended the strains of a banjo played pianissimo.\r\n\r\nRaymond draped a long arm across my shoulders and, thus fortified, closed\r\none eye and looked into the heavens. The other arm described an arc and\r\ndeveloped a rigid finger, pointing upward.\r\n\r\n“Look!” he said. “It is the star Penelope!”\r\n\r\nI restrained an inclination to laugh. “Which?” I asked, although it was\r\nquite clear that Raymond was drunk.\r\n\r\nHe indicated, and I allowed myself to be persuaded that I saw it.\r\nPenelope, I learned later, is a small star of about the thirtieth\r\nmagnitude, which, on a clear night and with a powerful glass, may be\r\npicked up midway between the constellations of the Pleiades and Ursa\r\nMajor. It is a comparatively insignificant star, and that Raymond\r\nactually saw it I still greatly doubt.\r\n\r\nBut the sight, real or fancied, was tonic. It was as if that remote point\r\nof fire had thrilled him with a life-ray. He straightened, sobered,\r\nbecame grave. The pointing finger was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n“Diccon,” he said, giving me a familiar and affectionate pseudonym, “I\r\nhave never told you of my connection with the star Penelope. There are\r\nfew that know. Those whom I have told have looked upon me as mad. If I\r\nhave concealed from you this, my strangest adventure, you must believe\r\nthat it was because I valued your opinion of my sanity. Tonight——”\r\n\r\nAgain he turned his gaze upward, and I pretended to see that distant\r\nstar. His voice became reminiscent, introspective.\r\n\r\n“Penelope,” he whispered, “Penelope! Only yesterday it seems that you\r\nwere under my feet!”\r\n\r\nHe suddenly turned.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he commanded. “Come into the house. I feel that I must tell you\r\ntonight.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaswell [began my friend Raymond], I shall not ask your belief; to you\r\nthe tale will seem incredible. I shall ask only your attention and—your\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nThe star Penelope is my natal star. Born under its baleful influence, I\r\nhave been subjected to that influence ever since. You will recall that\r\nmy father before me was deeply interested in astronomy, so deeply that\r\nhis researches gained him the jealous enmity of the world’s greatest\r\nscientists—“Mad Raymond,” they called him.\r\n\r\nYou will also recall that he died in an asylum; but, my dear Haswell,\r\nhe was no more mad than I. But there is no denying that his astounding\r\nknowledge, and the equally astounding inferences and deductions he drew\r\ntherefrom, made him a marked man in his day. It is dangerous to be a\r\nhundred years ahead of one’s fellows.\r\n\r\nMy father discovered the star Penelope, and—as if a strange pre-natal\r\ninfluence thus had been brought to bear upon his parenthood—it was my\r\nnatal star. The circumstance was sufficient to enlist his whole interest,\r\nafter my birth, in the star Penelope. He had calculated that its orbit\r\nwas so vast that fifty years would be required to complete it. I was with\r\nmy father when he died, and his last words to me were:\r\n\r\n“Beware of Penelope when in perihelion.”\r\n\r\nHe died shortly afterward, and it was little enough that I could learn of\r\nhis thought; but from his dying whispers I gathered that with Penelope\r\nin perihelion a sinister influence would enter my life. The star would\r\nthen possess its greatest power over me for evil. The exact nature of its\r\neffect I think he could not himself foretell or even guess, but he feared\r\na material change that would affect not only my mental but my physical\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nMy father’s warning was uttered ten years ago, and I have never forgotten\r\nit. And through the long, silent nights—following his footsteps—I watched\r\nthe relentless approach of the star which was to have so fateful an\r\ninfluence upon my destiny.\r\n\r\nThree years ago I insensibly became aware of its proximity. As it came\r\nnearer it seemed that little messengers were sent forth to herald its\r\ncoming. Like a shadow cast before, I recognized—I felt—the adumbrations\r\nof its power. Little whispers of its influence crossed the distances and\r\nreached me before its central intelligence was felt in all its terror.\r\n\r\nI struggled against it, as a man frantically seeks to escape the coiling\r\ntentacles of a monster irresistibly drawing him nearer. I feared that\r\nI would commit some dreadful crime, or that I would go mad—knowing that\r\neither would have been a relief. And there was no one to whom I could\r\ntell my appalling apprehensions. The merest whisper of my situation would\r\nhave branded me a lunatic.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago I set myself the task of calculating the exact time when\r\nthe star Penelope would attain its perihelion with our sun, and a long\r\nseries of computations assured me that on the twenty-sixth day of the\r\nfollowing October Penelope would be in the zenith.\r\n\r\nThat was a year ago last October. Perhaps you will recall that for a week\r\nI was absent from my usual haunts? When you saw me later you asked where\r\nI had been, and remarked that I was looking peaked. I said I had been out\r\nof town, but I lied. I had been in hiding in my rooms—not that I believed\r\nfour walls could avert the impending disaster, whatever it might be, but\r\nto avert from my friends and from the public the possible consequences of\r\nmy deeds.\r\n\r\nI shut myself in my study, locked the door, and threw the key out of the\r\nwindow. Then, alone and unaided, I sat down to await the moment and the\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nTo divert my mind, I attacked a problem which always had bothered me and\r\nwhich, indeed, still remains unsolved. In the midst of my calculations,\r\novercome with weariness and lack of sleep, I sank into a profound\r\nslumber. My dreams were hideous. Then, suddenly, I awoke, with a dizzy\r\nfeeling of falling.\r\n\r\nHow shall I tell you what I saw? It seemed that while I slept the room\r\nhad been entered and cleared of its furniture. No vestige of impedimenta\r\nremained. Even the carpet was gone, and I was lying at full length on the\r\nfloor, the boards of which had been replaced with plaster and whitewash.\r\n\r\nThe room seemed stifling, and, remembering that I had left the window\r\nslightly down for ventilation, I stood up and walked across to it. It\r\nstood close down, almost against the floor—an extraordinary removal—and\r\nwhoever had emptied the room also had closed the window at the top and\r\nopened it at the bottom. I had to kneel down to lean out across the sill.\r\n\r\nI am telling all this calmly. Perhaps you will imagine the state of my\r\nmind, however. I was far indeed from calm. There are no words to tell you\r\nmy bewilderment. But if I had been amazed by the condition of the room,\r\nI was confounded when I looked out into the night. I was literally so\r\nfrightened that I could not utter a sound.\r\n\r\nI had looked down, expecting to look into the street; and there were the\r\nstars shining below me, millions of miles away. And yet the noises of the\r\nstreet fell distinctly on my ears. The earth seemed to have melted away\r\nbeneath my dwelling, which apparently hung upside down in the sky; but\r\nthe sounds of traffic and human voices were all about me.\r\n\r\nA horror that made me dizzy had crept over me, but, gripping the narrow\r\nsill with both hands, I twisted my face fearfully upward. Then for the\r\nfirst time a scream left my lips.\r\n\r\nAbove me, not thirty feet away, was the street filled with its accustomed\r\nhum and populated with people and with traffic—all upside down.\r\n\r\nMen and women walked the pavement, head downward, as a fly walks the\r\nceiling. Automobiles rolled past in frantic procession, their tops toward\r\nme, their wheels miraculously clinging to the overhanging roadway.\r\n\r\nYou, by this time, will have comprehended what had happened. I did not.\r\nFrightened, bewildered, half-mad, I drew in my head and fell back upon\r\nthe whitewashed floor; and then, as I lay there upon my back, I saw what\r\nI had not seen before. On the ceiling of the room, clinging to it, head\r\ndownward as the motors had clung to the street, was the missing furniture\r\nof my study.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged precisely as I had left it, except that it was _upside\r\ndown_ and appeared to have changed sides. The heavy desk at which I had\r\nsat hung directly over me, and with a gasp of terror I jumped aside; I\r\nthought that it would fall and crush me. The missing carpet was spread\r\nacross the ceiling, and the tables and chairs reposed upon it; the books\r\non table and bookcase hung easily from the under-surface, and none fell.\r\n\r\nI pulled out my watch, and it slipped from my hand and shot upward the\r\nlength of the chain. When I had recovered it, I looked at the hour, and\r\neverything that I wished to know flashed over me.\r\n\r\n_It was midnight, and Penelope was in perihelion!_\r\n\r\nThe influence of my natal star had overcome the pitiful attraction of the\r\nearth, and I had been released from earth’s influence. I was now held by\r\nthe gravity of the star Penelope. The earth remained as it had been; the\r\nhouse was not upside down; only I! And I had thought I had fallen from my\r\nchair! Ye Gods, I had _risen_ from it—as _you_ would understand it—and\r\nhad crashed against the ceiling of my room!\r\n\r\nI sat there, upside down from the earth point of view, upon the ceiling\r\nof my study, and considered my position. Then I stood up and paced back\r\nand forth across the ceiling, and as I moved coins and keys fell from my\r\npockets and dropped downward—upward—as you will—to the floor of the room.\r\n\r\nOne thing was clear. I had averted a very serious disaster by clinging\r\nto the window-frame when I looked out. With that fearsome influence upon\r\nme, a moment of overbalancing would have pulled me over the edge, and\r\nI should have been precipitated into the awful depths of space which\r\ngleamed like an ocean beneath my window.\r\n\r\nMad as was the thought, I wondered what time would be required for\r\nmy cometlike flight to the shores of the star Penelope. I saw myself\r\nspeeding like a meteor across those tremendous distances to plunge at\r\nlast into the heart of the Infinite mystery. Even while I shook with the\r\nsick horror of the thought, it was not without its allure.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the room was great, for heat rises and I was on the ceiling.\r\nA human desire to leave the study and go outside seized me, and, perilous\r\nas I knew the action to be, I resolved to try it.\r\n\r\nI walked across to the door of my study, but it was so high above my head\r\nthat I could not grasp the knob. I remembered, too, that I had locked\r\nthe door and thrown away the key. Fortunately, the transom was open, and\r\nas this was nearer to me I made a spring and grasped its frame. Then,\r\npainfully, I pulled myself up and managed to climb through, dropping to\r\nthe ceiling on the other side.\r\n\r\nIt was dark in the corridor, and as I crossed the ceiling I heard\r\nfootsteps ascending the stairs, which were above and to one side of me.\r\nThen a candle flickered around the bend, and my landlord came into view,\r\nwalking head downward like the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nIn his hand he grasped what, as he came nearer, I made out to be a\r\nrevolver. Apparently he had heard the strange noises from my part of the\r\nhouse and was intent on inquiring their meaning. I trembled, for I knew\r\nthat if he caught sight of me, upside down as he would think, against\r\nthe ceiling, he would instantly shoot me—supposing he did not faint from\r\nfright.\r\n\r\nBut he did not see me, and after prowling about for twenty minutes he\r\nwent away satisfied, and I was left to make my way out of the house as\r\nbest I could.\r\n\r\nI felt curiously light, as if I had lost many pounds of weight, which\r\nindeed must have been the case; and I made very little sound as I trod\r\nthe ceilings toward the back of the house, where I knew there was a\r\nfire-escape leading to the street. The door into the rear room was open,\r\nand I clambered over the obstacle interposed by the top of its frame and\r\nentered the chamber, crossing quietly to the window.\r\n\r\nI dared not look down as I climbed through the aperture, but once I\r\nhad seized the ironwork of the fire-escape I felt more at ease; then\r\ncarefully I began my strange _upward_ climb toward the overhanging\r\nstreet. To any one looking up I would have seemed to be a whimsical\r\nacrobat coming down the ironwork on his hands, and I suppose I would have\r\ncreated a sensation.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom my difficulties began, for I could not hope to remain\r\non the earth without support; walking on my hands would not solve the\r\npuzzle. The pull of Penelope was exactly the pull of the earth when\r\none hangs by his hands from a height. With fear in my heart, I began\r\nmy extraordinary journey, toward the street, taking advantage of every\r\ninequality in the foundation of the house, and often I was clinging\r\ndesperately to a single little shelf of brick, for while ostensibly I\r\nwas walking on my hands, actually I was hanging at a fearful height in\r\nmomentary danger of dropping into the immeasurable abyss of the sky\r\nbeneath me.\r\n\r\nAn iron fence ran around the house, and at one point it was close enough\r\nfor me to reach out a hand and seize it. Then, with a shudder, I drew\r\nmyself across onto its iron pickets, where, after a bit, I felt safer.\r\n\r\nThe fence offered a real support, for the iron frame about its top became\r\na narrow but strong rest for my feet. But the fence was not particularly\r\nhigh, and as I progressed the earth, owing to the inequalities of the\r\nground, often was only a few inches above my head. Anyone stopping to\r\nlook would have seen a man—a madman, as he would have supposed—standing\r\non his head against the iron fence, and occasionally moving forward by\r\nconvulsive movements of his rigid arms.\r\n\r\nThe traffic had thinned, and there seemed to be few pedestrians on my\r\nside of the thoroughfare. A wild idea seized me—to negotiate the distance\r\nto your home, Haswell, clinging to the fences along the way. I thought it\r\ncould be done, and you were the only person to whom I felt I could tell\r\nmy strange story with a hope of belief.\r\n\r\nHad I attempted the journey, I should have been lost without a doubt;\r\nsomewhere along the way my arm sockets would have rebelled, my grasp\r\nwould have torn away, and I would have been plunged into the depths of a\r\nstar-strewn space and become a wanderer in the void speeding toward an\r\nunimagined destiny. As it happened, this was not to be.\r\n\r\nI had reached the end of the side fence, and was just beginning to make\r\nmy way around to the front, when I was seen by a woman—a young woman,\r\nwho came along the street at that moment. I knew nothing of her presence\r\nuntil her muffled scream reached my ears. Seeing me standing apparently\r\non my head, she thought me a maniac.\r\n\r\nTo me she seemed a woman upside down, and I looked into her face as one\r\nlooks into a reflection in the depths of a pool. A street lamp depended\r\nfrom the pavement above me and not far from my position of the moment,\r\nand in its light I saw that her face was young and sweet. I wonder,\r\nHaswell, if there can be any situation, however incredible, in which the\r\nface of a lovely woman will not command attention? I think not.\r\n\r\nWell, it was a sweet face—and she did not scream again. I said to her:\r\n“Please do not be frightened. I am not crazy, although I do not wonder\r\nthat you think so. Preposterous as it may seem, I am for the time being\r\nin a normal position; were I to stand upon the earth as you do, I would—”\r\n\r\nI was going to say that I would vanish from her side, but I realized that\r\nthis would be too much for her.\r\n\r\n“I would be suffocated,” I finished. “The blood would rush to my head,\r\nand I would die.”\r\n\r\nThen she spoke, and her voice was filled with tenderness. It was easy to\r\nunderstand that she believed me quite mad; but she did not fear me.\r\n\r\n“You are ill,” she said. “You need assistance. May I not go for help? Is\r\nthere not someone you would like summoned?”\r\n\r\nAgain, Haswell, I thought of you. But would she carry a message? Would\r\nshe not, instead, go for the police? Was she not even now meditating a\r\nruse by which I might be captured before I did myself an injury? And I\r\nknew now that I could not continue by myself. Sooner or later I would be\r\nforced to drop, or I would certainly meet—not a handsome young woman but\r\na policeman. My mind was quickly made up. I said to her:\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my dear, for your offer; but you are in error. There is\r\nnobody who can help me now; perhaps there never will be. But this is my\r\nhome here, behind me, and rather than frighten people I shall go back as\r\nI came and stay within doors. But I appreciate your kindness, and I am\r\nglad that you do not believe me mad and that you are not afraid of me.\r\nIt may be that some day I shall be cured of this strange trouble, and if\r\nthat day comes I should like to meet you again and thank you. Will you\r\ntell me your name?”\r\n\r\nThen she told me her name, flutteringly, and—I almost screamed again.\r\n\r\nHer name, Haswell, was _Penelope_! Penelope Pollard!\r\n\r\nI all but let go of the railing that supported me, and as I wavered and\r\nseemed about to fall she gave a low cry and, turning, ran away into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nShe had gone for help. I knew it, and shortly I knew that I would be the\r\ncenter of an embarrassing and probably a jeering crowd. And so I turned\r\nand went back. The return journey was worse than the forward journey had\r\nbeen, but after an agony of tortured limbs and straining sinews I found\r\nmyself back in my study, and there, thoroughly worn out, I fell prone\r\nupon the floor—or the ceiling—in a corner, and went instantly to sleep.\r\n\r\nHours later, when I awoke, I was lying on the carpeted floor of my study,\r\nand the sun was pouring in at my window as it had done in past years.\r\nAgain I was subordinate to the laws of terrestrial gravity. I fancy that\r\nas the influence passed I slid gradually down the wall until, without\r\nshock, I reached the floor.\r\n\r\nMy landlord was beating upon my door, and after a dazed moment or two I\r\nrose and tried to let him in. But as I had thrown away the key, I had to\r\npretend that I had lost it and had accidentally made myself a prisoner.\r\nWhen he had freed me, I asked him if there had been any inquiry after me,\r\nand he told me there had not. So it seemed that my fair friend of the\r\nnight before had not returned with a posse of bluecoats. I was grateful\r\nand I determined at the first opportunity to look her up.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward I looked for her—Penelope Pollard. I traced\r\nPollards until I almost hated the name. There were Sylvias and Graces\r\nand Sarahs and Janes and all the thousand and one other epithets bestowed\r\non feminine innocence, but never a Penelope—never, Haswell, until last\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n_Penelope!_\r\n\r\nLast week I found her. And where? Haswell, she lives within three doors\r\nof my own home. She had lived there all the time. She had seen me many\r\ntimes before my fateful night, and she had seen me often afterward—always\r\nwalking the earth normally like other human beings, save for that one\r\nastounding evening. She was willing to talk, and glad to discuss my case;\r\nshe is a highly intelligent girl, I may say. She has since told me that\r\non that evening she believed me to be drunk. It amused her, but it did\r\nnot frighten her. That is why she did not go for help; she believed it to\r\nbe a drunken whim of mine to walk around on my hands, and that it would\r\npass in its own time.\r\n\r\nThat, Haswell, is the story of my amazing connection with the star\r\nPenelope. You will understand that nearly fifty years must pass before it\r\nwill again be in perihelion, and by that time, probably, I shall be dead.\r\n\r\nI am very glad of it; one such experience is enough. Perhaps also you\r\nwill understand that I would not have missed it that once for all the\r\nworlds in all the solar systems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I think your friend was right,” I remarked, after a long silence.\r\n“You certainly were drunk, Raymond. Just as certainly as you are drunk\r\ntonight. Or did the whole thing happen tonight, as you went along?”\r\n\r\n“Drunk?” he echoed. “Yes, I am drunk, Haswell—drunk with a diviner nectar\r\nthan ever was brewed by man. Drunk with the wine of Penelope—the star\r\nPenelope. I have kept the best part of the story until the end. Next week\r\nPenelope and I are to be married. I am here tonight by her permission\r\nfor a last bout with my old friend Haswell. It is my final jamboree.\r\nCongratulate me, Diccon!”\r\n\r\nOf course, I congratulated him, and I did it sincerely; but the whole\r\nstory still vastly puzzles me. Mrs. Raymond is a charming woman, and her\r\nname certainly is Penelope. But does that prove anything?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost Broke, Youth Falls Co-Heir to $12,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\nHoward Girard, eighteen years old, had spent his last dime and was\r\nwondering where he could raise a bit of change. Then he got a job in\r\na printing shop in Evanston, Illinois. And then, all at once, he got\r\nword that he had fallen co-heir to a $12,000,000 fortune left by his\r\ngrand-uncle, Antoine Damange of Paris. Things like this have happened in\r\nromantic novels. They don’t often happen in actual life. Howard, notified\r\nof his remarkable good fortune, said, “Well, that’s pretty good,” and\r\nthen announced his intention of sticking to his job at the printing shop.\r\nHis share of the estate will amount to about $2,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PURPLE HEART\r\n\r\n_The Story of a Haunted Cabin_\r\n\r\n_By_ HERMAN SISK\r\n\r\n\r\nI was weary of the fog that hung over me like a pall, fatigued to the\r\npoint of exhaustion. Since early afternoon the chill wind had forced it\r\nthrough my clothing like rain. It depressed me.\r\n\r\nThe country through which I traveled alone was desolate and unpeopled,\r\nsave here and there where some bush assumed fantastic form. The very air\r\nwas oppressive. As far as I could see, were hills—nothing but hills and\r\nthose bushes. Occasionally I could hear the uncanny cry of some hidden\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nAs I pushed on, a dread of impending disaster fastened itself upon me.\r\nI thought of my home, of my mother and sister, and wondered if all was\r\nwell with them. I tried to rid myself of this morbid state of mind; but,\r\ntry as I would, I could not. It grew as I progressed, until at length it\r\nbecame a part of me.\r\n\r\nI had walked some fifteen miles, and was so weary I could scarcely stand,\r\nwhen I came suddenly upon a log cabin. It was a crude affair, quite\r\nsmall, and stood back some distance from the little-used road in a clump\r\nof trees. A tiny window and a door faced the direction from which I\r\napproached. No paint had ever covered the roughly-hewn logs from which it\r\nwas made, and the sun and the wind and the fog had turned the virgin wood\r\nto a drab brown.\r\n\r\nI felt it was useless to knock, for the cabin had every appearance of\r\nbeing deserted. However, rap I did. No voice bade me enter, and with\r\nan effort I pushed open the door and staggered into the house. Almost\r\nimmediately my weary legs crumpled under me, and I toppled and struck\r\nheavily on my face.\r\n\r\nWhen I regained consciousness, a rough room, scantily furnished, greeted\r\nmy eye. There was an ill-looking table, the top of which was warped and\r\nrectangular in shape, standing in the center. To one side was a rustic\r\nchair. Beyond the table was a bunk built into the wall; and on this lay\r\na man with shining eyes and a long, white beard. A heavy gray blanket\r\ncovered all of him but his head.\r\n\r\n“You’re right on time,” he said in a high-pitched voice.\r\n\r\nI looked at him closely.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Nor I you; but I knew you would come.”\r\n\r\n“You are ill and need help?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied in his strange monotone. “But on this day some one\r\nalways visits here. None has ever returned. But I have yet to be alone on\r\nthe night of this anniversary.”\r\n\r\nThere was something so weird in the way he looked at me out of those big,\r\nwatery eyes that I involuntarily shuddered.\r\n\r\n“What anniversary?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The murder of my father,” he answered. “It happened many years ago. A\r\nstrange man came to this cabin just as you have done.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. I said nothing.\r\n\r\n“You wish to stay all night?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if I may,” I replied. A moment later I regretted it.\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said he, with a slight nod of his white head. “Those were\r\nthe very words he addressed to us. We took him in. When morning came I\r\nfound my father dead in there,” rolling his eyes and raising his head to\r\nindicate some point behind him, “with a dagger in his heart. You can see\r\nthe room if you open the door behind me.”\r\n\r\nI looked at him a moment, hesitating. Then I went to the door and pushed\r\nit open. Cautiously glancing into the other room, I saw there was nothing\r\nthere but a bunk similar to the one the old man occupied.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid,” he said, evidently sensing my fear. “Nothing will hurt\r\nyou now. It’s after midnight when it happens.”\r\n\r\n“What happens?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. No two men have the same experience. It all depends on\r\none’s state of mind.”\r\n\r\n“You mean—” I began.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he interrupted. “One man saw hands reaching toward him and ropes\r\nin the air. He was escaping the gallows. Another saw faces of beautiful\r\ngirls. He was on his way to a large church wedding. A third saw pools\r\nof blood and the white snow stained by human life. He was again living\r\nthrough a massacre in Russia.”\r\n\r\n“Do you live here?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No. No one does. The cabin is quite deserted. I come each year to\r\nwelcome the evening’s guest.”\r\n\r\n“Is there no other place to stay?” I asked, a sudden fear seizing me.\r\n\r\n“None. Besides, it is growing dark without, and you would lose your way\r\n_even if you could leave_.”\r\n\r\nThere was something ominous in the way he uttered these last five words.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he went on, as if I had asked the unuttered question in my mind,\r\n“you may think you can go, but you cannot. That is the curse my father\r\nplaced on this cabin. And I come each year to see that his word is\r\nobeyed. Whoever enters that door yonder on this date must stay until\r\nmorning, and endure the agonies that only the rising sun can dispel.”\r\n\r\nI looked about me to make sure that he and I were the only living things\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\n“What is to prevent my leaving?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Try to,” he replied, an eerie note of glee in his queer voice.\r\n\r\nI walked to the door and gave it a mighty pull. To my utter amazement, it\r\nwas locked!\r\n\r\nI tried again, this time with greater determination; but the door\r\nremained unyielding. A sudden terror seized me. I turned to beseech the\r\nold man to let me go, but _he was not there!_\r\n\r\nI looked quickly about me. He was nowhere to be seen. I ran into the\r\nother room. It was as empty as before. I rushed to the door there and\r\npulled vigorously, but my efforts were in vain.\r\n\r\nReturning to his bunk, I examined it closely. To my great astonishment,\r\nthe heavy gray blanket was gone. In desperation I tried once more the\r\ndoor through which I had entered the cabin. It was still as inflexible as\r\nconcrete.\r\n\r\nDarkness fell fast and the room became very dim. I groped about and\r\ndiscovered some matches and a candle on a shelf under the table. I struck\r\na match and lighted the candle. Letting some of the tallow drip onto\r\nthe table, I made a stick for it. I then sat down on the edge of the\r\nbunk and anxiously awaited developments. But nothing occurred to mar the\r\nsomber silence of my prison.\r\n\r\nThus I remained until my watch pointed to the hour of nine. My journey\r\nhad greatly fatigued me, but my fears counterbalanced my weariness, so\r\nthat I kept awake in spite of it.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, my eyelids grew heavy; my eyes became bleary, so that\r\nthe candle multiplied, and my head drooped until my chin rested on my\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nLetting the candle burn, I lay back on the hard bunk. I was cold and\r\nvery nervous, and greatly felt the need of food and dry clothing. But my\r\nfatigue soon overcame me and I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awakened, a sense of suffocation and bewilderment hung over me.\r\nWhereas the room had been cold when I lay down, it now seemed close and\r\nhot. I pulled myself to a sitting posture. The room was dark. The candle\r\nwas out.\r\n\r\nI jumped to my feet and started toward the table. But in another moment I\r\nstood frozen to the spot, my eyes arrested and my body palsied by what I\r\nsaw before me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the room was a purple glow in the shape of a human\r\nheart. It was stationary when I saw it, but almost immediately it began\r\nto move about the room. Now it was at the window. Then beside the table.\r\nAgain it moved quickly but silently into the other room.\r\n\r\nI pulled my frightened senses together and groped my way to the table. I\r\nfound a match. With trembling hands, I struck it and lit the candle. To\r\nmy surprise, it was almost as tall as when I had fallen asleep. I looked\r\nat my watch. It was one o’clock.\r\n\r\nA moment later the flame was snuffed out and I was again in total\r\ndarkness. I looked wildly about me. Horrors! The purple heart was beside\r\nme! I shrank back in terror. It came closer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I acquired superhuman courage. I grasped for the spectre. I\r\ntouched nothing. I placed my left hand before me at arm’s length. _Lo!_\r\nit was between me and my hand!\r\n\r\nPresently it moved away. A great calm settled over me and I began to\r\nsense a presence in the room. Now, without any fear and with steady\r\nhand, I again struck a match and lighted the candle. It was promptly\r\nextinguished. I struck another with similar results.\r\n\r\nAnd now something brushed my lips and an arm was passed lightly about my\r\nshoulders, but I was no longer afraid. The room continued cozily warm,\r\nand a greater sense of peace came over me.\r\n\r\nPresently I lay down again and watched the purple heart as it came toward\r\nme and took its place at the edge of the bunk, like some loved one\r\nsitting beside me.\r\n\r\nI must have fallen asleep again, for I knew no more until broad daylight\r\nawakened me, and I found myself lying in the middle of the room. There\r\nwas no fog. The sun was shining brightly, and a broad beam was streaming\r\nthrough the dusty window pane. The candle and the matches were no longer\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I thought of the locked door. Springing to it, I gave a mighty\r\npull. It opened easily!\r\n\r\nI snatched my cap from the rough floor and hurried into the warm sunlight.\r\n\r\nA short distance from me a man came trudging along. He was a\r\npowerful-looking fellow of middle age and was dressed in coarse working\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n“Do you know anything about that cabin?” I shouted, as we drew closer.\r\n\r\n“Sure. It’s haunted,” he replied. He looked hard at me. “Were _you_ in\r\nthere last night?”\r\n\r\nI related my experience.\r\n\r\n“That’s queer!” he muttered. “But I ain’t surprised. Last night was the\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“What night?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“Ten years ago an old man was murdered in that cabin, and his son swore\r\non his deathbed he’d come back every anniversary and lure somebody into\r\nthe cabin for the night and torture him.”\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, his white face staring at the cabin.\r\n\r\n“Come away!” he whispered. “Come away! It’s haunted! It’s haunted!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFELINE\r\n\r\n_A Whimsical Storiette_\r\n\r\n_By_ Bruce Grant\r\n\r\n\r\nMyra looked up from her writing.\r\n\r\n“David,” she said, “I am positive I heard a cat outside.”\r\n\r\nThe man only growled, settled himself deeper in his comfortable chair,\r\nand continued to read.\r\n\r\nThe giant breath of the blizzard rattled the windows. The snow flung\r\nitself wrathfully against the panes. Outside it was bitter cold.\r\n\r\n“I can’t bear to think of a cat outside on a night like this,” continued\r\nMyra.\r\n\r\n“Forget it!” exclaimed David, arousing himself. “You are continually\r\nthinking of cats. All that I hear from you is cats. You dream of cats,\r\nyou occupy your mind with cats. I heard no cat crying outside. It is\r\nonly your imagination.”\r\n\r\n“No; I heard a cat—I am sure,” insisted Myra.\r\n\r\nIt was warm inside. David sat beneath a green-shaded reading lamp. The\r\npyramid of light fell on his tall figure, attired in a dressing-gown and\r\nslippers, slouched comfortably in the chair.\r\n\r\nMyra sat at a desk, scribbling in a book, now and then tapping her lips\r\nwith her penholder. She wore a clinging, yellow negligée, and her hair\r\nwas done back tightly on her head. In her sleek, brown coil of hair at\r\nthe back there was a large Spanish comb.\r\n\r\n“David; I _know_ I heard a cat then!” she cried, throwing down her pen.\r\n“You surely must have heard it, too.”\r\n\r\nDavid laid down his book.\r\n\r\n“When you are through dreaming of cats,” he said, “I’ll be able to read.”\r\n\r\nMyra rose.\r\n\r\n“I cannot bear to think of a cat out on a night like this—a little\r\nhomeless cat.”\r\n\r\nThen she walked from the room.\r\n\r\nDavid mused. _Cats!_ Nothing but cats! She had gone insane on the subject\r\nof cats. He had never known her to be so unreasonable about cats. She\r\nseemed worse since their cat, Rodolpho, had died. Her mind seemed now\r\noccupied with nothing but cats. He was sure she had been writing\r\nsomething about cats in her book.\r\n\r\nTo prove his contention he walked to the desk. He picked up the small,\r\nleather-bound book. He read:\r\n\r\n              _“THE SNOWSTORM._\r\n\r\n    _“Against the pane the snow flakes press_\r\n      _Like dainty kitten paws._\r\n    _Outside the chill wind stings and cuts,_\r\n      _Like angry kitten claws.”_\r\n\r\nDavid laid the note-book down. There! He had been right. He strode back\r\nto his chair. Myra returned to the room.\r\n\r\n“I looked out of the dining-room window,” she said. “I could not see the\r\ncat. It is awful outside.”\r\n\r\nShe paused.\r\n\r\n“Cats are such unfortunate creatures. In fact, all animals are\r\nunfortunate—animals domesticated by man. They never know when their\r\nmasters are going to turn against them, or at least ignore them.”\r\n\r\n“People treat cats that way because cats are good for nothing,” David put\r\nin. “Cats enter your home, eat your food, roll up on your bed, and do\r\nnothing. Rat traps are better for catching rats and mice. You don’t need\r\ncats in the scheme of things. They are worthless.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Myra softly, in a passionless voice. “A woman comes into\r\nyour home, and eats your food, and spends your money, and curls up on\r\nyour bed. A cook and a housekeeper can do better work than she.”\r\n\r\n“There is no comparison,” cried David. “A woman at least shows you some\r\naffection—a cat never.”\r\n\r\n“A woman shows affection when she knows that it is wanted,” Myra said in\r\na distant voice.\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward silence. These arguments never came to anything.\r\nWhy did they indulge in them? They always led to disagreeable subjects,\r\nor touched on the fatuity of marriage. No, such arguments never did any\r\ngood. Far better if both remained silent. David picked up his book.\r\n\r\n“Cats are very intelligent animals,” Myra continued, half aloud. “They\r\nknow instantly when they are not wanted. If anyone in a household hates\r\na cat, there is no need of that person speaking gruffly or striking the\r\ncat. The cat will know. Cats have powers of divination which are denied\r\nmost humans. They are such sensitive creatures. They respond to the least\r\ntouch, the least kind thought. They slink away at the least unkind word,\r\nat the least unkind thought.”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, trifling with her pen.\r\n\r\n“They know when they are not wanted. I should not be surprised if a cat\r\nwould go out into the cold—on a night like this—if it knew it was not\r\nwanted.”\r\n\r\n“Stop such darn foolishness!” growled David.\r\n\r\nMyra looked at him, raising her eyebrows quizzically.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t talk that way,” she said.\r\n\r\nFor an instant there came over him a surge of hatred. Would she ever\r\nleave him alone! Alone for a few minutes of peaceful reading. Wasn’t she\r\ncontented to live quietly and peacefully without continually worrying\r\nherself about cats, and whether or not her husband still loved her.\r\n\r\nShe was talking:\r\n\r\n“It is true I love cats. I have loved them all my life. They are the most\r\nbeautiful and graceful of animals. But please forgive me if I hurt you by\r\ntalking about them. They show me affection. They seem to know that I love\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nBut David was not listening. He was thinking. She was like a cat. Her\r\nmovements were catlike. Truly, she was every inch a cat. Come into your\r\nhome, absorb your warmth, eat your food, taunt you, insist on being\r\nstroked and petted at every turn—truly a remarkable woman, as remarkable\r\nas those small animals she adored, David scowled.\r\n\r\nEvents tumbled over themselves in his mind. She was susceptible to men.\r\nWhen one caressed her with his voice she almost purred with pleasure. She\r\nloved those who flattered her. He had flattered her most and had won her.\r\nShe now still expected all the flattery and little attentions which he\r\nhad given her before. She could not “settle down.” He felt that he exuded\r\nhate at that moment. He felt that at last his eyes were opened.\r\n\r\nMyra got up from her desk again.\r\n\r\n“I’m going out into the back yard and see if I can find that kitty,” she\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nDavid could not read now. He sat silently in his chair, repressing the\r\nwrathful things that tried to force themselves from his lips. He heard\r\nMyra putting on her shoes.\r\n\r\nShe peeped in finally and smiled wistfully. He sat in the same spot. The\r\nback door closed softly.\r\n\r\nDavid gradually began to grow calmer. He sat and waited. In the silent\r\nhouse, the quiet broken only by the rattling of the windows and the\r\nthudding of the snow against the glass, he began to look back over his\r\nmarried life.\r\n\r\nThey had been more or less happy during the three years. It would be hard\r\nto find another woman who would put up with his idiosyncrasies. What a\r\nfool he was! Myra was a wonderful woman, after all, the most wonderful in\r\nthe world!\r\n\r\nHe walked to the back door and called out into the night. He rushed\r\nthrough the snow and the cutting wind. He returned and waited. The clock\r\ntold off the long hours.\r\n\r\nThen it came to him—Myra’s words, “I should not be surprised if a cat\r\nwould go out on a night like this—into the cold—if it knew it was not\r\nwanted....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChicagoans to Live in the Air Fifty Years Hence\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years from now Chicago’s citizens will no longer be rooted to the\r\nground, but will fly in the air like birds, according to Mrs. William J.\r\nChalmers, who has been closely identified with the city’s progress.\r\n\r\n“As we overstepped the bounds between earth and water, so we will\r\noverstep that between earth and air,” she declares. “Whether it will be\r\nthrough some simple device which we will attach to our shoulders or feet,\r\nor whether we will learn breath control so that we can literally swim\r\nthrough the air, I cannot say. Certainly in fifty years this will come to\r\npass—that we will all own small aeroplanes, so perfected that it will be\r\npossible for us to alight on the window ledges of our apartments, whether\r\nthey be ten or twenty stories high. Chicago will, fifty years hence, have\r\nbecome a seaport. Steam-ships will be run electricity and will attain\r\ntremendous speed. But steamers will be used for heavy loads and passenger\r\ntravel will be by aeroplane.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO HOURS OF DEATH\r\n\r\n_A Ghost Story_\r\n\r\n_By_ E. THAYLES EMMONS\r\n\r\n\r\n_A few weeks ago, while looking over some old papers which I found in\r\nthe desk of my deceased father, I chanced upon the following manuscript.\r\nWhether it is a true record of some adventure in my father’s life, or\r\na bit of fiction which he had at some time prepared for publication,\r\nI do not know; but I am inclined to believe that it is indeed a true\r\nnarrative. I have ascertained that such a man as Felix Sayres actually\r\ndid exist; that he was an intimate friend of my father, and that he died\r\nin the strange manner described in the manuscript; but further than that\r\nI know nothing. However, I submit the whole thing as I found it, without\r\nchange._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs I picked up my morning paper, the first item to catch my eye was the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n                         DIES IN MADHOUSE\r\n\r\n             INMATE FOR THIRTY-FIVE YEARS DIES SUDDENLY.\r\n\r\n    Felix Sayres, aged 69 years, who has been an inmate of the\r\n    Eastwood Asylum for the Insane for the past thirty-five years,\r\n    was found dead in his cell yesterday morning. At one time\r\n    he was a well-known scientist of this city, but at the age\r\n    of thirty-four became hopelessly insane, and has since been\r\n    confined in the asylum, of which he was, at the time of his\r\n    death, the oldest inmate.\r\n\r\nFelix Sayres was my college chum, and in later years my closest friend,\r\nand now that he is dead I am at liberty to reveal the remarkable story\r\nconcerning him, a part of which not even he has ever known, though a\r\nprincipal actor in the awful scene which has been indelibly stamped on\r\nmy memory, haunting my waking hours and recurring to me in oft-repeated\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nMy friend was a man of genius and ability, and had it not been for the\r\nterrible misfortune which came upon him, he would have become famous in\r\nthe scientific world. Nearly all of his time, day and night, was given\r\nover to scientific research, in finding and working upon new hypotheses\r\nand bringing to light discoveries in that strange world into which he had\r\nevidently been born.\r\n\r\nI was at that time his most intimate friend, and to me a great many of\r\nhis hopes and secrets were confided. Many nights have I passed in his\r\nlaboratory, listening to his explanation of some new theory, or aiding\r\nhim in his experiments.\r\n\r\nIt was always a source of great pleasure to me thus to pass a portion of\r\nmy time, although my mind was not of the same scientific trend as that of\r\nmy friend. His theories were always so lucidly elaborated and so strong\r\nfundamentally that the most abstract of them seemed, even in the embryo,\r\ncapable of actual demonstration, and so great was my confidence in him\r\nthat I always stood ready to assist in any experiment or test.\r\n\r\nAt one point, however, I drew the line. Sayres, while none the less\r\nengaged with material subjects, was constantly dabbling in various\r\npsychical experiments with which I refused absolutely to have anything\r\nto do. The occult, I argued, should remain occult. Had it been intended\r\nthat we should see beyond the things of this world the power would have\r\nbeen given us ages ago, I maintained, and the less one dealt with such\r\nunsolvable problems as vexed my friend the happier would be his life.\r\nHaving no desire for knowledge of the supernatural, I studiously avoided\r\nall dealing with it, and it was tacitly understood, between Sayres and\r\nmyself, that beyond the line of ordinary conversation the subject was\r\nforbidden. I knew, however, that for him the thing had great fascination\r\nand that my opinion did nothing to banish it from his mind.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I write I had not seen Sayres for several weeks, as\r\nwas often the case when he was deepest in his books and experiments. I\r\nhad called at his laboratory, but his servant had said that no one was\r\nto be admitted, and I knew that it was useless to attempt to see him.\r\nAt length I received a letter from him, saying that he had something of\r\ninterest to disclose and urging me to “come tonight!”\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at my friend’s laboratory I found him in a high state of\r\nnervous excitement, pacing back and forth like a caged tiger. He greeted\r\nme effusively, and with his usual directness, plunged at once into the\r\nmatter at hand, which was evidently uppermost in his mind. Seating\r\nhimself at the opposite side of the table and directly facing me, he\r\nbegan:\r\n\r\n“Thornton, I want you to prepare yourself to hear of something that is\r\nto be entirely different from anything I have heretofore shown you.\r\nIt is something that to mankind has always been vague, uncertain,\r\nunfathomable—something, in fact, that has existed only in imagination and\r\nin theory, but never in demonstration. I will show it to you tonight, and\r\nto the world tomorrow, in such a manner as entirely to revolutionize life\r\nand living, death and dying.\r\n\r\n“As you very well know, my religious beliefs have always been skeptical;\r\nbut my skepticism has arisen rather from insufficiency of faith with\r\nwhich to overcome the lack of direct evidence which mortals have\r\nconcerning spiritual things than from stubborn unbelief. That there is a\r\nSupreme Being I have never doubted. His many works are too manifest, and\r\nit is impossible to conceive of such a creation as this earth and all its\r\ndelicate mechanisms, and of the rest of the universe with all its unknown\r\nwonders, without some vast Supernatural oversight.\r\n\r\n“Although I have never discussed the subject to any great extent, I\r\nhave nursed it as a pet and secret hobby, and have spent many hours in\r\nwork along certain lines in connection with it. In the beginning, I put\r\nfiniteness aside from the question. The human mind, or soul, with its\r\nunlimited powers, has always been regarded by me as the most wonderful\r\nof all creations. I have been able to find no entirely satisfactory\r\ndefinition of this ‘mind’ from a purely physical standpoint, and\r\ntherefore sought to obtain one. Nobody will say that the soul is\r\nmaterial; it belongs to the body and develops with it, but is no part of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Life is but a taper, which a slight breath may easily puff out, but\r\nthis indeterminable thing called ‘mind,’ I reasoned, must be governed by\r\ndifferent laws. Is it possible that the Creator ruled that the greatest\r\nof all His works should be blotted out with the cessation of life in that\r\nsordid mass of clay, the body? Or did He arrange to reclaim it, together\r\nwith its spiritual complement, to a world of its own, as men have for\r\nages believed?\r\n\r\n“Skeptic as I have been, I have always been willing to concede that the\r\nidea of a spiritual existence, while vague, seems no more wonderful than\r\nthousands of other things which we see about us daily, and for the reason\r\nthat they are manifest, give them no thought whatever.\r\n\r\n“As a basis for the theory which I set myself to formulate, I took what\r\nI shall term ‘mind atoms.’ As I have before said, we cannot regard the\r\nmind force as a material thing; but, as a contradictory fact, we know\r\nthat it is _something_, and further than that generality we are ignorant.\r\nThen, as the mind force governs alike every portion of the body, this\r\nindeterminable something of which it is composed, I reasoned, must be in\r\none portion as in another.\r\n\r\n“I then placed these mind atoms as being diffused in the space occupied\r\nby the body and lying even between the atoms of its material composition.\r\nIf, at death, this mind is merely withdrawn from the body—all of which I\r\nworked upon as already determined—would it not occupy in the spirit world\r\nthe same space and retain the same shape of the human form from which it\r\nhad fled?\r\n\r\n“Then the idea suggested itself that if some powerful and undiscovered\r\naction could be produced (by the use of drugs, probably), causing an\r\ninstantaneous and simultaneous separation of every mind atom from the\r\nphysical atoms, the effect would be a spiritual death, while at the same\r\ntime physical vitality would not be in the least impaired. I then went\r\none step further and added the supposition that as the effects of the\r\naction wore away it would be possible for the soul to re-enter the body,\r\neven as it had been driven out, and creation would again be complete.\r\n\r\n“I have worked untiringly, and wrought experiment after experiment, until\r\nat last I have succeeded in producing a drug that will accomplish all\r\nthat I have explained to you. I have used it on various animals and have\r\nseen them recover from the effects of it, and thus have ascertained that\r\nit is harmless. I ventured to try it on myself, and I know that _I have\r\ncertainly solved the mystery of the future_, although during the brief\r\nperiod in which my soul was in the spirit world I could make but few\r\nobservations, and those of minor importance.\r\n\r\n“I saw no other spiritual beings, but remained, for the most, close by\r\nmy soulless body, waiting for the proper moment to return to my physical\r\nlife, if it were indeed to be possible; but I am confident that what I\r\nhave accomplished renders the unrevealed capable of being revealed and\r\nrobs the hereafter of all its secrets.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe paused, and for a moment, so bewildered was I by the strangeness of it\r\nall, that I sat speechless, my brain in a whirl.\r\n\r\nThinking to overcome my amazement, I reached for the wine decanter, which\r\nwas on the table before me, and into the glass nearest me I poured some\r\nof the strong wine which Sayres always kept at hand. After draining it, I\r\nlooked up to see a gleam of satisfaction flit across his countenance.\r\n\r\n“Thornton,” said he, “in that glass of wine there was enough of the drug\r\nto render you temporarily dead for two hours, as I can best calculate.\r\nIn five minutes you will be unconscious. I want you to undergo the same\r\nexperience which I have safely passed through, so that we may later\r\nexchange ideas on the subject.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his assurance, a deadly fear took possession of me, and I\r\nswore and expostulated at his unfair treatment. With undisturbed calm, he\r\nagain spoke to me, endeavoring to dispel my fears, and assuring me that\r\nhe would be conversing with me again at the end of the two hours.\r\n\r\nEven as he was speaking his words became indistinct, and an overpowering\r\ndizziness seized me. Then came a moment of which I have no recollection,\r\nafter which, by the fact that I stood, or _seemed_ to stand, within a few\r\nfeet of the chair in which I had been seated, _gazing at myself_, even\r\nnow in the same position, I knew that my body was without a soul, even as\r\nSayres had said, and that I was the soul standing there!\r\n\r\nI looked about me, and in place of the invisible atmosphere which I was\r\naccustomed to, the room seemed filled with a constantly moving, pulsating\r\nvapor, dense, gray and foglike, but through which I could discern objects\r\nwith as much ease as ordinarily.\r\n\r\nI saw my friend lift my body from the chair, lay it on a bench and place\r\na cushion under the head. Then he began pacing to and fro, up and down,\r\nback and forth, and I found that I could move about at will and follow\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI attempted to speak to him, but now there was no sound; I reached forth\r\nmy hand to grasp a chair, but it offered no resistance, and I realized\r\nthat I indeed occupied no space, but was nevertheless in space and a\r\npart of space. I saw my friend’s lips move as though he were speaking. I\r\nheard no sound, but was able to understand his words, although he did not\r\naddress me.\r\n\r\nThe glare of the lamps gave me a sensation which, had I been in my\r\nphysical form, I should have termed pain, and I much preferred to keep in\r\na dark corner. By a direct mental communication, of which I was not at\r\nthe time aware, I was able to signify this fact to Sayres, and he at once\r\nturned out all the lights, leaving the laboratory lighted only by a low\r\nfire in the grate at the end of the room. I was then astonished to find\r\nthat the absence of light had no effect upon my visual powers, and that I\r\ncould see in the dark as well as before.\r\n\r\nFrom this I drew the conclusion that in reality I possessed no visuality,\r\nas it seemed. My senses I had left behind with my physical self, and\r\nhere they were replaced by a strange comprehension of everything about\r\nme. I still had the abilities which the senses convey, but their actual\r\npresence was lacking.\r\n\r\nI could flit through the air with as much ease as I could walk on the\r\nfloor, and could even have sunk through that same floor had I desired,\r\nfor the most solid substance offered no resistance to my form. I was able\r\nto pass directly through anything.\r\n\r\nThe success of the experiment, up to this point, served to restore my\r\nconfidence in Sayres and I entertained no doubt but that at the end of\r\nthe stated time I could return to my body again. I therefore determined\r\nto lose no time in making all the observations possible.\r\n\r\nSayres was still pacing the room, and it was evident from his actions\r\nthat in a large degree fear was the cause of his restlessness. He knew\r\nthat in all probability I was constantly near him, and he would have\r\navoided coming in contact with me had he been able to do so. Felix Sayres\r\npossessed courage beyond that of many men, but few mortals can be brought\r\nface to face with the supernatural without experiencing fear.\r\n\r\nAll of us have at various times—sometimes by day, but more often at\r\nnight—undergone the feeling of the proximity of some ghostly presence,\r\ngiving rise to a sensation of coldness and choking horror. This was\r\nclearly demonstrated to me now, for whenever myself and Sayres came\r\nwithin a few feet of each other I could easily see that he felt my\r\npresence. He made no attempt to communicate with me and paid no heed to\r\nthe various things I did to attract his attention.\r\n\r\nAfter a little, he seemed to recover himself and calmly walked across\r\nthe room to where my soulless body lay, and stood looking down at it.\r\nBy the gleam in his eyes, and by my wonderful supernatural power of\r\ncomprehension, I knew in an instant that overwork and nervous strain had\r\nat last done their work, that the cord of reason had snapped and that my\r\nfriend was a madman!\r\n\r\nHis lips moved and I heard him, or rather _felt_ him, address my body:\r\n\r\n“At last I have you in my power! I have waited long for this moment, and\r\nat last my waiting is to be rewarded. I have driven the soul from the\r\nbody, and the body lives; but now I will take away life itself, and you\r\nwill be dead!”\r\n\r\nThe word seemed to please him, and he murmured slowly:\r\n\r\n“Dead, _dead_!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI heard him continue in his madness:\r\n\r\n“It is you who have stolen the honors due me; it is you who would prevent\r\nme from becoming famous; it is you, curse you, who will marry the only\r\nwoman I can ever love—and then you ask me to let you live! No, damn you!”\r\n\r\nHe then took from a drawer nearby a large and peculiarly-shaped\r\ndissecting knife which I had often seen him use, and, with the\r\ndeliberation of the insane, he proceeded to sharpen it on a steel,\r\ntesting it from time to time with his thumb.\r\n\r\nIn my overpowering fear for the safety of my physical self, I know not\r\nall that I did, but I do know that it was all in vain. How I longed for\r\nthe power of speech! And what would I not have given for the use of my\r\nown strong body with which to cope with him!\r\n\r\nBut I was utterly in his power and at his mercy, and the sickening\r\nthought came to me that I, the spirit, must stand passive by his side and\r\nsee my body, still living, hacked and mutilated by the knife he held. I\r\ncalled for help, but knew there was no sound, and in despair I waited.\r\n\r\nI heard the madman that was once my friend mutter: “That will do,” and,\r\nwith the gleaming blade in his hand, he started across the room, and I\r\nknew that the awful moment was at hand.\r\n\r\nI attempted to grapple with him, but my hands felt nothing. Another step\r\nand he would be at the bench and it would all be over. Instinctively,\r\nI threw myself between the madman and my body, with my arms stretched\r\nforth as if to keep him away. How it was accomplished I cannot tell, but\r\nby the look of mortal terror that came in the face before me, such as I\r\nhave never since seen drawn in any countenance, I knew that I had _become\r\nvisible_ and that he saw me!\r\n\r\nI can imagine the picture at this moment—the spirit guarding the\r\nhelpless counterpart of itself—and indeed it must have been a tableau\r\nto have struck fear to the stoutest heart. My friend’s eyes dilated with\r\nhorror; the knife dropped from his hand.\r\n\r\nOne moment thus he stood. Then his lips parted, and I knew that he had\r\nuttered a shriek. He then fell at my feet, blood flowing from his mouth\r\nand nostrils, his eyes rolling in terror.\r\n\r\nI remained chained to the spot by the fear that he would recover from his\r\nfit and carry out his fiendish intention.\r\n\r\nAt length the same feeling of dizziness, which I had before experienced,\r\nreturned to me, and almost before I could realize what was taking place\r\nI found myself sitting upright on the bench, body and soul again united,\r\nand the form of Sayres at my feet, to convince me that all was not a\r\nhideous dream.\r\n\r\nI placed my poor friend on the bench, and finally I succeeded in bringing\r\nhim back to consciousness, but in a very weak condition.\r\n\r\nHe passed through a very severe illness, but never regained his sanity.\r\nHe remained hopelessly insane.\r\n\r\nOf this awful story I have related he never recollected any part. I was\r\nunable to find any of the wonderful drug in his laboratory, and am as\r\nignorant of its composition now as I was on that terrible night. I have\r\nbeen silent on the matter, hoping that some day Sayres would again regain\r\nhis reason, but now that he is dead I have been impelled to write this\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic Women Have Queer Mania\r\n\r\n\r\nThe astonishing fraud perpetrated by Evelyn Lyons of Escanaba, Michigan,\r\nwho, with the aid of a hot water bottle, fooled the doctors into\r\nbelieving that she had a fever of 118 degrees, is not without precedent.\r\nShe was the victim of an odd mania that often seizes abnormal women who\r\ncrave wide notoriety. Doctors and psychologists have long been acquainted\r\nwith this strange caprice of neurotic women, but it is rarely that one\r\nmaintains the fake illness for as long a time as did Miss Lyons, who set\r\nthe nation’s medical fraternity in a tempest of learned discussion before\r\nher sham was discovered.\r\n\r\nThis erratic desire to be an object of curiosity often takes other forms,\r\nas in the case of Mary Ellen MacDonald of Antigonish, Nova Scotia,\r\nwho, in order to attract attention, turned herself into a “spook.” By\r\nstarting mysterious fires around her home, walking stealthily through\r\nthe farmhouse at night and slapping the faces of sleeping persons,\r\nrapping on the walls and so forth, she contrived to spread a feeling of\r\ndread throughout the countryside. The superstitious country folk were\r\nsure that the house was haunted, and as Miss MacDonald carried her hoax\r\nstill further—sending weird radio messages, tying knots in the tails of\r\ncows, attiring herself in ghostly gowns and fleeing across the moonlit\r\nfields—the fear of disembodied spirits spread rapidly, and the uncanny\r\n“manifestations” became a matter of nation-wide discussion.\r\n\r\nSpiritualists, mediums, and others journeyed to Antigonish, and, after\r\nwatching the unearthly “phenomena,” were unanimously agreed that a\r\nspirit, or spirits, had returned to haunt the community.\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Walter Prince of the Psychical Research Society went there,\r\ninvestigated the “ghost” more thoroughly, and traced all the terrifying\r\nhappenings to Mary Ellen MacDonald.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Miss MacDonald—like Miss Lyons, the “fever girl”—had\r\ngratified her craving for notoriety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_HAMILTON CRAIGIE Spins Another Yarn in His Inimitable Style_\r\n\r\nMIDNIGHT BLACK\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRita Daventry sat bolt upright in her bed, her ears strained against the\r\nsinging silence, breath indrawn sharply through her parted lips.\r\n\r\nThere had been no sound, save as a sound heard in dreams, but as she sat\r\nthere, rigid, tense, in the thick darkness, leaning forward a little in\r\nthe great bed, she was certain that she was not alone.\r\n\r\nSomeone or _something_ was in the room.\r\n\r\nThe blackness was like an invisible wall; it pressed upon her eyelids now\r\nlike a gigantic and smothering hand. And then, all at once, she heard it:\r\nthe brief _clink_ of metal upon metal; a rustle, like the flicker of a\r\nwind-blown leaf.\r\n\r\nSimply by reaching forth her hand she could have pressed the wall switch,\r\nflooded that midnight blackness with the blazing effulgence of the\r\nelectrolier, but she could not. Eyes strained against that velvet black,\r\nshe crouched now, in the immensity of the great bed, the silken case of\r\nthe sheets turned suddenly to ice, her pulses hammering to the tension of\r\nher hard-held breathing, there in the stifling dark.\r\n\r\nThere came a clanking, a whirring as of wings invisible; then, from the\r\nwall clock, there boomed twelve heavy strokes—midnight.\r\n\r\nShe heard the slow _tick-tock_ of that steady beat, and then, of a sudden\r\nshe heard something else: the muffled ticking of a watch.\r\n\r\nThe sound was not loud—it came to her as through walls of silence—but it\r\nwas nearer now. She was certain of it.\r\n\r\nThe door was closed; it was a heavy, sound-proof affair; the intruder,\r\nwhoever he might be, had entered by the window. Rita Daventry knew that\r\nhe was armed, and desperate—desperate with the cold courage of a cornered\r\ngrizzly; a housebreaker, who, if attacked, would shoot his way out,\r\nreckless of consequences. To such a man, murder, as the price of his\r\nliberty, would be a little thing.\r\n\r\nAnd with the thought she stiffened; her mouth opened, to release the\r\nscream, at the first sound of which she knew that aid would come,\r\nunthinking, swift, reckless, too, in its first fury of intrepid action.\r\n\r\nBut she would not summon that scream.\r\n\r\nOn the floor above, her husband was working now in his laboratory. But\r\nthe man below would have the advantage of that midnight black; with the\r\nopening of the door, he would shoot him down with the ruthless, cold\r\ncruelty of a wolf.\r\n\r\nBut that was not all the reason. To Rita Daventry, alone now with this\r\ninvisible menace of the dark, there had come, on a sudden, a thought to\r\nfreeze her blood, the thought of Ronald Armitage.\r\n\r\nIt had been only the night before, at a studio tea, that Armitage had\r\nmade the threat, or the promise, that came to her now with a sudden,\r\ncold prevision of tragedy. Armitage was young, reckless, debonair, of\r\nan engaging manner with women; and Rita had encouraged him—well, just a\r\nlittle, she told herself.\r\n\r\nIt was a fascinating game—in the playing. The paying—that would be\r\nanother matter. And as if the words had been spoken in her ear, she was\r\nhearing now the smooth voice, thickened a trifle with his potations, with\r\nthat faintly roughened, passionate undertone:\r\n\r\n“... Daventry doesn’t care, does he? Why should _you_? I tell you, Rita,\r\nyou’ve gotten into my blood. Some night _between you and me_—the witching\r\nhour, ha? I _promise_ you I’ll be there; and you won’t have to _look_ to\r\nfind me!”\r\n\r\nThe handsome, dissipated face had come close to hers; there had been a\r\nmenace in the tone, as well as a caress. And the fact that the man had\r\nbeen—well—not himself could not condone. The noise, the lights, the music\r\nupon which, dancing together, they had floated as on a languorous, steep\r\nwave of sound and motion, could not condone.\r\n\r\nRita had had no excuse save the oft-repeated, sophisticated sophistry\r\nof “The last time; this will be the very last!” And she had gone on,\r\nprotesting, if at all, with a half-mutinous, wholly unconsidered\r\ncoquetry, which, at the last, had led to this!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRonald Armitage had the reputation of being something of a “blood;” the\r\nArmitages had sowed and reaped, and of young Ronald it was said that he\r\nwould stop at nothing for the accomplishment of his desires.\r\n\r\nAnd now, alone in that vast bed, hearing again that stealthy movement by\r\nthe window, the girl checked again sharply in the act of reaching forth\r\nher hand. With her finger upon the button, she froze, rigid, as that\r\nsmooth, stealthy advance moved closer.\r\n\r\nThere came a fumbling at the footboard; she heard the sound, like a\r\nfaint, rubbing whisper, of naked fingers sliding upon polished wood. But\r\nthe night was a moonless, black emptiness; the bed-chamber was like a\r\ntomb for blackness, dark as a wolf’s throat, and yet alive with movement,\r\nwith a tension drawn like a fine wire and singing at a pitch too low for\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nAt any moment, too, Daventry might come down; he was a careful man who\r\nguarded his house and the treasure therein with a meticulous observance.\r\nAnd sitting there, waiting, nerves at pitch, Rita Daventry tasted to the\r\nfull the fruits of her single indiscretion. As between Armitage and her\r\nhusband, she knew now beyond peradventure whom it was she loved, and with\r\na love, as she knew now, fierce and protective, desirous above all things\r\nof the safety—the life, indeed, of the toiler on the second floor.\r\n\r\nArmitage had never been in her bedchamber, of course, although he knew\r\nits location, had seen it, from the outside, walking with Daventry\r\nthrough the corridor without. But in the darkness strange tricks are\r\nplayed with one’s sense of direction. The room was a large one, lofty,\r\nhigh-ceilinged, its rear windows opening upon a service alley, and it had\r\nbeen by means of this alley that the midnight intruder had made entrance.\r\n\r\nShe could hear him now a little better—his breathing, hard-held and\r\nyet rising to that peculiar, stertorous quality that was almost like a\r\nsnuffling, a quick, eager panting as of a hound questing his quarry in\r\nthe dark. If Armitage had been drinking—but then, he must have been, or\r\nhe would scarcely have made good his threat.\r\n\r\nDaventry, though a studious, careful man, was a lion when aroused; he\r\ncould shoot and shoot straight. And if the two should meet, there in that\r\nmidnight black, it would be grim tragedy for one, or both—tragedy with\r\nnone for witness save that pale girl new-risen from her couch of dreams,\r\nwide-eyed, her gaze fixed now in a sightless staring upon the black well\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as she shrank backward against the pillows, there came a\r\nthumping clatter, a thick, whispered oath, and a following silence that\r\nwas more terrible than any sound.\r\n\r\nHe was coming now, around the foot-board, along the side of the bed.\r\nShe felt rather than heard that fumbling, stealthy advance; the fingers\r\nfeeling along the counterpane; the noiseless _pad-pad_ of the feet\r\ndeadened by the thick pile of the Kermanshah rug; in imagination she\r\ncould almost see the face, flushed now, bemused with drink, the leering,\r\nparted mouth....\r\n\r\nThe scream, lodged in her throat now, seemed like a bird beating against\r\nbars; in a moment the silence would be ripped from end to end, as a\r\nsheet is ripped from point to point, with the tearing impact of that\r\nscream, rising heavenward with the first defiling touch of those groping\r\nfingers. Armitage’s face on that evening had been the face of a satyr,\r\nhigh-colored, the nose sharpened to a point of greed, the eyes in a wide,\r\navid staring upon the perfect curve of her shoulders, her neck.\r\n\r\nAnd she had encouraged him with by-play of hand and eye, speech in a low\r\nrich contralto dealing in double meanings that yet had no meaning; glance\r\nprovocative plumbing the depths of his—for this.\r\n\r\nAnd in that moment Rita Daventry knew fear; the primal fear of the woman\r\nwhose very protection has become her peril—the peril of the abyss.\r\n\r\nAnd it was then that she heard it, like a summons of doom; the sound of\r\nheavy footsteps from the room above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe footsteps were coming down now; they beat hollowly against the iron\r\ntreads of the staircase with rapid thunder.\r\n\r\nRobert Daventry was coming, leaping downward, now to meet—the death that\r\nwaited for him behind that closed door, or to deal it to the man who,\r\nsomewhere in that smothering dark, crouched, automatic ready, waiting for\r\nthe man who was coming—on the wings of death.\r\n\r\nAfter all, her husband might not have heard that thumping clatter; all\r\nunknowing, he might be rushing downward to meet an ambush unsuspected and\r\nunknown. And that Armitage would shoot, the woman was convinced. For he\r\nwould put but one construction upon that headlong descent. Daventry had\r\nheard him, knew that he was there, like a thief in the night, a marauder,\r\nan outlaw meriting the swift justice of the ballet.\r\n\r\nAnd then, all at once, the steps ceased; a silence grew and held that\r\nwas like the silence before storm, so that to the woman upon the bed it\r\nseemed that she abode in a vacuum of sound and silence, brooding upon the\r\nnight in a volcanic, breathless calm.\r\n\r\nIt must be a nightmare that would pass, a waking dream that would\r\npresently dissolve in the sanity of peaceful slumber. She strove, as a\r\ndrowning swimmer fathoms deep in dreams, to scream a warning, a command\r\nto the man—_her_ man—silent now upon the threshold of life, or of death.\r\nBut she could not.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, how she could not have told, she knew that, where before\r\nthere had been but _one_ dim Presence in that bed-chamber, now there were\r\n_two_.\r\n\r\nShe had heard nothing, seen nothing, felt nothing; neither the opening\r\nnor the closing of the heavy door; no faintest sound of breathing; the\r\nsilence held, borrowing a tension from the electric air. Remote, as\r\nthrough many thicknesses of walls, there came to her now, as from a world\r\nremoved, the night noises of the City, muted by distance to a vague\r\nshadow of clamor, faint and far.\r\n\r\nBut that velvet black before her was, as she knew, most terribly endowed\r\nwith motion, sinister, alive, awaiting merely the spark, the pressure of\r\nrigid finger upon trigger, the touch of hand against hand, the faintest\r\nwhisper of a sound, to dissolve in a chaos of red ruin—and with it the\r\nruin of her world.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, again she heard that muffled ticking, this time close at\r\nhand, and with it, as she fancied, the faint breathing of a man. But\r\neven as she heard it, it receded, died; there came the faint _snick_\r\nof metal upon metal, like the _snick_ and slither of a steel blade; it\r\nwas followed by a sort of chugging impact, like the sound made by a\r\nknife sheathed home, say, at the base of a man’s brain, or between the\r\nshoulders—a sound to freeze the blood.\r\n\r\nThat Armitage could have been capable of this she could not believe,\r\nbut upon the instant her flesh crawled abruptly at the thought; of the\r\ninvisible duelists but one remained now, and he was coming toward her;\r\nshe fancied she could hear the faint, scarce-audible footfall on the\r\nthick pile of the rug.\r\n\r\nAnd then—the silence was abruptly broken by a shattering crash. The\r\nintruder, unfamiliar with the room’s interior, had swept a great vase\r\nfrom the mantel.\r\n\r\nAnd then, distinct and clear, she heard the sodden impact of fist on\r\nflesh, a heaving grunt, the lift and strain of heavy bodies, close-locked.\r\n\r\nAnd following this, in a sudden fury, all round the room the pictures\r\nrattled in their frames; the flooring shook; a heavy desk went over in a\r\nsmashing ruin; grunts followed it, the straining shock of big men in a\r\ndeath-grapple. But mostly it was a fight in silence and darkness, with\r\nthe quick, hard breathing of men at the last desperate urge of their\r\nspent strength.\r\n\r\nWith her finger again upon the light-switch, again she hesitated, and\r\nin that flash of time she heard all at once a quick, sobbing breath—a\r\ngroan—then silence.\r\n\r\nSomewhere out there in that midnight blackness her husband might be\r\nlying wounded—dead—above him the beast whom she had known as Ronald\r\nthe Debonair, turning his face now toward the girl who, shivering and\r\ndefenseless, crouched forlorn upon the bed.\r\n\r\nBut even as this fresh terror out of the dark assailed her, there came a\r\nheavy crash—another—the barking rattle of an automatic, the quick flashes\r\nstabbing into the murk to right and left.\r\n\r\nThe roaring crashes beat upon her ears like a tocsin of doom, and then,\r\nin answer, three answering shots, deliberate, slow. With them there came\r\nthe slumping fall of a heavy body, and the labored breathing of a man.\r\n\r\nThe duel was over.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the silence held. Dreading what the coming of the light\r\nmight reveal, her finger, hovering upon the push-button, came away;\r\nthen, with an agony of effort, made a darting thrust.\r\n\r\nAnd as the light sprang to full flower she looked with white face and\r\nstaring eyes, upon the tall figure in the doorway.\r\n\r\nIt was Robert Daventry!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut her hysterical, glad cry was stifled in her throat as her husband,\r\nbending forward over the rug, turned over the dead man with his foot.\r\n\r\nFearful, yet eager to see, she rose upon her knees, peering with wide\r\neyes over the foot-board.\r\n\r\nThen—hysteria seized her with, by turns, a sudden storm of mingled\r\nweeping and frantic laughter.\r\n\r\n“That.... _That_...!” she cried, pointing a shaking finger at the still\r\nfigure on the carpet.\r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\n“Oh, my God!... it might have been—!”\r\n\r\nBut Daventry, gazing with a grim face at the rigid figure of the\r\nhousebreaker—the unclean skin, with its bristly stubble of unshaven chin,\r\nblue now under the lights—thought it merely the natural reaction of the\r\nterrific strain which she had undergone.\r\n\r\n“You mean—it might have been—_me_!” he said slowly. “Well—of course....”\r\n\r\n“Of course, Dear,” lied Rita Daventry, with a misty smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMummies Made by Electricity\r\n\r\n\r\nR. F. McCampbell, a Chicago undertaker, claims he has invented a process\r\nof embalming a dead body so that it will last forever. For twelve years\r\nMr. McCampbell has been working on his process, and he now exhibits a\r\nmodern mummy, lying in grandeur in an elaborate coffin, as proof that\r\nhe has succeeded. By dehydrating a body with electricity, he says, its\r\nnatural expression, even its complexion, may be preserved for ages.\r\n\r\n“In the dehydration process performed by the Egyptians,” said Mr.\r\nMcCampbell, “the body was buried in the sand for seventy days. Then linen\r\nwas wrapped about the corpse to prevent reabsorption of water and the\r\nbody was placed away in a tomb. Through the electrical process the body\r\nwill retain its lifelike appearance. It will be particularly valuable for\r\npreserving the bodies of great men so that future generations may see\r\nthem as lifelike as the day they died.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTERPIECES OF WEIRD FICTION\r\n\r\n_No. 1—The Haunted and the Haunters; or, The House and the Brain_\r\n\r\n_By_ BULWER LYTTON\r\n\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, who is a man of letters and a philosopher, said to me\r\none day, as if between jest and earnest, “Fancy! since we last met I have\r\ndiscovered a haunted house in the midst of London.”\r\n\r\n“Really haunted—and by what?—ghosts?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t answer that question; all I know is this: six weeks ago\r\nmy wife and I were in search of a furnished apartment. Passing a quiet\r\nstreet, we saw on the window of one of the houses a bill, ‘Apartments,\r\nFurnished.’ The situation suited us; we entered the house, liked the\r\nrooms, engaged them by the week—and left them the third day. No power on\r\nearth could have reconciled my wife to stay longer; and I don’t wonder at\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“What did you see?”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me; I have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious\r\ndreamer—nor, on the other hand, could I ask you to accept on my\r\naffirmation what you would hold to be incredible without the evidence of\r\nyour own senses. Let me only say this, it was not so much what we saw or\r\nheard (in which you might fairly suppose that we were the dupes of our\r\nown excited fancy, or the victims of imposture in others) that drove us\r\naway, as it was an indefinable terror which seized both of us whenever\r\nwe passed by the door of a certain unfurnished room, in which we neither\r\nsaw nor heard anything. And the strange marvel of all was, that for once\r\nin my life I agreed with my wife, silly woman though she be—and allowed,\r\nafter the third night, that it was impossible to stay a fourth in that\r\nhouse. Accordingly, on the fourth morning I summoned the woman who kept\r\nthe house and attended on us, and told her that the rooms did not quite\r\nsuit us, and we would not stay out our week. She said dryly, ‘I know why;\r\nyou have stayed longer than any other lodger. Few ever stayed a second\r\nnight; none before you a third. But I take it they have been very kind\r\nto you.’\r\n\r\n“‘They—who?’ I asked, affecting to smile.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, they who haunt the house, whoever they are. I do not mind them.\r\nI remember them many years ago, when I lived in this house, not as a\r\nservant; but I know they will be the death of me some day. I don’t\r\ncare,—I’m old, and must die soon anyhow; and then I shall be with them,\r\nand in this house still.’ The woman spoke with so dreary a calmness\r\nthat really it was a sort of awe that prevented my conversing with her\r\nfurther. I paid for my week, and too happy were my wife and I to get off\r\nso cheaply.”\r\n\r\n“You excite my curiosity,” said I; “nothing I should like better than to\r\nsleep in a haunted house. Pray give me the address of the one which you\r\nleft so ignominiously.”\r\n\r\nMy friend gave me the address; and when we parted, I walked straight\r\ntoward the house thus indicated.\r\n\r\nIt is situated on the north side of Oxford Street, in a dull but\r\nrespectable thoroughfare. I found the house shut up—no bill at the\r\nwindow, and no response to my knock. As I was turning away, a beer-boy,\r\ncollecting pewter pots at the neighboring areas, said to me, “Do you want\r\nany one at that house, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I heard it was to be let.”\r\n\r\n“Let!—why, the woman who kept it is dead—has been dead these three weeks,\r\nand no one can be found to stay there, though Mr. J⸺ offered ever so\r\nmuch. He offered mother who chars for him, £1 a week just to open and\r\nshut the windows, and she would not.”\r\n\r\n“Would not!—and why?”\r\n\r\n“The house is haunted; and the old woman who kept it was found dead in\r\nher bed, with her eyes wide open. They say the devil strangled her.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! You speak of Mr. J⸺. Is he the owner of the house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where does he live?”\r\n\r\n“In G⸺ Street, No. —.”\r\n\r\n“What is he? In any business?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir—nothing particular; a single gentleman.”\r\n\r\nI gave the potboy the gratuity earned by his liberal information, and\r\nproceeded to Mr. J⸺, in G⸺ Street, which was close by the street that\r\nboasted the haunted house. I was lucky enough to find Mr. J⸺ at home—an\r\nelderly man with intelligent countenance and prepossessing manners.\r\n\r\nI communicated my name and my business frankly. I said I heard the house\r\nwas considered to be haunted—that I had a strong desire to examine a\r\nhouse with so equivocal a reputation; that I should be greatly obliged\r\nif he would allow me to hire it, though only for a night. I was willing\r\nto pay for that privilege whatever he might be inclined to ask. “Sir,”\r\nsaid Mr. J⸺, with great courtesy, “the house is at your service, for as\r\nshort or as long a time as you please. Rent is out of the question—the\r\nobligation will be on my side should you be able to discover the cause of\r\nthe strange phenomena which at present deprive it of all value. I cannot\r\nlet it, for I cannot even get a servant to keep it in order or answer\r\nthe door. Unluckily the house is haunted, if I may use that expression,\r\nnot only by night, but by day, though at night the disturbances are of\r\na more unpleasant and sometimes of a more alarming character. The poor\r\nold woman who died in it three weeks ago was a pauper whom I took out\r\nof a workhouse; for in her childhood she had been known to some of my\r\nfamily, and had once been in such good circumstances that she had rented\r\nthat house of my uncle. She was a woman of superior education and strong\r\nmind, and was the only person I could ever induce to remain in the house.\r\nIndeed, since her death, which was sudden, and the coroner’s inquest,\r\nwhich gave it a notoriety in the neighborhood, I have so despaired of\r\nfinding any person to take charge of the house, much more a tenant, that\r\nI would willingly let it rent free for a year to anyone who would pay its\r\nrates and taxes.”\r\n\r\n“How long is it since the house acquired the sinister character?”\r\n\r\n“That I can scarcely tell you, but very many years since. The old woman\r\nI spoke of, said it was haunted when she rented it between thirty and\r\nforty years ago. The fact is, that my life has been spent in the East\r\nIndies, and in the civil service of the Company. I returned to England\r\nlast year, on inheriting the fortune of an uncle, among whose possessions\r\nwas the house in question. I found it shut up and uninhabited. I was\r\ntold that it was haunted, that no one would inhabit it. I smiled at what\r\nseemed to me so idle a story. I spent some money in repairing it, added\r\nto its old-fashioned furniture a few modern articles—advertised it, and\r\nobtained a lodger for a year. He was a colonel on half pay. He came in\r\nwith his family, a son and a daughter, and four or five servants; they\r\nall left the house the next day; and, although each of them declared that\r\nhe had seen something different from that which had scared the others,\r\na something still was equally terrible to all. I really could not in\r\nconscience sue, nor even blame, the colonel for breach of agreement.\r\nThen I put in the old woman I have spoken of, and she was empowered to\r\nlet the house in apartments. I never had one lodger who stayed more than\r\nthree days. I do not tell you their stories—to no two lodgers have there\r\nbeen exactly the same phenomena repeated. It is better that you should\r\njudge for yourself, than enter the house with an imagination influenced\r\nby previous narratives; only be prepared to see and to hear something or\r\nother, and take whatever precautions you yourself please.”\r\n\r\n“Have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I passed not a night, but three hours in broad daylight alone in\r\nthat house. My curiosity is not satisfied, but it is quenched. I have no\r\ndesire to renew the experiment. You cannot complain, you see, sir, that I\r\nam not sufficiently candid; and unless your interest be exceedingly eager\r\nand your nerves unusually strong, I honestly add, that I advice you _not_\r\nto pass a night in that house.”\r\n\r\n“My interest is exceedingly keen,” said I; “and though only a coward will\r\nboast of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to him, yet my nerves\r\nhave been seasoned in such variety of danger that I have the right to\r\nrely on them—even in a haunted house.”\r\n\r\nMr. J⸺ said very little more; he took the keys of the house out of his\r\nbureau, gave them to me—and, thanking him cordially for his frankness,\r\nand his urbane concession to my wish, I carried off my prize.\r\n\r\nImpatient for the experiment, as soon as I reached home, I summoned my\r\nconfidential servant—a young man of gay spirits, fearless temper, and as\r\nfree from superstitious prejudice as anyone I could think of.\r\n\r\n“F⸺,” said I, “you remember in Germany how disappointed we were at not\r\nfinding a ghost in that old castle which was said to be haunted by a\r\nheadless apparition? Well, I have heard of a house in London which, I\r\nhave reason to hope, is decidedly haunted. I mean to sleep there tonight.\r\nFrom what I hear, there is no doubt that something will allow itself to\r\nbe seen or heard—something, perhaps, excessively horrible. Do you think\r\nif I take you with me, I may rely on your presence of mind, whatever may\r\nhappen?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, pray trust me,” answered F⸺, grinning with delight.\r\n\r\n“Very well; then here are the keys of the house—this is the address. Go\r\nnow—select for me any bedroom you please; and since the house has not\r\nbeen inhabited for weeks, make up a good fire, air the bed well—see, of\r\ncourse, that there are candles as well as fuel. Take with you my revolver\r\nand my dagger—so much for my weapons; arm yourself equally well; and if\r\nwe are not a match for a dozen ghosts, we shall be but a sorry couple of\r\nEnglishmen.”\r\n\r\nI was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that I had\r\nnot leisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which I had\r\nplighted my honor. I dined alone, and very late, and while dining, read,\r\nas is my habit. I selected one of the volumes of Macaulay’s Essays. I\r\nthought to myself that I would take the book with me; there was so much\r\nof healthfulness in the style, and practical life in the subjects, that\r\nit would serve as an antidote against the influences of superstitious\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, about half-past nine, I put the book into my pocket, and\r\nstrolled leisurely toward the haunted house. I took with me a favorite\r\ndog: an exceedingly sharp, bold, and vigilant bull terrier,—a dog fond of\r\nprowling about strange, ghostly corners and passages at night in search\r\nof rats; a dog of dogs for a ghost.\r\n\r\nI reached the house, knocked, and my servant opened with a cheerful smile.\r\n\r\nWe did not stay long in the drawing-rooms,—in fact, they felt so damp\r\nand so chilly that I was glad to get to the fire upstairs. We locked\r\nthe doors of the drawing-rooms,—a precaution which, I should observe,\r\nwe had taken with all the rooms we had searched below. The bedroom my\r\nservant had selected for me was the best on the floor,—a large one, with\r\ntwo windows fronting the street. The four-posted bed, which took up no\r\ninconsiderable space, was opposite to the fire, which burned clear and\r\nbright; a door in the wall to the left, between the bed and the window,\r\ncommunicated with the room which my servant appropriated to himself.\r\nThis last was a small room with a sofa bed, and had no communication\r\nwith the landing place,—no other door but that which conducted to the\r\nbedroom I was to occupy. On either side of my fireplace was a cupboard\r\nwithout locks, flush with the wall, and covered with the same dull-brown\r\npaper. We examined these cupboards,—only hooks to suspend female dresses,\r\nnothing else; we sounded the walls,—evidently solid, the outer walls of\r\nthe building. Having finished the survey of these apartments, warmed\r\nmyself a few moments, and lighted my cigar, I then still accompanied by\r\nF⸺, went forth to complete my reconnoiter. In the landing place there was\r\nanother door; it was closed firmly. “Sir,” said my servant, in surprise,\r\n“I unlocked this door with all the others when I first came; it cannot\r\nhave got locked from the inside, for—”\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished his sentence, the door, which neither of us\r\nthen was touching, opened quietly of itself. We looked at each other a\r\nsingle instant. The same thought seized both,—some human agency might be\r\ndetected here. I rushed in first, my servant followed. A small, blank,\r\ndreary room without furniture; a few empty boxes and hampers in a corner;\r\na small window; the shutters closed; not even a fireplace; no other door\r\nbut that by which we had entered; no carpet on the floor, and the floor\r\nseemed very old, uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and there, as was shown\r\nby the whiter patches on the wood; but no living being, and no visible\r\nplace in which a living being could have hidden. As we stood gazing\r\nround, the door by which we had entered closed as quietly as it had\r\nbefore opened; we were imprisoned.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I felt a creep of indefinable horror. Not so my\r\nservant. “Why, they don’t think to trap us, sir; I could break that\r\ntrumpery door with a kick of my foot.”\r\n\r\n“Try first if it will open to your hand,” said I, shaking off the vague\r\napprehension that had seized me, “while I unclose the shutters and see\r\nwhat is without.”\r\n\r\nI unbarred the shutters,—the window looked on the little back yard I have\r\nbefore described; there was no ledge without,—nothing to break the sheer\r\ndescent of the wall. No man getting out of that window would have found\r\nany footing till he had fallen on the stones below.\r\n\r\nF⸺, meanwhile, was vainly attempting to open the door. He now turned\r\nround to me and asked my permission to use force. And I should\r\nhere state, in justice to the servant, that far from evincing any\r\nsuperstitious terrors, his nerve, composure, and even gayety amidst\r\ncircumstances so extraordinary, compelled my admiration, and made me\r\ncongratulate myself on having secured a companion in every way fitted to\r\nthe occasion. I willingly gave him the permission he required. But though\r\nhe was a remarkably strong man, his force was as idle as his milder\r\nefforts; the door did not even shake to his stoutest kick. Breathless and\r\npanting, he desisted. I then tried the door myself, equally in vain. As I\r\nceased from the effort, again that creep of horror came over me; but this\r\ntime it was more cold and stubborn. I felt as if some strange and ghastly\r\nexhalation were rising up from the chinks of that rugged floor, and\r\nfilling the atmosphere with a venomous influence hostile to human life.\r\nThe door now very slowly and quietly opened as of its own accord. We\r\nprecipitated ourselves into the landing place. We both saw a large, pale\r\nlight—as large as the human figure, but shapeless and unsubstantial—move\r\nbefore us, and ascend the stairs that led from the landing into the\r\nattics. I followed the light, and my servant followed me. It entered, to\r\nthe right of the landing, a small garret, of which the door stood open.\r\nI entered in the same instant. The light then collapsed into a small\r\nglobule, exceedingly brilliant and vivid, rested a moment on a bed in the\r\ncorner, quivered, and vanished. We approached the bed and examined it,—a\r\nhalf-tester, such as is commonly found in attics devoted to servants. On\r\nthe drawers that stood near it we perceived an old faded silk kerchief,\r\nwith the needle still left in a rent half repaired. The kerchief was\r\ncovered with dust; probably it had belonged to the old woman who had last\r\ndied in that house, and this might have been her sleeping room. I had\r\nsufficient curiosity to open the drawers: there were a few odds and ends\r\nof female dress, and two letters tied round with a narrow ribbon of faded\r\nyellow. I took the liberty to possess myself of the letters. We found\r\nnothing else in the room worth noticing,—nor did the light reappear;\r\nbut we distinctly heard, as we turned to go, a pattering footfall on the\r\nfloor, just before us. We went through the other attics (in all four),\r\nthe footfall still preceding us. Nothing to be seen—nothing but the\r\nfootfall heard. I had the letters in my hand; just as I was descending\r\nthe stairs I distinctly felt my wrist seized, and a faint, soft effort\r\nmade to draw the letters from my clasp. I only held them the more\r\ntightly, and the effort ceased.\r\n\r\nWe regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself, and I then remarked\r\nthat my dog had not followed us when we had left it. He was thrusting\r\nhimself close to the fire, and trembling. I was impatient to examine the\r\nletters, and while I read them, my servant opened a little box in which\r\nhe had deposited the weapons I had ordered him to bring, took them out,\r\nplaced them on a table close at my bed head, and then occupied himself in\r\nsoothing the dog, who, however, seemed to heed him very little.\r\n\r\nThe letters were short,—they were dated; the dates exactly thirty-five\r\nyears ago. They were evidently from a lover to his mistress, or a husband\r\nto some young wife. Not only the terms of expression, but a distinct\r\nreference to a former voyage, indicated the writer to have been a\r\nseafarer. The spelling and handwriting were those of a man imperfectly\r\neducated, but still the language itself was forcible. In the expressions\r\nof endearment there was a kind of rough, wild love; but here and there\r\nwere dark unintelligible hints of some secret not of love,—some secret\r\nthat seemed of crime. “We ought to love each other,” was one of the\r\nsentences I remember, “for how everyone else would execrate us if all\r\nwas known.” Again: “Don’t let anyone be in the same room with you at\r\nnight,—you talk in your sleep.” And again: “What’s done can’t be undone;\r\nand I tell you there’s nothing against us unless the dead could come to\r\nlife.” Here there was underlined in a better handwriting (a female’s),\r\n“They do!” At the end of the letter latest in date the same female hand\r\nhad written these words: “Lost at sea the 4th of June, the same day as——”\r\n\r\nI put down the letters, and began to muse over their contents.\r\n\r\nFearing, however, that the train of thought into which I fell might\r\nunsteady my nerves, I fully determined to keep my mind in a fit state to\r\ncope with whatever of marvelous the advancing night might bring forth.\r\nI roused myself; laid the letters on the table; stirred up the fire,\r\nwhich was still bright and cheering; and opened my volume of Macaulay.\r\nI read quietly enough till about half past eleven. I then threw myself\r\ndressed upon the bed, and told my servant he might retire to his own\r\nroom, but must keep himself awake. I bade him leave open the door between\r\nthe two rooms. Thus alone, I kept two candles burning on the table by\r\nmy bed head. I placed my watch beside the weapons, and calmly resumed\r\nmy Macaulay. Opposite to me the fire burned clear; and on the hearth\r\nrug, seemingly asleep, lay the dog. In about twenty minutes I felt an\r\nexceedingly cold air pass by my cheek, like a sudden draught. I fancied\r\nthe door to my right, communicating with the landing place, must have\r\ngot open; but no,—it was closed. I then turned my glance to my left, and\r\nsaw the flame of the candles violently swayed as by a wind. At the same\r\nmoment the watch beside the revolver softly slid from the table,—softly,\r\nsoftly; no visible hand,—it was gone. I sprang up, seizing the revolver\r\nwith the one hand, the dagger with the other; I was not willing that my\r\nweapons should share the fate of the watch. Thus armed, I looked round\r\nthe floor,—no sign of the watch. Three slow, loud, distinct knocks were\r\nnow heard at the bed head: my servant called out, “Is that you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“No; be on your guard.”\r\n\r\nThe dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches, his ears moving\r\nquickly backward and forward. He kept his eyes fixed on me with a look\r\nso strange that he concentered all my attention on himself. Slowly he\r\nrose up, all his hair bristling, and stood perfectly rigid, and with the\r\nsame wild stare. I had no time, however, to examine the dog. Presently\r\nmy servant emerged from his room; and if ever I saw horror in the human\r\nface, it was then. I should not have recognized him had we met in the\r\nstreet, so altered was every lineament. He passed by me quickly, saying,\r\nin a whisper that seemed scarcely to come from his lips, “Run, run! it\r\nis after me!” He gained the door to the landing, pulled it open, and\r\nrushed forth. I followed him into the landing involuntarily, calling him\r\nto stop; but, without heeding me, he bounded down the stairs, clinging\r\nto the balusters, and taking several steps at a time. I heard, where I\r\nstood, the street door open,—heard it again clap to. I was left alone in\r\nthe haunted house.\r\n\r\nIt was but for a moment that I remained undecided whether or not to\r\nfollow my servant; pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a\r\nflight. I reëntered my room, closing the door after me, and proceeded\r\ncautiously into the interior chamber. I encountered nothing to justify my\r\nservant’s terror. I again carefully examined the walls, to see if there\r\nwere any concealed door. I could find no trace of one,—not even a seam\r\nin the dull-brown paper with which the room was hung. How, then, had the\r\nTHING, whatever it was, which had so scared him, obtained ingress except\r\nthrough my own chamber?\r\n\r\nI returned to my room, shut and locked the door that opened upon the\r\ninterior one, and stood on the hearth, expectant and prepared. I now\r\nperceived that the dog had slunk into an angle of the wall, and was\r\npressing himself close against it, as if literally striving to force his\r\nway into it. I approached the animal and spoke to it; the poor brute\r\nwas evidently beside itself with terror. It showed all its teeth, the\r\nslaver dropping from its jaws, and would certainly have bitten me if I\r\nhad touched it. It did not seem to recognize me. Whoever has seen at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens a rabbit, fascinated by a serpent, cowering in\r\na corner, may form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited.\r\nFinding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain, and fearing that his\r\nbite might be as venomous in that state as in the madness of hydrophobia,\r\nI left him alone, placed my weapons on the table beside the fire, seated\r\nmyself, and recommenced my Macaulay.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage, or rather a\r\ncoolness, which the reader may conceive I exaggerate, I may be pardoned\r\nif I pause to indulge in one or two egotistical remarks.\r\n\r\nAs I hold presence of mind, or what is called courage, to be precisely\r\nproportioned to familiarity with the circumstances that lead to it,\r\nso I should say that I had been long sufficiently familiar with all\r\nexperiments that appertain to the marvelous. I had witnessed many very\r\nextraordinary phenomena in various parts of the world,—phenomena that\r\nwould be either totally disbelieved if I stated them, or ascribed to\r\nsupernatural agencies. Now, my theory is that the supernatural is the\r\nimpossible, and that what is called supernatural is only a something in\r\nthe laws of Nature of which we have been hitherto ignorant. Therefore,\r\nif a ghost rise before me, I have not the right to say, “So, then, the\r\nsupernatural is possible;” but rather, “So, then, the apparition of a\r\nghost is, contrary to received opinion, within the laws of Nature,—that\r\nis, not supernatural.”\r\n\r\nNow, in all that I had hitherto witnessed, and indeed in all the wonders\r\nwhich the amateurs of mystery in our age record as facts, a material\r\nliving agency is always required. On the Continent you will find still\r\nmagicians who assert that they can raise spirits. Assume for the moment\r\nthat they assert truly, still the living material form of the magician is\r\npresent; and he is the material agency by which, from some constitutional\r\npeculiarities, certain strange phenomena are represented to your natural\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nAccept, again, as truthful, the tales of spirit manifestation in\r\nAmerica,—musical or other sounds; writings on paper, produced by no\r\ndiscernible hand; articles of furniture moved without apparent human\r\nagency; or the actual sight and touch of hands, to which no bodies\r\nseem to belong,—still there must be found the MEDIUM, or living being,\r\nwith constitutional peculiarities capable of obtaining these signs. In\r\nfine, in all such marvels, supposing even that there is no imposture,\r\nthere must be a human being like ourselves by whom, or through whom,\r\nthe effects presented to human beings are produced. It is so with the\r\nnow familiar phenomena of mesmerism or electro-biology; the mind of the\r\nperson operated on is affected through a material living agent. Nor,\r\nsupposing it true that a mesmerized patient can respond to the will or\r\npasses of a mesmerizer a hundred miles distant, is the response less\r\noccasioned by a material being; if may be through a material fluid—call\r\nit Electric, call it Odic, call it what you will—which has the power\r\nof traversing space and passing obstacles, that the material effect\r\nis communicated from one to the other. Hence, all that I had hitherto\r\nwitnessed, or expected to witness, in this strange house, I believe to\r\nbe occasioned through some agency or medium as mortal as myself; and\r\nthis idea necessarily prevented the awe with which those who regard\r\nas supernatural things that are not within the ordinary operations of\r\nNature, might have been impressed by the adventures of that memorable\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAs, then, it was my conjecture that all that was presented, or would be\r\npresented to my senses, must originate in some human being gifted by\r\nconstitution with the power so to present them, and having some motive\r\nso to do, I felt an interest in my theory which, in its way, was rather\r\nphilosophical than superstitious. And I can sincerely say that I was in\r\nas tranquil a temper for observation as any practical experimentalist\r\ncould be in awaiting the effects of some rare, though perhaps perilous,\r\nchemical combination. Of course, the more I kept my mind detached from\r\nfancy, the more the temper fitted for observation would be obtained; and\r\nI therefore riveted eye and thought on the strong daylight sense in the\r\npage of my Macaulay.\r\n\r\nI now became aware that something interposed between the page and the\r\nlight,—the page was overshadowed. I looked up, and I saw what I shall\r\nfind it very difficult, perhaps impossible, to describe.\r\n\r\nIt was a Darkness shaping itself forth from the air in very undefined\r\noutline. I cannot say it was of a human form, and yet it had more\r\nresemblance to a human form, or rather shadow, than to anything else. As\r\nit stood, wholly apart and distinct from the air and the light around it,\r\nits dimensions seemed gigantic, the summit nearly touching the ceiling.\r\nWhile I gazed, a feeling of intense cold seized me. An iceberg before me\r\ncould not more have chilled me; nor could the cold of an iceberg have\r\nbeen more purely physical. I feel convinced that it was not the cold\r\ncaused by fear. As I continued to gaze, I thought—but this I cannot say\r\nwith precision—that I distinguished two eyes looking down on me from the\r\nheight. One moment I fancied that I distinguished them clearly, the next\r\nthey seemed gone; but still two rays of a pale-blue light frequently shot\r\nthrough the darkness, as from the height on which I half believed, half\r\ndoubted, that I had encountered the eyes.\r\n\r\nI strove to speak,—my voice utterly failed me; I could only think\r\nto myself, “Is this fear? It is _not_ fear!” I strove to rise,—in\r\nvain; I felt as if weighed down by an irresistible force. Indeed,\r\nmy impression was that of an immense and overwhelming Power opposed\r\nto my volition,—that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a force\r\nbeyond man’s, which one may feel _physically_ in a storm at sea, in a\r\nconflagration, or when confronting some terrible wild beast, or rather,\r\nperhaps, the shark of the ocean, I felt _morally_. Opposed to my will was\r\nanother will, as far superior to its strength as storm, fire, and shark\r\nare superior in material force to the force of man.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as this impression grew on me,—now came, at last, horror, horror\r\nto a degree that no words can convey. Still I retained pride, if not\r\ncourage; and in my own mind I said, “This is horror; but it is not fear;\r\nunless I fear I cannot be harmed; my reason rejects this thing; it is\r\nan illusion,—I do not fear.” With a violent effort I succeeded at last\r\nin stretching out my hand toward the weapon on the table; as I did so,\r\non the arm and shoulder I received a strange shock, and my arm fell to\r\nmy side powerless. And now, to add to my horror, the light began slowly\r\nto wane from the candles,—they were not, as it were, extinguished, but\r\ntheir flame seemed very gradually withdrawn; it was the same with the\r\nfire,—the light was extracted from the fuel; in a few minutes the room\r\nwas in utter darkness. The dread that came over me, to be thus in the\r\ndark with that dark Thing, whose power was so intensely felt, brought a\r\nreaction of nerve. In fact, terror had reached that climax, that either\r\nmy senses must have deserted me, or I must have burst through the spell.\r\nI did burst through it. I found voice, though the voice was a shriek. I\r\nremember that I broke forth with words like these, “I do not fear, my\r\nsoul does not fear”; and at the same time I found strength to rise. Still\r\nin that profound gloom I rushed to one of the windows; tore aside the\r\ncurtain; flung open the shutters; my first thought was—LIGHT. And when I\r\nsaw the moon high, clear, and calm, I felt a joy that almost compensated\r\nfor the previous terror. There was the moon, there was also the light\r\nfrom the gas lamps in the deserted slumberous street. I turned to look\r\nback into the room; the moon penetrated its shadow very palely and\r\npartially—but still there was light. The dark Thing, whatever it might\r\nbe, was gone,—except that I could yet see a dim shadow, which seemed the\r\nshadow of that shade, against the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nMy eye now rested on the table, and from under the table (which was\r\nwithout cloth or cover,—an old mahogany round table) there rose a hand,\r\nvisible as far as the wrist. It was a hand, seemingly, as much of flesh\r\nand blood as my own, but the hand of an aged person, lean, wrinkled,\r\nsmall too,—a woman’s hand. That hand very softly closed on the two\r\nletters that lay on the table; hand and letters both vanished. There then\r\ncame the same three loud, measured knocks I had heard at the bed head\r\nbefore this extraordinary drama had commenced.\r\n\r\nAs those sounds slowly ceased, I felt the whole room vibrate sensibly;\r\nand at the far end there rose, as from the floor, sparks or globules\r\nlike bubbles of light, many colored,—green, yellow, fire-red, azure. Up\r\nand down, to and fro, hither, thither as tiny Will-o’-the-Wisps, the\r\nsparks moved, slow or swift, each at its own caprice. A chair (as in\r\nthe drawing-room below) was now advanced from the wall without apparent\r\nagency, and placed at the opposite side of the table. Suddenly, as forth\r\nfrom the chair, there grew a shape,—a woman’s shape. It was distinct as a\r\nshape of life,—ghastly as a shape of death. The face was that of youth,\r\nwith a strange, mournful beauty; the throat and shoulders were bare, the\r\nrest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white. It began sleeking\r\nits long, yellow hair, which fell over its shoulders; its eyes were\r\nnot turned toward me, but to the door; it seemed listening, watching,\r\nwaiting. The shadow of the shade in the background grew darker; and\r\nagain I thought I beheld the eyes gleaming out from the summit of the\r\nshadow,—eyes fixed upon that shape.\r\n\r\nAs if from the door, though it did not open, there grew out another\r\nshape, equally distinct, equally ghastly,—a man’s shape, a young man’s.\r\nIt was in the dress of the last century, or rather in a likeness of\r\nsuch dress (for both the male shape and the female, though defined,\r\nwere evidently unsubstantial, impalpable,—simulacra, phantasms); and\r\nthere was something incongruous, grotesque, yet fearful, in the contrast\r\nbetween the elaborate finery, the courtly precision of that old-fashioned\r\ngarb, with its ruffles and lace and buckles, and the corpselike aspect\r\nand ghostlike stillness of the flitting wearer. Just as the male shape\r\napproached the female, the dark Shadow started from the wall, all three\r\nfor a moment wrapped in darkness. When the pale light returned, the two\r\nphantoms were as if in the grasp of the Shadow that towered between them;\r\nand there was blood stain on the breast of the female; and the phantom\r\nmale was leaning on its phantom sword, and blood seemed trickling fast\r\nfrom the ruffles from the lace; and the darkness of the intermediate\r\nShadow swallowed them up,—they were gone. And again the bubbles of light\r\nshot, and sailed, and undulated, growing thicker and thicker and more\r\nwildly confused in their movements.\r\n\r\nThe closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened, and from the\r\naperture there came the form of an aged woman. In her hand she held\r\nletters,—the very letters over which I had seen _the_ Hand close; and\r\nbehind her I heard a footstep. She turned round as if to listen, and then\r\nshe opened the letters and seemed to read; and over her shoulder I saw a\r\nlivid face, the face as of a man long drowned,—bloated, bleached, seaweed\r\ntangled in its dripping hair; and at her feet lay a form as of a corpse;\r\nand beside the corpse there cowered a child, a miserable, squalid child,\r\nwith famine in its cheeks and fear in its eyes. And as I looked in the\r\nold woman’s face, the wrinkles and lines vanished, and it became a face\r\nof youth,—hard-eyed, stony, but still youth; and the Shadow darted forth,\r\nand darkened over these phantoms as it had darkened over the last.\r\n\r\nNothing now was left but the Shadow, and on that my eyes were intently\r\nfixed, till again eyes grew out of the Shadow,—malignant, serpent eyes.\r\nAnd the bubbles of light again rose and fell, and in their disordered,\r\nirregular, turbulent maze, mingled with the wan moonlight. And now from\r\nthese globules themselves, as from the shell of an egg, monstrous things\r\nburst out; the air grew filled with them: larvæ so bloodless and so\r\nhideous that I can in no way describe them except to remind the reader of\r\nthe swarming life which the solar microscope brings before his eyes in\r\na drop of water,—things transparent, supple, agile, chasing each other,\r\ndevouring each other; forms like naught ever beheld by the naked eye.\r\nAs the shapes were without symmetry, so their movements were without\r\norder. In their very vagrancies there was no sport; they came round\r\nme and round, thicker and faster and swifter, swarming over my head,\r\ncrawling over my right arm, which was outstretched in involuntary command\r\nagainst all evil beings. Sometimes I felt myself touched, but not by\r\nthem; invisible hands touched me. Once I felt the clutch as of cold, soft\r\nfingers at my throat. I was still equally conscious that if I gave way to\r\nfear I should be in bodily peril; and I concentered all my faculties in\r\nthe single focus of resisting stubborn will. And I turned my sight from\r\nthe Shadow; above all, from those strange serpent eyes,—eyes that had now\r\nbecome distinctly visible. For there, though in naught else around me, I\r\nwas aware that there was a WILL, and a will of intense, creative, working\r\nevil, which might crush down my own.\r\n\r\nThe pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as if in the air\r\nof some near conflagration. The larvæ grew lurid as things that live\r\nin fire. Again the room vibrated; again were heard the three measured\r\nknocks; and again all things were swallowed up in the darkness of the\r\ndark Shadow, as if out of that darkness all had come, into that darkness\r\nall returned.\r\n\r\nAs the gloom receded, the Shadow was wholly gone. Slowly, as it had been\r\nwithdrawn, the flame grew again into the candles on the table, again into\r\nthe fuel in the grate. The whole room came once more calmly, healthfully\r\ninto sight.\r\n\r\nThe two doors were still closed, the door communicating with the\r\nservant’s room still locked. In the corner of the wall, into which he had\r\nso convulsively niched himself, lay the dog. I called to him—no movement;\r\nI approached—the animal was dead; his eyes protruded; his tongue out of\r\nhis mouth; the froth gathered round his jaws. I took him in my arms;\r\nI brought him to the fire. I felt acute grief for the loss of my poor\r\nfavorite—acute self-reproach; I accused myself of his death; I imagined\r\nhe had died of fright. But what was my surprise on finding that his neck\r\nwas actually broken. Had this been done in the dark? Must it not have\r\nbeen by a hand human as mine; must there not have been a human agency all\r\nthe while in that room? Good cause to suspect it. I cannot tell. I cannot\r\ndo more than state the fact fairly; the reader may draw his own inference.\r\n\r\nAnother surprising circumstance—my watch was restored to the table from\r\nwhich it had been so mysteriously withdrawn; but it had stopped at the\r\nvery moment it was so withdrawn, nor, despite all the skill of the\r\nwatchmaker, has it ever gone since—that is, it will go in a strange,\r\nerratic way for a few hours, and then come to a dead stop; it is\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\nNothing more chanced for the rest of the night. Nor, indeed, had I long\r\nto wait before the dawn broke. Not till it was broad daylight did I quit\r\nthe haunted house. Before I did so, I revisited the little blind room\r\nin which my servant and myself had been for a time imprisoned. I had a\r\nstrong impression—for which I could not account—that from that room had\r\noriginated the mechanism of the phenomena, if I may use the term, which\r\nhad been experienced in my chamber. And though I entered it now in the\r\nclear day, with the sun peering through the filmy window, I still felt,\r\nas I stood on its floors, the creep of the horror which I had first\r\nthere experienced the night before, and which had been so aggravated by\r\nwhat had passed in my own chamber. I could not, indeed, bear to stay\r\nmore than half a minute within those walls. I descended the stairs, and\r\nagain I heard the footfall before me; and when I opened the street door,\r\nI thought I could distinguish a very low laugh. I gained my own home,\r\nexpecting to find my runaway servant there; but he had not presented\r\nhimself, nor did I hear more of him for three days, when I received a\r\nletter from him, dated from Liverpool to this effect:\r\n\r\n“Honored Sir:—I humbly entreat your pardon, though I can scarcely hope\r\nthat you will think that I deserve it, unless—which Heaven forbid!—you\r\nsaw what I did. I feel that it will be years before I can recover\r\nmyself; and as to being fit for service, it is out of the question. I\r\nam therefore going to my brother-in-law at Melbourne. The ship sails\r\ntomorrow. Perhaps the long voyage may set me up. I do nothing now but\r\nstart and tremble, and fancy IT is behind me. I humbly beg you, honored\r\nsir, to order my clothes, and whatever wages are due me, to be sent to my\r\nmother’s, at Walworth.—John knows her address.”\r\n\r\nThe letter ended with additional apologies, somewhat incoherent and\r\nexplanatory details as to effects that had been under the writer’s charge.\r\n\r\nThis flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to go\r\nto Australia, and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with\r\nthe events of the night. I say nothing in refutation of that conjecture;\r\nrather, I suggest it as one that would seem to many persons the most\r\nprobable solution of improbable occurrences. My belief in my own theory\r\nremained unshaken. I returned in the evening to the house, to bring away\r\nin a hack cab the things I had left there, with my poor dog’s body. In\r\nthis task I was not disturbed, nor did any incident worth note befall\r\nme, except that still, on ascending and descending the stairs, I heard\r\nthe same footfalls in advance. On leaving the house, I went to Mr. J⸺’s.\r\nHe was at home. I returned him the keys, told him that my curiosity was\r\nsufficiently gratified, and was about to relate quickly what had passed,\r\nwhen he stopped me, and said, though with much politeness, that he had no\r\nlonger any interest in a mystery which none had ever solved.\r\n\r\nI determined at least to tell him of the two letters I had read, as well\r\nas of the extraordinary manner in which they had disappeared; and I then\r\ninquired if he thought they had been addressed to the woman who had died\r\nin the house, and if there were anything in her early history which could\r\npossibly confirm the dark suspicions to which the letters gave rise. Mr.\r\nJ⸺ seemed startled, and, after musing a few moments, answered, “I am but\r\nlittle acquainted with the woman’s earlier history, except as I before\r\ntold you, that her family were known to mine. But you revive some vague\r\nreminiscences to her prejudice. I will make inquiries, and inform you of\r\ntheir result. Still, even if we could admit the popular superstition that\r\na person who had been either the perpetrator or the victim of dark crimes\r\nin life could revisit, as a restless spirit, the scene in which those\r\ncrimes had been committed, I should observe that the house was infested\r\nby strange sights and sounds before the old woman died—you smile—what\r\nwould you say?”\r\n\r\n“I would say this, that I am convinced, if we could get to the bottom of\r\nthese mysteries, we should find a living human agency.”\r\n\r\n“What! you believe it is all an imposture? For what object?”\r\n\r\n“Not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word. If suddenly I were\r\nto sink into a deep sleep, from which you could not awake me, but in that\r\nsleep could answer questions with an accuracy which I could not pretend\r\nto when awake,—tell you what money you had in your pocket, nay, describe\r\nyour very thoughts,—it is not necessarily an imposture, any more than it\r\nis necessarily supernatural. I should be, unconsciously to myself, under\r\na mesmeric influence, conveyed to me from a distance by a human being who\r\nhad acquired power over me my previous _rapport_.”\r\n\r\n“But if a mesmerizer could so affect another living being, can you\r\nsuppose that a mesmerizer could also affect inanimate objects: move\r\nchairs,—open and shut doors?\r\n\r\n“Or impress our senses with the belief in such effects,—we never having\r\nbeen _en rapport_ with the person acting on us? No. What is commonly\r\ncalled mesmerism could not do this; but there may be a power akin to\r\nmesmerism, and superior to it,—the power that in the old days was called\r\nMagic. That such a power may extend to all inanimate objects of matter, I\r\ndo not say; but if so, it would not be against Nature,—it would be only a\r\nrare power in Nature which might be given to constitutions with certain\r\npeculiarities, and cultivated by practice to an extraordinary degree.\r\nThat such a power might extend over the dead,—that is, over certain\r\nthoughts and memories that the dead may still retain,—and compel, not\r\nthat which ought properly to be called the SOUL, and which is far beyond\r\nhuman reach, but rather a phantom of what has been most earth-stained\r\non earth, to make itself apparent to our senses, is a very ancient\r\nthough obsolete theory upon which I will hazard no opinion. But I do not\r\nconceive the power would be supernatural. Let me illustrate what I mean\r\nfrom an experiment which Paracelsus describes as not difficult, and which\r\nthe author of the ‘Curiosities of Literature’ cites as credible: A flower\r\nperishes; you burn it. Whatever were the elements of that flower while it\r\nlived are gone, dispersed, you know not whither; you can never discover\r\nnor re-collect them. But you can, by chemistry, out of the burned dust of\r\nthat flower, raise a spectrum of the flower, just as it seemed in life.\r\nIt may be the same with the human being. The soul has as much escaped you\r\nas the essence or elements of the flower. Still you may make a spectrum\r\nof it. And this phantom, though in the popular superstition it is held to\r\nbe the soul of the departed, must not be confounded with the true soul;\r\nit is but the eidolon of the dead form. Hence, like the best-attested\r\nstories of ghosts or spirits, the thing that most strikes us is the\r\nabsence of what we hold to be soul,—that is, of superior emancipated\r\nintelligence. These apparitions come for little or no object,—they seldom\r\nspeak when they do come; if they speak, they utter no ideas above those\r\nof an ordinary person on earth. American spirit seers have published\r\nvolumes of communications, in prose and verse, which they assert to\r\nbe given in the names of the most illustrious dead: Shakespeare,\r\nBacon,—Heaven knows whom. Those communications, taking the best, are\r\ncertainly not a whit of higher order than would be communications from\r\nliving persons of fair talent and education; they are wondrously inferior\r\nto what Bacon, Shakespeare, and Plato said and wrote when on earth. Nor,\r\nwhat is more noticeable, do they ever contain an idea that was not on the\r\nearth before. Wonderful, therefore, as such phenomena may be (granting\r\nthem to be truthful), I see much that philosophy may question, nothing\r\nthat it is incumbent on philosophy to deny,—namely, nothing supernatural.\r\nThey are but ideas conveyed somehow or other (we have not yet discovered\r\nthe means) from one mortal brain to another. Whether, in so doing,\r\ntables walk of their own accord, or fiendlike shapes appear in a magic\r\ncircle, or bodiless hands rise and remove material objects, or a Thing\r\nof Darkness, such as presented itself to me, freeze our blood,—still am\r\nI persuaded that these are but agencies conveyed, as by electric wires,\r\nto my own brain from the brain of another. In some constitutions there\r\nis a natural chemistry, and those constitutions may produce chemic\r\nwonders,—in others a natural fluid, call it electricity, and these may\r\nproduce electric wonders. But the wonders differ from Normal Science in\r\nthis,—they are alike objectless, purposeless, puerile, frivolous. They\r\nlead on to no grand results; and therefore the world does not heed,\r\nand true sages have not cultivated them. But sure I am, that of all I\r\nsaw or heard, a man, human as myself, was the remote originator; and\r\nI believe unconsciously to himself as to the exact effects produced,\r\nfor this reason: no two persons, you say, have ever told you that they\r\nexperienced exactly the same thing. Well, observe, no two persons ever\r\nexperience exactly the same dream. If this were an ordinary imposture,\r\nthe machinery would be arranged for results that would but little vary;\r\nif it were a supernatural agency permitted by the Almighty, it would\r\nsurely be for some definite end. These phenomena belong to neither class;\r\nmy persuasion is, that they originate in some brain now far distant; that\r\nthat brain had no distinct volition in anything that occurred; that what\r\ndoes occur reflects but its devious, motley, ever-shifting, half-formed\r\nthoughts; in short that it has been but the dreams of such a brain put\r\ninto action and invested with a semisubstance. That this brain is of\r\nimmense power, that it can set matter into movement, that it is malignant\r\nand destructive, I believe; some material force must have killed my dog;\r\nthe same force might, for aught I know, have sufficed to kill myself, had\r\nI been as subjugated by terror as the dog,—had my intellect or my spirit\r\ngiven me no countervailing resistance in my will.”\r\n\r\n“It killed your dog,—that is fearful! Indeed it is strange that no animal\r\ncan be induced to stay in that house; not even a cat. Rats and mice are\r\nnever found in it.”\r\n\r\n“The instincts of the brute creation detect influences deadly to their\r\nexistence. Man’s reason has a sense less subtle, because it has a\r\nresisting power more supreme. But enough; do you comprehend my theory?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, though imperfectly,—and I accept any crotchet (pardon the word),\r\nhowever odd rather than embrace at once the notion of ghosts and\r\nhobgoblins we imbibed in our nurseries. Still, to my unfortunate house,\r\nthe evil is the same. What on earth can I do with the house?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you what I would do. I am convinced from my own internal\r\nfeelings that the small, unfurnished room at right angles to the door of\r\nthe bedroom which I occupied, forms a starting point or receptacle for\r\nthe influences which haunt the house; and I strongly advise you to have\r\nthe walls open, the floor removed,—nay, the whole room pulled down. I\r\nobserve that it is detached from the body of the house, built over the\r\nsmall backyard, and could be removed without injury to the rest of the\r\nbuilding.”\r\n\r\n“And you think, if I did that——”\r\n\r\n“You would cut off the telegraph wires. Try it. I am so persuaded that I\r\nam right, that I will pay half the expense if you will allow me to direct\r\nthe operations.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I am well able to afford the cost; for the rest allow me to write\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nAbout ten days after I received a letter from Mr. J⸺, telling me that\r\nhe had visited the house since I had seen him; that he had found the\r\ntwo letters I had described, replaced in the drawer from which I had\r\ntaken them; that he had read them with misgivings like my own; that he\r\nhad instituted a cautious inquiry about the woman to whom I rightly\r\nconjectured they had been written. It seemed that thirty-six years ago\r\n(a year before the date of the letters) she had married, against the wish\r\nof her relations, an American of very suspicious character; in fact,\r\nhe was generally believed to have been a pirate. She herself was the\r\ndaughter of very respectable tradespeople, and had served in the capacity\r\nof a nursery governess before her marriage. She had a brother, a widower,\r\nwho was considered wealthy, and who had one child of about six years old.\r\nA month after the marriage the body of this brother was found in the\r\nThames, near London Bridge; there seemed some marks of violence about his\r\nthroat, but they were not deemed sufficient to warrant the inquest in any\r\nother verdict than that of “found drowned.”\r\n\r\nThe American and his wife took charge of the little boy, the deceased\r\nbrother having by his will left his sister the guardian of his only\r\nchild,—and in event of the child’s death the sister inherited. The child\r\ndied about six months afterwards,—it was supposed to have been neglected\r\nand ill-treated. The neighbors deposed to have heard it shriek at night.\r\nThe surgeon who had examined it after death said that it was emaciated as\r\nif from want of nourishment, and the body was covered with livid bruises.\r\nIt seemed that one winter night the child had sought to escape; crept out\r\ninto the back yard; tried to scale the wall; fallen back exhausted; and\r\nbeen found at morning on the stones in a dying state. But though there\r\nwas some evidence of cruelty, there was none of murder; and the aunt and\r\nher husband had sought to palliate cruelty by alleging the exceeding\r\nstubbornness and perversity of the child, who was declared to be\r\nhalf-witted. Be that as it may, at the orphan’s death the aunt inherited\r\nher brother’s fortune. Before the first wedded year was out, the American\r\nquitted England abruptly, and never returned to it. He obtained a\r\ncruising vessel, which was lost in the Atlantic two years afterwards. The\r\nwidow was left in affluence, but reverses of various kinds had befallen\r\nher: a bank broke; an investment failed; she went into a small business\r\nand became insolvent; then she entered into service, sinking lower and\r\nlower, from housekeeper down to maid-of-all-work,—never long retaining\r\na place, though nothing decided against her character was ever alleged.\r\nShe was considered sober, honest, and peculiarly quiet in her ways; still\r\nnothing prospered with her. And so she had dropped into the workhouse,\r\nfrom which Mr. J⸺ had taken her, to be placed in charge of the very house\r\nwhich she had rented as mistress in the first year of her wedded life.\r\n\r\nMr. J⸺ added that he had passed an hour alone in the unfurnished room\r\nwhich I had urged him to destroy, and that his impressions of dread while\r\nthere were so great, though he had neither heard nor seen anything, that\r\nhe was eager to have the walls bared and the floors removed as I had\r\nsuggested. He had engaged persons for the work, and would commence any\r\nday I would name.\r\n\r\nThe day was accordingly fixed. I repaired to the haunted house,—we went\r\ninto the blind, dreary room, took up the skirting, and then the floors.\r\nUnder the rafters, covered with rubbish, was found a trapdoor, quite\r\nlarge enough to admit a man. It was closely nailed down, with clamps and\r\nrivets of iron. On removing these we descended into a room below, the\r\nexistence of which had never been suspected. In this room there had been\r\na window and a flue, but they had been bricked over, evidently for many\r\nyears. By the help of candles we examined this place; it still retained\r\nsome moldering furniture,—three chairs, an oak settle, a table,—all of\r\nthe fashion of about eighty years ago. There was a chest of drawers\r\nagainst the wall, in which we found, half rotted away, old-fashioned\r\narticles of a man’s dress, such as might have been worn eighty or a\r\nhundred years ago by a gentleman of some rank; costly steel buckles and\r\nbuttons, like those yet worn in court dresses, a handsome court sword; in\r\na waistcoat which had once been rich with gold lace, but which was now\r\nblackened and foul with damp, we found five guineas, a few silver coins,\r\nand an ivory ticket, probably for some place of entertainment long since\r\npassed away. But our main discovery was in a kind of iron safe fixed to\r\nthe wall, the lock of which it cost us much trouble to get picked.\r\n\r\nIn this safe were three shelves and two small drawers. Ranged on the\r\nshelves were several small bottles of crystal, hermetically stopped. They\r\ncontained colorless, volatile essences, of the nature of which I shall\r\nonly say that they were not poisons,—phosphor and ammonia entered into\r\nsome of them. There were also some very curious glass tubes, and a small\r\npointed rod of iron, with a large lump of rock crystal, and another of\r\namber,—also a loadstone of great power.\r\n\r\nIn one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold, and\r\nretaining the freshness of its colors most remarkably, considering the\r\nlength of time it had probably been there. The portrait was that of a\r\nman who might be somewhat advanced in middle life, perhaps forty-seven\r\nor forty-eight. It was a remarkable face,—a most impressive face. If\r\nyou could fancy some mighty serpent transformed into man, preserving in\r\nthe human lineaments the old serpent type, you would have a better idea\r\nof that countenance than long descriptions can convey: the width and\r\nflatness of frontal; the tapering elegance of contour disguising the\r\nstrength of the deadly jaw; the long, large terrible eyes, glittering and\r\ngreen as the emerald,—and withal a certain ruthless calm, as if from the\r\nconsciousness of an immense power.\r\n\r\nMechanically I turned round the miniature to examine the back of it,\r\nand on the back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the pentacle\r\na ladder, and the third step of the ladder was formed by the date 1765.\r\nExamining still more minutely, I detected a spring; this, on being\r\npressed, opened the back of the miniature as a lid. Withinside the lid\r\nwere engraved, “Marianna to thee. Be faithful in life and in death to ⸺.”\r\nHere follows a name that I will not mention, but it was not unfamiliar to\r\nme. I had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as the name borne\r\nby a dazzling charlatan who had made a great sensation in London for a\r\nyear or so, and had fled the country on the charge of a double murder\r\nwithin his own house,—that of his mistress and his rival. I said nothing\r\nof this to Mr. J⸺, to whom reluctantly I resigned the miniature.\r\n\r\nWe had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the iron\r\nsafe; we found great difficulty in opening the second: it was not locked,\r\nbut it resisted all efforts, till we inserted in the chinks the edge\r\nof a chisel. When we had thus drawn it forth, we found a very singular\r\napparatus in the nicest order. Upon a small, thin book, or rather\r\ntablet, was placed a saucer of crystal; this saucer was filled with a\r\nclear liquid,—on that liquid floated a kind of compass, with a needle\r\nshifting rapidly round; but instead of the usual points of a compass\r\nwere seven strange characters, not very unlike those used by astrologers\r\nto denote the planets. A peculiar but not strong nor displeasing odor\r\ncame from this drawer, which was lined with a wood that we afterwards\r\ndiscovered to be hazel. Whatever the cause of this odor, it produced\r\na material effect on the nerves. We all felt it, even the two workmen\r\nwho were in the room,—a creeping, tingling sensation from the tips of\r\nthe fingers to the roots of the hair. Impatient to examine the tablet,\r\nI removed the saucer. As I did so the needle of the compass went round\r\nand round with exceeding swiftness, and I felt a shock that ran through\r\nmy whole frame, so that I dropped the saucer on the floor. The liquid\r\nwas spilled; the saucer was broken; the compass rolled to the end of the\r\nroom, and at that instant the walls shook to and fro, as if a giant had\r\nswayed and rocked them.\r\n\r\nThe two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by\r\nwhich we had descended from the trapdoor; but seeing that nothing more\r\nhappened, they were easily induced to return.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had opened the tablet; it was bound in plain red leather,\r\nwith a silver clasp; it contained but one sheet of thick vellum, and on\r\nthat sheet were inscribed, within a double pentacle, words in old monkish\r\nLatin, which are literally to be translated thus: “On all that it can\r\nreach within these walls, sentient or inanimate, living or dead, as moves\r\nthe needle, so works my will! Accursed be the house, and restless be the\r\ndwellers therein.”\r\n\r\nWe found no more. Mr. J⸺ burned the tablet and its anathema. He razed to\r\nthe foundations the part of the building containing the secret room with\r\nthe chamber over it. He had then the courage to inhabit the house himself\r\nfor a month, and a quieter, better-conditioned house could not be found\r\nin all London. Subsequently he let it to advantage, and his tenant has\r\nmade no complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN’S SPIRIT IS PHOTOGRAPHED\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore her death, Mrs. Mary McVickers of Los Angeles requested that a\r\nphotographer be commissioned to take photographs of her body as it lay\r\nin the casket. Accordingly, after she died, C. H. Monroe, a licensed\r\nphotographer, entered the room where her body lay and prepared to obey\r\nher dying wish. In making the pictures, he used a velour screen to\r\nbalance the light; and later he was amazed to find on this screen three\r\nweird impressions that are declared to be “spirit photographs.” Monroe\r\ndeclared the screen was the sort he always used and that he examined\r\nit carefully before photographing the woman’s body and found nothing\r\nunusual about it. Mrs. Mary Vlasek, pastor of the Spiritualist Temple,\r\nand a number of her followers stated positively that they had seen Mrs.\r\nMcVicker’s spirit in the temple, some time after her death, and also at\r\nthe crematory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mystery of the Frightful Invisible Monster Is Solved in the Last\r\nChapters of_\r\n\r\nThe Whispering Thing\r\n\r\n_By_ LAURIE McCLINTOCK _and_ CULPEPER CHUNN\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The first half of “The Whispering Thing” was published in\r\n    the March issue of WEIRD TALES. A copy will be mailed by the\r\n    publishers for 25 cents._\r\n\r\n    A RESUME OF THE EARLY CHAPTERS:\r\n\r\n    Stark terror and mysterious death follow in the wake of an\r\n    unseen demon, which lurks in the city streets and houses,\r\n    whispering in the ears of its victims before killing them.\r\n    Medical examination shows that they were, apparently, strangled\r\n    to death. One of the victims, before dying, declares the breath\r\n    of the Whispering Thing is icy cold. Nobody has seen it. Nobody\r\n    can imagine what it is. Then Jules Peret, French detective who\r\n    is in America, undertakes to fathom the terrible mystery. After\r\n    his preliminary investigation, he goes home, and when he enters\r\n    his darkened rooms he feels an ice-cold breath on his cheek,\r\n    and he knows he is in the presence of the Whispering Thing.\r\n\r\n    THE PRESENT INSTALLMENT STARTS HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VI. (Continued)_\r\n\r\nTHE WHISPERING THING\r\n\r\nWith a stifled cry, Peret whirled round and made a frantic, though\r\nfutile, effort to open the door. In his slapdash haste he struck his head\r\nagainst the jamb and dropped the key.\r\n\r\nCursing fluently under his breath in four languages, he fell to his knees\r\nand felt around on the carpet. Failing to find the key, he sprang to his\r\nfeet and began to fumble on the wall for the push-button.\r\n\r\nBefore he could find it, however, the Thing again whispered its warning\r\nof death in his ear and scorched his face with its icy breath.\r\n\r\nAlmost mad with terror, Peret threw himself backward and crashed against\r\na chair with such violence that he was almost knocked senseless. For a\r\nsecond he lay still, to gather his forces and to fill his bursting lungs\r\nwith air. His clothes were wet with perspiration, and his body cold and\r\nnumb.\r\n\r\nExpecting each instant to feel the vise-like grip of the Thing on his\r\nthroat, he staggered to his feet and made another frantic effort to find\r\nthe push-button. Remembering the flashlight in his pocket, he was about\r\nto reach for it, when he felt the ice-cold breath of the Thing on his\r\nface, and, in an effort to protect himself, he sprang against the wall.\r\nWhat he had been trying for an eternity to accomplish by strategy was now\r\nbrought about by accident. His shoulder struck the push-button, and the\r\nlights flashed on.\r\n\r\nAlmost blinded by the sudden glare, blinking rapidly to clear his vision,\r\nhe took a step back and swept the room with an all-embracing gaze.\r\n\r\nExcept for himself, the room _was unoccupied_!\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, exactly as he had left it earlier in the day. The\r\nroom bore not the slightest evidence of having been entered during his\r\nabsence, nor was there anything large enough to afford a human being a\r\nplace of concealment.\r\n\r\nAs he stood stupidly surveying the room, the whisper of the invisible\r\nmenace once more sounded in his ear!\r\n\r\nWith a cry of terror, Peret whipped out his automatic and, blindly\r\nfanning the air in front of him, pulled the trigger until the magazine\r\nwas empty. A picture fell to the floor with a crash and bits of plaster\r\nflew from the walls and ceiling. Scarcely waiting until the last shot was\r\nfired, Peret snatched the key off the floor and slipped it in the keyhole.\r\n\r\nAs he threw open the door, the Thing again whispered in his ear and\r\nbrushed his face with its clammy breath. With a yell, the Frenchman\r\nprecipitated himself into the hall with such vigor and rapidity of action\r\nthat he fell sprawling. Bounding to his feet, he grabbed the knob and\r\nviolently slammed the door.\r\n\r\n“Victory!” he shouted, and his joy was excessive. “Ah, monster! _cochon!\r\nboyeux!_ Thing or devil! Whatever you are, I’ve got you now! _Oui!_”\r\n\r\nHe shook his fist at the door and hurled at the imprisoned horror a\r\nstring of excited invective.\r\n\r\n“Your hour is come. Your shot is bolt! Assassin! Ghoul! _Voila!_ how you\r\nfrightened me—me, the Terrible Frog! _Dame!_ I am trembling a little yet,\r\nI think.”\r\n\r\nA number of doors along the corridor opened, and men and women in night\r\nattire stuck their heads out cautiously.\r\n\r\n“I say, old top, what’s coming off?” asked one of the startled\r\nindividuals, catching sight of Peret.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” shouted Peret, and wiped the dew from his forehead.\r\n\r\n“You are drunk,” said another man, disgusted. “Go to bed. You are keeping\r\neverybody awake.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a liar!” yelled Peret, and the other, fearing violence hastily\r\nclosed the door.\r\n\r\nPinching his arm to assure himself that he was not the victim of a\r\nnightmare, Peret tried the doorknob to see if the night-latch had, by any\r\nill chance, failed to spring. Having reassured himself on this point, he\r\nturned and, taking the steps four at a time, dashed down the stairs.\r\n\r\nScaring the now thoroughly-awake elevator boy nearly out of his senses\r\nwith his wild gestures and still wilder appearance, Peret careened\r\ninto a telephone booth, and, after being connected with the police\r\nheadquarters, barked into the receiver a few disjointed sentences that\r\nfroze the blood of Central, who had been listening in, and made Detective\r\nSergeant Strange, at the other end of the wire, drop the receiver and\r\nbellow an order that brought everybody within hearing distance to their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Peret, having heard the order as plainly as if he had been in\r\nStrange’s office, reeled out into the lobby and collapsed in a chair to\r\nawait the arrival of the homicide squad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VII._\r\n\r\nPERET EXPLAINS\r\n\r\nAt 9 a. m. on the following morning Jules Peret presented himself at the\r\nfront door of a small, unpretentious red-brick house on Fifteenth Street,\r\none block from the home of the murdered scientist.\r\n\r\nOne would never have suspected from his manner or appearance that, eight\r\nhours previously, he had battled with an invisible menace in the narrow\r\nconfines of a darkened room, and had felt stark terror grip his soul\r\nbefore he emerged triumphant from the most harrowing experience of his\r\nadventurous career. No one would ever have suspected that, because, to\r\nall outward appearance, Peret was at peace with the world and had no\r\nthought on his mind of greater weight than the aroma of the cigarette\r\nbetween his lips. Debonair as ever, and attired with the scrupulous\r\nneatness that was so characteristic of him, he made a picture that had\r\ncaused more than one young lady to pay him the honor of a lingering\r\nglance when, a half-hour previously, he had issued from his apartment and\r\npursued his way down the well populated thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the tinkle of the bell the door was opened three inches by\r\nthe butler, a small, wrinkled, leathery-faced old Chinaman, whose head\r\nwas as bald and shiny as a polished egg. In one hand he held a faded silk\r\nskull cap, which he had evidently just removed from his head or forgotten\r\nto put on.\r\n\r\n“Whatchee want, huh?” he demanded, with a regrettable lack of civility.\r\n\r\n“I want to see your master,” returned Peret courteously, extending his\r\ncard. “Please present my compliments to him, _Monsieur_, and tell him my\r\nbusiness is pressing.”\r\n\r\n“Mlaster no see nobody,” chattered Sing Tong Fat. “He sick. Allee samee\r\ndlunk. No see noblody. Clome back nex’ week.”\r\n\r\n“But it is necessary that I should see your master this morning,” was\r\nPeret’s polite but firm retort. “Your master will be glad enough to see\r\nme when you show him my card.” He displayed his badge of special officer\r\nand added, “Get a wiggle on!”\r\n\r\n“_Yak pozee!_” shrilled Sing Tong Fat indignantly, and opened the door.\r\n“You clazy. Allee samee tong man. Master have you alested.” He contorted\r\nhis face until it resembled a hyena’s, and broke into a shrill laugh.\r\n“_Tchee, tchee._ (yes, yes.) Alee samee tam fool clazy man.”\r\n\r\n“You are an amiable old scamp, _Monsieur_,” laughed Peret. “But we are\r\nlosing time, and time is of importance. Where does your master hang out,\r\neh? I will present my own card.”\r\n\r\n“I tellee him you see him flirst,” chattered the Chinaman. “You wait\r\nhere. He sleepee. Me wakee him up. He sick. Allee samee dlunk. You wait\r\nleddle time. _Tchon-dzee-ti Fan-Fu_ (it is the will of the master).”\r\n\r\nA door on the right side of the hall opened and a man stepped out into\r\nthe hall. In spite of his disheveled hair and the brilliantly-colored\r\ndressing robe that covered his heavy frame, there was no mistaking the\r\nhandsome features of Albert Deweese.\r\n\r\n“’S all right, Sing,” he said, when he saw who his visitor was. “I\r\ndecided to get up for a while.” Then to Peret: “Good-morning, Mr. Peret.\r\nI guess you think I am an inhospitable cuss, what? Fact is, I have been\r\ntrying to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not think you are inhospitable, _Monsieur_,” replied Peret,\r\nas he shook hands. “After your experience last night, you need time to\r\nrecuperate. The wonder of it is that you are able to be up at all.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you there!” responded Deweese with feeling. “I told Sing\r\nlast night when I retired to admit no one this morning until I rang,\r\nwhich accounts for his discourtesy in keeping you waiting. I felt the\r\nneed of a round twelve hours’ sleep to recover from the effects of my\r\nadventure, but I haven’t been able to close my eyes. I feel as if I shall\r\n_never_ be able to close them.”\r\n\r\nDeweese indeed showed the effects of his near-tragic battle with the\r\nWhispering Thing. His face was grayish-white and the heavy black\r\ncircles under his bloodshot eyes accentuated his pallor and gave him an\r\nappearance that was almost ghastly. Had he been stretched out on a bed\r\nand his eyes closed, one could easily have mistaken him for a corpse.\r\n\r\nDismissing the garrulous and indignant old Chinaman, he crossed the hall\r\nand ushered Peret into a large, well-lighted room that was fitted out as\r\na studio. The walls were hung with canvases of an indifferent quality in\r\nvarious stages of completion, and on an easel near a large double window\r\nreposed the half-completed picture of a semi-nude, which immediately\r\ncaught and held the detective’s gaze.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s critical inspection of the painting, Peret remarked:\r\n“You seem to be a busy man, my friend. But I don’t suppose you find much\r\ninterest in your paintings this morning, eh? In fact, you look on the\r\nverge of a collapse. Have you seen your physician yet?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the first thing I did after leaving Berjet’s house last night,”\r\nthe artist replied. “He found nothing serious the matter with me,\r\nhowever. Shock more than anything else, I suppose. But to what do I\r\nowe the pleasure of your visit, Mr. Peret? Have you had any success in\r\nrunning down the Thing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes and no,” answered Peret, and then went on to explain: “We are hot on\r\nthe trail, but haven’t yet succeeded in entirely clearing up the mystery.\r\nIt was in the hope that you would be able to help me a little that I\r\ncalled upon you this morning. I thought you might like to see the affair\r\nthrough to the end.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” cried the artist, his feverish eyes glittering with eagerness.\r\n“After I had gotten some sleep, I intended hunting you up, anyway. You\r\nare right when you say I want to see the thing through to the finish. You\r\ncan count on me to help you in any way that lies in my power. God knows,\r\nthere is no one more eager than myself to get to the bottom of this\r\naffair! With the Whispering Thing still at large—”\r\n\r\nHe shuddered involuntarily, laughed, and added, “It is difficult for you\r\nto understand my feelings, I guess.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it’s not as difficult as you imagine, my friend,” said Peret\r\nquietly, subsiding into a chair. He selected a cigarette from the case\r\nthe artist proffered, and continued: “But let us get down to business.\r\nFirst, I will recount a few facts disclosed by my investigations and then\r\nexplain how you can help me. In the meantime, let us be comfortable. You\r\nare as pale as a ghost. Be seated, my dear fellow, I beg of you,” he\r\nadded with solicitude.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am not as bad off as I may appear,” declared Deweese confidently,\r\ndropping into a chair nevertheless. “I will be all right after a few\r\nhours’ rest. Now, let me have your story. Naturally, I am consumed with\r\ncuriosity to hear what you have discovered.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are a delightful companion, _Monsieur_,” was Peret’s genial\r\nresponse. “Me—I am a great talker, but a poor listener. I will tell you\r\nwhat I know with pleasure. But let me first congratulate you upon the\r\nexcellence of these Persian cigarettes. _Sacre!_ But you have a delicate\r\ntaste, _Monsieur_.”\r\n\r\nThe artist bowed his acknowledgment to the compliment, but impatiently.\r\nIt was evident that he was eager to hear what the Frenchman had on his\r\nmind, and Peret, remarking this, did not keep him longer in suspense.\r\n\r\n“I will not take up your time by recounting all that has transpired since\r\nI saw you last night, _Monsieur_,” began Peret, “and for the sake of\r\nconvenience I will tell my story in a round-about sort of way. Let me\r\nbegin with my first attempt to motivate Berjet’s murder.\r\n\r\n“M. Berjet was, as you are doubtless aware, a scientist of international\r\nrepute. In scientific circles, in fact, he was a towering figure. I have\r\nthe honor of having had a casual acquaintanceship with him for several\r\nyears, and as I knelt beside his dead body on the sidewalk last night I\r\nrecalled to mind many of the achievements that had brought him moderate\r\nwealth and fame. Among other things, I remembered having recently seen a\r\nnewspaper account of a new invention of his—a poison gas of unparalleled\r\ndestructive powers, the formula of which several warring nations have\r\nbeen trying to purchase.\r\n\r\n“As clues were sadly lacking, and our investigation in his house failed\r\nto reveal any satisfactory explanation for Berjet’s death, I at once\r\nassumed that the motive for the murder had been the theft of the formula.\r\nI knew that at least one of the nations that have been trying to acquire\r\nthe formula would go to almost any length to gain possession of a new and\r\nreally effective weapon of this kind. I therefore got in touch with the\r\nSecret Service, which usually has an intimate knowledge of such matters,\r\nand learned several facts that made me more certain than ever that I was\r\non the right track.\r\n\r\n“Berjet’s poison gas, I learned, is indeed a terrible destructive agent.\r\nIt is said to be even more deadly than Lewisite. A minute portion of a\r\ndrop, if placed on the ground, will kill every living thing, vegetable\r\nand animal, within a radius of half a mile. Think, then, what a ton would\r\ndo!\r\n\r\n“Berjet called his invention ‘Q-gas.’ The formula was first offered to\r\nour government for a moderate sum, and rejected, and at the time of his\r\ndeath the savant was negotiating for its sale to the French government.”\r\n\r\n“Surely, you are not going to try to make me believe that this Q-gas\r\nplayed a direct part in the death of Berjet and Sprague and the attack on\r\nme,” interrupted Deweese. “Believe me, Mr. Peret—”\r\n\r\n“I do believe you, my friend,” was Peret’s smiling response. “The gas\r\nitself played no part in the tragedy last night, but the formula is at\r\nthe bottom of all of the trouble, as has been suggested. The murders were\r\nsimply incidental to the robbery of the formula.”\r\n\r\n“Have you discovered who the robber was?” queried Deweese, with natural\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Peret calmly. “Even without clues to work with, this\r\nwould not have been very difficult. Of the several nations that have\r\nbeen trying to get possession of the Q-gas formula there are only one\r\nor two that would authorize their agents to go to such extremes as were\r\nemployed last night to acquire it, and as virtually all of their agents\r\nare known to the Secret Service, our search would have been confined to\r\na limited group of men and women. It would simply have been a matter of\r\nelimination.”\r\n\r\nDeweese nodded his understanding, and the sleuth continued:\r\n\r\n“Almost from the very first, however, for reasons which I will explain\r\nlater, I was led to suspect a man who has since turned out to be a\r\nnotorious international agent, known in diplomatic circles as Count\r\nVincent di Dalfonzo. During his absence, I made a somewhat hurried search\r\nof his rooms after my departure from the scientist’s house, but could\r\nfind nothing to incriminate him.\r\n\r\n“One of my operatives, however, a former Secret Service agent, was able\r\nto identify him, if nothing more. According to this operative, Dalfonzo,\r\nwho is one of the greatest scoundrels unhung, at the present time bears\r\nthe secret credentials of a nation I will leave unnamed, but one which,\r\nI have reason to know, has made several unsuccessful attempts to buy the\r\nQ-gas formula from Berjet.”\r\n\r\nDeweese was leaning forward in his chair, an eager listener. As Peret\r\npaused to relight his cigarette, he remarked:\r\n\r\n“If Dalfonzo is such a notorious character, one would have thought that\r\nthe Secret Service would have kept him under its eye.”\r\n\r\n“One would have thought so, indeed,” agreed Peret, expelling a cloud of\r\nsmoke from his lungs. “When last heard of several months ago, Dalfonzo\r\nwas in Petrograd and he probably entered this country in disguise and has\r\nsince kept himself well under cover.”\r\n\r\n“Have you arrested him?”\r\n\r\n“I have scarcely had time yet, _Monsieur_,” answered Peret. “I feel safe\r\nin saying, however, that he will be in the custody of the police within\r\nthe next twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\n“Good! I will never feel safe while this scoundrel is at large, if indeed\r\nhe really did have a hand in the murders of Berjet, Sprague and Adolphe,\r\nand the attack on me.”\r\n\r\n“Dalfonzo had nothing to do with Adolphe’s murder, and only an indirect\r\nhand in the attack on you,” said Peret. “_Sacre bleu!_ Dalfonzo is not\r\nthe kind of man that strikes down his victims with butcher knives and\r\nsuch; he is a man of delicate ideas and sensibilities, _Monsieur_.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems,” said Deweese drily. “I know that the finger prints on the\r\ndagger tend to prove that Adolphe was murdered by his employer, but in\r\nthe light of the other facts can this evidence be considered conclusive?\r\nThe prints on the dagger may simply be a trick to confuse the police. The\r\nWhispering Thing—But stay! For the moment I had forgotten the Whispering\r\nThing. It seems to me that we are getting away from the main issue.”\r\n\r\n“Patience, _Monsieur_,” said Peret, with an enigmatical smile.\r\n“Everything will be explained in good time. But first, let me assure you\r\nthat the finger prints on the dagger are genuine. Adolphe was undoubtedly\r\nmurdered by the scientist, and as the penalty for this crime he gave his\r\nown life.”\r\n\r\nDeweese started. The Frenchman’s indirect method of telling his story,\r\nand the complacence with which he stated apparently contradictory facts,\r\nconfused and annoyed him.\r\n\r\n“You mean—?” he began.\r\n\r\n“I mean that Berjet was murdered because he stabbed his valet.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” averred Deweese, unable to conceal his impatience, “all of\r\nthis is about as clear as mud to me. First you say that the motive for\r\nBerjet’s murder was the robbery of the formula, and now you declare that\r\nhe was done away with because he killed his valet. What am I to believe?”\r\n\r\n“What you will, _Monsieur_,” replied Peret. “Everything I have stated is\r\ntrue, although I confess that as yet I have nothing to prove it. If the\r\nfacts seem contradictory, it is because I have expressed myself badly.\r\n\r\n“According to my theory, Count Dalfonzo (for a consideration of course),\r\ninduced Adolphe to steal the formula of Q-gas from his benefactor. When\r\npoor Berjet learned that he had been betrayed he stabbed the betrayer\r\nin a fit of insane rage and hid the body in the closet in his library\r\nuntil he would have time to dispose of it. Dalfonzo in some way learned\r\nof this, or suspected it, and as he already had the formula in his\r\npossession, decided that his safest plan would be to murder Berjet before\r\nhe could communicate with French Secret Service agents operating in this\r\ncountry, who were about to consummate the purchase of the secret. _Eh,\r\nbien!_ the murder was committed, and but for one little slip, one tiny\r\nslip—_Ha; ha!_ It is amusing, is it not, _Monsieur_?”\r\n\r\n“Very!” rejoined Deweese sarcastically. “I think, however, that I have\r\nbegun to get a glimmer of what you erroneously conceive to be the truth,\r\nand that is that Dalfonzo and the mysterious Thing are identical.”\r\n\r\n“Patience, _Monsieur_, patience,” cried Peret. “The glimmer of light that\r\nyou see is a will-o’-the wisp. Dalfonzo is a man; the Thing is—the Thing.\r\nThe murders were _instigated_ by Dalfonzo, but were _committed_ by the\r\ninvisible terror.”\r\n\r\nDeweese, as had many a man before him, began to wonder if he had to deal\r\nwith an imbecile or a man by no means as feeble-minded as he seemed. In\r\nhis puzzlement he stared at Peret for a moment, with mouth agape, then\r\nhe leaned forward in his chair until less than two feet separated his\r\ncorpselike face from Peret’s.\r\n\r\n“And what the devil _is_ the Whispering Thing?” he asked sharply.\r\n\r\n“All in good time,” came the amiable reply. “Let us first consider the\r\nlittle slip that upset Dalfonzo’s apple cart.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let us consider the little slip then,” said Deweese, relaxing in\r\nhis chair. “Where did our diplomatic freelance slip?”\r\n\r\n“Why, when he tried to murder me in the same way that he did that poor\r\nBerjet,” quietly responded Peret.\r\n\r\nThe artist half rose from his chair and stared at the detective with\r\nastonishment written on his face.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that _you_ have been attacked by the Whispering\r\nThing?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Just that, _Monsieur_. I was attacked by the whispering phantom in my\r\nrooms last night after I left the scene of the attack on you. You can\r\nrealize, therefore, that I can appreciate all that you have gone through.\r\nIt is true that my experience was, in some respects, not as terrible as\r\nyour own, because I escaped the Thing before it could do me bodily harm.\r\nBut I never expect entirely to recover from the fright it gave me. _Mon\r\ndieu_, what a monster this Dalfonzo is!”\r\n\r\n“It was at his instigation that the Thing attacked you?” questioned\r\nDeweese.\r\n\r\n“Who else?” asked Peret.\r\n\r\n“Well,” cried Deweese, impatiently, “why do you beat around the bush\r\nso much? Be definite. What the devil is the Whispering Thing? And who,\r\nexactly, is the man you call Dalfonzo?”\r\n\r\nPeret lifted his eyes and gazed steadily at the artist.\r\n\r\n“I will answer your second question first, _Monsieur_,” he replied, with\r\nexasperating slowness. “My answer will explain why I have been beating\r\naround the bush, as you call it.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned slightly forward, his right hand in his coat pocket, his eyes\r\nsmiling, the muscles around his mouth tense.\r\n\r\n“Count Vincent di Dalfonzo,” he said, “is the man who at the present time\r\ncalls himself Albert Deweese—_Don’t move, Monsieur!_ The revolver in my\r\ncoat pocket is centered on your heart!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VIII._\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY IS SOLVED.\r\n\r\nIf Peret expected to catch Deweese off his guard, he was sadly\r\ndisappointed. The artist met his gaze squarely, and without any apparent\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nFlicking the ashes from his cold cigarette, he applied a lighted match to\r\nit and tossed the charred splinter upon the floor. The corpselike look\r\nof his face became a little accentuated, perhaps, and there was a slight\r\nnarrowing of the eyes that had not been apparent before; but, except for\r\nthat, there was no change in his manner or appearance.\r\n\r\nFor a moment neither of the men spoke. Their eyes clashed and held. The\r\nstillness became tense, electric, as they contemplated each other through\r\nthe haze of smoke that curled from the ends of their cigarettes. Finally:\r\n\r\n“You are quite mad, I think,” remarked Deweese, unmoved. “Where the deuce\r\ndid you ever get the idea that I was Dalfonzo?”\r\n\r\nPeret was unable to conceal his admiration.\r\n\r\n“You are a great actor, _Monsieur_, and a brave man,” he declared in a\r\ntone that left no doubt of his sincerity. “I told part of my story to\r\ntest you—a sort of indirect third degree—but so far not a muscle of your\r\nface has moved. What a pity it is you are such a damned scoundrel!”\r\n\r\nDeweese laughed shortly.\r\n\r\n“It is always safe to insult a man when you have him covered,” he\r\nobserved composedly. “Nevertheless, pray continue. You interest me\r\nexceedingly, and cause me no annoyance. Your wild theories brand you a\r\nfool and an ass, and, strangely enough, it always gives me pleasure to\r\nhear an ass bray. Proceed, my dear chap.”\r\n\r\n“There are many others whose opinion of me is similar to your own,” said\r\nPeret blandly; “but the fool is he who holds his enemy in contempt.”\r\n\r\nDeweese’s eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n“Well, dear enemy, what makes you think that I am the chap you call\r\nDalfonzo?” he questioned, smiling with his lips.\r\n\r\n“You will not admit your identity, then?” countered the detective.\r\n\r\n“Certainly I will admit my identity,” said Deweese, with a laugh. “I\r\nam Albert Deweese, very much at your service. What reason have you for\r\nbelieving me to be the man you call Dalfonzo—a man who, if one is to\r\nbelieve you, seems to be in league with an invisible demon that commits\r\nmurders for him? The very fact that I almost met my death at the hands of\r\nthe Whispering Thing is proof that I am not the man you seek. If I had\r\nanything to do with the Thing, does it seem reasonable to suppose that I\r\nwould turn it loose on myself?”\r\n\r\n“The attack on you was an accident, _Monsieur_—a bit of retributive\r\njustice, perhaps. Were it not for the fact that you still suffer from\r\nthe effects of it, I would say that you only got part of what was coming\r\nto you. Not a full dose of your own medicine, _Monsieur_—just a taste of\r\nit. Ah, you are clever, my friend, clever as the fiends in hell; but, it\r\nappears, not clever enough, _Diable, Monsieur_, you should have better\r\ntrained that terrible monster before you turned it loose, eh?”\r\n\r\n“You seem to like to talk in riddles,” snapped Deweese. “What is the\r\nWhispering Thing, anyway? If you know, I shall be obliged if you will\r\ntell me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, my friend,” acquiesced Peret. “I will do so with\r\npleasure. The invisible monster, the terrible, whispering, breathing,\r\nfear-inspiring demon is—”\r\n\r\n“_Well?_” demanded Deweese tersely.\r\n\r\n“One little bat,” concluded Peret—“or rather, two little bats.”\r\n\r\nAbsurd as the detective’s statement may have sounded, its effect on the\r\nartist was, nevertheless, pronounced. His gaze wavered and his face, if\r\nsuch a thing were possible, became a shade paler. His recovery, however,\r\nwas almost immediate.\r\n\r\n“I do not know what it was that attacked you last night,” he sneered. “It\r\nmay have been and probably was a bat. It is possible that an insect could\r\nstrike terror in the heart of a delicate little flower like you. But if\r\nyou think a bat attacked _me_—” with one of his chilling laughs—“I can\r\nonly say that I think you are a poor damned fool.”\r\n\r\n“There are times that I think the same thing,” replied Peret, seriously;\r\n“but this is not one of them. I not only think that the Thing was a\r\nbat—I _know_ it. And to prove to you how futile it is for you to pretend\r\nignorance of the Thing, and of your own identity, let me reenact in words\r\nthe tragedy that ended in the death of two good and innocent men.”\r\n\r\n“Do so,” gritted Deweese, his cold blue eyes glittering. “But if you\r\nthink you can convince me that the Thing that attacked me was a bat—”\r\n\r\n“As I have already stated,” said Peret, fixing his gaze on the unwavering\r\neyes of the artist, “the murder of M. Berjet was conceived after you\r\nlearned that Adolphe had been killed. You deemed it necessary to your own\r\nsafety. Having completed your diabolical plans, therefore, you lost no\r\ntime in calling at the scientist’s home. Upon reaching your destination,\r\nyou entered the house by way of the front door, which you found unlocked.\r\nThe door of the library or sitting-room, on the other hand, was secured.\r\n\r\n“You therefore placed a chair in front of the door to stand on and opened\r\nthe transom over the door. After tying a handkerchief over your mouth and\r\nnostrils, you raised the cover of a little box you had brought with you\r\nand released a bat in the room. Then you closed the transom and departed\r\nfrom the house as silently as you had entered it.\r\n\r\n“The bat proved to be a faithful ally, _Monsieur_. On little rubber pads\r\nthat you had glued on the upper side of its wings was a preparation\r\nused by the Dyaks to poison the tips of their arrows and spears.\r\nThe preparation, which you used in powdered form, with a few added\r\ningredients of your own, as employed by the Dyaks, consists of a paste\r\nmade from the milky sap of the upas tree, dissolved in a juice extracted\r\nfrom the tuba root. With one possible exception, it is the most deadly\r\npoison known, a minute quantity, breathed in through the nostrils or\r\nabsorbed into the system through an abrasion on the skin, causing almost\r\ninstant death.\r\n\r\n“When you released the bat in the library, it began to circle around the\r\nroom and its fluttering wings scattered the powder and poisoned the air\r\nto such an extent that poor Berjet had only time, before he died, to\r\nrealize the significance of the bat’s presence in the room and to leap\r\nthrough the window in a vain effort to save himself.\r\n\r\n“You, in the meantime, had walked slowly down the street, and when the\r\nscientist catapulted himself through the window-sash, you were calmly\r\nlighting a cigarette under the corner lamp post half a block away. The\r\ncomplication was one you doubtless had not anticipated; you had thought\r\nthat Berjet would die an instant death when he got a whiff of the powder.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, you had nothing to fear, you thought; you had laid your\r\nplans too carefully. Like any innocent pedestrian would be expected to\r\ndo, therefore, you ran back down the street, determined to be in at the\r\nfinish, to see your work well done.\r\n\r\n“All this time the bat—whose mouth and nostrils, by the way, you had\r\nprotected with a tiny gauze mask from which the creature could eventually\r\nfree itself—was no doubt flying around and around, trying to find egress\r\nfrom the room. It was while you were standing on the pavement in front of\r\nthe house, talking with Sprague and Greenleigh, that the bat discovered\r\nthe broken window-sash and escaped into the open air.\r\n\r\n“As it winged its way aimlessly over the sidewalk, it flew close enough\r\nto Sprague to scatter some of the powder in his face, and an instant\r\nlater, continuing its flight, it passed in front of you.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Sprague inhaled a fatal amount of the powder, but you breathed in\r\nonly enough to throw you into a kind of convulsion. The struggles of\r\nboth you and the physician to get your breath and otherwise to overcome\r\nthe seizure made it appear that you were grappling with an invisible\r\nantagonist. Sprague succumbed almost instantly; but you, after a brief\r\nstruggle, recovered, and in order to throw me off the track, as you\r\nbelieved, cleverly conceived the ‘invisible monster.’\r\n\r\n“Nor did you have to draw much upon your imagination for the ‘whispering\r\nsound’ and the ‘icy breathing’ of the unholy creature of your mind.\r\nThe _whir_ of the bat’s wings as it flew past you made a sound not\r\nunlike that of a sibilant whisper, while the whiffs of air that the\r\nanimal’s wings fanned against your cheek, suggested the ‘cold and clammy\r\nbreathing’ of the mythical monster.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ well do I know whereof I speak, _Monsieur_, for I heard the\r\n‘whisper’ and felt the ‘breath’ of the Thing myself. The bat that was\r\nloosed in my room last night gave me the fright of my life. When its\r\nwings brushed against the wall it sounded like a whisper of the devil\r\nhimself, and when its wings fanned the air against my face, I thought a\r\ncorpse was breathing death into my soul. No coward am I, _monsieur_, but\r\nthe ‘whispering’ and ‘breathing’ were so terribly real—which only goes\r\nto show what suggestion will do to a vivid imagination. You had talked\r\nso earnestly and so picturesquely about the ‘whisper’ and the ‘breath’\r\nof the Thing, that when I first heard the _whir_ of the little animal’s\r\nwings in the inky-dark room—_Dame!_ It makes me shiver yet!\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, however, the bat had been in my room long enough before I\r\nentered it to shake all the deadly powder from its wings. The powder had\r\nsettled and the air was pure before I crossed the threshold of that room,\r\nelse I would have died a quick and horrible death.\r\n\r\n“The same thing is true of the bat that sprinkled death in the face\r\nof Berjet. When you and I, in company with the police, entered the\r\nscientist’s house, the bat had been gone for several minutes, and the\r\nstray particles of pulverized death had settled. You realized this, of\r\ncourse, or you would not have entered the room. If Strange and I had\r\nentered the house five minutes earlier, you would have let us enter it\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nPeret took a lavender handkerchief from the breast pocket of his coat and\r\nwiped from his brow some beads of perspiration. A slight moisture was\r\nalso noticeable on the forehead of the artist, but it was due to another\r\ncause. Although he must have known that each word of the detective’s\r\nwas a strand in the rope that was being woven around his neck, he gave\r\nno signs of emotion. Inwardly, the strain had begun to tell on him, but\r\noutwardly he was calm, confident, almost indifferent.\r\n\r\nRestoring the handkerchief to his pocket, Peret resumed: “I confess that\r\nat first the case baffled me. Through a mistake of my own, soon to be\r\nexplained, I got started on the wrong track. Your story of the Whispering\r\nThing did not impress me, although I did not at first suspect you of\r\ndeliberately trying to deceive me. I laid the Thing to your imagination\r\nand wrought-up condition. My skepticism vanished, however, when I reached\r\nmy rooms, as I have explained.\r\n\r\n“At first I scarcely knew what to believe. The asphyxiation theory of\r\nSprague and, later on, of Coroner Rane set my mind in motion, but led me\r\nnowhere, because it did not fit in with my interpretation of Berjet’s\r\nlast words. As a matter of fact, nothing else seemed to fit in with\r\nanything. Clues ran counter to each other and the facts themselves\r\nclashed.\r\n\r\n“I got my first inspiration when you declared that the breathing of the\r\nThing was cold and clammy, for this made it seem likely that poison fumes\r\nhad been fanned in your face by some mechanical device. Had it not been\r\nfor the horrible experience in my room, this is the theory upon which I\r\nshould have based my investigation.”\r\n\r\n“Then you captured the bat?” said Deweese, in a tense voice.\r\n\r\n“_Oui, Monsieur_,” nodded Peret. “I tried to shoot the tiny thing,\r\nwithout even knowing what it was; but I ask you in all seriousness, my\r\nfriend, could one hope to hit with a thirty-two bullet a _chauve-souris_\r\nthat one could not see? Not I! So I telephoned for the police and they\r\ncame and conquered it with a tear bomb!\r\n\r\n“The bat, _Monsieur_, was then turned over to the city chemists, and they\r\nanalyzed the traces of powder found adhering to the little pads on its\r\nwings. Their report gave me the name of the poison that opened the gates\r\nof eternity for Berjet and Sprague.”\r\n\r\nPeret twisted the needle-points of his slender black mustache and beamed\r\nupon his host.\r\n\r\n“But why accuse me?” asked Deweese, smiling. “I have no bats in my\r\nmenagerie—nothing, in fact, but a flea-bitten bulldog.”\r\n\r\nPeret’s face became sober.\r\n\r\n“You stand accused not by me,” he said solemnly, “but by Berjet, the\r\nfirst of your victims.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” asked Deweese sharply. For the first time, he seemed\r\nalarmed. He sat up suddenly in his chair, and as suddenly relaxed, but\r\nthe hunted look that crept into his eyes continued to show how sharply\r\nthe blow had struck home.\r\n\r\n“You start, eh? Good! My reasoning is sound. Yes, my friend; Berjet is\r\nyour accuser. Just before he died, he uttered two words. The first word\r\nwas ‘assassins;’ and the other was a word that I at first believed to be\r\n‘_dix_,’ the French word for ‘ten,’ which is pronounced _dees_. I thought\r\nBerjet meant he had been attacked by ten assassins, incredible as it\r\nseemed. That is what got me all balled up, as the saying goes.\r\n\r\n“But after I heard your name, and let it roll around in my mind for\r\nawhile, I realized my mistake. The dying man did not say _Dix_. He\r\npronounced your name, or rather, your present _alias_, ‘Deweese.’\r\n\r\n“When realization of this burst upon me, I was so gratified that I\r\ndecided to lay a little trap for you. I became very excited, you may\r\nrecall, shouted that I knew what the Whispering Thing was, that the\r\nmystery was solved! I wanted you to show your hand, my friend. But I was\r\nnot looking for you to act through a confederate, and as a result I very\r\nobligingly walked into the little trap which you, in turn, laid for me.\r\n\r\n“Who was it that put the _chauve-souris_ in my room, eh? Was it Sing Tong\r\nFat? It could not have been you, for you have been under surveillance\r\nevery minute of the time since you left the murdered scientist’s house\r\nlast night. I think you gave Sing Tong Fat instructions to destroy me\r\nover the telephone, for the police report you as having called your house\r\nfrom Greenleigh’s drug store after your departure from Berjet’s. Ah,\r\nthat devil of a Chinaman! I was watching him through the kitchen window\r\nfor a little while this morning polishing silver, and he was singing to\r\nhimself! _Pardieu!_ he has an easy conscience for a would-be murderer,\r\n_monsieur_!”\r\n\r\n“You have a very fertile imagination,” remarked Deweese, when Peret\r\npaused to blow the ashes from his cigarette. “But your fairy tale amuses\r\nme, so pray continue. In view of the fact that I was near the scene of\r\nthe crime when Berjet was murdered, it is not difficult to perceive how\r\nyou might confuse my name with the scientist’s last utterance. But how\r\nyou ever came to identify me with Dalfonzo is past my comprehension.”\r\n\r\n“That is very easily explained,” was Peret’s affable reply. “After\r\nleaving the scene of the crime last night, I had your house placed under\r\nsurveillance of the operative I have already mentioned. While he was\r\nwaiting for me to join him, so we could search the house, he saw Sing\r\nTong Fat through one of the windows and recognized him as your familiar.\r\n\r\n“There are very few foreign agents unknown to the Secret Service, and my\r\noperative has the record of you and Sing Tong Fat at his finger-tips. He\r\nknows that you and the Chinaman have been associated for years, and that\r\nat the present time you are working in the interests of Soviet Russia.\r\nSing Tong Fat is not the idiot he appears to be; he is an international\r\nagent that several countries would give a good deal to lay their hands on.\r\n\r\n“When my operative saw Sing Tong Fat in your house, he did not have to\r\ntax his mind much to deduce the name of the ‘master’ he is serving.\r\nBefore I joined the operative, some one called Sing Tong Fat on the\r\n’phone and he left the house almost immediately afterward. As the time\r\nof the call coincides with the hour you are reported as having ’phoned\r\nfrom Greenleigh’s drug store, I have no doubt that the message was from\r\nyou. As the operative had instructions to wait for me, he did not shadow\r\nSing Tong Fat when he left the house, which is a pity, for he probably\r\nwould have caught the old scoundrel in the act of putting the bat in my\r\nroom. After I arrived on the scene, we amused ourselves by searching your\r\nhouse—this house—thoroughly.”\r\n\r\n“So it was you prowling around here last night, was it?” said Deweese\r\nsavagely. “I wish I had known it; you should not have gotten away so\r\neasily.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am glad you did not know,” laughed Peret. “Your bulldog and your\r\nbullet made it lively enough as it was.”\r\n\r\n“I hope that you found your search worth while,” sneered Deweese.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Peret regretfully; “my search gave you a clean bill\r\nof health. We did not find the formula or anything else that would\r\nincriminate you. Nevertheless, _Monsieur_, your little game has been\r\nplayed—played and lost.\r\n\r\n“And you played the game badly, too, my friend. For a man of your\r\nintelligence, your blunders are inexcusable. Why did you not leave that\r\nblood-thirsty old Chinaman in Russia, _Monsieur_? You can never hope to\r\nremain incognito as long as you have Sing Tong Fat in tow. His hatchet\r\nface is too well known. Your other blunders were all just as glaring\r\nas this one. Why did you linger near the scene of your crime, eh? And\r\nintroduced yourself to the human bloodhounds that were searching out your\r\nscent! Ah, _Monsieur_, I admire your self confidence, but you have an\r\nover abundance of it.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Deweese, with an ironic smile. “At any rate, it doesn’t\r\ndesert me now. For I know that you cannot convict me. You haven’t a shred\r\nof real evidence against me, and the chain of circumstantial evidence you\r\nhave woven around me would be laughed to scorn in a jury room.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” assented Peret, almost apologetically. “So far I have\r\nonly been able to reconstruct the crime in my mind by piecing together\r\ninconsequential nothings that do not constitute legal evidence. Surmises,\r\ndeductions, and a stray fact or two—I possess nothing more, my friend.\r\nBut for the present they must suffice. Before I am through, however, I\r\npromise to tie you up in a knot of incontestable evidence.”\r\n\r\n“That you will never be able to do,” declared Deweese, “for I am innocent\r\nof the murders of Berjet and Sprague. I deny any knowledge of the crimes,\r\nin fact, except what I saw in your presence last night. However, ever\r\nsince you have been here, I have noticed your hand toying with the\r\nrevolver in your pocket, so I presume that I am under arrest, what?”\r\n\r\n“What the devil do I want to arrest you for?” asked Peret, with feigned\r\nastonishment. “You yourself have said that I have no real evidence\r\nagainst you.”\r\n\r\nThe lids of Deweese’s eyes narrowed and the lines around his mouth grew\r\nhard. The pupils of his eyes, contracted to half their usual size, looked\r\nlike points of cold fire.\r\n\r\n“If you are not here to arrest me, what’s your game?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I just wanted to see what effect my theories would have on you,”\r\nreplied Peret calmly, as he rose to his feet. “I am a close student of\r\npsychology, and I find much in you that interests me. Thanks for your\r\nhospitality, _Monsieur_,” he continued, opening the door. “Perhaps I\r\nshall have an opportunity to return the courtesy some day, as I have no\r\ndoubt we shall meet again.”\r\n\r\n“Rest assured of that,” rejoined Deweese, with a sinister smile. “We\r\nshall certainly meet again.”\r\n\r\n“It is written,” returned Peret.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Deweese for a moment, and then, with a bow, withdrew from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IX._\r\n\r\nTHE WORM TURNS\r\n\r\nWhen the door had closed behind the detective, Deweese walked across the\r\nroom and put his ear to the keyhole.\r\n\r\nHe heard the shrill chatter of Sing Tong Fat as he let Peret out of the\r\nhouse, and the slam of the front door when he closed it behind him.\r\nHeaving a sigh of relief, Deweese threw himself into a chair. The strain\r\nthrough which he had just come had been terrific. Ordinarily, he would\r\nhave found a battle of wits with the detective much to his liking, for it\r\nwas for just such games as this that he lived. But his experience with\r\nthe Whispering Thing had left his nerves in such a state that he felt he\r\nhad been no match for the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, now that he was at least temporarily unembarrassed by the\r\ndetective’s presence, his brain began to function more normally and\r\nhe set about evolving plans to extricate himself from his hazardous\r\nposition. What a devil the Frenchman was! The man’s powers of deduction\r\nsmacked of the supernatural. And yet—\r\n\r\nHe knitted his brow. Recalling to his mind his own blundering, it was not\r\nso difficult, after all, to perceive how the detective had arrived at\r\nhis conclusions. He, Deweese, had laid his plans so carefully, that he\r\nhad believed detection impossible. But now, viewing the working out of\r\nhis plan in retrospection, he could see where he had erred, and cursed\r\nhimself for his carelessness. His blunders, as Peret had implied, had\r\nbeen too obvious to escape notice. Should not the remarkable accuracy\r\nof Peret’s reasoning, therefore, be attributed to chance rather than to\r\ngenius? The accursed dying speech of the scientist had given him the key\r\nto the mystery, and it was certainly only an ill chance that had led\r\nhim to be on hand to hear it. With such a clue to work on, he reasoned,\r\nthe solving of the case had simply been a matter of routine. Without\r\nthis clue, the detective would have been lost. The fact that he himself\r\nhad been attacked by the Whispering Thing would have shielded him from\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nAs he thought of his chance encounter with the bat, he shuddered. The\r\naccident in itself proved his carelessness. It had indeed almost proved\r\nhis death. As Peret had said, he had been a fool to linger near the scene\r\nof his crime, but he had been so sure, so confident, that he had done his\r\nwork too well to fear detection. As for Peret—well, his very frankness\r\nproved that he was something of a fool. Who but an idiot would have\r\nexposed his hand when he knew that his opponent held the strongest cards!\r\n\r\nOf course, there was a possibility that the Frenchman was holding\r\nsomething back, but what if he was? Was he, Count Vincent di Dalfonzo,\r\n“mystery man” of a hundred _aliases_ and acknowledged by the police to be\r\nthe cleverest international crook outside of prison bars, to be deprived\r\nof his liberty and a fortune by an imbecile of a private detective?\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and his laugh did not sound pleasant. After all, he had the\r\nformula, and the game was not yet lost. His blunders had not been as bad\r\nas they might have been. He would have been arrested at once, he argued,\r\nhad Peret believed that there was even the slightest chance of convicting\r\nhim. It only remained for him to make one imperative move, and then sit\r\ntight. The Frenchman was bluffing, or perhaps he was laying another of\r\nhis diabolical traps. Well, he should see!\r\n\r\nAfter fortifying himself with a stiff drink of whisky from the flask\r\nin the table drawer, he tapped the hand-bell on the table, and Sing\r\nTong Fat, as if he had been awaiting the summons, entered the room with\r\nnoiseless tread.\r\n\r\n“Did you let that blankety-blank Frenchman out?” demanded Deweese.\r\n\r\n“_Tchèe, tchée_,” chattered Sing Tong Fat. “He gone. Me watchee him glo\r\ndlown stleet. He allee samee tam fool clazy man. He say he blowee topee\r\nhead off. _Hoi, hoi._” He drew one of the silken sleeves of his blouse\r\nacross his face and looked at his master anxiously. “He say polis alle\r\nlound house in stleet, _Fan-Fu_. He talkee allee samee Victrolee—”\r\n\r\n“The house is still under surveillance, is it?” observed Deweese,\r\nwrinkling his brow. “Well, so much the better. We work best when we work\r\ncautiously, and we are not likely to be incautious when we know we are\r\nwatched.”\r\n\r\nHe lighted a fresh cigarette and gazed reflectively at the thread of\r\nsmoke that curled upward from the lighted end. The drink of whisky had\r\ncleared his brain, and, alert, feverishly bright-eyed, every nerve\r\nin tune, he was now the man who for years had matched wits with the\r\ncontinental police and eluded them at every turn. Sing Tong Fat, well\r\naware of the seriousness of the situation, shuffled his feet uneasily and\r\nwaited, with an anxious look on his face, for his “master” to speak.\r\n\r\n“Sing Tong Fat,” said Deweese, finally, “you and I have been friends\r\nand coworkers for many years. We have associated in many dangerous\r\nenterprises and I have always been liberal when it came to a division of\r\nthe spoils. As we have shared the pleasures of our adventures, so too\r\nhave we shared their dangers. I feel it only fair to tell you, therefore,\r\nthat our peril has never been so great as it is now. Unless we act\r\nquickly we are doomed. You follow me, do you not?”\r\n\r\nSing Tong Fat touched his forehead and gravely nodded.\r\n\r\n“It seems as if Fate has been against us from the very beginning in the\r\nQ-gas business,” resumed Deweese in an unemotional tone. “The murder of\r\nBerjet, while necessary, was unfortunate, and since then we have had one\r\nstroke of bad luck after the other. We erred in trying to kill the French\r\ndetective in the manner we did. He should have been knifed, swiftly,\r\nsurely, silently. The bat that I instructed you to put in his room failed\r\nto accomplish his death and gave him a clue which, if we are not careful,\r\nmay prove to be our undoing. Most important of all, both of us have been\r\nrecognized. So you can realize how serious the situation is.”\r\n\r\n“I await thy command, O Illustrious Master,” said the Chinaman gravely,\r\nin his native tongue.\r\n\r\nDeweese, as if he took this for granted, nodded and proceeded:\r\n\r\n“Of the two of us you have the most cunning, and you therefore stand the\r\nbetter chance of eluding the police. This is not flattery; it is wisdom\r\nI have acquired through the years of my association with you. You are as\r\nelusive as a phantom when at large, and, when in the toils, as slippery\r\nas an eel. Execution of the plan I have formed, therefore, I am going to\r\nentrust to you. It is very doubtful if I could slip through the cordon of\r\npolice around the house but I think that you may be able to do so, and it\r\nis very necessary that one of us should. Here, then, is what I want you\r\nto do:\r\n\r\n“The soviet agent, No. 29, is waiting in New York for the Q-gas\r\nformula. He is stopping at the Alpin Hotel. The formula is locked in a\r\nsafe-deposit box in the Exporter’s Bank in this city. The box was rented\r\nby me under the name of John G. McGlynn. I want you to take the first\r\ntrain to New York and get No. 29 to return to Washington with you. It is\r\ntoo risky for you to try to telegraph him.\r\n\r\n“I will give you a paper authorizing him to open the box and remove the\r\nformula. The formula is to be replaced with fifty thousand dollars in\r\ngold, the second and final installment of the price No. 29 agreed to pay\r\nfor the secret.\r\n\r\n“After the exchange, which must take place in your presence, you are to\r\nrejoin me here and we will settle our score with Peret, and then take\r\nsteps to extricate ourselves from the net he has woven around us. The\r\nmost important thing now is the formula. Once we have gotten rid of that,\r\nwe can doubtless make our get-away. We have done so many times in the\r\npast under circumstances almost as trying as the present ones, and we can\r\ndoubtless do so again.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of the plan, Sing? It is filled with danger, but—if\r\nyou can think of a better one, I should be glad to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you as to the danger,” rejoined the Chinaman in a strange\r\nvoice, and then, very suddenly, he pressed the muzzle of an automatic\r\nagainst Deweese’s temple.\r\n\r\nWith his free hand he then swept the wax wrinkles from his face and\r\ngrinned. Deweese, in spite of the proximity of the automatic, recoiled.\r\nThe man was not Sing Tong Fat. He was _Jules Peret_!\r\n\r\n“Move at your peril, _Monsieur_,” warned the detective. Then, raising his\r\nvoice, “Hello, major!” he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open, and Major Dobson, accompanied by Detective Sergeant\r\nStrange and Harvey Bendlow, entered the room. Behind them came O’Shane\r\nand Frank, dragging between them Sing Tong Fat, the latter bound and\r\ngagged and minus his skull cap and outer clothing which, needless to say,\r\nnow adorned the head and body of the mirthful French detective.\r\n\r\n“Did you hear the conversation, Major?” cried Peret gleefully.\r\n\r\n“Every word of it,” declared Dobson, much gratified at the success of\r\nPeret’s stratagem. “Sergeant Strange and I were watching through a crack\r\nin the door and heard and saw all. The stenographer in the hall has it\r\nall down. The jig is up, Mr. _Alias_ Deweese,” he added, turning to\r\nthe international agent. “Your goose is cooked, and the mystery of the\r\n‘invisible monster’ is a thing of the past.”\r\n\r\n“You devil!” shouted Deweese hoarsely, glaring at the Frenchman; “you\r\nhave trapped me!”\r\n\r\n“So I have,” agreed Peret, wiping the yellow stain from his face with\r\na handkerchief. “But did I not promise you that I would do so? Ah,\r\n_Monsieur_, if you but knew what it cost me to keep my promise! Did I not\r\nhave to sacrifice my hair and beautiful mustache this morning? Still, the\r\nwig and false mustache I wore before I donned Sing Tong Fat’s regalia\r\nlooked very natural, did they not? They must have, since they deceived\r\nyou, my friend. But you should see my head without a covering! it looks\r\nlike the egg of the ostrich.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed Sing Tong Fat’s skull-cap down more firmly on his head and\r\nlaughed heartily.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_,” he continued, as he removed from his face the little pads\r\nof wax that had given his eyes an almond slant, “I almost feel tempted\r\nto make my present impersonation permanent. Sing is such a handsome and\r\ncharming man—which doubtless explains why he fought so hard to retain\r\nhis identity. When he was seized by my good friends in the vestibule,\r\nas he opened the door to let me out awhile ago, he was an astonished\r\nand infuriated man. He fought, hissed and scratched like the cat of the\r\nalley. And how he glared at them when they divested him of his clothing\r\nand helped me to make up my face to look like his own. Look at him\r\nglaring at me now!\r\n\r\n“My colleagues say I am a mimic and make-up artist of the first order,\r\nand when I think how beautifully I deceived you, _M. le Comte di\r\nDalfonzo_, I am almost persuaded that they are right.”\r\n\r\n                                 THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strange, Indeed, Are the Possibilities of the Human Mind. A Weird\r\nExample Is Found in_\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH CELL\r\n\r\n_By_ F. K. MOSS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“Man is by nature an experimenter,” argued my friend, Dr. Armand, a\r\npsychologist of some repute, “and he is steadily delving into the Unknown\r\nand bringing to light knowledge that is often appalling in its intricacy\r\nof concept.\r\n\r\n“He gathers about him a few relatively simple pieces of apparatus and\r\ndiscovers the existence of particles infinitely smaller than the most\r\nminute object visible under the ultra-microscope. He measures its size,\r\nmass, electrical charge, and in truth finds out more about it than he\r\nknows of visible objects. All of this he learns about matter that he can\r\nnever even hope to see with his naked eye. The simple but marvelous\r\ninstrument, the spectroscope, tells him of the composition of the\r\nstars. It told him that upon the sun there is an element unknown upon\r\nthis earth; he called it helium, and later discovered and isolated the\r\ngas after first finding it on a body millions of miles away. Beautiful\r\nindeed, is modern science!”\r\n\r\nArmand paused for a moment as if more fully to comprehend the scope of\r\nthe subject, and then continued:\r\n\r\n“But the most refined and sensitive piece of apparatus, if I may call it\r\nthat, and about which so little is understood, is the human brain. A vast\r\namount of research has been done along the lines of psychology by many\r\nable men and the data has been formulated into several well established\r\nhypotheses, and yet”—he stretched out his arms in a vague sort of\r\ngesture—“how little we really know about the brain!”\r\n\r\nWe had met, as had been our custom, at Armand’s apartment to enjoy\r\nan afternoon together and to discuss old times and friends. I must\r\nconfess, with all due respect to the Doctor, that the subject was often\r\nsoon changed into a scientific lecture by him on his favorite theme,\r\npsychology. I really enjoyed these informal talks immensely, for there is\r\nno more entertaining speaker than the scholarly Armand.\r\n\r\nI nodded. “Yes, I suppose so, but it seems a natural consequence—the\r\nbrain. How can the brain be studied and mathematically analyzed\r\nlike—well, mechanics, for example?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that is not such an impossibility as it would seem,” said\r\nArmand. “In the past the whole proposition has been studied conceiving of\r\nthe brain as a matter quite as abstract as the ‘soul.’ The more recent\r\nschool of investigation has attacked the problem, bearing in mind that,\r\nafter all, the functioning of the brain might be governed by the same\r\nlaws of physics that can be universally applied elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“The application of the electron theory is not absurd in the least.\r\nHowever, all research must be based upon the axiom, ‘If an occurrence can\r\nbe made to take place under certain conditions, then the repetition of\r\nthose conditions should invariably produce the same occurrence.’ As yet\r\nthis fact has not been established firmly in the case of the brain.\r\n\r\n“I have,” he continued, “just finished obtaining the data on the most\r\nabsorbing case I have ever had the opportunity to study. The data was\r\navailable only in fragments obtained from various sources, and in many\r\nplaces I have been forced to bridge the gaps by drawing purely from my\r\nconception, or imagination, of what took place.”\r\n\r\nI was deeply interested in Dr. Armand’s work, particularly in a case\r\nwhich he deemed so extraordinary, and I urged him to relate the thing in\r\nsome detail.\r\n\r\n“The first part of the amazing affair is of common knowledge and varies\r\nlittle from many other cases on record. However, the weirdest and most\r\nintensely absorbing episode began after the rest of the world conceded\r\nthe whole unfortunate affair closed forever. Perhaps it would have been\r\nclosed had the principal actor been but slightly different in mentality,\r\nor even in a different mood at the crucial hour. Potentially, there\r\nmight be many possibilities of such an occurrence, but the probability\r\nof the combination of the required circumstances at the critical hour,\r\nis infinitesimal. Even the exact repetition of the conditions might not\r\nnecessarily produce the same results.”\r\n\r\nDr. Armand then related the story as he conceived it, prefacing his\r\nremarks with the statement:\r\n\r\n“If the reactions of what we term the abnormal mind could only be\r\nchronicled, we would stand aghast at what would be written.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. ARMAND’S STRANGE NARRATIVE\r\n\r\nThe friendship of James McKay and William Larson was a source of wonder\r\nand pleasure to their mutual friends and acquaintances. Such was the\r\nclose companionship of the two men that they were often laughingly\r\nreferred to as “David and Jonathan.”\r\n\r\nEach regarded the other with pride, respect, and understanding. Possibly\r\nthere could not have been found a more glorious example of the love of\r\none man for another than this one. Certainly few, if any, would have been\r\nso mentally constituted as to produce reactions which would lead to such\r\nterrible results.\r\n\r\nMcKay had met Larson some six years previous through his newspaper work,\r\nboth being on the staff of a Denver newspaper. Strangely, in view of\r\ntheir later friendship, neither was particularly attracted to the other\r\nuntil some time later.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion McKay had been asked to “sit in” a card game at Larson’s\r\napartment, which he willingly did, for games of chance were attractive to\r\nMcKay. The party lasted nearly the entire night, and upon breaking up,\r\nLarson offered to share his room with McKay, as the latter lived at some\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nWhat drew the two men together is impossible to say, but their friendship\r\nmust have ripened quickly, for the next evening found McKay established\r\npermanently as a roommate of Larson.\r\n\r\nIn appearance, if their expressions were analyzed, the two men were\r\nstrikingly alike; enough so to be readily taken for brothers. Both were\r\nof a slender athletic build, dark complexioned, and with sharp, clean-cut\r\nfeatures—sportsmen, in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\nIn character, however, there was much difference. McKay, the younger, was\r\nan impulsive, quick-acting and confident sort of fellow, easily offended,\r\nbut correspondingly quick to accept an apology. While clever in many\r\nrespects, he was not given to concentrated and painstaking study.\r\n\r\nThis trait was evident from his writing—original, snappy, entertaining,\r\nbut often lacking in fine details of accuracy. Larson, on the other hand,\r\nwas of a more conservative type, slower but more positive in his actions,\r\nand of a nature that inquired into things in a thorough and precise\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nSuch was the well-known friendship of the two that great was the surprise\r\nof all who knew McKay when, his face black with anger, he entered the\r\nbarroom of the Palace Hotel and demanded:\r\n\r\n“Where’s that damned Larson?”\r\n\r\nFriends at once tried to ascertain the trouble, and also to urge him to\r\nreturn to his home, as he had evidently been drinking heavily. But McKay\r\nwas in no mood to be pacified by his friends.\r\n\r\n“Don’t interfere in my affairs!” he snarled.\r\n\r\nThen he ordered a drink, swallowed it at a gulp, and then seated himself\r\nin a far corner of the room.\r\n\r\nMcFadden, a close friend of both Larson and McKay, went over to him and,\r\nlinking his arm in McKay’s in a hearty and jovial manner, attempted\r\nto take him away. McKay turned on him so savagely that he gave it up,\r\nresolving to find Larson and learn the reason for McKay’s anger.\r\n\r\nAs McKay only sat and watched and waited, his eyes blazed with a deadly\r\ngleam.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMcKay had become, as Larson expressed it, hypnotized by and infatuated\r\nwith a really beautiful but altogether shallow and irresponsible sort of\r\nwoman. The affair had caused Larson a great deal of annoyance, as McKay\r\nwould, at times, become extraordinarily cheerful and then sink into\r\nspells of despondency so sullen and irritable that even the quiet-natured\r\nLarson found it impossible to live with him.\r\n\r\nThese moods, as Larson well knew, were occasioned by Miss Conway’s\r\ntreatment of Jim. Her influence over McKay seemed as unlimited as it was\r\nmagical. Larson had tried to reason with Jim, and had tried to convince\r\nhim that Miss Conway did not care seriously for him or any one else\r\nexcept herself. But all his efforts produced no other effect than to\r\nkindle new passion in McKay.\r\n\r\nOn the evening mentioned, McKay had asked permission to call at her home,\r\nbut was refused, she pleading a previous engagement. For some unknown\r\nreason (the guiding hand of fate, for those who believe in fate), he\r\nwalked out to her home, and as he drew near he saw Larson—his old pal,\r\nBill Larson—enter the home of Miss Conway!\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stood as if stunned. Of all persons, Bill was the last he\r\nwould have suspected.\r\n\r\nThen it all became plain to him—Bill had tried to alienate the girl’s\r\nlove!\r\n\r\nSlowly, listlessly, McKay turned and retraced his steps to his room.\r\nHe sat there a long while in the dark and let his mind become polluted\r\nwith the poison of an insane jealousy, while he saturated his system and\r\ndulled his conscience with whisky.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven he rose, placed a gun in his pocket, and started for the\r\nhotel where he and Larson often met in the evening. As he walked, his\r\nmind became closed to reason, closed to his regard for his friend, closed\r\nto everything except that Larson had double-crossed him. As he sat and\r\nwaited in the barroom his brain focused itself on this one point until it\r\nhad taken possession of him.\r\n\r\nHe had been there about a half hour when Larson appeared, laughing\r\nand chatting with some friends. Bill was in great spirits, for he had\r\naccomplished, that night, the thing he had long sought. Miss Conway had\r\nbeen very reasonable and had promised that she would cause McKay no more\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nMcFadden and a few others hastened at once toward him to tell him about\r\nMcKay. But they were too late, for Larson, espying McKay, sang out:\r\n\r\n“Hello, Jim, old scout! Come over and ‘hist’ one with us!”\r\n\r\nMcKay jumped up and strode over to the bar, his eyes glittering and his\r\nmouth twitching with hatred.\r\n\r\n“You damn——!” and he leveled an accusing finger at Larson.\r\n\r\n“Jim!” cried Larson, “what’s wrong?” Larson was greatly shocked and\r\ndistressed over the condition of his friend, and he overlooked, if he\r\nheard, the insult hurled at him.\r\n\r\n“So that was what you wanted?” McKay snarled.\r\n\r\n“My God, Jim, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“You may have beaten me, but you will never, never get her!” And a stream\r\nof fire leapt from McKay’s gun and Larson dropped to the floor, uttering\r\nbut one word—“Jim!”\r\n\r\nThe weapon dropped from McKay’s limp hand, and his face was ashen as he\r\ngazed, speechlessly, at the bleeding and lifeless body of his best friend\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nHe slowly turned away, and later surrendered himself to the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe tragic affair caused a great deal of comment. Some three weeks\r\nafter the murder the case was brought to trial and attracted widespread\r\ninterest. The dingy West Side courtroom was crowded to capacity. Friends,\r\nacquaintances, business men, curiosity seekers, fought for seats.\r\n\r\nConsiderable difficulty was encountered in the selection of a jury. The\r\npopularity of the murdered man, as well as the defendant, made it hard to\r\nfind an unbiased yet capable juryman.\r\n\r\nAfter that, however, the trial was brief, the end coming with almost\r\nstartling suddenness. The state’s case was plain and simple: The evidence\r\nwas overwhelmingly against McKay, and the situation was not improved by\r\nhis refusal to offer any defense.\r\n\r\nHis attorney put up the plea of temporary insanity. His arguments held\r\nweight. The plea was eloquent and logical, and probably would have been a\r\ndeciding factor had not McKay himself, at the conclusion of the address,\r\nrisen—and, to the dumbfounded court and attorney, refused to accept\r\ninsanity as a defense.\r\n\r\nThe jury was out fifty minutes and returned a verdict of “guilty in the\r\nfirst degree,” and recommended the death penalty. All eyes were turned\r\ntoward McKay, who remained perfectly emotionless.\r\n\r\nThe judge then pronounced the death sentence on James McKay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe friends of McKay were surprised at the severity of the penalty.\r\nEspecially dejected over the outcome were McFadden, a brother newspaper\r\nman; Kirk, an oil operator, and Barnard, a young Medic, for these three,\r\nwith McKay and Larson, had formed what they termed the “gang.” Now one of\r\nthe five was dead and another was sentenced to be hung.\r\n\r\nThey at once demanded a new trial, but it was refused. Scarcely could the\r\nmen refrain from emotion when McKay asked them and his attorney to settle\r\nup his worldly affairs. As he was without a family, he willed all his\r\nproperty to his three friends, and even mentioned in some detail a few\r\npersonal effects he wanted each to have.\r\n\r\nOf all present, McKay was the least affected by the scene. His voice and\r\nmovements were those of an automaton rather than that of a human being.\r\nIndeed, he was practically such and had been so since the death of Larson.\r\n\r\nAfter attending to the last detail of his worldly affairs he rose and\r\nsilently shook the hands of his friends. Accompanied by two plain\r\nclothesmen, handcuffed wrist to wrist, he left them and started on his\r\nlast trip to Canon City. He had often visited that little Colorado city,\r\nand had spent many a pleasant time there. He requested the officers to\r\ndrive down Seventeenth Street.\r\n\r\nAt one end was the golden dome of the State Capitol, brilliantly aglow\r\nfrom the crimson rays of the setting sun; at the other was the station,\r\ndark against the purple, snow-capped Rockies.\r\n\r\nAs he neared the station he looked long and sadly at the huge arch\r\nerected at the entrance. The word _Mizpath_ was blazoned across the arch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe utmost consideration was shown McKay by the prison authorities, who\r\nwere well acquainted with the young reporter. The Warden met him at the\r\noffice and personally took him to the death cell.\r\n\r\nThe door clamped shut and the bolts shot in place with metallic\r\nharshness, and the law began to exact its penalty as it had done in the\r\nDark Ages—caging him in with stone and steel.\r\n\r\nFive days passed, long grinding days and longer nights, for sleep no\r\nlonger supplied periods of relaxation. His friends were agreeably\r\nsurprised when they visited him a few days later to find him in an\r\napparently cheerful frame of mind. He talked of Larson in the freest sort\r\nof manner. He delighted in dwelling upon the characteristics of his late\r\nfriend. More and more, as the days passed by, did he like to discuss\r\nLarson. He would relate incident after incident in the life of the latter\r\nwhich, due to the closeness of their friendship, he knew quite as well as\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nAs to his impending execution, he seemed surprisingly unconcerned. Calmly\r\nand without bitterness, McKay waited for justice to take its course.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarnard and McFadden were silently playing pinochle, while Kirk stared\r\nmoodily out the window at the cold and drizzling rain.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the men were at low ebb and they had met that Wednesday\r\nevening only through force of habit. Efforts to liven up the evening had\r\nbeen made, but with no enthusiasm, and it promised to be as dull as the\r\nweather outside.\r\n\r\n“Why not!” suddenly muttered Kirk, half to himself and half aloud.\r\n\r\nBarnard and McFadden turned around and eyed their companion curiously.\r\nKirk went over to his desk and started searching for something.\r\n\r\nReseating himself, he read and re-read the newspaper clipping he had\r\ntaken from the desk. The expression on his face was so strange that the\r\npinochle game was abandoned and his friends attempted to learn the cause\r\nof his unusual behavior.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you?” demanded McFadden, somewhat impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Read that!” and Kirk forced the clipping into McFadden’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe latter glanced at it briefly, then gave it his undivided attention\r\nand then passed it over to Barnard, who was exceedingly impatient to read\r\nit after noting its effect upon McFadden.\r\n\r\nBarnard’s expression instantly changed from one of curiosity to one of\r\ngreat seriousness. Kirk looked at McFadden in an effort to appraise the\r\neffect of the article, and read an excitement equal to his own. Together\r\nthey turned to Barnard, who read aloud:\r\n\r\n    “CHICAGO, MARCH 8: The startling disclosure was made today by\r\n    Chicago detectives that associates of ‘Red’ Murphy, gunman, who\r\n    was hanged this morning, had all but succeeded in restoring\r\n    Murphy to life! The request was made and granted for the body\r\n    immediately after being taken from the scaffold. The body was\r\n    placed in an ambulance and whirled away. Inside the ambulance,\r\n    hot blankets, pulmotor and restoratives were applied until\r\n    Murphy began to breathe again. The desperate attempt was\r\n    futile, however, as Murphy died a few minutes after being\r\n    revived.”\r\n\r\nFor at least fifteen minutes after Barnard finished not a word was\r\nspoken. Finally Kirk turned to Barnard.\r\n\r\n“You are a doctor. What about it?”\r\n\r\nBarnard deliberated. “Yes, it might be done if the neck was not broken by\r\nthe drop. If such was the case, death would be produced by strangulation.”\r\n\r\nGone was the boredom of the evening, and in its place was created a\r\nplan that was to write additional chapters beyond the “Finis” placed on\r\nthe case of James McKay by the state. Throughout the entire night they\r\ndiscussed the plan—accepting and rejecting it time and time again.\r\n\r\nThere were many phases to be considered. The probability that McKay would\r\nbe hanged without having his neck broken finally became the crux of the\r\nargument. Kirk suggested a plan. McFadden, as a newspaper man, would have\r\naccess to the death chamber; the rope could be shortened and the knot\r\nfixing it to the scaffold could be arranged so that it would slip a bit,\r\nthereby easing the shock of the drop.\r\n\r\nMcFadden immediately protested, and refused to consider such a move. It\r\nwould be torture for McKay. Barnard said:\r\n\r\n“I could give McKay a ‘shot’ that would dull any pain produced.”\r\n\r\n“Jim would not stand for a hypo.”\r\n\r\n“He would not notice it, in the excitement and confusion of being bound.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the discussion of the proposed plan, the possibility of legal\r\nconsequences for themselves was not considered. They were playing for\r\nthe life of a friend and the ethics of the methods were of secondary\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nBy morning they had formulated and agreed upon a definite plan\r\nof procedure, and before separating they spent a few moments in\r\nanticipating the joy of the reunion, if they were successful. Although\r\nMcKay had taken the life of an equally close friend, so well did they\r\nunderstand the conditions that they extended their sympathy rather than\r\ncensure.\r\n\r\nDay by day the details of the plan were carried out. Each was assigned\r\na definite part of the work to be done. McFadden spent all the time\r\nhe dared spend at the penitentiary. He familiarized himself with the\r\nequipment of capital punishment. He studied the tying of knots; he\r\nexperimented and found the best possible way to adjust a rope so that the\r\nshock of the drop would be taken up as smoothly as possible.\r\n\r\nNor could a more zealous medical student be found than Barnard. He sought\r\nout every possible reference on the subject, prepared emergency equipment\r\nto the last detail.\r\n\r\nThe day before the execution, McFadden and Barnard left for Canon City,\r\nKirk remaining in Denver. That night Kirk got out McKay’s suitcase and\r\nstarted packing it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMcKay was the center of the solemn little group that, with precise\r\nmovement, passed down the steel corridors. They entered the death\r\nchamber, and it was McKay who sought to cheer his friends.\r\n\r\nHe stepped upon the trap, and the officials bound his wrists to his\r\nthighs with wide leather straps. He laughed and joked with his friends,\r\nwho could not force a laugh from their dry set lips. Then, while the\r\nhangman stood waiting with the black hood, the chaplain offered up a few\r\nwords in prayer.\r\n\r\nMcFadden stepped up and bade his friend farewell. Barnard then came up\r\nand in a strained manner clapped McKay on the shoulder and said, “So\r\nlong, old scout,” and then stepped down, quickly concealing a small\r\nhypodermic syringe in his pocket.\r\n\r\nBarnard and McFadden left the room and waited just outside, where they\r\nexchanged significant glances. Each knew the other had not failed in\r\nhis task. A few seconds later they heard the trap drop, and for eleven\r\nexcruciating minutes—an eternity—they waited.\r\n\r\nThe prison physician pronounced McKay dead and they returned. The body\r\nwas cut down quickly, then turned over to Barnard and placed in a waiting\r\nambulance, and whirled away.\r\n\r\nOnce again the experiment was being tried.\r\n\r\nThe long chance won. After a desperate effort Barnard’s work was\r\nrewarded by a slight and uncertain breathing by McKay.\r\n\r\nMcFadden noticed this, and scarcely could refrain from shouting with joy.\r\nBarnard, however, quickly assured him that the results as yet were far\r\nfrom certain.\r\n\r\nThe body reached the mortuary and, by well-laid plans and judicious\r\nselection of undertakers, was placed on a bed rather than the marble slab\r\nof the embalmer. Barnard watched his “patient” with close attention,\r\nwhile McFadden hastened to telegraph Kirk, who was waiting in Denver.\r\n\r\nThe three friends were gathered about McKay when the latter regained\r\nconsciousness after hours of quiet and restful sleep. McKay opened his\r\neyes—shut them—then, with eyes wide open, hand on his forehead, he gazed\r\nin a glassy manner about the room. His whole body quivered for a few\r\nseconds, then relaxed, and then he spoke in a hoarse and mechanical tone.\r\n\r\n“What—” His eyes wandered about and his words became inarticulate.\r\nFinally:\r\n\r\n“What—what has happened?”\r\n\r\n“Steady, old man,” said Barnard. “Everything is O. K. You came out fine.”\r\n\r\nAgain McKay stared. “Came out? Came out of what?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you realize—”\r\n\r\nBarnard interrupted Kirk, and with a look warned McFadden to remain quiet.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, old boy. Rest up a bit, and then we’ll explain.”\r\n\r\nMcKay was not satisfied. He asked: “Where is Jim—Jim McKay?”\r\n\r\n“_What!_”\r\n\r\nThe three friends riveted their eyes on McKay, and slowly, first with\r\nBarnard, an expression of horror spread over their faces as they\r\nunderstood what had happened. The shock of being launched into eternity,\r\nonly to be snatched back by his friends, had, as the law demanded,\r\nblotted out the life of McKay—_and they had brought back William Larson!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArmand finished, and I turned over in my mind many questions that wanted\r\nanswering.\r\n\r\n“Is there any explanation of the transition of the personality, or soul\r\nof McKay, to that of Larson?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Armand. “The brain is composed of two hemispheres, one\r\nof which receives impressions and is the seat of thinking. The other\r\nhemisphere remains thoughtless. Undoubtedly, after the normal section\r\nbecame somewhat paralyzed by the melancholia of those terrible nights\r\nalone in the death cell the thoughtless section must have received\r\nimpressions. You will remember that, following his melancholia, McKay\r\ndesired above all to talk of Larson, and in dwelling on this the usually\r\ninactive hemisphere probably received its impressions.”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe that he will always remain as Larson?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It is my belief that he will. He says that he is Larson, and he acts the\r\nlife of Larson. Impossible as it may sound, I believe that exactly six\r\nyears from the day of his execution, McKay, as Larson, will die—a victim\r\nof auto-suggestion and the vividness of his imagination.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ghastly Retribution Befell the Victim of_\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL PLANT\r\n\r\n_By_ LYLE WILSON HOLDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the last straw! Injury upon injury I had borne without a murmur,\r\nbut now I determined to revenge myself upon Silvela Castelar, let the\r\ncost be what it would. His malevolent influence had pursued me since\r\nearly boyhood, and it was he who caused every fond hope of my life to\r\nturn to ashes before its realization.\r\n\r\nLong ago, when we were boys in school together, his evil work began.\r\nWe were both of Spanish blood, and both, having lost our parents in\r\nchildhood, were being educated by our respective guardians at one of the\r\nfamous boys’ schools of England.\r\n\r\nNothing was more natural in the circumstances, than that we should become\r\nchums and room-mates. However, it was not long before I began to be\r\nsorry that I had entered into such close relationship with him. He was\r\nabsolutely unscrupulous, and soon his escapades won him an unenviable\r\nreputation among the other students, although he always managed, by\r\nskillfully covering his trail, to stand well with the authorities of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nBefore many weeks had passed, a particularly heinous outrage, which\r\nhe had committed, set the whole school in an uproar. It could not be\r\noverlooked, and a strict investigation was started.\r\n\r\nWhat was my horror to discover that his devilish ingenuity had woven a\r\nweb of evidence which thoroughly enmeshed me within its coils! There was\r\nno escape; I was dismissed in disgrace from the school, and in disgrace\r\nI left England. The notoriety I received in many of the leading papers\r\nof the Kingdom made it impossible for me to enter another school or to\r\nobtain any honest employment.\r\n\r\nI came to America, working my passage over upon a cattle ship. The years\r\nthat followed were hard ones, but by sober industry I forged slowly ahead\r\nuntil, at last, I had bright prospects of becoming the junior partner in\r\na large business house in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThen my evil genius appeared. Silvela obtained employment in our company,\r\nand by his devilish cunning soon made himself well liked and trusted.\r\n\r\nThen one morning, a few months after he came, it was reported that a\r\nlarge amount of money had been stolen from the firm. Again a network of\r\ncircumstantial evidence pointed indisputably in my direction.\r\n\r\nI was arrested and brought to trial. The evidence not being entirely\r\nconclusive, the jury disagreed, and I was set free; but my career in\r\nAmerica was forever blasted.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could close up my affairs, I buried myself in the wilds\r\nof Australia, where I began life anew. Fortune was kind to me and I\r\nprospered. Under another name, I became a respected and honored citizen\r\nof a thriving new settlement.\r\n\r\nThen the crowning blessing of all came when I won the love of the\r\nbeautiful Mercedes, a black-eyed, olive-hued immigrant from my old\r\nprovince of Andalusia. Then, indeed, I was at the threshold of Heaven!\r\nBut how short was my day of bliss!\r\n\r\nFour weeks before our wedding day Silvela Castelar suddenly entered our\r\nsettlement. It is useless to dwell upon that wretched period. Sufficient\r\nto say that this hellborn fiend again worked his diabolic sorcery, and\r\nMercedes was lost to me forever.\r\n\r\nThe report came to me that Silvela, for the first time in his life,\r\nloved with a fierce, consuming passion, and that Mercedes soon would be\r\nbetrothed to him. Then it was that I vowed by all that was holy that\r\nSilvela Castelar should pay in full his guilty debt, even though, as a\r\nresult, my soul should sink into stygian blackness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy do I write this? Because I take a grim pleasure in telling of\r\nmy revenge, and because I want the world to know that I had just\r\nprovocation. I am not afraid. Life or death—it matters little which is my\r\nportion now. When this is read I shall be far from the haunts of men.\r\n\r\nSilvela Castelar thought I was a fool. It suited my purpose that he\r\nshould continue to think so. I treated him as a bosom friend, and he,\r\npoor idiot, thought I never guessed that he was the instigator of the\r\nruin which drove me from England, wrecked my business career in America,\r\nand in the end left me desolate, without hope of ever enjoying the\r\nblessings of love.\r\n\r\nSo, while we smoked, read, or hunted together, I brooded upon my wrongs,\r\nand racked by brain for some method by which I could accomplish that\r\nwhich was now the sole absorbing motive of my life. Then chance threw\r\nacross my path the instrument of my vengeance.\r\n\r\nOne day, while I was wandering, desolate and alone, through a wild and\r\nunexplored part of the country, I came upon one of the rarest and at the\r\nsame time one of the most terrible species of the vegetable kingdom ever\r\ndiscovered. It is known as the octopus plant, called by the natives “the\r\ndevil tree.” When I saw it my heart gave a throb of exultation, for I\r\nknew that my search was ended; the means by which I could accomplish my\r\npurpose was now at hand.\r\n\r\nSilvela and I had but one passion in common—an intense love for botanical\r\ninvestigation. I knew that he would be interested when he heard of my\r\nstrange discovery, and I believed that his knowledge of the plant was not\r\nsufficient to make him cautious. On the evening of the next day but one,\r\nas we sat smoking, I broached the subject.\r\n\r\n“Silvela, in the old days you used to be considerably wrapped up in the\r\nstudy of plant life. Are you still interested?”\r\n\r\n“Somewhat,” he replied, and then his eyes narrowed craftily. “I exhausted\r\nthe interesting possibilities of most of the known plants of the world a\r\nnumber of years ago. Lately I have found ‘the light that lies in women’s\r\neyes’ a subject of greater interest.”\r\n\r\nI could have strangled him where he sat; but a lifetime of trouble has\r\ntaught me to conceal my feelings. I betrayed no emotion.\r\n\r\n“I’ll venture that there is one plant which you have never studied at\r\nfirst hand.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” he asked, with mild curiosity.\r\n\r\n“A plant,” I continued, “found only in the most inaccessible places\r\nof the earth. Probably it could be seen only in the wildest parts of\r\nSumatra or Australia, and then scarcely once in a lifetime.”\r\n\r\nHe was now thoroughly aroused.\r\n\r\n“What is the family of this wonderful shrub?” he asked. “I have a dim\r\nrecollection of having heard of it. Let me see—isn’t it called—”\r\n\r\n“The devil tree by the natives, by others the octopus plant,” I broke in.\r\n“But I have heard that the name is somewhat of a misnomer. It is said\r\nthat it is rather a tree of heaven, for it distills a rare and delicious\r\nnectar which has a wonderful rejuvenating power. At the same time it\r\nintoxicates in a strange and mysterious manner, causing him who drinks\r\nto revel in celestial visions of love and radiant beauty. Instead of\r\nleaving one depressed, as is the case with alcohol, it is said that the\r\nimpression lingers, the face grows younger, and he who sips is actually\r\nloved by any of the female sex whose eyes look upon him. Indeed, I have\r\nheard that if our countryman, Ponce de Leon, had gone to the South Seas\r\ninstead of to Florida, he would have really discovered the fountain of\r\nyouth for which he sought.”\r\n\r\nI looked at Silvela. His eyes were sparkling, and he was breathing\r\nquickly; I knew I had found his weak point. His was a dreamy,\r\nhalf-superstitious nature, and my words appealed to him strongly.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed. “Would that I could see this marvelous phenomenon and\r\nsip of its celestial juice!”\r\n\r\n“It could be done,” I replied, hesitatingly, “but it would involve some\r\nhardship and considerable danger.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever see one of these plants?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; not two days since.”\r\n\r\nSilvela sprang to his feet, with a Spanish oath.\r\n\r\n“_Dios mio!_” he cried. “Rodriguez, why did you not tell me? When can we\r\nstart to find it?”\r\n\r\n“Softly,” I admonished. “I told you there was danger. Haven’t you heard\r\nthat this devil’s plant has been known to gorge itself upon human flesh?”\r\n\r\n“The wild story of some frightened native,” he scoffed. “Take me to\r\nit and nothing shall prevent me from testing the fabled powers of its\r\njuices. Stop! Did you not drink of this delicious nectar?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head sadly.\r\n\r\n“No, I had no wish to try. Why should I seek to become young in body when\r\nmy heart is old within?”\r\n\r\n“You were afraid,” he sneered, “afraid of the trailing tendrils of this\r\nplant devil.”\r\n\r\n“Have it that way if you wish,” I answered indifferently. “However, if\r\nin spite of my warning, you still persist in wishing to see this strange\r\nfreak of nature, I will do my best to guide you to it; but, I repeat, the\r\nway is long and difficult, and you had better leave this cursed thing\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“We will start in the morning,” he asserted decisively, as he arose to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nI said nothing more, but, alone in my room, I laughed like a devil at the\r\nsuccess of my ruse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning the weather was squally and tempestuous, and I was afraid\r\nthat the fire of Silvela’s enthusiasm would be burning low. But I also\r\nknew that opposition would be fuel to the flame.\r\n\r\n“I fear we shall have to postpone our journey,” I remarked, when he\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nIf Silvela had any doubts as to the advisability of our starting out that\r\nmorning, they vanished at once.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” he rasped. “It is fine weather for our purpose.”\r\n\r\n“All right, my friend,” I replied. “Remember, though, that I advised\r\nagainst going.”\r\n\r\n“The consequences be upon my head,” he rejoined. “Come, let us be on our\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nOur path was strewn with difficulties, and we progressed but slowly. At\r\ntimes the wind howled and whistled across the wild spaces with a sound\r\nso mournful that it sent a shudder through me. The heavens were murky,\r\nand low, dark clouds raced across the leaden sky as though fleeing from\r\nsome scene of horror. Great rocks impeded our progress at every step, and\r\ntheir grotesque forms seemed to leer at us evilly as we passed. At length\r\nSilvela paused and mopped his brow.\r\n\r\n“Come,” I exclaimed, “you are tired and exhausted. The day is declining.\r\nLet us go back.”\r\n\r\nSilvela hesitated, and there was an instant in which I was afraid\r\nhe would take me at my word. Then he straightened, and his chin set\r\ndeterminedly.\r\n\r\n“No. We have come far; we will continue to the end. Lead the way.”\r\n\r\n“So let it be,” I returned grimly. “We will continue to the end.”\r\n\r\nI thought a tremor passed over Silvela’s sturdy form and that his face\r\npaled slightly, but he turned resolutely and followed me as I pushed\r\nforward once more.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when we approached the end of our journey.\r\nThe clouds had become less dense, and the sun, hanging low upon the\r\nhorizon, gleamed through with a sullen glare. The whole western sky bore\r\nthe appearance of curdled blood.\r\n\r\nAt length I led the way around an immense rock, stopped, and pointed to\r\nthe north. There, but a short distance ahead, stood the ghastly plant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was, in appearance, like a huge pineapple about ten or twelve feet\r\nin height. From the top sprang the broad, dark green leaves, trailing\r\ndownward to the ground and enclosing the plant in a kind of cage.\r\n\r\nInside these leaves, at the top of its bulky body, could be seen two\r\nround, fleshy plates, one above the other. Dripping constantly from\r\nthese was a golden, intoxicating nectar, the fatal lure that tempts the\r\nvictim to his fate. Surrounding these plates were long green tendrils\r\nor arms like those upon an octopus. A slight pressure upon one of these\r\ndisks would cause the serpent-like tendrils to enfold the victim in their\r\ndeadly embrace, while the sweet fluid rendered the poor wretch oblivious\r\nto danger until it was too late.\r\n\r\nSilvela stood for a moment silently looking at the strange plant at which\r\nI pointed.\r\n\r\n“It is an uncanny sight,” he muttered, and a shiver ran over his body.\r\n\r\n“Uncanny it is, indeed,” I replied. “I, for one, have no desire to make a\r\ncloser acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“You were always ready to show the white feather,” he derided scornfully.\r\n\r\nI did not openly resent this; I could bear insult for a little while\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n“Silvela,” I said, “Let us leave this dreadful plant alone. I implore you\r\nto return with me now. You have seen this horrid thing, why should you\r\ncare to test the legendary power of the fluid which it distills?”\r\n\r\n“Because I love,” he replied in a dreamy voice, “and I wish to be loved\r\nbeyond all men. If it be, indeed, the fountain of youth, what danger can\r\ndeter me from sipping its miraculous juice?”\r\n\r\n“Then I will say no more. Drink, then, of the fabled wonders of this tree\r\nof destiny, and may all the joy and all the happiness to which your life\r\nentitles you, come to you as you drink the nectar that drips in golden\r\ndrops from its heart.”\r\n\r\nSilvela darted a quick look at me from his dark eyes, as though half\r\nsuspecting a hidden meaning in my words. Then he stepped quickly toward\r\nthe ominous plant.\r\n\r\n“Careful!” I cautioned, “Do not touch the long, green tendrils. There is\r\nwhere the danger lies, for they might tear your flesh.”\r\n\r\nSilvela stood for an instant close beside the trailing arms, his\r\neyes glowing with a half insane light. His face was flushed with the\r\npassionate fire that surged through his veins. To his susceptible mind I\r\nknow that it was the crowning adventure of his life. I could tell that\r\nhis heart was pounding, from the throbbing arteries of his throat. His\r\nlips were moving, and I strained my ears to catch the sound.\r\n\r\n“For Mercedes!” he murmured, and stepped between the hanging tendrils.\r\n\r\nAnother moment’s pause, and he bent down to the fleshy plates in the\r\nheart of the plant and drank long and deeply of the golden juice.\r\nDreamily he closed his eyes, and, leaning forward, I could faintly catch\r\nsome of the broken accents that came from his lips.\r\n\r\n“Ah, love, my only love!” he murmured, “See, beloved, the angel\r\nfaces—celestial voices coming near—sweet, how sweet—the unearthly light\r\nof elysian fields—ah, the heavenly perfume—the surging of the eternal\r\nsea!”\r\n\r\nWith folded arms, I stood and waited. Lost to all else save the delights\r\nof his entrancing vision, every faculty, every sense deluded into happy\r\nquiescence by the chimerical phantasm, he did not note the tremulous\r\nvibrations which ran through the whole mass of the horrible plant.\r\n\r\nSlowly at first, and then more quickly, the long, sinewy palpi began to\r\nrise and twist in what seemed a fearful dance of death. Higher and higher\r\nrose the dreadful arms, until they hovered over the unconscious form of\r\ntheir victim.\r\n\r\nOnce I pressed a little too closely, and one of the awful, twisting\r\ntendrils came in contact with my hand. I sprang back and just in time for\r\nso deadly was the grasp of the noxious arms, that the skin was stripped\r\nfrom my flesh.\r\n\r\nSlowly, but surely, the octopuslike arms settled about Silvela’s body.\r\nOne of them dropped across his cheek. As it touched the bare flesh a\r\ntremor ran through his frame, and he suddenly opened his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was only a moment until he was fully awake to the horror of his\r\nposition. While he was reveling in dreams of paradise, the grim arms of\r\nthe death plant had enclosed him in their vise-like clasp, and I knew\r\nthat no power upon earth could make them relax until they opened to throw\r\nforth the dry husk—the dead skin and bones—of their prey. Already they\r\nhad so constricted his chest that he could breathe only in short, panting\r\ngasps. His terror-stricken eyes sought my face.\r\n\r\n“My God, Rodriguez!” he cried in a terrible voice.\r\n\r\nThe arms gripped him closer. He gasped out a word, “_Help!_”\r\n\r\n“Silvela Castelar,” I said, with quiet bitterness, “You are beyond all\r\nhuman aid. I could not help you if I would. Once within the grasp of\r\nthose awful arms, I would be as helpless as you. Remember at every step\r\nof this fatal journey I warned you, but at each warning you grew more\r\ndetermined. Three times you have brought ruin upon me; the third time\r\nyou left for me nothing in life, but I was resolved that you should not\r\nenjoy what I had lost. Silvela, tonight the debits and credits of your\r\naccount with me stand balanced. Across the page of the book of life I\r\nwrite the words, ‘_Paid in full!_’”\r\n\r\nHe heard me through. Then, as he realized that hope was gone, shriek\r\nafter terrible shriek burst from his frenzied lips. In his terror and\r\ndespair, he struggled in a madness of desperation; but every movement\r\ncaused the embrace of the ghastly arms to tighten upon his body.\r\n\r\nWith a sick heart, I turned from the awful scene and plunged forward on\r\nmy homeward path. As I passed around the great rock from where we had\r\nfirst glimpsed the fatal tree, a last heartbreaking wail reached my ears.\r\n\r\n“_Mercedes! Mercedes!_”\r\n\r\nLike the last cry of a lost soul hovering over the abyss of gehenna,\r\nit shrilled in vibrating terror through the air, echoing back from the\r\nghoulish rocks, and then died away into the silence of the approaching\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nA faintness seized me, and I shivered at the touch of the chilling breeze\r\nwhich sprang up as the sun sank, blood-red, below the horizon; and my\r\nheart was as cold as my shrinking flesh.\r\n\r\nSunshine or shadow—it is the same to me now. But in recompense for my\r\nshattered life, I shall carry with me always, the vision of Silvela’s\r\ndistorted form writhing in close embrace of the devil-tree’s snaky arms,\r\nin my ears there will ever ring the echo of his last despairing cry of,\r\n“_Mercedes!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOTCH\r\n\r\n_By_ William Sanford\r\n\r\n\r\nI had committed murder. In a terrible fit of rage I had killed my friend,\r\nJim McCarthy. I was going to be hung at sunrise. There was no hope. I\r\nmust die.\r\n\r\nSlowly the great steel door swung open, and four guards entered my cell.\r\nOne of them stepped a little in advance of the others.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he said, and that was all.\r\n\r\nI rose, tottering, from my bench. I must die! I must leave the sunlight\r\nof the earth behind me. I had committed murder.\r\n\r\nI was led through the cold, bleak prison corridors and out into the\r\nlighted courtyard where a number of people were gathered—prison officials\r\nand a few newspaper men. The scaffold stood before me, and with tottering\r\nlegs I was assisted to the top.\r\n\r\nA black cap, a horrible thing spelling death, was fitted over my head and\r\ndrawn tight about my neck. All was still about me. No one spoke.\r\n\r\nI felt the noose placed about my neck. The cold sweat broke out over my\r\nbody. I could scarcely stand. Death! _Death!_ I was to know the feeling\r\nof that terrible rope in a few moments.\r\n\r\n“Ready!” said a sharp voice.\r\n\r\nI felt the earth slip from under me, and I shot into space. A feeling of\r\nsuffocation, indescribably terrible, enveloped me, and a million sparks\r\nof fire seemed dancing before my eyes, though I could not see. I tried to\r\nscream, but could make no sound. Then something seemed to burst; my lungs\r\nwere free; I gave a terrible cry.\r\n\r\nA voice from above came sharply down to me:\r\n\r\n“What the devil’s the matter with you, Bill?”\r\n\r\nThe ship gave a lurch and brought me wide awake. In the dim light of the\r\ncabin I saw Jim McCarthy’s face peering at me from the bunk above.\r\n\r\n“Jim,” I said, wiping my sweat-soaked face with the sheet. “If you fill\r\nme up on any more of your home-made hootch I _will_ kill you!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THUNDER VOICE\r\n\r\n_The Story of a Hairy Monster_\r\n\r\n_By_ F. WALTER WILSON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my grandfather who told me of The Thunder Voice, and of the\r\nterror which it spread throughout the Valley of Trelane away back in the\r\nearly days, when scattered Indians hunted the forests thereabouts—told\r\nme of how the gruesome horror of it changed strong men into whimpering\r\nweaklings, afraid to step beyond their thresholds after dark.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was a morbid child, for it was on wild storm-ridden nights,\r\nwhen the rain splashed in sheets against the windows and the raving wind\r\nscreamed dismally about the eaves of the big house, that I would climb\r\nupon his knee and beg for “The Thunder Stories,” as I had come to call\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFull well I knew that I would later creep up the dark stairs with quaking\r\nknees, and with my heart pounding against my ribs—knew too, that I would\r\nlie awake, with the blankets drawn tightly over my head, and listen, yet\r\ndread to hear—the Thunder Voice!\r\n\r\nThe Indians had so named it—for that is what their word “Namshka”\r\nmeant—but grandpa himself had heard The Thunder Voice, when he was no\r\nolder than I, and he assured me that it was little akin to thunder in its\r\ntone, although it came to be known in the valley by the name the Indians\r\nhad given it.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night Jeanne Delloux lay dead in the pine-wood coffin in\r\nthe best room of Bartien Delloux’s cabin that The Thunder Voice was first\r\nheard in the valley.\r\n\r\nIt was a custom, when one died, that neighbors would sit all night with\r\nthe bereaved, to lessen somewhat the poignancy of the first smarting\r\nblows of grief. Bartien’s cabin could scarce hold them all that night,\r\nfor he was popular with the valley folk; and Jeanne, his wife, had been\r\nloved by young and old alike.\r\n\r\n“_Boom! Boom! A-i-e-h—_”\r\n\r\nIts first notes were deep and strong, but trailed off into a shrieking\r\nscream—first loud, then dying out in a wailing whine.\r\n\r\nThe men held their breath, their questioning eyes fixed upon each other.\r\nThe women screamed, and Millie Barton fainted.\r\n\r\nAgain and again it sounded, coming, it seemed, from somewhere down the\r\nvalley road. At length the men found voice:\r\n\r\n“It’s a panther,” suggested John Carroll. “I’ve heard many a one before.”\r\n\r\n“If you have, then you know that’s no panther,” another retorted.\r\n\r\nFear was written on every face but one. Old man Dodson—Old Bill Dodson,\r\nas he was known in the valley—had yet to learn what fear meant. But\r\nbefore another sunrise he was to know.\r\n\r\nShouldering his flint-lock musket, he opened the door and passed out into\r\nthe pitch-black night, which now and again was illuminated by flashes of\r\nlightning, for a storm had threatened since early twilight.\r\n\r\nGrouped about the fireplace, the others huddled together and listened,\r\nscarce breathing, for another of those cries which made the roots of\r\none’s hair to tingle, and the spine to prickle creepily. For a time it\r\ncame at almost regular intervals:\r\n\r\n“_Boom! Boom! A-i-e-h—_”\r\n\r\nAt length a shot was heard, and several of the men sprang to their feet.\r\n\r\n“He’s got it!” one cried. “Old Bill Dodson never missed a target in his\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nAnd, thus reassured, they stood in the doorway, listening, and then\r\ncalled loudly. From the black, still night there came no answer. Across\r\nthe ridge the rumble of distant thunder alone broke the awful quiet.\r\n\r\nIt was near daylight when they heard a shuffling step, and, opening the\r\ndoor, Dodson pitched headlong across the threshold. From his hands fell\r\nthe stock and barrel of his musket—broken one from the other!\r\n\r\nPhysically, the old man’s injuries were slight. On his swollen neck were\r\nfour blackened welts extending half way round it. Otherwise, he appeared\r\nunhurt—but his courage, his well-known bravery, was a thing of the past.\r\nFor the remainder of his life the old pioneer, who had faced so many\r\ndangers, was a nerveless coward. At any unusual noise he would start in\r\nabject terror.\r\n\r\nQuestioned, he could tell but little. He had seen an object—a dark bulky\r\n_something_—in the road, and had fired. It was too dark to see clearly,\r\nbut he could not have missed. Had it been of this earth it would now be\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nAfter the shot it had vanished among the shadows. He was hurrying toward\r\nit when something crashed down upon him from the overhanging boughs.\r\nLong, hairy fingers closed about his throat and all went black. It was\r\nthe devil himself—of that he was positive.\r\n\r\nEven these startling events might have been forgotten, if the Voice\r\nhad given an opportunity to forget. Now here, now there, it would be\r\nheard—sometimes in the direction of the ridge hills, at other times from\r\nthe river growth in the lowlands. Often it seemed quite near, and dogs\r\nwould bristle and whine, and lie under the beds with green-glowing eyes,\r\nas they quivered in nervous fear. The horses, too, would tremble in\r\ntheir stalls when the unknown monster broke the night stillness with its\r\nunearthly:\r\n\r\n“_Boom! Boom! A-i-e-h—_”\r\n\r\nThe valley people seldom ventured out at night; and the younger men no\r\nlonger sought opportunity to boast of their bravery.\r\n\r\nIt was some weeks after Jeanne Delloux was buried that Margaret Kingsley,\r\nthe young and pretty teacher of the valley school, disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt was the Carroll’s who boarded her that winter, and John Carroll had\r\ngone on a trip to the lower mill. Jennie, his wife, and the teacher were\r\nalone in the cabin that night. Jennie had protested that she would not be\r\nafraid, since Margaret would be with her.\r\n\r\nAs Jennie related it, they had been seated before the fire, she engaged\r\nin darning and Margaret correcting examination papers. For a time they\r\nhad been silently working when—from quite nearby—it came:\r\n\r\n“_Boom! Boom! A-i-e-h—_”\r\n\r\nSick and limp from terror, Jennie’s work rolled from her lap to the\r\nfloor. The dog was outside, and piteously it whined and scratched at the\r\ndoor, but she dared not open it.\r\n\r\nThen her attention centered on Margaret. She stood erect. Her face\r\nbetrayed no sign of fear. Instead—_she smiled_!\r\n\r\nThen, as Jennie watched, Margaret moved toward the door, opened it, and\r\nwalked out into the night.\r\n\r\nShe was never seen again!\r\n\r\nJennie called to her frantically, but there was no reply. She had moved\r\nas one might walk in a sleep—her eyes wide open, but fixed straight\r\nbefore her, gazing vacantly.\r\n\r\nWithin the next three months, until about the beginning of the spring\r\nrains, other strange things occurred in the valley.\r\n\r\nLucy Duval met the monster at dusk one evening as she followed the\r\npath through the woods behind the Rhodes’ place. She had swooned from\r\nterror, and, recovering, fled in panic to her home, fainting again from\r\nexhaustion as she reached the door. Safely within the house, she noticed\r\nfor the first time that her long hair, which had been coiled upon her\r\nhead, now hung unfettered. The pins and two side-combs, which had held it\r\nin place, were missing! Aside from the shock she was uninjured.\r\n\r\nA school child, too, saw the beast as she came from school, and while\r\nit was yet daylight. Her parents went in frantic search when she failed\r\nto arrive at the usual time, and found her cringing in terror by the\r\nroadside. Her leather school-bag, containing her books and writing\r\nmaterials, was nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nIt was a very long time before the child recovered from the fright\r\ninspired by “the big hairy man” as she described the monster.\r\n\r\nAgain, on a gusty, moon-haunted night, it was heard by Jule Darien and\r\nhis wife—right in their yard! Had they dared, they could have looked from\r\nthe window and seen it, but instead they bolted the door of their room\r\nand lay face down upon the bed—a fact they were not at all ashamed to\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Jule’s clothing still fluttered from the rope\r\nclothes-line, which spanned between oak trees in the yard behind the\r\ncabin—but every garment belonging to his wife had disappeared! An even\r\ngreater misfortune was the loss of three soft, heavy, woolen blankets.\r\nBut Jule Darien and his wife considered this a trivial matter in view of\r\nthe fact that they had been unharmed.\r\n\r\nIt was Delia Callahan, of all the valley folk, who found aught that was\r\namusing in these uncanny doings.\r\n\r\n“It’s true—as ol’ man Gibson’s always maintained—th’ devil’s a woman;\r\nain’t it proven, right ’ere in th’ valley?” she demanded. “An’ it’s an\r\neddication she’s goin’ to git, too. Some fine day she’ll be comin’ to\r\nth’ school wi’ her books in th’ school bag, an’ her hair done up wi’\r\nLucy Duval’s side-combs, an’ like as not a’ dressed up in Fan Darien’s\r\nclothes. _Ha! Ha!_—it’s too funny!” Shaken with laughter, she rocked back\r\nand forth until tears rolled from her bright blue eyes.\r\n\r\nBut she was quite alone in her mirth, for there was none who laughed with\r\nher. None dared to laugh. They feared to make sport of The Evil One.\r\n\r\nThe long winter broke at last with a protracted period of drenching\r\nrains. Never in all the experience of the valley dwellers had there been\r\nso much rain in such a length of time. Rivers could not be forded; the\r\nrich, loamy soil was washed in great patches from the fields; little\r\ngullies, usually dry, now ran brimming with muddy water. Cattle were\r\ndrowned and the spring planting was long delayed.\r\n\r\nBut when the sun again broke through the gray clouds people began to\r\nremark that for a long time they had not heard The Thunder Voice.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact it was never heard again.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II._\r\n\r\nSo ran the stories, and so often did my grandfather tell them, in order\r\nto humor my childish demands, that at length I could repeat them all—just\r\nas he told them, and almost word for word.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the years dropped into history, and recollection of “The\r\nThunder Stories” came to me but rarely; and brought, instead of thrills\r\nof horror, only a mild amusement, as I would reflect on them as folk-lore\r\nof the Valley of Trelane.\r\n\r\nBut, there was the disappearance of Margaret Kingsley. That was difficult\r\nto explain away. A normal, healthy young woman walks out into the night\r\nand is never seen again!\r\n\r\nHunters accustomed to trailing animals and Indians utterly failed in\r\ntheir efforts to find her, or to track this evil monster to its lair.\r\nOften its spoor was plainly marked—a four-toed foot of unfamiliar shape.\r\nBloodhounds had been brought from a distant settlement; but, as with the\r\nhuman hunters, the trail ended at the base of a huge white-oak tree.\r\nThere the dogs looked up and whined; they could follow the scent no\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nAlong with fairy tales, and stories of grim giants, told to me in\r\nchildhood days, these stories of the Thunder Voice might have passed into\r\nhazy forgetfulness, but for a grisly reminder which occurred while I was\r\nstudying to become a physician.\r\n\r\nIn the college I found much interest in visiting the library and poring\r\nover bound volumes of _The Medical Journal_. Some of these dated back to\r\nmany years before my birth.\r\n\r\nIt was while reading one of these that I suddenly started into quickened\r\ninterest at sight of a familiar name—_Bartien Delloux_!\r\n\r\nFor a few moments I could not recall where I had heard the name, and then\r\ncame back to me my grandfather’s stories. I pictured again, as I had\r\noften done before, the log cabin peopled with sympathetic neighbors come\r\nto console Bartien Delloux. The dead body of his wife in an adjoining\r\nroom. The dull rumble of distant thunder, with now and again flashes of\r\nlightning. And then, suddenly, from out the black night—The Thunder Voice!\r\n\r\nIt was he—the same Bartien Delloux—his name handed down on these\r\nage-brown pages in a history of most unusual kind.\r\n\r\nA physician had told the tale in plain matter-of-fact language. Briefly\r\nit was as follows:\r\n\r\nA patient, who said his name was Bartien Delloux, lay dying in a charity\r\nhospital. He asked for a priest. The priest remained with him until he\r\ndied. Then, coming to the doctor, the priest had remarked:\r\n\r\n“I think that man’s story is of more concern to your profession than to\r\nmine. I’m sorry you didn’t hear it.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” the doctor inquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, because it dealt with the bodily, not the spiritual side of life.\r\nIt was not confided to me under the sanctity of the confessional, for the\r\nman had nothing to confess in the matter. He simply wanted my opinion,\r\nand if possible some comforting assurance. Given under these conditions I\r\ncan repeat it to you.”\r\n\r\nUrged by the doctor, the priest continued:\r\n\r\n“At one time the man lived in one of the Eastern Townships of the\r\nProvince of Quebec, in a district known as the Valley of Trelane. Once a\r\nyear it was his custom to go to Quebec and market his stock of furs, for,\r\nlike others who dwelt in the valley, he combined the pursuit of farmer\r\nwith that of a hunter and trapper.\r\n\r\n“On one such trip his wife accompanied him. This was against his wishes,\r\nsince the journey at that early day was beset with dangers and hardships.\r\n\r\n“One day, as they walked about the city, they came upon a tentshow,\r\nstationed on a vacant lot. Outside the tent, banners announced the\r\nexhibition of a so-called ‘wild-man,’ said to have been captured in the\r\njungles of Africa. They visited this show, and from Delloux’s description\r\nthe creature was evidently a huge gorilla.\r\n\r\n“After a brief look at the ugly thing, Delloux made to go away, but his\r\nwife would not consent to leave. Fascinated, she stared between the iron\r\nbars, and the hideous-featured animal crept close to her, and crooned\r\nand gently whined as it gazed at her with little black beady eyes, which\r\npeeped from its black wrinkled face.\r\n\r\n“At length Delloux induced his wife to accompany him. As she moved away\r\nthe animal became violent. Tearing frantically at the iron bars, it\r\ngrowled and screamed. So vigorously did it shake the bars that it seemed\r\nthe cage must fall to pieces. The owner of the show urged them to leave\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n“They returned to their home, and later, when their child was born, it\r\nresembled—in miniature—the gorilla!”\r\n\r\n“It is not an impossible instance of pre-natal influence,” the doctor\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” replied the priest, “but there are incidents pertaining to\r\nits later life which I fancy are quite unusual.”\r\n\r\nThe priest’s story was resumed:\r\n\r\n“In spite of the ugliness of the half-beast the mother loved it dearly.\r\nShe realized, however, that it must not be seen by the neighbors, and in\r\nconsequence it was kept in the cellar, but when it grew older was allowed\r\nto roam about at night. Always it returned before daylight, and crept to\r\nits bed in a corner of the cellar.\r\n\r\n“Bright metal, and keen-edged tools, appeared to fascinate it, and due to\r\nthis the father first learned of its amazing strength.\r\n\r\n“Delloux possessed a long-bladed knife which he valued highly, and he was\r\nusing it one day in skinning a fox when his wife called to him. The knife\r\nwas left lying beside the half-skinned carcass of the animal. When he\r\nreturned, both had disappeared!\r\n\r\n“Entering the cellar, he found the beast cutting apart the body of\r\nthe fox and greedily eating it. It had never liked him; and when he\r\napproached and made as though to take away the knife it rose and, with a\r\nshove of its long arm, sent Delloux sprawling through the open doorway.\r\nWhen he picked himself up the creature faced him from the door, and\r\ngrowled menacingly.\r\n\r\n“It was then but ten years old.\r\n\r\n“Delloux was a strong man, but his strength was a puny thing when matched\r\nagainst this powerful brute. The knife was abandoned to it thereafter.\r\n\r\n“From that day on, it refused to eat cooked food; but at night went into\r\nthe forest and killed game, which it carried home and ate raw.\r\n\r\n“A few words of the French language it was able to learn, but not enough\r\nto permit of continued conversation.\r\n\r\n“Finally, on the night when Delloux’s wife lay dead, it went forth,\r\nnever to return to the cabin. That night, as Delloux’s neighbors were\r\ngathered about his fireside in friendly condolence, strange cries were\r\nheard—unlike those of any animal known to the vicinity. It inspired them\r\nwith a superstitious terror—and Delloux did not dare to make known to\r\nthem what he believed to be the real origin of the dread sounds.\r\n\r\n“After that night the weird, unearthly cries were repeated on many\r\nnights, and throughout the valley people came to believe that The Evil\r\nOne himself had come among them.\r\n\r\n“Delloux alone knew the truth.\r\n\r\n“There were strange occurrences in the valley that winter, but whether\r\nthe thing was responsible for them or not, Delloux could not say. Some\r\nclaimed to have seen it. Perhaps they had.\r\n\r\n“Finishing his story, the dying man begged me for assurance that this\r\ncurse put upon him did not signify that his soul was lost, and I did for\r\nhim what the Holy Church prescribes in cases of similar kind.”\r\n\r\nThere followed a lengthy report of the discussion by other physicians.\r\nSome argued that the story was untrue—impossible. Others considered it\r\nquite within the bounds of possibility.\r\n\r\nI closed the volume and gave myself over to reflection on the strangeness\r\nof this tale. Assuming that it were true, the mystery of The Thunder\r\nVoice was explained. But only in part, for many questions hurtled through\r\nmy mind as this story recalled them.\r\n\r\nWhat about Margaret Kingsley’s disappearance? Where had the beast lived\r\nafter it left Delloux’s home? Why had it indulged in the queer doings\r\nwhich were so meaningless and puzzling? Why did it voice those terrifying\r\ncries which frightened the usually brave pioneers? And, finally, what had\r\nhappened to still the awful Thunder Voice, leaving the valley people to\r\nregain their wonted equanimity?\r\n\r\nAt length I gave over the futile questioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III._\r\n\r\nAgain a measure of years slipped by, and I was nearing my fortieth\r\nbirthday. I had succeeded in my profession. I was happily married.\r\n\r\nIn the busy interest of full-lived days, the tales of The Thunder\r\nVoice were again relegated to a place alongside the story of\r\nJack-the-Giant-Killer and other legends of the kind. But subconsciously,\r\nbehind my sane, sunlit life, there lurked a strong desire to know the\r\ntruth—_all_ the truth—about this strange affair; for, try as I might, I\r\ncould not catalogue it with mythical legends, for somehow I _believed_\r\nDelloux’s story.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that I received a letter from a solicitor, who\r\nresided in a small town to the north of Quebec, informing me that\r\na relative—a man named Carroll—had died without making a will, and\r\nsearch had established that I was the next of kin, and his estate would\r\ntherefore come to me.\r\n\r\nI was greatly surprised, but on reflection I recalled having once heard\r\nthat the Carrolls, who lived in Trelane Valley were distantly related to\r\nme. At that time I had given the information no serious attention.\r\n\r\nIn order to settle the matter I went to interview the solicitor, and for\r\nthe first time in my life visited Trelane Valley. A broad fertile valley\r\nit was; now beautified by acres of waving grain. Along the road on which\r\nI motored were scattered substantial homes of the prosperous farmers.\r\n\r\nThe legal formalities had been concluded, and I had signed my name to the\r\nlast of several documents when I had a visit from a stranger.\r\n\r\nHe informed me that he was a Civil Engineer employed by the railway\r\ncompany whose line ran through the valley. Davis was his name. His\r\ncompany wished to build a water-tank nearby, and the only available water\r\nsupply which had been discovered was a large spring, which he understood\r\nwas located on land now owned by me. The company wished to lease the\r\nwater rights, and obtain permission to construct a pump house near the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAt his suggestion, I went with him to view the location of the spring,\r\nand decide what I should do regarding his proposition.\r\n\r\nAs we walked along the railway track he pointed out the location selected\r\nfor the tank, and then, leaving the right-of-way, we descended a gentle\r\nslope and, turning sharply to the left, came before the face of an\r\noutcropping ledge of gray, lichened stone.\r\n\r\nA large, almost circular, hole appeared in the cliff, and as we stood\r\nbefore it, there lay, a few feet beneath us, a pool of bright clear\r\nwater. The roof of the hole pitched downward at a uniform slope to where\r\nit met the level of the water.\r\n\r\nThe deal was quickly arranged, and a lease of the water rights drawn up\r\nand signed.\r\n\r\nI returned to Montreal and resumed my work.\r\n\r\nBut it was a matter of only a few weeks until I was again called to\r\nTrelane Valley. A letter from the railway company informed me that the\r\nsupply of water in the spring had failed, and they wished to cancel the\r\nlease.\r\n\r\nThe letter invited me to come and see for myself, and a few days later I\r\nagain stood at the mouth of the huge hole which opened into the upright\r\nface of the cliff.\r\n\r\nBut now the water had receded until, from the entrance, one could discern\r\nonly a black pool, far underground. The hole in the cliff was now the\r\nentrance to a cave of impressive dimensions. The shaft pitched downward\r\nat a gentle slope, and I could see that the roof of the cave now hung\r\nclear, above the water.\r\n\r\nThrough mud and slime we waded along the floor of the cavern until we\r\nreached the water’s edge. Davis carried a flashlight, which he turned\r\ninto the further depth. On the other side of the water the floor sloped\r\nupward until it became lost in the gloom beyond the reach of the light.\r\n\r\nSomewhat past the opposite edge of the water, I made out two\r\nobjects—bulky, and but dimly defined against the black floor.\r\n\r\n“What do you think they are?” I asked Davis.\r\n\r\n“Loose boulders—flaked off from above. Stones are always dropping from\r\nthe roof of caves.”\r\n\r\nThis suggestion left me unsatisfied. Of course, such stones might be of\r\nalmost any shape, and yet the outline of those objects did not suggest\r\nthe chance figure of loose stones.\r\n\r\nCuriosity mastered me, but I was silent.\r\n\r\nReturning to the village, the cancellation of the lease was soon\r\neffected. The very next day the pumping engine was hauled away, and\r\nthe board shack which housed it was torn down and removed. A few\r\npieces of its timber framing were left lying about—some of substantial\r\ncross-section, and some pieces of board.\r\n\r\nThis I noticed with satisfaction, for they would prove useful in carrying\r\nout my determination to explore the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV._\r\n\r\nThat night, while the village people slept, I walked to the cave. I was\r\nequipped with a hammer, some nails, and an electric flashlight.\r\n\r\nFrom the refuse lumber of the pump-house I constructed a raft, and with a\r\npole to propel it, easily crossed the pool of water, and stepped out into\r\nthe muddy slime which covered the upward slope of the cave floor.\r\n\r\nAlthough encrusted with mud, it was at once apparent that one of the\r\nobjects I had come to examine was a human skeleton.\r\n\r\nBut, _such_ a skeleton!\r\n\r\nShort of stature it was, with a barrel-like chest of prodigious size. The\r\narms reached well below the knees. The skull was of unusual thickness and\r\nabnormal shape.\r\n\r\nIt required no effort of imagination to recall the stories of The Thunder\r\nVoice. Such a frame must have housed lungs of a power far surpassing\r\nthat of any ordinary human being. I could easily conjecture the vocal\r\nmight this creature had possessed when this skeleton had housed a living\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nThe other object was a boat—of most unusual build.\r\n\r\nIt was constructed from rough slabs which had apparently been hewn from\r\nsolid timbers with an ax. It was flat-bottomed, with square ends which\r\nsloped upward. The pieces were fastened together by wooden pegs driven\r\nthrough roughly cut holes.\r\n\r\nI turned from the boat and, climbing the sloping floor, roved my light\r\nabout as I continued my exploration. A little further along the floor\r\nunder my feet became dry, and then the cave turned abruptly to the left.\r\nJust beyond this turn I stumbled over something.\r\n\r\nIt, too, was a skeleton!\r\n\r\nDifferent in every particular from the first, however. Its living tenant\r\nhad been fairly tall, and with a well-proportioned figure. The cave was\r\nquite dry here, and only a light dust covered the yellowed bones.\r\n\r\nMy interest quickened. There had been _two_ tenants in this unknown cave!\r\nOne, I felt sure, had been the son of Bartien Delloux—the creature with\r\nThe Thunder Voice. But who had shared this dark cavern with him?\r\n\r\nInch by inch, I examined the floor, the walls, and even the roof of the\r\ncavern. There was little to be seen—some bones of small animals, the\r\nrusted blade of an axe, portions of rotted fur, and in a nook opening out\r\nfrom the main cave were some scattered fibers of decayed cloth.\r\n\r\nFinally, when I was on the point of turning about to leave the place,\r\nI found something which fired me with renewed interest. It was a small\r\nbottle of flattish shape. The bottom was covered with dry, black, flaky\r\nparticles—dried ink, I surmised.\r\n\r\nIn a crevasse of the rock I found a rotted leather bag, which\r\nfell to pieces at my touch. From it dropped several articles, but\r\neagerly I seized upon one—an age-yellowed, thin, paper book; such as\r\nschool-children, even to this day, use for writing exercises.\r\n\r\nGingerly I turned the leaves, for the paper was brittle with age. The\r\npages were filled with writing—but no childish scrawl, this!\r\n\r\nThe penmanship was exquisite—of that type affected by ladies of a\r\ngeneration long past—the letters narrow and slanting, yet as clear and\r\ndistinct as those on a printed page.\r\n\r\nCarefully I tucked the book inside my coat, and with all possible haste\r\nmade my way back to the village hotel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLocking the door of my room, I opened the book, and the words upon its\r\nfirst page brought me to a startled attention:\r\n\r\n    “_Why am I, Margaret Kingsley, the child of good, honorable\r\n    parents, living now in a cave, eating raw meat, existing as\r\n    a savage—my mate, a hideous creature whose very sight would\r\n    disgust and appall the people I have heretofore known?_\r\n\r\n    “_The answer is, that I am here because I WANT to be here.\r\n    Since the night when he called to me, and I went forth to be\r\n    carried here in his arms, I have had many chances to escape,\r\n    but I CHOOSE TO REMAIN!_\r\n\r\n    “_Ugly he is, beyond argument, but I love him for his giant\r\n    strength, and for the tenderness he shows me—a tenderness\r\n    exceeding that of a mother for her child. Within his misshapen\r\n    body is a heart starved for affection—and that I am glad to\r\n    give._\r\n\r\n    “_Only a few words of French can he speak, and yet he quickly\r\n    grasps my unspoken wishes and tries to gratify them._\r\n\r\n    “_This book, the quill, the ink with which I write this,\r\n    belonged to one of my pupils. The other night he brought them\r\n    to me, in the bag containing her school books. How he obtained\r\n    them I know not. Secretly I had longed for the materials with\r\n    which to write—not that human eyes will ever see that which is\r\n    written here—but because I have been accustomed to write down\r\n    the things which are me—those inner thoughts and impulses which\r\n    possess and dominate me._”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen followed pages describing her life in the cave—and of night journeys\r\nthrough the woods when her mate would delight himself in voicing wild\r\ncries—sounds which she came to love. Wildly she rejoiced with him, and\r\nlaughed as she thought of the terror these resounding cries brought to\r\nthe simple folk in the valley below them.\r\n\r\nStrangest of all, she thought, was his understanding of her slightest\r\nwish without the medium of words.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion she was trying to arrange her long hair, but the\r\nhairpins she had brought to the cave had, one by one, been lost. It was\r\nimpossible to arrange the hair with none, and she had been vexed. That\r\nvery night he brought her some hairpins and two side-combs. The latter\r\nshe recognized—they belonged to Lucy Duval! Again she wondered how he had\r\nobtained them; and laughed as she considered Lucy’s probable fright.\r\n\r\nAnother time she had shivered with the cold, for the cave had been\r\ndamp—the next night he brought clothing, and several woolen blankets.\r\n\r\nWhatever he might be to others, he was her chosen man. He could not live\r\nher kind of life—gladly she would live his.\r\n\r\nThen came an entry on the very last page.\r\n\r\n    “_The storm! How it has rained, and rained, until somewhere\r\n    the flood has changed the course of some small stream, and now\r\n    we are imprisoned—the water has risen to the roof of the cave,\r\n    and we can no longer leave it in the boat. The flood came quite\r\n    suddenly, last night, while we slept._\r\n\r\n    “_Perhaps it may subside in time—but probably it will not. I\r\n    shall write no more. Good-bye, little book, and good-bye to\r\n    all—everything! In dying I can reflect that at least I have\r\n    lived. So very many never do!_”\r\n\r\nI closed the book. At last my strong desire to _know_ had been gratified.\r\nIn the yellowed manuscript which I held in my hand was inscribed the last\r\nchapter in the mystery of The Thunder Voice.\r\n\r\nNow that curiosity was satisfied, the professional instinct asserted\r\nitself. I reflected on the peculiar warped trait which so often causes\r\na woman gifted with all the refinements of civilization to become\r\ninfatuated with a male who is, in every sense, a barbarian.\r\n\r\nI recalled the season at Earlscourt exposition in London when a dozen\r\nblack, repulsive-featured cannibals had been exhibited. The over-zealous\r\nattentions of a concourse of well-dressed women of apparent refinement,\r\nwho daily surged about them, caused their removal from the exhibit.\r\n\r\nNo, there was nothing very remarkable in the infatuation confessed by\r\nMargaret Kingsley. At least it was not remarkable to those who observe\r\nlife with wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE No. 27\r\n\r\n_A Few Minutes in a Madhouse_\r\n\r\n_By_ MOLLIE FRANK ELLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Maynard paused midway of the long hospital corridor and waved an\r\ninclusive hand toward its twin rows of iron-barred cells.\r\n\r\n“This, Wayne,” he said, “is the Psychopathic Ward. We have some unusual\r\ncases here. Take, for instance, Number Twenty-Seven. I’m sure you will be\r\ninterested in Number Twenty-Seven. Step this way.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI obeyed with reluctance. I was concerned with Maynard, not his\r\npsychopathic cases. We had not seen each other since our college days,\r\ntwenty years before, and I had hoped for a return of our old intimacy\r\nduring these few hours together, which chance had thrown in my way.\r\n\r\nI had knocked about the world, acquiring the kaleidoscopic knowledge of\r\nlife accorded the globe-trotter. Maynard had stayed at home, tinkering\r\nwith the mental workings of the human machinery until his name stood for\r\nthe accomplishment of amazing things in the realm of psychopathy. Each\r\nhad run true to form: Maynard’s passion was to make the wheels go round;\r\nmine to wonder why they went.\r\n\r\n“This is Number Twenty-Seven,” Maynard continued, as he stopped before\r\na cell door. “I’ll let her tell her own story.... Good morning, Mrs.\r\nHoward. How are you this morning?”\r\n\r\nAt his words, a woman slowly rose from a bench against the far wall of\r\nthe cell. Then, abruptly, she made a sudden rush that ended in a frantic\r\nshaking of the iron bars of the cell door where we stood.\r\n\r\n“Doctor Maynard! You’re a-goin to let me out, ain’t you? You’re a-goin’\r\nto let me go home an’ rub Jim’s head so’s he can sleep? Jim cain’t sleep\r\nunless I rub his head for him. You know he cain’t, Doctor! I’ve told you\r\nso, often.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. You’ve told me often, Mrs. Howard.” Maynard gave me a\r\nsignificant glance. “But tell me again, please. Maybe I will understand\r\nbetter this time and let you go.”\r\n\r\nThe woman strained her gaunt body against the cell door. She seemed in\r\na torture of anxiety, obsessed by a vital current of emotion in sharp\r\ncontrast to the pitiful meagerness of her personality.\r\n\r\nShe wore a cheap cotton dress; her hair was plain about her sharp face;\r\nand there was written upon her countenance that look of repression, of\r\nnegation of all right to exist as an individual, which marks the poorer\r\ntype of rural woman.\r\n\r\nIt seemed for a moment as if she would break into a torrent of words;\r\nthen abruptly she fell back, silent, and the heartbreak in her eyes was\r\nsucceeded by a slow-growing horror. Yet her tragedy, whatever it might\r\nbe, brought with it a certain dignity which she had hitherto lacked. Her\r\nattenuated homeliness forbade distinction, yet when she made pitiful\r\napology to Maynard, a certain nobility of soul shone from her eyes.\r\n\r\n“I’d forgot for a minute, Doctor Maynard, that I’d killed Jim. I’d forgot\r\nthat I hated him. I was thinkin’ he was alive and that I loved him like I\r\nused to before the children was killed. I’m a wicked woman—the wickedest\r\nwoman that ever lived; but I wouldn’t be in this penitentiary if Jim\r\ncould a-slept without havin’ to have his head rubbed.”\r\n\r\nMaynard touched my foot at the word “penitentiary.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Mrs. Howard.” His voice seemed unnecessarily loud\r\nand cheerful against the thin anguish of her tones. “Tell me about the\r\nchildren. How were they killed?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“They was run over, Doctor.”\r\n\r\nNo words can describe the deadness of her voice, as of a fierce pain\r\nburnt out for lack of fuel for further endurance.\r\n\r\n“It was the poultry truck that goes by the farm every morning. Milly was\r\ntoo little to know not to git in the road, an’ Jacky run out to grab her\r\nback an’ he fell, Jacky did. ’Twasn’t nobody’s fault, Doctor. The man\r\nthat drives the truck, he always waved at the children as he passed, and\r\nhe most went crazy when it happened. An’ Milly was too little to know\r\nbetter; an’ Jackie done the best he could—only six years old.\r\n\r\n“But afterwards me an’ Jim couldn’t sleep. At first we did, a night or\r\ntwo, ’cause we was all wore out with the funeral and such; but after\r\nthe kinfolks was gone we couldn’t. We could see their faces—Milly’s and\r\nJacky’s.\r\n\r\n“Then, after a while, Jim got so’s he didn’t see ’em so bad, an’ he said\r\nhe could ’a’ slept, only for me. He said I ought to be a-gittin’ over it\r\nsome; an’ I reckon I should ’a’ been. I tried to, but it didn’t do no\r\ngood. Mebby ’twas because they was just the two of ’em an’ both goin’ at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Jim got right fretful at me. He said a man couldn’t work on a farm an’\r\nnot sleep. He was right, too. Jim always was sensible.\r\n\r\n“One night after I had worritted him considerable, a-cryin’, I found out\r\nthat I could put him to sleep by rubbin’ his forehead, slow an’ firm; an’\r\nso I done it right along every night after that an’ he slept fine. I was\r\nglad, ’cause Jim was a hard worker an’ a good provider; an’ a man can’t\r\nwork on a farm an’ not sleep.\r\n\r\n“But somehow, after Jim had got to sleep of nights, things seemed a heap\r\nlonesomer. Mebby if we’d lived nearer to the neighbors ’twould ’a’ helped\r\nsome. ’Twas so awful still, nights, out where we lived; an’ the moon come\r\nin at the winder so white an’ all....\r\n\r\n“Times, just before dawn, I’d git to wonderin’ if it would ’a’ happened\r\nif I’d ’a’ been out in the front yard, a-watchin’ out for the childern,\r\ninstead of washin’ back in the kitchen. And I’d git to shakin’ all over\r\nan’ couldn’t stop. Once I waked Jim up and begged him to talk to me; but\r\nhe said it wouldn’t help none for two of us to be losin’ our sleep, so I\r\nnever done it any more. Jim always was sensible.\r\n\r\n“At last I got so the work ’round the house dragged on me until I was\r\nafraid I couldn’t git things done. I told Jim about it and he was sorry.\r\nBut he said a woman’s work didn’t matter so much—it could be let go—but a\r\nman had to make the livin’.\r\n\r\n“Even with the work and all, I never wanted night to come. I’d git all\r\nscared when it come on dusk. Jim didn’t like it. He said it wasn’t no\r\nway to welcome a man home after a hard day’s work; an’ it wasn’t. I done\r\nmy best, but somehow I couldn’t laugh much or be lovin’; so Jim took to\r\ndrivin’ to town after supper was over. He hadn’t never done that before\r\nthe children was killed.\r\n\r\n“Some times he’d stay real late. Me not bein’ used to bein’ left alone\r\nmade it worse, too. Sometimes I’d git so tired waitin’ up for him I’d\r\nfeel like I could go to sleep right then. But of course I couldn’t,\r\naccount of havin’ to rub his head. You see, he’d got to dependin’ on it,\r\nan’, as he said, a man had to have his sleep or he couldn’t work.\r\n\r\n“All this time, Doctor, I was lovin’ Jim an’ tryin’ to git along the best\r\nI could. I knowed I’d been lucky to git Jim. He was a good man. He never\r\ntook tantrums like Pa. We’d never dared cross Pa at home ’cause he was\r\nexcitable-like; an’ finally he went crazy. They would a-took him to the\r\nasylum, I reckon, only he died.\r\n\r\n“Mebby I’d ’a’ got so’s I could a-slept after a while, only ’bout this\r\ntime it come on to October, when the fall winds begin to blow, an’ the\r\nhouse would creak of nights—kind of little breakin’ noises like babies\r\nwhisperin’.... An’ the shadows of the leaves on our big tree outside\r\nthe winder kept twistin’ about on the walls like little hands a-pushin’\r\nagainst coffin lids, a-tryin’ to git out an’ go back an’ find their\r\nmammy’s breasts.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly and stood in tense stillness—as if she were back\r\nin that hushed house of sorrow, with its sharp noises and its tiny,\r\nmother-seeking shadow-hands upon the walls—listening to the silence, the\r\nunendurable silence, of the waning hours.\r\n\r\nDoctor Maynard made a restless movement. With a start, the woman came\r\nback to realities and turned to us once more.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t git to hatin’ Jim, Doctor, until after I took to usin’ them\r\npills they gave Ma when she was on her deathbed. She died, leavin’ a\r\nbottle of ’em on the kitchen shelf—morphine, they call ’em. One night,\r\nwhen I just couldn’t stand it no longer, I thought of them an’ I got one\r\nan’ it helped a lot.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, apparently musing upon how much it had helped. Then she went\r\non:\r\n\r\n“’Twas along about then that I got to hatin’ Jim, lookin’ at him sleepin’\r\nso hard, his face all red an’ his mouth open. ’Twasn’t that so much,\r\nthough, Doctor, ’cause I always thought Jim was nice-lookin’ even though\r\nhe was coarse complected. But he got to havin’ restless spells, wakin’ up\r\nalong of cock-crowin’ time, ’bout when I’d got my pill an’ had kind of\r\nquit shakin’ over the shadows an’ things. Then I’d have to rouse up to\r\n’em again an’ rub him to sleep once more. I got to wonderin’ if he’d die\r\nright off, without it’s hurtin’ him none, if I’d press down hard on them\r\nsoft spots in his temples. Seem like havin’ to do it any more would be\r\nmore’n I could bear—”\r\n\r\nShe stopped again as if re-living her torture; perhaps slipping once more\r\nlike a white wraith from bedroom to kitchen shelf and back again, to\r\nstand looking down upon her husband’s sprawled figure, battling against\r\nthe up-surge of desire to crush out the life beneath her hands and be\r\nforever free from her hideous task!\r\n\r\n“... I didn’t kill Jim, though, Doctor, until them pills give out. I\r\nreckon mebby I wouldn’t never have done it if they hadn’t give out. But\r\nafter that ... sometime after that I killed Jim. I pressed down—down....”\r\n\r\nMaynard waited until he was sure she had finished; then he spoke in a\r\ncommanding tone.\r\n\r\n“_Mrs. Howard!_”\r\n\r\nStartled, she stared at us as if seeing us for the first time. She\r\ngrasped the cell door and shook it in a frenzy of anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Doctor Maynard! You’re a-goin’ to let me out, ain’t you? You’re a-goin’\r\nto let me go home an’ rub Jim’s head for him so’s he can sleep? Jim\r\ncain’t sleep unless I rub his head! I’ve told you so often, Doctor....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaynard drew me away; but that pleading voice followed us down the length\r\nof the corridor, thin, anguished—\r\n\r\nI hurried.\r\n\r\nWhen we had closed the door of the Psychopathic Ward behind us, Maynard\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Now that’s the interesting part of it—that last—to a psychologist. Did\r\nyou note that she still loves him, whenever she comes out from under her\r\nobsession about killing him?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t she kill him?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. You see, when she could get no more of the drug, her grief\r\nand her loss of sleep ‘turned her brain,’ as you laymen would say.\r\nRemember what she said about ‘Pa’.”\r\n\r\nI battled with my bewilderment at this unexpected turn of the affair.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t understand!” I stammered.\r\n\r\n“Probably not. I shall try to explain it, as simply as possible and\r\nwithout using scientific terms. You see, she had _wanted_ to kill him for\r\nso long—had gone over the manner of it so often in her silent vigils—that\r\nwhen at last her conscious mind became unbalanced the resisted desire\r\ntook its revenge by becoming a subconscious obsession, which announced\r\nitself an accomplished fact. It is an interesting sidelight on\r\npsychopathy, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\nI did not. I changed the subject.\r\n\r\n“What became of the man—her husband? How did he take it?”\r\n\r\n“Well. Very well, indeed. Level-headed fellow. Of course, he was upset\r\nat first over her condition; but when we made it clear to him that she\r\nwas incurable he calmed down. He went home and slept on it for a night or\r\ntwo—”\r\n\r\n“How do you suppose,” I broke in (I really could not resist asking\r\nit)—“How do you suppose he got to sleep without—”\r\n\r\n“... And then he applied for a divorce,” continued Maynard, ignoring my\r\nchildish rudeness. “He wants to marry again, but, of course, our laws—”\r\n\r\n“_Marry!_”\r\n\r\nMaynard frowned. “One can see his point of view.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; to be sure. And our laws ... quite unsympathetic—”\r\n\r\nMaynard dismissed the matter with a magnanimous gesture. Also, his\r\nkindling eye bespoke a concentration of interest which ignored the\r\ntrivial. He peered at me eagerly.\r\n\r\n“What would you think, Wayne—I am studying the case, and I ask\r\nfor information—would you be led to believe that her reason for\r\nwanting to kill him was a subconscious sensing of that trait in him,\r\nthat eagerness to be rid of whatever irked him, regardless of his\r\nresponsibilities? Or, on the other hand, would you think it a flair of\r\nsex antagonism—resentment that he, unlike herself, could resume a normal\r\nexistence so soon after an emotional cataclysm?”\r\n\r\nI fumbled my hat and turned toward the door. I wanted to get away.\r\n\r\n“My time is up, Maynard,” I said hastily. “Sorry, but I must go. Glad to\r\nhave had this visit with you. Awfully proud to have been the classmate\r\nof a celebrity, you know, and all that. But I really cannot follow your\r\nscientific subtleties. If you mean do I think his cruelty drove her mad—”\r\n\r\nMaynard threw up his hands. “Oh you laymen!” he laughed. “But come in\r\nagain, Wayne. Any time you’re passing through town. Glad to see you\r\nalways. We have some very interesting cases here.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeaf and Blind Students Perform Miracles\r\n\r\n\r\nWide attention has been attracted by two students at Northwestern\r\nUniversity, one of them stone blind, the other deaf and dumb, by reason\r\nof their marvelous demonstrations in “seeing” and “hearing.” Wiletta\r\nHuggins, deaf and dumb, can hear with her fingertips, or by placing a\r\npole against a speaker’s chest and feeling the vibrations. Professor\r\nRobert H. Gault is conducting a series of experiments with her that may\r\neventually lead to teaching deaf mutes to talk. No less remarkable are\r\nthe achievements of the blind student, Carl Bostrom, who has so trained\r\nhis facial nerves and ears that he can “see” things that are denied those\r\nwho have the use of their eyes. In a crowded court room, he could tell,\r\nby the sound of a prisoner’s voice, whether or not he was telling the\r\ntruth. Also, with uncanny accuracy, he told the dimensions of the room,\r\nlocated the doors and windows, and calmly announced that on one side of\r\nthe room only men were standing, and on the other only women.\r\n\r\n“I can tell by the sounds,” he said—“little sounds that most people miss.\r\nThere is a difference in the noises made by men and women.”\r\n\r\nA reporter asked him how many persons there were in the court.\r\n\r\nHe listened acutely, then said, “Seventy-five.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter guessed one hundred. Another guess estimated the number at\r\nsixty. The persons in the room were counted. There were exactly eighty\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Finale\r\n\r\n_By_ WM. MERRIT\r\n\r\n\r\nThornton Stowe was always a puzzle to me. Very methodical in everything\r\nfrom early childhood, he always seemed utterly devoid of impulsive\r\nemotion. The only thing he ever did that really surprised me was to\r\nsuddenly declare, one evening, that he loved Josephine Thralton and was\r\nbetrothed to her.\r\n\r\nSoon, vague rumors about Stowe’s private life were breathed around\r\ntown, and his fianceé married Lakeland; the thick lipped, pock marked,\r\nred nosed political boss of the town, whose character was known and\r\nunquestioned, and about which each citizen held a private, unvoiced\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nI left town shortly after the wedding, and all that I heard of Stowe\r\nafter that was a newspaper account of his killing Lakeland. I then wrote\r\nhim the only letter since my departure; but knew him too well to expect\r\nan answer.\r\n\r\nI returned, unannounced, one dreary afternoon in November. Quickening\r\nmy steps as I left the depot, I turned toward the roller mill, which to\r\nthe world was Stowe’s sole vocation, but to me, only his avocation for\r\nthe purpose of defraying expenses of the work in his private chemical\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nI had left him experimenting with an explosive gas which was more\r\npowerful and much cheaper than the most modern gunpowder. But it corroded\r\nevery metal known, except gold. If he could only find some means of\r\neliminating this fault, his fortune would be made.\r\n\r\nAs I hurried through the heart of town, a lone pedestrian, who seemed\r\nto shudder at the doleful dirge of the bare tree limbs overhead, and to\r\nshrink from looking at the gloomy, leaden skies beyond, approached with\r\nstooped shoulders and bowed head. It was Thornton Stowe; but he had so\r\nchanged since I had seen him last that, had he not spoken, I would have\r\npassed him by. On the instant of recognition I was about to greet him\r\ncheerfully, but there was such an air of pathos in his whole bearing\r\nthat I merely walked up and gripped his hand. It was as listless as his\r\nspirits, and he looked into my eyes with a silent appeal that sickened my\r\nsoul to think of the emotions that impelled it.\r\n\r\nFinally I ventured, “How’s business in the old town now, Thornt?” I had\r\nalmost asked: “What’s the trouble?” but remembered that he had killed\r\nLakeland in July and, although he had been cleared on the plea of “self\r\ndefense” I felt a delicacy in arousing such reminiscences in a man of his\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nHis reply puzzled me:\r\n\r\n“Let’s go on home to dinner. I’ve got to tell it to somebody.”\r\n\r\nHe left me to my conjectures the rest of the way to his home, a large\r\ngray brick house, a mansion for that little town, where he lived alone\r\nwith a faithful old negro man, an ex-slave, who prepared his meals and\r\nkept the house in order. The untrimmed ivy on the walls of the old\r\nantibellum home was in keeping with the neglected condition of the house,\r\nwhich looked now like an old deserted castle. There was no light in the\r\nfront windows, although it was long after sundown. As we approached, my\r\nspirits were damped with awe at the weird aspect. A premonition of horror\r\nhaunted me and it was only by a tremendous effort that I refrained from\r\nmaking some excuse to go immediately to the hotel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door swung open noiselessly and easily and Stowe switched on the\r\nlights in the hall. Everything was green, the sickly, poisonous green\r\nof a stagnant tarn. The grim monotony of the hideous color, and the\r\nsuddenness with which the horrible aspect was revealed was appalling. The\r\ncurtains were green, the walls were green, the woodwork and furniture\r\nwere all green. With each turn of my head I was confronted by nothing but\r\nthat nauseating hue. My head swam. The ghastly invariable color seemed to\r\nbe pressing my eyeballs back into their sockets and irresistibly closing\r\never closer and closer around me with its overwhelming and unbroken\r\ndensity. The dull light from the green globe that hung in the center of\r\nthe hall seemed to stifle me. I was on the point of rushing back to the\r\nstreet in frantic terror.\r\n\r\nWe disposed of our coats and hats without a word and walked back to the\r\nlibrary. Again everything was the same ghastly green. The impelling\r\nterror of aggravated claustrophobia rushed back upon me with redoubled\r\nfury. I could not by force of will power, nor by artifice of reason,\r\nshake off the uncanny dread that haunted me; but was now determined to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nDrinks were served, and my host then addressed me for the first time\r\nsince we had started home from the street; merely:\r\n\r\n“Help yourself.”\r\n\r\nHe reached eagerly for a green bottle on the tray, drank two glasses of\r\nabsinthe from it, then rested his elbows on the table and stared steadily\r\nat me for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThe real specter now rose before me: had he killed Lakeland for self\r\ndefense or was it merely the diabolic fancy of a lunatic? If, with the\r\nprecise cunning of a maniac, he had devised a scheme so intricate and\r\nflawless that it had baffled even the eye witnesses, then I was at the\r\nmercy of a man, known to have the power of thought impelled by passions\r\nand emotions and not controlled by reason.\r\n\r\nHe began in an even hollow voice:\r\n\r\n“I guess you know why I killed Lakeland.”\r\n\r\n“I heard they found ‘self defense,’” I admitted.\r\n\r\nHe swallowed a glass of wine at a gulp, then sneered with a note of irony:\r\n\r\n“Unquestionable evidence. Lakeland is the only man who has ever even\r\nsuspected that I intended to kill him when I shook hands with him.\r\n\r\n“You can guess the first thing he did: but he was Josephine’s husband\r\nbefore I learned who started those stories. I felt that she hadn’t given\r\nme a fair chance to disprove all he had said and I resolved to forget\r\nher; but when I saw her getting paler and thinner because of the life she\r\nhad to live, I couldn’t help feeling a sympathy for her. When Lakeland\r\nwanted to buy back the mill I had bought from his father because he had\r\nfound it to be the best paying business in town, I was fool enough to\r\ntell him I’d trade with him if he would stop drinking. Of course he just\r\ntold me to go to hell with my morals and threw all his money into an\r\neffort to kill my business.\r\n\r\n“I played the game with him until all my men suddenly refused to work\r\nlonger, and refused to explain why. That was too much; I shoved a pistol\r\ninto my pocket and went in search of him that very afternoon. When I\r\nfound him, he was, as usual, beastly drunk. To shoot him then would\r\nconvict me of murder in the first degree. Besides, I couldn’t snuff his\r\nlife out that way if my revenge was to be sweet. He must know about it,\r\nfor half the delight of revenge would be in knowing that I had made him\r\nsuffer without its costing me a thing.”\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the mad man’s logic; for mad he certainly was.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he went on, “I thought first of my chemistry. He would come\r\nto liquor like a hog to slop. A little potassium cyanide in it and he\r\nwould simply drop dead. There would be no symptoms of poison and the\r\ncoroner’s verdict would be ‘heart failure.’ But I never drank with him\r\nand could not afford to make a special occasion for poisoning him. I\r\nmerely walked by.\r\n\r\n“‘Hello,’ he grunted. ‘Looks like I’ll have to run you clear out of town\r\nto get that mill. It isn’t half as easy to take away as your girl was.’\r\n\r\n“Several heard it; and I wouldn’t have changed a word he said if I had\r\nhad the power.\r\n\r\n“The very next day Lewis Dalton came into the mill and told me that\r\nLakeland was inquiring for me down in town. ‘And he’s sober today,’ he\r\nadded. What better could I ask? I shoved a wrench into my pocket—that\r\nwould be easily enough explained—and started immediately to town. I met\r\nhim just as I turned the corner on to Main Street. There were several\r\npeople in sight, but none within a hundred feet of us.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStowe’s expression had been gradually changing ever since he had begun\r\nhis story. Now he was completely transformed. He leaned far over the\r\ntable toward me, every muscle tense, his eyes snapping with a steely\r\nglint that made me shudder to see. I took another drink of wine, but, for\r\nthe first time, he seemed to forget his completely. His lips drew in a\r\nthin, straight, colorless line as he hissed with diabolic vehemence:\r\n\r\n“I held out my hand to him civilly enough, but spoke before he took it.\r\nI didn’t call him Lakeland that time either, I called him by his right\r\nname, the name he’s deserved ever since this world has been cursed with\r\nhis damned green eyed face. His hand went straight into his coat under\r\nhis arm, but I was ready for him. I grabbed his wrist and shoved him\r\nback against the wall. As soon as he saw the wrench in my other hand he\r\nrealized that I was going to kill him, and the dammed coward got so weak\r\nin the legs that he didn’t even try to get away. He groaned like a calf\r\nwhen I hit him right over the temple. But his eyes; they still had enough\r\nof the devil in them to look at me even while he was falling, and say:\r\n‘You’re not ahead yet, even with this.’”\r\n\r\nHe reached again for the green bottle and I offered no protest. Although\r\nhe had already had enough for two men, anything would be better than his\r\npresent condition.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t even know that she was sick when I killed him,” he continued.\r\n“When they told me, I went straight to the house. She was dying—dying,\r\nand that brute was down in town just walking around the streets while she\r\nwas calling for him and begging him to come to her! She recognized me as\r\nsoon as I got into the room and seemed to know all.\r\n\r\n“‘Where is Jim?’ she begged me to tell her.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t answer her. I couldn’t.\r\n\r\n“‘Will I have to go to him?’ she cried; and she never spoke again, and\r\nnever took her eyes from mine. She is still looking straight into my\r\neyes. And since she died,” he groaned, “her eyes have gotten as green as\r\nhis.”\r\n\r\n“Then why, in the name of Heaven, have you made everything in the house\r\ngreen?” I asked, reminded once more of our hideous surroundings.\r\n\r\n“So that I couldn’t see them here. But every way I turn they are looking\r\nstraight at me. Sometimes they almost blaze when I try to look away.”\r\n\r\nThere was but one chance for him now: he must have some diversion. I\r\nforgot that I had come to stay this time.\r\n\r\n“Say, Thornt,” I suggested, “come with me for a few weeks hunting in the\r\nmountains. It’s been two years since you and I were together on a trip.”\r\n\r\nHe sat for a moment in deep thought, his face twitching convulsively, his\r\neyes staring into vacancy.\r\n\r\n“I am going to get out of this town,” he finally asserted.\r\n\r\nI reached my hand across the table to him. He hesitated as though he\r\ndidn’t understand, but finally took it with the same grasp he had given\r\nme on the street when he recognized my sympathy for him, and with the\r\nsame pathetic appeal in his eye, gripped it until I winced.\r\n\r\nWhile I still pondered over the situation he straightened up resolutely,\r\nas though he had finally reached a determination. With a desperate effort\r\nto control the emotion that now convulsed his whole being, he addressed\r\nme in a dry, husky voice:\r\n\r\n“Frank, excuse me for a moment; and as we have always been friends, don’t\r\nthink hard of me tonight.”\r\n\r\nI nodded an assent and he walked slowly to a door at the far side of the\r\nroom, passed through and closed it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I found myself alone, the grim horror of my surroundings\r\nattacked me with reinforced fury. The dread of my wretched host’s\r\ninsanity became more intense with him in the next room on a mysterious\r\nmission, at which he had asked me not to be offended. Not even the\r\nslightest sound proceeded now from the room he had entered. The\r\nchangeless monotony of the omnipresent green was enhanced by the\r\noppressive silence that reigned throughout the house, save for the\r\nintolerable tick of the old clock that stood on the floor in the corner,\r\nand seemed to pause indefinitely after each stroke, measuring eternity\r\ninstead of time.\r\n\r\nI had never seen inside that room more than half a dozen times in my\r\nwhole life. There was nothing in there to go for. It had been used as a\r\nstore room for old furniture ever since I could remember. Finally the\r\nsuspense grew unbearable. I rose impulsively, went hastily to the door\r\nthrough which he had passed and flung it open.\r\n\r\nThe room had been cleared of its junk and remodeled into a neat little\r\nlaboratory. Thornton stood at the far side of a table in the center of\r\nthe floor, pouring absinthe into a glass that was sitting perilously near\r\nthe edge. With the glass half full he placed the bottle on the table.\r\nIt tilted and rolled off; but he paid it no heed. Supporting himself\r\nwith one hand and raising the glass in the other, he seemed aware of my\r\npresence for the first time.\r\n\r\n“Frank,” he gasped huskily, “no one but you knows; and they will never\r\nguess.”\r\n\r\nI remembered in a flash, what he had said of his abandoned plan to poison\r\nLakeland, and realized; but before I could reach him he had drained the\r\nglass. It slipped from his fingers and shattered on the floor. He stood\r\nfor a moment, staring on past me into space.\r\n\r\nI grasped the edge of the table for support and felt the cold sweat start\r\non my brow and weakening limbs.\r\n\r\n“Green as hell!” he muttered; and flinging his arms across his fixed\r\neyes, crumpled to the floor; then stiffened, stark and dead.\r\n\r\nFor minutes I stood motionless, powerless to move.\r\n\r\nFinally, tossing a burning match into the spilt liquor, I answered his\r\nlast and only plea:\r\n\r\n“No, Thornt, they shall never know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Here’s Proof of the Love of the Weird and Mysterious in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury_\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSED CABINET\r\n\r\n_By_ ⸺ ⸺\r\n\r\n\r\n_I._\r\n\r\nIt was with a little alarm and a good deal of pleasurable excitement\r\nthat I looked forward to my first grown-up visit to Mervyn Grange. I\r\nhad been there several times as a child, but never since I was twelve\r\nyears old, and now I was over eighteen. We were all of us very proud\r\nof our cousins the Mervyns: it is not everybody that can claim kinship\r\nwith a family who are in full and admitted possession of a secret, a\r\ncurse, and a mysterious cabinet, in addition to the usual surplusage of\r\nhorrors supplied in such cases by popular imagination. Some declared that\r\na Mervyn of the days of Henry VIII had been cursed by an injured abbot\r\nfrom the foot of the gallows. Others affirmed that a dissipated Mervyn\r\nof the Georgian era was still playing cards for his soul in some remote\r\nregion of the Grange. There were stories of white ladies and black imps,\r\nof bloodstained passages and magic stones. We, proud of our more intimate\r\nacquaintance with the family, naturally gave no credence to these wild\r\ninventions. The Mervyns, indeed, followed the accepted precedent in such\r\ncases, and greatly disliked any reference to the reputed mystery being\r\nmade in their presence; with the inevitable result that there was no\r\nsubject so pertinaciously discussed by their friends in their absence.\r\nMy father’s sister had married the late Baronet, Sir Henry Mervyn, and\r\nwe always felt that she ought to have been the means of imparting to us\r\na very complete knowledge of the family secret. But in this connection\r\nshe undoubtedly failed of her duty. We knew that there had been a\r\nterrible tragedy in the family some two or three hundred years ago—that\r\na peculiarly wicked owner of Mervyn, who flourished in the latter part\r\nof the sixteenth century, had been murdered by his wife who subsequently\r\ncommitted suicide. We knew that the mysterious curse had some connection\r\nwith this crime, but what the curse exactly was we had never been able\r\nto discover. The history of the family since that time had indeed in\r\none sense been full of misfortune. Not in every sense. A coal mine had\r\nbeen discovered in one part of the estate, and a populous city had grown\r\nover the corner of another part; and the Mervyns of today, in spite of\r\nthe usual percentage of extravagant heirs and political mistakes, were\r\nthree times as rich as their ancestors had been. But still their story\r\nwas full of bloodshed and shame, of tales of duels and suicides, broken\r\nhearts and broken honor. Only these calamities seemed to have little\r\nor no relation to each other, and what the precise curse was that was\r\nsupposed to connect or account for them we could not learn. When she\r\nfirst married, my aunt was told nothing about it. Later on in life,\r\nwhen my father asked her for the story, she begged him to talk upon a\r\npleasanter subject; and being unluckily a man of much courtesy and little\r\ncuriosity, he complied with her request. This, however, was the only\r\npart of the ghostly traditions of her husband’s home upon which she was\r\nso reticent. The haunted chamber, for instance—which, of course, existed\r\nat the Grange—she treated with the greatest contempt. Various friends and\r\nrelations had slept in it at different times, and no approach to any kind\r\nof authenticated ghost-story, even of the most trivial description, had\r\nthey been able to supply. Its only claim to respect, indeed, was that it\r\ncontained the famous Mervyn cabinet, a fascinating puzzle of which I will\r\nspeak later, but which certainly had nothing haunting or horrible about\r\nits appearance.\r\n\r\nMy uncle’s family consisted of three sons. The eldest, George, the\r\npresent baronet, was now in his thirties, married, and with children of\r\nhis own. The second, Jack, was the black-sheep of the family. He had\r\nbeen in the Guards, but, about five years back, had got into some very\r\ndisgraceful scrape, and had been obliged to leave the country. The sorrow\r\nand the shame of this had killed his unhappy mother, and her husband had\r\nnot long afterwards followed her to the grave. Alan, the youngest son,\r\nprobably because he was the nearest to us in age, had been our special\r\nfavorite in earlier years. George was grown up before I had well left the\r\nnursery, and his hot, quick temper had always kept us youngsters somewhat\r\nin awe of him. Jack was four years older than Alan, and, besides, his\r\nprofession had, in a way, cut his boyhood short. When my uncle and aunt\r\nwere abroad, as they frequently were for months together on account of\r\nher health, it was Alan, chiefly, who had to spend his holidays with us,\r\nboth as school-boy and as undergraduate. And a brighter, sweeter-tempered\r\ncomrade, or one possessed of more diversified talents for the invention\r\nof games or the telling of stories, it would have been difficult to find.\r\n\r\nFor five years together now our ancient custom of an annual visit to\r\nMervyn had been broken. First there had been the seclusion of mourning\r\nfor my aunt, and a year later for my uncle; then George and his wife,\r\nLucy—she was a connection of our own on our mother’s side, and very\r\nintimate with us all—had been away for nearly two years on a voyage round\r\nthe world; and since then sickness in our own family had kept us in our\r\nturn a good deal abroad. So that I had not seen my cousins since all the\r\ncalamities which had befallen them in the interval, and as I steamed\r\nnorthwards I wondered a good deal as to the changes I should find. I\r\nwas to have come out that year in London, but ill-health had prevented\r\nme; and as a sort of consolation Lucy had kindly asked me to spend a\r\nfortnight at Mervyn, and be present at a shooting-party, which was to\r\nassemble there in the first week of October.\r\n\r\nI had started early, and there was still an hour of the short autumn\r\nday left when I descended at the little wayside station, from which a\r\nsix-mile drive brought me to the Grange. A dreary drive I found it—the\r\nround, gray, treeless outline of the fells stretching around me on every\r\nside beneath the leaden, changeless sky. The night had nearly fallen as\r\nwe drove along the narrow valley in which the Grange stood: it was too\r\ndark to see the autumn tints of the woods which clothed and brightened\r\nits sides, almost too dark to distinguish the old tower—Dame Alice’s\r\ntower as it was called—which stood some half mile farther on at its head.\r\nBut the light shown brightly from the Grange windows, and all feeling of\r\ndreariness departed as I drove up to the door. Leaving maid and boxes to\r\ntheir fate, I ran up the steps into the old, well remembered hall, and\r\nwas informed by the dignified man-servant that her ladyship and the tea\r\nwere awaiting me in the morning room.\r\n\r\nI found that there was nobody staying in the house except Alan, who\r\nwas finishing the long vacation there: he had been called to the bar a\r\ncouple of years before. The guests were not to arrive for another week,\r\nso that I had plenty of opportunity in the interval to make up for lost\r\ntime with my cousins. I began my observations that evening as we sat\r\ndown to dinner, a cozy party of four. Lucy was quite unchanged—pretty,\r\nfoolish, and gentle as ever. George showed the full five years’ increase\r\nof age, and seemed to have acquired a somewhat painful control of his\r\ntemper. Instead of the old petulant outbursts, there was at times an air\r\nof nervous, irritable self-restraint, which I found the less pleasant of\r\nthe two. But it was in Alan that the most striking alteration appeared.\r\nI felt it the moment I shook hands with him, and the impression deepened\r\nthat evening with every hour. I told myself that it was only the natural\r\ndifference between boy and man, between twenty and twenty-five, but I\r\ndon’t think that I believed it. Superficially the change was not great.\r\nThe slight-built, graceful figure; the deep gray eyes, too small for\r\nbeauty; the clear-cut features, the delicate, sensitive lips, close\r\nshaven now, as they had been hairless then—all were as I remembered\r\nthem. But the face was paler and thinner than it had been, and there\r\nwere lines round the eyes and at the corners of the mouth which were no\r\nmore natural to twenty-five than they would have been to twenty. The old\r\ncharm indeed—the sweet friendliness of manner, which was his own peculiar\r\npossession—was still there. He talked and laughed almost as much as\r\nformerly, but the talk was manufactured for our entertainment, and the\r\nlaughter came from his head and not from his heart. And it was when he\r\nwas taking no part in the conversation that the change showed most. Then\r\nthe face, on which in the old time every passing emotion had expressed\r\nitself in a constant, living current, became cold and impassive—without\r\ninterest, and without desire. It was at such times that I knew most\r\ncertainly that here was something which had been living and was dead.\r\nWas it only his boyhood? This question I was unable to answer.\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of all, that week was one of the happiest in my life. The\r\nbrothers were both men of enough ability and cultivation to be pleasant\r\ntalkers, and Lucy could perform adequately the part of conversational\r\naccompanist which, socially speaking, is all that is required of a woman.\r\nThe meals and evenings passed quickly and agreeably; the mornings I spent\r\nin unending gossips with Lucy, or in games with the children, two bright\r\nboys of five and six years old. But the afternoons were the best part\r\nof the day. George was a thorough squire in all his tastes and habits,\r\nand every afternoon his wife dutifully accompanied him round farms and\r\ncoverts, inspecting new buildings, trudging along half-made roads, or\r\nmarking unoffending trees for destruction. Then Alan and I would ride\r\nby the hour together over moor and meadowland, often picking our way\r\nhomewards down the glen-side long after the autumn evenings had closed\r\nin. During these rides I had glimpses many a time into depths in Alan’s\r\nnature of which I doubt whether in the old days he had himself been\r\naware. To me certainly they were as a revelation. A prevailing sadness,\r\noccasionally a painful tone of bitterness, characterized these more\r\nserious moods of his, but I do not think that, at the end of that week,\r\nI would, if I could, have changed the man, whom I was learning to revere\r\nand to pity, for the light-hearted playmate whom I felt was lost to me\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II._\r\n\r\nThe only feature of the family life which jarred on me was the attitude\r\nof the two brothers towards the children. I did not notice this much at\r\nfirst, and at all times it was a thing to be felt rather than to be seen.\r\nGeorge himself never seemed quite at ease with them. The boys were strong\r\nand well grown, healthy in mind and body; and one would have thought\r\nthat the existence of two such representatives to carry on his name and\r\ninherit his fortune would have been the very crown of pride and happiness\r\nto their father. But it was not so. Lucy indeed was devoted to them, and\r\nin all practical matters no one could have been kinder to them than was\r\nGeorge. They were free of the whole house, and every indulgence that\r\nmoney could buy for them they had. I never heard him give them a harsh\r\nword. But there was something wrong. A constraint in their presence, a\r\nrelief in their absence, an evident dislike of discussing them and their\r\naffairs, a total want of that enjoyment of love and possession which in\r\nsuch a case one might have expected to find. Alan’s state of mind was\r\neven more marked. Never did I hear him willingly address his nephews, or\r\nin any way allude to their existence. I should have said that he simply\r\nignored it, but for the heavy gloom which always overspread his spirits\r\nin their company, and for the glances which he would now and again cast\r\nin their direction—glances full of some hidden painful emotion, though of\r\nwhat nature it would have been hard to define. Indeed, Alan’s attitude\r\ntowards her children I soon found to be the only source of friction\r\nbetween Lucy and this otherwise much-loved member of her husband’s\r\nfamily. I asked her one day why the boys never appeared at luncheon.\r\n\r\n“Oh, they come when Alan is away,” she answered; “but they seem to annoy\r\nhim so much that George thinks it is better to keep them out of sight\r\nwhen he is here. It is very tiresome. I know that it is the fashion to\r\nsay that George has got the temper of the family; but I assure you that\r\nAlan’s nervous moods and fancies are much more difficult to live with.”\r\n\r\nThat was on the morning—a Friday it was—of the last day which we were to\r\nspend alone. The guests were to arrive soon after tea; and I think that\r\nwith the knowledge of their approach Alan and I prolonged our ride that\r\nafternoon beyond its usual limits. We were on our way home, and it was\r\nalready dusk, when a turn of the path brought us face to face with the\r\nold ruined tower, of which I have already spoken as standing at the head\r\nof the valley. I had not been close up to it yet during this visit at\r\nMervyn. It had been a very favorite haunt of ours as children, and partly\r\non that account, partly perhaps in order to defer the dreaded close of\r\nour ride to the last possible moment, I proposed an inspection of it. The\r\nonly portion of the old building left standing in any kind of entirety\r\nwas two rooms, one above the other. The tower room, level with the bottom\r\nof the moat, was dark and damp, and it was the upper one, reached by a\r\nlittle outside staircase, which had been our rendezvous of old. Alan\r\nshowed no disposition to enter, and said that he would stay outside and\r\nhold my horse, so I dismounted and ran up alone.\r\n\r\nThe room seemed in no way changed. A mere stone shell, littered with\r\nfragments of wood and mortar. There was the rough wooden block on which\r\nAlan used to sit while he first frightened us with bogey-stories, and\r\nthen calmed our excited nerves by rapid sallies of wild nonsense. There\r\nwas the plank from behind which, erected as a barrier across the doorway,\r\nhe would defend the castle against our united assault, pelting us with\r\nfir cones and sods of earth. This and many a bygone scene thronged on\r\nme as I stood there, and the room filled again with the memories of\r\nchildish mirth. And following close came those of childish terrors.\r\nHorrors which had oppressed me then, wholly imagined or dimly apprehended\r\nfrom half-heard traditions, and never thought of since, flitted around\r\nme in the gathering dusk. And with them it seemed to me as if there came\r\nother memories too,—memories which had never been my own, of scenes whose\r\nactors had long been with the dead, but which, immortal as the spirit\r\nbefore whose eyes they had dwelt, still lingered in the spot where their\r\nvictim had first learnt to shudder at their presence. Once the ghastly\r\nnotion came to me, it seized on my imagination with irresistible force.\r\nIt seemed as if from the darkened corners of the room vague, ill-defined\r\nshapes were actually peering out at me. When night came they would show\r\nthemselves in that form, livid and terrible, in which they had been burnt\r\ninto the brain and heart of the long ago dead.\r\n\r\nI turned and glanced towards where I had left Alan. I could see his\r\nfigure framed in by the window, a black shadow against the gray twilight\r\nof the sky behind. Erect and perfectly motionless he sat, so motionless\r\nas to look almost lifeless, gazing before him down the valley into the\r\nillimitable distance beyond. There was something in that stern immobility\r\nof look and attitude which struck me with a curious sense of congruity.\r\nIt was right that he should be thus—right that he should be no longer\r\nthe laughing boy who a moment before had been in my memory. The haunting\r\nhorrors of that place seemed to demand it, and for the first time I\r\nfelt that I understood the change. With an effort I shook myself free\r\nfrom these fancies, and turned to go. As I did so, my eye fell upon a\r\nqueer-shaped painted board, leaning up against the wall, which I well\r\nrecollected in old times. Many a discussion had we had about the legend\r\ninscribed upon it, which in our wisdom we had finally pronounced to be\r\nGerman, chiefly because it was illegible. Though I had loudly professed\r\nmy faith in this theory at the time, I had always had uneasy doubts on\r\nthe subject, and now half smiling I bent down to verify or remove them.\r\nThe language was English, not German; but the badly painted, faded Gothic\r\nletters in which it was written made the mistake excusable. In the dim\r\nlight I had difficulty even now in deciphering the words, and felt when\r\nI had done so that neither the information conveyed nor the style of the\r\ncomposition was sufficient reward for the trouble I had taken. This is\r\nwhat I read:\r\n\r\n    “Where the woman sinned the maid shall win;\r\n    But God help the maid that sleeps within.”\r\n\r\nWhat the lines could refer to I neither had any notion nor did I pause\r\nthen even in my own mind to inquire. I only remember vaguely wondering\r\nwhether they were intended for a tombstone or for a doorway. Then,\r\ncontinuing my way, I rapidly descended the steps and remounted my horse,\r\nglad to find myself once again in the open air and by my cousin’s side.\r\n\r\nThe train of thought into which he had sunk during my absence was\r\napparently an absorbing one, for to my first question as to the painted\r\nboard he could hardly rouse himself to answer.\r\n\r\n“A board with a legend written on it? Yes, he remembered something of the\r\nkind there. It had always been there, he thought. He knew nothing about\r\nit,”—and so the subject was not continued.\r\n\r\nThe weird feelings which had haunted me in the tower still oppressed me,\r\nand I proceeded to ask Alan about that old Dame Alice whom the traditions\r\nof my childhood represented as the last occupant of the ruined building.\r\nAlan roused himself now, but did not seem anxious to impart information\r\non the subject. She had lived there, he admitted, and no one had lived\r\nthere since. “Had she not,” I inquired, “something to do with the\r\nmysterious cabinet at the house? I remember hearing it spoken of as ‘Dame\r\nAlice’s cabinet.’”\r\n\r\n“So they say,” he assented; “she and an Italian artificer who was in her\r\nservice, and who, chiefly I imagine on account of his skill, shared with\r\nher the honor of reputed witchcraft.”\r\n\r\n“She was the mother of Hugh Mervyn, the man who was murdered by his wife,\r\nwas she not?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Alan, briefly.\r\n\r\n“And had she not something to do with the curse?” I inquired after a\r\nshort pause, and nervously I remembered my father’s experience on that\r\nsubject, and I had never before dared to allude to it in the presence\r\nof any member of the family. My nervousness was fully warranted. The\r\ngloom on Alan’s brow deepened, and after a very short “They say so” he\r\nturned full upon me, and inquired with some asperity why on earth I had\r\ndeveloped this sudden curiosity about his ancestress.\r\n\r\nI hesitated a moment, for I was a little ashamed of my fancies; but the\r\ndarkness gave me courage, and besides I was not afraid of telling Alan—he\r\nwould understand. I told him of the strange sensations I had had while\r\nin the tower—sensations which had struck me with all that force and\r\nclearness which we usually associate with a direct experience of fact.\r\n“Of course it was a trick of imagination,” I commented; “but I could not\r\nget rid of the feeling that the person who had dwelt there last must have\r\nhad terrible thoughts for the companions of her life.”\r\n\r\nAlan listened in silence, and the silence continued for some time after I\r\nhad ceased speaking.\r\n\r\n“It is strange,” he said at last; “instincts which we do not understand\r\nform the motive-power of most of our life’s actions, and yet we refuse to\r\nadmit them as evidence of any external truth. I suppose it is because we\r\n_must_ act somehow, rightly or wrongly; and there are a great many things\r\nwhich we need not believe unless we choose. As for this old lady, she\r\nlived long—long enough, like most of us, to do evil; unlike most of us,\r\nlong enough to witness some of the results of that evil. To say that, is\r\nto say that the last years of her life must have been weighted heavily\r\nenough with tragic thought.”\r\n\r\nI gave a little shudder of repulsion.\r\n\r\n“That is a depressing view of life, Alan,” I said. “Does our peace of\r\nmind depend only upon death coming early enough to hide from us the\r\ntruth? And, after all, can it? Our spirits do not die. From another world\r\nthey may witness the fruits of our lives in this one.”\r\n\r\n“If they do,” he answered with sudden violence, “it is absurd to doubt\r\nthe existence of a purgatory. There must in such a case be a terrible one\r\nin store for the best among us.”\r\n\r\nI was silent. The shadow that lay on his soul did not penetrate to mine,\r\nbut it hung round me nevertheless, a cloud which I felt powerless to\r\ndisperse.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he went on,—“Provided that they are distant enough, how\r\nlittle, after all, do we think of the results of our actions! There are\r\nfew men who would deliberately instill into a child a love of drink, or\r\nwilfully deprive him of his reason; and yet a man with drunkenness or\r\nmadness in his blood thinks nothing of bringing children into the world\r\ntainted us deeply with the curse as if he had inoculated them with it\r\ndirectly. There is no responsibility so completely ignored as this one of\r\nmarriage and fatherhood, and yet how heavy it is and far-reaching.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, smiling, “let us console ourselves with the thought that\r\nwe are not all lunatics and drunkards.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered; “but there are other evils besides these, moral taints\r\nas well as physical, curses which have their roots in worlds beyond our\r\nown,—sins of the fathers which are visited upon the children.”\r\n\r\nHe had lost all violence and bitterness of tone now; but the weary\r\ndejection which had taken their place communicated itself to my spirit\r\nwith more subtle power then his previous mood had owned.\r\n\r\n“That is why,” he went on, and his manner seemed to give more purpose to\r\nhis speech than hitherto,—“that is why, so far as I am concerned, I mean\r\nto shirk the responsibility and remain unmarried.”\r\n\r\nI was hardly surprised at his words. I felt that I had expected them, but\r\ntheir utterance seemed to intensify the gloom which rested upon us. Alan\r\nwas the first to arouse himself from its influence.\r\n\r\n“After all,” he said, turning round to me and speaking lightly, “without\r\nlooking so far and so deep, I think my resolve is a prudent one. Above\r\nall things, let us take life easily, and you know what St. Paul says\r\nabout ‘trouble in the flesh,’—a remark which I am sure is specially\r\napplicable to briefless barristers, even though possessed of a modest\r\ncompetence of their own. Perhaps one of these days, when I am a fat old\r\njudge, I shall give my cook a chance if she is satisfactory in her clear\r\nsoups; but till then I shall expect you, Evie, to work me one pair of\r\ncarpet-slippers per annum, as tribute due to a bachelor cousin.”\r\n\r\nI don’t quite know what I answered,—my heart was heavy and aching,—but I\r\ntried with true feminine docility to follow the lead he had set me. He\r\ncontinued for some time in the same vein; but as we approached the house\r\nthe effort seemed to become too much for him, and we relapsed again into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThis time I was the first to break it. “I suppose,” I said, drearily,\r\n“all those horrid people will have come by now.”\r\n\r\n“Horrid people,” he repeated, with rather an uncertain laugh, and through\r\nthe darkness I saw his figure bend forward as he stretched out his\r\nhand to caress my horse’s neck. “Why Evie, I thought you were pining\r\nfor gayety, and that it was, in fact, for the purpose of meeting these\r\n‘horrid people’ that you came here.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” I said, wistfully; “but somehow the last week has been so\r\npleasant that I cannot believe that anything will ever be quite so nice\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nWe had arrived at the house as I spoke, and the groom was standing at\r\nour horses’ heads. Alan got off and came round to help me to dismount;\r\nbut instead of putting up his arm as usual as a support for me to spring\r\nfrom, he laid his hand on mine. “Yes, Evie,” he said, “it has been indeed\r\na pleasant time. God bless you for it.” For an instant he stood there\r\nlooking up at me, his face full in the light which streamed from the open\r\ndoor, his gray eyes shining with a radiance which was not wholly from\r\nthence. Then he straightened his arm, I sprang to the ground, and as if\r\nto preclude the possibility of any answer on my part, he turned sharply\r\non his heel, and began giving some orders to the groom. I went on alone\r\ninto the house, feeling, I knew not and cared not to know why, that the\r\ngloom had fled from my spirit, and that the last ride had not after all\r\nbeen such a melancholy failure as it had bid fair at one time to become.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III._\r\n\r\nIn the hall I was met by the housekeeper, who informed me that, owing to\r\na misunderstanding about dates, a gentleman had arrived whom Lucy had not\r\nexpected at that time, and that in consequence my room had been changed.\r\nMy things had been put into the East Room,—the haunted room,—the room\r\nof the Closed Cabinet, as I remembered with a certain sense of pleased\r\nimportance, though without any surprise. It stood apart from the other\r\nguest-rooms, at the end of the passage from which opened George and\r\nLucy’s private apartment; and as it was consequently disagreeable to have\r\na stranger there, it was always used when the house was full for a member\r\nof the family. My father and mother had often slept there: there was a\r\nlittle room next to it, though not communicating with it, which served\r\nfor a dressing-room. Though I had never passed the night there myself, I\r\nknew it as well as any room in the house. I went there at once, and found\r\nLucy superintending the last arrangements for my comfort.\r\n\r\nShe was full of apologies for the trouble she was giving me. I told her\r\nthat the apologies were due to my maid and to her own servants rather\r\nthan to me; “and besides,” I added, glancing round, “I am distinctly a\r\ngainer by the change.”\r\n\r\n“You know, of course,” she said, lightly, “that this is the haunted room\r\nof the house, and that you have no right to be here?”\r\n\r\n“I know it is the haunted room,” I answered; “but why have I no right to\r\nbe here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know,” she said. “There is one of those tiresome Mervyn\r\ntraditions against allowing unmarried girls to sleep in this room. I\r\nbelieve two girls died in it a hundred and fifty years ago, or something\r\nof that sort.”\r\n\r\n“But I should think that people, married or unmarried, must have died in\r\nnearly every room in the house,” I objected.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, of course they have,” said Lucy; “but once you come across a\r\nbit of superstition in this family, it is of no use to ask for reasons.\r\nHowever, this particular bit is too ridiculous even for George. Owing to\r\nMr. Leslie having come to-day, we must use every room in the house: it is\r\nintolerable having a stranger here, and you are the only relation staying\r\nwith us. I pointed all that out to George, and he agreed that, under the\r\ncircumstances, it would be absurd not to put you here.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite agreeable,” I answered; “and, indeed, I think I am rather\r\nfavored in having a room where the last recorded death appears to have\r\ntaken place a hundred and fifty years ago, particularly as I should think\r\nthat there can be scarcely anything now left in it which was here then,\r\nexcept, of course, the cabinet.”\r\n\r\nThe room had, in fact, been entirely done up and refurnished by my uncle,\r\nand was as bright and modern-looking an apartment as you could wish to\r\nsee. It was large, and the walls were covered with one of those white and\r\ngold papers which were fashionable thirty years ago. Opposite us, as we\r\nstood warming our backs before the fire, was the bed—a large double one,\r\nhung with a pretty shade of pale blue. Material of the same color covered\r\nthe comfortable modern furniture, and hung from gilded cornices before\r\nthe two windows which pierced the side of the room on our left. Between\r\nthem stood the toilet-table, all muslin, blue ribbons, and silver. The\r\ncarpet was a gray and blue Brussels one. The whole effect was cheerful,\r\nthough I fear inartistic, and sadly out of keeping with the character\r\nof the house. The exception to these remarks was, as I had observed,\r\nthe famous closed cabinet, to which I have more than once alluded. It\r\nstood against the same wall of the room as that in which the fireplace\r\nwas, and on our right—that is, on that side of the fireplace which was\r\nfarthest from the windows. As I spoke, I turned to go and look at it\r\nand Lucy followed me. Many an hour as a child had I passed in front of\r\nit, fingering the seven carved brass handles, or rather buttons, which\r\nwere ranged down its center. They all slid, twisted, or screwed with the\r\ngreatest ease, and apparently like many another ingeniously contrived\r\nlock; but neither I nor any one else had ever yet succeeded in sliding,\r\ntwisting, or screwing them after such a fashion as to open the closed\r\ndoors of the cabinet. No one yet had robbed them of their secret since\r\nfirst it was placed there three hundred years ago by the old lady and\r\nher faithful Italian. It was a beautiful piece of workmanship, was this\r\ntantalizing cabinet. Carved out of some dark foreign wood, the doors and\r\npanels were richly inlaid with lapis-lazuli, ivory, and mother-of-pearl,\r\namong which were twisted delicately chased threads of gold and silver.\r\nAbove the doors, between them and the cornice, lay another mystery, fully\r\nas tormenting as was the first. In a smooth strip of wood about an inch\r\nwide, and extending along the whole breadth of the cabinet, was inlaid\r\na fine pattern in gold wire. This at first sight seemed to consist of a\r\nlegend or motto. On looking closer, however, though the pattern still\r\nlooked as if it was formed out of characters of the alphabet curiously\r\nentwined together, you found yourself unable to fix upon any definite\r\nword, or even letter. You looked again and again, and the longer that you\r\nlooked the more certain became your belief that you were on the verge of\r\ndiscovery. If you could approach the mysterious legend from a slightly\r\ndifferent point of view, or look at it from another distance, the clew\r\nto the puzzle would be seized, and the words would stand forth clear and\r\nlegible in your sight. But the clew never had been discovered, and the\r\nmotto, if there was one, remained unread.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes we stood looking at the cabinet in silence, and then\r\nLucy gave a discontented little sigh. “There’s another tiresome piece of\r\nsuperstition,” she exclaimed; “by far the handsomest piece of furniture\r\nin the house stuck away here in a bedroom which is hardly ever used.\r\nAgain and again have I asked George to let me have it moved downstairs,\r\nbut he won’t hear of it.”\r\n\r\n“Was it not placed here by Dame Alice herself?” I inquired a little\r\nreproachfully, for I felt that Lucy was not treating the cabinet with the\r\nrespect which it really deserved.\r\n\r\n“Yes, so they say,” she answered; and the tone of light contempt in\r\nwhich she spoke was now pierced by a not unnatural pride in the romantic\r\nmysteries of her husband’s family. “She placed it here, and it is said,\r\nyou know, that when the closed cabinet is opened, and the mysterious\r\nmotto is read, the curse will depart from the Mervyn family.”\r\n\r\n“But why don’t they break it open?” I asked, impatiently. “I am sure that\r\nI would never have remained all my life in a house with a thing like\r\nthat, and not found out in some way or another what was inside it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but that would be quite fatal,” answered she. “The curse can only be\r\nremoved when the cabinet is opened as Dame Alice intended it to be, in an\r\northodox fashion. If you were to force it open, that could never happen,\r\nand the curse would therefore remain forever.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the curse?” I asked, with very different feelings to those\r\nwith which I had timidly approached the same subject with Alan. Lucy was\r\nnot a Mervyn, and not a person to inspire awe under any circumstances. My\r\ninstincts were right again, for she turned away with a slight shrug of\r\nher shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I have no idea,” she said. “George and Alan always look portentously\r\nsolemn and gloomy whenever one mentions the subject, so I don’t. If you\r\nask me for the truth, I believe it to be a pure invention, devised by\r\nthe Mervyns for the purpose of delicately accounting for some of the\r\ndisreputable actions of their ancestors. For you know, Evie,” she added,\r\nwith a little laugh, “the less said about the character of the family\r\ninto which your aunt and I have married the better.”\r\n\r\nThe remark made me angry, I don’t know why, and I answered stiffly, that\r\nas far as I was acquainted with them, I at least saw nothing to complain\r\nof.\r\n\r\n“Oh, as regards the present generation, no,—except for that poor,\r\nwretched Jack,” acquiesced Lucy, with her usual imperturbable good-humor.\r\n\r\n“And as regards the next?” I suggested, smiling, and already ashamed of\r\nmy little temper.\r\n\r\n“The next is perfect, of course,—poor dear boys.” She sighed as she\r\nspoke, and I wondered whether she was really as unconscious as she\r\ngenerally appeared to be of the strange dissatisfaction with which her\r\nhusband seemed to regard his children. Anyhow the mention of them had\r\nevidently changed her mood, and almost directly afterwards, with the\r\nremark that she must go and look after her guests, who had all arrived by\r\nnow, she left me to myself.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes I sat by the bright fire, lost in aimless, wandering\r\nthought, which began with Dame Alice and her cabinet, and which ended\r\nsomehow with Alan’s face, as I had last seen it looking up at me in\r\nfront of the hall-door. When I had reached that point, I roused myself\r\nto decide that I had dreamt long enough, and that it was quite time to\r\ngo down to the guests and to tea. I accordingly donned my best teagown,\r\narranged my hair, and proceeded towards the drawing-room. My way there\r\nlay through the great central hall. This apartment was approached from\r\nmost of the bedrooms in the house through a large, arched doorway at\r\none end of it, which communicated directly with the great staircase. My\r\nbedroom, however, which, as I have said, lay among the private apartments\r\nof the house, opened into a passage which led into a broad gallery,\r\nor upper chamber, stretching right across the end of the hall. From\r\nthis you descended by means of a small staircase in oak, whose carved\r\nbalustrade, bending round the corner of the hall, formed one of the\r\nprettiest features of the picturesque old room. The barrier which ran\r\nalong the front of the gallery was in solid oak, and of such a height\r\nthat, unless standing close up to it, you could neither see nor be seen\r\nby the occupants of the room below. On approaching this gallery I heard\r\nvoices in the hall. They were George’s and Alan’s, evidently in hot\r\ndiscussion. As I issued from the passage, George was speaking, and his\r\nvoice had that exasperated tone in which an angry man tries to bring to\r\na close an argument in which he has lost his temper. “For heaven’s sake\r\nleave it alone, Alan; I neither can nor will interfere. We have enough\r\nto bear from these cursed traditions as it is, without adding one which\r\nhas no foundation whatever to justify it—a mere contemptible piece of\r\nsuperstition.”\r\n\r\n“No member of our family has a right to call any tradition contemptible\r\nwhich is connected with that place, and you know it,” answered Alan; and\r\nthough he spoke low, his voice trembled with some strong emotion. A first\r\nimpulse of hesitation which I had had I checked, feeling that as I had\r\nheard so much it was fairer to go on, and I advanced to the top of the\r\nstaircase. Alan stood by the fireplace facing me, but far too occupied\r\nto see me. His last speech had seemingly aroused George to fury, for the\r\nlatter turned on him now with savage passion.\r\n\r\n“Damn it all, Alan!” he cried, “can’t you be quiet? I will be master in\r\nmy own house. Take care, I tell you; the curse may not be quite fulfilled\r\nyet after all.”\r\n\r\nAs George uttered these words, Alan lifted his eyes to him with a glance\r\nof awful horror: his face turned ghastly white; his lips trembled for a\r\nmoment; and then he answered back with one half-whispered word of supreme\r\nappeal—“George!” There was a long-drawn, unutterable anguish in his tone,\r\nand his voice, though scarcely audible, penetrated to every corner of the\r\nroom, and seemed to hang quivering in the air around one after the sound\r\nhad ceased. Then there was a terrible stillness. Alan stood trembling in\r\nevery limb, incapable apparently of speech or action, and George faced\r\nhim, as silent and motionless as he was. For an instant they remained\r\nthus, while I looked breathlessly on. Then George, with a muttered\r\nimprecation, turned on his heel and left the room. Alan followed him\r\nas he went with dull lifeless eyes; and as the door closed he breathed\r\ndeeply, with a breath that was almost a groan.\r\n\r\nTaking my courage in both hands, I now descended the stairs, and at the\r\nsound of my footfall he glanced up, startled, and then came rapidly to\r\nmeet me.\r\n\r\n“Evie! you here,” he said; “I did not notice you. How long have you been\r\nhere?” He was still quite white, and I noticed that he panted for breath\r\nas he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Not long,” I answered, timidly, and rather spasmodically; “I only heard\r\na sentence or two. You wanted George to do something about some tradition\r\nor other,—and he was angry,—and he said something about the curse.”\r\n\r\nWhile I spoke Alan kept his eyes fixed on mine, reading through them,\r\nas I knew, into my mind. When I had finished he turned his gaze away\r\nsatisfied, and answered very quietly, “Yes, that was it.” Then he went\r\nback to the fireplace, rested his arm against the high mantelpiece above\r\nit, and leaning his forehead on his arm, remained silently looking into\r\nthe fire. I could see by his bent brow and compressed lips that he was\r\nengaged upon some earnest train of thought or reasoning, and I stood\r\nwaiting—worried, puzzled, curious but above all things, pitiful, and oh!\r\nlonging so intensely to help him if I could. Presently he straightened\r\nhimself a little, and addressed me more in his ordinary tone of voice,\r\nthough without looking round. “So I hear they have changed your room.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered. And then, flushing rather, “Is that what you and\r\nGeorge have been quarreling about?” I received no reply, and taking this\r\nsilence for assent, I went on deprecatingly, “Because you know, if it\r\nwas, I think you are rather foolish, Alan. As I understand, two girls are\r\nsaid to have died in that room more than a hundred years ago, and for\r\nthat reason there is a prejudice against putting a girl to sleep there.\r\nThat is all. Merely a vague, unreasonable tradition.”\r\n\r\nAlan took a moment to answer.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said at length, speaking slowly, and as if replying to\r\narguments in his own mind as much as to those which I had uttered. “Yes,\r\nit is nothing but a tradition after all, and that of the very vaguest and\r\nmost unsupported kind.”\r\n\r\n“Is there even any proof that girls have not slept there since those two\r\ndied?” I asked. I think that the suggestion conveyed in this question was\r\na relief to him, for after a moment’s pause, as if to search his memory,\r\nhe turned round.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered, “I don’t think that there is any such proof; and I\r\nhave no doubt that you are right, and that it is a mere prejudice that\r\nmakes me dislike your sleeping there.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” I said, with a little assumption of sisterly superiority, “I\r\nthink George was right, and that you were wrong.”\r\n\r\nAlan smiled,—a smile which sat oddly on the still pale face, and in the\r\nwearied, worn-looking eyes. “Very likely,” he said; “I daresay that I\r\nam superstitious. I have had things to make me so.” Then coming nearer\r\nto me, and laying his hands on my shoulders, he went on, smiling more\r\nbrightly, “We are a queer-tempered, bad-nerved race, we Mervyns, and you\r\nmust not take us too seriously, Evie. The best thing that you can do with\r\nour odd ways is to ignore them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t mind,” I answered, laughing, too glad to have won him back\r\nto even temporary brightness, “as long as you and George don’t come\r\nto blows over the question of where I am to sleep; which after all is\r\nchiefly my concern,—and Lucy’s.”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps it is,” he replied, in the same tone; “and now be off to\r\nthe drawing-room, where Lucy is defending the tea-table single-handed all\r\nthis time.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and should have gone more cheerfully had I not turned at the\r\ndoorway to look back at him, and caught one glimpse of his face as he\r\nsank heavily down into the large arm-chair by the fireside.\r\n\r\nHowever, by dinner-time he appeared to have dismissed all painful\r\nreflections from his mind, or to have buried them too deep for discovery.\r\nThe people staying in the house were, in spite of my sense of grievance\r\nat their arrival, individually pleasant, and after dinner I discovered\r\nthem to be socially well assorted. For the first hour or two, indeed,\r\nafter their arrival, each glared at the other across those triple\r\nlines of moral fortification behind which every well-bred Briton takes\r\nrefuge on appearing at a friend’s country-house. But flags of truce\r\nwere interchanged over the soup, an armistice was agreed upon during\r\nthe roast, and the terms of a treaty of peace and amity were finally\r\nratified under the sympathetic influence of George’s best champagne. For\r\nthe achievement of this happy result Alan certainly worked hard, and\r\nreceived therefor many a grateful glance from his sister-in-law. He was\r\nmore excited than I had ever seen him before, and talked brilliantly\r\nand well—though perhaps not as exclusively to his neighbors as they may\r\nhave wished. His eyes and his attention seemed everywhere at once: one\r\nmoment he was throwing remarks across to some despairing couple opposite,\r\nand the next he was breaking an embarrassing pause in the conversation\r\nby some rapid sally of nonsense addressed to the table in general. He\r\nformed a great contrast to his brother, who sat gloomy and dejected,\r\nmaking little or no response to the advances of the two dowagers between\r\nwhom he was placed. After dinner the younger members of the party spent\r\nthe evening by Alan’s initiative, and chiefly under his direction, in a\r\nseries of lively and rather riotous games such as my nursery days had\r\ndelighted in, and my schoolroom ones had disdained. It was a great and\r\nhappy surprise to discover that, grown up, I might again enjoy them. I\r\ndid so, hugely, and when bedtime came all memories more serious than\r\nthose of “musical chairs” or “follow my leader” had vanished from my\r\nmind. I think, from Alan’s glance as he handed me my bed candle, that the\r\npleasure and excitement must have improved my looks.\r\n\r\n“I hope you have enjoyed your first evening of gayety, Evie,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I have,” I answered, with happy conviction; “and really I believe that\r\nit is chiefly owing to you, Alan.” He met my smile by another; but I\r\nthink that there must have been something in his look which recalled\r\nother thoughts, for as I started up the stairs I threw a mischievous\r\nglance back at him and whispered, “Now for the horrors of the haunted\r\nchamber.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed rather loudly, and saying “Good-night, and good-luck,” turned\r\nto attend to the other ladies.\r\n\r\nHis wishes were certainly fulfilled. I got to bed quickly, and—as soon\r\nas my happy excitement was sufficiently calmed to admit of it—to sleep.\r\nThe only thing which disturbed me was the wind, which blew fiercely and\r\nloudly all the earlier portion of the night, half arousing me more than\r\nonce. I spoke of it at breakfast the next morning; but the rest of the\r\nworld seemed to have slept too heavily to have been aware of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV._\r\n\r\nThe men went out shooting directly after breakfast, and we women passed\r\nthe day in orthodox country-house fashion,—working and eating; walking\r\nand riding; driving and playing croquet; and above, beyond, and through\r\nall things, chattering. Beyond a passing sigh while I was washing my\r\nhands, or a moment of mournful remembrance while I changed my dress, I\r\nhad scarcely time even to regret the quiet happiness of the week that\r\nwas past. In the evening we danced in the great hall. I had two valses\r\nwith Alan. During a pause for breath, I found that we were standing\r\nnear the fireplace, on the very spot where he and George had stood on\r\nthe previous afternoon. The recollection made me involuntarily glance\r\nup at his face. It looked sad and worried, and the thought suddenly\r\nstruck me that his extravagant spirits of the night before, and even his\r\nquieter, careful cheerfulness of to-night, had been but artificial moods\r\nat best. He turned, and finding my eyes fixed on him, at once plunged\r\ninto conversation, discussed the peculiarities of one of the guests,\r\ngood-humoredly enough, but with so much fun as to make me laugh in spite\r\nof myself. Then we danced again. The plaintive music, the smooth floor,\r\nand the partner were all alike perfect, and I experienced that entire\r\ndelight of physical enjoyment which I believe nothing but a valse under\r\nsuch circumstances can give. When it was over I turned to Alan, and\r\nexclaimed with impulsive appeal, “Oh, I am so happy,—you must be happy\r\ntoo!” He smiled rather uncertainly, and answered, “Don’t bother yourself\r\nabout me, Evie, I am all right. I told you that we Mervyns had bad\r\nnerves; and I am rather tired. That’s all.” I was passionately determined\r\njust then upon happiness, and his was too necessary to mine for me not to\r\nbelieve that he was speaking the truth.\r\n\r\nWe kept up the dancing till Lucy discovered with a shock that midnight\r\nhad struck, and that Sunday had begun, and we were all sent off to bed. I\r\nwas not long in making my nightly preparations, and had scarcely inserted\r\nmyself between the sheets when, with a few long moans, the wind began\r\nagain, more violently even than the night before. It had been a calm,\r\nfine day, and I made wise reflections as I listened upon the uncertainty\r\nof the north-country climate. What a tempest it was! How it moaned, and\r\nhowled, and shrieked! Where had I heard the superstition which now came\r\nto my mind, that borne upon the wind come the spirits of the drowned,\r\nwailing and crying for the sepulture which had been denied them? But\r\nthere were other sounds in that wind, too. Evil, murderous thoughts,\r\nperhaps, which had never taken body in deeds, but which, caught up in\r\nthe air, now hurled themselves in impotent fury through the world. How I\r\nwished the wind would stop. It seemed full of horrible fancies, and it\r\nkept knocking them into my head, and it wouldn’t leave off. Fancies, or\r\nmemories—which?—and my mind reverted with a flash to the fearful thoughts\r\nwhich had haunted it the day before in Dame Alice’s tower. It was dark\r\nnow. Those ghastly intangible shapes must have taken full form and color,\r\npeopling the old ruin with their ageless hideousness. And the storm had\r\nfound them there and borne them along with it as it blew through the\r\ncreviced walls. That was why the wind’s sound struck so strangely on my\r\nbrain. Ah! I could hear them now, those still living memories of dead\r\nhorror. Through the window crannies they came shrieking and wailing.\r\nThey filled the chimney with spirit sobs, and now they were pressing on,\r\ncrowding through the room,—eager, eager to reach their prey. Nearer they\r\ncame;—nearer still! They were round my bed now! Through my closed eyelids\r\nI could almost see their dreadful shapes; in all my quivering flesh I\r\nfelt their terrors as they bent over me,—lower, lower....\r\n\r\nWith a start I aroused myself and sat up. Was I asleep or awake? I was\r\ntrembling all over still, and it required the greatest effort of courage\r\nI had ever made to enable me to spring from my bed and strike a light.\r\nWhat a state my nerves or my digestion must be in! From my childhood\r\nthe wind had always affected me strangely, and I blamed myself now for\r\nallowing my imagination to run away with me at the first. I found a\r\nnovel which I had brought up to my room with me, one of the modern,\r\nChinese-American school, where human nature is analyzed with the patient,\r\nindustrious indifference of the true Celestial. I took the book to bed\r\nwith me, and soon under its soothing influences fell asleep. I dreamt a\r\ngood deal,—nightmares, the definite recollection of which, as is so often\r\nthe case, vanished from my mind as soon as I awoke, leaving only a vague\r\nimpression of horror. They had been connected with the wind, of that\r\nalone I was conscious, and I went down to breakfast, maliciously hoping\r\nthat others’ rest had been as much disturbed as my own.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, however, I found that I had again been the only sufferer.\r\nIndeed, so impressed were most of the party with the quiet in which\r\ntheir night had been passed, that they boldly declared my storm to have\r\nbeen the creature of my dreams. There is nothing more annoying when\r\nyou feel yourself aggrieved by fate than to be told that your troubles\r\nhave originated in your own fancy; so I dropped the subject. Though the\r\ndiscussion spread for a few minutes round the whole table, Alan took\r\nno part in it. Neither did George, except for what I thought a rather\r\nunnecessarily rough expression of his disbelief in the cause of my\r\nnight’s disturbance. As we rose from breakfast I saw Alan glance towards\r\nhis brother, and make a movement, evidently with the purpose of speaking\r\nto him. Whether or not George was aware of the look or action, I cannot\r\nsay; but at the same moment he made rapidly across the room to where\r\none of his principal guests was standing, and at once engaged him in\r\nconversation. So earnestly and so volubly was he borne on, that they were\r\nstill talking together when we ladies appeared again some minutes later,\r\nprepared for our walk to church. That was not the only occasion during\r\nthe day on which I witnessed as I thought the same by-play going on.\r\nAgain and again Alan appeared to be making efforts to engage George in\r\nprivate conversation, and again and again the latter successfully eluded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe church was about a mile away from the house, and as Lucy did not\r\nlike having the carriages out on a Sunday, one service a week as a rule\r\ncontented the household. In the afternoon we took the usual Sunday walk.\r\nOn returning from it, I had just taken off my outdoor things, and was\r\nissuing from my bedroom, when I found myself face to face with Alan.\r\nHe was coming out of George’s study, and had succeeded apparently in\r\nobtaining that interview for which he had been all day seeking. One\r\nglance at his face told me what its nature had been. We paused opposite\r\neach other for a moment, and he looked at me earnestly.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to church?” he inquired at last, abruptly.\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered, with some surprise. “I did not know that any one was\r\ngoing this evening.”\r\n\r\n“Will you come with me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly; if you don’t mind waiting a moment for me to put my\r\nthings on.”\r\n\r\n“There’s plenty of time,” he answered; “meet me in the hall.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we started.\r\n\r\nIt was a calm, cloudless night, and although the moon was not yet\r\nhalf-full, and already past her meridian, she filled the clear air with\r\ngentle light. Not a word broke our silence. Alan walked hurriedly,\r\nlooking straight before him, his head upright, his lips twitching\r\nnervously, while every now and then a half-uttered moan escaped\r\nunconsciously from between them. At last I could bear it no longer, and\r\nburst forth with the first remark which occurred to me. We were passing\r\na big black, queer-shaped stone standing in rather a lonely uncultivated\r\nspot at one end of the garden. It was an old acquaintance of my\r\nchildhood; but my thoughts had been turned towards it now from the fact\r\nthat I could see it from my bedroom window, and had been struck afresh by\r\nits uncouth, incongruous appearance.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there some story connected with that stone?” I asked. “I remember\r\nthat we always called it the Dead Stone as children.”\r\n\r\nAlan cast a quick, sidelong glance in that direction, and his brows\r\ncontracted in an irritable frown. “I don’t know,” he answered shortly;\r\n“they say that there is a woman buried beneath it, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“A woman buried there!” I exclaimed in surprise; “but who?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know? They know nothing whatever about it. The place is\r\nfull of stupid traditions of that kind.” Then, looking suspiciously round\r\nat me, “Why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; it was just something to say,” I answered plaintively. His\r\nstrange mood so worked upon my nerves, that it was all that I could do\r\nto restrain my tears. I think that my tone struck his conscience, for he\r\nmade a few feverish attempts at conversation after that. But they were so\r\nentirely abortive that he soon abandoned the effort, and we finished our\r\nwalk to church as speechlessly as we had begun it.\r\n\r\nThe service was bright, and the sermon perhaps a little commonplace,\r\nbut sensible as it seemed to me in matter, and adequate in style. The\r\npeaceful evening hymn which followed, the short solemn pause of silence\r\nprayer at the end, soothed and refreshed my spirit. A hasty glance at\r\nmy companion’s face as he stood waiting for me in the porch, with the\r\nfull light from the church streaming round him, assured me that the same\r\ninfluence had touched him too. Haggard and sad he still looked, it is\r\ntrue; but his features were composed, and the expression of actual pain\r\nhad left his eyes.\r\n\r\nSilent as we had come we started homeward through the waning moonlight,\r\nbut this silence was of a very different nature to the other, and after a\r\nminute or two I did not hesitate to break it.\r\n\r\n“It was a good sermon?” I observed interrogatively.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he assented, “I suppose you would call it so; but I confess that I\r\nshould have found the text more impressive without its exposition.”\r\n\r\n“Poor man!”\r\n\r\n“But don’t you often find it so?” he asked. “Do you not often wish, to\r\ntake this evening’s instance, that clergymen would infuse themselves\r\nwith something of St. Paul’s own spirit? Then perhaps they would not\r\nwater all the strength out of his words in their efforts to explain them.”\r\n\r\n“That is rather a large demand to make upon them, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Is it?” he questioned. “I don’t ask them to be inspired saints. I don’t\r\nexpect St. Paul’s breadth and depth of thought. But could they not have\r\nsomething of his vigorous completeness, something of the intensity of his\r\nfeeling and belief? Look at the text of to-night. Did not the preacher’s\r\nexamples and applications take something from its awful unqualified\r\nstrength?”\r\n\r\n“Awful!” I exclaimed, in surprise; “that is hardly the expression I\r\nshould have used in connection with those words.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. The text is very beautiful, of course, and at times,\r\nwhen people are tiresome and one ought to be nice to them, it is very\r\ndifficult to act up to. But——”\r\n\r\n“But you think that ‘awful’ is rather a big adjective to use for so small\r\na duty,” interposed Alan, and the moonlight showed the flicker of a smile\r\nupon his face. Then he continued, gravely, “I doubt whether you yourself\r\nrealize the full import of the words. The precept of charity is not\r\nmerely a code of rules by which to order our conduct to our neighbors;\r\nit is the picture of a spiritual condition, and such, where it exists\r\nin us, must by its very nature be roused into activity by anything that\r\naffects us. So with this particular injunction, every circumstance in our\r\nlives is a challenge to it, and in presence of all alike it admits of one\r\nattitude only: ‘Beareth all things, endureth all things.’ I hope it will\r\nbe long before that ‘all’ sticks in your gizzard, Evie,—before you come\r\nface to face with things which nature cannot bear, and yet which must be\r\nborne.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, his voice quivering; and then after a pause went on again\r\nmore calmly, “And throughout it is the same. Moral precepts everywhere,\r\nwhich will admit of no compromise, no limitation, and yet which are\r\nat war with our strongest passions. If one could only interpose some\r\n‘unless,’ some ‘except,’ even an ‘until,’ which should be short of the\r\ngrave. But we cannot. The law is infinite, universal, eternal; there is\r\nno escape, no repose. Resist, strive, endure, that is the recurring cry;\r\nthat is existence.”\r\n\r\n“And peace,” I exclaimed, appealingly. “Where is there room for peace, if\r\nthat be true?”\r\n\r\nHe sighed for answer, and then in a changed and lower tone added,\r\n“However thickly the clouds mass, however vainly we search for a\r\ncoming glimmer in their midst, we never doubt that the sky is still\r\nbeyond—beyond and around us, infinite and infinitely restful.”\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes as he spoke, and mine followed his. We had entered\r\nthe wooded glen. Through the scanty autumn foliage we could see the\r\nstars shining faintly in the dim moonlight, and beyond them the deep\r\nillimitable blue. A dark world it looked, distant and mysterious, and my\r\nyoung spirit rebelled at the consolation offered me.\r\n\r\n“Peace seems a long way off,” I whispered.\r\n\r\n“It is for me,” he answered, gently; “not necessarily for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I am worse and weaker than you are. If life is to be all\r\nwarfare, I must be beaten. I cannot always be fighting.”\r\n\r\n“Cannot you? Evie, what I have been saying is true of every moral law\r\nworth having, of every ideal of life worth striving after, that men have\r\nyet conceived. But it is only half the truth of Christianity. You know\r\nthat. We must strive, for the promise is to him that overcometh; but\r\nthough our aim be even higher than is that of others, we cannot in the\r\nend fail to reach it. The victory of the Cross is ours. You know that?\r\nYou believe that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, softly, too surprised to say more. In speaking\r\nof religion he, as a rule, showed to the full the reserve which is\r\ncharacteristic of his class and country, and this sudden outburst was in\r\nitself astonishing; but the eager anxiety with which he emphasized the\r\nlast words of appeal impressed and bewildered me still further. We walked\r\non for some minutes in silence. Then suddenly Alan stopped, and turning,\r\ntook my hand in his. In what direction his mind had been working in the\r\ninterval I could not divine; but the moment he began to speak I felt that\r\nhe was now for the first time giving utterance to what had been really\r\nat the bottom of his thoughts the whole evening. Even in that dim light\r\nI could see the anxious look upon his face, and his voice shook with\r\nrestrained emotion.\r\n\r\n“Evie,” he said, “have you ever thought of the world in which our spirits\r\ndwell, as our bodies do in this one of matter and sense, and of how it\r\nmay be peopled? I know,” he went on hurriedly, “that it is the fashion\r\nnowadays to laugh at such ideas. I envy those who have never had cause to\r\nbe convinced of their reality, and I hope that you may long remain among\r\nthe number. But should that not be so, should those unseen influences\r\never touch your life, I want you to remember then, that, as one of the\r\nrace for whom Christ died, you have as high a citizenship in that spirit\r\nland as any creature there: that you are your own soul’s warden, and that\r\nneither principalities nor powers can rob you of that your birthright.”\r\n\r\nI think my face must have shown my bewilderment, for he dropped my hand,\r\nand walked on with an impatient sigh.\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand me. Why should you? I daresay that I am talking\r\nnonsense—only—only——”\r\n\r\nHis voice expressed such an agony of doubt and hesitation that I burst\r\nout—\r\n\r\n“I think that I do understand you a little, Alan. You mean that even from\r\nunearthly enemies there is nothing that we need really fear—at least,\r\nthat is, I suppose, nothing worse than death. But that is surely enough!”\r\n\r\n“Why should you fear death?” he said, abruptly; “your soul will live.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know that, but still——” I stopped with a shudder.\r\n\r\n“What is life after all but one long death?” he went on, with sudden\r\nviolence. “Our pleasures, our hopes, our youth are all dying; ambition\r\ndies, and even desire at last; our passions and tastes will die, or will\r\nlive only to mourn their dead opportunity. The happiness of love dies\r\nwith the loss of the loved, and, worst of all, love itself grows old in\r\nour hearts and dies. Why should we shrink only from the one death which\r\ncan free us from all the others?”\r\n\r\n“It is not true, Alan!” I cried, hotly. “What you say is not true. There\r\nare many things even here which are living and shall live; and if it were\r\notherwise, in everything, life that ends in death is better than no life\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\n“You say that,” he answered, “because for you these things are yet\r\nliving. To leave life now, therefore, while it is full and sweet,\r\nuntainted by death, surely that is not a fate to fear. Better, a thousand\r\ntimes better, to see the cord cut with one blow while it is still whole\r\nand strong, and to launch out straight into the great ocean, than to\r\nsit watching through the slow years, while strand after strand, thread\r\nby thread, loosens and unwinds itself—each with its own separate pang\r\nbreaking, bringing the bitterness of death without its release.”\r\n\r\nHis manner, the despairing ring in his voice, alarmed me even more than\r\nhis words. Clinging to his arm with both hands, while the tears sprang to\r\nmy eyes—\r\n\r\n“Alan,” I cried, “don’t say such things,—don’t talk like that. You are\r\nmaking me miserable.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped short at my words, with bent head, his features hidden in the\r\nshadow thus cast upon them,—nothing in his motionless form to show what\r\nwas passing within him. Then he looked up, and turned his face to the\r\nmoonlight and to me, laying his hand on one of mine.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid,” he said; “it is all right, my little David. You have\r\ndriven the evil spirit away.” And lifting my hand, he pressed it gently\r\nto his lips. Then drawing it within his arms, he went on, as he walked\r\nforward, “And even when it was on me at its worst, I was not meditating\r\nsuicide, as I think you imagine. I am a very average specimen of\r\nhumanity,—neither brave enough to defy the possibilities of eternity nor\r\ncowardly enough to shirk those of time. No, I was only trying idiotically\r\nto persuade a girl of eighteen that life was not worth living; and more\r\nfutilely still, myself, that I did not wish her to live. I am afraid that\r\nin my mind philosophy and fact have but small connection with each other;\r\nand though my theorizing for your welfare may be true enough, yet,—I\r\ncannot help it, Evie,—it would go terribly hard with me if anything were\r\nto happen to you.”\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled as he finished. My fear had gone with his return to\r\nhis natural manner, but my bewilderment remained.\r\n\r\n“Why _should_ there anything happen to me?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“That is just it,” he answered, after a pause, looking straight in front\r\nof him and drawing his hand wearily over his brow. “I know of no reason\r\nwhy there should.” Then giving a sigh, as if finally to dismiss from his\r\nmind a worrying subject—“I have acted for the best,” he said, “and may\r\nGod forgive me if I have done wrong.”\r\n\r\nThere was a little silence after that, and then he began to talk again,\r\nsteadily and quietly. The subject was deep enough still, as deep as\r\nany that we had touched upon, but both voice and sentiment were calm,\r\nbringing peace to my spirit, and soon making me forget the wonder and\r\nfear of a few moments before. Very openly did he talk as we passed on\r\nacross the long trunk shadows and through the glades of silver light; and\r\nI saw farther then into the most sacred recesses of his soul than I have\r\never done before or since.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached home the moon had already set; but some of her beams\r\nseemed to have been left behind within my heart, so pure and peaceful was\r\nthe light which filled it.\r\n\r\nThe same feeling continued with me all through that evening. After\r\ndinner some of the party played and sang. As it was Sunday, and Lucy was\r\nrigid in her views, the music was of a sacred character. I sat in a low\r\narm-chair in a dark corner of the room, my mind too dreamy to think, and\r\ntoo passive to dream. I hardly interchanged three words with Alan, who\r\nremained in a still darker spot, invisible and silent the whole time.\r\nOnly as we left the room to go to bed, I heard Lucy ask him if he had a\r\nheadache. I did not hear his answer, and before I could see his face he\r\nhad turned back again into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V._\r\n\r\nIt was early, and when first I got to my room I felt little inclined for\r\nsleep. I wandered to the window, and drawing aside the curtains, looked\r\nout upon the still, starlit sky. At least I should rest quiet to-night.\r\nThe air was very clear, and the sky seemed full of stars. As I stood\r\nthere scraps of schoolroom learning came back to my mind. That the stars\r\nwere all suns, surrounded perhaps in their turn by worlds as large or\r\nlarger than our own. Worlds beyond worlds, and others farther still,\r\nwhich no man might number or even descry. And about the distance of those\r\nwonderful suns too,—that one, for instance, at which I was looking,—what\r\nwas it that I had been told? That our world was not yet peopled, perhaps\r\nnot yet formed, when the actual spot of light which now struck my sight\r\nfirst started from the star’s surface! While it flashed along, itself the\r\nvery symbol of speed, the whole of mankind had had time to be born, and\r\nlive, and die!\r\n\r\nMy gaze dropped, and fell upon the dim, half-seen outline of the Dead\r\nStone. That woman too. While that one ray speeded towards me her life\r\nhad been lived and ended, and her body had rotted away into the ground.\r\nHow close together we all were! Her life and mine; our joys, sufferings,\r\ndeaths—all crowded together into the space of one flash of light! And yet\r\nthere was nothing there but a horrible skeleton of dead bones, while I——!\r\n\r\nI stopped with a shudder, and turned back into the room. I wished that\r\nAlan had not told me what lay under the stone; I wished that I had never\r\nasked him. It was a ghastly thing to think about, and spoilt all the\r\nbeauty of the night to me.\r\n\r\nI got quickly into bed, and soon dropped asleep. I do not know how long\r\nI slept; but when I woke it was with the consciousness again of that\r\nhaunting wind.\r\n\r\nIt was worse than ever. The world seemed filled with its din. Hurling\r\nitself passionately against the house, it gathered strength with every\r\ngust, till it seemed as if the old walls must soon crash in ruins round\r\nme. Gust upon gust; blow upon blow; swelling, lessening, never ceasing.\r\nThe noise surrounded me; it penetrated my inmost being, as all-pervading\r\nas silence itself, and wrapping me in a solitude even more complete.\r\nThere was nothing left in the world but the wind and I, and then a weird\r\nintangible doubt as to my own identity seized me. The wind was real, the\r\nwind with its echoes of passion and misery from the eternal abyss; but\r\nwas there anything else? What was, and what had been, the world of sense\r\nand of knowledge, my own consciousness, my very self—all seemed gathered\r\nup and swept away in that one sole-existent fury of sound.\r\n\r\nI pulled myself together, and getting out of bed, groped my way to the\r\ntable which stood between the bed and the fireplace. The matches were\r\nthere, and my half-burnt candle, which I lit. The wind penetrating the\r\nrattling casement circled round the room, and the flame of my candle\r\nbent and flared and shrank before it, throwing strange moving lights and\r\nshadows in every corner. I stood there shivering in my thin nightdress,\r\nhalf stunned by the cataract of noise beating on the walls outside, and\r\npeered anxiously around me. The room was not the same. Something was\r\nchanged. What was it? How the shadows leaped and fell, dancing in time to\r\nthe wind’s music. Everything seemed alive. I turned my head slowly to\r\nthe left, and then to the right, and then round—and stopped with a sudden\r\ngasp of fear.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet was open!\r\n\r\nI looked away, and back, and again. There was no room for doubt. The\r\ndoors were thrown back, and were waving gently in the draught. One of the\r\nlower drawers was pulled out, and in a sudden flare of the candle-light\r\nI could see something glistening at its bottom. Then the light dwindled\r\nagain, the candle was almost out, and the cabinet showed a dim black\r\nmass in the darkness. Up and down went the flame, and each returning\r\nbrightness flashed back at me from the thing inside the drawer. I stood\r\nfascinated, my eyes fixed upon the spot, waiting for the fitful glitter\r\nas it came and went. What was there? I knew that I must go and see, but I\r\ndid not want to. If only the cabinet would close again before I looked,\r\nbefore I knew what was inside it. But it stood open, and the glittering\r\nthing lay there, dragging me towards itself.\r\n\r\nSlowly at last, and with infinite reluctance, I went. The drawer was\r\nlined with soft white satin, and upon the satin lay a long, slender\r\nknife, hilted and sheathed in antique silver, richly set with jewels. I\r\ntook it up and turned back to the table to examine it. It was Italian\r\nin workmanship, and I knew that the carving and chasing of the silver\r\nwere more precious even than the jewels which studded it, and whose\r\nrough setting gave so firm a grasp to my hand. Was the blade as fair as\r\nthe covering, I wondered? A little resistance at first, and then the\r\nlong thin steel slid easily out. Sharp, and bright, and finely tempered\r\nit looked with its deadly, tapering point. Stains, dull and irregular,\r\ncrossed the fine engraving on its surface and dimmed its polish. I bent\r\nto examine them more closely, and as I did so a sudden stronger gust\r\nof wind blew out the candle. I shuddered a little at the darkness and\r\nlooked up. But it did not matter: the curtain was still drawn away from\r\nthe window opposite my bedside, and through it a flood of moonlight was\r\npouring in upon floor and bed.\r\n\r\nPutting the sheath down upon the table, I walked to the window to examine\r\nthe knife more closely by that pale light. How gloriously brilliant it\r\nwas, darkened now and again by the quickly passing shadows of wind-driven\r\nclouds! At least so I thought, and I glanced up and out of the window\r\nto see them. A black world met my gaze. Neither moon was there nor\r\nmoonlight. The broad silver beam in which I stood stretched no farther\r\nthan the window. I caught my breath, my limbs stiffened as I looked. No\r\nmoon, no cloud, no movement in the clear, calm starlit sky; while still\r\nthe ghastly light stretched round me, and the spectral shadows drifted\r\nacross the room.\r\n\r\nBut it was not all dark outside. One spot caught my eye, bright with a\r\nlivid unearthly brightness—the Dead Stone shining out into the night\r\nlike an ember from hell’s furnace! There was a horrid semblance of life\r\nin the light—a palpitating, breathing glow—and my pulses beat in time to\r\nit, till I seemed to be drawing it into my veins. It had no warmth, and\r\nas it entered my blood my heart grew colder, and my muscles more rigid.\r\nMy fingers clutched the dagger-hilt till its jeweled roughness pressed\r\npainfully into my palm. All the strength of my strained powers seemed\r\ngathered in that grasp, and the more tightly I held the more vividly did\r\nthe rock gleam and quiver with infernal life. The dead woman! The dead\r\nwoman! What had I to do with her? Let her bones rest in the filth of\r\ntheir own decay, out there under the accursed stone.\r\n\r\nAnd now the noise of the wind lessens in my ears. Let it go on—yes,\r\nlouder and wilder, drowning my senses in its tumult. What is there with\r\nme in the room—the great empty room behind me? Nothing; only the cabinet\r\nwith its waving doors. They are waving to and fro, to and fro—I know it.\r\nBut there is no other life in the room but that—no, no; no other life in\r\nthe room but that.\r\n\r\nOh! don’t let the wind stop. I can’t hear anything while it goes on—but\r\nif it stops! Ah! the gusts grow weaker, struggling, forced into rest.\r\nNow—now—they have ceased.\r\n\r\nSilence!\r\n\r\nA fearful pause.\r\n\r\nWhat is that I hear? There, behind me in the room?\r\n\r\nDo I hear it? Is there anything?\r\n\r\nThe throbbing of my own blood in my ears.\r\n\r\nNo, no! There is something as well—something outside myself.\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\nLow; heavy; regular.\r\n\r\nGod! it is—it is the breath of a living creature! A living creature\r\nhere—close to me—alone with me!\r\n\r\nThe numbness of terror conquers me. I can neither stir nor speak. Only my\r\nwhole soul strains at my ears to listen.\r\n\r\nWhere does the sound come from?\r\n\r\nClose behind me—close.\r\n\r\nAh-h!\r\n\r\nIt is from there—from the bed where I was lying a moment ago!...\r\n\r\nI try to shriek, but the sound gurgles unuttered in my throat. I clutch\r\nthe stone mullions of the window, and press myself against the panes. If\r\nI could but throw myself out—anywhere, anywhere—away from that dreadful\r\nsound—from that thing close behind me in the bed! But I can do nothing.\r\nThe wind has broken forth again now; the storm crashes round me. And\r\nstill through it all I hear the ghastly breathing—even, low, scarcely\r\naudible—but I hear it. I shall hear it as long as I live!...\r\n\r\nIs the thing moving?\r\n\r\nIs it coming nearer?\r\n\r\nNo, no; not that—that was but a fancy to freeze me dead.\r\n\r\nBut to stand here, with that creature behind me, listening, waiting for\r\nthe warm horror of its breath to touch my neck! Ah! I cannot. I will\r\nlook. I will see it face to face. Better any agony than this one.\r\n\r\nSlowly, with held breath, and eyes aching in their stretched fixity, I\r\nturn. There it is? Clear in the moonlight I see the monstrous form within\r\nthe bed—the dark coverlet rises and falls with its heaving breath.... Ah!\r\nheaven have mercy! Is there none to help, none to save me from this awful\r\npresence?...\r\n\r\nAnd the knife-hilt draws my fingers round it, while my flesh quivers,\r\nand my soul grows sick with loathing. The wind howls, the shadows chase\r\nthrough the room, hunting with fearful darkness more fearful light; and I\r\nstand looking ... listening....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must not stand here forever; I must be up and doing. What a noise the\r\nwind makes, and the rattling of the windows and the doors. If he sleeps\r\nthrough this he will sleep through all. Noiselessly my bare feet tread\r\nthe carpet as I approach the bed; noiselessly my left arm raises the\r\nheavy curtain. What does it hide? Do I not know? The bestial features,\r\nhalf-hidden in coarse, black growth; the muddy, blotched skin, oozing\r\nfoulness at every pore. Oh, I know them too well! What a monster it is!\r\nHow the rank breath gurgles through his throat in his drunken sleep. The\r\neyes are closed now, but I know them too; their odious leer, and the\r\nvenomous hatred with which they can glare at me from their bloodshot\r\nsetting. But the time has come at last. Never again shall their passion\r\ninsult me, or their fury degrade me in slavish terror. There he lies;\r\nthere at my mercy, the man who for fifteen years has made God’s light\r\na shame to me, and His darkness a terror. The end has come at last—the\r\nonly end possible, the only end left me. On his head be the blood and the\r\ncrime! God almighty, I am not guilty! The end has come; I can bear my\r\nburden no farther.\r\n\r\n“Beareth all things, endureth all things.”\r\n\r\nWhere have I heard those words? They are in the Bible; the precept of\r\ncharity. What has that to do with me? Nothing. I heard the words in\r\nmy dreams somewhere. A white-faced man said them, a white-faced man\r\nwith pure eyes. To me—no, no, not to me; to a girl it was—an ignorant,\r\ninnocent girl, and she accepted them as an eternal, unqualified law. Let\r\nher bear but half that I have borne, let her endure but one-tenth of what\r\nI have endured, and then if she dare let her speak in judgment against me.\r\n\r\nSoftly now; I must draw the heavy coverings away, and bare his breast\r\nto the stroke—the stroke that shall free me. I know well where to plant\r\nit; I have learned that from the old lady’s Italian. Did he guess why\r\nI questioned him so closely of the surest, straightest road to a man’s\r\nheart? No matter, he cannot hinder me now. Gently! Ah! I have disturbed\r\nhim. He moves, mutters in his sleep, throws out his arm. Down; down;\r\ncrouching behind the curtain. Heavens! if he wakes and sees me, he will\r\nkill me! No, alas, if only he would. I would kiss the hand that he struck\r\nme with; but he is too cruel for that. He will imagine some new and\r\nmore hellish torture to punish me with. But the knife! I have got that;\r\nhe shall never touch me living again.... He is quieter now. I hear his\r\nbreath, hoarse and heavy as a wild beast’s panting. He draws it more\r\nevenly, more deeply. The danger is past. Thank God!\r\n\r\nGod! What have I to do with Him? A God of Judgment. Ha, ha! Hell cannot\r\nfrighten me; it will not be worse than earth. Only he will be there too.\r\nNot with him, not with him—send me to the lowest circle of torment, but\r\nnot with him. There, his breast is bare now. Is the knife sharp? Yes; and\r\nthe blade is strong enough. Now let me strike—myself afterwards if need\r\nbe, but him first. Is it the devil that prompts me? Then the devil is my\r\nfriend, and the friend of the world. No, God is a God of love. He cannot\r\nwish such a man to live. He made him, but the devil spoilt him; and let\r\nthe devil have his handiwork back again. It has served him long enough\r\nhere; and its last service shall be to make me a murderess.\r\n\r\nHow the moonlight gleams from the blade as my arm swings up and back:\r\nwith how close a grasp the rough hilt draws my fingers round it. Now.\r\n\r\nA murderess?\r\n\r\nWait a moment. A moment may make me free; a moment may make me—that!\r\n\r\nWait. Hand and dagger droop again. His life has dragged its slime over my\r\nsoul; shall his death poison it with a fouler corruption still?\r\n\r\n“My own soul’s warden.”\r\n\r\nWhat was that? Dream memories again.\r\n\r\n“Resist, strive, endure.”\r\n\r\nEasy words. What do they mean for me? To creep back now to bed by his\r\nside, and to begin living again tomorrow the life which I have lived\r\ntoday? No, no; I cannot do it. Heaven cannot ask it of me. And there is\r\nno other way. That or this; this or that. Which shall it be? Ah! I have\r\nstriven, God knows. I have endured so long that I hoped even to do so\r\nto the end. But today! Oh! the torment and the outrage: body and soul\r\nstill bear the stain of it. I thought that my heart and my pride were\r\ndead together, but he has stung them again into aching, shameful life.\r\nYesterday I might have spared him, to save my own cold soul from sin; but\r\nnow it is cold no longer. It burns, it burns and the fire must be slaked.\r\n\r\nAy, I will kill him, and have done with it. Why should I pause any\r\nlonger? The knife drags my hand back for the stroke. Only the dream\r\nsurrounds me; the pure man’s face is there, white, beseeching, and God’s\r\nvoice rings in my heart—\r\n\r\n“To him that overcometh.”\r\n\r\nBut I cannot overcome. Evil has governed my life, and evil is stronger\r\nthan I am. What shall I do? What shall I do? God, if Thou art stronger\r\nthan evil, fight for me.\r\n\r\n“The victory of the Cross is ours.”\r\n\r\nYes, I know it. It is true, it is true. But the knife? I cannot loose the\r\nknife if I would. How to wrench it from my own hold? Thou God of Victory\r\nbe with me! Christ help me!\r\n\r\nI seize the blade with my left hand; the two-edged steel slides through\r\nmy grasp; a sharp pain in my fingers and palm; and then nothing....\r\n\r\n\r\n_VI._\r\n\r\nWhen I again became conscious, I found myself half kneeling, half lying\r\nacross the bed, my arms stretched out in front of me, my face buried\r\nin the clothes. Body and mind were alike numbed. A smarting pain in\r\nmy left hand, a dreadful terror in my heart, were at first the only\r\nsensations of which I was aware. Slowly, very slowly, sense and memory\r\nreturned to me, and with them a more vivid intensity of mental anguish,\r\nas detail by detail I recalled the weird horror of the night. Had it\r\nreally happened—was the thing still there—or was it all a ghastly\r\nnightmare? It was some minutes before I dared either to move or look\r\nup, and then fearfully I raised my head. Before me stretched the smooth\r\nwhite coverlet, faintly bright with yellow sunshine. Weak and giddy, I\r\nstruggled to my feet, and, steadying myself against the foot of the bed,\r\nwith clenched teeth and bursting heart, forced my gaze round to the other\r\nend. The pillow lay there, bare and unmarked save for what might well\r\nhave been the pressure of my own head. My breath came more freely, and I\r\nturned to the window. The sun had just risen, the golden tree-tops were\r\ntouched with light, faint threads of mist hung here and there across the\r\nsky, and the twittering of birds sounded clearly through the crisp autumn\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing but a bad dream then, after all, this horror which still\r\nhung round me, leaving me incapable of effort, almost of thought. I\r\nremembered the cabinet, and looked swiftly in that direction. There it\r\nstood, closed as usual, closed as it had been the evening before, as it\r\nhad been for the last three hundred years, except in my dreams.\r\n\r\nYes, that was it; nothing but a dream—a gruesome, haunting dream. With\r\nan instinct of wiping out the dreadful memory, I raised my hand wearily\r\nto my forehead. As I did so, I became conscious again of how it hurt me.\r\nI looked at it. It was covered with half-dried blood, and two straight\r\nclean cuts appeared, one across the palm and one across the inside of the\r\nfingers just below the knuckles. I looked again towards the bed, and, in\r\nthe place where my hand had rested during my faint, a small patch of red\r\nblood was to be seen.\r\n\r\nThen it was true! Then it had all happened! With a low shuddering sob I\r\nthrew myself down upon the couch at the foot of the bed, and lay there\r\nfor some minutes, my limbs trembling, and my soul shrinking within me.\r\nA mist of evil, fearful and loathsome, had descended upon my girlhood’s\r\nlife, sullying its ignorant innocence, saddening its brightness, as I\r\nfelt, forever. I lay there till my teeth began to chatter, and I realized\r\nthat I was bitterly cold. To return to that accursed bed was impossible,\r\nso I pulled a rug which hung at one end of the sofa over me, and, utterly\r\nworn out in mind and body, fell uneasily asleep.\r\n\r\nI was roused by the entrance of my maid. I stopped her exclamations and\r\nquestions by shortly stating that I had had a bad night, had been unable\r\nto rest in bed, and had had an accident with my hand—without further\r\nspecifying of what description.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know that you had been feeling unwell when you went to bed last\r\nnight, miss,” she said.\r\n\r\n“When I went to bed last night? Unwell? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Only Mr. Alan has just asked me to let him know how you find yourself\r\nthis morning,” she answered.\r\n\r\nThen he expected something, dreaded something. Ah! why had he yielded and\r\nallowed me to sleep here, I asked myself bitterly, as the incidents of\r\nthe day before flashed through my mind.\r\n\r\n“Tell him,” I said, “what I have told you; and say that I wish to speak\r\nto him directly after breakfast.” I could not confide my story to any one\r\nelse, but speak of it I must to some one or go mad.\r\n\r\nEvery moment passed in that place was an added misery. Much to my maid’s\r\nsurprise I said that I would dress in her room—the little one which,\r\nas I have said, was close to my own. I felt better there; but my utter\r\nfatigue and my wounded hand combined to make my toilet slow, and I\r\nfound that most of the party had finished breakfast when I reached the\r\ndining room. I was glad of this, for even as it was I found it difficult\r\nenough to give coherent answers to the questions which my white face and\r\nbandaged hand called forth. Alan helped me by giving a resolute turn to\r\nthe conversation. Once only our eyes met across the table. He looked\r\nas haggard and worn as I did. I learned afterwards that he had passed\r\nmost of that fearful night pacing the passage outside my door, though he\r\nlistened in vain for any indication of what was going on within the room.\r\n\r\nThe moment I had finished breakfast he was by my side. “You wish to speak\r\nto me now?” he asked in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes; now,” I answered, breathlessly, and without raising my eyes from\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n“Where shall we go? Outside? It is a bright day, and we shall be freer\r\nthere from interruption.”\r\n\r\nI assented and then looking up at him appealingly, “Will you fetch my\r\nthings for me? I cannot go up to that room again.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to understand me, nodded, and was gone. A few minutes later we\r\nleft the house, and made our way in silence towards a grassy spot on\r\nthe side of the ravine where we had already indulged in more than one\r\nfriendly talk.\r\n\r\nAs we went, the Dead Stone came for a moment into view. I seized Alan’s\r\narm in an almost convulsive grip. “Tell me,” I whispered—“you refused to\r\ntell me yesterday, but you must know—who is buried beneath that rock?”\r\n\r\nThere was now neither timidity nor embarrassment in my tone. The horrors\r\nof that house had become part of my life forever, and their secrets were\r\nmine by right. Alan, after a moment’s pause, a questioning glance at my\r\nface, tacitly accepted the position.\r\n\r\n“I told you the truth,” he replied, “when I said that I did not know; but\r\nI can tell you the popular tradition on the subject, if you like. They\r\nsay that Margaret Mervyn, the woman who murdered her husband, is buried\r\nthere, and that Dame Alice had the rock placed over her grave—whether to\r\nsave it from insult or to mark it out for opprobrium, I never heard. The\r\npoor people about here do not care to go near the place after dark, and\r\namong the older ones there are still some, I believe, who spit at the\r\nsuicide’s grave as they pass.”\r\n\r\n“Poor woman, poor woman!” I exclaimed, in a burst of uncontrollable\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\n“Why should you pity her?” demanded he with sudden sternness; “she\r\nwas a suicide and a murderess too. It would be better for the public\r\nconscience, I believe, if such were still hung in chains, or buried at\r\nthe cross-roads with a stake through their bodies.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Alan, hush!” I cried hysterically, as I clung to him; “don’t speak\r\nharshly of her. You do not know, you cannot tell, how terribly she was\r\ntempted. How can you?”\r\n\r\nHe looked down at me in bewildered surprise. “How can I?” he repeated.\r\n“You speak as if you could. What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask me,” I answered, turning towards him my face—white, quivering,\r\ntear-stained. “Don’t ask me. Not now. You must answer my questions first,\r\nand after that I will tell you. But I cannot talk of it now. Not yet.”\r\n\r\nWe had reached the place we were in search of as I spoke. There, where\r\nthe spreading roots of a great beech tree formed a natural resting place\r\nupon the steep side of the ravine, I took my seat, and Alan stretched\r\nhimself upon the grass beside me. Then looking up at me—“I do not know\r\nwhat questions you would ask,” he said quietly; “but I will answer them,\r\nwhatever they may be.”\r\n\r\nBut I did not ask them yet. I sat instead with my hands clasping my knee,\r\nlooking opposite at the glory of harmonious color, or down the glen at\r\nthe vista of far-off, dream-like loveliness, on which it opened out. The\r\nyellow autumn sunshine made everything golden, the fresh autumn breezes\r\nfilled the air with life; but to me a loathsome shadow seemed to rest\r\nupon all, and to stretch itself out far beyond where my eyes could reach,\r\nbefouling the beauty of the whole wide world. At last I spoke. “You have\r\nknown of it all, I suppose; of this curse that is in the world—sin and\r\nsuffering, and what such words mean.”\r\n\r\n“Yea,” he said, looking at me with wondering pity, “I am afraid so.”\r\n\r\n“But have you known them as they are known to some—agonized, hopeless\r\nsuffering, and sin that is all but inevitable? Some time in your life\r\nprobably you have realized that such things are: it has come home to\r\nyou, and to every one else, no doubt, except a few ignorant girls such\r\nas I was yesterday. But there are some—yes, thousands and thousands—who\r\neven now, at this moment, are feeling sorrow like that, are sinking\r\ndeep, deeper into the bottomless pit of their soul’s degradation. And\r\nyet men who know this, who have seen it, laugh, talk, are happy, amuse\r\nthemselves—how can they, how can they?” I stopped with a catch in my\r\nvoice, and then stretching out my arms in front of me—“And it is not only\r\nmen. Look how beautiful the earth is, and God has made it, and lets the\r\nsun crown it every day with a new glory, while this horror of evil broods\r\nover and poisons it all. Oh, why is it so? I cannot understand it.”\r\n\r\nMy arms drooped again as I finished, and my eyes sought Alan’s. His were\r\nfull of tears, but there was almost a smile quivering at the corners of\r\nhis lips as he replied: “When you have found an answer to that question,\r\nEvie, come and tell me and mankind at large. It will be news to us all.”\r\nThen he continued—“But, after all, the earth is beautiful, and the sun\r\ndoes shine. We have our own happiness to rejoice in, our own sorrows to\r\nbear, the suffering that is near to us to grapple with. For the rest, for\r\nthis blackness of evil which surrounds us, and which we can do nothing to\r\nlighten, it will soon, thank God, become vague and far off to you as it\r\nis to others. Your feeling of it will be dulled, and, except at moments,\r\nyou too will forget.”\r\n\r\n“But that is horrible,” I exclaimed, passionately; “the evil will be\r\nthere all the same, whether I feel it or not. Men and women will be\r\nstruggling in their misery and sin, only I shall be too selfish to care.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot go outside the limits of our own nature,” he replied; “our\r\nknowledge is shallow and our spiritual insight dark, and God in His mercy\r\nhas made our hearts shallow too, and our imagination dull. If, knowing\r\nand trusting only as men do, we were to feel as angels feel, earth would\r\nbe hell indeed.”\r\n\r\nIt was cold comfort, but at that moment anything warmer or brighter\r\nwould have been unreal and utterly repellent to me. I hardly took in the\r\nmeaning of his words, but it was as if a hand had been stretched out to\r\nme, struggling in the deep mire, by one who himself felt solid ground\r\nbeneath him. Where he stood I also might some day stand, and that thought\r\nseemed to make patience possible.\r\n\r\nIt was he who first broke the silence which followed. “You were saying\r\nthat you had questions to ask me. I am impatient to put mine in return,\r\nso please go on.”\r\n\r\nIt had been a relief to me to turn even to generalizations of despair\r\nfrom the actual horror which had inspired them, and to which my mind\r\nwas thus recalled. With an effort I replied, “Yes, I want to ask you\r\nabout that room—the room in which I slept, and—and the murder which was\r\ncommitted there.” In spite of all that I could do, my voice sank almost\r\nto a whisper as I concluded, and I was trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“Who told you that a murder was committed there?” Something in my face\r\nas he asked the question made him add quickly, “Never mind. You are\r\nright. That is the room in which Hugh Mervyn was murdered by his wife.\r\nI was surprised at your question, for I did not know that anyone but\r\nmy brothers and myself were aware of the fact. The subject is never\r\nmentioned. It is closely connected with one intensely painful to our\r\nfamily, and besides, if spoken of, there would be inconveniences arising\r\nfrom the superstitious terrors of servants, and the natural dislike of\r\nguests to sleep in a room where such a thing had happened. Indeed it\r\nwas largely with the view of wiping out the last memory of the crime’s\r\nlocality, that my father renewed the interior of the room some twenty\r\nyears ago. The only tradition which has been adhered to in connection\r\nwith it is the one which has now been violated in your person—the one\r\nwhich precludes any unmarried woman from sleeping there. Except for that,\r\nthe room has, as you know, lost all sinister reputation, and its title of\r\n‘haunted’ has become purely conventional. Nevertheless, as I said, you\r\nare right—that is undoubtedly the room in which the murder was committed.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked up at me, waiting for more.\r\n\r\n“Go on; tell me about it, and what followed.” My lips formed the words;\r\nmy heart beat faintly for my breath to utter them.\r\n\r\n“About the murder itself there is not much to tell. The man, I believe,\r\nwas an inhuman scoundrel, and the woman first killed him in desperation,\r\nand afterwards herself in despair. The only detail connected with\r\nthe actual crime of which I have ever heard, was the gale that was\r\nblowing that night—the fiercest known to this countryside in that\r\ngeneration; and it has always been said since that any misfortune to the\r\nMervyns—especially any misfortune connected with the curse—comes with a\r\nstorm of wind. That was why I so disliked your story of the imaginary\r\ntempests which have disturbed your nights since you slept there. As to\r\nwhat followed,”—he gave a sigh—“that story is long enough and full of\r\nincident. On the morning after the murder, so runs the tale, Dame Alice\r\ncame down to the Grange from the tower to which she had retired when\r\nher son’s wickedness had driven her from his house, and there in the\r\npresence of the two corpses she foretold the curse which should rest upon\r\ntheir descendants for generations to come. A clergyman who was present,\r\nhorrified, it is said at her words, adjured her by the mercy of Heaven to\r\nplace some term to the doom which she had pronounced. She replied that no\r\nmortal might reckon the fruit of a plant which drew its life from hell;\r\nthat a term there should be, but as it passed the wisdom of man to fix\r\nit, so it should pass the wit of man to discover it. She then placed in\r\nthe room this cabinet, constructed by herself and her Italian follower,\r\nand said that the curse should not depart from the family until the day\r\nwhen its doors were unlocked and its legend read.\r\n\r\n“Such is the story. I tell it to you as it was told to me. One thing only\r\nis certain, that the doom thus traditionally foretold has been only too\r\namply fulfilled.”\r\n\r\n“And what was the doom?”\r\n\r\nAlan hesitated a little, and when he spoke his voice was almost awful in\r\nits passionless sternness, in its despairing finality; it seemed to echo\r\nthe irrevocable judgment which his words pronounced: “That the crimes\r\nagainst God and each other which had destroyed the parents’ life should\r\nenter into the children’s blood, and that never thereafter should there\r\nfail a Mervyn to bring shame or death upon one generation of his father’s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“There were two sons of that ill-fated marriage,” he went on after a\r\npause, “boys at the time of their parents’ death. When they grew up\r\nthey both fell in love with the same woman, and one killed the other in\r\na duel. The story of the next generation was a peculiarly sad one. Two\r\nbrothers took opposite sides during the civil troubles; but so fearful\r\nwere they of the curse which lay upon the family, that they chiefly\r\nmade use of their mutual position in order to protect and guard each\r\nother. After the wars were over, the younger brother, while traveling\r\nupon some parliamentary commission, stopped a night at the Grange.\r\nThere, through a mistake, he exchanged the report which he was bringing\r\nto London for a packet of papers implicating his brother and several\r\nbesides in a royalist plot. He only discovered his error as he handed\r\nthe papers to his superior, and was but just able to warn his brother\r\nin time for him to save his life by flight. The other men involved were\r\ntaken and executed, and as it was known by what means information had\r\nreached the Government, the elder Mervyn was universally charged with\r\nthe vilest treachery. It is said that when after the Restoration his\r\nreturn home was rumored the neighboring gentry assembled, armed with\r\nriding whips, to flog him out of the country if he should dare to show\r\nhis face there. He died abroad, shame-stricken and broken-hearted. It was\r\nhis son, brought up by his uncle in the sternest tenets of Puritanism,\r\nwho, coming home after a lengthened journey, found that during his\r\nabsence his sister had been shamefully seduced. He turned her out of\r\ndoors, then and there, in the midst of a bitter January night, and the\r\nnext morning her dead body and that of her new-born infant were found\r\nhalf buried in the fresh-fallen snow on the top of the wolds. The ‘white\r\nlady’ is still supposed by the villagers to haunt that side of the glen.\r\nAnd so it went on. A beautiful, heartless Mervyn in Queen Anne’s time\r\nenticed away the affections of her sister’s betrothed, and on the day\r\nof her own wedding with him, her forsaken sister was found drowned by\r\nher own act in the pond at the bottom of the garden. Two brothers were\r\nsoldiers together in some Continental war, and one was involuntarily the\r\nmeans of discovering and exposing the treason of the other. A girl was\r\nbetrayed into a false marriage, and her life ruined by a man who came\r\ninto the house as her brother’s friend, and whose infamous designs were\r\nforwarded and finally accomplished by that same brother’s active though\r\nunsuspecting assistance. Generation after generation, men or women,\r\nguilty or innocent, through the action of their own will or in spite of\r\nit, the curse has never yet failed of its victims.”\r\n\r\n“Never yet? But surely in our own time—your father?” I did not dare to\r\nput the question which was burning my lips.\r\n\r\n“Have you never heard of the tragic end of my poor young uncles?” he\r\nreplied. “They were several years older than my father. When boys of\r\nfourteen and fifteen they were sent out with the keeper for their first\r\nshooting lesson, and the elder shot his brother through the heart. He\r\nhimself was delicate, and they say that he never entirely recovered from\r\nthe shock. He died before he was twenty, and my father, then a child\r\nof seven years old, became the heir. It was partly, no doubt, owing to\r\nthis calamity having thus occurred before he was old enough to feel it,\r\nthat his comparative skepticism on the whole subject was due. To that,\r\nI suppose, and to the fact that he grew up in an age of railways and\r\nliberal culture.”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t believe, then, in the curse?”\r\n\r\n“Well, rather, he thought nothing about it. Until, that is, the time came\r\nwhen it took effect, to break his heart and end his life.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a little. Alan had turned away his head, so that I\r\ncould not see his face. Then—\r\n\r\n“I suppose you have never been told the true story of why Jack left the\r\ncountry?”\r\n\r\n“No. Was he—is he——?”\r\n\r\n“He is one victim of the curse in this generation, and I, God help me, am\r\nthe other, and perhaps more wretched one.”\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled and broke, and for the first time that day I almost\r\nforgot the mysterious horror of the night before, in my pity for the\r\nactual, tangible suffering before me. I stretched out my hand to his, and\r\nhis fingers closed on mine with a sudden, painful grip. Then quietly—\r\n\r\n“I will tell you the story,” he said, “though since that miserable time I\r\nhave spoken of it to no one.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before he began. He lay there by my side, his gaze\r\nturned across me up the sunbright, autumn-tinted glen, but his eyes\r\nshadowed by the memories which he was striving to recall and arrange in\r\ndue order in his mind. And when he did speak it was not directly to begin\r\nthe promised recital.\r\n\r\n“You never knew Jack,” he said, abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Hardly,” I acquiesced. “I remember thinking him very handsome.”\r\n\r\n“There could not be two opinions as to that,” he answered. “And a man who\r\ncould have done anything he liked with life, had things gone differently.\r\nHis abilities were fine, but his strength lay above all in his character:\r\nhe was strong—strong in his likes and in his dislikes, resolute,\r\nfearless, incapable of half measures—a man, every inch of him. He was not\r\ngenerally popular—stiff, hard, unsympathetic, people called him. From\r\none point of view, and one only, he perhaps deserved the epithets. If a\r\nwoman lost his respect she seemed to lose his pity too. Like a mediaeval\r\nmonk, he looked upon such rather as the cause than the result of male\r\ndepravity, and his contempt for them mingled with anger, almost, as I\r\nsometimes thought, with hatred. And this attitude was, I have no doubt,\r\nresented by the men of his own class and set, who shared neither his\r\nfaults nor his virtues. But in other ways he was not hard. He could love;\r\nI, at least, have cause to know it. If you would hear his story rightly\r\nfrom my lips, Evie, you must try and see him with my eyes. The friend who\r\nloved me, and whom I loved with the passion which, if not the strongest,\r\nis certainly, I believe, the most enduring of which men are capable—that\r\nperfect brother’s love, which so grows into our being that when it is at\r\npeace we are scarcely conscious of its existence, and when it is wounded\r\nour very life-blood seems to flow at the stroke. Brothers do not always\r\nlove like that: I can only wish that we had not done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_VII._\r\n\r\n“Well, about five years ago, before I had taken my degree, I became\r\nacquainted with a woman whom I will call ‘Delia,’—it is near enough\r\nto the name by which she went. She was a few years older than myself,\r\nvery beautiful, and I believed her to be what she described herself—the\r\ninnocent victim of circumstance and false appearance, a helpless prey\r\nto the vile calumnies of worldlings. In sober fact, I am afraid that\r\nwhatever her life may have been actually at the time that I knew her—a\r\nsubject which I have never cared to investigate—her past had been not\r\nonly bad enough irretrievably to fix her position in society, but bad\r\nenough to leave her without an ideal in the world, though still retaining\r\nwithin her heart the possibilities of a passion which, from the moment\r\nthat it came to life, was strong enough to turn her whole existence\r\ninto one desperate reckless straining after an object hopelessly beyond\r\nher reach. That was the woman with whom, at the age of twenty, I\r\nfancied myself in love. She wanted to get a husband, and she thought\r\nme—rightly—ass enough to accept the post. I was very young then even for\r\nmy years,—a student, an idealist, with an imagination highly developed,\r\nand no knowledge whatever of the world as it actually is. Anyhow, before\r\nI had known her a month, I had determined to make her my wife. My parents\r\nwere abroad at the time, George and Lucy here, so that it was to Jack\r\nthat I imparted the news of my resolve. As you may imagine, he did\r\nall that he could to shake it. But I was immovable. I disbelieved his\r\nfacts, and despised his contempt from the standpoint of my own superior\r\nmorality. This state of things continued for several weeks, during the\r\ngreater part of which time I was at Oxford. I only knew that while I was\r\nthere, Jack had made Delia’s acquaintance, and was apparently cultivating\r\nit assiduously.\r\n\r\n“One day, during the Easter vacation, I got a note from her asking me to\r\nsupper at her house. Jack was invited too. We lodged together while my\r\npeople were away.\r\n\r\n“There is no need to dwell upon that supper. There were two or three\r\nwomen there of her own sort, or worse, and a dozen men from among the\r\nmost profligate in London. The conversation was, I should think, bad even\r\nfor that class; and she, the goddess of my idolatry, outstripped them all\r\nby the foul, coarse shamelessness of her language and behavior. Before\r\nthe entertainment was half over, I rose and took my leave, accompanied\r\nby Jack and another man—Legard was his name—who I presume was bored.\r\nJust as we had passed through into the anteroom, which lay beyond the\r\none in which we had been eating, Delia followed us, and laying her hand\r\non Jack’s arm, said that she must speak with him. Legard and I went into\r\nthe outer hall, and we had not been there more than a minute when the\r\ndoor from the anteroom opened, and we heard Delia’s voice. I remember the\r\nwords well—that was not the only occasion on which I was to hear them. ‘I\r\nwill keep the ring as a record of my love,’ she said, ‘and understand,\r\nthat though you may forget, I never shall.’ Jack came through, the door\r\nclosed, and as we went out I glanced towards his left hand, and saw, as\r\nI expected to see, the absence of the ring which he usually wore there.\r\nIt contained a gem which my mother had picked up in the East, and I knew\r\nthat he valued it quite peculiarly. We always called it Jack’s talisman.\r\n\r\n“A miserable time followed, a time for me of agonizing wonder and doubt,\r\nduring which regret for my dead illusion was entirely swallowed up in the\r\nterrible dread of my brother’s degradation. Then came the announcement\r\nof his engagement to Lady Sylvia Grey; and a week later, the very day\r\nafter I had finally returned to London from Oxford, I received a summons\r\nfrom Delia to come and see her. Curiosity, and the haunting fear about\r\nJack, which still hung round me, induced me to consent to what otherwise\r\nwould have been intolerably repellent to me, and I went. I found her\r\nin a mad passion of fury. Jack had refused to see her or to answer her\r\nletters, and she had sent for me, that I might give him her message—tell\r\nhim that he belonged to her and her only and that he never should marry\r\nanother woman. Angry at my interference, Jack disdained even to repudiate\r\nher claims, only sending back a threat of appealing to the police if\r\nshe ventured upon any further annoyance. I wrote as she told me, and\r\nshe emphasized my silence on the subject by writing back to me a more\r\ndefinite and explicit assertion of her rights. Beyond that for some\r\nweeks she made no sign. I have no doubt that she had means of keeping\r\nwatch upon both his movements and mine; and during that time, as she\r\nrelinquished gradually all hopes of inducing him to abandon his purpose,\r\nshe was being driven to her last despairing resolve.\r\n\r\n“Later, when all was over, Jack told me the story of that spring and\r\nsummer. He told me how, when he found me immovable on the subject, he\r\nhad resolved to stop the marriage somehow through Delia herself. He had\r\nmade her acquaintance, and sought her society frequently. She had taken\r\na fancy to him, and he admitted that he had availed himself of this fact\r\nto increase his intimacy with her, and, as he hoped ultimately, his power\r\nover her, but he was not conscious of ever having varied in his manner\r\ntowards her of contemptuous indifference. This contradictory behavior—his\r\nbeing constantly near her, yet always beyond her reach—was probably the\r\nvery thing which excited her fancy into passion, and the one strong\r\npassion of the poor woman’s life. Then came his deliberate demand that\r\nshe should by her own act unmask herself in my sight. The unfortunate\r\nwoman tried to bargain for some proof of affection in return, and on this\r\noccasion had first openly declared her feelings towards him. He did not\r\nbelieve her; he refused her terms; but when as her payment she asked for\r\nthe ring which was so especially associated with himself, he agreed to\r\ngive it to her. Otherwise hoping, no doubt against hope, dreading above\r\nall things a quarrel and final separation, she submitted unconditionally.\r\nAnd from the time of that evening, when Legard and I had overheard\r\nher parting words, Jack never saw her again until the last and final\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\n“It was in July. My parents had returned to England, but had come\r\nstraight on here. Jack and I were dining together with Lady Sylvia at her\r\nfather’s house—her brother, young Grey, making the fourth at dinner. I\r\nhad arranged to go to a party with your mother, and I told the servants\r\nthat a lady would call for me early in the evening. The house stood in\r\nPark Lane, and after dinner we all went out on to the broad balcony which\r\nopened from the drawing-room. There was a strong wind blowing that night,\r\nand I remember well the vague, disquieted feeling of unreality that\r\npossessed me—sweeping through me, as it were, with each gust of wind.\r\nThen, suddenly, a servant stood behind me, saying that the lady had come\r\nfor me, and was in the drawing-room. Shocked that my aunt should have\r\ntroubled herself to come so far, I turned quickly, stepped back into the\r\nroom, and found myself face to face with Delia. She was fully dressed for\r\nthe evening, with a long silk opera-cloak over her shoulders, her face\r\nas white as her gown, her splendid eyes strangely wide open and shining.\r\nI don’t know what I said or did. I tried to get her away, but it was too\r\nlate. The others had heard us, and appeared at the open window. Jack came\r\nforward at once, speaking rapidly, fiercely; telling her to leave the\r\nhouse at once; promising desperately that he would see her in his own\r\nrooms on the morrow. Well I remember how her answer rang out—\r\n\r\n“‘Neither tomorrow nor another day. I will never leave you again while I\r\nlive.’\r\n\r\n“At the same instant she drew something swiftly from under her cloak,\r\nthere was the sound of a pistol shot and she lay dead at our feet, her\r\nblood splashing upon Jack’s shirt and hands as she fell.”\r\n\r\nAlan paused in his recital. He was trembling from head to foot; but he\r\nkept his eyes turned steadily downwards, and both face and voice were\r\ncold—almost expressionless.\r\n\r\n“Of course there was an inquest,” he resumed, “which, as usual, exercised\r\nits very ill-defined powers in inquiring into all possible motives for\r\nthe suicide. Young Grey, who had stepped into the room just before the\r\nshot had been fired, swore to the last words Delia had uttered; Legard\r\nto those he had overheard the night of that dreadful supper. There\r\nwere scores of men to bear witness to the intimate relations which had\r\nexisted between her and Jack during the whole of the previous spring. I\r\nhad to give evidence. A skillful lawyer had been retained by one of her\r\nsisters, and had been instructed by her on points which no doubt she\r\nhad originally learnt from Delia herself. In his hands, I had not only\r\nto corroborate Grey and Legard, and to give full details of that last\r\ninterview, but also to swear to the peculiar value which Jack attached to\r\nthe talisman ring which he had given Delia; to the language she had held\r\nwhen I saw her after my return from Oxford; to her subsequent letter,\r\nand Jack’s fatal silence on the occasion. The story by which Jack and I\r\nstrove to account for the facts was laughed at as a clumsy invention, and\r\nmy undisguised reluctance in giving evidence added greatly to its weight\r\nagainst my brother’s character.\r\n\r\n“The jury returned a verdict of suicide while of unsound mind, the\r\nresult of desertion by her lover. You may imagine how that verdict was\r\ncommented upon by every Radical newspaper in the kingdom, and for once\r\nsociety more than corroborated the opinions of the press. The larger\r\npublic regarded the story as an extreme case of the innocent victim and\r\nthe cowardly society villain. It was only among a comparatively small set\r\nthat Delia’s reputation was known, and there, in view of Jack’s notorious\r\nand peculiar intimacy, his repudiation of all relations with her was\r\nreceived with contemptuous incredulity. That he should have first entered\r\nupon such relations at the very time when he was already courting Lady\r\nSylvia was regarded even in those circles as a ‘strong order,’ and they\r\nlooked upon his present attitude with great indignation, as a cowardly\r\nattempt to save his own character by casting upon the dead woman’s memory\r\nall the odium of a false accusation. With an entire absence of logic,\r\ntoo, he was made responsible for the suicide having taken place in Lady\r\nSylvia’s presence. She had broken off the engagement the day after the\r\ncatastrophe, and her family, a clan powerful in the London world, furious\r\nat the mud through which her name had been dragged, did all that they\r\ncould to intensify the feeling already existing against Jack.\r\n\r\n“Not a voice was raised in his defense. He was advised to leave the\r\narmy; he was requested to withdraw from some of his clubs, turned out of\r\nothers, avoided by his fast acquaintances, cut by his respectable ones.\r\nIt was enough to kill a weaker man.\r\n\r\n“He showed no resentment at the measure thus dealt out to him. Indeed,\r\nat the first, except for Sylvia’s desertion of him, he seemed dully\r\nindifferent to it all. It was as if his soul had been stunned, from the\r\nmoment that that wretched woman’s blood had splashed upon his fingers,\r\nand her dead eyes had looked into his own.\r\n\r\n“But it was not long before he realized the full extent of the social\r\ndamnation which had been inflicted upon him, and he then resolved to\r\nleave the country and go to America. The night before he started he came\r\ndown here to take leave. I was here looking after my parents—George,\r\nwhose mind was almost unhinged by the family disgrace, having gone\r\nabroad with his wife. My mother at the first news of what had happened\r\nhad taken to her bed, never to leave it again; and thus it was in my\r\npresence alone, up there in my father’s little study, that Jack gave him\r\nthat night the whole story. He told it quietly enough; but when he had\r\nfinished, with a sudden outburst of feeling he turned upon me. It was I\r\nwho had been the cause of it all. My insensate folly had induced him to\r\nmake the unhappy woman’s acquaintance, to allow and even encourage her\r\nfatal love, to commit all the blunders and sins which had brought about\r\nher miserable ending and his final overthrow. It was by means of me that\r\nshe had obtained access to him on that dreadful night; my evidence which\r\nmost utterly damned him in public opinion; through me he had lost his\r\nreputation, his friends, his career, his country, the woman he loved,\r\nhis hopes for the future; through me, above all, that the burden of that\r\nhorrible death would lie forever on his soul. He was lashing himself to\r\nfury with his own words as he spoke; and I stood leaning against the\r\nwall opposite to him cold, dumb, unresisting, when suddenly my father\r\ninterrupted. I think that both Jack and I had forgotten his presence;\r\nbut at the sound of his voice, changed from what we had ever heard it,\r\nwe turned to him, and I then for the first time saw in his face the\r\ndeath-look which never afterwards quitted it.\r\n\r\n“‘Stop, Jack,’ he said; ‘Alan is not to blame; and if it had not been in\r\nthis way, it would have been in some other. I only am guilty, who brought\r\nyou both into existence with my own hell-stained blood in your veins. If\r\nyou wish to curse anyone, curse your family, your name, me if you will,\r\nand may God forgive me that you were ever born into the world!’”\r\n\r\nAlan stopped with a shudder, and then continued, dully, “It was when I\r\nheard those words, the most terrible that a father could have uttered,\r\nthat I first understood all that that old sixteenth-century tale might\r\nmean to me and mine—I have realized it vividly enough since. Early the\r\nnext morning, when the dawn was just breaking, Jack came to the door of\r\nmy room to bid me good-by. All his passion was gone. His looks and tones\r\nseemed part and parcel of the dim gray morning light. He freely withdrew\r\nall the charges he had made against me the night before; forgave me all\r\nthe share that I had had in his misfortunes; and then begged that I would\r\nnever come near him, or let him hear from me again. ‘The curse is heavy\r\nupon us both,’ he said, ‘and it is the only favor which you can do me.’ I\r\nhave never seen him since.”\r\n\r\n“But you have heard of him!” I exclaimed; “what has become of him?”\r\n\r\nAlan raised himself to a sitting posture. “The last that I heard,” he\r\nsaid, with a catch in his voice, “was that in his misery and hopelessness\r\nhe was taking to drink. George writes to him, and does what he can; but\r\nI—I dare not say a word, for fear it should turn to poison on my lips—I\r\ndare not lift a hand to help him, for fear it should have power to strike\r\nhim to the ground. The worst may be yet to come; I am still living, still\r\nliving. There are depths of shame to which he has not sunk. And oh, Evie,\r\nEvie, he is my own, my best-loved brother!”\r\n\r\nAll his composure was gone now. His voice rose to a kind of wail with\r\nthe last words, and folding his arms on his raised knee, he let his\r\nhead fall upon them, while his figure quivered with scarcely restrained\r\nemotion. There was a silence for some moments while he sat thus, I\r\nlooking on in wretched helplessness beside him. Then he raised his head,\r\nand, without looking round at me, went on in a low tone: “And what is\r\nin the future? I pray that death instead of shame may be the portion of\r\nthe next generation, and I look at George’s boys only to wonder which of\r\nthem is the happy one who shall some day lie dead at his brother’s feet.\r\nAre you surprised at my resolution never to marry? The fatal prophecy is\r\nrich in its fulfillment; none of our name and blood are safe; and the day\r\nmight come when I too should have to call upon my children to curse me\r\nfor their birth,—should have to watch while the burden which I could no\r\nlonger bear alone pressed the life from their mother’s heart.”\r\n\r\nThrough the tragedy of this speech I was conscious of a faint suggestion\r\nof comfort, a far-off glimmer, as of unseen home-lights on a midnight\r\nsky. I was in no mood then to understand, or to seek to understand, what\r\nit was; but I know now that his words had removed the weight of helpless\r\nbanishment from my spirit—that his heart, speaking through them to my\r\nown, had made me for life the sharer of his grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n_VIII._\r\n\r\nPresently he drew his shoulders together with a slight determined\r\njerk, threw himself back upon the grass, and turning to me, with that\r\ntremulous, haggard smile upon his lips which I knew so well, but which\r\nhad never before struck me with such infinite pathos, “Luckily,” he said,\r\n“there are other things to do in life besides being happy. Only perhaps\r\nyou understand now what I meant last night when I spoke of things which\r\nflesh and blood cannot bear, and yet which must be borne.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly and sharply his words roused again into activity the loathsome\r\nmemory which my interest in his story had partially deadened. He noticed\r\nthe quick involuntary contraction of my muscles, and read it aright.\r\n“That reminds me,” he went on; “I must claim your promise. I have told\r\nyou my story. Now, tell me yours.”\r\n\r\nI told him; not as I have set it down here, though perhaps even in\r\ngreater detail, but incoherently, bit by bit, while he helped me out with\r\ngentle questions, quickly comprehending gestures, and patient waiting\r\nduring the pauses of exhaustion which perforce interposed themselves. As\r\nmy story approached its climax, his agitation grew almost equal to my\r\nown, and he listened to the close, his teeth clenched, his brows bent,\r\nas if passing again with me through that awful conflict. When I had\r\nfinished, it was some moments before either of us could speak; and then\r\nhe burst forth into bitter self-reproach for having so far yielded to his\r\nbrother’s angry obstinacy as to allow me to sleep the third night in that\r\nfatal room.\r\n\r\n“It was cowardice,” he said, “sheer cowardice! After all that has\r\nhappened, I dared not have a quarrel with one of my own blood. And yet if\r\nI had not hardened my heart, I had reason to know what I was risking.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Those other two girls who slept there,” he said, breathlessly; “it was\r\nin each case after the third night there that they were found dead—dead,\r\nEvie, so runs the story, with a mark upon their necks similar in shape\r\nand position to the death-wound which Margaret Mervyn inflicted upon\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\nI could not speak, but I clutched his hand with an almost convulsive grip.\r\n\r\n“And I knew the story,—I knew it!” he cried. “As boys we were not allowed\r\nto hear much of our family traditions, but this one I knew. When my\r\nfather redid the interior of the east room, he removed at the same time\r\na board from above the doorway outside, on which had been written—it\r\nis said by Dame Alice herself—a warning upon this very subject. I\r\nhappened to be present when our old housekeeper, who had been his nurse,\r\nremonstrated with him warmly upon this act; and I asked her afterwards\r\nwhat the board was, and why she cared about it so much. In her excitement\r\nshe told me the story of those unhappy girls, repeating again and again\r\nthat, if the warning were taken away, evil would come of it.”\r\n\r\n“And she was right,” I said, dully. “Oh, if only your father had left it\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” he answered, speaking more quietly, “that he was impatient\r\nof traditions which, as I told you, he at that time more than half\r\ndespised. Indeed he altered the shape of the doorway, raising it, and\r\nmaking it flat and square, so that the old inscription could not have\r\nbeen replaced, even had it been wished. I remember it was fitted round\r\nthe low Tudor arch which was previously there.”\r\n\r\nMy mind, too worn with many emotions for deliberate thought, wandered on\r\nlanguidly, and as it were mechanically, upon these last trivial words.\r\nThe doorway presented itself to my view as it had originally stood, with\r\nthe discarded warning above it; and then, by a spontaneous comparison of\r\nmental vision, I recalled the painted board which I had noticed three\r\ndays before in Dame Alice’s tower. I suggested to Alan that it might have\r\nbeen the identical one—its shape was as he described. “Very likely,” he\r\nanswered, absently. “Do you remember what the words were?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so,” I replied. “Let me see.” And I repeated them slowly,\r\ndragging them out as it were one by one from my memory:\r\n\r\n    “Where the woman sinned the maid shall win;\r\n    But God help the maid that sleeps within.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” I said, turning towards him slowly, “the last line is a\r\nwarning such as you spoke of.”\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise Alan had sprung to his feet, and was looking down at\r\nme, his whole body quivering with excitement. “Yes, Evie,” he cried, “and\r\nthe first line is a prophecy;—where the woman sinned the maid _has_ won.”\r\nHe seized the hand which I instinctively reached out to him. “We have\r\nnot seen the end of this yet,” he went on, speaking rapidly, and as if\r\narticulation had become difficult to him. “Come, Evie, we must go back to\r\nthe house and look at the cabinet—now, at once.”\r\n\r\nI had risen to my feet by this time, but I shrank away at those words,\r\n“To that room? Oh, Alan—no, I cannot.”\r\n\r\nHe had hold of my hand still, and he tightened his grasp upon it. “I\r\nshall be with you; you will not be afraid with me,” he said. “Come.” His\r\neyes were burning, his face flushed and paled in rapid alternation, and\r\nhis hand held mine like a vice of iron.\r\n\r\nI turned with him, and we walked back to the Grange, Alan quickening his\r\npace as he went, till I almost had to run by his side. As we approached\r\nthe dreaded room my sense of repulsion became almost unbearable; but I\r\nwas now infected by his excitement, though I but dimly comprehended its\r\ncause. We met no one on our way, and in a moment he had hurried me into\r\nthe house, up the stairs, and along the narrow passage, and I was once\r\nmore in the east room, and in the presence of all the memories of that\r\naccursed night. For an instant I stood strengthless, helpless, on the\r\nthreshold, my gaze fixed panic-stricken on the spot where I had taken\r\nsuch awful part in that phantom tragedy of evil; then Alan threw his\r\narm round me, and drew me hastily on in front of the cabinet. Without\r\na pause, giving himself time neither to speak nor think, he stretched\r\nout his left hand and moved the buttons one after another. How or in\r\nwhat direction he moved them I know not; but as the last turned with a\r\nclick, the doors, which no mortal hand had unclosed for three hundred\r\nyears, flew back, and the cabinet stood open. I gave a little gasp of\r\nfear. Alan pressed his lips closely together, and turned to me with eager\r\nquestioning in his eyes. I pointed in answer tremblingly at the drawer\r\nwhich I had seen open the night before. He drew it out, and there on its\r\nsatin bed lay the dagger in its silver sheath. Still without a word he\r\ntook it up, and reaching his right hand round me, for I could not now\r\nhave stood had he withdrawn his support, with a swift strong jerk he\r\nunsheathed the blade. There in the clear autumn sunshine I could see the\r\nsame dull stains I had marked in the flickering candle-light, and over\r\nthem, still ruddy and moist, were the drops of my own half-dried blood.\r\nI grasped the lapel of his coat with both my hands, and clung to him\r\nlike a child in terror, while the eyes of both of us remained fixed as\r\nif fascinated upon the knife-blade. Then, with a sudden start of memory,\r\nAlan raised his to the cornice of the cabinet, and mine followed. No\r\nchange that I could detect had taken place in that twisted goldwork; but\r\nthere, clear in the sight of us both, stood forth the words of the magic\r\nmotto:\r\n\r\n    “Pure blood shed by the blood-stained knife\r\n    Ends Mervyn shame, heals Mervyn strife.”\r\n\r\nIn low steady tones Alan read out the lines, and then there was\r\nsilence—on my part of stunned bewilderment, the bewilderment of a spirit\r\noverwhelmed beyond the power of comprehension by rushing, conflicting\r\nemotions. Alan pressed me closer to him, while the silence seemed to\r\nthrob with the beating of his heart and the panting of his breath. But\r\nexcept for that he remained motionless, gazing at the golden message\r\nbefore him. At length I felt a movement, and looking up saw his face\r\nturned down towards mine, the lips quivering, the cheeks flushed, the\r\neyes soft with passionate feeling. “We are saved, my darling,” he\r\nwhispered; “saved, and through you.” Then he bent his head lower, and\r\nthere in that room of horror, I received the first long lover’s kiss from\r\nmy own dear husband’s lips.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy husband, yes; but not till some time after that. Alan’s first act,\r\nwhen he had once fully realized that the curse was indeed removed,\r\nwas—throwing his budding practice to the winds—to set sail for America.\r\nThere he sought out Jack, and labored hard to impart to him some of his\r\nown newfound hope. It was slow work, but he succeeded at last; and only\r\nleft him when, two years later, he had handed him over to the charge\r\nof a bright-eyed Western girl, to whom the whole story had been told,\r\nand who showed herself ready and anxious to help in building up again\r\nthe broken life of her English lover. To judge from the letters that we\r\nhave since received, she has shown herself well fitted for the task.\r\nAmong other things she has money, and Jack’s worldly affairs have so\r\nprospered that George declares that he can well afford now to waste some\r\nof his superfluous cash upon farming a few of his elder brother’s acres.\r\nThe idea seems to smile upon Jack, and I have every hope this winter of\r\nbeing able to institute an actual comparison between our small boy, his\r\nnamesake, and his own three-year-old Alan. The comparison, by the way,\r\nwill have to be conditional, for Jacket—the name by which my son and heir\r\nis familiarly known—is but a little more than two.\r\n\r\nI turn my eyes for a moment, and they fall upon the northern corner of\r\nthe East Room, which shows round the edge of the house. Then the skeleton\r\nleaps from the cupboard of my memory; the icy hand which lies ever near\r\nmy soul grips it suddenly with a chill shudder. Not for nothing was that\r\nwretched woman’s life interwoven with my own, if only for an hour; not\r\nfor nothing did my spirit harbor a conflict and an agony, which, thank\r\nGod, are far from its own story. Though Margaret Mervyn’s dagger failed\r\nto pierce my flesh, the wound in my soul may never wholly be healed. I\r\nknow that that is so; and yet as I turn to start through the sunshine\r\nto the cedar shade and its laughing occupants, I whisper to myself with\r\nfervent conviction, “It was worth it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYRIE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a strange thing. We can’t understand it. In last month’s Eyrie we\r\nmentioned the enormous flood of manuscripts that daily inundates us,\r\nand now we’re going to dwell briefly on a singular phase of this sea of\r\nwords—a peculiar circumstance that might profitably be studied by your\r\nsedulous student of psychology.\r\n\r\nThese manuscripts come from all parts of the civilized world, and they\r\ncome from all sorts of people—lawyers, truck drivers, doctors, farmers’\r\nwives, university professors, carpenters, high school girls, convicts,\r\nsociety women, drug fiends, ministers, policemen, novelists, hotel clerks\r\nand professional tramps—and one, therefore, would naturally expect\r\ntheir stories to possess corresponding diversity. But not so. With rare\r\nexceptions, all these stories, written by all these different kinds of\r\npeople, are almost exactly alike!\r\n\r\nNot only do they contain the same general plots and themes—one might\r\nunderstand that—but practically all are written in the same style; all\r\nhave the same grammatical blunders, the same misspelled words, the same\r\nerrors in punctuation, the same eccentric quirks of phraseology. After\r\nplowing through fifty or so of these stories (and we often read that many\r\nin an evening), a man acquires the dazed impression that all are written\r\nby the same person. It’s baffling! Why do the minds of these various\r\ntypes of people, living in different parts of the world and moving in\r\ndissimilar walks of life, slide comfortably into the same well-worn\r\ngroove whenever they put their thoughts on paper? We give it up.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have that off our chest, we’ll talk of something less\r\ninexplicable and more delightful—namely, the Success of WEIRD TALES.\r\nThat WEIRD TALES _is_ a success there seems no gainsaying now. When we\r\nmade our bow with the first issue we were hopeful, yet not certain,\r\nof a cordial reception. With the second issue, our uncertainty began\r\nto vanish. And now, with this the third number of WEIRD TALES, we can\r\nhappily announce that we’re here to stay. WEIRD TALES has “caught on”\r\neven more quickly than we hoped it would. The reaction of the public\r\nindicates that a vast multitude of people had long been waiting for just\r\nthis sort of magazine.\r\n\r\nWe find a like indication in the enormous number of letters from\r\ndelighted readers. We expected some such response, but we scarcely hoped\r\nfor this multiplicity! We’re fairly deluged with these encomiums—and a\r\nlittle bewildered, too, and not quite sure which ones to choose for The\r\nEyrie and which to leave out. Perhaps, then, we’d best shut our eyes and\r\ngrab a handful at random....\r\n\r\nWe open our eyes and discover this:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Sir and Friend: Many times in the past I have been\r\n    tempted to write different editors, telling them how I enjoyed\r\n    certain stories. But always something restrained me. As I read\r\n    almost every fiction magazine published in America, you will\r\n    understand how often I have wanted to compliment them.\r\n\r\n    “Last night I saw a copy of your new magazine and bought one.\r\n    Although I had an early rehearsal at the theatre this morning,\r\n    I started at the first story AND NEVER LAID IT DOWN UNTIL I HAD\r\n    READ THE LAST LINE OF THE LAST STORY!\r\n\r\n    “I can truthfully say I never dreamed a magazine could contain\r\n    what I call 100 per cent stories. The thing that is worrying\r\n    me now is the long wait until next month and the arrival of\r\n    the next issue. Dear Mr. Editor, why not a weekly? It is the\r\n    ONE magazine I wish were a daily! I am going to boost it\r\n    to all my friends, as I am sure they will be glad I called\r\n    their attention to it.... I feel you have undertaken a brave\r\n    proposition, and there must be many thousands of others who\r\n    will await its arrival just as anxiously as I.\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion, let me thank you for your dauntless courage\r\n    and express the sincere hope that you may never weaken. Always\r\n    count me as one of your very best boosters for this absolutely\r\n    wonderful magazine, and always believe me to be\r\n\r\n    “One who admires courage and determination,\r\n\r\n                                                 “L. William Pitzer,\r\n\r\n    “Director, Girard Avenue Theatre Co., Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\nThat serves very neatly for a starter, does it not? In fact, we doubt\r\nif the Editor himself could have written a more fervid panegyric! Mr.\r\nPitzer, we gather, is even more feverishly absorbed in WEIRD TALES than\r\nwe are—and we thought we were rather interested in it. What he says about\r\npublishing it every week is interesting, but as for a _daily_—Heaven help\r\nus! The man doesn’t live who could do it!\r\n\r\nOf compelling charm is the following communication, postmarked Vera Cruz,\r\nMexico, from Charles M. Boone, Third Officer of the Steamship _Yumuri_:\r\n\r\n    “Editor, WEIRD TALES: I, acting on a ‘hunch,’ purchased your\r\n    March issue in Brooklyn, along with other reading matter for\r\n    sea use, and your publication was so far in advance of the\r\n    others that I could not resist a letter to you expressing my\r\n    appreciation and wishing WEIRD TALES a long and prosperous\r\n    voyage on the sea of literature, and with just such precious\r\n    cargo as is carried in the March issue.\r\n\r\n    “I work and live on the Yumuri, a tramp steamer out of New\r\n    Orleans. New Orleans, as you know, was requisitioned by you\r\n    people ‘up there,’ some years ago, to fasten the other end of\r\n    the I. C. R. R. to, and now New Orleans requisitions us to\r\n    carry your freight away as rapidly as possible so that you\r\n    can’t push her overboard into the Gulf by using said railroad\r\n    as a handspike. You can gather from this that at present I have\r\n    no fixed address for mailing purposes, such as I would need to\r\n    have you mail WEIRD TALES to me regularly, but I am enclosing\r\n    price of April number, and if you will kindly have same mailed\r\n    to me at address given I’ll feel greatly obliged, and can\r\n    arrange with some newsdealer in New Orleans to save an issue\r\n    for me each month.\r\n\r\n    “Your magazine (the only copy on board) is slowly making the\r\n    rounds of the ship. So far, everybody is favorably impressed,\r\n    except the cat and the goat, and those who have not read it are\r\n    lined up awaiting their turn. At present the Old Man (skipper)\r\n    is locked in his cabin, submerged in ‘A Dead Man’s Tale,’ and\r\n    he swears he will shoot anyone that interrupts him. As he is a\r\n    veteran of four wars, has a .45 Colts, a bad ‘rep,’ and is able\r\n    to swear in every known (and several unknown) tongues, it is a\r\n    pretty safe bet that he won’t be disturbed, and that you will\r\n    have another ‘fan’ as soon as he comes up for air.\r\n\r\n    “It has given the first officer, Mr. Henkleman, the ‘jimmies.’\r\n    Mr. Weeks, the second officer, joins me in expressing his\r\n    appreciation of your efforts, and wishes me to say to you\r\n    that he will gladly do anything in his power to further the\r\n    interests of your publication.... Our mess boy says you ought\r\n    to be arrested. You see, he stole some time off to read Mr.\r\n    Rud’s yarn. He was supposed to be on duty, but was found by the\r\n    steward (his immediate superior) in an unused state room (where\r\n    he thought he would be safe from discovery) while deep in the\r\n    story. The steward threw the door open suddenly—just as the\r\n    boy reached the climax—and I guess he thought one of Mr. Rud’s\r\n    monsters had him!\r\n\r\n    “WEIRD TALES is doing good on board, too. We have had a little\r\n    trouble in getting one hombre to respond quickly to fire and\r\n    boat drill signal. Today the alarm was sounded while he was in\r\n    the midst of a yarn, and, although his quarters are far removed\r\n    from Assembly, he beat every mother’s son to the lifeboats. We\r\n    have a cargo of gunpowder and dynamite on board, consigned to\r\n    Vera Cruz, where this letter will be mailed, and that may have\r\n    helped some, but I believe that your magazine was the prime\r\n    impulse....”\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal more to the foregoing letter, but at least we’ve\r\nquoted enough to show that all on board the _Yumuri_, except the goat\r\nand cat, seem to be enjoying WEIRD TALES—and when the crew and officers\r\nare through with it they’ll probably throw it at the cat or feed it to\r\nthe goat. Seafaring men, as a rule, are excellent judges of fiction;\r\nwherefore the praise of Third Officer Boone pleases us immensely.\r\n\r\nHere’s a breezy digest of the March issue from George F. Morgan, 680\r\nNorth Vine Street, Hazleton, Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Editor of Hair-Exercising Tales: The other evening,\r\n    while looking over some magazines at my favorite book store,\r\n    I happened to notice your March issue of WEIRD TALES, and the\r\n    title at once seemed to strike me as being something different,\r\n    so I immediately bade a genuine American quarter good-by and\r\n    took a copy along home with me. I wish to state right now that\r\n    I got two-dimes-and-a-nickel’s worth of well-balanced thrills\r\n    out of that issue and would be willing to pay the war tax on it\r\n    also.\r\n\r\n    “‘The Dead Man’s Tale’ was real interesting, and it is only\r\n    too true that stories of that type are nearly as scarce as\r\n    the guinea pig’s tail. The terrible creature in ‘Ooze’ was as\r\n    horrible if not worse than some of the snakes in home-made\r\n    Booze. Dad lost two nights’ sleep trying to figure out what\r\n    ‘The Thing of a Thousand Shapes’ could really be. Guess he’ll\r\n    have to wait till April, like the rest of us poor guessers.\r\n\r\n    “‘The Mystery of Black Jean’ sure was a bear of a story, but it\r\n    is sad that the notorious hero should end up in a lime factory.\r\n    Uncle Mart (who works in the coal mines) read ‘The Grave,’ and\r\n    it sure must have scared him, because he is now working outside\r\n    in the weather. Baby let the rattle fall while Ma was reading\r\n    ‘Hark! The Rattle!’ and it took all the smelling salts on hand\r\n    to bring her to.\r\n\r\n    “It’s a good idea to have lots of lamps in the room before\r\n    beginning a story like ‘The Ghost Guard,’ and be sure they\r\n    are filled with a good grade of oil, ’cause if they should go\r\n    out in the middle of such a story Lord only knows what would\r\n    happen! Stories like ‘The Ghoul and the Corpse’ have the same\r\n    effect on your back as twenty below zero. Ma read ‘Weaving\r\n    Shadows’ out loud, and sister’s beau went home at ten-thirty.\r\n    Sister wondered why he didn’t stay till twelve, as was his\r\n    custom.\r\n\r\n    “Dad gave our copy of WEIRD TALES to the neighbor’s kids, and\r\n    Mrs. Murphy is still wondering why they get the evening supply\r\n    of coal up from the cellar so early.”\r\n\r\nQuite a family affair, we’ll say; and (assuming that George isn’t kidding\r\nus) isn’t it amazing how much disturbance a single copy of W. T. can\r\ncreate in a peaceful neighborhood?\r\n\r\nEspecially gratifying to the business office (likewise to your Ed.) are\r\nletters such as this:\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: The other day, as I stopped at a nearby newsstand, I\r\n    noticed a copy of the March issue of WEIRD TALES. As I am much\r\n    interested in the type of story which this magazine presents,\r\n    and continually on the lookout for new magazines of all kinds,\r\n    I immediately bought one.\r\n\r\n    “‘Do you know,’ said the dealer, ‘it is surprising how that\r\n    magazine has sold. I took six copies this morning, wondering if\r\n    they would sell. You have just bought the sixth. Next time I\r\n    can judge my order better.’\r\n\r\n    “I have read the issue, and I wish to congratulate you on your\r\n    initiative in putting before the reading public stories such\r\n    as it is almost impossible to obtain elsewhere. Several of my\r\n    friends, who have picked up the copy, after reading some of\r\n    the stories, have expressed their approval and wishes for a\r\n    continued success.\r\n\r\n                                “James P. Marshall,\r\n                                “409 Marlboro Street, Boston, Mass.”\r\n\r\nThanks! If there is any one thing that pleases us more than printing\r\nexceptional stories in WEIRD TALES it is the news that a dealer is\r\nselling _all_ his quota. It wounds us grievously to see unsold copies\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nEarl L. Bell of Augusta, Georgia, writes us:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Baird: Just a few lines to tell you how I enjoyed\r\n    the natal issue of WEIRD TALES. For years I have been looking\r\n    for just such a periodical. I’m tired of reading magazines\r\n    that cater to the type of stuff that milady likes to read as\r\n    she lies in bed, holds the periodical with one hand and feeds\r\n    chocolates to a poodle with the other.\r\n\r\n    “I have often remarked that Poe’s stories, if written today\r\n    instead of many years ago, would be dubbed pure rot by most of\r\n    the American magazines. The editors admit that Poe’s horror\r\n    tales are among the most gripping stories ever penned. Then why\r\n    is it they taboo such stories today?\r\n\r\n    “I think you have the right trail. Especially thrilling and\r\n    well-written were ‘The Ghoul and the Corpse’ and ‘The Young\r\n    Man Who Wanted to Die.’ For sheer imagery, word-pictures and\r\n    mastery of style, both stories reached perihelion.”\r\n\r\nWe, too, have often wondered why other magazines shun the sort of stories\r\nthat we gladly accept; and it is not unlikely that if Poe were living\r\ntoday he would find no market for his work except in WEIRD TALES. The\r\nreason for this we do not know (and we don’t know that we care a damn),\r\nbut we do know this: In editing WEIRD TALES we follow no precedent, bow\r\nto no custom, honor no tradition. When we took this job we chucked all\r\nthose things in the waste-basket and told the janitor to dump them in the\r\nrubbish heap. We started out to blaze a new path in magazine literature,\r\nand we’re going to do it, or die in the effort.\r\n\r\nAnd while we’re on this topic we must quote a few lines in a letter from\r\nProfessor George W. Crane of the Department of Psychology at Northwestern\r\nUniversity:\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: I am writing to express my keen appreciation of\r\n    WEIRD TALES. I read some months ago that it was to be published\r\n    soon, and I looked forward with great interest toward reading\r\n    the first number. It answers a definite lack in modern magazine\r\n    fiction, and one which is wholesome.\r\n\r\n    “The type of story which you feature is not immoral, but is\r\n    very stimulating, and forms a pleasing diversion to me from\r\n    heavier and more abstract material. Mr. Rud’s tale, ‘Ooze,’ is\r\n    extremely bizarre, and I am recommending it to my colleague in\r\n    the faculty of the Department of Zoology. I will predict, from\r\n    the analysis of human interests, that WEIRD TALES will have a\r\n    tremendous success.”\r\n\r\nWe need only add that Professor Crane is a gifted prophet; for his\r\nprediction is rapidly being fulfilled.\r\n\r\nEqually germane to the subject we’re discussing is the following letter\r\nfrom Edward Schultz, 335 Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, New York:\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: I have had the pleasure of very recently discovering\r\n    your delightful publication, WEIRD TALES. I do not know whether\r\n    it is the first issue or not, but I do know that I shall never\r\n    miss a future issue if the March number is any standard of\r\n    those to follow. Of about twenty or more periodicals to which I\r\n    subscribe, WEIRD TALES is the only one that I somehow find time\r\n    to read from cover to cover.\r\n\r\n    “Being a great admirer of the late Edgar Allen Poe, whose\r\n    works I have read many times over, I was more than agreeably\r\n    surprised to find his matchless style abound in WEIRD TALES.\r\n\r\n    “Allow me to congratulate you on your innovation, which I shall\r\n    heartily recommend to my friends. But please keep it as it\r\n    is—keep out plain and overworked stuff about detectives, wild\r\n    west, etc. There are a great number of us who want weirdness to\r\n    the nth power in our recreational reading. I shall eagerly look\r\n    forward to the April issue.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe’ve just grabbed another fistful of letters, and the first one we open\r\nis this:\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: At last a fiction magazine that is different!\r\n    Congratulations! You are correct—people do like to read this\r\n    kind of fiction.\r\n\r\n    “You asked us to mention the stories we liked and those we\r\n    didn’t like so well. I enjoyed, in their order, ‘The Thing of a\r\n    Thousand Shapes,’ which still has me in suspense, ‘The Place of\r\n    Madness,’ ‘The Weaving Shadows,’ ‘The Grave,’ ‘The Skull,’ ‘The\r\n    Extraordinary Experiment of Dr. Calgroni.’\r\n\r\n    “‘The Basket,’ I thought rather pointless. The plot of ‘Ooze’\r\n    excellent, but just a trifle above the average reader to\r\n    understand in detail. ‘The Chain’ was too long drawn out.\r\n\r\n    “And do give us less of unfaithful wives and husbands. I may\r\n    seem too critical, perhaps, but let me say that I wish the\r\n    magazine were published twice a month, for how refreshing to\r\n    find that interesting stories can be written without ‘love\r\n    interest.’ Please leave that to the movies and to the countless\r\n    other magazines.”—S. A. N.\r\n\r\nAnd the next is from Richard P. Israel, 620 Riverside Drive, New York\r\nCity:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Sir: Have just finished reading your new magazine, WEIRD\r\n    TALES, and would like to say it’s a peach. It is just the kind\r\n    that wakes a man up after he has put in a hard day’s work....\r\n    Could you possibly run some snappy, spooky baseball stories? I\r\n    am sure that almost everybody will like them, baseball being\r\n    our national game.”\r\n\r\nWe don’t remember ever seeing anything spooky in baseball; and yet—who\r\nknows?—perhaps Mr. Israel can tell us something about the ghosts that\r\nhaunt the Cubs.\r\n\r\nA. L. Richard, 9234 Cottage Grove Avenue, Chicago, knows what he likes\r\nand doesn’t like, and he doesn’t hesitate to speak right out in meeting.\r\nAs witness:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Baird: May I congratulate you as a delighted reader\r\n    of your excellent magazine? You can not wish more for its\r\n    success than I do, for I have long felt the need of such a\r\n    periodical. So much of the mental feed given us by other\r\n    editors is fit only for infants. We red-blooded men want\r\n    something that stirs the sterner emotions. We want to be scared\r\n    stiff. Too many of us think nothing can make us afraid; your\r\n    stories will fill us with terror. Some of us are too lazy and\r\n    sleep more than we should; your tales will keep us awake more\r\n    of the time and thus give us more pep and vim, and makes our\r\n    lives worth living.\r\n\r\n    “Most of the stories in your first number are excellent; some\r\n    few rather indifferent. To my mind the best were ‘The Dead\r\n    Man’s Tale,’ ‘Ooze,’ ‘The Extraordinary Experiment of Dr.\r\n    Calgroni’ (although the transferring of a brain from one person\r\n    to another was done some time ago in another story) and ‘The\r\n    Skull.’ ‘Hark! the Rattle!’ I thought a trifle too rhetorical\r\n    and exclamatory; ‘Nimba, the Cave Girl’ not properly a weird\r\n    tale; ‘The Ghost Guard’ not quite convincing; and ‘The Sequel’\r\n    no improvement on Poe.\r\n\r\n    “But these are my own personal likes and dislikes; I have no\r\n    doubt that many others of your readers preferred the very\r\n    tales that did not impress me. On the whole, you are to be\r\n    felicitated on your venture, and I hope that WEIRD TALES will\r\n    enjoy enormous sales. If most people think as I do, it will.”\r\n\r\nAnalytical, too, is Miss Violet Olive Johnson, who writes to us from\r\nPortland, Oregon:\r\n\r\n    “I think ‘The Accusing Voice’ is of the best, because the\r\n    denouement is so unexpected, yet so logical. I liked ‘Hark! the\r\n    Rattle’ on account of its touch of fantasy. ‘The Dead Man’s\r\n    Tale’ was a masterpiece, I thought. And it’s right in line with\r\n    modern spiritualism, too. It conveys quite a definite lesson in\r\n    regeneration, even if it does deal with a disembodied spirit. I\r\n    agree with Anthony M. Rud, in The Eyrie, that such a magazine\r\n    as WEIRD TALES is not only clean, but contains the ingredients\r\n    of wholesome, moral lessons. And it certainly is unique and\r\n    hair-raising. I didn’t experience a dull moment!”\r\n\r\nAt the risk of emulating the talented authors of patent medicine almanacs\r\nand overlapping the space vouchsafed The Eyrie, we must quote a few brief\r\nexcerpts from a few of the letters we got in that second grab:\r\n\r\n    “... Some of the tales made me shiver when I read them here\r\n    alone at night.... Two things in particular I like about your\r\n    magazine: the very large number of short stories and the fact\r\n    that there is only one serial.... But there is one thing I\r\n    don’t favor: the sensational, blood-and-thunder titles of some\r\n    of the stories. Something like ‘The Accusing Voice,’ ‘The\r\n    Place of Madness,’ ‘The Weaving Shadows,’ is ‘woolly’ enough\r\n    for most of us, I should say. ‘The Skull,’ ‘The Ghoul and the\r\n    Corpse,’ ‘The Grave,’ are all too—you see what I mean?”—F. L.\r\n    K., Indianapolis.\r\n\r\n    “I have just finished the first installment of ‘The Thing of\r\n    a Thousand Shapes.’ It is fine, and any one who has a good\r\n    imagination should not ‘start it late at night.’ I want to\r\n    congratulate you on your fine magazine.”—Victor Wilson, Hazen,\r\n    Pa.\r\n\r\n    “... Just finished reading the first number, and I agree with\r\n    Mr. Anthony M. Rud that this magazine should be welcomed by\r\n    the public. I have often wondered why it was that the ordinary\r\n    magazine would not publish out-of-the-ordinary stories—that is,\r\n    stories of the occult or weird.... One thing I know: the name\r\n    of Edgar Allen Poe will live long after the names of some of\r\n    the writers of commonplace fiction are forgotten.”—J. O. O’C.,\r\n    Raleigh, N. C.\r\n\r\n    “... May I add my congratulations on the success of your work\r\n    which resulted in that first number of WEIRD TALES? To choose\r\n    a name for a new magazine and then live up to that name so\r\n    thoroughly is hardly ever done so well. I shall look for future\r\n    numbers of the magazine with interest.”—R. M., St. Petersburg,\r\n    Fla.\r\n\r\n    “... Truly, I never read such weird tales before, and I am\r\n    anxious to read more....”—Harry M. Worth, Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n    “... It offers the utmost in thrilling fiction and a\r\n    pleasurable excursion from this land of realism. I wish you the\r\n    greatest success and am looking forward anxiously to your next\r\n    copy.”—Mrs. Glenn Thompson Cummings, Lansing, Mich.\r\n\r\n    “I am a lover of all fiction that deals with the\r\n    supernatural.... I eagerly devoured your March issue from\r\n    cover to cover.... The story that impressed me the most\r\n    was ‘The Ghost Guard,’ as it was a combination of the\r\n    practical and supernatural, blended together in an exciting\r\n    narrative....”—Dean Smith.\r\n\r\n    “... I am a soldier in the Coast Artillery and am stationed on\r\n    an island twenty-five miles from land.... The news company\r\n    that furnishes our post exchange with magazines sent one copy\r\n    of your magazine, and I bought it right away.... I think it is\r\n    the best book I ever read.... You have made a wonderful start,\r\n    and if they are all as good each month you may be sure I will\r\n    never miss a copy....”—Private R. S. Bray, 133d Co. Detachment,\r\n    Fort Terry, N. Y.\r\n\r\nWhen we began writing the copy for this month’s Eyrie we thought we’d\r\nend it with some pertinent remarks on a matter that has aroused our\r\ncuriosity—to-wit: the preponderance of cats and Chinamen in weird\r\nliterature—but we’ll have to let it go. No space. You’ll find it in The\r\nEyrie for June, however.\r\n\r\nYou will also find, in the June WEIRD TALES, some of the most amazing\r\nshort stories and novelettes that ever swam into our ken. Three of them\r\nin particular we earnestly recommend. They are more startling than any\r\nwe’ve ever published—and we can’t say more than that.\r\n\r\n                                                               THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFinding “The Fountain of Youth”\r\n\r\n_A Long-Sought Secret, Vital to Happiness, Has Been Discovered._\r\n\r\n_By H. M. Stunz_\r\n\r\n    _Alas! that spring should vanish with the rose!_\r\n    _That youth’s sweet-scented manuscript should close!_\r\n                                         —OMAR KHAYYAM.\r\n\r\nA secret vital to human happiness has been discovered. An ancient problem\r\nwhich, sooner or later, affects the welfare of virtually every man and\r\nwoman, has been solved. As this problem undoubtedly will come to you\r\neventually, if it has not come already, I urge you to read this article\r\ncarefully. It may give you information of a value beyond all price.\r\n\r\nThis newly-revealed secret is not a new “philosophy” of financial\r\nsuccess. It is not a political panacea. It has to do with something of\r\nfar greater moment to the individual—success and happiness in love and\r\nmarriage—and there is nothing theoretical, imaginative or fantastic\r\nabout it, because it comes from the coldly exact realms of science and\r\nits value has been proved. It “works.” And because it does work—surely,\r\nspeedily and most delightfully—it is one of the most important\r\ndiscoveries made in many years. Thousands already bless it for having\r\nrescued them from lives of disappointment and misery. Millions will\r\nrejoice because of it in years to come.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar value of this discovery is that it removes physical\r\nhandicaps which, in the past, have been considered inevitable and\r\nirremediable. I refer to the loss of youthful animation and a\r\nwaning of the vital forces. These difficulties have caused untold\r\nunhappiness—failures, shattered romances, mysterious divorces. True\r\nhappiness does not depend on wealth, position or fame. Primarily, it is\r\na matter of health. Not the inefficient, “half-alive” condition which\r\nordinarily passes as “health,” but the abundant, vibrant, magnetic\r\nvitality of superb manhood and womanhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this kind of health is rare. Our civilization, with its\r\nwear and tear, rapidly depletes the organism and, in a physical sense,\r\nold age comes on when life should be at its prime.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a tragedy of our era alone. Ages ago a Persian poet,\r\nin the world’s most melodious epic of pessimism, voiced humanity’s\r\nimmemorial complaint that “spring should vanish with the rose” and the\r\nsong of youth too soon come to an end. And for centuries before Omar\r\nKhayyam wrote his immortal verses, science had searched—and in the\r\ncenturies that have passed since then has continued to search—without\r\nhalt, for the fabled “fountain of youth,” an infallible method of\r\nrenewing energy lost or depleted by disease, overwork, worry, excesses or\r\nadvancing age.\r\n\r\nNow the long search has been rewarded. A “fountain of youth” has been\r\nfound! Science announces unconditionally that youthful vigor can be\r\nrestored quickly and safely. Lives clouded by weakness can be illumined\r\nby the sunlight of health and joy. Old age, in a sense, can be kept at\r\nbay and youth made more glorious than ever. And the discovery which makes\r\nthese amazing results possible is something any man or woman, young or\r\nold, can easily use in the privacy of the home, unknown to relative,\r\nfriend or acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe discovery had its origin in famous European laboratories. Brought to\r\nAmerica, it was developed into a product that has given most remarkable\r\nresults in thousands of cases, many of which had defied all other\r\ntreatments. In scientific circles the discovery has been known and used\r\nfor several years and has caused unbounded amazement by its quick,\r\nharmless, gratifying action. Now in convenient tablet form, under the\r\nname of Korex compound, it is available to the general public.\r\n\r\nAny one who finds the youthful stamina ebbing, life losing its charm\r\nand color or the feebleness of old age coming on too soon, can obtain\r\na double-strength treatment of this compound, sufficient for ordinary\r\ncases, under a positive guarantee that it costs nothing if it fails and\r\nonly $2 if it produces prompt and gratifying results. In average cases,\r\nthe compound often brings about amazing benefits in from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nSimply write in confidence to the Melton Laboratories, 833 Massachusetts\r\nBldg., Kansas City, Mo., and this wonder restorative will be mailed to\r\nyou in a plain wrapper. You may enclose $2 or, if you prefer, just send\r\nyour name without money and pay the postman $2 and postage when the\r\nparcel is delivered. In either case, if you report after a week that the\r\nKorex compound has not given satisfactory results, your money will be\r\nrefunded immediately. The Melton Laboratories are nationally known and\r\nthoroughly reliable. Moreover, their offer is fully guaranteed, so no\r\none need hesitate to accept it.

No wife for me unless she could play some instrument,\r\nand play it well. My new home must have no dull, bored evenings, no\r\nmonotonous Sunday afternoons. I wanted the gaiety, the mental and\r\nphysical stimulus, the whole-hearted, genuine joy of music. No girl could\r\ncapture me without the lure of musical skill.\r\n\r\nBut one day Beth came along knowing not one note from another, yet with a\r\nmerry, humming tune forever on her lips, and a song in her heart for me.\r\nAnd Beth is Mrs. Taylor today. A piano graced our new home, but somehow\r\nthe old vow was forgotten, and stayed forgotten until Jimmy Jr., and Beth\r\nNo. 2 were quite some youngsters.\r\n\r\nThen along about the time the novelty of parenthood began to wear off a\r\nbit, the old vow came back. And one evening I spoke out with a suddenness\r\nthat surprised me, “Beth, I’d give a hundred dollars if you could play\r\nsomething—a piano, violin, banjo, ukulele—something, _anything_.” Beth\r\nlooked so hurt I was immediately ashamed of myself, so I said no more,\r\nand the matter dropped, as I thought regretfully, forever.\r\n\r\nAbout three months later I got home early one night, and I heard the\r\nold dead piano come to life—sounded good, too, first a little jazzy\r\npiece, then a sweet plantation melody. “Company to supper; I wonder\r\nwho?” I thought; and I crept to the parlor door to see. There at the\r\npiano was _Beth_ playing, and the two kiddies beating time. She saw me,\r\nand stopped, “Oh,” she cried, “I’m so sorry!” “Believe me, I’m not,” I\r\nshouted, and I grabbed the whole family up in my arms.\r\n\r\n“But, Jim, I wanted to wait and surprise you when I could really play.\r\nI’m learning fast, but it’s only three months since I found out”—“Found\r\nout what?” I said. Beth began to cry. “I know!” Jimmy, Jr., piped up,\r\n“Mother found out the way to learn music just like I am learning to read\r\nin school—only lots easier.”\r\n\r\nWell, that little musical party lasted all the evening. It was a howling\r\nsuccess. When the kiddies had gone singing to bed, my wife showed me the\r\nmarvelous new method by which she had learned to play in three months’\r\nspare time.\r\n\r\nJimmy Jr. had told the truth; the method was so simple and easy that any\r\none at all from 8 years up could learn by it. By this method the U. S.\r\nSchool of Music, the largest in the world, has already trained over three\r\nhundred thousand people, teaching the playing of any musical instrument\r\nalmost in the same way a school-child learns to read. But very much\r\nfaster because older children and grown people have better trained minds,\r\nand know how to study and think.\r\n\r\nWhen first learning to read you look at every letter separately and spell\r\nout every word, c-a-t, m-a-n. Later you do not see the letters; you see\r\nthe words as units, “cat,” “man.” By and by longer words become units\r\nto you, and you find that whole _expressions_, like “up the steps,”\r\n“on the train,” no longer are seen as separate words, but immediately,\r\nat one instant, without spelling, without thinking words, you see each\r\nexpression in the unit form.\r\n\r\nThis skill in seeing in units develops until you see and know as units\r\nhundreds of long familiar phrases; and it is even entirely possible,\r\nif you wish, to easily increase your reading speed four or five times\r\nthe average, grasping paragraph thoughts complete, sensing a whole page\r\ninstantly, recognizing every part, registering and remembering all, with\r\nyour pleasure exactly the same as the slower reader.\r\n\r\nThe same easy understanding and complete enjoyment is similarly a part of\r\nthe new way. The alphabet of music follows the alphabet of language. Each\r\nnote is a letter, and playing is practically spelling the notes together\r\ncorrectly. The first note on the staff above is F. Whether you sing or\r\nplay, it is always F. The four notes shown above are F-A-C-E, easy to\r\nremember because they spell “face.” Certain strings on mandolin, certain\r\nkeys on piano, certain parts of all instruments, are these same notes.\r\nOnce you learn them, playing melodies is a matter of _acting_ what you\r\n_see_.\r\n\r\nAnd here is where “familiar phrases” come in—the “big secret.” It is so\r\nsimple you probably have already guessed it. The “familiar phrases” of\r\nmusic are its harmonies. Just as you instantly recognize the countless\r\nphrases of speech, so the relatively few of music are quickly a habit\r\nwith you. You play almost before you realize it—and every step is real\r\nfun, fascinating, simple, interesting, almost too good to be true.\r\n\r\nRemember, neither my wife nor most of the 300,000 other musicians trained\r\nby this method knew anything about music. Beth mastered the piano; she\r\ncould just as easily have mastered anything else. Jimmy, Jr., is now\r\ntaking up violin, and my daughter is learning singing. Right at home,\r\nno costly teacher, no classes at inconvenient hours, no useless study\r\nand practice. No numbers, no tricks, no makeshifts. But instead a sound\r\nmusical education learning by notes. The intricacies of music reduced to\r\na most amazing simplicity able to develop the inborn talent, which is a\r\npart of every person on this earth.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Beth I was writing this out to put in a magazine she told\r\nme to be sure and say that the school will gladly send a free book\r\nexplaining everything, called “Music Lessons in Your Own Home,” and that\r\nright now there is a special short time Reduced Price Offer being made to\r\nmusic lovers. The book is free; asking for it obligates you not at all,\r\nbut you should send for it right away before all copies may be gone.\r\n\r\n                                                          JAMES W.
