NASSELLARIA,\r\n\r\nVEL MONOPYLEA, VEL MONOPYLARIA (PLS. 51-98).\r\n\r\n  _Nassellaria_ (_inclusis_ Spyridinis), Ehrenberg, 1875.\r\n  _Monopylea_, Hertwig, 1879.\r\n  _Monopylaria_, Haeckel, 1881.\r\n  _Cyrtida_ et _Acanthodesmida_, Haeckel, 1862.\r\n  _Cricoidea_, Bütschli, 1882 (L. N. 40, p. 537) = NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Radiolaria with simple membrane of the central capsule,\r\nwhich is monaxon or bilateral, and bears on one pole of the main axis a\r\nporous area (porochora), forming the base of a peculiar intracapsular cone\r\n(podoconus). Extracapsulum without phæodium. Skeleton siliceous, very\r\nrarely wanting. Fundamental form originally monaxon, often dipleuric or\r\nbilateral.\r\n\r\nThe legion NASSELLARIA vel MONOPYLEA, in the extent here defined, was\r\nconstituted in 1879 by Richard Hertwig in his work Der Organismus der\r\nRadiolarien (pp. 133-137). He gave to this large group the rank of an\r\norder, and united in it the two families Acanthodesmida and Cyrtida, which\r\nI had constituted first in 1862 in my Monograph (pp. 237, 265, 272); but he\r\nadded, too, as a third family the Plagiacanthida, united by me with the\r\nformer. In the first system of Ehrenberg (1847, _loc. cit._, pp. 53, 54),\r\nfour families belonging to the MONOPYLEA were enumerated, the\r\nHalicalyptrina, Lithochytrina, Eucyrtidina, and Spyridina. He united the\r\nthree former under the name \"Polycystina solitaria,\" which he afterwards\r\nchanged into NASSELLARIA (1875, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p.\r\n157).\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph of the Radiolaria (1862, pp. 265-345) forty-four genera of\r\nNASSELLARIA were enumerated (six Acanthodesmida and thirty-eight Cyrtida),\r\nwhilst the total number of genera in the whole class of Radiolaria at that\r\ntime amounted to one hundred and thirteen. But owing to the astonishing\r\nnumber of new and interesting forms of this legion which I afterwards\r\ndetected in the collection of the Challenger, in 1881 I distinguished in my\r\nProdromus not less than three hundred and seventeen genera. These were\r\ndisposed in five large main groups, retained in the present Report, with\r\ntwenty-six families, viz., (1) #Plectoidea# (with three families), (2)\r\n#Stephoidea# (with four families), (3) #Spyroidea# (with four families),\r\n(4) #Botryodea# (with three families), and (5) #Cyrtoidea# (with twelve\r\nfamilies). The first two groups have an incomplete or rudimentary skeleton,\r\nand may be united in the order #Plectellaria#, whilst the other three\r\nfamilies possess a complete latticed shell, and {890}may be united as\r\n#Cyrtellaria#. The former correspond to the Acanthodesmida, the latter to\r\nthe Cyrtida in my Monograph.\r\n\r\nThe character common to all MONOPYLEA or NASSELLARIA, which separates them\r\nfrom all other Radiolaria, was first recognised by Richard Hertwig in 1879,\r\nand consists in the singular structure of the monaxonian central capsule,\r\nbearing on the basal pole a peculiar porous area or operculum, the\r\n\"Porenfeld;\" we call it shortly the \"porochora.\" It represents a circular\r\nor elliptical porous plate on the basal pole of the vertical main axis of\r\nthe central capsule, and bears a peculiar \"podoconus\" or\r\n\"Pseudopodien-Kegel,\" a conical body of singular structure, protruding\r\ninside the membrane into the capsule. The pseudopodia arising from this\r\npeculiar \"podoconus\" proceed from the capsule piercing the \"porochora,\"\r\nwhilst the other parts of the capsule are not perforated.\r\n\r\nThe MONOPYLEA are therefore \"Merotrypasta,\" like the following fourth\r\nlegion, the PHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA. But in these latter we find on the\r\nbasal pole of the monaxonian capsule only one single large main opening,\r\nprolonged into a peculiar tube, and there is no trace of the typical\r\n\"podoconus,\" characteristic of all NASSELLARIA. The latter agree, however,\r\nwith the former in the possession of a basal opening, serving for the\r\nemission of the pseudopodia, and in the monaxonian fundamental form,\r\narising from this structure. Therefore these two legions of \"Merotrypasta\"\r\nexhibit a wider divergence from the ACANTHARIA and SPUMELLARIA, the two\r\nlegions of \"Holotrypasta,\" in which the central capsule is everywhere\r\nperforated by innumerable small pores (compare above, pp. 5, 6, 716).\r\n\r\n_The Skeleton_ in all NASSELLARIA consists either of pure silica, or of a\r\npeculiar silicate; never of acanthin (as in all ACANTHARIA). The siliceous\r\nbars and beams constituting it are invariably solid (as also in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA); never hollow (as in the PHÆODARIA). In the small family of\r\nNassellida alone (with the two genera _Cystidium_ and _Nassella_) the\r\nskeleton is entirely absent. In all other genera of NASSELLARIA the\r\nsiliceous skeleton is more or less developed; imperfect, or quite\r\nrudimentary in the #Plectellaria# (#Plectoidea# and #Stephoidea#), but\r\nperfect and forming a regular lattice-shell in the #Cyrtellaria#\r\n(#Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and #Cyrtoidea#). The different forms of this\r\nskeleton exhibit an extraordinary variety, but may be reduced to a few very\r\nsimple fundamental forms, or even to a single, most simple original form.\r\nThe comparative morphology is more interesting, but also more difficult to\r\nunderstand than in any other Radiolaria.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical fundamental form of the skeleton is in all NASSELLARIA\r\nmonaxonial, the vertical main axis of the body, which is already indicated\r\nby the axis of the central capsule with two different poles, being also\r\nexpressed constantly in the form of the skeleton. The lower or basal pole\r\nof the latter always exhibits a different shape from that of the upper or\r\napical pole. This difference is so striking in nearly all MONOPYLEA, that\r\nthe two poles may be determined on the first view.\r\n\r\n{891}In the great majority of NASSELLARIA not only is the monaxonial\r\nfundamental form expressed, but also the dipleuric or bilateral, so that\r\nthe symmetrical halves of the body may be easily determined; the right and\r\nleft halves exhibit the same symmetry as in the vertebrates, so that we may\r\ndistinguish an anterior ventral and a posterior dorsal face of the body.\r\nThe whole form is in this case determined by three dimensive axes,\r\nperpendicular to one another, two of which are heteropolar, the third is\r\nhomoeopolar. The apical pole of the vertical main axis (principal or\r\nlongitudinal axis) is different from the basal pole. The ventral pole of\r\nthe horizontal sagittal axis (or dorso-ventral axis) is different from the\r\ndorsal pole. The right pole of the horizontal transverse axis (lateral or\r\nfrontal axis) is equal to the left pole. Therefore the sagittal or median\r\nplane of the body (in which the principal and the sagittal axis are\r\ncrossed) divides it into symmetrical equal halves and is perpendicular to\r\nthe frontal axis.\r\n\r\nThree different original elements of structure are recognisable in the\r\nmajority of NASSELLARIA, viz., (1) a vertical simple ring, the primary or\r\nsagittal ring, placed vertically in the sagittal plane and enclosing the\r\nmedian plane of the central capsule; (2) a basal tripod, composed of three\r\ndiverging radial rods, which are united on the basal pole of the central\r\ncapsule and are either expanded horizontally or descend; (3) an ovate or\r\nsubspherical, simple lattice-shell, the cephalis or capitulum, which\r\nsurrounds the central capsule and exhibits a peculiar structure on its\r\nbasal pole.\r\n\r\nThese three important original elements of structure--the sagittal ring,\r\nthe basal tripod, and the latticed cephalis--are so united in the majority\r\nof NASSELLARIA that the cephalis rests upon the tripod and includes the\r\nsagittal ring wholly or partially. The simplest realisation of this typical\r\nunion is afforded by the Archiperida and Tripospyrida, and these may be\r\nderived from the simpler important Stephanid _Cortina_ (Pl. 83, fig. 9; Pl.\r\n92, fig. 21; Pl. 97, fig. 1). In this and in all other tripodal\r\nNASSELLARIA, the three basal rods or the \"cortinar feet\" are constantly so\r\narranged that an odd or posterior rod, the \"caudal foot\" (_c_) is opposed\r\nto the two anterior paired rods, the \"pectoral feet\" (one right, _p_\", and\r\none left, _p_'). The caudal foot lies in the sagittal plane, and is\r\nprolonged upwards into the dorsal rod of the sagittal ring (_b_), and over\r\nthis in a free ascending spine, the \"apical horn\" (_a_). The curved ventral\r\nrod of the ring (_r_) is united above with the base of the apical horn,\r\nbelow with the common centre of the tripod or the \"cortinar centrum.\" The\r\ncharacteristic position of the central capsule in this skeleton of\r\n_Cortina_ is such that its basal pole (with the porochora) rests upon the\r\ncentre of the tripod, whilst its sagittal perimeter is separated from the\r\nsurrounding ring by the calymma; the numerous pseudopodia arising from its\r\nbase diverge downwards and are supported and protected by the three basal\r\nfeet of the tripod (Pl. 97, fig. 1). Compare also Pls. 51, 53, 84, 95, 98.\r\n\r\nThe typical skeleton of _Cortina_, a tripodal ring, becomes more developed\r\nin the Semantid _Cortiniscus_, in which the basal parts of the three\r\ndiverging feet are united {892}by a second horizontal ring, the cortinar or\r\nbasal ring (Pl. 92, figs. 11-13). The pores between the former and the\r\nlatter, or the \"cortinar pores,\" may be regarded as the first beginning of\r\nthe lattice-plate, composing the \"cephalis\" or the simple primordial shell\r\nin the Archiperida and Tripospyrida, and transmitted from these by heredity\r\nto the great majority of NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\nThe \"cephalis or capitulum\" (the \"Köpfchen\" of the German authors) is\r\ntherefore the most important part of the skeleton in all #Cyrtellaria#, or\r\nin all NASSELLARIA possessing a complete lattice-shell. In the\r\n#Plectellaria#, however, or in those NASSELLARIA which do not possess a\r\ncomplete fenestrated shell, the \"cephalis\" is either imperfect or totally\r\nwanting. The cephalis surrounds the enclosed central capsule on all sides\r\nin the form of an ovate or subspherical lattice-shell, and is separated\r\nfrom it only by the jelly-like calymma. The sagittal ring is either\r\nenclosed in the wall of the cephalis (whole or partially), separating its\r\ntwo lateral halves, or it is enclosed in the cavity of the cephalis and\r\nconnected with its sagittal perimeter by short beams. The base of the\r\ncephalis (with the cortinar plate) often rests immediately upon the centre\r\nof the tripod; in the majority of NASSELLARIA, however, this near relation\r\nis altered by reason of later changes and secondary modifications.\r\n\r\nThe number of various forms, developed from these simple original\r\nstructural elements of the skeleton, is astonishing, and there are\r\ndescribed more than three hundred genera and nearly two thousand species of\r\nthis legion in the following pages. This large number may be easily\r\nincreased by subsequent observers. Since in all these MONOPYLEA the\r\ncharacteristic structure of the central capsule is identical, and also the\r\nstructural elements of the siliceous skeleton are similar, it is very\r\nprobable that they may have arisen from a single common stock. But it is\r\nvery difficult (and at present impossible) to explain a natural\r\nmonophyletic system of this large legion. The greatest difficulty is\r\npresented by the fact that the three structural elements mentioned above,\r\nviz., the sagittal ring, the basal tripod, and the latticed cephalis, are\r\nnot constantly united, but each alone may also constitute the skeleton by\r\nitself. In this respect the following seven cases are possible, and are\r\nactually realised.\r\n\r\nA. The skeleton is composed of the sagittal ring only and of its spiny\r\nappendages, without basal tripod and without latticed cephalis. This is the\r\ncase in the majority of #Stephoidea# (Stephanida, Semantida, Coronida, and\r\nTympanida).\r\n\r\nB. The skeleton is composed of a basal tripod only (_Plagiacantha_), or of\r\na tripod in the centre of which arises a vertical apical horn\r\n(_Plagoniscus_), and often of an irregular framework, arising from the rods\r\nof the tripod; but there is neither a trace of a sagittal ring nor a\r\ncomplete latticed cephalis. This is the case in the remarkable suborder\r\n#Plectoidea# (Plagonida and Plectanida).\r\n\r\nC. The skeleton is composed of a latticed cephalis only, a simple ovate or\r\nsubspherical fenestrated shell, which encloses the monopylean central\r\ncapsule; there is no {893}trace of a sagittal ring nor of a basal tripod.\r\nThis is the case in the remarkable family of Cyrtocalpida (Archicorida and\r\nArchicapsida), in numerous #Botryodea# and in other #Cyrtellaria#.\r\n\r\nD. The skeleton is composed of a sagittal ring and a basal tripod, without\r\nlatticed cephalis. This is the case in a few, but very important forms of\r\n#Stephoidea#: _Cortina_, _Stephanium_, _Cortiniscus_, _Stephaniscus_,\r\n_Podocoronis_, and some allied genera.\r\n\r\nE. The skeleton is composed of a sagittal ring and a latticed cephalis, but\r\nwithout basal tripod. This is the case in numerous #Cyrtellaria#, in the\r\nCircospyrida (or Zygospyrida apoda: _Dictyospyris_, _Circospyris_) and some\r\nother #Spyroidea#; and in a large number of #Botryodea# and Cyrtoidea\r\neradiata (a part of the Sethocyrtida, Theocyrtida, Lithocampida, and\r\nothers).\r\n\r\nF. The shell is composed of a basal tripod and a latticed cephalis, but\r\nwithout any trace of the sagittal ring. This is the case in numerous\r\nCyrtoidea triradiata and multiradiata, and perhaps in the majority of the\r\nfollowing families--Tripocalpida, Tripocyrtida, Podocyrtida, and\r\nPodocampida.\r\n\r\nG. The shell is composed of all three above-mentioned elements, of a\r\nsagittal ring, a basal tripod, and a latticed cephalis. This is the case in\r\nthe great majority of #Spyroidea# (with a few exceptions only), and perhaps\r\nalso in the majority of #Cyrtoidea#.\r\n\r\nThe survey of these seven groups, A to G, each of which is represented by\r\nnumerous living forms, shows clearly how difficult and complicated the\r\nmorphology and phylogeny of the numerous NASSELLARIA must be. For all\r\npossible combinations of the three original structural elements are\r\nrealised abundantly, and in such complicated relations, and so intermingled\r\nin the different orders and families, that it seems nearly hopeless to\r\nanswer the question of their true origin. The identity in the structure of\r\nthe central capsule, however, in all these MONOPYLEA, makes it probable\r\nthat they have all arisen originally from the skeletonless Nassellida\r\n(_Cystidium_, _Nassella_), either in a monophyletic or in a polyphyletic\r\nway. In this respect the following phylogenetical hypotheses are possible.\r\n\r\n1. Monophyletic hypothesis, deriving all NASSELLARIA from a simple sagittal\r\nring (_Archicircus_, _Lithocircus_, &c., Pl. 81). The groups A, D, E, and G\r\nmay be derived easily from such a ring, but the groups B, C, and F only by\r\nmeans of the hypothesis that the original ring may be completely reduced\r\nand finally lost. This hypothesis was stated by me in the years 1877 to\r\n1879, when I had got the first general survey of the astonishing number of\r\nnew NASSELLARIA in the Challenger collection, and as I had found the\r\nsagittal ring in the majority of them. This, my former hypothesis, is\r\nmentioned by Richard Hertwig (1879, _loc. cit._, pp. 68, 126). It was\r\nafterwards supported with particular energy by O. Bütschli (1882, Zeitschr.\r\nfür wiss. Zool., Bd. XXXVI.).\r\n\r\n2. Monophyletic hypothesis, deriving all NASSELLARIA from a basal tripod\r\n(_Triplagia_, _Plagoniscus_, &c., Pl. 91). The groups B, D, F, and G, all\r\ntriradiate, may {894}be derived easily from such a tripod; but the groups\r\nA, C, and E only by means of the hypothesis that the original tripod may be\r\ncompletely reduced and finally lost. This hypothesis was employed in 1881\r\nin my Prodromus, since I had convinced myself that the \"triradial\r\nstructure\" is prevalent in the great majority of NASSELLARIA, and is\r\nperhaps more important than the sagittal ring.\r\n\r\n3. Monophyletic hypothesis, deriving all NASSELLARIA from a latticed\r\ncephalis, a simple ovate or subspherical fenestrated shell without ring and\r\ntripod (_Cyrtocalpis_, _Archicapsa_, &_c._). The groups C, E, F, and G may\r\nbe derived easily from such a cephalis, but the groups A, B, and D only by\r\nmeans of the hypothesis that the sagittal ring as well as the basal tripod\r\nmay remain as the last remnants of a reduced cephalis. This hypothesis was\r\ngiven in 1862 in my Monograph, where I constructed the first pedigree of\r\nRadiolaria (p. 234). I there derived all the Cyrtida from the #Sphæroidea#\r\n(_Cyrtidosphæra_), supposing that _Cyrtocalpis_ and some other Monocyrtida\r\nmay form a direct phylogenetical passage from the #Sphæroidea# to the\r\n#Cyrtoidea#.\r\n\r\n4. Polyphyletic hypothesis, deriving the different groups of NASSELLARIA\r\nfrom different skeletonless Nassellida, by development of simple siliceous\r\nskeletons in different ways. Among the numerous polyphyletic hypotheses\r\nwhich are possible, one of the simplest would be the supposition that three\r\ndifferent fundamental forms of skeleton may have arisen independently one\r\nfrom another: (1) a simple sagittal ring as original form of the\r\n#Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea# (A); (2) a simple basal tripod as original\r\nform of the #Plectoidea# (B); (3) a simple latticed cephalis as original\r\nform of the #Botryodea# and #Cyrtoidea# (C). This triphyletic hypothesis is\r\nsupported by R. Hertwig (1879, _loc. cit._, p. 136); he assumes that the\r\noriginal skeletonless Nassellida (_Cystidium_) have produced three\r\ndifferent branches, his \"Acanthodesmida\" (= #Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea#)\r\nwith a primary ring, his \"Plagiacanthida\" (= #Plectoidea#) with a primary\r\ntripod, and his Cyrtida (= #Botryodea# and #Cyrtoidea#) with a primary\r\ncephalis. This hypothesis seems rather probable on the first view; but it\r\nmeets with the greatest difficulties in view of the fact that these three\r\noriginal elements of the skeleton are more or less evidently combined in\r\nthe great majority of NASSELLARIA. The greatest difficulty arises from the\r\nfact that often among very similar and closely allied forms the first\r\nexhibits all three elements (A, B, C) combined, whilst the second has a\r\ncombination of A and B, the third of B and C, the fourth of A and C; and\r\nthere are other forms, very similar to the former, in which one element\r\nonly is recognisable. Another difficulty arises from the fact that the\r\nintimate structure of the cephalis in the majority of #Cyrtellaria# is not\r\nperfectly known, and often exhibits structures which are difficult to\r\nexplain with regard to the three elements A, B, C. Under these\r\ncircumstances further researches on the numerous imperfectly known\r\nNASSELLARIA are required, and chiefly accurate observations on their more\r\nminute structure and on their important ontogeny.\r\n\r\n{895}We divide the immense legion of NASSELLARIA into two large orders, the\r\n#Plectellaria# without complete lattice-shell, and the #Cyrtellaria# with a\r\ncomplete lattice-shell or a \"cephalis,\" including the central capsule; the\r\nlatter, of course, have arisen from the former. The #Plectellaria# comprise\r\nthree different suborders, the #Nassoidea# (without skeleton), the\r\n#Plectoidea# (with a tripodal skeleton, without ring), and the #Stephoidea#\r\n(with a primary sagittal ring, with or without tripod). The #Cyrtellaria#\r\nagain also comprise three different suborders, the #Spyroidea# (with\r\nbilocular cephalis and a sagittal constriction), the #Botryodea# (with\r\nmultilocular and lobate cephalis, exhibiting two or more constrictions and\r\nthree or more lobes), and the #Cyrtoidea# (with simple, unilocular\r\ncephalis, without constriction).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Orders and Suborders of_ NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n  I.

Jena Ges. für Naturw., Februar 16.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--NASSELLARIA without skeleton. The soft body composed of a\r\nmonopylean central capsule (with porochora and podoconus) and of a\r\nsurrounding jelly-veil or calymma.\r\n\r\nThe family #Nassellida# comprises the simplest and most primitive forms of\r\nNASSELLARIA, the only group which is entirely without a skeleton. The\r\ncentral capsule is therefore perfectly free and naked, enveloped by the\r\ncalymma only, as in the #Colloidea# among the SPUMELLARIA, in the\r\nPhæodinida among the PHÆODARIA. Probably these naked and skeletonless\r\nMONOPYLEA must be regarded as surviving remnants of the common ancestral\r\ngroup of this legion; but the possibility is not excluded that the few\r\nobserved forms are either young NASSELLARIA which have not yet secreted a\r\nskeleton, or older NASSELLARIA which have lost their original skeleton.\r\n\r\nWe distinguish in this small family two genera only: _Cystidium_ with\r\nhyaline, not foamy calymma, without extracapsular alveoles, and _Nassella_,\r\nwith a very voluminous foamy calymma, including numerous large alveoles;\r\nthe former corresponds to _Actissa_ and the latter to _Thalassicolla_ among\r\nthe #Colloidea# or the skeletonless SPUMELLARIA. But in these two latter\r\ngenera, as in all PERIPYLEA, the central capsule is perforated everywhere\r\nby innumerable small pores; the two former genera, however, exhibit the\r\nsame characteristic podoconus in the central capsule, and the same\r\nporochora at its base, as all the other MONOPYLEA. The pseudopodia are\r\nprotruded from the central capsule through the porochora only.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ is in the two observed genera either ovate or nearly\r\nspherical, usually slightly tapering towards the basal mouth. Its\r\ntransverse section is constantly circular. The membrane of the capsule is\r\nusually rather thick and double-contoured, and bears on the truncate basal\r\npole a circular \"porochora\" or area porosa, through which the pseudopodia\r\nare protruded. The _porochora_ is either quite simple, circular, or in some\r\nspecies trilobed, with three equal circular lobes, each of which is\r\nsurrounded by a girdle of small granules. The _podoconus_, or\r\n\"pseudopodial-cone,\" arising vertically from the horizontal basal\r\nporochora, is half as long as the central capsule, or longer, simply\r\nconical and finely striped longitudinally. The _nucleus_ lies usually in\r\nthe uppermost part of the central capsule, above or behind the podoconus,\r\nand is either spherical or ovate, sometimes kidney-shaped. It includes one\r\nor more nucleoli.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Nassellida._\r\n\r\n  Calymma hyaline, without alveoles,             382. _Cystidium_.\r\n\r\n  Calymma foamy, with numerous large alveoles,   383. _Nassella_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{897}Genus 382. _Cystidium_,[1] R.

The central capsule is quite simple, ovate or nearly\r\nspherical, and included in a voluminous hyaline calymma, which contains no\r\nlarge alveoles. _Cystidium_ differs from _Actissa_, its probable ancestral\r\nform, in the possession of the \"podoconus\" and its basal \"porochora,\"\r\ncharacteristic of all NASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Cystidium princeps,_ n. sp.

Never a ring in the skeleton.\r\n\r\n{899}The suborder #Plectoidea#, hitherto known by few species only of\r\n\"Plagiacanthida,\" comprises a large number of interesting NASSELARIA, which\r\nbelong partly to the simplest and most primitive forms of this legion. It\r\nmay be divided into two different families, Plagonida and Plectanida. In\r\nthe first family, Plagonida, the monopylean central capsule is supported by\r\na simple or rudimentary skeleton, composed only of a variable number of\r\nradial spines united in a common centre. In the second family, Plectanida,\r\nthe branches of these radial spines become united and form a loose\r\nirregular framework with wide meshes, partly enclosing the central capsule,\r\nbut never a perfect lattice-shell.\r\n\r\nThe #Plectoidea# differ from the following suborder, the #Stephoidea#, in\r\nthe absence of the ring, characteristic of the latter. Some slight traces,\r\nhowever, indicate a near affinity between the ringless #Plectoidea# and the\r\nring-bearing #Stephoidea#. Both these suborders of #Plectellaria# differ\r\nfrom the closely allied #Cyrtellaria# (#Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and\r\n#Cyrtoidea#) in the absence of a complete lattice-shell. The morphological\r\nrelation and phylogenetic affinity between the former and the latter have\r\nalready been discussed in the preceding description of the legion\r\nNASSELLARIA (compare pp. 891-894).\r\n\r\nThe first known species of #Plectoidea# was observed in the North Atlantic\r\n(on the Norwegian shore) in 1855 by my late friend Edouard Claparède, and\r\ndescribed and figured in his Études, &c. (1858), under the name\r\n_Plagiacantha arachnoides_. He considered it as a new genus of\r\nAcanthometrina. Another species, from the Mediterranean, was described in\r\nthe same year by Johannes Müller as _Acanthodesmia dumetum_ (1858, _loc.\r\ncit._, Taf. i. fig. 3). A third species, also Mediterranean, was figured by\r\nme in 1865 under the name _Acanthodesmia polybrocha_. Finally, Richard\r\nHertwig, 1879, in his Organismus der Radiolarien, gave a very accurate\r\ndescription of another Mediterranean form, _Plagiacantha abietina_ (_loc.\r\ncit._, Taf. vii. fig. 6). He first recognised the true character of\r\nMONOPYLEA in their monaxonian central capsule, and observed at the same\r\ntime the first NASSELLARIUM without skeleton, called by him _Cyrtidium\r\ninerme_ (_loc. cit._, Taf. vii. fig. 1). To these four known species,\r\nrepresenting three different genera, the rich collection of the Challenger\r\nhas added so many new forms that we may distinguish here not less than\r\nseventeen genera and sixty-one species. In my Prodromus (1881, p. 423) I\r\narranged these in two subfamilies, the Plagonida and Plectanida,\r\nconstituting together the family Plectida (identical with the\r\n\"Plagiacanthida\" of Hertwig and Bütschli). But at present, regarding the\r\nimportant relations of these Plectida to the other NASSELLARIA, it seems\r\nmore convenient to give to them the rank of an independent suborder of\r\nRadiolaria, under the name #Plectoidea#.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar structure of the central capsule of the #Plectoidea#, first\r\nrecognised by Richard Hertwig, allows no doubt of their being true\r\nMONOPYLEA or NASSELLARIA; and also their siliceous, originally triradiate\r\nskeleton indicates the nearest affinity to {900}the other families of this\r\nlegion. But a very difficult and as yet unsolved problem is the important\r\nquestion, in what manner these different groups of NASSELARIA are\r\nphylogenetically connected. Either the #Plectoidea#--as the simplest of\r\nall--are the original common ancestral group of this whole legion (as I\r\nassumed in my Prodromus, 1881), or they are derived from the #Stephoidea#\r\n(by reduction of the sagittal ring), or they have originated independently\r\nfrom them (if we suppose a polyphyletic origin of the MONOPYLEA. Compare\r\nabove, p. 893, &c.). In any case the typical \"triradial structure\" of the\r\n#Plectoidea#, prevalent also in the other groups of this legion, is a very\r\nimportant and interesting fact.\r\n\r\nThe triradial skeleton of the #Plectoidea# exhibits in the two families of\r\nPlagonida and Plectanida a complete homology of development, so that each\r\ngenus of the latter may be derived from a corresponding genus of the\r\nformer, simply arisen by concrescence or union of the branches of the\r\nradial spines. Therefore the only difference between the two closely allied\r\nfamilies is, that the branches of the radial spines in the Plagonida remain\r\nfree, whilst in the Plectanida they produce a loose framework or wickerwork\r\nby union of their meeting ends. We express this complete homology in the\r\nnomenclature of the #Plectoidea#, in each genus of Plagonida retaining the\r\nsyllable \"Plag-\"; in each genus of Plectanida, correspondingly, the\r\nsyllable \"Plect-.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of radial spines composing the skeleton is originally three, and\r\nin all not triradial genera is probably derived from three. For better\r\nsurvey we may divide each family, according to the different number of\r\nrays, into four different subfamilies: A, with three radial spines\r\n(Triplagida and Triplectida); B, with four radial spines (Tetraplagida and\r\nTetraplectida); C, with six radial spines (Hexaplagida and Hexaplectida);\r\nand D, with numerous (seven to nine or more) radial spines (Polyplagida and\r\nPolyplectida). The last three subfamilies have arisen probably from the\r\nfirst triradial subfamily, by a secondary increase in the number of rays.\r\n\r\nThe important signification of the triradial structure, recurring in the\r\nmost different groups of NASSELLARIA, has been already pointed out\r\nsufficiently by myself and by R. Hertwig. But the triradial #Plectoidea#\r\noffer also another interesting relation of this characteristic structure,\r\nsome simple forms of this order appearing nearly identical with the\r\nisolated triradial spicula of certain #Beloidea# (Thalassosphærida and\r\nSphærozoida). Even some more complex quadriradial and sexradial forms of\r\nthe latter reappear in exactly the same shape also in the former. This\r\nidentity may be perhaps an important indication of true affinity (compare\r\nbelow).\r\n\r\nThe simplest and probably the most original kind of triradial structure is\r\nexhibited by the genera _Triplagia_ and _Triplecta_ (Pl. 91, figs. 2, 7).\r\nHere three equal radial spines lie in one horizontal plane and are united\r\nin a common central point at equal angles, so that three lines connecting\r\ntheir distal ends form a regular equilateral triangle. Simple triradial\r\nspicula of the same regular form are also found in many {901}#Beloidea#\r\n(_Lampoxanthium_, _Sphærozoum_, &c., Pls. 2 and 4).  The central capsule of\r\nthese simplest #Plectoidea# (with vertical main axis) rests perpendicularly\r\non the horizontal triangle, formed by the triradial skeleton; the porochora\r\nof the former (or the \"area porosa\") rests upon the central point of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of triradial structure characterises the genera _Plagiacantha_\r\nand _Plectophora_.  The three radial spines united in the central point lie\r\nhere not in one plane, but diverge in different planes, so that they\r\ncorrespond to the three lateral edges of a three-sided pyramid.  Commonly\r\nthe three spines are of equal size, and also the angles between them equal,\r\nso that the pyramid is regular, sometimes very flat, at other times more\r\nelevated.  Spicula of exactly the same form are also found in some\r\n#Beloidea#.  Probably the three divergent spines are homologous to the\r\nthree basal feet of numerous #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#.  The central\r\ncapsule, according to Hertwig, is placed in the apical part of the pyramid,\r\nthe axes of both being identical, and the porochora resting in the apex\r\nitself. This fact seems to contradict the above-mentioned affinity; but\r\nsince in _Triplecta_ and _Triplagia_ the three spines lie horizontally,\r\nthey may have changed this original position in different direction, in\r\n_Plagiacantha_ and _Plectophora_ becoming divergent upwards, whereas in\r\n_Plagoniscus_ and _Plectaniscus_ (as in the #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#)\r\ndirected downwards.\r\n\r\nThe triradial structure, common to the Triplagida and Triplectida, is\r\nreplaced by the quadriradial structure in the Tetraplagida and\r\nTetraplectida. Probably the latter have been derived from the former by\r\ndevelopment of a fourth spine, and then this latter would correspond to the\r\n\"apical horn\" of the other NASSELLARIA. But possibly also both structures\r\nhave originated independently from one another. We may distinguish not less\r\nthan four different kinds of the quadriradial structure. In the first case\r\nall four spines are equal, and diverge from a common central point at equal\r\nangles in different directions, corresponding to the four axes of a regular\r\ntetrahedron (_Tetraplagia_ and _Tetraplecta_, Pl. 91, figs. 3, 8).\r\n\r\nIn the second case all four spines are also equal, but they are not united\r\nin a common central point, but opposite in pairs on the two poles of a\r\ncommon central rod (_Plagonidium_). Therefore the skeleton possesses here\r\nthe same form as in the \"geminate-biradiate\" spicula of many #Beloidea#\r\n(_e.g._, _Thalassoxanthium bifurcum_ and _Sphærozoum furcatum_). The\r\ndevelopment of the short horizontal middle rod, connecting the two\r\ndivergent pairs of spines, is here probably effected by the porochora of\r\nthe central capsule resting upon it.\r\n\r\nWhilst in these two cases of quadriradial structure all four spines are\r\nequal, in two other cases they become differentiated in a very remarkable\r\nmanner. One spine is vertically directed upwards, in shape and size\r\ndifferent from the three others, which are directed downwards; the former\r\ncorresponding probably to the \"apical horn,\" the latter to the three \"basal\r\nfeet,\" which are found in the great majority of the #Spyroidea# {902}and\r\n#Cyrtoidea#. Therefore we encounter here for the first time that\r\ncharacteristic \"cortinar structure\" which is complete in _Cortina_ and\r\n_Cortiniscus_ (Pl. 92, figs. 11-13, 21), and which may be regarded as the\r\nstrongest argument for a close relationship, or even for a common\r\nmonophyletic origin of all NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\nThe four spines, which we regard therefore as \"cortinar spines,\" exhibit a\r\ntwofold kind of central junction. In the simpler case they are united in a\r\ncommon central point, on which rests the porochora of the central capsule\r\n(_Plagoniscus_ and _Plectaniscus_, Pl. 91, figs. 4, 9). These forms are\r\nnearer to _Cortina_, and may be derived immediately from _Tetraplagia_ and\r\n_Tetraplecta_ by differentiation of the four equal spines. In the other\r\ncase the four cortinar spines are separated in pairs, diverging from the\r\ntwo poles of a short horizontal common \"central rod\" (_Plagiocarpa_ and\r\n_Periplecta_, Pl. 91, figs. 5, 10). These forms may be compared with the\r\nspicula of some #Beloidea# and derived from _Plagonidium_; but their basal\r\ncentral rod may be compared again with the basal part of the sagittal ring\r\nof _Cortina_, and this comparison becomes very important in those forms\r\nlike _Plagiocarpa procortina_ (Pl. 91, fig. 5). Here the four spines\r\napproach very nearly to those of _Cortina_; the two ventral spines (or\r\npectoral feet) on the anterior pole of of the middle rod are equal, but\r\nvery different from the two dorsal spines, arising from the posterior pole;\r\nthe lower odd spine of the latter corresponds to the \"caudal foot,\" the\r\nupper spine to the \"apical horn\" of _Cortina_ and of the #Cyrtellaria#. The\r\nvertical plane, determined by these two dorsal spines, is the sagittal\r\nplane, and two opposite curved branches which lie in this plane (an upper\r\narising from the basal part of the apical spine and a lower arising from\r\nthe anterior pole of the middle rod) may be regarded as ventral parts of an\r\nincomplete sagittal ring. This interesting form and some other similar\r\nTetraplagida may be regarded either as beginning #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_,\r\nwith incomplete sagittal ring) or as retrograde #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_,\r\nwith partly reduced sagittal ring). In every case they seem to indicate the\r\nnear relationship between the #Stephoidea# and #Plectoidea#.\r\n\r\nAnother argument for this close relationship may be found in the position\r\nof the central capsule in the interesting genus _Plagiocarpa_ (Pl. 91, fig.\r\n5). Its basal part (with the porochora) rests upon the common central rod,\r\nits ventral face upon the ventral prolongation of the latter, its dorsal\r\nface upon the apical horn; its axis lies in the sagittal plane. The three\r\nbasal spines (the odd caudal and the paired pectoral feet) diverge from its\r\nbasal pole downwards in the same manner as in the Cortina, the Zygospyrida\r\nand the Monocyrtida.\r\n\r\nLess important than those quadriradial Tetraplagida and Tetraplectida, are\r\nthe sexradial #Plectoidea#, the Hexaplagida and Hexaplectida. These may be\r\nderived immediately from the triradial #Plectoidea# by prolongation of the\r\nthree primary original spines (of _Plagiacantha_) over the common central\r\npoint. Here also two {903}different kinds of central junction are found. In\r\nthe simpler case all six radial spines arise from a common central point\r\n(_Hexaplagia_ and _Hexaplecta_). In the other case the six radial spines\r\narise from the two poles of a short horizontal common central rod, opposed\r\nin two groups, each of three spines (_Plagonium_ and _Plectanium_, Pl. 91,\r\nfigs. 6, 11).  In this latter case the single corresponding spines of the\r\ntwo opposite groups are usually parallel, and exhibit therefore exactly the\r\nsame characteristic \"germinate-triradiate\" form which is found in many\r\n#Beloidea# (_e.g._, in the common _Sphærozoum punctatum_ and the similar\r\n_Lampoxanthium punctatum_).\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last group of this suborder contains the multiradiate\r\n#Plectoidea#, the Polyplagida and Polyplectida. Here the number of radial\r\nspines, diverging from the common centre, exceeds six, and is commonly\r\nseven to nine, at other times ten to twelve or more (_Polyplagia_ and\r\n_Polyplecta_, Pl. 91, fig. 12). When these two genera are better known from\r\nfurther accurate observations, they may probably be divided into several\r\ndifferent genera (as already proposed in my Prodromus, 1881), since not\r\nonly the number, but also the central junction and the arrangement of the\r\nnumerous radial spines in the few observed species seems to be very\r\ndifferent. In some seven-radiate species (_e.g._, _Polyplecta heptacantha_)\r\nfour larger spines seem to be true \"cortinar spines,\" the three smaller\r\nsecondary productions of the former. In the nine-radiate species the nine\r\nspines seem to be sometimes basal branches of three primary spines, at\r\nother times six secondary intercalated between the three primary (like\r\n_Enneaphormis_, Pl. 57, fig. 9). In those multiradial #Plectoidea#, in\r\nwhich the number of spines amounts to ten or twelve or more, the laws of\r\ndisposition are not yet recognised.\r\n\r\nComparing these different productions of the skeleton in the numerous\r\n#Plectoidea#, we find expressed two remarkable and very different\r\naffinities. On the one hand many #Plectoidea# exhibit exactly the same\r\npeculiar forms, which are only found besides in the #Beloidea# (as many\r\nspecies of _Triplagia_, _Plagiacantha_, _Tetraplagia_, _Plagonidium_,\r\n_Hexaplagia_, and _Plagonium_). On the other hand many #Plectoidea# bear\r\nthe same characteristic composition of the skeleton (or the \"cortinar\r\nstructure\") which is found in the Cortinida among the #Stephoidea#, and in\r\nnumerous #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#, which all agree in the possession of\r\nthree divergent basal feet and a vertical apical horn. A most important\r\nargument for the close affinity of all these \"cortinar NASSELLARIA\" seems\r\nto be given by the fact that the sagittal ring, which in _Cortina_ is\r\ncombined with the quadriradial structure, exhibits in the #Cyrtellaria# the\r\nmost different stages of development; in one group it is complete, in the\r\nsecond incomplete, and in the third it has completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe form of the radial spines composing the skeleton is usually three-sided\r\nprismatic, gradually tapering from the thicker central base towards the\r\ndistal apex; sometimes they are slender pyramidal. More rarely the spines\r\nare cylindrical or slender conical. In the majority of species the spines\r\nare straight, in the minority more or {904}less curved. In very few species\r\nonly are they quite simple, without branches. They are nearly always more\r\nor less branched, in many larger species very richly ramified. The modes of\r\nramification are rather variable. In the majority of #Plectoidea# the\r\nspines are rather regularly verticillate, bearing an increasing number of\r\nverticils, each of which is composed of three divergent branches. These\r\narise from the three edges of the spine, and all the branches of one edge\r\nare usually parallel, either perpendicular to the spine, or directed at an\r\nacute angle towards its apex. When the verticils are numerous (five to ten\r\nor more), their size commonly tapers gradually towards the apex. Pinnate\r\nspines occur more rarely than verticillate ones; in this case the two\r\npaired lateral edges only of the prismatic spine bear opposite or alternate\r\nbranches, whilst the odd middle edge bears no ramules. In some species the\r\nspines are singly or doubly forked. In many species (mainly those with\r\ncylindrical spines) the ramification of the spines is more or less\r\nirregular.\r\n\r\nWhilst in all Plagonida the branches of the spine remain perfectly free, in\r\nall Plectanida, again, the meeting ends of the branches become united and\r\ngrow together, and by this concrescence a loose network arises, like\r\nwickerwork, which partly encloses the central capsule and the central parts\r\nof the spines, on which it rests. The meshes of this loose wickerwork are\r\nlarge, either quite irregular, of very different size and form, or more or\r\nless regular, with a certain form and arrangement of the meshes, effected\r\nby the peculiar kind of ramification. Commonly the siliceous threads of the\r\narachnoidal wickerwork are very thin, often extremely delicate,\r\nrepresenting \"pseudopodia metamorphosed into silex.\" Sometimes the\r\nwickerwork is spongy. Its surface is constantly rough and bristly, with\r\nfree ends of the spine-branches, never covered with a regular\r\nlattice-plate, as in the #Cyrtellaria# (#Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and\r\n#Cyrtoidea#).\r\n\r\nThe entire form of the central wickerwork is in the minority of Plectanida\r\nquite irregular and indefinite; in the majority, however, a certain more or\r\nless regular entire form is recognisable, effected by a certain, more or\r\nless regular origin and mode of the connection of the meeting branches. So\r\nin some species of _Triplecta_ (Pl. 91, fig. 7) the network represents a\r\ntriangular plate, of _Plectophora_ and _Plectaniscus_ a three-sided\r\npyramid, of _Tetraplecta_ (Pl. 91, fig. 3) a tetrahedron, and in many other\r\nspecies a polyhedron of more or less regular form. Some species of\r\nPlectanida become very similar to certain species of #Stephoidea#,\r\n#Spyroidea#, and #Cyrtoidea#; so _Plectaniscus_ and _Periplecta_ approach\r\nto _Cortina_ and _Cortiniscus_, _Pteroscenium_ and _Clathrocorys_, &c.\r\n(compare Pls. 92, 93, 53, 64, &c.). They may represent a true phylogenetic\r\nconnection between both groups. But in these cases also the distinction is\r\ndetermined by the fact that the true #Plectoidea# never possess a complete\r\nsagittal ring (like the #Stephoidea#) nor a regular lattice-shell (like the\r\n#Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and #Cyrtoidea#).\r\n\r\n{905}_The Central Capsule_ of the #Plectoidea# constantly exhibits the\r\npeculiar characters of the MONOPYLEA or NASSELLARIA. It is commonly ovate,\r\nmore rarely ellipsoidal or even spherical, sometimes conical or\r\nlentelliptical. The lower or basal pole of its vertical main axis\r\nconstantly exhibits the characteristic \"porochora\" (or the area porosa) of\r\nthe MONOPYLEA, and upon this rests the peculiar \"podoconus\" (or the\r\npseudopodial-cone) of this legion. On this porochora the central capsule is\r\nin immediate connection with the central point of the skeleton, or the\r\nhorizontal common central rod, from which the radial spines arise. The\r\nendoplasm, or the protoplasm of the central capsule (besides the\r\npodoconus), contains commonly one large alveole or several small vacuoles,\r\nand often pigment-granules. The nucleus is large, spherical or ovate, and\r\nexhibits the same character as in all the other MONOPYLEA; it encloses\r\nusually a single nucleolus.\r\n\r\nThe position of the central capsule and its topographical relation to the\r\nskeleton offers in the different #Plectoidea# some important and as yet\r\nunsolved problems, which can be answered only by fresh and accurate\r\nobservations on living specimens. In _Triplagia_ and _Triplecta_, where the\r\ntriangular skeleton lies in a horizontal plane, the vertical main axis of\r\nthe central capsule is perpendicular to the central point of that\r\nsupporting triangle. In _Plagiacantha_ and _Plectophora_, where the three\r\nradial spines correspond to the edges of a flat pyramid, the capsule is\r\nenclosed in the pyramidal space of the latter, its basal pole touching the\r\napex; therefore in the normal position of the body the three divergent rays\r\nare directed upwards. In _Tetraplagia_ and _Tetraplecta_ probably the same\r\nposition is retained, and therefore the fourth free spine, here developed,\r\nis probably directed vertically downwards. In _Plagoniscus_ and\r\n_Plectaniscus_, however, and moreover, in the closely allied _Plagiocarpa_\r\nand the corresponding _Periplecta_ (Pl. 91, figs. 5, 10) the position of\r\nthe central capsule, relative to the skeleton, seems to be inverse, and to\r\nagree with that of the #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, &c.) and the\r\n#Cyrtoidea# (_Pteroscenium_, _Clathrocorys_, &c.); the three divergent\r\nspines are here directed downwards (as basal feet), whilst the opposite\r\nfourth spine is vertically directed upwards (as an apical horn); the\r\ncapsule rests here upon the tripod, which lies below it, and is inclined\r\nwith its dorsal face to the apical spine. In the majority of the other\r\n#Plectoidea# the position of the central capsule and its relation to the\r\nskeleton are not yet sufficiently observed, and require further accurate\r\nresearches. Its position seems to be very different in the several genera.\r\nThe capsule is never perforated by parts of the skeleton; this latter is\r\nconstantly extra-capsular.\r\n\r\nThe physiological value of the skeleton, with regard to the central\r\ncapsule, is different in the Plagonida and Plectanida; in the former it\r\nsupports, in the latter it encloses the capsule like a shell. In the\r\nNassellida, where no skeleton is developed, the central capsule is quite\r\nfree and naked, enveloped only by the calymma.\r\n\r\n{906}The calymma or the extracapsular jelly-veil in all #Plectoidea# is\r\nvoluminous, and encloses not only the central capsule completely, but also\r\nthe skeleton wholly or partially. Its form is of the greatest value for the\r\ndevelopment and configuration of the skeleton. Sometimes the calymma is\r\nalveolate and foamy, as in _Nassella_ and the common _Thalassicolla_. In\r\nseveral other #Plectoidea# the calymma seems to include numerous small\r\nvacuoles, sometimes also pigment-granules. Xanthellæ are commonly scattered\r\nin it in great numbers. The pseudopodia, arising in a large bunch from the\r\nporochora of the capsule, and running along the branches of the radial\r\nspines, seem to be always numerous, richly branched, and with a strong\r\ntendency to form anastomoses. The peculiar form of their network is often\r\nexactly preserved in the conformation of the skeleton, produced by them.\r\nThe peculiarities of this network require further accurate observations, as\r\ndoes the whole organisation of the #Plectoidea#.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Families of_ #Plectoidea#.\r\n\r\n   I.

PLECTANIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily XLVI. #PLAGONIDA#, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Plagonida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 423.\r\n  _Plagiacanthida_ (_sensu strictiori_), Richard Hertwig, 1879, Organismus\r\n      d. Radiol., p. 72.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Plectoidea# with a spiny skeleton, composed of radial\r\nspines, which arise from a common central point or central rod, and support\r\nthe free central capsule.\r\n\r\nThe family #Plagonida# comprises those NASSELLARIA in which the skeleton is\r\nonly composed of united radial spines, arising from a common centre,\r\nwithout any connection of meeting branches of the spines; the rudimentary\r\nskeleton exhibits therefore neither a loose wickerwork (as in the closely\r\nallied Plectanida), nor a ring (as in the #Stephoidea#), nor a complete\r\nlattice-shell (as in the #Cyrtellaria#, the #Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and\r\n#Cyrtoidea#). The central capsule, which possesses all the characters of\r\nthe MONOPYLEA, is therefore free, not enclosed, and only on one side\r\nsupported or partly protected by the radial spines or their branches.\r\n\r\nTwo species only of Plagonida have been hitherto known. The first form\r\ndescribed is the _Plagiacantha arachnoides_, discovered thirty years ago\r\n(1855) by Claparède on the western shore of Norway. Another species of the\r\nsame genus, from the Mediterranean, was very accurately described by\r\nRichard Hertwig in 1879 in his Organismus der {907}Radiolarien\r\n(_Plagiacantha abietina_). Upon these two species the latter founded his\r\nfamily Plagiacanthida, a term which was afterwards employed by Bütschli and\r\nothers, for the whole group of #Plectoidea#. Many new forms are contained\r\nin the collection of the Challenger, so that we may describe here nine\r\ngenera and thirty-four species.\r\n\r\nThe family Plagonida may be divided into four different subfamilies,\r\naccording to the numbers of the radial spines which compose the skeleton:\r\nTriplagida with three, Tetraplagida with four, Hexaplagida with six, and\r\nPolyplagida with numerous (seven to nine or more) radial spines. These are\r\nunited commonly in one common central point, upon which rests the basal\r\npole of the central capsule, with the porochora. More rarely (in the genera\r\n_Plagonidium_, _Plagiocarpa_, and _Plagonium_) the spines arise in two\r\nopposite groups (each with two or three spines) from the two poles of a\r\ncommon central rod; in this case the basal pole of the central capsule with\r\nthe porochora rests upon the horizontal common rod, which corresponds\r\nprobably to the basal part of the sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea# and\r\n#Cyrtellaria#.\r\n\r\nThe different forms which the skeleton of the Plagonida assumes in the\r\ndifferent genera of this family, and the important relations which these\r\nexhibit on the one hand to the spicula of the #Beloidea#, and on the other\r\nhand to the shell of some #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, &c.) and\r\n#Cyrtoidea# (_Pteroscenium_, _Clathrocorys_, &c.), have been already\r\npointed out in the preceding description of the suborder #Plectoidea#.\r\nThere it is also demonstrated, that all these different forms may be\r\nderived from the simplest triradial forms, _Triplagia_ and _Plagiacantha_\r\n(compare above, pp. 900-904).\r\n\r\nWhilst the genera of the Plagonida are characterised by the number of the\r\nradial spines and the peculiar mode of junction in a common central point\r\nor at the two poles of a common central rod, the different species of this\r\nfamily may be defined by the peculiar form of the spines and their\r\nbranches. These morphological characters have also been already described\r\nabove. We repeat here only that the radial spines in the majority of\r\nspecies are three-sided prismatic and verticillate, each verticil commonly\r\nwith three branches. The distal ends of these branches remain constantly\r\nfree, and are never united, as is always the case in the following family.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Plagonida exhibits the general characters of\r\nall MONOPYLEA (compare above, p. 890). It is commonly ovate or ellipsoidal,\r\nwith vertical main axis; on the lower pole of the latter is the porochora\r\n(or the \"area porosa,\" from which all pseudopodia radiate). This is in\r\nimmediate connection with the central point or central rod of the skeleton,\r\nin which its radial spines are united. The topographical relation of the\r\nsupporting skeleton to the central capsule seems to exhibit in the\r\ndifferent genera of the Plagonida remarkable differences, as already\r\ndemonstrated above (p. 905).\r\n\r\n{908}_Synopsis of the Genera of Plagonida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

This rudimentary wattled skeleton is either quite irregular or only\r\nslightly regular, but it never assumes the form of a complete\r\nlattice-shell, as in the #Cyrtellaria# (the #Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and\r\n#Cyrtoidea#), nor does it exhibit a ring (as in the #Stephoidea#). The\r\ncentral capsule is partly or wholly protected, and often entirely enclosed\r\nby the wattled skeleton.\r\n\r\nThree species only of Plectanida have been hitherto known. The first\r\ndescribed form is _Plectophora arachnoides_, which its discoverer Claparède\r\nobserved in a living state in 1855 on the western coast of Norway, and\r\nconsidered as a mere variety of his _Plagiacantha arachnoides_. Two other\r\nspecies were afterwards observed in the Mediterranean, _Polyplecta\r\ndumetum_, 1856, by Johannes Müller (united by him with _Acanthodesmia_) and\r\n_Polyplecta polybrocha_ by myself in 1864. Many new forms are found in the\r\n{920}collection of the Challenger, so that we may here distinguish eight\r\ngenera and twenty-seven species.\r\n\r\nThe family Plectanida may be divided into four different subfamilies,\r\naccording to the number of the radial spines which compose the skeleton.\r\nThose four subfamilies, as also the genera contained in them, correspond\r\nexactly to the four subfamilies of Plagonida, from which they have\r\noriginated: Triplectida with three, Tetraplectida with four, Hexaplectida\r\nwith six, and Polyplectida with numerous (seven to nine or more) radial\r\nspines. These spines are usually united (as in the corresponding ancestral\r\nPlagonida) in one common central point, upon which rests the basal pole of\r\nthe central capsule, with the porochora. More rarely (in the genera\r\n_Periplecta_ and _Plectanium_) the spines arise in two opposite groups\r\n(each of two or three spines) from the two poles of a common horizontal\r\ncentral rod, which supports the overlying porochora of the central capsule.\r\n\r\nThe different genera of Plectanida, which are enumerated in the following\r\nsynopsis, correspond so exactly to the different genera of Plagonida\r\ndescribed above, that probably each of the former has arisen from a\r\ncorresponding genus of the latter. The only difference between the two is,\r\nthat in all Plagonida the branches and ramules of the radial spines end\r\nfreely, without growing together, whilst in all Plectanida the meeting ends\r\nof the neighbouring spines grow together and so produce a loose and\r\nirregular wickerwork. Therefore the latter constantly possess meshes, which\r\nare missing in the former. As soon as any form of Plagonida begins to\r\nproduce meshes by concrescence of meeting branches of the spines, it passes\r\nover into a corresponding form of Plectanida. The loose wickerwork or\r\nwattlework so produced is sometimes very irregular, at other times more or\r\nless regular; but it never assumes the regular form of a complete\r\nlattice-shell, as in the #Cyrtellaria# (#Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and\r\n#Cyrtoidea#). The general differences which this wickerwork exhibits in the\r\ndifferent genera of Plectanida have been already described above (compare\r\npp. 900-904).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Plectanida agrees perfectly with that of the\r\nancestral Plagonida, as well in general form and structure as in the\r\npeculiar topographical relation to the radial spines (compare above, p.\r\n905). A slight difference between the two families is effected by the\r\nhigher development of the skeleton in the Plectanida. Since the branches of\r\nthe radial spines in this family become united and form a loose wickerwork,\r\nthe central capsule becomes more or less enclosed by the latter, and more\r\nperfectly protected, than in the Plagonida, where the branches remain free.\r\nIn this respect the Plectanida approach more nearly to the #Cyrtoidea# with\r\nwhich they are connected by such transitional forms as _Plectaniscus_ and\r\n_Periplecta_ on the one hand, _Cladoscenium_ and _Pteroscenium_ on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n{921}_Synopsis of the Genera of Plectanida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The skeleton\r\nrepresents a triangular lattice-plate with three radial beams. On the\r\ncentral union of the latter rests the oral pole of the central capsule.\r\nSince the axis of the latter is vertical, the lattice-plate must be\r\nhorizontal, serving for the expansion of the pseudopodia. _Triplecta_ has\r\narisen from _Triplagia_ by union of the branches of its three radial\r\nspines. In the simplest case only three large meshes are formed,\r\ncorresponding probably to the three cortinar meshes in the collar septum of\r\nmany #Cyrtellaria#.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Triplecta triangulum_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines straight, equal, smooth, cylindrical, each in the basal half with\r\none pair of divergent straight lateral branches. The opposed branches of\r\nevery two neighbouring spines are united by a {922}thin convex bow. In this\r\nway arises a very simple, equilateral triangular skeleton, with three equal\r\nlarge meshes.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.14, sides of the triangle 0.16.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, Station 348, depth 2450 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Triplecta triactis_, n. sp. (Pl. 91, fig. 7).\r\n\r\nSpines straight, equal, three-sided prismatic, pinnate, each with three to\r\nfour pairs of opposite slender pinnulæ or lateral branches; the pinnulæ of\r\neach spine are correspondingly parallel to the main rods of the other two\r\nspines. All pinnulæ branched and connected by a few slender bows, marking\r\nthe sides of a regular triangle.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions_.--Length of the spines 0.15, sides of the triangle 0.17.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, depth 2600 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 394. _Plectophora_,[13] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 424.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Plectanida# with three radial spines, arising from one\r\ncommon central point and corresponding to the edges of a three-sided\r\npyramid.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Plectophora_ has been derived from _Plagiacantha_ by union of\r\nthe meeting neighbouring branches of the three radial spines, and exhibits\r\ntherefore to it the same relation that _Triplecta_ bears to _Triplagia_.\r\nThe loose framework so produced corresponds to the three sides of a flat\r\npyramid and supports the central capsule.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Plectophora triomma_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines equal, straight, three-sided prismatic, thorny, connected by three\r\nconvex bows, the meeting branches of lateral spines arising in one pair\r\nfrom the middle part of each spine.

In some forms of this genus the four rods\r\nseem to correspond exactly to the four axes, which are directed from the\r\ncentre of a tetrahedron towards its four corners; whilst in other forms the\r\nfour rods and the angles between them are perhaps not perfectly equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Tetraplecta tetrahedra_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines straight, equal, three-sided prismatic, pinnate, each with three or\r\nfour pairs of opposite straight slender pinnulæ or lateral branches; the\r\npinnulæ of each side are correspondingly parallel. {924}All pinnulæ\r\nconnected by a few slender bridges, thus producing a delicate network with\r\nirregular rhomboidal meshes.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.15, of the basal branches 0.05.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, depth 2600 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Tetraplecta quadricornis_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines in the basal half straight, in the distal half slightly curved and\r\nirregularly branched, with two to three pairs of unequal alternate lateral\r\nbranches, the distal ends of which are connected by a few slender bows,\r\nmarking the six edges of an irregular tetrahedron.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.22, of the basal branches 0.14.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Tetraplecta pinigera_, n. sp. (Pl. 91, fig. 8).\r\n\r\nSpines three-sided prismatic, straight, or in the basal half slightly\r\ncurved, verticillate; each spine with six to eight three-branched regular\r\nverticils, tapering gradually towards the distal end. All branches of each\r\nspine lie parallel in three equidistant meridian planes, and are connected\r\nby delicate parallel threads, perpendicular to the branches. Therefore the\r\nskeleton consists of four pine-shaped trees and twelve delicate triangular\r\nwings with rectangular meshes.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.25 to 0.3, of the basal branches 0.1\r\nto 0.15.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 396. _Plectaniscus_,[15] nov. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Plectanida# with four unequal radial spines, arising from\r\none common central point; one vertical or apical spine opposed to three\r\ndivergent or basal spines.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Plectaniscus_ has probably been derived from _Plagoniscus_ by\r\nreticular union of the neighbouring branches of the four radial spines, and\r\nexhibits therefore to it the same relation that _Tetraplecta_ bears to\r\n_Tetraplagia_. Whilst in these two latter genera the four spines are equal,\r\nin the two former genera there is an important difference between a\r\nvertical spine (or apical horn) and three divergent (commonly larger)\r\nspines, corresponding to the three basal feet of the triradiate\r\nNASSELLARIA. Perhaps, therefore, _Plectaniscus_ is one of the remotest\r\nancestors of the latter; but differs in the absence of a complete\r\nlattice-shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n{925}1. _Plectaniscus cortiniscus_, n. sp. (Pl. 91, fig. 9).\r\n\r\nSpines straight, three-sided prismatic, with three to four verticils of\r\nshort perpendicular branches; the branches of the distal verticils are\r\nsimple and free, those of the proximal verticils again ramified and\r\nconnected by an arachnoidal network of delicate threads. The vertical\r\napical spine (or horn) is scarcely one-third or half as long as the three\r\ndivergent basal spines (or feet), and the angle between it and the latter\r\nis smaller.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the apical spine 0.05 to 0.1, of the three basal\r\nspines 0.18 to 0.2.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Plectaniscus tripodiscus_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines curved, cylindrical, with a variable number of irregular branches,\r\nwhich in the distal half of the spines are free, in the basal half again\r\nramified and connected by a loose spongy framework. The apical spine is\r\nshorter and simpler, nearly straight, less ramified.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the apical spine 0.1, of the three basal spines\r\n0.15 to 0.18.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 238, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Plectaniscus archiscenium_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines slightly curved, three-sided prismatic, with two to three verticils\r\nof short curved branches. The vertical apical spine is about twice as long\r\nas the three basal spines, and connected with them by an irregular loose\r\nframework. The three basal spines are connected together only by a simple\r\nring, so that between them remain three large collar holes, like those of\r\nthe similar and closely allied _Archiscenium quadrispinum_ (Pl. 53, fig.\r\n11).\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the apical spine 0.32, of the three basal spines\r\n0.18.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 295, depth 1500 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Plectaniscus cladoscenium_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines curved, three-sided prismatic. The three basal spines pinnate, with\r\nfour to five pairs of opposite curved pinnulæ; the distal pairs are simple\r\nand free, the basal pairs branched and connected by an irregular delicate\r\nframework, which together with the apical spine forms a spongy cap-shaped\r\nshell, similar to _Cladoscenium_. Apical spine about half as long, simple.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions_.--Length of the apical spine 0.1, of the three basal spines\r\n0.18.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Plectaniscus clathrocorys_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines straight, three-sided prismatic, with seven or eight verticils of\r\nramified branches, which in the basal half are connected by an irregular\r\nloose framework. In the distal half each of the three divergent basal\r\nspines (or feet) is connected with the longer apical spine (or horn) by a\r\n{926}fenestrated triangular lattice wing. Therefore the skeleton becomes\r\nvery similar to _Clathrocorys_ (Pl. 64, figs. 8-10), but wants the regular\r\ncentral cephalis.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the apical spine 0.2, of the basal spines 0.14.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 397. _Periplecta_,[16] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 424.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Plectanida# with four unequal radial spines, arising in\r\npairs from the two poles of a common central rod; one ascending apical\r\nspine opposed to three descending basal spines.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Periplecta_ has probably been derived from _Plagiocarpa_ (by\r\nconcrescence of the meeting spine branches), and has the same important\r\nrelation to a part of the triradial #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, &c.) and\r\n#Cyrtoidea# (_Pteroscenium_, &c.). It differs from the latter only in the\r\nfact that the loose irregular framework connecting the bases of the four\r\ncortinar spines is not a regular lattice-shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Periplecta cortina_, n. sp. (Pl. 91, fig. 10).\r\n\r\nSpines of very different size and shape, three-sided prismatic. The apical\r\nspine (or horn) is larger, nearly straight, and bears a verticil of three\r\nlarge divergent branches, which are again ramified. The three basal spines\r\n(or feet) are curved, pinnate, each with three to five pairs of opposite\r\nsimple curved branches. A small common central rod separates the two united\r\npectoral feet from the two other spines (the caudal foot and the apical\r\nhorn). The three basal feet are connected by three convex bows composing a\r\nhorizontal collar ring, and since the central rod is prolonged between the\r\npectoral feet to the ring, a very remarkable collar septum is formed with\r\nfour cortinar meshes. Above this septum an irregular spongy shell,\r\nincluding the central capsule, is formed by a delicate framework,\r\ninterwoven between the apical horn and the three basal feet.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the apical spine 0.25 to 0.3, of the three basal\r\nspines 0.15 to 0.2.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Periplecta pteroscenium_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines of very different size and shape, three-sided prismatic,\r\nverticillate. The apical spine (or horn) with ten to twelve verticils, is\r\none and a half times as long as the three basal spines (or feet), which\r\nbear six to eight verticils only; each verticil with three branches which\r\nby communicating ramules form a loose irregular wickerwork. Similar to\r\n_Pteroscenium pinnatum_, Pl. 53, figs. 14-16, but without a regular\r\nlattice-shell. A short basal central rod separates two equal (pectoral)\r\nspines from two unequal spines, the larger of the latter is the apical, the\r\nshorter the caudal spine.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the apical spine 0.26, of the three basal spines\r\n0.17.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n{927}3. _Periplecta monocyrtis_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpines of nearly equal size and shape, cylindrical, irregularly branched.\r\nThe apical spine is straight, more branched and nearly twice as long as the\r\nthree basal spines. All four spines in the basal third connected by a loose\r\nspongy framework, approaching the form of some Monocyrtida.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the apical spine 0.24, of the basal spines 0.13.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubfamily 3.

STEPHOIDEA, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Stephoidea_ vel _Stephida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 444.\r\n  _Acanthodesmida_ (_sensu ampliori_), Bütschli, 1882, Zeitschr. f. wiss.\r\n      Zool., vol. xxxvi. p. 495.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--NASSELLARIA without complete lattice-shell, with a skeleton\r\ncomposed of one or more simple rings, which may be united by a loose\r\nframework and are separated by large openings or gates. One primary or\r\nsagittal ring, determining the sagittal or median plane of the bilateral\r\nbody, encloses the monaxonian central capsule.\r\n\r\nThe suborder #Stephoidea#, hitherto known by a few species only of\r\n\"Acanthodesmida,\" comprises a large number of interesting NASSELLARIA (now\r\nmore than two hundred species), which possess peculiar interest for the\r\nmorphology and phylogeny of this legion. The monaxonian central capsule of\r\nthe #Stephoidea# is surrounded either by one simple ring or by a complex\r\nsystem of several loosely connected rings; these may be united by a loose\r\nframework of connected branches, but never produce a complete\r\nlattice-shell, as is constantly the case in the #Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#,\r\nand #Cyrtoidea#. Therefore there remain between the parts of the connected\r\nrings a few large openings which we call \"gates,\" separating them from the\r\nnumerous small \"pores\" of the complete lattice-shells. In the most simple\r\ncase, if only one ring be formed, there is also present only one \"gate,\"\r\nthe aperture of this simple ring.\r\n\r\nThe first known species of #Stephoidea# were observed in the Mediterranean\r\nby Johannes Müller in 1856, and described and figured in his last treatise\r\n(1858) under the names _Lithocircus annularis_ (_loc. cit._, Taf. i. fig.\r\n1) and _Acanthodesmia vinculata_ (_loc. cit._, Taf. i. figs. 4-7). In the\r\nfollowing year I myself observed two other living species in the\r\nMediterranean, and described them in my Monograph (1862, pp. 268, 270) as\r\n_Zygostephanus mülleri_ (Taf. xii. fig. 2) and _Prismatium tripleurum_\r\n(Taf. iv. fig. 6). For these four longest known #Stephoidea# I founded the\r\nnew family of Acanthodesmida (_loc. cit._, p. 265), but united with them\r\ntwo other similar genera which I afterwards separated:--_Plagiacantha_\r\n(belonging to the #Plectoidea#) and _Dictyocha_ (belonging to the\r\nPHÆODARIA).\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1876, I received the rich material of the Challenger collection, I\r\nwas astonished to find in it an enormous number of new, similar, and partly\r\nvery interesting \"Acanthodesmida,\" which were afterwards arranged in my\r\nProdromus (1881, p. 444) in thirty-eight different genera and four\r\n\"subfamilies,\" all united in one single large family, \"Stephida or\r\nMonopylaria cricoidea.\" I retain here this natural group in the same sense,\r\nbut give to it the rank of a \"suborder,\" separating at the same time its\r\nfour subfamilies as substantial \"families.\" Since the names of the\r\n{932}latter, proposed in the Prodromus, were not quite suitable, I replace\r\nthem here by the following more convenient names:--\r\n\r\n  1. Family Stephanida (= Monostephida, 1881, p. 447). Skeleton entirely\r\n  formed by one simple ring (the primary vertical sagittal ring). The only\r\n  \"gate\" is the simple aperture of the ring.\r\n\r\n  2. Family Semantida (= Dyostephida, 1881, p. 446). Skeleton composed of\r\n  two rings, perpendicular to one another; the primary vertical sagittal\r\n  ring bears at the base a horizontal basal ring; between the two rings two\r\n  or more \"basal gates remain.\"\r\n\r\n  3. Family Coronida (= Triostephida, 1881, p. 445). Skeleton composed of\r\n  two crossed vertical or meridional rings, perpendicular to one\r\n  another--the primary sagittal ring and the secondary frontal ring.\r\n  Commonly the two vertical rings are united at the base by a horizontal\r\n  basal ring, and between them remain two or more \"basal gates.\"\r\n\r\n  4. Family Tympanida (= Parastephida, 1881, p. 446). Skeleton composed of\r\n  two parallel horizontal rings, and upper mitral ring, and a lower basal\r\n  ring, both connected by vertical or divergent columellæ, which are parts\r\n  of vertical rings (primary sagittal, and secondary frontal ring).\r\n\r\nThe peculiar structure of the central capsule of the #Stephoidea#, and\r\ntheir character as true MONOPYLEA, were first recognised by Richard\r\nHertwig, who in 1879, in his Organismus der Radiolarien, gave an excellent\r\ndetailed description of it (_loc. cit._, pp. 68-72, Taf. vii. figs. 4, 5).\r\nHe also pointed out the near affinity of these \"Acanthodesmida\" with the\r\n#Spyroidea# or Zygocyrtida, uniting the latter with the former family.\r\n\r\nA fuller explanation of this affinity, and of the morphological and\r\nphylogenetic importance of the \"Acanthodesmida,\" as ancestral forms of the\r\n#Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#, was given in 1882 by Bütschli (Zeitschr. f.\r\nwiss. Zool., vol. xxxvi. pp. 495-501). He described in detail some\r\nimportant fossil forms of Acanthodesmida as different species of\r\n\"_Stephanolithis_,\" a name which Ehrenberg had employed for various\r\nring-like fragments of Radiolarian shells, sponges, and other fossil\r\nbodies. The four fossil species which Bütschli described represent four\r\ndifferent genera of #Stephoidea#, viz., _Semantis_ (_spinescens_),\r\n_Semantrum_ (_mülleri_), _Semantidium_ (_haeckelii_), and _Tristephanium_\r\n(_hertwigii_). On the phylogenetic conclusions, derived from these accurate\r\nobservations, compare above, p. 893, &c. The topographical signification of\r\nthe parts, employed by Bütschli, is contrary to mine; he calls my dorsal\r\nside the \"anterior,\" and my ventral side the \"posterior.\"\r\n\r\nThe geometrical fundamental form of the body in nearly all #Stephoidea#\r\n(with few exceptions) is distinctly bilateral or \"dipleuric,\" so that we\r\ncan easily distinguish the {933}three different dimensive axes: the\r\nprincipal axis with different apical and basal poles, the sagittal axis\r\nwith different dorsal and ventral poles, and the lateral axis with\r\nequivalent right and left poles. In only a few genera this bilateral\r\nsymmetry is not expressed, and a simpler, more regular fundamental form\r\nappears. The latter may be either primary (in the monaxonian _Archicircus_\r\nand _Lithocircus_) or secondary, afterwards acquired (in the octahedral\r\n_Trissocircus_ and _Trissocyclus_, the cubical _Lithocubus_, the prismatic\r\n_Eutympanium_, and some other forms).\r\n\r\nThe most important element of the skeleton, with which the formation\r\nbegins, in all #Stephoidea# is the simple primary or sagittal ring, lying\r\nvertically in the sagittal or median plane of the body and surrounding the\r\nmonaxonian central capsule. This sagittal ring is the only essential\r\nelement of the skeleton in all Stephanida, and is completely preserved in\r\nall Semantida, also in the greater part of the Coronida and Tympanida. It\r\nis partially reduced in the small groups of the true Acanthodesmida\r\n(subfamily of Coronida) and the Dystympanida and Eutympanida (subfamilies\r\nof Tympanida). Here only the vertical parts of it are preserved (dorsal and\r\nventral rod), whilst the horizontal parts are lost (mitral and basal rod).\r\n\r\nThe sagittal ring lies constantly in the vertical median plane of the body,\r\nand therefore divides the enclosed central capsule into a right and a left\r\nhalf. It is rarely regular or subregular, commonly dipleuric or distinctly\r\nbilateral, so that we may easily distinguish its dorsal and ventral, apical\r\nand basal parts. The most important of these four parts or \"rods\" is the\r\n\"basal rod\" or the inferior part, because here the ring is in closer\r\nconnection with the central capsule and its \"porous area\"; here peculiar\r\nspines or branches are commonly developed, which even on the isolated ring\r\nimmediately determine the basal pole. The opposite upper part, or the\r\n\"mitral rod,\" is also often distinguished by the peculiar appendages. The\r\nposterior part, or the \"dorsal rod\" (the anterior rod, _a_, in the\r\ndescription of Bütschli), is commonly more straight, often quite vertical.\r\nThe opposite anterior part, or the \"ventral rod\" (the posterior rod, _b_,\r\nof Bütschli), is usually more convex, and often strongly curved or\r\nsemicircular.\r\n\r\nWhilst this dipleuric or bilateral (commonly obliquely ovate or nearly\r\ntriangular) form of the sagittal ring is distinctly preserved in by far the\r\ngreater number of #Stephoidea#, it is replaced in some few genera by a more\r\nregular, amphithect, diphragmatic, or biradial form. In this case we may\r\noften suppose a primary regularity to exist, the dorsal and ventral parts\r\nbeing not yet differentiated, as in _Archicircus_ and _Lithocircus_,\r\n_Zygostephanus_ and _Protympanium_, and perhaps also in some other forms.\r\nBut in other cases the regularity is, on the contrary, secondary, being\r\nderived from original bilateral forms.\r\n\r\nThe rod of the sagittal ring is either cylindrical (with circular\r\ntransverse section) or angular (commonly with triangular transverse\r\nsection). In nearly all #Stephoidea# (with very few exceptions) branches or\r\napophyses are developed from the ring, regularly disposed and often of\r\ngreat morphological importance. Commonly these {934}apophyses are developed\r\nin pairs, growing symmetrically on both sides of the ring. The most\r\nimportant of these apophyses are:--(1) Basal apophyses, arising from the\r\nbasal hole of the ring; (2) mitral apophyses, arising from the apical pole;\r\n(3) dorsal apophyses, arising from the middle of the dorsal rod; and (4)\r\nventral apophyses, arising from the middle of the ventral rod. The two\r\nformer arise in the principal axis, the two latter in the sagittal axis of\r\nthe body. Very frequently the latter pair is replaced by two pairs of\r\ntransverse branches, one inferior (mandibular) and one superior (orbital).\r\nThe apophyses of the ring are either simple or branched, often very large,\r\nrichly ramified, and give origin to a number of further products.\r\n\r\nWhilst in the Stephanida the primary sagittal ring alone represents the\r\nwhole skeleton, it produces in all other #Stephoidea# one or more secondary\r\nrings. The most important of these is the horizontal basal ring, appearing\r\nfirst in the Semantida (Pl. 92). From the base of the sagittal ring there\r\narise in the horizontal basal plane two pairs of lateral branches or \"basal\r\napophyses.\" The curved opposite branches of the corresponding pairs become\r\nunited on each side of the primary ring (right and left), and so produce a\r\nsecond, horizontal ring, perpendicular to the former. This basal ring\r\nencloses two paired basal gates, which are enclosed on the medial side by\r\nthe basal rod of the sagittal ring, and on the lateral side by two united\r\napophyses (_Semantis_, Pl. 92, figs. 1, 2). These two primary basal gates\r\nare of the greatest morphological importance; we call them the \"jugular\r\ngates or jugular pores\" (in the description of Bütschli, the pores I, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 498). The dorsal pair of basal apophyses (on their posterior\r\nedge) are the coracal rods, _e_ (rods _e_ of Bütschli); the opposite\r\nventral pair (on their anterior edge) are the clavicular or furcular rods,\r\n_f_ (rods _e_1 of Bütschli); compare Pls. 92-95, and their explanation.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of _Semantis_, the prototype of the Semantida, thus assumes\r\nthe characteristic form of a signet-ring. The basal ring enclosing the two\r\njugular pores corresponds to the seal-plate. It is commonly more or less\r\nhorizontal; but often the apophyses descend obliquely (Pl. 92, figs. 1, 2,\r\n13, &c.), more rarely laterally (Pl. 29, fig. 11). The further development\r\nof this typical form is essentially effected by the production of new basal\r\npores in the horizontal seal-plate. In _Semantrum_ (Pl. 92, figs. 3, 4, 5)\r\nwe find already four basal gates. Behind the jugular gates is formed a\r\nsecond pair, the \"cardinal gates\" (pores II of Bütschli). These are\r\nenclosed on the anterior margin by the coracal rods (_e_), on the posterior\r\nmargin by the scapular rods (_d_), a third pair of basal apophyses, arising\r\nbehind the former from the sagittal ring and uniting with them (the rods\r\n_e_2 of Bütschli). Commonly the two posterior, or cardinal gates are much\r\nlarger than the two anterior, jugular gates. This characteristic basal\r\nplate of _Semantrum_, with two pairs of basal pores, is of the greatest\r\nmorphological importance, as it is inherited in by far the greater number\r\nof the NASSELLARIA, though not so generally as Bütschli supposes. The basal\r\nring of _Semantrum_ is either more circular {935}or elliptical, or more\r\npolygonal, and is connected with the basal rod of the sagittal ring by\r\nthree pairs of radial apophyses, the anterior furcular, the middle coracal,\r\nand the posterior scapular rods.\r\n\r\nA third important form of Semantida is _Semantidium_ (Pl. 92, figs. 6, 7).\r\nHere we find three pairs of basal pores in the seal-plate; the third pair,\r\nnewly formed, consists of the cervical gates (_e_), bounded in front by the\r\nscapular rods (_d_), behind by a fourth pair of basal apophyses, the\r\ncervical rods.\r\n\r\nThe basal apophyses of the sagittal ring are not only of great\r\nmorphological importance, because they produce by their union three typical\r\npairs of basal gates or \"collar pores,\" but also because their\r\nprolongations often appear as typical basal feet. The distal prolongations\r\nof the coracal rods appear in _Semantiscus_ (Pl. 92, figs. 16-18) as two\r\npectoral feet, those of the scapular rods as two tergal feet, whilst the\r\nopposite prolongations of the basal rod of the sagittal ring appear as two\r\n\"sagittal feet\" (in front an anterior or sternal, and behind a posterior or\r\ncaudal foot). In the typical _Cortiniscus_ (Pl. 92, figs. 11-13) only three\r\nfeet are developed; an odd caudal and two paired pectoral feet (compare\r\nabove, p. 891). The typical basal ring of the Semantida, with its paired\r\nbasal gates (_Semantis_), reappears in the majority of the Coronida,\r\ndiffering from the former in the development of a second vertical ring,\r\nwhich lies in the frontal plane (perpendicular to the sagittal ring), and\r\nwhich we therefore call the frontal ring. In only one small group of the\r\nCoronida the basal ring is absent, namely, in the Zygostephanida, and here\r\nthe frontal ring appears in the simplest form, as a complete elliptical\r\nmeridian ring, crossing the sagittal ring perpendicularly on the two poles\r\nof the main axis (_Zygostephanus_, Pl. 93, figs. 1-4), Four large lateral\r\ngates between the two rings remain open. This form may be derived directly\r\nfrom the Stephanida in the following way; from both poles of a simple\r\nsagittal ring there arise two opposite lateral apophyses, which in the\r\nfrontal plane become curved one towards the other, and united in the poles\r\nof the transverse axis. The basal apophyses would be the coracal rods. But\r\nit is also possible that _Zygostephanus_ was derived from _Semantis_ by the\r\nloss of the furcular rods.\r\n\r\nThe three typical rings (or the \"dimensive rings\") of the #Stephoidea#\r\nappear in their most complete form in the subfamily Trissocyclida (Pl. 93,\r\nfigs. 7, 13). Here all three rings are undivided and completely developed\r\nin the three dimensive planes, perpendicular one to another. Between them\r\nthere remain eight large open gates; the four superior are the four\r\n\"lateral gates\" of _Zygostephanus_, the four inferior are the four basal\r\ngates of _Semantrum_. The four latter are originally much smaller than the\r\nfour former; but in _Trissocircus_ and _Trissocyclus_ (Pl. 93, figs. 10-12)\r\nthey reach the same size. Therefore all eight gates are here of equal form\r\nand similar size, and the basal ring, now a true equatorial ring, divides\r\nthe two meridional rings into two equal halves.\r\n\r\nIn the Eucoronida, a third subfamily of Coronida, the sagittal and the\r\nbasal rings {936}are complete, but the frontal ring is incomplete, its\r\nbasal part being wanting (Pl. 82, figs. 4-6). Therefore we find here six\r\nlarge gates between the three rings; four upper lateral gates (between the\r\ntwo crossed vertical rings) and two lower basal gates (between the basal\r\nrod of the sagittal ring and the two halves of the basal ring).\r\n_Eucoronis_, the type of this subfamily, may be derived either directly\r\nfrom _Semantis_ by development of a frontal ring, or from _Tristephanium_\r\nby loss of the basal part of the frontal ring.\r\n\r\nA quite simple basal ring with a single gate, distinguishes the fourth\r\nsubfamily of Coronida, the Acanthodesmida (_sensu restricto_), the genera\r\n_Coronidium_ (Pl. 82, figs. 1, 2, 7, 8) and _Acanthodesmia_ (Pl. 93, fig.\r\n5). The horizontal basal ring alone is here complete, whilst both vertical\r\nrings (the sagittal and frontal rings) are incomplete, their basal parts\r\nbeing wanting. Therefore there are here five gates, four lateral and one\r\nbasal. These forms may be derived from _Eucoronis_ by loss of the basal rod\r\nof the primary sagittal ring.\r\n\r\nThe Tympanida, the fourth family of #Stephoidea#, exhibit another type of\r\nring structure. Here two parallel horizontal rings are constantly\r\ndeveloped, one on the apical pole, the other on the basal pole of the\r\nsagittal ring. The latter is the same basal ring as in the Semantida and\r\nCoronida. The former is a \"mitral ring,\" developed in the same manner, by\r\nunion of two pairs of horizontal lateral branches, which arise on both\r\nsides from the apical rod (or mitral rod) of the sagittal ring. In the\r\nsimplest case these two parallel horizontal rings are connected only by the\r\nsagittal ring, which is either complete (_Protympanium_, Pl. 93, fig. 14)\r\nor incomplete (_Parastephanus_, Pl. 93, fig. 21). But commonly also an\r\nincomplete frontal ring is present, so that the two horizontal rings are\r\nconnected by four vertical or subvertical rods; two of these \"columellæ\"\r\nare the dorsal and ventral rods of the sagittal ring, the two others are\r\nthe lateral rods of the frontal ring. Between the former and the latter are\r\nsometimes developed two, four, or more accessory columellæ (probably halves\r\nof accessory incomplete diagonal meridian rings). In this way arise the\r\ncharacteristic \"drum-forms\" of many Tympanida, in which the two parallel\r\nhorizontal rings correspond to the upper and lower rings of a drum, whilst\r\nthe connecting vertical columellæ correspond to its parallel lateral rods\r\n(Pl. 83, figs. 1, 2, &c.).\r\n\r\nOriginally the two horizontal rings of these \"drum-shells\" are both\r\nbisected by the complete sagittal ring, each provided with two lateral\r\ngates (Protympanida). But in the Eutympanida both rings exhibit one simple\r\ngate only, the apical and the basal rod of the sagittal ring being lost. In\r\nthe Paratympanida both rings are closed by a secondary lattice-plate whilst\r\nin the Dystympanida the upper (mitral) ring alone is closed by such a\r\nplate, the lower (basal) ring is open. In some Eutympanida the shell\r\nassumes the strange form of a regular geometrical cube, the twelve edges of\r\nwhich are represented by thin rods of silex (_Lithocubus_)--its four upper\r\nedges represent the mitral ring, the four lower the basal ring; two\r\nopposite of the four vertical {937}cube-edges are the lateral halves of the\r\nfrontal ring, the two other alternate ones are the remaining halves of the\r\nreduced sagittal ring (dorsal and ventral rod) (Pl. 82, fig. 12).\r\n\r\nIn many Tympanida and Coronida a loose irregular lattice or framework is\r\ndeveloped, which partly closes the large open gates. But this never reaches\r\nthe completeness of a true lattice-shell, such as we find in the\r\n#Spyroidea#, #Botryodea#, and #Cyrtoidea#. In by far the greater number of\r\n#Stephoidea# the corners, and partly also the rods, of the shell are armed\r\nwith numerous irregular spines, often forked or richly branched. Among\r\nthese spines the descending \"basal apophyses\" possess a peculiar\r\nimportance, since by their regular number and disposition they correspond\r\nto the radial rods of the #Plectoidea#, and to the typical \"feet\" of the\r\n#Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#. The most important of them are the three\r\ncortinar feet (one caudal and two pectoral) of _Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_,\r\n&c. (compare above, p. 891).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ exhibits in the #Stephoidea# the same characteristic\r\nstructure as in all other MONOPYLEA, first exactly pointed out by Richard\r\nHertwig in 1879 (Organismus der Radiol., p. 71, Taf. vii. figs. 4, 5). Its\r\nform is commonly ovate or ellipsoidal, sometimes also lentelliptical or\r\nnearly spherical. It exhibits constantly on the basal pole the porochora or\r\nporous area, and in the basal half the podoconus or pseudopodial cone. From\r\nthe surrounding sagittal ring it is separated by a thick jelly-like\r\ncalymma, which commonly exhibits numerous zooxanthellæ. The numerous\r\npseudopodia are commonly branched, with rather rare anastomoses. The\r\nmembrane of the central capsule is thick.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Families of_ #Stephoidea#.\r\n\r\n  I.

Skeleton composed of two parallel horizontal rings\r\n    (upper mitral and lower basal ring), both connected by\r\n    a vertical sagittal ring (and often by a vertical\r\n    frontal ring),                                           4. TYMPANIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily XLVIII. #STEPHANIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 81).\r\n\r\n  _Monostephida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 447.\r\n\r\n_Definition_.--#Stephoidea# with a simple sagittal ring, without any\r\nlattice-work.\r\n\r\nThe family #Stephanida# is the most simple of all #Stephoidea#, and\r\nprobably the common ancestral group of this suborder (compare above, p.\r\n933). The skeleton {938}consists of a simple ring only, surrounding the\r\ncentral capsule, and armed commonly with simple thorns or with larger\r\nbranched spines. The branches of these spines are constantly free, never\r\njoining together. Therefore the shell exhibits no trace of fenestration or\r\nlattice-work, no pores or gates, except the simple large gate of the ring\r\nitself. In all other #Stephoidea# we find secondary gates or lattice-work.\r\n\r\nThe first known form of this family is _Lithocircus annularis_, described\r\nby Johannes Müller in 1858 (Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 29,\r\nTaf. i. fig. 1). He observed already the central capsule (\"Blase\")\r\nsurrounded by the circular ring of silex, and the calymma (\"Strahlige\r\nGallert\") enveloping the whole body. The peculiar structure of the soft\r\nbody, particularly the \"area porosa\" on the basal pole of the central\r\ncapsule, and the pseudopodial cone within it, were first accurately\r\ndescribed by Hertwig (in 1879). A great number of simple rings, similar to\r\nthese, were found in the Challenger collection, and are here arranged in\r\nsix genera and forty-eight species.\r\n\r\nThe simple ring of silex, which alone forms the skeleton of the Stephanida,\r\ncorresponds to the primary or sagittal ring of the other #Stephoidea#, and\r\nlies therefore vertically in the median or sagittal plane of the body. We\r\ncan therefore distinguish on it four different segments, rods or bows, two\r\nof which are more horizontal, two more vertical. The former are one upper\r\nbow or apical rod, and one lower bow or basal rod. The latter are one\r\nposterior bow or dorsal rod, and one anterior bow or ventral rod. Sometimes\r\neach of these four component bows is distinguished by a corner-spine, or by\r\na pair of divergent branches.\r\n\r\nIn the two simplest (and probably oldest) genera of Stephanida, in\r\n_Archicircus_ and _Lithocircus_, the dorsal and ventral rods of the ring\r\nare equal and cannot be distinguished; therefore the fundamental form is\r\nhere amphithect, diphragmatic, or biradial (the poles of the sagittal axis\r\nbeing equal). In the four other genera the dorsal rod is more straight\r\n(often vertical) and more or less different from the ventral, convexly\r\ncurved rod; therefore the fundamental form is here dipleuric or bilateral,\r\nas in the greater number of all NASSELLARIA (the poles of the sagittal axis\r\nbeing unequal). The general form of the ring in this latter case is\r\ncommonly obliquely ovate or nearly triangular, the basal pole being more\r\npointed, the apical pole more rounded (Pl. 81).\r\n\r\nThe rods or bows of the ring are either roundish or cylindrical (with\r\ncircular or elliptical transverse section), or they are prismatic or\r\nangular (commonly with triangular transverse section). In the latter case\r\none edge usually is prominent in the sagittal plane (on the convex outside\r\nof the ring), whilst two other edges diverge laterally on both sides of it.\r\nThe inner or concave margin of the ring is commonly smooth.\r\n\r\nThe inner perimeter of the large gate, enclosed by the ring, is commonly\r\nrounded (elliptical or ovate), rarely angular. However, the outer perimeter\r\nof the ring is {939}nearly always polygonal, with prominent corners, and\r\nusually from these arise thorns or branched spines which are regularly\r\ndisposed. Regarding this disposition we may distinguish three cases: A, the\r\nspines lie in the sagittal plane and form a single row, arising from the\r\nmedian edge; B, the spines lie on both sides of the latter and form two\r\nparallel rows, arising from the two lateral edges; C, the spines represent\r\na combination of A and B, and are disposed in three rows, two paired rows\r\narising from the two lateral edges, and an odd middle row between them,\r\narising from the median edge. The spines are simple, without branches, in\r\n_Archicircus_ and _Zygocircus_; more or less branched in _Lithocircus_ and\r\n_Dendrocircus_. The branches are often richly ramified or arborescent, and\r\nexhibit great variety in size, special form, and direction (compare Pl.\r\n81).\r\n\r\nThe number and disposition of the spines or groups of spines are usually\r\nconstant, and may be employed in the further progress of our knowledge, to\r\ndistinguish a number of genera and subgenera. Very commonly (perhaps in the\r\nmajority of the Stephanida) we find six groups of spines, an apical group\r\non the upper rod of the sagittal ring, a basal group on the lower rod (on\r\nthe porochora of the central capsule), two ventral groups on the anterior\r\nrod, and two dorsal groups on the posterior rod. In other species we find\r\nfour or eight groups instead of six, and sometimes a larger number.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these apophyses of the ring are the basal spines,\r\narising from its basal pole, where the porochora of the central capsule\r\nrests upon it. They are often much larger and more branched than the other\r\nspines, and attain a peculiar morphological value in the small subfamily\r\nCortinida. Here we find three or four regularly disposed \"basal spines,\"\r\nwhich may be compared to the typical \"basal feet\" of the #Cyrtellaria#,\r\nappearing in the majority of #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#. _Cortina_, one of\r\nthe most important NASSELLARIA, bears three typical divergent feet on the\r\nbase of the simple ring, two paired anterior or \"pectoral feet,\" and an odd\r\nposterior or \"caudal foot.\" The latter appears as a direct basal\r\nprolongation of the dorsal rod of the ring, and is opposed to an upper\r\nprolongation of the same, which corresponds to the \"apical horn\" of the\r\n#Cyrtellaria# (Pl. 97, figs. 1-3). As already explained above, these three\r\nbasal feet of _Cortina_ possess the highest phylogenetic value, since they\r\nmay also be compared with the three primary radial spines of the\r\n#Plectoidea#, and so connect the #Cyrtellaria# and the #Plectellaria#.\r\n_Stephanium_ differs from _Cortina_ in the possession of four basal feet,\r\nan odd anterior or \"sternal foot\" being added to the three typical feet of\r\nthe latter (Pl. 92, figs. 20, 21). Some forms of #Plectoidea#\r\n(_Plagoniscus_, _Plectaniscus_, &c.) seem to be nearly related to these\r\nCortinida, and may be easily transformed into them by development of a\r\ncomplete ring, embracing the central capsule. They seem to demonstrate the\r\nnear affinity of all these triradiate NASSELLARIA (Pl. 91, figs. 4, 5, 9,\r\n10).\r\n\r\n{940}_Synopsis of the Genera of Stephanida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Fossil in\r\nBarbados.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{953}Family XLIX. #SEMANTIDA#, n. fam.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Stephoidea# with a single vertical ring (the primary\r\nsagittal ring), bearing on its base a horizontal ring (basal or cortinar\r\nring) with two to four or more basal gates (or cortinar pores).\r\n\r\nThe family #Semantida# differs from the preceding Stephanida in the\r\ndevelopment of a small horizontal ring on the base of the primary vertical\r\nsagittal ring. By the crossing of these two rings a small latticed basal\r\nplate is formed, with one or two pairs of pores; rarely with a greater\r\nnumber of \"basal pores.\" The production of this characteristic \"basal\r\nplate\" is of the greatest morphological importance, as the beginning of the\r\nnumerous different lattice-formations, which are differentiated in the\r\ngreat majority of NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\nIn my Prodromus (1881, p. 446) I had enumerated the Semantida with three\r\ngenera (Nos. 298 to 300) as a separate subfamily of the Dyostephida or\r\n\"Stephoidea biannularia,\" and characterised these \"Dyostephanida\" by the\r\nfollowing definition: \"Skeleto annulis duobus composito, qui in duobus\r\nplanis invicem perpendicularibus jacent; altero annulo (sagittali)\r\nverticali, altero (basali) horizontali.\" As the names there given were\r\nalready employed with another signification, and as the Zygostephanida\r\n(there united with the Dyostephanida) are more closely related to the\r\nCoronida, I now change the names, and propose to call the family Semantida,\r\nexpressing by this term the typical similarity of the skeleton to a\r\nsignet-ring (_Semantis_, _Semantrum_, _Semantidium_).\r\n\r\nAt about the same time, some #Stephoidea# of this family were accurately\r\ndescribed by Bütschli (1882, Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool., vol. xxxvi. p. 495,\r\nTaf. xxxii. figs. 6, 7, 8). He called them _Stephanolithis_, a name which\r\nEhrenberg had employed, not for complete shells of Radiolaria, but for\r\nisolated parts of such, and for siliceous fragments of different skeletons,\r\nneedles of Sponges, &c. The three species described by Bütschli represent\r\nthree different genera of our Semantida, viz., _Semantis spinescens_ (with\r\ntwo gates in the basal plate), _Semantrum mülleri_ (with four gates), and\r\n_Semantidium haeckelii_ (with six gates). He pointed out the great\r\nmorphological value of the fenestrated basal plate and its paired gates, as\r\nbeginnings of numerous other NASSELLARIA. But his opinion, that in all\r\n#Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#, derived from these, two pairs of basal gates\r\nwere constant, was erroneous, nor was the formation of the first pair\r\nnaturally explained; he supposed that the formation of the basal plate\r\nbegins by development of an odd sagittal apophysis, arising from the base\r\nof the primary sagittal ring. But this odd sagittal apophysis (\"der unpaare\r\nmediane Kieselfortsatz c1\", _loc. cit._, p. 497) is in reality not a\r\nprimary {954}and essential part of the skeleton, but secondary and of\r\nlittle morphological value, absent in the majority of the Semantida and of\r\nthe other NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\nWe divide our family Semantida into two different subfamilies, which\r\npossibly possess a direct phylogenetic relation to the two subfamilies of\r\nStephanida:--The Semantiscida have no typical feet, and have arisen\r\ndirectly from the Lithocircida; the Cortiniscida, however, possess the\r\nthree typical basal feet of _Cortina_, and may therefore be derived\r\ndirectly from the Cortinida. Since these three cortinar feet are probably\r\nidentical with the three primary radial rods of the #Plectoidea#, an\r\nimmediate affinity also to these NASSELLARIA is indicated.\r\n\r\nThe Semantiscida, which do not possess these three basal cortinar feet, are\r\nthe simpler forms of the family. The simplest of all, and perhaps the\r\ncommon ancestral form of the whole family, is _Semantis_ (Pl. 92, figs. 1,\r\n2). It may be derived from _Archicircus_ or _Zygocircus_ by development of\r\ntwo pairs of horizontal apophyses on its base, around the porochora of the\r\ncentral capsule. The two rods of each side (right and left), becoming\r\ncurved one towards the other, and meeting laterally, form a simple\r\nhorizontal gate, and the two paired basal gates together, a horizontal ring\r\nor basal ring, to which the primary sagittal ring is perpendicular. In the\r\nnext allied genus, _Semantrum_ (Pl. 92, figs. 3-5), three pairs of\r\nhorizontal apophyses are developed, and therefore two pairs of basal gates\r\nproduced, an anterior and a posterior. In the third genus, _Semantidium_\r\n(Pl. 92, figs. 6, 7), three pairs of basal pores or gates are visible,\r\nsurrounded and separated by four pairs of horizontal apophyses, which arise\r\nfrom the base of the sagittal ring. Finally, in _Clathrocircus_ (Pl. 92,\r\nfigs. 8-10) the number of apophyses is much increased, and two parallel\r\nrows of pores are developed along the two sides of the sagittal ring.\r\n\r\nThe basal plate or the \"seal,\" developed from the base of the primary\r\nsagittal ring or \"signet-ring,\" is therefore a horizontal ring, which\r\nbecomes bisected by the latter, and exhibits either one pair of primary\r\n\"basal gates\" or two or three pairs of these important basal pores, rarely\r\nmore. Since these pores possess the greatest morphological value, and are\r\nprobably everywhere homologous, we give to them and to the separating\r\napophyses certain names, and call the anterior pair of gates, \"jugular\r\npores\" (_i_ in our figures, the pair I of Bütschli); the middle (usually\r\nthe largest) pair, \"cardinal pores\" (_k_ in our figures, the pair II of\r\nBütschli), and the posterior, smaller pair, \"cervical pores,\" _l_. The\r\ntypical pairs of rods, by the union of which these basal pores arise, are\r\nthe following:--(1) the clavicular or furcular rods, _f_, the first pair\r\n(rods _e_1 of Bütschli), (2) the coracal rods, _e_, between the jugular and\r\ncardinal pores (rods _e_ of Bütschli), (3) the scapular rods, _g_, between\r\nthe cardinal and cervical pores (rods _e_2 of Bütschli), (4) the cervical\r\nrods, the fourth pair of apophyses, the most posterior, _h_. Bütschli\r\nsupposes that the topographical succession of the three typical pairs of\r\nbasal pores is also the chronological succession, the jugular being formed\r\nfirst, the {955}cardinal second and the cervical pores third but it seems\r\nthat this succession is often altered and that the cardinal pores (the\r\nlargest), appear first, the jugular pores (in front of them) second and the\r\ncervical pores third (or perhaps sometimes in the inverse succession).\r\n\r\nThe Cortiniscida, the second subfamily of Semantida, differ from the\r\npreceding Semantiscida in the possession of three typical basal feet, which\r\nare probably inherited from the Cortinida, and perhaps indirectly from the\r\nPlagonida (_Plagoniscus_). The simplest and the most important form of this\r\nsecond family is _Cortiniscus_ (Pl. 92, figs. 11-13), differing from its\r\nprobable ancestral form, _Cortina_, in the development of a basal ring,\r\nproduced by horizontal union of the basal apophyses. The three typical feet\r\nare the same as in all triradiate NASSELLARIA, two paired pectoral feet\r\n(_p__{1}, _p__{11}) diverging on the anterior base of the sagittal ring,\r\nwhilst the odd caudal foot (_c_) lies on its posterior base in the sagittal\r\nplane and appears as a basal prolongation of the dorsal rod of the sagittal\r\nring; the upper part of the dorsal rod is usually prolonged into an\r\nascending apical horn. In _Stephaniscus_ (Pl. 92, figs. 14, 15) four basal\r\nfeet are visible, an anterior or sternal foot (_z_) being added as a\r\nprolongation of the basal rod of the ring, opposite to the caudal foot.\r\nFinally, _Semantiscus_ (Pl. 92, figs. 16-18) is distinguished by the\r\npossession of six divergent basal feet, probably identical with those of\r\nall six-radiate NASSELLARIA; three of these may be regarded as primary and\r\nperradial, the odd caudal and the paired pectoral feet; the three other\r\nintercalated as secondary or interradial feet, the odd sternal (_z_) and\r\nthe paired tergal feet (_t__{1}, _t__{11}).\r\n\r\nThe basal plate of these Cortiniscida exhibits the same important\r\ndifferences as in the preceding Semantiscida, either one, or two, or three\r\npairs of basal gates being developed. But there occur also in some species\r\n(mainly in _Cortiniscus_) only three basal gates, an odd anterior (between\r\nthe two pectoral feet and a connecting horizontal bar), and two paired\r\nposterior (between the two pectoral and the odd caudal foot). It requires\r\nfurther accurate researches to solve the important problem, what the true\r\nhomologies of these typical basal pores and the separating bars are in the\r\ndifferent genera of Semantida. In _Semantiscus_ there are three pairs of\r\nbasal pores in the horizontal seal, corresponding to those of _Semantidium_\r\nand the radial rods or bars between, these are the basal parts of the six\r\nradial feet; therefore the odd caudal foot (_t_) seems to be the posterior,\r\nand the odd sternal foot (_z_) the anterior prolongation of the basal part\r\nof the primary sagittal ring; the two paired anterior or pectoral feet\r\n(_p__{1}, _p__{11}) the prolongations of the coracal rods (_e_) and the two\r\npaired posterior or tergal feet (_t__{1}, _t__{11}), the prolongations of\r\nthe scapular rods (_g_). But it is not yet certain whether these six radial\r\nfeet and the separating gates of the basal plate are all the same and truly\r\nhomologous in all six-radiate NASSELLARIA.

Behind\r\nthe pair of coracal rods there arises from the basilar rod of the sagittal\r\nring a third pair of lateral horizontal branches, the scapular rods. These\r\nbecome connected with the coracal rods on each side, and so produce a\r\nsecond posterior pair of basal pores, the \"cardinal gates.\" These are\r\nconstantly larger than the anterior \"jugular gates.\" Therefore the vertical\r\nring of _Semantrum_ possesses a horizontal basal ring with four very\r\ncharacteristic gates, enclosed by three pairs of lateral curved and\r\nconnected branches, and these become transmitted by heredity to the\r\nmajority of the NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Semantrum quadrifore_, n. sp.

CORONIDA#, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Triostephida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 445.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--STEPHOIDEA with two crossed vertical rings, perpendicular\r\none to the other (the primary sagittal and the secondary frontal ring).\r\nUsually their common base bears a horizontal basal ring, but a mitral ring\r\n(or a horizontal ring at the apex) is never developed.\r\n\r\nThe family #Coronida# comprises those #Stephoidea# in which the primary\r\nsagittal ring (of the Stephanida and Semantida) becomes crossed by a second\r\nvertical ring, the lateral or frontal ring. Between these two vertical\r\nmeridian rings, perpendicular to one another, four large apertures remain\r\nconstantly open, the \"lateral\" gates. But besides these four constant\r\nopenings, usually (excepting only in the Zygostephanida) other gates are\r\ndeveloped on the common base of the two crossed rings, produced by a third,\r\nhorizontal, basal ring. These basal gates are the same which we have found\r\nalready in the Semantida.\r\n\r\nThe distinction of the Coronida from the other #Stephoidea# is always easy.\r\nIn the Stephanida and Semantida, the frontal ring, or the second meridian\r\nring, which we find in all Coronida, is never developed. On the other hand\r\nthese latter never exhibit the typical \"mitral ring,\" or the second, upper,\r\nhorizontal ring, which distinguishes the Tympanida.\r\n\r\nWe distinguish here, among the Coronida, four different subfamilies, which\r\nperhaps afterwards may be better separated as families. Of these four\r\ngroups the Zygostephanida and Acanthodesmida exhibit the nearest\r\nrelationship to the Stephanida, whilst the Eucoronida and Trissocyclida\r\npossess a closer affinity with the Semantida.\r\n\r\n{968}The Zygostephanida, constituting the first subfamily, exhibit four\r\nlarge gates only, and differ from all other Coronida in the absence of a\r\nbasal ring and of basal gates. Therefore the skeleton is entirely composed\r\nof two crossed vertical rings, perpendicular to one another; the first is\r\nthe primary or sagittal ring (inherited from the Stephanida), the second is\r\nthe new lateral or frontal ring. The four large lateral gates are either\r\nquite simple (_Zygostephanus_) or partly closed by loose and irregular\r\nlattice-work (_Zygostephanium_). The Zygostephanida may be derived directly\r\nfrom the Stephanida by development of lateral branches forming a frontal\r\nring. They commonly possess the same characteristic spines or branches, and\r\nthe same typical difference between the straight dorsal rod and convex\r\nventral rod of the sagittal ring, which we found in the greater number of\r\nStephanida. The frontal ring is commonly elliptical or kidney-shaped, and\r\nmuch larger than the ovate sagittal ring.\r\n\r\nThe Acanthodesmida, forming the second subfamily of Coronida, differ from\r\nall other members of this family in the possession of a large simple basal\r\ngate, surrounded by a simple horizontal basal ring. Only this ring is\r\ncomplete, whilst the two crossed vertical meridian rings (the primary\r\nsagittal and the secondary frontal ring) are incomplete, both truncated at\r\nthe base by the basal ring. Therefore there remain here between the three\r\nrings five large gates (recognised previously by Johannes Müller in 1856 in\r\n_Acanthodesmia_): four lateral gates (the same as in the Zygostephanida)\r\nand one central basal gate. The latter is always quite simple and serves\r\nfor the emission of the pseudopodia, arising from the basal pole of the\r\ncentral capsule. The four lateral gates are either quite simple\r\n(_Coronidium_) or partly closed by irregular loose lattice-work\r\n(_Acanthodesmia_). The subfamily Acanthodesmida may be derived either\r\ndirectly from the Stephanida (by development of a central basal gate) or\r\nfrom the Eucoronida (by loss of the basilar part of the sagittal ring).\r\n\r\nThe Eucoronida, the third subfamily, are the most important group of the\r\nCoronida; their numerous species are much more frequent and more widely\r\ndistributed than those of the other three subfamilies. They may be derived\r\nimmediately from the Semantida by the development of a lateral or frontal\r\nring. This remains incomplete in the basal part, whilst the two other\r\nrings, perpendicular to it (the vertical sagittal ring and the horizontal\r\nbasal ring), are complete. Therefore the shell constantly exhibits six\r\nlarge open gates between the three rings; four lateral gates (the same as\r\nin the Zygostephanida and Acanthodesmida) and two basal gates (inherited\r\nfrom _Semantis_); the latter correspond to the \"jugular pores\" of the\r\n#Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#; they remain constantly simple. The four\r\nlateral gates may also remain simple (_Eucoronis_) or they may become\r\npartly closed by irregular loose lattice-work (_Plectocoronis_). The\r\nremarkable genus _Podocoronis_ is distinguished by the development of\r\ntypical descending basal feet, which are regularly disposed and correspond\r\nto the typical \"cortinar feet\" of the other NASSELLARIA. There may be\r\ndeveloped either two lateral feet (as lower {969}prolongations of the\r\nsegments of the frontal ring), or three feet (one caudal and two pectoral,\r\nas in _Cortina_ and _Cortiniscus_), or four feet (two sagittal and two\r\nlateral, as in _Stephanium_ and _Stephaniscus_), or six feet (two sagittal,\r\ntwo pectoral, two tergal, as in _Semantiscus_), sometimes numerous feet (as\r\nin _Petalospyris_ and _Anthocyrtis_, &c.).\r\n\r\nThe Trissocyclida represent the fourth and last subfamily of Coronida,\r\ndistinguished from all others in the possession of three complete rings,\r\nperpendicular one to another, and of eight large gates separated by them.\r\nTwo of the three rings are vertical (the primary sagittal and the secondary\r\nfrontal ring), the third is horizontal (the basal ring). The four upper\r\ngates correspond to the four lateral gates of the preceding three\r\nsubfamilies; the four lower gates are the same as the four basal gates of\r\n_Semantrum_ (two primary jugular and two secondary cardinal gates);\r\ntherefore the Trissocyclida may be derived directly from these Semantida by\r\ndevelopment of a complete frontal ring. Probably the two jugular gates were\r\noriginally smaller than the two cardinal, but usually they have become\r\nequal. In _Tristephanium_ (the common ancestral form of the Trissocyclida)\r\nand in the closely allied _Tricyclidium_ the four basal gates remain\r\nsmaller than the four lateral gates. But in two other genera,\r\n_Trissocircus_ and _Trissocyclus_, the four lower or basal gates reach the\r\nsame size as the four upper or lateral gates; therefore all eight gates\r\nbecome equal and the basal ring becomes equatorial. In the most regular\r\nspecies of the latter genera also the three rings become perfectly equal\r\nand cannot be any longer distinguished. Here the original bilateral (or\r\ndipleuric) fundamental form of the shell passes over into a regular cubic\r\nor octahedral form (with three equal, isopolar axes, perpendicular one to\r\nanother). The eight large gates of the Trissocyclida usually remain simple\r\n(_Tristephanium_, _Trissocircus_), but sometimes they become partly closed\r\nby loose lattice-work (_Tricyclidium_, _Trissocyclus_).\r\n\r\nThe original rings, and the secondary rods or bars, composing the loose\r\nframework of the Coronida are either roundish (with circular or elliptical\r\ntransverse section) or three-edged (with triangular transverse section),\r\nrarely quadrangular or provided with distorted edges. The branches or\r\nspines arising from them, are either simple or branched, and offer a great\r\nvariety in number, form, and disposition. The most important forms are\r\nthose which develop the three typical basal feet of _Cortina_, _e.g._,\r\n_Podocoronis cortina_ (Pl. 97, fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThe _Central Capsule_ of the Coronida is the same as in the other\r\n#Stephoidea# (comp. p. 937), and offers all those characteristic\r\npeculiarities of \"Monopylea\" which we have mentioned above in the general\r\ndescription of the NASSELLARIA (p. 890). Usually it is spherical or\r\nellipsoidal, often violin-shaped or bilobed, with a sagittal constriction.\r\nThe porochora of its basal pole is in close contact with the base of the\r\nsagittal ring.\r\n\r\n{970}_Synopsis of the Genera of Coronida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Skeleton composed of two incomplete meridional rings and one\r\ncomplete basal ring, without lattice-work.\r\n\r\n{974}The genus _Coronidium_ and the following, nearly allied\r\n_Acanthodesmia_, form together the peculiar subfamily of\r\nAcanthodesmida--not in the wider sense in which I first founded this group\r\n(1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 265), but in the restricted sense, which is\r\nexactly defined in my Prodromus (1881, p. 445). According to this\r\ndefinition, the shell is composed of three different rings, perpendicular\r\nto one another; only one of these is complete, the simple horizontal basal\r\nring; the two others are incomplete and vertical (the primary or sagittal\r\nand the secondary or frontal ring). Therefore there remain constantly\r\nbetween the three rings five characteristic large openings or gates; four\r\nof these are lateral (between the halves of the two meridional rings), the\r\nfifth is basal, enclosed by the horizontal basal ring. The longest known\r\ntype of this subfamily is _Acanthodesmia vinculata_, the five\r\ncharacteristic gates of which are clearly distinguished by its discoverer,\r\nJohannes Müller (\"Das Gehäuse besteht nur aus den Leisten zwischen fünf\r\ngrossen Lücken\"). The Acanthodesmida may be derived from the Eucoronida by\r\nreduction of the basilar rod of the sagittal ring. If in _Eucoronis_ this\r\nbasal rod be lost, _Coronidium_ arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Coronidium dyostephanus_, n. sp.

Since these three rings lie\r\nin the three dimensive planes, they are perpendicular to one another; and\r\nbetween them remain eight large open gates. Originally the four upper or\r\nlateral gates (corresponding to those of _Zygostephanus_) are much larger,\r\nthe four lower or basal gates (corresponding to those of _Semantrum_) much\r\nsmaller; but afterwards the latter may reach the size of the former, so\r\nthat the basal ring becomes equatorial (in _Trissocircus_ and\r\n_Trissocyclus_). The common ancestral form of the Trissocyclida\r\n(_Tristephanium_) may be derived directly either from _Semantrum_ (by\r\ncomplete development of the frontal ring) or from _Eucoronis_ (by complete\r\ndevelopment of four basal gates).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Triostephus_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 445.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Sagittal and frontal ring of different size and form.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Tristephanium dimensivum,_ n. sp.

Therefore the same formation, which we found in the\r\nSemantida on the basal pole only of the main axis, here takes place also on\r\nits apical pole. On both poles arise at each side from the sagittal ring\r\ntwo corresponding pairs of curved branches: the lateral ends of the\r\nopposite branches (dorsal and ventral branch) become united in the frontal\r\nplane and so form two complete horizontal rings. The upper ring, composed\r\nof the superior or mitral branches, may be called the mitral ring, the\r\nlower ring, formed by the inferior or basal branches, the basal ring. Both\r\nrings are commonly of nearly equal size, more rarely of different sizes.\r\nTheir connection is effected either by the primary (sagittal) ring only, or\r\nalso by secondary vertical rings, a frontal ring in the lateral plane, or\r\nsome diagonal meridian rings between the latter and the former. These\r\nvertical rings, which connect both horizontal rings in the form of\r\n\"columellæ,\" may be either complete or incomplete; in the latter case their\r\napical and basal parts are lost, the dorsal and ventral parts only being\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe Tympanida develop a great variety of different forms, greater than in\r\nthe three other families of #Stephoidea#, so that we may distinguish here\r\nnot less than sixteen genera and seventy-two species. Hitherto only three\r\nspecies were known: _Prismatium tripleurum_, figured in 1862 in my\r\nMonograph, _Tympanidium barbadense_, figured by Bury in the \"fossil\r\nPolycystins of Barbados,\" and _Tympaniscus fibula_, described in 1875 by\r\nEhrenberg as a _Ceratospyris fibula_. The number of species in this large\r\nand richly developed group will be considerably augmented by further\r\nresearches. A great many of them exhibit remarkable relations to different\r\nNASSELLARIA. For better survey of the whole family we distinguish here four\r\nsubfamilies, the first of which (Protympanida) is probably the common\r\nancestral group of the other three. They may have been derived originally\r\neither from the Semantida or directly from the Stephanida.\r\n\r\nThe first subfamily, Protympanida, exhibits a complete primary or vertical\r\nsagittal ring, bearing on the upper part a horizontal mitral ring, on the\r\nlower part a horizontal basal ring. Therefore the gates of these two\r\nparallel rings become bisected by the sagittal ring, each divided into a\r\nright and a left half. The sagittal ring itself becomes divided by the two\r\nhorizontal rings into four parts or rods; two opposite of these are more or\r\nless vertical; the dorsal (posterior) and the ventral (anterior) rod; the\r\ntwo other rods are more or less horizontal; the mitral (upper) and the\r\nbasal (lower) rod.\r\n\r\nIn _Protympanium_ (Pl. 93, fig. 14), the simplest and most primitive form\r\nof Tympanida, the connection of the two horizontal rings is effected only\r\nby the dorsal and ventral rods of the sagittal ring forming two parallel\r\nmore or less vertical \"columellæ.\" In all other Protympanida accessory\r\ncolumellæ are developed between the latter. In the greater number we find\r\ntwo secondary columellæ in the lateral plane, being the lateral\r\n{989}segments of an incomplete frontal ring (_Acrocubus_, Pl. 93, figs.\r\n15-17). Between the latter and the former there are sometimes developed\r\nfour tertiary columellæ, as segments of two crossed incomplete diagonal\r\nrings (_Tympanidium_, Pl. 94, figs. 1, 18). At other times we find six\r\ncolumellæ; here probably the frontal ring is cleft into halves on each side\r\n(_Tympaniscus_, Pl. 94, figs. 4-7). Some genera are distinguished by the\r\ndevelopment of an equatorial ring, or a third horizontal ring (between the\r\nupper mitral and the lower basal ring); this equatorial ring is either\r\ncomplete (_Microcubus_ Pl. 94, figs. 8-10) or incomplete, developed only\r\nlaterally (_Octotympanum_, Pl. 94, figs. 2, 3). The genus _Toxarium_ (Pl.\r\n93, figs. 18-20) is distinguished by the development of accessory pairs of\r\nbows in the frontal plane, upper or galear bows and lower or thoracal bows,\r\nremarkable as beginnings of the accessory joints, which we distinguish in\r\nmany #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea# as \"galea and thorax.\"\r\n\r\nThe second subfamily of Tympanida are the Paratympanida, in which the two\r\nhorizontal rings become closed by lattice-work. The numerous columellæ\r\nconnecting the two rings are here either divergent (_Paratympanum_, with\r\ntwo unequal rings, Pl. 94, fig. 14) or parallel and vertical\r\n(_Lithotympanum_, with two equal rings, Pl. 83, fig. 1). The shell of the\r\nlatter assumes the form of a drum.\r\n\r\nA third small subfamily, Dystympanida, is represented by a single genus\r\nonly, _Dystympanium_ (Pl. 94, figs. 15, 16). Here only the upper or mitral\r\nring is closed by lattice-work, whilst the lower or basal ring exhibits\r\nquite a simple opening, a large \"basal gate\" which has probably arisen by\r\nloss of the basilar rod of the sagittal ring. These curious forms exhibit a\r\nremarkable resemblance to some Monocyrtida, and also to the _Dictyocha_\r\n(PHÆODARIA).\r\n\r\nThe fourth subfamily, the Eutympanida, are distinguished by the simple wide\r\naperture of the two horizontal rings; the upper enclosing a simple \"mitral\r\ngate,\" the lower a simple \"basal gate.\" Here probably the two horizontal\r\nparts of the sagittal ring (the upper mitral rod and the lower basilar rod)\r\nare lost by reduction; its two vertical parts (the dorsal and ventral rods)\r\nonly remaining and forming the two parallel columellæ, which connect the\r\ntwo horizontal rings (_Parastephanus_, Pl. 93, fig. 21). In this group also\r\nsecondary columellæ are commonly developed between the two rings,\r\nalternating with the two primary columellæ. _Pseudocubus_ (Pl. 94, figs.\r\n11, 12), resembling an obelisk, exhibits four divergent columellæ; the two\r\nsagittal of these are probably the vertical parts of the primary ring,\r\nwhilst the two lateral are the halves of an incomplete frontal ring. In\r\n_Lithocubus_ (Pl. 82, fig. 12) the four columellæ are parallel and\r\nvertical, the two rings being equal; the shell here assumes the form of a\r\ngeometrical cube. _Prismatium_ is distinguished by three parallel\r\ncolumellæ; two of these are probably parts of a frontal ring, whilst the\r\nthird is the remains of a reduced sagittal ring. In _Circotympanum_ (Pl.\r\n94, fig. 17) and in _Lithotympanum_ (Pl. 82, fig. 11) the number of the\r\ncolumellæ is augmented, there being six to eight or more; in the former\r\nthey are divergent {990}(the two rings being of different sizes), in the\r\nlatter parallel (the two rings being equal); the fundamental form of the\r\nformer is a truncated pyramid, of the latter a prism.\r\n\r\nComparing these differences between the four subfamilies of Tympanida, we\r\nmay suppose that the common ancestral group are the Protympanida, derived\r\nfrom the Semantida by the formation of a mitral ring. If the two horizontal\r\nrings become closed by lattice-work, the Paratympanida arise. When the\r\nmitral ring only becomes latticed, the basal ring being simple, the\r\nDystympanida originate. Finally, the fourth subfamily, the Eutympanida, may\r\nbe derived from the Protympanida by the loss of the two horizontal parts of\r\nthe sagittal ring.\r\n\r\nThe two horizontal rings (upper mitral and lower basal) and the two\r\nvertical rings (primary sagittal and secondary frontal), which thus compose\r\nthe loose framework of the Tympanida, are rarely smooth, commonly armed\r\nwith spines or branches, similar to those of the Coronida. The rods or bars\r\nare either roundish (with circular transverse section) or angular (commonly\r\nwith triangular transverse section). The paired branches of the two\r\nvertical rings often preserve the characteristic arrangement inherited from\r\nthe Semantida and Stephanida. The two horizontal rings sometimes exhibit\r\ntypical apophyses, which recur in the #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#. The\r\nmitral ring may possess one odd apical horn and two paired frontal horns\r\n(Pl. 93, figs. 16, 17, 19, 23). The basal ring sometimes bears the three\r\ntypical feet of _Cortina_ (Pl. 93, figs. 16, 22), one odd caudal foot and\r\ntwo paired pectoral feet. Sometimes a fourth (sternal) foot is developed\r\n(Pl. 94, fig. 4), at other times only two lateral feet (Pl. 94, figs. 5,\r\n6).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Tympanida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

A simple complete sagittal ring bears on the superior and\r\non the inferior part two opposite pairs of lateral branches; by union of\r\nthe convergent branches of each side there arise two horizontal parallel\r\nquadrangular rings, which are bisected by the sagittal ring.

In the frontal plane two galear bows project\r\nupwards, and two thoracal bows downwards.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Toxarium_ differs from its ancestral form _Acrocubus_ in the\r\ndevelopment of two pairs of peculiar bows, placed in the lateral or frontal\r\nplane; the upper pair projects above the mitral gates, and may be called\r\nthe \"galear bows,\" the lower pair projects below the basal gates of the\r\ncubical shell, and may be called the \"thoracal bows.\" Both pairs are\r\nproduced originally by the development of two forked vertical spines,\r\narising in the frontal plane on both poles of the principal axis from the\r\nsagittal ring (compare _Protympanium amphipodium_, Pl. 93, fig. 14). The\r\napical fork-branches become connected with the lateral corners of the\r\nmitral gates, the basal branches with those of the basal gates.

Eight\r\nlarge gates.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Octotympanum_ differs from all other Tympanida in the peculiar\r\nconnection of the two horizontal rings, which here reach the maximum of\r\ntheir growth, converge towards the equator, and come into direct contact on\r\nthe poles of the equatorial transverse axis. Therefore the shell appears to\r\nbe composed of three complete vertical meridian rings, the middle of which\r\n(the sagittal ring) is free and simple; the two other (subfrontal) rings\r\nare grown together at the lateral poles of the equatorial plane; commonly\r\nat these poles there arises (on the right and left) a strong lateral spine,\r\nand the base of this (or the crossing point of the two touching horizontal\r\nrings) corresponds to the remnants of the shortened frontal ring. The\r\ncrown-shaped shell exhibits therefore eight large gates; two superior\r\n(mitral) and two inferior basal gates, two larger anterior (facial) and two\r\nlarger posterior (occipital) gates. Seen from the lateral poles {1000}only\r\ntwo of the former are visible, and represent the figure of a vertical 8;\r\nseen from the sagittal poles, only two of the latter are visible, in the\r\nform of a larger horizontal 8. _Octotympanum_ may be derived from\r\n_Acrocubus_ by reduction of the lateral frontal ring to a knot (or\r\ncross-point), and by maximal extension of the two parallel horizontal\r\nrings, which become curved downwards laterally and touch at the lateral\r\npoles.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Octotympanum octospinum_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nMitral gates smaller than the basal gates; upper halves of the two lateral\r\nmeridional rings smaller than the lower halves.

A new species from the\r\nChallenger collection (Pl. 93, fig. 22), _Prismatium tripodium_, explains\r\nthe true structure of this remarkable genus. The skeleton is composed of\r\nnine siliceous rods, corresponding to the edges of a trilateral prism. Six\r\nof these are horizontal, and enclose the two parallel triangular horizontal\r\ngates, the superior of which is formed by the mitral or coryphal, and the\r\ninferior by the basal or cortinar ring. The three other rods are vertical\r\nand nearly parallel, and connect (as lateral edges of the prism) the\r\ncorresponding corners of the two parallel horizontal triangles. Two of\r\nthese vertical columellæ, together with the two horizontal parallel rods\r\nconnecting them, represent the complete frontal ring, whilst the third\r\nvertical columella is the posterior half of the sagittal ring, the other\r\nparts of which are lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Prismatium tripodium_, n. sp.

This difference seems to indicate that these\r\ntwo odd spines correspond to the apical horn and the caudal foot of\r\n_Cortina_, and the columella between them is the rest of the reduced\r\nsagittal ring. In this case the quadrangular vertical ring, which is\r\ncomposed of the two paired columellæ and the two connecting horizontal\r\nrods, would be probably the frontal ring.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.09, breadth 0.07.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Equatorial Atlantic, Station 347, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1010}2. _Prismatium tripleurum_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Prismatium tripleurum,_ Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.

Two opposite ones of these four vertical columellæ are the\r\nremaining halves of the incomplete sagittal ring; the two alternate are the\r\nremaining halves of the incomplete frontal ring. The four lateral gates\r\nbetween these four columellæ are also square or rectangular, and either of\r\nthe same size as the two horizontal gates, or somewhat larger. _Lithocubus_\r\nmay be derived from _Acrocubus_ by reduction of the coryphal and the basal\r\npart of the primary sagittal ring, the only remaining parts of which are\r\nthe anterior and the posterior columellæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Lithocubus geometricus_, n. sp.

Sitzungsber., Feb. 16, p. 18). This\r\ngroup comprises all those MONOPYLEA or NASSELLARIA which possess a complete\r\nlattice-shell, whilst the preceding #Plectellaria# never develop a perfect\r\nfenestrated shell enveloping the central capsule. The #Spyroidea# differ\r\nfrom the other #Cyrtellaria# (#Botryodea# and #Cyrtoidea#) in the bilocular\r\nshape of the cephalis, which is bisected by the sagittal ring and a\r\ncorresponding longitudinal constriction into two symmetrical halves.\r\n\r\nThe #Spyroidea# appear in the first system of Polycystina of Ehrenberg\r\n(1847, _loc. cit._, pp. 53, 54) as the fourth of his seven families, under\r\nthe name Spyridina, with the following definition:--\"Testæ nucleo destitutæ\r\n(associatæ et coalitæ); cellulæ binæ clathratæ, nucis forma amplæ,\r\nstrictura longitudinali levius discretæ.\" Ehrenberg united them with his\r\n\"Polycystina composita or SPUMELLARIA\" and separated them from the closely\r\nallied \"Polycystina solitaria or NASSELLARIA.\" He distinguished among them\r\nfive genera, two of which have no external appendages (_Dictyospyris_ and\r\n_Pleurospyris_), whilst the other three possess spiny or lamellar\r\nappendages (_Ceratospyris_, _Cladospyris_, and _Petalospyris_). These five\r\ngenera and the accompanying definitions were also repeated in the same\r\nterms in the last system of Ehrenberg (1875, _loc. cit._, p. 157). In my\r\nMonograph (1862, pp. 280, 291) the #Spyroidea# are enumerated as a\r\n{1016}subfamily of the Cyrtida, under the name Zygocyrtida, with the\r\nfollowing definition:--\"Lattice-shell divided by an annular sagittal\r\nlongitudinal constriction into two neighbouring equal joints or chambers.\"\r\nI adopted at that time the above five genera of Ehrenberg, only eight\r\nspecies of which were known.\r\n\r\nRichard Hertwig gave in 1879 the first accurate description of the central\r\ncapsule of the #Spyroidea#, and demonstrated that they possess the same\r\ncharacteristic structure of the capsule, with a porochora and a podoconus,\r\nthat is common to all MONOPYLEA. He separated the Zygocyrtida from the\r\nother Cyrtida, and united them with the #Stephoidea# (_Lithocircus_) in the\r\nfamily Acanthodesmida. In my Prodromus (1881, p. 449) I adopted that\r\ndivision and put the \"Spyrida or #Spyroidea#\" as a separate family between\r\nthe #Cyrtoidea# and #Stephoidea#. I there gave the following\r\ndefinition:--\"_Monopylaria gemina_, testa silicea clathrata gemina, cameris\r\nbinis juxta compositis, annulo verticali sagittali contiguis, capsula\r\ncentrali a testa inclusa. Promorpha dipleura vel bilaterali, dextro et\r\nsinistro antimero symmetricis, plano sagittali annuloque separatis. Polum\r\nsuperiorem axis verticalis vel principalis plerumque spina apicalis (vel\r\noccipitalis) occupat, polum inferiorem ostium clathratum (poris tribus aut\r\nquatuor aut pluribus) et spina caudalis (posterior). Ad dextram et\r\nsinistram duæ spinæ laterales distant. Ab hac forma tripoda (Monocyrtida\r\ntriradiata acuta cum annulo mediano) diversæ Spyridum formæ derivandæ\r\nsunt.\" I there divided the Spyrida into seven subfamilies and forty-eight\r\ngenera. Bütschli in 1882 published accurate researches on the Zygocyrtida\r\nin his Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Radiolarien-Skelete, insbesondere der der\r\nCyrtida (Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool., vol. xxxvi. p. 501, Taf. xxxii.). He\r\ngave a very exact anatomical description of the skeleton of several fossil\r\n#Spyroidea# of Barbados, and pointed out their close affinity to the\r\nAcanthodesmida on the one hand, and to the Cyrtida on the other. Regarding\r\ntheir phylogenetical relation, he supposed that the Zygocyrtida have\r\ndescended from the Acanthodesmida (our #Stephoidea#) and are the ancestors\r\nof all other Cyrtida. The best part of this valuable paper of Bütschli is\r\nhis exact description of the sagittal ring and its apophyses, producing the\r\nbasal plate; and the general conception thus derived of the essential parts\r\nof the skeleton in all MONOPYLEA, bearing a sagittal ring. But his general\r\nconclusions were partly erroneous, since the fossil #Spyroidea# and\r\n#Cyrtoidea# of Barbados, upon which they were founded, contain only the\r\nminority of genera of the large group; and many important and typical forms\r\nremained unknown to him.\r\n\r\nThe numerous new genera discovered in the rich collection of the\r\nChallenger, and mainly in the wonderful Radiolarian ooze of the Central\r\nPacific (Stations 263 to 274) throw a new light upon the complicated\r\naffinities of the whole group, and manifest a far greater richness in\r\ndevelopmental variations and admirable morphological productions than\r\nBütschli could suppose. The following description, however, must remain\r\nvery incomplete, since the exact and thorough study of all individual\r\nforms, in the same manner as {1017}Bütschli had done in the case of a small\r\nnumber of species, would require several years. I can therefore only give\r\nthe basis of further researches.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of #Spyroidea# the three essential elements of the\r\nNassellarian skeleton are easily recognisable, viz.:--A, the vertical\r\nsagittal ring of the #Stephoidea#; B, the basal tripod of the #Plectoidea#,\r\nand C, the latticed cephalis of the #Cyrtellaria#. These three elements are\r\nconstantly so combined that the primary sagittal ring bisects the cavity of\r\nthe lattice-shell and produces an external, longitudinal, more or less\r\ndistinct constriction, separating the lateral inflated halves of the\r\nbilocular cephalis; while the three divergent feet of the basal tripod\r\ndescend from the cortinar or basal plate of the cephalis. The number of the\r\nfeet is often augmented; they are rarely wanting (probably reduced). The\r\nsagittal ring is constantly present, though its relation to the shell-wall\r\nexhibits many modifications. The bilocular form of the fenestrated\r\ncephalis, with its sagittal constriction, is characteristic of all true\r\n#Spyroidea#, and separates them from the #Botryodea# (with multilobate\r\ncephalis) on the one hand, and from the #Cyrtoidea# (with simple cephalis)\r\non the other. There are, however, some intermediate forms between these\r\nthree suborders of #Cyrtellaria#, which show a direct transition to one\r\nanother. Almost constantly the length of the three dimensive axes in the\r\ncephalis of the #Spyroidea# is so different that the lateral or frontal\r\naxis is the longest, the sagittal or dorso-ventral axis the shortest, and\r\nthe principal or longitudinal axis intermediate between them. As in all\r\ndipleuric or bilaterally symmetrical forms, the two poles of the frontal\r\naxis are equal, whilst the two poles of the sagittal and of the principal\r\naxis are more or less different. In only a few forms of #Spyroidea# these\r\ndifferences are difficult to make out; usually the dorsal side is\r\ndistinctly different from the ventral, and the apical side from the basal.\r\nA perfect knowledge of the dipleuric shell requires therefore accurate\r\nobservation from all six sides.\r\n\r\nThe suborder of #Spyroidea# is here divided into four different families.\r\nIn the first and original family, the Zygospyrida, the shell is represented\r\nby the bilocular cephalis only. The second family, Tholospyrida, is\r\ndistinguished by a fenestrated cupola or galea, a hemispherical or conical\r\ndome, arising from the upper or coryphal face of the cephalis. In the third\r\nfamily, Phormospyrida, a thorax is developed, or a fenestrated basal\r\nchamber, arising from the lower or basal face of the cephalis. The fourth\r\nfamily, Androspyrida, combines the characters of the second and the third\r\nfamily, a galea arising from the upper and a thorax from the lower face of\r\nthe cephalis.\r\n\r\nThe bilocular cephalis, as the most important and constant part of the\r\nskeleton in all #Spyroidea#, requires a further general consideration. Its\r\nlattice-work, very variable in the numerous species, is usually more or\r\nless different on the six sides of the nut-shaped shell. Its most important\r\npart is the horizontal basal plate or lower face, and the sagittal ring\r\narising from it in the vertical median plane. This part of the shell\r\ncorresponds exactly to the skeleton of the Semantida, and exhibits the same\r\nmodifications {1018}as in that family; it is therefore probable that the\r\nmajority of the #Spyroidea# (if not the whole group) have been derived\r\ndirectly from the Semantida by further development of network from the\r\nfenestrated ring of _Clathrocircus_. Whilst in this latter Semantid the two\r\nlateral sides of the central capsule remain naked, in the #Spyroidea# they\r\nbecome enclosed and covered by lattice-work, which arises on the right and\r\nleft from the ring. In some forms, however, as in the _Ceratospyris\r\nacuminata_ of Hertwig, and in my Perispyrida, the frontal ring also of the\r\nCoronida and the mitral ring of the Tympanida appear as the initial parts\r\nof a complete latticed cephalis.\r\n\r\nThe basal plate of the cephalis, or the \"cortinar plate,\" the\r\n\"Basal-Scheibe\" of Bütschli, has constantly, according to this author, two\r\npairs of pores, an anterior smaller pair of jugular pores (the pores I of\r\nBütschli) and a posterior larger pair of cardinal pores (the pores II in\r\nhis description) (compare Pl. 95, figs. 3, 6). This applies to the majority\r\nof #Spyroidea#, but by no means to the whole group. We find basal plates\r\nwith two pores only (Pl. 95, fig. 1), with three pores (figs. 2, 5), with\r\nsix pores (figs. 4, 7), with nine pores (Pl. 87, fig. 2), &c. The forms\r\nwith two basal pores may be derived directly from _Semantis_ (Pl. 92, figs.\r\n1, 2); the common forms with four pores from _Semantrum_ (figs. 3-5); the\r\nrarer forms with six pores from _Semantidium_ (figs. 6, 7); and the forms\r\nwith three pores from _Cortiniscus_, &c. In this as well as in other\r\nrespects the variety of different forms and of developmental variations is\r\nfar greater than Bütschli (1882, _loc. cit._) supposed. The bars between\r\nthe pores of the basal plate possess the same value and the same names as\r\nin the Semantida (compare above, p. 954).\r\n\r\nThe coryphal plate of the cephalis, its upper or apical lattice-plate, does\r\nnot exhibit such important differences as the opposite basal plate, is far\r\nless variable, and is usually pierced by numerous, smaller pores. Some\r\nlarger pores lie, often in pairs, on the right and left side of the\r\nsagittal constriction, and have in some groups a regular form and\r\ndisposition. Either in the middle of the coryphal plate, or (usually)\r\nnearer to its dorsal margin, there arises in majority of #Spyroidea# an\r\napical horn, directed either vertically or more or less obliquely\r\nbackwards. In many #Spyroidea# three horns are developed in the coryphal\r\nplate, the odd middle apical horn and two paired frontal or lateral horns\r\narising on each side of the latter and directed more forwards (Pl. 84,\r\nfigs. 9-12). Sometimes the apical horn disappears, while the two frontal\r\nhorns remain (Pl. 95, fig. 12).\r\n\r\nThe anterior or ventral plate of the cephalis (the \"Hinterseite\" of\r\nBütschli), and the posterior or dorsal side (the \"Vorderseite\" of that\r\nauthor), exhibit in the majority of #Spyroidea# more or less marked\r\ndifferences in the number, form, and disposition of their pores, which\r\nrequire a far more accurate description than is here possible. Usually the\r\nsagittal constriction of these two plates, produced by the primary vertical\r\nring, is deeper and sharper in the middle of the ventral than in that of\r\nthe dorsal plate. On both sides of the ring there appear in each plate\r\nusually two or three pairs of larger pores, whilst numerous smaller pores\r\nare situated towards the lateral sides. We may {1019}distinguish the large\r\npores of the ventral plate as facial pores (upper orbital, middle nasal,\r\nand lower maxillary pores), and the opposite large pores of the dorsal\r\nplate as occipital pores (upper epoccipital, middle mesoccipital, and lower\r\nsuboccipital pores). A closer comparison of these pores, and of the\r\nseparating bars in the numerous #Spyroidea#, may show a regularity of\r\ndevelopment similar to that offered by the homologies of the parts in the\r\nskeleton of the Echinodermata, or of the bones in the skull of the\r\nVertebrata.\r\n\r\nThe two convex lateral plates of the cephalis, or the right and left sides,\r\nboth symmetrically equal, do not exhibit the same regularity in the shape,\r\nnumber, and disposition of the pores that the four other sides do. Usually\r\ntheir pores are much smaller and more numerous. In very few forms only a\r\ndistinct frontal ring is visible (corresponding to that of the Coronida),\r\nand in this case the lateral pores are sometimes disposed symmetrically on\r\nboth sides of this ring. These #Spyroidea# may have arisen directly from\r\ncorresponding forms of Coronida.\r\n\r\nThe sagittal ring (or the primary vertical ring) inherited from the\r\nStephanida and Semantida, shows in the #Spyroidea# great variety in its\r\nform and in its relation to the cephalis. These variations are far greater\r\nthan Bütschli (1882, _loc. cit._) supposed. We may distinguish the\r\nfollowing six principal cases:--A. The ring lies completely in the wall of\r\nthe cephalis, and causes a deep sagittal constriction in it. In this case\r\nthe lower part or basal segment of the ring separates the basal pores into\r\npairs; its anterior part or ventral rod the facial pores; its upper part or\r\ncoryphal rod the apical pores; and its posterior part or dorsal rod the\r\noccipital pores. No part of the ring is free in the shell-cavity. B. The\r\ngreater part of the ring lies enclosed in the shell-wall; only its dorsal\r\nrod arises free in the shell-cavity and ascends vertically or obliquely to\r\nthe apex, where it is usually prolonged into the apical horn. This seems to\r\nbe the most common case. C. The coryphal and the basal part of the ring lie\r\nenclosed in the shell-wall, with its dorsal and ventral rod free in the\r\nshell-cavity; the dorsal rod ascends vertically to the apex, the ventral\r\nrod obliquely upwards to the upper part of the facial plate (the nasal or\r\norbital region). This case, regarded by Bütschli as the usual one, is far\r\nless common than he supposed. D. The greater part of the ring lies free in\r\nthe shell-cavity, its basal rod only is enclosed in the shell-wall, and\r\nseparates the right from the left group of the cortinar pores. This case\r\nseems to be rarer than the preceding. E. The whole ring lies free in the\r\nshell-cavity, and is connected with the sagittal constriction of the\r\nshell-wall by numerous short radial beams. The distance of the shell-wall\r\nfrom the enclosed ring is usually least on the basal rod, and greatest on\r\nthe dorsal rod. F. The whole ring lies free in the shell-cavity (as in the\r\npreceding case), and is connected by numerous short radial beams with a\r\nsecondary larger, concentric sagittal ring, which is developed in the\r\nlongitudinal constriction of the shell-wall.\r\n\r\n{1020}Comparing these six principal cases, in respect of the relation of\r\nthe primary sagittal ring to the cephalis of the #Spyroidea#, we may\r\nsuppose that they represent together a continuous phylogenetical series of\r\nwhich the first (A) is the original, and the last (F) the latest case; and\r\nthat the true cause of the various changes is a successive separation of\r\nthe ring, which becomes more and more free and independent from the\r\nlattice-plate of the cephalis. Since the intimate study of the structure of\r\nthe cephalis in many #Spyroidea# is very difficult, it requires further\r\naccurate observations (from all six sides of the shell). There are also\r\nsome other more difficult complications of its structure, which cannot be\r\nsolved without exact study and extended comparison.\r\n\r\nOf peculiar importance for the differentiation of the numerous genera of\r\nthe #Spyroidea# are the basal feet or the descending and diverging\r\napophyses, which are developed from the base of their cephalis. In general\r\nthey exhibit the same typical shape which we find in the #Plectellaria# as\r\nwell as in the #Cyrtoidea#, and which we regard therefore as an important\r\ncommon character of the majority of NASSELLARIA. We may therefore\r\ndistinguish here also the three primary, and the other ones as secondary\r\nfeet. The three primary feet, or the \"cortinar feet,\" are the same that we\r\nfound in the Plagonida and Plectanida, in _Cortina_ and _Cortiniscus_ among\r\nthe #Stephoidea#, and in the majority of #Cyrtoidea#. They also reappear in\r\nthe same characteristic disposition and connection with the basal plate of\r\nthe cephalis, in the majority of #Spyroidea#. The odd caudal foot (_c_) is\r\nthe lower prolongation of the dorsal rod of the sagittal ring, which is\r\nprolonged upwards into the apical horn. The two paired pectoral feet,\r\nhowever (_p'_, _p''_), are the descending prolongations of the coracal rods\r\n(_e_) which separate the jugular pores (_i_) from the cardinal pores (_k_)\r\nof the cortinar plate (compare Pl. 95, figs. 2-6).\r\n\r\nThe three cortinar feet are nearly equally developed in the majority of\r\n#Spyroidea# (compare Pls. 84, 89). But often the odd caudal foot exhibits a\r\ndifferent shape from that of the two paired pectoral feet, and in many\r\ngenera of the group it becomes more or less rudimentary. It has quite\r\ndisappeared in the subfamily Dipospyrida (Pl. 85); here the two pectoral\r\nfeet only are developed (often excessively), and are usually opposite in\r\nthe frontal plane. Such dipodal forms, very common in the #Spyroidea#, are\r\nnever found in the #Cyrtoidea#.\r\n\r\nThe secondary feet, which we contrast with the three primary feet as later\r\nproductions, exhibit great variations in number and development. Very\r\nfrequently three interradial secondary feet become developed, alternating\r\nwith the three primary cortinar or perradial feet, and opposed to them in\r\npairs (Pl. 95, figs. 7, 8). In these hexapodal #Spyroidea# (or Hexaspyrida)\r\nan odd anterior or sternal foot (_z_) is opposite to the odd caudal foot,\r\nand two paired posterior or tergal feet (_t'_, _t''_) to the two pectoral\r\nfeet. When the sternal foot becomes rudimentary or lost, pentapodal forms\r\narise (Pentaspyrida, Pl. 95, figs. 9-11), and when the two odd feet (caudal\r\nand sternal) disappear, tetrapodal forms arise with two pairs of feet\r\n(Therospyrida, Pl. 89, figs. 5, 6). The latter differ from {1021}those\r\nquadrupedal forms in which two opposite sagittal feet (the caudal and\r\nsternal) alternate in the form of a cross with two paired lateral or\r\npectoral feet (Tetraspyrida, Pl. 53, figs. 19, 20). In many #Spyroidea# the\r\nnumber of basal feet is greatly increased, and they form a regular radial\r\ncorona around the basal plate, like a circle of tentacles (Polyspyrida, Pl.\r\n87). In this latter case the feet are usually flat and lamellar, whilst in\r\nthe other groups they exhibit a very variable form, as is seen in Pls.\r\n83-89.\r\n\r\nThe _Central Capsule_ of the #Spyroidea# has been accurately observed in\r\nonly a few genera, and requires a further exact examination regarding the\r\ndifferent modifications which occur in their different families. It is very\r\nprobable that these will agree with the well known modifications in the\r\ncorresponding groups of #Cyrtoidea#. The characteristic Monopylean\r\nstructure of the capsule (with porochora and podoconus) was first described\r\nby Richard Hertwig in his _Ceratospyris acuminata_ (_loc. cit._, p. 72,\r\ntaf. vii. fig. 2). I found the same afterwards in many other forms. In the\r\nZygospyrida and Tholospyrida the central capsule seems to be usually\r\nbilobate (bisected by the sagittal ring), and enclosed in the two chambers\r\nof the cephalis. The two lobes of the capsule (right and left) are equal\r\nand connected by a smaller middle part, which contains the transverse\r\nelliptical nucleus and is enclosed by the sagittal ring; often each lobe\r\ncontains a large oil-globule. In some forms, however, three or four lobes\r\n(sometimes perhaps more) are developed, which pierce the cortinar pores of\r\nthe basal plate and depend freely between the basal feet (Pl. 53, fig. 19).\r\nIn the Phormospyrida and Androspyrida the formation of such basal lobes\r\nseems to be more frequent; they are here enclosed by the thorax. Usually\r\neach lobe contains a large oil-globule. In _Nephrospyris_ (Pl. 90) and in\r\nsome similar genera the central capsule is violin-shaped, deeply bisected\r\nby the sagittal ring; in each of the two lobes a series of oil-vesicles is\r\ndeveloped at both poles of the transverse axis (figs. 7, 10); the nucleus,\r\na transverse cylindrical body, is placed in the latter. In the periphery of\r\nthe voluminous calymma of this singular genus a large number of globular\r\ncells are developed (figs. 7, 10), probably symbiotic xanthellæ. In some\r\nforms of _Nephrospyris_ these xanthellæ are enclosed by a peculiar inflated\r\ngirdle, developed in the periphery of the kidney-shaped skeleton (Pl. 90,\r\nfigs. 1, 4-6).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Families of_ #Spyroidea#.\r\n\r\n                                  {Cephalis without galea\r\n  Shell without thorax; no second { (or apical cupola),   1.

(Pls. 84-87).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Spyroidea# without galea and thorax; the shell consisting\r\nof the bilocular cephalis only and its apophyses.\r\n\r\nThe family Zygospyrida is by far the richest among the four families of\r\n#Spyroidea#, the number of genera in the whole suborder amounting to\r\nforty-five, in the former to twenty-eight; and the number of species in the\r\nlatter to two hundred and thirty-seven, in the former to one hundred and\r\nseventy-two. The number of individuals also found in many species of\r\nZygospyrida is far greater than in any species of the three other families.\r\nThe shell of the Zygospyrida is represented by the bilocular cephalis only,\r\nand never develops a galea (as in the Tholospyrida) nor a thorax (as in the\r\nPhormospyrida and Androspyrida). The three latter families have therefore\r\nbeen derived from the former as their common ancestral group.\r\n\r\nThe Zygospyrida are very similar and nearly related to the Monocyrtida, and\r\nin both groups the cephalis alone represents the whole shell. Therefore in\r\n1882, Bütschli, in the paper mentioned above (p. 1016), maintained the\r\nopinion, that these two groups were identical. But there is this important\r\ndifference between them, that in the Zygospyrida (as in all #Spyroidea#)\r\nthe cephalis is bilocular, with a sagittal constriction, separating the\r\nright and left chambers. In the Monocyrtida, however (as in all\r\n#Cyrtoidea#), the cephalis is unilocular, forming a quite simple chamber\r\nwithout sagittal constriction. Correspondingly the primary sagittal ring in\r\nall Zygospyrida is well preserved and usually complete, while in the\r\nMonocyrtida it is never complete, and often quite absent. Another\r\ndifference is indicated by the form of the central capsule, which in the\r\nZygospyrida is usually bilobed, and more developed in the frontal axis,\r\nwhilst in the Monocyrtida it is commonly ovate, and more developed in the\r\nprincipal axis.\r\n\r\nThe important questions of the origin and phylogenetical relation of these\r\ntwo similar groups of NASSELLARIA form a very complicated and difficult\r\nproblem, and we do not at present possess the means of solving it. It may\r\nbe that a part of the Monocyrtida has been derived from the Zygospyrida (as\r\nBütschli erroneously supposes for all), but the contrary is also possible.\r\nA third possibility is the independent origin of both groups from the\r\nSemantida. But we shall see afterwards, in the description of the\r\nMonocyrtida, that a great part of this group may with greater probability\r\nbe derived from the #Plectoidea# than from the #Stephoidea#, and that\r\nanother part of them has probably been derived quite independently from the\r\nNassellida. Regarding the complicated relations of these similar groups,\r\nmentioned above (pp. 892-894), it seems hopeless here to discuss further\r\ntheir difficult affinities; but in any case it seems useful or even\r\nnecessary to separate the Monocyrtida from the Zygospyrida.\r\n\r\n{1023}The cephalis of the Zygospyrida possesses all the characteristic\r\nfeatures which we have described above as belonging to the #Spyroidea# in\r\ngeneral (p. 1017), and a survey of the Pls. 84-87 exhibits the most\r\nimportant modifications of its shape (compare also Pl. 95, figs. 1-13).\r\nTherefore we may avoid useless repetitions by referring to the description\r\ngiven above. We will only point out that the bilocular character of the\r\ncephalis (in opposition to the simple cephalis of the Monocyrtida) in the\r\nmajority of Zygospyrida is apparent on the first view, and that it is\r\nalways demonstrated by an accurate examination of the sagittal ring and its\r\nrelation to the longitudinal constriction of the cephalis (compare p.\r\n1019). The basal plate or cortinar plate exhibits usually four typical\r\npores (two smaller jugular, _i_, and two larger cardinal, _k_), but this is\r\nby no means a general rule, as Bütschli thought; moreover, instead of four\r\ncortinar pores, there are frequently found three or six or some other\r\nnumbers (compare above, p. 1018).\r\n\r\nThe top of the cephalis in the majority of Zygospyrida bears an apical\r\nhorn, as an upper prolongation of the dorsal rod of the sagittal ring; it\r\nis often of unusual size and shape (Pl. 85, figs. 5-11; Pl. 95, fig. 8,\r\n&c.). In several genera two lateral or frontal horns are developed on both\r\nsides of the former (Pl. 84, figs. 9-12; Pl. 86, figs. 5-13). Sometimes\r\nthese two alone are present, while the original apical horn is lost by\r\nreduction (Pl. 95, fig. 12). In other genera the apical face bears no\r\nhorns; probably they are lost by reduction.\r\n\r\nThe greatest variety of forms is produced in the Zygospyrida by the\r\ndifferent number, disposition, and shape of the feet, or the basal\r\napophyses arising from the base of the cephalis. Regarding these remarkable\r\ndifferences, we may distinguish eight subfamilies. The common ancestral\r\ngroup of all are probably the Tripospyrida, which possess the three typical\r\nbasal feet of _Cortina_ and _Cortiniscus_, an odd caudal and two paired\r\npectoral feet (Pl. 84). From these may be derived the Dipospyrida (Pl. 85)\r\nby loss of the caudal foot, the Tetraspyrida by development of an odd\r\nsternal foot (Pl. 53, figs. 7, 8, 19), and the Hexaspyrida by development\r\nof three secondary interradial between the three primary perradial feet.\r\nThe Pentaspyrida may have been derived from the latter by loss of the\r\nsternal foot (Pl. 95, figs. 9-11), and the Therospyrida by loss of the two\r\nsagittal feet (Pl. 89, figs. 5, 6). The Polyspyrida bear numerous (seven to\r\ntwelve or more, often twenty to thirty) basal feet, forming a corona around\r\nthe cortinar plate (Pl. 87); they may have been derived from the\r\nTripospyrida or Hexaspyrida by further multiplication of the feet. Finally,\r\nthe Circospyrida exhibit no feet at all (Pl. 89, figs. 7-12); they may be\r\nderived either from one of the preceding groups by complete reduction and\r\nloss of the basal apophyses, or directly from those Semantida which have no\r\nfeet (_Semantis_, _Semantrum_, _Clathrocircus_, &c.).\r\n\r\n{1024}_Synopsis of the Genera of Zygospyrida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

TRIPOSPYRIDA, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 441.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Zygospyrida# tripoda, with three descending basal feet (the\r\nsame as in _Cortina_, an odd posterior or caudal foot and two paired\r\nanterior or pectoral feet).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 441. _Tripospyris_,[59] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 441.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Zygospyrida# with three basal feet and one apical horn.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Tripospyris_ (Pl. 84, figs. 1-7) is in the large group of\r\n#Spyroidea# probably the most original and typical form, from which, as a\r\ncommon ancestral form, all other genera of this polymorphous suborder may\r\nbe derived. The shell is usually shaped like a nut or thorax, and exhibits\r\ntwo paired lateral chambers, which are separated by a distinct sagittal\r\nring and a slighter or deeper sagittal constriction. The dorsal rod of the\r\nring is prolonged at the upper pole into an ascending apical horn, at the\r\nlower pole into a descending caudal foot, whilst two paired pectoral or\r\nlateral feet arise from the anterior pole of the basal rod. These three\r\ndivergent basal feet and the apical horn are the same four typical radial\r\nspines which we have encountered already in _Plagoniscus_ (Plagonida), in\r\n_Plectaniscus_ (Plectanida), in _Cortina_ (Stephanida), and in\r\n_Cortiniscus_ (Semantida). Compare above, p. 891. From all these\r\n#Plectellaria#, _Tripospyris_ differs in the development of a complete\r\nbilocular lattice-shell, having the characters of the true #Spyroidea#. The\r\nnumerous species of this genus may be placed in different subgenera,\r\naccording to the different number of collar pores or cortinar pores in the\r\nbasal plate (two, three, four, six, or more). These differences are very\r\nimportant, however difficult to make out; the following system therefore is\r\na provisional one, and requires further accurate observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Tripospyrantha_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Basal plate with two large pores only (the primary jugular\r\npores of _Semantis_).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Tripospyris cortina_, n. sp.

The topographical relation of the two\r\nlateral feet to the rods of the collar-plate, and to the cortinar pores\r\nseparated by these, leaves no doubt that they correspond to the pectoral\r\nfeet of _Cortina_ and _Tripospyris_, and therefore that the Dipospyrida\r\nhave originated from the Tripospyrida by loss of the caudal foot.\r\n_Dipospyris_ is the simplest form of the Dipospyrida, with two simple free\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Dipospyris bipes_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell thorax-shaped, smooth, with deep sagittal stricture, two vaulted\r\nbosoms, and subregular circular pores.

Berlin, p. 54.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Zygospyrida# with numerous (seven to twelve or more) basal\r\nfeet and one apical horn.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Petalospyris_ and the following three genera form together the\r\npeculiar subfamily of Polyspyrida, differing from the other Zygospyrida in\r\nthe multiplication of the radial feet, which descend from the basal face of\r\nthe shell; they may therefore be also called \"Zygospyrida multiradiata,\"\r\nand bear the closest relationship to the Archiphænida (or the \"Monocyrtida\r\nmultiradiata\"). They differ, however, from the latter in the presence of\r\nthe distinct sagittal stricture, characteristic of all #Spyroidea#. The\r\nnumber of the basal feet, which form a coronet around the margin of the\r\nbasal plate, is commonly between twelve and sixteen, but often more. Their\r\nform is usually flat, lamellar, but often also more or less cylindrical or\r\nconical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1060}Subgenus 1. _Petalospyrantha_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Basal plate with two large collar pores only, separated by\r\nthe base of the primary ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Petalospyris foveolata_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Petalospyris foveolata_, Ehrenberg, 1854, Mikrogeol., Taf. xxxvi. fig.\r\n  14; Abhandl. d. k.

They have probably arisen from the Tripospyrida (_Tripospyris_) by\r\nreduction and loss of the feet (in the same way as the eradiate #Cyrtoidea#\r\nfrom the triradiate). But it is also possible that many of the Circospyrida\r\n(if not all) are derived directly from the Semantida (_Clathrocircus_) by\r\nthe closing of the two lateral openings and by completing the framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Circospyris nucula_, n. sp.

In the former case the total absence of coryphal horns and basal feet\r\nis primary, in the latter case secondary, effected by phylogenetic\r\nreduction and loss. But it is also possible that in one part of the\r\nnumerous species of this genus the former case, and in another the latter\r\ntakes place, and that one part of _Dictyospyris_ may be directly developed\r\nfrom the Semantida or Coronida (the lattice shell becoming complete),\r\nanother part arising from the Tripospyrida or Dipospyrida (the horns and\r\nfeet becoming lost).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Dictyospyrantha_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Basal plate with two large pores only (the primary jugular\r\npores of _Semantis_).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Dictyospyris distoma_, n. sp.

Fourteen new species have been found in the collection of\r\nthe Challenger, which we dispose here among five genera. These may be\r\nderived from corresponding genera of Zygospyrida by the development of a\r\ngalea.\r\n\r\n{1078}The number and disposition of the terminal feet around the basal\r\nplate do not vary so much in the Tholospyrida as in the Zygospyrida. We\r\nfind here only one genus with three feet, _Tholospyris_ (corresponding to\r\n_Tripospyris_); one genus with two lateral feet, _Lophospyris_\r\n(corresponding to _Dipospyris_); and two genera with numerous feet, the\r\nhorned _Sepalospyris_ and the hornless _Tiarospyris_ (the former\r\ncorresponding to _Petalospyris_, the latter to _Gorgospyris_). The fifth\r\ngenus (_Pylospyris_) has no feet at all, and may be derived from\r\n_Circospyris_ among the Zygospyrida.\r\n\r\nThe cephalis exhibits in the Tholospyrida the same typical structure which\r\nwe have described above of all #Spyroidea# (compare p. 1017). The cupola or\r\ngalea, arising from its upper face, seems to be a secondary production,\r\nperhaps caused by an apical growth of the central capsule, or in other\r\ncases by descending branches of the apical horn, which cover the apical\r\nface of the calymma with protecting network.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Tholospyrida._\r\n\r\n                              {Three basal feet (two\r\n  I.

It corresponds,\r\ntherefore, to the Dicyrtida among the #Cyrtoidea#, and may perhaps be,\r\nwholly or partially, the ancestral group of the latter. When the sagittal\r\nring and the longitudinal constriction of the cephalis disappear, the\r\nPhormospyrida pass over into the Dicyrtida.\r\n\r\nOnly three species of this family have been hitherto known, which were\r\nfound fossil in Barbados, and described by Ehrenberg (1875) as _Lithobotrys\r\nstiligera_ and _Petalospyris confluens_, and by Bütschli (1882) as\r\n_Petalospyris anthocyrtoides_. Fifteen other species are found in the\r\nChallenger collection, which we dispose here among five genera.\r\n\r\nTwo of these five genera (the horned _Acrospyris_ and the hornless\r\n_Phormospyris_) possess the three typical basal feet of _Cortina_ and\r\n_Tripospyris_, and may be derived from these genera by the development of\r\nnetwork between the bases of the feet. The three other genera possess\r\nnumerous feet, and may be derived in the same way from the Polyspyrida; the\r\napical face differs in the three genera, in _Desmospyris_ it is hornless,\r\nin _Patagospyris_ it bears an apical horn, and in Rhodospyris three horns\r\n(an apical and two lateral or frontal).\r\n\r\nThe cephalis in the Phormospyrida exhibits the same typical structure,\r\nwhich we have described above, of all #Spyroidea# (compare, p. 1017). The\r\nthorax or the second joint of the shell arises by reticular connection of\r\nthe bases of the basal feet, and represents a cylindrical or\r\ntruncate-conical joint in the polypodal forms, or a three-sided joint in\r\nthe tripodal forms.

It has\r\nbeen derived from _Tripospyris_ by the development of lattice-work between\r\nthe three basal feet, forming a second joint or thorax. It has also\r\ntherefore a close relation to the simplest forms of the triradiate\r\nDicyrtida: _Dictyophimus_, _Clathrocanium_, &c. It differs from these in\r\nthe distinct sagittal constriction of the cephalis, which divides it into\r\ntwo lateral loculi.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Acrospyris clathrocanium_, n. sp. (Pl. 95, fig. 17).\r\n\r\nShell tuberculate, with distinct collar and deep sagittal stricture.\r\nCephalis nut-shaped, with numerous irregular, roundish pores; three pairs\r\nof larger annular pores on each side of the ring. Basal plate with four\r\nlarger pores (two major cardinal and two minor jugular pores). Apical horn\r\nslender, pyramidal, curved, about as long as the shell, with three recurved\r\nshort spines. Thorax three-sided, about twice as large as the cephalis,\r\nwith three large basal holes and a broad riband with numerous smaller\r\nholes; three ribs between them stout, pyramidal, strongly curved, prolonged\r\ninto three convergent crescentic feet.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.08 long, 0.11 broad; thorax 0.14 long, 0.16\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Acrospyris dictyophimus_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell smooth. Cephalis and thorax of nearly the same structure and form as\r\nin the preceding species; it differs from the latter in the shape of the\r\nthree stout basal feet, which are {1086}straight, much longer than the\r\nthorax, divergent, and at the broader base irregularly fenestrated, without\r\nthree larger holes.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.05 long, 0.08 broad; thorax 0.07 long, 0.12\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 241, depth 2300 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Acrospyris pyramidalis_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell three-sided pyramidal, with slight collar stricture.

Pores irregular, roundish.

(Pl. 88-90).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Spyroidea# with galea and thorax; the shell composed of a\r\nbilocular cephalis and of two secondary joints, a galea arising from its\r\nupper face, and a thorax arising from its lower face.\r\n\r\n{1091}The family #Androspyrida# differs from the three preceding families\r\nof #Spyroidea# in the three-jointed shell, in which the galea of the\r\nTholospyrida and the thorax of the Phormospyrida are combined; it may\r\ntherefore be derived from the latter by development of a galea, or from the\r\nformer by formation of a thorax. The common ancestral group of these three\r\nfamilies is probably the Zygospyrida. But it may be that a part of the\r\nAndrospyrida has originated directly from the #Stephoidea#.\r\n\r\nTwo species only of this family were hitherto known, _Amphispyris\r\nreticulata_ (figured, in 1872, by Ehrenberg, as _Dictyospyris_) and\r\n_Sphærospyris sphæra_ (described, in 1882, by Bütschli, as _Dictyospyris_).\r\nThirty new species were found in the collection of the Challenger, and are\r\nhere disposed in seven genera. But perhaps these may represent three\r\ndifferent families, which we here enumerate as subfamilies; the\r\nLamprospyrida, Perispyrida, and Nephrospyrida.\r\n\r\nThe Lamprospyrida, the first subfamily, are tripodal #Spyroidea# with galea\r\nand thorax; they may therefore be regarded as a combination of\r\n_Tholospyris_ and _Acrospyris_. In the simpler form, _Androspyris_ (Pl. 83,\r\nfig. 8), the network of the shell is simple, and allows a very clear\r\nrecognition of the internal structure. In the splendid _Lamprospyris_,\r\nderived from it (Pl. 89, figs. 13, 14) the delicate network is more or less\r\nspongy. The large apical horn is branched and fenestrated in the latter and\r\nsimple in the former.\r\n\r\nThe Perispyrida, the second subfamily, possess no free apophyses, but a\r\nthree-jointed shell with two distinct transverse strictures, an upper\r\nmitral and a lower collar stricture. The network of this shell is\r\nincomplete in _Amphispyris_ (Pl. 88, figs. 2-7), being developed only in\r\nthe frontal or lateral perimeter, thus making it probable that this\r\nsubfamily may have arisen directly from the Tympanida (_Toxarium_, Pl. 88,\r\nfig. 1; Pl. 93, figs. 18-20). The network of _Tricolospyris_ (Pl. 88, figs.\r\n8-11) is complete, of another shape in the cephalis than in the galea and\r\nthorax; it is doubled or spongy in _Perispyris_ (Pl. 88, figs. 12, 13).\r\n\r\nThe Nephrospyrida, the third subfamily, contains two very different genera\r\nonly, each of which may represent a separate family. _Sphærospyris_ (Pl.\r\n83, fig. 4) possesses a spherical or subspherical lattice-shell, the\r\ncentral part of which includes a sagittal ring, connected with the inner\r\nface of the sphere by a number of paired apophyses, corresponding to those\r\nof _Lithocircus_; it may be easily confounded with some #Sphæroidea#\r\n(_Carposphæra_), but the enclosed ring leaves no doubt as to its true\r\norigin. _Nephrospyris_ (Pl. 90) has a flat discoidal shell of considerable\r\nsize, usually kidney-shaped or cordate, with a deep sagittal incision at\r\nthe base, indicating the region where the pseudopodia are protruded from\r\nthe porochora. The violin-shaped central capsule has two large lateral\r\nlobes on each side of the including sagittal ring, and the transverse\r\nnucleus is perpendicular to its sagittal plane (Pl. 90, figs. 7, 10).\r\n_Sphærocircus_ as well as _Nephrospyris_ have probably arisen independently\r\nfrom the Stephanida.\r\n\r\n{1092}_Synopsis of the Genera of Androspyrida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

This characteristic shape is found neither in the #Spyroidea# (with\r\nbilocular cephalis) nor in the #Cyrtoidea# (with simple cephalis). The\r\naffinities of the former group to the two latter form a very complicated\r\nproblem, which is not yet solved; the morphology of the #Botryodea# is the\r\nmost difficult part in the system of NASSELLARIA, and what we can here\r\ngive, are incomplete and unsatisfactory beginnings only.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1860 only a single genus of the #Botryodea# was known,\r\n_Lithobotrys_, one of the oldest genera of \"_Polycystina_,\" and described\r\nby Ehrenberg in 1844 (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p.\r\n74). He gave the following definition:--\"Loricæ siliceæ articuli in adulto\r\nnon in seriem, sed in uvæ brevis formam, id est in loculos plus minus\r\ndiscretos nonnullos contiguos dispositi. Proxime ad Lithocampem accedit.\"\r\nIn his first System (1847) _Lithobotrys_ is placed with _Lithocampe_ among\r\nhis family Lithochytrina. Afterwards (1860) Ehrenberg added two new genera,\r\nunder the names _Botryocampe_ and _Botryocyrtis_ and figured some species\r\nof these incompletely in his last works (1872, 1875).\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph I founded for these three genera the separate subfamily of\r\nPolycyrtida, added as a fourth genus _Spyridobotrys_, and gave to the group\r\nthe following definition (1862, loc. cit., p. 341):--\"Lattice-shell divided\r\nby two or more annular strictures, partly longitudinally, partly\r\ntransversely, into three or more unequal chambers, which are placed in\r\ndifferent planes and have a different relation to the poles of the\r\nshell-axis.\"\r\n\r\nThe new and remarkable forms of #Botryodea#, which I subsequently found in\r\nthe Challenger collection, demonstrated that the #Botryodea# differ from\r\nthe other #Cyrtellaria# (the #Cyrtoidea# as well as the #Spyroidea#) in a\r\nfar higher degree than I formerly had supposed. A synopsis of the figures\r\nin Pl. 96 will give sufficient evidence of this view. Therefore in my\r\nProdromus (1881, p. 439) {1104}I completely separated the #Botryodea# (or\r\nBotrida) from the other suborders of #Cyrtellaria# (Spyrida and Cyrtida).\r\n\r\nBütschli gave, in 1882, in his paper on the Cyrtida (_loc. cit._) a very\r\naccurate description of _Lithobotrys geminata_, and pointed out its close\r\naffinity to _Lithocorythium_ and _Lithomelissa_, and the importance of an\r\noblique septum separating the cephalis into a smaller anterior and a larger\r\nposterior lobe. His views on the #Botryodea# (as a subordinate group of the\r\n#Cyrtoidea#) are however incomplete, since the peculiar forms, described in\r\nthe following pages, were unknown to him.\r\n\r\nAccording to the wide morphological divergence of the different\r\n#Botryodea#, and the numerous peculiar forms developed from it, we here\r\ndivide the whole group into three families and ten genera, with fifty-five\r\nspecies. These form, however, only a small part of the large and varied\r\nmass of closely related forms which are found in the rich collections of\r\nthe Challenger. The great difficulty of researches on their intimate\r\nstructure, and the great amount of time required for it, prevented me from\r\ngiving a more complete and exact description than the one here given. The\r\nobservation of the small shells from all the different sides is a difficult\r\ntask, requiring years of work, and its satisfactory explanation would be\r\npossible only by means of numerous figures.\r\n\r\nThe three families of #Botryodea#, here described, correspond to the three\r\nfirst groups of #Cyrtoidea#. The first family, Cannobotryida, corresponds\r\nto the Monocyrtida clausa and to the Zygospyrida; their shell consists of a\r\ncephalis only, without subsequent joints. The second family, Lithobotryida,\r\ncorresponds to the Dicyrtida and Phormospyrida; their shell is composed of\r\na cephalis and a thorax, both joints being separated by a transverse\r\ncortinar septum and a collar stricture. The third family, Pylobotryida, has\r\na three-jointed shell, like the Tricyrtida, with cephalis, thorax and\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\nThe cephalis is the most characteristic part of the shell of the\r\n#Botryodea# and its lobulate and multilocular shape separates them from the\r\n#Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#. It represents the whole shell in the\r\nCannobotryida, and in the young state of the two other families, which\r\nafterwards develop a thorax (Lithobotryida) and an abdomen (Pylobotryida).\r\nThe typical lobulation of the cephalis is probably originally caused by\r\ninternal septa; and these may be originated by branches of the internal\r\ncolumella, which corresponds either to the central ascending columella of\r\nthe #Plectoidea# or to the excentric ascending dorsal rod of the sagittal\r\nring of the #Stephoidea#. But afterwards, when the original septa disappear\r\nand are lost by reduction, only the external constrictions remain to\r\nindicate the limits of the single lobes.\r\n\r\nAmong the internal septa and the corresponding external constrictions which\r\neffect the lobulation of the cephalis, may be distinguished primary or\r\nconstant septa and secondary or inconstant septa.  As primary septa we\r\nregard firstly an oblique frontal {1105}septum and secondly a vertical\r\nsagittal septum. The frontal septum (described accurately by Bütschli) has\r\nusually two or three pairs of pores and ascends obliquely from the base to\r\nthe anterior face of the cephalis, where it is inserted in the orbital\r\nregion; it divides the cephalis into a smaller anterior or facial lobe and\r\na larger posterior or occipital lobe. The latter is commonly higher and\r\nmore developed than the former and partly covers its upper face, like the\r\ncrest of a helmet. The facial lobe is again bisected by an incomplete\r\nsagittal septum and a corresponding partial constriction on the anterior\r\nface. We find, therefore, in this original cephalis of the #Botryodea#,\r\nthree primary lobes, an odd larger occipital lobe and two paired smaller\r\nfacial lobes. The typical trilobed cephalis may be regarded perhaps as the\r\ncommon original form of the #Botryodea#.\r\n\r\nThe secondary and inconstant constrictions which we find in many\r\n#Botryodea#, and which produce a greater number of lobes in the cephalis,\r\nrequire further accurate observation. The following cases of lobation may\r\nbe considered as the most important:--(1) Cephalis with four lobes,\r\nopposite in two pairs (two larger occipital and two smaller facial lobes,\r\nseparated by a complete sagittal and an oblique frontal constriction); (2)\r\ncephalis with four unequal lobes, two of which are odd and sagittal, two\r\npaired and lateral (the odd occipital lobe usually larger and the odd\r\nmandibular lobe smaller than the two paired lateral or buccal lobes); (3)\r\ncephalis with five lobes (a large odd occipital lobe and two pairs of\r\nsmaller lobes, anterior nasal, and lateral buccal lobes); (4) cephalis with\r\nfive lobes, three of which are odd (a posterior occipital, middle frontal,\r\nand anterior facial lobe), and one pair of lateral lobes; (5) cephalis with\r\nsix lobes, opposite in pairs (two larger occipital, two smaller nasal and\r\ntwo intermediate lateral or buccal lobes); (6) cephalis with six lobes, two\r\nof which are odd and sagittal (a large occipital and a smaller nasal lobe),\r\nfour opposite in pairs (two anterior and two posterior buccal lobes); (7)\r\ncephalis with seven lobes, three of which are odd (a large posterior\r\noccipital, a middle frontal, and an anterior small nasal lobe), four\r\nopposite in two pairs (an anterior buccal and a posterior temporal pair);\r\n(8) cephalis with eight lobes, two of which are odd (a large posterior\r\noccipital and a small anterior frontal lobe) and six opposite in three\r\nlateral pairs; (9) cephalis with nine lobes, three of which are odd (an\r\noccipital, a frontal and a nasal lobe) and six opposite in three lateral\r\npairs; (10) cephalis with ten lobes, two of which are odd (a large\r\noccipital and a smaller frontal lobe) and the other eight opposite in\r\npairs; (11) cephalis with numerous lobes (twelve to fifteen or more) which\r\nare symmetrically disposed on each side of the median plane; (12) cephalis\r\nwith numerous lobes (twelve to fifteen or more) which are irregularly and\r\nsometimes spirally conglomerated.\r\n\r\nAll these different forms of lobation require a far more thorough\r\nexamination than I can devote to them, and may furnish examples of regular\r\nlaws of development. The irregular forms are rather common, and I have\r\nfound some very irregular #Botryodea# {1106}(not here described) in which I\r\ncould not determine the topographical regions of the cephalis. The\r\ndifficulty in the examination of these complicated forms is increased by\r\ntheir very small size, which does not reach the usual dimensions of the\r\nother #Cyrtellaria#. In some cases I was able to observe on the base of the\r\ncephalis the same typical cortinar pores (in two or three pairs), which we\r\nalso find in the same part of the cephalis in the #Spyroidea# and\r\n#Cyrtoidea#, and which are inherited from the Semantida.\r\n\r\nThe thorax of the #Botryodea#, or the second shell-joint, absent in the\r\nCannobotryida, is usually of very simple form, ovate, truncate, conical or\r\ncylindrical, and consists of a secondary joint, developed from the base of\r\nthe cephalis. The thorax is usually small, about the same size as the\r\ncephalis or a little larger, whilst in the #Cyrtoidea# it is commonly much\r\nlarger than the latter. Its terminal mouth is closed by a lattice-plate in\r\nthe Botryocellida, while it remains open in the Botryopylida and\r\nPylobotryida.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen, or the third shell-joint, developed in the Pylobotryida only,\r\ngenerally also exhibits a very simple shape, like the thorax, and it is a\r\ntertiary joint developed from the base of the thorax. It exhibits to the\r\nlatter the same relation as in the Tricyrtida. The terminal mouth of the\r\nabdomen remains open in the Botryocyrtida; it becomes closed by a\r\nlattice-plate in the Botryocampida.\r\n\r\nThe lattice-plate forming the shell of the #Botryodea# is usually very thin\r\nand fragile, with very small circular pores. These are often very numerous,\r\nat other times scarce, and sometimes nearly wanting, so that the shell\r\nappears hyaline. In this group there never occurs that great variety in\r\nform and size of the pores, which numerous #Cyrtoidea# and #Spyroidea#\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\nThe radial apophyses which are found in the majority of #Botryodea# seem to\r\ncorrespond in position and relation to the typical radial beams of the\r\nother NASSELLARIA, viz., three descending basal feet arising from the base\r\nof the cephalis, and an ascending vertical apical horn arising from the top\r\nof the cephalis. Here also they seem to be inherited from the #Plectoidea#\r\nor #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_). But whilst these four typical\r\nradial beams in the other NASSELLARIA are usually simple spines or solid\r\nrods, here they usually appear as hollow cylindrical tubes, the thin wall\r\nof which is pierced by the same small pores as the shell. These porous\r\ntubes are either straight or slightly curved, often inflated and ovate at\r\nthe base. We find in their number and disposition the same variety as in\r\nthe simple radial spines of the other NASSELLARIA. The original number may\r\nhere also be seen in the development of four typical beams, an ascending\r\napical tube on the top of the cephalis, and three descending basal tubes on\r\nits base; the odd posterior tube of the latter corresponds to the caudal\r\nfoot, the two paired anterior to the pectoral feet. There is often also a\r\nfourth foot developed opposite to the caudal, and representing a sternal\r\ntube. Sometimes also two superior tubes are developed, a posterior\r\noccipital and an anterior frontal. The different {1107}apophyses may be\r\nlost by reduction. I have never observed #Botryodea# with more than five\r\napophyses.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the #Botryodea# is not yet sufficiently known, no\r\nliving species having been observed. In some preparations from specimens in\r\nthe Challenger collections, stained by Dr. John Murray with carmine\r\nimmediately after the dredging operation, single #Botryodea# are to be\r\nfound in which the central capsule is deeply coloured. In _Botryopera\r\nquinqueloba_ (Pl. 96, fig. 2) it filled up the greater part of the cephalis\r\nand seemed to be divided into some small lobes. In _Lithobotrys\r\nsphærothorax_ (Pl. 96, fig. 15) it was divided into four lobes, three of\r\nwhich filled the trilobed cephalis, the fourth large lobe occupying a great\r\npart of the spherical thorax. Details of their structure, unfortunately,\r\nwere not recognisable. There can, however, be no doubt that they are the\r\nsame as in all other NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Families of_ #Botryodea#.\r\n\r\n  1.

Since the two latter joints, found in the two following families,\r\nare secondary productions, the Cannobotryida must be regarded as the\r\nancestral forms of all #Botryodea#, in an ontogenetic as well as in a\r\nphylogenetic sense.\r\n\r\nTwo species only of this family have been hitherto known, incompletely\r\ndescribed by Ehrenberg as _Lithobotrys triloba_ and _Lithobotrys\r\nquadriloba_. A great number of similar forms are to be found in the\r\nRadiolarian ooze of the Central Pacific, but they are very minute, and\r\ndifficult to examine. We can describe here only twelve species of these,\r\nwhich we arrange in two genera; _Botryopera_ without porous tubes, and\r\n_Cannobotrys_ bearing a variable number of porous cylindrical tubes (one to\r\nfive). The number of lobes of the cephalis is also variable in each genus\r\n(one to five or more). If in the future these minute and interesting shells\r\nshould be better examined, it would {1108}be advisable to distinguish a\r\nnumber of genera according to the different number of the porous tubes and\r\nof the lobes of the cephalis. The base of the latter is constantly closed\r\nby a basal lattice-plate, and usually exhibits two or three pairs of\r\ncortinar pores, identical with those of the Semantida.\r\n\r\nThe phylogenetic origin of the Cannobotryida may be found either in the\r\nZygospyrida or in the Monocyrtida; they differ from these two similar\r\ngroups in the lobation of the cephalis, which is effected by the\r\ndevelopment of internal septa and external constrictions.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Cannobotryida._\r\n\r\n  Cephalis without porous tubes,                    486. _Botryopera_.\r\n\r\n  Cephalis with a variable number of porous tubes,  487. _Cannobotrys_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 486. _Botryopera_,[104] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Cannobotryida# without tubes on the cephalis.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Botryopera_ is the simplest form among the #Botryodea#, the\r\nshell consisting of a lobate cephalis only, without tubes or radial\r\nappendages.

They correspond therefore to the Dicyrtida among the\r\n#Cyrtoidea#, and to the Phormospyrida among the #Spyroidea#. The thorax, or\r\nthe second shell-joint, is in all these three families a secondary\r\nproduction, arising from the base of the cephalis; therefore the\r\nLithobotryida must be phylogenetically derived from the Cannobotryida.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of _Lithobotrys_ were first described by Ehrenberg as\r\n_Lithobotrys_ and _Lithocorythium_. These two genera are, however,\r\nidentical, as has been {1112}demonstrated by Bütschli (1882, _loc. cit._,\r\np. 519). Some other species united by Ehrenberg with _Lithobotrys_ belong\r\nto other genera. The number of Lithobotryida found in the \"Radiolarian\r\nooze\" of the Challenger collection, is far greater than that of the\r\nCannobotryida and Pylobotryida. But only a small part of them could be\r\nthoroughly examined and described here, so that their number may be greatly\r\naugmented by further accurate researches. We here arrange those forms in\r\nfour genera, representing two different subfamilies. The terminal mouth of\r\nthe thorax remains open in the Botryopylida, whilst it becomes closed by a\r\nlattice-plate in the Botryocellida. In each group there are shells with and\r\nwithout porous tubes. The number of these tubes, and also the number of\r\nlobes of the cephalis, is very variable, and may in future serve for the\r\ndistinction of more genera.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Lithobotryida._\r\n\r\n                               {Cephalis without porous\r\n  I.

It represented by itself the suborder #Botryodea# until the\r\nyear 1860. The numerous species described by Ehrenberg belong to very\r\ndifferent genera of #Botryodea#, and partly also of #Spyroidea#. Following\r\nBütschli (1882) we retain here the name _Lithobotrys_ for those species,\r\nthe type of which is _Lithobotrys geminata_. The genus _Lithocorythium_ of\r\nEhrenberg is for the greater part identical with it. When in the preceding\r\ngenus _Acrobotrys_ the mouth of the thorax becomes closed by lattice work,\r\n_Lithobotrys_ arises. In the latter as well as in the former the number of\r\ntubes on the cephalis is different, and may characterise different\r\nsubgenera.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1118}1. _Lithobotrys geminata_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Lithobotrys geminata_, Ehrenberg, 1875, Abhandl. d. k.

As in the latter, the abdomen is\r\nhere also a later production, arising from the terminal mouth of the\r\nthorax; therefore the Pylobotryida must be derived phylogenetically from\r\nthe Lithobotryida.\r\n\r\nTwo genera of Pylobotryida were incompletely described in 1860 by\r\nEhrenberg, _Botryocyrtis_ and _Botryocampe_. We retain them here, with a\r\nstricter definition, however. Two other genera were added in my\r\nProdromus--_Pylobotrys_ and _Phormobotrys_. {1120}The small number of\r\nspecies here enumerated may be easily increased, since numerous forms,\r\nbelonging probably to this family, are not sufficiently known. Their study\r\nis, however, very difficult and requires accurate examination of the tiny\r\nshells from different sides.\r\n\r\nThe four genera of Pylobotryida, here described, represent two different\r\nsubfamilies. The terminal mouth of the abdomen remains open in the\r\nBotryocyrtida, whilst it becomes closed by a lattice-plate in the\r\nBotryocampida. There are in both groups shells with and without porous\r\ntubes; the number of these tubes, and also the number and disposition of\r\nthe lobes in the cephalis, exhibits remarkable differences in the different\r\nspecies of those genera, and may in future serve for their division into a\r\ngreater number of genera.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Pylobotryida._\r\n\r\n                               { Cephalis without\r\n  I.

In the\r\nfollowing system more than eleven hundred species are described, comprising\r\nabout one-fourth of the number of species in the whole class of Radiolaria.\r\nThis astonishing variety, however, is not effected by development of a\r\nlarge number of different types, but by an extraordinary variability within\r\ncertain restricted boundaries, similar to what is seen among insects and\r\nbirds. The number of genera, therefore, is comparatively small, and they\r\nmay all be disposed into four families only, which in my Monograph (1862,\r\np. 280) were distinguished as Monocyrtida, Dicyrtida, Tricyrtida and\r\nStichocyrtida. If we divide these four groups in the following pages into\r\ntwelve families and twenty-four subfamilies, we are guided by practical\r\nconsiderations only, hoping thereby to give a better survey of the\r\ndifficult labyrinth of Cyrtoidean morphology.\r\n\r\nThe #Cyrtoidea# are characterised by this wonderful richness of specific\r\nforms not only in the present seas, but also for millions of years in the\r\nformer ages of our globe. The majority of all the fossil Radiolaria which\r\nare now known belong to this group, and many species of it are so common\r\nthat great rocks are formed by their union. The fact was first observed by\r\nEhrenberg, who in his first system of _Polycystina_ (1847, _loc. cit._, p.\r\n54) enumerated forty-four genera and two hundred and eighty-two species;\r\nthe #Cyrtoidea#, his Polycystina solitaria, form the preponderant majority\r\nof the whole class, viz., twenty-five genera and one hundred and\r\nninety-three species.\r\n\r\nIn this first system (of 1847), as well as in the last systematic table of\r\nEhrenberg (of 1875, _loc. cit._), the Cyrtida as \"Polycystina solitaria\"\r\nare opposed to all other Radiolaria, as \"Polycystina composita.\" The former\r\nbear the definition \"Testæ siliceæ spatio interno ample pervio, aut passim\r\nlevius transverse constricto\"; the latter, however, \"Testæ siliceæ spatio\r\ninterno celluloso aut strictura longitudinali constricto.\" In reality these\r\ndefinitions are insufficient, and the conclusions which Ehrenberg derived\r\n{1127}from the organisation of the Polycystina solitaria and composita,\r\nwere quite erroneous. So also are the definitions of the three families\r\ninto which he divided the Polycystina solitaria, afterwards (in 1875)\r\ncalled by him \"Monodictya nassellaria.\" These three families were the\r\nHalicalyptrina, Lithochytrina and Eucyrtidina. With these were also united\r\nthe three genera of #Botryodea# known to Ehrenberg (_Lithobotrys_,\r\n_Botryocampe_, _Botryocyrtis_). We entirely separate these here from the\r\ntrue Cyrtida, on account of their lobate or multilocular cephalis.\r\n\r\nWhilst Ehrenberg only knew the skeleton of the Polycystina solitaria, the\r\nfirst observations of living Cyrtida were published by Johannes Müller,\r\n1858, in his fundamental treatise. He gave the first description and\r\nfigures of the central capsule of this group, with the characteristic lobes\r\ndeveloped from its basal part; and of the pseudopodia radiating on all\r\nsides (_loc. cit._, Taf. vi.). The forms described by him were all\r\nMediterranean, one Dicyrtid (_Lithomelissa mediterranea_), two Tricyrtids\r\n(_Eucyrtidium zancleum_ and _Pterocanium charybdeum_), and one Stichocyrtid\r\n(_Lithocampe tropeziana_).\r\n\r\nIn my monograph (1862, p. 272-341) I gave a detailed description of all\r\nknown and some new Cyrtida, and characterised this family by the\r\nfundamental monaxonial form of the shell, with two different poles (an\r\nupper apical and a lower basal pole), and by the unipolar growth, beginning\r\nfrom the apical pole. I pointed out also the peculiar structure of the\r\nmonaxonial central capsule. At that time I divided the Cyrtida into five\r\nsubfamilies, in which, however, the #Spyroidea# (= Zygocyrtida), and the\r\n#Botryodea# (= Polycyrtida) were united with the true #Cyrtoidea#\r\n(Monocyrtida, Dicyrtida, Stichocyrtida).\r\n\r\nThe astonishing number of new and interesting forms of Cyrtida which I\r\nfound in the rich collection of the Challenger (beginning from 1876), and\r\nmainly in the Radiolarian ooze of the Central Pacific (Stations 263 to\r\n274), enabled me to give in my Prodromus, in 1881, a greatly enlarged and\r\namended system of this important group. I separated there the #Spyroidea#\r\n(= Zygocyrtida), and the _Botryodea_ (= Polycyrtida) from the true\r\n#Cyrtoidea# by restricted definition, pointing out the essential\r\ndifferences in the structure of the cephalis in these groups of\r\n#Cyrtellaria#. The latter name, as here used, is therefore identical with\r\nthe \"Cyrtida\" of my Monograph. In the Prodromus I divided the true Cyrtida\r\n(p. 426) into five subfamilies and thirty tribes, corresponding to the\r\ndifferences in the number of the shell-joints and of the radial apophyses,\r\nand in the shape of the closed or open mouth. These groups are here\r\nretained, but reduced to four families and twenty-four subfamilies, since\r\nthe Tetracyrtida are better united with the Stichocyrtida (compare below).\r\n\r\nRichard Hertwig in his work Organismus der Radiolarien (1879, pp. 74 to 86)\r\ngave the first accurate description of the finer structure of the central\r\ncapsule of the Cyrtida, and pointed out their character as true MONOPYLEA,\r\nwith porochora and {1128}podoconus, and the peculiar shape of its nucleus.\r\nHe also published excellent figures of some interesting new species.\r\n\r\nO. Bütschli, 1882, in his valuable paper entitled: \"Beiträge zur Kentniss\r\nder Radiolarien-Skelette, insbesondere der der Cyrtida\" (Zeitschr. für\r\nwiss. Zool., vol. xxxvi. p. 485) made an attempt at a natural\r\nclassification of the Cyrtida, which he derived from the #Spyroidea# or\r\nZygocyrtida. As already mentioned above, we cannot accept this essay as the\r\nfoundation of a true natural system, since the affinities of the\r\n#Cyrtellaria# (and of the NASSELLARIA as a whole) are far more complicated\r\nand difficult than Bütschli supposed. His views were supported by accurate\r\nobservations only on the structure of the fossil #Cyrtoidea# of Barbados;\r\nthese, however, represent the minority only of the genera, and many\r\ninteresting and important forms (mainly of true \"Monocyrtida\") remained\r\nunknown to Bütschli. A great part, however, of his observations are very\r\nuseful, and his remarks on comparative morphology are very suggestive.\r\n\r\nThe #Cyrtoidea# may be divided into families and subfamilies according to\r\nthree different principles, viz., (1) the number of joints into which the\r\nshell is divided by transverse strictures; (2) the number of radial\r\napophyses which arise from the shell; (3) the shape of the basal mouth,\r\nwhich is either open or closed by a lattice-plate. At present every attempt\r\nof classification in this large group must be more or less artificial,\r\nsince the affinities of the numerous smaller and larger groups are\r\nextremely complicated, and the ontogeny, the only sure guide in this\r\nphylogenetical labyrinth, is perfectly unknown. It seems therefore the most\r\nconvenient to employ for our artificial classification, first, the number\r\nof shell-joints, second, the radial structure, and third, the shape of the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nA. The number of joints into which the shell is divided by transverse\r\nconstrictions, serves here for the distinction of four primary groups or\r\nsuborders of the #Cyrtoidea#, viz., (1) Monocyrtida with one joint; (2)\r\nDicyrtida with two joints; (3) Tricyrtida with three joints; and (4)\r\nStichocyrtida with four or more joints. In my Prodromus (1881, p. 426) I\r\ndivided the latter group into Tetracyrtida (with four joints), and\r\nStichocyrtida (with five or more joints); but these two groups may be\r\nunited, since the fourth and all the succeeding joints are of rather\r\nindifferent shape and of little morphological value. The three first\r\njoints, however, are usually very different and possess a high\r\nmorphological importance, so that we distinguish the first joint as\r\ncephalis, the second as thorax, and the third as abdomen. The uppermost\r\ntransverse constriction, which separates the two first joints, cephalis and\r\nthorax, is the collar stricture and is usually caused by an internal\r\nfenestrated septum, the cortinar septum. The second constriction, which\r\nseparates the second and third joints (thorax and abdomen) is called the\r\nlumbar constriction. The following constrictions (in the Stichocyrtida) are\r\nindifferent and of little morphological interest, and require therefore no\r\npeculiar designation.\r\n\r\n{1129}B. The radial structure, indicated by radial apophyses arising from\r\nthe shell, offers three principal differences, according to which the whole\r\ngroup of #Cyrtoidea# may be divided into three large groups or sections,\r\nviz., (1) Pilocyrtida, or Cyrtoidea triradiata, with three radial\r\napophyses; (2) Astrocyrtida, or Cyrtoidea multiradiata, with numerous\r\nradial apophyses (four to nine or more); and (3) Corocyrtida, or Cyrtoidea\r\neradiata, without external radial apophyses. The majority of #Cyrtoidea#\r\nare Pilocyrtida, with three radial apophyses, which are probably homologous\r\nto the three primary feet of the #Plectoidea# and of _Cortina_ (therefore\r\n\"cortinar feet\"). The Astrocyrtida, or the #Cyrtoidea# with a variable\r\nnumber of radial apophyses (at least four to six) may be derived from the\r\nPilocyrtida by interpolation of secondary or interradial apophyses between\r\nthe three primary or perradial apophyses. The Corocyrtida, however, or the\r\n#Cyrtoidea# without external radial apophyses, may have originated by\r\nreduction and loss of the latter, either from the Pilocyrtida or from the\r\nAstrocyrtida.\r\n\r\nC. The shape of the basal mouth in the #Cyrtoidea# exhibits two essential\r\ndifferences only, viz., (1) the terminal mouth of the shell is a simple\r\nwide opening in the Stomocyrtida, or (2) the terminal mouth is closed by a\r\nlattice-plate, in the Clistocyrtida. As these two different cases occur in\r\nall the twelve families, which we have distinguished according to the\r\ndifferences in the number of joints and in the radial structure, we get\r\naltogether twenty-four subfamilies which are synoptically arranged in the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n  |   Synopsis of the four    |                                 |\r\n  | sections, twelve families |          PILOCYRTIDA.           |\r\n  |and twenty-four subfamilies|     Cyrtoidea triradiata.       |\r\n  |      of CYRTOIDEA.        |   (Three radial apophyses.)     |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |   Mouth of the shell.     |    _Aperta._   |    _Clausa._   |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |      MONOCYRTIDA.         |           TRIPOCALPIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea monothalamia).  |  Archipilida.  |  Archiperida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |       DICYRTIDA.          |           TRIPOCYRTIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea dithalamia).    |  Sethopilida.  |  Sethoperida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |       TRICYRTIDA.         |            PODOCYRTIDA.         |\r\n  | (Cyrtoidea trithalamia).  |   Theopilida.  |  Theoperida.   |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |     STICHOCYRTIDA.        |            PODOCAMPIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea polythalamia).  |  Stichopilida. | Stichoperida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n  |                           |          ASTROCYRTIDA.          |\r\n  |                           |     Cyrtoidea multiradiata.     |\r\n  |                           |(Four to nine or more apophyses.)|\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |   Mouth of the shell.     |    _Aperta._   |    _Clausa._   |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |      MONOCYRTIDA.         |           PHÆNOCALPIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea monothalamia).  | Archiphormida. | Archiphænida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |       DICYRTIDA.          |           ANTHOCYRTIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea dithalamia).    | Sethophormida. | Sethophænida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n  |       TRICYRTIDA.         |           PHORMOCYRTIDA.        |\r\n  | (Cyrtoidea trithalamia).  |  Theophormida. |  Theophænida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |     STICHOCYRTIDA.        |           PHORMOCAMPIDA.        |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea polythalamia).  | Stichophormida.| Stichophænida. |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |                           |          COROCYRTIDA.           |\r\n  |                           |      Cyrtoidea eradiata.        |\r\n  |                           |     (No radial apophyses.)      |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |   Mouth of the shell.     |    _Aperta._   |    _Clausa._   |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |      MONOCYRTIDA.         |           CYRTOCALPIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea monothalamia).  |   Archicorida. |  Archicapsida. |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |       DICYRTIDA.          |           SETHOCYRTIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea dithalamia).    |   Sethocorida. | Sethocapsida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n  |       TRICYRTIDA.         |           THEOCYRTIDA.          |\r\n  | (Cyrtoidea trithalamia).  |   Theocorida.  |  Theocapsida.  |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |     STICHOCYRTIDA.        |           LITHOCAMPIDA.         |\r\n  |(Cyrtoidea polythalamia).  |  Stichocorida. | Stichocapsida. |\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n{1130}The cephalis, or the first shell-joint of the #Cyrtoidea#, is in the\r\nmajority homologous with the cephalis of the #Spyroidea#, from which it\r\ndiffers in the reduction of the sagittal ring and the absence of the\r\ncorresponding sagittal constriction; its cavity is therefore simple, not\r\nbilocular. Its homology with the original cephalis of the #Spyroidea#\r\ncannot be doubted, when its base exhibits the typical basal pores of the\r\nSemantida. But in many cases these are wanting, and in a great number of\r\n#Cyrtoidea# (mainly of Monocyrtida) there is more or less evidence that the\r\noriginal cephalis is lost, and that the real first joint is the thorax, the\r\noriginal second joint. At present it is quite impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween the former and the latter shells, and therefore in the following\r\ndescriptions the first joint is always named cephalis and the second\r\nthorax. In future, when the affinities of the #Cyrtoidea# become better\r\nknown, it will be necessary to distinguish the \"Archicephalis,\" or true\r\ncephalis of all #Spyroidea# and of the majority of #Cyrtoidea#, from the\r\n\"Pseudocephalis\" or the false cephalis of the minority (_e.g._, of many\r\nMonocyrtida aperta, Archipilida, Archiphormida, Archicorida, &c.).\r\n\r\nThe thorax, or the second shell-joint of the #Cyrtoidea#, is in the\r\nmajority homologous with the thorax of the Phormospyrida and Androspyrida,\r\nand therefore developed by apophyses, which arise from the base of the\r\ncephalis and become united by transverse branches forming a lattice-plate.\r\nIts size is generally in inverse proportion to that of the cephalis. The\r\nmore the cephalis becomes reduced, the more the thorax is developed. Its\r\nform is very variable, usually three-sided pyramidal or prismatic in the\r\ntriradiate, polyhedral in the multiradiate, and conical or cylindrical in\r\nthe eradiate #Cyrtoidea#. Its terminal mouth is either a simple wide\r\nopening, or closed by a lattice-plate. In the majority of #Cyrtoidea# the\r\nthorax is separated from the cephalis not only by the external collar\r\nconstriction, but also by the internal cortinar septum, a horizontal\r\nlattice-plate which exhibits the typical basal pores of the Semantida\r\n(usually two smaller jugular and two larger cardinal pores). But this\r\nseptum is often reduced or perfectly lost, and then the external collar\r\nconstriction alone indicates the separation of the cephalis and the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen, or the third shell-joint of the #Cyrtoidea#, absent in the\r\nMonocyrtida and Dicyrtida (as also in all #Spyroidea#), occurs constantly\r\nin all Tricyrtida and Stichocyrtida. It is a simple large chamber in the\r\nTricyrtida, but forms an annulated body, composed of a variable number of\r\nsuccessive joints, in the Stichocyrtida. The constrictions between these\r\njoints, and also the lumbar constriction, between abdomen and thorax, are\r\nusually provided with a lattice-girdle, projecting into the cavity of the\r\nshell, like a diaphragm. Usually this horizontal girdle bears only a single\r\ncircle of pores, rarely two or more. In many #Cyrtoidea# it is replaced by\r\na solid horizontal ring of silex, and often it is wanting. It originates by\r\nthe insertion of the following shell-joint, which takes place not on the\r\nterminal mouth of the preceding joint, but somewhat above it.\r\n\r\n{1131}The annular joints of the Stichocyrtida succeeding the third joint,\r\nand very variable in number, may be regarded either as a series of new\r\npostabdominal chambers, succeeding the true abdomen, or as secondary joints\r\nof the annulated abdomen itself. The latter view may be sustained by the\r\nfact that these joints are usually of an indifferent shape, and do not\r\npossess the characteristic features which we find in the first three\r\njoints, the abdomen, the thorax and the cephalis.\r\n\r\nThe lattice-work of the shell exhibits in the #Cyrtoidea# an extraordinary\r\nvariety, similar to that of the #Sphæroidea#; it serves in the first place\r\nfor the distinction of species. The three first joints of the shell are\r\noften distinguished by the different character of the lattice-work. The\r\ncephalis has usually very small and simple pores. The lattice-work of the\r\nthorax is often characterised by radial structures. The pores of the\r\nabdomen are usually very numerous and regular. The numerous joints in the\r\nannulated abdomen of the Stichocyrtida commonly exhibit little variety.\r\n\r\nThe closure of the mouth, effected by a convex or horizontal terminal\r\nlattice-plate, has a different signification in the Monocyrtida and in the\r\njointed #Cyrtoidea#. In the Monocyrtida clausa this closing plate is the\r\noriginal cortinar plate or the basal plate of the cephalis. In the jointed\r\n#Cyrtoidea#, however, the lattice-plate which closes the terminal mouth of\r\nthe thorax or of the abdomen (of the last annular joint in the\r\nStichocyrtida), is produced by central union of the convergent edges, which\r\ngrow centripetally from the margin of the mouth of the last joint towards\r\nits centre.\r\n\r\nThe radial apophyses arising from the shell of the #Cyrtoidea# may probably\r\nbe always derived from that tripodal structure which is found in all\r\n#Plectoidea#, in _Cortina_ and _Cortiniscus_ among the #Stephoidea#, and in\r\nthe majority of #Spyroidea#. Therefore the prototype of this radial\r\nstructure would be _Plagoniscus_ and _Cortina_, with four radial spines\r\nunited in a common point, the cortinar centrum; an ascending apical horn\r\nand three descending basal feet. The odd posterior or caudal foot is\r\nusually similar in shape to the two paired anterior or pectoral feet, but\r\nmay be distinguished from these latter by its relation to the apical horn.\r\nVery frequently an internal vertical free columella arises in the cephalis,\r\nor instead of it an ascending rib in the dorsal wall of the cephalis, which\r\nconnects the base of the apical horn with the origin of the caudal foot.\r\nThis is probably the remaining part of the sagittal ring. More rarely also\r\na part of the ventral rod of the latter is preserved, or on the anterior\r\npole of the basal rod of the cephalis an ascending procolumella arises\r\nwhich is inserted on the frontal face of the cephalis, and sometimes\r\nprolonged into a nasal horn (the rod, C, of Bütschli). These two odd horns,\r\nthe posterior apical horn and the anterior nasal horn, are usually\r\ndifferent and divergent. In some genera a variable number of accessory\r\nradial horns is developed on the convex face of the cephalis. In many\r\nhornless genera the free apical horn is lost, but not unfrequently the\r\ncolumella is preserved which connects the caudal foot with that point of\r\nthe cephalis, in which formerly the apical horn was inserted.\r\n\r\n{1132}The three primary radial beams, corresponding to the three basal feet\r\nof _Plectaniscus_ and _Cortina_, exhibit in the #Cyrtoidea# the greatest\r\nvariety in form and size, and chiefly in their relation to the shell, the\r\nlatter serving mainly for the distinction of genera. Originally these three\r\ncortinar beams arise from the basal plate of the cephalis, the odd caudal\r\nfoot appearing as a prolongation of the basal rod of that plate, and the\r\npaired pectoral feet as prolongations of its coracal rods (between the\r\njugular and cardinal pores). The lattice-work of the thorax is developed\r\nusually between the three cortinar feet, more rarely inside or outside of\r\nthem. Therefore the three beams appear commonly as three divergent ribs in\r\nthe wall of the thorax, and continue over its basal mouth as three free\r\nterminal feet. With the increasing length of the shell and the number of\r\nits joints the three radial ribs are also prolonged, and their free distal\r\nends may be prominent at very different points, either as three lateral\r\nwings or as three terminal feet. These are either solid spines or\r\nlattice-plates, sometimes more or less ramified.\r\n\r\nThe three radial apophyses are prevalent in the majority of the\r\n#Cyrtoidea#, which we call \"Pilocyrtida\" (or Cyrtoidea triradiata). Their\r\nnumber increases in the Astrocyrtida (or Cyrtoidea multiradiata). The most\r\nfrequent cases of multiplication are here caused by the development of six\r\nor nine radial apophyses; these may be enclosed ribs, or lateral wings, or\r\nterminal feet. In the sexradial #Cyrtoidea# there are three secondary or\r\ninterradial apophyses interpolated between the three primary or perradial;\r\nin the nine-radial #Cyrtoidea#, however, there are six adradial apophyses\r\ninterpolated.\r\n\r\nA third and last great group is formed by the Corocyrtida or Cyrtoidea\r\neradiata. These exhibit no radial apophyses, neither enclosed ribs, nor\r\nfree lateral wings, nor terminal feet. But in a great number of them\r\ninternal traces of an original triradiate structure are visible, mainly in\r\nthe cortinar septum between cephalis and thorax; this often exhibits three\r\nor four, and sometimes six cortinar or collar pores, of the same typical\r\nshape as in the triradial #Spyroidea#. Sometimes even an internal columella\r\nwith three radial branches is preserved, as in _Axocorys_. It is therefore\r\nvery probable that a great part of these Cyrtoidea eradiata (if not all)\r\nmay be derived from triradiate or multiradiate ancestral forms, by\r\nreduction and loss of the radial apophyses. In another part of this group,\r\nmainly in the Monocyrtida eradiata (Cyrtocalpida) it is possible, or even\r\nprobable, that their eradiate shell has originated independently from\r\nNassellida, and that they have no true relation to radial #Cyrtoidea#.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the #Cyrtoidea#, first observed by J. Müller\r\n(1858), and more fully described in my Monograph (1862), was very\r\naccurately examined by Richard Hertwig (1879). His observations were\r\nconfirmed by numerous new forms, which I was able to examine in\r\nwell-preserved preparations of the Challenger. The central capsule,\r\naccording to these, exhibits the same typical shape, which is\r\ncharacteristic of all MONOPYLEA (with porochora and podoconus), and may be\r\nderived with the latter from the common ancestral forms, _Cystidium_ and\r\n_Nassella_ (= the skeletonless Nassellida). In {1133}the majority, however,\r\nof #Cyrtoidea#, the capsule develops on its basal face a number of\r\ndepending lobes, as were also found in some #Spyroidea# (and probably also\r\n#Botryodea#). In this respect we may distinguish two main forms of the\r\ncapsule in the #Cyrtellaria#, viz., the primary simple, not lobate form,\r\nand the secondary lobate form. The central capsule is originally always\r\nenclosed in the cephalis, and has there a simple, subspherical, ellipsoidal\r\nor ovate form. As soon as their growth increases, and the enclosing\r\ncephalis becomes too narrow, it sends out prolongations in the form of\r\nbasal lobes, which depend from its base, and proceed through the pores of\r\nthe basal lattice of the cephalis, or the cortinar pores. In the great\r\nmajority of #Cyrtoidea# in which the capsule was observed, either three or\r\nfour such lobes were seen (already described by J. Müller). Of course this\r\nnumber depends upon the number of cortinar pores, which is either three or\r\nfour; therefore in the #Cyrtoidea# with three pores in the cortinar plate,\r\nwe find three lobes of the central capsule (an odd posterior and two paired\r\nanterior); in the #Cyrtoidea#, however, with four pores in the cortinar\r\nplate (the majority) we find four lobes of the central capsule (two smaller\r\nanterior jugular and two larger posterior cardinal lobes). Usually each\r\nlobe is ovate or pear-shaped and encloses a large oil-globule, and often\r\nalso an apophysis of the cell-nucleus.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nSection I.

(#Cyrtoidea# with a simple, not\r\njointed shell, representing a simple cephalis, with three radial\r\napophyses.)\r\n\r\n{1134}The family Tripocalpida, composed of the Archipilida and Archiperida\r\nof my Prodromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the lattice-shell is\r\nquite simple, without transverse constriction, and bears three radial\r\napophyses. The two subfamilies differ in the shape of the basal mouth,\r\nwhich in the Archipilida is a simple wide opening, in the Archiperida\r\nclosed by a lattice-plate; the former are here divided into eight, the\r\nlatter into seven different genera.\r\n\r\nOnly three species of this family were hitherto described, all three\r\nbelonging to the Archipilida, viz., (1) _Tripocalpis galea_ (fossil in\r\nBarbados, figured by Ehrenberg, 1875, as _Halicalyptra galea_), (2)\r\n_Tripodiscium campanula_ (fossil in Sicily, figured by Stöhr, 1880, as\r\n_Carpocanium_); and (3) _Tridictyopus elegans_, of which Richard Hertwig\r\ngave an excellent description in 1879, with an accurate figure of the\r\ncentral capsule. All the other species of the family (seventy) are new.\r\n\r\nThe shell in the majority of Tripocalpida is ovate or campanulate,\r\nsometimes conical or three-sided pyramidal. Three radial apophyses are\r\nconstantly distinct, either three lateral wings or three terminal feet;\r\nthese are usually solid spines, rarely lattice-plates. The top of the shell\r\nusually bears an apical horn, rarely two or more horns; often the horn is\r\nwanting. The lattice-work of the shell is very various in the different\r\nspecies, and often of a remarkable structure (Pl. 51, figs. 6-8; Pl. 98,\r\nfigs. 4-8). The cavity of the shell is in all Archipilida, and in a part of\r\nthe Archiperida (_Peridium_, _Archipera_, _Archibursa_) quite simple. In\r\nthe other part of the Archiperida, however, constituting the peculiar group\r\nof Euscenida (genera 504-507), a vertical columella arises in the centre of\r\nthe basal plate, and is prolonged upwards in the apical horn; this\r\ncolumella is either simple (_Euscenium_, _Archiscenium_) or branched\r\n(_Cladoscenium_, _Pteroscenium_); in the latter case the ascending branches\r\nare disposed in triradiate verticils and are inserted on the inner face of\r\nthe shell (compare Pl. 53, figs. 11-16, and Pl. 98, figs. 1-4).\r\n\r\nThe phylogenetic origin of the Tripocalpida may be very divergent, and\r\ntheir morphological affinity to the other #Nassellaria# is a very\r\ncomplicated problem. The Euscenida (genera 504-507) may be derived directly\r\nfrom the Plagonida (_Plagoniscus_) or Plectanida (_Plectaniscus_). The\r\nArchibursida (genera 508-510) however, manifest a closer affinity to the\r\nTripospyrida, and may be derived from them by reduction of the sagittal\r\nring and constriction. In these two groups of Archiperida the shell may be\r\nregarded as a true cephalis. In the Archipilida, however, where the shell\r\nhas a wide basal opening and the three radial ribs arise originally from\r\nthe base of the apical horn, the shell itself may correspond to the thorax\r\nof the Dicyrtida, and may be derived from these by loss of the cephalis.\r\nThis is the more probable, as sometimes a small remnant of the reduced\r\ncephalis is preserved (Pl. 98, fig. 8). None of these difficult questions\r\ncan be answered until a much closer morphological knowledge of the\r\nTripocalpida is acquired.\r\n\r\n{1135}_Synopsis of the Genera of Tripocalpida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

(#Cyrtoidea# with a simple, not\r\njointed shell, resembling a simple cephalis, with numerous radial apophyses\r\n(four to nine or more).\r\n\r\nThe family #Phænocalpida#, composed of the Archiphormida and Archiphænida\r\nof my Prodromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the lattice-shell is\r\nquite without transverse constriction, but bears numerous radial apophyses.\r\nThe two subfamilies differ in the shape of the basal mouth, which in the\r\nArchiphormida is a simple wide opening, but is closed in the Archiphænida\r\nby a lattice-plate.\r\n\r\nSeveral Phænocalpida were formerly described by Ehrenberg, viz.,\r\n_Halicalyptra virginica_ (in 1844) and _Litharachnium arachnodiscus_ (in\r\n1872, called by him _Carpocanium_, though it is quite different from this\r\ngenus, and closely allied to my _Litharachnium tentorium_, figured in\r\n1862). These forms belong to the Archiphormida (with open mouth). Several\r\nfossil Archiphænida (with closed mouth) were figured by Ehrenberg, in 1875,\r\nas belonging to _Petalospyris_ (_ocellata_, _carinata_, _flabellum_),\r\nthough the absence of the sagittal ring and the corresponding longitudinal\r\nconstriction demonstrates their character as _Phænocalpis_.\r\n\r\n{1158}The Phænocalpida are probably an artificial family, composed of three\r\nor four (or perhaps more) different groups, which have a quite different\r\norigin. The Litharachnida (genera 511-515) and the Haliphormida (genera\r\n516-518) are probably derived from the Sethophormida by loss of the\r\ncephalis, the retrograde metamorphosis of which may be observed in all its\r\ndifferent stages. The Halicalyptrida (genera 519-521) are perhaps\r\nindependent of the other Phænocalpida, and may be Archicorida which have\r\nproduced a corona of teeth around the mouth, without relation to lost\r\nradial ribs. The Phænoscenida (_Phænocalpis_, _Phænoscenium_) may be\r\nderived from the Euscenida (genera 504-507) by interpolation of interradial\r\nfeet between the three primary ones, or directly from the #Plectoidea#. The\r\nCalpophænida, on the other hand (_Calpophæna_, _Archiphæna_), may have\r\narisen from the Zygospyrida (_Petalospyris_, _Gorgospyris_) by loss of the\r\nsagittal ring and the longitudinal constriction. The phylogeny of the\r\nPhænocalpida is therefore a very complicated problem, as yet unsolved.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Phænocalpida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

(#Cyrtoidea# with a simple, not\r\njointed shell, representing a simple cephalis without radial apophyses.)\r\n\r\nThe family #Cyrtocalpida#, composed of the Archicorida and Archicapsida of\r\nmy {1179}Prodromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the lattice-shell\r\nis quite simple, without transverse constriction, and without radial\r\napophyses. The two subfamilies differ in the shape of the basal mouth,\r\nwhich in the Archicorida is a simple wide opening, but in the Archicapsida\r\nis closed by a lattice-plate.\r\n\r\nOnly a few species of this family were formerly known. Ehrenberg, in 1838,\r\nfounded upon these the genus _Cornutella_, one of the three oldest genera\r\nof Polycystina (_Cornutella_, _Lithocampe_, _Haliomma_). In 1862 I\r\ndescribed some living forms, with a central capsule, as _Cyrtocalpis_. The\r\nChallenger collection contains a large number of new genera and species.\r\n\r\nProbably the family Cyrtocalpida is an artificial group, comprising two or\r\nmore different subfamilies of very different origin. The Cornutellida\r\n(_Cornutella_, _Cornutanna_) have probably been derived from the\r\nSethocorida by loss of the cephalis, so that their conical shell represents\r\na thorax alone. The Mitrocalpida on the other hand (genera 528-531) may be\r\noriginally simple ovate shells (like _Gromia_ and _Lecythium_), arising\r\nindependently from the Nassellida. The Archicapsida (_Halicapsa_,\r\n_Archicapsa_) are probably derived from the Zygospyrida (_Dictyospyris_,\r\n_Circospyris_) by loss of the sagittal ring and constriction. This is\r\nnearly certain, when the three or four typical cortinar pores appear in\r\ntheir basal plate. Some forms of _Halicapsa_ may be easily confounded with\r\nsome forms of Prunoidea (_Lithapium_).\r\n\r\nThose Cyrtocalpida, which possess a central capsule with three or four\r\nlobes, are probably derived from Tripocyrtida by loss of the three feet, or\r\nfrom Sethocyrtida by loss of the cephalis, since the lobes indicate the\r\noriginal presence of cortinar pores and of a cephalis. Those Cyrtocalpida,\r\nhowever, in which a simple ovate shell encloses a simple central capsule\r\nwithout lobes, may be original \"Monocyrtida eradiata,\" without relation to\r\nany radial ancestral forms.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Cyrtocalpida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Its basal mouth is\r\nmore or less constricted, as in {1186}the preceding genus _Archicorys_,\r\nfrom which it differs in the total absence of an apical horn. There is no\r\ntrace of any triradial structure, excepting in some smaller species, in\r\nwhich the basal part of the central capsule is trilobate; these may be\r\nderived from the Dicyrtides _Sethocorys_ or _Dictyocephalus_, by loss of\r\nthe cephalis and the cortinar septum.

(#Cyrtoidea# with a two-jointed\r\nshell, divided by a transverse constriction into cephalis and thorax, and\r\nbearing three radial apophyses.)\r\n\r\n{1193}The family #Tripocyrtida#, composed of the Sethopilida and\r\nSethoperida of my Prodromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the\r\nlattice-shell is two-jointed and bears three radial apophyses. The two\r\nsubfamilies differ in the shape of the mouth, which in the Sethopilida is a\r\nsimple wide opening, but in the Sethoperida is closed by a lattice-plate;\r\nthe former are here divided into sixteen, the latter into eight different\r\ngenera. Though probably the two shell-joints are not truly homologous in\r\nall Tripocyrtida, we call the first joint here, as in all Dicyrtida, the\r\ncephalis, and the second joint the thorax.\r\n\r\nNumerous Tripocyrtida, living as well as fossil forms, were formerly\r\ndescribed by Ehrenberg. His genera _Dictyophimus_, _Clathrocanium_,\r\n_Lithomelissa_, and _Lychnocanium_ belong to the Sethopilida, and have the\r\nmouth open; his genera _Lithopera_ and _Lithochytris_ (partly) belong to\r\nthe Sethoperida, and have the basal mouth closed by a lattice-plate. Many\r\nof these Tripocyrtida belong probably to the oldest forms of Dicyrtida, are\r\nnearly related to the Phormospyrida, and therefore of special phylogenetic\r\ninterest, as was demonstrated by Bütschli (1882, _loc. cit._, pp. 514-519).\r\nThis near relation to certain #Spyroidea# (_Tripospyris_, _Acrospyris_,\r\n&c.) is particularly striking in some forms of _Clathrocanium_,\r\n_Lithomelissa_, &c. Some other Tripocyrtida seem to possess a closer\r\nrelation to certain #Plectoidea# (_Plagoniscus_, _Plectaniscus_), so mainly\r\nsome forms of _Tripocyrtis_ and _Dictyophimus_.\r\n\r\nThe cephalis, or the first joint of the shell, corresponds usually to the\r\nwhole shell of the Zygospyrida and of numerous Monocyrtida, and exhibits\r\nvarious modifications of shape, which have been already described in these\r\nlatter families. It is usually subspherical or hemispherical and armed with\r\nan apical horn. In a small number of genera the horn is lost, in some other\r\ngenera multiplied. The cephalis is separated from the thorax not only\r\nexternally by the collar constriction, but commonly also internally by a\r\ntransverse horizontal fenestrated septum, which usually exhibits three or\r\nfour characteristic cortinar pores. The central capsule, originally\r\nenclosed in the cephalis, develops usually three or four large pear-shaped\r\ncæcal sacs which pass through the cortinar pores and depend into the thorax\r\n(Pl. 55, figs. 2-11; Pl. 60, figs. 3-7, &c.).\r\n\r\nThe thorax in this family exhibits a great variety of interesting\r\nmodifications, mainly in the development of the three radial apophyses\r\narising from it. These may be either enclosed in the wall of the thorax as\r\nribs, or arise as free wings, very often prolonged over the mouth as three\r\nterminal feet. Finally the three terminal feet only remain, whilst the\r\noriginal ribs are lost. The special ornamentation of these three apophyses\r\nexhibits an extraordinary variety and elegancy of structure, and many\r\nTripocyrtida belong, no doubt, to the most graceful and admirable forms of\r\nNASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n{1194}_Synopsis of the Genera of Tripocyrtida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The cephalis bears an apical horn, and the\r\nthorax three ribs, which are prolonged over the open mouth into three solid\r\nfeet. _Dictyophimus_ may be derived either from _Euscenium_ or _Peridium_\r\n(Archiperida), or from _Tripospyris_ (Zygospyrida), or from _Plectaniscus_\r\n(Plectanida), by development of lattice-work between the three terminal\r\nfeet, which therefore become thoracic ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Dictyophimium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Shell smooth or rough, without prominent spines on the edges\r\nof the three thoracic ribs.

Cephalis with one or more horns.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Lithomelissa_, containing numerous and widely distributed forms,\r\nmay like _Dictyophimus_ be regarded as one of the most primitive and\r\nancient forms of Dicyrtida. It differs from the latter by the lateral (not\r\nterminal) position of the three thoracic feet, and may be derived either\r\nfrom _Dictyophimus_ (by secondary development of intrapedal network towards\r\nthe mouth, on the inside of the three feet) or directly from _Tripospyris_\r\nby similar formation of thoracic network beyond the collar stricture,\r\noutside the base of the three divergent feet and pierced by the latter. As\r\nthe species of this genus are numerous, it may perhaps be better to divide\r\nit into two or three genera: _Acromelissa_, with a single horn,\r\n_Micromelissa_, with two horns, and _Sethomelissa_, with three or more\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Acromelissa_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 431.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Cephalis with a single occipital horn.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1204}1. _Lithomelissa macroptera_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Lithomelissa macroptera_, Ehrenberg, 1875, Abhandl. d. k.

It differs from the latter mainly in the incomplete fenestration\r\nof the shell, three large interradial holes remaining between the three\r\nperradial thoracic ribs. It may therefore be derived either from\r\n_Euscenium_ or from _Tripospyris_ by the development of a terminal\r\nlattice-band between the three feet. _Clathrocanium_ may be divided into\r\ntwo different subgenera: _Clathrocanidium_, with simple horn and smooth\r\nmouth, and _Clathrocorona_, with fenestrated horn and coronated mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Clathrocanidium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Horn of the cephalis simple, not fenestrated.

The front of the\r\nlatter is armed with a large frontal horn.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Clathromitra_ differs from the preceding similar _Callimitra_ in\r\nthe development of a free frontal or sternal horn, a prolongation of an\r\ninternal obliquely ascending rod, opposite to the caudal foot. Therefore\r\nthe shell in this genus possesses five divergent free spines, two cephalic\r\nhorns, and three thoracic feet.

The three ribs are connected with the central apical\r\nhorn of the cephalis by three vertical latticed wings.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Clathrocorys_ differs from the two preceding nearly allied\r\ngenera in the incomplete fenestration of the thorax, the three perradial\r\nribs of which are separated by three large interradial holes. It has\r\ntherefore the same relation to _Callimitra_ that _Clathrocanium_ bears to\r\n_Dictyophimus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Clathrocorys murrayi_, n. sp. (Pl. 64, fig. 8).\r\n\r\nCephalis pear-shaped, with irregularly square pores. From the centre of its\r\nbase there arise four strong, prismatic, radial beams of nearly equal size,\r\nthe vertical, straight, cephalic horn being little longer than the three\r\ndivergent, somewhat curved feet. In the three meridional planes (between\r\nthe horn and each foot) a few rather thick branches arise, which by\r\ncommunication of the ramules form the three vertical latticed wings; each\r\nwing with two large meshes, three to five meshes of medium size, and three\r\nto four parallel arachnoidal rows of small, square, distal meshes. The\r\nthree walls of the flat pyramidal thorax (between every two feet) are\r\nformed in the upper part by squarish network {1220}similar to that of the\r\ncephalis, in the middle part by a single row of arches separated by thin\r\nthreads, and in the lower part by a narrow band of arachnoidal network.\r\nDedicated to Dr. John Murray.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.05 long, 0.05 broad; thorax 0.04 long, 0.15\r\nbroad; apical distance of every two feet 0.15, of each foot and the horn\r\n0.17.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Clathrocorys teuscheri_, n. sp.

From the centre of its\r\nbase there arise seven prismatic, radial beams of equal strength,\r\nsupporting the lattice-work of the wall; the single vertical beam is\r\nprolonged into the apical horn; six others lie in the three meridian planes\r\n(between the horn and each foot); three ascending end in the wall of the\r\ncephalis, three descending are prolonged into the three strong feet, which\r\nare longer than the horn. In each meridional plane there arise four thicker\r\nand several thinner bars, which by communication of their ramules form the\r\nthree latticed wings; each wing with a single very large mesh, two meshes\r\nof medium size, and a narrow marginal band of small, square pores. The\r\nthree walls of the flat pyramidal thorax are formed in the upper part by\r\nsquarish network similar to that of the cephalis, in the lower part by a\r\nnarrow band of the same; between them a large hole.

From the centre of\r\nits base there arise seven prismatic, radial beams of different strength;\r\nthe single vertical beam bears six lateral branches (parallel to the three\r\nascending supporting beams), and is prolonged into the apical horn; six\r\nothers lie in the three meridional planes (between the horn and each foot);\r\nthree weaker ascending beams end in the wall of the cephalis, three\r\nstronger descending are prolonged into the three large diverging feet,\r\nwhich are twice as long as the cephalic horn. The network of the three\r\nwings and of the three-sided pyramidal thorax is about the same as in the\r\npreceding species, but much more developed; the marginal bands with the\r\nsquarish network are much broader, and an arachnoidal wicker-work of very\r\nthin thread-like bars fills out the large meshes.

Cephalis with a horn.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Lithopera_ is, like the preceding _Sethopera_, one of the most\r\nsimple and oldest forms of the Sethoperida, and exhibits three divergent\r\nthoracic ribs, which are prolonged neither into lateral wings nor into\r\nbasal feet. But whilst in _Sethopera_ the three ribs are enclosed in the\r\nlattice-work of the shell-wall, in _Lithopera_ they lie freely in its\r\ncavity, and are overgrown by the enveloping shell-wall, being inserted on\r\nits inner face with their distal ends. _Lithopera_ may be derived directly\r\nfrom _Lithomelissa_, by development of lattice-work closing the\r\nshell-mouth. Therefore the lower part of the cephalis is hidden in the\r\nuppermost part of the thorax; only its upper part is free.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Lithopera bacca_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Lithopera bacca_, Ehrenberg, 1872, Abhandl. d. k.

(#Cyrtoidea# with a two-jointed\r\nshell, divided by a transverse constriction into cephalis and thorax, and\r\nbearing numerous--four to nine or more--radial apophyses.)\r\n\r\nThe family #Anthocyrtida#, composed of the Sethophormida and Sethophænida\r\nof my Prodromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the shell is\r\ntwo-jointed and bears numerous radial apophyses. The two subfamilies differ\r\nin the shape of the mouth, which in the Sethophormida is a simple, wide\r\nopening; in the Sethophænida closed by a lattice-plate.\r\n\r\nNumerous fossil and living forms of Anthocyrtida were described formerly by\r\nEhrenberg in his genera _Carpocanium_ and _Anthocyrtis_. These, however,\r\nrepresent only a small part of the whole family, which exhibits a great\r\nvariety in the composition of the lattice-work and in the number of radial\r\nbeams. The number of species here described amounts to one hundred and\r\nforty, and these are disposed in fourteen genera (twelve Sethophormida and\r\ntwo Sethophænida).\r\n\r\nThe Sethophormida may be again divided into two different groups or tribes,\r\nthe _Sethamphorida_ and _Carpocanida_; in the former the thorax bears\r\nnumerous radial ribs, enclosed in its wall; in the latter these ribs have\r\ndisappeared, and only a corona of terminal feet is developed around the\r\nmouth. The shell of the former is usually pyramidal, with a widely open\r\nmouth; of the latter ovate, with a constricted mouth. The mouth of the\r\nthorax becomes perfectly closed in the Sethophænida.\r\n\r\n{1242}The majority of the Anthocyrtida may be derived from the Polyspyrida\r\n(_Petalospyris_, &c.) by reduction of the cephalis and loss of the sagittal\r\nring, as was suggested by Bütschli (1882, _loc. cit._). But another part\r\nmay also have arisen from the Tripocyrtida, by interpolation of secondary\r\nradial apophyses between the three primary perradial apophyses. The\r\ncephalis in this family is developed in all possible degrees, from one of a\r\nconsiderable size to one very much reduced.

SETHOPHORMIDA, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 432.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Anthocyrtida# with the basal mouth of the shell open (vel\r\nDicyrtida multiradiata aperta).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 558. _Sethophormis_, Haeckel,[175] 1881, Prodromus, p. 432.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Sethophormida# (vel Dicyrtida multiradiata aperta) with\r\nnumerous radial ribs in the wall of the flat and broad campanulate or\r\nnearly discoidal thorax. Cephalis also flat and broad, cap-shaped without\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Sethophormis_ comprises a great number of widely distributed and\r\nlarge Dicyrtida, all agreeing in the flat cap-shaped or nearly discoidal\r\nform of the thorax, which has constantly a very delicate network, and is\r\npierced by numerous radial beams. Four of these are commonly primary and\r\ndirect prolongations of the four cortinar rods in the collar septum, whilst\r\nthe others are secondary or interpolated ribs. _Sethophormis_ may be\r\nderived either from the triradial _Lamprodiscus_ by multiplication of the\r\nribs (or interpolation of secondary ribs between the three primary), or\r\nfrom _Halicalyptra_ by development of transverse rods connecting its\r\nterminal feet, and forming a ribbed thorax. Corresponding to the number of\r\nthe ribs, we may distinguish as subgenera (separate genera in my Prodromus,\r\n1881, p. 432) _Tetraphormis_ with four, _Pentaphormis_ with five,\r\n_Hexaphormis_ with six, _Octophormis_ with eight, _Enneaphormis_ with nine,\r\nand _Astrophormis_ with ten to twenty or more ribs. The cephalis bears no\r\nhorn, and is usually large, flat, cap-shaped or hemispherical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Tetraphormis_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 432.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Thorax with four radial ribs opposite in pairs in two\r\nmeridional planes, perpendicular to one another.

Thorax flatly campanulate, with delicate, regular\r\nnetwork of small hexagonal meshes. All bars very thin, thread-like. Four\r\nstout radial thoracic ribs, crossed in pairs, lie in two meridional planes,\r\nperpendicular to one another. Very similar to _Sethophormis aurelia_ (Pl.\r\n55, figs. 3, 4), but not so flat, and with only four thoracic ribs.\r\nPeristome or margin of the thoracic mouth smooth, circular.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.04 long, 0.08 broad; thorax 0.12 long, 0.36\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1244}2. _Sethophormis medusa_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCephalis very large, flat, cap-shaped, with irregular, delicate network of\r\npolygonal meshes.

(Pl. 56, fig. 5).\r\n\r\nCephalis large, flat, hemispherical, with subregular, hexagonal pores.\r\nThorax flat, campanulate, nearly hemispherical; also with subregular,\r\nhexagonal pores, and with five stout ribs. The three primary ribs of the\r\nthorax are complete, and reach the peristome; the two secondary ribs (as\r\nbasal branches of the two lateral ribs) are incomplete and absent in the\r\ndistal half of the thorax. Peristome denticulate, with an elegant marginal\r\ncorona of small square pores and short conical spines.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.03 long, 0.06 broad; thorax 0.1 long, 0.2 broad.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Sethophormis asteriscus_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCephalis large, flat, cap-shaped, with irregular polygonal pores.

Thorax\r\nflatly campanulate, with subregular, hexagonal pores, and six stout radial\r\nribs; the lateral connected in pairs. (Fig. 6 exhibits the central part of\r\nthe shell, seen from below.) In the subcircular collar septum the two\r\nanterior (jugular) meshes are much smaller than the two posterior\r\n(cardinal) meshes. The odd anterior (sternal) rib is opposite to the\r\nposterior (caudal) rib. The two paired ribs of each side (antero-lateral or\r\npectoral and  postero-lateral or ventral ribs) diverge from one common\r\npoint. In the specimen figured the left half of the thorax exhibited the\r\ntwo regular ribs, and the right half three, a posterior accessory branch\r\nbeing developed (transition to _Octophormis_). This specimen might indeed\r\nbe called _Heptaphormis heptalactis_.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.02 long, 0.05 broad; thorax 0.08 long, 0.22\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, depth 2750 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Sethophormis hexagonalis_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCephalis small, flat, cap-shaped, with small, regular, hexagonal pores.\r\nThorax flatly conical, nearly discoidal, with larger pores of the same\r\nform, and six stout, straight, prominent ribs.

(Pl. 57, fig. 9).\r\n\r\n  _Enneaphormis rotula_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus et Atlas, pl. lvii. fig.\r\n  9.\r\n\r\nCephalis very large, flat, cap-shaped, trilobed, with irregular, polygonal\r\nnetwork. Horizontal collar-ring stout, hexagonal, with three larger and\r\nthree alternate smaller sides of half the length. From the middle of the\r\nthree larger sides arise three horizontal, centripetal, radial beams, which\r\nare united in the centre of the collar-septum--the three primary cortinar\r\nbeams. These are prolonged outside into three centrifugal primary ribs of\r\nthe thorax. From the six corners of the collar-ring arise six other\r\nsecondary, thoracic ribs, equal in size and similar in form to the three\r\nprimary. Each of these nine equal, straight ribs of the thorax is thickened\r\ntowards the distal end, and bears at equal distances five pairs of opposite\r\n(tangential) lateral branches. The opposite branches of the neighbouring\r\nspines become united, and lie nearly horizontally in one plane, so that the\r\nflat, discoidal thorax is like a nine-angled wheel with nine equally\r\ndistant spokes and five concentric, nine-angled rings.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.12 diameter, thorax 0.36 diameter.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Stations 270 to 274, depth 2350 to 2925\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Sethophormis triloba_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCephalis large, hemispherical, distinctly trilobed, with dense, irregular,\r\npolygonal network. From the centre of its top diverge three stout arches or\r\nsemilunar rods, which are curved downwards, and unite with the three\r\nhorizontal, radial beams of the collar-septum inside the collar-ring. These\r\nthree parietal arches of the cephalis are much stronger than in the similar\r\npreceding species (Pl. 57, fig. 9), and between them are placed three\r\nvaulted bosoms of the cephalis. The collar-ring and the thorax are of the\r\nsame form as in the preceding, but possess only four concentric,\r\nnine-angled rings.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.05 long, 0.08 broad; thorax 0.24 diameter.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, depth 2900 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Sethophormis enneastrum_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCephalis very large, flat, cap-shaped, with hexagonal base, trilobed, of\r\nsimilar form and structure to the two preceding species. The flat,\r\ndiscoidal thorax has also the same form, with nine stout ribs and five\r\nconcentric, nine-angled rings; its forty-five large meshes, however, are\r\nnot so simple {1247}as these (Pl. 57, fig. 9), but are subdivided into\r\nirregular, smaller meshes by interpolated radial beams connecting the\r\nconcentric rings.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.1 diameter, thorax 0.3 diameter.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, depth 3125 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Sethophormis arachnium_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCephalis very large, flat, cap-shaped, trilobed, with hexagonal base, of\r\nthe same structure as in the three preceding species. The flat discoidal\r\nthorax is also similar, and has the same structure as in the preceding\r\nspecies (Pl. 57, fig. 9); but the number of concentric, nine-angled rings\r\nis raised from five to eight, and in its outer part nine secondary radial\r\nbeams are interpolated between the nine primaries, so that the peristome\r\nhas not nine but eighteen corners.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.08 diameter, thorax 0.4 diameter.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Sethophormis enneactis_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCephalis small, hemispherical, with small, irregular, polygonal pores.\r\nThorax flatly pyramidal, nearly discoidal, with nine prominent, stout ribs,\r\nwhich are connected by numerous (twelve to sixteen) horizontal, nine-angled\r\nrings. In the outer half of the thorax there are nine weaker secondary ribs\r\ninterpolated between the nine stronger primaries, and eighteen shorter and\r\nfeebler tertiary ribs between the former and the latter.

Thorax flatly\r\npyramidal, with nine concave, triangular faces and nine little curved,\r\nstout, radial beams. Between these are interpolated numerous incomplete\r\nsecondary beams, which are absent in the apical part of the thorax. The\r\nradial beams being connected by numerous (thirty to forty or more)\r\nhorizontal, ring-like threads, a delicate arachnoidal network with small,\r\nquadrangular pores is produced. Peristome nine-angled, with a peculiar\r\nvertical gallery, composed of four horizontal, parallel, nine-angled rings,\r\nwhich are connected by numerous vertical, parallel bars, therefore with\r\nthree transverse rows of square pores. This peculiar species is very\r\ndifferent from the preceding and may represent a separate genus,\r\n_Craspedilium_.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Cephalis 0.01 diameter, thorax 0.1 long, 0.25 broad.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1248}Subgenus 6. _Astrophormis_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Thorax with a variable number of radial ribs (twelve to\r\ntwenty or more).\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _Sethophormis aurelia_, n. sp. (Pl. 55, figs. 3, 4).\r\n\r\n  _Leptarachnium aurelia_, Haeckel, 1879, Manuscript et Atlas.\r\n\r\nCephalis large, nearly hemispherical, with irregular, delicate network of\r\nsmall square meshes. Collar-septum with four large meshes, separated by a\r\ncross of four bars, opposite in pairs. Thorax flatly campanulate, with\r\ndelicate, subregular, hexagonal meshes, and twenty-four prominent radial\r\nribs; four of these are primary or perradial (centrifugal prolongations of\r\nthe four bars of the collar-septum); four others are interradial or\r\nsecondary, alternating with the former at angles of 45°; sixteen others are\r\nadradial or tertiary, interpolated between the first and second more or\r\nless irregularly. In some specimens the disposition of the twenty-four ribs\r\nwas more regular, in others more irregular, than in the specimen figured\r\n(figs. 3, 4). The central capsule (fig. 4) exhibits a flat, cap-shaped part\r\nwith the nucleus (enclosed in the cephalis), and four large, pear-shaped\r\nlobes protruded through the four large collar holes (somewhat deformed in\r\nthe preparation figured). The wall of the thorax exhibits at the base four\r\nlarger, nearly semicircular pores, bisected by the four primary thoracic\r\nribs.

Each of these eight main ribs gives off two more or less irregular,\r\nlateral branches (one at each side), altogether sixteen. The thorax is\r\nsimilar to _Cladarachnium ramosum_ (Pl. 55, fig. 5), whilst the cephalis is\r\nquite different.

Cephalis hidden in the thorax, without apical horn.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Carpocanium_, very common, and rich in numerous living and\r\nfossil species, was formerly placed by me among the true Monocyrtida, since\r\nan external constriction is not visible (Monogr., 1862, p. 290). Afterwards\r\n(in 1879) Richard Hertwig demonstrated that the cavity of the ovate shell,\r\nexternally simple, is divided by an internal transverse septum into two\r\njoints, the upper of which is the flat rudimentary cephalis (Organism. d.\r\nRadiol., p. 79; compare also Bütschli, 1882, _loc. cit._, p. 535). Indeed\r\nthis septum, with four central crossed cortinar beams, is a true collar\r\nseptum, and _Carpocanium_ has been derived from _Anthocyrtis_ or\r\n_Desmospyris_ by reduction of the cephalis, which is very flat and\r\nperfectly hidden in the uppermost part of the thorax. The apical horn is\r\nlost. If the internal septum were to become lost, the genus would pass over\r\ninto _Carpocanistrum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Carpocanarium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Peristome-corona composed of six feet (three primary\r\nperradial alternating with three secondary interradial).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Carpocanium calycodes_, Stöhr.\r\n\r\n  _Carpocanium calycodes_, Stöhr, 1880, Palæontogr., vol. xxvi. p. 96, Taf.\r\n  iii. fig. 8.\r\n\r\nShell urceolate, smooth, nearly twice as long as broad, with hemispherical\r\nvaulted cephalis.

(#Cyrtoidea# with a two-jointed shell,\r\ndivided by a transverse constriction into cephalis and thorax, without\r\nradial apophyses).\r\n\r\nThe family #Sethocyrtida#, composed of the Sethocorida and Sethocapsida of\r\nmy Prodromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the shell is two-jointed\r\nand bears no radial apophyses. The two subfamilies differ in the shape of\r\nthe mouth, which in the Sethocorida is a simple wide opening, and in the\r\nSethocapsida is closed by a lattice-plate. The former are here divided into\r\neight, the latter into three genera.\r\n\r\n{1289}Numerous living and fossil forms of Sethocyrtida were previously\r\ndescribed by Ehrenberg, partly in his genera _Dictyocephalus_ and\r\n_Lophophæna_, partly (intermingled with three-jointed and many-jointed\r\nforms) in the genera _Eucyrtidium_ and _Lithocampe_. A larger number of new\r\nforms has been found in the Radiolarian ooze collected by the Challenger,\r\nand others fossil in Barbados. Many of these Sethocyrtida are common and\r\nwidely distributed. When a new third joint is formed on their basal mouth,\r\nthey pass over into Theocyrtida.\r\n\r\nThe cephalis is usually subspherical or hemispherical, and much smaller\r\nthan the thorax, the form of which exhibits all possible intermediate\r\nstages between flat, discoidal, conical, cylindrical, and ovate forms. The\r\nwide open mouth becomes more and more constricted, and finally closed in\r\nthe Sethocapsida. The majority of the Sethocyrtida may have been derived\r\neither from the Tripocyrtida, or from the Anthocyrtida by reduction and\r\nloss of the radial apophyses.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Sethocyrtida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Probably all those\r\neradiate Sethocorida have been derived either from triradiate Sethopilida\r\n(_Lychnocanium_), or from multiradiate Sethophormida (_Sethophormis_,\r\n_Anthocyrtis_ ?) by loss of the radial ribs and feet. In _Sethoconus_ the\r\nthorax is more or less conical, sometimes more campanulate, commonly\r\nsmooth, in some species covered with spines. The cephalis is usually small,\r\nwith rudimentary collar septum, at other times large, with distinct\r\ncortinar septum.

It is possible that this peculiar genus has\r\nbeen derived from a Tricyrtid (_Theocalyptra_?) by loss of the original\r\ncephalis, and that the apparent large cephalis is the original thorax.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Sethocephalus eucecryphalus_, n. sp.

(Pl. 67, 68, 71-73).\r\n\r\n  _Theopilida et Theoperida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 435, 436.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Tricyrtida# triradiata. (#Cyrtoidea# with a three-jointed\r\nshell, divided by two transverse constrictions into cephalis, thorax, and\r\nabdomen, and bearing three radial apophyses.)\r\n\r\nThe family #Podocyrtida#, composed of the Theopilida and Theoperida of my\r\nProdromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the lattice-shell is\r\nthree-jointed and triradial, bearing three external apophyses. The two\r\nsubfamilies differ in the shape of the basal mouth, which in the Theopilida\r\nis a simple wide opening, in the Theoperida closed by a lattice-plate. The\r\nlatter are derived from the former by development of this closing plate.\r\nThe phylogenetic origin of the Podocyrtida may be found in the\r\nTripocyrtida, from which they are derived by development of an abdomen. But\r\nthere are also some forms, which may be derived directly from the\r\n#Plectoidea#, and the origin of some other forms seems to be doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe Podocyrtida represent one of the largest groups of #Cyrtoidea#, very\r\nrich in numerous species, which are partly very common and widely\r\ndistributed. A large number of living and fossil species has already been\r\ndescribed and figured by Ehrenberg, (1872, 1879, _loc. cit._). These mainly\r\nbelong to his genera _Podocyrtis_, _Pterocanium_, _Rhopalocanium_,\r\n_Lithornithium_, &c., and many of them are very characteristic and common\r\nforms, in which the triradial structure of the three-jointed shell is\r\nvisible at first view. We distinguish here twenty genera and one hundred\r\nand fifty species. The majority have a shell with a simple wide open mouth\r\n(Theopilida, fourteen genera and one hundred and eighteen species), in the\r\nminority the mouth is closed by lattice-work (Theoperida, six genera and\r\nthirty-two species).\r\n\r\nThe three joints of the shell have in the majority of Podocyrtida such a\r\nproportion that the cephalis is the smallest, the abdomen the largest, and\r\nthe thorax between them intermediate in size. The cephalis bears almost\r\nconstantly an apical horn; this is rarely reduced or lost; sometimes two or\r\nmore horns are developed. The three radial apophyses arise originally from\r\nthe base of the cephalis, and may from this point run along the shell-wall\r\nembedded in the lattice-plate of the thorax and the abdomen. They leave the\r\nlatter at very different points, and form either lateral wings or terminal\r\nfeet, sometimes both together. They are either solid or latticed, sometimes\r\nalso branched, and of very various shape. Often only the three terminal\r\nfeet surrounding the mouth have remained, whilst the ribs have disappeared.\r\n\r\nMany species of this large family are very variable and connected with\r\nother different species by numerous transitional forms; the distinction of\r\nthe genera described is also often very difficult.\r\n\r\n{1315}_Synopsis of the Genera of Podocyrtida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

It exhibits three free lateral\r\nwings, arising from the sides of the thorax, like _Lithomelissa_ among the\r\nDicyrtida, and may be derived directly from this genus by development of an\r\nabdomen. The latter is commonly cylindrical or ovate, with a wide open\r\nmouth, whilst the thorax is either campanulate or three-sided and\r\npyramidal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Pterocyrtidium_, Bütschli, 1882, Zeitschr. f. wiss.

Apex with a horn, which usually is simple.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Podocyrtis_, and the two following closely allied genera, differ\r\nfrom all the preceding Theopilida in the absence of lateral ribs or wings,\r\nand the possession of three free terminal feet, which arise directly from\r\nthe peristome, or from the margin of the abdominal mouth. They may be\r\nderived from _Pleuropodium_ by reduction and loss of the three piercing\r\nlateral ribs, the terminal free prolongations of which only remain. The\r\ngenus _Podocyrtis_ is one of the largest and most common among all\r\n#Cyrtoidea#, being rich mainly in fossil forms. Ehrenberg in his\r\nPolycystins of Barbados (1875, _loc. cit._, p. 80) enumerated not less than\r\nthirty-one species. Some of these are yet living, and occur in the Pacific\r\nRadiolarian ooze collected by the Challenger. Other new forms are to be\r\nadded, so that the number of species described in the following pages\r\namounts to forty-five. Many of these are cosmopolitan, or at least common\r\nand widely distributed. To facilitate study we may divide this large genus\r\ninto four subgenera: in two of these the terminal feet are divergent, or\r\nnearly parallel; in the two others convergent. In each of these two groups\r\nthe pores of the thorax and the abdomen are either nearly equal in size and\r\nform, or distinctly different, the abdominal pores being often much larger\r\nthan the thoracic.

(#Cyrtoidea# with a three-jointed\r\nshell, divided by two transverse constrictions into cephalis, thorax, and\r\nabdomen, with numerous, four to nine or more, radial apophyses.)\r\n\r\nThe family #Phormocyrtida#, composed of the Theophormida and Theophænida of\r\nmy Prodromus, comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the lattice-shell is\r\nthree-jointed, and bears numerous radial appendages (usually six or nine,\r\nsometimes more, rarely less, four or five). The two subfamilies differ in\r\nthe shape of the terminal mouth, which is in the Theophormida a simple wide\r\nopening, in the Theophænida closed by a lattice-plate. The phylogenetic\r\norigin of the Phormocyrtida may be found either in the Podocyrtida or in\r\nthe Anthocyrtida; they may be derived either from the former by\r\ninterpolation of interradial, secondary apophyses between the three primary\r\nperradial apophyses; or from the latter by development of an abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe radial apophyses are originally radial ribs, which arise from the base\r\nof the cephalis on the collar stricture, run along the thorax and abdomen,\r\nand are often prolonged into terminal feet. Whilst in some forms the radial\r\nribs are completely preserved in both joints, they are in other forms only\r\npartly visible (in the abdomen), and very often only their free terminal\r\nprolongations are preserved in the form of a corona of feet around the\r\nmouth of the thorax. This corona is either simple or double. Sometimes also\r\na corona is developed on the lumbar stricture, between the thorax and\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n{1366}These apophyses exhibit a remarkable variety in the great subfamily\r\nTheophormida, with open mouth. In the small subfamily Theophænida, however,\r\nthe apophyses appear as six or nine simple lateral wings on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe Theophormida are richly represented not only in the present seas, but\r\nalso as fossils in Barbados, and numerous remarkable forms have been\r\nalready described by Ehrenberg, in his genera _Calocyclas_ and\r\n_Cycladophora_.

The\r\nthree-jointed shell is flat, campanulate or hat-shaped, and pierced by four\r\nor more radial ribs, four of which are primary or perradial, the others\r\nsecondary or interradial. _Theophormis_ may be derived from the similar\r\n_Sethophormis_ by development of a lumbar constriction, and a third joint\r\nor abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Theophormis callipilium_, n. sp. (Pl. 70, figs. 1-3).\r\n\r\nShell flat, hat-shaped, with two sharp annular strictures. Cephalis large,\r\nflatly cap-shaped, with small, irregular, square meshes (fig. 3). The\r\ncollar septum (fig. 2) is composed (as in the following species) of four\r\ncrossed, thin, horizontal beams, each of which is inserted at the collar\r\nstricture by a three forked branch. From the centre of the collar stricture\r\n(in the common nodal point of the four beams) there arises a vertical,\r\naxial rod, which is inserted at the flat top of the cephalis by five\r\nbranches (one central and four lateral). Length of the three joints =\r\n1 : 3 : 2, breadth = 2 : 6 : 11. Thorax flat, campanulate, with four\r\nprimary perradial ribs (prolongations of the four cortinar beams), and\r\nnumerous (twenty to thirty) interpolated secondary ribs; four of these are\r\nin interradial (midway between the four primary ribs), and bisect the four\r\nlarge, semicircular, perradial meshes at the base of the thorax. Network of\r\nthe thorax and abdomen subregular, with hexagonal meshes and thin bars.\r\nAbdomen flatly expanded, somewhat curved, like the brim of a hat, half as\r\nbroad in the anterior (frontal) part as in the posterior (occipital) part,\r\nwhich is about as broad as the radius of the thorax. The twenty to thirty\r\nradial ribs of the abdomen are prolongations of the thoracic ribs, and are\r\nsomewhat prominent at the margin of the peristome, which appears therefore\r\nelegantly indented.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the three joints, _a_ 0.02 to 0.03, _b_ 0.06 to\r\n0.08, _c_ 0.03 to 0.06; breadth, _a_ 0.05 to 0.08, _b_ 0.2 to 0.3, _c_ 0.4\r\nto 0.5.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Theophormis medusa_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell flatly campanulate, with two distinct, annular strictures. Length of\r\nthe three joints = 1 : 2 : 1, breadth = 2 : 5 : 8. Cephalis large,\r\nhemispherical. Thorax flatly conical, with four crossed ribs, opposite in\r\npairs in two meridional planes, perpendicular one to another, and prolonged\r\ninto the flat, nearly discoidal abdomen, which is half as broad as the\r\nthorax. The wall of the abdomen is pierced by eight radial ribs; four\r\nsecondary ribs being interpolated between the four primary. Network of the\r\nentire shell very delicate, with regular, hexagonal meshes, and very thin\r\nbars. Peristome circular, not dentate.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the three joints, _a_ 0.03, _b_ 0.07, _c_ 0.04;\r\nbreadth, _a_ 0.06, _b_ 0.16, _c_ 0.24.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Theophormis cruciata_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell flat, campanulate, with two distinct annular strictures. Cephalis\r\nflat, cap-shaped, with irregular, square meshes. Thorax flat, conical, with\r\nhexagonal meshes. Abdomen flatly expanded, {1368}of half the breadth, with\r\nlarger hexagonal meshes. Thorax and abdomen pierced by four stout radial\r\nribs, lying opposite in pairs in two diameters, perpendicular one to\r\nanother. No secondary or interradial ribs are interpolated between the four\r\nprimary. Mouth truncate, circular.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the three joints, _a_ 0.02, _b_ 0.08, _c_ 0.04;\r\nbreadth, _a_ 0.05, _b_ 0.18, _c_ 0.25.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Theophormis senaria_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell flat, hat-shaped, similar to _Theophormis callipilium_ (Pl. 70, figs.\r\n1-3), but with a different number and arrangement of the piercing radial\r\nribs. The cephalis and its collar septum exhibit the same formation as in\r\n_Sethophormis hexalactis_, described above (p. 1245, Pl. 56, fig. 6.) The\r\ncaudal and sternal ribs, which are opposed in the sagittal plane, are\r\nsimple, whilst the two lateral ribs are forked. In the flat abdomen there\r\nare six secondary or interradial ribs, interpolated between the six primary\r\nor perradial ribs of the thorax. Delicate network with regular, hexagonal\r\nmeshes.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the three joints, _a_ 0.035, _b_ 0.075, _c_ 0.025;\r\nbreadth, _a_ 0.07, _b_ 0.2, _c_ 0.3.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 602. _Phormocyrtis_,[219] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Theophormida# (vel Tricyrtida multiradiata aperta) with\r\nnumerous radial ribs enclosed in the wall of the thorax, and of the ovate\r\nor cylindrical abdomen; mouth of the latter constricted.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Phormocyrtis_ differs from the preceding _Theophormis_ in the\r\novate or cylindrical form of the abdomen, the mouth of which is more or\r\nless constricted. The former exhibits, therefore, the same relation to the\r\nlatter that _Sethamphora_ bears to _Sethophormis_ among the Dicyrtida.\r\n_Phormocyrtis_ may be derived directly either from _Sethamphora_ by\r\ndevelopment of an abdomen, or from _Pterocorys_ or _Theopilium_ by\r\nmultiplication of the three radial ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Phormocyrtis carinata_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell ovate, with two slight strictures. Length of the three joints =\r\n1 : 2 : 3, breadth = 1 : 3 : 4. Cephalis hemispherical, with a stout\r\npyramidal horn of twice the length, and few very small pores. Pores in the\r\ncampanulate thorax and the inflated abdomen regular, circular, small, and\r\nnumerous. Six stout prominent ribs, beginning from the collar stricture,\r\narise along the thorax and abdomen, and reach the constricted mouth, which\r\nis half as broad as the abdomen. (This species is very similar to\r\n_Pterocorys carinata_, from which it differs in the six complete radial\r\nribs of the shell-wall.)\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the three joints, _a_ 0.03, _b_ 0.06, _c_ 0.09;\r\nbreadth, _a_ 0.03, _b_ 0.09, _c_ 0.12.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, Station 347, depth 2250 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1369}2. _Phormocyrtis fastosa_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Eucyrtidium fastosum_, Ehrenberg, 1872, Abhandl. d. k.

The shell is usually large, more or less pyramidal or conical,\r\nwith a wide open terminal mouth. The latter is in _Cycladophora_ simply\r\ntruncate, whilst in _Alacorys_ it is surrounded by from four to twelve or\r\nmore terminal feet, prolongations of the abdominal ribs.

Abdomen not\r\ndilated, cylindrical or ovate. No ribs in the shell-wall.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Calocyclas_, and the three following closely allied genera,\r\ndiffer from the four preceding genera of Theophormida in the absence of\r\nradial or longitudinal ribs in the wall of the thorax and abdomen. These\r\nare completely reduced, and their terminal prolongations only remain,\r\nforming a simple or double corona around the mouth of the abdomen. They\r\ncorrespond therefore to _Carpocanium_ and _Anthocyrtis_ among the\r\nDicyrtida. In _Calocyclas_ the corona is simple. The mouth is not dilated,\r\nbut often constricted, and the abdomen is cylindrical or ovate, not\r\nconical.

The two subfamilies\r\ndiffer in the shape of the terminal mouth, which in the Theocorida is a\r\nsimple wide opening, in the Theocapsida closed by a lattice-plate. The\r\nphylogenetic origin of the Theocyrtida may be found either in the\r\nPodocyrtida or in the Sethocyrtida; they may have been derived from the\r\nformer by reduction and loss of the three primary apophyses, or from the\r\nlatter by development of an abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe number of species in this group is very large, and many belong to the\r\nmost common and widely distributed #Cyrtoidea#. A great number of living\r\nand fossil species have already been described by Ehrenberg, the majority\r\nbeing disposed in his genera _Lithocampe_ and _Eucyrtidium_.\r\n\r\nThe number of genera, however, is comparatively small, and their\r\ndistinction difficult, since the form of the shell presents no striking\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n{1396}It exhibits all possible passages, from a flatly expanded or nearly\r\ndiscoidal form with a wide open mouth, to a conical or cylindrical, and by\r\nconstriction of the terminal mouth to an ovate or spindle-shaped form. By\r\ncomplete closure of the mouth the Theocapsida arise. In some genera\r\nremarkable traces of the original triradial structure are preserved. The\r\nmost interesting of these forms is _Axocorys_, with an internal axial\r\ncolumella, which bears a number of verticils, each with three radial\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Theocyrtida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

(#Cyrtoidea# with an annulated\r\nshell, divided by three or more transverse constrictions into four or more\r\nannular joints, and bearing three radial apophyses).\r\n\r\nThe family #Podocampida# comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the\r\nlattice-shell is composed of numerous (four to eight or more) annular\r\njoints, and bears three external radial apophyses. It may be divided into\r\ntwo subfamilies, differing in the shape of the terminal mouth. This is a\r\nsimple wide opening in the Stichopilida (and the united Artopilida), closed\r\nby a lattice-plate in the Stichoperida (and the united Artoperida). The\r\nphylogenetic origin of the Podocampida may be found in the Podocyrtida (p.\r\n1314).\r\n\r\nVery few forms only of the Podocampida were hitherto known, viz.,\r\n_Stichopilium_ (_Pterocodon_) _davisianum_, and three fossil species from\r\nBarbados, figured by Ehrenberg; _Artopera loxia_ (united by him with\r\n_Lithornithium_), and two species of _Pteropilium_ (_sphinx_ and _bombus_,\r\nboth united by him with the three-jointed _Pterocanium_). In general, the\r\ntriradiate Stichocyrtida are much rarer and much poorer in specific forms\r\nthan the triradiate Tricyrtida, their ancestors. We have observed\r\naltogether only forty-four species, thirty Stichopilida, and fourteen\r\nStichoperida; the former are disposed among seven, the latter among three\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nThe three radial apophyses appear either as lateral ribs or prominent wings\r\nin the thorax (Pl. 77, fig. 8-12), or as three terminal feet around the\r\nmouth (Pl. 97, fig. 15). Sometimes the ribs are replaced by three radial\r\ncombs, or rows of spines, and these may be united by three divergent beams,\r\nforming three vaulted bridges with numerous bows (Pl. 75, figs. 10, 11).\r\nThe lateral wings or ribs, as well as the terminal feet, are either solid\r\nor fenestrated.\r\n\r\n{1436}_Synopsis of the Genera of Podocampida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

(#Cyrtoidea# with an annulated\r\nshell, divided by three or more transverse constrictions into four or more\r\nannular joints, with numerous, four to nine or more, radial apophyses.)\r\n\r\nThe family #Phormocampida# comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the\r\nlattice-shell is composed of numerous (four to eight or more) annular\r\njoints, and bears numerous (four to eight or more) radial apophyses. We\r\ndivide it into two subfamilies, differing in the shape of the terminal\r\nmouth. This is a simple wide opening in the Stichophormida (and the united\r\nArtophormida), closed by a lattice-plate in the Stichophænida (and the\r\nunited Artophænida). The phylogenetic origin of the Phormocampida may be\r\nfound in the Phormocyrtida.\r\n\r\nThree fossil forms only of Phormocampida were hitherto known, two of which\r\nwere described by Stöhr as _Eucyrtidium acutatum_ and _Lithocampe\r\nfimbriata_, the third by Ehrenberg as _Eucyrtidium barbadense_; the latter\r\nbelongs to _Artophormis_, the two former to _Cyrtophormis_. All the other\r\nPhormocampida here described, forming together thirty-one species, are new;\r\ntwenty-two of them belong to the Stichophormida, and nine to the\r\nStichophænida. The latter are disposed in two, the former in four genera.\r\n\r\nThe number of the radial apophyses is sometimes six or nine, sometimes\r\ntwelve or more, usually a multiple of three. They are either lateral ribs\r\nor wings (Pl. 75, figs. 2, 5, 12), or terminal feet (Pl. 77, figs. 13 to\r\n18). Usually they are solid, not latticed, and not strongly developed. The\r\nmajority of Phormocampida have probably been derived from Phormocyrtida by\r\ngrowth of the abdomen, which becomes annulated by transverse constrictions.\r\nSome forms, however, may be derived from similar Podocampida, by\r\ninterpolation of three to six or more secondary apophyses between the three\r\nprimary or perradial apophyses.\r\n\r\n{1454}_Synopsis of the Genera of Phormocampida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

(#Cyrtoidea# with an annulated\r\nshell, divided by three or more transverse constrictions into four or more\r\nannular joints, without radial apophyses.)\r\n\r\nThe family #Lithocampida# comprises those #Cyrtoidea# in which the\r\nlattice-shell is composed of numerous (four to eight or more) annular\r\njoints, and bears no radial apophyses. It may be divided into two\r\nsubfamilies, differing in the shape of the terminal mouth. This is a simple\r\nwide opening in the Stichocorida (and the united Artocorida), closed by a\r\nlattice-plate in the Stichocapsida (and the allied Artocapsida). The\r\nphylogenetic origin of the Lithocampida may be found in the Theocyrtida.\r\n\r\nThe number of species of Lithocampida is very great, and amounts here to\r\nmore than one hundred and sixty whilst the total number of Stichocyrtida is\r\nabout two hundred and forty. They represent therefore, two-thirds of the\r\nwhole group, whilst one third is composed of the Podocampida and\r\nPhormocampida. Ehrenberg has already described between forty and fifty\r\nspecies in his genera _Eucyrtidium_ and _Lithocampe_; the majority of these\r\nwere fossils from Barbados.\r\n\r\nThis large number of species may be easily increased by accurate researches\r\non the great masses of Lithocampida, which are found in the Radiolarian\r\nooze of the Challenger, and as fossils in Barbados. The variety in the\r\nnumber, size, and proportion of the shell-joints and of the lattice-pores\r\nis very great, and permits us to distinguish a far greater number of\r\nspecies than are here described. Many species are cosmopolitan, and belong\r\nto the most common forms of Radiolaria.\r\n\r\nThis large number of species requires to be disposed in different genera,\r\nbut the distinction of these latter is a rather difficult task, since the\r\nexterior of the shell, as well as its internal structure, offers no\r\nstriking differences (compare Pls. 78 to 80). In my Monograph (1862, pp.\r\n312 to 319) I have already pointed out the difficulty of distinguishing\r\nbetween _Lithocampe_ and _Eucyrtidium_. The general form of the shell\r\nexhibits a continuous series of transformations, from a flat, conical, or\r\nnearly discoidal form, through cylindrical to ovate, or spindle-shaped\r\nshells, the wide open terminal mouth becoming more or less constricted, and\r\nfinally (in the Stichocapsida) closed. The absence or presence of an apical\r\nhorn may further serve for the distinction of genera. A peculiar small\r\ngroup is represented by the Spirocampida (_Spirocyrtis_, _Spirocampe_, Pl.\r\n76, figs. 11 to 17), the transverse latticed girdles separating the single\r\njoints, which are usually parallel and horizontal, becoming here partly\r\nconnected, so that they form a descending spiral.\r\n\r\n{1468}_Synopsis of the Genera of Lithocampida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Cephalis with a solid horn.\r\n\r\n{1488}The genus _Eucyrtidium_ (as here stated in the definition) and the\r\nthree following nearly allied genera differ from the preceding Stichocorida\r\nin the more or less constricted mouth, and the consequent ovate or\r\nspindle-form of the multiarticulate shell. The middle joints of the latter\r\nare broader than the upper and the lower joints. In the earlier definition\r\ngiven in my Monograph (1862, pp. 312 to 320), the genus had a much wider\r\nsense; but the very large number of species since detected requires a more\r\nstrict definition. Ehrenberg confounded in his genus _Eucyrtidium_ a large\r\nnumber of very different #Cyrtoidea#. In his last works (1872, 1875) he\r\ndescribed not less than one hundred and eleven species, fifty-five fossil\r\nand fifty-six living (eight fossil species being yet living). But, in\r\nreality, these one hundred and three species belong to twenty or twenty-two\r\nvery different genera of #Cyrtoidea#.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Eucyrtis_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 438.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--All joints of the shell nearly of the same length (excepting\r\noften the first).

Afterwards\r\nnumerous other species, which belong to very different genera, were\r\ndescribed by him. In 1862 I attempted to give a more strict definition of\r\nthis genus in my Monograph (p. 312 to 315), and separated it from the\r\nclosely allied and often confounded _Eucyrtidium_ by the absence of a\r\ncephalic horn.

PHÆODARIA,\r\n\r\nVEL CANNOPYLEA, VEL PANSOLENIA (PLS. 99-128).\r\n\r\n  _Phæodaria_, Haeckel, 1879.\r\n  _Tripylea_, Hertwig, 1879.\r\n  _Cannopylea_, Haeckel, 1881.\r\n  _Pansolenia_, Haeckel, 1878.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Radiolaria with a double membrane surrounding the central\r\ncapsule, which bears on one pole of the main axis a peculiar astropyle, or\r\na tubular main-opening, in the centre of a circular radiate operculum.\r\nUsually (but not constantly) a pair of small, lateral, accessory openings\r\n(or parapylæ) on the opposite pole of the main axis. Extracapsulum\r\nconstantly with a phæodium, or with a voluminous aggregation of peculiar\r\ndark pigment bodies (phæodella) covering the astropyle of the central\r\ncapsule. Skeleton siliceous or silicated, always extracapsular, very rarely\r\nwanting. Fundamental form very variable, originally monaxon, often\r\ndipleuric or bilateral.\r\n\r\nThe legion PHÆODARIA, or CANNOPYLEA, in the extent here defined, was\r\nconstituted by me in 1878, in my Protistenreich (p. 102) under the name\r\nPANSOLENIA. This name was given on the supposition that the skeleton of\r\nthese interesting Radiolaria is always composed of hollow tubules, in\r\ncontrast to that of the other Radiolaria, where it is never tubular. But I\r\nwas soon convinced that this supposition was erroneous, that in a great\r\npart of the PANSOLENIA the skeleton is not composed of hollow tubules but\r\nof solid bars, and that a constant, very characteristic, and never failing\r\nmark of this group is to be found in the peculiar phæodium, a voluminous,\r\nconstant, extracapsular pigment body. Therefore, in 1879, I changed the\r\nname into PHÆODARIA, and having discovered in the collection of the\r\nChallenger an astonishing number of new and wonderful types of this group,\r\nI described, in a preliminary note on it, four different orders and ten\r\nfamilies with thirty-eight genera (Ueber die Phæodarien, eine neue Gruppe\r\nkieselschaliger mariner Rhizopoden; in Sitzungsberichte der Jenaischen\r\nGesellschaft für Medicin und Naturwissenschaft. Sitzung vom 12th December\r\n1879).\r\n\r\nIn the same year (1879), Richard Hertwig, in his excellent work entitled\r\nDer Organismus der Radiolarien, published the first accurate description of\r\nthe intimate structure of the soft body of the PANSOLENIA, and mainly of\r\ntheir central capsule; and having always observed, in the few\r\nrepresentatives examined by him, three openings in the capsule (one\r\nmain-opening and two accessory openings), he called them TRIPYLEA (_loc.\r\ncit._ p. 87), being guided by the erroneous supposition that these three\r\nopenings are {1522}constant in all members of the group. But this is by no\r\nmeans the case. The two accessory openings are completely absent in several\r\nfamilies, whilst in others their number is increased. A constant and very\r\nstriking character, however, of all PHÆODARIA, is the peculiar structure of\r\ntheir tubular main-opening, which I call astropyle, with its radiate\r\noperculum and cannular proboscis. On account of this important and\r\nstartling characteristic I proposed in 1881 to call this group CANNOPYLEA.\r\nThe two names PHÆODARIA and CANNOPYLEA both express a very striking and\r\nquite constant character of these curious Radiolaria, whilst the two names\r\nPANSOLENIA and TRIPYLEA are applicable only to a part of the whole legion.\r\n\r\nThe history of our knowledge of the PHÆODARIA is short, but very\r\nremarkable. Although hundreds of species, many of them cosmopolitan, are\r\ndistributed over all oceans and all zones, although their size is in\r\ngeneral much greater than that of the other Radiolaria (usually 1 to 2 mm.,\r\noften even 5 to 10 mm. or more), and although their form and structure are\r\nusually striking, nevertheless the PHÆODARIA remained completely unknown up\r\nto the year 1859. During that year I observed the first forms living in the\r\nGulf of Messina, and described and figured in 1862 in my Monograph five\r\ngenera and seven species, viz., (1) _Aulacantha scolymantha_ (p. 263), (2)\r\n_Thalassoplancta cavispicula_ (p. 261, now _Cannobelos cavispicula_), (3)\r\n_Aulosphæra trigonopa_, and _Aulosphæra elegantissima_ (p. 359), (4)\r\n_Spongodictyum trigonizon_ (p. 459, now _Sagoplegma trigonizon_), and (5)\r\n_Coelodendrum ramosissimum_, and _Coelodendrum gracillimum_ (p. 361). I\r\nrecognised the structure of the three genera enumerated as 1, 3, and 5, as\r\nso remarkable and so different from that of the other Radiolaria, that I\r\nfounded three peculiar families for them, the Aulacanthida, Aulosphærida,\r\nand Coelodendrida.\r\n\r\nThe first note on the numerous remarkable PHÆODARIA discovered by the\r\nChallenger, and mainly on the large-sized inhabitants of the deep-sea, was\r\npublished in 1876 by Dr. John Murray, in his Preliminary Reports on Work\r\ndone on Board the Challenger (Proc. Roy. Soc., vol. xxiv., read March 16,\r\n1876). He pointed out (_loc. cit._, p. 535), that the tow-nets, sent down\r\nto a great depth (according to a new plan, adopted in April 1875) brought\r\nup on every occasion a great many new and peculiar Rhizopods, which had\r\nnever been observed in the nets used near the surface. \"The shells of all\r\nhave an exceedingly beautiful tracery, a fenestrated appearance often,\r\nwhich a closer examination shows to be caused by pit-like depressions. Some\r\nhave only one, others have several openings, through which the sarcode\r\nflows. The sarcode of all these deep-sea Rhizopods has many large\r\nblack-brown pigment-cells. At times they come up with a good deal of the\r\nsarcode outside of the shell; and two specimens have been seen to throw out\r\nelongated pseudopodia\" (_loc. cit._, p. 536). Dr. John Murray distinguished\r\nat that time not less than fifty species of these interesting deep-sea\r\nRhizopods and called them provisionally Challengerida; a term which we\r\nretain here for the largest and most characteristic family. He gave at the\r\nsame time, in an accompanying plate (xxiv.), six {1523}figures of new\r\nPHÆODARIA, the names of which (as found by me in 1879 in the corresponding\r\npreparations) are the following; (1) _Challengeria naresii_, (2)\r\n_Challengeria aldrichii_, (3) _Bivalva compressa_ (now = _Conchopsis\r\ncompressa_), (4) _Tuscarora belknapii_, (5) _Challengeria circopora_ (now =\r\n_Circoporus sexfurcus_), and (6) _Haeckeliana porcellana_. A great number\r\nof these Challengerida (twenty species) were afterwards figured by Dr. John\r\nMurray in the Narrative of the Cruise of H.M.S. Challenger, 1885, vol. i.\r\npart 1, p. 226, Pl. A; viz., fourteen species of _Challengeria_ and six\r\nspecies of _Tuscarora_.\r\n\r\nThe most important advance in the knowledge which we had of the peculiar\r\norganisation of the PHÆODARIA, was made by the accurate description which\r\nRichard Hertwig published, in 1879, of the intimate structure of their\r\ncentral capsule, and mainly of its peculiar openings. He examined living at\r\nMessina the following three forms, described in my Monograph; (1)\r\n_Aulacantha scolymantha_, (2) _Aulosphæra elegantissima_, and (3)\r\n_Coelodendrum ramosissimum_. Besides, he described an interesting new\r\ngenus, _Coelacantha anchorata_; and another new form, which he placed in\r\nthe Aulosphærida, as _Aulosphæra gracilis_, but which really was a new\r\ngenus of Sagosphærida, here described as _Sagoscena gracilis_. Finally,\r\nHertwig first discovered that the peculiar bodies, described by Ehrenberg\r\nas _Dictyocha_ and placed by him in the _Diatomea_ (_Polygastrica_), were\r\nthe isolated pieces of the skeleton of a true _Phæodarium_, and that they\r\nwere scattered loosely in great numbers over the surface of the\r\njelly-sphere, just as are the hollow spicula of _Thalassoplancta_ or\r\n_Cannobelos_.\r\n\r\nThe six species mentioned, of which Hertwig gave a very accurate\r\ndescription and very instructive figures, belong to six different genera,\r\nand these represent six different families of PHÆODARIA, viz.;\r\nAulacanthida, Aulosphærida, Coelodendrida, Cannosphærida, Sagosphærida and\r\nCannorrhaphida. He found that all these six forms, in spite of great\r\ndifferences in the form and structure of their skeleton, were identical in\r\nthe structure of the central capsule; and since he observed constantly\r\nthree openings in its double wall (a large main-opening on the oral pole,\r\nand a pair of lateral accessory openings on the aboral pole of its main\r\naxis) he called them TRIPYLEA (_loc. cit._, p. 87, 94). But he also pointed\r\nout the remarkable shape of their voluminous extracapsular body, and\r\nespecially the characteristic position, size, colour and composition of the\r\nlarge pigment body, which I had called the phæodium.\r\n\r\nThe accurate description of the gigantic and elegant skeleton of a new\r\n_Phæodarium_, surpassing all other known Radiolaria in its extraordinary\r\nsize (15 mm.), was published in 1882 by O. Bütschli (in Zeitschr. f. wiss.\r\nZool., vol. xxxvi. p. 486, Taf. xxxi.). He called it _Coelothamnus\r\ndavidoffii_, in honour of its discoverer, who had found it floating on the\r\nsurface of the Gulf of Villafranca, near Nice. He placed it among the\r\nCoelodendrida; it belongs, however, to that part of this group which\r\npossesses a nasal tube, and which I afterwards separated under the name\r\nCoelographida.\r\n\r\n{1524}The total number of PHÆODARIA, hitherto described and illustrated by\r\nfigures, amounts therefore to seventeen species, viz., the seven species\r\nfirst described by myself (in 1862); the six new species figured by Dr.\r\nJohn Murray (in 1876); the three new species discovered by Hertwig (in\r\n1879) and the single species last-mentioned described by Bütschli (in\r\n1882). The rich collection of the Challenger has added to this small number\r\nsuch an astonishing wealth of new and remarkable forms, that I can describe\r\nin the following system of PHÆODARIA not less than eighty-four genera and\r\nfour hundred and sixty-five species. These belong to fifteen different\r\nfamilies and four different orders. But this great number is probably only\r\na small part of the numerous interesting PHÆODARIA, which are abundantly\r\ndistributed over all the oceans; those (_e.g._) of the Indian and of the\r\nArctic Oceans are almost unknown.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of these wonderful PHÆODARIA are inhabitants of the\r\ndeep-sea, mainly of the southern hemisphere, and are so common in many\r\nstations explored by the Challenger, that its collection contains many\r\nthousands (or rather hundreds of thousands) of well-preserved specimens. A\r\nsmaller part of the legion is found on the surface, widely distributed over\r\nall oceans; some of these are very common (as, _e.g._, _Aulacantha_,\r\n_Aulosphæra_, _Sagosphæra_, _Coelodendrum_, _Castanella_, &c.) and it is\r\ndifficult to explain how they could entirely escape the eyes of all former\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nThe three general characters which distinguish the PHÆODARIA easily and\r\nconstantly from all the other Radiolaria are the following:--(1) the double\r\nmembrane, a thick outer and a thin inner envelope, of the big central\r\ncapsule; (2) its typical main-opening or astropyle, placed on the oral pole\r\nof the main axis, and distinguished by a peculiar radiate operculum, with\r\ntubular proboscis; (3) the phæodium, or the peculiar voluminous\r\npigment-body, which constantly lies in the oral half of the calymma,\r\nsurrounds the oral part of the central capsule, and is composed of numerous\r\nphæodella, or singular pigment-granules of green, olive, brown or black\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nBesides these three general and never failing marks of the PHÆODARIA, the\r\nmajority of this legion (but by no means all) possess the three following\r\npeculiarities; (1) two parapylæ or accessory openings of the central\r\ncapsule, placed laterally (at the right and left) on the aboral pole of the\r\nmain axis (wanting in the Challengerida, Medusettida, Castanellida, and\r\nperhaps in some other families); (2) a characteristic skeleton which is\r\nalways extracapsular, wanting only in the Phæodinida, incomplete in the\r\nCannorrhaphida and Aulacanthida, but perfectly developed and of very\r\nvarious shapes in the twelve other families; usually this silicated\r\nskeleton is composed of hollow tubules, which are filled up by jelly\r\n(PANSOLENIA); but in some families it is composed of ordinary solid\r\nnetwork, not different from that of the other Radiolaria, _e.g._,\r\nespecially in the Castanellida and Sagosphærida; (3) an extraordinary size\r\nof the body, as well of the central capsule and its nucleus, as of the\r\nextracapsular skeleton; the majority of PHÆODARIA have a diameter of 1 to 2\r\nmm., and are therefore from ten to twenty times as large as the\r\n{1525}majority of the other Radiolaria; in some gigantic forms the diameter\r\nof the unicellular body reaches 20 or even 30 mm.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the PHÆODARIA is the most important part of their\r\nbody and preserves in all families of this legion the same essential\r\nstructure, and nearly the same form, in striking contrast to the\r\nextraordinary variety and complication of the skeleton. As already\r\nmentioned, it differs from the central capsule of all the other Radiolaria\r\nin two most important peculiarities; firstly, the double membrane of the\r\nspheroidal capsule, and secondly, the singular structure of its constant\r\nmain-opening, the astropyle. A third constant character is the considerable\r\nsize of the enclosed nucleus, the diameter of which usually equals about\r\nhalf of that of the capsule itself.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the capsule is, in the majority of PHÆODARIA, 0.1 to 0.2\r\nmm., often also 0.3 to 0.4, rarely more than 0.5, or less than 0.05 mm.\r\n\r\nThe position of the central capsule is somewhat different in the four\r\norders into which we have divided the PHÆODARIA. It lies in the centre of\r\nthe spherical, concentric calymma in all the #Phæocystina#, or in those\r\nPHÆODARIA which possess no complete lattice-shell--Phæodinida,\r\nCannorrhaphida, and Aulacanthida (Pls. 101-105). The #Phæosphæria#\r\n(comprising the Orosphærida, Sagosphærida, Aulosphærida, and Cannosphærida,\r\nPls. 106-112) all possess a very big, usually spherical lattice-shell, and\r\nhere the central capsule is much smaller than the latter and lies in its\r\ncentre. Another position is constantly occupied by the central capsule in\r\nall #Phæogromia# (Pls. 99, 100, 113-120; the families Challengerida,\r\nMedusettida, Castanellida, Circoporida, Tuscarorida), which have a peculiar\r\nmouth on the lattice-shell, placed on the oral pole of its main axis; the\r\ncentral capsule lies in the opposite aboral half of the shell cavity. The\r\n#Phæoconchia# finally (Pls. 121-128, the families Concharida,\r\nCoelodendrida, and Coelographida) all possess a bivalved shell, and the\r\ncapsule is here enclosed between the two valves of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe form of the central capsule is constantly spheroidal, slightly\r\ndepressed in the direction of the main axis, and therefore comparable to\r\nthe spheroidal form of our globe. The depression is generally very slight,\r\nso that the proportion of the minor vertical main axis to the major\r\nhorizontal or equatorial axis is about 4 : 5 or 5 : 6, often even 8 : 9 or\r\nless; but sometimes the proportion becomes 3 : 4, or even 2 : 3, so that\r\nthe capsule becomes nearly lenticular; very rarely its form becomes almost\r\nperfectly spherical (Pl. 101, fig. 1). The main axis stands always\r\nvertically, and is distinctly marked by the peculiar shape of the\r\nastropyle, placed on its oral pole. Usually this pole, in the living and\r\nfreely floating PHÆODARIA seems to be the lower pole, directed downwards\r\n(as also in the NASSELLARIA); but in some families it seems to be inversely\r\ndirected upwards, as in the Challengerida and Tuscarorida, (Pls. 99, 100).\r\n\r\nThe two _membranes of the central capsule_ possess in all PHÆODARIA a very\r\ndifferent shape, and were in all preparations which I could accurately\r\nexamine (some hundreds {1526}belonging to all families) separated by a\r\nclear, rather wide interval, filled up either by a colourless fluid or by a\r\nstructureless jelly (Pl. 103, fig. 1; Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9, &c.). They are\r\nin direct connection only at the openings. In the living PHÆODARIA,\r\nhowever, their distance is very small, or they are in immediate contact\r\nwithout any interval (Pl. 101, fig. 10; Pl. 102, fig. 1). According to the\r\nobservations of Hertwig, the two membranes are always in close contact, and\r\nwithout interspace, in the living PHÆODARIA; and the space between them is\r\nan artificial product due to the influence of the preserving fluid or of\r\ncertain chemical agents. In every case it is very easy to separate both\r\nmembranes completely, except at the openings, where they are in direct\r\nconnection. We distinguish both membranes shortly as ectocapsa and\r\nendocapsa.\r\n\r\nThe ectocapsa, or the outer membrane of the central capsule, is rather firm\r\nand durable, double-contoured, elastic and difficult to destroy. Its\r\nphysical and chemical qualities seem to approach those of chitin. It\r\nbecomes, however, stained red by carmine, and yellow by nitric acid.\r\nUsually it appears structureless and refracts the light strongly. In a few\r\ncases, however, it exhibits, when examined by strong lenses, a fine\r\npunctation; and in some Aulacanthida (especially in some big forms of\r\n_Aulographis_ and _Aulospathis_) the entire ectocapsa was densely covered\r\nwith peculiar curved, or S-shaped dark corpuscles (Pl. 114, fig. 13). They\r\nwere all of the same length, about 0.01, and seemed to lie on its inner\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe endocapsa, or the inner membrane of the central capsule, is much\r\nthinner than the outer, with which it is in immediate connection only at\r\nthe openings. It encloses the entire contents of the capsule, and becomes\r\nvery distinct, as soon as the latter are dissolved by chemical agents, or\r\nstained by carmine. In the majority of well-preserved preparations it is\r\nirregularly plicated, and resembles a thin, but firm, crumpled paper.\r\nIsolated pieces of the endocapsa are completely structureless, but exhibit\r\nalso a considerable resistance, in spite of their minute thickness.\r\n\r\nThe openings of the central capsule exhibit in the PHÆODARIA a greater\r\nvariety than their discoverer, R. Hertwig, supposed. The majority of the\r\nlegion, certainly, possess the three openings described by him, and are\r\ntherefore true TRIPYLEA. Some families, however, have only one opening, the\r\nastropyle, which is generally present (Challengerida, Medusettida,\r\nCastanellida, and _Phæocolla_ among the Phæodinida, Pl. 101, fig. 1). In\r\nsome other families there is a variable number of accessory openings or\r\nparapylæ, one, three, or more, _e.g._, especially in the Circoporida and\r\nTuscarorida. The former may be called Astropylea, the latter Sporopylea.\r\nThus only a single opening to the central capsule is constant in all\r\nPHÆODARIA without exception, and that is the astropyle, or the large\r\nmain-opening with its peculiar structure.\r\n\r\nThe astropyle, or the single constant main-opening of the central capsule,\r\nis distinguished by a very remarkable structure, and is sufficient of\r\nitself to separate the {1527}PHÆODARIA from all the other Radiolaria, and\r\nfrom the other Rhizopoda in general. It is always placed on the oral pole\r\nof the main axis, forming here a peculiar cap-shaped or flatly conical\r\nelevation, the centre of which is prolonged into a short, cylindrical\r\ntubule; we call the latter shortly a proboscis, and the former an\r\noperculum. To understand better the different forms which these important\r\nparts assume in the different families, compare Pl. 101, figs. 1-6; Pl.\r\n102, fig. 1; Pl. 103, fig. 1; Pl. 104, figs. 1-3; Pl. 111, fig. 2; Pl. 123,\r\nfigs. 1-9; Pl. 127, figs. 4-6; Pl. 128, fig. 2, &c. Compare also the first\r\nvery accurate figures which R. Hertwig has given in 1879 (_loc. cit._) in\r\nhis Taf. x.\r\n\r\nThe operculum of the astropyle, the most important part of this main\r\nopening (\"der Oeffnungshof der Hauptöffnung,\" in the description of\r\nHertwig), is a circular convex plate, always more strongly vaulted than the\r\nsurrounding part of the capsule membrane, and is sharply separated from it\r\nby a circular, often thickened and double-contoured margin. The operculum\r\ncovers the main-opening like the lid of a tea-kettle, and the proboscis\r\narising from its centre is comparable to the handle of that lid. The\r\ndiameter of the circular operculum is usually about half as long (rarely as\r\nlong) as the radius of the central capsule, therefore in the majority of\r\nPHÆODARIA 0.03 to 0.06, sometimes 0.1 and more. Its form is sometimes more\r\nconical, sometimes more like a mamma. Its height is usually about equal to\r\nhalf its diameter. It always exhibits a very distinct radial striation,\r\nproduced by numerous prominent radial ribs, which arise in the centre and\r\nend at the circular sharply truncated margin. The usual number of these\r\nradial ribs may be, in the operculum of smaller capsules, from thirty to\r\nfifty, in those of medium size from sixty to ninety, and in the largest two\r\nhundred to three hundred or more. Usually the ribs are simple (Pl. 101,\r\nfigs. 1, 2, 6, 10; Pl. 127, figs. 4-6; also in all figures given by\r\nHertwig); but sometimes, mainly in the biggest Aulacanthida, they are\r\ndistinctly branched in a centrifugal direction (Pl. 114, fig. 13; Pl. 115,\r\nfig. 3). Hertwig is of the opinion that the radial ribs are thickened\r\nridges of the endocapsa (\"leistenartige Verdickungen der inneren Membran\"),\r\nand that the ectocapsa covering it is structureless (compare his figs. 1\r\nand 1_a_, in Taf. x.). But I am convinced now, by numerous experiments and\r\nobservations, that the radiate operculum is a part of the outer, not of the\r\ninner membrane. That part of the latter which lies immediately beyond the\r\nformer, and which may be called the \"inner operculum,\" also exhibits\r\nusually a fine radial striation; but this is probably only the cast of the\r\nstronger and much more prominent radial ribbing of the \"outer operculum\"\r\nbelonging to the ectocapsa. The latter exhibits a large circular opening\r\nwith thickened margin, when the radiate operculum is taken from it. The\r\noperculum becomes stained intensely red by carmine, yellow by nitric acid,\r\ncorresponding to the ectocapsa, the main-opening of which is closed by it.\r\n\r\nThe proboscis, or the cylindrical tubule, which arises in the centre of the\r\n{1528}operculum, is often rather short, and bears the same relation to it\r\nas the nipple does to the human breast (Pl. 104, fig. 2). But usually it is\r\nmore or less prolonged and often about as long as the radius of the\r\ncapsule, rarely nearly as long as its diameter (Pl. 101, fig. 1). Its form\r\nis usually a slender cylinder, sometimes somewhat conical and tapering\r\ntowards the distal end. It is more or less curved or S-shaped in the\r\nmajority of preparations (Pl. 115, fig. 3; Pl. 127, fig. 6, &c.). Its thin\r\nwall is a direct prolongation of the outer membrane of the capsule,\r\ntherefore it appears as a direct apophysis of the operculum, when this is\r\ndetached from the latter. The opening at the distal end of the proboscis,\r\nthrough which the endosarc is thrown out, is circular.\r\n\r\nThe parapylæ, or the accessory openings of the central capsule, exhibit in\r\nall PHÆODARIA the same form and structure, but vary in number and\r\ndisposition. They are recognised with difficulty in the smaller species,\r\nsince they are always of small size, and may be easily overlooked. They\r\nseem to be completely wanting in the following families:--Challengerida\r\n(Pl. 99), Medusettida (Pls. 118-120), Castanellida (Pl. 113), and in single\r\ngenera of other families, as in _Phæocolla_ (Pl. 101, fig. 1). The majority\r\nof PHÆODARIA seem to possess the two lateral parapylæ, first described by\r\nHertwig, placed at a variable distance on each side of the aboral pole, to\r\nthe right and left (Pl. 101, figs. 2, 6, 10; Pl. 103, fig. 1_a_; Pl. 104,\r\nfigs. 1, 2_a_; Pl. 123, figs. 1, 8_a_ &c.). The horizontal axis, on which\r\nthe two parapylæ lie, is the the frontal or lateral axis; and the plane,\r\nwhich passes through the three openings of these \"Tripylea,\" is the frontal\r\nor lateral plane. The number of the parapylæ seems to be variable in the\r\ntwo families, Circoporida and Tuscarorida, which also differ from the other\r\nPHÆODARIA in the peculiar (porcellanous) structure of their shell-wall. The\r\nnumber seems to vary even in the single species of one genus; and the\r\nfollowing cases may be found: (A) a single parapyle, placed on the aboral\r\npole of the main axis and directly opposed to the astropyle (on the oral\r\npole), as in _Tuscaridium_ (Pl. 100, fig. 8); (B) three equidistant\r\nparapylæ, one of which is placed in the sagittal plane, and the two others\r\none on each side of it, to the right and left, is in _Tuscarora_ (Pl. 100,\r\nfigs. 1-6); the three parapylæ seem to correspond here to the three long\r\nfeet, or the tubular aboral apophyses of the shell, which are arranged in a\r\nsimilar manner to the three cortinar feet of the NASSELLARIA; (C) four\r\nequidistant parapylæ, placed in pairs on the poles of the diagonal axes of\r\na horizontal plane, as in _Tuscarora_ (Pl. 100, fig. 7); they seem here to\r\ncorrespond to the four crossed aboral feet; (D) six to eight or more\r\nparapylæ probably in the different genera of Circoporida (Pls. 114-117);\r\nperhaps each radial tube, which is surrounded on its base by a circle of\r\npores, here corresponds to a separate parapyle. The number of\r\nwell-preserved central capsules belonging to the two latter families,\r\nhowever, which I could examine was relatively small and their examination\r\nvery difficult; therefore these numbers are not stated with satisfactory\r\ncertainty and require a further more accurate examination. {1529}The minute\r\nstructure of the parapylæ (or \"Neben-Oeffnungen\") has been described\r\nalready very accurately by Hertwig (_loc. cit._, p. 95, Taf. x. figs.\r\n1-11_b_). The two membranes of the capsule are in direct and immediate\r\nconnection on each parapyle. The strong outer membrane arises in the form\r\nof a ring or of a short cylindrical tubule (collare paraboscidis or\r\n\"Oeffnungshals\"), is then reflected inwards, and connected at the bottom of\r\nthe cylindrical cavity with the delicate inner membrane. From this\r\nconnective ring arises a short conical or cylindrical tubule, which we call\r\nshortly the \"paraboscis.\" According to Hertwig (who calls it\r\n\"Oeffnungskegel\") the paraboscis is a direct prolongation of the inner\r\nmembrane only. My own observations have led me to the opinion, that the\r\nparaboscis of each parapyle is a direct prolongation of the outer membrane\r\n(similarly to the larger proboscis of the astropyle), and that the basal\r\nconnective ring is, therefore, the inner opening of the paraboscis, through\r\nwhich the entosarc enters, being protruded through its outer circular\r\nopening. Usually the paraboscis of each parapyle is only a short cylinder,\r\narising by a conical base; but sometimes, especially in some Aulosphærida\r\nand Sagosphærida, it is prolonged into a slender tubule, nearly as long as\r\nthe radius of the central capsule. It has been already figured by Hertwig\r\n(_loc. cit._, Taf. x. figs. 6-8). It seems, therefore, that the paraboscis\r\nof the accessory openings is developed in a way similar to the proboscis of\r\nthe main-opening, and that the chief difference between the two is\r\nindicated by the large radiate operculum of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the endocapsa, or the spheroidal space enclosed by the inner\r\nmembrane of the central capsule, is filled up in its central part by the\r\nbig nucleus, in its peripheral part by the endoplasm, or by the internal\r\nprotoplasm, which is in communication with the outer or extracapsular\r\nprotoplasm by the openings of that capsule. The endoplasm, or the\r\nintracapsular sarcode, is rather opaque, finely granulated, and usually\r\nfilled up by numerous small clear spherules of equal size, which are more\r\nor less regularly arranged and equidistant. These spherules have usually a\r\ndiameter of 0.01 to 0.015, rarely more than 0.02 or less than 0.005 mm.;\r\ntheir size is generally equal in each capsule. They have been already\r\ndescribed and figured in my Monograph, as \"wasserhelle kugelige Bläschen,\"\r\nand are probably vacuoles or small vesicles filled up by jelly or by a\r\nclear fluid. Usually each vesicle contains a small dark granule of fat, or\r\na group of such granules connected together; and in these Hertwig observed\r\na vibrating molecular motion. The central capsule of many PHÆODARIA\r\ncontains, besides the vacuoles, often granules of pigment (usually red or\r\nyellow) and sometimes numerous groups of small crystals, placed mainly\r\nbeyond the operculum of the astropyle (Pl. 127, figs. 4-7). The outer layer\r\nof the endoplasm, placed immediately beyond the endocapsa, often exhibits a\r\nfine striation, as if composed of delicate fibrillæ. This fibrillar\r\nstriation is usually most distinct on the base of the openings, where also\r\nthe endoplasm becomes stained very intensely by carmine. The astropyle as\r\nwell as {1530}the parapylæ often exhibit here, when observed from the face,\r\na distinct radial striation (compare Hertwig, _loc. cit._, p. 98, Taf. x.\r\nfigs. 6-14) Perhaps the radiate shape of the operculum is only produced by\r\nradial folds of the endocapsa placed beyond it, and these folds may be in\r\nturn the product of the radial fibrillæ, which are prominent beyond the\r\nastropyle. On the other hand, these fibrillæ may be compared to the\r\nmuscular fibrillæ or \"myophane filaments\" in the ectosarc of the Infusoria,\r\nand may perhaps effect by their contraction a dilatation of the openings of\r\nthe capsule.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of the PHÆODARIA is always very large, usually about half or\r\ntwo thirds as broad as the central capsule and placed either in its centre,\r\nor sometimes nearer to one pole of the main axis, which is common to the\r\ncapsule and its nucleus. Therefore the diameter of the latter is usually\r\nhalf or even two thirds of that of the capsule, and may be in the majority\r\n0.05 to 0.15, often 0.2 to 0.3, rarely more than 0.4 or less than 0.01 mm.\r\nThe form of the nucleus is rarely spherical, usually spheroidal, and it is\r\nmore depressed in the direction of the main axis than the capsule itself.\r\nIn my Monograph, where I gave the first description of it, I called it\r\n\"Binnenbläschen.\" The membrane of the vesicular nucleus is thin but rather\r\nfirm, and contains a rather clear, finely granulated substance, in which\r\nnumerous nucleoli are usually scattered. (Compare Pl. 101, figs. 1-10; Pl.\r\n102-104; Pl. 123; Pl.127, &c.; the nucleus is marked by _n_, the nucleoli\r\nby _l_.)\r\n\r\nThe nucleoli are very different in respect to their form, size, number and\r\narrangement. Since these differences are very great even in different\r\nspecimens of a single species (as, _e.g._, in the common cosmopolitan\r\n_Aulacantha scolymantha_, _Aulosphæra trigonopa_, _Coelodendrum\r\nramosissimum_, &c.), it is probable that they represent different stages of\r\ndevelopment and multiplication, and that the smallest fragments of the\r\nnucleoli, or the final results of their repeated division, become the\r\nnuclei of the flagellate spores, which are developed in the PHÆODARIA just\r\nas in the other Radiolaria. In the majority of nuclei examined, the number\r\nof the enclosed nucleoli proved to be very great, fifty to eighty or more,\r\noften some hundreds, the greater their number the smaller their size. Their\r\nform is usually irregular, roundish, or even amoeboid--probably the result\r\nof amoebiform motions (Pl. 101, fig. 1). Sometimes the nucleoli were\r\nregularly spherical, equidistant, and connected apparently by a delicate\r\nnetwork (Pl. 101, fig. 2). (Compare Pl. 102-104, 111, 123, and also Taf. x.\r\nof Hertwig, _loc. cit._).\r\n\r\nThe calymma, or the extracapsular jelly-veil, is in the PHÆODARIA always\r\nwell developed and usually much larger than the enclosed central capsule.\r\nThe entire volume of the calymma may be three to six times as great as that\r\nof the capsule in the majority of this legion; but in the large\r\nAulacanthida, Aulosphærida, Coelodendrida, Coelographida, &c., the volume\r\nof the former is twenty to fifty as great as that of the latter, or even\r\nmore. The jelly substance is rather firm and consistent, clear,\r\nstructureless, and becomes more or less intensely stained by carmine. In\r\nthe {1531}larger forms it is often filled by numerous large alveoles, which\r\nare usually absent in the smaller forms. These extracapsular alveoles are\r\nmost strongly developed in the calymma of the #Phæocystina#, or the\r\nPHÆODARIA with incomplete skeleton, embracing the three families\r\nPhæodinida, Cannorrhaphida and Aulacanthida (Pls. 101-104). Usually the\r\ncalymma is here very voluminous and entirely filled up by large alveoles,\r\nwhich are either spherical, irregularly roundish, or polyhedral by mutual\r\ncompression. These alveoles or vacuoles have no peculiar wall, but are only\r\ncavities in the homogeneous substance of the jelly, and are filled by a\r\nclear aqueous fluid. Between these the network of the anastomosing\r\npseudopodia is expanded.  They exhibit, therefore, the same shape, as was\r\nfirst observed in _Thalassicolla_ and in the #Polycyttaria# (Collozoida,\r\nSphærozoida and Collosphærida).\r\n\r\nThe relation of the calymma to the skeleton is in the PHÆODARIA of the same\r\nimportance as in the other Radiolaria, and we may also here distinguish a\r\nprimary and a secondary calymma. The primary calymma is that on the surface\r\nof which at a certain period of life (in the \"shell-building period\") the\r\nfenestrated shell is secreted in the majority of PHÆODARIA. The secondary\r\ncalymma, however, is formed after this period, and envelops the shell\r\nitself as well as its apophyses externally. Usually the entire skeleton\r\nseems to be enveloped by the secondary calymma.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the extracapsular body, which are enclosed in the gelatinous\r\ncalymma possess a peculiar importance in the PHÆODARIA; these are firstly\r\nthe sarcomatrix and the pseudopodia arising from it, and secondly the\r\nphæodium. The sarcomatrix, or the layer of extracapsular sarcode\r\n(ectoplasm), which immediately surrounds the central capsule is very thick\r\nand more strongly developed in all PHÆODARIA than in all other Radiolaria.\r\nIts extraordinary size has been already mentioned by Hertwig (1879, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 99). It is in direct connection with the intracapsular sarcode\r\n(or the endoplasm) only by the openings of the central capsule, and mainly\r\nby the astropyle. Very numerous radial pseudopodia arise everywhere from\r\nthe sarcomatrix and run to the surface of the calymma, usually forming a\r\nrich network in it by means of numerous branches and anastomoses (compare\r\nPl. 101-104). On the surface of the calymma the meshes of this network are\r\nvery numerous, and there arise from its nodal points the terminal\r\npseudopodia, which float freely in the surrounding water. The metamorphoses\r\nof this network of sarcode, the perpetual changes in the number and size of\r\nits meshes, and the movements of the sarcode streams as well as of the\r\nsmall granules running in it, are always very manifest in the PHÆODARIA and\r\nin the big forms of this legion (mainly in the Aulacanthida) they are\r\nbetter observed than in the majority of other Radiolaria. In many PHÆODARIA\r\n(and perhaps in all) a part of the pseudopodia seems to have undergone a\r\nlocal differentiation, for special physiological purposes; and Hertwig has\r\ndescribed a peculiar conical contractile body, which arises in\r\n_Coelodendrum_ between the two parapylæ (_loc. cit._, p. 100, fig. 3).\r\nFurther examination {1532}of these interesting organs in living PHÆODARIA\r\nis required. Usually the sarcode, issuing from the openings of the capsule,\r\nforms a stronger cylinder, with peculiar movements.\r\n\r\nThe phæodium, or the peculiar dark extracapsular pigment-body of the\r\nPHÆODARIA, is one of the most important and most characteristic parts of\r\ntheir organisation, and has induced me to derive their name from it; it is\r\nnot less typical for the whole legion, than the astropyle with its radiate\r\noperculum and the proboscis; and both these important parts are always in\r\ndirect topographical and physiological connection. Whilst I have missed the\r\nphæodium in no _Phæodarium_ in which the soft body was well preserved, I\r\nhave not found it in any other Radiolaria; for the similar extracapsular\r\npigment bodies, which are found in some species of _Thalassicolla_ and some\r\nother #Sphærellaria#, have a composition and signification different from\r\nthat of the phæodium--an exclusive peculiarity of the PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\nThe typical importance of the phæodium for all members of this legion is\r\nproved by the following five facts:--(1) its constant presence in all\r\nPHÆODARIA; (2) its constant excentric position in the oral half of the\r\ncalymma; (3) its constant relation to the astropyle, the operculum and the\r\nproboscis of which is always surrounded by it; (4) its constant\r\nconsiderable size, its volume being usually greater than that of the\r\ncentral capsule, the aboral half of which is covered by it; (5) its\r\nconstant colour and morphological as well as chemical composition. These\r\nfive facts together demonstrate by their absolute constancy the high\r\nmorphological and physiological importance of the phæodium for this\r\npeculiar subclass of Radiolaria, although its true nature is difficult to\r\nmake out, and its main function is not yet sufficiently known.\r\n\r\nThe first remarks that have been made on the phæodium were published in\r\n1862 in my Monograph, where I noticed the peculiar dark brown extracapsular\r\npigment body and its excentric position covering only one-half of the\r\ncentral capsule, in _Aulacantha_ (p. 263, Taf. ii. figs. 1, 2), in\r\n_Thalassoplancta_ (p. 262, Taf. iii. fig. 10), and in _Coelodendrum_ (p.\r\n361, Taf. xxxii. fig. 1). Its general presence and peculiar composition\r\nwere first recognised by Dr. John Murray, who had, during the Challenger\r\nExpedition, the first opportunity of examining many big living PHÆODARIA\r\nbrought up from great depths. He gives in his first Report (1876, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 536), the following important notice:--\"The sarcode of all these\r\ndeep-sea Rhizopods has many large black-brown pigment-cells. Small\r\nbioplasts are scattered through the sarcode. These collect into\r\ncapsular-like clumps when the animal is at rest, and are quickly coloured\r\nby carmine.\" In 1877 Dr. John Murray sent me the wonderful collection of\r\nPHÆODARIA brought home by the Challenger, and I had now the best\r\nopportunity for examining the phæodium in hundreds of well-preserved\r\nspecimens. Supported by these extensive observations, I gave, in 1879, in a\r\npreliminary paper,[273] a fuller description of the {1533}phæodium, and of\r\nthe phæodella (or the peculiar dark pigment-granules composing it). At the\r\nsame time R. Hertwig published his observations on the big living TRIPYLEA\r\nexamined by him at Messina, and pointed out particularly that the constant\r\npresence, composition, and arrangement of this excentric extracapsular\r\npigment-body was most characteristic, and sufficient in itself to\r\ndistinguish this group from all the other Radiolaria (1879, _loc. cit._, p.\r\n99).\r\n\r\nThe most striking peculiarity of the phæodium, and the most important on\r\naccount of its absolute constancy, is its excentric position, covering only\r\nthe oral hemisphere of the central capsule, and wholly or partly wanting on\r\nthe aboral hemisphere. This constant topographical relation to the capsule\r\nnever fails, and may be always observed at the first glance, when the body\r\nis seen from the side (the main axis of the capsule being perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the eye of the observer), (compare Pl. 101, figs. 6, 10; Pl.\r\n102, fig. 1; Pl. 103, fig. 1, &c.). The phæodium envelops, therefore, the\r\noral half of the capsule completely, and especially the astropyle in its\r\ncentre; hence, the radiate operculum and the proboscis arising from the\r\nlatter cannot be seen usually before the former is removed. The general\r\nform of the entire phæodium, in consequence of this excentric position, is\r\nconcavo-convex (or crescentic in longitudinal section), its concave face\r\nembracing the oral or anterior face of the capsule, and its convex face\r\nbeing turned to the surface of the calymma.\r\n\r\nThe topographical relation of the phæodium to the surrounding shell is also\r\nvery characteristic in the suborder #Phæogromia#, or in those PHÆODARIA\r\nwhich possess a peculiar shell-mouth placed on the oral pole of its main\r\naxis. Here the capsule is always placed in the aboral half of the\r\nshell-cavity, the phæodium in its oral half, separating the astropyle from\r\nthe mouth of the shell, both of which lie in the main axis; as in the\r\nChallengerida (Pl. 99), Tuscarorida (Pl. 100), Castanellida (Pl. 113),\r\nCircoporida (Pl. 115), and Medusettida (Pl. 118-120). In this suborder (the\r\n#Phæogromia#), the volume of the phæodium may be, on an average, about as\r\ngreat as that of the central capsule, whilst in the majority of other\r\nPHÆODARIA it is much greater than the latter.\r\n\r\nA similar topographical relation between the phæodium and the enclosing\r\nshell, as in the #Phæogromia#, also exists in the suborder #Phæoconchia#,\r\nor in those PHÆODARIA, which are distinguished from all the others by the\r\npossession of a bivalved shell (Pl. 121-128). The two valves of this\r\ncurious shell, which resembles that of the Brachiopoda, are dorsal and\r\nventral, and the tripylean central capsule is always so placed between them\r\nthat its two lateral parapylæ (right and left) lie in the frontal plane of\r\nthe shell, where a large frontal fissure opens between the opposed margins\r\nof the two hemispherical or cap-shaped valves. The phæodium is also placed\r\nhere on the oral half of the capsule and surrounds its astropyle; but it\r\nexhibits some differences in the three families of #Phæoconchia#.\r\n\r\n{1534}The Concharida, the bivalved shell of which is simple, and without\r\ntubular apophyses (Pl. 123-125), possess a relatively small central\r\ncapsule, which usually fills up only the third or fourth part of the\r\nshell-cavity. This is the aboral or posterior part, on the apex of which\r\nboth valves are united by a ligament in some Concharida (Pl. 123, figs. 8,\r\n9). The oral or anterior part of the shell-cavity (usually two-thirds or\r\nmore) is filled up by the phæodium, and this is usually bifid, being\r\ndivided by a frontal constriction into two wings or lobes; the dorsal wing\r\nis hidden in the upper valve of the shell, the ventral wing in the lower\r\nvalve; both wings are usually united only by a small central bridge, and\r\nthis bridge of the phæodium is pierced in its centre by the proboscis of\r\nthe astropyle (Pl. 124, figs. 6, 10; Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9).\r\n\r\nThe Coelodendrida have a different shape (Pl. 121). Their bivalved shell is\r\nrelatively small and tiny, and bears on the two poles of the sagittal axis\r\ntwo conical apophyses or galeæ, from each of which three or four very\r\nlarge, dichotomously branched tubes arise. The central capsule fills up the\r\ncavity of the bivalved shell almost entirely, and the voluminous dark\r\nphæodium envelops both to such an extent that the shell and the enclosed\r\ncapsule are often hidden in it completely. Therefore I arrived in my first\r\ndescription of _Coelodendrum_ (1862, _loc. cit._) at the erroneous\r\nconclusion that the capsule lies outside, not inside the shell. The first\r\naccurate figure and description of its structure was given in 1879, by\r\nHertwig (_loc. cit._, p. 99, Taf. x. fig. 3). The central capsule (_v_) is\r\nhere separated from the bivalved shell (_m_) only by a very small distance,\r\nand the oral part of both is hidden in the phæodium. I find, however, in\r\nthe majority of the numerous preparations of the Challenger collection, the\r\nvolume of the phæodium much greater, and it often envelops the entire\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe Coelographida, finally, have a phæodium of the most remarkable shape,\r\nsince in their bivalved shell a peculiar reserve store or magazine of\r\nphæodella, which we call the \"phæocapsa\" is developed for it (Pl. 126-128,\r\n_g.t.m._). The bivalved shell has in these most perfect PHÆODARIA a\r\nstructure similar to that in the Coelodendrida; but they differ from the\r\nlatter in the stronger development, and greater differentiation of the two\r\napical galeæ, and the large hollow tubes arising from them. These two\r\nhelmet-shaped cupolæ, the galeæ (_g_), which arise from the two valves on\r\nthe poles of the sagittal axis, are in the Coelographida usually larger\r\nthan the valves themselves, and are not closed, as in the Coelodendrida,\r\nbut open by a tubular apophysis at their base, the nasal tube or rhinocanna\r\n(_t_). The apex of the galea is connected with the open mouth of the\r\nrhinocanna by a single or double frenulum (_b_). The two nasal tubes or\r\nrhinocannæ (a dorsal and a ventral) lie in the sagittal plane of the body\r\nand run from the base of each galea along the anterior convexity of the\r\nvalve to its oral margin. Here is placed the proboscis of the astropyle,\r\nbetween the two opposed mouths of the rhinocannæ (Pl. 128, fig. 2). The\r\nphæodium is usually hidden entirely {1535}in the two phæocapsæ, which are\r\ncomposed of the two galeæ (_g_), and the two rhinocannæ arising from them\r\n(Pl. 127, figs. 4-9). A part of the phæodella is usually thrown out by the\r\nmouth of the latter (_m_).\r\n\r\nThe characteristic colour of the phæodium exhibits numerous different tints\r\nbetween green, brown, and black. It seems to be in the majority\r\nblackish-brown or greenish-brown, very often olive, more rarely almost\r\nquite green or red-brown. Usually the colour is so dark, intense and\r\nopaque, that the parts enclosed by the phæodium, mainly the oral hemisphere\r\nof the central capsule and the astropyle, are completely hidden in it. The\r\nchemical composition of the phæodium demands further accurate researches;\r\nunfortunately I have not been able to make out its true nature, since\r\nnumerous different experiments furnished no certain general results.\r\n\r\nThe phæodella, or the pigment-corpuscles, which compose the phæodium,\r\naggregated in hundreds, and in the bigger species in thousands, are usually\r\nspherical, sometimes somewhat ellipsoidal, at other times spheroidal or\r\nlenticular; but usually numerous smaller, irregular, roundish particles are\r\nintermingled between the larger and more regular corpuscles, and often the\r\nmain mass forms a very fine black powder. The size of the phæodella is very\r\nvariable, not only in the different species, but also in one and the same\r\nindividual. The larger phæodella have a diameter of 0.01 to 0.02, the\r\nsmaller of 0.004 to 0.008 mm.; but there also occur very big forms of 0.04\r\nto 0.05 mm., or even more, and very small ones of 0.001 mm. or less.\r\nUsually the phæodium appears as an aggregate of numerous larger and smaller\r\nphæodella, which are very different in size as well as in the intensity and\r\ntint of their colour, and are irregularly crowded in a black, powder-like\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nThe morphological nature of the phæodella is also difficult to make out. I\r\nhave already pointed out in my first description of _Aulacantha_,\r\n_Thalassoplancta_ and _Coelodendrum_ (1862, _loc. cit._), that a great part\r\nof these pigment-corpuscles are true cells, composed of a nucleus and\r\nprotoplasm, which contains granules of pigment, and is enveloped by a\r\nmembrane. Dr. John Murray, who had during the Challenger voyage the\r\nopportunity of examining numerous different living PHÆODARIA, and staining\r\nthem by carmine, also asserts that a great part of those dark corpuscles\r\nare \"large black-brown pigment-cells\" (1876, _loc. cit._, p. 536). Numerous\r\npreparations of the Challenger collection, well preserved in glycerine, and\r\nstained by carmine, contain PHÆODARIA belonging to different families, the\r\nphæodium of which contains numerous such \"pigment-cells,\" with a dark red\r\nnucleus, and so similar are these cells, that every histologist should\r\nrecognise them. But in strange contrast to this is the fact, that in\r\nnumerous other mountings, prepared in the same manner, not a single cell of\r\nthis kind is found in the phæodium, and that the latter is composed only of\r\nirregular pigment-granules. In many PHÆODARIA belonging to different\r\nfamilies I, like Hertwig, could not find a single true nucleated cell in\r\nthe phæodium.\r\n\r\n{1536}A great part of the PHÆODARIA, and usually the bigger forms of\r\nAulacanthida, Cannorrhaphida, Coelodendrida, Coelographida, &c., exhibit a\r\npeculiar structure of the larger phæodella, viz., a fine parallel striation\r\n(Pl. 101, figs. 3, 6; Pl. 102, fig. 1; Pl. 103, fig. 1; Pl. 104, figs. 1-3,\r\n&c.). In each phæodellum may be counted about ten to twenty such fine\r\nparallel stripes (more in the greater, less in the smaller forms); and in\r\nthe ellipsoidal phæodella the stripes are either transverse rings,\r\nperpendicular to their main axis, or ascending obliquely; they often\r\nresemble the convoluted spiral filament of a thread-cell or nettle-cell of\r\nan Acaleph. Sometimes these parallel transverse stripes are very striking.\r\nAnother structure is seen in larger phæodella, namely an aggregate or\r\ncluster of smaller globules, often of equal size, resembling a small\r\nmorula. All these minute structures of the phæodella as well as their\r\nchanges in the living PHÆODARIA, require a far more extensive examination\r\n(by means of strong lenses and different chemical reagents), than I could,\r\nunfortunately, devote to them.\r\n\r\nThe physiological signification of the phæodella, therefore, is at present\r\nnot yet known; but the general facts quoted above, their constant presence,\r\nposition, volume, and composition, make it probable that their\r\nphysiological value in the PHÆODARIAN organism is very great. The following\r\nhypotheses may be taken provisionally into consideration:--A. The phæodella\r\nare peculiar symbiontes, or unicellular algæ, comparable to the xanthellæ\r\nor zooxanthellæ of the other Radiolaria. This hypothesis is probably\r\ncorrect for those phæodella which are true nucleated cells; and the more\r\nso, as the majority of PHÆODARIA do not exhibit those common yellow\r\nxanthellæ, which are usually found in the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA. It\r\nis even possible that the latter are absent in all PHÆODARIA. B. The\r\nphæodella are dark pigment-bodies, which absorb light and heat in a manner\r\nsimilar to the simple \"pigment-eyes\" of many lower animals, and may\r\ntherefore be optical sense-organs of the PHÆODARIA. This hypothesis may be\r\nsupported by a comparison with the large-eyed unicellular Protist,\r\n_Erythropsis agilis_, described by R. Hertwig. C. The phæodella are organs\r\nof nutrition of the PHÆODARIA and active in their metastasis\r\n(\"Stoffwechsel\"). Regarding them from this point of view, we may suppose\r\nthat the phæodella are secreted products which serve for digestion, acting\r\nlike the bile or the saliva of higher animals. Perhaps they too act like\r\nthe venomous matter produced in the thread-capsules of the Acalephæ. The\r\nsuggestion that they are mere excretions, or half-digested matters, as\r\nHertwig supposes (\"halb assimilirte Nahrungs-bestandtheile,\" 1879, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 99) seems less probable. The most important fact illustrating\r\ntheir high signification for the processes of nutrition, digestion and for\r\neffecting changes on matter, seems to be the close relation of the phæodium\r\nto the astropyle; the radiate operculum of the latter, and the proboscis\r\narising from it, being constantly covered and completely hidden by the\r\ncentral main mass of the phæodium.\r\n\r\n{1537}The skeleton of the PHÆODARIA is always extracapsular, and exhibits\r\nin the majority of this legion such a characteristic shape, form, and\r\nstructure, that these organisms may be easily recognised by it, even apart\r\nfrom the central capsule and the phæodium. In a few cases, however, the\r\nskeleton is so similar to that of some NASSELLARIA and SPUMELLARIA, that it\r\nmay be accidentally confounded with it. In general the skeleton of the\r\nPHÆODARIA is much larger, and much more highly developed, than that of most\r\nother Radiolaria, and exhibits the most wonderful appearances, and the most\r\nmarvellous complications, which are found in the whole world of Protists,\r\nor of unicellular organisms. The varied composition and differentiation of\r\nthe skeleton alone distinguishes the numerous families, genera, and species\r\nof PHÆODARIA described in the sequel; all the fifteen families, however,\r\nagree so completely in the structure of the central capsule and the\r\nphæodium described, that we may derive them all phylogenetically from a\r\nsmall skeletonless family, the Phæodinida.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of the skeleton seems to be, in the majority of\r\nPHÆODARIA, somewhat different from that of the other Radiolaria. In a few\r\ngroups only, especially in the Cannobelida (_Dictyocha_, _Mesocena_, &c.),\r\nand in a part of the Castanellida and Concharida, the substance of the\r\nskeleton seems to be of pure silica, as in the NASSELLARIA and SPUMELLARIA;\r\nthese flinty skeletons, therefore, may be also found fossil. In the\r\nmajority of PHÆODARIA, however, the skeleton does not consist of pure\r\nsilica, but of an organic silicate; it becomes more or less intensely\r\nstained by carmine, and browned or blacked by fire; in many cases it even\r\nbecomes completely burned and destroyed by the prolonged action of heat.\r\nThis circumstance explains why PHÆODARIA in general are rare in deep-sea\r\ndeposits, as in the common Radiolarian ooze of the Pacific, and why they\r\nare generally absent in fossil deposits. Even the pure Radiolarian rocks of\r\nthe Barbados, &c., contain only a few PHÆODARIA, mainly Dictyochida.\r\n\r\nAccording to the different forms of the skeleton, we may divide the legion\r\nor subclass of PHÆODARIA into two sublegions, four orders, and fifteen\r\nfamilies. Firstly, we may distinguish as two groups the #Phæocystina#,\r\nwithout a lattice-shell, and the #Phæocoscina#, with a lattice-shell\r\n(compare above, p. 5). The #Phæocystina# comprise three different families,\r\nviz., (1) Phæodinida, without any skeleton (Pl. 101, figs. 1, 2); (2)\r\nCannorrhaphida, with an incomplete skeleton, composed of numerous separate,\r\nnot radial pieces, which are scattered around the capsule in the calymma\r\n(Pl. 101, figs. 3-14; Pl. 114, figs. 7-13), and (3) Aulacanthida (Pl.\r\n102-105), with an incomplete skeleton, composed of numerous hollow radial\r\ntubes, which pierce the calymma and come in contact by their proximal ends\r\nwith the surface of the central capsule.\r\n\r\nThe #Phæocoscina#, or the PHÆODARIA with a lattice-shell (embracing the\r\ngreat majority of the whole legion) exhibit three principal differences in\r\nthe shape of their shell, and from these we distinguish the three following\r\norders; (A) #Phæosphæria#, with a spherical, not bivalved shell (rarely of\r\nan ellipsoidal or lenticular, or another {1538}modified form), without a\r\nshell-mouth or a peculiar constant large opening on the lattice-shell; (B)\r\n#Phæogromia#, with an ovate or polyhedral, not bivalved shell (often also\r\nof a subspherical, ellipsoidal, or another modified form), constantly\r\nprovided with a shell-mouth or a peculiar large opening on one pole of the\r\nmain axis of the lattice-shell; (C) #Phæoconchia#, with a bivalved shell,\r\ncomposed of two completely separated, hemispherical, cap-shaped or\r\nboat-shaped valves (a dorsal and a ventral), comparable to that of the\r\nBrachiopoda.\r\n\r\nThe #Phæosphæria#, or those PHÆODARIA the big shell of which is usually\r\nspherical, never bivalved and never provided with a peculiar shell-mouth,\r\ncomprise a great number of common and large-sized PHÆODARIA, which may be\r\narranged into four different families, according to the different structure\r\nof the shell--(1) Orosphærida (Pl. 106, 107), spherical shell extremely big\r\nand robust, composed of single piece of coarse lattice-work, the thick bars\r\nof which are stratified and contain partly a fine axial-canal, meshes of\r\nthe network usually irregularly polygonal, no astral septa in the nodal\r\npoints; (2) Sagosphærida (Pl. 108), spherical shell large-sized, but\r\nextremely delicate and fragile, composed of a single piece of arachnoidal\r\nlattice-work, the thin bars of which are simple solid threads, without\r\naxial-canal, meshes of the network always large and triangular, no astral\r\nsepta in the nodal points; (3) Aulosphærida (Pl. 109-111), spherical shell\r\nlarge-sized, but very fragile, composed of numerous hollow cylindrical\r\ntubes, which are connected (and at the same time separated) by peculiar\r\nastral septa in the nodal points, meshes either triangular or polygonal;\r\n(4) Cannosphærida (Pl. 112), spherical shell double, composed of two\r\nconcentric shells which are connected by thin hollow radial tubes, the\r\ninner shell simple, solid or fenestrated, with a shell-mouth on the basal\r\npole, the outer shell composed of hollow cylindrical tubes which are\r\nconnected by astral septa in the nodal points. The structure of this outer\r\nshell is the same as in the Aulosphærida, while the basal mouth of the\r\ninner shell brings this family in closer relationship to the #Phæogromia#.\r\n\r\nThe #Phæogromia#, or those PHÆODARIA the shell of which is not bivalved,\r\nbut provided with a peculiar constant mouth on the oral pole of the main\r\naxis, are in general similar to the NASSELLARIA (Monocyrtida), and may be\r\ndivided into five different families, viz., (1) Challengerida (Pl. 99),\r\nshell ovate or subspherical, also often triangular or lenticular,\r\ndistinguished by a peculiar diatomaceous structure, an exceedingly fine\r\ntracery of regular hexagonal, very delicate network; (2) Medusettida (Pl.\r\n118-120), shell ovate, campanulate or cap-shaped, distinguished by a\r\npeculiar alveolar structure, with a corona of peculiar hollow, large,\r\narticulated feet around the mouth; (3) Castanellida (Pl. 113), shell\r\nspherical or subspherical, of ordinary simple lattice-work, usually with a\r\ncorona of simple solid teeth around the mouth; (4) Circoporida (Pl.\r\n114-117), shell spherical or polyhedral, with panelled or dimpled surface,\r\ndistinguished by a peculiar porcellanous structure (numerous thin needles\r\nbeing {1539}embedded in a punctulate cement-substance), with hollow radial\r\nspines and with a corona of simple solid teeth around the mouth; (5)\r\nTuscarorida (Pl. 100), shell ovate or subspherical, with smooth surface, of\r\nthe same peculiar porcellanous structure as the Circoporida, but with\r\nhollow, very long tubular teeth around the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe #Phæoconchia# are the peculiar and most interesting \"PHÆODARIA\r\nbivalva,\" differing from all other PHÆODARIA, and from all known Radiolaria\r\nin general, in the possession of a bivalved lattice-shell, composed of a\r\ndorsal and a ventral valve. They may be divided into three families: (1)\r\nConcharida (Pl. 123-125), shell with two thick and firm, regularly latticed\r\nvalves, which bear no hollow tubes and no cupola or galea on their apex or\r\nsagittal pole; (2) Coelodendrida (Pl. 121), shell with two thin and\r\nfragile, scarcely latticed valves, which bear a conical cupola or a\r\nhelmet-shaped galea on their apex, and hollow branched tubes arising from\r\nit (without rhinocanna and frenula); (3) Coelographida (Pl. 122, 126-128),\r\nshell with two thin and fragile, scarcely latticed valves, similar to those\r\nof the Coelodendrida, but differing from them in the development of a\r\npeculiar rhinocanna or nasal tube upon each valve; this tube is connected\r\nby an odd or paired frenulum with the apex of the galea, and both together\r\ncontain the phæodium.\r\n\r\nThe phylogenetic affinity of the fifteen families enumerated, and the\r\nmorphological relationship based upon it, form a very difficult problem.\r\nThe whole legion of PHÆODARIA is probably monophyletic, in as much as all\r\nthe families may be derived from a single ancestral group, the skeletonless\r\nPhæodinida (_Phæodina_ and _Phæocolla_); but at the same time polyphyletic,\r\nin as much as probably many families have been derived, independently one\r\nfrom another, from different branches of Phæodinida; or in other words, the\r\ncharacteristic malacoma of the PHÆODARIA (the cannopylean central capsule\r\nand the calymma with the phæodium) may be a monophyletic product, inherited\r\nfrom a single ancestral form; the manifold skeleton, however, is certainly\r\na polyphyletic product, originating from different skeletonless Phæodinida.\r\n\r\nAmong the independent families of PHÆODARIA, derived directly from\r\nskeletonless Phæodinida by production of a peculiar skeleton, may be the\r\nfollowing: Cannorrhaphida (Pl. 101, probably polyphyletic), Aulacanthida\r\n(Pl. 102-105), Castanellida (Pl. 113), Challengerida (Pl. 99), Concharida\r\n(Pl. 123-125), Circoporida (Pl. 114-117) and Tuscarorida (Pl. 100). The\r\nfour families of #Phæosphæria# (the Orosphærida, Sagosphærida, Aulosphærida\r\nand Cannosphærida (Pl. 106-112), may be derived perhaps from the\r\nCastanellida; and the Medusettida (Pl. 118-120), have been perhaps derived\r\nfrom the Challengerida. The complicated affinities of these groups are\r\nhowever difficult to explain. The Coelodendrida (Pl. 121) are probably\r\nderived from the Concharida, and the Coelographida (Pl. 126-128) from the\r\nCoelodendrida.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical fundamental form of the shell is in the majority of\r\nPHÆODARIA monaxonial, corresponding to the main axis of the enclosed\r\ncentral capsule; the {1540}astropyle of the latter, placed on the oral pole\r\nof the main axis, corresponds to the mouth of the shell in all\r\n#Phæogromia#. In the #Phæosphæria#, where no peculiar shell mouth is\r\ndeveloped, the general fundamental form of the shell is usually homaxonial\r\nor spherical, often an endospherical polyhedron, rarely ellipsoidal or\r\nspindle-shaped (with prolonged main axis), or lenticular (with shortened\r\nmain axis). The bivalved #Phæoconchia# have usually either an amphithect\r\nshell (with the same fundamental form as the Ctenophora), or a dipleuric,\r\nbilaterally symmetrical shell (with a dorsal and a ventral valve, a right\r\nand a left parapyle). A small number of PHÆODARIA (mainly Circoporida) are\r\nremarkable on account of the regular polyhedral form of their shell, the\r\ngeometrical axes of which resemble crystalline axes and are defined by\r\nregular radial tubes; as the octahedral _Circoporus_ (Pl. 117, fig. 6), the\r\ndodecahedral _Circorrhegma_ (fig. 2), and the icosahedral _Circogonia_\r\n(fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe siliceous or silicate bars, which compose the skeleton of the\r\nPHÆODARIA, are in the majority hollow tubes, filled up by jelly; in some\r\nother families, however, they are solid rods, as in the NASSELLARIA and\r\nSPUMELLARIA. Such usual lattice-work, composed of solid rods, occurs only\r\nin the families Sagosphærida (Pl. 108), Castanellida (Pl. 113), and\r\nConcharida (Pls. 123-125). A quite peculiar structure, a diatomaceous\r\ntracery of extremely fine and regular hexagonal frames, distinguishes the\r\nChallengerida (Pl. 99). The hollow cylindrical tubes, which are found in\r\nthe other families, appear in three different forms, simple, articulate,\r\nand provided with an axial thread. Simple hollow tubes, which are neither\r\narticulate nor provided with an axial thread, occur in the Cannorrhaphida\r\n(Pl. 101), Aulacanthida (Pl. 102-105), Coelodendrida (Pl. 121, 122), and\r\nCoelographida (Pl. 126-128). In all these families the hollow cylindrical\r\ntubes have a very thin wall and contain a wide cavity, filled only by\r\njelly. The Orosphærida (Pl. 106, 107), differ in the reduction of the\r\ncavity, which becomes very narrow (often rudimentary or lost), whilst the\r\nwalls of the tubes become extremely  thickened and stratified, numerous\r\nconcentric layers of silica being disposed one over the other. The hollow\r\ncylindrical tubes contain an axial filament, or a thin thread of silica,\r\nplaced in its axis, in the families Aulosphærida (Pl. 109-111),\r\nCannosphærida (Pl. 112), Circoporida (Pl. 114-117), and Tuscarorida (Pl.\r\n100). Usually the axial filament is connected with the thin wall of the\r\ntube by numerous horizontal branches. A quite peculiar structure\r\ndistinguishes the Medusettida (Pl. 118-120); their hollow tubes, extremely\r\nprolonged, are articulate owing to the presence of numerous, regular,\r\nequidistant transverse septa; these are pierced by a short tubule, similar\r\nto the siphon of the shells of _Nautilus_; this remarkable alveolar\r\nstructure also occurs in the peripheral part of their shell-wall (and\r\nsometimes in the whole shell), numerous small polyhedral chambers or\r\nalveoles which communicate by small openings, being developed; they become\r\neasily filled with air in the dry shell (Pl. 120, figs. 11-16).\r\n\r\n{1541}The substance of the siliceous or silicated shell-wall is, in the\r\nmajority of PHÆODARIA, homogeneous and structureless, as in the SPUMELLARIA\r\nand NASSELLARIA; but sometimes it acquires a peculiar structure. The\r\nthickened wall of the hollow tubes in the Orosphærida and in several\r\nAulacanthida (Pl. 105, figs. 6-10) becomes distinctly stratified,\r\nconcentric strata being disposed one over the other. A very remarkable\r\nstructure, differing from that in all other Radiolaria, is found in the\r\nporcellanous shell of the Circoporida (Pl. 114-117), and Tuscarorida (Pl.\r\n100). The thickened wall of the opaque shell is here composed of a peculiar\r\nsilicated cement, which encloses numerous very thin and irregularly\r\nscattered needles (Pl. 115, figs. 6-9; Pl. 116, fig. 3). Dry fragments of\r\nthese shells, observed by a strong lens, appear finely punctulate, and\r\nprobably air, entering into these fine porules of the cement, causes the\r\nwhite colour and the calcareous or porcellanous appearance of the opaque\r\ndry shell. Its surface is smooth in the Tuscarorida (Pl. 100), panelled in\r\nthe Circoporida (Pl. 114-117).\r\n\r\nThe hollow or solid spines, which arise from the shell of the PHÆODARIA,\r\nexhibit an extraordinary variety and elegance in the production of\r\ndifferent branches, bristles, hairs, secondary spine, and thorns, hooks,\r\nanchor-threads, pencils, spathillæ, &c. These appendages are developed\r\nsimilarly to those of many SPUMELLARIA, but exhibit a far greater variety\r\nand richness in form. They are organs partly for protection, partly for\r\nretention of food. They are much more interesting than in other Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Orders and Families of_ PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Gesellsch. Jena, Dec.\r\n      12, p. 4.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA without skeleton. Central capsule with one to\r\nthree (or more) openings, placed in the centre of the spherical naked\r\ncalymma.\r\n\r\nThe family #Phæodinida# is the simplest and most primitive of the\r\nPHÆODARIA, and differs from all the other families of this legion in the\r\ncomplete absence of a skeleton. It bears, therefore, the same relation to\r\nthe latter as the Thalassicollida do to the other SPUMELLARIA. The soft\r\nbody is only composed of the central capsule with the nucleus, and the\r\ncalymma with the phæodium.\r\n\r\nOf course it is quite possible that the skeletonless PHÆODARIA, which we\r\nregard here as the ancestral family of that legion, may be either members\r\nof other families which have lost their skeleton accidentally, or young\r\nPHÆODARIA which have not yet developed a skeleton. But in some preparations\r\nof the Challenger certain large, well-preserved PHÆODARIA, without any\r\ntrace of skeleton, are not rare; and since I myself have observed a\r\ncomplete living _Phæodina_, I have no doubt that they are independent,\r\nprimordial forms (like _Actissa_, _Thalassicolla_, _Cystidium_, _Nassella_,\r\n&c.). Probably also two skeletonless PHÆODARIA belong to this family which\r\nare figured by R. Hertwig, in 1879, in his Organismus d. Radiol. (Taf. x.\r\nfig. 1, 11); this author, however, supposed that they had lost their\r\noriginal skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe three species of Phæodinida which are described in the sequel represent\r\ntwo different genera, _Phæodina_ and _Phæocolla_, already distinguished in\r\nmy first note on the PHÆODARIA (Sitzungsb. med.-nat. Gesellsch. Jena, 1879,\r\nDec. 12, p. 4). _Phæodina_ is a true TRIPYLEA, and has the usual three\r\nopenings which occur in the majority of PHÆODARIA, a large astropyle or\r\nmain-opening on the oral pole of the main axis, and a pair of lateral\r\naccessory openings, or parapylæ, on the aboral pole. _Phæocolla_, however,\r\nhas only a single opening, the astropyle, and agrees therefore with those\r\nPHÆODARIA which possess no parapylæ (Challengerida, Medusettida,\r\nCastanellida, &c.).\r\n\r\nThe complete body is in all observed Phæodinida a small jelly sphere of 1\r\nto 3 mm. in diameter, with a transparent cortical layer and an opaque dark\r\ncentral part. This latter is the phæodium, in which the central capsule is\r\nhidden, surrounded on all sides by the gelatinous spherical calymma; the\r\nsmooth surface of the latter is spherical.\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Phæodinida (Pl. 101, figs. 1, 2), is either\r\nspherical or spheroidal, somewhat lenticular, slightly depressed in the\r\ndirection of the main axis. Its diameter is between 0.15 and 0.25. Its\r\ndouble membrane exhibits the same structure as in the other PHÆODARIA. The\r\nthick, double-contoured outer membrane is separated from the thin and\r\ndelicate inner membrane by a clear space, filled up by jelly or by a fluid;\r\nthe two are connected in _Phæocolla_ (fig. 1) only at the astropyle, in\r\n_Phæodina_ (fig. 2), {1544}they are also connected at the two parapylæ. The\r\nradiate operculum of the astropyle opens by a tubular prolongation or\r\nproboscis, which is very long in the former, shorter in the latter. The two\r\nparapylæ of the latter also bear short tubules. The protoplasm, enclosed in\r\nthe inner membrane, contains numerous small circular vacuoles. The large\r\ncentral nucleus is sometimes spherical or ellipsoidal, at other times\r\nspheroidal or lenticular; it always contains numerous nucleoli. One\r\nspecimen observed, with two nuclei, was apparently engaged in self-division\r\n(fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThe spherical gelatinous calymma, in the centre of which the central\r\ncapsule is placed, has a diameter of 1 to 2 mm. In the specimen of\r\n_Phæodina tripylea_, which I observed living, it exhibited exactly the same\r\nshape as the figure of _Dictyocha stapedia_ in Pl. 101, fig. 10; the only\r\ndistinction in this latter being indicated by the pileated pieces of the\r\nskeleton on the surface. The jelly-sphere contained numerous roundish or\r\nglobular alveoles of very different sizes, and between them an areolated\r\nnetwork of protoplasm; the latter has arisen from the outer surface of the\r\ncalymma in the form of very numerous, radiating, partly branched and\r\nanastomosing pseudopodia. The dark and opaque centre of the jelly-sphere is\r\nfilled up by the granular, blackish-brown phæodium, which envelops the oral\r\nhalf of the central capsule completely; it exhibits the same characters as\r\nin all the other PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Phæodinida._\r\n\r\n  Central capsule with a single opening (an astropyle\r\n    on the oral pole),                                   656. _Phæocolla_.\r\n\r\n  Central capsule with three openings (an oral\r\n   astropyle and two aboral parapylæ),                   657. _Phæodina_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 656. _Phæocolla_,[274] Haeckel, 1879, Sitzungsb. med.-nat.

Gesellsch. Jena,\r\n      Dec. 12, p. 4.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with an incomplete skeleton, composed of numerous\r\nseparate, not radially arranged pieces, which are either hollow tangential\r\nspicula or cap-shaped dishes, or fenestrated rings, scattered loosely in\r\nthe calymma. Central capsule placed in the centre of the spherical calymma.\r\n\r\nThe family #Cannorrhaphida# comprises those PHÆODARIA in which the\r\nincomplete skeleton is represented by numerous separate pieces of silica,\r\nwhich exhibit very different forms, and are scattered tangentially on the\r\nsurface of the spherical calymma, sometimes also throughout its jelly-mass.\r\nThey agree in this peculiar character with the Thalassosphærida (among the\r\nSPUMELLARIA) and bear the same relation to the skeletonless Phæodinida as\r\nthe Thalassosphærida do to the Thalassicollida (compare pp. 10 and 29). The\r\nCannorrhaphida represent the former group among the PHÆODARIA. They differ\r\nfrom the following family, the Aulacanthida, in the arrangement and\r\nposition of the hollow spicula, which are never directed radially and never\r\ntouch the central capsule, as is constantly the case in the latter.\r\n\r\nTwo genera of Cannorrhaphida have been hitherto known. The first species\r\nobserved in a complete and living state (at Messina in 1859) was\r\n_Cannobelos cavispicula_, described in 1862 in my Monograph as\r\n_Thalassoplancta cavispicula_ (_loc. cit._, p. 261, Taf. iii. figs. 10-13).\r\nI there figured a complete living specimen with expanded pseudopodia and a\r\ndouble central capsule (in the stage of self-division). The latter was\r\nsurrounded by an {1547}alveolar calymma and by a voluminous mass of\r\nblackish-brown pigment, the phæodium; numerous, long, hollow, cylindrical\r\ntubes were scattered on the surface of the calymma. At that time I did not\r\nknow the tripylean character of the central capsule and the peculiar\r\nradiate operculum in the PHÆODARIA, and therefore placed _Thalassoplancta\r\ncavispicula_ among the Thalassosphærida.\r\n\r\nThe second description of a complete form of Cannorrhaphida was given in\r\n1879 by R. Hertwig, under the name _Dictyocha fibula_ (Organismus d.\r\nRadiol., p. 89, Taf. ix. fig. 5). The genus _Dictyocha_ had been already\r\nfounded by Ehrenberg in 1838, with the following definition:--\"Lorica\r\nsimplex, univalvis, silicea, laxe reticulata aut stellata\" (Abhandl. d. k.\r\nAkad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1838, p. 128). Ehrenberg had found only scattered\r\npieces of the skeleton, fossil in Tertiary rocks. He placed them among the\r\n_Bacillaria_ (= _Diatomaceæ_), but added, that they may be possibly\r\nscattered spicula of Sponges (\"forsan Spongiarum ossicula\").\r\n\r\nIn 1859 I myself observed similar forms of _Dictyocha_ at Messina, and\r\nfirst recognised them as true Radiolaria. But I placed them at that time\r\namong the Acanthodesmida, beside _Prismatium_, supposing that a small\r\nspherical body which I had sometimes seen in the cavity of the pileated\r\npieces (probably a phæodellum) was the small central capsule (Monogr. d.\r\nRadiol., 1862, p. 271, Taf. xii. figs. 3-6). The complete body of\r\n_Dictyocha_ was not described till 1879, when R. Hertwig gave a full\r\ndescription of its peculiar structure, and especially of the great central\r\ncapsule, which resembles that of the other PHÆODARIA. He first stated that\r\nthe singular pileated pieces described by Ehrenberg were not complete\r\nshells, but isolated pieces of the skeleton, which are scattered in the\r\njelly-envelope around the central capsule in a mode similar to the spicula\r\nof _Thalassoplancta_, _Thalassosphæra_ and _Sphærozoum_. Hertwig also first\r\nrecognised that the thin rods, which compose the reticular pileated pieces\r\nof the skeleton in _Dictyocha_, are not solid bars, but thin hollow\r\ntubules, similar to the hollow rods of _Aulacantha_ and of other PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\nNumerous complete and well-preserved specimens of _Dictyocha_, which I\r\nfound in the collection of the Challenger, have convinced me that the\r\naccurate description of R. Hertwig is correct in every respect, and that\r\nthese remarkable bodies are true PHÆODARIA, most closely allied to\r\n_Cannobelos_ (= _Thalassoplancta_) and to _Aulacantha_ (compare Pl. 101,\r\nfig. 10). I now regard them as representatives of a peculiar subfamily of\r\nCannorrhaphida, which I call Dictyochida. To the same subfamily also belong\r\nthe small annular bodies which Ehrenberg described in 1841 as _Mesocena_\r\n(_loc. cit._, p. 401), and the elegant, more complicated, reticular and\r\npileated bodies, which Stöhr figured in 1880 under the name _Distephanus_\r\n(Palæontogr., vol. xxvi. p. 121). These peculiar bodies are also only\r\nisolated pieces of the siliceous skeleton, and are scattered tangentially\r\nin great numbers in the calymma, around the tripylean central capsule. A\r\nstill higher degree of development is attained by the interesting forms\r\n{1548}which I describe here as _Cannopilus_ (Pl. 114, figs. 7-13). All\r\nthese peculiar forms may be derived from the simple annular pieces of\r\nskeleton, which are aggregated in great numbers in the calymma of\r\n_Mesocena_. The pieces of the skeleton of these Dictyochida never assume\r\nthe form of slender, cylindrical, tangential tubules which is\r\ncharacteristic of the Cannobelida.\r\n\r\nA third subfamily of Cannorrhaphida, the Catinulida, is represented by the\r\nremarkable new genus _Catinulus_ (Pl. 117, fig. 8). The single pieces of\r\nthe skeleton, scattered in hundreds or thousands throughout the calymma,\r\nare here not composed of hollow rods, as in the two former subfamilies, but\r\nare solid hemispherical caps, or small, more flatly vaulted dishes, with a\r\npeculiar radial striation. All the complete specimens of _Catinulus_ which\r\nI could examine possessed four equal central capsules, united in one\r\nspherical calymma.\r\n\r\nThe common character which unites the three rather different subfamilies,\r\nthe Cannobelida, Dictyochida and Catinulida into a single family, and which\r\nseparates this family, the Cannorrhaphida, from the other PHÆODARIA, is to\r\nbe found in the composition of the rudimentary skeleton from numerous\r\nsingle pieces, which are loosely scattered either on the surface of the\r\ncalymma, or throughout its jelly-mass, and which are never arranged\r\nradially and never touch the central capsule as is always the case in the\r\nclosely allied Aulacanthida.\r\n\r\nThe slender spicula of the Cannobelida are cylindrical or spindle-shaped,\r\ntubular, scattered in variable numbers, but always in a tangential\r\ndirection on the surface of the calymma. Usually they are 0.2 to 0.5 long,\r\nand 0.005 to 0.03 broad; either straight or slightly curved; smooth and\r\nsimple in _Cannobelos_, spiny or branched in _Cannorrhaphis_ (Pl. 101,\r\nfigs. 3-5). Their wall is thin and fragile, their diameter sometimes equal\r\nthroughout their whole length, at other times tapering towards both ends.\r\nTheir cavity is filled by jelly, and seems to be open at both ends, since\r\nthe purified and dried spicula constantly become filled by air.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar pieces of silica which compose the skeleton of the Catinulida\r\nare not hollow, like the rods of the other Cannorrhaphida, but concave\r\nhemispherical cups or more flatly vaulted little dishes, the thin flinty\r\nwall of which is slightly thickened at the circular margin, and radially\r\nstriped above it. In all three species of _Catinulus_ observed they were\r\nscattered throughout the calymma in hundreds or thousands (Pl. 117, fig.\r\n8). Their relation to the Dictyochida is doubtful. Perhaps the small cups\r\nof _Catinulus_ may be derived from the simple rings of _Mesocena_, by\r\ndevelopment of an operculum on one side of the ring.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the Dictyochida is much more developed and possesses a\r\nhigher morphological interest; the numerous different forms, however, which\r\nits pieces here assume, may be all derived from the simple circular ring of\r\n_Mesocena_. This ring is formed by a thin, hollow, cylindrical, or\r\nprismatic rod, sometimes circular or elliptical, at {1549}other times\r\npolygonal. From its margin small, hollow, radial spines often proceed (Pl.\r\n101, fig. 9). In _Dictyocha_ there arise from the ring two, three, four or\r\nmore siliceous bars or arches, which form one or more bulges over one side\r\nof the ring; usually the little fenestrated shell thus produced assumes the\r\nform of a three-sided or four-sided pyramid, or of a little hat with three\r\nor four meshes (Pl. 101, figs. 10-14). From this _Dictyocha_ (in a\r\nrestricted sense) we separate the genus _Distephanus_, in which the little\r\npyramids become truncated, so that one central apical mesh (the apical or\r\nupper ring) is surrounded by four, five, six or eight lateral meshes, the\r\nsides of the pyramid (Pl. 114, figs. 7-9). The edges of the small pyramid\r\nare formed by the same number of siliceous bars arising from the ring and\r\nalternating with the meshes. Radial spines in different numbers and\r\narrangements arise from the corners of the two parallel rings, as well from\r\nthe smaller apical as from the larger basal ring. The simple apical ring of\r\n_Distephanus_ becomes divided or fenestrated in the highest developed genus\r\nof this subfamily, in _Cannopilus_ (Pl. 114, figs. 10-13); each pileated\r\npiece of the skeleton exhibits here two rows of alternating lateral meshes,\r\nan upper row of smaller and a lower row of larger meshes.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Dictyochida are armed with spines or thorns, which arise in\r\na regular manner from different points of the annular or pileated pieces.\r\nIn the ancestral genus, _Mesocena_, radial spines start from the corners of\r\nthe simple ring in centrifugal direction, and lie horizontally in its\r\nplane. As these primary corner-spines determine the radial composition of\r\nthe more highly developed genera we call them perradial (lying in rays of\r\nthe first order). In _Dictyocha_ and _Distephanus_ commonly (but not quite\r\nconstantly) these perradial spines alternate with the ascending bars which\r\nbisect the sides of the basal ring; these bars are therefore interradial\r\n(lying in rays of the second order); consequently also the corners of the\r\napical ring of _Distephanus_ are interradial. The latter also often bear\r\nsmall thorns or teeth. Other teeth frequently start in centripetal\r\ndirection from the lower or basal ring, on the side of the perradial\r\nspines, and frequently they are directed obliquely downwards.\r\n\r\nIn _Dictyocha_ and _Distephanus_ are frequently found remarkable twin\r\npieces, composed of two pileated and reticulated skeleton pieces. These are\r\nunited by their basal rings loosely in such a way that they form together a\r\nsmall fenestrated subspherical body; the union is strengthened by those\r\nsmall teeth of the basal rings, which are directed downwards and catch one\r\ninto the other (Pl. 101, fig. 12; Pl. 114, fig. 8). A similar twin piece\r\nhas been already observed by Stöhr in the fossil _Distephanus rotundus_,\r\nand upon this was founded this genus. Since the teeth of the two opposed\r\nbasal rings, catching one into the other, seem to be specially adapted for\r\nthe composition of those small double pyramids, it is probable that the\r\nlatter possess a special protective function in these PHÆODARIA, and\r\nperhaps envelop their phæodella or their flagellate spores (?). In every\r\ncase these formations are very remarkable.\r\n\r\n{1550}_The Central Capsule_ of the Cannorrhaphida seems to possess the same\r\nshape in the three subfamilies, and to agree in general with that of the\r\nAulacanthida. In a living specimen of _Dictyocha stapedia_, which I\r\nobserved at Ceylon (Pl. 101, fig. 10), the three openings of the TRIPYLEA\r\nwere distinct; the radiate operculum of the astropyle (on the oral pole)\r\nwas surrounded by the granules of the dark phæodium, whilst on the opposite\r\naboral side, two parapylæ or conical secondary openings were visible. The\r\nvoluminous spherical calymma (about four times as broad as the central\r\ncapsule) contained numerous large alveoles (as in _Aulosphæra_) and its\r\nsurface was protected by numerous pileated pieces of the skeleton; the\r\nbasal ring of the latter was placed tangentially in the spherical surface\r\nof the calymma, their apical spine being directed outwards. The\r\npseudopodia, arising from the central capsule and forming a network between\r\nthe alveoles of the calymma, radiated outwards in great number from its\r\nsurface (Pl. 101, fig. 10).\r\n\r\nThe propagation by self-division seems to be very frequent in the\r\nCannorrhaphida. I frequently found two equal central capsules in one\r\ncalymma, as in the first observed species, _Cannobelos cavispicula_, and in\r\n_Cannorrhaphis spinulosa_ (Pl. 101, fig. 3), sometimes also in _Dictyocha_\r\nand _Distephanus_. As already mentioned, _Catinulus_ constantly exhibited\r\nfour central capsules united in each calymma.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Cannorrhaphida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Akad. d. Wiss.\r\nBerlin, p. 401.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Cannorrhaphida# with a skeleton composed of simple annular\r\npieces, each of which is a circular, elliptical or polygonal, not\r\nfenestrated, ring, with or without radial spines.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Mesocena_ is the simplest form of the Dictyochida, and no doubt\r\nthe common ancestral form of this subfamily. The siliceous pieces, which\r\nare scattered in variable and indefinite number in the calymma, are simple\r\nhollow rings, with or without spines on the periphery. Ehrenberg, who first\r\ndescribed and figured such rings (found fossil in different Tertiary rocks)\r\nhas mistaken them for Diatoms. Some species, which I found in the\r\nChallenger preparations, leave no doubt that these rings are the siliceous\r\npieces of the skeleton of the simplest Dictyochida. They are scattered in\r\ngreat numbers in the spherical calymma, which surrounds a tripylean central\r\ncapsule with all the characters of the PHÆODARIA. In the living body the\r\nrings probably always lie in the spherical periphery of the extracapsular\r\njelly-veil, in tangential planes, whilst in some of the Challenger\r\npreparations the rings were scattered in hundreds throughout the whole\r\njelly-mass. In a few species the rings are quite simple, circular or\r\nelliptical, smooth, and without teeth or spines. In the majority of species\r\nsome teeth or radial spines, regularly disposed, arise from the periphery\r\nof each ring (two, three, four to eight; sometimes sixteen, eight smaller\r\nalternating with eight larger spines). In some species small teeth occur on\r\nthe inner margin of the rings. The number of radial spines seems to be\r\nrather constant in all the rings of one and the same individual, with the\r\nexception of a few variations. Thus in _Mesocena octogona_ I found here and\r\nthere single rings with seven or nine teeth, instead of the usual number\r\neight. Ehrenberg enumerated sixteen different species of _Mesocena_; many,\r\nhowever, of these are synonymous, being founded on slight variations in the\r\nnumber of the teeth; of others he has given only the name, but neither a\r\nfigure nor a description (_e.g._, _Mesocena stephanolithis_, _Mesocena\r\nspongolithis_, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n{1555}1. _Mesocena circulus_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Mesocena circulus_, Ehrenberg, 1840, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.

Wiss. Berlin, p. 128.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Cannorrhaphida# with a skeleton composed of annular pieces,\r\nwhich are fenestrated by one or more arches, arising on one side of the\r\nsimple ring, but do not form a truncated pyramid (therefore no apical\r\nring).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Dictyocha_ is a very remarkable and interesting form of\r\nPHÆODARIA, which has had a curious history. Ehrenberg, who first observed\r\nsingle pieces of it fossil in Tertiary rocks, supposed it to be the\r\nsiliceous carapace of a Diatom, and gave it the following {1558}diagnosis:\r\n\"Dictyocha, e familia Bacillariorum. Lorica simplex univalvis silicea, laxe\r\nreticulata aut stellulata\" (_loc. cit._). In my Monograph (1862, p. 271), I\r\nplaced it in the class Radiolaria, supposing that it might be a simple form\r\nof Acanthodesmida, having found only isolated siliceous pieces. Afterwards\r\n(in 1879) Richard Hertwig observed the entire living body, and demonstrated\r\nthat the hollow siliceous pieces are scattered in great numbers around a\r\ntripylean central capsule, which exhibits all the essential characters of\r\nPHÆODARIA (Organismus d. Radiol., 1879, p. 89). Hertwig describes the\r\nposition of the numerous siliceous pieces in the surface of the\r\nextracapsular jelly-sphere so densely aggregated, that they touch one\r\nanother and produce the appearance of a reticulated sphere. In two\r\nspecimens, which I observed living (Pl. 101, fig. 10), and in numerous\r\ncomplete specimens which I found in the collection of the Challenger, the\r\nnumber of the siliceous pieces was much smaller, and they were scattered\r\nirregularly in the surface of the alveolate jelly-sphere, being separated\r\nby wide and unequal intervals. The regular position seems to be that the\r\nbasal rings lie tangentially in the spherical surface of the calymma,\r\nwhilst the bars of the reticulum are directed outwards, and the apical\r\nspine radially in centrifugal direction. Very often two pieces are united\r\nby their basal rings in such a manner that they form a little spheroidal\r\nfenestrated body (as in _Distephanus_, Stöhr; compare p. 1550). The\r\ncharacteristic reticular skeleton-pieces of _Dictyocha_ must be derived\r\nfrom _Mesocena_; from its simple siliceous ring (on one side of its plane),\r\narise two, three, or four (rarely more) bars, which become united to a\r\nloose framework (with two, three, or four meshes). When this network\r\nassumes the form of a truncated pyramid (with a central mesh on the apex),\r\n_Dictyocha_ passes over into _Distephanus_. From the corners of the\r\noriginal basal ring several radial spines usually arise in a centrifugal\r\ndirection, and on the sides of these sometimes small teeth or thorns also\r\nrun in a centripetal direction. The number of the meshes and the separating\r\nrods is usually four, more rarely two or three. The hollow rods are very\r\nthin, either cylindrical or prismatic. As the ascending rods alternate\r\nregularly with the corner-spines of the basal ring, we may call the latter\r\nperradial, the former interradial. Ehrenberg has distinguished in his genus\r\n_Dictyocha_ not less than fifty species, thirty-five living and twenty-five\r\nfossil (ten species both living and fossil). The greater part of these\r\ncannot be retained, as they are only slight varieties or abnormalities of\r\nsingle pieces of the skeleton, such as very frequently occur associated\r\nwith the common regular forms in one and the same individual. Such abnormal\r\nspecies are, _e.g._, _Dictyocha abnormis_, _Dictyocha binoculus_,\r\n_Dictyocha bipartita_, _Dictyocha haliomma_, _Dictyocha hexathyra_,\r\n_Dictyocha septenaria_, &c. One species (_Dictyocha splendens_), is the\r\nfenestrated calcareous body of a Holothurian. Of some other species\r\nEhrenberg has only given the name, but neither a description nor a figure\r\n(e.g., _Dictyocha borealis_, _Dictyocha cenostephania_, _Dictyocha compos_,\r\n_Dictyocha coronata_, _Dictyocha socialis_, _Dictyocha specillum_). A\r\nnumber of other species must be placed in the genera _Distephanus_ and\r\n_Cannopilus_, so that only eight of his species of true _Dictyocha_ remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1559}1. _Dictyocha navicula_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Dictyocha navicula_, Ehrenberg, 1838, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.

Taf.\r\nii. p. 121.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Cannorrhaphida# with a skeleton composed of pileated\r\npieces, each of which is a small truncated pyramid with one girdle of\r\nmeshes (the apical ring being simple).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Distephanus_ was founded in 1880 by Stöhr (_loc. cit._) for a\r\nsingle twin-piece of the skeleton of _Dictyocha speculum_. Among the common\r\nfossil forms of this species he once found in the Tertiary rocks of\r\nCaltanisetta, Sicily, a single piece (_loc. cit._, Taf. vi. fig. 9), which\r\nseemed to be composed of two equal pieces so united that they formed a\r\nlittle sphere with fourteen meshes; on each pole of the sphere lies a\r\ncentral hexagonal mesh surrounded by six pentagonal meshes, and from the\r\nsix corners of the equatorial ring arise six centrifugal spines. No doubt\r\nthis was a mistake, and the apparent little sphere was one of the above\r\nmentioned twin-forms, composed of two separate hexagonal truncated\r\npyramids, which were loosely connected by their basal rings. I have often\r\nseen such twin-pieces of _Dictyocha speculum_ and of other species (Pl.\r\n101, fig. 12, Pl. 114, fig. 8), and was always able to separate the two\r\nloosely connected halves of the bivalve shell by slight compression.\r\n\r\n{1563}The genus _Distephanus_ of Stöhr, therefore, is nothing other than\r\nthe _Dictyocha_ of Ehrenberg. But I think it is more convenient to retain\r\nthe name _Distephanus_ for those forms of _Dictyocha_ which possess a\r\nsimple apical mesh surrounded by a ring of lateral meshes, and in which\r\neach piece of the skeleton forms a small truncated pyramid. The basal plane\r\nof this pyramid is marked by the original basal ring (_Mesocena_), the\r\ntruncated upper plane by the parallel apical ring, and the edges of the\r\npyramid by the rising bars which connect both rings. In this sense, so far\r\nas the two rings lying in parallel planes are concerned, the term\r\n_Distephanus_ is correct (but not in the original sense of Stöhr). The\r\nnumber of the rising bars between the two rings varies from four, five, six\r\nto eight or more. It seems rather constant in each species, so that all the\r\npieces of the skeleton of one specimen possess either four or six or eight\r\nlateral meshes, &c. But sometimes individual irregularities occur. In the\r\nmajority of species each skeleton-piece is armed with spines. Usually a\r\nradial horizontal spine starts centrifugally from each corner of the basal\r\nring, and on the side of this a small tooth or thorn often starts\r\ncentripetally or downwards. In the twin-pieces, where the two basal rings\r\nare united, these teeth catch into one another. In some species upper\r\nspines also occur, starting from the corners of the apical ring. The\r\nperradial spines of the corners of the basal ring alternate regularly with\r\nthe interradial ascending bars, which bisect the sides of the ring, as in\r\n_Dictyocha_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Distephanus crux_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Dictyocha crux_, Ehrenberg, 1840, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.

Each piece of the skeleton is a little fenestrated hat or\r\ntopped pyramid, as in _Distephanus_. But the apical mesh is simple in the\r\nlatter, in the former it is divided into several meshes by bars which start\r\nin a centripetal direction from the upper ring. Therefore we find two\r\nannular rows of meshes, one above the other; an apical or upper row of\r\nsmaller meshes and a basal or lower row of larger meshes. In the apex of\r\nthe little {1568}hat is either a central mesh or an apical spine. Other\r\nspines arise from the basal ring, as in the former genera. The number of\r\ncorner-spines on the basal ring is either four, six, or eight (in\r\nindividual abnormalities also five or seven).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Cannopilus superstructus_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Dictyocha superstructa_, Ehrenberg, 1844, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.

Radiol., p. 262.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with an incomplete skeleton, composed of numerous\r\nhollow radial tubes, which pierce the spherical calymma and touch with\r\ntheir proximal ends the surface of the tripylean central capsule.\r\n\r\nThe family #Aulacanthida# represents a large and interesting group of\r\nPHÆODARIA, differing from all other families of this legion in the\r\npossession of numerous large radial tubes, which pierce the gelatinous and\r\nalveolated calymma in a radial direction, and come in contact with the\r\nouter surface of the central capsule by their inner or proximal ends,\r\nwhilst their outer or distal ends project over the surface of the spherical\r\ncalymma, and develop a great variety of manifold branches and terminal\r\nappendages. Usually (with the exception of a single genus only) the surface\r\nof the calymma is covered by an {1570}arachnoidal veil or mantle, composed\r\nof thousands of very fine, hollow, tangential needles. The skeleton\r\ntherefore is incomplete, without any direct connection between the isolated\r\npieces, just as in the preceding Cannorrhaphida, but the latter never\r\npossess the large, hollow, cylindrical, radial tubes, which are\r\ncharacteristic of all Aulacanthida.\r\n\r\nThe spherical body of the Aulacanthida has usually a diameter of 1 to 2\r\nmm., and including the radial tubes, of 4 to 5 mm. or more. Some species\r\nare very common and cosmopolitan, and some genera contain numerous species,\r\ndistributed widely over all oceans. In spite of their considerable size and\r\nwide distribution, only one species of this great family has been hitherto\r\nknown, having been discovered by me at Messina in 1859, and described in my\r\nMonograph as _Aulacantha scolymantha_ (1862, p. 263, Taf. ii. figs. 1, 2,\r\nand Taf. iv. figs. 1-5). I there founded for it the peculiar subfamily\r\nAulacanthida, and annexed it to the Thalassicollida. The same cosmopolitan\r\nspecies has been subsequently observed at Messina by R. Hertwig, who first\r\nrecognised the three openings in its central capsule, and therefore united\r\nit with his TRIPYLEA (Organism. d. Radiol., 1879, p. 88, Taf. ix. figs. 3,\r\n4; Taf. x. figs. 7, 10). The rich collection of the Challenger has added an\r\nastonishing number of new and interesting forms of Aulacanthida, so that I\r\ncan describe here not less than six genera and fifty-eight species. The\r\nmajority are inhabitants of the colder parts of the South Pacific and South\r\nAtlantic, at great depths, whilst a few species only are found in the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the body in all Aulacanthida seems to be similar in all\r\nimportant points, and the differences by which we are enabled to separate\r\nthis great number of species are mainly produced by differences in the\r\ndevelopment of the radial tubes, their form and their polymorphous\r\napophyses. The entire body represents a rather firm jelly-sphere of 1 to 2\r\nmm. diameter (rarely less or more); the peripheral layer of the spherical\r\ncalymma is rather clear and transparent, whilst its central part is dark\r\nand opaque, containing the big phæodium and the enclosed central capsule.\r\nThe diameter of the latter is usually between 0.1 and 0.3, often 0.4 to\r\n0.5, or even more. The gelatinous calymma, in the centre of which the\r\ncapsule is placed, always contains numerous, large, spherical or roundish\r\nalveoles, similar to those of _Thalassicolla_, and between them a delicate\r\nnetwork of sarcode (Pl. 102, fig. 1; Pl. 103, fig. 1; Pl. 104, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe spherical surface of the calymma is nearly always protected by that\r\ncharacteristic arachnoidal veil or mantle, which is composed of thousands\r\nof very fine tangential needles, densely interwoven in all tangential\r\ndirections but never directly connected. They are wanting in a single genus\r\nonly, in _Aulactinium_ (Pl. 101, figs. 6-8). This genus, therefore, may\r\nrepresent a separate subfamily, the Aulactinida, whilst all other genera\r\nprotected by that mantle constitute the subfamily Aulographida. The\r\ntangential needles always seem to have the same shape as I have accurately\r\ndescribed, in 1862, of _Aulacantha scolymantha_. They are constantly\r\nsmooth, very thin and fragile, but also very elastic cylinders of silica,\r\nof equal breadth throughout their whole length, and seem {1571}to be open\r\nat both ends, since they are easily and constantly filled by air when\r\ndried. Their length is usually between 0.2 and 0.3 mm., rarely less than\r\n0.15 or more than 0.5; their diameter is always less than 0.001, usually\r\nless than 0.0005.\r\n\r\nThe large radial tubes of the Aulacanthida constitute the most\r\ncharacteristic structures of this family, and are always so placed that\r\ntheir inner or proximal ends are in loose contact with the outer surface of\r\ntheir central capsule (upon which they rest), whilst their outer or distal\r\nends are more or less prominent over the spherical surface of the calymma.\r\nTheir position, therefore, is rather loose and movable, since they are\r\nfixed only by the consistence of the jelly of the surrounding calymma, and\r\non the surface of the latter by the covering veil or the mantle of\r\ntangential needles (compare Pl. 102, fig. 1; Pl. 103, fig. 1; Pl. 104, fig.\r\n1). Their number seems never to be fixed, and is probably very variable in\r\ndifferent species. I found, in 1859, in the common _Aulacantha\r\nscolymantha_, the number varying from thirty to one hundred and fifty\r\n(_loc. cit._, p. 264). So also in _Aulographis pandora_, _Aulospathis\r\nvariabilis_, and some other common species, numerous specimens of which I\r\ncould compare, I found their number very variable, being in one and the\r\nsame species sometimes only from ten to twenty, at other times from fifty\r\nto eighty, and sometimes even from one hundred to one hundred and fifty or\r\nmore. Perhaps the number increases with the age and the increasing size of\r\nthe calymma.\r\n\r\nThe radial tubes are always cylindrical (circular in transverse section),\r\nnever angular or prismatic. Usually they are straight, more rarely slightly\r\ncurved (Pl. 105, figs. 1, 2; Pl. 101, fig. 6). The cylinders are usually\r\nmore or less tapering towards both ends, sometimes even spindle-shaped; the\r\ninner or proximal end is always simple and rounded, often slightly swollen\r\nor inflated, and ovate; the outer or distal end is often thickened,\r\nclub-shaped, and exhibits the greatest variety in form and ramification.\r\nThe length of the radial tubes is usually from 1 to 3 mm., rarely less than\r\n0.8, or more than 3.2; their diameter is usually between 0.02 and 0.03,\r\nrarely less than 0.01 or more than 0.05. The smallest radial tubes are\r\nfound in _Aulactinium_, the largest in _Aulospathis_.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous wall of the cylindrical radial tubes is usually very thin,\r\nfragile, and perfectly structureless. Only in a few species, mainly of\r\n_Aulographis_, does the wall become very thick and composed of concentric\r\ncylindrical layers (Pl. 105, figs. 6-11). Their cavity is wide and simple,\r\nand filled up by jelly (not by sarcode, as I supposed in my first\r\ndescription). The simple cavity of the tubes, though not smaller than in\r\nthe radial tubes of the Aulosphærida, Circoporida and Tuscarorida, never\r\ncontains the characteristic axial filament with its branches, which is\r\nconstantly found in the latter families. According to the description of R.\r\nHertwig, the tubes are perfectly closed and have no opening. I suppose,\r\nhowever, that a small opening always exists in the centre of the rounded\r\nbase, and perhaps a second on the distal apex. Otherwise the circumstance\r\nthat the entire and well-preserved tubes become easily and constantly\r\nfilled {1572}up by air, when purified by hot mineral acids and afterwards\r\ndried, cannot be explained. I suppose that the jelly contained in the\r\ncavity of the tubes remains in constant connection by these openings with\r\nthe jelly of the surrounding calymma.\r\n\r\nThe distal ends of the radial tubes exhibit in the Aulacanthida the\r\ngreatest variety in the production of different branches and capturing\r\napparatus, and this serves for the distinction of the genera and subgenera\r\nhere described. In two genera only (in _Aulactinium_ Pl. 101, figs. 6-8;\r\nand in _Aulacantha_, Pl. 105, fig. 16), the distal ends are simple, not\r\nbranched. In the four other genera they are armed with terminal branches,\r\nwhich are usually arranged in elegant verticils. The greatest variety in\r\nthe formation of these verticils is developed in _Aulographis_ (Pl. 103).\r\nThe single branches of the terminal verticils are here simple, whilst in\r\nthe closely allied _Auloceros_ they are forked or elegantly ramified (Pl.\r\n102). _Aulospathis_, the biggest of all Aulacanthida, is distinguished by\r\nthe possession of a verticil of lateral branches, placed beyond the\r\nterminal verticil, immediately above the veil of tangential needles (Pl.\r\n104). _Aulodendron_, finally, possesses lateral and terminal branches,\r\nwhich are irregularly scattered.\r\n\r\nThe branches of the radial tubes are rarely straight, usually more or less\r\ncurved, either simple or again ramified. Their surface is either smooth or\r\narmed with small spines or recurved teeth, often elegantly dentated or\r\nserrated (Pl. 103, figs. 20-27; Pl. 105, figs. 7-13). Their distal ends are\r\neither simply pointed or armed with a spathilla, or a small crown of\r\nverticillate, usually recurved teeth (Pl. 104, figs. 4-17). The variety and\r\nelegance of these minute armatures are very interesting, the more so as\r\nthey occur in very similar and analogous forms among the Aulosphærida, the\r\nCoelographida, and other PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Aulosphærida and its large nucleus\r\n(\"Binnenbläschen\"), as well as the surrounding alveolate calymma\r\n(\"Alveolen-Hülle\"), and the enclosed dark phæodium (\"dunkels Pigment\") were\r\nfirst described in my Monograph (1862, _loc. cit._, p. 362). Their minute\r\nstructure has been examined afterwards very accurately by R. Hertwig (1879,\r\n_loc. cit._, p. 95). The numerous well-preserved preparations of the\r\nChallenger (stained with carmine and preserved in glycerine) which I could\r\nexamine, confirmed in all respects the detailed description of Hertwig\r\n(compare Pl. 102, fig. 1; Pl. 103, fig. 1; Pl. 104, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe spherical or subspherical central capsule is usually slightly depressed\r\nin the shortened main axis. Its diameter is usually between 0.1 and 0.3,\r\nrarely less than 0.08 or more than 0.4 mm. Its outer membrane (_e_) is\r\nthick and double-contoured, separated by a clear interval from the very\r\nthin but firm inner membrane (_i_). The large astropyle, or the\r\nmain-opening on the oral pole of the main axis, is closed by a large,\r\nconvex, radiate operculum (_o_), from which arises a short tubular\r\nproboscis. On both sides of the opposite aboral pole (to the right and\r\nleft) are two conical parapylæ or secondary openings (_u, u_).  The space\r\nbetween the inner membrane of the capsule and {1573}the nucleus is filled\r\nup by protoplasm, containing numerous spherical vacuoles of equal size\r\n(_v_); each vacuole encloses a small, dark, fat-granule. The large nucleus\r\n(_n_) is either spherical or lenticular, and more or less depressed in the\r\nmain axis; its diameter is usually about half as great as that of the\r\nenclosing capsule, 0.05 to 0.15, rarely less or more; it contains, enclosed\r\nin a clear mass, numerous dark, roundish or oblongish nucleoli (_l_).\r\n\r\nNumerous preparations of Aulacanthida exhibited a central capsule with two\r\nnuclei (Pl. 101, fig. 6), or a calymma with two central capsules (Pl. 104,\r\nfigs. 1, 3); so that the process of propagation by self-division, observed\r\nalready in many different PHÆODARIA, seems to happen very frequently in the\r\nAulacanthida. The voluminous phæodium is usually about twice or three times\r\nas large as the central capsule, and covers its oral or anterior half; the\r\ncolour of the roundish phæodella composing it is sometimes more green or\r\nbrown, at other times more blackish. The roundish alveoles, which fill up\r\nthe rather firm jelly of the calymma, exhibit nearly the same shape as in\r\nthe common _Thalassicolla nucleata_. The surface of the calymma is usually\r\nprotected by the dense veil of tangential needles, and often forms conical\r\nor tent-shaped elevations around the bases of the piercing radial tubes\r\n(Pl. 102, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Aulacanthida._\r\n\r\n                          { Surface of the calymma\r\n                          {  naked, without tangential\r\n                          {  needles,                   665. _Aulactinium_.\r\n  Radial tubes simple,    {\r\n   without lateral and    { Surface of the calymma\r\n   terminal branches.     {  covered by a veil of\r\n                          {  tangential needles,        666. _Aulacantha_.\r\n\r\n  Radial tubes without    { Terminal branches simple,   667. _Aulographis_.\r\n   lateral branches, but  {\r\n   with a verticil of     { Terminal branches forked\r\n   terminal branches.     {  or again ramified,         668. _Auloceros_.\r\n\r\n                          { Lateral branches\r\n  Radial tubes with       {  verticillate,              669. _Aulospathis_.\r\n   lateral and with       {\r\n   terminal branches.     { Lateral branches\r\n                          {  irregularly scattered,\r\n                          {  not verticillate,          670. _Aulodendron_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubfamily 1.

PHÆOSPHÆRIA, Haeckel, 1879.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a simple or double, usually spherical\r\nlattice-shell, which is not bivalved and has no peculiar mouth or\r\nperistome. Central capsule placed in the centre of the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily LXXIV. #OROSPHÆRIDA#, n. fam. (Pls. 106, 107).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a big spherical (sometimes polyhedral or\r\nellipsoidal), very coarse shell, which is composed of thick bars containing\r\nan axial canal. Nodal points of the coarse network without astral septa.\r\nMeshes of moderate size, irregularly polygonal. Surface of the shell\r\nusually with radial spines and pyramidal elevations. No peculiar mouth in\r\nthe shell. Central capsule tripylean, in the centre of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Orosphærida# comprises those PHÆODARIA which possess a simple\r\nspherical or polyhedral lattice-shell, composed of hollow, very thick,\r\nnon-articulate rods, without a peculiar shell-mouth. They agree in the\r\nconsiderable size of the spherical lattice-shell and the absence of a\r\npeculiar shell-mouth with the other #Phæosphæria#, but differ from them in\r\nthe coarse and irregular shape of the massive network, which is composed of\r\nirregular polygonal meshes, separated by very thick concentrically\r\nstratified rods, containing a fine axial canal. The closely allied\r\nSagosphærida differ from them in the delicate shape of the solid and very\r\nthin, filiform rods of the network, and its subregular {1591}triangular\r\nmeshes. The Aulosphærida differ in the development of the peculiar nodal\r\ncavities and astral septa, by which the thin-walled cylindrical tubes of\r\nthe articulated network are separated in the stellate nodal points. The\r\nCannosphærida, closely allied to these latter, also differ in the\r\narticulated network, and further in the possession of an internal\r\nconcentric shell. The Castanellida are sometimes similar to the\r\nOrosphærida, but distinguished by a peculiar large shell-mouth and a\r\nnetwork of different shape.\r\n\r\nThe Orosphærida belong to the biggest Radiolaria, and the lattice-work of\r\ntheir spherical shell is of a ruder and coarser shape than in any of the\r\nother families of this class. Nevertheless they have been hitherto\r\nperfectly unknown, and were first discovered by the Challenger. We have\r\nbeen able to distinguish in the collection four genera and twenty-seven\r\nspecies. This strange fact may be explained by the circumstance, that they\r\nare in general rare, and restricted to a few localities, and that probably\r\nall the species are inhabitants of great depths. Complete shells also are\r\nrarely found, whilst broken fragments of their big shells, easily\r\nrecognisable by the coarse irregular meshes and the thick stratified bars,\r\nare met with frequently in the Radiolarian ooze of some Pacific Stations,\r\nespecially at Stations 265 and 268, at a depth of 2900 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe lattice-shell of the Orosphærida is usually spherical, or an\r\nendospherical polyhedron (Pl. 106, fig. 4); rarely one axis is somewhat\r\nprolonged, so that the shell becomes slightly ellipsoidal (Pl. 106, fig.\r\n1). Its diameter is usually between 2 and 3, often also between 2 and 1\r\nmm., rarely more than 3, or less than 1 mm. The largest shells observed\r\nattained 5 to 6, the smallest 0.5 to 0.6 mm. Their general habit is very\r\ncharacteristic, so that they may be easily distinguished from all other\r\nspherical lattice-shells, especially from the Castanellida and from the\r\nsimple Monosphærida (_Cenosphæra_, _Acanthosphæra_), with which I\r\nconfounded them in the beginning (hence the first shell observed, figured\r\nin 1878, was placed among the Monosphærida in Pl. 12). A closer examination\r\nof the coarse network and of the peculiar structure of its thick bars\r\nalways enables one to recognise even small isolated fragments of broken\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThe meshes of the coarse network exhibit in all observed Orosphærida a very\r\nirregular form and unequal size; the majority are usually more or less\r\nquadrangular, more rarely they are triangular, pentagonal or hexagonal,\r\nvery rarely rounded. They are often arranged in parallel rows, which seem\r\nto be determined by prominent crests, connecting the bases of the radial\r\nspines (Pl. 12, fig. 1; Pl. 106, fig. 4, &c.). The diameter of the meshes\r\nis usually between 0.05 and 0.1, often 0.1 to 0.2, rarely more than 0.25,\r\nor less than 0.025 mm. In _Oroplegma_, which develops an outer loose,\r\nspongy shell around the inner primary shell, the big meshes of the former\r\nbecome much larger and very irregular (Pl. 107, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe coarse bars which separate the large meshes of the irregular network\r\nare very thick and massive, cylindrical, usually of unequal thickness,\r\nstraight or slightly curved, never angular or prismatic. Their diameter is\r\nusually between 0.01 and 0.02, rarely {1592}more than 0.03 or less than\r\n0.005 mm. Their surface is either smooth or slightly spinulate. Examined in\r\nthe dry state and by strong lenses, they constantly exhibit a fine, but\r\ndistinct longitudinal striation, as the expression of concentric\r\nstratification. A fine axial canal or central tubule is usually visible in\r\nthe axis of each rod, and often this axial canal is studded with numerous\r\nshort lateral branches (Pl. 107, figs. 2, 4, 8). But very often the axial\r\ncanals become rudimentary or lost, or are developed only in a part of the\r\nbars (Pl. 12, fig. 1). When they are completely developed, the entire\r\nnetwork of the shell is drained by a reticulate system of communicating\r\naxial canals; they are probably filled by jelly in the living body. This\r\ntubular system never attains that regularity and high development which is\r\nconstantly found in the Aulosphærida; and the characteristic stellate nodal\r\npoints of the latter, with their astral septa, are never found in any of\r\nthe Orosphærida. Moreover the wall of the tubular bars is very thin and\r\nstructureless in the Aulosphærida, very thick and stratified in the\r\nOrosphærida, the enclosed canal very wide in the former, very narrow in the\r\nlatter. The stratification of the concentric cylindrical lamellæ, which\r\nsurround the narrow axial canal, is effected by the gradual deposition of\r\nthe concentric layers, and is very similar to that which is found in the\r\nthick spicula of many sponges. The peculiar structure of the bars in the\r\nOrosphærida becomes very distinct if the skeleton be burned, or acted upon\r\nby fire for some time; it then assumes a brown colour and its surface often\r\nappears dimpled. Sometimes the concave dimples on the surface of the bars\r\nare rather deep and separated by prominent crests (Pl. 107, figs. 4, 7).\r\nThe few genera of Orosphærida which are here distinguished have all the\r\nsame structure, are closely allied, and differ mainly in the shape of the\r\nouter surface of the lattice-sphere. The latter is quite simple and smooth\r\nonly in _Orona_. In the common _Orosphæra_ (Pl. 106, figs. 1-3) it is\r\nstudded with radial spines. In the most frequent form, _Oroscena_, the\r\nshell has a pyramidal or tent-shaped elevation on the base of each radial\r\nspine, and usually the bases of the neighbouring spines are connected by\r\nstrong prominent crests, the edges of the three-sided or four-sided\r\npyramids (Pl. 12, fig. 1; Pl. 106, fig. 4). This remarkable form is more or\r\nless polyhedral, with concave sides, and is similar to the characteristic\r\nshells which are represented by _Auloscena_ among the Aulosphærida, by\r\n_Sagoscena_ and _Sagoplegma_ among the Sagosphærida (compare Pls. 108 and\r\n110). The pyramids or tents, however, are in these latter more regularly\r\nand distinctly developed than in the Orosphærida. The radial spines which\r\narise form the top of the pyramids are often branched, and the branches\r\nbecome connected to form an outer enveloping secondary shell or a loose\r\nspongy framework in _Oroplegma_ (Pl. 107, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe radial spines of the Orosphærida never exhibit a constant number or\r\ndisposition in the individual species; their usual number is from twenty to\r\nsixty. Their form exhibits two different types, which, however, are not\r\nsharply separated; robust club-shaped and slender rod-shaped spines. The\r\nrobust club-shaped spines are usually about as long as {1593}the diameter\r\nof the shell; they are longitudinally striped in the basal part, spinulate\r\nor reticulately dimpled in the distal part; sometimes they are straight, at\r\nother times curved or undulate (Pl. 106, figs. 1-4; Pl. 107, figs. 4-6).\r\nThe slender rod-shaped spines are usually longer than the diameter of the\r\nshell, cylindrical, more or less curved or even undulate, smooth or thorny,\r\nsometimes irregularly branched, and often the branches are all or partly\r\nconnected (Pl. 106, fig. 3; Pl. 107, fig. 1). In the majority of the shells\r\nobserved the radial spines were found to be partly broken off. Their\r\nstructure is the same as that of the bars of the network; but the central\r\naxial canal and the surrounding concentric lamellæ are usually more\r\ndistinct than in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule of the Orosphærida lies in the centre of the spherical\r\nlattice-shell, surrounded by the voluminous calymma, which fills up its\r\ncavity. The form, structure, and size of the central capsule are the same\r\nas in the closely allied Aulosphærida (Pl. 111, fig. 2). Its diameter is\r\nusually about 0.2, or between 0.15 and 0.25, rarely more than 0.3 or less\r\nthan 0.12. The dark phæodium is of about the same volume as the central\r\ncapsule, and envelops its oral half with the radiate operculum and the\r\nproboscis of the astropyle. The two opposite parapylæ are small.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Orosphærida._\r\n\r\n  I.

(Pl. 108).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a large spherical (or sometimes polyhedral),\r\nvery delicate shell, which is composed of solid, very thin and long\r\nthreads. Nodal points of the arachnoidal network without astral septa.\r\nMeshes large, triangular. Surface of the shell usually armed with radial\r\nspines and often studded with pyramidal elevations. No peculiar mouth in\r\nthe shell. Central capsule tripylean, in the centre of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Sagosphærida# comprises a rather large number of common and\r\nwidely distributed PHÆODARIA, which in respect of the special form and\r\ndifferentiation of the shell exhibit the greatest similarity to the common\r\nAulosphærida, but differ essentially from them in the peculiar structure of\r\nthe network. This is not composed of stout hollow cylindrical tubes, but of\r\nsolid, very thin threads; and these fine arachnoidal {1602}threads are\r\nsimply united or confluent at the nodal points, and are not connected by a\r\nradial or stellate septal junction, as in the Aulosphærida. There are,\r\ntherefore, neither astral septa nor a nodal cavity in each nodal point. The\r\ndelicate shape of the thin and fragile threads separates the Sagosphærida\r\nfrom the closely allied Orosphærida, the thick bars of which contain a\r\ncentral axial canal and exhibit a concentric structure. Another difference\r\nbetween these two similar families is indicated by the form of the meshes\r\nof the network, which are constantly triangular in the Sagosphærida, but\r\nirregularly polygonal or quadrangular in the Orosphærida. The general habit\r\nof these two families, however, is very different, since the big and stout\r\nspheres of the Orosphærida are the coarsest and rudest spherical shells of\r\nall Radiolaria, whilst the fragile and delicate spheres of the Sagosphærida\r\nrepresent the finest and most tender in the whole class.\r\n\r\nThe spherical lattice-shell of the Sagosphærida has a considerable size,\r\nits diameter being usually between one and three millimetres, rarely less\r\nor more. Some species are very common and widely distributed, usually\r\naccompanying the common Aulosphærida; very frequently the similar shells of\r\nthe two are found interwoven. But in spite of this frequency and visible\r\nsize, the Sagosphærida have hitherto almost completely escaped the\r\nattention of observers. The main cause of this strange fact may be their\r\nextreme delicacy and fragibility, so that complete and intact shells occur\r\nvery rarely, the majority being more or less broken and incomplete. It\r\nseems that only two species of Sagosphærida have been hitherto observed.\r\n\r\nThe first form described is _Sagmarium trigonizon_, observed by me in 1859\r\nliving at Messina, and figured in 1862 in my Monograph as _Dictyosoma\r\ntrigonizon_ (Taf. xxvi. figs. 4-6), but afterwards called _Spongodictyum\r\ntrigonizon_ (_loc. cit._, p. 459). I supposed at that time (now twenty-five\r\nyears ago), that this remarkable and in many respects distinct form might\r\nbelong to the Spongosphærida, and that an internal, triple, spherical\r\nlattice-shell, found entangled in its spongy framework, might be its\r\ncentral \"medullary shell.\" But at present, having found many shells of\r\ndifferent Radiolaria accidentally entangled in the arachnoidal framework of\r\nvarious Sagosphærida, I think it much more probable, that that \"triple\r\nmedullary shell,\" composed of three simple concentric lattice-spheres, was\r\nreally a species of _Plegmosphæra_ or _Actinomma_, accidentally entangled\r\nin the arachnoidal spongy framework of _Sagmarium_. This is the more\r\nprobable, as I had observed very frequently at Messina, in 1859, fragments\r\nof that framework, but only once the triple lattice-shell which I supposed\r\nto be the \"triple medullary shell\" of the former. The peculiar structure of\r\nthe loose framework, its very large triangular meshes and thin arachnoidal\r\nbars, partly provided with cruciate verticils (_loc. cit._, Taf. xxvi.\r\nfigs. 4, 5) have been very frequently observed by me during the last ten\r\nyears in various Sagosphærida (PHÆODARIA), but never in any true\r\n#Sphæroidea# (SPUMELLARIA).\r\n\r\nThe second species of Sagosphærida hitherto observed, is _Sagoscena\r\ngracilis_, described and figured in 1879 by Richard Hertwig as _Aulosphæra\r\ngracilis_ (Organism. {1603}d. Radiol., p. 91, Taf. ix. fig. 4). He too\r\nobserved only fragments of destroyed and incomplete shells, and was led by\r\ntheir striking similarity to fragments of _Aulosphæra elegantissima_ to\r\nunite it with the genus _Aulosphæra_. But the accurate description and the\r\nfigure given by him of the fragments observed leaves no doubt that it was a\r\ntrue _Sagoscena_.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of the Challenger the Sagosphærida are so common and so\r\nrichly represented, that we may describe here not less than seven genera\r\nand thirty-three species, but this may be a small part only of the numerous\r\nspecies of this family, which seems to be widely distributed over all\r\noceans, in the Arctic and Antarctic as well as in temperate and tropical\r\nzones. The majority are inhabitants of the surface, but a few species have\r\nbeen found only in deep-sea soundings. A striking fact is their usual\r\nassociation with the similar Aulosphærida. The majority of shells of both\r\nfamilies were found entangled in one another.\r\n\r\nThe shell of all Sagosphærida seems to be spherical or nearly spherical in\r\nthe complete state; but complete spheres can be observed only very rarely,\r\nand it is not impossible that deviations from the spherical form exist just\r\nas in some Aulosphærida (_e.g._, the lenticular _Aulophacus_ and the\r\nspindle-shaped _Aulatractus_). The diameter of the spheres usually seems to\r\nbe between 1 and 2, often also 3 millimetres; very rarely shells occur\r\nwhich are less than 1 or more than 3 (4 or 5) millimetres.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous network or lattice-work of the Sagosphærida exhibits a very\r\ncharacteristic shape, and this enables one to distinguish it at first sight\r\nfrom all the other Radiolaria. It is constantly composed of triangular,\r\nvery large meshes, which are separated by very thin and delicate, flexible\r\nand elastic bars. With respect to the arrangement of these meshes we\r\ndistinguish two different subfamilies; in the Sagenida the wall of the\r\nspherical shell is very thin and composed only of a simple lattice-plate;\r\nin the Sagmarida the wall is thickened and spongy, with a complete\r\nwicker-work of threads, interwoven in different directions.\r\n\r\nThe typical triangular form of the large meshes is usually regular or\r\nsubregular in the fenestrated Sagenida, more or less irregular in the\r\nspongy Sagmarida. In many cases, however, irregular triangles also occur in\r\nthe former, and regular triangles in the latter subfamily. Very rarely\r\nirregular polygonal meshes are found in a part of the network, small\r\nconnecting bars being developed accidentally between two neighbouring sides\r\nof the triangles. The diameter of the meshes is usually between 0.1 and 0.2\r\nmm., often also greater, between 0.2 and 0.3, rarely smaller, 0.05 to 0.09\r\nmm. The triangular meshes of the Sagosphærida are therefore on an average\r\nten times as large as the usual meshes in the network of the common\r\n#Sphæroidea#.\r\n\r\nThe filiform bars, or the thread-shaped, very long and thin rods between\r\nthe triangular meshes, are scarcely less characteristic of the Sagosphærida\r\nthan the form and size of the meshes. Their length is usually between 0.1\r\nand 0.2 mm., often also {1604}from 0.2 to 0.3 mm., whilst their thickness\r\nis only 0.002 to 0.004 mm., often it is less than 0.001, rarely more than\r\n0.005 mm. The nodal points of the network, in which six threads are usually\r\nunited, are more or less thickened, often stellate (Pl. 108, figs. 9, 12,\r\n&c.). Sometimes they are pierced by a central pore. The thin threads are\r\nconstantly cylindrical, never edged or prismatic, very elastic and\r\nflexible; usually they are perfectly smooth, rarely spiny or thorny,\r\nsometimes provided with scattered cruciate verticils of lateral branches,\r\nas in _Sagena crucifera_ and in the first described form of this family,\r\n_Sagmarium trigonizon_ (compare my Monograph, 1862, Taf. xxvi. fig. 5).\r\n\r\nThe surface of the spherical shell is smooth only in two genera of\r\nSagosphærida, in _Sagena_ and _Sagmarium_ (Pl. 108, figs. 2, 8). In the\r\nfive other genera it is covered either with radial spines, arising from the\r\nnodal points of the network, or with peculiar cortical pyramids or\r\ntent-shaped elevations (Pl. 108, figs. 1, 3-6, &c.). These pyramids are of\r\nthe same characteristic shape as in the similar _Auloscena_ among the\r\nAulosphærida (Pl. 110, fig. 1); usually, however, they are less regular\r\nthan in the latter. The pyramids or tents are usually six-sided, often,\r\nhowever, they are also four-sided or three-sided, more rarely five, seven\r\nor more sided. The edges of the pyramids are formed by filiform bars\r\nsimilar to those which compose the original lattice-work of the\r\nSagosphærida. The cavity of the pyramids is quite simple in _Sagoscena_\r\n(figs. 1, 5, 6), whilst in _Sagenoscena_ and _Sagoplegma_ a radial column\r\narises in its axis, the thickened axial rod (figs. 3, 4, 10).\r\n\r\nThe radial spines, which arise either from the tops of the pyramids or from\r\nthe nodal points of the network, exhibit in the Sagosphærida a variety and\r\nelegance similar to the closely allied Aulosphærida. Sometimes a single\r\nradial spine arises in each nodal point or at the top of each pyramid\r\n(figs. 3, 4, 10); at other times two, three, or four (rarely more)\r\ndivergent spines (figs. 6-9, 12, 13). These are rarely quite simple,\r\nusually provided with lateral and terminal branches. The lateral branches\r\nare either scattered irregularly, or regularly disposed in elegant\r\nverticils, each of which is usually composed of three or four short\r\nbranches (Pl. 108, figs. 9, 13). The terminal branches form either a\r\nsimilar verticil, or a bunch or corona, composed of numerous radial\r\nsecondary spines. The distal ends of the terminal as well as of the lateral\r\nbranches are rarely simple, usually they are provided with a spinulate knob\r\nor with an elegant spathilla (Pl. 108, figs. 3, 9, 13).\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Sagosphærida is comparatively small, as it\r\nalso is in the Aulosphærida and Orosphærida. Its diameter is usually about\r\none-third or one-fourth that of the enveloping shell, between 0.2 and 0.3,\r\noften only 0.12 to 0.18, rarely more than 0.3 mm. It is surrounded on the\r\noral half by a red or dark phæodium and separated from the inner surface of\r\nthe shell by the voluminous calymma. The subspherical nucleus is usually\r\nabout half as broad as the capsule. The three openings of the latter, the\r\nlarge tubular astropyle and the two opposite lateral parapylæ, exhibit the\r\nsame shape {1605}as in the closely allied Aulosphærida (Pl. 111, fig. 3).\r\nThe pseudopodia arising from the central capsule form a loose network in\r\nthe calymma, and proceed over its surface as numerous delicate radial\r\nfilaments, often supported by the radial spines.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Sagosphærida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The delicate wall of the\r\nsimple spherical lattice-shell is composed of large, regular, or\r\nsubregular, triangular meshes, the nodal points of which bear no radial\r\nspines. It agrees therefore perfectly with _Aularia_, and differs from this\r\nsimplest form of Aulosphærida only in the structure of the skeleton, which\r\nis composed not of hollow articulated tubes, but of very thin solid\r\nthreads. The skeleton may therefore also be confounded with _Cenosphæra_,\r\nbut the central capsule of this latter is \"peripylean,\" with numerous fine\r\npores in the entire wall, whilst that of _Sagena_ is \"tripylean,\" having\r\nthe proboscis of all PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1606}1. _Sagena ternaria_, n. sp.

It exhibits therefore the same relation to the\r\nlatter as _Aulosphæra_ bears to _Aularia_. {1607}The regular or subregular\r\ntriangular meshes of the lattice-sphere are separated in _Sagosphæra_ by\r\nsolid, very thin threads, in the similar _Aulosphæra_, however, by thicker\r\nhollow tubes. The genus _Sagosphæra_ may be divided into two\r\nsubgenera:--_Sagosphærella_ with a single radial spine at each nodal point\r\nof the network, and _Sagosphæroma_ with a bunch of two to four or more\r\ndivergent radial spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Sagosphæra trigonilla_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nRadial spines simple, straight, smooth, about as long as the smooth bars of\r\nthe network, a single one at each nodal point.

Radiol., p. 357.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a large spherical or subspherical (rarely\r\nspindle-shaped) articulated shell, which is composed of hollow tangential\r\ntubes. Nodal points of the loose network stellate, with a nodal cavity and\r\nastral septa. Meshes either triangular or polygonal. Hollow radial spines\r\narise usually at the nodal points of the surface. No peculiar mouth in the\r\nshell. Central capsule tripylean, placed in the centre of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Aulosphærida# comprises a great number of splendid and widely\r\ndistributed PHÆODARIA, which have a special interest on account of the\r\npeculiarly complicated structure of their large lattice-shell, of the\r\nextraordinary beauty of their form and of their remarkable relations to the\r\nother PHÆODARIA. They differ from all the other Radiolaria in the peculiar\r\narticulate composition of the spherical skeleton of hollow tangential\r\ntubes, which are connected (and at the same time separated) by sutural or\r\nastral septa and filled up by jelly. The same peculiar structure recurs\r\nonly in the closely allied Cannosphærida, which, however, differ in the\r\npossession of a second internal concentric shell, connected with the outer\r\nby radial beams. The similar Sagosphærida, which exhibit corresponding\r\nforms in various genera, differ from the Aulosphærida in the simpler\r\nstructure of the delicate lattice-sphere, which is composed of very thin\r\nsolid threads of silica, without astral septa. The Orosphærida, finally,\r\nalso nearly related to the preceding families, differ from them in the\r\ncoarse structure of the lattice-sphere, which is composed of very thick\r\ntangential, concentrically stratified rods, with an internal axial canal,\r\nbut without astral septa at the nodal points.\r\n\r\n{1616}One genus only, and two species, of Aulosphærida have been hitherto\r\nknown, having been discovered by me in 1859 at Messina, and described in my\r\nMonograph in 1862 as _Aulosphæra trigonopa_ and _Aulosphæra elegantissima_\r\n(_loc. cit._, p. 357, Taf. x. figs. 4, 5; Taf. ix. figs. 5, 6). The\r\ncharacteristic structure of their central capsule, as true TRIPYLEA, was\r\nafterwards, in 1879, described more accurately by Richard Hertwig\r\n(Organism. d. Radiol., p. 90, Taf. x. figs. 2, 8, 14). The rich collection\r\nof the Challenger has demonstrated that the Aulosphærida belong to the most\r\ncommon and most widely distributed PHÆODARIA; many of them are\r\ndistinguished by the admirable elegance and astonishing regularity of their\r\nlarge and delicate shell. Nine genera and fifty-six species of this great\r\nfamily are described in the following pages, which, however, may represent\r\nonly a small part of the numerous forms which are found on the surface as\r\nwell as in different depths of all oceans and in all zones.\r\n\r\nThe shell is in the great majority of Aulosphærida a regular sphere or an\r\nendospherical polyhedron. Two genera only, both rather rare, exhibit a\r\ndifferent monaxonial form, one vertical main axis being developed either\r\nmore or less than all the other ones of the sphere:--_Aulatractus_ is\r\nspindle-shaped or ellipsoidal, with prolonged main axis; _Aulophacus_ is\r\nlenticular or discoidal, with shortened main axis. The former may be\r\ncompared to the #Prunoidea#, the latter to the #Discoidea#, in opposition\r\nto the common regular #Sphæroidea#. The size of the lattice-shell is very\r\nconsiderable in all Aulosphærida, its diameter varying usually between 1\r\nand 3 mm., often it amounts to 4 or 5 mm.; very rarely the diameter is more\r\nthan 5 or less than 1 mm. The largest form observed is the spindle-shaped\r\n_Aulatractus_, in which the vertical prolonged main axis attains 6 to 10\r\nmm., the horizontal equatorial axis 3 to 5 mm.\r\n\r\nThe network of the lattice-shell exhibits in the Aulosphærida two different\r\ntypes, according to which we distinguish two different subfamilies:\r\nAularida and Aulonida; the former are much more common and richer in\r\nremarkable forms than the latter. The meshes of the network are in the\r\nAularida constantly triangular, regular or subregular, and very similar to\r\nthose of the Sagosphærida; at each nodal point six tangential tubes are\r\nusually united, so that the network may be regarded also as composed of\r\nregular hexagonal meshes, each of which is divided into six smaller\r\ntriangular meshes (Pl. 109, figs. 1, 3, 5). The second subfamily, the\r\nAulonida, are much rarer than the former, and are distinguished by the\r\npolygonal meshes of the network; these are usually more or less irregular,\r\npentagonal and hexagonal intermingled, more rarely tetragonal, heptagonal,\r\nor octagonal; usually three or four, rarely five or more tangential tubes\r\nare united at each nodal point (Pl. 111, figs. 1, 3). The size of the\r\nmeshes is very considerable, and agrees with that of the Sagosphærida;\r\ntheir diameter being usually between 0.1 and 0.3, rarely less or more.\r\n\r\nThe hollow tubes which compose the loose network are usually cylindrical,\r\nstraight or slightly curved, smooth (Pl. 111, fig. 2), more rarely somewhat\r\nspinulate (Pl. 109, {1617}fig. 5). Their length is usually between 0.1 and\r\n0.2 mm., rarely less than 0.08, or more than 0.24 mm.; their diameter\r\nusually between 0.003 to 0.005, sometimes only 0.002 or less, at other\r\ntimes 0.006 or more. In several species the tangential tubes are thinner in\r\nthe middle part, and thickened towards the two ends (Pl. 109, figs. 3, 4).\r\nEach tube consists of a thin cylindrical wall of silex, and of a jelly-mass\r\nfilling up its cavity; in its axis runs a very thin, straight or slightly\r\ncurved thread of silica, the axial filament.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the tangential tubes, which originally, in the simplest\r\nAulosphærida, lie tangentially in the spherical face of a simple\r\nlattice-sphere, exhibits various secondary modifications, leading to\r\nvarious interesting generic forms. Two genera only, _Aularia_ (with\r\ntriangular meshes, Pl. 111, fig. 2) and _Aulonia_ (with polygonal meshes,\r\nPl. 111, fig. 1) possess a smooth, perfectly simple lattice-sphere, and may\r\ntherefore be regarded as the ancestral genera of the two subfamilies. Two\r\nother corresponding genera, the common _Aulosphæra_ (Pl. 109) and the rarer\r\n_Aulastrum_ (Pl. 111, fig. 3), differ from the former in the development of\r\nradial spines at the nodal points of the simple lattice-sphere.\r\n_Aulophacus_ may be developed from _Aulosphæra_ by shortening,\r\n_Aulatractus_, however, by prolongation of the vertical main axis (Pl. 111,\r\nfigs. 6, 7). In two genera, _Auloplegma_ and _Aulodictyum_, the latticed\r\nwall of the spherical shell becomes thickened and spongy, an irregular\r\nframework being formed by tubes connected in different directions (Pl. 111,\r\nfig. 8). The most remarkable and the most elegant form, however, of the\r\nwhole family is represented by _Auloscena_ (Pl. 110). The entire surface of\r\nthe spherical lattice-shell is here covered with numerous regular or\r\nsubregular pyramids, or tent-shaped elevations. Usually each pyramid is\r\nsix-sided, and surrounded by six other six-sided pyramids, their bases\r\nbeing separated by six triangular meshes, which lie in the spherical face.\r\nA similar elegant form is developed among the Sagosphærida in the genera\r\n_Sagoscena_, _Sagenoscena_ and _Sagoplegma_ (Pl. 108, fig. 1). The\r\nstructure of _Auloscena_, however, is usually more regular, and in the top\r\nof each pyramid a radial tube arises.\r\n\r\nThe junction of the cylindrical tubes at the nodal points of the network is\r\nvery remarkable. _Aularia_, the simplest form of the family, exhibits at\r\neach nodal point the union of six tangential tubes (Pl. 111, fig. 2); their\r\nends are so pointed and truncated that they are connected in the form of a\r\nregular six-radiate star; the conical end of each tube is separated from,\r\nand at the same time closely connected with, the adjacent conical ends of\r\nthe two neighbouring tubes by a thin septum, the astral or sutural septum.\r\nThe six astral septa compose together a six-radiate star, and in the centre\r\nof this star the six axial filaments of the tubes are united. Their central\r\nunion is surrounded by a small, double-contoured circle, and this circle\r\nseems to be the perimeter of a small and flat cavity on the inside of the\r\nstar, which we call shortly the \"nodal cavity\" (\"die kleine Vertiefung\"\r\naccording to Hertwig, _loc. cit._, p. 90). The nodal cavity of _Aularia_\r\nprobably possesses a central opening on its inside and six small\r\nsurrounding pores, which {1618}lead into the six connected tangential\r\ntubes. In _Aulosphæra_ and _Auloscena_, where a radial spine arises at each\r\nnodal point, its axial filament arises from the centre of the star, and is\r\nusually prolonged on the inside into a free centripetal beam (Pl. 109,\r\nfigs. 6, 7; Pl. 110, figs. 4, 6). This centripetal beam is a slender, very\r\nthin, conical tube (often with a six-sided pyramidal base) and perhaps of\r\ngreat morphological interest as a rudiment, being homologous to the hollow\r\nradial beams which connect the two concentric spheres of the Cannosphærida.\r\nPossibly the Aulosphærida have been derived from the latter by loss of the\r\ninner shell and reduction of the radial beams; the centripetal beams which\r\nare found in many (but not in all) Aulosphærida, may be the last remnant of\r\nthose radial beams. They contain also an axial filament, as a direct\r\ninternal prolongation of that of the external radial spine. The axial\r\nfilaments of the radial spines are usually connected with their thin wall\r\nby a variable number of scattered transverse threads, or sometimes even by\r\nthin transverse septa (Pl. 110, figs. 4-7, &c.). This structure corresponds\r\nto the similar axial filaments and their thin filiform transverse branches\r\nwhich we have found in other PHÆODARIA, _e.g._, in the Tuscarorida and\r\nCircoporida.\r\n\r\nThe Aulonida (with polygonal meshes) exhibit in general the same structure\r\nas the Aularida (with triangular meshes). But whilst in the latter usually\r\nsix tangential tubes are united at each nodal point, in the former only\r\nthree or four tubes become united. Therefore also the number of the small\r\nsutural partitions or astral septa, which radiate from the central openings\r\nof the nodal cavity, is six in the latter, three or four in the former.\r\nCorrespondingly three or four small pores lead from the nodal cavity into\r\nthe surrounding tangential tubes.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of the nodal points, and the intimate structure of the\r\ndifferent parts here united, is a matter which it is very difficult to\r\nexplain. It is a certain fact, well established by hundreds of\r\nobservations, that in the complete and well-preserved skeletons which are\r\nperfectly purified by fire, or by hot mineral acids, and afterwards dried,\r\nall the tubes of the skeleton, the tangential as well as the radial\r\ncylinders, become filled up by air. Each tube contains usually one large\r\ncylindrical air-bubble, with two hemispherical ends. But the air-bubbles of\r\nthe neighbouring tubes are completely separated one from another by the\r\nthin astral or sutural septa, and the air-bubble of the radial tubes is\r\nalso separated from the former. The central cavity of each nodal point is\r\ntherefore surrounded in the Aularida by six, in the Aulonida by three or\r\nfour separate cylinders of air. This fact seems to be explained only on the\r\nsupposition that each single tube has two terminal pores or fissures, which\r\nopen into the two nodal cavities on its two ends. The radial tubes must\r\nalso possess at least one small opening, probably on their base, and\r\nprobably they have another on their distal apex. In no other way can it be\r\nexplained, that in all complete, well-preserved and purified skeletons,\r\neach single tube constantly becomes easily filled by an air-bubble after\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nIn the living Aulosphærida the cavities of all tubes are filled up by a\r\njelly-substance, {1619}which may be stained by carmine and is probably\r\nidentical with the jelly of the calymma. The latter is probably in direct\r\nconnection with the former by the central pore of the nodal cavity, which\r\nis placed on its inside and surrounded by the astral septa; these separate\r\nthe tangential tubes, radiating from one nodal point, completely, and are\r\nthin and simple, but very solid lamellæ of silica. Therefore the nodal\r\nstars of broken shells usually remain united, whilst the single radiating\r\ntubes composing them are broken off (Pl. 110, figs. 3, 8, 10). But it\r\nhappens only rarely (and only in certain individual species) that complete\r\nsingle tubes separate; usually the fragments of the connected neighbouring\r\ntubes remain on their ends. The two small terminal openings of each\r\ntangential tube, which lead from its cavity into the nodal cavity, and are\r\nsurrounded on each end by the truncated ends of two neighbouring astral\r\nsepta, are very difficult to observe (Pl. 110, figs. 8-10).\r\n\r\nThe wonderful elegance and the high complication of these regular skeletons\r\nof the Aulosphærida, produced by a single cell, becomes increased by the\r\ngraceful and manifold appendages and apophyses which are usually developed\r\non the radial tubes. In only a few species these are simple, as in the\r\ncommon and cosmopolitan _Aulosphæra trigonopa_. Usually lateral or terminal\r\nappendages are developed in great variety, a selection of which is figured\r\nin Pls. 109-111. The lateral branches are either irregularly scattered\r\nspines (Pl. 110, figs. 3-7) or regular verticils of cruciate or radiate\r\nspines; each verticil is usually composed of four perpendicularly crossed\r\nhorizontal branches (Pl. 109, figs. 3, 4, 7, 10, &c.), more rarely of a\r\ngreater number of radiating transverse branches.\r\n\r\nThe terminal appendages of the radial spines exhibit a striking similarity\r\nwith those of the Aulacanthida (Pls. 102-105). They are either forks with\r\ntwo or three divergent branches (Pl. 111, figs. 3, 4), or regular crosses\r\nwith four branches opposite in pairs (Pl. 109, figs. 2, 6, 7, 10), or\r\nelegant crowns or verticils, composed of numerous radiating branches (Pl.\r\n110, figs. 1-6). The distal ends of the terminal as well as of the lateral\r\nbranches are either simple, pointed, or armed with a spinulate knob, or\r\nwith a terminal spathilla. The variety and elegance of these terminal\r\nornaments, the function of which is that of capturing tentacles, is in the\r\nAulosphærida not less admirable than in the Aulacanthida and Coelodendrida.\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Aulosphærida (Pl. 111, fig. 2) was first\r\nfigured in my Monograph (1862, Taf. xi. fig. 5) of _Aulosphæra\r\nelegantissima_, as a sphere of 0.2 to 0.3 mm. in diameter. I described\r\nthere the large nucleus (of half that size) as a spherical \"Binnenblase,\"\r\nand the numerous pseudopodia which arise from the capsule and radiate\r\nthrough the meshes of the lattice-shell. But I had not observed at that\r\ntime the three typical openings of the capsule, which were first discovered\r\nand accurately described by R. Hertwig (1879, _loc. cit._, p. 94, Taf. x.\r\nfigs. 2, 4, 5, 8, 14). The large astropyle with its radiate operculum and\r\nproboscis, and the two smaller lateral parapylæ, provided with {1620}a\r\nsmaller tubule, have in general the same shape as in the closely allied\r\nSagosphærida and Orosphærida, and agree in their strong development with\r\nthat of the Aulacanthida. The collection of the Challenger contains\r\nnumerous well-preserved preparations of Aulosphærida, which were stained by\r\ncarmine immediately after being captured, and in which the central capsule\r\nand its nucleus exhibit the same intimate structure already accurately\r\ndescribed by R. Hertwig. The diameter of the capsule is usually between 0.2\r\nand 0.3, rarely less than 0.15 or more than 0.35 mm., the nucleus has half\r\nthat size. The phæodium has usually about the same volume (Pl. 109, fig.\r\n1), but seems to be in many Aulosphærida less developed than in the other\r\nPHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Aulosphærida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Gesellsch. Jena,\r\n      Dec. 12, p. 6.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with two concentric spherical or subspherical\r\nshells, which are connected by numerous thin, tubular, radial beams. Inner\r\nshell simple, spherical or ovate, solid or latticed, with a peculiar mouth.\r\nOuter shell spherical or polyhedral, articulate, composed of hollow\r\ntangential tubes, which are separated by astral septa at the stellate nodal\r\npoints. From the latter arise hollow radial tubes, whilst the inner radial\r\nbeams, connecting the two shells, are inserted in the middle of the\r\ntangential tubes. No peculiar mouth in the outer shell. Central capsule\r\nenclosed by the inner shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Cannosphærida# comprises a small number of remarkable PHÆODARIA\r\nwhich are rare and found only in a few localities. They differ from all the\r\nother PHÆODARIA in the possession of two concentric spherical shells, which\r\nare connected by radial beams, and the inner of which is quite simple, like\r\nthat of the Medusettida, {1638}whilst the outer is articulated and composed\r\nof hollow tangential tubes, like that of the Aulosphærida. This latter\r\nfamily seems to be most nearly allied to the Cannosphærida, and is perhaps\r\nderived from them by loss of the inner shell. The possession of a peculiar\r\nmouth in this inner shell brings the Cannosphærida nearer to the\r\nPhæogromia. The similar Coelodrymida, in which also two concentric\r\nspherical shells are connected by hollow radial beams, differ essentially\r\nin the bivalved shape of the inner shell and the simple, non-articulated,\r\nnetwork of the outer shell.\r\n\r\nOnly a single species of Cannosphærida has been hitherto known, described\r\nand figured in 1879 by R. Hertwig as _Coelacantha anchorata_ (_loc. cit._,\r\np. 92, Taf. ix. fig. 2). The rich collection of the Challenger has added to\r\nit only four other species, one of which is most nearly allied to the\r\nformer, whilst the others belong to a separate genus, _Cannosphæra_ (Pl.\r\n112). The inner shell is in this latter genus a solid lamella of silica,\r\nwhilst in the former it is fenestrated. In all other essential points of\r\nstructure both genera are scarcely different.\r\n\r\nThe inner shell is either spherical or ovate and has a diameter of 0.1 to\r\n0.4 (usually 0.2 to 0.3 mm.). A distinct main axis is always marked by the\r\nlarge open mouth on its oral pole. The aboral part of the shell-cavity\r\ncontains the spherical central capsule, the oral part the dark phæodium, a\r\npart of which is often prominent through the mouth (figs. 1, 2, 4). The\r\nwall of the inner shell is a very thin and transparent lamella of silica,\r\nwhich is structureless and solid in _Cannosphæra_, distinctly fenestrated\r\nin _Coelacantha_; the pores of the latter are irregularly rounded and seem\r\nto possess a thickened margin.\r\n\r\nFrom the surface of the inner shell arise numerous thin tubular, radial\r\nbeams (twenty to eighty or more) and connect it with the outer shell. These\r\nbeams are always very thin and straight cylindrical tubules, about twice to\r\nfour times as long as the diameter of the inner shell, and usually 0.001\r\nmm. broad, or even less. Their basal end at the surface of the latter\r\nappears mammillated (figs. 2, 4). The cavity of the inner shell seems to\r\npass over immediately into the tubular cavities of the radial beams. These\r\nlatter are sometimes simple, at other times articulated or jointed by a\r\nnumber of transverse septa. The radial beams are covered in all the species\r\nobserved either with scattered spines (fig. 5) or with verticils of\r\nanchor-threads, very thin, filiform, lateral branches which bear a\r\nspathilla with three or four recurved teeth on the distal end (figs. 2, 4).\r\n\r\nThe outer shell is either spherical or an endospherical polyhedron, the\r\nprominent nodal points of which fall into a spherical face. Its diameter is\r\nusually from 2 to 3 mm., rarely more than 3 or less than 1 mm. Its\r\nstructure is the same as described for the Aulosphærida, being composed of\r\nhollow cylindrical tubes, which form a loose network and are separated at\r\nits nodal points by astral septa. The meshes of the network are {1639}very\r\nlarge, usually twice to three times as broad as the inner shell, and\r\nirregularly polygonal; the usual and prevailing form is pentagonal, but\r\nhexagonal meshes are also often intermingled, more rarely meshes with five,\r\nseven, or eight sides.\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical tangential tubes possess in general the same shape as in\r\nthe similar Aulosphærida, have a thin wall, are filled with jelly, and\r\ncontain a delicate axial filament in their axis; they differ, however, in a\r\npeculiar constant character; in the middle of each tube is inserted an\r\ninner radial beam coming from the inner shell, so that both together have\r\nthe form of a T. The central point of insertion has a somewhat shorter\r\nradial distance from the centre of the body than the two nodal points on\r\nboth ends of the tangential tube, so that the latter is somewhat geniculate\r\n(figs. 1-5). The two halves of each tangential tube are usually somewhat\r\nthinner on the central end (where the inner radial beam is inserted),\r\nthicker on the distal end (where the outer radial tube arises); at both\r\nends they are closed by a thin transverse septum. Often also some other\r\nsepta are developed, so that each tangential tube seems to be composed of\r\nfour to six joints or segments. Usually the tangential tubes are armed with\r\nspines or anchor threads, similar to those of the inner radial beams. The\r\nlength of the single tangential tubes is usually between 0.1 and 0.3, their\r\ndiameter from 0.01 to 0.02.\r\n\r\nThe nodal points of the outer lattice-sphere, in which the outer radial\r\nspines arise, seem to possess the same structure as in the similar\r\nAulosphærida. Since three tangential tubes are connected to each nodal\r\npoint, in its centre is the union of three small astral septa or sutural\r\npartitions. The small nodal cavity on the inside of the nodal point has\r\nprobably three small pores, which lead into the three tangential tubes\r\nbetween the three astral septa. A fourth pore probably leads from the nodal\r\ncavity into the cavity of the hollow radial tube. This structure is\r\ndifficult to observe, but seems to be demonstrated by the fact, that in the\r\ncomplete and carefully purified skeletons which are treated with hot\r\nmineral acids and afterwards dried, all cylinders, the tangential as well\r\nas the radial tubes, become easily filled by air (compare the description\r\nof the similar structure in the Aulosphærida).\r\n\r\nThe external radial tubes which arise in the nodal points of the outer\r\nshell are either cylindrical or cylindro-conical, straight, and usually\r\nabout as long as the diameter of the inner shell. Their structure and\r\narmature is the same as in the similar Aulosphærida. In the axis of each\r\nradial tube runs a delicate axial filament, which is connected with its\r\nthin and fragile wall either by filiform transverse branches or by delicate\r\ntransverse septa. The outside of the radial tubes is either smooth (figs.\r\n3-5) or armed with scattered spines (fig. 4) or with verticils of lateral\r\nbranches; each verticil is usually composed of three or four branches. The\r\ndistal end of the radial tubes is rarely simple, pointed; it is usually\r\narmed with a spathilla of three or four curved terminal branches (figs. 3,\r\n5) sometimes with an elegant corona composed of twenty to thirty thin\r\nradially divergent branches (fig. 4).\r\n\r\n{1640}The _central capsule_ of the Cannosphærida is small (of 0.1 to 0.15\r\nin diameter) and hidden in the aboral half of the enclosing inner shell,\r\nwhilst the oral half of the latter is filled up by the phæodium (figs. 2,\r\n4). The structure of the capsule and of its three openings seems to be the\r\nsame as in the closely allied Aulosphærida. I have, however, not been able\r\nto recognise the two parapylæ or secondary openings, and have only observed\r\nthe astropyle or the main-opening with its radiate operculum surrounded by\r\nthe phæodium, and directed with its tubular proboscis towards the mouth of\r\nthe inner shell. As R. Hertwig also could not recognise the two parapylæ,\r\nit is not impossible that they are wanting, and that the Cannosphærida\r\npossess only one opening, the astropyle, like the Medusettida and\r\nChallengerida. The nucleus, enclosed in the central capsule, is spherical,\r\nhalf or one-third as broad as the latter, and contains numerous nucleoli.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Cannosphærida._\r\n\r\n  Internal shell solid, without open pores,        691. _Cannosphæra_.\r\n  Internal shell latticed, with open pores,        692. _Coelacantha_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 691. _Cannosphæra_,[310] Haeckel, 1879, Sitzungsb. med.-nat.\r\nGesellsch.

Central capsule excentric, placed in the aboral half of\r\nthe shell-cavity.\r\n\r\nThe family #Challengerida# represent a large, peculiar, and interesting\r\ngroup of PHÆODARIA, which are, for the most part, inhabitants of great\r\ndepths, and were perfectly unknown before the discoveries of the\r\nChallenger. The first note on these remarkable Radiolaria was given in 1876\r\nby John Murray, in his Preliminary Reports on Work done on board the\r\nChallenger (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond., vol. xxiv. pp. 471, 536, pl. xxiv. figs.\r\n1, 2). He described the peculiar exceedingly beautiful tracery of their\r\nshell, similar to that of the Diatomaceæ, the enclosed central capsule\r\ncoloured by carmine, and the surrounding mass of black-brown pigment lumps\r\n(the phæodium). \"At times these Challengerida come up with a good deal of\r\nsarcode outside of the shell, and two specimens have been seen to throw out\r\nelongated pseudopodia\" (_loc. cit._, p. 536). He found also the shells in\r\nthe Radiolarian ooze of the deep sea. The number of different forms found\r\nin the collection of the Challenger is so great, that I can describe in the\r\nfollowing pages not less than six genera and fifty-eight species. A part of\r\nthese have already been figured by Dr. John Murray in the Narrative of the\r\nChallenger Expedition, vol. i. p. 226, Pl. A, 1885.\r\n\r\nIn my first preliminary note on the PHÆODARIA, in 1879, I gave a stricter\r\ndefinition {1643}of the Challengerida (Sitzungsb. med.-nat. Gesellsch.\r\nJena, Dec. 12, 1879, p. 5). But I united at that time the true\r\nChallengerida with the Tuscarorida, which, however, are sharply separated\r\nby the entirely different structure of their shell. In Plate A given by Dr.\r\nJohn Murray, and mentioned above, figs. 1-14 represent genuine\r\nChallengerida, with diatomaceous shell-structure, whilst figs. 15-20 are\r\nTuscarorida, with porcellanous shell-structure. These latter, therefore,\r\nare more closely allied to the Circoporida, whilst the Challengerida\r\nexhibit a closer affinity to the Medusettida and Castanellida. But the two\r\nlatter families never possess that peculiar extremely regular and delicate\r\ndiatomaceous structure which is exhibited only by the Challengerida.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the Challengerida is rather simple, usually more or\r\nless ovate, sometimes nearly triangular, at other times subspherical. In\r\nnearly all species, with a few exceptions, the shell is more or less\r\ncompressed from the two sides, so that its horizontal transverse section is\r\nnot circular, but elliptical or lanceolate. In many species the shell is\r\nmore or less lenticular, with a sharp or sometimes keeled margin. This\r\nmargin lies in the sagittal plane of the body, whilst the two flat sides\r\nare right and left. The main axis is always perpendicular, and its oral or\r\nanterior pole is marked by the open mouth of the shell; the latter is in\r\nthe living organism probably the upper pole, whilst the opposite aboral or\r\nposterior pole (often marked by large spines) is the lower pole. The dorsal\r\nmargin of the mouth is usually different from the ventral, and in the\r\nmajority of species this difference is so striking, that right and left\r\nsides of the body may be recognised immediately, the fundamental form being\r\ndipleuric or bilaterally-symmetrical. In a few species, however, and mainly\r\nin those simplest forms in which the ovate shell has a circular mouth\r\nwithout teeth, and a circular transverse section, that difference is not\r\nrecognisable, and the ovate shell is monaxonial, as it is in _Gromia_ and\r\n_Lagena_ among the Foraminifera (Pl. 99, figs. 19, 20, 22). The size of the\r\nshell is in the majority of species between 0.2 and 0.5 mm.; there are,\r\nhowever, some very small species, in which the diameter of the shell is\r\nonly 0.05 to 0.08, or even less; and some large species, the diameter of\r\nwhich attains 0.8 to 0.9 mm.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar structure of the siliceous shell-wall, which we call shortly\r\n\"diatomaceous,\" and by which the Challengerida differ from all the other\r\nPHÆODARIA, has been already represented very well by Dr. John Murray, in\r\nPl. A. of the Narrative (vol. i. p. 266, figs. 1_c_-1_e_, 2_a_, 4_a_, 7_a_,\r\n7_b_). This elegant diatomaceous structure is extremely similar or nearly\r\nidentical with that well-known regular structure which we find in the\r\ncommon Diatomaceæ or Bacillariæ. The entire surface of the shell is covered\r\nwith a very great number of very small pit-like depressions, perfectly\r\nregular, circular in form, equal in size, and quincuncial in arrangement.\r\nThe neighbouring equidistant pits are always surrounded by regular\r\nhexagonal frames of equal size, and the prominent fine crests of these\r\nframes produce the regular hexagonal tracery, which gives to the shell such\r\na striking similarity to that of the Diatomaceæ. According to {1644}the\r\ndifferent positions to which the focus of the microscope is brought, the\r\nhexagonal tracery exhibits a different appearance; either a regular network\r\nof equal hexagonal frames, or a lattice with equal and equidistant circular\r\nopenings, or a combination of three crossed and equidistant systems of\r\nparallel lines (crossed at angles of 120°). All the well-known and often\r\ndiscussed optical phenomena which are observed in the valves of the\r\nDiatomaceæ, reappear also on the shell of the Challengerida.\r\n\r\nTo recognise the true nature of this diatomaceous structure, sections and\r\nslides of the shell are required, and also fragments of broken shells, the\r\nbroken margins of which are of special value for obtaining further\r\nexplanation. The figures given by Dr. J. Murray (_loc. cit._, Pl. A) have\r\nalready demonstrated that the pit-like depressions are regular small\r\ncavities in the flinty shell-wall, which possess an inner and an outer\r\nopening. These intraparietal cavities are either spherical (fig. 7_b_) or\r\ncylindrical (fig. 1_d_, 4_a_) or spindle-shaped, with a constriction (fig.\r\n2_a_). Further accurate examinations probably will show a greater variety\r\nin their shape. But each cavity constantly possesses two small openings,\r\none on the outer, and the other on the inner surface of the shell-wall.\r\nCloser examination (especially of broken shells and slides) proves the\r\npresence of these two openings, which in the smaller species seem to be\r\nabsent on the first view. I may, therefore, suppose that also in the\r\nsimilar valves of the Diatomaceæ, which exhibit exactly the same structure,\r\nan inner and an outer opening are always present in each hexagonal pit, and\r\nthat the very small size alone prevents them from being recognised. The\r\nregular hexagonally-framed cavities in the shell-wall of the Challengerida\r\n(probably also of the Diatomaceæ) are therefore genuine pores, differing\r\nfrom the pores of other Radiolaria only in their smaller size and the\r\ndilatation of the middle part, which is much wider than the two openings.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the shell, its single larger opening, exhibits in the various\r\nChallengerida a great variety in form and structure, and offers the best\r\nmeans for separating genera and species. According to its essential shape\r\ntwo different subfamilies and six genera may be distinguished in this\r\nfamily. In the first subfamily, Lithogromida, the mouth is a simple large\r\nopening in the wall of the shell on the oral pole of its main axis (Pl. 99,\r\nfigs. 1-15). In the second subfamily, Pharyngellida, the mouth is prolonged\r\ninto a cylindrical hollow tube, which is prominent into the shell-cavity,\r\nand comparable to the pharynx of the Metazoa in general form and function\r\n(Pl. 99, figs. 16-20). In this case we may distinguish an inner and an\r\nouter mouth of the tubular pharynx.\r\n\r\nIn a few forms of both subfamilies the mouth is toothless, smooth, and not\r\narmed with prominent external spines or teeth, as in _Lithogromia_, the\r\nsimplest form of all (Pl. 99, fig. 22) and in _Entocannula_ (figs. 19, 20).\r\nIn the great majority of Challengerida, however, the outer opening of the\r\nmouth is armed with one or more teeth, usually strong prominent spines\r\n(figs. 1-18). Usually the base of these teeth is {1645}semitubular or a\r\nhalf cylinder, forming a more or less prominent peristome or a proboscis;\r\nand always in this case the open concave side of the canal-shaped groove is\r\ndirected towards the ventral side of the shell, the closed convex side\r\ntowards the dorsal side. When several teeth arise from the two lateral free\r\nmargins of the groove, they are also directed towards the ventral side\r\n(figs. 2, 12, 17, &c.). Often a deep ventral incision or a guttural\r\nconstriction separates the base of the proboscis from the genuine shell.\r\nThe structure of this proboscis or peristome is usually the same as in the\r\ndiatomaceous shell-wall; but sometimes its lattice-work assumes a different\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the mouth itself is rarely circular, usually it is\r\nelliptical or even lanceolate, often triangular. Sometimes two prominent\r\nopposite lips may be distinguished as right and left, when the fissure of\r\nthe mouth is prolonged in a sagittal or longitudinal direction; as upper\r\nand lower, when it is prolonged in a frontal or transverse direction. The\r\nupper or dorsal lip is always more developed than the lower or ventral; and\r\nthe entire semitubular proboscis may be regarded as a production of the\r\nupper lip. Sometimes the latter attains an extraordinary size and\r\ndevelopment, the greatest in _Challengeria murrayi_ (Pl. 99, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the mouth, which arise from the upper lip, are usually hollow,\r\nat least on the base; a prolongation of the shell-cavity arising into the\r\nbase of the teeth. Their form is very variable, conical, lanceolate,\r\ntriangular, sabre-shaped, &c. Usually they are more or less curved, and\r\nshorter than the radius of the shell; rarely they are straight, and longer\r\nthan the radius (Pl. 99, figs. 5, 6). More important is their different\r\nnumber, which we have employed for the distinction of subgenera; future\r\nobservations may prove that they are different genera. The most important\r\nare the following cases:--(A.) a single odd dorsal tooth (figs. 5, 16);\r\n(B.) two paired lateral teeth (figs. 4, 6, 17); (C.) three teeth, an odd\r\ndorsal and two paired lateral (figs. 7, 9, 10); (D.) four paired teeth, two\r\ndorsal and two ventral (figs. 3, 13); (E.) five teeth, an odd dorsal and\r\ntwo pairs of lateral (figs. 2, 12); (F.) six teeth in three lateral pairs\r\n(fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the peristome are not the only apophyses which arise from the\r\nshell of the Challengerida. In the majority other spines appear on the\r\nsagittal margin, which separates the right and left halves of the shell.\r\nThese marginal spines are characteristic of the genera _Challengeron_ and\r\n_Porcupinia_; they are usually radially directed, straight, conical,\r\nsometimes solid, at other times hollow. Their number and arrangement is\r\nvery variable and serves for the distinction of species; the following\r\ndifferences are the most important:--(A.) a single odd spine on the apical\r\npole of the shell, in the principal axis, opposite to the centre of the\r\nmouth (Pl. 99, figs. 6, 7); (B.) two aboral spines, a dorsal and a ventral\r\n(figs. 8-10); (C.) a bunch or a crowded group of radial spines on the\r\naboral margin of the shell, usually one larger apical spine surrounded by\r\nseveral smaller dorsal and ventral (figs. 11, 12, 16); (D.) numerous radial\r\nspines along the whole sagittal margin of the shell (figs. 13-15).\r\n\r\n{1646}The _central capsule_ of the Challengerida is constantly placed in\r\nthe aboral half of the shell-cavity, whilst its oral half is occupied by\r\nthe phæodium; the intervals between them and the inner surface of the shell\r\nare filled up by the calymma. Frequently from the outer surface of the\r\ncapsule arise numerous branched streams of sarcode, which pierce the\r\ncalymma and are directed towards the inside of the shell-wall, where they\r\nare united by a thin continuous layer of protoplasm (Pl. 99, fig. 1). The\r\nphæodium is usually more voluminous than the capsule and envelops the\r\nlatter on its anterior or oral face; more rarely the entire capsule is\r\nhidden in the phæodium. The phæodella, constituting the latter, are of very\r\ndifferent sizes, of variable colour, olive and greenish-brown, red-brown,\r\nblack-brown or nearly black. In some preparations, stained with carmine,\r\nnumerous red coloured granula, similar to nuclei, were scattered in the\r\nphæodium (compare Murray, _loc. cit._, Pl. A, figs. 1-14).\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the central capsule is usually about one-half or one-third\r\nas great as that of the enclosing shell (Pl. 99, figs. 1-20). Its form is\r\neither spherical or slightly compressed, spheroidal, or sometimes\r\nlenticular. The large nucleus has the same form, is about half as broad as\r\nthe capsule and contains numerous nucleoli. Sometimes the capsule contained\r\ntwo nuclei of equal size, and in a few specimens the shell contained two\r\ncentral capsules, each with a nucleus, so that the Challengerida seem to\r\npropagate also by self-division (Pl. 99, fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThe astropyle, or the large opening of the central capsule, exhibits the\r\nusual radiate operculum of the PHÆODARIA, and the tubular proboscis arising\r\nfrom it. This is constantly placed on the oral or anterior pole of the\r\ncapsule and directed towards the mouth of the shell. I was never able to\r\ndiscover any parapyle or secondary opening in the central capsule, though\r\nnumerous and well-preserved specimens of the Challenger collection were\r\naccurately examined. It seems therefore that the Challengerida are not\r\nTRIPYLEA (as the majority of PHÆODARIA), but MONOPYLEA with a single\r\nopening (like the closely allied Medusettida and Castanellida).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Challengerida._\r\n\r\n                              { Shell smooth, without\r\n                              {  adoral teeth and\r\n                              {  marginal spines,      693. _Lithogromia_.\r\n  I.

According to the different number and arrangement of these\r\nmarginal spines, which give a very singular appearance to them, we divide\r\nthe twenty-five species of this cosmopolitan genus into four\r\nsubgenera:--(1) with a single, odd apical spine; (2) with two opposed\r\naboral spines (a dorsal and a ventral); (3) with a bunch of aboral spines;\r\n(4) with numerous radial spines along the whole sagittal margin of the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Challengeranium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Margin of the shell with a single spine on the apical pole,\r\nopposite to the peristome (_Challengeriæ caudatæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\n{1654}1. _Challengeron monodon_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell subspherical, slightly compressed, with a single straight conical\r\nspine on the apical pole, about as long as the radius.

The\r\nPharyngellida are much rarer than the Lithogromida; only ten species have\r\nbeen observed of the former, fifty of the latter. _Entocannula_ is the\r\nsimplest form of the Pharyngellida, having a smooth shell, without aboral\r\nteeth and marginal spines; it differs from _Lithogromia_ only in the\r\npossession of the pharynx. One remarkable species is covered entirely with\r\nextremely thin, flinty hairs, and may represent therefore a peculiar genus,\r\n_Trichogromia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1661}1. _Entocannula circularis_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell circular or nearly circular, lenticular, strongly compressed.

(Pls. 118-120).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a simple, ovate, hemispherical or cap-shaped\r\nlattice-shell of peculiar alveolate structure, and with hollow articulate\r\nfeet surrounding the widely open mouth. Central capsule excentric, placed\r\nin the aboral half of the shell-cavity.\r\n\r\nThe family #Medusettida# represents a peculiar group of remarkable\r\nPHÆODARIA, which are similar to the Challengerida and Tuscarorida in the\r\ngeneral form of the monaxonian shell and its apophyses, but differ from\r\nboth families in the strange alveolate structure of the shell and of the\r\nhollow articulate feet surrounding its mouth. All the forms of this family\r\nhere described are new, and not a single species was known before the\r\ndiscoveries of the Challenger. The majority seem to be inhabitants of the\r\ndeep-sea, and occur mainly in those places where other families of\r\nPHÆODARIA (Aulacanthida, Aulosphærida, Coelodendrida) are also well\r\nrepresented; they are, however, nowhere so common as these latter families.\r\nTheir long feet and the small delicate {1664}shell are extremely fragile,\r\nso that complete and well-preserved specimens are rare. Some species are\r\namong the most admirable forms of Radiolaria, and are similar to small\r\nelegant Medusæ, _e.g._, _Medusetta_ (Pl. 120, figs. 1-4), _Gazelletta_ (Pl.\r\n118, fig. 1), and _Gorgonetta_ (Pl. 119).\r\n\r\nThe shell of the Medusettida is usually very small and delicate, in\r\ncomparison to the long, often exceedingly large, feet, which depend from\r\nthe margin of its mouth. From the size and the weight of these feet, we\r\nmust suppose that the shell floats in the water in the same position as in\r\nthe NASSELLARIA, so that the main axis is vertical, and the open mouth with\r\nthe feet on its lower pole. The form of the shell exhibits the same\r\nvarieties as the similar umbrella of the Medusæ. It is usually more or less\r\nhemispherical, sometimes flatter, cap-shaped, at other times more highly\r\nvaulted, campanulate or ovate. The similarity with the umbrella of a Medusa\r\nis so great, that in many species the large lower opening on the mouth of\r\nthe shell is surrounded by a prominent ring or diaphragm, comparable to the\r\nvelum of the Craspedotæ or Hydromedusæ (Pl. 120, figs. 3-4).\r\n\r\nThe structure of the shell, which we term shortly \"alveolate,\" is very\r\nremarkable, and seems to be different from that of the other PHÆODARIA. Its\r\nreticulate appearance seems to indicate at first sight the usual\r\nlattice-shell, pierced by numerous very small pores (Pl. 118, figs. 1-3).\r\nBut as soon as we make the shell dry, air always enters into its thin\r\nwalls, and each apparent pore is found to be a small alveole or a separate\r\ncompartment, which contains a small bubble of air (Pl. 120, figs. 11, 16).\r\nThe thin wall of the shell is therefore double, composed of two parallel,\r\nvery thin lamellæ of silica, which are little distant from one another, and\r\nare connected by a network of small rods or septa. This network is rarely\r\nregular, with square meshes (Pl. 118, fig. 3), or with hexagonal or\r\ntriangular meshes (Pl. 116, fig. 2); it is usually irregular, with\r\npolygonal meshes (Pl. 120, figs. 11-16). The size of the meshes or alveoles\r\nis usually smallest on the aboral apex of the shell, and increases\r\ngradually towards the mouth. The largest alveoles are around the mouth, on\r\nthe velum-shaped peristome, and here the marginal alveoles of the shell\r\npass directly over into the separate alveoles or hollow compartments of the\r\narticulate feet (Pl. 118, fig. 1). Probably each alveole is a separate\r\ncompartment, filled up by jelly, and has a small opening or pore on its\r\ninside; this pore is very distinct in the marginal alveoles of some larger\r\nspecies (Pl. 116, fig. 1_a_; Pl. 120, fig. 14), but I have not been able to\r\nrecognise it everywhere. Moreover, it often happens that the alveoles are\r\napparently completely closed. In some smaller species the alveolate\r\nstructure seems to be present only in the peripheral part of the shell,\r\nwhilst the central part is solid.\r\n\r\nThe outer convex surface of the shell is usually smooth, sometimes\r\npapillate (Pl. 116, fig. 1), at other times studded with small, conical,\r\nradial spines (Pl. 118, fig. 1; Pl. 120, figs. 4-11). Prolonged cylindrical\r\nspines or tubes are rarely {1665}scattered over the surface (Pl. 116, figs.\r\n1, 2). In some genera a long vertical or oblique spine is developed from\r\nthe apex of the shell, and is comparable to the \"apical horn\" of the\r\nNASSELLARIA (Pl. 118, figs. 2, 3; Pl. 120, figs. 1-4).\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the shell, or the large opening on the lower pole of its\r\nvertical main axis, is usually widely open, circular or polygonal, more\r\nrarely constricted. In many species the peristome is broadened and its\r\nmargin developed in the form of a horizontal diaphragm, which constricts\r\nthe entrance into the shell-cavity, and is comparable to the velum of the\r\nHydromedusæ (Pl. 120, figs. 1-4). Sometimes the margin of the velum is\r\nfringed and bears numerous small dependent filaments of silica, comparable\r\nto the marginal tentacles of many Medusæ (Pl. 118, figs. 1, 3; Pl. 120,\r\nfig. 16). Rarely the mouth is strongly constricted and prolonged into a\r\nnarrow, long, cylindrical tube, comparable to a proboscis; its opening is\r\nusually fringed (Pl. 116, figs. 1, 2).\r\n\r\nThe hollow articulate feet, or the large radial apophyses of the peristome,\r\nare the most remarkable organs of the Medusettida, and occur in the same\r\nform in no other family of Radiolaria. Their number is variable from three\r\nto twelve or more, and is here employed for the distinction of genera, as\r\nit is rather constant; the most frequent number is four (_Medusetta_) or\r\nsix (_Gazelletta_). The feet are usually cylindrical, much longer than the\r\nshell, and more or less curved; more rarely they are straight or slightly\r\ncompressed. They are always articulate, and divided by numerous transverse\r\nparallel septa into hollow compartments or alveoles; the transversely\r\nstriated appearance of the feet is brought about by these septa. The\r\nalveoles have usually the form of short discoidal cylinders, and are\r\nbroader than long (Pl. 120, figs. 5-13); rarely they are longer than broad\r\n(fig. 15). The septa between the alveoles are always perforated by a small\r\nopening and usually this opening is prolonged into a shorter or longer\r\ntubule, comparable to the siphuncle in the septa of the chambered shells of\r\nCephalopoda; as in these latter, the succeeding siphons are arranged in a\r\ncontinuous series, which lies either in the axis of the foot or parallel to\r\nit (Pl. 120, figs. 8, 13, 15). The siphons are directed towards the distal\r\nend of the foot, so that, _e.g._, the siphon which arises from the septum\r\nbetween the ninth and tenth alveole, projects into the cavity of the\r\nlatter. The communicating cavities of all the alveoles are filled up by\r\njelly. In the dry shells, which are cleaned by hot mineral acids or by\r\nfire, and in which, therefore, the jelly is destroyed, the cavities become\r\neasily filled by air-bubbles (Pl. 120, figs. 8, 11, 15). Whilst the\r\nalveoles of each foot always form a long simple series, this series becomes\r\ndoubled on the base of the larger feet, where they are broadened, and pass\r\nover into the compartments of the peristome (Pl. 122, figs. 10, 11, 14).\r\nThe terminal alveole of each foot is closed.\r\n\r\nThe feet of the Medusettida are rarely quite simple and smooth (Pl. 120,\r\nfigs. 1, 5, 7, 10, &c.). Usually they are armed with numerous spines or\r\nwith elegant pencils of spathillæ. These secondary appendages or branches\r\nare also hollow, with a {1666}thin wall of silex; but they seem usually not\r\nto communicate with the alveoles of the foot directly; the cavities of the\r\nfoot and its appendages are separated by a thin, solid septum. In\r\n_Medusetta_ the convex outer edge of each curved foot is studded with a\r\nseries of simple alveolate branches (Pl. 120, figs. 2-4). In _Gazelletta_,\r\nthe feet are usually armed with verticillate or alternate spines, which are\r\neither simple or branched (Pl. 120, figs. 11-15); sometimes each branch is\r\nelegantly arborescent (Pl. 118, fig. 1). Sometimes the distal end of each\r\nbranch is armed with a spathilla or a coronet of recurved teeth. The\r\nbranches attain their highest development in the admirable _Gorgonetta_\r\n(Pl. 119). The twelve feet of this most interesting genus are\r\ndifferentiated into two different and alternating groups, six descending\r\nand six ascending. The six upper or ascending feet are arborescent, and\r\neach branch is armed at the distal end with a spathilla (figs. 1, 2). The\r\nsix lower or descending feet are covered with most elegant arborescent\r\npencils or anchor-bearing trees; each terminal branch of a tree is armed\r\nwith two spathillæ, a smaller terminal and a larger below it (figs. 3, 4).\r\nThe distal ends of the feet are rarely simple, usually they are forked or\r\nbranched, or armed with peculiar spathillæ; and sometimes these terminal\r\nbranches are very large (Pls. 118, 119).\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Medusettida is usually subspherical or\r\nsomewhat lenticular, and hidden in the aboral or upper part of the\r\nshell-cavity, whilst its oral or lower part is filled up by the phæodium\r\n(Pl. 120, figs. 2, 9, 10, 11). Sometimes the phæodium is very large and\r\nprominent at the aperture of the mouth (Pl. 118, figs. 2, 3; Pl. 119, fig.\r\n1). The nucleus is usually ellipsoidal, half as large as the central\r\ncapsule, and includes numerous nucleoli. The membrane of the central\r\ncapsule seems in all Medusettida to possess only one opening, the astropyle\r\nor main-opening with a radiate operculum and proboscis, placed at the lower\r\nor oral pole (Pl. 120, fig. 2). I have never been able to observe any\r\nsecondary opening or parapyle. The free space between the shell wall and\r\nthe capsule is filled up by the calymma, which also includes the phæodium.\r\nThe jelly of the calymma is probably in direct continuity with the jelly\r\nwhich fills up the alveoles of the shell-wall and of the articulate feet.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Medusettida._\r\n\r\n  I.

This similarity\r\nis the greater, as in the few observed species an apical horn is developed\r\n(as also in the following genus). The three feet are in the two species\r\nobserved of equal size and similar form, and equidistant, so that they\r\ncannot be distinguished as an odd caudal and two paired lateral feet, as in\r\nthe similar NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Cortinetta tripodiscus_, n. sp.

This similarity is the greater, as usually the four feet\r\nare elegantly curved and the entrance in the shell-cavity partly closed by\r\na marginal diaphragm, comparable to the velum of the Craspedotæ or\r\nHydromedusæ. In all the species observed the apex of the shell bears a\r\nslender vertical or curved spine, comparable to the apical horn of the\r\nNASSELLARIA. In most species the feet bear on their convex outside a series\r\nof teeth or branches, which are also alveolate.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Medusetta codonium_, n. sp.

The\r\nnumber of species, too, is in this genus much larger than in all the other\r\ngenera of this family. It differs from the latter in the possession of six\r\nfeet, which number is very constant in the majority of species; in some\r\nspecies, however, single specimens are not rarely found which possess five\r\nor seven feet instead of six. Usually the six feet are rather regularly\r\nformed and disposed, and diverge downwards; but sometimes there is more or\r\nless {1671}irregularity in their shape and arrangement. In the majority of\r\nspecies the feet are very long, curved, and armed in a very various manner,\r\nso that four subgenera may be distinguished, according to the armatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Gazellarium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Feet simple, smooth, without spines and without terminal\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Gazelletta hexanema_, n. sp.

Its general shape is very similar to that of a larva of a\r\n_Geryonia_ or _Carmarina_, in which six interradial larval tentacles are\r\ndirected upwards, six alternating perradial permanent tentacles downwards.\r\nThe six ascending feet are in all the four species observed smaller, more\r\nor less branched, and armed with spathillæ. The six descending feet are\r\nmuch larger and covered with very elegant pencils, the single threads of\r\nwhich bear a double spathilla.

Six\r\ndescending feet about twice as {1675}long as the six alternate ascending,\r\nnearly straight, covered with numerous elegant pencils. Each pencil is\r\nrichly branched, with fifty to one hundred or more thread-like ramules, and\r\neach terminal ramule has two cruciate spathillæ, a larger proximal and a\r\nsmaller distal (figs. 3, 4); the four recurved anchor-teeth of the proximal\r\nspathilla are twice as large as those of the distal. The distal end of each\r\ndescending foot bears three or four very stout terminal branches, each of\r\nwhich is about as long as the shell and again trifurcate at the distal end.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.2 to 0.3, breadth 0.4 to 0.5.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, Stations 346 to 348, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Gorgonetta geryonia_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell hemispherical, twice as broad as long, with short scattered thorns on\r\nthe surface. Twelve feet of similar shape to those in the preceding\r\nspecies, but differing in the following characters:--the six ascending feet\r\nare much smaller, about as long as the breadth of the shell, and each bears\r\nonly six to twelve short branches; the six descending feet are about three\r\ntimes as long as the shell, more or less curved; their pencils much\r\nsmaller, and the two spathillæ of each pencil-thread bear five\r\nanchor-teeth.

The six descending feet\r\nare about five times as long as the shell, irregularly curved, studded with\r\nnumerous small pencils, each thread of which bears a double spathilla with\r\nsix teeth. The distal ends are irregularly branched.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.2, breadth 0.7.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 318, depth 2040 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Gorgonetta bisenaria_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell campanulate, similar to that of _Gazelletta melusina_ (Pl. 118, fig.\r\n1), with smooth surface.

The\r\nfew specimens of this genus that have been observed are rather different;\r\nand it may be that only the two first species described in the following\r\nlines are true Medusettida; they possess the usual distinctly alveolate\r\nfeet, and are derived from the similar _Medusetta_ or _Gazelletta_ simply\r\nby multiplication of the feet. The two other species, however (figured in\r\nPl. 116, figs. 1, 2, as _Porospathis_), belong perhaps to another family of\r\nPHÆODARIA (Castanellida?); their shell-structure is peculiar and their feet\r\nnot distinctly alveolate; they may therefore represent a peculiar genus\r\n_Porospathis_ (Haeckel, Sitzungsb. med.-nat.

Shell-wall hollow, with\r\nsubregular hexagonal alveoles. Peristome prolonged into a short\r\nfunnel-shaped proboscis, twice as long as the similar velum of the latter.\r\nThe velum is surrounded by a corona of eight larger and eight to twelve\r\nsmaller feet; the larger are about as long as the shell, divergent,\r\nirregularly curved, thorny, and distinctly alveolate; the smaller feet are\r\nscattered above the latter and form an immediate transition to the small\r\nspines of the shell-surface.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.08, breadth 0.09.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 284, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1677}3. _Polypetta tabulata_, n. sp.

On the surface of the shell\r\nare scattered numerous (thirty to forty or more), cylindrical, hollow,\r\nradial spines, which are straight or slightly curved, not distinctly\r\nalveolate, and increase in size towards the mouth. The aboral spines are\r\nscarcely one-third as long as the radius of the shell, whilst the oral\r\nspines are three times as long as its diameter. The proboscis of the\r\nconstricted mouth is a hollow cylinder, longer than the shell-radius, and\r\narmed with a corona of fifteen to twenty slender bristle-shaped teeth.

The hollow papillæ of the surface,\r\nbetween which are placed numerous circular pores (or dimples?), open into\r\nthe shell-cavity by a small pore (fig. 1_a_); they are perhaps reduced\r\nradial spines. The constricted peristome is conical and prolonged into an\r\ninversely conical proboscis, which is about as long as the radius of the\r\nshell; its dilated mouth is surrounded by a corona of slender, divergent,\r\nbristle-shaped teeth.

Gesellsch. Jena, Dec.\r\n      12, p. 5.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a spherical or subspherical shell, exhibiting\r\nordinary lattice-work, with circular or roundish pores. Radial spines\r\nwithout circles of basal pores. Mouth of the shell large, usually circular\r\nand armed with teeth. Central capsule excentric, placed in the aboral half\r\nof the shell-cavity.\r\n\r\n{1678}The family #Castanellida# represents a common and widely distributed\r\ngroup of PHÆODARIA, which posses a very simple and uniform shell, viz., a\r\nsimple lattice-sphere with radial spines and one simple mouth. It may\r\ntherefore be easily confounded with the Coscinommida, or those #Sphæroidea#\r\nin which the shell is also a simple lattice-sphere armed with radial spines\r\n(_Astrosphærida simplicia_, p. 209). Indeed the shell of both groups is\r\nvery similar, and differs in one important point only; the Castanellida\r\nconstantly possess one larger opening in the shell-wall, the shell-mouth,\r\nwhich is either smooth or armed with a corona of teeth; in the\r\nCoscinommida, however, such a mouth is never present. The living specimens\r\nof both groups, and those shells in which the soft body is preserved, are\r\nvery easily distinguished, since the shell encloses in the Coscinommida the\r\ncentral capsule and the transparent calymma only, whilst the latter,\r\nbesides, in the Castanellida contains a voluminous dark brown or green mass\r\nof phæodella, the characteristic phæodium. A closer examination of the\r\ncentral capsule reveals in all Castanellida the typical operculum, the\r\nastropyle, with the proboscis of the PHÆODARIA, which is never present in\r\nany #Sphæroidea#.\r\n\r\nThe Castanellida are easily distinguished also from those similar PHÆODARIA\r\nin which the shell is also a lattice-sphere; the lattice-work is constantly\r\nquite simple, as in the similar Coscinommida, never composed of separated\r\ntangential pieces (as in the Aulosphærida), or of porcellanous structure,\r\nwith basal circles of pores (as in the Circoporida), or of diatomaceous\r\nstructure (as in the Challengerida). The gigantic Orosphærida, which also\r\nin part posses a simple lattice-sphere, differ from the Castanellida in the\r\nabsence of the peculiar shell-mouth.\r\n\r\nThough the Castanellida belong to the most common PHÆODARIA, and though the\r\nnumber of individuals, floating on the surface of the tropical seas, is\r\nextraordinarily great, their variety of forms is very small; the six genera\r\ndistinguished in the following system differ only in very slight\r\ncharacters, and the majority of the species are very similar, and often\r\nhardly distinguishable. The seven species figured in Pl. 113 exhibit the\r\nmost striking differences which I could distinguish among all the species\r\nobserved. The shell usually has the characteristic appearance of a\r\nchestnut, a sphere covered with very numerous short radial spines or\r\nbristles. In the majority of species a certain number of longer thin radial\r\nspines is scattered over the surface; these are usually simple, rarely\r\nbranched. The mouth of the shell, corresponding to the proboscis of the\r\ncentral capsule, and placed in the same radius, is either a quite simple\r\nlarger opening with a smooth margin (figs. 3, 5, 7) or is armed with a\r\ncorona of teeth (figs. 1, 6).\r\n\r\nThe size of the shell varies between 0.2 and 0.8 mm., and is usually\r\nbetween 0.3 and 0.5 mm. Its form is in the majority of species a\r\ngeometrical sphere; rarely it is somewhat irregular, slightly ellipsoidal\r\n(prolonged in the axis of the mouth and proboscis), or polyhedral (by\r\nconical protuberances from the bases of the radial spines). {1679}The ideal\r\nfundamental form of the shell, however, is constantly monaxonian, since the\r\nplace of the shell-mouth and of the proboscis of the capsule (both lying in\r\none axis of the sphere), causes a principal axis to be different from all\r\nothers. The longer radial spines, quite variable in number and disposition,\r\nare never arranged regularly or symmetrically, and therefore determine no\r\nconstant axes.\r\n\r\nThe lattice-work of the spherical shell offers also but slight differences.\r\nIt is usually more or less irregular, with circular or subcircular pores of\r\nunequal sizes. More rarely the network is perfectly regular, with\r\nequidistant circular pores of equal size, and sometimes these are\r\nsurrounded by hexagonal frames (fig. 6), as in many #Sphæroidea#. More\r\nrarely the pores are perfectly irregular, roundish or sometimes polygonal,\r\nof unequal sizes and dissimilar forms (fig. 2). The size of the pores is\r\nvery variable between 0.01 and 0.05, usually between 0.015 and 0.025. They\r\nare commonly somewhat broader than the bars between them, more rarely\r\nsmaller. The substance of the shell-wall is in the the majority of\r\nCastanellida hyaline, transparent (as in the similar #Sphæroidea#); in some\r\nlarger forms, however, a network of fine axial filaments is visible in the\r\nlattice (fig. 2), and sometimes this seems to be hollow, with an axial\r\ncanal (as in the large Orosphærida). Such an axial filament or fine axial\r\ncanal is usually visible in the larger radial spines. The shell-wall of the\r\nCastanellida, however, never exhibits that characteristic structure (with\r\ntangential needles in a cement-like fundamental substance), which we find\r\nin all Circoporida. The latter differ also in the constant presence of\r\ncircles of large pores around the bases of the radial spines, which are\r\nnever found in the Castanellida. The shell becomes usually stained more or\r\nless purple by carmine, and when burned by fire, becomes of a brown colour.\r\n\r\nThe inner surface of the shell is always quite smooth, the outer surface\r\narmed with numerous short and thin radial bristles. Sometimes these\r\nbristles or \"by-spines\" are very short, but never perfectly wanting.\r\nUsually their length is about one-third or one-fourth of the radius of the\r\nshell, often less, rarely more. They arise from the nodal points between\r\nevery three or four neighbouring spines, and are commonly very thin and\r\nstraight, pointed, with slightly thickened conical basis. Rarely they are\r\ndirected not quite radially, but more or less obliquely.\r\n\r\nThe larger radial spines, which arise between the thin bristles or\r\n\"by-spines\" and may be opposed to the latter as \"main-spines,\" are wanting\r\nin two genera only, in _Castanarium_ and _Castanella_ (Pl. 113, fig. 6).\r\nThey are simple in _Castanidium_ (figs. 2, 5, 7) and _Castanissa_ (fig. 1),\r\nirregularly branched in _Castanopsis_ and _Castanura_ (figs. 3, 4). Their\r\nnumber and disposition is never regular nor symmetrical (as in the majority\r\nof #Sphæroidea#) and varies even in each single species. In general the\r\nnumber of main-spines varies between ten and forty (rarely less or more)\r\nusually between twenty and thirty. Their length is commonly about equal to\r\nthe diameter of the shell, often somewhat shorter, rarely considerably\r\nlonger. Their {1680}thickness is in the majority of species about equal to\r\nthe diameter of one or two pores of the lattice. Sometimes they are much\r\nstronger, rarely thinner.\r\n\r\nThe form of the radial main-spines is not very variable, usually it is\r\ncylindrical or cylindro-conical, rarely angular, prismatic or pyramidal.\r\nSometimes they are straight (perfectly radial), at other times more or less\r\nirregularly curved. Usually they are simple, rarely branched; the branches\r\nare always very irregular and exhibit a remarkable tendency to unite by\r\nconcrescence (figs. 3, 4). Some thicker forms of spines exhibit a\r\nremarkable structure, the surface being covered with small dimples and\r\nspinules between them (fig. 1); sometimes the dimples are hexagonal (fig.\r\n5_a_). In the axis of the thicker spines there is often visible the same\r\naxial filament or funicle which we find in many other PHÆODARIA, more\r\nrarely a hollow axial canal.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the shell is usually circular, more rarely polygonal or\r\nirregularly roundish (fig. 2). It is either quite smooth (fig. 3, 5, 7) or\r\narmed with a corona of strong teeth (figs. 1, 4, 6). These teeth are\r\ndifferent from the other spines of the shell; they are much thicker than\r\nthe radial bristles, and shorter than the main-spines. Their number varies\r\nbetween three and twenty, usually between five and seven. They are usually\r\nparallel to the main axis, which is determined by the excentric position of\r\nthe mouth and the centre of the sphere (figs. 1, 6). The teeth are usually\r\nconical, more or less irregular in size and form, more rarely of equal\r\nsize. The corona of teeth is usually sharply separated from the surrounding\r\nlattice-work of the shell, but has no influence on its regular spherical\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Castanellida immediately determines beyond\r\ndoubt their true PHÆODARIAN nature; it lies excentrically in the cavity of\r\nthe enclosing shell, and is surrounded at the oral pole by the large and\r\ndark phæodium. The latter covers the radiate operculum of the capsule\r\nmembrane and the tubular proboscis, which arises from it and is directed\r\ntowards the shell mouth. Usually the diameter of the spherical central\r\ncapsule is about one-third of the shell diameter, rarely one-quarter only,\r\nand in a few cases it attains nearly its half. The calymma, therefore, is\r\nlarger than the capsule, and fills up the whole cavity of the shell which\r\nis not occupied by the latter. The greater part of the calymma again is\r\nfilled up by the dark green or brown, sometimes black phæodella, the\r\nroundish granules which compose the voluminous non-transparent phæodium.\r\nSometimes the latter proceeds through the mouth and is partially placed\r\noutside the shell (fig. 5).\r\n\r\nThe astropyle, or the main-opening of the central capsule, is placed on the\r\noral pole of its main axis, while its radiate operculum and the tubular\r\nproboscis arising from it possess the same structure as in the other\r\nPHÆODARIA. But the two lateral parapylæ or accessory openings which are\r\npresent in the majority of the latter seem to be absent in the Castanellida\r\nas well as in the Medusettida and the Challengerida. I could never observe\r\na trace of them. The proboscis is a small cylindrical tube and is directed\r\ntowards the {1681}mouth of the shell, therefore placed in its main axis; it\r\nis usually quite hidden in the dark phæodium, which occupies the oral half\r\nof the shell-cavity, whilst the capsule lies in the aboral half. The large\r\nnucleus of the central capsule and its double membrane present the same\r\ncharacters as in the other PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Castanellida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  No long radial main-spines (in addition to the constant short bristles\r\n     of the shell-surface).\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Mouth smooth,                                      705. _Castanarium_.\r\n\r\n  Mouth dentate,                                     706. _Castanella_.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Long radial main-spines scattered between the short constant bristles\r\n     of the shell-surface.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                              { Mouth smooth,        707. _Castanidium_.\r\n  Main spines simple.         {\r\n                              { Mouth dentate,       708. _Castanissa_.\r\n\r\n                              { Mouth smooth,        709. _Castanopsis_.\r\n  Main spines branched.       {\r\n                              { Mouth dentate,       710. _Castanura_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 705. _Castanarium_,[322] Haeckel, 1879, Sitzungsb. med.-nat.\r\nGesellsch.

Gesellsch. Jena, Dec.\r\n      12, p. 5.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a spherical or polyhedral shell, exhibiting a\r\npeculiar solid porcellanous structure, with a stellate circle of radial\r\npores around the base of the hollow radial spines. Mouth usually with\r\nteeth. Surface of the shell {1690}tabulate, panelled or dimpled. Central\r\ncapsule excentric, placed in the aboral half of the shell-cavity.\r\n\r\nThe family #Circoporida# comprises those PHÆODARIA in which the simple\r\nspherical or polyhedral shell exhibits a peculiar porcellanous structure,\r\npossesses a simple mouth, and is particularly distinguished by the constant\r\ncharacter denoted by their name, viz., by circles of pores surrounding the\r\nbase of the radial spines. It agrees in these striking peculiarities with\r\nthe following family, the Tuscarorida, but differs from them essentially by\r\nthe spherical or polyhedral form of the shell, which is never ovate, with\r\nthe main axis prolonged. The radial spines, variable in number, are\r\nregularly or symmetrically disposed in all Circoporida, whilst they are\r\narranged around the poles of the main axis in all Tuscarorida. Whilst the\r\nlatter are always extremely large, more than a millimeter in size, the\r\nformer are much smaller and never reach the diameter of a millimeter. The\r\nnumber of genera and species in this family is not large, and the majority\r\nare very rare, but they belong to the most remarkable Radiolaria by the\r\npeculiar structure, as well as by the geometrical regularity of the\r\npolyhedral shell.\r\n\r\nThe Circoporida may be divided into two different subfamilies, the\r\nCircogonida and the Haeckelinida. The latter are represented by the single\r\ngenus _Haeckeliana_ (Pl. 114), and possess a spherical shell with numerous\r\nsmall dimples between the circles of pores, and numerous simple radial\r\nspines which do not exhibit a regular arrangement. The Circogonida, on the\r\nother hand, comprise all other genera (Pls. 115-117) and possess a panelled\r\nshell with polygonal plates, and a certain number of radial spines, which\r\nare regularly disposed on the corners of the polyhedral shell, and usually\r\narmed with verticillate bristles and terminal forks or spathillæ. Perhaps\r\nthe Circogonida and Haeckelinida may be better considered as two separate\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical fundamental form of the shell is in the Circoporida of the\r\nhighest interest, since it exhibits regular proportions, which are very\r\nrare in other organic forms, generally some rare forms of regular\r\npolyhedrons. The shell in all members of this family belongs to that group\r\nof geometrical forms which I have called in my General Morphology\r\n\"_Polyaxonia_\" (vol. i., 1866, pp. 406-416). The shell therefore is\r\nconstantly an \"endospherical polyhedron,\" _i.e._, a polyhedron, all the\r\ncorners of which lie in a spherical surface. The corners are always\r\nindicated by the bases of the radial spines arising from the surface of the\r\nshell and marking its axes, and it is immaterial whether the shell itself\r\nis a true polyhedron or a sphere; for in the latter case also the radial\r\nspines mark the axes of the polyhedron.\r\n\r\nThe six genera which we here distinguish among the Circoporida, represent\r\nsix different fundamental forms. _Circoporus_ (Pl. 115, figs. 1-3; Pl. 117,\r\nfigs. 5, 6) possesses six radial spines, opposite in pairs in three\r\ndiameters, perpendicular one to another; it agrees therefore with the\r\nCubosphærida (p. 169, Pls. 21-25) and {1691}represents the regular\r\noctahedron, with eight congruent triangular faces and six corners. It has\r\nthe same form as the well-known antheridia of Chara (Gener. Morphol., vol.\r\ni. p. 412). _Circogonia_ (Pl. 115, figs. 8-10; Pl. 117, fig. 1) exhibits\r\ntwelve radial spines, opposite in pairs in six equidistant diameters. The\r\nsurface of the shell is divided into twenty equal and equilateral\r\ntriangles, and agrees therefore with the regular icosahedron. The same form\r\nappears also in some forms of _Aulosphæra_, and in several Astrosphærida\r\n(Gener. Morphol., vol. i. p. 411). _Circorrhegma_ (Pl. 117, fig. 2)\r\npossesses a regular shell with twelve equal pentagonal faces and twenty\r\nequidistant corners, from which arise twenty regularly disposed radial\r\nspines. It represents therefore the regular \"pentagonal dodecahedron,\" the\r\nsame remarkable form which is found in some Astrosphærida, and in the\r\npollen-grains of some plants, _e.g._, _Bucholzia maritima_, _Fumaria\r\nspicata_, _Polygonum amphibium_, &c. (Gener. Morphol., vol. i. p. 412, Taf.\r\nii. fig. 18).\r\n\r\nThe three genera of Circoporida mentioned therefore represent three\r\ndifferent forms of regular polyhedrons, in the exact mathematical sense,\r\nviz., _Circoporus_, the regular octahedron, _Circogonia_, the regular\r\nicosahedron, and _Circorrhegma_, the regular dodecahedron. In each of these\r\nthree regular forms all the faces, edges, and corners are equal. The\r\nremaining three genera of Circoporida represent, however, three forms of\r\nsubregular or irregular endospherical polyhedra, which are not perfectly\r\nregular. _Circospathis_ (Pl. 115, figs. 4-7; Pl. 117, fig. 3) is a rather\r\ncommon form, and constantly possesses nine symmetrically disposed radial\r\nspines; the shell is either spherical or polyhedral, with fourteen\r\ntriangular faces and thirty edges; the nine spines lie in three meridional\r\nplanes, which are crossed at equal angles (three equidistant spines in each\r\nplane). We call this remarkable form the tetradecahedron; it appears also\r\nin some Astrosphærida (_e.g._, in _Haliomma echinaster_, figured in my\r\nMonograph, Taf. xxiv. fig. 1). _Circostephanus_ (Pl. 116, fig. 3) exhibits\r\na subregular polyhedral shell with a variable number of triangular faces\r\nand of radial spines (twenty-four to forty or more). _Circostephanus\r\nsexagenarius_ possesses sixty triangular equilateral faces, which are\r\ndisposed in twelve pentagonal groups (each with five faces), so that the\r\nshell seems to be derived from a regular pentagonal dodecahedron, the\r\ntwelve regular faces of which are divided each into five congruent\r\ntriangles. From its corners arise thirty-two radial spines (twelve from the\r\ncentral points of the pentagons, twenty from the meeting corners of every\r\nthree pentagons). In other cases the number of faces and radial spines\r\nseems to be larger and their arrangement more irregular. The same may be\r\nsaid of _Haeckeliana_, in which the dimpled shell is constantly spherical,\r\nand possesses a variable number of radial spines, from sixteen to\r\nfifty-five (usually between thirty and forty).\r\n\r\nThe structure of the shell in the Circoporida is the same as in the\r\nTuscarorida, of a peculiar porcellanous nature. The shell-wall is very\r\nthick, more or less opaque, and in direct light whitish or yellowish. Its\r\nsurface is dimpled, with numerous small, circular, {1692}roundish or\r\npolygonal dimples in _Haeckeliana_ (Pl. 114, figs. 1-6). In the\r\nCircogonida, however, the surface is panelled, with regular or irregular\r\npolygonal plates, often separated by high prominent crests (Pl. 115, figs.\r\n4-9, &c.). Numerous simple thin needles of silica lie tangentially disposed\r\nand irregularly scattered in the porcellanous or cement-like substance of\r\nthe thick shell-wall. Under a strong lens this substance appears finely\r\npunctate, being probably pierced by numerous very fine pores. The surface\r\nof the shell is therefore minutely roughened, and often appears quite black\r\nunder the microscope, by the adhesion of innumerable fine air-bubbles. In\r\nall Circoporida, as well is in the Tuscarorida, the porcellanous shell has\r\nnot the perfect transparency of the purely siliceous shells of other\r\nRadiolaria; its refractive power is somewhat different from the latter; it\r\nbecomes deeply stained by carmine and browned by fire, and seems therefore\r\nto consist of a peculiar carbonic silicate.\r\n\r\nThe shell in all Circoporida exhibits a simple, excentric mouth, which\r\ncorresponds to the main osculum of the central capsule. The excentric\r\nposition of this shell-mouth has no influence on the regular form of the\r\nshell. The mouth is either circular or polygonal, usually about as large as\r\na basal circle of pores. It is always armed with prominent conical or\r\npyramidal teeth, the number of which is variable and seems to depend partly\r\nupon the number of the shell-faces or the radial spines. _Circoporus_ has\r\nusually four cruciate teeth (Pl. 115, fig. 1; Pl. 117, figs. 4, 5).\r\n_Circorrhegma_ exhibits a pentagonal mouth with five teeth (Pl. 117, fig.\r\n2). _Circogonia_ possesses a hexagonal mouth with six teeth (Pl. 115, fig.\r\n8; Pl. 117, fig. 1). _Circospathis_ has no constant number; some species\r\nhave five teeth (Pl. 115, fig. 4), others four (Pl. 115, fig. 10), others\r\nnine (Pl. 117, fig. 3_a_). _Circostephanus_ is also variable; one species\r\nexhibits eight teeth (Pl. 116, fig. 3_a_), another ten, another twelve. In\r\n_Haeckeliana_ (Pl. 114, fig. 3) the teeth are smaller and more numerous.\r\nUsually the teeth arise vertically from the surface of the shell and are\r\nspinulate; more rarely their points are directed towards the centre of the\r\nmouth. Sometimes numerous thin needles arise between the teeth (Pl. 115,\r\nfig. 10).\r\n\r\nThe radial spines of the Circoporida are tubular, usually cylindrical and\r\nconical at the thickened base, more rarely prismatic or slenderly\r\npyramidal, with three or more edges; sometimes the edges are spirally wound\r\naround the axis (Pl. 115, fig. 6). In the majority of species their length\r\nis about equal to the diameter of the shell; often they are somewhat\r\nshorter, more rarely longer. Their tubular structure is always the same as\r\nin the Tuscarorida; the wall of the tube is thick, and in the axis of its\r\ncavity lies an axial cord or funicle, which is connected with the wall by\r\nnumerous horizontal, simple, or branched threads (Pl. 115, figs. 6, 7). The\r\naxial funicle itself is either a simple thread of silica, or a strand,\r\ncomposed of three to fifteen or more filaments, which are closely twisted\r\nlike a rope around the axis of the spine, and arise separately from the\r\nbridges between the pores of the basal circle (Pl. 115, figs. 7, 9). The\r\nnumber of {1693}pores in these circles is very variable, commonly from\r\nthree to nine, sometimes twelve to fifteen or more; their form is usually\r\nirregularly ovate (Pl. 115, figs. 7, 9). The bridges between the pores\r\nusually bear numerous siliceous threads or bristles, which are curved\r\ndownwards or upwards (Pl. 115, figs. 4-6). Sometimes the spines are\r\nentirely covered with similar bristles or cilia (Pl. 117, figs. 2-5), more\r\nrarely with regular verticils of lateral branches (Pl. 117, fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThe distal ends of the radial spines are simple in _Haeckeliana_ (Pl. 114),\r\nwhilst in the other Circoporida they are usually (or perhaps constantly)\r\neither forked or armed with a verticil of terminal branches. When the\r\nspines are simply forked, their two terminal branches lie in certain\r\nmeridional planes (Pl. 117, fig. 5). The same is probably the case when\r\nthey bear three divergent branches (Pl. 115, figs. 1, 2), or four crossed\r\nbranches (Pl. 117, figs. 4, 6). The larger species usually bear a corona of\r\nfive curved branches disposed around the distal apex of each spine (Pl.\r\n116, fig. 3; Pl. 117, figs. 1, 2). Sometimes the formation of these coronas\r\nis twice or more often repeated, so that the spines appear verticillate.\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Circoporida (Pl. 115, fig. 8; Pl. 117, fig. 6)\r\nis usually about half as large as the enclosing shell, and lies\r\nexcentrically in that half of its cavity which is remote from the\r\nshell-mouth (Pl. 115, fig. 8). The other half (near the mouth) is filled up\r\nby the cap-shaped, dark phæodium. The proboscis, or the central tubule of\r\nthe astropyle, is hidden in the axis of the blackish phæodium, and is\r\ndirected towards the mouth of the shell; it is often S-shaped, more or less\r\ncurved. The circular radiate operculum of the astropyle, placed on the base\r\nof the proboscis, exhibits numerous branched radial ribs, and closes the\r\nmain-opening like the lid of a tea-kettle (Pl. 115, fig. 3). The number of\r\nthe parapylæ, or the accessory openings of the capsule, which in the\r\nmajority of PHÆODARIA is two, seems to be usually increased in the\r\nCircoporida. In _Circoporus_ the capsule seems to posses six and in\r\n_Circospathis_ nine secondary openings, and therefore there is some\r\nprobability that each circle of pores on the base of a radial spine\r\ncorresponds to a secondary opening of the capsule. In _Haeckeliana_,\r\nhowever (Pl. 114), I could observe no parapylæ at all. These accessory\r\nopenings are always very small in the Circoporida, and may be easily\r\noverlooked. Furthermore, the number of observations respecting this\r\ndifficult point is too small, and their certainty not satisfactory; it\r\nrequires therefore further accurate examination, as also does the whole\r\ncentral capsule of the Circoporida.\r\n\r\nThe numerous and remarkable characters of shape and structure, which we\r\nhave described above as occurring in the Circoporida, are also found in the\r\nfollowing closely allied family, the Tuscarorida; all the species are\r\ninhabitants of great depths. Perhaps it may therefore be more convenient to\r\nseparate these two families from the other PHÆOGROMIA as a peculiar order,\r\nunder the name PHÆOCALPIA.\r\n\r\n{1694}_Synopsis of the Genera of Circoporida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

From the twelve corners of the regular\r\nicosahedron (where every five triangular plates meet), twelve equal radial\r\nspines arise, each of which is surrounded at the base by a corona of nine\r\nto sixteen pores. Two species only of _Circogonia_ have been observed; the\r\none has smooth spines, forked at the distal end, {1698}the other bears\r\nnumerous curved bristles around each spine, and at the distal end a\r\nverticil of five curved branches. The mouth of the shell (placed in the\r\ncentre of one of the triangular plates) is in both species armed with six\r\nteeth.

All #Phæocalpia#\r\n(the Tuscarorida as well as the Circoporida) are inhabitants of great\r\ndepths, usually between 2000 and 3000 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThough the number of Tuscarorida at present known is small (only three\r\ngenera, with ten species), they represent a very distinct and remarkable\r\nfamily of PHÆODARIA, as well by their considerable size, as by the peculiar\r\narrangement of the radial spines and the structure of the shell-wall, which\r\nin some species is more solid and thicker than in any other Radiolaria. The\r\ndiameter of the shell is always more than 1 mm., usually between 1 and 2,\r\nand sometimes more than 3 mm.\r\n\r\nThe dry shell of the Tuscarorida is not hyaline and transparent as is usual\r\nin the other Radiolaria, but perfectly opaque, milk-white or\r\nyellowish-white. This opacity is caused by innumerable very fine pores,\r\nwhich everywhere pierce the thick, apparently solid, fundamental substance\r\nof the shell-wall. Besides those very small pores, it is also pierced by a\r\ncertain number of larger pores, which are scattered at wide distances\r\n(Narr. Chall. Exp., vol. i. pl. A, fig. 15_b_). These larger pores or\r\npore-channels have a diameter of about 0.01 mm., and pierce the shell-wall\r\neither in a perpendicular or in an oblique direction. Very numerous\r\nstraight, simple, and thin needles, usually 0.1 to 0.2 mm. in length,\r\nsimilar to the thin tangential needles of the Aulacanthida, are everywhere\r\nscattered tangentially in the cement-like fundamental substance, which\r\nseems to be a peculiar carbonic silicate; their axis is parallel to the\r\nshell-surface.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the shell is somewhat different in the three genera of\r\nTuscarorida; ovate or spherical in _Tuscarora_ and _Tuscarusa_, which bear\r\nno caudal axial spine (Pl. 100, figs. 1-7), or sometimes three-sided\r\npyramidal (fig. 4); it is spindle-shaped in _Tuscaridium_, which bears on\r\nthe aboral pore an axial caudal spine (Pl. 100, fig. 8). In every case the\r\nmain axis of the shell, determining its monaxonian fundamental form, is\r\nindicated by the mouth, which is placed in the oral pole of the main axis\r\nand prolonged into a short tube or proboscis.\r\n\r\nThe hollow apophyses, arising from the shell of the Tuscarorida, are always\r\ncylindrical, long and thin tubules, the narrow cavity of which communicates\r\ndirectly with the large shell-cavity. In the axis of the tubules lies a\r\nthin axial chord or funicle, composed of a few (usually three or four)\r\nsiliceous threads which arise from bridges between the basal pores of the\r\napophyses, and are twisted together like the strands of a rope. The axial\r\nfunicle is connected with the thin wall of the tubular apophyses by\r\ninnumerable very thin radial beams, perpendicular to the axis (Pl. 100,\r\nfig. 3_a_, 5_b_). The surface of the apophyses is almost constantly covered\r\nwith numerous small bristles or spines, which are usually curved and\r\ndirected towards their distal ends.\r\n\r\n_Tuscarora_ (Pl. 100, figs. 1-6) exhibits two different groups of\r\napophyses, which may be distinguished according to their different position\r\nand direction as \"circoral {1704}teeth\" and \"aboral feet\"; the teeth\r\nimmediately surround the opening of the mouth, whilst the feet are remote\r\nfrom it and usually placed in the aboral half of the body, more rarely in\r\nthe equator or in the oral half. The general form and structure are the\r\nsame in both groups of apophyses, but their position and direction is\r\ndifferent; the circoral teeth are directed forwards, often parallel (at the\r\nbase at least), while the aboral feet are either divergent and directed\r\nbackwards, or they diverge forwards in the basal part, then form a large\r\narch, and finally curve backwards.\r\n\r\nThe number of the aboral feet, and their position relative to the circoral\r\nteeth, are different but probably constant in each single species, and\r\nserve, in the first place, for the distinction of genera and species.\r\n_Tuscarora_ (in restricted sense) (Pl. 100, figs. 1-6), has constantly\r\nthree feet (comparable to the three cortinar feet of the tripodal\r\nNASSELLARIA); _Tuscarusa_ (Pl. 100, fig. 7) has four feet, opposite in\r\npairs and forming a regular cross; _Tuscaridium_, finally (Pl. 100, fig.\r\n8), has only one foot, which is situated in the main axis, on its aboral\r\npole, and may therefore be called a caudal spine.\r\n\r\nThe number of the circoral teeth varies from two to four, and is usually\r\nthree. Originally these three teeth alternate regularly with the three\r\naboral feet, so that the latter may be regarded as perradial, the former as\r\ninterradial (Pl. 100, figs. 1-4). The proportion of the number of each\r\ngroup of apophyses in the different species is synoptically shown in the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\n  a = Depth in Fathoms.\r\n  b = Challenger Station.\r\n  c = Length of the Shell.\r\n  d = Breadth of the Shell.\r\n  e = Number of Feet.\r\n  f = Number of Pedal Pores.\r\n  g = Number of Teeth.\r\n  h = Number of Dental Pores.\r\n  +------------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |                              |   a  |  b  |  c  |  d  | e | f | g | h |\r\n  +------------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+---+---+---+---+\r\n  | 1. _Tuscarora bisternaria_,  | 3000 | 264 | 2.0 | 1.5 | 3 | 8 | 3 | 8 |\r\n  | 2.      \"    _murrayi_,      | 2000 | 295 | 2.5 | 1.5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |\r\n  | 3.      \"    _wyvillei_,     | 2250 | 291 | 1.5 | 1.4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 |\r\n  | 4.      \"    _tetrahedra_,   | 2450 | 348 | 2.5 | 2.0 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 |\r\n  | 5.      \"    _tubulosa_,     | 3000 | 249 | 1.4 | 1.2 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 3 |\r\n  | 6.      \"    _porcellana_,   | 2650 | 325 | 1.5 | 1.3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 |\r\n  | 7.      \"    _belknapii_,    | 2025 | 293 | 2.5 | 1.5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 |\r\n  | 8. _Tuscarusa medusa_,       | 3125 | 253 | 1.2 | 1.0 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 |\r\n  | 9. _Tuscaridium cygneum_,    | 3050 | 250 | 3.2 | 1.6 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 4 |\r\n  |10.      \"   _lithornithium_, | 3000 | 264 | 3.6 | 1.8 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 6 |\r\n  +------------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+---+---+---+---+\r\n\r\nThe base of the apophyses in all Tuscarorida is inflated, conical, and\r\npierced by a small number of large ovate pores, the typical \"basal pores,\"\r\nwhich occur also in the closely allied Circoporida. The number of these\r\nbasal pores varies from two to eight, and is usually three or four; it\r\nnever becomes in this family so great as in the Circoporida, where each\r\ncircle of pores is often composed of sixteen to twenty-four or more basal\r\npores. The number seems to be rather constant in each single species, as\r\nmay be seen in the preceding Table. The pedal pores (on the base of the\r\naboral feet) are usually larger than the dental pores (on the base of the\r\ncircoral teeth). Their form is {1705}usually irregularly ovate or\r\ntriangular; their outer aperture is armed with spines or bristles, which\r\nare commonly larger than in the other parts of the apophyses.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the shell varies in form, according to the number and\r\narrangement of the teeth on its corners. It is therefore a narrow\r\ntransverse fissure, with two broad opposite lips and two corners, in the\r\nbidental forms (Pl. 100, figs. 5, 7), triangular in the tridental species\r\n(figs. 1-4), quadrangular or square in the quadridental species, _Tuscarora\r\nbelknapii_ (Narr. Chall. Exp., _loc. cit._, pl. A, fig. 15). The singular\r\ngenus _Tuscaridium_ (fig. 8) exhibits four teeth, which are nearly\r\nhorizontally divergent in two pairs, a dorsal and a ventral pair\r\n(corresponding in position to the four feet of _Tuscarusa_, fig. 7); the\r\nmouth is here prolonged into a cylindrical, spinulate proboscis, which is\r\ncurved towards the ventral face of the shell (fig. 8).\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Tuscarorida is kidney-shaped or spheroidal,\r\nscarcely half as large as the dark olive-green phæodium, which surrounds\r\nits anterior (oral) face. Usually the capsule and the phæodium together\r\nfill up the aboral half of the shell-cavity, and are separated from its\r\nwalls by the calymma. The latter is pierced by numerous branched and\r\nreticulately anastomosing pseudopodia, which arise from the matrix\r\nenveloping the capsule, and pass over into a thin layer of sarcode,\r\nadjacent to the inner surface of the shell. The astropyle or the\r\nmain-opening of the central capsule exhibits the usual radiate operculum\r\nand tubular proboscis of the PHÆODARIA (Pl. 115, fig. 3), and is directed\r\ntowards the mouth of the shell. The number of the parapylæ or accessory\r\nopenings seems to be variable in this family, and to correspond to the\r\nnumber of radial feet which arise from the shell. Therefore _Tuscaridium_\r\npossesses only one parapyle, which is diametrically opposite to the mouth,\r\nlies on the aboral pole of the capsule, and is directed towards the single\r\ncaudal tube. _Tuscarora_ seems to have three parapylæ, corresponding to the\r\nthree radial feet, and _Tuscarusa_ probably has four parapylæ, directed\r\ntowards its four radial feet; in the latter genus, however, the capsule was\r\nnot observed (the shell being empty); and in the other Tuscarorida this\r\nimportant and difficult anatomical question must be solved by further\r\naccurate examinations.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus is nearly half as large as the central capsule, ellipsoidal,\r\nand contains numerous nucleoli. In one specimen of _Tuscarora belknapii_ I\r\nobserved two nuclei in the central capsule, and in another specimen of the\r\nsame species John Murray observed two central capsules (figured by him in\r\nthe Narr. Chall. Exp., vol i. pl. A, fig. 15).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Tuscarorida._\r\n\r\n  Three equidistant aboral radial feet,       717. _Tuscarora_.\r\n  Four equidistant aboral radial feet,        718. _Tuscarusa_.\r\n  One single aboral foot or terminal spine,   719. _Tuscaridium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1706}Genus 717. _Tuscarora_,[333] John Murray, 1876, _in schedulis_,\r\nChall.

The central capsule is placed in the aboral\r\nhalf of the shell-cavity, and so enclosed between both valves, that its\r\nthree openings lie in the open frontal fissure between them (the astropyle\r\non the oral pole of the main axis, the two parapylæ on both sides of its\r\naboral pole, at right and left).\r\n\r\n{1711}The family #Concharida# and the two following closely allied\r\nfamilies, the Coelodendrida and Coelographida, compose together the most\r\nremarkable and interesting suborder of #Phæoconchia# (or \"PHÆODARIA\r\nbivalva\"), differing from all the other Radiolaria in the possession of a\r\nbivalved lattice-shell, composed of two separate valves, like the shell of\r\na Brachiopod. The central capsule is so enclosed between the two\r\nfenestrated valves that its three openings lie in the horizontal open\r\n(frontal) fissure between them, the astropyle or main-opening on the oral\r\npole of the main axis; the two secondary openings or parapylæ on the two\r\nsides of its aboral pole, at right and left. The plane in which the three\r\nopenings lie is therefore the frontal plane, dividing the entire body into\r\na dorsal and a ventral half. The two valves, accordingly, must be\r\nconsidered as dorsal and ventral valves (as in the Brachiopoda), and the\r\nsymmetrical halves of each valve as right and left. These halves may be\r\nalways easily distinguished, since the oral pole of each valve is\r\nconstantly different from the aboral pole. The voluminous phæodium always\r\nlies in the oral half, and the central capsule in the aboral half of the\r\nshell-cavity, whilst the calymma encloses the whole shell.\r\n\r\nThe Concharida differ from the other two families of bivalved PHÆODARIA in\r\nthe absence of the apical galeas, and the branched hollow tubes arising\r\nfrom them. Each of these two cupolas, which are at the opposite poles of\r\nthe sagittal axis (one cupola on the apex of each valve), is in the\r\nCoelographida connected by a simple or double frenulum with a peculiar\r\nrhinocanna, or an open nasal tube directed towards the mouth; whilst the\r\ncupolas of the Coelodendrida possess neither a rhinocanna nor a frenulum.\r\nThe three families of #Phæoconchia# may therefore represent a\r\nphylogenetical series, the common root of which are the Concharida. From\r\nthese are developed the Coelodendrida by development of an apical cupola or\r\ngalea on each valve, and of hollow radial tubes arising from it; whilst the\r\nCoelographida are developed from the latter by production of a rhinocanna\r\non the base of each cupola, and of one or two frenula connecting the former\r\nwith the latter.\r\n\r\nAll the Concharida described in the following pages (seven genera and\r\nthirty species), are perfectly new to science, and not a single form of\r\nthis interesting family was known before the explorations of the\r\nChallenger. Some species (mainly of the genera _Conchidium_ and\r\n_Conchopsis_) are by no means rare, and are found in great numbers at some\r\nstations of the tropical seas (in the Pacific as well as in the Atlantic).\r\nAll described species are closely allied, agree in the majority of\r\ncharacters, and are easy to distinguish from all the other Radiolaria. Some\r\nfew forms of Concharida, however, form a direct passage to the\r\nCoelodendrida.\r\n\r\nRegarding the probable origin of the Concharida (and therefore also of all\r\nother #Phæoconchia# derived from the latter), two different hypotheses are\r\npossible. They have either been derived directly from the skeletonless\r\n_Phæodina_, by development of a bivalved lattice-shell; or they may be\r\nderived from PHÆODARIA with a simple {1712}spherical lattice-shell\r\n(Castanellida), by the halving of this latter, or its splitting into two\r\nhemispherical valves; the former hypothesis is more probable than the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe two valves of the lattice-shell (Pls. 123-126) must in the Concharida\r\n(as in all other #Phæoconchia#) be distinguished as dorsal and ventral, and\r\nmay therefore be compared with the two valves of the Brachiopoda, not with\r\nthose of the Lamellibranchia. This important morphological distinction is\r\nexpressed by the constant position of the central capsule within the\r\nshell-cavity. The capsule always exhibits the character of the \"TRIPYLEA\"\r\nand has three tubular openings, placed in the frontal or lateral plane of\r\nthe unicellular body. In the same plane lies the open frontal fissure\r\nbetween the two valves, and the three openings are so disposed in it that\r\nthe large anterior main-opening (or the astropyle) is placed on the oral\r\npole of the main axis, whilst the two accessory small lateral openings or\r\nparapylæ are placed on both sides of the aboral pole, at the right and\r\nleft. Therefore in a dorsal or ventral view all three openings are visible\r\n(Pl. 123, figs. 1, 8_a_); in the usual lateral view, however, from the\r\nright or left side, only two openings are visible, the astropyle on the\r\nanterior, and one parapyle (right or left) near the posterior pole of the\r\nmain axis (Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9; Pl. 124, figs. 6, 10). The posterior view\r\n(from the aboral pole) shows the two parapylæ, at right and left; in the\r\nanterior view (from the oral pole) the astropyle may be visible, but\r\nusually it is completely hidden in the dark voluminous phæodium. This\r\nlatter envelops sometimes nearly the whole capsule as an opaque\r\nconglomeration of green or brown phæodella (Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9); but\r\nusually the phæodium fills up the anterior (oral) half of the shell-cavity,\r\nwhilst the capsule occupies the posterior (aboral) half (Pl. 124, figs. 6,\r\n10).\r\n\r\nThe dorsal shell-valve is in almost all PHÆODARIA smaller or somewhat\r\ndifferent in shape from the ventral valve, and this difference is often\r\nvery striking (Pl. 124, figs. 3-16); but in a few species both valves are\r\nso similar, that I could not discover any certain difference. This equality\r\nof the two valves occurs mainly in those Concharida which pass over into\r\nthe Coelodendrida; in these latter as well as in the Coelographida, both\r\nvalves are usually equal in size and form. Whilst the main axis (or the\r\nlongitudinal axis of the body) in the two latter families of #Phæoconchia#\r\nseems to be normally vertical (in the living and freely floating body), in\r\nthe living Concharida it is probably horizontal, so that the larger and\r\nheavier ventral valve lies below the smaller and lighter dorsal valve.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical fundamental form of the body is therefore in the Concharida\r\ndipleural or bilaterally symmetrical, and we distinguish in it the same\r\nthree dimensive axes, as in all other dipleural forms. On the anterior or\r\noral pole of the main axis (or longitudinal axis) lies the mouth of the\r\nshell, and behind it the phæodium; on the opposite posterior or aboral pole\r\nlies the hinge of the shell (comparable to the shell-hinge of the\r\nBrachiopoda) and in front of it the central capsule. The sagittal (or\r\n{1713}dorso-ventral) axis, determining the height of the shell, has on its\r\ndorsal (or upper) pole the apex or highest point of the dorsal valve, on\r\nits ventral (or lower) pole the apex or lowest point of the ventral valve.\r\nThe two poles of the frontal (lateral or transverse) axis are equal and are\r\ndetermined by the two parapylæ of the capsule, and the corresponding points\r\nof the shell-fissure between both valves. Usually the main-axis is the\r\nlongest, the frontal axis the shortest, and between both the sagittal axis.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the three dimensive planes which are determined by these three\r\naxes, perpendicular to one another, they are rarely of nearly equal size\r\n(as in some subspherical species), usually the sagittal plane (separating\r\nthe right and left halves of the body) is the largest; the cinctural or\r\nequatorial plane (separating oral and aboral halves) is the smallest, and\r\nthe frontal or lateral plane (separating dorsal and ventral halves) is\r\nintermediate in size. The relation of the three perimeters of these three\r\nplanes corresponds to that proportion; the sagittal perimeter (in which the\r\nkeel of the compressed valves lies) is the largest; the cinctural or\r\nequatorial perimeter (separating the anterior phæodium and the posterior\r\ncentral capsule) is the smallest, and the frontal or lateral perimeter (in\r\nwhich the fissure between the valves lies) is intermediate in size.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the single valves is very varied in the different\r\nspecies, in the majority boat-shaped or hat-shaped, more or less laterally\r\ncompressed, in a few forms hemispherical. In _Conchopsis_ (Pl. 125) and\r\n_Conchoceras_ (Pl. 124, figs. 15, 16) the lateral parts of the valves\r\n(right and left) are vaulted, whilst their median parts are so strongly\r\ncompressed that they form a sharp sagittal keel, and then the shell in the\r\ndorsal or ventral view appears spindle-shaped (Pl. 123, fig. 8_a_; Pl. 125,\r\nfig. 8). Often the frontal margins of the valves are somewhat constricted\r\n(Pl. 124, fig. 7).\r\n\r\nThe junction between the two valves of the shell is always loose, but not\r\nso loose as in the two following families. In the Coelodendrida and\r\nCoelographida the two valves are either perfectly free and separated by a\r\nfrontal zone of jelly, or in very loose contact on the frontal margins. In\r\nthe Concharida, however, the margins of both valves seem to be usually in\r\ncontact, and their connection is effected in a double way. In the subfamily\r\nConchasmida (comprising the genera _Concharium_ and _Conchasma_, Pl. 123,\r\nfigs. 1-6) the lateral margins of both valves are smooth, not dentated, and\r\nfit one into another like the two parts of a box, or like the two valves of\r\na Diatom (_Navicula_). In the second subfamily, however, Conchopsida\r\n(comprising the five other genera, Pls. 124, 125), the lateral margins of\r\nthe valves are dentate, usually provided with a series of numerous strong\r\nconical teeth, and the teeth of both valves so catch into one another, that\r\ntheir union is rather firm (like the margin of the shells of _Tridacna_,\r\n_Pecten_, and other Lamellibranchiata). Besides, a more solid junction is\r\noften effected on the posterior or aboral part of the margins, which we\r\nshall call the hinge. Here often peculiar strong teeth catch one into\r\nanother, and in the majority of species {1714}two aboral spines are\r\ndeveloped, the caudal horns (a dorsal and a ventral); these are very large\r\nin _Conchoceras_ (Pl. 124, figs. 15, 16). But a peculiar and most\r\ninteresting kind of junction is effected in some Concharida by a true\r\nligament between the valves (Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9; Pl. 125, fig. 2). This\r\nligament is always placed on the aboral hinge, is of dark brown colour, and\r\nis not dissolved by mineral acids unless long applied. It may preserve the\r\nconnection of the posterior parts of both valves, when their anterior parts\r\nare removed one from another, just as in the Brachiopoda. I observed this\r\ninteresting ligament mainly in the genus _Conchopsis_, but not in all\r\nspecies, and it is not yet certain whether it is a constant organ in these\r\nand some other Concharida.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of Concharida the lateral margins of the two valves project\r\nslightly inwards into the cavity, and in some species of _Conchopsis_ these\r\ninner borders are so broadened that they form a broad, horizontal,\r\nfenestrated inner shelf, comparable to the deck of a boat or to the velum\r\nof the Hydromedusæ or Craspedotæ (Pl. 125, fig. 9). In this case the velum\r\nsurrounds the ovate aperture through which the two lobes of the central\r\ncapsule (dorsal and ventral) enter into the cavity of both valves.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the shell lies on the oral pole of the main axis, and is\r\ntherefore opposed to the aboral hinge. The two valves are here usually more\r\nor less emarginate, so as to form a transverse mouth with an upper and a\r\nlower lip (Pl. 124, figs. 6, 7, 11). The form of these two lips is often\r\nvery different and characteristic of particular species (Pl. 124, figs. 3,\r\n15, 16). The mouth remains in many species constantly open, even when the\r\nfrontal fissure is closed (figs. 7, 16). Since the centre of the shell\r\nmouth lies in the prolongation of the proboscis arising from the operculum\r\nof the central capsule, probably the main stream of sarcode, issuing from\r\nthe latter, becomes protruded by the former.\r\n\r\nApophyses of the shell (besides the teeth of the margins) are completely\r\nwanting in three genera, _Concharium_, _Conchellium_, and _Conchopsis_ (Pl.\r\n123, figs. 1-4, 7; Pl. 125). The four other genera possess free apophyses\r\nor spines, which we call horns. They are probably important as the\r\nbeginnings of those large hollow tubes which are characteristic of the two\r\nfollowing families, Coelodendrida and Coelographida. We distinguish two\r\ndifferent forms of horns, apical horns on the poles of the sagittal axis,\r\nand caudal horns on the aboral pole of the main axis; the former probably\r\ncorrespond to the sagittal tubes and the latter to the caudal tubes of the\r\ntwo following families. Apical horns are found in a single genus only,\r\n_Conchonia_ (Pl. 124, figs. 10-14). Here either on one pole or on poles of\r\nthe sagittal axis a horn is developed, usually curved backwards. Sometimes\r\nthe base of this conical horn is inflated and fenestrated, and may\r\nrepresent the beginning of the formation of the galea or apical cupola of\r\nthe Coelodendrida.\r\n\r\nThe two caudal horns are opposite on the aboral hinge of the shell, one\r\narising from the posterior end of each valve. Usually they are short and\r\nthick, pyramidal, the {1715}ventral horn larger than the dorsal (Pl. 124,\r\nfigs. 3, 6). Rarely the two caudal horns are fenestrated at the base and\r\nreach a considerable size, as in _Conchoceras_ (Pl. 124, figs. 15, 16).\r\n\r\nThe walls of the bivalved shell usually exhibit in the Concharida a rather\r\nsolid shape and regular structure, with an elegant network of regularly\r\narranged pores. But in some species the walls of the shell become very thin\r\nand fragile, and assume the same shape (with very irregular network), as in\r\nthe Coelodendrida and Coelographida. The pores are usually small and\r\nnumerous, circular, often hexagonally framed (Pl. 125, figs. 4-6). They\r\npierce the thick shell-wall either in a radial or in an oblique direction.\r\nSometimes each pore is armed with six radial teeth (Pl. 123, fig. 7_a_). At\r\nother times each pore represents an oblique ampullaceous canal, dilated in\r\nits middle part, with two narrow openings (Pl. 125, figs. 5_a_, _b_, _c_,\r\n6). The pores are so arranged in the majority of species that they form\r\nregular curved series, which are separated by prominent crests, and\r\nconverge towards the poles of the main axis. Usually the marginal pores\r\n(along the frontal margin of the valves) are much smaller (compare Pls.\r\n123-125).\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Concharida, very well preserved in numerous\r\nspecimens of the Challenger collection, constantly possesses the same\r\nsituation and structure. It is always enclosed in the aboral or posterior\r\nhalf of the shell-cavity, whilst the oral or anterior half is filled up by\r\nthe phæodium. The free spaces between both and between the inner surface of\r\nthe shell are completely filled up by the jelly of the calymma, which also\r\ncovers the whole shell as a thin outer jelly-envelope. The form of the\r\ncentral capsule is sometimes nearly spherical, usually somewhat compressed\r\nin the direction of the main axis, and sometimes also in the direction of\r\nthe frontal axis (Pl. 123, figs. 1-9). In some species it becomes bilobed,\r\nwith an upper dorsal and a lower ventral lobe, and in some others it\r\nbecomes triangular (Pl. 125, fig. 7). Its two membranes (inner and outer)\r\nare often separated by a broad colourless interval, containing a clear\r\nfluid or jelly (Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9). The nucleus is usually about half as\r\nlarge as the central capsule and ellipsoidal, its longer axis lying in the\r\nsagittal diameter of the body. Several specimens (of different genera)\r\ncontained two separate nuclei, one placed in the dorsal, the other in the\r\nventral half of the capsule (Pl. 124, fig. 6). This duplication of the\r\nnucleus is probably the preparation for the division of the capsule. The\r\ndivision will be probably effected in the frontal plane, so that each half\r\nof the bisected capsule gets one nucleus and one valve, and the other valve\r\nbecomes newly formed (in a way similar to that in the bivalved Diatomaceæ).\r\nThe astropyle, or the main-opening of the capsule, is closed by a radiate\r\noperculum, from which arises a tubular proboscis; this lies in the main\r\naxis of the body, is directed towards the anterior mouth of the shell, and\r\nsurrounded by the phæodium. The two shorter tubes of the paired parapylæ,\r\nor the accessory lateral openings, lie on the posterior or caudal side of\r\n{1716}the capsule, at right and left, and are directed half backwards, half\r\noutwards (towards the frontal fissure between the valves, Pl. 123, figs. 1,\r\n8_a_).\r\n\r\nThe phæodium exhibits in all Concharida the same characteristic shape, and\r\nrepresents a dark conglomeration of phæodellæ, filling up the anterior or\r\noral half of the shell-cavity. Usually it is bilobed, divided into a dorsal\r\nand a ventral lobe or wing, which fills up the corresponding valve of the\r\nshell (Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9). The phæodium is commonly more voluminous than\r\nthe capsule, and surrounds its anterior half, more rarely it encloses\r\nnearly the entire capsule (Pl. 124, figs. 6, 10). Its colour is usually\r\nolive, sometimes more greenish, at other times more brownish, in some\r\nspecies nearly black. The phæodellæ, or the roundish granules which compose\r\nthe phæodium, exhibit the same shape as in all other PHÆODARIA (compare\r\nabove, p. 1535). Sometimes peculiar rather oblong nucleated cells are\r\nscattered in great numbers between the phæodellæ, probably parasites or\r\nsymbiontes (Pl. 123, figs. 7-9, 9_a_).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Concharida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Jena, Dec. 12, p. 6.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Concharida# with the lateral margins of the valves smooth,\r\nwithout sagittal keel and without horns on the hinge.\r\n\r\n{1717}The genus _Concharium_ is the simplest and the most primitive form of\r\nall Concharida; it may be regarded as the common ancestral form of the\r\nwhole family. The entire shell is usually almost spherical, without horns\r\nor teeth, and may be regarded as a _Castanella_ which is bisected or broken\r\ninto two equal hemispherical halves. The lateral margins of the two\r\nhemispherical valves are smooth, without teeth, and catch one into the\r\nother like the two valves of a Diatom, or the two halves of a bivalved box.\r\n_Concharium_ agrees in this simple shape of the frontal margins with the\r\nfollowing genus _Conchasma_, and represents with it the small subfamily\r\nConchasmida.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Concharium bivalvum_, n. sp. (Pl. 123, figs. 2, 2_a_).\r\n\r\nShell spherical, smooth. Diameter in all directions nearly the same.\r\nBorders of the two hemispherical valves circular, smooth, about twice as\r\nbroad as the pores. In the half frontal perimeter of the shell (along the\r\nright and the left border of each valve) twenty-two to twenty-four pores,\r\nin the half sagittal perimeter (in the middle line of each valve) eighteen\r\nto twenty-two pores, in the half equator (in the cinctural perimeter of\r\neach valve) twenty to twenty-two pores. All pores circular, of the same\r\nsize, twice as broad as their bars.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell (longitudinal diameter) 0.35, height\r\n(sagittal diameter) 0.34, breadth (lateral diameter) 0.33.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--North Atlantic, west of Madeira, Station 354, depth 1675\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Concharium nucula_, n. sp. (Pl. 123, fig. 3).\r\n\r\nShell pear-shaped, with costate surface. Oral face somewhat truncated,\r\nbroader than the aboral face. Its longitudinal diameter about one-fifth\r\nlonger than the two other diameters. Borders of the two valves ovate,\r\nsmooth, about as broad as the pores. In the half frontal perimeter of the\r\nshell twenty-two to twenty-four pores, in the half sagittal perimeter\r\neighteen to twenty, in the half equator sixteen to eighteen. Pores\r\nirregularly roundish, three to four times as broad as the bars. The pores\r\nare so disposed in meridional rows that the crests between the rows\r\nconverge towards the two poles of the sagittal axis.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.2, height 0.18, breadth 0.16.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--South Atlantic (west of Tristan da Cunha), Station 332, depth\r\n2200 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Concharium diatomeum_, n. sp. (Pl. 123, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nShell nearly spherical, slightly lenticular, somewhat compressed in\r\ndorso-ventral direction; the sagittal diameter therefore somewhat shorter\r\nthan the two others. Borders of the two hemispherical valves nearly\r\ncircular, quite smooth, about as broad as the length of the largest pores.\r\nIn the half frontal perimeter of the shell forty-four to fifty pores; in\r\nthe half sagittal perimeter twenty to twenty-four; in the half equator\r\nthirty to thirty-three. Pores different in form and size; the\r\n{1718}marginal pores small, nearly circular; the dorsal and ventral pores\r\noblongish-hexagonal, twice as long as broad, about four to six times as\r\nlong as the bars, regularly arranged in transverse rows.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.22, height 0.21, breadth 0.2.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, near Sierra Leone, Station 348, depth 2450\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Concharium bacillarium_, n. sp. (Pl. 123, fig. 4).\r\n\r\nShell walnut-shaped, with panelled surface; oral and aboral face of the\r\nsame form. Its longitudinal diameter about one-fifth longer than the two\r\nother diameters. Borders of the two cup-shaped valves elliptical, smooth,\r\nwith a prominent edge, about as broad as the larger pores. In the half\r\nfrontal perimeter of the shell fifty to fifty-five pores, in the half\r\nsagittal perimeter thirty-six to forty, in the half equator also thirty to\r\nforty. Pores hexagonally framed. The pores are tapering in size from the\r\nsagittal plane towards the valve-margins, and so regularly arranged in\r\nmeridional rows that the crests between the latter converge towards both\r\npoles of the longitudinal axis.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.2, height 0.15, breadth 0.15.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, off St. Helena, Station 340, depth 1500\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Concharium fragilissimum_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell subspherical, very thin-walled and fragile. Diameter in all\r\ndirections nearly the same. Oral and aboral face scarcely different.\r\nMargins of the hemispherical valves extremely thin and hyaline.

These are probably\r\nof great morphological importance, since they represent the beginnings of\r\nthe hollow tubes arising from the poles of the sagittal axis in all\r\nCoelodendrida and Coelographida. In one of the three observed species each\r\nvalve possessed an apical or sagittal horn, whilst in the two other species\r\none valve only was provided with a horn.

Aboral hinge with two equal,\r\nconical, caudal horns, which are straight, parallel, and half as long as\r\nthe shell. Two similar straight conical horns are opposed on the poles of\r\nthe sagittal axis, and arise from the apex of the two valves. This\r\nremarkable species may perhaps better represent a separate genus,\r\n_Conchura_, forming a direct transition to the ancestral form of the\r\nCoelodendrida, _Coelodoras_; it differs from the latter in the absence of a\r\ngalea or hollow conical cupola on the apex of each valve, and in the solid,\r\nnot hollow structure of the horns.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.24, length of the two sagittal horns\r\n0.1, of the two caudal horns 0.12.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Cocos Islands (Rabbe), surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 725. _Conchopsis_,[341] Haeckel, 1879, Sitzungsb. med.-nat.\r\nGesellsch.

Radiol., p. 360.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a bivalved lattice-shell, composed of two\r\nhemispherical valves, a dorsal and a ventral. A conical cupola or a\r\npyramidal galea arises from the apical pole of both valves, therefore at\r\nthe opposite poles of the sagittal axis. Rhinocanna and frenula wanting.\r\nThree or more hollow radial tubes arise from each valve and are\r\nsymmetrically disposed. Sometimes their branches form an outer\r\n{1729}bivalved mantle. The central capsule is so enclosed between the two\r\ninner valves, that its three openings lie in the open frontal fissure\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThe family #Coelodendrida# differs from the preceding Concharida (its\r\nprobable ancestral group) in the development of a conical galea or\r\npyramidal cupola on the apical pole of each valve, and of three or more\r\nhollow radial tubes arising from each galea. They do not possess, however,\r\nthe peculiar sagittal nasal tube or rhinocanna, which is constantly\r\ndeveloped from the base of each cupola (and connected with its apex by a\r\nfrenulum) in the following family, the Coelographida. These latter differ\r\nalso from the former in the constant possession of prominent verticillate\r\nstyles.\r\n\r\nThe family Coelodendrida was founded in 1862 in my Monograph (p. 360) and\r\nrepresented hitherto only by two species of the genus _Coelodendrum_, there\r\ndescribed (p. 361, Taf. xiii. figs. 1-3, and Taf. xxxii. fig. 1). This\r\nfirst description, however, contained some errors, which were afterwards\r\n(in 1879) corrected by Richard Hertwig; this author also gave the first\r\naccurate description of the central capsule and its three openings. In the\r\nrich collection of the Challenger, the Coelodendrida are represented by\r\nfour genera, but only seventeen species, some of which, however, are\r\ncosmopolitan and very common, particularly _Coelodendrum_.\r\n\r\nThe two valves of the lattice-shell, dorsal and ventral, are either\r\nhemispherical, or somewhat more flatly vaulted or cap-shaped. They are\r\nnever connected in the equatorial zone of the body, as I supposed in my\r\nMonograph (1862, _loc. cit._); but they are separated by the\r\ngirdle-fissure, a free circular equatorial interval, in which lie the three\r\nopenings of the enclosed central capsule. Though the two valves, therefore,\r\nhave no direct connection, they are, however, always opposed so accurately,\r\nthat their equal free circular edges correspond exactly one to the other,\r\nso that the apex of each valve lies in one pole of the sagittal axis. From\r\nthis apex there arises on each valve an irregular conical or three-sided\r\npyramidal cupola, the galea (Pl. 121, figs. 3, 4, 8). The Coelodendrida\r\ndiffer in the possession of this galea from the Concharida, and agree with\r\nthe Coelographida; but they never exhibit the peculiar rhinocanna or nasal\r\ntube, which arises from each galea in the latter family.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous lattice-plate of the two valves, and of the galea arising\r\nfrom them, is very thin and fragile, and its irregular roundish pores are\r\nextremely variable in size, number, and disposition. Sometimes the pores\r\nare so small and so scarce, that the plate appears nearly solid. At other\r\ntimes the siliceous plate seems to be really solid, and covered by a\r\nnetwork of thin crests, the small dimples between which give to it the\r\nappearance of being fenestrated. Often the pores or the dimples are wanting\r\nin the central part of each valve, while they are very numerous and dense\r\nin the peripheral part. The same may be said of the lattice-plate of the\r\ngalea, which is sometimes nearly solid, at other times richly fenestrated.\r\nThe Coelodendrida agree in this structure with the following {1730}family,\r\nthe Coelographida, and differ from the preceding family, the Concharida, in\r\nwhich the siliceous wall of the two valves is much thicker, and perforated\r\nby regular circular or roundish pores.\r\n\r\nThe galea or conical cupola in the apex of the two valves (\"der\r\nkegelförmige Aufsatz\" of the German authors) has in all Coelodendrida a\r\ntriangular base and an irregularly conical or nearly three-sided pyramidal\r\nform. Its cavity is about one-third or one-fourth as large in diameter as\r\nthe cavity of the hemispherical valve upon which it rests. The galea is\r\nrelatively smaller and more irregularly formed than in the Coelographida,\r\nand differs essentially from that of the latter in the constant absence of\r\na rhinocanna; there are also wanting, therefore, the characteristic\r\nfrenula, which connect the nasal tube with the apex of the galea. The\r\ncavity of the galea probably always communicates with that of the valves by\r\npores in the separating siliceous plate, and is besides pierced by\r\nirregular pores in its outer wall, very variable in form, size, and number,\r\nbut it does not communicate with the cavity of the hollow radial tubes,\r\nfrom which it is separated by a thin, solid, siliceous plate.\r\n\r\nThe hollow radial tubes which arise from the galea in the Coelodendrida do\r\nnot seem to possess that constant regularity in number, origin, and\r\ndisposition, which is found in the following family, and there serves for\r\ndistinction of genera. In my first description of the Coelodendrida (1862,\r\n_loc. cit._, p. 362), I pointed out this irregularity, and mentioned that\r\nthe number of radial tubes arising from each galea varies from three to\r\neight; the total number therefore amounts to from six to sixteen, the same\r\nminimum and maximum numbers which we shall encounter also in the radial\r\nstyles of the following family. But whilst it is easy to determine the\r\nposition and relation of these hollow tubes in the Coelographida, owing to\r\nthe constant sagittal position of their rhinocanna, this task is very\r\ndifficult in the Coelodendrida, where the rhinocanna is wanting. In the\r\nmost frequent cases there arise from each galea three or four tubes, more\r\nrarely five or six, and very rarely seven or eight. The simplest and\r\nprobably the original case is the development of three tubes, two of which\r\nare paired (divergent on the right and left), while the third is odd, lying\r\nin the sagittal plane. Perhaps these three primary tubes may be compared to\r\nthe three cortinar feet of the NASSELLARIA, so that we may regard the two\r\npaired anterior as pectoral, and the odd posterior as a caudal tube.\r\nUsually the two paired or pectoral tubes arise from two corners of the\r\ntriangular base of the galea, whilst the third odd or caudal tube does not\r\narise from the third corner of the base, but more or less above it, and\r\noften even from the highest point or the apex of the galea. In the majority\r\nof species observed, this odd sagittal tube is forked even at its origin,\r\nso that two divergent tubes (an anterior and a posterior) arise from the\r\napex of the galea (Pl. 121, figs. 3, 8). More rarely the two paired or\r\npectoral tubes are also forked at the base, so that three pairs of tubes\r\narise from each galea, and the total number of tubes amounts to twelve.\r\nVery rarely {1731}four separate tubes or four pairs of tubes arise from\r\neach galea, viz., two from the two anterior corners of the basal triangle,\r\none from the posterior corner, and one from the apex of the galea. It is\r\npossible that this difference in the origin, furcation, and number of the\r\nhollow radial tubes may be employed for the distinction of genera of\r\nCoelodendrida, in the same manner as it is employed in the next following\r\nfamily, the Coelographida. But I have not been able, in spite of numerous\r\nand accurate examinations, to demonstrate in the former the same regularity\r\nin number and arrangement of the tubes as in the latter. It seems that\r\nthese relations here are very variable, even in one and the same Species,\r\nand not yet fixed.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, probable, on the other hand, that the primary tubes (all or\r\npartly) are identical to the Coelodendrida and Coelographida. This is most\r\nprobably the case with the posterior odd or caudal tube, which seems to be\r\nnever wanting, and in both families is developed in the form of a\r\ndichotomous brush (never in the form of a verticillate style). Possibly\r\nalso the two paired pectoral tubes are homologous in both families.\r\n\r\nThe hollow tubes are perfectly simple and unbranched only in one genus,\r\n_Coelodoras_, which is probably the common ancestral form of both families,\r\nand which may have been derived from _Concharium_ by development of a galea\r\nand tubes on the sagittal apex of the valves. All the other Coelodendrida\r\nhave branched spines, and the ramification is constantly dichotomous, or\r\nrepeatedly forked. There never occur in this family those characteristic\r\n\"styles,\" or verticillate prolonged tubes, which we find in all\r\nCoelographida. Usually the cylindrical tubes are slightly curved and forked\r\neven near their base. The furcation is repeated a variable number of times\r\nin the different species. In the largest species each tube becomes a brush\r\nwith more than one hundred terminal bristles.\r\n\r\nWe divide the Coelodendrida into two subfamilies, according to the\r\ndifferent development of the distal branches of the hollow tubes. In the\r\nCoelodorida all the branches of the tubes remain free and are never\r\nconnected by anastomoses, so that the surface of the bivalved skeleton is\r\nprotected by the free radial distal branches of the tubes. In the larger\r\nspecies of _Coelodendrum_ (_e.g._, _Coelodendrum furcatissimum_, Pl. 121,\r\nfig. 1), the numerous branches of the dichotomous tubes form a dense\r\nthicket, similar to that in the Coelotholida.\r\n\r\nIn the second subfamily, Coelodrymida, the distal branches of the tubes are\r\nconnected by numerous anastomoses, and compose either a simple\r\nlattice-plate on the surface of the skeleton (_Coelodrymus_), or a thicker\r\nenvelope of spongy framework (_Coelodasea_). The lattice-mantle so produced\r\nis always bivalved, and its two outer hemispherical valves (dorsal and\r\nventral) correspond exactly to the two inner valves, from which arise the\r\nhollow tubes. The free margins of the two external mantle-valves come\r\nexternally into contact in the equatorial plane of the body, in which the\r\ngirdle-fissure lies internally between the two central shell-valves. The\r\nfree edges {1732}of the two external mantle-valves, opposed to one another\r\nin the circle of the equator, seem usually to catch one into another in the\r\nsame way as the corresponding mantle-valves of the Coeloplegmida are\r\nloosely connected (Pl. 128, figs. 1, 7). A true concrescence between the\r\ntwo valves seems never to take place.\r\n\r\nThe two subfamilies of Coelodendrida therefore exactly correspond to the\r\ntwo subfamilies of the following family, the Coelographida. The Coelodorida\r\nand Coelotholida form in a similar way a thicket, by dichotomous\r\nramification of the hollow tubes, all the branches of which remain free.\r\nThe Coelodrymida and Coeloplegmida, on the other hand, form an outer\r\nlattice-mantle by anastomosing branches. The latter two subfamilies, of\r\ncourse, have been derived correspondingly from the two former, and the\r\ncommon ancestral form of all four is probably _Coelodoras_, derived from\r\nthe Concharida.\r\n\r\nThough the two corresponding subfamilies in both groups are very similar,\r\nthey are, however, separated by important hereditary characters. All\r\nCoelodendrida (the Coelodorida without a mantle as well as the Coelodrymida\r\nwith a mantle) possess no rhinocanna and no frenula on the galea, and they\r\nnever develop prominent verticillate styles; the surface of their calymma\r\nis probably always spherical or subspherical. All Coelographida, however\r\n(the Coelotholida without a mantle as well as the Coeloplegmida with a\r\nmantle), possess a rhinocanna and frenula on the galea, and always develop\r\nprominent verticillate styles; the surface of their calymma is probably\r\nalways symmetrically polyhedral.\r\n\r\nThe superficial armature of the skeleton in the Coelodendrida is rather\r\nsimple, and by no means so manifold and differentiated as in the more\r\nhighly developed Coelographida. The thin terminal branches of the hollow\r\ntubes are in the Coelodorida closed at the distal end, and armed with a\r\nvariable number of short teeth (Pl. 121, fig. 2), or with a spinulate\r\nterminal knob, or a corona of recurved hooks (_ibid._, figs. 5-7). In the\r\nCoelodrymida, however, where the distal ends of the branches by\r\nanastomosing form the lattice-mantle, the spherical surface of this latter\r\nis armed with numerous thin spathillæ or radial bristles (often zig-zag or\r\nspinulate), and each bristle usually bears at the distal end a small anchor\r\nwith two, three, or four recurved teeth; the outer convex edge of these\r\nteeth is usually smooth, the inner concave edge denticulate. All these\r\nramules and branches of the tubes (also the thinnest terminal threads) are\r\nhollow, and filled up by jelly.\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Coelodendrida does not lie outside the two\r\ncentral valves (as I supposed in my first description, in 1862, being\r\ndeceived by the dark enveloping phæodium, Monogr. d. Radiol., Taf. xxxii.\r\nfig. 1), but it is enclosed between the two valves, as in the preceding and\r\nthe following family. The first accurate description of it was given by\r\nRichard Hertwig in 1879 (_loc. cit._, p. 95, Taf. x. fig. 3). Its constant\r\nposition between the two lattice-valves (dorsal and ventral) is such, that\r\nits three openings lie in the frontal plane, in the open fissure between\r\nthe valves. The astropyle or the main-opening, with the radiate operculum\r\nand the tubular proboscis arising from it, lies on the anterior (or oral)\r\n{1733}pole of the main axis, whilst the two lateral accessory openings, or\r\nparapylæ, lie on both sides of the posterior (or aboral) pole, to the right\r\nand left. The position of the capsule is therefore the same as in the\r\npreceding Concharida (Pls. 123-125), and the following Coelographida (Pls.\r\n126-128). The large nucleus, enclosed in the central capsule, is usually\r\nhalf as broad, and contains numerous nucleoli.\r\n\r\nThe calymma, or the extracapsular jelly-veil, is in the Coelodendrida\r\nusually spherical, very voluminous, and includes the entire skeleton, the\r\nthicket of the Coelodorida as well as the lattice-mantle of the\r\nCoelodrymida. Only the outermost terminal branches of the tubes in the\r\nformer, and the radial bristles and spathillæ on the surface of the latter,\r\nremain free and project beyond the surface of the calymma. The phæodium is\r\nusually very large, three to four times as broad as the central capsule,\r\nand envelops it often completely. Usually it envelops only the anterior\r\nhalf of it, and the proboscis (Pl. 121, figs. 1, 9). Often numerous green,\r\nbrown, or blackish phæodellæ are scattered through the whole calymma, and\r\nsometimes accumulate in a superficial layer on its surface. The galea of\r\nboth valves is usually also filled up by the phæodium.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Coelodendrida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

(Pls. 122, 126-128).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--PHÆODARIA with a bivalved lattice-shell, composed of two\r\nhemispherical valves, a dorsal and a ventral. A conical cupola or a\r\nhelmet-shaped galea arises on the apical pole of each valve, therefore on\r\nthe opposite poles of the sagittal axis. The cavity of the galea\r\ncommunicates with the sagittal rhinocanna, a peculiar nasal tube, which\r\nrests upon the valve, and is connected with the galea by a simple or double\r\nfrenulum; its opening being directed towards the proboscis. Three or more\r\nbranched hollow radial tubes arise from each valve, and are symmetrically\r\ndisposed. Sometimes their branches form an outer bivalved mantle. The\r\ncentral capsule is so enclosed between the two inner valves, that its three\r\nopenings lie in the open frontal fissure between them.\r\n\r\nThe family #Coelographida#, the last family of the PHÆODARIA, exhibits the\r\nhighest degree of morphological development, not only in this group, but\r\namong all Radiolaria. They attain also the greatest size of all members of\r\nthe class, since the diameter of their body is sometimes more than 20 mm.,\r\nand in a few species even more than 30 mm. The complexity of their\r\nstructure attains at the same time such a high degree, that they may be\r\nregarded as the most complicated, and (in a morphological sense) as the\r\nmost highly developed of all Protozoa. Nevertheless their body always\r\nremains a single cell, {1740}and is closely allied to the preceding\r\nCoelodendrida; they differ from the latter mainly in the development of a\r\npeculiar new organ, the \"rhinocanna,\" or \"nasal tube.\" This is a hollow\r\ntube placed in the sagittal plane, arising from the base of each galea, and\r\nis connected with its apex by a simple or double frenulum. Between the oral\r\nopenings of the two opposed rhinocannæ (one dorsal and one ventral) lies\r\nthe proboscis of the central capsule.\r\n\r\nThe first observed species of Coelographida was _Coelographis gracillima_,\r\nsome parts of which (but not the entire skeleton) were figured in my\r\nMonograph (1862, Taf. xxxii. figs. 2, 3). But I confounded these with\r\n_Coelodendrum gracillimum_, in the branched hollow trees of which the\r\nfragments of the former were entangled. I detected this error afterwards,\r\nwhen I had the opportunity of the observing some complete specimens. The\r\nfirst description of a complete skeleton was given in 1882 by O. Bütschli,\r\nwho examined a large specimen of _Coelothamnus davidoffii_, captured by\r\nDavidoff in the Mediterranean (Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool., Bd. xxxvi. p. 486,\r\nTaf. xxxi.). In the rich collection of the Challenger I was able to\r\ndistinguish not less than nine genera and twenty-six species of\r\nCoelographida, but the majority of their large and most fragile skeletons\r\nwere more or less injured, or quite broken. It was, therefore, of the\r\nhighest importance for the minute study of this difficult group, that Dr.\r\nJohn Murray, during his expedition to the Færöe Channel (in 1882, in H.M.S.\r\n\"Triton\"), discovered in the Gulf Stream the beautiful _Coeloplegma\r\nmurrayanum_, and brought up home hundreds of well-preserved specimens (Pl.\r\n127). Only by the complete examination of this excellent material it was\r\npossible to answer many difficult questions as to their morphology, and to\r\ncorrect the errors in my description and in that of Bütschli.\r\n\r\nWe divide the family Coelographida into two rather different subfamilies,\r\nwhich may afterwards be separated as two divergent families, the\r\nCoelotholida (Pl. 122) and Coeloplegmida (Pls. 126-128). Both groups may be\r\neasily distinguished at a glance, since the numerous branches, arising from\r\nthe hollow radial tubes, remain constantly free and independent in the\r\nformer, and represent a spiny thicket, whilst in the latter they constantly\r\nbecome united, and by anastomosing form a peculiar \"mantle,\" or outer\r\nenvelope of delicate network. But besides, there are other and more\r\nimportant differences between the two groups.  The peculiar hollow tube,\r\narising from the base of the galea on each valve, which is filled with\r\nphæodella, and which we call the rhinocanna, develops in the Coelotholida\r\non its open mouth two paired lateral frenula (right and left), which\r\nconnect it (like two lateral bridges) with the base of two paired hollow\r\nmain tubes (the \"frontal tubes\"). In the Coelospathida, however, the mouth\r\nof the rhinocanna develops a single odd frenulum only (in the sagittal\r\nplane), and is connected by it with the base of an odd, single, hollow main\r\ntube, directed forwards, the \"nasal style.\"\r\n\r\nThe central bivalve lattice-shell, from which the galea and the tubes\r\narise, exhibits in {1741}the Coelographida essentially the same form and\r\nstructure as in the preceding Coelodendrida. The only (but important)\r\ndifference between them is indicated by the constant presence of the\r\npeculiar rhinocanna in the former, whilst this is always absent in the\r\nlatter. The two valves of the shell, dorsal and ventral, are either\r\nhemispherical or somewhat flatter, sometimes nearly cap-shaped, and formed\r\nof an extremely delicate and irregularly fenestrated plate of silica, as in\r\nthe Coelodendrida. As in the latter, so also in the Coelographida both\r\nvalves are of similar form and usually of equal size, but sometimes the\r\ndorsal is a little smaller than the ventral valve. The remarkable\r\ndifference which Bütschli describes in his _Coelothamnus davidoffii_, and\r\nthe inverse origin of the three tubes in both valves (_loc. cit._, Taf.\r\nxxxi; figs. 2, 4), depends upon an error of observation, produced by the\r\nartificial inversion of one valve, and the dislocation of their natural\r\narrangement. The valves are never in direct contact, but separated by the\r\nequatorial fissure or girdle-cleft, in which the girdle zone of the\r\nenclosed central capsule and its three openings lie freely (Pl. 127, figs.\r\n4, 5; Pl. 128, fig. 2). The free margins of both valves, which are opposite\r\nto one another, and bound the girdle-cleft, are always equidistant, so that\r\nthe cleft in the whole equatorial circumference is of equal breadth. The\r\nmargins are usually irregularly denticulate, sometimes armed with longer\r\nbristles (Pl. 127, fig. 8), more rarely smooth (fig. 5). The delicate\r\nlattice-work of the valves is always irregular and very variable, usually\r\nwith numerous small and unequal pores, sometimes rudimentary, so that the\r\nvalves appear partly solid and hyaline. The size of the valves is usually\r\nbetween 0.2 and 0.5 (in diameter).\r\n\r\nThe galea (_g_) or the apical cupola, which arises from the vaulted apex of\r\neach valve (or its sagittal pole) is more developed in the Coelographida\r\nthan in the preceding Coelodendrida, and differs from the latter in the\r\npeculiar rhinocanna arising from its base, and in the single or double\r\nfrenulum, connecting the open mouth of the rhinocanna with the odd or\r\npaired main tube arising from the galea. The two opposite galeæ lie\r\ntherefore on the poles of the sagittal axis of the bivalve shell, and are\r\nso symmetrically disposed in the sagittal plane, that the open mouths of\r\ntheir rhinocannæ are directed towards the oral pole of the main axis, and\r\nnearly come in contact with the proboscis arising from the radiate\r\noperculum of the central capsule (Pl. 127, figs. 4, 5).\r\n\r\nThe size and form of the galea are very variable, even in one and the same\r\nspecies. The volume of its cavity is generally about as great as that of\r\nthe hemispherical valve from which it arises, sometimes larger, at other\r\ntimes smaller. Its fundamental form is constantly dipleuric or bilateral,\r\nsince the radial hollow tubes arise symmetrically on both its sides, and\r\nthe rhinocanna proceeding from its base determines the sagittal plane.\r\nUsually the galea has the form of a vaulted helmet, the convex crest of\r\nwhich is inclined towards the mouth (Pl. 127, figs. 4, 5, 8, 9). Its\r\nanterior or apical part is broad and truncated in the Coelotholida, more or\r\nless conical in the Coelospathida; sometimes it assumes nearly the form of\r\na bilateral three-sided pyramid, at other times it is more\r\n{1742}pear-shaped (Pls. 126-128). The thin siliceous wall of the galea has\r\nthe same irregular and delicate network as the valve from which it arises,\r\nand sometimes the small irregular pores are also here reduced, so that the\r\nwall becomes partly solid. In some cases the thin, solid, siliceous plate\r\nof the galea and of the valve is covered by an irregular delicate network\r\nof crests; the dimples between these crests may be easily confounded with\r\ntrue pores.\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the galea is filled with phæodella and does not communicate\r\nwith the cavity of the shell-valves, nor with the cavity of the radial\r\ntubes filled by jelly; it is closed towards the latter and the former by a\r\nthin solid plate of silex. Bütschli (1882, _loc. cit._, p. 488) describes\r\nin _Coelothamnus_ a large circular opening (Taf. xxxi. figs. 2_a_, 4_a_),\r\nand states that this is a direct communication between the cavities of the\r\nvalves and of their galeas which are called by him \"der dreiseitige\r\nkastenförmige Aufsatz\" ([epsilon]). This error was caused by the fact that\r\nhe observed the valves from the apical face only. The apparent opening of\r\ncommunication does not exist, and is the optical section of the rhinocanna,\r\nthe shortened walls of which he describes as \"trapezförmige Kiesellamelle\"\r\n([gamma]); the two lateral edges of the latter (\"die seitlichen Zipfel,\"\r\n[delta]) are the paired frenula, which connect the open mouth of the\r\nrhinocanna with the base of the two frontal tubes.\r\n\r\nThe \"rhinocanna or nasal tube\" (Pl. 126, figs. 1, 4; Pl. 127, figs. 4-9_t_)\r\nis a very remarkable organ which is common to all Coelographida (without\r\nany exception), and distinguishes them markedly from all the other\r\nRadiolaria, and particularly from the closely allied Coelodendrida in which\r\nwe find no trace of it. The rhinocanna is a cylindrical or three-sided\r\nprismatic hollow tube, which lies in the sagittal plane, on the outer\r\nsurface of each valve, arises from the base of the galea, and is directed\r\ntowards the proboscis of the central capsule. The two opposite rhinocannæ\r\nopen on each side of the latter (Pl. 127, figs. 4-9_m_), and usually this\r\n\"nasal mouth\" or the anterior opening of the nose is somewhat dilated or\r\neven funnel-shaped. The posterior opening of the nose passes directly over\r\ninto the base of the cavity of the galea.\r\n\r\nUsually the rhinocanna is densely filled up by dark phæodella, which enter\r\nby this channel into the cavity of the galea (Pl. 127, figs. 4, 5, 9).\r\nSometimes the entire phæodium is enclosed in the two galeæ and their\r\nrhinocannæ (figs. 5, 9), whilst at other times a great part of the phæodium\r\nlies outside of their cavities, and surrounds the proboscis of the mouth,\r\nor even the anterior half of the central capsule (fig. 4). The length of\r\nthe cylindrical rhinocanna is usually about equal to that of the galea,\r\nwhilst the diameter of the latter is from three to five times as great as\r\nthat of the former. The structure of the thin wall is the same in both. The\r\nfine reticulation (fig. 8) is produced either by true, very small and\r\nirregular pores, or by a fine network placed on the solid thin wall. We may\r\ndistinguish on each rhinocanna an outer or distal convex face, which is\r\nopposite to the proximal concave face of the galea, and an inner concave or\r\nproximal face, which rests immediately upon the convex outer face of the\r\nshell-valve; a thin solid lamella of {1743}silica here completely separates\r\nthe cavities of the valve and of the rhinocanna resting upon it.\r\n\r\nThe \"frenula or nasal suspensoria\" (Pl. 127, figs. 4-9_b_) are thin\r\nligaments of silica, which connect the nasal mouth (_m_) with the base of\r\nthe main tubes arising from the galea; they are, therefore, also common to\r\nall Coelographida, and an exclusive and marked attribute of this family.\r\nThey are, however, different in the two subfamilies of this group,\r\ncorresponding to the different origin of the odd or paired main tubes. In\r\nthe Coeloplegmida (Pls. 126-128) from the apex of each galea arises an odd\r\nmain style, the nasal style (_g_ 1), and its base is connected with the\r\nnasal mouth by an odd frenulum (_b_). In the Coelotholida however (Pl. 122)\r\nthe large nasal odd style is always wanting, and there arise two paired\r\nfrontal tubes from the two corners of the truncate frontal face of the\r\ngalea; therefore two paired frenula are developed (a right and a left), and\r\nthese, converging towards the nasal mouth, connect its distal corner with\r\nthe base of the two frontal tubes.\r\n\r\nThe odd frenulum of each valve of the Coeloplegmida lies therefore in the\r\nsagittal plane, whilst the two paired frenula of the Coelotholida lie on\r\nboth sides of it, to the right and left. The frenula seem to be supporting\r\ncolumellæ or pillars, which support the fragile skeleton, and mainly effect\r\na fixed prop for the fragile galea. In the Coelotholida the frenula are\r\noften rather broad and irregularly fenestrated lamellæ of silica (Pl. 122,\r\nfig. 2), whilst in the Coeloplegmida they are usually thin ligaments,\r\nfenestrated only at the broadened ends, which are inserted inside on the\r\ndistal apex of the nasal mouth, and outside on the base of the nasal main\r\nstyles.\r\n\r\nThe large hollow tubes which arise from the galea of all Coelographida, are\r\nvery variable in number, size and shape, but are always richly branched and\r\nsymmetrically arranged in the dorsal and the ventral valve of the shell.\r\nThey exhibit an important difference in the two subfamilies of the group;\r\nin the Coelotholida all the branches, and also the thin terminal ramules,\r\nare free, without any junction; in the Coeloplegmida, however, they\r\ncommunicate by frequent anastomoses, and the connected terminal ramules\r\nform on the surface of the calymma an outer lattice-mantle of very delicate\r\nnetwork. Another marked difference between the two families is indicated by\r\nthe origin and site of those main tubes which are connected with the\r\nrhinocanna by a frenulum. In the Coeloplegmida an odd, very large main tube\r\n(the nasal style) arises from the anterior apex of each galea and bears on\r\nits base an odd frenulum. This nasal style and its frenulum is altogether\r\nwanting in the Coelotholida, where two paired main tubes (the frontal\r\ntubes) arise from the lateral corners of the truncate anterior side of the\r\ngalea, and are connected with the mouth of the rhinocanna by two paired\r\nconvergent lateral frenula.\r\n\r\nWe distinguish in all Coelographida two different forms of hollow branched\r\ntubes, which we will call \"brushes\" and \"styles.\" The brushes are\r\ndichotomously branched from the base, not verticillate; their distal\r\nramules remain separate in the Coelotholida {1744}and compose the spiny\r\nsurface, of the peculiar \"fork-thicket\" whilst in the Coelographida they\r\nbecome connected by frequent anastomoses and form the outer\r\n\"lattice-mantle.\" The styles however are much longer projecting over the\r\nsurface of the thicket or the mantle, and are not dichotomously branched,\r\nbut verticillate, or armed with cruciate or alternately cruciate pairs of\r\nbranches; the larger branches of the styles may be again dichotomously\r\nbranched like the brushes; whilst the free prominent parts of the styles\r\nare always verticillate or cruciate-pinnate. The brushes are identical with\r\nthe hollow tubes of the Coelodendrida, whilst the styles are peculiar forms\r\nof apophyses, wanting in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe minimum number of hollow tubes which arise from each valve is three,\r\nand these are probably homologous with the three primary tubes of the\r\nCoelodendrida. Two of these are paired (right and left), whilst the third\r\nis odd and lies in the sagittal plane; they have the same position as in\r\nthe tripodal NASSELLARIA, and may therefore bear the same names, the two\r\npaired anterior or pectoral tubes being divergent forwards, the odd or\r\ncaudal tube being bisected backwards (so in the Coelotholida, Pl. 121). The\r\nodd caudal tube (probably identical with the odd tube of the Coelodendrida)\r\nis always a brush, dichotomously branched, and never prolonged into free\r\nstyle. The two paired frontal or pectoral tubes, however are usually\r\nprolonged into two long verticillate styles. The basal origin also of these\r\nthree primary tubes is different. The two pectoral or anterior paired tubes\r\nalways arise from the galea itself whilst the posterior odd or caudal tube\r\nusually arises behind the galea from the valve (Pl. 127, figs. 4-8, _g_ 6).\r\n\r\nSince these three primary tubes the odd caudal and the paired pectoral, are\r\nprobably homologous in all Coelographida and Coelodendrida, they have a\r\ngreat morphological importance, similar to the three primary feet of the\r\nNASSELLARIA. All other tubes arising from the valves must be regarded as\r\nsecondary apophyses, since they are not constant in all members of the two\r\nfamilies, but present only in some of them. All the Coelotholida observed\r\n(a small number of species only) possess no secondary tubes, but only the\r\nthree primary; whilst all Coeloplegmida possess one or more secondary\r\ntubes, and one of these is constant, viz., the odd nasal style, directed\r\ntowards the mouth, and arising as the foremost from the apex of the galea\r\n(Pl. 127, figs. 4-8, _g_ 1).\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of tubes observed, which arise from each valve in the\r\nCoeloplegmida, is eleven; five of these are odd and placed in the sagittal\r\nplane of the body, viz.:--(A) the primary caudal tube (Pl. 127, figs. 4-8,\r\n_g_ 6); (B) an odd procaudal tube, arising between the caudal and the\r\nsagittal tube; (C) the sagittal tube, placed either in the sagittal axis of\r\nthe body or near it (often prolonged into a sagittal style, Pl. 128, fig.\r\n1); (D) an odd postnasal tube, arising between the sagittal and the nasal\r\ntube; (E) the odd nasal tube, constant in all Coeloplegmida, and connected\r\nat its base by the odd frenulum with the rhinocanna (Pl. 127, figs. 4-8,\r\n_g_ 1). All other tubes occurring in the Coeloplegmida are paired, and\r\nsymmetrically arranged on both sides of the sagittal {1745}plane, at right\r\nand left; their maximum number is three pairs, viz.:--(F) the paired\r\npectoral tubes (as the foremost), directed forwards; (G) the paired frontal\r\nor lateral tubes, placed either in the frontal axis of the valve, or in a\r\nneighbouring axis, directed towards the right and left pole (Pl. 127, figs.\r\n4-8, _g_ 4  and _g_ 5); (H) the paired tergal tubes, directed backwards\r\n(constant in all Coeloplegmida). The origin of these tubes is rather\r\nvariable, since they arise in nearly allied species, sometimes\r\nindependently of one another, at other times united at the base. But a\r\ncloser comparison of them in the different species will demonstrate their\r\nhomology, caused by constant heredity.\r\n\r\nThe terminal ramules of the brushes, which form the subspherical\r\n\"fork-thicket\" in the Coelotholida, the outer \"lattice-mantle\" in the\r\nCoeloplegmida, are constantly armed at the distal ends either with\r\nspathillæ or with anchor-pencils, bunches of those most elegant spinulate\r\nthreads, which bear at the free end an anchor, or a whorl of two, three, or\r\nfour recurved teeth (Pl. 122, fig. 8; Pl. 127, fig. 10; Pl. 128, figs. 1,\r\n6). The pencils are usually dichotomously branched, their threads zig-zag\r\nor delicately serrate, often armed with very small recurved denticles, and\r\nthe anchor teeth (commonly three or four) are usually smooth on the convex\r\nouter, serrate on the concave inner edge. The entire surface of the\r\nsubspherical thicket in the Coelotholida, and of the polyhedral\r\nlattice-mantle in the Coeloplegmida, is armed with thousands of those most\r\nelegant spathillæ, or anchor-pencils.\r\n\r\nThe \"fork-thicket\" of the Coelotholida is identical with that of the\r\nCoelodendrida, and is composed only of the innumerable dichotomous branches\r\nof the hollow tubes. It envelops the two central valves and the enclosed\r\ncentral capsule in the same way as in the Coelodendrida. But the\r\nCoelotholida differ from these latter in constantly possessing a rhinocanna\r\nand two frenulæ. The entire form of this thicket, which in the few species\r\nobserved was never complete, but always more or less destroyed, is usually\r\nprobably subspherical or polyhedral, sometimes cordate or kidney-shaped.\r\nIts surface is densely studded with thousands of spathillæ. Its diameter is\r\nabout four to eight times as great as that of the enclosed bivalve shell.\r\n\r\nThe \"lattice-mantle\" of the Coeloplegmida, which replaces in this subfamily\r\nthe fork-thicket of the Coelotholida, is always produced by the anastomoses\r\nof the distal ramules of the brushes, and of those branches of the styles\r\nwhich do not proceed over the surface of the mantle. Its network is always\r\nvery irregular, and composed of polygonal meshes of very different sizes.\r\nUsually it is quite simple, and may be compared with the cortical shell of\r\nthe Disphærida. More rarely it is more or less spongy. Its surface is\r\ndensely studded with thousands of spathillæ or anchor-pencils. The entire\r\nform of the lattice-mantle is always symmetrically polyhedral, since its\r\ndorsal and ventral halves are symmetrically developed on both sides of the\r\nequatorial plane, and therefore correspond perfectly to the enclosed\r\nsmaller halves of the central bivalve shell. The two valves of the\r\nlattice-mantle (dorsal and ventral valves) are never really united and\r\ngrown together, {1746}but are in loose contact in the equatorial plane;\r\nhere the free edges of both valves catch into one another by means of free\r\nramules (Pl. 128, figs. 1, 7). This loose connection is similar to what\r\noccurs in the Conchopsida (or in the Concharida with dentate edges), but\r\nnever so regular. The special form of the polyhedral lattice-mantle depends\r\non the number, arrangement, and development of the styles, which proceed\r\nover its surface; it preserves the polyhedral form of the calymma, on the\r\nsurface of which it is deposed.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic styles of the Coelographida (which are never found in\r\nthe preceding Coelodendrida) are longer hollow tubes, symmetrically\r\ndisposed on both valves. They are prominent over the surface of the\r\nfork-thicket in the Coelotholida, of the lattice-mantle in the\r\nCoeloplegmida. They bear in these latter a peculiar terminal coronet on\r\ntheir distal end, whilst in the former this end is armed with large pencils\r\nof spathillæ. The styles may be forked once or twice at their base, but in\r\ntheir greatest part they are verticillate, and not dichotomously branched\r\nlike the brushes. The lateral branches of the styles are usually very\r\nnumerous and regularly cruciate in alternating opposite pairs. In the odd\r\nnasal style, _e.g._, the first and third pairs of opposite lateral branches\r\nusually lie in the frontal plane, the second and fourth in the sagittal\r\nplane, perpendicular to the former, and so on. A similar regular\r\ndisposition of the lateral branches is found also in other styles, but not\r\nin all. There are certain styles in which the lateral branches are not\r\nopposite in pairs, but alternate or verticillate, and others in which they\r\nrepresent unequal branches of forks, so that each single segment of the\r\nbranched style represents the stouter branch of a fork, and the\r\nappertaining lateral branch the thinner branch of the fork. Further\r\naccurate examinations are required to recognise the different laws of the\r\nramification of the styles in the different forms of Coelographida. The\r\nlateral branches of the styles are usually again dichotomously branched\r\ninside the lattice-mantle, and their distal ends pass over into its\r\nnetwork. But the verticillate or cruciate branches, which arise from the\r\nfree part of the styles outside the lattice-mantle, are always armed with\r\nthe same elegant pencils of spathillæ which cover the surface of the\r\nfork-thicket in the Coelotholida, the surface of the lattice-mantle in the\r\nCoeloplegmida. These pencils also are often regularly opposite in pairs,\r\nand the pairs alternate in two planes perpendicular one to another (Pl.\r\n128, figs. 1, 4).\r\n\r\nThe terminal coronets are peculiar ornaments which protect the distal ends\r\nof the styles in the Coeloplegmida, whilst in the Coelotholida these are\r\narmed with the usual pencils of spathillæ (Pl. 122, fig. 8). Each coronet\r\nis usually produced by the double, triple, or quadruple furcation of the\r\nfree distal end of the style; therefore composed of four, eight, or sixteen\r\nterminal branches, which, on account of their peculiar form and function,\r\nwe may call \"fingers.\" More rarely the ramification of the coronets is more\r\nor less irregular, and sometimes the number of the fingers exceeds twenty\r\nor even thirty.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of species eight fingers are regularly disposed (Pl. 127,\r\nfigs. 1-3; Pl. 128, figs. 1-8). Often too sixteen occur, rarely four only.\r\nSometimes the fingers {1747}are placed nearly in one plane and form a hand.\r\nThe form of the fingers is very variable and most characteristic of the\r\nindividual species. Very often they have the shape of a human finger, and\r\nare smooth, spinulate, or armed with recurved hooks. The distal end of each\r\nfinger often again bears a small coronet or a spathilla (Pl. 128, figs.\r\n5-9), and sometimes it is arrow-shaped (Pl. 126, fig. 2_a_). All these\r\napophyses of the terminal coronets as well as the anchor-pencils of the\r\nmantle and the finest branches of the tubes, are hollow and filled up by\r\njelly.\r\n\r\nThe different number and arrangement of the styles offers the best means\r\nfor the distinction of genera in the Coelographida. The minimum number is\r\nsix (_Coelographis_, Pl. 126, fig. 1), the maximum number sixteen\r\n(_Coelothamnus_, Pl. 122, fig. 3, and _Coelagalma_, Pl. 126, fig. 4). Since\r\nthe arrangement of the styles in both valves is constantly symmetrical, the\r\nfundamental form of the whole body is in all Coeloplegmida \"amphithect,\" as\r\nin the _Ctenophora_. The longitudinal or main axis of the body is vertical,\r\nwith two distinct poles; the proboscis of the central capsule and the two\r\nrhinocannæ are directed upwards, towards the oral pole; the caudal tube of\r\neach valve is directed downwards, towards the aboral pole. The two other\r\naxes of the body are unequal, horizontal, and perpendicular one to the\r\nother; each has two equal poles. On the poles of the sagittal axis lie the\r\ngaleæ of the dorsal and ventral valves; on the poles of the frontal axis\r\nlie the two secondary openings or parapylae of the central capsule. The\r\nfrontal fissure or the large cleft between the dorsal and ventral valves of\r\nthe skeleton lies in the vertical frontal plane of the body, which is\r\nperpendicular to the vertical sagittal plane; the equatorial plane,\r\nhowever, is horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe _central capsule_ of the Coelographida exhibits the same shape and\r\nposition as in the preceding Coelodendrida. It is subspherical, slightly\r\ndepressed in the direction of the main axis, and lies enclosed between the\r\ntwo central valves of the lattice-shell. Its three constant openings lie in\r\nthe frontal plane, and therefore in the frontal fissure between the two\r\nvalves. The astropyle, or the main-opening of the capsule, lies on the oral\r\npole of the main axis, and its radiate operculum (_d_) is directed upwards;\r\nthe curved proboscis arising from it (_o_) is prominent between the mouths\r\nof the two opposed rhinocannæ. The two lateral parapylæ or accessory\r\nopenings lie on both sides of the aboral pole, on the right and left (Pl.\r\n127, figs. 4-6). The large spheroidal or somewhat lenticular nucleus (_n_)\r\nis usually about half as broad as the capsule, and contains numerous\r\nnucleoli. The protoplasm around the nucleus contains many vacuoles, and in\r\nthe oral part of the capsule (between nucleus and operculum) often numerous\r\ngroups of crystals (Pl. 127, figs. 4-6_k_, 7). The double membrane of the\r\ncentral capsule exhibits the same shape as in the other PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\nThe calymma, or the extracapsular jelly-veil, is in the Coelographida very\r\nvoluminous, and includes the entire skeleton, the fork-thicket of the\r\nCoelotholida, the lattice-mantle of the Coeloplegmida, and also the\r\nprominent large styles. Only the distal ends of the {1748}latter (with the\r\nterminal coronets), and the anchor pencils, covering the surface of the\r\nthicket and the mantle, seem to project over the surface of the calymma.\r\nThe entire form of the latter is therefore a symmetrical polyhedron. The\r\nphæodium fills up a small part only of the calymma, and is usually enclosed\r\nin the two galeæ and their rhinocannæ (Pl. 127, figs. 5, 9), but often also\r\na part of the phæodium is scattered around the oral half of the central\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Coelographida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Eight to sixteen long styles are prominent over\r\nthe surface of the fork-thicket, which is composed of the caudal brush and\r\nthe dichotomous basal branches of the styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 731. _Coelotholus_,[347] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Coelographida# with two paired lateral frenula on each\r\ngalea, without external lattice-mantle, armed with eight styles (two pairs\r\nof styles on each valve).\r\n\r\n{1749}The genus _Coelotholus_ and the two following genera form together\r\nthe subfamily Coelotholida, the hollow tubes of which do not communicate by\r\nanastomosing branches, and therefore form no lattice-mantle, as in the\r\nfollowing subfamily Coeloplegmida. Another important difference between\r\nthese two subfamilies of Coelographida is found in the arrangement of the\r\nmain tubes and their connection with the rhinocanna. In all Coelotholida a\r\npair of divergent frontal styles arise from the truncate oral side of each\r\ngalea, and are connected with the mouth of the rhinocanna by two lateral\r\nconvergent paired frenula (right and left); whereas the characteristic odd\r\nnasal style, which in all Coeloplegmida arises from the sagittal apex of\r\neach galea and is connected with the mouth of the rhinocanna by an odd\r\nsagittal frenulum, is always wanting. The total number of long verticillate\r\nstyles, which project over the outer surface of the fork-thicket, is eight\r\nin _Coelotholus_, whilst it is twelve in _Coelothauma_, and sixteen in\r\n_Coelothamnus_. The two latter may be derived from _Coelotholus_, as the\r\ncommon ancestral genus of this subfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Coelotholus octonus_, n. sp.

In the single species\r\nobserved each of the four main tubes (opposite in pairs on the frontal\r\ncorners of the two galeæ) is simply forked, as in _Coelotholus_; but whilst\r\nin this latter all eight styles remain simple, in _Coelothauma_ the\r\nanterior (or pectoral) branch only is simple, the posterior (or tergal)\r\nbranch is again forked.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Coelothauma duodenum_., n. sp.

Jena, Dec. 12, p. 6.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Coelographida# with two paired lateral frenula on each\r\ngalea, without external lattice-mantle, armed with sixteen styles (four\r\npairs of styles on each valve).\r\n\r\nThe genus #Coelothamnus# differs from its ancestral form, _Coelotholus_, in\r\nthe duplication of the number of long verticillate styles, which are\r\nprominent over the surface of the {1751}dense fork-thicket. Whilst in\r\n_Coelotholus_ each frontal main tube (arising from the frontal corner of\r\nthe galea at right and left) is divided into an anterior or pectoral, and a\r\nposterior or tergal style, in _Coelothamnus_ each of these two divergent\r\nmain styles is again forked, so that the total number of projecting and\r\nradially diverging styles amounts to sixteen. One Mediterranean species of\r\nthis genus, _Coelothamnus  davidoffii_, has been already described by\r\nBütschli in 1882 (Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool., vol. xxxvi. p. 486, Taf.\r\nxxxi.). Though its description on the whole is accurate, some important\r\nerrors, which may be here corrected, are to be met with. The two central\r\nvalves of the lattice-shell (dorsal and ventral) are symmetrically equal in\r\nsize and in form, as in all other Coelographida; the different forms and\r\nthe inverse arrangement of the two valves, described by Bütschli (pp. 488,\r\n491), were effected by an artificial dislocation and inversion. The\r\npeculiar opening [alpha], which, according to his opinion, was supposed to\r\nbring about a direct communication between the cavities of the galea and\r\nits valve, is in reality the optical section of the rhinocanna, the two\r\nconvergent frenula of which ([gamma]) he figured, but did not recognise.\r\n_Coelothamnus_ attains the greatest size among all Radiolaria; the diameter\r\nof the body in _Coelothamnus maximus_ amounts to 33 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Coelothamnus bivalvis_, n. sp.

In all these Coeloplegmida an odd nasal main style is\r\ndeveloped on the apex of the galea, and this is connected by an odd\r\nsagittal frenulum with the mouth of the rhinocanna, _Coelographis_ differs\r\nfrom the other Coelographida in the minimum number of coronal styles, viz.,\r\nthree on each valve, an odd anterior (nasal) and two paired posterior\r\n(tergal).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Coelographis regina_, n. sp.

It differs from this mainly in the peculiar form of\r\nthe twenty-four terminal coronets, which are flabellate and very similar to\r\nthe terminal branches of _Coelodendrum flabellatum_ (Pl. 121, figs. 5, 6).\r\nI formerly supposed, therefore, that both forms belonged to one and the\r\nsame species. But though I had no complete specimens of the two species, I\r\nwas afterwards led to the opinion that one and the same peculiar form of\r\nterminal branches is here produced by adaptation to similar conditions in\r\ntwo very different genera.

These are placed\r\nbetween the odd nasal and the paired frontal styles, are directed forwards,\r\nand may therefore be called pectoral styles, corresponding to those of\r\n_Coelostylus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Coeloplegma murrayanum_, n. sp. (Pl. 127, figs. 1-13.).\r\n\r\nShell-mantle about as long as broad, its frontal perimeter subcircular, or\r\nslightly pentagonal, with five convex sides, its sagittal perimeter also\r\nnearly circular. Odd nasal style with six to eight, the paired pectoral\r\nstyles with two or three, lateral styles with three to five, and tergal\r\nstyles with six to nine pairs of branches. The central capsule constantly\r\ncontains masses of crystals (figs. 4-7). Terminal coronets (on the free\r\ndistal ends of the styles) three times furcate, each with eight simple and\r\nshort fingers. This interesting species, discovered by Dr. John Murray in\r\nAugust 1882, during the expedition of H.M.S. \"Triton,\" in great numbers in\r\nthe Gulf Stream, off the Færöe Channel, is very variable and connected by\r\nnumerous transitional forms with the following closely allied species.\r\n(Compare the following note.)\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 1.6 to 2.2, breadth 1.5 to 2.1.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Gulf Stream, off the Færöe Channel, in depths\r\nbetween 40 and 200 fathoms, John Murray.\r\n\r\n\r\n{1758}2. _Coeloplegma tritonis_, n. sp.

Odd nasal\r\nstyle with twelve to fourteen, the paired pectoral styles with three to\r\nfour, lateral styles with six to eight, and tergal styles with eight to ten\r\npairs of branches. Coronets three times forked, each with eight terminal\r\nbranches, bearing a small spinulate knob. This remarkable species, in\r\nexternal appearance very different from the preceding, is connected\r\nimmediately with it by numerous transitional varieties; both species\r\nrepresent the opposite terminal poles of a long series of \"Darwinian\r\nmetamorphic forms.\" If only the two specimens, figured in Pl. 127, figs. 1\r\nand 2, were known, every one would distinguish them as two widely different\r\nspecies. But the careful comparison of numerous intermediate forms\r\ndemonstrates that there is no \"missing link\" in this long and remarkable\r\nchain.

Two of these are odd (as\r\nin _Coelospathis_ and _Coelostylus_), viz., the longitudinal anterior nasal\r\nstyle, and the horizontal sagittal style. The six others are paired (as in\r\n_Coeloplegma_), viz., two anterior or pectoral, two lateral or frontal, and\r\ntwo posterior or tergal styles. Since _Coelagalma_ in this highest\r\ndeveloped armature exceeds all the other Coeloplegmida, and exhibits at the\r\nsame time the utmost complexity in structural detail, it may be regarded as\r\none of the most perfect forms not among the PHÆODARIA only, but among all\r\nRadiolaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Coelagalma mirabile_, n. sp.

Nasal odd style\r\nlonger; and sagittal odd style shorter, than the six paired styles of each\r\nvalve; the two pectoral styles are directed forwards, the two lateral\r\nstyles are nearly opposed in the horizontal frontal diameter, while the two\r\nshorter tergal styles are directed backwards. The terminal coronets (at the\r\ndistal ends of the sixteen styles) are four times forked, with sixteen\r\nequal spinulate fingers, each finger at the distal end with eight recurved\r\nteeth. The entire surface of the bivalved latticed mantle is densely\r\nstudded with hundreds of most elegant anchor-pencils, so that the external\r\nappearance of this beautiful species becomes one of the most wonderful\r\namong Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 5.4, breadth 3.6.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central area of the Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1760}NOTE ON THE DIMENSIONS AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE DESCRIBED SPECIES OF\r\nRADIOLARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the dimensions of the species of Radiolaria described in the present\r\nwork are given in millimetres. In the majority of the species the\r\ndimensions of only a single observed specimen have been measured by the\r\nmicrometer, and usually only the most important proportions have been\r\nrecorded. But since the outlines of nearly all the species figured (with\r\nvery few exceptions) have been drawn by the camera lucida, and therefore\r\nusually are almost perfectly exact, and since the excellent artist, Mr.\r\nAdolph Giltsch, has executed the lithographic plates with the greatest\r\naccuracy, having examined the objects themselves under the microscope, it\r\nis very easy to determine the dimensions of all the separate parts by\r\ncomparative measurement. In very many of the species described (perhaps\r\nnine hundred or a thousand) several specimens of each species (usually\r\nthree or four) have been measured comparatively, and the dimensions\r\nrecorded are taken as averages. A very important contribution to the\r\ngeneral conception of the proportions, and especially to the important\r\nquestion of the constancy of the dimensions, has been given by my honoured\r\nfriend Dr. Reinhold Teuscher of Jena. This excellent observer, to whom I am\r\nindebted for much and important co-operation in my Radiolarian work, has\r\ninstituted at my request a long series of measurements, with the view of\r\ncomparing the dimensions (of the entire skeleton as well as of its\r\nindividual parts) in numerous (usually twenty or thirty) specimens of one\r\nand the same species. About three hundred species of very different groups\r\n(mainly #Sphæroidea#, #Discoidea#, #Spyroidea#, and #Cyrtoidea#) have been\r\nmeasured in this manner, and the general survey of the results obtained\r\n(about eight thousand measurements were recorded) has enabled me to form a\r\ngood opinion of the constancy and variability of the dimensions in the\r\nindividual species. The general result is, that they are not absolutely\r\nconstant in any given case, but that each species (of which many specimens\r\nhave been carefully compared) exhibits a certain degree of variability in\r\nall its proportions. The general meaning of \"species,\" therefore, is in the\r\nunicellular Radiolaria the same as in all other organisms, and its\r\ndevelopment follows the same laws as are so accurately explained by Charles\r\nDarwin in his Origin of Species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. _List of Twenty-two Deep-Sea Radiolarians from the Banda Sea._\r\n\r\nP.
