For heroic devotion to science in the face of\r\ndanger and the scorn of their fellowmen, there is no class who have\r\nmade a better record than inventors. Most inventions, too, are far\r\nmore than scientific calculation, and it is the human story of the\r\nvarious factors in this great age of invention that is here set forth\r\nfor boy readers.\r\n\r\nNew discoveries, or new applications of forces known to exist,\r\nillustrating some broad principle of science, have been the chief\r\nconcern of the author in choosing the subjects to be taken up in the\r\nvarious chapters, so that it has been necessary to limit the scope\r\nof the book, except in one or two instances, to inventions that have\r\ncome into general use within the last ten years. In \"The Boy's Book\r\nof Inventions,\" \"The Second Boy's Book of Inventions,\" and \"Stories\r\nof Invention,\" Mr. Baker and Mr. Doubleday have told the stories\r\nof many of the greatest inventions up to 1904, including those of\r\nthe gasoline motor, the wireless telegraph, the dirigible balloon,\r\nphotography, the phonograph, submarine boats, etc. Consequently for\r\nthe most part the important developments in some of these machines\r\nare treated briefly in the final chapters, while the earlier chapters\r\nare devoted to new inventions, which, if made before 1904, did not\r\nreceive general notice until after that time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the subjects treated in the earlier chapters are here spoken\r\nof as new inventions, all of them are not recent in the strictest\r\nsense of the word, for men had been working on the central idea of\r\nsome of them for many years before they actually were developed to a\r\nstage where they could be patented and sent out into the world.\r\n\r\n    H.

First, man conquered the\r\nland with locomotive, electricity, steam plow, telegraph, telephone,\r\nwireless and a thousand other inventions. Almost at the same time he\r\nconquered the ocean with steamship, cable, and wireless. Now, through\r\nthe invention of the aeroplane, he is making a universal highway of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nSuch was the way the real beginning of aviation was summarized one\r\nday to a bright young man who spent all his spare time out of school\r\nat the laboratory of his good friend the scientist. Always in good\r\nhumour, and with a world of knowledge of things that delight a\r\nboy's heart, the man was never too deep in experiments to answer any\r\nquestions about the great inventions that have made this world of\r\nours such a very interesting place.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory was filled with models of machines, queer devices\r\nfor scientific experiment, a litter of delicate tools, shelves of\r\ntest tubes, bottles filled with strange smelling fluids, and rows\r\nupon rows of books that looked dull enough, but which the scientist\r\nexplained to the boy contained some of the most fascinating stories\r\never told by man.\r\n\r\nComing back to aeroplanes the boy said, \"But my father says that\r\naviation is so new it is still very imperfect.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered the scientist, taking a crucible out of the\r\nflame of his Bunsen burner and hanging it in the rack to cool, \"but\r\nit has seen a marvellous development in the last few years.\r\n\r\n\"It was less than ten years ago--the end of 1903, to be exact--that\r\nOrville and Wilbur Wright first sailed their power-driven aeroplane,\"\r\nhe continued, \"but so rapid has been the progress of aviation that\r\nnowadays we are not surprised when a flight from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific is accomplished. It seems a tragic thing that Wilbur Wright\r\nshould have been called by death, as he was in May, 1912, by typhoid\r\nfever, for he was at the very zenith of his success and probably\r\nwould have carried on his work to a far, far greater development.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE FIRST WRIGHT AEROPLANE\r\n\r\n  This was the machine that made the first successful flight in the\r\n  history of the world, of a power-driven, man-carrying aeroplane.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE FIRST WRIGHT GLIDER\r\n\r\n  This device was first flown as a kite without a pilot, and the\r\n  levers worked by ropes from the ground, to test the principles.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SECOND WRIGHT GLIDER\r\n\r\n  The machine was launched into the air from the top of a sand dune\r\n  against a high wind, and proved a great success.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A LONG GLIDE\r\n\r\n  Wright glider in full flight over Kill Devil Hill, N. C.]\r\n\r\nAfter a little pause the scientist continued, saying that, at\r\nthe time the Wright brothers made their first flight they were\r\nexperimenting with what we now know as a biplane, or Chanute type\r\nglider, at Kill Devil Hill, near Kitty Hawk, N. C. It is a desolate\r\nwind-swept spot on the coast where only a little rank marsh grass\r\ngrows on the sheltered sides of the great sand dunes. The brothers\r\nchose this barren place for their experiments because here the winds\r\nwere the most favourable for their purpose.\r\n\r\nThey were not ready for their first attempt to fly in a\r\nmotor-propelled machine until December 17th, and though they sent out\r\na general invitation to the few people living in that section, only\r\nfive braved the cold wind. Three of these were life savers from the\r\nKill Devil Hill station near by. Doubtless the other people had heard\r\nof the numerous failures of flying machines and expected the promised\r\nexhibition of the silent young men who had spent the autumn in their\r\nneighbourhood, to be just another such. They were sadly mistaken,\r\nfor they missed a spectacle that never before had been seen in all\r\nthe history of the world. Nowadays we are familiar with the sight of\r\nan aeroplane skimming over the ground and then soaring into the sky,\r\nbut to the five people who, besides the inventors, were present it\r\nundoubtedly was almost beyond belief.\r\n\r\nThe brothers had installed a specially constructed gasoline engine\r\nin their glider, and after thoroughly testing it they carried the\r\nmachine out on to a level stretch of sand, turned it so that it\r\nwould face the wind, and while the life savers held it in place the\r\nbrothers went over every wire and stay. They felt perfectly confident\r\nthat the machine would fly, but they made no predictions, and in fact\r\nspoke but few words between themselves or to the five men gathered\r\nabout the aeroplane. The machine was not the smoothly finished one\r\nwe know to-day as the Wright biplane. The operator lay flat on his\r\nface on the lower plane, the elevating rudder composed of two smaller\r\nplanes stuck out in front, instead of behind, and there were several\r\nother important differences in design, but in principle it was the\r\nsame machine that has carried the fame of the American inventors\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\nFinally the operator took his place, the engine was started, the\r\nsignal was given, the men holding the machine dropped back and it\r\nstarted out along the rail from which it was launched. It ran along\r\nthe track to the end, directly against the wind, and rose into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIt meant that the air had been turned into a highway, but the Wright\r\nbrothers were very modest in setting down an account of their\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\"The first flight,\" they wrote, \"lasted only twelve seconds,\"\r\na flight very modest compared with that of birds, but it was,\r\nnevertheless, the first in the history of the world in which a\r\nmachine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the\r\nair in free flight, had sailed forward on a level course without\r\nreduction of speed, and had finally landed without being wrecked. The\r\nsecond and third flights (the same day) were a little longer, and the\r\nfourth lasted fifty-nine seconds, covering a distance of 853 feet\r\nover the ground against a twenty-mile wind.\r\n\r\n\"After the last flight the machine was carried back to camp and set\r\ndown in what was thought to be a safe place. But a few minutes later,\r\nwhen engaged in conversation about the flights, a sudden gust of wind\r\nstruck the machine and started to turn it over. All made a rush to\r\nstop it, but we were too late. Mr. Daniels, a giant in stature and\r\nstrength, was lifted off his feet, and, falling inside between the\r\nsurfaces, was shaken about like a rattle in a box as the machine\r\nrolled over and over. He finally fell out upon the sand with nothing\r\nworse than painful bruises, but the damage to the machine caused a\r\ndiscontinuance of experiments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" said the scientist, \"we see the record aeroplane flight for\r\n1903 was 853 feet while in 1911 a Wright biplane flew more than 3,000\r\nmiles from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In ten years more we may\r\nlook back to our monoplanes and biplanes of to-day in the same way\r\nwe do now on the first cumbersome 'horseless carriages' that were\r\nreplaced by the high-powered automobiles we know now. Some experts\r\nin aeronautics say that we may even see the complete passing of the\r\nmonoplane and biplane types in favour of some now unknown kind of\r\naeroplane.\"\r\n\r\nWho knows but that the man to invent the perfect aeroplane will be\r\none of the boy readers of this! Everywhere the making and flying of\r\nmodel aeroplanes by boys is looked upon, not only as play, but as a\r\nvaluable and instructive sport for boys and young men of any age. One\r\nof the indications of this may be seen in the public interest taken\r\nin the tournaments of boys' model aeroplane clubs. Not only do crowds\r\nof grown people with no technical knowledge of aeroplanes attend the\r\ntournaments, but also older students of aviation who realize that\r\namong the young model fliers there may be another Orville or Wilbur\r\nWright, a Blériot, or a Farman.\r\n\r\nSo important is this knowledge of aviation considered that the\r\nprinciples and the practical construction of model aeroplanes are\r\ntaught in many of the public schools. Instead of spending all their\r\nschool hours in the study of books, the boys now spend a part of\r\ntheir time in the carpenter shop making the model aeroplanes which\r\nthey enter in the tournaments. Of course, dozens of types of models\r\nare turned out, some good and some bad, but in the latter part of\r\nChapter III is given a brief outline for the construction of one of\r\nthe simplest and most practicable model aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nNot only the schools but the colleges also have taken up aviation,\r\nand nearly every college has its glider club, and the students work\r\nmany hours making the gliders with which they contest for distance\r\nrecords with other clubs. As a consequence aviation has become a\r\nregular department of college athletics, and intercollegiate glider\r\nmeets are a common thing.\r\n\r\nThe epochs of invention go hand in hand with the history of\r\ncivilization, for it has been largely through invention that man has\r\nbeen able to progress to better methods of living. In the olden days,\r\nwhen there were few towns and every one lived in a castle, or on the\r\nland owned by the lord of the castle, war was the chief occupation,\r\nand the little communities made practically everything they used by\r\nhand. When they went abroad they either walked or rode horses, or\r\nwent in clumsy ships. Pretty soon men began to invent better ways of\r\ndoing things; one a better way of making shoes, another a better way\r\nof making armour, and the people for miles around would take to going\r\nto these men for their shoes and armour. Towns sprang up around these\r\nexpert workmen, and more inventions came, bringing more industries to\r\nthe towns. Inventions made industry bigger, and war more disastrous\r\nbecause of the improvement invention made in weapons. Then came\r\ninventions that changed the manner of living for all men--the\r\nmachines for making cloth, which did away with the spinning-wheels of\r\nour great-grandmothers, and created the great industry of the cotton\r\nand woollen mills; the inventions for making steel that brought about\r\nthe great steel mills, and enabled the armies of the world to use the\r\ngreat guns we know to-day, and the battleships to carry such heavy\r\narmour plate; the steam locomotive that enabled man to travel swiftly\r\nfrom one city to another; the steamship that brought all the nations\r\nclose together; the telegraph, cable, telephone, and wireless, that\r\nmade communication over any distance easy; the submarine that made\r\nwar still more dangerous; and finally the aeroplane that makes a\r\nhighway of the air in which our earth revolves.\r\n\r\nBut even from the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans man had\r\ntried to fly. Every nation had its list of martyrs who gave their\r\nlives to the cause of aviation. In modern times, too, many attempts\r\nhad been made to discover the secret of flight. Otto Lilienthal, a\r\nGerman, called the \"Flying Man,\" had made important discoveries about\r\nair currents while gliding through the air from hills and walls by\r\nmeans of contrivances like wings fitted to his person. Others had\r\nmade fairly successful gliders, and Prof. Samuel Pierepont Langley\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution in Washington actually had made a\r\nmodel aeroplane that flew for a short distance. Also, Clement Ader,\r\na Frenchman, had sailed a short way in a power flier, and Sir Hiram\r\nMaxim, the English inventor, had built a gigantic steam-driven\r\naeroplane that gave some evidences of being able to fly. But these\r\nmen were laughed at as cranks, while the Wrights kept their secret\r\nuntil they were sure of the success of their biplane. However,\r\nthe question as to who first rode in a power-driven flier under\r\nthe control of the operator still is the subject of a world-wide\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nIt was as boys that the Wright brothers first began experiments\r\nwith flying, and though they have received the highest praises from\r\nthe whole world, Orville still is, and until his death Wilbur was,\r\nthe same quiet, modest man who made bicycles in Dayton, and the\r\nsurviving brother of the pair is working harder than ever. In telling\r\nthe story of their own early play, that later proved to be one of\r\nthe most important things they ever did, the Wright brothers wrote\r\nfor the _Century Magazine_: \"We devoted so much of our attention\r\nto kite-flying that we were regarded as experts. But as we became\r\nolder we had to give up the sport as unbecoming to boys of our age.\"\r\nAs every boy knows, kite-flying was one of the early methods of\r\nexperimenting with air currents and greatly aided the scientists\r\nin their exploration of the ocean of air that surrounds the world,\r\neddying and swirling up and down, running smoothly and swiftly here,\r\ncoming to a dead stop there--but always different from the minute\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut before the Wright brothers gave up flying kites they had\r\nplayed with miniature flying machines. They were known then as\r\n\"helicopteres,\" but the Wright brothers called them \"bats,\" as the\r\ntoys came nearer resembling bats than anything else the boys had seen\r\nabout their home in Dayton, Ohio. Most boys probably have played with\r\nsomething of the kind themselves, and maybe have made some. They were\r\nmade of a light framework of bamboo formed into two screws driven in\r\nopposite directions by twisted rubber bands something like the motors\r\non boys' model aeroplanes of to-day. When the rubber bands unwound\r\nthe \"bats\" flew upward.\r\n\r\n\"A toy so delicate lasted only a short time in our hands,\" continues\r\nthe story of the Wright brothers, \"but its memory was abiding. We\r\nbegan building them ourselves, making each one larger than that\r\npreceding. But the larger the 'bat' the less it flew. We did not know\r\nthat a machine having only twice the size of another would require\r\neight times the power. We finally became discouraged.\"\r\n\r\nThis was away back in 1878, and it was not until 1896 that the\r\nWright brothers actually began the experiments that led to their\r\nworld-famous success.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough it all started when Orville, the younger of the two,\r\nwas sick with typhoid fever, the same disease that caused Wilbur\r\nWright's death. According to all accounts, the elder brother, having\r\nremained away from their bicycle factory in order to nurse Orville,\r\nwas reading aloud. Among other things he read to Orville the\r\naccount of the tragic death of Otto Lilienthal, the German \"Flying\r\nMan\" who was killed while making a glide.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MOTOR OF THE WRIGHT BIPLANE]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A 16-CYLINDER 100-HORSEPOWER ANTOINETTE MOTOR\r\n\r\n  A frequent prize winner.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN 8-CYLINDER 5O-HORSEPOWER CURTISS MOTOR]\r\n\r\nTHE GNOME MOTOR\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Standard Gnome aeroplane motor, showing interior.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Photo by Philip W.

They were sure they could, and they got so excited\r\nin talking it over that it nearly brought back Orville's fever.\r\nWhen he got well they studied aeronautics with the greatest care,\r\napproaching the subject with all the thoroughness that later made\r\ntheir name a byword in aviation for care and deliberation.\r\n\r\nNeither of these two young men was over demonstrative, and neither\r\nwas lacking in the ability for years and years of the hardest kind\r\nof work, but together they made an ideal team for taking up the\r\ninvention of something that all the scientists of the world hitherto\r\nhad failed to develop. Wilbur was called by those who knew him one\r\nof the most silent men that ever lived, as he never uttered a word\r\nunless he had something to say, and then he said it in the most\r\ndirect and the briefest possible manner. He had an unlimited capacity\r\nfor hard work, nerves of steel and the kind of daring that makes the\r\naviator face death with pleasure every minute of the time he is in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nNo less daring is Orville, the younger of the two, who is a little\r\nbit more talkative and more full of enthusiasm than was Wilbur. He\r\nwas the man the reporters always went to when they knew the elder\r\nbrother would never say a word, and his geniality never failed them.\r\nHe also is a true scientist and tireless in the work of developing\r\nthe art of aviation.\r\n\r\nFirst, the brothers read all the learned and scientific books of\r\nProfessor Langley, and Octave Chanute, the two first great American\r\npioneers in aviation, and the reports of Lilienthal, Maxim, and the\r\nbrilliant French scientists.\r\n\r\nThey saw, as did Professor Langley, that it was out of the question\r\nto try to make a machine that would fly by moving its wings like a\r\nbird. Then they began with great kites, and next made gliders--that\r\nis, aeroplanes without engines--for the brothers knew that there\r\nwas no use in trying to make a machine-driven, heavier-than-air\r\nflier before they had tested out practically all the theories of the\r\nearlier scientists.\r\n\r\nThey fashioned their gliders of two parallel main planes like those\r\nof Octave Chanute. The width, length, distance between planes,\r\nrudders, auxiliary planes and their placing were all problems for the\r\nmost careful study. It was very discouraging work, for no big thing\r\ncomes easily. As their experiments proceeded they said they found one\r\nrule after another incorrect, and they finally discarded most of the\r\nbooks the scientists had written. Then with characteristic patience\r\nthey started in to work out the problem from first principles. \"We\r\nhad taken aeronautics merely as a sport,\" they wrote later. \"We\r\nreluctantly entered upon the scientific side of it. But we soon found\r\nthe work so fascinating that we were drawn into it deeper and deeper.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wrights knew that an oblong plane--that is, a long narrow\r\none--driven through the air broadside first is more evenly supported\r\nby the air than would be a plane of the same area but square in\r\nshape. The reason for this is that the air gives the greatest amount\r\nof support to a plane at the entering edge, as it is called in\r\naviation--that is, the edge where it is advancing into the air. A\r\nlittle way from the edge the air begins to slip off at the back and\r\nsides and the support decreases. Thus, it will be seen that if the\r\nrear surface, which gives little support because the air slips away\r\nfrom under it, is put at the sides, giving the plane a greater spread\r\nfrom tip to tip and not so much depth from front to rear, the plane\r\nis more efficient--that is, more stable, less subject to drifting,\r\nand better able to meet the varying wind currents. Scientists\r\ncall this proportion of the spread to the depth the aspect ratio\r\nof planes. For instance, if a plane has a spread of 30 feet and a\r\ndepth of 6 feet it is said to have an aspect ratio of _5_. This is\r\na very important consideration in the designing of an aeroplane,\r\nbecause aspect ratio is a factor in the speed. In general, high\r\nspeed machines have a smaller aspect ratio than slower ones. The\r\naspect ratio also has an important bearing on the general efficiency\r\nof an aeroplane, but the lifting power of a plane is figured as\r\nproportionate to its total area. In order to hold the air, and keep\r\nits supporting influence, aviators have tried methods of enclosing\r\ntheir planes like box kites, and putting edges on the under sides.\r\nThis latter was found a mistake because the edge tended to decrease\r\nthe speed of the flier and did more harm than the good obtained\r\nthrough keeping the air.\r\n\r\nIn aviation, as we know it to-day, aeroplane builders believe in\r\ngiving their planes a slight arch upward and backward from the\r\nentering edge, letting it reach its highest point about one third\r\nof the way back and then letting it slope down to the level of the\r\nrear edge gradually. This curve, which is called the camber, is\r\nmathematically figured out with the most painstaking care, and was\r\none of the things the Wright brothers worked out very carefully\r\nin their early models. Also, planes are driven through the air at\r\nan angle--that is, with the entering edge higher than the rear\r\nedge--because the upward tilt gives the air current a chance to\r\nget under the plane and support it. This angle is called by the\r\nscientists the angle of incidence and is very important because of\r\nits relation to the lifting powers of the planes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MODEL AEROPLANE FLIERS\r\n\r\n  Every fair Saturday the model makers and fliers spend in the\r\n  parks either practising for or holding flight tournaments.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MODERN COLLEGE MAN'S GLIDER]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OTTO LILIENTHAL MAKING A FLIGHT IN HIS GLIDER]\r\n\r\nAnother one of the difficult problems the inventors had to struggle\r\nwith was the balance of their fliers. Before the Wright brothers\r\nflew, it was thought that one of the best ways was to incline the\r\nplanes upward from the centre--that is--make them in the shape of\r\na gigantic and very broad V. This is known in science as a dihedral\r\nangle. The idea was that the centre of gravity, or the point of the\r\nmachine which is heaviest and which seeks to fall to earth first\r\nthrough the attraction of gravitation, should be placed immediately\r\nunder the apex of the V. The scientists thought that the V then would\r\nkeep the machine balanced as the hull of a ship is balanced in the\r\nwater by the heavy keel at the bottom. The Wrights decided that this\r\nmight be true from a scientific point of view, but that the dihedral\r\nangle kept the machine wobbling, first to one side and then righting\r\nitself, and then to the other side and righting itself. This was a\r\npractical fault and they built their flier without any attempt to\r\nhave it right itself, but rather arched the planes from tip to tip as\r\nwell as from front to rear.\r\n\r\nThe winglike gliders of Lilienthal and Chanute had been balanced\r\nby the shifting of the operator's body, but the Wrights wanted a\r\nmuch bigger and safer machine than either of these pioneers had\r\nflown. In their own words, the Wrights \"wished to employ some system\r\nwhereby the operator could vary at will the inclination of different\r\nparts of the wings, and thus obtain from the wind forces to restore\r\nthe balance which the wind itself had disturbed.\" This they later\r\naccomplished by a device for warping or bending their planes, but in\r\ntheir first glider there was no warping device and the horizontal\r\nfront rudder was the only controlling device used. This latter device\r\non the first glider was made of a smaller plane, oblong-shaped and\r\nset parallel to, and in front of, the main planes. It was adjustable\r\nthrough the system of levers fixed for the operator, who in those\r\ndays lay flat on the front plane.\r\n\r\nThus the two main planes and the adjustable plane in front with\r\nstays, struts, etc., made up the first Wright glider.\r\n\r\nThe Wright brothers took their machine to Kitty Hawk, N. C., in\r\nOctober, 1900, presumably for their vacation. They went there because\r\nthe Government Weather Bureau told them that the winds blew stronger\r\nand steadier there than at any other point in the United States. Also\r\nit was lonely enough to suit the Wrights' desire for privacy. It was\r\ntheir plan to fly the contrivance like a boy does a huge box kite,\r\nand it looked something like one. A man, however, was to be aboard\r\nand operate the levers. According to the Wright brothers' story the\r\nwinds were not high enough to lift the heavy kite with a man aboard,\r\nbut it was flown without the operator and the levers worked from the\r\nground by ropes.\r\n\r\nA new machine the next year showed little difference of design, but\r\nthe surface of the planes was greater. Still the flier failed to\r\nlift an operator. At this time the Wright brothers were working with\r\nOctave Chanute, the Chicago inventor, engineer and scientist whom\r\nthey had invited to Kitty Hawk to advise them. After many discussions\r\nwith Chanute they decided that they would learn the laws of aviation\r\nby their own experience and lay aside for a time the scientific data\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nThey began coasting down the air from the tops of sand dunes, and\r\nafter the first few glides were able to slide three hundred feet\r\nthrough the air against a wind blowing twenty-seven miles an hour.\r\nThe reason their glider flights were made against the wind was\r\nbecause the wind passing swiftly under the planes had the same effect\r\nas if the machine was moving forward at a good clip, for the faster\r\nthe machine moves, or the faster the air passes under it, the easier\r\nit remains aloft. In other words, no one part of the air was called\r\nupon to support the planes for any length of time, but each part\r\nsupported the planes for a very short time. For instance, if you are\r\nskating on thin ice you run much less danger of breaking through if\r\nyou skate very fast, because no one part of the ice is called upon to\r\nsupport you for long.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the Wright brothers were approaching their goal. Slowly and\r\nwith rare patience they were accumulating and tabulating all the\r\ndifferent things different kinds of planes would do under different\r\ncircumstances. In the fall of that year they made about one thousand\r\ngliding flights, several of which carried them six hundred feet or\r\nmore. Others were made in high winds and showed the inventors that\r\ntheir control devices were all right.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1903, which always will be remembered as the banner\r\none in the history of aviation, the brothers, confident that they\r\nwere about to succeed in their long search for the secret of the\r\nbirds, continued their soaring or gliding. Several times they\r\nremained aloft more than a minute, above one spot, supported by a\r\nhigh, steady wind passing under their planes.\r\n\r\n\"Little wonder,\" wrote the Wright brothers a few years, later, \"that\r\nour unscientific assistant should think the only thing needed to keep\r\nit indefinitely in the air would be a coat of feathers to make it\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the inventors did to keep their biplane glider in the air\r\nindefinitely, however, was to add several hundred pounds to the\r\nweight in the shape of a sixteen-horsepower gasoline motor. The total\r\nweight of the machine when ready to fly was 750 pounds. Every phase\r\nof the problem had been worked out in detail--all the calculations\r\ngone over and proved both by figures and by actual test. The\r\nplanes, rudders, and propellers had been designed by mathematical\r\ncalculations and practical tests.\r\n\r\nThe main planes of this first machine had a spread from tip to tip of\r\n40 feet, and measured 6 feet 6 inches from the entering edge to the\r\nrear edge, a total area of 540 square feet. This will show how great\r\nis the spread of the main planes as compared to their length from\r\nfront to rear. The two surfaces were set six feet apart, one directly\r\nabove the other, while the elevating rudder was placed about ten\r\nfeet in front of the machine on a flexible framework. This elevating\r\nrudder was composed of two parallel horizontal planes which together\r\nhad an area of eighty square feet. The elevating planes could be\r\nmoved up or down by the operator just as he desired to fly upward or\r\ndownward. The machine was steered from right to left or left to right\r\nby two vertical vanes set at the rear of the machine about a foot\r\napart. They were a little more than six feet long, extending from the\r\nupper supporting plane to a few inches below the lower supporting\r\nplane. These also were turned in unison by the operator, according to\r\nthe direction toward which he wished to fly.\r\n\r\nThe most intricate device of their machine, however, was not\r\nperfected on their first biplane. This is the one for maintaining a\r\nside to side balance, or lateral equilibrium, as the scientists say.\r\nIn watching the flights of gulls, hawks, eagles, and other soaring\r\nbirds, the brothers had observed that the creatures, while keeping\r\nthe main part of their wings rigid, frequently would bend the extreme\r\ntips of their wings ever so slightly, which would seem to straighten\r\ntheir bodies in the air. The inventor decided that they needed some\r\nsuch device as nature had given to these birds.\r\n\r\nThe system was called by the scientists the torsional wing system,\r\nwhich means that the tip ends of the wings were flexible and could\r\nbe warped or bent or curled up or down at will by the operator. Only\r\nthe rear part of the tips of the wings on the Wright machines could\r\nbe bent, but this was enough to keep the machine on an even keel when\r\nproperly manipulated. How the Wright modern machines are operated is\r\nfully described on page (99). The whole machine was mounted on a pair\r\nof strong light wooden skids like skiis or sled-runners.\r\n\r\nTo start the early Wright biplanes, the machines were placed on a\r\nmonorail, along which they were towed by a cable. The force for\r\ntowing them at sufficient speed was obtained by dropping from the top\r\nof a derrick built at the rear of the rail a ton of iron which was\r\nconnected with the cable. The later Wright biplanes were equipped\r\nwith rubber-tired wheels mounted on the framework, which still\r\nretained the skids. Heavy rubber springs were provided to absorb the\r\nshock. With the wheels the machine could run over the ground of its\r\nown power and thus the cumbersome derrick and monorail were done away\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe operator was supposed to lie on his face in the middle of the\r\nlower plane, but in the later machines a seat was provided for him\r\nalongside the engine, and in still later ones seats for one or two\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nThe engine which was designed by the Wright brothers themselves\r\nfor this purpose, was a water-cooled four-cylinder motor which\r\ndeveloped sixteen horsepower from 1,020 revolutions per minute.\r\nThe engine was connected with the propellers at the rear of the\r\nbiplane by chains. The propellers were about eight feet in diameter\r\nand the blades were six to eight inches wide. The materials used\r\nin the biplane were mostly durable wood like spruce pine and ash,\r\nthe metal in the engine and the canvas on the planes. There was not\r\none superfluous wire. Everything had a use, and even the canvas\r\nwas stretched diagonally that it might fit more tightly over the\r\nframework of the planes and offer less wind resistance, and also\r\nstretch more easily for the wing warping.\r\n\r\nFinally on December 17, 1903, everything was in readiness for the\r\nfirst attempt of these two patient men--then unknown to the world--to\r\nfly in a power-driven machine. That first flight, made practically\r\nin secret amid the desolate sand dunes of the North Carolina coast,\r\nlasted only twelve seconds. However, it was the first time, but one,\r\nin the history of the world that a machine carrying a man had lifted\r\nitself from the ground and flown entirely by its own power.\r\n\r\nThe two succeeding flights were longer, and the fourth covered 853\r\nfeet, lasting fifty-nine seconds.\r\n\r\nThe inventors were not heralded as the greatest men of their time.\r\nThere were no medals or speeches. The five men--fishermen and life\r\nsavers--who saw the flights agreed that it was wonderful, but they\r\nkept the Wrights' secret and the brothers calmly continued their\r\nstudies and experiments.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1904 found them at work on Huffman Prairie about eight\r\nmiles east of Dayton. The first trials there were not very successful\r\nand the brothers, who had worked seven long years in secret, had the\r\nunpleasant experience of failing to show satisfactory results to the\r\nfew friends and reporters invited to see an aeroplane flight. Their\r\nnew machine was larger, heavier, and stronger, but the engine failed\r\nto work properly.\r\n\r\nOf course this was no great disappointment to those two silent,\r\ndetermined young men. \"We are not circus performers,\" they said. \"Our\r\naim is to advance the science of aviation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd advance it they did.\r\n\r\nTheir experiments continued, and in 1904 they made a record of three\r\nmiles in 5 minutes 27 seconds. The next year, 1905, they made a\r\nrecord flight of 24.20 miles and remained in the air 38 minutes 13\r\nseconds at heights of from 75 to 100 feet.\r\n\r\nAll this time the brothers were solving problems and correcting\r\nfaults, but in 1904 and 1905 their chief endeavour was to keep their\r\nmachines from tipping sidewise when they turned. Only the most\r\ntechnical study and the final development of their wing-warping\r\ndevice solved the problem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the strangest part was the lack of interest shown in their\r\nwork by the world and even by their own townsmen, for, though there\r\nhad been several newspaper accounts of their test flights, no great\r\nenthusiasm was aroused.\r\n\r\nThey were not wealthy and they had spent more on their experiments\r\nthan they could afford, so all this time they had proceeded without\r\nattracting any more attention than necessary. They desired to perfect\r\ntheir patents before letting the world know the secret of their\r\ninventions, and spent the next two years in business negotiations.\r\nMeanwhile, the French inventors were making much progress and soon\r\nbrought out several successful aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nWhy was this?\r\n\r\nWhy was it that the art of air navigation sought by man since the\r\nearliest times should have been discovered and mastered so quickly?\r\n\r\nThe answer lies in the putting together of two things by the Wright\r\nbrothers--that is, their discovery of the kind of a plane that would\r\nstay aloft with the air passing under it at a swift enough clip to\r\ngive it support, and their adaptation of the gasoline engine to the\r\nuse of driving the plane forward with enough speed.\r\n\r\nWhen they began work, the gasoline engine was just coming to its\r\nreal development. It was light, developed a high power, and its fuel\r\ncould be concentrated into a small space. These things were essential\r\nto the success of the aeroplane--light weight, high power, and\r\nconcentrated fuel. And these were things that the early inventors\r\nlacked. Sir Hiram Maxim equipped his machine with a steam engine,\r\nwhile Langley used steam engines in most of his models. These were\r\nvery heavy, cumbersome, gave slight power in comparison to their\r\nweight, and could carry only a little fuel with them.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the adaptation of the gasoline engine to the use of the\r\naeroplane marked the difference between mechanical flight and no\r\nflight, but it also is not to be doubted that those aviators, who are\r\nmore mechanical than scientific, have overrated the importance of the\r\nengine in aeroplane construction. Before engines ever were used, the\r\nChanute type of biplane had to be worked into a state of reliability,\r\nif not perfection. Now the scientific leaders in aviation are giving\r\nevery bit as much attention to the perfection of their planes, their\r\ngliding possibilities, and the scientific rules governing their\r\naction as they are to their engines.\r\n\r\nMost boys understand, at least generally, how an automobile or\r\nmotor-boat engine works. Scientists call gasoline engines \"internal\r\ncombustion motors,\" and that means that the force is gathered from\r\nthe explosion of the gasoline vapour in the cylinder. Enough gasoline\r\nto supply fuel to run an aeroplane motor for as much as eight or nine\r\nhours can be carried in the tank. From the tank a small pipe carries\r\nthe gasoline to a device called the carbureter. The carbureter\r\nturns the gasoline into gas by spraying it and mixing it with air,\r\nfor gasoline turns into a very inflammable and explosive gas when\r\nmixed with the oxygen in the air. So this gas, if lighted in a closed\r\nspace, will explode. The explosion takes place in the motor-cylinder\r\nby the application of an electric spark, and the force pushes the\r\npiston, which turns the crank and drives the aeroplane propeller,\r\nautomobile wheels, or motor-boat screw.\r\n\r\nThus we have the piston driven out and creating the first downward\r\nthrust, but the thrusts must be continuous. The piston must be\r\ndrawn back to the starting place, the vapours of the exploded gas\r\nexpelled, and the new gas admitted to the cylinder ready for the next\r\nexplosion. On the ordinary four-cycle motor two complete revolutions\r\nof the flywheel are necessary to do all the work. First, we must have\r\nthe explosion that causes the initial thrust; second, the return of\r\nthe piston rod in the cylinder by the momentum of the flywheel as it\r\nrevolves from the initial thrust, thus forcing out the burned gas of\r\nthe first explosion; third, the next downward motion to suck in a\r\nfresh supply of gas; and, fourth, the next upward thrust to compress\r\nit for the second explosion. It sounds simple enough, but it isn't,\r\nas every one knows who has tried to run a gasoline motor for himself.\r\n\r\nThe carbureter must do its work automatically and convert the air\r\nand gasoline into gas in just the right proportions. A slight fault\r\nwith the feed of gasoline or air would cause trouble. Also the\r\nelectric-spark system that ignites the gas and causes the explosions\r\nmust be in perfect running order. The explosions cause great heat, so\r\nsome system of cooling the cylinders either by air or water must be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nOnly one cylinder has been explained here, but most engines have\r\nseveral, each working at a different stage, so that the power is\r\nexerted on the shaft continuously. For instance, take a four-cylinder\r\nengine; on the instant that the first cylinder is exploding and\r\ndriving the shaft, the second cylinder is compressing gas for the\r\nnext explosion, the third is getting a fresh supply of gas, and the\r\nfourth is cleaning out the waste gas of the explosion of a second\r\nbefore. Thus it will be seen why the explosions are almost constant.\r\n\r\nNow think of the aeroplane motor that has fourteen cylinders and\r\ndevelops 140 horsepower! This is probably the most powerful aeroplane\r\nengine in the world, although there are many motor boats that have\r\nengines developing 1,000 horsepower.\r\n\r\nIn the early days when scientists were groping for the secret of air\r\nnavigation the best that the clumsy steam engines they had at their\r\ndisposal would do was to generate one horsepower of energy for every\r\nten pounds of weight. These days the light powerful aeroplane engines\r\nwe hear roaring over our heads are generating one horsepower of\r\nenergy for every three or three and a half pounds of dead weight,\r\nand engines have been constructed weighing only one pound to every\r\nhorsepower, though they are impractical for general use.\r\n\r\nThe first engines that were used in aeroplanes were simply automobile\r\nengines adapted to air navigation. The main question in those days\r\nwas lightness and power. This was achieved by skimming down the best\r\navailable automobile engines so that they were as light as safety\r\nwould allow.\r\n\r\nAlthough lightness is still an important factor in aeroplane engine\r\nconstruction, many authorities declare that it is growing less so as\r\nthe science advances and aeroplanes are able to carry heavier loads.\r\n\r\nThere were many intricate and difficult problems, however, that\r\nattended taking a motor aloft to drive an aeroplane. The motor had\r\nto run at top speed every second, for it could not rest on a low\r\ngear as an automobile engine could. First one part and then another\r\nwould give out and the motors were constantly overheating. Experience\r\ntaught the makers how to make their machines light enough and yet\r\nstrong enough to do the required work.\r\n\r\nIt was in cooling that the greatest difficulties were met, and it\r\nwas this that brought about the great innovations in motor building.\r\nThe system of cooling the engine with water required much heavy\r\nmaterial, such as pipes, pumps, water, water jackets, and radiator.\r\n\r\nOn account of the general efficiency of a water-cooled engine many\r\nbuilders of aeroplanes stuck to it and developed it to a very high\r\nstandard. At present many of the prize-winning engines are water\r\ncooled, as, for instance, the Wright and Curtiss.\r\n\r\nAll of these water-cooled engines and several standard air-cooled\r\nmakes are of the reciprocating type that have stationary cylinders\r\nand crankcase while the crankshaft rotates like that of the motor\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nThe famous Curtiss, Anzani, Renault, and others are all engines of\r\nthis type. They all differ, but all have a high capacity, as we know\r\nfrom the records they have broken. The Anzani and R. E. P. makers,\r\nwhose motors are air cooled, have used to great advantage the plan of\r\nmaking their motors star-shaped--that is, with the cylinders arranged\r\nin a circle around the crankshaft.\r\n\r\nThis is the shape taken by the famous air-cooled rotary engines of\r\nwhich the much-discussed Gnome is the best known make. In this rotary\r\nmotor the cylinders and crankcase revolve about the crankshaft which\r\nis stationary. Authorities are divided over the Gnome, which has many\r\nsevere critics as well as many enthusiastic supporters. Its lightness\r\nis certainly an advantage. The ordinary Gnome has seven cylinders\r\nand develops fifty horsepower while the newest models have fourteen\r\ncylinders and develop 100 and 140 horsepower.\r\n\r\nA brief description of the motor here will suffice to show the\r\ngeneral principle of the rotary engine. The stationary crankshaft\r\nis hollow, and through it the gasoline vapour passes from the\r\ncarbureter at the rear to the cylinders. Of course the inlet valves\r\nin the pistons are made to work automatically. The magneto is also\r\nplaced behind the motor and the segments revolve on the crankcase.\r\nWires extend from the segments to the spark plugs in the cylinders,\r\nand revolve with them. The cylinders are turned out of solid steel\r\nand the whole engine is conceded by experts to be one of the most\r\nwonderfully ingenious ever built. The cylinders and crankcase\r\nthemselves serve as flywheel, thereby eliminating the dead weight\r\nof the usual heavy flywheel in the other types of motors, and the\r\nrotation serves to cool the engine perfectly. Again, the rotary\r\nmotor is light and small, while it develops a tremendously high\r\npower. Aviators also claim for it other advantages too technical for\r\nconsideration here.\r\n\r\nMany authorities, in fact, declare that the rotary engine is the\r\naeroplane motor of the future. It is very popular among the French\r\naviators and at present holds a great many speed records. It was with\r\none of these high-power Gnomes that Claude Grahame-White, the English\r\nflier, won the Gordon Bennett race at Belmont Park in the fall of\r\n1910, and Weyman again in England in 1911.\r\n\r\nWhile this high state of development in the aeroplane motor has been\r\nattained comparatively within a few years, the art of flying has\r\noccupied the mind of man since it was described in Greek mythology.\r\nThe Chinese for thousands of years have used kites and balloons.\r\nThe ancient Greeks watched the wonderful flights of the birds and\r\ninvented myths about men who were able to fly. Then Achytes, his mind\r\nfired by these stories, invented a device in the form of a wooden\r\ndove which was propelled by heated air. Other inventors made devices\r\nthat were intended to fly, and during the reign of Nero, \"Simon the\r\nMagician\" held the world's first aviation meet in Rome. According to\r\nthe account, he \"rose into the air through the assistance of demons.\"\r\nIt further states that St. Peter stopped the action of the demons\r\nby a prayer, and that Simon was killed in the resultant fall. Simon\r\nmade another record that way by being the first man to be killed in\r\nan aeronautical accident. Other records show that Baldud, one of the\r\nearly tribal kings in what later was named England, tried to fly over\r\na city, but fell and was killed. A little later, in the eleventh\r\ncentury, a Benedictine monk made himself a pair of wings, jumped from\r\na high tower and broke his legs. These wings really were rude gliders\r\nand the principle remained in the minds of men, even in those days\r\nwhen their chief occupation was war. According to the legends, a\r\nman named Oliver of Malmesburg, who lived during the Middle Ages,\r\nbuilt himself a glider and soared for 375 feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution\r\n\r\n  THE CHANUTE TYPE GLIDER\r\n\r\n  Upon this machine was based the invention of the biplane.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution\r\n\r\n  THE HERRING GLIDER\r\n\r\n  Based on the idea of the Lilienthal gliders.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN EARLY HELICOPTER\r\n\r\n  An idea that was abandoned before the aeroplane became a reality.]\r\n\r\nTHE THREE GREAT PIONEERS IN AVIATION\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution\r\n\r\n  Prof. Samuel Pierpont Langley]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the _Scientific American_\r\n\r\n  Sir Hiram Maxim]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of E. L. Jones, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  Octave Chanute]\r\n\r\nIt was in the fifteenth century that men first began to make flying a\r\nscientific study by making records and, in part at least, tabulating\r\nthe results of their experiments.\r\n\r\nAmong these early students of the science were Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nwho is best known to the world as a painter and sculptor, but who\r\nwas a great engineer and architect of his time, and Jean Baptiste\r\nDante, a brother of the great poet. Although Da Vinci was the more\r\nscientific in his experiments, Dante made greater progress, and it is\r\non record that he made many wonderful flights with a glider of his\r\nown construction over Lake Trasimene. He launched his glider from a\r\ncliff into the teeth of the wind, showing thereby his knowledge of\r\nthe fact that a glider works best when flown against a high wind,\r\nbecause in that way the air is passing under it at greater speed. In\r\none flight he made about 800 feet, which would be a fine record for\r\nany glider manipulated by an expert to-day. Finally Dante attempted\r\nan exhibition at Perugia, at the marriage festival of a celebrated\r\ngeneral, fell on the roof of the Notre Dame Church and broke one of\r\nhis legs.\r\n\r\nDa Vinci had three different schemes for human flight. One was the\r\nold idea of bird flight, first dreamed of by the Greeks when Ovid\r\nwrote the poem of \"Dædalus and Icarus.\" Scientists called the\r\nmachine that Da Vinci proposed an orthopter and the operator was\r\nsupposed by the movement of both arms and legs to fly by flapping\r\nthe wings. Needless to say it did not work, and we know to-day that\r\nbird flight by wing flapping is probably impossible for man. Another\r\nof Da Vinci's ideas is still being worked upon by some inventors.\r\nThis was a machine known as the helicopter, which was supposed to\r\nfly upward by the twisting of a great horizontal screw ninety-six\r\nfeet in diameter. The idea was just the same as that of the toy that\r\nstarted the Wright brothers to thinking. The trouble with Da Vinci's\r\nmachine was that he had no power to run it. Boys in playing with toy\r\nhelicopters to-day can run them with rubber bands, but Da Vinci had\r\nto turn his screw by human power. Little was accomplished with this\r\nmachine, although Da Vinci showed its practicability with models.\r\nThe third scheme of this Italian scientist is one that many years\r\nlater was perfected and demonstrated at every county fair--that is,\r\nthe parachute. The first parachute was very crude, but it soon was\r\ndeveloped to a fairly high stage of effectiveness and men came down\r\nfrom the tops of towers in them without much injury.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1742, the Marquis de Bacqueville, then sixty-two years\r\nold, made a contrivance with which he flew about nine hundred feet\r\nbefore he fell into a boat in the Seine River and broke his leg. The\r\nMarquis had announced in advance that he would fly from his great\r\nhouse in Paris, across the Seine River and land in the famous Garden\r\nof the Tuileries. A crowd assembled and marvelled when the nobleman\r\nsailed into the teeth of the wind supported by what apparently were\r\ngreat wings. Something went wrong after a flight that would be\r\nconsidered remarkable by a scientific glider to-day, and his fall\r\nresulted in a broken leg for the experimenter. According to the\r\nauthorities, all these experiments were not very valuable to science,\r\nbecause while the flights were accurately described the construction\r\nof the fliers (except in the case of Leonardo da Vinci) was not\r\ngiven, or only indicated in the most uncertain and unscientific\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 a French scientist named Blanchard attempted to make a flying\r\nmachine of which the man driving it was to be the power. He was still\r\nworking with it when ballooning became known, and he took up that\r\nsport with avidity.\r\n\r\nAt that point came the true division between heavier-than-air and\r\nlighter-than-air machines. Before 1783 many scientists had hinted at\r\nthe practicability of a hot air or gas balloon, but all successful\r\nflying experiments had been made with what we suppose to have been\r\nsome form of gliders. However, in 1783 Tiberius Cavallo, an Italian\r\nscientist living in London, made a small hydrogen balloon, and was\r\nfollowed by the manufacture of fairly successful balloons by the\r\nMontgolfier brothers, two French inventors.\r\n\r\nFrom that time ballooning, with which this chapter has no concern,\r\nmade rapid strides, until to-day the balloon has reached the stage\r\nwhere great motor-driven balloons are used by the European armies,\r\nand also to carry passengers.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the heavier-than-air machine, known these days as\r\nthe aeroplane, was taken in 1810, by Sir George Cayley, an Englishman\r\nand a true scientist, who constructed a glider and tabulated much\r\nvaluable information. It was this scientist who made the first\r\nconclusive demonstrations looking toward the proof that man can never\r\nfly like a bird, but must proceed upon the principle of sustained\r\nplanes. Sir George set down many laws of equilibrium governing the\r\ncontrol of flying machines, estimated the power necessary to carry a\r\nman, and even hinted at the possibility of a gas engine more powerful\r\nand lighter than the then crude steam engine. He declared that a\r\nplane driven through the air, and inclined upward at a slight angle,\r\nwould tend to rise and support a weight, and also that a tail with\r\nhorizontal and vertical vanes would tend to steady the machine and\r\nenable the pilot to steer it up or down.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution\r\n\r\n  LANGLEY'S STEAM MODEL\r\n\r\n  This tandem monoplane made several successful trial flights.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MAXIM AEROPLANE\r\n\r\n  Maxim's great machine was claimed as the first successful\r\n  aeroplane. In trials it rose a few inches off the ground.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MEDALS WON BY THE WRIGHT BROTHERS\r\n\r\n  Top, Langley medal bestowed by the Smithsonian Institution;\r\n  bottom, medal authorized by Act of Congress.]\r\n\r\nThis, it will be seen, was a very close approach to the idea of the\r\naeroplane as we know it to-day. It remained for another British\r\ninventor, by the name of Henson, to carry these ideas to a further\r\ndevelopment, and with his colleague, F. Stringfellow, he worked out a\r\nmodel that embodied most of the principles of the present-day flier\r\nof the monoplane type. They decided the proper proportion for the\r\nwidth and length of the plane and steadied their machine with both\r\nhorizontal and perpendicular rudders. In 1844 Henson and Stringfellow\r\nbuilt a model of their aeroplane and equipped it with a small steam\r\nengine. A subsequently constructed steam-propelled model made a free\r\nflight of forty yards. This is claimed to be the first flight of a\r\npower-driven machine, although it was only a model. In 1866 F. H.\r\nWenham, another Englishman, took out a patent on an aeroplane made\r\nup of two or more planes, or, as the scientists call it, two or\r\nmore superposed surfaces. Immediately following this, Stringfellow\r\nconstructed a steam-propelled model of triplane type, but it was no\r\nmore successful than his monoplane. This latest model may be seen in\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution at Washington to-day along with other\r\nmodels marking the progress of aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nIn the years following other inventors contributed much valuable\r\ninformation to the data concerning aviation. Among these was Warren\r\nHargrave, the Australian, who had discovered the box kite, and who\r\nhad seen in it the principle for the aeroplane. Hargrave even built\r\na small monoplane weighing about three pounds and propelled by\r\ncompressed air, which flew 128 feet in eight seconds.\r\n\r\nThough the Wright brothers were the first to make a practical\r\nman-carrying, power-propelled aeroplane, they were not the first\r\nmen to be carried off the ground by such a machine. The first\r\nman admitted by most authorities to have flown in a power-driven\r\naeroplane was Clement Ader, a Frenchman, who had spent his life in\r\nthe study of air navigation. His first machine was of monoplane type\r\ndriven by a forty-horsepower steam engine. It was called the _Eole_\r\nand it had its first test before a few of the inventor's friends near\r\nthe town of Gretz on October 9, 1890, making, according to witnesses,\r\na free flight of 150 feet. Ader built two more machines in subsequent\r\nyears and succeeded in interesting the French military authorities.\r\nIn October of 1897 he made several secret official tests of his last\r\nmachine, the _Avion_. It had a spread of 270 square feet, weighed\r\n1,100 pounds, and was driven by a forty-horsepower steam engine. The\r\nday for the trial was squally but he persevered. The flier ran at\r\nhigh speed over the ground, several times lifted its wheels clear\r\noff its track and finally turned over, smashing the machine. The\r\nofficials did not consider the exhibition successful, and the support\r\nof the army was withdrawn. Ader in disgust gave the _Avion_ to a\r\nFrench museum and abandoned aviation, with success almost within his\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nShortly before this time Prof. Samuel Pierpont Langley of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution and Octave Chanute, the great American\r\npioneers in aviation, were making their early experiments. Professor\r\nLangley experimented with numerous kinds of model fliers, and\r\nfinally, on May 6, 1896, launched a steam-propelled model over the\r\nPotomac River. According to the scientist Dr. Alexander Graham Bell,\r\nwho was present, it flew between 80 and 100 feet and then \"settled\r\ndown so softly and gently that it touched the water without the least\r\nshock, and was in fact immediately ready for another trial.\" The\r\nsecond test was equally successful. The speed was between twenty and\r\ntwenty-five miles an hour and the distance flown about 3,000 feet.\r\nProfessor Langley's first aerodrome, as he called it (the word is\r\nnow used to mean aviation field), was made in the form of a tandem\r\nmonoplane about sixteen feet long from end to end and with wings\r\nmeasuring about thirteen feet from tip to tip. The steam engine and\r\npropellers were placed between the forward and aft planes. The whole\r\nmachine weighed about thirty pounds and of course was too small to\r\ncarry a pilot.\r\n\r\nLangley next made a model which took the form of a tandem biplane,\r\nand which had some success in flights. When the Government\r\nappropriated $50,000 for him to build an aerodrome that would carry a\r\nman, Langley began to experiment with a gasoline engine. He used his\r\ntandem biplane and a motor that developed two and a half to three\r\nhorsepower. The whole machine weighed fifty-eight pounds, and the\r\nplanes, which were set at a dihedral angle, had sixty-six square feet\r\nof surface. A successful test without a pilot was made on the Potomac\r\nRiver below Washington on August 8, 1903, and while the spectators\r\nand reporters were lauding him the inventor merely remarked: \"This is\r\nthe first time in history, so far as I know, that a successful flight\r\nof a mechanically sustained flying machine has been seen in public.\"\r\n\r\nThe man-carrying machine was ready for its tests a few months later.\r\nEver since having been financed by the Government, Langley had been\r\nat work, and the result was a tandem monoplane much like his early\r\nmodels. It was driven by a gasoline motor placed amidships which\r\nacted on twin screw propellers, which also were between the tandem\r\nplanes. The whole machine with the pilot weighed 830 pounds, and\r\nhad 1,040 square feet of wing surface. It was fifty-two feet long\r\nfrom front to rear and the wings measured forty-eight feet from tip\r\nto tip. The wings were arched, like those of modern aeroplanes,\r\nand the double rudder at the rear had both horizontal and vertical\r\nsurfaces to steer the machine up or down, or from right to left. The\r\naerodrome did not have any device for keeping it on an even keel,\r\nsuch as the ailerons we know to-day, or the wing-warping system of\r\nthe Wright machine. This was a serious drawback, according to the\r\npresent-day scientists, but Professor Langley had set his wings in\r\na dihedral angle--that is, like a broad V, to give what is called\r\nautomatic stability. This dihedral angle, it will be remembered, is\r\none of the principles discarded by the Wright brothers early in their\r\nexperiments as one that tended to keep the machine oscillating from\r\nside to side. Professor Langley realized this, it is said, and to\r\noffset it had already advanced several ideas along the line of wing\r\nwarping, for keeping his machine on an even keel when buffeted by the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe aerodrome also lacked the wheels now used on aeroplanes for\r\nstarting and alighting, and even the skids that were used on the\r\nfirst Wright machines. His motor was remarkably well adapted to the\r\nwork. It developed 50 horsepower with a minimum of vibration, and\r\nwith its radiator, water, pump, tanks, carbureter, batteries, and\r\ncoil weighed twenty pounds, or about five pounds per horsepower. The\r\narrangement of the five cylinders around the shaft like the points of\r\na star was one that has become very popular in modern aviation motors.\r\n\r\nThe first trial took place at Widewater, Va., on September 7, 1903.\r\nThe machine was placed on a barge on the Potomac River; the pilot,\r\nCharles M. Manley, Professor Langley's able young assistant, took his\r\nseat in the little boat amidships, and a catapult arrangement, like\r\nthe early Wright starting device, sent it into the air. To the bitter\r\ndisappointment of Langley and his friends the machine dived into\r\nthe water. It came up immediately, the daring Manley undaunted and\r\nuninjured. Investigation showed that in launching it the post that\r\nheld the guys which steadied the front wings had been so bent that\r\nthe forward planes were useless.\r\n\r\nAt the next trial, December 8, the rear guy post was injured in a\r\nsimilar accident and the machine fell over backward. This ended the\r\nexperiments, as the Government appropriation had been spent, and the\r\nmachine was repaired and stored in the Smithsonian Institution, where\r\nit is yet.\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley died a few years after this, feeling that his great\r\nwork had never been appreciated or understood by the world. Many have\r\ndeclared that he died of a broken heart as a result of the frequent\r\nridicule of the public and press. Although he never saw the triumph\r\nof aerial navigation, he died firm in the belief that it was only a\r\nmatter of time and the working out of theories then laid down until\r\nman could fly. His last hours were cheered by the receipt of a copy\r\nof resolutions of appreciation passed by the Aero Club of America.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Frenchman Ader had actually flown in a\r\npower-driven machine of his own construction, at private tests, while\r\nCaptain Le Bris and L. P. Mouillard, Frenchmen, and Otto Lilienthal,\r\na German, had been carrying on important glider flights. Also Sir\r\nHiram Maxim, the American-born inventor who was knighted in England,\r\nmade a great aeroplane that was tested with some success. The\r\nmachine was built in 1889 and was mounted on a track. It was called\r\na multiplane--that is, it had several planes, one above the other,\r\nand was driven by a powerful steam engine. The whole machine weighed\r\nthree and a half tons and had a total surface of 5,500 square feet.\r\nDuring its tests on the track it lifted a few inches off the ground.\r\nThus Maxim claimed that his was the first machine that had ever\r\nlifted a man off the ground by its own power.\r\n\r\nIt was Otto Lilienthal, however, the \"flying man,\" who established a\r\nsystematic study of one phase of aviation which became general enough\r\nto be called the Lilienthal School. This was the system of practising\r\non gliders before attempting to go into the air with power-driven\r\nmachines. As will be remembered, this was exactly the system the\r\nWright brothers followed out.\r\n\r\nLilienthal's first experiments were made in 1891 with a pair of\r\nsemicircular wings steadied by a horizontal rudder at the rear. The\r\nwhole apparatus weighed forty pounds and had a total plane surface of\r\n107 square feet. He would run along the ground and jump from the top\r\nof a hill. He made many good flights, and in 1893 with a new glider\r\naveraged 200 to 300 yards and steered up or down or to either side\r\nat will. Lilienthal found that the air flowing along the earth's\r\nsurface had a slightly upward current, as science tells us it does,\r\nand that it would carry him upward if the wind was blowing strong\r\nenough. Hence he could go forward either up or down in about the same\r\nway that a yacht tacks against the wind. But Lilienthal had the same\r\ntrouble in balancing that the Wright brothers had at first, so he\r\nkept an even keel as best he could by swinging his legs and body from\r\nside to side as he hung underneath the glider.\r\n\r\nThe \"flying man\" made about 2,000 flights and then constructed a\r\nstill more successful biplane glider for which he built an engine.\r\nHe was killed while making a glide on August 9, 1896, however, and\r\nthe motor was never used. Several authorities who were in touch\r\nwith Lilienthal declared that the machine had become wobbly and\r\nunreliable. This, they said, was the cause of its collapsing in\r\nmidair under the heavy strain.\r\n\r\nLilienthal's death, though mourned by scientists all over the world,\r\ndid not interfere with the great work he had started, for his system\r\nhad many disciples both in Europe and America. Among these, besides\r\nthe Wrights, were the Americans Octave Chanute and A. M. Herring, and\r\nPercy S. Pilcher of the University of Glasgow. Pilcher was killed\r\nthree years after Lilienthal, September 30, 1899, while trying to\r\nmake a glide in stormy weather.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE FIRST SANTOS-DUMONT AEROPLANE\r\n\r\n  This was the first successful aeroplane to be flown in Europe,\r\n  and was quickly followed by others.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CROSS-CHANNEL TYPE BLÉRIOT MONOPLANE\r\n\r\n  The Blériot monoplane was the first of the monoplane type to make\r\n  a success in Europe.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A VOISIN BIPLANE\r\n\r\n  The Voisin brothers perfected the first permanent aeroplane used\r\n  in Europe. Henri Farman made his first wonderful flights in a\r\n  Voisin.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GLENN CURTISS ABOUT TO MAKE A FLIGHT]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HENRI FARMAN STARTING ALOFT WITH TWO PASSENGERS]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LOUIS BLÉRIOT SHORTLY AFTER COMPLETING HIS\r\n  TRANS-CHANNEL FLIGHT]\r\n\r\nGreat credit must be given to Chanute because it was in great part\r\nthrough his advice that the Wright brothers achieved final\r\nsuccess, and all biplanes to-day are known to the technical side of\r\nthe aviation world as Chanute type machines. Chanute and Herring\r\nstarted experiments with gliders among the sand dunes on the southern\r\nshore of Lake Michigan, and, after some indifferent success with the\r\nLilienthal monoplane type of glider, made a flier of five surfaces\r\none above the other. The rudder was in the rear and the pilot hung\r\nbelow the machine. One by one experiments pared down the number of\r\nplanes to three and then to two. The planes were arched, as they are\r\nin modern aeroplanes. The rudder extended behind the contrivance and\r\nhad both horizontal and vertical blades. The whole machine weighed 23\r\npounds and had 135 square feet of plane surface.\r\n\r\nThe biplane was eminently satisfactory and Herring decided to make\r\nan engine for it and sail in a power-driven flier--or a dynamic\r\naeroplane, as the scientists call it. His motor was a compressed air\r\nmachine and he proposed to go into the air as if for a glide and then\r\nstart the engine. According to newspaper accounts, he accomplished\r\nthis and his compressed air engine drove him forward seventy-three\r\nfeet in eight or ten seconds against a strong breeze. The flight was\r\nnot given very much consideration, however, for lack of authoritative\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nThis brings us around again to the activities of the Wright\r\nbrothers, who started their work with the glider built along the\r\nlines laid down by Octave Chanute. They had the active support\r\nand aid of this inventor throughout their three or four years\r\nof experiments, although many other scientists were inclined to\r\ndiscredit their work.\r\n\r\nWhile the brothers were going ahead with their practical flier the\r\nEuropean scientists were developing with rapid strides and Prof. John\r\nJ. Montgomery of Santa Clara College, Santa Clara, Cal., who was\r\nkilled in a glider accident in 1911, was astonishing the far West\r\nwith gliding experiments of great importance.\r\n\r\nMontgomery's best glider was a tandem monoplane with a device by\r\nwhich the pilot could change at will the amount of curvature of any\r\nof the wings. This gave him the tremendous advantage of being able\r\nto vary the lifting power of the wings independently of each other\r\nand hence a means of maintaining side to side balance. Professor\r\nMontgomery made his own flights until injuring his leg in alighting,\r\nand then he hired trained aeronauts to glide from great heights. As\r\nit turned out it would have been better had he never resumed flying\r\nhimself. He used balloons to carry up the gliders and when they\r\nreached the required altitude the operator cut the cable. Daniel\r\nMaloney, a daring parachute jumper, and two other aeronauts, named\r\nWilkie and Defolco, carried on these hair-raising experiments.\r\n\r\nFlights were made at Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San José, Oakland, and\r\nSacramento, in 1905. The balloon would take up the aeroplane, and\r\naviator, who sat on a saddle like a bicycle seat between the tandem\r\nplanes and manipulated the wing control and rear rudder with hand\r\nlevers and a pair of stirrups for his feet. In April of that year a\r\nforty-five-pound glider, such as the one described, with Maloney in\r\nthe seat, was taken up four thousand feet. When the aviator cut loose\r\nhe glided to earth, making evolutions never before made by man in the\r\nair, and finally landed as lightly as a feather on a designated spot.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward Maloney while making a sensational glide was\r\nkilled. As the balloon was rising with the aeroplane, a guy rope\r\nswitched around the right wing and broke the post that braced the two\r\nrear wings and which also gave control over the tail. Those below\r\nshouted to Maloney that the machine was broken, but he probably did\r\nnot hear, and when he cut loose the machine turned turtle.\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest of all the many aeroplane fatalities was the\r\naccident early in the fall of 1911, in which Professor Montgomery was\r\nkilled while experimenting with his glider.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the pioneers whose work has counted for the most in\r\nthe early history of aviation were Americans--that the science can\r\nalmost be claimed as a development of American genius. True, Ader was\r\nthe first man to fly in a power-propelled machine, and Lilienthal\r\nled the way in the science of gliding, but it remained for Chanute,\r\nLangley, Montgomery, and the Wright brothers to gather all this\r\nscientific data together and put it to practical use so that the\r\nmotor could be installed and power flight, or dynamic flight, as the\r\nscientists call it, begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAEROPLANE DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n   HOW THE INVENTORS CARRIED ON THE ART OF AVIATION UNTIL IT BECAME\r\n   THE GREATEST OF ALL SPORTS AND THEN A GREAT INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nSo interested in aviation had our young friend become that he forgot\r\nall other inventions in his enthusiasm for flying. He never missed\r\na chance to go to the aviation field, and sometimes his scientist\r\nfriend would go with him. These days were rare treats indeed, for\r\nthe boy always learned some new and important points from their\r\nconversations.\r\n\r\nWith them we have seen how the science of aeronautics has been\r\ndivided into two great departments: balloons, or lighter-than-air\r\nfliers, and all other machines that are not maintained in the air\r\nby hot air or gas. We have seen also the three great divisions of\r\nheavier-than-air aviation--that is, orthopters or wing-flapping\r\nmachines; helicopters or machines that fly upward through the\r\noperation of horizontal screws; and aeroplanes. Lastly we see the\r\nthree divisions of aeroplanes: gliders; dynamic aeroplanes, or the\r\nmachines we know to-day; and true bird soaring, the art of flying\r\nwithout artificial power and without the flapping of wings.\r\n\r\nBut on every side the boy heard people talking of great feats of\r\nflying that he knew nothing about.\r\n\r\n\"Who was Santos-Dumont? What was that first trans-Channel flight?\r\nWhy do they always talk about the first Rheims meet?\" he asked one\r\nafternoon as he was returning home from the field with the scientist.\r\n\r\nThe man could not answer the questions all in one breath, but we will\r\nfollow his explanation, which extended over many pleasant hours, and\r\nsee how aviation developed into a mighty sport and industry.\r\n\r\nFor several years following 1905 the world of aviation was led by\r\nEuropeans--mostly Frenchmen who readily grasped the principles of the\r\nscience and made the best and lightest motors that the world has ever\r\nseen. The United States, however, was the first nation to experiment\r\nwith aeroplanes for military purposes, although at present the\r\ncountry is far behind France, England, and Germany in the development\r\nof aeroplanes for use in war.\r\n\r\nAlberto Santos-Dumont, a daring young Brazilian who a few years\r\nearlier had astounded the world with his achievements with dirigible\r\nballoons, was the first of the aviators working in Europe to\r\nconstruct a practical man-carrying power flier. Scores of brilliant\r\nforeigners were working on the principles for gliders laid down\r\nby Lilienthal, but Santos-Dumont, working along the ideas of the\r\nscientists who had built power-propelled models, made himself a\r\nclumsy biplane equipped with a 50-horsepower motor and actually\r\ninaugurated public flights, considering that all done by the Wrights\r\nup to that time was experimental and practically in secret.\r\n\r\nOn August 22, 1906, he made his first flight near Paris. It was\r\nbrief, but authorities agree that it was the first time in Europe\r\nthat a power-propelled flier had risen in free flight with a man at\r\nthe steering wheel since Ader's secret flight in 1892. Two months\r\nlater he made a public flight of 221 metres in 21 seconds, winning\r\nthe world's first regularly offered aviation prize. This was the\r\nArchdeacon Cup of 2,000 francs authorized by the Aero Club of France\r\nfor a flight of 100 metres.\r\n\r\nScientists gave these flights more attention than they did the\r\nflights of the Wright brothers the year before because they were\r\nviewed by many thousands of people and also by men who had studied\r\nthe science of aviation for years. Besides this, Santos-Dumont\r\nmade no secret of the construction or workings of his machine as\r\nthe Wright brothers did. He was already a popular idol through his\r\nwork with dirigible balloons, and being very rich--the son of a\r\nmillionaire plantation owner in Brazil--he did not have the same\r\nfinancial incentive for keeping his plans secret.\r\n\r\nHis flights gave the aviators of France tremendous encouragement and\r\nit was but a short time until half a dozen aeroplanes, the makes of\r\nwhich are all well known now, were making successful flights and\r\nbreaking records.\r\n\r\nSantos-Dumont called his biplane an aeromobile. The two main planes\r\nhad perpendicular surfaces enclosing them so that the wings of each\r\nside looked like two box kites hitched together side by side, as\r\nshown in the picture. The rudder extended to the front and it also\r\nlooked like a box kite. The pilot sat just in front of the wings and\r\ncould manipulate his rudder from side to side or up and down. Thus\r\nhe could steer his machine from right to left, upward or downward.\r\nThe Brazilian had not solved the problem of keeping his aeromobile\r\nfrom tipping sideways, so he arranged its wings in a dihedral angle,\r\nwhich balanced it fairly well. The starting and alighting device was\r\na set of wheels which we know so well to-day. The biplane contained\r\n65 square feet of plane surface and the total weight was 645 pounds.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important factor in this machine was an\r\neight-cylinder 50-horsepower Antoinette gasoline motor. This was the\r\nfirst time that this now famous motor was used in an aeroplane and it\r\ngave promise at that time of the prize-winning capabilities it later\r\ndeveloped. The propeller, which was made of aluminum, was about six\r\nfeet in diameter, or about two feet less than the diameter of the\r\ntwin screws in the early Wright biplanes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Copyright H.

This early machine\r\nis described by one authority as something like a cross between a\r\nbox kite and a Chanute glider. Extending out behind the two main\r\nplanes was a rudder like a huge box kite, which was used to steer\r\nthe machine from right to left. This also helped to keep the biplane\r\nfrom tipping forward or backward. A single horizontal rudder in front\r\nsteered it upward or downward. These rudders were manipulated by\r\nthe operator, who sat between the two main planes in front of his\r\nengine, by either pushing his pilot wheel forward or backward or by\r\nturning it like the steering wheel of an automobile. There was no\r\ndevice for balancing the aeroplane, but the construction kept it on\r\na fairly even keel--or, as the scientist said, it had inherent or\r\nautomatic stability--i. e., stability automatically gained from the\r\nconstruction of the machine. Also the operator was supposed to swing\r\nhis body from side to side to aid this. The aeroplane started from\r\nand alighted on four wheels set under the main plane and the tail.\r\nIt had 559 square feet of surface and with the engine weighed 1,100\r\npounds. The motor was a 50-horsepower Antoinette, which drove a\r\nsingle aluminum propeller.\r\n\r\nAfter preliminary \"bird hops\" at Issy-les-Mollineaux, Farman on\r\nOctober 26 beat Santos-Dumont's record by flying 771 metres. On\r\nJanuary 13, 1908, he won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Cup of 50,000 francs\r\nfor the first person to make a circular flight of 500 metres. Two\r\nmonths later Delagrange challenged Farman for his world championship,\r\nbut lost, Farman twice circling the two pylons, or marking poles,\r\nthat had been set up 500 metres apart, in 3 minutes 31 seconds. The\r\ndistance covered with turns was 2004.8 metres. Delagrange flew the\r\n500 metres in 2.5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time in the world's history two men rode in an\r\naeroplane, Delagrange taking his rival behind him and sailing over a\r\npart of the course. A month later Delagrange took the distance record\r\nfrom Farman with a flight of 5,575 metres in 9-1/4 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhile these pioneers were winning prizes and breaking records Louis\r\nBlériot was bringing his aeroplane to a successful stage. He had\r\nbeen working on the problem of aviation since 1900, but had failed\r\nwith wing flappers and machines like box kites. Finally he had some\r\nsuccess with a tandem monoplane like Professor Langley's. The first\r\nof his machines of this kind was smashed in a fall, but the second,\r\nBlériot's seventh flier, flew steadily and was the fastest aeroplane\r\never developed.\r\n\r\nThus Blériot at the opening of 1908 had developed his monoplane\r\nidea far past the stage Professor Langley ever had developed it. He\r\nhad increased the size of the forward plane and decreased the size\r\nof the rear plane until the great forward wings did all the work\r\nof sustaining the machine in the air, while the chief uses of the\r\ntail were steering and steadying the machine. Moreover, Blériot's\r\nwas the first machine among the practical European fliers to have a\r\nsystem of wing warping such as the Wright brothers had developed in\r\ntheir wonderful biplane, and such as Glenn Curtiss, another American\r\ninventor, was at the same time developing for his machines.\r\n\r\nThis gave Blériot what is called three-rudder control--that is, the\r\nvertical rudder at the rear to steer it from right to left, the\r\nhorizontal rudder, also on the tail, to steer it up or down, and\r\nthe flexible wing tips to keep it from tipping sidewise. The aspect\r\nratio of the early Blériots was low, which gave them greater speed.\r\nIn other words, the main plane did not have so great a spread as\r\nmost aeroplanes do, while it was much deeper, and, having less of\r\nan entering edge, it could go faster. There were three wheels--two\r\nunder the main plane and the third under the tail for starting and\r\nalighting. The engine was just under and at the front of the main\r\nplane, driving a single propeller. This propeller--which is the type\r\nmost used on monoplanes--is called a tractor propeller because,\r\ninstead of pushing the aeroplane forward from the rear, it pulls\r\nit from the front. The operator sat just to the rear and above the\r\nengine so he could look out and over the top of the main plane.\r\n\r\nThe last day of October, 1908, Blériot jumped into international\r\nfame with this machine by making a cross-country flight from Toury\r\nto Artenay, a total distance of about 17 miles. This was the second\r\ncross-country flight ever attempted. The day previous Farman had\r\nflown his biplane from Châlons to Rheims, nearly 17 miles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Wright brothers had been making great progress, as will\r\nbe seen shortly, and Wilbur Wright had brought a biplane to France to\r\nmake demonstrations for a French syndicate. He took up quarters at Le\r\nMans in August, 1908. His notable flights broke the world's records\r\nfor distance and duration. Early in the month he flew 52 miles and\r\nwas in the air 1 hour and 31 minutes. A few days later he broke the\r\nFrench records for altitude by going up 380 feet, and on the last day\r\nof the year won the Michelin prize of 20,000 francs for the longest\r\nflight of the year.\r\n\r\nIn January Wilbur Wright went to Pau, where he opened a school and\r\nwas joined by his brother Orville, who had just recovered from a\r\nhistorical accident in the United States which will be described\r\nshortly. At Pau they made a great many flights and exhibited their\r\naeroplane to thousands and thousands of people from all over the\r\nworld, including great scientists, military men, statesmen, and many\r\nmembers of the European nobility. Among these was young King Alfonso\r\nof Spain, who took such a delight in the machine that he would have\r\nmade an ascension were it not for the objections of his ministers.\r\nKing Edward of England also visited the famous brothers, talked with\r\nthem about their achievements, and witnessed several fine flights.\r\nThen Wilbur took his machine to Italy, where King Emanuel attended\r\nhis exhibitions in Rome. Later in London the two brothers were\r\nentertained by the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain and received\r\nits gold medal. During this time they won the respect of the whole\r\nworld of aviation.\r\n\r\n\"Now to return to the progress made by the intrepid American\r\ninventors in our own country, led by the Wright brothers, Glenn\r\nCurtiss, A. M. Herring, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, and his\r\nassociates, F. W. Baldwin and J. A. D. McCurdy,\" continued the boy's\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"You remember that toward the close of 1905 the Wright brothers\r\nsuspended their flights near Dayton because it had become necessary\r\nfor them to spend all their time in business negotiations. In the\r\nspring of 1908, after increasing the motor power of their flier,\r\nthey began tests again because the brothers had agreed to furnish a\r\nmachine to the United States Signal Corps and another to a French\r\nsyndicate.\"\r\n\r\nThe machine that was to be furnished to the Signal Corps, he\r\nexplained, had to be able to carry two men and to be able to fly for\r\none hour without stopping, at an average speed of 40 miles an hour.\r\nFurthermore, this flight had to be made across country dotted with\r\nhills, valleys, and forests. Another of the requirements was that the\r\nmachine should be able to fly 125 miles without stopping. The Wright\r\nbrothers agreed to furnish such an aeroplane for $25,000, and Orville\r\nWright went to Fort Myer, Va., near Washington, for the tests.\r\n\r\nHis preliminary flights were very successful and thousands of\r\nAmericans flocked to the drill ground to see what was practically the\r\nfirst public exhibition in the United States. About the time that the\r\nFrench aviators were making flights of 1 hour or so Orville Wright\r\nflew his machine for one hour and 3 minutes. Repeatedly he took\r\nLieut. Frank P. Lahm or Lieutenant Selfridge for short flights.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of September the tragic accident that put a stop to the\r\nflights occurred. Orville Wright was flying about 75 feet high with\r\nLieutenant Selfridge as a passenger when one of the propellers hit a\r\nstay wire which coiled about the blade, breaking it and making the\r\nmachine unmanageable. The aeroplane plunged to the ground, throwing\r\nthe occupants forward. Lieutenant Selfridge suffered injuries from\r\nwhich he died within three hours, while Wright suffered several\r\nbroken bones. This occurred while Wilbur Wright was at Le Mans,\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe year before Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the American inventor, had\r\ninvited Glenn Curtiss, a bicycle and motor manufacturer, to aid him\r\nin equipping with power the fliers that he was constructing with the\r\nhelp of Lieutenant Selfridge, F. W. Baldwin, and J. A. D. McCurdy.\r\nThey formed the Aerial Experiment Association, which later became\r\nfamous, and early in March, 1908, began the test of their first\r\naeroplane, which they called the _Red Wing_. The machine was tried\r\nover the ice of Lake Keuka, near Hammondsport, N. Y., and before its\r\nmakers were ready to fly it went into the air and sailed 300 feet.\r\nThe _Red Wing_ was of biplane type and mounted on skids, with the\r\npropeller and vertical direction rudder at the rear. The horizontal\r\nelevating rudder was at the front. The notable feature was the curve\r\nof the planes. The upper plane curved from the centre downward,\r\nwhile the lower plane curved from the centre upward, so that the two\r\nplanes, if they had been a little bit longer, would have met. This\r\ncurvature was expected to give automatic stability, but the machine\r\nwas never a great success.\r\n\r\nThe next machine made by these experimenters was called the _White\r\nWing_, and made some fair flights. The next was the famous _June Bug_\r\nwhich was designed by Curtiss and entered by him to contest for the\r\n_Scientific American_ Cup for a flight of one kilometre. The test,\r\nwhich was held on the 4th of July, 1908, near Hammondsport, was the\r\nfirst official flight for a prize in America, and was successful in\r\nevery way, winning the cup with a flight of 200 yards. This biplane\r\nhad the three-rudder control--that is, a tail at the rear shaped like\r\na box kite to steer it from right to left, two small parallel planes\r\nin front to steer it up or down, and a system of flexible wing tips\r\nwhich enabled the operator to maintain a side to side balance.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 Curtiss made some important improvements over his machine of\r\nprevious years by replacing the flexible wing tips with ailerons.\r\nThis was the first time these devices were used in this country, but\r\nthey had already been introduced in Europe on several machines. There\r\nare many kinds of ailerons, but on Curtiss's biplane they were two\r\nsmall horizontal planes fixed between the outer tips of the upper\r\nand lower planes. They could be turned so as to keep the aeroplane\r\nbalanced when making a sharp turn or when struck by a gust of wind.\r\n\r\nCurtiss and his partner, A. M. Herring, took the machine to the\r\nplains near Mineola, L. I., that summer, and began preliminary\r\nflights. They won several rich prizes, including that year's\r\n_Scientific American_ Cup for the longest flight of the season. In\r\nthis Curtiss made an official distance of 24-1/2 miles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Photograph by the American Press\r\n\r\n  THE GODDESS OF LIBERTY\r\n\r\n  Photographed from an aeroplane]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIRST ACTUAL WAR EXPEDITION OF AN AEROPLANE\r\n\r\n  This picture shows Rene Simon returning from his scouting trip\r\n  over the camp of the Mexican insurrectos, February 11, 1911.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WAR MANOEUVRES\r\n\r\n  American army aeroplane manoeuvring over the troops mobilized at\r\n  San Antonio, Texas, during the 1911 Mexican revolution.]\r\n\r\nWe will leave Mr. Curtiss and his associates for the time being and\r\ntake up again the work of the Wright brothers, who in the spring of\r\n1909 returned to the United States after their European triumphs.\r\nTheir laurels were further added to by a medal from the Aero Club of\r\nAmerica, presented by President Taft at the White House, and medals\r\nfrom the Federal Government, the state of Ohio, and their home town\r\nof Dayton. All this time they were busy making the aeroplane with\r\nwhich they were to resume the final tests for the Government that\r\nhad been interrupted the previous fall by the death of Lieutenant\r\nSelfridge. They arrived at Fort Myer in June, but spent most of that\r\nmonth and a large part of July in preparations and short practice\r\nflights. The great crowds, among which were scores of statesmen and\r\npoliticians, gathered in Washington, became impatient at the delays,\r\nbut the brothers had waited for a good many years to perfect their\r\nbiplane and would not risk failure by attempting the official tests\r\nin bad weather, with their plane out of tune, or their engine in bad\r\nworking order.\r\n\r\nFinally ten thousand cheering spectators were rewarded by seeing\r\nOrville Wright ascend with Lieutenant Lahm as a passenger, and sail\r\nfor 1 hour and 40 seconds, fulfilling the endurance requirements.\r\nThe next few days the weather prevented the distance test, but one\r\ncalm evening just before sunset Orville carried Lieut. B. D. Foulois\r\nacross hills and valleys to Alexandria and return at an average speed\r\nof 42.6 miles per hour. This won the brothers a bonus of $5,000 on\r\nthe price of the machine because they were to receive $2,500 extra\r\nfor each mile per hour more than the 40 miles per hour called for in\r\nthe contract. It was the greatest feat of aviation ever seen in the\r\nUnited States at the time and the ovation tendered the brothers was\r\nequal to the occasion. Not once, however, did they lose their heads\r\nin the slightest or show any undue enthusiasm over their achievement.\r\nStatesmen, army officers, and newspaper men crowded around with\r\ncongratulations and praises, but the great victory was only what the\r\nbrothers had expected and they soon were planning improvements on\r\ntheir biplane.\r\n\r\nThe real meaning of this feat by the Wright biplane, however, was\r\nthat the United States was the first nation officially to adopt an\r\naeroplane for military purposes. To Americans it seems peculiarly\r\nfitting that it was the Wright machine that was adopted because it\r\nwas the Wright aeroplane, strictly an American product, that was the\r\nfirst practical flier.\r\n\r\nLater on Wilbur returned to Fort Myer to finish off his contract by\r\nteaching two Signal Corps officers to handle the machine. During\r\nthis time the aviator changed his biplane by transferring one of the\r\nforward elevating planes to the rear, where it was used as a fixed\r\ntail to give greater stability from front to rear. This was such a\r\nsuccess that it was used in subsequent models, and the present-day\r\nWright biplanes have no forward lifting plane at all--the horizontal\r\nplane at the rear serving as the elevator and also as the fore and\r\naft balancer.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1909, after the Fort Myer tests, the brothers\r\nagain separated, Orville going to Europe, where he achieved more\r\ndistinction, and Wilbur remaining at home to astonish his countrymen\r\nwith his exhibitions at the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. He made the\r\nfirst trip around the Statue of Liberty on September 9, starting from\r\nand returning to Governor's Island in New York Bay.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the European aviators were making even greater\r\nstrides, and 1909 saw many new aeroplanes take the air to break\r\nrecords of different kinds. Throughout the season there was hardly a\r\nday that some record was not broken, or that some previously unknown\r\nman did not achieve undying fame for his daring feats.\r\n\r\nAeroplane schools were established and aviation passed from the stage\r\nof experimenting into the stage of record making and breaking.\r\n\r\nThe European governments, particularly France and Germany, were\r\ncarefully watching progress, and dozens of the pupils in the aviation\r\nschools were young officers detailed to learn the art of flying and\r\nreport on its usefulness in warfare. Also the building of aeroplanes\r\nbecame a great industry and in France thousands of scientists,\r\ndesigners, mechanics, motor experts, and wood-working experts were\r\nengaged in turning out machines as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible in this brief space to describe all of the\r\nimportant flights of the last few busy years in aviation, which were\r\ntalked of by the boy and his scientist friend, but a very brief\r\noutline of the feats accomplished will show the wonderful progress\r\nthat has been made. The first great international meet, which was\r\nheld at Rheims, France, in 1909, did more than anything else up to\r\nthat time to show the world how far the science had gone and how many\r\ngood machines there were. So great was the public interest in this\r\nmeet that before the end of the year meets were arranged and held\r\nat Blackpool and Donchester, England; Berlin, Juvisy, France, and\r\nBrescia, Italy. The most notable achievements of the year in Europe\r\nwere the flight across the English Channel by Blériot in his graceful\r\nmonoplane, by which he won the prize of 1,000 pounds offered by the\r\nLondon _Daily Mail_, the winning of the James Gordon Bennett Cup by\r\nCurtiss, the only American to contest for the great honour, and the\r\nwinning of the Grand Prix by Farman in his biplane. Blériot, while\r\npractising, before his famous flight across the English Channel,\r\nbroke many records with his monoplanes, No. XI and No. XII. He was\r\nthe first man to take two passengers in such a craft, those in the\r\nmachine besides himself being Santos-Dumont and A. Fournier. The\r\ntotal weight of machine and three men was 1,232 pounds. He also\r\nmade several cross-country records and received medals from the Aero\r\nClub of Great Britain and the Aero Club of France.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HARRY N. ATWOOD\r\n\r\n  Arriving at Chicago on his flight from St. Louis to New York.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE FINISH OF ATWOOD'S ST.

Throughout the meet at Garden City in 1911,\r\n  Earle L. Ovington and Beck carried mail over a regular route.]\r\n\r\nBlériot's flight over the English Channel was one of the most\r\ndramatic that ever has been made by an aviator, as he encountered\r\nperils that no birdman ever before had faced. He had as a contestant\r\none of the daring young aviators who has made the history of aviation\r\nread like a novel. This was Hubert Latham, who used the Antoinette\r\nmonoplane, one of the most beautiful machines ever designed, and\r\nwhich is described fully later on. Young Latham had become a popular\r\nhero because of his daring feats. The aviators said that he was\r\ncarrying on an endless battle with the wind, for he seemed to prefer\r\nflying high in the air when the wind was so gusty that other aviators\r\nwere afraid to leave their hangars. He had made several monoplane\r\nrecords for endurance and altitude, and after a notable cross-country\r\nflight announced his intention of sailing across the English Channel\r\nto collect the 1,000 pounds from the _Daily Mail_. So he took his\r\ngraceful monoplane to Calais, and after impatiently waiting for\r\nfair weather, soared from the towering cliffs and out over the\r\nstormy waters of the English Channel. Thousands cheered his daring\r\nand wished him success, but before he had gone more than six miles\r\nhis motor failed him and he glided to the water. In a few minutes\r\nthe boat that was sailing below him came up and found him calmly\r\nsitting on the upper framework of his machine, which was buoyed up\r\nby the great wings. He was looking as unconcerned as if he had been\r\nsitting in a motor boat on a lake, and declared he would try again\r\nthe next day. His machine was wrecked in getting it ashore, however,\r\nand Blériot made his famous flight before the young man could get it\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nThe older man had been injured in an accident and was still walking\r\non crutches, with a badly burned foot, when a favourable opportunity\r\nfor the trans-channel flight came. He was awakened before dawn on the\r\nmorning of July 25th, and, throwing away his crutches as he got into\r\nhis machine for a practise spin, he said: \"I will show the world that\r\nI can fly even if I cannot walk.\"\r\n\r\nAt 4:35, just as the sun was rising, he sailed out over the\r\nprecipice, and Latham, watching him, wept with disappointment at\r\nnot being able to enter the contest. A torpedo boat destroyer was\r\nfollowing him, but soon she dropped behind and he was over the\r\ntrackless channel without any landmark to guide him. Finally the\r\ncoast of France dropped out of sight and the intrepid aviator was\r\nalone, with nothing but his carefully planned monoplane between him\r\nand death in the tossing waters hundreds of feet below.\r\n\r\nAfter ten minutes of this the cliffs of the English coast loomed up\r\nahead, bathed in the early morning sunlight. He saw several boats far\r\nbelow him and followed their course, which brought him to the town\r\nof Deal, near which he landed. The first man to greet him was his\r\ngood friend M. Montaine, but soon after a crowd of Englishmen were\r\ncrowding about congratulating him on his wonderful achievement. Not\r\nto be outdone, young Latham cabled his congratulations.\r\n\r\nAugust saw the beginning of the first great international meet at\r\nRheims. Most of the leading aviators of the world gathered there\r\nto contest for the prizes and for fame. Curtiss, Blériot, Farman,\r\nLatham, Lefabre, Count de Lambert, Paul Tissandier, Louis Paulhan,\r\nLe Blanc, Roger Sommer, and Rougier all distinguished themselves and\r\nmade their names as familiar in this country as they were in France.\r\n\r\nLatham, with his apparently fearless disregard of danger, and\r\nhis great, soaring Antoinette monoplane that looked more like a\r\ndragon-fly when up in the air than anything else, was one of the\r\npopular idols. Not only did he fly in rough winds but also in heavy\r\nrainfall, as did his rival, Blériot. Of course there were several bad\r\naccidents, but none to compare with the later fatalities.\r\n\r\nThe winning of the $10,000 Grand Prix de la Champagne for the longest\r\nflight was not so spectacular as the next day's great race. Latham\r\nhad made a record of 96 miles that it was thought would stand. On\r\nthe day of the finals, Friday, August 27th, Latham again took the\r\nair, making a spectacular flight several hundred feet high. At the\r\nsame time several others were performing evolutions in the air, some\r\nhigh and some low. Farman was flying close to the ground and making\r\nbut poor time in his slower craft. Finally, after all the others had\r\ncome to earth, the longest flight having been made by Latham, with\r\n68 miles to his credit, the crowd realized that Farman was making a\r\nrecord. Time after time he passed the grand stand, marking off the\r\nmiles. It became dark, but the crowd still lingered, and was rewarded\r\nfinally by seeing him bring his machine softly to the ground in front\r\nof the judges' stand, winner of the $10,000, with a record of 190\r\nkilometres. His friends, wild with joy, pulled the exhausted aviator\r\nfrom his seat and carried him off the field on their shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe next day Curtiss, the only American taking part in the meet\r\n(although several Wright biplanes were flown by Frenchmen), brought\r\nout his 60-horsepower biplane to try for the speed prize of $5,000\r\noffered by James Gordon Bennett. He made two rounds of the field at\r\na speed of 47.04 miles an hour. Blériot then brought out his great\r\n80-horsepower monoplane, but the test flights were discouraging.\r\nFinally, after working over his machine all afternoon and trying\r\nseveral propellers, he started at five o'clock and made his first\r\nround in much better time than Curtiss had done. He slackened up on\r\nthe second round, however, and came to earth to find that he had lost\r\nto the gallant American. By winning the prize Curtiss was allowed to\r\ntake the next year's contest to his own country.\r\n\r\nThere were many other records broken at the other meets held in\r\n1909, but none of them stood long after the 1910 season had got well\r\nunder way. Altitude, endurance, distance and speed records all were\r\nshattered by the ever-increasing army of aviators and the constantly\r\nimproving machines.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most spectacular and daring feat of 1910 was the\r\nflight across the Alps by George Chavez, who was born in Paris of\r\nPeruvian parents only twenty-three years before his tragic death. In\r\nSeptember of that year he set out to win the prize of 70,000 francs\r\noffered by the Italian Aviation Society to the first aviator who\r\nwould fly the 75 miles from Brig to Milan, across the towering peaks\r\nand yawning chasms of the Alps. Of the five who entered the contest\r\nChavez was the only one to make a real start. After waiting for\r\nseveral days, during which wind, rain and fog kept him chained to the\r\nground, he finally rose in the air.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he was 7,000 feet above sea level, crossing the\r\nfamous Simplon Pass, braving the fierce eddies of wind that swirled\r\naround the cruel, jagged crags and precipices. Finally he crossed\r\nthe mountains and glided down the Italian slope to Domodossola.\r\nThousands had gathered to greet his arrival, but as he was sinking\r\ngradually to the earth, only thirty feet above the ground, a gust of\r\nwind caught the machine, the wings collapsed and the brave young man\r\nfell to earth underneath the machinery. He received injuries from\r\nwhich he died four days later. The committee granted him one third of\r\nthe prize on the basis that he had completed the difficult part of\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nNo less dangerous was Glenn Curtiss's trip from Albany to New York\r\nin his biplane, by which he won the $10,000 prize offered by the New\r\nYork _World_. Most of his route lay over wooded hills, the waters of\r\nthe Hudson River, or the cliffs along its banks, which territory,\r\nas any one who has travelled from New York to Albany knows, offers\r\nfew landing places. Starting with a letter from the Mayor of Albany\r\nto the Mayor of New York and followed by a special train on the New\r\nYork Central he made Camelot, 41 miles from Albany, in about an hour.\r\nThe next jump was clear to Spuyten Duyvil, the northern boundary of\r\nManhattan, which completed the required 128 miles in a total elapsed\r\ntime of 2 hours and 32 minutes. His average speed was 50-1/2 miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThis stage of the journey nearly brought serious disaster to the\r\naviator, for, while passing the famous old mountain Storm King, he\r\nwas caught by a terrific gust of wind and his machine was twisted\r\nsideways so that it dropped suddenly toward the river. By skilful\r\nmanipulation he righted his biplane and continued.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause at Spuyten Duyvil he sailed down the Hudson River\r\nand the upper New York Bay to Governor's Island. Every whistle in\r\nthe harbour, a few million people and the reporters representing\r\nthe newspaper readers of the whole civilized world, proclaimed his\r\nvictory over the wind gusts eddying around the palisades and the New\r\nYork skyscrapers.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there were many aviators besides Curtiss who\r\nwere making an effort to win long distance prizes. The New York\r\n_Times_ and the Philadelphia _Ledger_ had offered a large purse,\r\nsupposed to be $10,000, for the first flight from New York to\r\nPhiladelphia, and on June 13th, a few days after Glenn Curtiss's\r\nflight from Albany to New York, Charles K. Hamilton, another young\r\nman new to aviation, sailed in his Curtiss biplane the 86 miles from\r\nGovernor's Island to Philadelphia in 1 hour and 43 minutes, and\r\nreturned the same day. His average speed was 50-1/2 miles an hour,\r\nthe same maintained by Curtiss in his Albany-New York trip. These two\r\nflights added tremendously to the fame of the Curtiss machines.\r\n\r\nThe great International Aviation Tournament of 1910, held at Belmont\r\nPark in October, was the climax of the season in this country. Of\r\ncourse interest centred around the race for the James Gordon Bennett\r\nCup and prize of $5,000, which had been won the year before at Rheims\r\nby Curtiss. The total prizes amounted to $60,000 and practically\r\nevery standard make of aeroplane was represented. The American\r\naviators came into prominence at this meet, as will be remembered\r\nby the feats of Walter Brookins, Arch. Hoxsey, Ralph Johnstone, J.\r\nA. Drexel and a dozen others. The English contingent was led by\r\nClaude Grahame-White, who had been making himself famous at the\r\nHarvard-Boston meet. Of the Frenchmen, Alfred LeBlanc, Hubert Latham,\r\nEmiel Aubrun and Count de Lesseps were among the leaders.\r\n\r\nNearly every one nowadays is familiar with the story of how\r\nGrahame-White brought out his 100-horsepower Blériot monoplane for\r\nits first trial and made 100 kilometres at an average speed of\r\n61 miles an hour. Soon after that LeBlanc came out with another\r\n100-horsepower Blériot, acknowledged to be one of the swiftest\r\nmachines ever made at that time, and started on a race around the\r\ncourse at a speed such as the world had never seen before. In the\r\nlast lap his gasoline gave out, the aeroplane shot downward and\r\nwas smashed against a telephone pole. LeBlanc was more angry than\r\ninjured, because he had lost the race, although his speed had been 67\r\nmiles an hour, or six miles better than Grahame-White's. Brookins,\r\nwith the Wright biplane racing machine, started out with high speed,\r\nbut the engine soon began to miss fire and he too came to earth.\r\nConsequently Grahame-White carried off the prize.\r\n\r\nThe next day the aviators were out to contest for the $10,000 offered\r\nby Thomas F. Ryan for the quickest flight from the aviation field\r\nto the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour, 16 miles away, and\r\nreturn. Never before was there such a dramatic race. Together Count\r\nde Lesseps and Claude Grahame-White, both in Blériot machines,\r\nstarted for the Statue. John Moisant, the American aviator, who only\r\nthat summer had made the first flight from Paris to London, suddenly\r\ndetermined to win the prize. It took him about five minutes to buy\r\nLeBlanc's 50-horsepower Blériot monoplane for $10,000, and just\r\nas Grahame-White and de Lesseps were returning from their flight\r\nMoisant started out. Instead of taking the safer roundabout course,\r\nwhere there were many landing places, this dauntless birdman sailed\r\ndirectly over the church steeples of Brooklyn, cutting through the\r\ntreacherous air currents at terrific speed, circling the Statue at\r\ngreat altitude and returning by the same route. His time was 43\r\nseconds better than that of Grahame-White, who flew a machine of\r\ndouble the power. The Americans were wild with delight, thinking\r\nMoisant had won the prize, but the committee finally gave the award\r\nto Count de Lesseps, who made the slowest time, because Grahame-White\r\nhad fouled the starting post, or pylon, as it is called by aviators,\r\nand because Moisant in his desperation to get started had failed to\r\nqualify.\r\n\r\nBut there were other records broken. Ralph Johnstone, flying the\r\nsmall Wright biplane racer, which was equipped with particularly\r\nlarge propellers, broke the altitude record of 9,104 feet which had\r\nbeen set in France by climbing to an altitude of 9,714 feet. The\r\nround trip to and from the clouds took him 1 hour and 43 minutes.\r\nIn connection with the altitude trials, the daring of Johnstone and\r\nHoxsey was particularly notable. Both of these aviators took up their\r\nWright biplanes when the wind was blowing so fiercely that they could\r\nhardly turn the pylons. When they got to a great altitude, one time\r\nthe gale was so terrific that they were carried backward at a speed\r\nof nearly 40 miles an hour, and both of them had to land in open\r\ncountry; Johnstone at Holtsville, L. I., 55 miles away, and Hoxsey at\r\nBrentwood, half that distance. During these flights both of them had\r\nreached altitudes of more than a mile in the air. But these records\r\nwere not destined to stand long, as will be shown by the table on\r\npage 75.\r\n\r\nBut world's distance and altitude records were being broken in\r\nEurope, too, and during the summer of 1910 the record keepers were\r\nbusy putting new names at the heads of their lists, as will be shown\r\nby the table on page 76. The long distance speed race, called the\r\n\"Circuit de l'Est,\" which took in a course 488 miles long, of six\r\ntowns around Paris, aroused as much enthusiasm as any. The prize\r\nwhich was offered by the newspaper _Le Matin_ of Paris was for\r\n100,000 francs. The race started on August 7, with eight contestants,\r\nand ended on August 17 with Alfred LeBlanc, in his Blériot monoplane,\r\nthe winner. He had made the distance in six stages at an average\r\nspeed of 40 miles an hour, flying through rain, fog and wind. Next\r\ncame Aubrun in a Blériot and Weyman in a Farman. Not only was this\r\nrace one of the severest tests that the aeroplane had ever had, but\r\nalso it was a trial to the aviators that did a great deal to prove\r\nthe practicability of the aeroplanes for more serious work than\r\npleasant day sport.\r\n\r\nALTITUDE FLIGHTS IN 1910[A]\r\n\r\n    ================================================\r\n      AVIATOR    | ALTITUDE  |     AEROPLANE       |\r\n    -------------+-----------+---------------------+\r\n    Paulhan      | 4,164 feet| Farman biplane      |\r\n    Olieslaegers | 4,490  \"  | Blériot monoplane   |\r\n    Brookins     | 4,503  \"  | Wright biplane      |\r\n    Latham       | 4,658  \"  | Antoinette monoplane|\r\n    Chavez       | 5,850  \"  | Blériot monoplane   |\r\n    Morane       | 6,691  \"  | Blériot monoplane   |\r\n    Morane       | 8,469  \"  | Blériot monoplane   |\r\n    Chavez       | 8,790  \"  | Blériot monoplane   |\r\n    Drexel, A.   | 9,450  \"  | Blériot monoplane   |\r\n    Johnstone    | 9,714  \"  | Wright biplane      |\r\n    Legagneux    |10,746  \"  | Blériot monoplane   |\r\n    Hoxsey, A.   |11,476  \"  | Wright biplane      |\r\n    -------------+-----------+---------------------+\r\n\r\n    ===========================================\r\n      AVIATOR    |    PLACE     |     DATE\r\n    -------------+--------------+--------------\r\n    Paulhan      | Los Angeles  |Jan.  12, 1910\r\n    Olieslaegers | Brussels     |July  30,  \"\r\n    Brookins     | Indianapolis |July  16,  \"\r\n    Latham       | Rheims       |July   7,  \"\r\n    Chavez       | Blackpool    |Aug.   3,  \"\r\n    Morane       | Havre        |Aug.  29,  \"\r\n    Morane       | Havre        |Sept.  2,  \"\r\n    Chavez       | Issy, Paris  |Sept.  8,  \"\r\n    Drexel, A.   | Philadelphia |Oct.  31,  \"\r\n    Johnstone    | Belmont Park |Nov.  23,  \"\r\n    Legagneux    | Pau          |Dec.   9,  \"\r\n    Hoxsey, A.   | Los Angeles  |Dec.  26,  \"\r\n    -------------+--------------+--------------\r\n\r\n  [A] These records were broken in 1911 and 1912.

This was one of the most exciting contests of the year, not\r\nonly because of the difficulties of the trip, but also because of the\r\nnip and tuck finish between the two contestants.\r\n\r\nClaude Grahame-White had just purchased a Farman biplane, and hearing\r\nthat Paulhan was hurrying across the Atlantic from the United States\r\nto try for the prize himself, the Englishman announced that he would\r\nstart as soon as his machine could be set up. He had had but little\r\nexperience with the biplane, as always before that time he had used a\r\nBlériot, but nevertheless, in spite of the advice of his friends to\r\nwait, Grahame-White started on the 183-mile flight on the morning of\r\nApril 23d in the teeth of a high wind. According to Grahame-White's\r\nown account of the flight he was buffeted about so unmercifully by\r\nthe wind that several times he thought he would have to descend. At\r\nthe same time the cold was so intense that he suffered agonies. He\r\nreached his first stop at Rugby in safety, though so cold he had to\r\nbe lifted from his seat, but soon after taking the air again the gale\r\nrose to such a pitch that he was forced to land. He went to a hotel\r\nto rest and wait for the wind to abate, but while there the gale\r\ntipped over his biplane, smashing it so badly that the aviator had to\r\ngive up and take his machine back to London practically to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Paulhan had reached England and was rushing his workmen\r\nnight and day to get his aeroplane set up before Grahame-White could\r\ncomplete his repairs and make a fresh start.\r\n\r\nFinally, with the wind still blowing a gale, Paulhan started for\r\nManchester. Grahame-White heard of this at 6:30 in the evening, but\r\nmanfully started after his competitor and flew 60 miles, when he\r\nwas finally forced to land in the dark. Determined to remain in the\r\nrace, he started again about three o'clock in the morning with the\r\nintention of trying to catch up with the daring Frenchman. Besides\r\nthe bitter cold, it was so dark that the Englishman could not see\r\nwhether he was flying high or low or even toward Manchester. The\r\ndanger of this kind of flying he knew was very great, because if his\r\nengine failed him he would have had to come to earth anywhere he\r\nhappened to light, as likely on a church steeple or in a lake as on\r\na level spot. Of this famous flight Grahame-White wrote in his book,\r\n\"The Story of the Aeroplane\":\r\n\r\n   \"My start was really something in the nature of a confused\r\n   jumble. Faint lights swept away on either side as my machine\r\n   moved across the ground. I could not judge my ascent at all, on\r\n   account of the darkness. But I elevated as quickly as possible,\r\n   and got away from the ground smartly.\r\n\r\n   \"Directly I was at a respectable height, I could see the lights\r\n   of the railway station very distinctly. I headed toward them.\r\n   Looking directly down, I found that I could distinguish nothing\r\n   on the ground below me. It was all a black smudge. I flew right\r\n   over the lights of the railway station--and as I was doing so my\r\n   engine began to miss fire. It was certainly a very uncomfortable\r\n   moment--one of the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced.\r\n\r\n   \"But, very fortunately for me, after a momentary spluttering,\r\n   the engine picked up again, and fired properly. I had begun to\r\n   sink toward the ground, upon which I knew I could have picked\r\n   out no landing place in the darkness. As soon as my engine began\r\n   to do its work again, however, I rose and continued my flight\r\n   smoothly.\"\r\n\r\nWith the dawn came a terrific wind which forced the aviator to land\r\nnear Polesworth. While waiting for the wind to abate the Englishman\r\nand his friends heard Paulhan had reached Manchester and won the\r\nprize.\r\n\r\nOf Paulhan's famous flight, one of the men who was aboard the special\r\ntrain following Paulhan, according to Mr. Grahame-White, said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I have ever seen a machine roll about in the air as\r\nhis did. He was, we could see, incessantly at work. One wind gust\r\nafter another struck the machine and it literally reeled under the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n\"Up and down it went, and from side to side. Paulhan's pluck and\r\ndetermination were remarkable. I do not think that any other man\r\ncould have kept on with such determination as he displayed. It was a\r\nstrange thing to see how the wind got worse and worse as the airman\r\nflew on.\"\r\n\r\nBut these feats that startled the world in 1910 would not cause a\r\nripple of enthusiasm now, since the North American Continent has been\r\ncrossed by aeroplane; since the trip from Boston to Washington and\r\nfrom St. Louis to New York has been made; since a machine has stayed\r\nin the air a whole day, or more than eight and a half hours, since a\r\ndozen passengers have been carried half a dozen miles and since the\r\ndevelopment of the hydro-aeroplane.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Copyright, by Brown Brothers, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  CHAVEZ ON HIS FATAL FLIGHT ACROSS THE ALPS]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE LATE CALBRAITH P. RODGERS, TRANS-CONTINENTAL\r\n  FLIER\r\n\r\n  This picture was taken just after Rodgers had picked himself up\r\n  after one of the many smash-ups of his aeroplane during his ocean\r\n  to ocean flight.]\r\n\r\nOf course it hasn't all been the winning of prizes and the cheering\r\nof crowds, for, as we all know, there has been a tragic side to\r\naviation. Up to the summer of 1912 more than 150 persons had met\r\ndeath in aeroplane accidents. To analyze all these accidents would\r\nrequire a whole book, but experts agree that in a great many cases\r\nthey were the result of carelessness on the part of the pilot. Of\r\ncourse there were other causes, such as the collapse of the wings,\r\nthe breaking of stays, the overturning by wind gusts, \"holes in\r\nthe air,\" the explosion of the motor, the failure of the motor at\r\na critical time, or the collapse of the aviator, but authorities\r\ndeclare that many of these can be prevented by the use of proper care\r\nby the designers, manufacturers, and pilots of the air vehicles.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most tragic of the recent air fatalities were the deaths\r\nof Arch. Hoxsey and Rodgers at Los Angeles, the former in December,\r\n1910, and the latter in April, 1912. Hoxsey had just set a world's\r\nrecord for altitude in his Wright biplane, while Rodgers only a few\r\nmonths before his death had completed a transcontinental flight and\r\nmade a world's record.\r\n\r\nSeveral women aviators also were killed in 1912, including Miss\r\nHarriet Quimby, one of the first American women to take up flying.\r\nMiss Quimby's machine fell with her in Boston while she was making an\r\nexhibition flight.\r\n\r\nThe 1911 death roll of American aviators included: Lieutenant Kelly,\r\nU. S. A.; A. Hartle, Los Angeles; Kreamer, Badger and Johnstone,\r\nChicago; Frisbie, Norton, Kan.; Castellana, Mansfield, Pa.; Miller,\r\nTroy, Ohio; Clarke, Garden City, N. Y.; Dixon, Spokane, Wash.; Ely,\r\nMacon, Ga.; and Professor Montgomery, Santa Clara, Cal., whose early\r\nexperiments are held in such high esteem by scientists.\r\n\r\nJust as 1910 was the year for record-breaking aeroplane contests,\r\n1911 was the year that proved the aeroplane a machine with a greater\r\nand more important use than that of a very exciting and a very\r\nexpensive sport. Probably the most astounding developments in the\r\nworld of aviation in 1911 were the experiments of the Wright brothers\r\nat Kitty Hawk, which showed that man has come very near to solving\r\nthe problem of true soaring flight. We will look more closely at the\r\nexperiments in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nOf much greater practical use was the development of the\r\nhydro-aeroplane by Glenn Curtiss. His lead in this was quickly\r\nfollowed by the Wrights and most of the European makers.\r\n\r\nThe year 1911 saw the aeroplane employed for the first time in the\r\nworld's history in actual warfare. When the revolution was raging in\r\nMexico in February, 1911, the Diaz Army sent Rene Simon in a Blériot\r\nmonoplane to make a scouting trip over the camp of the insurrectos.\r\nA little later on Lieutenant Foulois of the American Signal Service,\r\nwhose name will be remembered in connection with the Fort Myer\r\nexperiments, sailed over and about the camp of the mobilized American\r\nArmy at San Antonio, Texas, while the Mexican revolution was in\r\nprogress just across the American boundary line.\r\n\r\nNext came the use of the aeroplane for scouting by the Italian Army\r\nin its invasion of Tripoli. All of these expeditions showed that the\r\naeroplane can be used more successfully in war for scouting than\r\nas a means for dropping explosives. Of course there have been many\r\nexperiments conducted by aviators in dropping paper bombs, but army\r\nofficers both in the United States and abroad are not agreed as to\r\nthe success of such projects.\r\n\r\nAnother of the important military experiments has been the equipping\r\nof aeroplanes with wireless apparatus so that a wireless operator in\r\nthe machine with the aviator could send and receive brief messages\r\nsuch as would describe the position and strength of an enemy in war\r\ntime. Also many aviators have taken up with them photographers who\r\nhave taken accurate photographs of both the still and motion variety\r\nof the country over which they were passing. Of course the armies of\r\nthe world are building guns which will carry to a great altitude as a\r\ndefence from aerial attack.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first country to adopt aeroplanes for use by its\r\narmy, the United States is now far behind other nations in its\r\naviation squads. The United States Signal Corps owns only a few\r\nWright and Curtiss biplanes, with only a small number of officers\r\nwho know how to fly them. France has an extensive fleet of several\r\nhundred aeroplanes and a small army of aviators, while Germany has\r\nestablished a school for aviation where sixty or seventy officers are\r\nalways being instructed in flying the various types of machines.\r\nThe German Army has now more than one hundred aeroplanes, besides\r\nmany dirigible balloons. The British Government has not gone so\r\nfar, but has conducted some interesting experiments in which Claude\r\nGrahame-White was one of the leaders.\r\n\r\nThe latest things in the aeroplane, however, are always expected to\r\nbe brought out at the French Army tests, and several machines that\r\nwere first exhibited in this way will be described a little later on.\r\n\r\nBut not only in war is the aeroplane being developed, but also in\r\nthe greater work of peace, because the aeroplane enthusiasts expect\r\nthat in the near future the art will be developed to such a degree of\r\nsafety that regular systems of passenger traffic can be installed.\r\nBesides this, the aeroplane is the fastest mode of travelling now\r\nknown, and it may be used for the carrying of mail. It was only in\r\nthe summer of 1911 that the first aeroplane mail route of the United\r\nStates was established between the aviation field in Garden City, L.\r\nI., and the United States post-office at Mineola, several miles away.\r\nDaily throughout the meet at Garden City Captain Beck and Earle L.\r\nOvington carried a sack of officially stamped and sealed mail from\r\nthe post-office on the field to the postal station at Mineola. The\r\nfirst sack was handed to Beck by Postmaster-General Hitchcock. Before\r\nthis, mail had been carried by aeroplane in England, but not on a\r\nregularly established route.\r\n\r\nAlso the aeroplane has been pressed into service by deputy sheriffs\r\nseeking criminals and by searching parties hunting for lost persons.\r\nThe former was done in Los Angeles when a gang of desperadoes escaped\r\ninto the California desert and an aeroplane soared over the sagebrush\r\nin an effort to locate them, while the latter was done near New\r\nYork after duck hunters had got lost in a storm on great South Bay,\r\nand near New Orleans when an aviation student skimmed over Lake\r\nPontchartrain and located the body of a man drowned there.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the useful developments of the aeroplane. Of course\r\nthere have been many spectacular achievements such as the trip of\r\nCalbraith P. Rodgers, a comparatively inexperienced aviator, from\r\nSheepshead Bay, N. Y., to Long Beach, Cal., across the whole American\r\ncontinent; the trips of Harry N. Atwood from Boston to Washington and\r\nfrom St. Louis to New York via Chicago, Buffalo and Albany; the trip\r\nof Vedrines from Paris to Madrid, across the Pyrenees Mountains, and\r\nthe terrific speed of about 155 miles an hour, or more than two and a\r\nhalf miles a minute, maintained by Vedrines for eighty miles. Just to\r\nthink of such a speed would take the ordinary person's breath away,\r\nbut the aviators speak of it calmly and say it won't be long before\r\nit will be a common thing for aeroplanes to make a speed of 200\r\nmiles an hour, about twice as fast as the fastest automobile has ever\r\nburned up the road. Then, too, there was the winning of the James\r\nGordon Bennett Cup and prize in England by C. F. Weyman, an American\r\nwho flew a Nieuport monoplane equipped with a 100-horsepower Gnome\r\nmotor. It would be impossible in our space to give a list of the\r\ncontests, races, circuit races and endurance tests of the year. Not\r\nonly were aeroplanes seen in the United States, but they were flown\r\nin South America, Africa, Australia, Japan, India and China. The\r\nSphinx in the Great Sahara Desert, the Panama Canal, Niagara Falls,\r\nthe Chinese Wall, the Far Eastern temples to Buddha, and the Islands\r\nof the Antipodes all have been circled by the dauntless birdmen, as\r\nwell as the Goddess of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nYoung Atwood started from Boston without much ado on June 30, 1911,\r\nsailed 93 miles to New London, Conn., and the day following reeled\r\noff the 112 miles to New York as easily as he would walk across the\r\nstreet. The Fourth of July he went to Atlantic City; July 10th he\r\nsailed from there to Baltimore, a distance of 122 miles, which was\r\nmade in four hours and a half; and the day after that finished up by\r\nsailing into Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nThis young aviator still was not satisfied and shipped his aeroplane\r\nto St. Louis, from where on August 14th he started for New York. His\r\nlongest single flight was made from St. Louis to Chicago, 283 miles\r\nin 6 hours and 32 minutes. Flying an average distance of 105-1/2\r\nmiles a day for the remaining eleven days, he completed the 1,266\r\nmiles on August 25th. His total flying time was 28 hours and 53\r\nminutes, and his average speed 43.9 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nFar more exciting was the record-breaking flight of the ill-fated\r\nRodgers from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He had a number of severe\r\nfalls, but his determination carried him through in spite of\r\neverything. His machine was a specially constructed Wright biplane\r\nmodel Ex, something of a mixture between the regular racing and\r\npassenger carrying types. Starting from Sheepshead Bay, N. Y., on\r\nSeptember 17th, the young giant, who had only learned to fly that\r\nsummer, was off on the longest trip ever attempted by a birdman.\r\nAfter being on the go for forty-nine days, he sailed over the coast\r\ntowns to Long Beach on the Pacific Ocean. He was actually in the air\r\nthe equivalent of 3 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes; made an average speed\r\nof 51 miles an hour, and his longest single flight was from Sanderson\r\nto Sierra Blanca, Texas, on October 28th, a distance of 231 miles. He\r\ncrossed three ranges of mountains, two deserts and the continental\r\nplain; he wrecked and rebuilt his machine four times and replaced\r\nsome parts of it eight times; he rode through darkness and wind and\r\nrain and lightning, at the heart of a thunder cloud. Once his engine\r\nblew up while he was 4,000 feet high and he had to glide to earth.\r\nA special train with duplicate parts, a complete repair-shop, and\r\nmechanics followed as he winged his way up the Hudson across New York\r\nState, across the plains of the Middle West, down through Kansas,\r\nOklahoma and Texas, across the Arizona and California deserts, over\r\nthe Pacific range, and finally to the western ocean. His worst\r\naccident came at Compton, Cal., on the last stage of his journey,\r\nwhen he was so badly injured that he was laid up twenty-eight days.\r\nThis occurred on November 12th, but, persevering to the end, Rodgers\r\narose as soon as he was able and sailed to the ocean on December 10th.\r\n\r\nRodgers remained in California the rest of the winter, giving many\r\nexhibitions of his daring and skill, only to meet his death while\r\nholding the world's record. On April 3, 1912, while 7,000 persons at\r\nLong Beach, near Los Angeles, watched his evolutions, his machine\r\ntipped forward. The crowd cheered, thinking it a daring dive, but\r\nbecame silent when they saw the aviator had lost control. From a\r\nheight of 200 feet the biplane plunged into the surf where the\r\nwater was only two feet deep. When the people reached the broken\r\nmachine Rodgers was dead--his neck broken. There was nothing to\r\nshow the cause of the biplane's dive. The spot where Rodgers was\r\nkilled is only a few yards from the one where he completed his\r\ntranscontinental flight, and where the citizens of Los Angeles\r\nplanned to erect a monument to his achievement.\r\n\r\nMost boys are perfectly familiar with the important events of 1912\r\nin aviation, which the scientist and his young friend talked over so\r\neagerly, for, of course, the papers are full of them, and aviation\r\nmeets are a common thing now in nearly every city of the country.\r\n\r\nThe development of the hydro-aeroplane was probably the chief work of\r\nthe inventors for the year, but with it came many devices designed\r\nto prevent the appalling loss of life while the art of flying is\r\nbeing perfected. One of them is a parachute fixed to the top of the\r\nplane, which the aviator is supposed to open in case his machine gets\r\nbeyond control. In tests aviators have descended to earth in these\r\nparachutes without injury. Also a number of automatic balancing and\r\nstabilizing devices have been brought out.\r\n\r\nFrank Coffyn's feats in and about New York Bay during the winter of\r\n1912 with his Wright hydro-aeroplane gave that city the best idea of\r\nthe success of the aeroplane in and over water it had ever had. He\r\nflew from and alighted on the water and great ice floes in the bay as\r\neasily as aviators would fly from a clear landing ground on a calm\r\nday. It was from Coffyn's machine that the picture of the Statue of\r\nLiberty was taken.\r\n\r\nThe world saw the first hydro-aeroplane meet in March of 1911 off the\r\ncoast of the little European principality of Monaco. Seven aviators\r\ncompeted for the rich prizes, and, although the Maurice Farman\r\nmachine won the greatest number of points, the Curtiss hydros showed\r\nthe greatest speed, and alighted with perfect ease in breakers four\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nFar more important than the winning of prize contests is the latest\r\nachievement of Glen Curtiss in perfecting his \"flying boat,\" pictures\r\nof which are shown opposite page 23. Curtiss describes this aeroplane\r\nas a combination between a speed motor boat, a yacht and a flying\r\nmachine. Speaking of the new plane, he said recently: \"With this\r\ncraft the dangers common to land aeroplanes are eliminated and safe\r\nflying is here. It will develop a new and popular sport which will be\r\nknown as aerial yachting.\" The most important factor in this machine\r\nis its safety, but it also is speedy, for in its official tests at\r\nHammondsport it developed 50 miles an hour as a motor boat and 60\r\nmiles an hour as an aeroplane. The boat is 26 feet long and 3 feet\r\nwide. The planes are 30 feet wide and 5-1/2 feet deep. The rudders\r\nare attached to the rear; the propeller, driven by an 80-horsepower\r\nmotor, is at the front.\r\n\r\nBefore we go on to other inventions let us look closely at a few of\r\nthe aeroplanes so well known to-day, so that when we see them at the\r\nmeets we can distinguish the different makes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAEROPLANES TO-DAY\r\n\r\n   OUR BOY FRIEND AND THE SCIENTIST LOOK OVER MODERN AEROPLANES AND\r\n   FIND GREAT IMPROVEMENTS OVER THOSE OF A FEW YEARS AGO--A MODEL\r\n   AEROPLANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery effort of the aeroplane inventors these days is bent toward\r\nmaking the power flier useful--a faithful servant to man in his\r\nday-to-day life--and to this end greater carrying capacity is one\r\nof the chief objects,\" said the scientist one day in answer to a\r\nquestion from his young friend as to what the future of aviation\r\nwould be.\r\n\r\n\"No one can tell what the future will bring forth,\" he continued.\r\n\"You or one of your friends might invent the ideal aeroplane. There\r\nis one way of telling how the wind blows, though, and that is by\r\nwatching the new developments of aeroplanes very carefully. Let's\r\nlook at some of them.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it was impossible for the boy to study every improvement or\r\nevery make of aeroplane, but the scientist pointed out a few examples\r\nthat served to show how science is trying to improve on aviation as\r\nwe know it to-day.\r\n\r\nThe boy's friend said that probably the most wonderful accomplishment\r\nin the art of air navigation since power fliers became an\r\naccomplished fact was the work of Orville Wright in the fall of 1911\r\nwith his new glider, which he tested at the Wright brothers' old\r\nexperiment station at Kitty Hawk, N. C.\r\n\r\n\"Never before in the history of aviation, so far as is known,\" said\r\nthe scientist, \"has man come so near to the true soaring flight which\r\nwe have seen is the third stage of aeroplaning.\"\r\n\r\nNot only did this wonderful glider sail into the wind and reach an\r\naltitude of 200 feet, but, under the control of the pilot, it stayed\r\nin the air 10 minutes and 1 second, most of the time hovering over\r\none spot, without the use of any propelling device.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the great test the glider was taken to the top of Kill\r\nDevil Hill, which is 110 feet high, and while the wind was roaring\r\nthrough the canvas at 42 miles an hour the machine was launched. To\r\nthose unaccustomed to the actions of gliders it would have seemed\r\nthat the engineless biplane would be blown backward over the edge of\r\nthe hill. Instead, it shot forward and upward into the teeth of the\r\nhurricane. The force of the wind on the planes, which were presented\r\ndiagonally to it, caused the flier to rise and go ahead by just about\r\nthe same principle that a ship can sail almost into the teeth of the\r\nwind by having her sails set at the proper angle.\r\n\r\nWhen it had reached the altitude of 200 feet it stopped motionless\r\nand to those below who saw Orville Wright sitting calmly in the\r\npilot's seat it seemed that some unseen hand was holding him aloft.\r\nSuddenly the pilot pressed a lever and the glider darted 250 feet to\r\nthe left, returned to her original position, sank to within a few\r\nfeet of the hillside and hovered there for two minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Wrights had been working on the principles involved for a long\r\ntime and at the testing grounds were Orville Wright, his brother\r\nLoren, who up to that time had not been known to the world of\r\naviation, and Alexander Ogilvy, an English aviator.\r\n\r\nAfter the remarkable test Orville Wright was asked, \"Have you solved\r\nreal bird flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied, \"but we have learned something about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe aviator went on to explain that had he been up 3,000 feet or so,\r\nwhere the wind currents are always strong, he probably could have\r\nstayed up there all night, or as long as he cared to.\r\n\r\nThis greatest of all feats of soaring was accomplished in a glider\r\nthat looked to the ordinary person very much like the modern Wright\r\nbiplane without the engine. There were skids but they were very low.\r\nIn general outline the machine was composed of two main planes, a\r\nvertical vane set out in front, two vertical planes at the rear\r\nof the tail, and behind these the horizontal plane. The details of\r\nthe construction of the glider were not made public and only a few\r\npersons saw it, but from all accounts the curve of the main planes\r\nwas much greater than is usual, thus gaining the glider a greater\r\ndegree of support from the air, and the planes were capable of being\r\nwarped much more than in the ordinary Wright biplane. The vertical\r\nvane in front, which does not appear on any of the Wright power\r\nfliers, was a foot wide and five feet tall. It acted as a keel and\r\ngave the machine greater side-to-side stability because the wind\r\npassing at a high speed to each side of it tended to keep it vertical.\r\n\r\nIn working out a biplane that could rise from or alight on the water,\r\nGlenn Curtiss practically doubled the usefulness of aeroplanes.\r\nThe experiments, conducted under the auspices of the United States\r\nNavy so impressed the officers that several have been added to its\r\nequipment. Curtiss has been experimenting with hydro-aeroplanes\r\nfor several years, but before actually completing one he conducted\r\na number of experiments with ordinary biplanes in the vicinity of\r\nHampton Roads, Va., in 1911, to prove them available for use on\r\nbattleships. Finally, Lieutenant Ely flew from the deck of the\r\ncruiser _Birmingham_ over the water and to a convenient landing spot\r\non land.\r\n\r\nLater on Curtiss went to California to perfect his hydro-aeroplane,\r\nand while conducting the work Lieutenant Ely made a flight from shore\r\nto the deck of the battleship _Pennsylvania_ which was lying in San\r\nFrancisco Harbour. These two incidents were more in the nature of\r\n\"stunts\" than developments, but they showed what an aeroplane could\r\ndo if attached to a battleship fleet as a scout.\r\n\r\nEven more convincing was the proof when Curtiss finally worked out a\r\nform of wooden float which was put between the mounting wheels. The\r\nfloat was flat-bottomed with an upward inclination at the prow so\r\nthat when skimming over the water the tendency was to rise from the\r\nsurface rather than to cut through it. Small floats at the outer tips\r\nof the lower main plane helped to keep the machine on an even balance\r\nwhile floating at rest upon the water. The wheels served their\r\nregular purpose if the machine started from or alighted upon land.\r\n\r\nThe experiments were conducted on San Diego Bay, and it was only\r\nafter long and patient labour that the work of Mr. Curtiss and his\r\nmilitary associates was rewarded with success. In the course of the\r\nexperiments he tried a triplane, which had great lifting power, but\r\nthis later was abandoned in favour of the regular biplane fitted\r\nwith a float. After the machine had been perfected, Curtiss flew his\r\nhydro-aeroplane out into the bay to the cruiser _Pennsylvania_, upon\r\nwhich Ely had landed a month before, and after landing on the water\r\nat the cruiser's side was pulled up to her deck and later was put\r\nback into the water from where he sailed to camp. The machine was\r\nnamed the _Triad_ because it had conquered air, land, and water.\r\n\r\nOf the machine Curtiss says: \"I believe the hydro-aeroplane\r\nrepresents one of the longest and most important strides in aviation.\r\nIt robs the aeroplane of many of its dangers, and as an engine of\r\nwarfare widens its scope of utility beyond the bounds of the most\r\nvivid imagination. The hydro-aeroplane can fly 60 miles an hour, skim\r\nthe water at 50 miles and run over the earth at 35 miles.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long after the Curtiss hydro-aeroplane had been\r\nsuccessfully demonstrated, before all the other leading makers\r\nbrought out air craft that could sail from and alight on water as\r\nwell as on land. The Wright hydro-aeroplane, which is equipped with\r\ntwo long air-tight metal floats instead of one, has achieved great\r\nsuccess in the United States. In Europe all the leading biplane types\r\nare now made with hydro-aeroplane equipment, and flying over water\r\nbecame as popular last year as flying over land did in 1910.\r\n\r\nThe first American monoplane to be equipped with the floats of a\r\nhydro-plane was shown by the \"Queen\" company at the New York Aero\r\nshow in May, 1912. It was called an aero boat as the front part of\r\nthe fuselage was enclosed like a boat and the operator sat in it,\r\nunder the wings. The propeller was at the rear and there was a small\r\npontoon at each end of the wings to keep it on an even keel when\r\nstationary in the water. A short time after this the Curtiss company\r\nturned out the flying boat which was described on page 90.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE WORLD'S LONGEST GLIDE\r\n\r\n  This photograph shows the new Wright glider, driven by Orville\r\n  Wright, being held above Kill Devil Hill, N.

There have been many improvements, of course, in\r\nconstruction, control of the fliers, and in the powerful engines that\r\ndrive them. In fact the tendency of aeroplane builders has been to\r\nadopt the successful devices on other machines rather than to work\r\nout original ones.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable change in the present-day aeroplanes is the way\r\nin which builders nowadays are enclosing the bodies and landing\r\nframework in canvas or even light metal, so that they shall offer as\r\nlittle resistance to the air as possible. It gives the machines the\r\nappearance of being armoured, as will be noticed from the pictures\r\nof the new planes, so the term has come to be used in that sense,\r\nalthough, of course, the covering would not protect them against\r\nbullets. This armour has become particularly popular with the\r\ndesigners who are making aeroplanes for the French Army, and at the\r\nrecent military tests in France most of the machines were covered to\r\nsome degree, and many of them looked for all the world like great\r\nlong-bodied gulls or mammoth flying fishes.\r\n\r\nSeveral aeroplanes have been equipped with twin motors and double\r\nsteering systems so that either or both could be used. This, of\r\ncourse, is a great advantage in case one fails. Also designers are\r\nfiguring on wing surfaces that can be reefed or telescoped for\r\nbetter stability as well as wings that can be folded for easier\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nExperts do not agree on the respective merits of the two great\r\ngeneral types of aeroplanes--that is, monoplanes and biplanes. Some\r\nclaim that the monoplane is the best and others that the biplane\r\nis the most successful flier. Records show that so far monoplanes\r\nare the faster of the two types, but biplanes can be fitted with\r\nhydro-aeroplane floats, whereas it is impractical with most\r\nmonoplanes. Many declare the biplane to have the greater lifting\r\npower, but the Blériot \"Aero-Bus\" has carried a jolly family party of\r\neight without difficulty. Each type has its champions as to safety,\r\nreliability and endurance, but time will have to decide the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRIGHT BIPLANE\r\n\r\nFirst let us look at one of the latest Wright biplanes as it is\r\nbrought out on the aviation field and is being tuned up by its\r\nkeen-eyed young American pilot. The description of the 1909 Wright\r\nwill be remembered. Also it will be remembered how the Wright\r\nbrothers in 1910 discarded the forward horizontal elevating rudder\r\nentirely, and substituted in its place a single elevating rudder\r\nat the rear end of the tail, which also served to give fore and aft\r\nstability. Also in 1910 the Wright brothers added wheels to the skids\r\nthat hitherto had been used for starting and alighting. Thus the\r\nold system of having the machine skidded along a rail by a falling\r\nweight, as previously described, was done away with in favour of its\r\nrunning over the ground on its wheels.\r\n\r\nAfter noting these improvements, we will look at the general outlines\r\nof such a Wright racing machine as contested for the James Gordon\r\nBennett Cup in 1910. The two main planes are the smallest yet used\r\non a biplane, being only 21-1/2 feet wide from tip to tip, and only\r\n3-1/2 feet from front to rear. Thus, the aspect ratio, it will be\r\nseen is 7. They are the same general shape as the planes on the\r\nother Wright machines, and their total area is 145 square feet. The\r\nmachine is steered up or down by the horizontal elevator rudder in\r\nthe rear, which is oblong-shaped, 8 by 2 feet. The rudder that steers\r\nthe machine from right to left is set vertically at the tail and is\r\nworked in combination with the levers that work the warping of the\r\ntips of the planes. On this little machine the twin-screw propellers,\r\n8-1/2 feet in diameter, sweep practically the whole width of the\r\nmachine. They are connected by chains to the 60-horsepower 8-cylinder\r\nWright engine (in ordinary biplanes of this type the engine is\r\n30 horsepower) and make 525 revolutions per minute (in ordinary\r\nmachines of this type they make 450 revolutions per minute). The\r\nmachine weighs a total of 760 pounds and is capable of more than 60\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe elevation rudder is controlled by a lever set either at the right\r\nor left hand of the operator. The direction rudder is controlled by\r\na lever that also controls the warping of the planes, as in turning\r\nit is necessary to cant the machine over to the inner side of the\r\ncurve being made, in order to prevent slipping sidewise through the\r\nair. However the handle of the direction and warping lever is so\r\narranged by a clutch system that by moving the lever simply from\r\nside to side the direction lever can be worked independently of the\r\nwarping. The direction and balancing system then, we see, is worked\r\nin this manner. Say, while flying, a gust of wind causes the biplane\r\nto dip at the right end. The operator quickly moves his warping lever\r\nforward. This pulls down the tips of the right planes, and at the\r\nsame time elevates the tips of the left planes. The change of the\r\nangle makes the right side lift to its normal position while it makes\r\nthe left side drop. Consequently the machine is restored to an even\r\nkeel and the operator lets the planes spring back to their normal\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nThe large 1911 Wright biplanes, model B, are designed the same as the\r\nsmall racing models except that the wings have a spread of 39 feet,\r\nand a depth of 6-1/4 feet--a total area of 440 square feet. The\r\nperpendicular triangular surfaces in front like two little jib sails,\r\nare a distinguishing feature, although the latest Wright models\r\nsubstitute narrow vertical fins about six feet tall and six inches\r\nwide. They are placed immediately in front of the main planes. The\r\nhydro-aeroplane substitutes two aluminum floats for the wheels.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURTISS BIPLANE\r\n\r\nThe Curtiss biplane, which we have seen has had a great deal to\r\ndo with the development of aviation, is one of the simplest and\r\nmost successful machines known to-day. The main planes of the\r\nregular-sized machines have a spread of 26-1/2 feet, are set 5 feet\r\napart, and have a depth from front to rear of 4-1/2 feet. The total\r\nwing area is 220 feet. The direction rudder is a single vertical\r\nvane at the rear, which is turned by the steering wheel connected\r\nby cables. The elevation rudder consisting of one horizontal plane\r\n24 square feet in area is at the front and is turned up or down\r\nby the pilot as he desires to sail up or down, by means of a long\r\nbamboo pole connecting the elevation rudder with his pilot wheel. He\r\npushes the wheel forward or back to rise or descend, while he twists\r\nit from right to left to turn in either of those directions. The\r\nside-to-side balance was maintained in the early Curtiss machines by\r\nflexible wing tips, but these later were replaced by ailerons placed\r\nbetween and at the outer tips of the main planes. Each aileron had an\r\narea of 12 square feet and they were operated by a brace fitted to\r\nthe operator's body. Thus, if the machine tipped to the right, the\r\noperator would swing to the left, turn the ailerons, and right the\r\nmachine. In some later Curtiss biplanes these ailerons were replaced\r\nby others, like flaps attached to the rear outer edges of the main\r\nplanes. By raising the flaps on one side and lowering them on the\r\nother the balance was well preserved.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, these machines are driven by Curtiss engines. In\r\nmost of them the engines are 4-cylinder, 25-horsepower motors. The\r\ncylinders in this type, of course, are stationary, but the engine\r\nshaft is directly connected with the 6-foot propeller at the rear,\r\nwhich makes 1,200 revolutions per minute. The pilot sits between the\r\ntwo main planes of his engine. On large Curtiss machines seats for as\r\nmany as three passengers have been arranged at the sides of the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe most important work Curtiss has done in the last few years is the\r\ndevelopment of the hydro-aeroplane, which has been explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOISIN BIPLANE\r\n\r\nThe next biplane with which we are familiar is the Voisin, which\r\nHenri Farman demonstrated as the first really successful aeroplane\r\nseen in Europe. This machine was a standard of what was called the\r\ncellular type because it was composed of cells, like a box kite. The\r\ntwo main planes, which were the same size, 37 feet by 6-1/2 feet,\r\nwere connected at the outer edges so as to make the plane a closed\r\ncell--i. e., a box with the ends knocked out. Two other vertical\r\nsurfaces between the main plane gave the machine the appearance of\r\nthree box kites side by side. The tail out behind was composed of a\r\nsquare cell. In the centre of it was a vertical vane for steering it\r\nfrom right to left, while out in front was a single horizontal rudder\r\nfor raising or lowering the plane. The control was much the same as\r\nin the Curtiss machine. The steering wheel turned the plane from\r\nright to left, and was connected by a rod with the elevator, so that\r\nby pushing it forward or back, the machine was raised or lowered.\r\nThere was no device for maintaining a side-to-side balance as the\r\ncell formation was supposed to keep the machine on an even keel. The\r\nmotor drove a propeller at the rear.\r\n\r\nThe later Bordeaux type of Voisin which was built for military\r\npurposes does away with the side curtains and box tail. On the outer\r\nrear edge of the upper main plane are ailerons for maintaining the\r\nbalance, which are operated by foot pedals. The elevator is a single\r\nhorizontal plane at the rear of the tail, while the direction rudder\r\nis a vertical plane beneath it. This machine carries two persons, and\r\nis frequently driven by a Gnome engine.\r\n\r\nStill another and later type of the Voisin Bordeaux is the front\r\ncontrol. In this the ailerons are used as previously described, but\r\nalso there are side curtains enclosing the outer edges of the main\r\nplanes. Out in front at the end of a long framework or fuselage are\r\nthe horizontal elevating planes, and the vertical direction planes.\r\nBoth these machines have double control systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMAN BIPLANE\r\n\r\nDissatisfied with the work of his first Voisin biplane in the early\r\ndays of flying Henri Farman designed and built a machine that bore\r\nhis own name, of which the military type is now looked upon with\r\ngreat favour by many of the European experts.\r\n\r\nThe two main supporting planes in the regular Farman models were 33\r\nfeet by 6-1/2 feet, set 7 feet apart, and with a total area of 430\r\nsquare feet. These dimensions have been varied slightly in other\r\nmachines. The elevating rudder, which was set well out in front of\r\nthe body of the machine, was a horizontal plane controlled by a wire\r\nand lever. In the rear was a tail of two parallel surfaces, slightly\r\ncurved like the main planes of the biplanes. These two surfaces\r\nsteadied the machine from front to rear. At their two sides were two\r\nvertical surfaces, giving the tail the appearance of a box kite,\r\nso familiar in the Voisin. These two vertical surfaces, however,\r\ncomprised the direction rudder, and were turned from side to side by\r\nthe operator with a foot lever. In some of the later Farman biplanes\r\nthe two vertical surfaces were done away with in favour of a single\r\none, extending between the centres of the two horizontal surfaces of\r\nthe tail. The side-to-side balance was maintained by ailerons in the\r\nform of wing tips set at the outer rear edges of the main planes.\r\nThe tips were hinged and connected with wires which led to the lever\r\nthat worked the elevating rudder. Thus by pulling this lever toward\r\nhim the operator tilted the rudder up, and the machine rose, and by\r\nmoving it from side to side the biplane was kept on an even keel. For\r\ninstance, if the machine were to tip to the right he would move the\r\nlever to the left, pulling _down_ the hinged ailerons on the right.\r\nThe ones on the left would still remain standing straight out at the\r\nsame angle as the main planes. The increase in the lifting power on\r\nthe right side would cause that end to rise, righting the machine.\r\n\r\nMost Farman biplanes these days are driven by the well known\r\n7-cylinder Gnome rotary air-cooled engines, set at the rear of the\r\nmain plane. They are directly connected with the single propeller,\r\nwhich is 8-1/2 feet in diameter. The seat for the aviator is in front\r\nof the engine at the front edge of the lower plane, and there also\r\nfrequently are placed seats for two other passengers. The machine is\r\nmounted on wheels and skids.\r\n\r\nThe \"Farman Militaire\" type is one of the largest and heaviest\r\nmachines made to date, having a total area of supporting plane of 540\r\nsquare feet. The chief difference is that instead of two direction\r\nrudders there are three, and that the lower main plane is set at\r\na dihedral angle. It was on such a machine (\"Type Michelin\") that\r\nFarman flew steadily for eight and a half hours. It also has made\r\nremarkable distance, endurance, and weight-carrying records, although\r\nit is a slow machine, making but 34 to 35 miles an hour. The \"Type\r\nMichelin\" is distinguished by the fact that the upper main plane has\r\na spread of 49 feet, 3 inches, while the lower plane had a spread of\r\nonly 36 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE FARMAN BIPLANE\r\n\r\nSoon after Henri Farman had become famous as an aviator and\r\nconstructor of aeroplanes, his brother Maurice began to build\r\nair craft. The Maurice Farman biplane was the result. After\r\nconducting their business separately for several years the brothers\r\nconsolidated, and each type is known by the name of the brother\r\ndesigning it. The Maurice Farman biplane has some remarkable records,\r\namong them the winning of the Michelin prize in 1910 by Tabuteau, who\r\nflew 362-1/2 miles in seven and a half hours without stopping.\r\n\r\nThe main planes have a spread of 36 feet and a depth of 7-1/2 feet.\r\nThey have not as great a curve or camber as most biplanes, which\r\nincreases their speed. The tail is of the well-known Farman cell\r\nformation--that is, it has four sides. The two vertical surfaces\r\nswing on pivots and are controlled by wires connecting with the\r\ndirection steering wheel. The horizontal surfaces of the tail, except\r\nfor the tips, are stationary, and steady the machine from front to\r\nrear. The rear tips of these two surfaces, however, work on pivots in\r\nconnection with the main elevating plane which is set out in front.\r\nThe elevator is a single plane controlled by a rod connected with the\r\nsteering wheel, while the tips of the horizontal tail surfaces are\r\ncontrolled in unison with the main elevator by wires, also connected\r\nwith the steering wheel. Ailerons are set into the rear outer tips\r\nof the main planes, for the control of the side-to-side balance, and\r\nthese are worked by foot pedals. In order to give greater safety in\r\ncase of the breakage of a wire, all the controlling parts in the\r\nMaurice Farman machine are duplicate, which is a big step toward the\r\nmuch-desired double controlling system in aeroplanes. The biplane\r\nis mounted on both skids and wheels. The operator sits well forward\r\non the lower plane in a comfortable little pit enclosed in canvas.\r\nThus, the Maurice Farman machine was the first to adopt this device\r\nfor shielding the pilot from the wind. The engine used usually is an\r\n8-cylinder air-cooled Renault, which drives a propeller nearly 10\r\nfeet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREGUET BIPLANE\r\n\r\nOnly slightly known in the United States but well and favourably\r\nknown in Europe, particularly in France, is the Breguet biplane,\r\nwhich made wonderful records in the French Army tests in 1911. A\r\nbrief description will show the difference between this machine and\r\nothers of the biplane type. It has won many prizes for its stability\r\nand lifting powers, and also has shown great speed. The framework is\r\nmostly metal and is so elastic that it gives under the pulsations\r\nfor the wind, so that the machine is not so badly strained by gusts\r\nas the more rigid kinds. Also it is thought the elasticity increases\r\nits lifting capacity. Of the two main planes the upper one spreads\r\n43-1/2 feet, while the lower one spreads 32-1/2 feet. They are 5-1/2\r\nfeet deep, and set 7 feet apart. The body and tail of the machine are\r\nmade on delicate graceful lines, terminating in the elevation and\r\ndirection rudders at the rear. There are no rudders, vanes, or other\r\nrigging out in front. The lateral balance is maintained by warping\r\nthe planes. The propeller is at the front of the machine, and is of\r\nthe tractor type, pulling it through the air instead of pushing it.\r\nIn the latest machines a metallic three-bladed Breguet propeller, the\r\npitch of which is self-adjusting, is used, but in others a two-bladed\r\nwooden propeller, such as is familiar in this country. The long body,\r\nor fuselage, as the framework of the tail is called, is enclosed\r\non the latest types of Breguets in use by the French Army, greatly\r\nadding to its gracefulness, and decreasing the wind pressure.\r\n\r\nThere are several other makes of biplanes that could be described\r\nto advantage but space prevents it, and the descriptions here given\r\nserve to illustrate the principle of the biplane type of aeroplane.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLÉRIOT MONOPLANE\r\n\r\nThe first and probably best known monoplane, the Blériot, still holds\r\nmany records for both speed and endurance. The Blériot machines have\r\nso many variations that it would be impossible to describe all the\r\ntypes of monoplanes this versatile Frenchman has turned out. We are\r\nfamiliar in a general way with the Blériot, the single widespreading\r\nmain plane, set at a slight dihedral angle, with its long, graceful\r\nbody out behind terminating in the horizontal elevating and vertical\r\ndirection rudders, giving it the appearance of a great soaring bird\r\nas it sails through the air as steadily as an automobile on a smooth\r\nroad--much more steadily in fact, for as soon as the wheels of an\r\naeroplane leave the ground all jolting disappears, and not even the\r\nvibration of the engine is noticeable, although the roar of its\r\nexplosions can be heard a great distance. There is nothing but the\r\nbreeze and the earth streaming along behind you, as if it were moving\r\nand you were hovering motionless high up in the sky.\r\n\r\nIn the famous Blériot XI, in which the designer made the first trip\r\nacross the English Channel, the main plane had a spread of a little\r\nmore than 28 feet and a depth of 6-1/2 feet, a total area of 151\r\nsquare feet and a low aspect ratio of about 4.6. At the end of the\r\nstout wooden framework, that made up the body and tail, was the\r\nvertical direction rudder 4-1/2 square feet in area which was turned\r\nfrom right to left by a foot lever. The elevation rudder was divided\r\ninto two halves, one part being put at each side of the direction\r\nrudder. The total area of the elevator was 16 square feet, while the\r\nhorizontal stabilizing plane to which the elevator was attached was\r\nabout the same. The balance was maintained by warping the main plane,\r\nbut instead of warping the tips of the plane, as is done in the\r\nWright biplanes, the two sides of the main plane were warped from the\r\nbase, so that the operator could change the angle of incidence--that\r\nis, the angle at which the planes travel through the air. Thus, if\r\nthe machine should tip down on the right side, the operator would\r\nwarp the planes so as to increase the angle of incidence on the right\r\nside and lessen it on the left side. In other words, the rear part\r\nof the right wing would be bent downward, while on the left side the\r\nrear edge would be raised. The forward edge remains stationary. The\r\nincrease of the angle on the right side would cause an increase of\r\nthe lifting power on that side and also the decrease of the angle\r\non the left side would lessen the lifting power of the left wing\r\nso the right side, which was tipping down, would be lifted, and the\r\nmachine restored to an even keel. This warping was done by moving\r\nfrom side to side the same lever on which was mounted the steering\r\nwheel. The whole machine was mounted on a strong chassis with wheels\r\nfor starting and alighting. The pilot sat in the framework above\r\nthe main plane. The monoplane was propelled by a single propeller\r\nof the tractor type 6 to 7 feet in diameter, placed at the front of\r\nthe machine. It was driven in the early Blériots by a 23-horsepower\r\nAnzani motor, but more lately the Blériot machines have carried Gnome\r\nmotors.\r\n\r\nOne of the important improvements which appeared on the No. XI _bis_\r\nwas the changing of the main plane so that the upper side was curved\r\nbut the under side was nearly flat. This gave the machine much more\r\nspeed and the designers found that the flattening out of the curve on\r\nthe under side did not greatly lessen the lifting power. This same\r\ntype of machine also was made later to carry three passengers. The\r\nmachine known as the \"Type Militaire\" was just about like the others\r\nexcept that the tail instead of being rectangular was fan-shaped. It\r\ncarried seats for two and was equipped with all the latest aviation\r\naccoutrements, such as tachometers, barographs to record altitude,\r\ninstrument to record inclination, various other gauges, map cases and\r\nthermos bottles.\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive feature of the Blériot No. XII, which was the\r\nfirst aeroplane to carry three passengers, was the long vertical\r\nkeel, shaped like the fin of a fish at the top of the framework. The\r\ndirection rudder was at the rear of this keel, while the elevation\r\nrudder was at the rear and a little below it. Immediately below the\r\ndirection rudder was a small horizontal plane about the size of the\r\nelevation rudder which helped to maintain a fore and aft stability.\r\n\r\nThen there was the famous Blériot aerobus which would carry 8 to\r\n10 people. The machine was very large, the wings having a spread\r\nof 39 feet and a total area of 430 square feet. It was driven by\r\na 100-horsepower Gnome motor and a propeller 10 feet in diameter,\r\nwhich was placed at the rear of the main plane. Thus the propeller\r\ndrove the machine through the air from the rear instead of pulling it\r\nfrom the front as do the tractor propellers on most of the Blériot\r\nmonoplanes. The passengers were seated underneath the main plane on\r\nthe framework which extended out to the rear. The tail terminated\r\nin the vertical direction rudder and a large stationary horizontal\r\nsurface which gave the necessary front-to-rear stability. The\r\nelevating plane of this type was placed out in front.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE FLYING BOAT STARTING\r\n\r\n  The latest aeroplane is here seen cutting through the water\r\n  preparatory to ascending into the air.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CURTISS FLYING BOAT\r\n\r\n  This is the very latest development in the hydro-aeroplane, and\r\n  moreover it is claimed by its inventor, Glenn Curtiss, to be the\r\n  first absolutely safe aeroplane.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GLENN CURTISS ALLOWING HIS HYDRO-AEROPLANE TO\r\n  FLOAT ON THE WATER AFTER ALIGHTING]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HYDRO-AEROPLANE AT MONTE CARLO\r\n\r\n  At the hydro-aeroplane meet at Monaco practically every\r\n  well-known type of biplane was equipped with pontoons and entered\r\n  the contest.]\r\n\r\nThe Blériot Canard or \"duck\" is one of the latest developments of\r\nthe pioneer constructor, and the chief difference between it and\r\nthe other Blériot machines is that the body extends out in front\r\nof the main plane instead of behind, something like Santos-Dumont's\r\nfirst machine. The main plane has a spread of 29 feet, and has a\r\ntotal supporting surface of 129 square feet. At the forward end of\r\nthe body is placed the horizontal elevating rudder, while two small\r\nvertical rudders, placed on the top of the outer ends of the main\r\nplane and working in unison, serve to steer it from side to side. The\r\nbalance in this machine is preserved by large hinged ailerons at the\r\nouter rear edges of the main plane. The pilot sits in front of the\r\nengine underneath the plane, which is a military advantage, giving\r\nhim ample chance for looking down and observing everything over which\r\nhe is passing.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTOINETTE MONOPLANE\r\n\r\nNo machine that ever was flown has excited more admiration from those\r\non the ground than the graceful Antoinette monoplane, designed by the\r\nfamous French motor-boat builder, Levavasseur. Its great tapering\r\nwings and long fan-shaped tail give it the appearance of a huge\r\nswallow or dragon-fly as it sails through the air, and whenever this\r\ntype has appeared at the American meets it has received tremendous\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nThe two best known models of the Antoinette are the type used by\r\nLatham in this country, and the \"armoured\" type, entered in the\r\nFrench military tests. The bow of the first-mentioned machine\r\nis shaped very much like the prow of a boat with the 50 to 100\r\nhorsepower 8-or 16-cylinder water-cooled Antoinette engine occupying\r\nthe extreme forward part. The propeller is set in front of this,\r\nand is of the tractor type, drawing the machine through the air\r\nbehind it. In the recent models of the Antoinette, the main plane,\r\nset at a slight dihedral angle, spread a little more than 49 feet\r\n(compare this with the spread of 28 feet of the Blériot). The two\r\nsides of the main plane taper from the body of the machine, but have\r\nan average depth from front to rear of 8 feet, which gives a fairly\r\nhigh aspect ratio of about 6. The total area is 405 square feet. The\r\nmain plane also tapers in thickness, being nearly a foot through\r\nclose to the body and tapering down to a few inches at the outer\r\ntips. The graceful tail at the rear has both vertical and horizontal\r\nsurfaces gently tapering to the height and width of the elevating\r\nand direction rudders. The elevating rudder is a single horizontal\r\ntriangular surface at the rear controlled by cables running to a\r\npilot wheel at the operator's right hand. It has an area of 20 square\r\nfeet. The direction rudder is composed of two triangular surfaces\r\nwith an area of 10 square feet each. One is above the elevator and\r\nthe other below, but both are worked in unison by wires connecting\r\nwith a foot lever. The machine is balanced by a warping system\r\nmuch like that on the Wright biplanes we know so well. This is\r\naccomplished by wires connecting with a steering wheel at the pilot's\r\nleft hand, so that he uses his right hand to steer his machine up\r\nor down, his feet to steer from right to left, and his left hand to\r\nmaintain the balance. Of course, in making a sharp turn he uses his\r\nwarping wheel as well as his direction wheel, because, as previously\r\nexplained, it is necessary to incline the machine over toward the\r\ninside of the curve desired to be made. The pilot sits in the\r\nframework, above and a little back of the supporting plane.\r\n\r\nThe \"armoured\" Antoinette, which was designed for military purposes,\r\nis entirely enclosed, even increasing the already great resemblance\r\nto a bird, while the direction rudder is made of a single surface,\r\nand the elevating rudder of two rhomboid-shaped rudders. The pilot\r\nsits in a cockpit with only his head and shoulders protruding above\r\nand has a view below through a glass floor. Its most important\r\nfeature is the total elimination of cross wires, struts and the like.\r\nThe resistance is greatly decreased, but the weight increased. In\r\naddition, a peculiar wing section is used, flat on the under side\r\nand curved on the upper side. The wings are immensely thick, being\r\nentirely braced from the inside. At the body the wings are over\r\ntwo feet thick. Their thickness decreases toward the tips, which\r\nare about eight inches thick. The shape of each wing is called\r\ntrapesoidal, and they are set at a large dihedral angle. The motor\r\nis a regular 100-horsepower Antoinette.\r\n\r\nThe oddest feature of this type is the landing gear, which is\r\nentirely enclosed to within a few inches of the ground; the landing\r\nwheels at the front are six in number, three on each side of the\r\ncentre, enclosed in what is called a \"skirt.\" At the rear are two\r\nsmaller wheels.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions are roughly as follows: Spread, 52-1/2 feet, wings,\r\n602 square feet; length over all, 36 feet; depth of wings (from front\r\nto rear) at tips, over 9 feet, increasing to almost 13 feet at the\r\ncentre. The total weight is nearly 2,400 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIEUPORT MONOPLANE\r\n\r\nThe Nieuport monoplane is one of the newer machines that has\r\nattracted a great deal of attention for its speed with low-powered\r\nengines. Among the achievements of this monoplane was Weyman's\r\nwinning of the James Gordon Bennett Cup and prize in England in 1911,\r\nand the demonstration of its remarkable passenger carrying abilities.\r\nThe Nieuport also is a wonderful glider, for Claude Grahame-White\r\ntook his new one up 3,000 feet at Nassau Boulevard, Garden City,\r\nduring the 1911 meet there and glided down the whole distance without\r\npower, the downward sail taking him nearly as long as the upward\r\nclimb.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE WRIGHT BIPLANE\r\n\r\n  Baby Wright model. Orville Wright is in front of seat, while\r\n  Wilbur Wright is holding back on the fuselage.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STANDARD CURTISS BIPLANE\r\n\r\n  For reliability and stability the Curtiss biplane is one of the\r\n  best known models.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CURTISS STEERING GEAR\r\n\r\n  Sitting in front of the engine the aviator controls the ailerons\r\n  by straps over his shoulders, and the direction and elevation\r\n  rudders by the steering wheel.]\r\n\r\nThe passenger machine has a spread of 36 feet with a length of\r\nabout 24 feet from front to rear. This machine is generally equipped\r\nwith a 50 or 70 horsepower Gnome motor, although the plane with\r\nwhich Weyman won the Gordon Bennett contest was equipped with a\r\n100-horsepower Gnome motor. The smaller machine has a spread of 27\r\nfeet, 6 inches and a length of 23 feet. An engine of the 3-cylinder\r\nAnzani type is usually mounted on this monoplane.\r\n\r\nThe body of the flier gracefully tapers to a point at the rear where\r\nare placed the elevating and steering rudders.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics of the Nieuport are strength, simplicity in\r\ndesign, and great efficiency of operation. The smaller machine, which\r\nis equipped with an engine of from 18 to 20 horsepower, has acquired\r\na speed of 52-1/2 miles an hour. The Nieuport is constructed along\r\noriginal lines throughout. The wings are very thick at the front\r\nedge, while the rear edges are flexible so that in gusts of wind they\r\ngive a little.\r\n\r\nThe fuselage, or body of the machine, which is extraordinarily large,\r\nand shaped like the body of a bird, is entirely covered with canvas.\r\n\r\nThe weakest part of the Nieuport monoplane is the alighting and\r\nrunning gear, which is so designed as to eliminate head resistance,\r\nbut unfortunately this simplicity is carried to an extreme which\r\nmakes the machine the most difficult one to run along the ground,\r\nand to this construction may be traced most of the accidents which\r\nhave occurred to the Nieuport machines.\r\n\r\nThe Nieuport control differs from that of the majority of other\r\nmachines inasmuch as the wing warping is controlled by the feet,\r\nwhile hand levers operate the vertical and elevating rudders.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODEL AEROPLANES\r\n\r\nAfter having taken in such a lot of information about aeroplanes the\r\nscientist's young friend considered himself fairly well equipped to\r\nbuild a flier.\r\n\r\n\"Why couldn't I build a little model aeroplane?\" he said one day.\r\n\r\n\"No reason why young couldn't,\" answered his friend in the\r\nlaboratory. \"You have a little workshop at home and your own simple\r\ntools will be plenty. You will have to buy some of your materials,\r\nbut they are all cheap.\r\n\r\n\"There is no sport like model aeroplane flying, but to the average\r\nAmerican boy the flying is not half so much fun as meeting and\r\novercoming the obstacles and problems entailed in making the little\r\nplane. These days nearly any boy would scorn to enter a model\r\naeroplane tournament with any machine that he did not make himself,\r\nand a great many of the amateur aviators even prefer to make their\r\nown designs and plans.\r\n\r\n\"When we begin to take up the construction of a glider or an\r\naeroplane, we must, like the Wright brothers, reluctantly enter upon\r\nthe scientific side of it, because in model building we cannot simply\r\nmake exact reproductions of the great man-carrying fliers, but must\r\nmeet and overcome new problems. The laws that govern the standard\r\naeroplanes apply a little differently to models, so it is necessary\r\nfor the model builder to figure things out for himself.\r\n\r\n\"For instance,\" explained the scientist, \"most amateurs have decided\r\nthat monoplane models fly much better than biplanes. The reason\r\nfor this is probably that with the miniature makes the air is so\r\ndisturbed by the propeller that its action on the lower plane\r\ntends to make it unsteady rather than to give it a greater lifting\r\ncapacity. This could be avoided by placing the two planes farther\r\napart, but they would have to be so far separated that the machine\r\nwould be ungainly and out of all proportion. Moreover, the second\r\nplane, with the necessary stays and trusses, adds to the weight of\r\nthe machine, and this is always bad in models.\r\n\r\n\"There are as many different types of model aeroplanes as there are\r\nof the big man carriers, but you had better make a small flier first,\r\nexperiment with it, and then work out your own variations just as you\r\nthink best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you help me build one?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"No, for you don't need my help and you will have more fun doing it\r\nalone. I will tell you how to go about it, and with what you know of\r\nthe principles of aviation from our conversations it will be easy to\r\nmake a successful model.\"\r\n\r\nThen taking a piece of paper and a pencil the scientist began to draw\r\nrough plans for the building of a little model monoplane something\r\nlike the Blériot, except that it was driven tail first, with the\r\npropeller at the rear. As he worked he explained how the plan shown\r\nbelow should be followed, saying that the beginner would find that a\r\nlength of about one foot would be the most convenient for this first\r\nmodel. Later on he can make the big ones with a spread of wings of\r\nthree feet, and a length of forty or more inches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A SIMPLE MODEL AEROPLANE]\r\n\r\nFirst, the three main parts of the model should be made. Those are\r\nthe two main planes and backbone. The simplest way of making the\r\nplanes for a model of this kind is to use thin boards of poplar or\r\nspruce, which will not split easily and which can be worked with a\r\njackknife. The large plane should be rectangular, with a spread\r\nof eight inches and a depth of two inches, while the smaller plane\r\nshould be the same shape, four by one inch. They should be one eighth\r\nof an inch or less in thickness. Plane and sandpaper them down as\r\nthin and as smooth as possible without splitting them, and round off\r\nthe corners just enough to do away with sharp edges. Now draw a line\r\nparallel with the side that is eight inches long, three quarters of\r\nan inch from the edge. Measure off two inches toward the centre from\r\nthe outer edges, along this line, and draw lines parallel with the\r\nedges that are two inches deep. At the corners which are to be the\r\nrear we find the lines make two rectangles three quarters of an inch\r\nby two inches, and these corners are to be cut away in a graceful\r\ncurve from the corners of the rectangles. When it is done the main\r\nplane will be shaped like a big D with the curved edge to the rear.\r\nThe front edge of the small plane also should be curved, but not\r\nnearly so much as the larger plane. This done, the planes can be\r\nsteamed or moistened with varnish, and given a slight curve or camber\r\nby laying them on a flat board with a little stick underneath and\r\nweights at the front and back to hold down the edges while they dry\r\nand set. The sticks should be about one third of the way back from\r\nthe front edges, from there tapering down to the level of the rear\r\nedge. Of course, in this process great care must be used not to split\r\nthe delicate planes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STANDARD FARMAN BIPLANE\r\n\r\n  Note the box tail and the single elevating plane.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FARMAN PLANE WITH ENCLOSED NOSE\r\n\r\n  This type is sometimes used in Europe, and it led to the Farman\r\n  \"canard\" with the box tail in front.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MODERN BLÉRIOT\r\n\r\n  This machine has the enclosed fuselage and other recent\r\n  improvements. Note the four-bladed propeller.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A STANDARD BLÉRIOT\r\n\r\n  This is the regular type of Blériot made famous by long\r\n  over-water flights.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PASSENGER-CARRYING BLÉRIOT\r\n\r\n  This type has tremendous capacity for carrying great weights.]\r\n\r\nThere are many other ways of making planes. If one does not care to\r\nround off the edges, he can make very light wooden rectangular frames\r\nof the size indicated, and cover them with cloth, or silk, afterward\r\nvarnishing them to make them smooth and air-tight. It is difficult\r\nto give such planes a camber, but if the framework is made of strong\r\nlight wire, such as umbrella ribs, and then covered, the camber can\r\nbe obtained by putting light wire or light wooden ribs in the planes,\r\nmuch like on the big standard makes. Plane building can be developed\r\nto a high art, and after a boy makes one or two models he will see\r\nany number of ways that he can make them lighter, stronger and more\r\nprofessional looking.\r\n\r\nWith the planes finished, the next work is to make the backbone of\r\nthe machine by planing and sandpapering a light strong stick one\r\nfoot long and not more than a quarter of an inch square. Cut out a\r\nneat block of the same wood, the same thickness as the backbone, and\r\none inch square. Glue it to the end of the backbone and reinforce it\r\nby wrapping it with silken thread moistened with glue or varnish.\r\nBe sure to have the grain of this block, which is the motor base,\r\nrun the same as the backbone. Three quarters of an inch from the\r\nbackbone, and parallel with it, bore a little hole for the propeller\r\nshaft or axle. Unless you are sure of your drill, heat a thin steel\r\nwire and burn the hole, rather than risk splitting the block.\r\n\r\nThe propeller is the next thing to make, while the glue on the\r\nbackbone is drying, and the camber of the plane is setting. Some\r\nmodels have metal propellers, but most boys prefer to make wooden\r\nones, either from blocks of their own cutting or from blanks that\r\ncan be purchased. The blank should be four inches in diameter an\r\ninch wide, and half an inch thick. It can be cut away very thin\r\nwith a sharp knife, and a fairly good whittler can make a propeller\r\nthat looks as businesslike as the great gleaming blades on the big\r\nmachines. A wire then should be run through the dead centre of\r\nthe propeller and bent over so that when the wire shaft turns the\r\npropeller also turns. As a bearing or washer the simplest device\r\nis a glass bead strung on the shaft and well oiled to lessen the\r\nfriction, between the propeller and the propeller base. The shaft is\r\nthen run through the hole in the motor base and bent into a hook for\r\nthe rubber strands that drive the propeller. Great care should be\r\ntaken in mounting the propeller and making the hook that the shaft is\r\nkept in an absolutely straight line, and at an accurate right angle\r\nwith the propeller, so that the screw can turn free and true with\r\nas little friction as possible, and no wobbling or unbusinesslike\r\nvibration. Next a wire hook should be placed at the other end of the\r\nbackbone upon which to hook the other end of the rubber strands. This\r\nhook can either be imbedded in another block the same size as the\r\nmotor base or can be set out by some other ingenious device, so that\r\nthe strands will turn free of the backbone, and will make an even\r\nline parallel with it. Both hooks should be covered by little pieces\r\nof rubber tubing to protect the rubber strands. Any friction whatever\r\nin a model is bad, but it is worst of all upon the rubber strands of\r\nthe motor.\r\n\r\nWith the parts in hand the next step is attaching the planes to the\r\nbackbone. In this machine the motor should be above the planes, so\r\nthat the planes should be affixed to the upper side of the central\r\nstick, with the rubber strands above them. The propeller is at the\r\nrear, so the small front plane should be placed at the front, with\r\nthe slightly curved edge to the rear. It should be about an inch from\r\nthe tip of the stick and the front edge should be elevated slightly\r\nto give the necessary lifting power. The main plane should be placed\r\nabout an inch from the rear tip of the backbone, with the curved edge\r\nto the rear and the front slightly elevated. The planes should be\r\naffixed with rubber bands so that it is possible to move them forward\r\nor back, because the little monoplane might be lacking in fore and\r\naft stability and the rearrangement of the planes might correct it.\r\nIt might even be found more satisfactory in some models to change\r\nthe order and let the propeller, base, and strands of the motor come\r\nbelow the planes instead of above them. Your own experience will tell\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE ANTOINETTE MONOPLANE\r\n\r\n  New armoured Antoinette shown in the large picture, while the\r\n  small insert shows the old-style machine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Photo by Philip W. Wilcox\r\n\r\n  THE NIEUPORT MONOPLANE\r\n\r\n  Comparatively a new make, the Nieuport monoplane has sprung into\r\n  great favour for its speed and passenger-carrying capacities.]\r\n\r\nOf course, the planes must be placed on the backbone exactly evenly\r\nor the airship will be lopsided, a fatal fault. By experimenting, the\r\nboy can tell just how high the front edges should be elevated, or,\r\nin other words, what angle of incidence he should give his plane.\r\nA rudder, to keep the machine in a straight course, can be added\r\nunderneath the centre of the main plane. It should be about two\r\ninches square, but shaved off to a curving razor edge. Also light\r\nskids of cane or rattan may be added. They should be glued to the\r\nunder side of the backbone and curved backward like sled runners. The\r\nfront one should be two and a half to three inches high, while the\r\nrear one should be about an inch to an inch and a half less.\r\n\r\nAfter trying out the model as a glider by throwing it across\r\na room and making sure it is well balanced both laterally and\r\nlongitudinally, or from side to side, and fore and aft, the rubber\r\nstrands can be put on, and the motor wound up. About four strands\r\nof rubber one eighth of an inch square, such as is sold for this\r\npurpose, would suffice for good flights of more than one hundred\r\nfeet, if the machine were of the same weight and proportions as the\r\nmodel from which this description was written. In models, however,\r\nthere are many little details that can change the conditions, and a\r\nboy can only experiment, locate his mistakes, and try it over again.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the simplest and easiest model aeroplanes that can\r\nbe made. A trip to one of the model aeroplane tournaments will\r\nreveal dozens of more elaborate ones, which will give any ingenious\r\nboy ideas for development of the principles he can learn from the\r\nsimpler type. Probably the next step of the average boy would be to\r\nbuild a machine with two motors, which can be done by elaborating\r\nthe single stick backbone or by making a backbone of two or three\r\nsticks well braced with cross pieces at each end and in the middle.\r\nThen there are interesting experiments with the size of planes,\r\nnumber of planes, their aspect ratio--that is the proportion of their\r\nwidth to their depth--ailerons for automatic stability, and rudders\r\nfor keeping the machine on a straight course. There are always new\r\nthings to be done with the motors, because, though the rubber motors\r\nhave driven models close to half a mile, there are now on the market\r\nminiature gasoline motors to drive models, and experiments are being\r\ntried with clockwork and compressed air. Indeed the model aeroplane\r\nfield is as broad in itself as that of the man-carrying machines.\r\n\r\nAviation has been reduced to an exact science, but it is yet in its\r\nearly growth, both in the field of models and in the field of the\r\nvarious kinds of man-carrying machines. Not only are the designers\r\nmaking great headway with aeroplanes, but also with dirigible\r\nballoons so any one interested in aeronautics has a very wide field\r\nfor his work. As we said in an earlier chapter, the boy model\r\ndesigner of to-day may be the inventor of to-morrow who gains undying\r\nfame by some now undreamed-of development of the aeroplane.\r\n\r\nThe designers of the man carriers are trying to make their machines\r\nstronger, safer, more reliable, capable of carrying more passengers,\r\nand they hope at last to bring them to a more practical use in the\r\nworld than as a sport. The most thoughtful aviators do not favour\r\nexhibition flying so strongly as they do long cross-country flights,\r\nendurance tests, passenger-carrying tests, and other experiments that\r\nwill develop aeroplanes beyond their present limitations.\r\n\r\nThe next great feat of the aeroplane is the crossing of the Atlantic\r\nOcean, and that may not be far distant, for at the time of writing\r\nhalf a dozen aviators are planning the attempt, but even more\r\nimportant than that, even more important than the development of the\r\naeroplane for war scouting, is the development of the aeroplane as a\r\nfaithful servant of the people who are quietly going about their own\r\neveryday business. The time will come when the readers of this may\r\nsend their mail by aeroplane, take pleasure rides in the aeroplane\r\ninstead of the automobile, and even make regular trips on regularly\r\nestablished aeroplane routes, buying their tickets at the great\r\ncentral aeroplane stations as they would buy railroad tickets in the\r\nGrand Central or the Pennsylvania stations to-day, taking their seats\r\nin comfortably arranged aero cars, and being whisked in a few hours\r\nfrom one part of the country to the other, and even from one side of\r\nthe ocean to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL LIGHTNING MADE AND HARNESSED TO MAN'S USE\r\n\r\n   OUR FRIENDS INVESTIGATE NIKOLA TESLA'S INVENTION FOR THE\r\n   WIRELESS TRANSMISSION OF POWER, BY WHICH HE HOPES TO ENCIRCLE\r\n   THE EARTH WITH LIMITLESS ELECTRICAL POWER, MAKE OCEAN AND AIR\r\n   TRAVEL ABSOLUTELY SAFE, AND REVOLUTIONIZE LAND TRAFFIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How would you like to send a signal clear through the earth with\r\nyour wireless outfit and get it back again on your receiving\r\ninstrument as clear and strong as at first, just about the same way\r\nyou hear the echo of your voice when it rebounds from a mountainside\r\nor a big building?\" asked the scientist one day while his young\r\nfriend was telling him about his amateur wireless experiments.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how I could,\" answered the boy.\r\n\r\n\"No, of course you don't,\" said the boy's friend, \"for it took Nikola\r\nTesla, 'the wizard of electricity' almost a lifetime to work out\r\nthe invention by which he could do that, but if you like we will\r\ngo and see Doctor Tesla and ask him to tell us about his wonderful\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\"You see this is a series of inventions by Tesla, and wireless\r\ntelegraphy is only a small part of it. You remember the other day\r\nyou told me of having read about aeroplanes equipped with wireless.\r\nJust think, Tesla's invention will make it possible for airships to\r\nbe propelled and operated all by electricity sent without wires. The\r\nwhole broad plan is called the wireless transmission of power, and\r\nthat simply means that electricity can be transmitted without wires\r\nfor all the uses we now have for it, as well as for a number of\r\nentirely new and hitherto unknown devices.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was delighted with the prospect of seeing the great scientist\r\nTesla, about whom he had read so much, and began to ask his older\r\nfriend a thousand questions about the man, his work and life.\r\n\r\nIt was a good many days before the whole thing had been talked over,\r\nand the boy understood the series of inventions, but we will follow\r\nthrough a part of our scientist's explanation and the visit to\r\nTesla's laboratory and plant.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tesla's plan is one of the most astounding ever proposed\r\nby science, it has been proved possible by experiments of such\r\nhair-raising nature that the inventor has been called a \"daredevil\"\r\na \"demon in electricity\" and a \"dreamer of dynamic dreams.\" In his\r\nexperiments he has produced electrical currents of a voltage higher\r\neven than the bolts of lightning we see cleaving the sky during the\r\nworst thunderstorms. These currents he has harnessed to his own use\r\nand made them tell him the inmost secrets of the earth--in fact of\r\nthe palpitation at the very core of the globe--the heartbeats of our\r\nsphere. He has given exhibitions in which he has caused currents\r\nof inconceivably high power to play about his head as if they\r\nwere gentle summer breezes, and while working in the mountains of\r\nColorado, he has brought forth electrical discharges which caused\r\ndisturbances in the wireless telegraph apparatus in all parts of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIn short, Nikola Tesla plans to make artificial lightning, and so\r\nharness it to the use of man, that it can be sent anywhere on or\r\nabove the earth, without wires.\r\n\r\nTo scientists and electrical engineers, Tesla's plan offers a field\r\nfor limitless study and discussion, but to the boy who is interested\r\nin electricity it offers one of the most fascinating subjects for\r\nreading and thinking in all the realm of science. Just reflect that\r\nwith the wireless transmission of power, and the development of an\r\nart that Tesla calls \"telautomatics,\" the navigators of wireless\r\npower-driven airships and ocean liners will know their exact speed,\r\nposition, altitude, direction, the time of night or day, and\r\nwhether there is anything in their path, all through the wireless\r\n\"telautomatic\" devices for registering such impressions.\r\n\r\nTesla declares that the terrible _Titanic_ disaster never would have\r\noccurred had his system been in effect last April, for he declares\r\nthat the _Titanic's_ captain would have known of the iceberg he was\r\napproaching long enough in advance to slacken speed and get out of\r\nits way. Moreover, he declares that with the wireless transmission of\r\npower, the wireless telegraph becomes a very simple matter, and that\r\nimmediately after the accident, had the ship struck an obstacle in\r\nspite of warnings, the captain could have been in wireless telephone\r\ncommunication with his offices in London and New York, and with all\r\nthe ships that were on the seas in the vicinity of the ill-fated\r\nliner.\r\n\r\nBut making air and sea navigation safe, sure, and speedy, are only\r\nthe first steps Tesla intends to take in the wireless transmission of\r\npower. After that he hopes to light the earth--to carry a beautiful\r\nsoft bright light to ranchmen far out on the deserts, to miners\r\nin their cabins or deep in the earth, to farmers, and to sailors,\r\nas well as to people in their homes in the cities all over the\r\nworld--Australia as well as the United States.\r\n\r\nWireless electrical power, according to Tesla, will be one of the\r\ngreatest agencies in war, if there is any, but it first will be an\r\nargument for universal peace. \"Fights,\" says the inventor, \"whether\r\nbetween individuals or between nations arise from misunderstandings,\r\nand with the complete dissemination of intelligence, constant\r\ncommunication, and familiarity with the ideals of other nations,\r\nthat international combativeness so dangerous to world peace, will\r\ndisappear.\"\r\n\r\nIf Tesla's plan were carried out in full it would completely\r\nrevolutionize the industries of the world, for all the power of\r\nNiagara or any other waterfall in the world could be sent without\r\nwires to turn the wheels of the industries in China or Australia,\r\nwhile the power of the Zambesi Falls in Africa could be transmitted\r\nto run trains, subways, elevateds, and all other forms of industry in\r\nthe United States. There is practically no limit to the possibilities\r\nof the scheme, because through Tesla's invention, distance means\r\nnothing, and the power instead of losing force with distance as is\r\nthe case when power is transmitted through wires, retains practically\r\nthe same voltage as at the outset.\r\n\r\nWe will visit Doctor Tesla at his office and laboratory in the\r\nMetropolitan Tower in New York with the scientist and his young\r\nfriend to see what kind of a man it is who has invented machines for\r\ncreating and handling such tremendous voltages.\r\n\r\nTesla sits at a wide flat-topped desk in the centre of his sunny\r\noffice surrounded by books, a few models of inventions, and a few\r\npictures of some of his most remarkable electrical experiments. He is\r\nvery tall and slight, with a mass of black hair thrown back from his\r\nintellectual forehead. His piercing gray eyes sparkle as he smiles\r\nin greeting, and his thin pointed face lights up with an expression\r\nof pleasure and kindness that cannot help but make the great\r\nelectrician's visitors feel that he is a good friend. Although he\r\nwas naturalized more than twenty years ago, and has been an American\r\ncitizen ever since, his English still shows some slight traces of\r\nhis foreign birth. He looks no more than forty-odd and he is as\r\ninterested in everything that is going on in the world as a young\r\nboy, but he has passed his fiftieth year.\r\n\r\n\"For all that I am something of a boy still myself,\" says the\r\ninventor. \"You see I could work for the present generation to make\r\nmoney. Of course that's all right, but I don't care what the present\r\ngeneration thinks of me. It is the growing generation--the boys of\r\nto-day that I want to work for, because they will live in an age\r\nwhen the world has advanced far enough in science to understand some\r\nof the deeper mysteries of electricity. The boys of to-day are the\r\ngreat scientists of to-morrow, and it is to them that I dedicate my\r\ngreatest efforts.\"\r\n\r\nAll his life Tesla has been working with an eye to the future as well\r\nas to the present, and some of his inventions probably will be far\r\nbetter appreciated in twenty years than they are now, although to\r\nTesla we owe our thanks for some of the most important electrical\r\nmachinery in use at the present time.\r\n\r\nAs an inventor Tesla is best known as a pioneer in high tension\r\ncurrents. It was he who introduced to the world the great principle\r\nof the alternating current, as up to the time he carried out his\r\nexperiments only the direct current was used. Indeed, more than four\r\nmillion horsepower of waterfalls are harnessed by Tesla's alternating\r\ncurrent system. That is the same as forty millions of untiring men\r\nworking without pay, consuming no food, shelter or raiment while\r\nlabouring to provide for our wants. In these days of conservation,\r\nit is interesting to note that this electrical energy derived from\r\nwater power saves a hundred million tons of coal every year. Our\r\ntrolley roads, our subways, many of our electrified railroads, the\r\nincandescent lamps in our homes and offices, all use a system of\r\npower transmission of this man's invention.\r\n\r\nAs said before Tesla is a naturalized American citizen. He was\r\nborn in Smiljan, Lika, on the Austro-Hungarian border, in 1857. He\r\ncame by his scientific and inventive turn of mind naturally, for\r\nhis father was an intellectual Greek clergyman, and his mother,\r\nGeorgia Mandic, was an inventor herself as was her father before\r\nher. The boy attended the public schools of Lika and Croatia, where\r\nhe was a leader among his playmates in sports where imagination and\r\nmechanical skill were required. There are marvellous tales of the\r\ningenuity of Tesla while a schoolboy, but with all his play he was\r\na serious-minded student, and went through the Polytechnic in Gratz\r\nand the University of Prague in Bohemia with honours. While in the\r\nPolytechnic, Tesla saw the defects of some of the machinery that was\r\nused in the laboratory, and made suggestions for its improvement.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing college Tesla began his practical career in Budapest\r\nas an electrical engineer in 1881. His first invention followed soon\r\nafter in the form of a telephone repeater. He continued in electrical\r\nengineering in Paris until 1884, when he came to the United States.\r\nHis first employment in America was with The Edison Company at\r\nOrange, N. J., but in 1887 he went into business for himself as an\r\nelectrical engineer. From that time on he has been an important\r\nfigure in the scientific world. He has made many addresses before\r\nvarious gatherings of experts and has written numerous papers on\r\nscientific subjects for the magazines. Of course the bulk of his time\r\nhas been given to his inventions and the necessary research therefor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING\r\n\r\n  The electrical discharge of this Tesla oscillator created flames\r\n  70 feet across, under the pressure of 12,000,000 volts and a\r\n  current alternating 130,000 times per second.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DR. NIKOLA TESLA\r\n\r\n  Wizard of electricity, and inventor of the wireless transmission\r\n  of power.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DOCTOR TESLA'S FIRST POWER PLANT\r\n\r\n  From this oscillator Doctor Tesla sends out the electrical waves\r\n  with which he hopes to revolutionize industry.]\r\n\r\nThroughout his life Tesla has been more interested in the adventurous\r\nand scientific side of electricity than the commercial side, and all\r\nof his inventions smack of the marvellous. To name all his inventions\r\nwould be almost like giving a list of the machines and devices that\r\nmark man's progress in the use of electricity. His invention\r\nfor the alternating current dynamo, for instance, brought forth\r\nan entirely new principle, while his rotating magnetic field made\r\npossible the transmission of alternating currents from large power\r\nplants over great distances and is very extensively used to-day.\r\nHigh power dynamos, transformers, induction coils, oscillators, and\r\nvarious kinds of electric lamps all came in for his attention.\r\n\r\nHe became one of the foremost authorities on high tension currents\r\nand in 1889 invented a system of electrical conversion and\r\ndistribution by oscillatory discharges which was a step toward his\r\ngreat goal, the wireless transmission of power. He was very near the\r\nprize when in 1893 he announced a system of wireless transmission\r\nof intelligence. His studies continued and finally, in 1897, he\r\nannounced his famous high potential transmitter by which he claimed\r\nto be able to send power through the earth without wires. The art\r\nof telautomatics announced in 1899 was really a part of Tesla's\r\ninvention for the wireless transmission of power, for the plan was\r\nto control such objects, for instance, as airships or boats, from a\r\ndistance by electricity transmitted without wires.\r\n\r\nThrough that marvellous invention the boat or aeroplane dispatcher,\r\nsitting before a complex little wireless dispatching board could send\r\nhis craft, at any speed, at any height, in perfect safety, and with\r\nexact precision to the place or port he desired it to go. It would\r\nnot be necessary for the dispatcher ever to see the craft he was\r\ndirecting, for his instruments would show him everything in regard to\r\nits speed, direction, and location; nor yet would it be necessary for\r\na craft to have a crew aboard, for all the operations in connection\r\nwith sending it from one place to another would be controlled\r\nperfectly by telautomatics.\r\n\r\nSuch are the almost inconceivable inventions of Nikola Tesla.\r\n\"Sometimes they call me a dreamer,\" says Tesla, \"because I do not\r\ncapitalize these inventions, start in manufacturing and make a big\r\nfortune. That is not what I care to do. I want to go further in this\r\ngreat mystery of wireless power, and if I am busy making money I\r\ncannot devote my best abilities to inventions that will be in use\r\nwhen the next generation is grown.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us try to fathom the mysteries of Tesla's scheme for the\r\ntransmission of electric energy without wires. In the first place we\r\nmust not try to think of it as being on the same basis as the radio,\r\nor Hertzian wireless telegraph, for, although the modern developments\r\nof the wireless telegraph take into consideration the central theory\r\nof Tesla's invention, they are not at all the same in their practical\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nTesla's theory is based entirely on his discovery of what he calls\r\nstationary electrical earth waves which he sets in motion with his\r\nhigh potential magnifying transmitter, an electrical apparatus of\r\ntremendous power.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us remember the three essential departments of Tesla's\r\nidea for world telegraphy, world telephony, and world transmission of\r\npower for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the power is created by Niagara or some other great\r\nwaterfall--\"white coal\" as it is picturesquely called by many\r\nengineers--the first necessities are a transformer and a transmitter\r\nthat will send the electrical energy, thus gathered, into the earth\r\nand air. The next necessity is a receiving instrument that will\r\nrecord the impulse, whether it be a voice, a telegraph click, or\r\nseveral million volts for driving factory wheels or lighting houses.\r\nLastly, it is necessary to tune the currents so that millions of\r\ndifferent impulses can be sent without causing confusion between\r\nthem. In other words, there must be departments for sending,\r\nreceiving and \"individualizing.\"\r\n\r\nTo ask Doctor Tesla to tell us the whole story of this invention\r\nwould be to ask him to tell us in detail the whole history of his\r\nlife work--and that would take several volumes, for he is one of\r\nthose men who have worked incessantly, day and night, sacrificing\r\nhimself and overcoming his natural desire for leisure and amusement.\r\nIt all started, Tesla explains, when he was a very small boy. He was\r\ntroubled at that time with a strange habit. Whenever any one would\r\nmention a thing to him, a vision of the object immediately would\r\ncome before his eyes. He declares that this was very troublesome,\r\nand that as he grew older he tried to overcome it, thinking it some\r\nstrange malady. With an effort he learned how to banish the images\r\nby putting them from his mind. On inquiring into the cause of the\r\nvisions, the young scientist's penetrating brain brought him to the\r\nconclusion that every time he saw a vision, some time previous he had\r\nseen something to remind him of the object. The tracing back of the\r\ncause of his vision so frequently caused it to become a mental habit,\r\nand he declares that for many years he has done it automatically, and\r\nthat he has been able to trace the cause of nearly every impression,\r\neven including his dreams. Reflecting on these things, as a mature\r\nscientist, Tesla came to the conclusion that he was an automaton,\r\nresponding automatically to impressions registered on his senses from\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\n\"Why couldn't I make a mechanical automaton that would represent me\r\nin every way, except thought?\" he asked himself. The answer to the\r\nquestion which came only after years of study and experiment was the\r\nart of \"telautomatics,\" which Tesla declares can be developed just as\r\nsoon as the wireless transmission of power is an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his research into the realm of high tension currents\r\nTesla reached the stage where it was no longer safe nor convenient\r\nto experiment in the centres of population. Moreover, he desired to\r\nmake a study of the action of lightning. Colorado, with its vast\r\nstretches of uninhabited plains and mountains, offered an ideal place\r\nfor his laboratory, particularly because the high, dry climate of\r\nthat state brings forth some of the worst electrical storms seen\r\nin the United States. Consequently, in the spring of 1899, Tesla\r\nbuilt an experiment station on the plateau that extends from the\r\nfront range of the Rocky Mountains to Colorado Springs, and began\r\nthe experiments through which the secret with which he hopes to\r\nrevolutionize the communication and transportation systems of the\r\nworld, was revealed to him.\r\n\r\nBesides his high power alternating current dynamo, Tesla set up an\r\nelectrical oscillator with which he hoped to send out electrical\r\nwaves, through the earth and air, that would prove to him the\r\npossibility of an extensive system of wireless communication,\r\nand telautomatic, or wireless control of airships, projectiles,\r\nsteamships, etc. In his early experiments he used the oscillator at\r\nlow tension, but as his success became more marked he increased the\r\ntension, until the oscillator was giving twelve million volts, and\r\nthe current was alternating a hundred thousand times a second.\r\n\r\nIn regard to these high tension experiments in Colorado and\r\nelsewhere, Doctor Tesla said, \"I have produced electrical\r\noscillations which were of such intensity that when circulating\r\nthrough my arms and chest they have melted wires which have joined\r\nmy hands, and still I have felt no inconvenience. I have energized,\r\nwith such oscillations, a loop of heavy copper wire so powerfully\r\nthat masses of metal placed within the loop were heated to a high\r\ntemperature and melted, often with the violence of an explosion. And\r\nyet, into this space in which this terribly destructive turmoil was\r\ngoing on I have repeatedly thrust my head without feeling anything or\r\nexperiencing injurious after effects.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier experiments, which in themselves were wonderful\r\nenough, were the transmission of an electrical current through one\r\nwire without return, to light several incandescent lamps. Advancing\r\nfurther along the trail of wireless transmission of power, Tesla\r\nlighted the lamps without any wire connection between them and his\r\ntransmitter.\r\n\r\nThe oscillator, though simple in its construction, is one of the\r\nmost wonderful of all electrical devices. \"You see,\" said Doctor\r\nTesla, \"all that is necessary is a high power alternating dynamo\r\nwhich generates a tremendous alternating current. For our oscillator\r\nproper, we make a few turns of a stout cable around a cylindrical\r\nor drum-shaped form, and connect its two ends with the source of\r\nelectrical energy. Then, inside the big cable, or primary coil, we\r\nwind a lighter wire in spiral form. One end of the secondary coil\r\nis sunk into the ground and connected with a plate, and the other is\r\nerected in the air. When the current is turned on, our oscillator\r\nsends these electrical impulses into the earth and air--or, as the\r\nscientists say, into the natural media. These oscillations create\r\nelectrical waves and affect any device that is tuned to them--but\r\n(and this is very important) no device that is not tuned to them.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing the explanation of his high tension experiments, Tesla\r\ntells us that the awe-inspiring electrical display, of which there\r\nis a picture on page 136, was made by his oscillator which created\r\nan alternate movement of electricity from the earth into a hollow\r\nmetal reservoir and back at a speed of 100,000 alternations a second.\r\nThe reservoir is already filled to overflowing with electricity and\r\nas the current is sent back to it at each alternation the terrific\r\nforce makes it burst forth with a deafening roar, as great as the\r\nheaviest lightning detonation. The electric flames shoot out in every\r\ndirection searching for something on which they may alight, just as\r\nlightning sent from the clouds searches for a conductor upon which\r\nit may alight and escape into the earth. The induction coils in the\r\npicture are tuned to these tremendous electrical explosions, and the\r\nflames shoot direct to them, a distance of 22 feet.\r\n\r\nThe flames shooting from the coil of the oscillator pictured on page\r\n164 were nearly 70 feet across, represented twelve million volts\r\nof electricity, and a current alternating 130,000 times a second.\r\nThese hair-raising experiments created such electrical disturbances\r\nthat it was possible to draw great sparks more than an inch long,\r\nfrom water plugs over 300 feet from the laboratory. One of the\r\nmost marvellous things about these experiments is that any human\r\nbeing could remain in the vicinity. The absolute safety of these\r\ndischarges when properly harnessed is well illustrated in the picture\r\nshown there as the man seen amidst the flames felt no ill effects\r\nfrom his experience, simply because this power was so thoroughly\r\nharnessed by the wizard Tesla, that it could go only to the device\r\ntuned to receive it. Every boy is familiar with stories of lightning\r\nstriking one person, but yet leaving another person right next to him\r\nunharmed. Such is the action of Tesla's high tension currents, only\r\nhe directs them by induction just as he wants them to go.\r\n\r\n\"But this is just like lightning!\" exclaimed the boy.\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" calmly answered Doctor Tesla with a smile. \"I have often\r\nproduced electrical oscillations even greater than the energy of\r\nlightning discharges.\"\r\n\r\nThese experiments were marvellous enough, but they were surpassed in\r\na short time by his famous discovery of July 3, 1899, which showed\r\nhim that he could send his wireless waves to the opposite side of the\r\nearth just as well as a hundred feet away.\r\n\r\nThis revelation, as the scientist calls it, came about through\r\nhis study of lightning. The scientist had set up in his Colorado\r\nlaboratory many delicate electrical instruments to register various\r\ndifferent electrical effects. Tesla noticed, however, that strangely\r\nenough his instruments were just as violently affected by distant\r\nelectrical storms as by nearby disturbances.\r\n\r\n\"One night when meditating over these facts,\" said Tesla, \"I was\r\nsuddenly staggered by a thought. The same thing had presented itself\r\nto me years ago; but I had then dismissed it as impossible. And that\r\nnight when it recurred to me I banished it again. Nevertheless, my\r\ninstinct was aroused, and somehow I felt that I was nearing a great\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\n\"As you know, it was on the third of July that I obtained the first\r\ndefinite evidence of a truth of overwhelming importance for the\r\nadvancement of humanity. A dense mass of strongly charged clouds\r\ngathered in the west, and toward evening a violent storm broke loose\r\nwhich, after spending much of its fury in the mountains, was driven\r\naway with great velocity over the plains. Heavy and long persisting\r\narcs formed almost at regular intervals of time. My observations were\r\nnow greatly facilitated and rendered more accurate by the records\r\nalready made. I was able to handle my instruments quickly, and was\r\nprepared. The recording apparatus being properly adjusted, its\r\nindications became fainter and fainter with the increasing distance\r\nof the storm, until they ceased altogether. I was watching in eager\r\nexpectation. Sure enough, in a little while the indications again\r\nbegan, grew stronger, gradually decreased, and ceased once more.\r\nMany times, in regularly recurring intervals, the same actions were\r\nrepeated, until the storm, as evident from simple computations,\r\nwith nearly constant speed had retreated to a distance of about two\r\nhundred miles. Nor did these strange actions stop then, but continued\r\nto manifest themselves with undiminished force.\r\n\r\n\"When I made this discovery I was utterly astounded. I could\r\nnot believe what I had seen was really true. It was too great a\r\nrevelation of Nature to accept immediately and unhesitatingly.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Tesla had discovered, and soon announced to the scientific\r\nworld, was the existence of stationary terrestrial waves of\r\nelectricity, and its meaning was that an impulse sent into the\r\nearth was carried on these waves to the other side of the earth and\r\nrebounded without any loss of power. He had, in fact, discovered and\r\nturned to man's use the very heartbeats of our earth.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever electricity may be,\" he continued, \"it is a fact that\r\nit acts like a fluid, and in this connection, we may consider the\r\nearth as a great hollow ball filled with electricity.\" He goes on to\r\nexplain that when an impulse is sent into this ball of electricity it\r\nproceeds to the opposite wall of the earth in waves and, finding no\r\noutlet it returns to the place it started, but in a series of waves\r\nexactly the opposite of the outgoing ones, so that the two cross and\r\ndiverge at regular intervals as indicated in the diagram.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A--Oscillator\r\n\r\n  B--Opposite side of earth\r\n\r\n  C--Waves in nodal and ventral intervals.]\r\n\r\nAs Tesla put it, \"The outgoing and returning currents clash and form\r\nnodes and loops similar to those observable on a vibrating cord.\"\r\nTesla figured from these experiments that the waves varied from 25 to\r\n70 kilometres from node to node, that they could be sent to any part\r\nof the globe, and that they could be sent in varying lengths up to\r\nthe extreme diameter of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove his discovery Tesla sent an impulse into the\r\nearth, and received it back, on his delicate instrument, in a few\r\nseconds. \"It is like an echo,\" he explained. \"When you shout and\r\nin a few seconds hear your voice coming back, you do not think it\r\nis another voice but know immediately that it is simply your own\r\nvocal vibrations reflected by the house, mountainside, or what not.\r\nIt is just the same with an electrical vibration. The stationary\r\nterrestrial wave goes through the earth, reaches the other side and,\r\nfinding no outlet, is reflected without any loss of power. Indeed, in\r\nsome cases it is returned with greater power than at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in your system the wireless electrical current passes through\r\nthe earth, and not through the air,\" interrupted the scientist.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, \"it passes through both. It is difficult to\r\nunderstand the big things about electricity, but just think of the\r\nearth as a great ball filled with electricity, as I said before.\r\nThink of the tower of the oscillator as a tube, and of the great\r\nmushroom-shaped top of the plant as another ball. Now from our\r\ngreat alternating current dynamo we first fill the ball at the top\r\nof the oscillator with electricity, and then we make a motion that\r\ncorresponds to squeezing it. What happens? Just what happens when\r\nyou have two rubber balls connected with a tube. You squeeze one of\r\nthem, and push the air, or water, into the other ball. In that way\r\nwe push the electricity into the earth, but it comes back to us on\r\nthe stationary waves, from the opposite side, and when it does we are\r\nready to give it another mighty push with another tremendous squeeze\r\nfrom our dynamo. When this is going on the top of the oscillator is\r\ngathering electricity from the air all the time and sending it out to\r\nbe used wherever there is a receiver properly tuned to receive these\r\nrates of vibration.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" again asked our friend, \"isn't there a great deal of valuable\r\nelectrical power wasted in that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there is very little waste,\" answered the electrician, \"for\r\nthis reason: If, for instance, our oscillator can generate a hundred\r\nthousand or a million, or any other number of volts, and we only wish\r\nto use it for some small purpose on the other side of the earth,\r\nthe receiver at the antipodes takes as much power as is needed, and\r\nthe rest remains unused and our oscillator can be run at reduced\r\ncapacity.\"\r\n\r\nThus, according to Tesla's plan, the electrical energy will be sent\r\ninto the earth and air by the high potential magnifying transmitter\r\nor oscillator, the stationary electrical waves carry it through the\r\nearth and the receiving instrument on the other side of the world\r\ncollects the energy to put it to a thousand and one purposes of\r\nmankind. And do not forget that the oscillator and the receiving\r\ninstrument are so tuned to each other that there is no danger,\r\naccording to Tesla's scheme, of different oscillators and receivers\r\ngetting mixed up.\r\n\r\nBefore Tesla had discovered the stationary electrical waves he had\r\ngone deep into the mystery of the \"individualization\" of electrical\r\nimpulses, and as a result advanced plans for sending a number of\r\nmessages over one wire without their interfering with each other.\r\nThis study was continued with even greater energy, after he had taken\r\nthe first steps toward the realization of his world telegraphy and\r\nworld telephony without wires. In wireless telegraphy as we know its\r\npractice to-day, one of the serious drawbacks is the interference\r\nof other operators, both amateur and professional, with important\r\nmessages. Tesla holds that the simple tuning of instruments to one\r\nanother as is done nowadays would not be sufficient, when there\r\nwere millions of currents passing through and around the earth.\r\nFor instance, he says that an instrument tuned to a single rate\r\nof vibrations would be very apt to come into contact with another\r\ninstrument sending at the same rate. Of course the confusion so\r\nfamiliar in modern radio-telegraphy would result. Moreover, it makes\r\nit difficult to send messages that cannot be intercepted and read by\r\nevery wireless operator in hearing. \"This can be avoided,\" continues\r\nthe inventor, \"by combining different tones or rates of vibration.\r\nIn actual practice it is found that by combining only two tones, a\r\ndegree of privacy sufficient for most purposes is attained. When\r\nthree vibrations are combined it is extremely difficult even for a\r\nskilled expert to read or disturb signals not intended for him. It is\r\nvain to undertake to 'cut in on' a series of wireless impulses made\r\nup of four different rates of vibration. The probability of getting\r\nthe secret of the combination is as slight as of your solving the\r\nnumber combination on the door of a safe. From experiments I have\r\nconcluded that this individualization will allow the transmission of\r\nseveral million different messages. It is interesting when you think\r\nthat one world telegraphy plant would have a greater capacity than\r\nall the ocean cables combined.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the amount of power to be transmitted, Tesla points out\r\nthat an impulse of low voltage, or low horsepower, will carry to the\r\nother side of the earth without any loss of power, just as easily\r\nas a high voltage current. \"A wire,\" says Tesla, \"offers certain\r\nresistance to an electrical current causing some loss, but not so\r\nwhen it is sent through the natural media. The earth is a conducting\r\nbody of such enormous dimensions that there is virtually no loss,\r\nso that distance means nothing. To the average intelligence this\r\nwill appear incomprehensible. We are continuously confronted with\r\nlimitations, and those truths which are contradicted by our senses\r\nare the hardest to grasp. For example, one of the most difficult\r\ntasks was to satisfy the human mind that the earth rotated round the\r\nsun; for to the eye it seemed just the opposite.\"\r\n\r\nTesla further pointed out that five-hundred miles is about the\r\nfarthest that high power can be transmitted by wires with complete\r\nsuccess, but that without wires, by his system, power can be\r\ntransmitted, as we have seen, to any part of the globe or the\r\natmosphere about it.\r\n\r\nThe plan for a world-wide system of wireless telegraphs and\r\ntelephones differs considerably from the original idea laid down by\r\nscientists for radio or Hertzian wireless telegraphy. Originally\r\nGuglielmo Marconi, who first successfully telegraphed without wires,\r\nand whose system is well known all over the world, planned to send\r\nhis electrical impulses through the ether, in the form of Hertzian\r\nrays, but later the method was amended. The theory advanced was that\r\nsince everything is afloat in the colourless, intangible something\r\ncalled ether (not the drug used as an anæsthetic), and that since\r\nwaves of light, heat, and electricity travel through ether, it\r\nwould be possible to send electrical impulses through the ether in\r\nthe earth and air, just as well as through the ether in a copper\r\nwire. In his early experiments Marconi used the light rays or waves\r\nnamed after their discoverer, Hertz, but these were found to be\r\nvery limited, so electrical vibrations of a higher intensity were\r\nsubstituted, as we shall see in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n\"From the very first,\" declared Tesla, \"my system has been based on\r\na different principle, as you can see from what I have told you.\r\nFor instance, my invention takes no consideration of light rays\r\nin any visible or invisible form (and Hertzian rays are invisible\r\nlight), which can only travel in a straight line. Hence, you can\r\nsee that they could not be used except as far as could be seen. In\r\nother words, they only could be used as far as the horizon, for\r\njust as soon as the curve of the earth's surface took the receiving\r\ninstrument below the level of the Hertzian waves they became\r\nineffective. You see the difference is that my system is based on the\r\nstationary earth waves, along which the electrical currents can pass\r\nto any distance irrespective of horizon, or matter.\"\r\n\r\nA simple explanation will serve to show the principle of Tesla's\r\ntheory of wireless telegraphy and telephony. We can easily think of\r\na reservoir with two openings in the cover filled with some fluid.\r\nIn each of these openings is a piston and above each piston is a\r\ntuning fork. The two tuning forks must be of exactly the same tone\r\nor the experiment will not work. We strike one of the pistons with\r\nthe tuning fork, and continue to strike it until the fork sets up\r\nvibrations. The vibrations pass through the air, and also communicate\r\nvibrations to the piston, which in turn passes the vibrations on\r\nto the fluid in the reservoir. These vibrations naturally continue\r\nthrough the reservoir, as waves, just the same as when we throw a\r\npebble into a calm pond and watch the waves radiate out in every\r\ndirection. The water does not advance, but merely moves up and down.\r\nThe waves, however, advance. So with the waves set up by the tuning\r\nfork, and they set up an oscillation of the piston at the other side,\r\nagitating the tuning fork in unison with the sound vibrations coming\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\nIt is just the same, declares Tesla, with two of his oscillators set\r\nup on the earth's surface and tapping the great sea of electricity,\r\nwhich he says is in the earth. The oscillators correspond to the\r\ntuning forks, the reservoir to the earth, and the fluid in the\r\nreservoir to the electrical currents with which he says the interior\r\nof the earth is alive. Exactly attuned, Tesla says, the vibrations\r\nset up by the sender will be communicated to the receiver through the\r\nearth and through the air.\r\n\r\n\"Now, with the development of the world system,\" continued Tesla, \"we\r\nshall be able to telephone without wires just as well as telegraph,\r\nand to any part of the world just as easily as we now talk to a\r\nfriend in an adjoining house over the modern wire circuits.\"\r\n\r\nBefore going with Doctor Tesla to his great plant out on Long Island\r\nto see how he is carrying on these tremendous theories of his, the\r\nboy asked him a few more questions about them, for it is a big and\r\nintricate question.\r\n\r\n\"What application will you first make of the wireless transmission of\r\npower?\"\r\n\r\n\"My first concern,\" replied the magician of electricity, \"will be to\r\nmake air and water navigation safe. We have plenty of demonstrations\r\nof the value of the wireless telegraph in saving human lives when\r\nships are in danger, in the _Republic_ and _Titanic_ disasters. But\r\nalso we know that the wireless can be greatly improved upon. With\r\na perfect system of communication, both by wireless telegraph and\r\ntelephone, consider what it would mean to the navigators of air and\r\nocean craft.\r\n\r\n\"By the art of telautomatics, which is a part of the broad scheme\r\nfor the wireless transmission of power, many of the worst dangers\r\nof air and water navigation will be avoided, which is right in line\r\nwith the modern tendency of preventing trouble rather than waiting\r\nfor it to happen before remedying it.\" He then went on to enumerate\r\nthe various telautomatic devices that will be carried by ocean liners\r\nand airships of the future, as mentioned in the early part of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\"Just for instance, how could telautomatics have saved the\r\n_Titanic_?\" the inventor was asked.\r\n\r\n\"You understand, of course,\" answered Tesla, \"that the devices I\r\npropose would be of almost inconceivable sensitiveness. They would\r\nbe the centre of electrical waves, and, as soon as the iceberg got\r\ninto the path of these waves from the wireless transmission plant to\r\nthe ship, it would cause the electricity to register an impression\r\nof danger ahead. Of course mariners would become so expert in the\r\nreading of these danger signals that they could tell the meaning of\r\neach one, and alter their course or reverse their engines according\r\nto the needs of the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much have you accomplished in telautomatics at this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have made a little submarine boat that will answer to every\r\nnecessary impulse. The boat contained its own motive power in a\r\nstorage battery and gear for propulsion, steering sidewise, or upward\r\nor downward, and all other accessories necessary for its operation.\r\nAll of these were worked from a distance by wireless impulses, sent\r\nby an oscillator to the circuit in the boat through which magnets and\r\nother devices operated the interior mechanism.\r\n\r\n\"This proved to me the possibility of a high development of\r\ntelautomatics. When my system is complete, a crewless ship may be\r\nsent from any port in the world to any other port propelled by\r\nwireless energy from a power plant anywhere on the face of the earth,\r\nand controlled absolutely by telautomatics.\"\r\n\r\nTesla's plan for aerial navigation is even more startling than that\r\nfor crewless ocean liners. He thinks that the airships of the future\r\nwill be propelled by wireless power and that they will have, neither\r\nplanes nor other supporting surfaces, such as we are so familiar with\r\nnowadays. Neither will they be supported by gas bags like balloons\r\nand dirigibles. The inventor thinks they will be compact and just\r\nas airworthy as ocean liners are seaworthy. They will be tightly\r\nenclosed, so that the terrific rush of air through the high altitudes\r\nwill not strangle the passengers and crew. He sees no reason why the\r\nairships of the future should not travel at a rate of several hundred\r\nmiles an hour, so that you could leave San Francisco in the morning\r\nand be in New York in time for a six o'clock dinner, and the theatre,\r\nor cross the Atlantic in a night.\r\n\r\n\"How will these airships be propelled?\" the boy asked.\r\n\r\n\"By engines driven with power supplied by our great oscillator\r\nwherever we care to erect it. These engines will work with such\r\nincredible force that they will make of the air above them a\r\nveritable rope to sustain them at any desired altitude, while they\r\nwill make of the air in front of them a rope to pull them forward at\r\na high rate of speed.\" Tesla continues to say that these ships can be\r\nmade just as large as it is practicable to make their landing stages,\r\nor small enough for one or two passengers.\r\n\r\nIn the waterfalls of the United States alone, he pointed out, there\r\nare twenty-five hundred million horsepower of electrical energy.\r\nNiagara Falls could supply more than one fifth of all the power now\r\nused in this country, he says. Moreover, none of the great sites,\r\nsuch as those in the far Northwest, are developed to their highest\r\nstate, because of the difficulty in transmitting the power over long\r\ndistances to where it is used.\r\n\r\n\"It must be borne in mind,\" said Tesla, \"that electrical energy\r\nobtained by harnessing a waterfall is probably fifty times more\r\neffective than fuel energy. Since this is the most perfect way of\r\nrendering the sun's energy available the direction of the future\r\nmaterial development of man is clearly indicated. He will live on\r\n'white coal.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Tesla, can you tell us, please, just how far you have\r\ndeveloped this invention for the wireless transmission of power?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered the electrical inventor, \"the best way to tell\r\nyou is to show you what has been done so far.\" In order to see\r\nTesla's great plant we must follow the scientist and his boy friend\r\nout to Bay Shore, L. I., where, overlooking Long Island Sound,\r\nwe see a great mushroom-shaped steel network tower surmounting a\r\nlow building--the first of Tesla's many proposed high potential\r\nmagnifying transmitters.\r\n\r\n\"So far,\" said Tesla of his power plant where the first attempts\r\nat wireless transmission are being made, \"only about three million\r\nhorsepower has been harnessed by my system of alternating current\r\ntransmission. This is little, but it corresponds nevertheless\r\nto adding to the world's population sixty million indefatigable\r\nlaborers, working virtually without food or pay.\"\r\n\r\nAs the boy approached the power plant he was impressed by the great\r\nsize of the tower and its circular top, as shown in the photograph.\r\nIt is this circular top, with its conductive apparatus, that gathers\r\nthe electricity from the air and from the dynamo, and sends it forth\r\nin great waves both through the air and through the earth. The tower\r\nis 185 feet high, from the ground to the top, and from the ground to\r\nthe edge of the cupola it is 153 feet. The diameter of the cupola\r\nfloor is 65 feet. The cupola can be reached by both a staircase and\r\nan elevator, but it would hardly be healthy for any one to be within\r\nthe network of electrical conductors when the plant was working.\r\nInside the building are the high power alternating dynamos and\r\nunderneath it extends the ground wire from the cupola, through which\r\nthe electricity is pumped into the ground in great spurts at the rate\r\nof more than a hundred thousand spurts a second. At this plant Tesla\r\nplans to gather and concentrate millions of horsepower of electrical\r\nenergy and then, in the ways we have seen, send it out to be used in\r\na thousand different ways.\r\n\r\n\"This is merely an experiment,\" declared Tesla. \"We can telegraph\r\nand carry on other such operations as require only a small amount of\r\npower from here, but it is nothing compared to the great power plants\r\nwe will erect in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it necessary,\" asked the boy, \"to have your power plant erected\r\nnear the waterfall, or other means of producing the electricity?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not. This plant, for instance, can be made a great\r\nreceiving station for electric power from all the great\r\nhydro-electric sites, and from it we hope to be able to send out\r\nelectrical waves that will run our ships, airships, trains and street\r\ncars, carry our voices, light our houses, and turn the wheels of our\r\nfactories. It is better, however, to have the plants located close to\r\nthe seats of power, and to have a greater number of plants.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much horsepower did you say this plant would send out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a mere trifle of three million horsepower, but of course this\r\nis only an experiment. To be done properly the thing must be done on\r\na large scale, and the time will come--not necessarily remote--when\r\nwe will be carrying on the whole programe embraced by the wireless\r\ntransmission of power. The cost of wireless power I estimate would be\r\nabout one sixteenth of that of the present system.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you are sending such tremendous voltages won't it be very\r\ndangerous to be anywhere in the vicinity of a plant, much less\r\nanywhere that the electricity might be brought from the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for the power is so well harnessed that we can send it just\r\nwhere we want it and nowhere else. Of course, on the other hand, if\r\nwe wanted to make trouble with this well-harnessed lightning we could\r\nmake a terrible disturbance in the earth and on the surface of the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about lightning?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is one of the things we had to guard against right from the\r\nvery first, and I can tell you that lightning will not bother us a\r\nbit, although I cannot give you the details of our method of avoiding\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"When we are using the plant at night, however, there will be a\r\ndisplay far more beautiful than lightning, all about the cupola in\r\nthe form of a great halo of electric light visible for miles around.\"\r\n\r\nBefore we leave this fascinating subject of the wireless transmission\r\nof power let us ask Doctor Tesla about the effect of his invention on\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"The wireless transmission of power will first be a big factor in\r\npromoting world peace, as I said before, because through the great\r\nimprovement in communication it will lead to a better understanding\r\nbetween nations and break down many of the old prejudices that have\r\nlived for so many thousands of years. It will facilitate travel and\r\ncommerce so that a citizen of the United States will find it as\r\nsimple and cheap to travel abroad as he now finds it to travel in\r\nthe neighbouring state. His commercial interests also will spread to\r\nforeign countries, and the nations will be so linked with one another\r\nsocially and commercially that war will be out of the question.\r\n\r\n\"However, in case war should break out between the nations it will\r\nbe a conflict of such gigantic proportions, and carried on with such\r\ntremendous death-dealing machines, that it will surpass our wildest\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n\"For one thing, the new art of controlling electrically the movements\r\nand operations of individualized automata at a distance without wires\r\nwill soon enable any country to render its coast impregnable against\r\nall naval attacks.\r\n\r\n\"I have invented a number of improvements of this plan, making it\r\npossible to direct a telautomaton torpedo, submersible at will, from\r\na distance much greater than the range of the largest gun, with\r\nunerring precision, upon the object to be destroyed. What is still\r\nmore surprising, the operator will not need to see the infernal\r\nengine or even know its location, and the enemy will be unable to\r\ninterfere, in the slightest, with its movements by any electrical\r\nmeans. One of these devil-telautomata will soon be constructed, and\r\nI shall bring it to the attention of governments. The development\r\nof this art must unavoidably arrest the construction of expensive\r\nbattleships as well as land fortifications, and revolutionize the\r\nmeans and methods of warfare. The distance at which it can strike,\r\nand the destructive power of such a quasi-intelligent machine being\r\nfor all practical purposes unlimited, the gun, the armour of the\r\nbattleship, and the wall of the fortress, lose their import and\r\nsignificance. One can prophesy with a Daniel's confidence that\r\nskilled electricians will settle the battles of the near future, if\r\nbattles we must have.\r\n\r\n\"The future of wireless power development,\" explained the inventor,\r\n\"may render it folly for any nation to have afloat a vessel of war.\r\nThe secret of another nation's scheme of selectivity or combination\r\nof vibrations might be disclosed to the enemy, when the guns of\r\ntheir own vessels might be turned against sister ships and a whole\r\nfleet destroyed by shells from their own guns, or their magazines\r\nmight be exploded by the enemy at will. However, should there be\r\nbattleships in the wireless future, they will be crewless. They will\r\nbe manoeuvred, their guns will be loaded, aimed, and fired, and their\r\ntorpedoes discharged with unerring accuracy, by the director of naval\r\nwarfare seated before a telautomatic switch-board on land.\r\n\r\n\"The time will come, as a result of my discovery,\" says Tesla,\r\n\"when one nation may destroy another in time of war through this\r\nwireless force: great tongues of electric flame made to burst from\r\nthe earth of the enemy's country might destroy not only the people\r\nand the cities, but the land itself. I realize that this is indeed\r\na dangerous thing to advocate. At first thought it might mean\r\nthe annihilation of the nations of the world by evilly disposed\r\nindividuals. The public might at first look upon the perfection of\r\nsuch an invention as a calamity. We say that all inventions assist\r\nthe criminal in his work. To-day the safe burglar despises the use of\r\ndynamite, turning to electrical contrivances to cut the lock from a\r\nsafe. It is fortunate for the world, therefore, that 90 per cent. of\r\nits people are good, and that only 10 per cent. are evilly disposed:\r\notherwise all invention might be turned more greatly to evil than to\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MOTION-PICTURE MACHINE\r\n\r\n   MACHINES THAT MAKE SIXTEEN TINY PICTURES PER SECOND AND SHOW\r\n   THEM AT THE SAME RATE MAGNIFIED SEVERAL THOUSAND TIMES--MOTION\r\n   PICTURES IN SCHOOL--OUR BOY FRIEND SEES THE WHOLE PROCESS OF\r\n   MAKING A MOTION-PICTURE PLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have just been to the moving-picture show,\" said the young man\r\nwhose inquiring turn of mind has brought him into touch with so many\r\nrecent inventions. His friend in the laboratory had just finished a\r\nvery successful chemical experiment and seemed glad to see the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Did the pictures move very much?\" he asked with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they did. They moved all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they only seemed to move, for as a matter of fact there are no\r\nsuch things as 'moving pictures.' We call them 'motion pictures' now,\r\nfor that comes nearer to expressing the idea.\r\n\r\n\"Cinematography, which is the technical name for the whole art of\r\nmotion pictures, is based on one of nature's defects, whereas most\r\ninventions are based on some of nature's perfect processes. The\r\ndefect is called by the scientists the persistence of vision, which\r\nmeans that after you look at an object, and it is quickly taken from\r\nbefore your eyes, the image remains there for the fraction of a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ELECTRICITY ENOUGH TO KILL AN ARMY PERFECTLY\r\n  HARNESSED\r\n\r\n  The Oscillator shown on the left sending an alternating current\r\n  from the earth into a large reservoir and back at the rate of\r\n  100,000 oscillations per second causes the tremendous electrical\r\n  explosions as the reservoir is filled each time. The flames in\r\n  this experiment were 22 feet long.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of Thomas A. Edison Inc.\r\n\r\n  A BATTLE SCENE IN THE STUDIO\r\n\r\n  In this picture the stage director can be seen shouting\r\n  directions to both actors and photographer at once.]\r\n\r\n\"With this in mind you will see how the cinematograph is simply\r\nstill photography worked out so as to show a series of snapshots at\r\nsuch speed that the eye cannot notice the change from one picture to\r\nanother, but will see only the changing positions of the figures.\r\nEach picture shows the figures in a little different position, in the\r\nsame order that they move, so that the whole series thrown on the\r\nscreen at high speed shows the figures moving just as they do in real\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where does visual persistence come in?\" asked the youth.\r\n\r\n\"It would be plain if you could see the pictures thrown on the screen\r\ntwenty times as slowly as they are, for each snapshot of each stage\r\nof motion must be displayed separately. It must remain perfectly\r\nstill for an instant and then must be moved away while the shutter\r\nof the projecting machine is closed. When the shutter is opened\r\nagain the next picture is thrown on the screen. Now, through the\r\npersistence of vision, the image of the first picture remains in your\r\nbrain, photographed on the retina of your eye, while the shutter is\r\nclosed, and you are not conscious that there is nothing on the white\r\nscreen before your eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The scientific explanation of this is simple enough: After an image\r\nhas been recorded by your eye it will remain in the brain for an\r\ninstant even after the object has been removed. Then it fades slowly\r\naway and gives place to the next image sent along the optic nerve\r\nfrom the eye. Thus the eye acts as a sort of dissolving lantern for\r\nthe motion-picture man, and lets one image fade into another without\r\nshowing any perceptible change in pictures. Thus the 'moving picture'\r\nis only a scientifically worked out _illusion_ of motion.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientist went on to say that with marvellously constructed\r\nmachines this scientific fact has been turned to such account that\r\nboys and girls in some of the schools now study geography partly from\r\nmotion pictures, and some of the most wonderful sights of nature\r\nare seen every day by millions of people as they sit comfortably in\r\ntheir seats in the motion-picture theatre. A few years ago, before\r\nthe invention of cinematography, the magic lantern was largely used,\r\nas many boys will remember; but it could only show scenes in which\r\nthere was no movement--or in other words, scenes that were confined\r\nto still-life photography. Nowadays every boy is familiar with\r\nmotion pictures depicting great historical occurrences, parades,\r\ninaugurations, coronations, volcanoes in eruption, earthquakes,\r\nbuildings burning and crumbling, railroad wrecks, shipwrecks, scenes\r\nin every country in the world and plays of every imaginable kind.\r\n\r\nThe motion-picture photographer takes pictures in the frozen North,\r\nand in the densest tropical jungles. He goes close to the craters of\r\nvolcanoes in eruption to make a film of the terrifying flow of molten\r\nlava, and he sails the seas in the worst storms, that boys and girls\r\nwho have never seen the ocean may understand its mighty upheavals.\r\nOne motion-picture outfit was taken to the Arctic regions off the\r\ncoast of Alaska where the volcanic activity in Behring Sea frequently\r\ncauses new islands to spring from the ocean, or old ones to sink out\r\nof sight, in an effort to record on the motion-picture film the birth\r\nof a new island or the death of an old one.\r\n\r\n\"Ever connected with scientific research, cinematography,\" said the\r\nboy's friend, \"is now one of the important branches of recording the\r\nphenomena of nature through which great scientific discoveries are\r\nmade. Of late years we have heard much about germs, and the science\r\nof germs called bacteriology. A great deal has been learned about\r\nthis most important factor in the preservation of our health, through\r\nthe study of disease germs, by watching their activities through the\r\nmedium of the cinematograph. The little parasites are photographed\r\nunder a very high power microscope and the film is cast upon a screen\r\nin the usual way.\r\n\r\n\"Also exploring parties and parties that go into remote places to\r\nsearch for additions to our store of scientific knowledge invariably\r\ncarry motion-picture outfits. One of the most notable examples of\r\nthis was the expedition of Lieut. Robert F. Scott in his search for\r\nthe South Pole. Lieutenant Scott carried many hundreds of feet of\r\nstandard film, a good camera, and a portable developing outfit, with\r\nwhich he made pictures of the Antarctic Continent, in order to show\r\nthe world the things that he and his men risked their lives to see.\r\n\r\n\"As I said before, the cinematograph is rapidly growing as an\r\neducational force, and Thomas A. Edison, the pioneer inventor and\r\nthe leader in the development of the cinematograph, declares that it\r\nwill in a short time completely do away with books in the study of\r\ngeography. It is already in use in several special school and college\r\ncourses, and with the improvements in the non-inflammable film, which\r\nwill be explained later, it can be taken up far more extensively.\"\r\n\r\nThe man went on to say that in this connection Mr. Edison, who had\r\nbeen watching the schoolwork of his own twelve-year-old son Theodore,\r\nrecently said in the magazine _The World To-day_ (now _Hearst's\r\nMagazine_):\r\n\r\n\"I have one of the best moving-picture photographers in the world in\r\nAfrica. I told him to land at Cape Town, and to take everything in\r\nsight between there and the mouth of the Nile. His pictures will\r\nshow children what Kaffirs are and how they live. He will show them\r\nat work, at play, and in their homes. They will be life-size Kaffirs\r\nthat will run and skip or work right before the children's eyes.\r\nBut the Kaffirs will be but the smallest part of what the African\r\npictures will show. The biggest beasts of the jungle--the elephants,\r\nlions, rhinos, and giraffes--will be shown, not in cages, but in\r\ntheir native haunts. The city of Cape Town will be shown with its\r\ncharacteristic streets and its shipping. The broad veldts over which\r\nKruger's armies marched will be shown just as they are, with here\r\nand there a burgher's cottage. Every step in the process of mining\r\ngold and diamonds will be put upon the film. The Nile will be shown,\r\nnot as a small black line upon a map, but as a body of beautiful\r\nblue water, alternately plunging over cataracts and creeping through\r\nmeadows to the sea. Then will come the Pyramids, with natives and\r\ntourists climbing them, and, lastly, the great cities of Alexandria\r\nand Cairo. Would any child stay at home if he knew such a treat as\r\nthis was in store for him at school? Would he ever be likely to\r\nforget what he had learned about Africa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" continued the man in the laboratory, \"this is but an\r\nexample of the use of motion pictures in schools. Many of you boys\r\nhave probably seen them in special lectures on other subjects, for\r\nthey can be used to show how people live and work in every part of\r\nthe world and how the various commercial products that so largely\r\ngovern our lives are made.\"\r\n\r\nBut the motion-picture man, he explained, is not at all dependent\r\nupon what really happens for his films, because if he cannot train\r\nthe eye of his camera on some occurrence that he desires to transfer\r\nto a film, he reproduces it in a studio, spending thousands and\r\nthousands of dollars, if necessary for actors, scenery and stage\r\nfittings. Nothing is too difficult for the motion-picture man, and\r\nhe has never proposed a feat so daring but what he could find plenty\r\nof actors willing to take the necessary parts. Battles, scenes from\r\nhistory, sessions of Congress, railroad wrecks, earthquakes and\r\nhundreds of other spectacles have been planned, staged and acted out\r\nby the makers of cinematograph films, while, of course, all the plays\r\nthat we see on the screen are planned and carefully rehearsed before\r\nthey are photographed.\r\n\r\nThis all means that cinematography has become a gigantic industry,\r\ngiving employment to hundreds of actors, photographers, and the army\r\nof men and women engaged in making and showing the films, to say\r\nnothing of the thousands of picture theatres that have sprung up in\r\nevery city and town in the country.\r\n\r\nWhile the boy's friend was telling him these things about the\r\nadventurous life of the motion-picture man, the listener sat\r\nspellbound.\r\n\r\n\"I'd love to see some motion pictures made,\" he said. \"The machines\r\nmust be wonderful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered the scientist, \"we can do that, and if you'd like we\r\ncan go up to one of the motion-picture studios some day soon and see\r\nthe whole process from beginning to end.\"\r\n\r\nHe was as good as his word, and several days later they were\r\ninitiated into all the tricks of cinematography at one of the biggest\r\nlaboratories in the country. We will follow them there and see what\r\nthey found out about the machines by which motion pictures are made\r\nand shown.\r\n\r\nWith the fact clear in mind that cinematography is simply a series\r\nof snapshots of figures in motion, taken at high speed and thrown\r\non a screen at a similar rate so that the human eye is tricked into\r\nsending to the brain an impression of moving figures rather than\r\na series of still photographs, the various machines necessary in\r\ncinematography will not be difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nBefore there can be a cinematograph play there must be a negative\r\nfilm upon which the pictures are taken, a camera to take the\r\npictures, an apparatus for developing them, a positive film which\r\ncorresponds to the printing paper in still photography, upon which\r\nthe pictures are printed from the negative film, a printing machine\r\nto print the positives from the negatives, and lastly a projecting\r\nmachine to throw the picture upon the screen in the schoolroom,\r\ncollege lecture room, or theatre.\r\n\r\nEvery boy who is an amateur photographer is familiar with the\r\nphotographic film. Up to the time the method for making practical\r\ncinematograph films was discovered in this country, scientists\r\nvainly tried to portray motion by the use of photographic plates, but\r\nhad little success. In a very short time after Eastman had announced\r\nthe discovery of a celluloid substance that was transparent, strong\r\nand flexible, light, and compressible into a small space, Edison\r\nannounced a machine for showing motion pictures.\r\n\r\nThe film base, or, in other words, the material which takes the\r\nplace of the glass used in glass plates, was discovered by George\r\nEastman in 1889, after years of painstaking experiment with dangerous\r\nchemicals. The base is a kind of guncotton called by chemists\r\npyroxylin, which is mixed in wood alcohol. The guncotton is made by\r\ntreating flax or cotton waste with sulphuric and nitric acids. After\r\nthe guncotton and the wood alcohol have been thoroughly stirred up,\r\nthe mixture looks like a thick syrup, but it is about as dangerous a\r\nsyrup as ever was brewed, for its ingredients are those of the most\r\npowerful explosives. Its technical name is cellulose-nitrate. It is\r\npoured out on a polished surface, dried, rolled, trimmed, and after\r\nbeing coated with the sensitive material that makes it valuable for\r\nphotography, is ready for delivery to the motion-picture maker in\r\nlengths up to 400 feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MEN WHO GAVE THE WORLD MOTION PICTURES\r\n\r\n  Eadweard Muybridge, called the \"Father of Motion Pictures.\"\r\n\r\n  Thomas A. Edison, inventor of the motion-picture machine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MOTION-PICTURE PROJECTOR\r\n\r\n  This is the standard Edison projector from two points of view,\r\n  showing its complicated mechanism as clearly as possible.]\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting points to remember about these films is that\r\nalthough they are made in lengths up to 400 feet they are all one and\r\nthree eighths of an inch wide, and the three eighths of an inch\r\nis given over to a margin at each side of the picture. That leaves a\r\nwidth for each picture on the film of just one inch. The height of\r\neach picture is three quarters of an inch. Fancy a photograph one\r\ninch by three quarters of an inch! No matter how clear it is you\r\ncould not see with the naked eye all its details, and so it is in the\r\ncinematograph picture. It is so clear and sharp that when put under\r\na good magnifying glass details that cannot be seen by the human eye\r\nare noticed. Now fancy multiplying the area of each little picture\r\n2,700 times, and think of the chance for magnifying imperfections!\r\nAnd yet that is the amount that each picture is magnified in throwing\r\nit on a screen of the average size.\r\n\r\nThe films are coated with the sensitive emulsion in two degrees. The\r\nnegative films must be as sensitive as possible to light, as they\r\nare intended to receive the shortest possible exposure, while the\r\npositive films, or the ones which correspond to the print paper in\r\nstill photography, are made less sensitive to light, inasmuch as they\r\nare exposed for a longer time in the printing machine.\r\n\r\nFireproof films are probably one of the most important developments\r\nin the whole great motion-picture industry, for through these,\r\nschools, colleges, churches, lecture halls, and other public places\r\nnot fitted with the fireproof box in which the motion-picture\r\noperator works, can have the advantage of cinematography.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult matter to find a non-inflammable film, for\r\nscience has not yet discovered a base that can be made without\r\ncellulose, but the base we know to-day was treated so as to be\r\nnon-explosive and practically non-inflammable. This film base is\r\ncalled cellulose-acetate, and when it is exposed to an excessive\r\nheat, as, for instance, the beam of the motion-picture lamp when the\r\nfilm is not moving, or when it touches a flame, it melts but does not\r\nblaze up. In the melting it gives off a heavy smoke, but there is no\r\nserious danger from this, as there is from the spurting flames from\r\nan exploding cellulose-nitrate base.\r\n\r\nThe films are packed in metal airtight and lightproof boxes and sent\r\nto the motion-picture firms, where they begin a complicated and an\r\ninteresting career. The first stage is the perforating machine,\r\nthrough which all films, whether negative or positive, must go. The\r\nholes are made along the two edges of the celluloid strips, just as\r\nshown in the picture opposite page 176. There are sixty-four holes to\r\nthe foot, on each side of the film, and each hole is oblong-shaped,\r\nas can be seen, with a width of about one eighth of an inch and\r\na depth of about one sixteenth of an inch. This is known as the\r\nEdison Standard Gauge, and it is observed by practically all the\r\nmotion-picture firms in the world.\r\n\r\nThe perforations along the edges of the films furnish the means for\r\ndrawing them through the camera, printing machine, and projector; and\r\nas the correct movement of the films is one of the important factors\r\nin making good pictures, they must be absolutely mathematically\r\nexact. A fault in perforation of even as much as one thousandth\r\npart of an inch is apt to cause the film to buckle in the camera or\r\nprojector and ruin the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThere are several different perforating machines in use now, and\r\nall of them are claimed by their makers to be perfect. It will not\r\nbe necessary for us to take one of these machines to pieces further\r\nthan to see that the holes along the edges of the films are punched\r\nby hardened steel punches. The films unwind from one bobbin, pass\r\nthrough the perforating device, and wind upon another bobbin. Of\r\ncourse the work must be done in absolute darkness, except for a small\r\nruby lamp, as the films are so sensitive to light that any rays other\r\nthan faint red would spoil them.\r\n\r\nAfter perforation the negatives and positives are ready for use. The\r\nnegative goes to the photographer in its light-tight metal box to\r\nbe run off in making a film of a historical scene, a comedy, some\r\nwonderful phenomenon of science, or any one of a million different\r\nsubjects. Just for the sake of seeing everything in its proper order\r\nwe will assume that the negative is about to be used in portraying a\r\ncomedy about the troubles of a book agent, and that it is all done\r\nin the studio where the scientist and his boy friend watched this\r\nvery film made.\r\n\r\nNow for a look into a motion-picture camera--something few people\r\nget, because the competition among the various cinematographers is\r\nkeen, and those who hold patents on cameras fear infringement.\r\n\r\nThe camera, which is enclosed in a strong mahogany box, stands upon\r\na tripod. It is about eighteen inches long, eighteen inches high,\r\nand four inches wide. (This size varies with the make, and kind of\r\nwork required.) The left side opens on a hinge, while on the right\r\nside are the ground glass finder, the distance gauge, and a dial\r\nto register the number of feet of film used. In the rear of the\r\ncamera is a small hole which connects with a tube running straight\r\nthrough the box so that the operator looking through can sight it\r\nlike a telescope, before the film is exposed. When the sighting and\r\nfocusing are completed the opening is closed with a light-tight cap,\r\nand the film can be threaded through the camera. Having no bellows\r\nfor focusing like an ordinary camera, the lens of the motion-picture\r\ncamera is moved back and forward a short distance in the little tube\r\nin which it is set, to aid in the focusing. Of course the lenses of\r\nthese wonderful snapshot machines are the best that money can buy and\r\nthe factories can turn out.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A SECTION OF MOTION-PICTURE FILM\r\n\r\n  This is the exact size of the little pictures we see on the\r\n  screen almost life size. Note how slowly the changes appear. It\r\n  takes only one second to take sixteen of these.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of Thomas A. Edison, Inc.\r\n\r\n  MAKING A MOTION-PICTURE PLAY IN THE STUDIO\r\n\r\n  Note the photographer, the stage manager beside him, and the\r\n  battery of arc lights making the scene in the studio as light as\r\n  day.]\r\n\r\nIn the rear half of the camera are two boxes. The top one holds the\r\nunexposed roll of negative, while the exposed film is rolled in\r\nthe bottom one. Roughly speaking, the film unwinds from the top\r\nspool, passes out of the containing box through a slit, over a set of\r\nsprockets into the \"film gate,\" down past the lens and shutter, where\r\nit is exposed over a lower set of sprockets, and through a slit into\r\nthe lower containing box, where it is wound on a spool.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MOTION-PICTURE CAMERA\r\n\r\n    A--Box for coil of unexposed film.\r\n    A´--Box for coil of exposed film.\r\n    B--Film passing over rollers.\r\n    B´--Exposed film passing over rollers.\r\n    C--Cogwheel which draws out film.\r\n    D--Teeth which jerk film past lens.\r\n    E--Lens and film-gate.\r\n    H--Cogwheel which draws in exposed film.]\r\n\r\n\"It looks simple enough, doesn't it?\" asked the photographer,\r\nwho was explaining the making of a moving-picture play to his\r\nvisitors. \"Well, it is a simple idea, but it takes a very\r\ncomplicated and a wonderfully accurate machine to accomplish the\r\ndesired result.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place our cinematography is just still photography\r\nat high speed. We have to take approximately sixteen snapshots a\r\nsecond, so you can see that it takes a perfect machine to move\r\nthe film along fast enough so that we can get sixteen good,\r\nclear, sharp pictures only slightly bigger than a postage stamp,\r\non our film between the ticks of your watch.\r\n\r\n\"Now if you look through the little hole at the back of the\r\ncamera you will see that the scene in front of us is in the\r\nproper focus, and if you look at the little ground glass finder\r\nat the side here you will see it just the same way, except that\r\nit will be upside down. Now I will close the telescope focus at\r\nthe rear so that when the film is brought down before the lens it\r\nwill not be light struck.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"threading\" of the camera then began. \"This little flap\r\nsticking out of this slit in the top box,\" continued the\r\ncinematographer, \"is the end of the film, which is tightly wound\r\nup in its holder. You notice that I draw it out and thread\r\nit between these rollers, making sure that the teeth of the\r\nsprockets enter the perforations along the sides of the film. I\r\nalso make sure that the sensitized side of the film is turned\r\nout, so that the light coming through the lens will strike it\r\nfirst. After the negative has been led over the sprockets you\r\nnotice that it is allowed to make a loop of a couple of inches of\r\nslack. Then it is led into the important device we call the 'film\r\ngate.'\r\n\r\n\"You see the gate is hinged and that these little claws or\r\nfingers running in grooves take hold of the perforations. The\r\nnext thing is to close the hinged gate so that the film is\r\ntightly held against the aperture, through which the light\r\nstrikes it and makes the picture. Below the gate we let the\r\nnegative make another loop and then thread it over another system\r\nof rollers and sprockets and so to the slit in the lower box,\r\nwhere the exposed negative is rolled.\r\n\r\n\"The camera is now loaded and threaded and when I give the crank\r\nby which the wheels are turned a few trial turns you can see the\r\nway the mechanism works. In the first place you must understand\r\nthat the film has to be jerked down with an intermittent motion.\r\nDon't forget to look for the intermittent motion, because, after\r\nthe persistence of vision, that jump and stop, jump and stop, is\r\nthe most important thing in cinematography--intermittent motion!\r\n\r\n\"You can see as the crank turns that the sprockets pull the film\r\nout and guide it along its course, and the little fingers jerk it\r\ndown the space of one picture, or three quarters of an inch, at\r\neach jump. When the fingers are jerking the negative down, the\r\nshutter must be closed, and when the fingers are making their\r\nback trip to take a new hold on another length of film the strip\r\nmust be as still as the Washington Monument, for the shutter to\r\nopen, let in the light and transfer the image before the lens to\r\nthe negative.\"\r\n\r\nThe photographer turned his crank and all the wheels in the\r\ncamera began to move. The sprockets working in the perforations\r\npulled out the film and made the loop larger. The little fingers\r\nentered the perforations and jerked the film down, taking up some\r\nof the slack of the loop. The reason that the loop is formed is\r\nto prevent the film being torn by a hard jerk by the fingers when\r\nit is taut.\r\n\r\n\"Now if your eye were quick enough--which it is not\"--said the\r\nphotographer, \"and you could see behind the gate, you would see a\r\nmovement like the following repeated sixteen times to the second:\r\nCrank turns, top sprocket adds three quarters of an inch to the\r\ntop loop, bottom sprocket takes up three quarters of an inch of\r\nbottom slack loop, fingers spring from groove and carry film\r\ndown three quarters of an inch, inconceivably short pause while\r\nshutter opens and picture is taken; during this pause, while\r\nfilm is stationary, fingers jump back into groove, slide back\r\nto starting point without touching film and shutter closes. The\r\nshutter is a revolving disk between the lens and film, and the\r\nholes in the disk passing the negative admit the light.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a roll of negative film has been exposed it is sent to the\r\nstudio dark room for development. Every precaution is taken, of\r\ncourse, that no ray of light other than that which comes from\r\nthe ruby lamp shall enter this room where films representing\r\nhundreds, and perhaps thousands, of dollars are being developed.\r\nThe actual process for developing is no different from that used\r\nin developing other films, but the difficulties in handling a\r\ndelicate snakelike, strip some 300 or 400 feet long and 1-3/8\r\ninches wide are tremendous. All amateur photographers appreciate\r\nthe difficulties of developing in one string a roll of twelve\r\nfilms of a reasonable size, but think of handling a roll of film\r\nseveral hundred feet long no wider than a ribbon, and holding\r\nsixteen pictures to each foot of surface!\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of scratching, tangling, etc., were overcome\r\nby systematizing the process. In some cinematograph dark rooms\r\nthe films are wound on racks about four by five feet, and then\r\nplunged into the various baths, which are in vertical tanks of\r\nconvenient size. In yet other dark rooms the films are wound upon\r\ndrums about four feet in diameter and revolved in horizontal\r\ntanks, only the lower part being immersed. The only difference is\r\nthat the racks can be manipulated easier than the drums.\r\n\r\nWhile in the motion-picture dark room the boy visitor asked\r\nthe photographer in charge whether an amateur could step in\r\nand develop a few hundred feet of film granted that he had the\r\nnecessary materials.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he could,\" came a cheerful voice from the darkness.\r\n\"It's just the same as developing a roll of ordinary films,\r\nonly we do more in a bunch than the amateur. If you'll step\r\nover here and watch this reel that we are now putting into\r\nthe developing bath you'll see that it does just the same as\r\nthe single film developed in the amateur's dark room.\" After\r\nwatching this trained photographer and his assistant for a\r\nfew minutes, however, the newcomer decided that it was not an\r\namateur's job, but rather one of the most delicate operations in\r\nall cinematography, for the developer can remedy many faults of\r\nexposure by bringing out an under-exposed film or toning down an\r\nover-exposed one.\r\n\r\nLeaving the dark room the next stage of the negative is the\r\ndrying room, where the film still on the rack is hung up to dry.\r\nThis drying is a very difficult process because there is great\r\ndanger of the film either becoming too brittle and cracking or\r\nof its being not hard enough. The air in the drying room has to\r\nbe kept at a certain even temperature and it must be filtered so\r\nthat no dust or impurity can injure the film.\r\n\r\nAfter it has been properly dried the film again is wound upon a\r\nmetal spool, put in an airtight box and sent to the assembling\r\nroom, where the various scenes that go to make up the picture\r\nplay, taken at different times and on different rolls of\r\nnegative, are joined together in their proper order to make a\r\ncomplete play in a single roll about one thousand feet long.\r\n\r\nAfter the negative film is developed, dried and wound upon a\r\nmetal spool it is sent to the printing room, where positive\r\nprints are made from the original impression. Right here it may\r\nbe well to say that on a negative film or plate in any kind of\r\nphotography white appears black and black appears white--hence\r\nthe name negative. The paper or film upon which the print is to\r\nbe made turns black wherever the light strikes it, so that when\r\nthe negative is laid over the positive and exposed to a strong\r\nlight the rays quickly penetrate the white spots on the negative\r\nand turn the corresponding spots on the positive black. The light\r\ndoes not penetrate the places on the negative which are black,\r\nand consequently leaves those places on the positive white. The\r\nresult is that the positive shows the image just as it appears to\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\nThe principle of printing positive films, then, is the same as\r\nthe principle of making photographic prints or positives from\r\nordinary still photography plates or films, but of course it is\r\nfar more complicated because of the mechanical difficulties of\r\nbringing the two long, unwieldy strips of film together in the\r\nproper position. The whole process is carried out by a machine\r\nwhich takes the place of the printing frame into which the\r\namateur so easily puts the still-life photographic plate and\r\nprinting paper.\r\n\r\nThere are several motion-picture printing machines in use in this\r\ncountry, but in their central idea they are similar, as they\r\nall pass the negative and positive films before a very bright\r\nlight so that the impressions on the negative are transferred to\r\nthe positive. The invention of this machine was a necessity for\r\nthe commercial success of motion pictures, for obviously it was\r\nimpossible to lay a strip of film several hundred feet long and\r\nabout an inch wide in a printing frame over a positive film of\r\nthe same length and width.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MOTION-PICTURE PRINTING MACHINE\r\n\r\n   A-A´--Rollers for negative film.\r\n\r\n   B-B´--Rollers for positive film.\r\n\r\n   C--Film gate where positive is held over negative for printing.\r\n\r\n   D-D´--Negative film.\r\n\r\n   E--Unexposed positive film.\r\n\r\n   E´--Exposed, or printed positive film.\r\n\r\n   F--Light which, shining through film gate, imprints image of\r\n   negative on positive.]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of one printing machine will suffice to indicate the\r\ngeneral principle. Some of the machines are worked by hand power, but\r\nin the larger reproduction studios electric power is used practically\r\naltogether for running the battery of printing machines.\r\n\r\nThe spool of negative film is slipped on to a spindle so that it can\r\nunwind easily, and immediately underneath it the roll of unexposed\r\npositive film, properly perforated along the edges in exactly the\r\nsame way that the negative film is perforated, is suspended on a\r\nsimilar spindle. Of course the only light in the printing room is\r\nthe photographer's ruby lamp.\r\n\r\nThe two films unwind and pass downward, with the sensitive surfaces\r\nto the inside, and the positive on the outside of the negative.\r\nThey are drawn together, and with the positive stretched flatly\r\nover the negative they pass over a pair of smooth rollers and\r\ntoothed sprockets which enter the perforations of the two films with\r\nmathematical accuracy. They then make a small loop and enter a side\r\nhinged gate which holds them tightly against the printing aperture.\r\nThis aperture is a hole just the size and shape of each picture on\r\nthe film, and through it shines a very bright light which casts its\r\ndirect rays upon the negative and imprints the image of the negative\r\nfilm upon the sensitized surface of the positive film. After passing\r\nthe printing aperture, the two films make another small loop, run\r\ndown to another toothed sprocket wheel and roller, and then separate,\r\nthe printed positive being rolled upon one spool and the negative\r\nupon its spool below.\r\n\r\nThe action of this machine is very similar to that of the\r\nmotion-picture camera, for like the device for taking the\r\nphotographs, the movement must be intermittent in order to obtain\r\ngood results.\r\n\r\nIf the operator desires to see whether the two films are in exactly\r\nthe right position and everything is going smoothly, he can, by the\r\nuse of a lever in the printing gate, drop a little red screen between\r\nthe light and the films, and by looking through the hole see through\r\nthe unprinted positive, and the developed negative, to the light\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nAfter a roll of positive has been printed, it is developed by just\r\nabout the same process as is used in bringing out the images on the\r\nnegative film. Then, after it is dried, the various scenes are joined\r\ntogether, titles and sub-titles put in, any final editing that is\r\nnecesary is done, and the positive film is ready to be put on the\r\nprojection machine for the first trial.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the titles, sub-titles, and other explanatory\r\nwritings that are thrown on the screen in the course of a\r\ncinematograph play is a comparatively simple matter. The words are\r\nwritten or printed out in large letters on cards and photographed\r\nby a camera with a slower movement than the ones used for recording\r\nmoving figures. The positives are made from the negatives so taken,\r\nin the same way that positives of other films are made, and after\r\ndevelopment and drying are ready to be joined to the film in the\r\nproper places.\r\n\r\nEvery firm engaged in the fascinating business of making and\r\nreproducing cinematographic plays gives the most careful and\r\npainstaking attention to the first \"performance\" of a film. Of course\r\nit is held in private before only the officials and a few critics\r\ninvited for the exercise of their judgment. The event amounts to the\r\nsame thing as the dress rehearsal of a play to be reproduced upon\r\nthe stage, and any changes that are necessary in the judgment of the\r\ncritics cause just about as much trouble. Any one of a hundred things\r\nmay be wrong. Some little incongruous detail in the scenery may be\r\nnoticed, some jarring gesture by an actor or a scene in which the\r\naction does not proceed fast enough.\r\n\r\nIf the officials of the firm decide that a film is below their\r\nstandard, parts must be cut out, and new parts photographed over\r\nagain until the whole thing suits requirements. Sometimes one scene\r\nmust be done over many times before it suits exactly, and several\r\nhundred feet of film wasted. At a cost of about three cents a foot,\r\nit is plain that the waste in film alone is great, but when a big\r\nscene with a hundred or so actors in it has to be done over again,\r\nthe cost of assembling the company, paying their salaries and other\r\nexpenses is enormous.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the officials themselves are satisfied with a\r\nfilm it is thrown on the screen for the board of censors in the\r\nvarious cities, and if it measures up to standard, and contains no\r\nobjectionable features, it is ready for public reproduction.\r\n\r\nWhen all this is done, the printing machine again comes into play,\r\nand as many prints of the negative as are needed are struck off, for\r\nin cinematography, as in still photography, it is a simple matter\r\nto run off as many prints as are desired, once a good negative is\r\nmade. These prints then are sent out to as many theatres, in as many\r\ndifferent cities, as desire them, and released for public view on the\r\nsame day in every theatre in the country.\r\n\r\nHaving looked at the motion-picture camera, and at the complicated\r\nprocess for developing and printing the films, we are now ready to\r\nclimb into the little fireproof box from which comes the beam of\r\nlight that throws the pictures on the screen. This is the projector\r\nand it is probably the most complicated of all the machines used in\r\ncinematography. As it was a development through the application of\r\nwell-known mechanical principles we will not go into this subject\r\nmore deeply than merely to understand its central principle, which is\r\nintermittent motion.\r\n\r\nThe result toward which the inventors worked was a magic lantern such\r\nas was familiar to every boy ten years ago, that would throw upon the\r\nscreen the tiny consecutive pictures on the film, with such speed,\r\nand at the same time so clearly and steadily, that the effect would\r\nbe that of figures in motion. Most boys will remember the flickering,\r\nflashing and jumping that used to be noticeable in motion pictures,\r\nand many are probably aware that it was the improvement of the\r\nprojecting machine that did away with these objectionable features.\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of the projecting machine are the lantern with\r\nits light and lens, and the device for running the positive film\r\nbefore the light with the proper intermittent motion. It might\r\nbe said generally that the projecting machine looks like a magic\r\nlantern, but on close examination it will be seen to be an extremely\r\ncomplicated affair.\r\n\r\nThe powerful electric light, usually an arc light, which is placed in\r\na metal box a few inches behind the rest of the projector, directs\r\nits rays through the glass condensers, thence through the film,\r\nand thence through the lens, which throws the image upon the white\r\nscreen or curtain. The condensers are made of two carefully ground\r\nglass parts. The first is dish shaped, with the concave side turned\r\nin toward the light and the convex side turned outward. Immediately\r\nagainst it is another condenser the same diameter and convex on\r\nboth sides so that the collected rays from the dished part are shot\r\nforward to a point where they will all converge. This point is the\r\ncentre of the lens. From the lens the rays of light are projected in\r\na widening beam to the white screen on which the pictures appear.\r\n\r\nThe film is passed before the beam of light at a point between the\r\ncondensers and the lens, so that the image is projected through the\r\nlens. The film is run before the light with the figures upside down,\r\nlike in the ordinary stereopticon, and the lens turns the image right\r\nside up again.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the solution of the problem is the\r\nadvantage taken of the persistence of vision. Photographed at the\r\nrapid rate of sixteen a second, and thrown upon the screen at the\r\nsame rate of sixteen a second, it is plain that the stage of motion\r\nshown in the pictures every sixteenth of a second is reproduced.\r\nWith the inability of the eye to tell that the screen is merely\r\nexhibiting separate photographs, the appearance is of motion. In most\r\npersons this visual persistence is only about one twenty-fourth of a\r\nsecond, but that is long enough to allow animated photography to be a\r\npleasing illusion to them, for it gives the shutter of the projector\r\ntime to hide one picture while the mechanism moves the film down to\r\nthe next picture, bring the film to a dead stop, and let the shutter\r\nopen again to reveal the next stage of animation.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which modern mechanical skill took advantage of\r\nthis physiological defect, proved many years ago by the leading\r\nscientists, is nearly as interesting as this slight defect in\r\nnature's own camera--the eye.\r\n\r\nAbove the film gate is a metal fireproof box (many of them are lined\r\nwith asbestos) in which is the roll of unprojected positive film.\r\nBelow it is another similar box in which the film that has been shown\r\nis wound. The motion, which is directed either by a crank turned by\r\nhand or by electrical power, is the same speed, and practically the\r\nsame in detail, as that of the film in the cinematograph camera. From\r\nthe film box the film runs to a roller, where a sprocket enters the\r\nall-important perforations and draws out the strip to make a small\r\nloop above the film gate.\r\n\r\nThe shutter is placed in front of the lens. It is made up of a\r\nblack metal circular disk, with either two or three open spaces,\r\nand a similar number of solid or opaque spaces. In general it looks\r\nlike a very wide flat aeroplane propeller. Like the movement of the\r\ncamera, the film is stationary while the shutter is open, and when\r\nthe shutter is closed the film is jerked down three fourths of an\r\ninch, or the length of one picture, and brought to a dead stop by\r\nthe time the shutter revolves and is open again. This is repeated\r\nsixteen times every second, so the film is cast upon the screen for\r\none thirty-second part of a second, and the screen is blank one\r\nthirty-second part of a second while the shutter is closed and, as we\r\nmight say, the scenes are being changed for the next act. Although\r\nthe movement is just the same as in the camera, it may be well for\r\nthe sake of making the thing perfectly clear to go through the motion\r\nvery slowly.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of keeping out of fractions entirely too small for our\r\nconsideration we have assumed that in both camera and projecting\r\nmachine the shutter is open one thirty-second part of a second and\r\nthen closed one thirty-second part of a second, the whole operation\r\ntaking one sixteenth of a second. As a matter of fact the effort\r\nof the experts in animated photography is to have the shutter of\r\nthe camera open for just as brief a space of time as possible, and\r\non the other hand it is their effort to have the shutter of the\r\nprojecting machine open just as long a space of time as possible, and\r\nclosed as short a time as possible. In other words, they desire to\r\nshorten the time when there is nothing on the screen, and lengthen\r\nthe time for the eye to photograph each image on the brain. By using\r\na little different mechanism in the film gate of the projector this\r\nis accomplished to some extent, as well as obtaining a clearer,\r\nsteadier picture than formerly was shown.\r\n\r\nYou will remember that in the camera and printing machine the film\r\nwas jerked down by little teeth or fingers.\r\n\r\nThe simpler of the two methods in general use on projectors now is\r\ncalled the \"dog\" movement. It is composed of an eccentric wheel\r\nplaced below the film gate, with a little roller projecting from it.\r\nThe wheel revolves and once every sixteenth part of a second the\r\nroller is brought around so that it strikes the film and jerks it\r\ndown the three fourths of an inch that makes the space of one picture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MOTION-PICTURE STUDIO\r\n\r\n  This is where a great many of the Edison Photoplays are made.\r\n  Besides all the other departments there is room on the stage for\r\n  several different plays to be photographed at one time.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of Thomas A. Edison, Inc.\r\n\r\n  A REALISTIC FILM OF WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE\r\n\r\n  This picture was taken in zero weather on a real stream with real\r\n  ice menacing the actors in the boats.]\r\n\r\nThe other method is known as the \"Maltese Cross\" movement. The name\r\nis taken from the fact that the chief sprocket wheel is shaped\r\nsomewhat like a Maltese Cross. This wheel, with four notches in it,\r\nis attached to the sprocket below the film gate, and it is driven\r\nintermittently by a wheel with a pin that enters one of the notches\r\non the Maltese Cross wheel at each revolution, and pushes it\r\naround the space of one quarter of a turn. This of course turns the\r\nlower toothed sprocket and jerks the film down the space of one\r\npicture. On the next revolution of the driving wheel the pin enters\r\nthe next notch, turns the Maltese Cross wheel another quarter of a\r\nturn, and, by the motion imparted to the sprocket, jerks the film\r\ndown another three quarters of an inch, thereby pulling another\r\npicture into place as the shutter opens.\r\n\r\nRecent improvements on this movement have largely done away with the\r\njar resulting from the pin catching the notches in the cross. The\r\nwheel that looks like a Maltese Cross has, instead of four notches,\r\nthree grooves, dividing the wheel into three equal parts just as if\r\na pie were cut into three equal parts but the knife stopped short,\r\nleaving a solid hub in the centre. The space between each groove\r\nrepresents the length of one picture on the film. Without going into\r\na long, tiresome, technical explanation of this very important little\r\nfeature of the projecting machine, it will suffice to say that the\r\nthree-groove wheel is connected with the sprocket underneath the film\r\ngate. Near it is a revolving arm, and upon this arm is a horizontal\r\nbar. When the arm makes a revolution, and reaches a point where it\r\ntouches the three-divided wheel, the mechanical adjustment is so\r\nfine that the horizontal bar enters the groove, and the revolution\r\nof the arm carries the three-divided wheel around one third of\r\na revolution--or the space from one groove to another--turns the\r\nsprocket and pulls the film down the space of one picture, with a\r\nquick steady pull. After getting this far, the arm on its upward\r\ncourse leaves the three-divided wheel, which stands still while the\r\nshutter is open until the arm gets around again, and as the shutter\r\ncloses pulls the sprocket around another space.\r\n\r\nThe strong light concentrated upon the film, in just the same way\r\nthat you concentrate the sun's rays upon your hand with a burning\r\nglass, is very apt to set the film afire, particularly if through\r\nany slip in the machinery it stops in its rapid progress of about a\r\nfoot a second. As machinery is not infallible, the manufacturers have\r\ninvented various safety devices for protecting the film in case the\r\nmachinery stops. Of course this is not necessary when non-inflammable\r\nfilm is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nADVENTURES WITH MOTION PICTURES\r\n\r\n   PERILOUS AND EXCITING TIMES IN OBTAINING MOTION PICTURES.--HOW\r\n   THE MACHINE CAME TO BE INVENTED, AND THE NEWEST DEVELOPMENTS IN\r\n   CINEMATOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a clear understanding of the mechanism of the various\r\nmotion-picture machines in mind, we are free to go on with the\r\nscientist and our young friend to the exciting times experienced by\r\nactors and photographers in making the pictures that delight people\r\nall over the world. First, however, let us briefly look back over\r\nthe history of the art, for there is nothing more interesting than\r\nto follow up the experiments upon which Thomas A. Edison based his\r\ninvention of the original cinematograph or kinetoscope.\r\n\r\nLong ago, even before Edison was born, scientists tinkered with\r\ndevices that would picture apparent motion, but they were rude\r\nattempts and little progress was made for many years. The first man\r\nto take a decisive step toward practical cinematography was Edward\r\n(or Eadweard) Muybridge, a photographer who lived in Oakland, Cal.;\r\nso he is rightly called the father of motion pictures.\r\n\r\nMuybridge had been experimenting with snapshot cameras, as in those\r\ndays instantaneous photography with wet plates was comparatively\r\nnew, and, being something of an artist as well as a photographer, he\r\ndecided that snapshot photographs of animals and men while running,\r\njumping, and walking would greatly aid artists in transferring to\r\ntheir canvases the exact positions of the figures they wished to\r\npaint. In 1872 the people of California were considerably excited\r\nover the feat of Governor Leland Stanford's trotting horse Occident,\r\nwhich was the first racer west of the Rocky Mountains to make a mile\r\nin two minutes and twenty seconds, and the Governor was having him\r\nphotographed on every occasion.\r\n\r\nGovernor Stanford also wagered that at one time during the trotter's\r\nstride all four feet were off the ground. Muybridge suggested his\r\nplan for photographing the animal's every movement, while running,\r\ntrotting or walking, as a means of settling the bet, and the\r\nGovernor, very much pleased, gave him free access to the stables and\r\nrace course.\r\n\r\nThe photographer built a studio at the course and systematically\r\nwent to work. First, he built a high fence along the track and had\r\nit painted white. Then he securely mounted twenty-four cameras side\r\nby side along the opposite side of the course and stretched thin\r\nsilk threads from the shutter of each camera across the track\r\nabout the height of the horse's knees. Occident was then led out\r\nand ridden along the course so that he would pass between the white\r\nbackground and twenty-four cameras. As he came to each silk thread\r\nhis legs broke it and opened the shutter of the camera to which it\r\nwas attached. Thus the animal photographed himself twenty-four times\r\nas he passed over the track and showed that Governor Stanford's\r\ncontention regarding his movements was correct.\r\n\r\nLaid in consecutive order in which the photographs were taken, each\r\npicture showed a different stage of the horse's movements, and if the\r\nseries of photographs was held together and riffled over the thumb,\r\nso that each one would be visible for just the fraction of a second,\r\nthe impression received, thanks to the persistence of vision, was\r\nthat of a horse in motion. When Muybridge went to Paris the year\r\nafter taking the photographs of Governor Stanford's horse he received\r\na warm welcome from some of the greatest French painters of the day.\r\nHe gave several exhibits of his photographs, but carried the work no\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nAlmost one hundred years before this, several brilliant Frenchmen\r\nwere groping in the darkness for some way of showing motion by\r\nmeans of pictures, and brought forth a device known as the \"Wheel\r\nof Life,\" or the Zoetrope. It was simply an enclosed cylinder, and\r\nupon the inner lower face, which was free to rotate, were placed\r\na series of pictures showing the stages of some simple animation,\r\nin sequence, such as two children seesawing, or a child swinging.\r\nThe upper surface was pierced with long, narrow slits, and when one\r\nlooked through the slits, and the lower surface with the pictures on\r\nit was rotated, one actually saw only one picture at a time, but as\r\nthey passed before the eyes the appearance was of motion. Various\r\nimprovements on this idea were made, and silhouette paintings even\r\nwere thrown on a screen so as to give an illusion of motion.\r\n\r\nThe development of photography was necessary, however, before motion\r\npictures ever could be a success. About the time Muybridge took his\r\npictures the old wet plate was superseded by the dry plate we know\r\nto-day, and scientists began the search for some material from which\r\nthey could make film base.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of films, motion pictures, as they were known\r\nat that time, were used chiefly by scientists in trying to analyze\r\nmotion which cannot be traced by the human eye. Among the leaders in\r\nthis work was the French scientist Dr. E. J. Marey, who studied the\r\nflight of birds and the movements of animals and men so carefully\r\nthat he wrote a book entitled \"Movement,\" which is still used by\r\nauthorities in scientific research.\r\n\r\nDoctor Marey set up another camera at the Physiological Station\r\nin Paris with which he and his associates made pictures of great\r\nscientific value. Those were the days of the early experiment with\r\nflying machines, as will be remembered from Chapter II, and the\r\nFrench inventors made careful studies of Marey's pictures of bird\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nDoctor Marey's stationary camera was a simple bellows type which\r\ntook an exceptionally wide plate. The shutter, which was operated\r\nby a crank, was a disk with slits in it, so that as it turned\r\nit intermittently admitted and shut off the light. Thus, as a\r\nwhite-clothed figure passed a dead-black background, in front of the\r\ncamera, the various stages of its movements in the course of its trip\r\nfrom one side of the camera's focus to the other were faithfully\r\nrecorded on the plate, each slit making an exposure of the image on\r\na different section of the plate, showing the figure in a different\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nMany machines that were merely developments of the old zoetrope\r\nwere brought out both in the United States and Europe, but the\r\ngreatest obstacle to their success was that they were peep-hole\r\nmachines of the kind that flourished in penny arcades a few years\r\nago, rather than devices for throwing pictures on a screen so that\r\na large number of persons could see at the same time. In general,\r\nthese old-fashioned \"moving-picture\" machines were simply cabinets\r\nin which were mounted a series of transparencies made from pictures\r\nrepresenting the stages of some simple animation. An electric light\r\nilluminated the transparencies and they were rotated so that one\r\npicture at a time was seen. In some of the more improved \"wheels of\r\nlife,\" such as were shown in this country, the transparencies in\r\nconsecutive order were mounted on a hub like the spokes of a wheel\r\nand were rotated so that one was seen at a time, very much like the\r\nway Muybridge riffled his horse pictures over his thumb.\r\n\r\nAll this time two American inventors had been at work on the two\r\nmost perplexing problems in animated photography at that time,\r\nand it was through their achievements that the first practical\r\nmotion-picture machine was given to the world, just as it was through\r\nthe achievements of the Wright brothers that the first practical\r\naeroplane was given to the world.\r\n\r\nThese two men were Thomas A. Edison and George Eastman.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison had been working for several years on a motion-picture\r\nmachine, but was handicapped by the lack of a practical film.\r\n\r\nMr. Eastman, after years of experiment, produced the film that made\r\ncinematography possible, in 1889.\r\n\r\nWith a strong transparent film, flexible, and compressible, to take\r\nthe place of the clumsy glass plate, Edison was ready to go ahead\r\nwith his work, started years before, and in 1893 the crowds at the\r\nWorld's Fair in Chicago saw the first motion-picture machine. It was\r\ncalled a Kinetoscope.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of Thomas A. Edison, Inc.\r\n\r\n  THE CORSICAN BROTHERS--A FAMOUS TRICK FILM\r\n\r\n  The parts of the twin brothers in this film were acted by the\r\n  same man, the illusion being accomplished by the double exposure\r\n  trick.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the Vitagraph Company of America\r\n\r\n  THE GUILLOTINE\r\n\r\n  Famous scene from the photoplay based on Dickens's great novel,\r\n  \"A Tale of Two Cities.\"]\r\n\r\nSimple as it was, thousands and thousands dropped nickels into a slot\r\nand peeped into the hole at the \"moving pictures.\" Some of the boys\r\nwho read this may remember machines like it. The mechanism was in a\r\ncabinet in which the pictures were shown on a positive film. This was\r\nabout forty feet long and was strung backward and forward inside the\r\ncabinet on a series of spools in a continuous chain. The film passed\r\nbefore the peep-hole and the pictures were magnified by a lens. They\r\nwere illuminated by an electric lamp behind them. A rotating shutter\r\ncut off the light intermittently, so that each picture was seen for\r\nthe fraction of a second, and then a period of darkness ensued.\r\nThe shutter was the only attempt at intermittent revealing of the\r\npictures, for the film travelled continuously.\r\n\r\nThe camera that Edison invented for taking the pictures shown in his\r\nkinetoscope was in principle about the same as the one described\r\nearlier in this chapter, except that it has been wonderfully improved\r\nin mechanical accuracy and photographic clearness. The hardest\r\nproblem facing him was the machine which would show the pictures to\r\na large number of spectators at the same time and do away with the\r\nold peep-hole machine. The idea of the magic lantern immediately\r\npresented itself, but the inventor quickly saw the necessity of an\r\nintermittent motion, for if the ribbon of pictures was drawn before\r\nthe beam of light fast enough to give the illusion of motion, each\r\npicture was thrown on the screen for such a short time that it was\r\ntoo faint to be seen easily. From this it was to Edison but a step\r\nto a practicable projector, and nothing remained but to improve its\r\nmechanical working.\r\n\r\nGetting motion pictures is the adventurous part of the business, for\r\nthis work requires operators and actors who are athletes and who do\r\nnot know the meaning of fear. As pictures of scenery and events are\r\ntaken in every corner of the world--in the jungles, in the arctic\r\nice, on mountains and in deserts, the photographers all can tell\r\nabsorbing stories of the strange places and things they have filmed.\r\n\r\nIn the rough the films are divided into four great general classes,\r\nwith several special classes besides. They are scenic, industrial\r\n(showing the working of some great industry like steel making),\r\ntopical, and dramatic. Scenic and industrial films are simply taken\r\nat an opportune time, as it is usually not necessary to make any\r\nadvance arrangements, though the photographing may incur great risks.\r\n\r\nTopical films, such as the pictures of the recent Durbar in India\r\nor some other great current event, are very valuable when quickly\r\nsent broadcast. Of course the photographer must have the same news\r\ninstinct that the reporter has to get good topical films, for he\r\nmust get there first and deliver his picture \"story\" to his studio\r\n\"editors\" as quickly as possible. The photographers often have\r\nhair-raising adventures in taking such films, as the single instance\r\nof the man who went up Mount Vesuvius during an eruption and took a\r\ncinematograph film of it will show.\r\n\r\nThe greatest variety of experiences, however, is to be found in the\r\nmaking of dramatic films--that is, motion-picture plays. As every\r\nboy knows, these stories have just as wide a range as the books in a\r\nlibrary. There are plays based on biblical stories, and plays dealing\r\nwith Wild West adventures; there are farces, comedies, and tragedies;\r\nin fact, there is no limit to the variety. These plays, however, can\r\nbe divided roughly into two classes--that is, those that are produced\r\non the motion-picture studio stage and those produced out of doors\r\nwith the natural surroundings as the stage. The interesting things\r\nabout either kind would fill a book the size of this.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of cinematography only simple shows were attempted,\r\nbut now nothing is too big or too complicated or too expensive for\r\nthe big concerns making pictures in the United States and Europe.\r\nThe first motion-picture studio here was simply a portable, glass\r\nroofed, black walled shed set on a pivot in Edison's yard in Orange,\r\nN. J. It was called the Black Maria and makes an interesting contrast\r\nto the great glass studio at Bronx Park, N. Y., costing $100,000,\r\nin which many of the Edison films are now made. All well-equipped\r\nmotion-picture studios these days are fitted out with space for\r\nseveral stages; a great tank for water scenes, carpenter shops,\r\nscene-painting studios, furniture and other stage properties to\r\nfurnish scenes, costumes, stage fittings, and a great corps of\r\nphotographers, mechanics, electricians, etc., besides the company of\r\nwell-paid actors who take part in the shows.\r\n\r\nIf a play is to be reproduced in the studio, the architect draws the\r\nplans for the scenery, which are sent to the stage carpenters, who\r\nmake the framework and stretch the canvas. The blank scenery is then\r\nsent to the racks, where the scene painters get to work on it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the property man at the studio, just like the\r\nproperty man at a theatre, has received a list of the things he will\r\nneed to furnish the scene and give the actors the paraphernalia\r\nnecessary for the carrying out of the play. He ransacks his storeroom\r\nand brings out tables, chairs, pictures, etc. The studio costumer\r\nalso checks off her list and sees that she has in her great wardrobe\r\ncostumes to dress the characters for their parts.\r\n\r\nMeantime the stock company of actors is called together, the\r\nscenario, or plan of the play, is read, and rehearsals begin. All\r\nthis part of it and the rehearsing are very much like the work\r\npreliminary to the staging of a regular play, except that the scenes\r\nare arranged, not according to the size of the stage, but according\r\nto the focus of the camera. Each scene is timed to the second so that\r\nthe pantomime will tell the story but not tire the spectators with\r\nuseless repetition. In rehearsing, the actors sometimes speak their\r\nlines--that is, the words the character would say--just as if they\r\nwere to be heard, because it often helps them to give the proper\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the stage director has one scene of a play down fine,\r\nafter perhaps days or weeks of rehearsing, the photographer is\r\ncalled. He consults with the stage manager, measures off the distance\r\nfor his focus, so that he will get all that is necessary into the\r\npicture, and nothing that is not wanted; and after seeing that every\r\ndetail is attended to, the great battery of arc lights overhead is\r\nturned on, and the stage manager says, \"GO!\"\r\n\r\nThe photographer begins to turn his crank, keeping one eye on the\r\nstage and the other on his stop watch, and the stage director counts\r\noff the seconds, meanwhile shouting instruction to the actors on\r\nthe stage. To an outsider the noises sound like a riot or a street\r\nfair rather than a theatrical performance timed to the fraction\r\nof a second in which the movement of an eye counts in the final\r\neffect. While the camera clicks off sixteen instantaneous snapshots\r\nto the second the stage director calls out the seconds, \"One, two,\r\nthree. One, two, three. Look out there, don't get out of focus! Keep\r\ntoward the centre of the stage. Now, Jim, run in and grab the book\r\nagent--hurry, look angry! One, two, three. That's fine! Hey, there!\r\nshake your fist.\" And so it goes, until the director rings a bell\r\nor shouts, \"That's all!\" and the scene is ended. Just as the last\r\npictures are being run off, a stage hand rushes into the scene and\r\nholds up a large placard with a big number on it. This number is\r\nthe number of the scene in the play, and is watched by the men and\r\nwomen in the assembling room when they gather the various scenes of\r\na picture play together and join them up in the proper order for one\r\ncontinuous roll. Of course in the joining the number is cut out of\r\nthe picture for projection.\r\n\r\nIt very often happens that a stage director in his effort to get a\r\ngraphic story reproduced on the film takes a great many more pictures\r\nthan can be crowded within the limits set for the play. Then with\r\nthe scenario in front of him, and a good magnifying glass to bring\r\nout the detail of the pictures, he takes his scissors, just as the\r\neditor takes his blue pencil, and begins cutting from the story the\r\nunnecessary pictures, just as the newspaper or magazine editor cuts\r\nuseless paragraphs from the story or article. He must not cut out any\r\npicture that helps to tell the story, and yet he must sometimes cut\r\nout as much as 400 feet of film. He \"kills\" an unnecessary picture\r\nhere, and an unnecessary picture there, and adds up their length\r\nuntil the story has been reduced to the proper size.\r\n\r\nAlthough spectacles such as the one in the picture representing a\r\nbattle on a bridge, and others even larger, are staged in the various\r\nbig motion-picture studios, the most exciting work in the filming of\r\nmotion-picture plays is out of doors where the natural surroundings\r\nmake the stage. A great many of the shows seen to-day are taken this\r\nway, with real trees, real water, real mountains, or real streets\r\naffording the settings. Hence with studios in which battle scenes,\r\nriot scenes, water scenes, and practically any indoor scene can\r\nbe reproduced; and also the great outdoors at the disposal of the\r\ncinematographer, there is practically no limit to the subjects that\r\ncan be turned into dramatic films for the education and amusement of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nA few instances of the plays made out of doors will serve to show the\r\nlimits to which the producers are willing to go to get new shows. The\r\nEdison company, with its big studio in New York and its manufacturing\r\nplant at West Orange, N. J., in the heart of the country where the\r\nRevolutionary War was fought, is reproducing a whole series of\r\nfilms of American history. These, so far as possible, are made on\r\nthe exact spots where the dramatic events occurred. The first of\r\nthe series entitled, \"The Minute Men,\" was taken near Boston, where\r\nthose historic defenders of liberty fought for their country. In this\r\nfilm is the famous scene representing the Battle of Concord, which\r\nwas taken on practically the identical ground where the battle was\r\nfought. The producers spent a great deal of time in planning this\r\nseries of pictures and so far as possible had every historical fact\r\ncorrect, so that the value of the series from the educational point\r\nof view is apparent. The other titles in the series will show how the\r\nscenes of the Revolutionary War were brought home to the American\r\npeople. They included \"The Capture of Fort Ticonderoga,\" \"The Battle\r\nof Bunker Hill,\" \"The Declaration of Independence,\" \"The Death of\r\nNathan Hale,\" \"How Washington Crossed the Delaware,\" \"Church and\r\nCountry; an Episode of the Winter at Valley Forge,\" and so on. The\r\nfilm dealing with Washington's trip across the Delaware in the ice\r\nwas made under conditions as nearly like those of the actual events\r\nas possible to get them. The pictures were taken during the coldest\r\npart of last winter (1912), and the photograph opposite page 193 was\r\ntaken while the big scene was being acted out. This was taken in an\r\narm of Pelham Bay, near New York, and the \"scene shifters\" had to\r\nwork for hours in the bitter cold breaking up the ice and shifting\r\naround the great cakes in order to get the desired effect. Their\r\nsuccess is attested by the picture reproduced here.\r\n\r\nThe Selig Company, with studios in Chicago and Los Angeles, and big\r\nstock companies of actors in both places also take some wonderful\r\noutdoor films. One of these was a play representing life in the\r\nAfrican jungle, for which a special trainload of actors, and a whole\r\nmenagerie of elephants, camels, lions, rhinos, leopards, pumas,\r\nzebras, and other animals, were shipped to Florida, where scenes much\r\nlike those in Africa were found. This same company also sent a stock\r\ncompany and a corps of photographers to the Far North, where a film\r\nplay was made amid the Arctic ice.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago studio of this concern is one of the wonders of\r\ncinematography, for not only has it a great building in which indoor\r\nplays are filmed, but a great land reserve for outdoor productions.\r\nIn one place are artificial hills built in the natural forest, and\r\nupon them artificial feudal castles. In another are log cabins for\r\nfrontier scenes, and in yet another a barren stretch for other kinds\r\nof scenes. The Los Angeles company is close to the mountains, the\r\nocean, and the Great American Desert, so that it can furnish material\r\nfor an endless amount of exciting Wild West shows.\r\n\r\nOne of the big films made in Europe was \"The Fall of Troy,\" produced\r\nby the Itala Film Company, which reproduced the great wooden horse,\r\nthe walls of Troy, and all other historical details. The great\r\nFrench, German, and English companies also have made big films.\r\n\r\nIn the production of plays built on well-known novels the\r\nmotion-picture industry has found one of its most successful fields.\r\nDickens's great novel, \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" afforded the\r\nVitagraph Company of America, one of its best films, while James\r\nFennimore Cooper, Alexander Dumas, and even Shakespeare, and grand\r\nopera have been transferred to the cinematograph. From the great\r\nBiblical stories also have been taken films that have been shown by\r\nmissionaries, and others interested in religious work, all over the\r\nworld. The \"Passion Play\" was one of the first long films ever shown\r\nand it made a tremendous success.\r\n\r\nBig spectacles are always popular and to fulfill the demand two\r\nlocomotives have been run together at high speed, the motion-picture\r\nconcern buying the machines outright for the purpose and leasing the\r\nrailroad for a day; an automobile has been driven over the Palisades\r\nof the Hudson River, ships have been towed out into the ocean and\r\nblown up and whole towns of flimsy stage construction have been built\r\nonly to be burned, while the motion-picture photographer recorded\r\nthe whole thing on a film. One concern even got permission from the\r\nLos Angeles Fire department during a big fire, and dressing an actor\r\nas a fireman cinematographed him as he heroically rushed up a ladder\r\namidst the flames and rescued a screaming woman from an upper window.\r\nThe woman was an actress who had risked her life to go into the\r\nburning building and be rescued.\r\n\r\nOf course the great motion-picture industry has not been without its\r\nfatal accidents. Several times actors playing the parts of men in\r\ndifficulty in the water have actually been seized with cramps and\r\nhave drowned before the eyes of the spectators. One time a picture\r\nwas being taken of a band of train wreckers who were supposed to tie\r\nthe switchman to the track. The train was supposed to stop just short\r\nof the man, but it actually ran over and killed him. The pictures\r\nwere used at the inquest. During the filming of war pictures there\r\nhave been explosions of gunpowder that were not intended, and in the\r\ntaking of pictures of wild animals in their native haunts and in\r\nmenageries, several photographers have been badly injured.\r\n\r\nThere is another big and important department in the filming of\r\nmotion picture plays in trick photography. Every one who reads\r\nthis has seen at the picture-theatre films of things that he knows\r\nperfectly well never could have happened--men walking on the ceiling,\r\nfairies the size of a match acting on a table beside a man, a saw\r\ngoing through a board, a piece of furniture assembling itself, a man\r\nrun over by an automobile, his legs cut off, and then stuck on again\r\nall within a few minutes, marvellous railroad wrecks, and a thousand\r\nother things which could not happen or which the motion-picture\r\nphotographer probably never could catch in his lens. All of these\r\nthings are done through trick photography.\r\n\r\nDouble exposure, double printing, and the stop motion are the most\r\ncommon methods of obtaining these marvellous results. Opposite page\r\n200 is a picture obtained during the reproduction by the Edison\r\nCompany of Alexander Dumas's novel, \"The Corsican Brothers.\" This\r\nfilm was obtained completely by the double exposure. In the story,\r\nthe two brothers are twins so much alike that they cannot be told\r\napart. They act exactly alike, and one even feels what, the other\r\nfeels. In making the film the producers decided that it would be\r\nimpossible to get two actors that looked enough alike to take the\r\nparts of the two brothers, so the same man acted both parts. In the\r\npicture referred to the brothers sitting at table with their mother\r\nare one and the same actor.\r\n\r\nThe picture was made by blocking off the whole left half side of the\r\nfilm with black paper and running it through the camera while the\r\nactor played the part of the brother on the right side of the table.\r\nHe was timed to the fraction of a second, and when the exposed half\r\nof the film was blocked off with paper and the unexposed half run\r\nthrough, he acted out his part on the left side of the table, to\r\nthis time schedule. So exact was his work that when the brother on\r\none side of the table spilled a drop of hot coffee on his hand and\r\nstarted in pain, the brother on the other side, feeling the same pain\r\nas his counterpart, jumped at exactly the same second.\r\n\r\nAnother popular trick with the double exposure is a scene showing\r\nmermaids or divers swimming or walking at the bottom of the sea.\r\nFirst a large brilliantly lighted glass tank is set up in the studio,\r\nstocked with fish and sea life, and photographed. In this kind of a\r\nfilm the images of the real water are a little under exposed. Next a\r\nspace the size of the tank is measured off on the floor with a gray\r\nscene laid flat. On the scene are painted faint lines to indicate\r\nwater, and faint outlines of fish, seaweed, etc. Then the actress\r\ndressed for the part of a mermaid lies flat on the setting and goes\r\nthrough the graceful motions of swimming while the film upon which\r\nthe real water pictures were taken, is run through the camera, which\r\nis placed above her with the lens pointing directly downward.\r\n\r\nAnother example of double exposure is seen in most films where\r\nLilliputians or small fairies enter into the picture. The parts\r\nof both full-grown human beings and diminutive fairies are played\r\nalike by adult actors, but the difference in their size is obtained\r\nby taking each on the same film at different times. For instance,\r\nsuppose a tiny fairy is supposed to appear to a grown man in the\r\npicture play. First the man goes through his act with the camera\r\nphotographing him from a distance of about fifteen feet. Next the\r\nfairy goes through her act, bowing, etc., to the place where the man\r\nstood and is photographed on the film from a distance of say one\r\nhundred and fifty feet. The two impressions when printed give a\r\nlifelike effect of a full-grown man and a tiny sprite.\r\n\r\nThere are numberless films made by the stop-motion system, which\r\nsimply means that the stage hands rush in and arrange things while\r\nthe shutter is closed. All pictures in which you see a man or a woman\r\nfalling off a roof or out of a window and subsequently getting up\r\nand running away are made by this system. The Edison film showing an\r\nautomobile going over the Palisades and the driver being hurled to\r\nthe rocks below was done with the stop motion. It is very simple. The\r\ncinematographer photographed the approach of the automobile and the\r\nhuman driver in the seat approaching the cliff at terrific speed. He\r\nstopped his camera, the automobile came to a stop, the automobilist\r\ngot out and a dummy was placed in his seat. Then by starting the\r\nautomobile a little back of where it was slowed down and stopped, and\r\nphotographing, it the public could not tell that it had been stopped,\r\nand that the man in the seat who was hurled to the rocks below with\r\nthe machine was a dummy.\r\n\r\nA development of this is the picture-a-turn motion, which simply\r\nmeans that with each turn of the crank of the camera one exposure\r\nis made. By this trick many of the strangest films seen are made\r\npossible. The magic carpenter shop where saws and hammers move\r\nwithout human aid is an example. It is simply done by stage hands who\r\nrush on to the stage between each turn of the camera and advance\r\nthe tools to one more stage of progress. The saw is at the top of\r\nthe board, and the hammer is suspended in air (by invisible wires),\r\netc. In the next picture, the saw is in different position, and the\r\nhammer has descended to the head of a nail. In this way all the\r\nmagical effects of inanimate objects taking on life in the film are\r\naccomplished. One of the interesting details is the appearance of\r\nsuch objects as boards rising from the floor and placing themselves\r\nupon the bench ready for the saw. To do this the operator, keeping\r\nhis shutter closed, advances his film a couple of feet and takes a\r\npicture of the board falling to the floor from the bench (pulled off\r\nby an invisible wire). As the film is moving backward, the picture\r\nwhen exhibited in sequence shows the board not falling but rising\r\nfrom the floor, and placing itself on the bench in a most mysterious\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMoving the film backward will give many strange results. For\r\ninstance, in the plays where a little child is snatched from death\r\nunder the wheels of an onrushing train just as the cow-catcher is\r\nupon her, it is no longer necessary to risk human lives before\r\ntrains. First, the onrushing train is photographed with the film\r\nmoving forward right up to the point where the child is to be\r\nstanding when rescued. Then the train is allowed to run on past the\r\npoint. It is then backed up at high speed, and the film run backward.\r\nWhen the locomotive rushes past the spot where the child is to be\r\nrescued her heroic rescuer simply dashes on to the tracks amid the\r\ndust of the receding train and places the child between the rails.\r\nWhen this section of film, which is taken backward, is fitted into\r\nthe rest of the ribbon, and is run through the projector forward, it\r\nlooks as if the rescuer rushed on to the track and grabbed the child\r\nout of the way as the train passed by.\r\n\r\nAnother popular trick by which fairies or ghosts are made to appear\r\ngradually in motion-picture scenes is the one by which the lens\r\nis narrowed down or opened up gradually. If a ghost is to appear,\r\nthe hole through which the light strikes the lens is narrowed down\r\nso that only the brightest objects are photographed. The hole is\r\ngradually enlarged so that the light increases and brings out the\r\nfigures plainer and plainer, until the ghost is in full view.\r\n\r\nA great many good films, such as railroad wrecks, automobile\r\njourneys through the clouds, etc., are made with models, propelled\r\nby invisible strings over skilfully built scenery. The scene of\r\nfigures walking on the ceiling is very simple inasmuch as it is only\r\nnecessary to set the floor of the stage to represent a ceiling and\r\ntake the pictures with the camera upside down. Men and animals can be\r\nmade to run up the sides of buildings, simply by laying the scenery\r\non the studio floor, and photographing the whole thing from above.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A ROMANCE OF THE ICE FIELDS\r\n\r\n  This film was taken in the dead of winter, and the man is in a\r\n  dangerous position on a real ice cake.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SPANISH CAVALIER\r\n\r\n  A whole motion-picture outfit was taken to Bermuda to get this\r\n  photoplay.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ALL READY FOR A THERMIT WELD\r\n\r\n  After the little hole at the bottom of the weld, through which\r\n  the redhot shaft inside shows, is plugged up, the thermit is\r\n  ignited.]\r\n\r\nOf the recent developments in cinematography the ones we hear\r\nmost about are colour pictures and talking pictures. So far, these\r\ntwo points which would give the last touch of realism to the scenes\r\nthrown on the screen are in a very imperfect state of development,\r\nbut it is safe to say that it will not be very many years before we\r\nwill have them duplicating what we see and hear in actual life just\r\nas faithfully as the black and white pictures now duplicate motion.\r\n\r\nScience so far has not given us a method of actually taking a\r\nmotion-picture negative in the natural colours, such as now can be\r\ntaken in still photography, so at first the pictures were coloured\r\nby hand, and later by stencils. This is a difficult and a tedious\r\nundertaking, however, and newer methods have been introduced.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are several systems being worked out the one best\r\nknown is the Kinemacolour, which achieved its greatest fame by\r\nshowing the pictures of the coronation of King George in England, and\r\nthe Durbar in India in colours. The Kinemacolour system is simply one\r\nof photographing and projecting through screens of red and green.\r\nThe shutter of the camera is made up of four parts, as follows: a\r\ntransparent red screen, an opaque space, a transparent green screen,\r\nand another opaque space. Thus, by the law of colours laid down by\r\nscience, when one picture is photographed through a red screen, all\r\nthe different tones but red are arrested by the screen, and only the\r\nobjects having shades of red are photographed. Next, when the green\r\nscreen exposes the next space of three quarters of an inch, only the\r\nobjects having green tints are photographed, as all other tints are\r\narrested by the green screen.\r\n\r\nThe film itself shows no colour other than black and white, but when\r\nit is projected through a shutter that works exactly the same as\r\nthe camera shutter the pictures show the objects in their natural\r\ncolours. That is, the alternating pictures taken through the red\r\nscreen and shown through a screen of the same colour show all the\r\ntones of red, while the alternating pictures taken through the green\r\nscreen and likewise projected through a green screen show all the\r\ntones in which appear green. Thus, with the aid of the persistence of\r\nvision and a somewhat faster system of photographing and projecting,\r\nthe tones blend and we see on the screen at the same instant\r\nred-coated soldiers marching past beautiful green trees, and so on.\r\nIn order to make this possible it is necessary to give the films a\r\ntreatment in a solution that makes them more sensitive to all light\r\nthan they would be for ordinary cinematography.\r\n\r\nThe drawback to the system, as you will have noticed if you have\r\nseen these pictures, is that red and green do not make up all\r\nthe _primary_ colours of light. In the direct rays of light (not\r\nreflected light as from a painted wall) the primary colours, from\r\nwhich all the other tones are obtained, are red, green, and violet,\r\nbut it has been found a little too difficult a mechanical process to\r\nuse the three screens instead of only two.\r\n\r\nThe hardest job of the inventors of talking pictures was to work\r\nout a mechanical device that would make a good phonograph and a\r\nmotion-picture projector keep step, so that, for instance, the\r\nactor would not be heard singing after the pictures had shown him\r\nclose his mouth and leave the stage. Ever since his invention of\r\nthe Kinetoscope, Edison has had this very thing in mind, and has\r\nprophesied that in the near future grand opera with motion pictures\r\nand phonographs will be within the means of every patron of the\r\nmotion-picture theatre. Edison's idea for obtaining this is to make\r\nthe phonographic and the cinematographic records at the same time in\r\norder to insure perfect accuracy of sound and appearance, and his\r\nexperiments are meeting with success.\r\n\r\nA fairly successful device for giving the phonograph and the\r\nprojector synchronism, or, in other words, keeping them in step, has\r\nbeen worked out by the Gaumont firm of Paris. The phonograph and the\r\nprojector are run by two motors of exactly the same size and power,\r\nfrom the same wires. The armatures of the motors are divided into an\r\nequal number of sections, and each section of one is connected with\r\nthe corresponding section in the armature of the other, so that one\r\ncannot rotate for the fraction of a second unless the other rotates\r\nwith it. A little switch working on another motor, which works on\r\na set of gears, will speed up or slacken down the talking machine\r\nso that if the armatures get \"out of step\" one can be speeded up or\r\nslowed down so that the figures in the pictures will appear to be\r\ntalking, laughing, or singing, just as they do in real life.\r\n\r\nAnother of the recent developments in cinematography is the di-optic\r\nsystem which aims to show every stage of the motion of figures,\r\ninstead of the stage of motion every sixteenth of a second, as is in\r\nthe case with the usual apparatus. The di-optic camera is simply two\r\nmachines set side by side in one. It takes two loads of film, has\r\ntwo film gates, and two lenses, but works by turning one crank. The\r\nsingle shutter revolves in front of the twin lens, so that when one\r\nside is exposing a length of film the other is closed and the film is\r\nadvancing. The two rolls of negative exposed in this way record the\r\ncomplete motions of the figures before the camera. The projector also\r\nis a di-optic machine working in the same manner as the double-eyed\r\ncamera, so that when the pictures are thrown on the screen they are\r\nseen practically constantly, instead of every sixteenth of a second,\r\nfor while one is hidden by the shutter, another is thrown on the\r\nscreen. Also inventors are working on a scheme for taking motion\r\npictures on glass plates instead of on films.\r\n\r\nAs was mentioned previously the use of the motion-picture machine\r\nhas been very valuable to science, and by adapting the cinematograph\r\nto a powerful microscope a great many motion pictures of the life\r\nof bacteria have been obtained. Also motion pictures are sometimes\r\nmade of surgical operations. Carrying this work even farther still,\r\nanimated photography and X-ray photography have been joined so that\r\nscience now can make motion pictures of the processes that go on\r\ninside small animals.\r\n\r\nOwing to difficulties not yet overcome moving X-ray pictures\r\ncannot be taken of the human body at this time. Röntgen rays\r\ncannot be refracted, or collected in a lens. Hence the film for an\r\nX-ray picture must be equal in size to the picture desired. It is\r\nimpossible to increase the size of cinematograph films with much\r\nsuccess because of the danger of breaking or tearing them when under\r\nthe strain of the rapid course they must pursue through camera\r\nand projector. These facts made it necessary for the scientists\r\nexperimenting with X-ray motion pictures to photograph only animals,\r\nbut they were greatly encouraged because they obtained some excellent\r\nviews of the digestive processes of mice, guinea-pigs, fowls,\r\nand other small animals. The bones of the human hand also were\r\nphotographed while the hand was opened and closed.\r\n\r\nM. J. Garvallo, who carried on a great many interesting experiments\r\nin France with this type of motion pictures, used a somewhat larger\r\nand more sensitive film than the standard, combined with an apparatus\r\ntoo complex for attention here. This phase of cinematography,\r\nhowever, is still in its infancy and we can look for great\r\nimprovements at an early date.\r\n\r\nAnother Frenchman, Prof. Lucien Bull, who was one of Doctor Marey's\r\nassistants in the early stages of cinematography, has made pictures\r\nof the movement of the wings of various insects such as flies,\r\nbees, wasps, etc. To do this he has had to make the fastest known\r\ncinematograph. It was an especially constructed apparatus entirely\r\nunlike the ones described here, but through the agency of an\r\nelectrical spark which illuminated the vicinity in which the insect\r\nflew, 2,000 pictures per second were taken, instead of the usual\r\nsixteen.\r\n\r\nThe very antithesis of the scientific are the uses of the\r\nmotion-picture film as an illustrated magazine or newspaper. There\r\nare only a few successful \"animated newspapers\" in the world, but\r\nthe idea will probably spread. The staff of such a publication is\r\nmade up of photographers, who are scattered about in every nation on\r\nthe globe. There are regular offices in all the big cities which are\r\nready at a moment's notice to send photographers to any part of their\r\nterritory. These photographers get films of all the important news\r\noccurrences of the day, parades, street demonstrations, wrecks, fires\r\nand whatever else fills the newspapers you read every day. The films\r\nare hurried to the main office where they are developed, cut down to\r\nshort \"items,\" or allowed to run as long, \"stories\" just like in a\r\nregular newspaper, pasted together with suitable headlines, printed\r\nin one continuous roll of about 1,000 feet and rushed out to the\r\nsubscribers, who are usually theatres with audiences eager for the\r\n\"paper.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of the many motion-picture activities which have\r\nsprung up in the last few years, and made it possible for us to\r\nsee whatever is interesting in any part of the world, on the\r\ncinematograph screen. Beside the professional cinematographers,\r\nthere are of course any number of smart boys and young men who are\r\nhaving fine times with the amateur projecting outfits sold by the big\r\nmakers of apparatus. These machines run from mere toys made up for a\r\nlittle roll of film, already prepared, to projectors with which very\r\ncreditable parlour shows can be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSTEEL BOILED LIKE WATER AND CUT LIKE PAPER\r\n\r\n   OUR BOY FRIEND SEES HOW SCIENCE HAS TURNED THE GREATEST KNOWN\r\n   HEATS TO THE EVERYDAY USE OF MANKIND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HOW hot is it in that furnace?\" asked the scientist's young friend\r\nas he poked about the laboratory one day.\r\n\r\n\"That is not very hot now, but we could increase the temperature to\r\nabout 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit if we tried hard enough,\" answered\r\nthe man who, outside of his work, enjoyed best of all the visits of\r\nthe boy. \"But the heat of the laboratory furnace most of the time is\r\nnothing compared to the heat that we can put to practical use through\r\na couple of new inventions I have been trying here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they for?\" asked the boy, immediately all interest, for\r\nhe was a member of the metalworking class in his school, and was\r\nconstantly on the lookout for better ways of working in iron, steel,\r\ncopper, and brass.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THERMIT IN ERUPTION\r\n\r\n  With a blinding, dazzling glare and a gentle hissing the thermit\r\n  in a white-hot molten mass fills the mould and runs down the\r\n  sides like volcanic lava.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DR. HANS GOLDSCHMIDT\r\n\r\n  The inventor of Thermit.]\r\n\r\n\"Well, they both are used in welding metals and in one--the\r\nthermit process--the hardest steel can be reduced to a molten mass of\r\nwhite hot metal boiling like a tea kettle on a stove, in about a half\r\na minute. You see that requires a great deal of heat,\" continued the\r\nchemist, \"and in fact the temperature is 5,400 degrees, Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\"The other process that I have been trying is known as autogenous\r\nwelding, and in this even a greater temperature is generated than\r\nby the thermit process. In the tiny flame no bigger than the point\r\nof this pencil that comes from the autogenous welding torch the\r\ntemperature is about 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\"\r\n\r\n\"My!\" said the boy, \"how could any one ever measure such a heat as\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Science teaches us how to do that just as science taught us how to\r\nproduce these great heats. Why, you know, in the electrical furnaces\r\nat Niagara Falls they produce a heat that they think reaches the\r\n10,000 degrees of the sun. Outside of that, however, the thermit\r\nprocess and the autogenous welding process attain the greatest known\r\nheats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those must be fine,\" said the boy, \"because before our schools began\r\nto teach metal working, I used to play blacksmith and heat pieces of\r\niron in the fire, but I could never do anything with it, and now that\r\nwe are learning welding in the blacksmith shop at school I see what a\r\nhard job it is. I wish we could use these processes at school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will be able to use them some day,\" said the scientist,\r\n\"but it took science a long time to find out how to produce and use\r\nvery high temperatures.\r\n\r\n\"In the stone age, thousands and thousands of years ago, when men\r\nlived in caves and ate raw the animals that they caught with their\r\nhands, fire was first discovered by an accident. There are many\r\nlegends of how the hairy savages that populated the earth fell down\r\nand worshipped the aboriginal scientist who taught them how to warm\r\ntheir caves.\r\n\r\n\"Soon, however, fire became a necessity of life to mankind, for it\r\nwas discovered that meat tasted better when exposed to a flame--that,\r\nis, when it was cooked--than when it was raw. That was a big step\r\ntoward civilization, but it was a bigger one when some wild mountain\r\ntribe found that they could make much more deadly weapons than the\r\nrude ones they chipped from flint, by melting down a certain kind of\r\nrock and fashioning it into spear heads, arrow heads, and hatchets.\r\nFrom that time on the development of the art of metal working took\r\nonly a few thousand years, until to-day man's great knowledge of\r\nmetalurgy has enabled him to make such tremendous fighting machines\r\nthat war is becoming entirely too destructive, and too expensive a\r\nthing to rush into lightly. Thus, heat and metal working are helping\r\nto force the world forward to another step in civilization--universal\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"After learning how to make these hardest of metals, man has now\r\nsolved the problem of making them boil like water with the thermit\r\nprocess and of cutting them like paper with the oxy-acetylene gas\r\ntorch, all in less than a minute.\r\n\r\n\"You see this bag of coarse black powder that looks like iron\r\nfilings? Well, it is the thermit. Put it into a crucible, set off a\r\npinch of ignition powder on the top, and the whole thing will ignite\r\nin half a minute, throwing off a blinding white light and thousands\r\nof sparks like beautiful fire works. That is the thermit reaction.\r\n\r\n\"You know more about the oxy-acetylene gas torch, for in your metal\r\nworking at school you used the gas blowpipe to make a very hot flame.\r\nThe oxy-acetylene gas torch is just a high development of this, for\r\ninstead of ordinary gas, acetylene is used and instead of air we use\r\npure oxygen.\"\r\n\r\nThe caller sat down and asked his friend to tell something more about\r\nthese two marvelous inventions. The story was several days in the\r\ntelling, for there were visits to foundries and experiments in the\r\nlaboratory, besides many long talks.\r\n\r\n\"First we will see about thermit,\" said the man, and began to talk as\r\nhe worked over a crucible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERMIT HEAT PROCESS\r\n\r\nAs a result of his discovery that by starting a terrific battle for\r\noxygen between two metals he could reduce one of them to almost\r\nabsolute purity, Dr. Hans Goldschmidt has converted to the use of man\r\na process of welding so simple and yet so forceful that it is making\r\nworld-wide changes in the working of metals. This battle itself is\r\nthe most interesting feature of the Goldschmidt process because of\r\nthe terrific heat it generates.\r\n\r\nImagine sticking your finger into boiling water. By so doing you\r\nwould be exposing your flesh to a temperature of 212 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. Imagine sticking your finger into a pot of molten lead if\r\neven for the fraction of a second. You know very well what the effect\r\nwould be. The temperature is 618 degrees Fahrenheit. Still again,\r\nthink of a redhot iron. This is about 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit. Steel\r\nboils at 3,500 degrees.\r\n\r\nThey are all hot enough, but compare them with the temperature of\r\n5,400 degrees Fahrenheit or about 3,000 degrees Centigrade, which\r\nis attained by the thermit reaction. The range of temperature in\r\nwhich we can live extends from a little over 100 degrees to 70 or 80\r\ndegrees below zero, and yet man can so direct the heat of the thermit\r\nreaction that it will work for him.\r\n\r\nThe commonest use of the process is in welding steel or iron, such\r\nas broken parts of machinery and welding steel rails, and steel or\r\niron pipes. Besides this, the thermit process will reduce many metals\r\nto a high degree of purity. After spending a few minutes in seeing\r\nhow the inventor of this process came to discover it, we will take a\r\nlittle trip in our mind's eye to some of the places where the thermit\r\nprocess is in use, and see what happens.\r\n\r\nAs you know, metals rarely come from the mines in a state of purity.\r\nThey usually are very much mixed up with rock, slag, and other\r\nminerals, so that it takes a complicated process called smelting to\r\nseparate them. Even then they are not pure, and more complicated\r\nprocesses have to be gone through with. Oxides, or metals that have\r\nbeen oxidized, are common because oxidization merely means that the\r\nmetal has been burned so that each atom of metal has taken up an\r\natom of oxygen to make what is called a molecule of oxide. Iron ore\r\nis usually found in the form of iron oxide, because when this great\r\nearth was nothing but a swirling ball of burning gases, probably as\r\nhot as the sun, gradually cooling and forming a great cauldron of\r\nmolten matter, boiling and bubbling more fiercely than the hottest\r\ncauldron of molten metal in any steel mill, much of the matter\r\nthat later became iron ore was burned or oxidized. Other chemical\r\nactions too technical for our attention just now were responsible for\r\nother forms of ore, such as sulphides, etc. When the earth cooled\r\nsufficiently to become solid, these things were completed, and they\r\nonly had to remain hidden away under the surface for ages and ages\r\nuntil a little man who could live but a hundred years at the utmost\r\nsolved the deepest secrets of the earth's formation.\r\n\r\nThus, to obtain pure metals the oxygen must be removed from the\r\noxide. In other words, it must be reduced. Plainly such reduction\r\nwas a problem of smelting, but Doctor Goldschmidt in his efforts to\r\nobtain purity was working along lines of smelting, in his little\r\nGerman laboratory, very different from the ones in general use.\r\n\r\nHis first object was to reduce iron oxides. First, he knew that\r\naluminum has a great affinity for oxygen, or, in other words, when\r\nthe two are heated will absorb oxygen like a sponge will absorb\r\nwater, only more forcibly and more violently than any such comparison\r\neven faintly suggests. In yet other words, aluminum wants oxygen\r\nmore than any other metal does. Of course no chemical changes would\r\noccur if a piece of iron oxide and a piece of aluminum were set side\r\nby side, any more than we would have gunpowder if we set a chunk of\r\nsaltpetre, a chunk of sulphur, and a chunk of charcoal all in a row.\r\nThe iron oxide and the aluminum would have to be mixed by cutting\r\nor filing them into small pieces and making a coarse powder. Still\r\nnothing would happen without heat to start it.\r\n\r\nIf you collected some flakes of iron oxide in the palm of your hand\r\nthey wouldn't look to you like very promising material for a bonfire,\r\nand you wouldn't be in any danger of an explosion, but you would\r\nhave something in your hand that would burn, nevertheless. If you\r\nsprinkled your iron filings over a gas flame, Welsbach burner, or\r\nover a common lamp chimney the heat would cause them to splutter and\r\nfly out with all the brilliancy you know so well when the blacksmith\r\ngives the redhot horseshoe the first pound.\r\n\r\nOf course Doctor Goldschmidt knew all this, just as he knew that\r\nthe way the aluminum would take the oxygen away from the iron oxide\r\nwas through heating the coarse powder of filings to a very high\r\ntemperature. But this was attended with serious troubles and many\r\ntimes the German scientist came near losing his life in explosions in\r\nhis laboratory.\r\n\r\nAt first he failed to get the mixture hot enough and nothing\r\nhappened. Bit by bit he increased the heat under the crucible\r\ncontaining the filings until it reached about 3,000 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. At this point the metals were hot enough to fuse or run\r\ntogether and the whole thing reacted with such violence that it\r\namounted to an explosion. What really happened was that the mass\r\nreached the temperature where the aluminum could take the oxygen\r\nfrom the iron oxide, and it did so with such force that an explosion\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nDoctor Goldschmidt then saw his problem. It was that of devising some\r\nway of heating the mixture to a temperature sufficient to gain the\r\nreaction, but without an explosion.\r\n\r\nAfter trying everything that he could think of, he conceived the plan\r\nof leaving the crucible in the open air and starting the heat at just\r\none point first, instead of heating the whole thing in a furnace.\r\nHe did this with a pinch of ignition powder placed on the top of\r\nhis pile of iron oxide and aluminum. The ignition powder was simply\r\nlighted with a match.\r\n\r\nWhat happened?\r\n\r\nThermit was discovered.\r\n\r\nThe heat, or reaction started at one point, gradually spread through\r\nthe whole mass, and reduced it to white-hot molten material.\r\n\r\nIn other words the application of intense heat at one point in the\r\nmixture was sufficient to fuse the metals and start the battle\r\nbetween the iron oxide on one side and the aluminum on the other, in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the point where the heat was applied. As\r\nthe few particles set off by the ignition powder struggled for the\r\noxygen they themselves generated heat--terriffic heat--which gave\r\na high enough temperature to start the particles that were their\r\nnext-door neighbours to struggling for the oxygen. These in turn\r\ngenerated heat to set off their own neighbours, and so it went.\r\n\r\nIn far less time than it takes to read this, Doctor Goldschmidt\r\nsaw the whole crucible of dead mineral particles take on life and\r\nbecome white-hot liquid metal. Scientifically speaking, the reaction\r\nhad spread through the whole mass in less than a minute, but what\r\nDoctor Goldschmidt saw was a blinding white light, more intense than\r\nany arc lamp, throwing off a little cloud of white smoke or vapour.\r\nApparently the whole thing was burning up. He only heard a little\r\nhissing as the metals battled for the precious oxygen.\r\n\r\nThere was no explosion, there was no violent scattering of molten\r\nparticles, and there were no noxious life-destroying gases such as\r\ncome from the explosion of gunpowder, dynamite, or even the burning\r\nof coal. And yet the seething, molten metals in the crucible reached\r\na temperature second or third to the highest ever registered by man.\r\nFive thousand four hundred degrees--think of it!--more than half as\r\nhot as science tells us is the sun which makes this world of ours\r\nhabitable.\r\n\r\nBut what was the result of this temperature which staggers the\r\nimagination?\r\n\r\nJust this. Doctor Goldschmidt knew that the aluminum had won the\r\nprize of battle and had paid the price of victory.\r\n\r\nThe conquered iron was at the bottom of the crucible, a molten mass\r\nof pure metal, while the victorious aluminum, seething on the top,\r\nwas nothing but slag (aluminum oxide).\r\n\r\nPerhaps there may be a little lesson in this drama of the metals,\r\nbecause while the iron was vanquished it emerged from the stress of\r\nconflict purified and fitted for its high service to mankind, while\r\nthe more aggressive aluminum came to the top an almost useless\r\nproduct, ruined by the prize for which it had fought.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point about this reaction is that the heat\r\nproduced by a certain quantity of the mixture is no greater in total\r\nvolume than the heat that would be produced by the burning of an\r\nequal amount of anthracite coal. The difference is that the thermit\r\nprocess concentrates all the heat in a few seconds whereas the coal\r\ngives off its heat bit by bit for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of filings used in this process is called thermit. A\r\ntechnical definition of the product is as follows: \"Thermit is a\r\nmixture of finely divided aluminum and iron oxide. When ignited in\r\none spot, the combustion so started continues throughout the entire\r\nmass without supply of heat or power from outside and produces\r\nsuperheated liquid steel and superheated liquid slag (aluminum\r\noxide).\"\r\n\r\nThus the makers of thermit call the pure metal that results from the\r\ncombustion, thermit steel.\r\n\r\nFor the boy who has studied chemistry the simple equation by which\r\nthe scientist described the process to his young friend will mean as\r\nmuch as his long explanation. The equation is:\r\n\r\nFe_{2}O_{3} + 2Al = Al_{2}O_{3} + 2Fe.\r\n\r\nThe scientist simply went on to say that Fe_{2}, iron, and O_{3},\r\noxygen, in the equation means iron oxide, while 2Al means aluminum.\r\nThus we have iron oxide plus aluminum, heated to 5,400 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, equals aluminum oxide, Al_{2}O_{3}, plus pure iron,\r\n2Fe. These signs are simply the abbreviations scientists use for\r\nexpressing processes in the terms of mathematical equations.\r\n\r\nWith this general outline of the principle of the thermit process\r\nin mind its actual application will seem a simple matter. Suppose\r\nthat a great steel ship ploughing her way through a storm breaks her\r\nsternframe. This is the steel framework upon which the rudder post is\r\nmounted, and naturally a fracture puts the rudder out of commission.\r\nRepairs must be made before the ship can make another trip. Quick\r\nrepairs are desired by the owners. Perhaps the ship is a passenger\r\nsteamer due to leave port in a few days with passengers and mail, so\r\nto put the liner in drydock, wait for the steel mills to cast a new\r\nsternframe, wait for it to come by freight, and then wait for the\r\nsteelworkers to fit the piece in the place of the broken one is a\r\nmatter of weeks, perhaps more.\r\n\r\nWith the thermit process at hand this is not necessary. The company\r\nthat manufactures and sells thermit has big plants in several cities\r\nin various parts of the world, but if there is steel repairing to be\r\ndone elsewhere the company will send its materials and expert workmen\r\non a minute's notice. So if the crippled ship limps into the port\r\nwhere there is a thermit plant the repairs can begin at once, but\r\nthere need be only a little delay otherwise, because the captain of\r\nthe ship can notify his owners of the damage by wireless while still\r\nout at sea, and long before he reaches the port he is making for they\r\ncan have a complete thermit outfit on the way.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest advantages of the thermit process of repairing\r\nmachinery or structural steel is that the welding in a great many\r\ncases can be made without taking the complicated parts to pieces.\r\nConsequently after the ship is in drydock the workmen build a wooden\r\nscaffolding about the broken sternframe, so that they can work the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe next step is the preparation of the broken parts for welding.\r\nMost boys know how the doctor has to put splints on a broken arm so\r\nthat it will knit properly. It is something like that with a thermit\r\nweld.\r\n\r\nThe broken parts are supported in exact alignment by heavy blocks of\r\nconcrete, and the fractured ends sliced off clean by the oxygen-gas\r\ntorch. This leaves a space of from one inch to two and a half inches\r\nbetween the fractured ends, just according to the size of the piece\r\nto be welded. After the parts are all thoroughly cleaned the workmen\r\nare ready to take the next step.\r\n\r\nThis is the preparation of the mould for the weld. First, a pattern\r\nof the weld, as it will appear when completed, is put on the fracture\r\nwith beeswax. The space between the broken ends is filled in and a\r\nthick \"collar\" of wax is packed around the parts, so that when this\r\nis done the pattern looks like a swelling on the frame. The mould is\r\nthen built around this wax pattern.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the thermit process had to make a number of\r\nexperiments before he found a material refractory enough to stand\r\nthe terrific heat to which the mould had to be exposed. Finally he\r\ndecided upon an equal mixture of fire brick, fire clay, and fire sand.\r\n\r\nWith this material, then, the workmen go about making the mould. It\r\nis solid, with the exception of three apertures or tunnels, which are\r\nleft by inserting in the moulding clay, wooden models of the size\r\nand shape desired. These are a gate, or place into which the molten\r\nwelding material is to be poured, a \"riser\" or larger hole into\r\nwhich the surplus material can run for the overflow, and a heating\r\naperture. The gate runs from the top of the mould down to the lowest\r\npoint of the wax pattern, while the \"riser\" extends from the top of\r\nthe wax pattern to the top of the mould. Thus we really have a small\r\ninlet and large outlet, although it is always arranged so that the\r\nsurplus metal remains in the riser, and as little as possible runs\r\nover. The heating aperture is a small hole in the side of the mould\r\nextending to the bottom of the wax pattern.\r\n\r\nWith the mould complete the wooden models of the gate, riser, and\r\nheating aperture are pulled out and the first step in the process\r\nof welding is taken. The long pipe of a specially constructed\r\ngasoline compressed-air torch is inserted in the heating aperture\r\nand the process called preheating started. The gasoline torch, of\r\ncourse, quickly melts the beeswax, and leaves the space occupied by\r\nthe pattern clear for the molten metal that is to be introduced to\r\nmake the weld. The blast from the torch is continued through this\r\nheating aperture until the parts to be welded have reached a red\r\nheat, because if this were not done the cold steel would so chill the\r\nmolten thermit steel that the weld could not be accomplished. The\r\nlength of time taken by this preheating is governed, of course, by\r\nthe size of the parts to be welded. Sometimes it is many hours.\r\n\r\nEverything is now ready for the thermit. There has been some\r\nelaborate preparation of the thermit too. The coarse powder or grains\r\nof iron oxide and aluminum previously have been prepared according\r\nto the job to be done. In very large welds, or welds where very hard\r\nsteel is required, certain additions, to be explained later, are made\r\nto the thermit.\r\n\r\nThe amount of thermit to be used is an important factor, of course,\r\nas there must be plenty to fill the mould, and yet not so much that\r\nit will overflow the riser. To decide on the amount takes a careful\r\ncalculation because in large operations there are certain additions\r\nto the thermit which have to be considered. In general, however, the\r\nengineer must remember that he must have just twice as much molten\r\nthermit steel as he needs to fill the space left by the melting\r\nof the wax pattern. The surplus flows up into the riser, heating\r\naperture, and gate, effectually closing all of them. The calculation,\r\nthen, is that it takes four and a half ounces of steel to fill a\r\ncubic inch. It takes nine ounces of thermit to produce four and a\r\nhalf ounces of steel, so the engineer directing the weld must figure\r\non eighteen ounces of thermit to each cubic inch in the wax pattern,\r\nincluding the space between the parts to be welded.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing that the proper amount of thermit is measured out the\r\nengineer must see that the crucible in which the reaction is to take\r\nplace is ready to contain the strenuous battle that is to be fought\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned there are very few products that can withstand\r\nthe heat of the fire produced by thermit. Ordinary fire brick and\r\nmortar would melt or be burned to powder in a few seconds. Metal\r\nwould go the same way that the metal in the crucible goes. Science,\r\nhowever, has established that magnesia tar is not affected by the\r\nthermit fire, so the crucible in which the thermit is reduced is\r\nheavily lined with magnesia tar. The crucible itself is shaped like\r\na cone with the point downward. At the bottom is a magnesia stone,\r\nwhich has a conical-shaped hole for the \"thimble.\" This \"thimble\"\r\nalso is made of magnesia stone, and has a hole through it for the\r\nmolten thermit steel to run through after the reaction has taken\r\nplace. Before filling the crucible with the thermit, however, the\r\npouring hole is very carefully plugged up by a special process, with\r\na little steel pin protected by fire sand and fire clay. This pin\r\nextends below the lowest point of the crucible a couple of inches,\r\nand by knocking it upward the molten metal is allowed to flow out.\r\nThe upper end of this little plug that otherwise would be melted\r\ninstantaneously by contact with the burning thermit, as indicated\r\nabove, has to be protected by a layer of fire sand. The hole through\r\nwhich the metal flows is never more than half an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nWith the crucible, mould, and thermit prepared, the next thing is\r\nto put the thermit in the crucible and put the crucible in place.\r\nThere are many ways of placing the crucible. In some cases, it is\r\nhung by a chain and in others it is supported by a tripod or wooden\r\nscaffolding. The latter is the better because, though the wood always\r\ncatches fire from the heat, it can be kept standing by throwing on\r\nwater, whereas steel or iron would be eaten in two in an instant\r\nby the touch of a few sparks of flying thermit. The point is to\r\nsupport the crucible so that the pouring hole is directly over the\r\nentering gate, or pouring gate of the mould.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THERMIT WELD ON STERNFRAME OF A STEAMSHIP\r\n\r\n  Notice metal left above weld, where it flowed up into the riser.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A LARGE SHAFT WELDED BY THE THERMIT PROCESS\r\n\r\n  Protruding metal is that which flowed up into gate and riser. It\r\n  is cut away by the gas torch to leave a neat weld.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the _American Machinist_\r\n\r\n  CUTTING UP THE OLD BATTLESHIP MAINE WITH AN OXY-ACETYLENE GAS\r\n  TORCH\r\n\r\n  Picture shows end of boat crane over exploded magazine, which was\r\n  cut off in fifteen minutes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the _American Machinist_\r\n\r\n  CUTTING AWAY THE DECKS\r\n\r\n  Oxygen and acetylene generators can be seen on top of\r\n  after-turret.]\r\n\r\nThings move with a rush now, for all these arrangements are made\r\nahead of time, and as soon as the workmen are sure that the parts in\r\nthe mould are redhot the heating aperture is carefully plugged with\r\nfire sand and the thermit is ignited. From a mere pinch to half a\r\nteaspoonful of the ignition powder is put into a little hollow in the\r\nthermit so that the heat may be communicated at once to as much of\r\nthe thermit as possible. This is then set off with a storm match. The\r\nworkman quickly withdraws his hand, slams the lid on to the crucible\r\nand gets out of the way of flying sparks.\r\n\r\nThere is a hiss, a puff of white smoke, a blinding glare from the\r\nhole in the top of the crucible, and that is all, beside a few\r\nsparks, to indicate that a heat second only to that of the sun is\r\nbeing generated within.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help but marvel at the wonders of science as this\r\ninconceivable heat is being produced, the process is seemingly so\r\nsimple, so easily handled, and so accessible for all kinds of work\r\nwhere steel welding is necessary.\r\n\r\nHalf a minute to a minute (according to the amount of thermit used)\r\nafter the match has been applied a workman holding at arm's length a\r\nlong tool called a \"tapping spade\" gives a few upward knocks to the\r\nlittle metal pin extending down from the closed pouring aperture.\r\nHe jumps back for the heat is enough to set his clothes afire, even\r\nat a considerable distance, and a few flying particles of the molten\r\nthermit would inflict a serious burn.\r\n\r\nDown through the little hole the thermit, that a minute before had\r\nbeen only a coarse dark gray powder like metal filings, seemingly the\r\nlast thing on earth that would catch fire, flows into the pouring\r\ngate of the mould in a steady stream of white-hot liquid steel. The\r\nwhite glow from the metal is brighter than any electric light. It is\r\nso intense that although the workmen wear heavy dark goggles, they\r\nshade their eyes and turn their heads away.\r\n\r\nNow you will be wondering, if you know anything about steel and its\r\nwonderful properties, how it is that this can be good steel when it\r\nis all mixed up with the aluminum oxide or slag. The reason it is of\r\nbest quality is that as soon as the reaction reduces the whole mass\r\nto a molten liquid the heavier steel, set free, as the scientists\r\nsay, but as we have chosen to think of it, robbed of the aluminum,\r\nsinks to the bottom, while the lighter aluminum oxide rises to the\r\ntop. Consequently the steel goes into the mould to make the weld\r\nwhile the slag, having risen to the top, will be found at the top of\r\nthe pouring gate, and only around the outer edges of the weld.\r\n\r\nWhen the pour is completed the workmen go away and leave it to cool.\r\nIt is usually left over night, sometimes as long as forty hours,\r\nwhen the weld is a very large one.\r\n\r\nFinally the mould is broken down and the weld is found complete, with\r\nbig extensions of the steel extending from the weld, in just the\r\nshape of the pouring gate \"riser\" and heating aperture.\r\n\r\nThe molten thermit steel rushing in at the bottom of the mould has\r\nrisen between the heated broken ends, and all around them, in just\r\nthe shape left by the wax pattern. As the scientists say, the thermit\r\nsteel has united the broken sternframe and formed a homogeneous mass\r\nwith it. In other words the terrific heat of the thermit rushing on\r\nthe heated ends has resulted in the two parts becoming one with the\r\nadded thermit steel.\r\n\r\nAfter the mould is broken down the oxygen-gas torch comes into use\r\nagain to cut away the ends of steel sticking up where they had cooled\r\nin the pouring gate, \"riser\" and heating aperture. After this the\r\nweld looks like a great swelling upon the sternframe, and if the\r\nswelling is where it will not interfere with the working of the\r\nrudder or steamer propellers, nothing more need be done. On the other\r\nhand, if the swelling is in the way, it can be reduced to the size of\r\nthe frame, and squared off with machines built for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThus the ship is repaired and is ready to be taken out of drydock for\r\nher next trip, as good as new.\r\n\r\nAbout the same plan is followed out on all kinds of welding except\r\npipes and rails. Locomotives can be repaired without taking the\r\ncomplicated machinery apart just by working around until the crucible\r\ncan be so hung, and the pouring gate so arranged that the metal\r\ncan be poured into the place designed for it. The chief difference\r\nlies in the size of the weld to be made and the consequent amount\r\nof thermit to be used. Welds have been made where as much as 2,000\r\npounds of thermit--enough to make 1,000 pounds of steel--have been\r\nrun into a mould. In these very big welds a certain percentage of\r\nsteel \"punchings,\" or small pieces of steel, and a little pure\r\nmanganese are used to give the additional hardness to the weld.\r\n\r\nWithout going into details as to the manner in which the principle\r\nof the thermit process is applied on rails or pipes, it will be\r\nenough to say that in welding rails three different systems are used.\r\nThe first is done by building the mould around the ends of the two\r\nrails to be welded together and letting the thermit steel run in\r\nand completely surround the rails and the space between them. This\r\ngives one continuous rail just as far as the welding is carried on,\r\nand one through which the electric current of an electric road can\r\npass without any trouble at all. It is plain, then, why this system\r\nis used so much on third rails of electric roads. The trouble with\r\nit is that the swelling on the top and inside of the rails must be\r\nmachined down to present a smooth running surface to the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe next system, which is now almost out of date, is one in which two\r\nmoulds are used so that the thermit does not come up over the running\r\nsurface of the rails. This relieves the engineers of the necessity of\r\nmachining the welded joints.\r\n\r\nThe third system is a mixture of the joining by plates and the\r\nthermit process. This is called the \"Clark joint,\" after the name of\r\nChief Engineer Charles H. Clark of the Cleveland, (Ohio) Electric\r\nCompany, who formulated the plan. The rails are joined with plates\r\nand bolted, or riveted together in the old way, but a thermit weld\r\nis made at the base of the rail, welding the bases of the two rails\r\ntogether and to the plate.\r\n\r\nThe method of welding steel pipes is an exact reversal of the\r\nprinciple of welding together solid pieces of steel or iron. After\r\nthe pipes are cut off clean, the mould, which is made of cast iron,\r\nis placed around them with specially constructed clamps to force\r\nthe two ends closer together after the thermit has been poured in.\r\nThe thermit is then set off in a flat-bottomed crucible like a\r\nlong-handled ladle, and poured into the mould by hand as if from a\r\nladle. As the slag rises to the top it goes into the mould first and\r\ncoats the pipes. The thermit steel does not touch the pipes, but\r\nmerely supplies the heat to weld them perfectly, so that they are as\r\nstrong as the piping itself. Just after the pour has been made, the\r\nclamps are tightened up and the white-hot pipe ends forced together.\r\nThey are thus held until cold, when the mould is broken away. The\r\nslag coats the outside of the pipes and this is chipped away, leaving\r\na perfect weld.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting use of thermit is in the great foundries where\r\ncauldrons of metal have to be kept at a very high temperature. To\r\nhelp keep the mass in a liquid state thermit can be introduced in\r\nit either by throwing it into the cauldrons in bags, with a little\r\nignition powder so fixed that it will be touched off by the heat\r\nof the boiling metal, or by putting it in especially designed cans\r\naffixed to the ends of long rods. By these rods the thermit can be\r\nplunged to the bottom of the cauldron before it \"burns.\" The reaction\r\nof the thermit, with the intense heat caused by it, helps to keep the\r\nmass at the proper temperature.\r\n\r\nAlso thermit is used in the same way with a small amount of titanium\r\noxide, to purify iron and steel. The metal becomes much more liquid,\r\nand a commotion like boiling is started. This is the result of the\r\ntitanium driving out the impure gases and driving other impurities\r\nsuch as metallic oxides and sulphur contents to the top. Chemically\r\nwhat happens when the titanium is introduced by the thermit process\r\nis that the titanium combines with the nitrogen in the molten iron,\r\ngiving it a much finer grain, and making it a much lighter colour,\r\nmore like steel, than previously.\r\n\r\nOne of the things thermit is not extensively used for is the\r\nrepairing of gray iron castings. The first reason is that gray iron\r\nis cheaper than steel, and a new casting often can be turned out by\r\nthe mills quickly.\r\n\r\nAnother and a more interesting reason is that gray iron melts in a\r\nmuch lower temperature than does thermit steel and consequently has a\r\nlower shrinkage. Therefore when the molten thermit, with its terrific\r\nheat, cools there is a large shrinkage. Thermit steel being much\r\nstronger than gray iron, its shrinking sometimes strains and cracks\r\nthe iron casting.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this difficulty very successful repairs have been made\r\non cast-iron and it has been found that by mixing 2 per cent. of\r\nferro-silicon and 1 per cent. pure manganese with the thermit for\r\nwelding, a thermit steel is formed which is very soft and comes close\r\nto the properties of gray iron. By using this mixture important\r\nwelds have been made on cast-iron flywheels, water wheels, and other\r\ncast-iron parts with great success.\r\n\r\nWhile industry is making progress with all these uses of thermit,\r\nscience is experimenting all the time to add to the scope of the\r\nprocess. As was pointed out before, many other metals can be reduced\r\nto a high degree of purity with this process and in the laboratories\r\nthey are always trying new ones and working out new formulas. Of\r\nthe pure metals that can be reduced by the thermit process there\r\nare chromium, which is 98 to 99 per cent. pure; manganese, which\r\nis 96 per cent. pure; and molybdenum, which is 98 to 99 per cent.\r\npure. These are used in the manufacture of very hard steel, such as\r\narmour plate, and \"high speed steel.\" Among the alloys, or mixtures\r\nof metals, there are chromium-manganese, manganese titanium,\r\nferro-titanium, ferro-vanadium, and ferro-boron, all of which have\r\nuses in industry and help us to travel faster and more safely by\r\nrailroad, electric train, and steamship.\r\n\r\nIt may have occurred to some bright boy that, since this heat is\r\nso intense and so handy, it might be a good way to make steam in\r\nlocomotive boilers, or cook our meals, but it will be remembered\r\nthat the heat is all over within a few minutes. In other words,\r\nwhere a terrific heat is required for a few seconds, thermit will\r\nfill the bill, but where a continuous heat for many hours is needed,\r\nelectricity, gas, coal, coke, oil, or wood are better. The high cost\r\nof aluminum would probably prevent the thermit process coming into\r\nuse in the manufacture of steel for our armour plate, ship plate, or\r\nstructural steel, at least for a good many years.\r\n\r\nEarlier in this chapter I said that the slag, or aluminum oxide, from\r\nthe thermit process was an almost useless product. This is not the\r\nprecise scientific truth, for the slag becomes a black powder such as\r\nis used in making emery wheels, but the slag from thermit is never\r\nactually used for this. Another use for the slag from the thermit\r\nprocess in which chromium is used has been discovered. Potters use a\r\nmaterial called corundum, which this slag resembles, except that it\r\nis superior to natural corundum in pottery manufacturing because of\r\nits freedom from metallic impurities. The slag can be mixed with clay\r\nand baked. It is especially useful in chemical apparatus that must\r\nwithstand great extremes of temperature, because its experience has\r\nso tempered it that nothing less than a heat equal to that of the sun\r\nwould give it much concern.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing about the slag from chromium thermit is\r\nthat small rubies have been found in it. The scientific explanation\r\nis that they are nothing but crystallized alumina, coloured with\r\nchromium. The jewels usually are too small for any commercial purpose\r\nbut serve as a very striking example of the intensity of the thermit\r\nfire. All the real jewels, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, amethysts, and\r\nso on, were formed by the terrific heat in the bosom of the earth\r\nmillions of years ago when it was cooling down from gases hotter\r\nthan anything we can possibly conceive of, to a molten ball, then\r\nto a solid redhot mass and then to a globe sufficiently cool on the\r\noutside to be crusted over. That they can be made in this little\r\nchemical furnace shows how far science has gone in imitation of the\r\nwonders of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOGENOUS WELDING AND CUTTING\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the scientist, after he and his young friend had finished\r\nsome experiments, and were ready to talk about autogenous welding,\r\n\"imagine a little white flame no bigger than a pencil point at the\r\nend of a brass pipe about the size, and not entirely unlike in\r\nappearance the old-fashioned taper holder with which you used to\r\nlight the gas, and you have before you in the rough, a picture of\r\none of the oxy-acetylene torches that will in a few minutes weld two\r\npieces of almost any metal, or in a few seconds cut a solid plate of\r\nthe hardest steel of several inches thickness almost as fast and easy\r\nas a carpenter could saw a board, and yet without taking the temper\r\nout of the metal.\"\r\n\r\nPicking up what seemed to be a little brass rod bent at the end, the\r\nman turned a valve, applied a match, and as the gas burned up with a\r\nbeautiful little flame of dazzling whiteness, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"This tiny flame, so easily controlled, is hotter than any produced\r\nby man except that generated by the electrical furnace, for it\r\nreaches a temperature of about 6,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Previous to\r\nthe invention of these wonderful torches the oxy-hydrogen was the\r\nhottest gas flame, but it only reached a temperature of 4,000 degrees\r\nFahrenheit.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you use it?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for instance, Uncle Sam is enabled to weld and cut steel\r\nplate in building his battleships, steelworkers to carry on their\r\ngigantic tasks, and wreckers to clear away tangled masses of steel\r\nbeams far more quickly and easily than with the older methods.\r\n\r\n\"If you had visited one of the navy yards, a shipyard or any place\r\nwhere big work in iron and steel was being carried on as short a\r\ntime as three years ago, you would have seen a man sitting for hours\r\nsawing away on the end of a steel beam, for instance, trying to cut\r\nit down to the required length. He would dull many saws, use a great\r\ndeal of energy, and an appalling amount of the most valuable thing in\r\nthe world--time. Again, you would have seen them welding pieces of\r\niron and steel by the old blacksmith method, or riveting other pieces\r\nthat could not be joined by heating them and pressing them together.\r\n\r\n\"To-day you would see fewer of these processes because autogenous\r\nwelding and cutting by the powerful little oxy-acetylene torches\r\nis revolutionizing certain methods of working with metals. Instead\r\nof squatting at the end of the beam and sawing away like an\r\nold-fashioned carpenter, the modern iron worker takes up his little\r\ntorch, turns a valve in the handle and concentrates the flame on the\r\nsteel beam that he wishes cut. Almost instantly a shower of sparks on\r\nthe under side of the beam shows him that the flame has burned its\r\nway through. Then he slowly moves the flame along the line where he\r\ndesires to cut and the trick is done.\"\r\n\r\nIllustrating with his own little laboratory torch, the scientist\r\ncontinued his explanation, saying that cutting is only one of the\r\nmany uses to which this modern invention in steel working is put.\r\nNot quite so spectacular but every bit as useful is the autogenous\r\nwelding by means of these magic wands. Welding metals has ever been\r\nmore or less unsatisfactory. The old process of heating the two\r\nends and then beating them together is cumbersome and practically\r\nimpossible in many cases. Consequently inventors have sought other\r\nwelding processes with wider application and greater facility ever\r\nsince the first metal workers of earliest times forged crude chains\r\nand weapons. With this modern device two pieces of steel or other\r\nmetal are brought to within a small fraction of an inch of each other\r\nand by the use of the oxy-acetylene torch and a thin strip or rod of\r\nmetal are melted and fused together.\r\n\r\nAlthough the acetylene flame gives off a far greater proportion of\r\nlight than heat, it is a very powerful gas and Le Chetalier, a French\r\ninventor, was sure that he could put it to other uses than furnishing\r\nlights for automobiles, etc. To this end he tried mixing acetylene\r\ngas with oxygen, for there can be no fire or combustion without\r\noxygen. He very properly figured that by introducing pure oxygen\r\ninto the acetylene, the burning, or combustion, would be greater,\r\nand the heat of the flame greatly intensified. His experiments were\r\nultimately successful, and it was then only a short step to the\r\ntime when three different oxy-acetylene torches were in use. In\r\nFrance there were developed low pressure, medium pressure, and high\r\npressure torches; but the last named has not been found commercially\r\npracticable in the United States, where the \"medium pressure\" torch\r\nis sometimes called the high pressure. As we are dealing entirely\r\nwith the American use of the invention we also will call the two\r\nkinds of torches used here the low pressure and the high pressure.\r\n\r\nThe general principle of the torch is, as we see, the mixture of\r\noxygen with acetylene in order to obtain a hotter flame, but right\r\nhere we come to the difference between the low-pressure and the\r\nhigh-pressure tools. Both are made of brass pipes, terminating in the\r\nburning tip and connected at the rear of the handle with rubber tubes\r\nwhich run to the separate tanks holding the acetylene gas and the\r\noxygen, but the method by which these gases are combined in the torch\r\nconstitutes the principle differences in the two systems, with the\r\nconsequent greater or less efficiency claimed by the manufacturers.\r\nWithout going into the technical details, which are a matter of\r\ncontroversy between scientists as well as the various commercial\r\nconcerns interested in the torches, it will be sufficient to say\r\nthat in the low-pressure torch the acetylene gas is only used under\r\na pressure of a few ounces, with the oxygen under a much heavier\r\npressure, while in the high-pressure torches, the acetylene and\r\noxygen both are under an appreciable pressure of several pounds.\r\n\r\nThus in the low-pressure torch invented by Fouché, the oxygen is\r\nforced out of the nozzle by the pressure and the outrush sucks\r\nout the acetylene in the proper quantities. The two gases mix in\r\na chamber at the end of the torch just above the tip and flow out\r\ninto the air in this mixed form. The proportions of the gases in the\r\nlow-pressure tool are about 1.7 of oxygen to 1.0 of acetylene.\r\n\r\nThe high-pressure torch, which has largely taken the place of the\r\nlow-pressure one in France, and which we also see most frequently in\r\nthis country, has a different method of mixing the gases, due to the\r\nfact that they both are under pressure. According to many authorities\r\nthe tip where the gases are mixed is by far the most important\r\nfactor in the success or failure of the tool. In the high-pressure\r\ntorch the oxygen enters the tip from a hole in the centre, while\r\nthe acetylene enters it from two holes, one on each side. They meet\r\nunder high pressure at the upper end of the tip, and have the length\r\nof the hollow tip in which to mix, before they strike the air. The\r\nlong, narrow hole in the tip is called the mixing chamber. Those who\r\nare interested in the high-pressure torch declare that it is the\r\nfact that the gases are positively mixed in proper proportion in\r\nthe detachable tip, that so greatly adds to the efficiency of the\r\ntool. They declare that by allowing the acetylene to enter the tip\r\nlaterally, at right angles with the oxygen, the blast of the oxygen\r\nis broken as it mixes with the acetylene, and the tendency of an\r\noxygen flame to oxidize any metal with which it comes in contact by\r\nreason of an excess of oxygen in the flame is largely done away with.\r\nThis, with the small diameter of the mixing chamber and the friction\r\nwith the walls, gives a perfect mixture, according to the claims of\r\nthe high-pressure torch enthusiasts. Moreover, the small hole which\r\nis the mixing chamber, effectually prevents serious accidents by\r\nflash-backs of the highly explosive acetylene, and also provides a\r\nmuch easier method of control. Each outfit has several different\r\nsizes of tips for various kinds of work.\r\n\r\nThe pressure under which the two gases are used is the other big\r\ndifference between the high-pressure and the low-pressure torches, as\r\nsaid before. In the the high-pressure tool the oxygen is compressed\r\nabout the same as in the low-pressure torch, while the acetylene is\r\nunder several pounds pressure, just in accordance with the size of\r\nthe tip used. In the low-pressure torch the pressure on the acetylene\r\nis only about ten ounces to the square inch, or only enough to keep\r\nit flowing. On account of this difference in the pressure making the\r\nbig difference in the mixture of the gases, scientists have chosen\r\nto call the low-pressure torches injector mixture types, from the\r\nfact that the acetylene is sucked into the tip by an injector system,\r\nwhile the high-pressure torches are called positive mixture types,\r\nbecause the gases are mixed directly by pressure. In the latest\r\nhigh-pressure tool the mixture of gases is 1.14 parts of oxygen to 1\r\npart of acetylene, while the low-pressure torch takes a proportion of\r\n1.7 parts of oxygen to 1 part of acetylene.\r\n\r\nThe torches also vary in size from the little 8-ounce \"jeweller's\"\r\ntorch, that the scientist used, to nineteen to twenty inches long and\r\na weight of two and a quarter pounds. The average size, however, is\r\ntwelve inches long with a weight of one pound. The welding torch is\r\nmade up of two brass tubes, one for the acetylene and the other for\r\nthe oxygen, connected at the two ends. At the nozzle end there is\r\na sharp turn in the piping so that the tip is very nearly at right\r\nangles to the main pipes. At the handle end, are the connections for\r\nthe rubber tubes that lead to the gas tanks, and the little valves by\r\nwhich the operator can control the flow of gas. The pipes carrying\r\nthe gases to the tip are the same size the whole length, but at one\r\nend are enclosed in a larger tube, which serves as a handle.\r\n\r\nNow that we have seen the general construction of the oxy-acetylene\r\ntorches, we will assume that the tanks, which look like large\r\nsoda-water reservoirs, are filled with pure oxygen and acetylene\r\ngas, and transported to some convenient point in a railroad repair\r\nshop where great forges are spurting flames, and one can hardly hear\r\nthe talk of a man beside him for the roar of the hammers and the\r\ncompressed air riveters. Assume that some large expensive steel part\r\nof a locomotive has been broken and must be repaired quickly so that\r\nthe engine can go out on the road to help haul an accumulation of\r\nfreight.\r\n\r\nIn the old days an engine would have to be taken apart, a new\r\npart turned out at the steel mill, shipped to the shops, and the\r\nlocomotive put together again. Nowadays it is only necessary to take\r\nenough of the machinery apart for the workmen to get at the broken\r\nparts. After cutting off the edges to be welded so that they make a\r\nsmall V, and supporting them within the fraction of an inch apart\r\nin the exact position and shape that they are to be repaired, the\r\nworkman selects a rod of steel or iron, to use in somewhat the same\r\nway the tinker uses a strip of solder when he wants to repair a break\r\nin a kettle with solder and soldering iron.\r\n\r\nThe selection of this filling rod, or wire, is all-important, for\r\nthe skilful and successful iron worker uses a piece of metal that\r\nwill fuse well with the parts to be repaired, at about the same\r\ntemperature at which they themselves will fuse. Mild steel or Norway\r\niron which is 90 per cent. pure is frequently used, but there are no\r\nhard and fast rules because every master mechanic has his own ideas\r\nabout such things, and would not take the word of any manufacturing\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThen the operator turns on his torch, lights it with a match, takes\r\nit in one hand, and the rod of welding steel in the other. Holding\r\nthe end of the steel rod at the thin crack or bevelled edges between\r\nthe pieces to be welded the operator directs the small flame on the\r\npoint, holding the tip of the torch about a quarter to a half inch\r\nfrom the metal. It only takes a few seconds for the terrific heat of\r\nthe flame to melt the strip of steel and the edges of the parts to be\r\nwelded so that they all are fused together in one perfect mass.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the brass tip of the torch does not melt in\r\nthis heat because the pressure behind the gases forces them out with\r\nsuch velocity that the flame is far enough removed from the tip to\r\ndo it no injury, just so long as the operator does not put the tip\r\nsquare against the metal and drive the flame back against it. This\r\nnot only would melt the tip but probably would cause a flash-back in\r\nthe torch.\r\n\r\nAs the end of the strip melts into the crack the operator moves\r\nup the steel, and moves his torch along the crack until the whole\r\noperation is complete. At the end the weld is very rough but when it\r\nis machined down it may be so perfect that it is difficult to tell\r\nwhere it was made, and the strength is equal to that of any other\r\npart of the piece.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the weld becomes homogenous with the parts repaired.\r\nFrom this fact autogenous welding takes its name. Autogenous is\r\ndefined as \"self produced,\" or independent of outside materials.\r\n\r\nThus, we see that the autogenous process is a system of putting on\r\nnew material, without either heating, compression, or adding flux\r\n(molten material) to the broken parts. In the foregoing paragraphs we\r\nhave taken up the welding of steel parts, but the process can be as\r\nwell applied to steel pipe, steel plate, iron, cast-iron, aluminum,\r\ncopper, and other materials with only slight variations in the manner\r\nof using the torch.\r\n\r\nThe cutting process is even more spectacular because while the\r\nwelding proceeds quietly, the cutting is accompanied by just enough\r\nfireworks to show us the progress of the tiny flame through the\r\nhardest and thickest of metals.\r\n\r\nThe cutting torch is the same as the welding torch with the exception\r\nof an additional pipe from which flows a jet of pure oxygen to give\r\nthe flame the necessary cutting property. The greater the supply\r\nof oxygen the greater the combustion, and the more penetrating the\r\nflame. The acetylene gas flame heats up the steel--\"fills the office\r\nof a preheater,\" said the scientist--while the oxygen jet follows\r\nclose behind and makes a thin cut through the hot metal.\r\n\r\nThe extra pipe is the same size as the others and extends down to the\r\nend of the torch at an angle where its tip is clamped alongside the\r\nmain tip. The rear end of the third tube is connected with a rubber\r\nhose like the others, which extends to the oxygen tank. The flow of\r\noxygen is under higher, and individual working pressure, controlled\r\nby a valve. In a new style torch the extra hose is done away with and\r\nthe separation of the oxygen is done in the torch.\r\n\r\nWhen the modern steel carpenter wants to cut a hole, or saw off a\r\nstrip from a piece of steel, no matter whether it be a steel beam,\r\nsteel plate, or almost any other form of iron (except cast-iron), he\r\nattaches the cutting pipe, lights his torch and sets to work. Holding\r\nthe tool about half an inch from the surface he directs the little\r\nblue flame, which is no more than three quarters of an inch long,\r\nand a quarter of an inch thick, against the spot where he desires\r\nto start cutting. He holds it there a few seconds, then there is a\r\nshower of sparks on the under side of the steel plate, indicating\r\nthat the flame has eaten its way all the way through. The operator\r\nnext moves the torch along the line where he wants to cut. The speed\r\nwith which he can move is governed by the thickness of the steel to\r\nbe cut. Half-inch ship steel, for instance, could be cut at a rate of\r\nmore than a foot a minute. The heat of the flame melts a little of\r\nthe steel, which drops down in molten particles, but the edge that\r\nis cut is sharp and clean, and its temper is as perfect as if the\r\ncutting were done with one of the laborious old-fashioned steel saws.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN OXY-ACETYLENE GAS TORCH WELD\r\n\r\n  Note the little torch in the man's left hand, the filling metal\r\n  in his right, and the inserted picture of the apparatus.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TINY 200-HORSEPOWER TURBINE\r\n\r\n  This engine could almost be covered by a derby hat. A part of the\r\n  casing is removed to show the smooth disks.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE TESLA TURBINE PUMP\r\n\r\n  Driven by a 1/12-horsepower motor. The little pump here shown is\r\n  delivering 40 gallons of water per minute against a 9-foot head.]\r\n\r\nThis cutting process is of especial value to navy yards, shipyards,\r\nand wreckers, where there is a great deal of steel to be cut.\r\nUncle Sam uses it at most of his navy yards, for in building his\r\nbattleships there are thousands and thousands of holes to be cut\r\nin steel plates, plates to be shaped, and beams to be cut off to\r\nrequired lengths.\r\n\r\nWhen the scientist and his young friend visited the Brooklyn Navy\r\nYard to see this process in operation the naval constructors had made\r\nconsiderable headway on the framework of the great Dreadnaught _New\r\nYork_, in course of building there. The huge steel ribs of the ship\r\ntowered upward amid the scaffolding nearly as high as a five-story\r\nbuilding. In laying this steel framework, and shaping the plates that\r\nwill make the hull, bulkheads, and decks, there will be millions\r\nof holes to be cut, and virtually miles and miles of plates to be\r\nshaped. Instead of sawing these the workmen were cutting them with\r\nthe oxy-acetylene torches.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen men were at work, all cutting as fast as possible, and\r\nthe great steel plates, and beams were coming and going as quickly\r\nas ever boards were passed along by a carpenter. The lines that were\r\nto be cut were all marked out in advance so the men never put out\r\ntheir torches. The only cessation in the work was when one of them\r\nstopped for a minute or so, to wipe his eyes, for in spite of the\r\ndark goggles worn by all operators of the oxy-acetylene process the\r\nintense flame is very hard on the eyes.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the cutting process is so popular in shipyards is\r\nbecause in making steel ships, holes are cut in the plates, ribs, and\r\nbeams, wherever possible without lessening the strength, to lighten\r\nthe frame.\r\n\r\nProbably the most picturesque use of the cutting device is by\r\nwreckers of steel structures. Nowadays whenever there is a bad fire\r\nthe building is left a tangled mass of steel pipes and girders that\r\ncan only be cleared away with the greatest risk of life, and the\r\ngreatest difficulty. The process always was a long, tedious one until\r\nthe oxy-acetylene cutting came into use.\r\n\r\nThousands of New York boys saw the device in use during the winter\r\nof 1911-1912 when they visited the ruins of the Equitable Life\r\nAssurance Society fire. The sight is unmistakable. Far up in the\r\nruins you see a man bending over a great twisted steel beam that it\r\nmight take weeks to pull out of the débris. Soon there is a shower\r\nof sparks, and the part that is sticking out is cut off and ready to\r\nbe sent to the street and hauled away. The device has been used in\r\nthe ruins of a large number of disastrous fires, lately, particularly\r\nwhere men have been entombed in the collapse of ceilings, and haste\r\nmeans everything in getting out their bodies. Also, it was very\r\nsuccessfully used in cutting up the old battleship _Maine_ before the\r\nhull was removed from Havana harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE TESLA TURBINE\r\n\r\n   DR. NIKOLA TESLA TELLS OF HIS NEW STEAM TURBINE ENGINE A MODEL\r\n   OF WHICH, THE SIZE OF A DERBY HAT, DEVELOPS MORE THAN 110\r\n   HORSEPOWER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How would you like to have an engine for your motor boat that you\r\ncould almost cover with a man's derby hat and yet which would give\r\n110 horsepower?\" asked the scientist of his young friend one day when\r\nthey had been talking about boats and engines.\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of any real engine as small as that,\" said the boy. \"I\r\nused to play with toy engines, but they wouldn't give anywhere near\r\none horsepower, much less 110.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think I can show you a little engine that, for mechanical\r\nsimplicity and power is about the most wonderful thing you ever have\r\nseen, if you would like to make another visit to Dr. Nikola Tesla,\r\nwho told us all about his invention for the wireless transmission of\r\npower the other day. Doctor Tesla invented this little engine and he\r\nis going to do great things with it.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the boy jumped at the opportunity, for what real boy would\r\nmiss a chance to find out all about a new and powerful engine?\r\n\r\n\"Is it a gasoline engine?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is a steam turbine, but if you know anything at all about\r\nturbines you will see that it is entirely different from any you ever\r\nhave seen, for Doctor Tesla has used a principle as old as the hills\r\nand one which has been known to men for centuries, but which never\r\nbefore has been applied in mechanics.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a little more talk the scientist promised to arrange with Tesla\r\nto take the young man over to the great Waterside power-house, New\r\nYork, where the inventor is testing out his latest invention. We will\r\nfollow them there and see what this wonderful little turbine looks\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nPicking his way amid the powerful machinery and the maze of\r\nswitchboards, the scientist finally stopped in front of a little\r\ndevice that seemed like a toy amid the gigantic machines of the\r\npower-house.\r\n\r\n\"This is the small turbine,\" says Tesla. \"It will do pretty well for\r\nits size.\"\r\n\r\nThe little engine looked like a small steel drum about ten inches in\r\ndiameter and a couple of inches wide, with a shaft running through\r\nthe centre. Various kinds of gauges were attached at different\r\npoints. Outside of the gauges and the base upon which it was mounted,\r\nthe engine almost could have been covered by a derby hat. The whole\r\nthing, gauges and all, practically could have been covered by an\r\nordinary hat box.\r\n\r\nYet when Tesla gave the word, and his assistant turned on the steam,\r\nthe small dynamo to which the turbine shaft was geared, instantly\r\nbegan to run at terrific speed. Apparently the machine began to run\r\nat full speed instantly instead of gradually working up to it. There\r\nwas no sound except the whir of well-fitted machinery. \"Under tests,\"\r\nsaid Tesla, \"this little turbine has developed 110 horsepower.\"\r\n\r\nJust think of it, a little engine that you could lift with one hand,\r\ngiving 110 horsepower!\r\n\r\n\"But we can do better than that,\" added the inventor, \"for with a\r\nsteam pressure of 125 pounds at the inlet, running 9,000 revolutions\r\nper minute, the engine will develop 200 brake-horsepower.\"\r\n\r\nNearby was another machine a little larger than the first, which\r\nseemed to be two identical Tesla turbines with the central shafts\r\nconnected by a strong spring. Gauges of different kinds, to show\r\nhow the engine stood the tests, were attached at various places.\r\nWhen Tesla gave the word to open the throttle on the twin machines\r\nthe spring connecting the shafts, without a second's pause, began\r\nto revolve, so that it looked like a solid bar of polished steel.\r\nOutside of a low, steady hum and a slight vibration in the floor,\r\nthat steadied down after the engine had been running a little while,\r\nthere was no indication that enough horsepower to run machinery a\r\nhundred times the weight and size of the turbine was being generated.\r\n\r\n\"You see, for testing purposes,\" said Doctor Tesla, \"I have these\r\ntwo turbines connected by this torsion spring. The steam is acting\r\nin opposite directions in the two machines. In one, the heat energy\r\nis converted into mechanical power. In the other, mechanical power\r\nis turned back into heat. One is working against the other, and by\r\nmeans of this gauge we can tell how much the spring is twisted and\r\nconsequently how much power we are developing. Every degree marked\r\noff on this scale indicates twenty-two horsepower.\" The beam of light\r\non the gauge stood at the division marked \"10.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred and twenty horsepower,\" said Doctor Tesla. \"We can do\r\nbetter than that.\" He opened the steam valves a trifle more, giving\r\nmore power to the motive end of the combination and more resistance\r\nto the \"brake\" end. The scale indicated 330 horsepower. \"These\r\ncasings are not constructed for much higher steam pressure, or I\r\ncould show you something more wonderful than that. These engines\r\ncould readily develop 1,000 horsepower.\r\n\r\n\"These little turbines represent what mechanical engineers have\r\nbeen dreaming of since steam power was invented--the perfect rotary\r\nengine,\" continued Doctor Tesla, as he led the way back to his\r\noffice. \"My turbine will give at least twenty-five times as much\r\npower to the pound of weight as the lightest weight engines made to\r\ndate. You know that the lightest and most powerful gasoline engines\r\nused on aeroplanes nowadays generally develop only one horsepower to\r\ntwo and one half pounds of weight. With that much weight my turbine\r\nwill develop twenty-five horsepower.\r\n\r\n\"That is not all, for the turbine is probably the cheapest engine\r\nto build ever invented. Its mechanical simplicity is such that any\r\ngood mechanic could build it, and any good mechanic could repair\r\nsuch parts as get out of order. When I can show you the inside of\r\none of the turbines, in a few moments, however, you will see that\r\nthere is nothing to get out of order such as most turbines have, and\r\nthat it is not subjected to the heavy strains and jerks that all\r\nreciprocating engines and other turbines must stand. Also you will\r\nsee that my turbine will run forward or backward, just as we desire,\r\nwill run with steam, water, gas, or air, and can be used as a pump or\r\nan air compressor, just as well as an engine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But most of your research has been in electricity,\" Tesla was\r\nreminded, for no one can forget that Tesla's inventions largely\r\nhave made possible most of the world's greatest electrical power\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"but I was a mechanical engineer before I was\r\nan electrical engineer, and besides, this principle was worked out\r\nin the course of my search for the ideal motor for airships, to be\r\nused in conjunction with my invention for the wireless transmission\r\nof electrical power. For twenty years I worked on the problem, but\r\nI have not given up. When my plan is perfected the present-day\r\naeroplanes and dirigible balloons will disappear, and the dangerous\r\nsport of aviation, as we know it now with its hundreds of accidents,\r\nand its picturesque birdmen, will give way to safe, seaworthy\r\nairships, without wings or gas bags, but supported and driven by\r\nmechanical means.\r\n\r\n\"As I told you before when we were talking of the wireless\r\ntransmission of power, the mechanism will be a development of\r\nthe principle on which my turbine is constructed. It will be so\r\ntremendously powerful that it will make a veritable rope of air above\r\nthe great machine to hold it at any altitude the navigators may\r\nchoose, and also a rope of air in front or in the rear to send it\r\nforward or backward at almost any speed desired. When that day comes,\r\nairship travel will be as safe and prosaic as travel by railroad\r\ntrain to-day, and not very much different, except that there will\r\nbe no dirt, and it will be much faster. One will be able to dine in\r\nNew York, retire in an aero Pullman berth in a closed and perfectly\r\nfurnished car, and arise to breakfast in London.\"\r\n\r\nTesla's plans for the airship are far in the future, but his turbine\r\nis a thing of the present, and it has been declared by some of the\r\nmost eminent authorities in the world in mechanical engineering\r\nto be the greatest invention of a century. The reason for this is\r\nnot altogether on account of the wonderful feats of Tesla's model\r\nturbines, but because in them he has shown the world an entirely\r\nunused mechanical principle which can be applied in a thousand useful\r\nways.\r\n\r\nJames Watt discovered and put to work the expansive power of steam,\r\nby which the piston of an engine is pushed back and forth in the\r\ncylinder of an engine, but it has remained for Nikola Tesla to prove\r\nthat it is not necessary for the steam to have something to push\r\nupon--that the most powerful engine yet shown to the world works\r\nthrough a far simpler mechanism than any yet used for turning a gas\r\nor a fluid into the driving force of machinery.\r\n\r\n\"How did you come to invent your turbine while you were busy with\r\nyour wonderful electrical inventions?\" Tesla was asked.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he answered, \"while I was trying to solve the problem\r\nof aerial navigation by electrical means, the gasoline motor was\r\nperfected; and aviation as we know it to-day became a fact. I\r\nconsider the aeroplane as it has been developed little more than a\r\npassing phase of air navigation. Aeroplaning makes delightful sport,\r\nno doubt, but as it is now it can never be practical in commerce.\r\nConsequently I abandoned for the time being my attempts to find the\r\nideal airship motor in electricity, and for several years studied\r\nhard on the problem as one of mechanics. Finally I hit upon the\r\ncentral idea of the new turbine I have just been showing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this principle?\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea of my turbine is based simply on two properties known to\r\nscience for hundreds of years, but never in all the world's history\r\nused in this way before. These properties are adhesion and viscosity.\r\nAny boy can test them. For instance, put a little water on a sheet of\r\nmetal. Most of it will roll off, but a few drops will remain until\r\nthey evaporate. The metal does not absorb the water so the only thing\r\nthat makes the water remain on the metal is adhesion--in other words,\r\nit adheres, or sticks to the metal.\r\n\r\n\"Then, too, you will notice that the drop of water will assume a\r\ncertain shape and that it will remain in that form until you make it\r\nchange by some outside force--by disturbing it by touch or holding it\r\nso that the attraction of gravitation will make it change.\r\n\r\n\"The simple little experiment reveals the viscosity of water, or, in\r\nother words, reveals the property of the molecules which go to make\r\nup the water, of sticking to each other. It is these properties of\r\nadhesion and viscosity that cause the 'skin friction' that impedes\r\na ship in its progress through the water, or an aeroplane in going\r\nthrough the air. All fluids have these qualities--and you must keep\r\nin mind that air is a fluid, all gases are fluid, steam is fluid.\r\nEvery known means of transmitting or developing mechanical power is\r\nthrough a fluid medium.\r\n\r\n\"It is a surprising fact that gases and vapours are possessed of this\r\nproperty of viscosity to a greater degree than are liquids such as\r\nwater. Owing to these properties, if a solid body is moved through a\r\nfluid, more or less of the fluid is dragged along, or if a solid is\r\nput in a fluid that is moving it is carried along with the current.\r\nAlso you are familiar with the great rush of air that follows a\r\nswiftly moving train. That simply means that the train tends to carry\r\nthe air along with it, as the air tries to adhere to the surface of\r\nthe cars, and the particles of air try to stick together. You would\r\nbe surprised if you could have a picture of the great train of moving\r\nair that follows you about merely as you walk through this room.\r\n\r\n\"Now, in all the history of mechanical engineering, these properties\r\nhave not been turned to the full use of man, although, as I said\r\nbefore, they have been known to exist for centuries. When I hit upon\r\nthe idea that a rotary engine would run through their application, I\r\nbegan a series of very successful experiments.\"\r\n\r\nTesla went on to explain that all turbines, and in fact all engines,\r\nare based on the idea that the steam must have something to\r\npush against. We shall see a little later how these engines were\r\ndeveloped, but it will suffice for the moment to listen to Doctor\r\nTesla's explanation.\r\n\r\n\"All of the successful turbines up to the time of my invention,\" he\r\nsays, \"give the steam something to push upon. For instance\"--taking a\r\npencil and a piece of paper--\"we will consider this circle, the disk,\r\nor rotor of an ordinary turbine. You understand it is the wheel to\r\nwhich the shaft is attached, and which turns the shaft, transmitting\r\npower to the machinery. Now it is a large wheel and along the outer\r\nedge is a row of little blades, or vanes, or buckets. The steam is\r\nturned against these blades, or buckets, in jets from pipes set\r\naround the wheel at close intervals, and the force of the steam\r\non the blades turns the wheel at very high speed and gives us the\r\npower of what we call a 'prime mover'--that is, power which we can\r\nconvert into electricity, or which we can use to drive all kinds of\r\nmachinery. Now see what a big wheel it is and what a very small part\r\nof the wheel is used in giving us power--only the outer edge where\r\nthe steam can push against the blades.\r\n\r\n\"In my new turbine the steam pushes against the whole wheel all at\r\nonce, utilizing all the space wasted in other turbines. There are no\r\nblades or vanes or sockets or anything for the steam to push against,\r\nfor I have proved that they hinder the efficiency of the turbine\r\nrather than increase it.\"\r\n\r\nComparing his turbine to other engines Tesla says, \"In reciprocating\r\nengines of the older type the power-giving portion--the cylinder,\r\npiston, etc.--is no more than a fraction of 1 per cent. of the total\r\nweight of material used in construction. The present form of turbine,\r\nwith an efficiency of about 62 per cent., was a great advance, but\r\neven in this form of machine scarcely more than 1 per cent. or 2 per\r\ncent. is used in actually generating power at a given moment. The\r\nonly part of the great wheel that is used in actually making power is\r\nthe outside edge where the steam pushes on the buckets.\r\n\r\n\"The new turbine offers a striking contrast using as it does\r\npractically the entire material of the power-giving portion of the\r\nengine. The result is an economy that gives an efficiency of 80 per\r\ncent. to 90 per cent. With sufficient boiler capacity on a vessel\r\nsuch as the _Mauretania_, it would be perfectly easy to develop,\r\ninstead of some 70,000 horsepower, 4,000,000 horsepower in the same\r\nspace--and this is a conservative estimate.\r\n\r\n\"You see this is obtained by the new application of this principle in\r\nphysics which never has been used before, by which we can economize\r\non space and weight so that the most of the engine is given over to\r\npower producing parts in which there is little waste material.\"\r\n\r\nTesla then went on to explain the details of his new turbine. Leading\r\nthe way to a small model in his office he unscrewed a few bolts and\r\nlifted off the top half of the round steel drum or casing. Inside\r\nwere a number of perfectly smooth, circular disks mounted upon one\r\ncentral shaft--the shaft that extends through the machine, and\r\ncorresponds to the crankshaft of an ordinary engine. The disks all\r\nwere securely fastened to the rod so that they could not revolve\r\nwithout making it also turn in its carefully adjusted bearings. The\r\ndisks, which were only about one sixteenth of an inch in thickness,\r\nand which he said were constructed of the finest quality of steel,\r\nwere placed close together at regular intervals, so that a space of\r\nonly about an eighth of an inch intervened between them. They were\r\nsolid with the exception of a hole close to the centre. The set of\r\ndisks is called the rotor or runner.\r\n\r\nWhen the casing is clamped down tight, the steam is sent through\r\nan inlet or nozzle at the side, so that it enters at the periphery\r\nor outside edge of the set of disks, at a tangent to the circle\r\nof the rotor. Of course the steam is shot into the turbine under\r\nhigh pressure so that all its force is turned into speed, or what\r\nthe scientists call velocity-energy. The steel casing of the rotor\r\nnaturally gives the steam the circular course of the disks, and as\r\nit travels around the disks the vapour adheres to them, and the\r\nparticles of steam adhere to each other. By the law that Tesla has\r\ninvoked, the steam drags the disks around with it. As the speed of\r\nthe disks increases the path of the steam lengthens, and at an\r\naverage speed the steam actually travels a distance of twelve to\r\nfifteen feet. Starting at the outside edge of the disks it travels\r\naround and around in constantly narrowing circles as the steam\r\npressure decreases until it finally reaches the holes in the disks\r\nat their centre, and there passes out. These holes, then, we see act\r\nas the exhaust for the used-up steam, for by the time the steam,\r\nwhich was shot into the turbine by the nozzle under high pressure,\r\nreaches the exhaust, it registers no more than about two pounds gauge\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE TESLA TURBINE\r\n\r\n  A--Steam Inlet. B--Disks. C--Path of the Steam. D,D´D´´--Exhaust.\r\n  E--Reverse Inlet. F--Shaft.]\r\n\r\nFor reasons which will be explained later, ordinary turbines cannot\r\nbe reversed, but Tesla's invention can run backward just as easily\r\nas forward. The reverse action is accomplished simply by placing\r\nanother nozzle inlet on the other side of the rotor so that the\r\nsteam can be turned off from the right side of the engine, for\r\ninstance, and turned into the left side, immediately reversing its\r\ndirection, with the change in the direction of the steam. The action\r\nis instantaneous, too, for as we saw in the experiments Tesla showed\r\nus, the turbine began to run at practically top speed as soon as the\r\nsteam was turned on.\r\n\r\nThe disks in the little 110-horsepower engine which we saw, were only\r\na little larger than a derby hat were only nine and three quarter\r\ninches in diameter, while in his larger turbines he simply increases\r\nthe diameter of the disks.\r\n\r\nTesla further explained that the 110-horsepower turbine represented\r\na single stage engine, or one composed simply of one rotor. Where\r\ngreater power is required he explained that it would be easy to\r\ncompound a number of rotors to a double, or triple or even what he\r\ncalls a multi, or many stage, turbine. In engineering the single\r\nstage is called one complete power unit, and a large engine could be\r\nmade up of as many units as needed, or practicable.\r\n\r\n\"Then do you mean to say,\" Tesla was asked, \"that the only thing that\r\nmakes the engine revolve at this tremendous speed is the passage of\r\nsteam through the spaces between those smooth disks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is all,\" he answered, \"but as I explained before, the\r\nsteam travels all the way from the outer edge to the centre of\r\nthe disks, working on them all the time; whereas in the ordinary\r\nturbines the steam only works on the outside edge, and all the rest\r\nof the wheel is useless. By the time it leaves the exhaust of my\r\nengine practically all the energy of the steam has been put into the\r\nmachine.\"\r\n\r\nThis is only one of the many advantages that Tesla points out in his\r\ninvention, for the turbine is the exemplification of a principle, and\r\nhence more than a mechanical achievement. \"With a 1,000-horsepower\r\nengine weighing only 100 pounds, imagine the possibility in\r\nautomobiles, locomotives, and steamships,\" he says.\r\n\r\nExplaining the large engines that he is testing, one against the\r\nother, at the power plant, the inventor said:\r\n\r\n\"Inside of the casings of the two larger turbines the disks are\r\neighteen inches in diameter and one thirty-second of an inch thick.\r\nThere are twenty-three of them, spaced a little distance apart, the\r\nwhole making up a total thickness of three and one half inches. The\r\nsteam, entering at the periphery, follows a spiral path toward the\r\ncentre, where openings are provided through which it exhausts. As the\r\ndisks rotate and the speed increases the path of the steam lengthens\r\nuntil it completes a number of turns before reaching the outlet--and\r\nit is working all the time.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, every engineer knows that, when a fluid is used as a\r\nvehicle of energy, the highest possible economy can be obtained only\r\nwhen the changes in the direction and velocity of movement of the\r\nfluid are made as gradual and easy as possible. In previous forms\r\nof turbines more or less sudden changes of speed and direction are\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\"By that I mean to say,\" explained Doctor Tesla, \"that in\r\nreciprocating engines with pistons, the power comes from the backward\r\nand forward jerks of the piston rod, and in other turbines the steam\r\nmust travel a zigzag path from one vane or blade to another all the\r\nwhole length of the turbine. This causes both changes in velocity and\r\ndirection and impairs the efficiency of the machine. In my turbine,\r\nas you saw, the steam enters at the nozzle and travels a natural\r\nspiral path without any abrupt changes in direction, or anything to\r\nhinder its velocity.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Tesla turbine engine, claims the inventor, will work just\r\nas well by gas as by steam, for as he points out gases have the\r\nproperties of adhesion and viscosity just as much as water or steam.\r\n\r\nFurther, he says that if the gas were introduced intermittently in\r\nexplosions like those of the gasoline engine, the machine would\r\nwork as efficiently as it does with a steady pressure of steam.\r\nConsequently Tesla declares that his turbine can be developed for\r\ngeneral use as a gasoline engine.\r\n\r\nThe engine is only one application of the principle of Tesla's\r\nturbine, because he has used the same idea on a pump and an air\r\ncompressor as successfully as on his experimental engines. In his\r\noffice in the Metropolitan Tower he has a number of models. Pointing\r\nto a little machine on a table, which consisted of half a dozen small\r\ndisks three inches in diameter, he said: \"This is only a toy, but\r\nit shows the principle of the invention just as well as the larger\r\nmodels at the power plant.\" Tesla turned on a small electric motor\r\nwhich was connected with a shaft on which the disks were mounted, and\r\nit began to hum at a high number of revolutions per second.\r\n\r\n\"This is the principle of the pump,\" said Tesla. \"Here the electric\r\nmotor furnishes the power and we have these disks revolving in the\r\nair. You need no proof to tell you that the air is being agitated and\r\npropelled violently. If you will hold your hand down near the centre\r\nof these disks--you see the centres have been cut away--you will feel\r\nthe suction as air is drawn in to be expelled from the outer edges.\r\n\r\n\"Now, suppose these revolving disks were enclosed in an air-tight\r\ncase, so constructed that the air could enter only at one point and\r\nbe expelled only at another--what would we have?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd have an air pump,\" was suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly--an air pump or a blower,\" said Doctor Tesla. \"There is one\r\nnow in operation delivering ten thousand cubic feet of air a minute.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was not all, for Tesla showed his visitors a wonderful\r\nexhibition of the little device at work. \"To make a pump out of this\r\nturbine,\" he explained; \"we simply turn the disks by artificial means\r\nand introduce the fluid, air or water at the centre of the disks,\r\nand their rotation, with the properties of adhesion and viscosity\r\nimmediately suck up the fluid and throw it off at the edges of the\r\ndisks.\"\r\n\r\nThe inventor led the way to another room, where he showed his\r\nvisitors two small tanks, one above the other. The lower one was full\r\nof water but the upper one was empty. They were connected by a pipe\r\nwhich terminated over the empty tank. At the side of the lower tank\r\nwas a very small aluminum drum in which, Tesla told his visitors,\r\nwere disks of the kind that are used in his turbine. The shaft of a\r\nlittle one twelfth horsepower motor adjoining was connected with the\r\nrotor through the centre of the casing. \"Inside of this aluminum case\r\nare several disks mounted on a shaft and immersed in water,\" said\r\nDoctor Tesla. \"From this lower tank the water has free access to the\r\ncase enclosing the disks. This pipe leads from the periphery of the\r\ncase. I turn the current on, the motor turns the disks, and as I open\r\nthis valve in the pipe the water flows.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MARVELLOUS TESLA TURBINE\r\n\r\n  The 200-horsepower engine, which a man could lift with one hand.\r\n\r\n  How the Tesla Turbine compares in size with a man.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THOMAS A. EDISON AND HIS CONCRETE FURNITURE\r\n\r\n  The white cabinet is a piece of Edison's poured concrete\r\n  furniture, while the other one is the ordinary wooden phonograph\r\n  cabinet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MODEL OF EDISON POURED CONCRETE HOUSE\r\n\r\n  This little house, which stands on a table in Edison's\r\n  laboratory, shows what he expects to do with the poured concrete\r\n  house.]\r\n\r\nHe turned the valve and the water certainly did flow. Instantly a\r\nstream that would have filled a barrel in a very few minutes began to\r\nrun out of the pipe into the upper part of the tank and thence into\r\nthe lower tank.\r\n\r\n\"This is only a toy,\" smiled the inventor. \"There are only half a\r\ndozen disks--'runners,' I call them--each less than three inches in\r\ndiameter, inside of that case. They are just like the disks you saw\r\non the first motor--no vanes, blades or attachments of any kind.\r\nJust perfectly smooth, flat disks revolving in their own planes and\r\npumping water because of the viscosity and adhesion of the fluid.\r\nOne such pump now in operation, with eight disks, eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter, pumps 4,000 gallons a minute to a height of 360 feet.\r\n\r\n\"From all these things, you can see the possibilities of the new\r\nturbine,\" he continued. \"It will give ten horsepower to one pound of\r\nweight, which is twenty-five times as powerful as many light weight\r\naeroplane engines, which give one horsepower of energy for every two\r\nand one half pounds of weight.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, the machine is one of the cheapest and simplest to build\r\never invented and it has the distinct advantage of having practically\r\nnothing about it to get out of order. There are no fine adjustments,\r\nas the disks do not have to be placed with more than ordinary\r\naccuracy, and there are no fine clearances, because the casing does\r\nnot have to fit more than conveniently close. As you see, there are\r\nno blades or buckets to get broken or to get out of order. These\r\nthings, combined with the easy reversibility, simplicity of the\r\nmachine when used either as an engine, a pump or an air compressor,\r\nand the possibility of using it either with steam, gas, air, or water\r\nas motive power, all combine to afford limitless possibilities for\r\nits development.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Tesla calls the invention the most revolutionary of his\r\ncareer, and it certainly will be if it fulfils the predictions that\r\nso many eminent experts are making for it.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to think that although this latest and most modern\r\nof all steam engines is a turbine, the first steam engine ever\r\ninvented, also was a turbine.\r\n\r\nThough most of us usually think of James Watt as the inventor of\r\nthe steam engine, he was not the first by any means, for the very\r\nfirst of which history gives us any record was a turbine, which was\r\ndescribed by Hero of Alexandria, an ancient Egyptian scientist, who\r\nwrote about 100 B.C.\r\n\r\nHero's engine was a hollow sphere which was made to turn by the\r\nreaction of steam as it escaped from the ends of pipes, so placed\r\nthat they would blow directly upon the ball.\r\n\r\nCenturies later--in 1629, about the time the New England States\r\nwere being colonized--a scientist named Branca made use of the\r\noldest mechanical principle in the world--the paddle-wheel--which,\r\nturned by the never-ceasing river, goes on forever in the service\r\nof mankind. Branca's invention was simply a paddle-wheel turned by\r\na jet of steam instead of by a water current. The engine was really\r\na turbine, for that type is simply a very high development of this\r\nidea--the pushing power of a fluid on a paddle-wheel.\r\n\r\nThe picture of Branca's crude machine shows the head and shoulders\r\nof a great bronze man suspended over a blazing wood fire. Evidently\r\nit is intended to convey the idea that the figure's lungs are filled\r\nwith boiling water, for he is pictured breathing a jet of steam on to\r\nthe blades of a paddle-wheel, the revolving of which sets some crude\r\nmachinery in motion.\r\n\r\nAfter Branca, however, the turbine dropped from view and what\r\nfew inventors did experiment with steam worked on the idea of a\r\nreciprocating engine.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the reciprocating engine, as most boys know from\r\ntheir own experiments with toy steam engines, and as was discovered\r\nby Watt, is simply the utilization of the power of steam for\r\nexpanding with great force when let into first one side, and then the\r\nother side of the cylinder. Thus, as the steam expands, it pushes the\r\npiston back and forth at a high rate of speed, transmitting motion to\r\nshafts and flywheels.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the world was ready for a bigger and more powerful type of\r\nsteam engine; and C. A. Parsons, an Englishman, and Dr. G. de Laval\r\nof Stockholm, brought forth successful turbines at about the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe machines were developed to a high state of efficiency, and are\r\nstill in general use, although most turbines for driving heavy\r\nelectrical machinery in the United States are the great Curtiss\r\nengines, which are a combination of the principles of both the De\r\nLaval and Parsons machines. All of them are run by the old principle\r\nof the water-wheel. Instead of the steam being turned into a cylinder\r\nto push the piston, it is turned into a steel drum or casing in which\r\nwheels or disks are mounted on the central shaft. All along the edge\r\nof these wheels are hundreds of little vanes or blades or buckets\r\nagainst which the steam flows from many nozzles placed all around the\r\ninside of the casing. The steam flows with great force, and naturally\r\npushing against the blades, starts the wheels and the engine shaft\r\nto revolving. After expending its force on the blades that turn the\r\nsteam passes on to a set of stationary blades which then shoot it out\r\nagainst the next set of moving blades.\r\n\r\nIn the Curtiss turbine the wheels at one end of the shaft are smaller\r\nthan those at the other, and the steam enters at the small end,\r\nwhere it is under heavy pressure. After having expended its force\r\non the blades of the first wheel, the steam passes through holes in\r\na partition at the side and zigzags back so that it strikes the\r\nvanes or blades on the next larger disk. It then repeats the process,\r\nexpands a little, and goes to a larger disk. Finally, by the time\r\nthe steam has expanded to its full capacity, the greater part of its\r\nforce has been expended against the disks of the turbine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CURTISS TURBINE\r\n\r\n  Diagram of Steam Diaphragm Showing Nozzles and Fixed and Moving\r\n  Blades\r\n\r\n  A--Single stage turbine wheel. B--Steam nozzles.\r\n\r\n  B´--Steam exhausts. C--Moving blades. D--Stationary blades.]\r\n\r\nFrom this we see the main points of difference between reciprocating\r\nengines and turbines, and between most turbines and Tesla's invention.\r\n\r\nWhile most turbines take advantage of the expansive power of steam,\r\nthe main idea is to make use of the velocity of the vapour as it is\r\ndriven from a set of nozzles around the turbine wheel, under high\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nAlso it will be seen that Tesla's invention is a turbine in form, but\r\nthat it is entirely different from either of the two earlier types,\r\nbecause instead of giving the steam something to push against, it is\r\nallowed to follow its own natural course around between the smooth\r\ndisks, and drag them after it.\r\n\r\nSome kind of a crank motion is necessary in all reciprocating\r\nengines, to convert the backward and forward movement of the piston\r\nto the rotary motion of the shaft, but this is done away with\r\nentirely in the turbine. What engineers call a \"direct drive\" is\r\nsubstituted in its place. In other words, the turbine wheels or\r\ndisks, fastened to the shaft, turn it, and drive the machinery\r\ndirectly from the source of power. The speed of the machine is\r\nregulated by gears.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of the \"direct drive,\" particularly for big\r\nsteamships and for turning big electric dynamos, will be plain to\r\nevery boy when he thinks of the long narrow body of a ship in which\r\ncan lie the turbine engines working directly on the propeller shafts\r\n(with the exception of certain gears, of course, for regulating the\r\nspeed) instead of the big flywheels, and flying cranks of marine\r\nreciprocating engines. Also with dynamos it is just as important\r\nto have the power applied directly to save space and increase the\r\ngeneral efficiency of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe greatest disadvantage of the usual kinds of turbines for most\r\nmachinery, including steamships, is the fact that they cannot be\r\nreversed. To solve this difficulty, all the great ocean and coast\r\nliners, battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats that are equipped\r\nwith turbines have two sets of engines, one for straight ahead and\r\none for backward.\r\n\r\nWith the Tesla turbine this disadvantage, as we have seen, is\r\nentirely done away with, and the one turbine can be reversed as\r\neasily and simply as it can be started.\r\n\r\nAnd so, while we are waiting for the world-moving wireless\r\ntransmission of power and for the completion of Tesla's invention for\r\nsafe and stable airships, we can look for the speedy development of\r\nhis turbine in practically all departments of mechanical engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF CONCRETE\r\n\r\n   THE ONE-PIECE HOUSE OF THOMAS A.

For the boy who intends\r\nto become a civil engineer this wonderful material will have an\r\nespecial interest, because its successful use in all of the greatest\r\nengineering works going on to-day has brought it to the front as\r\nthe modern substitute, in a great many cases, for wood, brick, or\r\nexpensive stone and steel structures.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WHAT ONE SET OF BOYS DID WITH CONCRETE\r\n\r\n  This Indian tepee of concrete was made by the boys of Dr. W. A.\r\n  Keyes' summer school, at Sebasco, Maine.\r\n\r\n  The picture on the left shows the method of construction.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MASSIVE CONCRETE WORK\r\n\r\n  Completed side walls of solid concrete in the Gatun Locks of the\r\n  Panama Canal.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A LEVEL STRETCH OF CATSKILL AQUEDUCT\r\n\r\n  Showing completed section as well as forms for the concrete.]\r\n\r\nOn entering the cement show our friends saw on every side long rows\r\nof booths showing models of structures and articles that could\r\nbe made of concrete. There were models of houses, subways, dams,\r\nbridges, dock works, retaining walls, sewers, bridges, pavements\r\nand even boats and furniture. In fact, so the men in the exhibition\r\nbooths said, concrete can be used for practically every building\r\npurpose where strength, lasting qualities, and resistance to heat and\r\ncold are needed. \"This is the concrete age,\" they declared. \"Concrete\r\nis fireproof, waterproof, sanitary, and resists frost when properly\r\nused. Our timber supply is decreasing, the supply of iron ore for\r\nstructural steel is limited, and stone is expensive; so concrete,\r\nreinforced with steel, and used by engineers who understand their\r\nbusiness, will be the greatest building material of the future.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the things that the enthusiasts at all the concrete shows\r\nsay, but they admit that there are certain kinds of construction in\r\nwhich concrete is not as effective as steel or granite. Also they\r\nsay that the use of reinforced concrete requires the highest type of\r\nengineering skill, and a complete understanding of the technicalities\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nOne of the places where we know concrete best is in pavements and\r\nsidewalks, and several of the booths exhibited samples of such work.\r\nTo show its strength the men in charge piled on weights, struck the\r\nslabs with hammers, or subjected them to any kind of hard usage\r\nsuggested by the crowd. Then, too, there were sections of concrete\r\nbuildings, and exhibitions of various systems of reinforced concrete\r\nconstruction. With these there were concrete chimneys, portable\r\nconcrete garages, railroad ties, and what not.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but look here,\" broke out the boy as he led his older friend\r\nabout. \"Here's a perfect model of a house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the man, \"that is a model of the famous Edison poured\r\ncement, or 'one-piece' house, the latest invention of our great\r\nAmerican inventor.\"\r\n\r\nThere the little building stood, perfect in every way, surrounded\r\nby a model concrete wall, a beautiful lawn, and approached by fine\r\nconcrete walks and driveways.\r\n\r\n\"This model,\" explained the scientist, \"represents what Thomas\r\nA. Edison is trying to get time to accomplish for workingmen and\r\ntheir families. Instead of being built piece by piece, the house is\r\nsupposed to be made all at one time by pouring the concrete into a\r\ncomplete set of moulds. This house is so interesting that we shall\r\nlook at it much closer a little later on.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here,\" said the boy; \"what's this?\"\r\n\r\nHe had paused before a perfect model of the Gatun locks of the Panama\r\nCanal, where the world's greatest work in concrete, or any other\r\nkind of masonry, is being carried on. The work is greater than the\r\nPyramids of Egypt or the Great Wall of China. Though we will not\r\nbother ourselves much with figures, it will give an idea of the\r\nsize of the job on the canal when we realize that it will require\r\n8,000,000 cubic yards of concrete, and more then 900,000 tons of\r\nPortland cement.\r\n\r\nIn all there will be six great locks for the transportation of our\r\nships from the Atlantic to the Pacific and back. Three of these locks\r\nare at Gatun on the Atlantic side of the canal, one at Pedro Miguel,\r\nand two at Miraflores. Each lock will be 1,000 feet long, 110 feet\r\nwide, and 45 feet deep--and practically all of this is done with\r\nconcrete. So massive is most of the work that steel reinforcement\r\nis only necessary in certain parts of the project. The problem of\r\nsinking the great retaining walls to bedrock, and making them strong\r\nenough to hold in the face of the tremendous floods of the Chagres\r\nRiver, alone makes one of the most stupendous engineering works ever\r\nundertaken by man. Were it not for the use of concrete the cost\r\nof the work would be so great as to make it almost impossible of\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe model of the Gatun locks showed the boy everything, just as it\r\nwill be when the canal is opened for traffic in 1913. There was the\r\nwide Gatun lake, surrounded by the tropical forests, the great Gatun\r\ndam, and the series of locks in one solid mass of concrete. These\r\nlocks when completed will be 3,800 feet long, and their tremendous\r\nheight and thickness can be seen from the pictures of the work as it\r\nis actually being carried on. In the model there were perfect little\r\nships on the lake and going through the locks.\r\n\r\nBesides the many present day uses of cement some of the concrete\r\nenthusiasts are suggesting that heavily reinforced concrete be used\r\nin place of steel in making bank vaults, as they declare that the\r\nmaterial will resist the keen tools and the powerful explosives of\r\nbank robbers even more successfully than the hardest steel.\r\n\r\nThen too, at the cement show, the boy saw, besides models of big\r\nworks and examples of all kinds of concrete construction, exhibits of\r\nthe various methods of placing steel bars and steel network in the\r\ncement to make it stronger, and the different machines used in mixing\r\nconcrete and in making Portland cement, which is the binding element\r\nin concrete.\r\n\r\nAs concrete is a material that can be mixed by an amateur and used\r\nfor a great many purposes, the booths where mixing and simple uses\r\nwere demonstrated attracted a great deal of attention. For instance,\r\nin the last few years the farmers have found out that they can make\r\nwatering troughs, drains, floors for stables, hen houses, and even\r\nfence posts, of concrete just as easily as they can of wood or iron.\r\nMoreover, the articles thus made will last practically forever. All\r\nthat is needed is a supply of Portland cement, and a little careful\r\nstudy as to the best way of mixing it with the proper amounts of sand\r\nand gravel. The amateur has best results if he starts modestly and\r\ntakes up the use of reinforced concrete after learning how to use\r\nthe material in its simple form.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting uses of reinforced concrete for the\r\namateur who has learned something of the craft is in making a good,\r\nseaworthy rowboat, or even a small motor boat. Poured boats are\r\nstrong, graceful, and durable. If they are properly made there never\r\nis any danger of their leaking, and by a little extra pains it is\r\npossible to make them with air-tight compartments so that they are\r\nnon-sinkable.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of making concrete boats is very simple. The kind of\r\nboat to be duplicated is borrowed and hung on the shore so that it\r\nswings free of the ground. Then a mould of clay is built all around\r\nit. A strong bank of sand is heaped around the clay, to hold it firm.\r\nThen the boat is worked a little each way so that a space of about an\r\ninch and a half is left all around between the outside of the boat\r\nand the clay. The space between the boat and the clay is the space\r\ninto which the concrete is poured for sides and bottom after the\r\nreinforcing rods have been properly inserted. After the whole thing\r\nhas stood a day or so the inside boat is taken out and the clay mould\r\nbroken down, revealing a complete concrete hull.\r\n\r\nThus, we see that concrete can be used as a building material in\r\npractically any kind of construction, that it is easily handled\r\nsince all that is necessary is to pour it into the moulds after the\r\nengineers have properly placed the reinforcement, and that it can be\r\ncast in practically any decorative design just as easily as plain.\r\nAdd to this the fact that concrete is cheaper than stone or steel,\r\nand that it is practically indestructible when properly handled, and\r\nit is easy to see the reason for calling this the cement age, and\r\nconcrete _the_ building material of the future.\r\n\r\nAfter the Panama Canal, the greatest engineering feat in which\r\nconcrete figures as one of the chief materials used, is the Catskill\r\naqueduct, by which water from four watersheds in the Catskill\r\nMountains of New York State is to be piped to all five boroughs of\r\nNew York City. The Ashokan reservoir, near Kensington, N. Y., was\r\nthe first part of the work to be taken up, together with the Kensico\r\nstorage reservoir twenty-five miles from New York, several smaller\r\nreservoirs, and the aqueducts to carry this water from the mountains\r\nto every home in greater New York. The dam and containing walls of\r\nthe Ashokan reservoir are all made of reinforced concrete, and the\r\nsize of the lake and the strength of the walls can be appreciated\r\nwhen one thinks that the 130,000,000,000 gallons of water it holds\r\nin check would cover all Manhattan Island with twenty-eight feet of\r\nwater. A large part of the aqueduct proper, through which this great\r\nstream of water is carried from the mountains, under the Hudson\r\nRiver, and to the city where it runs more than a hundred feet below\r\nthe street level, is made of reinforced concrete.\r\n\r\nFor other examples of the use of this material in big engineering\r\nworks a boy has only to look around him. There are the tunnels under\r\nthe rivers around New York, the New York subways, the Philadelphia\r\nand Boston subways, the Detroit River tunnel, bridges, culverts, big\r\npiers and other dock works, miles of concrete snowsheds along the\r\nlines of the railroads that cross the continental divide of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and in fact practically every big structural undertaking.\r\n\r\nAlmost anywhere we look these days we see a big machine crushing\r\nrock, mixing it with sand and mortar, and turning out concrete to be\r\nshovelled into a hole and perhaps used far below the surface by \"sand\r\nhogs\" working under compressed air, or hoisted to the towering walls\r\nof some great office building or factory that is being constructed of\r\nthe artificial stone.\r\n\r\nWe are familiar with the falsework of a concrete building under\r\nconstruction. It is all, apparently, a maze of wooden beams that\r\nlook like scaffoldings, and yet they seem to make the outlines of\r\nthe building. This maze of woodwork, seemingly so lacking in plan or\r\nsystem, as a matter of fact is a triumph of engineering skill, for it\r\nis the mould for the building, and was all built by the most careful\r\nplans as to strains, stresses, floor loads, etc.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, before building the mould for a residence, school,\r\ntheatre, office building, or factory, the engineer decides what\r\nstrength his foundations must have. The foundation for a small\r\nresidence is an easy matter, but when it comes to a big factory, or\r\nan office building of a dozen stories or so, the most careful work\r\nmust be done beforehand. In the old days, when it was desired to\r\nsink the foundations of a building down to bedrock, they used steel\r\nor wooden piles, but these will rust or rot, and the modern way is\r\nto use concrete piles. Either the great poles are moulded first and\r\nsunk like the ordinary wooden ones, or a pipe with a sharpened point\r\nis sunk and the concrete deposited in it by buckets designed for the\r\npurpose. Once these piles are driven, they are there for all time,\r\nif the work is done properly, and the engineer can be sure that his\r\nbuilding is as good as if resting on bedrock.\r\n\r\nFrom then on the erection of a reinforced concrete building is a\r\nmost intricate matter, because while concrete in itself is a very\r\nsimple substance, its use in buildings is a highly developed science.\r\nOf course there are many different methods of using concrete,\r\nand each one prescribes a different kind of steel network for\r\nthe reinforcement. Then, too, some engineers cast parts of their\r\nbuildings separately and put them in place after they have set, while\r\nothers run the concrete for beams, floors, and walls into moulds,\r\nbuilt right where those parts are to be in the finished structure.\r\nIn laying the steel reinforcing rods, before the concrete is poured,\r\nthe engineer sees that they make a perfect network so as to take\r\ncare of all the strains, just as they will be put upon the building\r\nwhen it is completed. It is in the proper placing of reinforcement\r\nthat the greatest engineering knowledge is needed in this kind of\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nAs the wooden moulds for the first foundation beams and girders are\r\ncompleted and the reinforcement is placed, the concrete is poured in.\r\nThe subcellar or cellar floor mould then is laid, the reinforcement\r\nplaced and the concrete run in. Next the moulds for the cellar walls\r\nare built and perhaps the moulds for the beams and girders for the\r\nfirst floor. The reinforcing rods are placed in these moulds and the\r\nconcrete run in, and so on, a story at a time, or a small section\r\nat a time, until the structure reaches the height called for in\r\nthe plans, and it stands completed. As the building progresses and\r\nthe concrete on the lower floor sets, the moulds can be taken down\r\nand used on higher stories. Concrete is even used for the roofs of\r\nbuildings, as it can be moulded right in place or set up in slabs\r\nthat can be later cemented together.\r\n\r\nWhen properly used reinforced concrete is absolutely fireproof, so\r\nit is coming into extensive use in the construction of schools,\r\ntheatres, warehouses, factories, and all other such buildings where a\r\ngreat height is not required. So far, none of the great skyscrapers\r\nhas been built of reinforced concrete, although office buildings of\r\nsixteen stories have been erected with complete success.\r\n\r\nThere is still another method of using concrete as a building\r\nmaterial. This is in the form of building blocks, and doubtless all\r\nwho read this will recall seeing many beautiful residences built of\r\nblocks of stone that on closer inspection proved to be concrete. The\r\nblocks can be cast in any size or form and used in just the same way\r\nas structural stone.\r\n\r\nNow, after having looked about the city and having seen the numerous\r\nways that concrete is used as a building material, we come back\r\nto the very latest thing in the use of this man-made stone--the\r\n\"one-piece\" or poured house.\r\n\r\nFor a good view of it let us take a little jaunt out to West Orange,\r\nN. J., with the scientist and look into the library of Thomas A.\r\nEdison's laboratory, where we will see a perfect model of this marvel\r\nof invention. It is practically the same as the one at the cement\r\nshow. Standing in the centre of the great room where Edison works\r\nis this perfect little cottage, about the size of a large doll's\r\nhouse. It represents not only Edison's latest invention, but also his\r\nfavourite scheme. In years to come, when the boys who read this are\r\ngrown men, it will probably be no novelty to build houses by pouring\r\nthem all at once into a steel mould, but just at present it is one of\r\nthe most startling developments in an age of epoch-making inventions.\r\n\r\nEvery boy knows that Edison has never followed the ideas of others in\r\nworking out his inventions, and the poured house is no exception to\r\nhis rule. It will be interesting to take a little look back over a\r\npart of Edison's life and see how he came to enter the cement-making\r\nbusiness, and how, when he had his process down to a fine point, he\r\nsaid to himself, \"It is cheap and easy to build a house or an office\r\nbuilding of concrete in sections, why not build it all in one piece?\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see that no sooner had he asked himself this startling\r\nquestion than he began by making models, and satisfied himself that\r\nit was not only possible, but one of the cheapest and best methods\r\nof making small, simply arranged houses, such as could be bought or\r\nrented for a small sum.\r\n\r\nAlthough Edison has within the last few years brought his idea to a\r\nstate where it can be put to practical use, he himself is not trying\r\nto push it commercially, as he has his other great inventions like\r\nthe phonograph, storage battery, and the motion-picture machine. In\r\nfact, he is content to let it be worked out by others just so long\r\nas it fulfills his idea of giving to workingmen good houses at a low\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\"Years ago, long before Edison had retired from active business\r\naffairs to give his whole attention to scientific research,\" said the\r\nscientist, as he and the boy walked about the laboratory, \"he became\r\ninterested in metallurgy, just as he was and always is interested in\r\nevery other science where great difficulties must be overcome. In\r\nthose days iron and steel were not used as extensively as they are\r\nnow, but the scientists and leaders in the big industries saw that\r\nthe day was coming when far, far greater quantities of iron ore would\r\nbe needed to supply the great demand for steel to build skyscrapers,\r\nships, machinery, and so on. Men were going farther and farther away\r\nin their search for iron ore, but Edison, with his never failing\r\noriginality, said to himself that it was likely there was plenty of\r\niron ore right around his laboratory in New Jersey if he only knew\r\nhow to get at it.\r\n\r\n\"For one thing,\" continued the boy's friend, \"Edison had seen on\r\nthe ocean beaches great stretches of white sand with millions and\r\nmillions of little black particles sprinkled through them. He knew\r\nthat the specks were pure iron ore. You can prove this to yourself\r\nby simply holding a good magnet close to a pile of such sand, and\r\nwatching the iron particles collect.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Edison's idea to concentrate the iron ore found in the earth,\r\nin just this way, for he had sent out a corps of surveyors who had\r\nreported vast quantities of low-grade ore in most of the Atlantic\r\nCoast States. Low-grade ore is that which contains only a small\r\npercentage of the metal desired, and hence it does not pay to smelt\r\nit, unless a very cheap process can be found. Edison thought he had\r\na process cheap enough, for he simply intended to grind the mountains\r\nto sand and take out the particles of iron by running it through a\r\nhopper with a high-power magnet at the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe process sounds simple, but the machinery required was very\r\ncomplicated, to say nothing of being extremely heavy. Edison set up\r\nhis mill in the mountains of New Jersey and started to blast down the\r\ncliffs of low-grade ore and run them through a series of gigantic\r\ncrushers that ground them to a fine powder. The iron particles,\r\ncalled concentrates, after being extricated were pressed into\r\nbriquets ready for delivery to the foundry.\r\n\r\nAfter having spent close to $2,000,000 on the experiment, and\r\nsatisfactorily proving its mechanical success, the discovery of vast\r\nquantities of high-grade ore in the Messaba range of Minnesota forced\r\nEdison to close his plant. \"This would have been a crushing failure\r\nto most men,\" added the scientist, \"but Edison's only comment was\r\na whimsical smile. Indeed, even on his way home after closing his\r\nplant, Edison was planning new and more important activities, for\r\nwith his experience at rock crushing he was satisfied he could enter\r\nthe field as a maker of the building material called Portland cement.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time cement and concrete were even less used than were steel\r\nand iron, but Edison for many years had seen that in the future they\r\nwould take the place of wood, stone, and brick.\r\n\r\n\"Well-made concrete, employing a high grade of Portland cement,\"\r\nsaid Edison on one occasion, \"is the most lasting material known.\r\nPractical confirmation of this statement may be found abundantly in\r\nItaly at the present time, where many concrete structures exist, made\r\nof old Roman cement, constructed more than a thousand years ago, and\r\nare still in a good state of preservation.\r\n\r\n\"Concrete will last as long as granite and is far more resistant to\r\nfire than any known stone.\"\r\n\r\nBut Edison had something more than a successful business in mind when\r\nhe returned from his rock-crushing plant, for he intended setting\r\nup cement-making machinery such as had never before been seen. With\r\nthis end in view he began to read up on the subject, just as we have\r\nseen the Wright brothers read up on aviation. Incidentally, as an\r\nindication of the manner in which this wizard works, it may be said\r\nthat all this time Edison was perfecting his new storage battery.\r\n\r\nOne big improvement upon the usual process in the manufacture of\r\ncement, planned by Edison, was that the grinding should be so fine\r\nthat 65 per cent. of the ground clinker should pass through a\r\n200-mesh screen instead of only 75 per cent. as is the usual rule.\r\nThus, Edison made into cement 10 per cent. more material that other\r\nmanufacturers sent back to be ground over again.\r\n\r\nThe success of Edison's Portland cement plant is not matter for our\r\nattention here, so we will pass over those busy years to the time of\r\nEdison's retirement to devote all his time to scientific research.\r\n\r\nFor many years he had watched the cities grow, had seen the great\r\ntenements become more crowded, and less comfortable each year. He\r\nhad seen the children playing in the streets, and had compared their\r\nlives to the happy lives of the children whose parents could afford\r\nto live away from the great cities, where boys could have yards to\r\nplay in. He decided that the boys of the city streets would have a\r\nfar better time, that their mothers and fathers would have a far more\r\ncheerful life if they could live in comfortable little houses in the\r\ncountry with yards, and gardens, and plenty of room for every one.\r\n\r\nEdison saw that what was needed was a building material cheap enough,\r\nand a method of using it cheap enough, so that dwellings could be put\r\nup at a cost that would place them within the means of workingmen and\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\nConcrete, he decided, was the material to solve the problem, and\r\nEdison set himself to the task of making houses poured complete into\r\none mould so as to make the cost of labour as low as possible. The\r\n\"one-piece\" house was an assured thing from that time on. All that\r\nremained was for the \"Wizard of Orange,\" as he is called, to work\r\nout the difficult details of a properly mixed cement and a practical\r\nsystem of moulds.\r\n\r\nAn incident that occurred at the time of the failure of his ore\r\ncrushing plant in the New Jersey mountains was one of the things that\r\nbrought the whole situation home to him. When the plant was closed\r\nand the buildings vacated, the fire insurance companies cancelled the\r\npolicies, declaring that the moral risk was too great.\r\n\r\nThe inventor's reply was short and to the point. He made no protest\r\nagainst the cancellation of his policies, but simply said he would\r\nneed no more policies, as he would erect fireproof buildings in which\r\nthere would be no \"moral risk.\"\r\n\r\nThis promise of Edison's, made at the time of his so-called failure\r\nand pondered during the years of his tremendous activities, was\r\nnot redeemed until he had retired from the business of invention\r\nas a means of gaining riches. \"I am not making these experiments\r\nfor money,\" Edison has said many times. \"This model represents the\r\ncharacter of the house which I will construct of concrete. I believe\r\nit can be built by machinery in lots of 100 or more at one location\r\nfor a price which will be so low that it can be purchased or rented\r\nby families whose total income is not more than $550 per annum. It is\r\nan attempt to solve the housing question by a practical application\r\nof science, and the latest advancement in cement and mechanical\r\nengineering.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HUGE CONCRETE MOULDS AT PANAMA\r\n\r\n  These great locks are made as monoliths or in moulds of one\r\n  piece, the whole making the greatest masonry work the world has\r\n  ever seen.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CONCRETE LOCKS ON THE PANAMA CANAL\r\n\r\n  The Gatun middle locks, east chamber, looking south from the east\r\n  bank.]\r\n\r\nEdison's plan, as we have seen before, was simply to make a set\r\nof moulds in the shape of the house he desired to build, run the\r\nconcrete into them, let them stand until the material had settled,\r\nand then take down the retaining surfaces, exposing to view the\r\nfinished house.\r\n\r\nIt was contrary to all the previous ideas in building, and was\r\nridiculed by many famous architects. Nevertheless, tremendous\r\nobstacles are the stuff upon which Edison's genius feeds, and he only\r\nworked the harder to produce a concrete that would be liquid enough\r\nto fill all the intricate spaces and turns in the moulds and yet\r\nsufficiently thick to prevent the sand or gravel in the concrete from\r\nsinking to the bottom. Thus, it first had to run like thin mush and\r\nthen set in walls and floors harder than any brick or stone. Another\r\nof the difficulties to be overcome was to discover a concrete that\r\nwould give perfectly smooth walls.\r\n\r\nAlthough this may sound very simple, it has not yet been completely\r\nworked out in this country, owing to the heavy demands on Edison's\r\ntime. The perfected process, however, will be made known just as soon\r\nas the inventor can find time to complete certain small details that\r\nhe wants to clear up before giving the system to the world. A French\r\nsyndicate working along Edison's ideas for a poured house has made\r\nsome progress and it is reported they have constructed two attractive\r\ndwellings with considerable success. One of these is at Santpoort,\r\nHolland, and the other near Paris.\r\n\r\nWhether the houses are poured completely in one mould, or whether\r\nthey are built a story at a time on different days, this newest form\r\nof house building is carried on along about the same lines.\r\n\r\n\"Let us just suppose,\" said the scientist, \"that we are standing on\r\na building site in some pretty suburb of a great city. We will also\r\nsuppose that an Edison poured house is to be erected there. Plans are\r\ndrawn beforehand for a small house of simple arrangement and a set\r\nof steel moulds in convenient sizes are turned out. These moulds all\r\nhave connections so they can be set up and joined together in one\r\npiece. First, we see that a solid concrete cellar floor, called the\r\n'footing', has been laid down just the size and shape of the house.\r\nA crowd of skilled workmen quickly set up the moulds on this footing\r\nand lock them together. The moulds make one complete shell of the\r\nhouse, from cellar to roof, just as it will appear when completed.\r\nReinforcing rods are placed in the mould so that they will be left in\r\nthe concrete walls, floors, etc., of the house after the steel shell\r\nis taken away.\r\n\r\n\"Nearby we see a few more skilled workmen mixing the concrete in\r\ngreat vats. When the mould and the material are ready we see the\r\nconcrete taken to a tank on the roof and poured into troughs which\r\ncarry the stuff to a number of different holes through which it\r\nflows into the mould. We hear it splash, splash, splash as it\r\ngradually fills every space in the shell, and finally after six hours\r\nor so it overflows at the roof. The main part of the work is now done\r\nand we can go away for a few days while the liquid in the shell sets,\r\nor turns to the hardest kind of stone.\r\n\r\n\"After about six days we return to see the moulds unlocked, taken\r\ndown and the complete house standing ready with walls, floors,\r\nstairways, chimneys, bathtubs, stationary tubs in the cellar,\r\nelectric-wire conduits, water, gas and heating pipes all complete. In\r\nmaking the moulds the spaces for bathtubs, wash-tubs, electric wiring\r\nand piping for gas, water, and heat, are just as carefully arranged\r\nas walls and floors. The only work necessary after the concrete has\r\nset is to put in the doors and windows, install the furnace and\r\nnecessary fixtures for heating, lighting and plumbing and connect\r\nthem up ready for use. No plaster is used in these houses, but the\r\nwalls can be tinted or decorated just as the landlord or occupant\r\ndesires.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy's friend went on to say that one might think that this\r\nwas about as far as science could carry the use of concrete, but\r\nEdison said to himself: \"If we can make houses, why can't we make\r\nfurniture?\" and he set about experimenting with poured furniture. He\r\nobtained some wonderful results with this newest use of concrete, and\r\nin his Orange laboratory he has several cabinets, chairs, and other\r\narticles of furniture that are every bit as attractive to look at as\r\nwooden furniture and that are practically indestructible.\r\n\r\n\"And my concrete furniture will be cheap, as well as strong,\" says\r\nEdison. \"If I couldn't put it out cheaper than the oak that comes\r\nfrom Grand Rapids, I wouldn't go into the business. If a newlywed\r\nstarts out with, say, $450 worth of furniture on the installment\r\nplan, I feel confident that we can give him more artistic and more\r\ndurable furniture for $200. I'll also be able to put out a whole\r\nbedroom set for $5 or $6.\"\r\n\r\nAt present the weight of this concrete furniture is about one third\r\ngreater than wooden furniture, but Edison is confident he can reduce\r\nthis excess to one quarter. The concrete surface can, of course,\r\nbe stained in imitation of any wood finish. The phonograph cabinet\r\nshown at the left of Edison in the picture opposite page 281 has been\r\ntrimmed in white and gold. Its surface resembles enamelled wood. The\r\ncabinet at his right is the old style wooden type.\r\n\r\nThis concrete cabinet easily withstood the hard usage of shipment by\r\nfreight for a long distance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE WORLD-WIDE USE OF CONCRETE\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the Atlas Portland Cement Co.\r\n\r\n  An eight-story all-concrete office building under construction in\r\n  Portland, Maine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the Atlas Portland Cement Co.\r\n\r\n  A perfect little model of the great Gatun Locks of the Panama\r\n  Canal.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CATSKILL AQUEDUCT, ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST\r\n  CONCRETE WORKS\r\n\r\n  Laying a level section of the great concrete tunnel through which\r\n  New York City is to get its drinking water.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE AQUEDUCT DEEP UNDER GROUND\r\n\r\n  A partially completed section showing the concrete work. Note the\r\n  size of the tunnel.]\r\n\r\nOf course, the poured concrete furniture is made in just the same\r\nway as the houses except that it is a much simpler process. It is a\r\nvery easy matter to set up a steel mould for a chair, a cabinet, a\r\ndresser, or a bedstead, whereas a house, with its tubs, conduits,\r\nstairways, hallways, doorways, window frames, plumbing system, etc.,\r\nis a most complex matter, requiring a set of moulds that could be put\r\ntogether properly by only a man who combined the highest abilities\r\nof an architect, a builder, an engineer, and a mechanic. Although\r\nconcrete has been used for many years in making garden furniture,\r\nEdison's plan for making finished indoor pieces with it is entirely\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the houses; Edison says it is just as easy to make\r\npoured dwellings in decorative designs as in plain ones. It is\r\nonly necessary to have the moulds cast in the desired shape. It is\r\nhis idea to have all the poured houses pretty as well as perfectly\r\nsanitary and substantial. He intends that there shall be many\r\ndifferent kinds of moulds, and also that each set of moulds shall be\r\nso cast that it can be joined in different ways, in order to give the\r\nhouses a variety of appearance. Thus, in a small town where a large\r\nnumber of poured houses were set up, there would be no two exactly\r\nalike if the owners preferred to have them different.\r\n\r\nAccording to the plans Edison now has on foot, the first complete\r\npoured houses will have on the main floor two rooms, the living\r\nroom and dining room, while on the second floor there will be four\r\nrooms, a bathroom and hallway. Of course as the main idea is to give\r\nperfectly sanitary and comfortable houses, there will be plenty of\r\nwindows, for lots of fresh air and sunlight. Edison figures that\r\nhe can build a house of poured concrete for $1,200 that would cost\r\n$30,000 if built of cut stone. Furthermore, he figures that the rent\r\nought to be about $10 per month, as he will only license reputable\r\nconcerns to use his patents, and his licenses will stipulate the\r\napproximate rent that can be charged.\r\n\r\nThus, the high cost of living about which we all hear so much at the\r\nfamily dinner table as well as everywhere else is being attacked by\r\nscience and invention through a new channel, and Edison's latest\r\ninvention can be expected soon to give good homes at low rents to\r\nthousands of families now paying exorbitant prices for dark stuffy\r\ncity flats.\r\n\r\nIt was significant that at the celebration of Edison's sixty-fifth\r\nbirthday, February 10, 1912, the great American inventor should sit\r\nat the head of the table surrounded by his family and associates\r\nfacing a perfect model of one of his poured cement houses. The chair\r\nin which he sat, to all appearances was beautiful mahogany, but in\r\nreality was cast in a mould of Edison concrete at the Edison plant.\r\nAt the place of each guest was a bronze paperweight, appropriately\r\nengraved, with Edison's favourite motto:\r\n\r\n\"All things come to him who hustles while he waits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CONCRETE\r\n\r\nAlthough concrete is in truth the newest building material in\r\nour time, it is the oldest known to civilization because it was\r\nthe stuff with which the eternal buildings of ancient Rome were\r\nconstructed. Even before the Romans used concrete it was used by the\r\nEygptians, more than 4,000 years ago. Every boy will remember from\r\nhis history classes that the Egyptians, so far as we can learn, were\r\nthe first people in the history of the world to reach a high state of\r\ncivilization. Every boy also will remember that the only way we know\r\nthis is through the evidence of ruins of tombs and buildings. Many of\r\nthese buildings were made of a material very much like concrete that\r\nmust have been made in some such manner as concrete is made nowadays.\r\n\r\nAbout 2,000 years later, long after the Egyptian civilization had\r\ndied, the men of Carthage discovered concrete for themselves and\r\nbuilt a marvellous aqueduct 70 miles long, through which water\r\nwas brought to their city. It was carried across a great valley\r\nover about 1,000 arches, many of which are still standing in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nTo the Romans, however, we are indebted for some of the best examples\r\nof ancient concrete work. They used this material in their wonderful\r\ncity for buildings, bridges, sewers, aqueducts, water mains, and in\r\nfact in a great many of the ways that we have seen it is used to-day.\r\nThe great Coliseum and the Pantheon at Rome are relics of the skill\r\nof the ancient architects in the use of concrete.\r\n\r\nAlthough many historians think that the secret of making cementious\r\nbuilding material was lost from the fall of Rome until the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century, there are ruins of ancient castles which\r\nstood in mediæval times in Europe which indicate at least some use of\r\nconcrete.\r\n\r\nThe real discoverer of natural cement in our modern times though,\r\nwas John Smeaton, who will be remembered by the readers of \"The\r\nBoy's Second Book of Inventions\" as the man who built the first\r\nrock lighthouse at Eddystone, England, in 1756. In his great work\r\nhe discovered a kind of limestone with which he could make a cement\r\nthat would set, or harden, under water. His discovery was hailed as\r\nthe recovery of the secret of the ancient Romans of making hydraulic\r\ncement. It was so called because it would harden under water.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, Joseph Parker, another Englishman, made what he called Roman\r\ncement. Several others followed, and in 1818 natural cement was\r\nfirst made in the United States by Canvass White near Fayetteville,\r\nN. Y. The material was made from natural rock and was used in the\r\nconstruction of the Erie Canal.\r\n\r\nAll of these early cements are called natural cements by engineers\r\nnowadays, because they were made from natural rock. It was only\r\nnecessary to find a clayey limestone which contained a certain\r\npercentage of iron oxide and two other minerals known as silica and\r\nalumina. The limestone was crushed to a convenient size and was\r\nburned in a kiln. The heat turned the stuff into cinders which, when\r\nground to a fine powder and mixed with water, would make a cement\r\nthat would harden under either air or water very quickly, and last\r\nfor practically all time. Just for the sake of those who have studied\r\nchemistry we will say that in this process the heat drives off the\r\ncarbon dioxide in the limestone, and the lime, combining with the\r\nsilica alumina and iron oxide, forms a mass containing mineral\r\nproperties called silicates, aluminates, and ferrites of lime. These\r\nproperties mixed with the water make natural cement. In the United\r\nStates, natural cement was called Rosendale cement, because it was\r\nfirst made commercially in a town of New York State by that name.\r\n\r\nThe supply of natural cement, however, is limited, because the proper\r\nkind of limestone is only found in a few places. Consequently, when\r\nan artificial mortar called Portland cement was invented in 1824, the\r\nworld took a step forward that could not be measured in those days.\r\n\r\nMost authorities give the credit for the invention to Joseph Aspdin,\r\na bricklayer of Leeds, England. He took out a patent on the material\r\nand in 1825 set up a large factory. In 1828 Portland cement was used\r\nin the Thames tunnel, making the first time that the material figured\r\nin any big engineering work. In those days even the most enthusiastic\r\nsupporters of cement little dreamed that in this modern age it would\r\nbe the material that would make possible such tremendous victories\r\nover the obstacles of nature as the Panama Canal, the tunnels under\r\nthe rivers that surround New York and the great dams that hold back\r\nthe waters all over the country.\r\n\r\nAspdin, however, is not given the credit for the invention of\r\nPortland cement by all authorities, as some claim that Isaac Johnson,\r\nalso an Englishman, who early in 1912 died at the age of 104, was\r\nreally the first man to invent a practical, commercial, artificial\r\ncement.\r\n\r\nThe advantage in Portland cement is that it can be made of a number\r\nof different kinds of earth, to be found in many different parts\r\nof the world, and makes a far stronger rock. It sets more slowly\r\nthan natural or hydraulic cement, but is more satisfactory for use\r\nin reinforced concrete work. In the Lehigh Valley, where about two\r\nthirds of the Portland cement used in the United States is made,\r\nthe raw material is a rock, called cement rock, and limestone. In\r\nNew York State they make Portland cement of limestone and clay;\r\nin the Middle West they make it of marl and clay, while in other\r\nWestern States they make it of chalk and clay. In Europe slag is\r\nsometimes used. The artificial product contains lime oxide, silica,\r\nalumina, iron oxide, and other minerals in varying quantities, but\r\nthe necessary ones are silica, alumina, and lime. In making Portland\r\ncement the raw material is ground into a fine powder and poured into\r\none end of a long cylindrical kiln which looks like a smokestack\r\nlying on its side. Powdered coal is shot into the kiln, where it is\r\nkept burning, at a heat of about 2,500 to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\nAfter the raw material has been burned thoroughly and is taken from\r\nthe kiln it looks like little cinders or clinkers about the size of\r\nmarbles. The cement clinker is then cooled and ground to a powder,\r\nafter which it is stored away for a little while to season.\r\n\r\nThe first Portland cement ever made in the United States was turned\r\nout by David O. Saylor, of Coplay, Pa., in 1875, but the development\r\nof the new industry was very slow, as builders and engineers seemed\r\nto be blind to the great possibilities of the material that built\r\nImperial Rome. In 1890, nearly twenty years after the process was\r\nintroduced in America, only 335,500 barrels of Portland cement were\r\nmanufactured in this country. The country woke up to the situation a\r\nfew years later, and in 1905 there were manufactured in the United\r\nStates 35,246,812 barrels of Portland cement. In 1911 the industry\r\nturned out the stupendous total of 77,877,236 barrels.\r\n\r\nThis was because the age of concrete had dawned on the world and man\r\nhad learned in those years that by mixing gravel and sand with cement\r\nhe could make a material cheaper, more easily handled, and far more\r\nlasting than wood, brick or some stone.\r\n\r\nAs Edison once said to some of his associates:\r\n\r\n\"I think the age of concrete has started, and I believe I can prove\r\nthat the most beautiful houses that our architects can conceive\r\ncan be cast in one operation in iron forms at a cost, which, by\r\ncomparison with present methods, will be surprising. Then even the\r\npoorest man among us will be enabled to own a home of his own--a home\r\nthat will last for centuries with no cost for insurance or repairs,\r\nand be as exchangeable for other property as a United States bond.\"\r\n\r\nThe technical definition of concrete is as follows: \"Concrete is\r\na species of artificial stone formed by mixing cement mortar with\r\nbroken stone or gravel. Cement is the active element called the\r\n_matrix_ and the sand and stone forms the body of the mixture called\r\nthe _aggregate_.\"\r\n\r\nThe ingredients are mixed in different proportions for different\r\nwork. A common proportion is 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 5\r\nparts broken stone or gravel. Cement users speak of this as a \"1:\r\n2: 5 mixture.\" Sometimes the gravel is left out and a mixture of 1\r\npart cement to 3 or 4 parts sand is made. The cement binds the mass\r\ntogether and sand fills up any little vacant spaces about the gravel,\r\nmaking what is called a dense mixture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SILENT KNIGHT MOTOR\r\n\r\n  Two views of the latest automobile engine. At the top can be seen\r\n  the sliding sleeves, the inlets and outlets which do away with\r\n  valves]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A PORTABLE ARMY WIRELESS OUTFIT\r\n\r\n  The Signal Service is rapidly increasing its wireless equipment\r\n  for use on land.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE WIRELESS IN THE NAVY\r\n\r\n  Practically all of Uncle Sam's warships and Navy Yards now are\r\n  equipped with wireless, and a regular navy wireless operators'\r\n  school is maintained at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.]\r\n\r\nFrom the use of concrete it was only a short step to reinforced\r\nconcrete, or, concrete braced on the inside with iron or steel rods.\r\nIt is sometimes called concrete steel, ferro-concrete, and armoured\r\nconcrete. If we asked an engineer the idea in using reinforced\r\nconcrete he might say to us that the steel when imbedded, united so\r\nclosely with the concrete as to form one single mass of very great\r\nstrength. Steel rods add to the _tensile_ strength of concrete which\r\nalone has a tremendous strength under _compression_. In other words,\r\nsteel does not break nor stretch easily; that is, it has great\r\ntensile strength. Concrete has great strength under compression;\r\nthat is, it will hold up an enormous weight without crushing. Thus,\r\na concrete beam alone might crack on the bottom, because it has not\r\nas great tensile strength as steel. But, if we put steel rods into a\r\nconcrete mould, an inch or so from the bottom, turn out a reinforced\r\nconcrete beam, for instance, and place it in the building, with the\r\nreinforcement at the bottom, we use a beam in which the strength\r\nof the concrete and iron is combined. Thus, when a great weight is\r\nplaced on the top of the beam the concrete resists the compression\r\nof the weight, and the reinforcement at the bottom, by its tensile\r\nstrength, prevents the beam from cracking where the strain of the\r\nweight is greatest.\r\n\r\nThat is what the engineer might tell us is the theory of reinforced\r\nconcrete, and the practice requires the highest engineering skill\r\nand technical knowledge, but in the simplest terms, it is concrete,\r\nbraced by an imbedded skeleton of steel. In actual practice the\r\nreinforcing rods run both ways, or diagonally, just as the engineers\r\ndecide it is necessary to resist the particular kind of stress that\r\nthe wall or beam must withstand.\r\n\r\nReinforced concrete was first used, so far as known, by M. Lambot,\r\nwho exhibited a small rowboat made of that material at the World's\r\nFair in Paris, in 1855. The sides and bottom of the boat were 1-1/2\r\ninches thick, with reinforcement of steel wires. The boat is still\r\nin use at Merval, France. F. Joseph Monier, however, is called the\r\n\"father of reinforced concrete,\" as he took out the first patent on\r\nit in France in 1865. Monier was a gardener and had experimented with\r\nlarge urns for flowers and shrubs. He wanted to make his pots lighter\r\nbut just as strong, so he tried making some of concrete with a wire\r\nnetting imbedded in the material. But even then the world did not\r\nrealize that his accomplishment was more important to mankind than a\r\ngreat many of the wars that had been fought, and little was done with\r\nconcrete as a building material until the Germans developed it.\r\n\r\nReinforced concrete was not used in the United States, according to\r\nthe best records, until 1875, when W. E. Ward, without having studied\r\nthe subject very carefully, built himself a house of it, in Port\r\nChester, N. Y. He made the whole thing, including foundation, outside\r\nwalls, cornices, towers, and roof of reinforced concrete, placing\r\nthe steel rods where his own good judgment told him they would do\r\nthe most good. About this time the Ransome Cement Company began to\r\nuse the material for building, and put up a great many strong and\r\nbeautiful structures, still to be seen in California and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFinally, bit by bit, in the face of opposition of all kinds,\r\nreinforced concrete came to be recognized by architects, engineers,\r\nand builders as one of the best materials for certain kinds of work.\r\nTo-day we find that most of the predictions of the early enthusiasts\r\nhave been fulfilled and that the age of concrete has dawned. That it\r\nwill be used even more extensively in the future, as men learn more\r\nand more about this wonderful artificial stone, is certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE LATEST AUTOMOBILE ENGINE\r\n\r\n   OUR BOY FRIEND AND THE SCIENTIST LOOK OVER THE FIELD OF GASOLINE\r\n   ENGINES AND SEE SOME BIG IMPROVEMENTS OVER THOSE OF A FEW YEARS\r\n   AGO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we are following the conversations of the scientist and his\r\nyoung friend about new inventions, we must not overlook some of their\r\nmost interesting times in keeping abreast of the vast improvements\r\nthat are being made every year--almost every day--in the inventions\r\nof a dozen years ago.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there is the gas engine. Ten years ago it was a very\r\nimperfect machine, as every boy who has heard the old jokes about\r\n\"auto-go-but doesn't,\" \"get a horse,\" etc., will remember.\r\n\r\nThen there is the wireless telegraph. No invention of recent years\r\nhas shown a more remarkable development than that of Guglielmo\r\nMarconi for sending messages without wires.\r\n\r\nBut these are only a few of the things that the two friends talked\r\nabout. They looked into the wonderful advancement in the art of\r\nphotography about which every boy knows something, and they\r\ninvestigated the latest achievements of science in electric lighting.\r\nTen years is a very short time, even in this fast moving age of ours,\r\nand we shall see that many inventions made years ago are still being\r\nworked upon by the original inventors and others.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us see a few of the ways the gas engine has been improved,\r\nfor we are all more or less familiar with it in automobiles, motor\r\nboats, or the hundred and one other places that it has become an\r\ninvaluable aid to man in carrying on the world's work.\r\n\r\nOur young friend brought up the subject one day when he asked the\r\nscientist for a few pointers on getting better results with his\r\nmotor-boat engine.\r\n\r\n\"We will look it over together,\" said the man. \"Of course you\r\nknow that every gasoline engine has its own peculiarities, and\r\ncrankinesses, so it's hard to tell just what's the matter with one\r\nuntil you see it. I don't know very much about them; I wish I knew\r\nmore, but I have been talking with my automobile friends a good deal\r\nlately about the new motor invented by Charles Y. Knight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" replied the boy, \"it is called the 'Silent Knight'\r\nmotor because it doesn't make any noise, and it is used on a great\r\nmany high-priced automobiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. If you like we will go and have one of these engines\r\nexplained to us. At any rate the automobile man can tell you more\r\nabout your motor-boat engine than I can.\"\r\n\r\nThe expedition was made shortly after the conversation. \"You\r\nunderstand, of course,\" said the scientist on the way, \"that the\r\nKnight motor represents only one of the many, many improvements in\r\nthe gas engine, but it is what we call a fundamental improvement, as\r\nit is a development in the main idea of the gasoline motor, rather\r\nthan merely an improvement of one of the parts. Most of the evolution\r\nof gas engines has consisted merely of the improvement and perfection\r\nof the various parts for more power, and more all around efficiency.\r\n\r\n\"You remember what you found out about gasoline motors in general\r\nwhen we were spending so much time talking about aeroplanes. The high\r\nspeed motor, as we know it now, was invented, you know, by Gottlieb\r\nDaimler, a German inventor, in 1885, and with the ordinary four-cycle\r\nengine it takes four trips, or two round trips of the piston rod,\r\nto exert one push on the crankshaft of the engine. In other words,\r\nthe explosion drives down the piston giving the power, and on its\r\nreturn trip the piston forces out the burned fumes. On the next\r\ndownward stroke the fresh vapour is sucked into the cylinder and on\r\nthe fourth trip, or second upward trip, the gas is compressed for\r\nthe explosion. The carbureter on your motor-boat engine, and all\r\nothers, as you know, is the device that mixes the gasoline with air\r\nand converts it into a highly explosive gas, and the sparking system\r\nis the electrical device that ignites the gas in the cylinders for\r\neach explosion which makes the 'pop, pop, pop' so familiar with all\r\ngasoline engines.\r\n\r\n\"In the old gas engines the ignition was derived from a few dry-cell\r\nbatteries and some sort of a transformer coil, whereas nowadays the\r\nmagneto takes care of this work. As you know there are many kinds\r\nof magnetos, and inventors have spent years working out better and\r\nbetter ones. Also, in the old style motors the carbureter was more\r\nor less of a makeshift, with a drip feed arrangement, and a hand\r\nregulating shutter for admitting the air. Now a special automatic\r\ndevice regulates this, so that it is no longer a toss up whether\r\nthe gas is mixed in the proper quantities or not. Then, too, the\r\noiling systems have been improved, so that the function is done\r\nautomatically. In short, the motor has been made a perfectly reliable\r\nservant instead of a very capricious plaything.\r\n\r\n\"All these improvements made no fundamental change in the valves\r\nthrough which the gas was admitted to the cylinders, and the\r\nexhausted vapours expelled--and from your own experience you know\r\nthat you are just about as apt to have trouble with your valves as\r\nwith any other part of your machine.\r\n\r\n\"It is in these valves that the Knight motor departs from the usual\r\nstyle, and by this it eliminates the well-known 'pop, pop, pop' by\r\nwhich gas engines have been known all over the world.\"\r\n\r\nAs they looked over the engine, an expert in gasoline motors\r\nexplained all the parts of the \"Silent Knight\" and showed the\r\nscientist and his boy friend just how the machine worked.\r\n\r\nHe said that the only big difference between the Knight motor and\r\nother standard makes of engines is that the Knight substitutes for\r\nthe intake and exhaust valves an entirely new device composed of two\r\ncylinders, one within the other, sliding upon each other so as to\r\nregulate the flow of gas and the exhaust of fumes.\r\n\r\nEarly in his career as an inventor, while living in his home city of\r\nChicago, Knight decided that gasoline engines had entirely too many\r\nparts--that they were too complicated--and he set about trying to\r\nsimplify them. For one thing, he made a careful study of valves, and\r\ncollected a specimen of every kind known to mechanics. The sliding\r\nlocomotive valve seemed to him to hold the greatest possibilities for\r\nhis work, and he began a series of experiments with sliding valves\r\nuntil he finally brought out his first engine in 1902.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, Knight's work was not recognized in his own\r\ncountry until after he had gone to Europe, where his engine was\r\ntaken up by some of the biggest automobile manufacturers of England,\r\nFrance, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. After that it was taken up in\r\nthe United States, and only now is coming to be generally known. The\r\ninventor now lives in England, where he was first successful, and he\r\nis still at work on improvements of his engine.\r\n\r\nThe motor expert went on to explain that the advantage of the Knight\r\nmotor lay in the fact that the two sleeves or cylinders, which go\r\nto make up the combustion chamber or engine cylinder, sliding up\r\nand down upon one another, give a silent, vibrationless movement,\r\nas against the noisy action of the old style poppet or spring valve\r\nmotors.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" interrupted the boy, \"there are lots of other engines that run\r\nwithout making a noise nowadays.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" the man answered, \"but most of them run quietly only\r\nwhen at low speed, or stationary. When they begin to hit the high\r\nplaces the noise of the poppet valves is very noticeable. A few years\r\nago, when most engine builders were satisfied to make motors that\r\nwould run, regardless of noise, they paid no attention to some of the\r\nfiner mechanical problems, but since they have become more skilful,\r\nthey are cutting down on the noise. But, as I say, the explosions\r\nare plainly heard when these engines are running at high speed. With\r\nthe 'Silent Knight' the only noise is that of the fan and magneto,\r\nwhether at low speed or the very fastest the motor can run. There can\r\nbe no noise, for there is nothing for the sleeves to strike against.\"\r\n\r\nThe expert then went on to explain the motor in detail. The\r\ncombustion chambers of the four or six-cylinder \"Silent Knight,\" he\r\nexplained, are made up of two concentric cylinders or sleeves, or, in\r\nother words, one cylinder within another. There is only the smallest\r\nfraction of an inch between them, and as they are well oiled by an\r\nautomatic lubricating device they slide up and down upon each other\r\nwith perfect ease. Of course the sleeves, which are made of Swedish\r\niron, a very fine material for cylinder construction, are machined\r\ndown inside and out so that they are perfectly smooth to run upon\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe two sleeves which go to make up one cylinder work up and down\r\nupon each other by means of a small connecting rod affixed to the\r\nbottom of each sleeve connected to an eccentric rod, which is driven\r\nby a noiseless chain from the engine shaft.\r\n\r\nThe most important features are the slots cut in each side, and close\r\nto the upper end of each sleeve, so that, as the sleeves move upon\r\none another the slot in the right-hand side of the inner one will\r\npass the slot of the right-hand side of the outer sleeve, and also\r\nthe same with the left-hand side.\r\n\r\nThen when the left-hand slots of the outer sleeve open upon, or come\r\ninto register with the left-hand slots of the inner sleeve, a passage\r\ninto the cylinder is opened for the new gas to enter. When a charge\r\nof gas has been drawn into the cylinder, one sleeve rises while the\r\nother falls, so that the openings are separated and the passage is\r\ntightly closed. The compression stroke then begins with the piston\r\nrising to the top. At this juncture the igniting spark explodes\r\nthe compressed gas and the downward or power stroke takes place.\r\nDuring the upward compression stroke and the downward impulse stroke\r\nthe slots have been closed, allowing no opportunity for the gas to\r\nescape. When the explosion has taken place and the piston has been\r\ndriven to the bottom of its stroke, the right-hand openings in the\r\ninner sleeve and those of the outer sleeve come together, providing a\r\npassage for the exhausted gases to escape with the fourth or exhaust\r\nstroke. Thus it is plain that the motor is of the four-cycle type and\r\nit should not be confounded with two-cycle motors.\r\n\r\nAs the expert explained the motion he showed how it was carried out\r\non an engine from which the casing had been partly removed. The\r\ncareful mechanical adjustment of the eccentric shaft, which operated\r\nthe connecting rods that pull the sleeves of the cylinder up and\r\ndown so that the openings for the entrance of the fresh gas and the\r\nexpulsion of the exploded fumes come together at just the proper\r\nsecond, was what took the boy's eye.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this the scientist handed the boy a magazine\r\nto read. It was a copy of the _Motor Age_ in which an expert said\r\neditorially:\r\n\r\n   \"Those who pin their faith to the slide-valve motor do so for\r\n   many reasons, chief of which is that with this motor there is a\r\n   definite opening and closing of the intake and exhaust parts, no\r\n   matter at what motor speeds the car be operating. Two years ago\r\n   one of the leading American engineers experimented with poppet\r\n   valves and discovered that frequently at the high speeds the\r\n   exhaust valves did not shut, there not being sufficient time\r\n   owing to the inability of the valve spring to close the valve in\r\n   the interval before a cam returned to open it again. With such a\r\n   condition it is certain that the most powerful mixture was not\r\n   obtained. With the sleeve valve such failure of operation cannot\r\n   be, because no matter how fast the motor is operating there is a\r\n   definite opening and closing for both intake and exhaust valve.\r\n\r\n   \"It is a well-known fact that with poppet valves the tension\r\n   of the springs on the exhaust side varies after five or six\r\n   weeks' use, and consequently the accuracy of opening and\r\n   closing is interfered with. Carbon gets on the valve seatings\r\n   and prevents proper closing of the valve, with the result that\r\n   the compression is interfered with and the face of the valve\r\n   injured. These troubles are, as far as can be learned, obviated\r\n   in the sleeve valve.\"\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Knight motor claim that it is simpler than the\r\nordinary types of engines, having about one third less parts, that it\r\nis economic, powerful, and, as previously pointed out, runs silently.\r\nBeside these advantages, there are claimed for it many technical\r\nvirtues that we need not enter into here.\r\n\r\nThe lubricating system of the Knight motors is another interesting\r\npoint, as it serves to illustrate one more way in which the gasoline\r\nengine has been improved upon of late years. The manner of oiling\r\nused is known as the \"movable dam\" system. Located transversely\r\nbeneath the six connecting rods are six oil troughs hinged on a shaft\r\nconnected with the throttle. With the opening and closing of the\r\nthrottle these troughs are automatically raised and lowered. When the\r\nthrottle is opened, which raises the troughs, the points on the ends\r\nof the connecting rods dip deep into the oil and create a splashing\r\nof oil on the lower ends of the sliding sleeves. These sleeves are\r\ngrooved circularly on their outer surfaces in order to distribute the\r\noil evenly, while toward the lower ends holes are drilled to allow\r\nfor the passage of oil.\r\n\r\nWhen the motor is throttled down, which lowers the troughs, the\r\npoints barely dip into the oil and a corresponding less amount of oil\r\nis splashed. An oil pump keeps the troughs constantly overflowing.\r\n\r\nThe motor is cooled by a complete system of water jackets, and it is\r\nfitted with a double ignition system, each independent of the other.\r\n\r\nOf course in the adoption of the sliding sleeve type, mushroom\r\nvalves, cams, cam rollers, cam shafts, valve springs, and train of\r\nfront engine gears all are eliminated, the sliding parts fulfilling\r\ntheir various functions.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Knight ever achieved success with his motor it was\r\nsubjected to some of the severest tests on record in the whole\r\nautomobile industry. In France, Germany, and England, it was only\r\naccepted by the leading manufacturers after being tried out for\r\nperiods extending over several months of the hardest kind of usage.\r\nNow, that it has proven itself a practical success, automobile men\r\ndeclare that the sliding valve principle, never before applied to\r\ngas engines until Knight began work, will undoubtedly have a lasting\r\neffect on the whole industry.\r\n\r\nThe compact little two-cycle motors represent another big fundamental\r\ndevelopment in the field of gas engines. There are many different\r\nmakes of two-cycle motors, of course, and all have their various\r\nmerits. They are used in practically all the work for which gas\r\nengines are employed, including automobiles, motor boats, and\r\naeroplanes. It will not be necessary to describe these engines\r\nfurther than to say that the name describes the fundamental\r\ndifference between them and the four-cycle motors. Instead of the\r\npiston making four strokes for every explosion--that is, an, upward\r\nstroke to clean out the burnt vapours, a downward stroke to suck\r\nin the fresh gas, an upward stroke to compress it, and finally the\r\ndownward explosion or power stroke, all this work is done in two\r\nstrokes.\r\n\r\nFor the general development of the gasoline engine, it is only\r\nnecessary for a boy to look about him. Everywhere motors built on\r\nthe same ideas as laid down in earlier inventions, but improved in\r\nevery detail, are in use. Not only do we see them on fine pleasure\r\nautomobiles, motor boats, and aeroplanes, but on our biggest trucks,\r\nfire engines, and in business establishments where light machinery is\r\nto be run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH UP TO THE MINUTE\r\n\r\n   THE SCIENTIST TALKS OF AMATEUR WIRELESS OPERATORS--THE GREAT\r\n   DEVELOPMENT OF WIRELESS THAT HAS ENABLED IT TO SAVE ABOUT THREE\r\n   THOUSAND LIVES--LONG DISTANCE WORK OF THE MODERN INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the inspiring stories of Jack Binns of the steamship\r\n_Republic_, and of J. G. Phillips and Harold S. Bride of the\r\nill-fated _Titanic_ are fresh in our minds, it is not necessary\r\nto say that within the last few years the wireless telegraph has\r\nestablished itself as indispensable to the safe navigation of the\r\nseas. The story of its development is a marvellous one when we\r\nthink that it was only in December of 1901 that Marconi received\r\nthe first signal ever transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean without\r\nwires. Now, as every boy knows, all the big steamships are equipped\r\nwith wireless, all the governments of the world operate their own\r\nstations to communicate with their warships, at sea, and thousands\r\nupon thousands of boy amateurs operate their own little plants with\r\ncomplete success.\r\n\r\nMore wonderful still is the story when we think that by the use of\r\nthis invention a total of about three thousand persons have been\r\nsaved from death in shipwrecks. Nowhere in the pages of all history\r\nare there any more thrilling stories of heroism and devotion to duty\r\nthan those of the men who, in the face of death themselves, have\r\nstuck by their keys sending out over the waves the \"C. Q. D.\" and the\r\n\"S. O. S.\" signals, which as every boy knows are the wireless calls\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\nThe scientist and his boy friend never tired of talking of these\r\nthings, for the young man was one of the many amateurs who had\r\nmastered the art, so that many a night as he sat at his receiver he\r\ncaught the messages of steamships far out on the broad Atlantic, and\r\nheard the Navy Yard station transmitting orders to Uncle Sam's ships\r\nat sea.\r\n\r\nOne day shortly after the _Titanic_ disaster the boy said to his\r\nfriend: \"I saw by the paper to-day that they are talking of passing a\r\nlaw to prevent the amateur wireless operators from working. I don't\r\nthink they ought to do that. I'm sure most amateurs never interfere\r\nwith any signals, as was said they did in connection with the\r\nmessages to and from ships that went to the rescue of the _Titanic_.\"\r\n\r\n\"So long as the amateurs do not have powerful sending apparatus,\"\r\nanswered the scientist, \"I don't think they will make any serious\r\ntrouble, for it makes no confusion to have them 'listening in'\r\non the passing radiographs. Of course with a powerful sender a\r\nmischievous person could work irreparable damage by sending fake\r\nmessages of one kind or another. In fact there have been several\r\ninstances of messages that were thought to be fakes, but I am sure no\r\nboy with the intelligence to rig up a wireless outfit, would be so\r\nlacking in understanding of his responsibilities as to try to confuse\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\n\"But it would be a shame to stop the amateurs altogether,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"for, no matter what the companies may say, the wireless\r\ntelegraph is still in an experimental stage, and we must look to the\r\nbright boys who are studying it now, for its greatest development.\r\nThe marvellous strides in improving the apparatus, and solving the\r\nmysteries of electro-magnetic currents, that have been made in the\r\nlast dozen years, should be eclipsed in the next decade, if young\r\nmen with some practical experience and a desire to get at the real\r\nscientific basis of the art, work at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are some of the main improvements of the last few years?\" asked\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\nFor answer, the scientist and the boy made a journey down to the\r\nsteamship docks, and visited the wireless cabins of several of the\r\nbig transatlantic liners. They also went to the Brooklyn Navy Yard,\r\nwhere there is a wireless school, that turns out Navy operators after\r\na thorough course in all the various branches of the art. While on\r\nvacations to the seashore, the youth had visited some of the big\r\nhigh-power stations that send and receive messages to and from the\r\nships at sea.\r\n\r\nIn talking to the operators and electricians the boy learned much\r\nabout the wide extent to which wireless is used nowadays. The law\r\npassed by Congress in the United States in 1911, making it necessary\r\nfor every passenger steamer sailing from American ports with fifty\r\nor more passengers, to carry a wireless outfit capable of working\r\nat least 100 miles, in charge of a licensed operator, capable of\r\ntransmitting 20 or more words a minute, did a great deal to increase\r\nthe use of wireless. Also, not only the actions of one government but\r\nthe concerted action of all the civilized nations represented at the\r\nvarious international wireless conferences have brought it to the\r\nofficial notice of the whole world.\r\n\r\nThus it has become a commercial reality on the sea, and the Great\r\nLakes, and also it has become a big factor in war. All of the\r\nnations, besides having their warships equipped with wireless, now\r\nhave wireless squads in the army, and have small compact apparatus\r\nthat can be transported in small wagons, or even on horses' backs.\r\nThese portable army wireless outfits are very valuable for the\r\ncommunication between detachments of an army, particularly in\r\nplaces where there are few disturbing elements to intercept the\r\nelectro-magnetic waves.\r\n\r\nIn the recent campaign in Tripoli, in the war between Italy and\r\nTurkey, the wireless was extensively used by the Italian army in the\r\nfield, and it was found that the messages radiated over the desert\r\njust about as well as over the sea. Of course as will be seen later,\r\nit is not meant here to convey the idea that wireless cannot be sent\r\nover the land, for the electro-magnetic waves travel through the\r\nether in every direction, and as the ether fills the whole universe,\r\nmountains, buildings, or water just as well as the air, the waves\r\nare thought to go through obstacles as well as over water. The\r\ndifficulty in sending over land, is that there are various electrical\r\ndisturbances that intercept and confuse the wireless waves. In other\r\nwords, wireless works through mere physical obstructions without\r\nany difficulty, just so long as certain little known electrical\r\ndisturbances do not interfere. Just think of the thousands and\r\nthousands of wireless messages that are passing through the ether\r\nevery hour of the day and night. And yet the scientists really know\r\nvery little about the laws that govern them!\r\n\r\nOne of the instances of the strange antics of wireless was told\r\nto the boy by an operator who had been in charge of the wireless\r\noutfit on a Hudson River boat. He said that he and the operators on\r\nthe other boats were able to communicate with a station on shore\r\nuntil they had passed the Poughkeepsie bridge, and the great steel\r\nand stone structure stretched between the boat and the station.\r\nImmediately communication stopped short and all efforts failed to\r\nget any response. A series of experiments proved that the obstruction\r\nwas at the bridge, but whether it was some electrical property in\r\nthe bridge itself, or in the hills on each side of the bridge, they\r\nhave never been able to find out, and the land station was finally\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nThis is just an instance of what the scientists do _not_ know about\r\nwireless, but it shows the many boy amateurs that there are still\r\nworlds for them to conquer in scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe central principle upon which the wireless telegraph works now is\r\nthe same as it was when Marconi, through his marvellous invention,\r\nfirst received a signal from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nbut the inventors have learned much more about the details of the\r\ntheory and it is in the improvement of devices for applying these\r\nlaws of electricity that the development has been, rather than in the\r\ndiscovery of new theories. Nikola Tesla's invention for the wireless\r\ntransmission of power by earth waves is a revolutionary departure\r\nfrom the usual wireless practice, but as we saw in the earlier\r\nchapter on this subject the Tesla invention has not yet been put in\r\npractical operation.\r\n\r\nThough Guglielmo Marconi did not discover the laws of electricity\r\nupon which his invention is based, to him belongs all the credit\r\nfor making use of the discoveries of the scientists of his day, and\r\nworking out from them a practical system of wireless communication.\r\n\r\nAs many boys know, the wireless telegraph is possible through the\r\nradiation of electric waves. For instance, if a stone is thrown into\r\na pool waves are started out in every direction from the point where\r\nthe water is disturbed. The water does not move except up and down,\r\nand yet the waves pass on until they reach the side of the pool, or\r\ntheir force is expended.\r\n\r\nThe scientists before Marconi found out that when an electric spark\r\nwas made to jump between two magnetic poles it started electric waves\r\nin every direction, much like the stone thrown into the pool, except\r\nat a speed that is reckoned at 186,000 miles per second.\r\n\r\nProf. Amos Dolbear, of Tufts College, Massachusetts, first made\r\nuse of these waves in 1880, and a few years later Doctor Hertz,\r\nconducting experiments along the same lines, discovered them. Since\r\nthat time these waves have been called Hertzian waves.\r\n\r\nFor many years scientists had understood that electrical waves or\r\nvibrations travelled through the ether in a copper wire, and that\r\ngave us telegraphy by wires, but it was a new thing to think of the\r\nwaves travelling in every direction through space without wires.\r\nThese early investigators found out that they could detect these\r\nwaves by a device called a Hertzian loop, which was simply a copper\r\nwire bent into a hoop with the two ends close together but not\r\ntouching. A spark would appear between the ends of the wire when the\r\nelectric waves were sent out.\r\n\r\nMarconi began his work where these scientists left off, as a very\r\nyoung man on his father's farm in Italy, but soon went to England, of\r\nwhich country his mother was a native, and placed the results of his\r\nexperiments before the government authorities. Continuing his labors\r\nhe soon had his wireless apparatus worked out in the form in which it\r\nfirst became known to the world.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a transmitter, receiving machine or detector, and a\r\nset of antennæ or aerial wires from which the electrical waves were\r\nsent. For his transmitter, he created a spark between the two brass\r\nknobs on the ends of two thick brass wires by closing and opening an\r\nelectrical circuit with a key, very much like, but somewhat larger\r\nthan the regulation telegraph key. The space between the knobs was\r\ncalled the spark gap. For a dash he would hold down his key and\r\nmake a large spark, and for a dot he would release his key quickly\r\nand make only a short one. Thus, he could send the regular Morse or\r\nContinental telegraphic codes of dots and dashes. These impulses were\r\ntransmitted by wires to the aerial wires, or antennæ. The impulses\r\nleft the antennæ as electro-magnetic waves, and went forth in all\r\ndirections, only to be caught on the antennæ of another station\r\naboard a ship or on land.\r\n\r\nHere is where the receiver did its work, and the problem was a far\r\nmore difficult one than the working out of the transmitter, for the\r\nwaves as received were too weak in themselves to register a dot\r\nor a dash. In Marconi's first instruments he used a device called\r\nthe \"coherer.\" This was a glass tube about as big around as a lead\r\npencil, and perhaps two inches long. It was plugged at each end with\r\nsilver, and the narrow space between the plugs was filled with finely\r\npowdered fragments of nickel and silver, which possess the strange\r\nproperty of being alternately very good and very bad electrical\r\nconductors. The waves in Marconi's first experiments were received\r\non a suspended kite wire, exactly similar to the wire used in the\r\ntransmitter, but they were so weak that they could not of themselves\r\noperate an ordinary telegraph instrument. They possessed strength\r\nenough, however, to draw the little particles of silver and nickel\r\nin the coherer together in a continuous metal path. In other words,\r\nthey made these particles \"cohere,\" and the moment they cohered they\r\nbecame a good conductor for electricity, and a current from a battery\r\nnear at hand rushed through the connection, operated the Morse\r\ninstrument, and caused it to print a dot or a dash; then a little\r\ntapper, actuated by the same current, struck against the coherer, the\r\nparticles of metal were broken apart, becoming a poor conductor, and\r\ncutting off the current from the home battery.\r\n\r\nIn Marconi's early experiments there was little or no attempt at\r\ntuning the instruments for waves of certain lengths, but this art has\r\nbeen developed to a high state in modern wireless telegraphy and we\r\nshall see how the operator tunes his instruments to talk to any one\r\nspecial station.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of the modern wireless transmitter, now\r\nfamiliar to every boy who has ever taken a trip aboard a large ship,\r\nor attended an electrical show, as it was in the old days, is the\r\n\"crack, crack, cr-r-r-ack, crack\" of the spark as it flickers between\r\nthe brass knobs of the instrument, as the operator pounds away at\r\nhis key. In some of the great high-power land stations, where long\r\ndistance work is done the crash of the spark is like that of thunder,\r\nthe flame is as big around as a man's wrist and of such intensity\r\nthat it could not be looked at with unshaded eyes. On ships where the\r\ncrash is too loud it has become necessary to cover the spark gap with\r\na wooden muffler so as to deaden the noise.\r\n\r\nWhile the simple spark gap of the early Marconi instruments was\r\nenough to send out the Hertzian waves, the modern transmitter is a\r\nmarvel of electrical construction utilizing as it does the latest\r\ndiscoveries in electrical apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable difference in the sending apparatus is in the\r\narrangement of the two wires between which the spark flies. In the\r\nearly instruments the wires were set in a horizontal line, and\r\nconnected to an induction coil, but in the later ones the oscillator\r\nwas turned up lengthwise with the spark gap between the vertical\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe different position of the spark gap is a change only in form, and\r\nnot in principle. In the Marconi apparatus used nowadays the current\r\ncomes from a dynamo of more than 110 volts, direct current. The two\r\nterminals of the circuit are connected with an induction coil, and\r\nfrom there to the two ends of the wires, making the terminals of the\r\nspark gap. The upper wire runs from the spark gap to the aerial,\r\nand the lower runs through a battery of Leyden jars, through a high\r\ntension transformer (as does the other side of the circuit), and\r\nthence to the ground. Aboard ship the ground connection is simply\r\nmade by attaching a wire to the hull of the ship, which is in\r\nconnection with the water, the best possible earth connection.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARCONI TRANSMITTER LAYOUT\r\n\r\n    A--Key.\r\n    B--Induction coil.\r\n    C--Spark gap.\r\n    D--Dynamo.\r\n    E--Rheostat.\r\n    F--Interrupter magnet.\r\n    G--Aerial.\r\n    H--High tension transformer.\r\n    I--Ground wire.\r\n    K--Battery of Leyden jars.]\r\n\r\n  There are, of course, a great many different kinds of\r\n  transmitters, but they are all worked out on the same general\r\n  principle--a spark gap which creates electrical oscillations that\r\n  are sent into the ether from the aerials.\r\n\r\n  In some modern stations an alternating current is used at more\r\n  than 100 volts and is stepped up through a transformer to about\r\n  30,000 volts. This high power current then charges a condenser\r\n  consisting of a battery of Leyden jars.\r\n\r\n  When the operator presses his key he establishes a connection,\r\n  which immediately sets up electrical waves oscillating at a\r\n  rate of anywhere from 100,000 to 2,500,000 per second. These\r\n  oscillations are carried to the antennæ where they pass into the\r\n  ether and spread in all directions to be caught on the aerials of\r\n  all stations within range.\r\n\r\n  One of the improvements in wireless transmission which makes\r\n  long distance work possible aboard ships is the use of what the\r\n  engineers call \"coupled circuits.\" The arrangement consists\r\n  in connecting the aerial to an induction coil, and connecting\r\n  the latter with a ground wire. Another coil is placed close to\r\n  this and is connected with the spark gap, and a condenser. The\r\n  period of oscillation of the antennæ circuit, and of the spark\r\n  gap circuit are timed to be exactly the same. The two circuits\r\n  are then called \"coupled circuits,\" for while they are coupled\r\n  together by induction only, the oscillation or spark gap circuit\r\n  increases its capacity, and at the same time has a small spark\r\n  gap.\r\n\r\n  With these new devices for increasing the power of the\r\n  oscillations, or in other words throwing a bigger stone into the\r\n  pond, the electrical waves are sent out with far greater force,\r\n  just as the water waves are sent farther in the pond, and will\r\n  reach stations at a greater distance.\r\n\r\n  \"Crash, bang,\" goes the oscillator, and in less time than it\r\n  takes to think it the oscillations have reached the antennæ of\r\n  ships hundreds or thousands of miles away, or even those of\r\n  another land station on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n  The next thing is to understand the apparatus used for receiving\r\n  the faint electric waves transmitted through the ether, for the\r\n  modern instruments are far different from the old style \"coherer\"\r\n  explained before. As with the spark gaps, there are many\r\n  different styles of receiving devices, all known by the general\r\n  name of \"detectors,\" as they detect the faint electro-magnetic\r\n  waves radiating through the ether.\r\n\r\n  Some of the latest Marconi experiments show a return to the\r\n  \"coherer\" idea, very greatly improved upon, but the full details\r\n  of the device have not been made public.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of the New York Edison Co.\r\n\r\n  THE NAVY WIRELESS SCHOOL\r\n\r\n  At top is the class in sending, while below is shown the class\r\n  learning to receive messages.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN AMATEUR WIRELESS OUTFIT\r\n\r\n  Hundreds of boys are receiving and sending wireless messages with\r\n  far less efficient apparatus than that shown here.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARCONI DETECTOR LAYOUT\r\n\r\n    A--Aerial.\r\n    B--Condenser.\r\n    C--Glass tube oscillator transformer.\r\n    D--D´--Rollers.\r\n    E--E´--Iron wire passing through oscillator transformer.\r\n    F--F´--Magnets.\r\n    G--G´--Ground wires.\r\n    H--Telephone receiver.]\r\n\r\nOne of the detecting devices used by the Marconi system, after\r\nthe old-style \"coherer\" was done away with, was very simple\r\nindeed in comparison to the cohering and tapping machines. It\r\nwas made up of a small glass tube wound with copper wire. One\r\nend of this made the ground connection, and the other end led\r\nto the aerial, and also to an earth connection through a tuning\r\ninductance coil. Then another coil was wound around the first\r\none on the glass tube and connected with the head telephone\r\nreceivers which have taken the place of the Morse dot and dash\r\nprinting instrument in all the modern wireless instruments. Two\r\nmagnets were placed just above the glass tube, and a flexible\r\niron wire was made to move through it by means of a pair of\r\nrollers a little way from each end. When the electro-magnetic\r\nwaves reached the aerial and made oscillations in the first coil\r\nabout the glass tube, the magnetic intensity of the iron wire\r\nband was disturbed and the glass tube became an oscillation\r\ntransformer, setting up currents in the coil leading to the\r\ntelephone receivers. The impulses were manifested by ticks, just\r\nthe length of the dots and dashes being sent out by the operator\r\nperhaps thousands of miles away.\r\n\r\nAnother form of detector is the \"electrolytic\" which consists of\r\na very fine platinum wire about one ten-thousandth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, which dips into a platinum cup filled with nitric acid.\r\nWhen the invisible electro-magnetic waves impinge upon the wires\r\nof the receiving station, and cause electrical surges to take\r\nplace in those wires, they in turn affect the detector, giving an\r\nexact reproduction of the note of the transmitting spark at the\r\ndistant station.\r\n\r\nThis device has since been replaced by one of another type,\r\nequally sensitive and much better suited for general work on\r\naccount of its greater stability and freedom from atmospheric\r\ndisturbances. This detector consists simply of a crystal of\r\ncarborundum supported between two brass points. When connected to\r\nthe antennæ it is affected by the oscillations caused by distant\r\ntransmitting stations as previously stated. These wireless\r\nsignals are reproduced in telephone receivers.\r\n\r\nAnother frequently used detector known as the Audion is composed\r\nof a small incandescent lamp with filaments of carbon, tantalum,\r\nor preferably tungsten, and one or more sheets or wings of\r\nplatinum secured near the filaments. The lamp is lighted by a\r\nset of home batteries, and is connected with a ground wire, the\r\naerial, and the telephone receivers. The tungsten filament and\r\nthe platinum wing act as two electrodes, and the faint electric\r\noscillations received on the antennæ and transmitted to the\r\nplatinum plate are supposed to affect the discharge of negatively\r\nelectrified particles, or ions, between the two electrodes.\r\nThis affects the flow of the battery current, and consequently\r\nregisters the oscillations in the telephone receivers.\r\n\r\nBy diligent study of the subject the wireless experts also\r\nhave learned that the arrangement of the aerials is of great\r\nimportance, because much depends upon the send-off received by\r\nthe electrical oscillations. In Marconi's early experiments he\r\nused a single wire attached to a kite, then changed to a single\r\nwire stretched from the top of a high mast. Later, the system of\r\nstretching the wires horizontally between two masts, as we see\r\nthem so often aboard passenger steamships, and at land stations,\r\ncame into general use. The old idea that the height of the aerial\r\nwires had something to do with the efficiency of the apparatus\r\nhas passed, for science showed that the electro-magnetic waves\r\ntravelled in all directions irrespective of land, water,\r\nmountains, or buildings. Whether, in sending messages across the\r\nocean, they actually pass through the globe, or follow the curve\r\nof the surface, is more than the most careful wireless students\r\nhave been able to tell.\r\n\r\nAnother of the big improvements in wireless is in the tuning of\r\nthe instruments to certain wave lengths or rates of vibrations,\r\nand in controlling the wave lengths by the sender. Science has\r\nestablished that these waves usually vary from a few feet up\r\nto 12,000 feet or more. The ordinary wave lengths for ships\r\nis between 1,000 feet and 1,800 feet, but on the biggest land\r\nstations and the transatlantic liners the full 12,000 feet is\r\nused. Even greater lengths of waves are used by the big Marconi\r\nstations transmitting messages between Clifden, on the west coast\r\nof Ireland, and Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. The reason for this is\r\nthat with the same power messages can be sent greater distances\r\nwith long wave lengths than with shorter ones.\r\n\r\nThe wave length is controlled by an apparatus called the \"helix,\"\r\nwhich may be seen in the picture of the wireless outfit. It looks\r\nlike a drum wound with a spiral of copper tubing, and although\r\nit looks simple it presents some of the greatest problems in\r\nconnection with wireless.\r\n\r\nOn the receiving end is the instrument called the tuner, by which\r\nthe operator can adjust his detector to the wave lengths being\r\nsent out by the station with which he wishes to talk. There are\r\nvarious kinds of \"tuners,\" all more or less complicated. The\r\ndevice corresponds to the telephone exchange or the telegraph\r\nswitch-board. Of course a good receiving apparatus can be tuned\r\nso that the operator can listen to any messages going through\r\nthe ether, within range, but all messages that are intended to\r\nbe secret are sent in code, just as all wire and cable messages\r\nthat are secret are sent in code.\r\n\r\nIn line with the advent of wireless telegraphy it is fitting that\r\nwe should have the wireless telephone. While this instrument is\r\nstill in the experimental stage, some very promising results have\r\nbeen obtained. There are several experimental wireless telephone\r\nstations in New York City, but the best results are obtained when\r\nsome one keeps up a steady conversation, so it is far easier to\r\nconnect the reproducer of a phonograph to the transmitter of the\r\nwireless telephone. It is surprising how distinctly this music or\r\nspeech is received. In fact the ship operators nearing New York\r\nare often entertained by strains of music from these wireless\r\ntelephones. The wireless telephones employ what are known as\r\nundamped oscillations created by electric arcs, and it is very\r\neasy to \"tune out\" such vibrations for musical effects.\r\n\r\nJust as we have the motion-picture \"newspaper,\" we have the\r\nwireless newspaper published aboard the big transatlantic liners\r\nevery day. The news is sent out from certain land stations at\r\ncertain times in the day and night, and every ship within range\r\ncopies it, and publishes it just as our regular daily papers are\r\npublished. Of course, the paper is small, but it usually contains\r\nmost of the important news of the day, the big sporting items,\r\nsuch as baseball scores, and the stock quotations.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the great station at Wellfleet, Cape Cod,\r\nMass., sends out the press matter each night from dispatches\r\nprepared in the main offices of the big American press\r\nassociations. Ships as far as 1,600 miles distant frequently\r\nreceive this news matter, and by the time the ocean-going editor\r\nis ready to get out his next day's edition he is in touch with\r\nthe wireless press station on the other side, and is receiving\r\nthe world's news from the English coast.\r\n\r\nAs our young friend found out when he was gathering up all the\r\ninformation he could about aeroplanes, some success has been made\r\nin the equipment of the fliers with wireless. The project offers\r\nsome serious difficulties, however, as on an aeroplane there is\r\nno place for long aerials. Experiments have been tried with long\r\ntrailing wires, but these are dangerous to the aeroplane, and to\r\nuse the wires of the machine for antennæ endangers the operator\r\nto electric shocks. One scheme tried by several aviators in the\r\nUnited States with some success has been the stringing of aerials\r\nin the rear framework.\r\n\r\nThe problem of equipping balloons and airships with wireless is\r\nmuch simpler because it allows of long trailing wires to act as\r\nthe antennæ. Most boys will remember the success of the wireless\r\napparatus that was set up on the _America_ at the time Walter\r\nWellman made his famous attempt to cross the Atlantic in his\r\nairship.\r\n\r\nThat wireless will take its place as one of the great forces in\r\ncivilization is the idea of Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of\r\nthe wireless telegraph, expressed when he was in New York in the\r\nspring of 1912.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" he said, \"that in the near future a wireless message\r\nwill be sent from New York completely round the globe with no\r\nrelaying, and will be received by an instrument located in the\r\nsame office as the transmitter, in perhaps even less time than\r\nShakespeare's forty minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Most messages across the Atlantic will probably go by wireless\r\nat a comparatively early date. In time of war wireless\r\nconnections will be invaluable. The enemy can cut cables and\r\ntelegraph wires; but it is difficult seriously to damage the\r\nwireless service. The British Empire has realized this, and is\r\nalready equipping many of its outposts with wireless stations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMORE MARVELS OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\n   COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, THE TUNGSTEN ELECTRIC LAMP, THE PULMOTOR,\r\n   AND OTHER NEW INVENTIONS INVESTIGATED BY OUR BOY FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we leave our good friend the scientist and his young\r\ncompanion, let us go over a few more of the things about which\r\nthey talked. To take up all of them would be to prolong this book\r\nindefinitely, for the boy's mind was ever unfolding to the new things\r\nof the world and with each subject mastered, or at least partially\r\nunderstood, he was anxious to go on to the next. Not that he did not\r\nhave his special hobbies upon which he spent most of his time, for he\r\ndid, but that did not prevent his inquiring young mind from reaching\r\nout for new and more wonderful things once he had come to realize the\r\nworld of marvels in which we live.\r\n\r\nOne of this youth's favourite pastimes was photography, and as an\r\namateur his work had attracted considerable attention from his\r\nfriends. One day in the summer, when all the trees, shrubs, and\r\nflowers were at the height of their beauty, he came into the\r\nlaboratory where his scientific friend was working over an experiment.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of a process of colour photography,\" he said, \"and I\r\nwonder if I couldn't make use of it to get some good pictures out in\r\nthe country, showing just exactly how it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied his friend. \"There are a number of systems of\r\ncolour photography now--all invented within the last few years.\r\nNone of them is perfect though, and you would have the added fun of\r\ncarrying on some experiments that might bring to light some valuable\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"While it is possible to make coloured photographic prints now,\r\nby means of a specially treated paper, colour photography is best\r\nknown as a means of making beautiful transparent glass plates and\r\nlantern slides. When held up to the light, the transparencies give\r\nan accurate picture of the scene in natural colours. The paper I\r\nmention can be bought at the photographic houses, but the inventors\r\ndo not claim yet that their process is so perfect as to give exact\r\nreproductions of all the shades of colours unless they are well\r\ndefined in the positive plates. The prints are made from the positive\r\ntransparencies in just the same way that photographic prints are made\r\nfrom black and white photographic plates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's try some colour photographs,\" promptly said the boy. \"Will you\r\ngo out into the country with me some Saturday and help me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly will be glad to go with you, but you are a better\r\nphotographer than I am, for you see, about the only kind of\r\nphotography I do now is with a microscope, such as you have looked\r\nthrough here many times. Your own regular camera and tripod will be\r\nall you will need, for I will buy the colour plates upon which the\r\npictures are to be taken.\"\r\n\r\nThey made their trip to the country on the first pleasant Saturday,\r\nand while they were out the scientist explained many points about the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\"Years ago,\" he said, \"even before that wonderful Frenchman,\r\nDaguerre, invented light photography, scientists were trying to\r\ndiscover some means of mechanically registering on paper, the\r\nbeautiful things they saw in nature, in their natural colours, as\r\nwell as in their natural form in black and white. All through the\r\nyears of the development of photography with light and shadow,\r\nscientists never relaxed their search for some way of photographing\r\ncolours. Although many of them hit upon the colour screen idea by\r\nwhich it finally was accomplished, there remained years and years\r\nof patient experiment. Prof. James Clark Maxwell, Ducos du Hauron,\r\nDoctor Konig, Sanger Shepherd, and, in later years, Frederick Eugene\r\nIves, of Philadelphia, all worked on the idea.\r\n\r\n\"In 1907, however, Antoine Lumiére, of the famous French photographic\r\nhouse that bears his name, announced a system of colour photography\r\nwhich has grown in popularity ever since. The system, which is known\r\nas the autochrome, was the result of many years patient study and\r\nresearch with his sons who are associated in business with him.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientist then went on to explain that in attacking the problem\r\nthe investigators first had to learn all they could about colours,\r\nand how they are reflected by light rays. As we have seen in the\r\ncolour process for motion pictures there are really only three\r\nfundamental or primary colours, and all other shades and tints are\r\nmade up from combinations of these. The three are blue-violet, green,\r\nand orange-red, and a screen of these forms the foundation of all the\r\ncolour plates now used.\r\n\r\nIn the autochrome process the lowly potato, which we generally\r\nthink of merely as a common article of our food, forms the first\r\nfactor. The starch of the potato is ground down and sifted so that\r\nthe grains are the same size--not more than 0.0004 to 0.0005 of an\r\ninch in diameter. These grains then are divided into three equal\r\nportions, and each portion is dyed, respectively, blue-violet, green,\r\nand orange-red. The three little piles of starch grains are then\r\nmixed together in suitable amounts and dusted on to a plate, which\r\nhas previously been coated with a substance to make them stick. The\r\ndifficulty in dusting on the starch grains is great, for they must\r\ncover the whole plate equally and yet not make any piles of starch\r\nat any one point, for to have several grains on top of one another\r\nwould spoil the effect. The extreme delicacy of this operation will\r\nbe appreciated when it is realized that there are over five million\r\ngrains to the square inch. When the starch is all properly placed it\r\nmakes the colour screen, though in appearance the plate is a dark\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nThe plate is next put through a rolling process so that all the\r\ngrains are flattened out to form a mosaic covering over the whole\r\nsurface. In spite of all the manufacturers can do there will still be\r\nsome microscopic spaces between the particles, and these are filled\r\nup with a fine powder of carbon to prevent the passage of light.\r\n\r\nThe screen is then coated with a very thin layer of varnish and upon\r\nthis is laid a thin and extremely sensitive photographic emulsion.\r\n\r\n\"And so that is the way these autochrome plates we have here were\r\nmade,\" concluded the scientist. \"Now our troubles begin, for we must\r\nbe careful to give them a fair trial with the proper kind of an\r\nexposure and the proper kind of development.\"\r\n\r\nAs the plates are extremely sensitive to all kinds of light the\r\nscientist cautioned the boy against loading the camera carelessly. It\r\nis better, he said, to load in a dark room.\r\n\r\nIn putting the plates in the camera the plates are reversed and\r\ninstead of placing the sensitized side toward the lens, the uncoated\r\nglass is put in front and the photograph is taken through the glass.\r\nThus, the image first passes through the glass, next, through the\r\ngrains of coloured starch, and, lastly, is recorded on the sensitive\r\nphotographic emulsion.\r\n\r\nBefore loading the camera, however, the scientist fitted a yellow\r\ncolour screen over the lens, explaining that this was necessary to\r\nabsorb some of the overactive blue-violet light rays, to which the\r\nemulsion is extremely sensitive.\r\n\r\nIn exposing the plate what happens is this: Suppose a green field\r\nis to be photographed. The green rays of light, reflected from\r\nthe field, pass through the lens, and through the glass support\r\nof the plate. But when they reach the coloured starch, the green\r\nrays pass through the green particles of starch, but not through\r\nthe violet-blue particles, or the orange-red particles, for the\r\ngrains of other colours absorb the green rays and hold them. Thus,\r\ndevelopment would show that the green light rays passing through the\r\ngreen starch particles caused the emulsion to darken under the green\r\nparticles in just the proportion in which the green light reached\r\nthem, and to record the image they carried. As the light would not\r\npass through the other coloured particles they would not record any\r\nimage. Thus a negative is produced, as we have seen, not the colour\r\nwe see in life but the complement. By treating the plate with a\r\nsolvent of silver the tiny black specks that were brought out behind\r\neach green particle are removed and each starch grain is allowed to\r\ntransmit exactly the colour we see in life. In other words, we have\r\na positive.\r\n\r\nThis is just as true of all the shades and hues as it is of the three\r\nfundamental colours, for the various rays of light will penetrate the\r\nstarch in just the proportion of the hues they represent in the scene\r\nbefore our eyes. While the silver solvent will remove the dark images\r\nbuilt up by the penetration of green light, it will leave behind the\r\nparticles of red-orange, and blue-violet, backed up by the creamy\r\nsilver bromide of the emulsion. If above the green field we had a\r\nblue sky, the blue-violet particles would let the blue-violet rays\r\npenetrate them, and record the image of the sky.\r\n\r\nAfter the negative has been treated and made a positive, a second\r\ndevelopment reduces the silver bromide to opaque metallic silver,\r\npreventing any light from passing through the grains through which a\r\npart of the image did not pass. This second bath also brightens the\r\ncolours, while the hypo bath removes the unaltered silver bromide\r\nensuring permanency to the image.\r\n\r\n\"Of course in taking these colour photographs,\" went on the\r\nscientist, \"we must take into consideration a great many things, to\r\nwhich the manufacturers will call your attention in their booklets.\r\nThe exposure is the most important part of all, for these plates are\r\nnecessarily slow and must be exposed for a much longer time than the\r\nordinary rapid plates. For instance, this field, with this bright\r\nsummer sunlight, will require a full second with this lens at U. S.\r\n4.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientist then went on to give the boy directions for developing\r\nhis colour plates, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe whole process of development consists of three operations and but\r\ntwo solutions are required, one of them being kept preferably in two\r\nstock solutions. Apothecary weight is used.\r\n\r\nSTOCK DEVELOPER\r\n\r\n    Water                                        30 ounces\r\n    Metoquinone                                   3-1/2 drams\r\n    Sodium sulphite (dry)                         3 ounces\r\n    Ammonia (density 0.923 or 22 degrees B)       1 ounce\r\n    Potassium bromide                             1-1/2 drams\r\n\r\nDissolve the metoquinone first in lukewarm water and then the other\r\nchemicals in the order given.\r\n\r\nSTOCK REVERSING SOLUTIONS\r\n\r\n    A. Water                                     25 ounces\r\n      Potassium permanganate                     50 grains\r\n    B. Water                                     25 ounces\r\n      Sulphuric acid                              4 drams\r\n\r\nErrors in exposure are to be corrected by varying the duration\r\nof development and the amount of stock solution added after the\r\nappearance of the image. Use the solutions at a temperature of 60\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, and start development of a 5 × 7 plate in\r\n\r\n    Water                         4 ounces\r\n    Metoquinone stock solution    2 drams\r\n\r\nHave ready two graduates, one containing 6 drams of the stock\r\ndeveloper, the other 2-1/4 ounces. Begin counting seconds upon\r\nimmersion of the plate in the weak developer and watch for the\r\noutlines of the image, not considering the sky. If the time of\r\nappearance is less than 40 seconds, add the smaller quantity of stock\r\nsolution; if more, add the greater. The total times of development\r\nare given in the following table. Cover the tray for protection from\r\nlight as soon as the solution has been modified properly.\r\n\r\n    ==================+==================+=======================\r\n    TIME, IN SECONDS, |   QUANTITY OF    |   TOTAL DURATION OF\r\n      OF APPEARANCE   |   METOQUINONE    | DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING\r\n        OF IMAGE,     |  STOCK SOLUTION  |   TIME OF APPEARANCE.\r\n      DISREGARDING    |TO BE ADDED AFTER |---------+-------------\r\n        THE SKY.      |  IMAGE APPEARS.  | Minutes.|  Seconds.\r\n    ------------------+------------------+---------+-------------\r\n         12 to 14     |     6 drams      |    1    |    15\r\n         15 \"  17     |        \"         |    1    |    45\r\n         18 \"  21     |        \"         |    2    |    15\r\n         22 \"  27     |        \"         |    3    |    15\r\n         28 \"  33     |        \"         |    3    |    30\r\n         34 \"  39     |        \"         |    4    |    30\r\n         --------     |   ------------   |   --    |    ---\r\n         40 to 47     |   2-1/2 ounces   |    3    |\r\n          Over 47     |     \"     \"      |    4    |\r\n    ------------------+------------------+---------+-------------\r\n\r\nAs soon as development is finished rinse the plate briefly, immerse\r\nin equal parts of the reversing solutions and carry the tray into\r\nbright daylight. Gradually the image clears and the true colours are\r\nseen by transmitted light. In three or four minutes the action will\r\nbe complete. Rinse the plate in running water for thirty or forty\r\nseconds and immerse again, still in daylight, in the developer. In\r\nthree or four minutes the white parts of the image will be seen to\r\nhave turned entirely black. The plate may now be rinsed for three or\r\nfour minutes in running water and set away to dry without fixing.\r\n\r\nTo avoid frilling in summer, it is well to immerse the plate for two\r\nminutes after reversal in\r\n\r\n    Water                     5 ounces\r\n    Chrome alum              25 grains\r\n\r\nAfter a brief rinsing proceed with the second development as usual.\r\n\r\nThe completed transparency may be protected from scratches to a\r\ncertain extent by varnishing the film side, although this is not\r\nnecessary. The varnish consists of\r\n\r\n    Benzole (crystallizable)      5 ounces\r\n    Gum dammar                    1 ounce\r\n\r\nIt should be applied cold in the usual way, making sure that the\r\nentire surface is covered, and then setting the plate on edge to dry.\r\n\r\nThe other colour processes now used with success also are based upon\r\nthe colour screen.\r\n\r\nThe process known as the omnicolore, which was brought out in France,\r\ndepends upon a screen consisting of a very fine network of violet\r\nlines in one direction, crossed by red and green lines at right\r\nangles. The usual sensitive emulsion is placed over these. The lines\r\nrun more than two hundred to the inch but they can be seen by close\r\nexamination of the plate.\r\n\r\nIn the Thames process which was brought out in England the colour\r\nscreen and the sensitive emulsion are on separate plates which must\r\nbe bound together during exposure and again placed in register or in\r\nexactly the same relative position after development. This causes\r\nsome trouble, but reduces expense as the failures waste the sensitive\r\nplates but not the colour screens. The primary colours instead of\r\nbeing scattered at random, as in the autochrome system, are arranged\r\nin a pattern to give the proper proportions to each. The red-orange\r\nand green particles are arranged in circles, with the green a little\r\nlarger than the red ones, while the blue particles fill the spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEWEST ELECTRIC LIGHTS\r\n\r\nOne evening our boy friend entered the scientist's laboratory and\r\nfound it more brilliantly illuminated than it ever had been before.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" he said looking up at the ceiling, \"those new electric\r\nlights up there are tungsten lamps. It certainly makes a difference\r\nin the looks of this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lights up all the dingy corners, doesn't it?\" answered his friend.\r\n\"You remember,\" he continued, \"we talked last week about some of the\r\nnew kinds of electric light and that made me think that I might just\r\nas well take advantage of what other scientists have done and install\r\nthis newest kind of electric lamps.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the ceiling were suspended several stationary fixtures with\r\nbright glass reflectors. The lamps the boy saw were somewhat larger\r\nthan the usual electric light bulbs, and gave off a beautiful white\r\nlight instead of the slightly yellowish illumination that comes\r\nfrom the ordinary ones. He saw that the filament from which the\r\nillumination came was not arranged in a series of horseshoe curves,\r\nas in the case of the ordinary globes, but that it was strung\r\nbetween the ends of cross trees, or \"spiders,\" so that there was a\r\ngreater total length of filament in the same size bulb than in the\r\nones used before the invention of the tungsten lamp. It is a sight\r\nfamiliar enough to most boys in these days of the rapid adoption of\r\nnew inventions, but it brought to the boy's mind a question that had\r\noften occurred to him before.\r\n\r\n\"Who invented tungsten lights?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it would hardly be right to say that any one individual\r\ninvented them, for they were really a development of science worked\r\nout by many men, who studied the problem for many years. This caused\r\na number of very bitter lawsuits over the patents and brought about\r\nthe imprisonment of one United States patent office official who was\r\nconvicted of falsifying the records at Washington to help one of\r\nthe inventors. This inventor was John Allen Heany, and his patents\r\nwere rejected finally, the rights of the tungsten filament going to\r\nthe General Electric Company. The name 'tungsten' is taken from the\r\nmaterial of which filament, or the little wire which lights up in the\r\nglobe, is made.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is tungsten?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Tungsten is a metal that for a great many years some of our most\r\nprominent chemists and scientific investigators declared could not be\r\nput to the use we see it here,\" answered the man.\r\n\r\nNoticing that the boy leaned forward in his chair, keen on his every\r\nword, the boy's friend continued his description of this strange\r\nmetal that has been put to work lighting us in our march along the\r\nroad of life.\r\n\r\nHe explained that tungsten, or wolfram, was discovered in 1781 and\r\nwas named from the Swedish words \"tung\" (heavy) and \"sten\" (stone).\r\nThe mineral is not found in a pure state but rather in wolframite,\r\nwhich is what the scientists call a tungstate of iron and manganese,\r\nand also in schoolite which is calcium tungstate. Pure tungsten is\r\nbright steel gray, very hard, and very heavy. It is one of the most\r\nbrittle of all the metals and for that reason was put to very few\r\nuses before the invention of the tungsten lamp. It was most commonly\r\nused, however, in various steel processes, to harden the metal.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Edison invented the incandescent lamp in 1879, right up\r\nto the present electricians have tried to get a better electric light\r\nfilament. A number of persons conceived the idea of making a filament\r\nof tungsten on account of its peculiar characteristics, which seemed\r\nto be just about the ones needed for the ideal electric light globe.\r\n\r\nIn its fundamental idea the tungsten lamp is not very greatly\r\ndifferent from the early Edison incandescent lamps, but in\r\nthe application of the principle there is half a century of\r\naccomplishment packed into a little over a quarter of a century of\r\nyears. Edison saw that he must have a filament that would carry the\r\ncurrent of electricity, but yet one which would be of such high\r\nresistance that it would not take up all the current fed to it. He\r\nsaw that he had to have a filament that would heat to incandescence\r\nwith the electrical current, and yet one that would stand a certain\r\namount of wear and tear, and which would not be consumed by the heat.\r\nTo obtain the latter effect he put his filament in an air-tight\r\nglass globe from which the atmosphere was exhausted, leaving it in\r\na vacuum. As there was no air, there was no oxygen, and hence there\r\ncould be no oxidization, or, in other words, combustion of the\r\nfilament.\r\n\r\nEdison thought that success lay in a carbon filament, and in these\r\nearly days when he was experimenting at his Menlo Park laboratory he\r\ncarbonized just about everything he could lay his hands on and tried\r\nheating the result to incandescence in the vacuum globe. Finally,\r\non October 21, he carbonized a piece of cotton thread and put it\r\nin his vacuum globe in the form of a horseshoe loop. On connecting\r\nit with his electric circuit he was rewarded by seeing a brilliant\r\nincandescent light that lasted without dimming for forty straight\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWhat a dim, dingy little light it was in comparison to the world\r\nfamous lights that Edison now puts forth! And yet in one way it\r\nwas the most brilliant light that ever had shone in the world, for\r\nit showed mankind the pathway toward a complete system of electric\r\nlighting by incandescent lamps.\r\n\r\nThe carbonized cotton thread filament had many drawbacks, and Edison\r\ncontinued carbonizing various fabrics and fibres, including, it is\r\nsaid, some of the red hairs out of the beard of one of his loyal\r\nstaff! At last he hit upon a filament made of carbonized Japanese\r\nbamboo that was very successful for a number of years, but this was\r\nlater superseded by a cellulose mixture mechanically pressed out by\r\ndies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, several investigators began work with tungsten and a\r\nsimilar metal called tantalum because of their extremely high\r\nmelting points, high resistance, and other technical characteristics\r\nfavourable for an incandescent filament.\r\n\r\nFor years they had no success because the metal was so very brittle\r\nthat they could do nothing with it, but finally a filament of\r\npressed tungsten was brought out. In this type of lamp several\r\nfilament loops would be fused or welded together to make one complete\r\nfilament. The result was a very fine light, but the little wire was\r\ntoo fragile to stand hard usage, and owing to the fact that the\r\nvarious connected loops were not all of exactly the same thickness,\r\none frequently burned out far ahead of the others and caused early\r\nlamp failure.\r\n\r\nThe next step, and the one which a great many scientists had declared\r\nimpossible, was the manufacture of a tungsten wire through a regular\r\nprocess of drawing it out through dies to the desired length, and in\r\nthe desired thickness. The investigators had declared that in spite\r\nof all they could do, tungsten was too brittle ever to be drawn into\r\nwire. In the latest methods this is accomplished with such perfection\r\nthat tungsten wire of 0.0015 of an inch in diameter is produced.\r\n\r\n\"With the invention of a method for drawing out tungsten wire,\"\r\ncontinued the scientist, \"an almost ideal lamp was practically\r\naccomplished. The wire simply was strung on the spiders or cross\r\npieces, and a filament of almost any length giving almost any desired\r\ncandlepower light could be used.\r\n\r\n\"You see in an incandescent light the higher the melting point of\r\nthe filament the greater the quantity of light for the amount of\r\nelectricity used. Also tungsten has a low vapour tension, which\r\nprevents discolouration of the globe by the evaporation of the\r\nfilament. It also has other advantages which are too technical for us\r\nto go into.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, tungsten lamps still have the drawback of being rather\r\ndelicate. When not in use, and when the filament is cold, it is apt\r\nto break with rough treatment, but when lighted the filament, being\r\nat a white heat, is more durable. This delicacy of the tungsten lamp\r\nis the reason the fixtures for most of them are placed in stationary\r\npositions, rather than on swinging drop cords, as is the case with so\r\nmany carbon incandescent lights.\r\n\r\n\"While the tungsten lamp is far from perfect, it is a great advance\r\nover other forms, and an advance in the right direction, for it gives\r\na better light with a smaller consumption of electricity than other\r\ntypes. I think your father will agree with me that anything that will\r\nhelp ever so little to reduce the high cost of living is a benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" answered the boy, \"there are other new kinds of electric\r\nlights besides tungsten, aren't there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course, but they are hardly as generally used as the tungsten\r\nlight. There is the mercury light about which you read in 'The\r\nSecond Boys' Book of Inventions,' several new kinds of arc lights,\r\nthe Nernst light, the tantalum lamp (which we know is much like the\r\ntungsten lamp with the exception that in the latter each loop of the\r\nwire can be made longer), and the new carbon dioxide gas electric\r\nlight, which is a very good imitation of daylight.\r\n\r\n\"From all our little scientific journeys you have doubtless formed\r\nthe idea that light is not the simple thing it seems, and that the\r\nrays of different kinds of light will bear a limitless amount of\r\nstudy. Now some of the greatest scientists the world ever has known\r\nhave spent the best part of their lives trying to produce a light\r\nthat would duplicate the beautiful health-giving rays of the sun.\r\nThis light we are speaking of comes as near to it as any.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up a long glass test tube and holding it between his\r\nfingers said: \"Now if this tube were exhausted of air to a vacuum,\r\nand we had an ingenious little device at each end which would allow\r\njust the right amount--no more, no less--of carbon dioxide gas to\r\nenter it, and also we had electrodes at either end, and connected\r\nthem to an alternating current, we would have a rough model of the\r\nlight that duplicates daylight.\r\n\r\n\"In actual practice the vacuum tubes are long, and turn upon\r\nthemselves in many lengths. You have seen these lights in many\r\nplaces, for photographers, lithographers, dye works, textile mills,\r\nand all other places where the true light of day is necessary for the\r\njudgment of colours are adopting them for their night work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the light is a ghastly pale blue,\" interrupted the boy. \"It\r\ndoesn't look like daylight to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you are thinking of the mercury light, which also is strung\r\naround in tubes. That has a blue-greenish tinge to it, and gives\r\npeople's faces a disagreeable greenish tinge, but this carbon dioxide\r\nelectric light is white with a salmon pink tinge. Of course it isn't\r\nperfect, but the men who developed it from the work of others who\r\nstarted on this idea years ago, are constantly at work trying to\r\nimprove it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PULMOTOR\r\n\r\n\"My father read in the paper to-day about a new machine called the\r\npulmotor, which he said was one of the greatest inventions ever\r\nbrought out,\" said our boy friend one day in the winter of 1911-12.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a great invention,\" replied the scientist, \"and like so\r\nmany other big things it is so simple we wonder how it is no one was\r\nbright enough to think of it before. I suppose most of us are too\r\nbusy trying to make money.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father said it would be a fine thing for humanity and that it\r\nwould save hundreds of lives every year.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, and the pulmotor is just about the newest invention\r\nof our time, along those lines. When I first heard of it, I wrote to\r\na friend of mine in Chicago, where it was brought out, and asked him\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it work?\" asked the boy, and ever willing to explain the\r\nmarvels of science to his young friend, the scientist took a pencil\r\nand a piece of paper to illustrate as he talked.\r\n\r\nAs every boy knows, oxygen is the property in the air we breathe that\r\ngives us life. Also, every boy knows that physicians and surgeons\r\nuse pure oxygen stored in iron tanks to restore respiration to the\r\nlungs of their patients when breathing has almost stopped. Until\r\nthe invention of the pulmotor, how ever, this oxygen was simply\r\nintroduced into the patient's lungs by placing the tube in his mouth\r\nand turning on the valve.\r\n\r\nThe pulmotor _makes_ the patient breathe--because it carries on the\r\nfunction for him artificially. \"In Chicago this winter,\" said the\r\nboy's friend, \"there were several cases where the pulmotor brought\r\nback to life people who apparently were dead, from asphyxiation, or\r\ngas poisoning. The machine is most successful where breathing has\r\nstopped through some unnatural interference, and the rest of the\r\norgans are physically intact, but of course it can be used in all\r\nsurgical cases just as the ordinary oxygen tank is used.\r\n\r\n\"One case, and probably the one about which your father was reading,\"\r\ncontinued the boy's friend, \"was that of a family of three, father,\r\nmother and little girl, who were asphyxiated, and were apparently\r\ndead. The pulmotor pumped pure oxygen into their lungs until they\r\nbegan to breathe naturally again.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the pulmotor is unpacked from its little wooden box, about the\r\nsize of a suitcase, it looks like a confusion of rubber tubes and\r\nbags. The oxygen is contained in the tank under high pressure, and\r\nthis pressure also furnishes the power to keep up the artificial\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PULMOTOR\r\n\r\n  A--Oxygen tank. B--Reducing valve. C--Inspirator.\r\n\r\n  D-E--Inlet and outlet of controlling valve. F--Operating bellows.\r\n\r\n  G--Dashpot bellows. H--Face cap.]\r\n\r\nThe oxygen flows from the tank through a reducing valve, which cuts\r\ndown the pressure, and into a controlling valve whence it flows by\r\na rubber tube to the face cap which fits tightly over the patient's\r\nnose and mouth. The patient's tongue is kept from sliding back into\r\nhis throat by a pair of forceps placed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThus, the oxygen is forced into the lungs by the pressure, but\r\nwhen it reaches a certain degree, about what it would be in normal\r\nbreathing, a bellows connected with the controlling valve is pressed,\r\nand the pressure is turned to suction so that the oxygen that has\r\nbeen forced into the lungs is brought out, through the outlet,\r\ncausing the poisonous gases to be expelled from the lungs. After the\r\nexhalation is complete the controlling valve works again and another\r\nblast of pure oxygen is sent into the lungs, only to be withdrawn at\r\nthe proper moment. This is kept up until the patient's breathing is\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nWe will leave the scientist and his young friend here, for already we\r\nhave spent more time in following their journeys and talks than we\r\nset out to do. We have not touched upon every invention of the last\r\nten years or so, nor every important development, by a long ways, but\r\nwe have gone far enough to get a pretty fair idea as to the trend of\r\nmodern thought in inventive research.\r\n\r\nThis is the epoch of electricity, and of the utilization of all the\r\ngreat forces of Nature that have been right here to our hands since\r\nthe world began, but which it has taken all these thousands of years\r\nto discover and analyze. More and more man is coming to see that\r\nNature's own forces will carry on the big works of the world, if they\r\nare properly led through an understanding of their laws. We have\r\naviation because man learned how to utilize the fact that air gives\r\nsupport; we have wireless telegraphy, and we will have the wireless\r\ntransmission of power, because man learned that Nature has her own\r\nperfect system of carrying electrical currents when they are properly\r\ndelivered to her, without any cumbersome system of wires; we have the\r\nTesla turbine because its inventor found out that Nature gave steam,\r\ngas, water, and even air, certain properties that are intangible, and\r\nyet stronger far than mere brute force; and so it goes:\r\n\r\nEver a greater familiarity with Nature leads to greater progress, and\r\na happier, more interesting world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n    Minor spelling inconsistencies, mainly hyphenated words, have been\r\n    harmonized.
