HENLEY & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great progress which the art of perfumery has made during recent\r\ntimes is due to several causes, the chief one of which is fully\r\nrealized only by the manufacturer on a large scale, who stands, as\r\nit were, behind the scenes and has access to facts and information\r\nconcerning the materials he uses, which are not so easily accessible\r\nto the dilettante in perfumery, or remain altogether unknown to the\r\nlatter. This important factor is the advance in our knowledge of the\r\nphysical and chemical properties of the several substances used in\r\nperfumery, whereby we can better discriminate between the genuine\r\nand the spurious, the choicest and the inferior, thus insuring, at\r\nthe very start, a satisfactory result, instead of being compelled to\r\nresort to wasteful experimentation and empiricism. A better knowledge\r\nhas also been gained of the sources of the commercial varieties of\r\nmany of the crude products, and a better insight into the conditions\r\naffecting their qualities or properties. A more exhaustive study of\r\nthe proximate principles of many of the essential oils has thrown\r\nan entirely new light upon this heretofore obscure class of bodies,\r\nplacing into our hands new products of definite chemical composition,\r\nunvarying in physical properties, and many of them valuable additions\r\nto the perfumer’s stock of ingredients. Synthetic chemistry has also\r\nadded to the list of materials required by the perfumer, and is surely\r\ngoing to add many more to it hereafter. Though some of these, like\r\nthe new artificial musk, are not yet in a condition to enter into\r\nserious competition with the natural products, yet it is merely a\r\nquestion of time when the latter need no longer be depended upon. The\r\nincreasing demands for the staple articles used by the perfumer have\r\nalso caused a large increase in the cultivation of many important\r\nplants in various parts of the world, and have led to the establishment\r\nof new plantations, in some cases to such an extent that the commercial\r\nrelations have been entirely revolutionized, new territories producing\r\nlarger crops and a finer product than the old home of the plant. The\r\nexploration of hitherto unknown or imperfectly known countries has\r\nalso largely added to the perfumer’s art, and is likely to continue to\r\ndo this for a long time to come, since it is now well known that vast\r\ndistricts, more particularly in tropical Africa, are inhabited by a\r\nflora abounding in new odoriferous plants.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this expansion of the perfumer’s stock of trade,\r\nhowever, which results in the periodical introduction of new compounds,\r\nthere is a very large number of popular odorous mixtures which remain\r\nin steady demand, having taken such firm root among civilized nations\r\nthat they are not likely to be displaced. It is more particularly with\r\na view to afford information regarding these latter that a work like\r\nthe present is desirable and necessary. A treatise on perfumery is\r\nexpected to place into the hands of the purchaser reasonably reliable\r\nprocesses for preparing the most generally approved simple or compound\r\nperfumes, as well as accurate information concerning the origin and\r\nproperties of the various ingredients, together with practical hints\r\nregarding the determination of their genuineness and purity.\r\n\r\nIt is a frequent complaint of those who make preparations after\r\nformulas published in works like the present, that they do not\r\nsucceed in obtaining fully satisfactory products. Another complaint\r\nof purchasers of such works is this: that they fail to find formulas\r\nyielding preparations identical in every respect with certain\r\ncelebrated perfumes which have made the reputation and fortune of\r\ncertain firms. Regarding the first complaint, we would say that\r\nthe failure lies generally with the complainant himself, through\r\ncarelessness in the selection of the materials or disregard of\r\nthe given directions. Concerning the second complaint, a moment’s\r\nreflection must convince any one that formulas which are the result\r\nof the study and experimentation of years, and the products of which\r\nare the main stock of trade of certain firms, are carefully guarded,\r\nand not likely to be communicated to others. Moreover, in many cases\r\neven a publication of the component parts would not be of much avail,\r\nfor the manufacturer on the large scale has facilities for blending\r\nand seasoning his products which the maker on a small scale does not\r\npossess, and it is this part of the art particularly upon which the\r\nquality of the products depends.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the present treatise for the American public many changes\r\nwere found necessary in the original text, in order to make the\r\ninformation given more correct or definite, and so bring the work more\r\nabreast of the present time. In addition to various improvements and\r\nadditions made in the working formulas comprising the second portion of\r\nthe work, the description of the natural products used as ingredients,\r\nupon the quality and selection of which the success of the perfumer\r\nmostly depends, has been carefully revised, and so far as the objects\r\nof this work required, completed by Dr. Charles Rice, Associate Editor\r\nof _American Druggist_, etc., in consultation with several experts in\r\nthe art of perfumery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.

The activities which\r\naimed at the gratification of the eye and ear developed into the\r\ncreative arts and music, and in like manner human endeavor directed\r\ntoward the stimulation of the sense of smell has in our time assumed\r\nthe proportions both of an art and a science; for it was nothing but\r\nthe advancement of chemistry that made it possible to fix all the\r\npleasant odors offered by nature and to create new perfumes by the\r\nartistic combination of these scents. The preparation of perfumes is a\r\nvery ancient art that is met with among all peoples possessed of any\r\ndegree of civilization. It is particularly the ancient nations of the\r\nOrient which had in truth become masters in the manufacture of numerous\r\nperfumes.\r\n\r\nThe first perfume was the fragrant flower; it has continued to be so\r\nto the present day: the sprig of dried lavender flowers which we lay\r\nin the clothes-press was probably used for the same purpose by the\r\ncontemporaries of Aristotle. In the Orient, which we may look upon as\r\nthe cradle of the art of perfumery, the idea suggested itself early to\r\nsubstitute for the delicious fragrance of the flowers some substances\r\nof lasting odor; various sweet-scented resins supplied the material\r\nfor this purpose. The use of these aromatic resins must have been\r\nvery extensive: the ancient Egyptians alone consumed extraordinary\r\nquantities for embalming their dead. How highly the Oriental peoples\r\nin general prized perfumes can be learned from the Bible: the Jews\r\n(like the Catholics to the present day) employed an aromatic gum-resin\r\n(olibanum, frankincense) in their religious ceremonies; in the Song of\r\nSolomon mention is made of Indian perfumes, for instance, cinnamon,\r\nspikenard, myrrh, and aloes.\r\n\r\nAltogether, incense played a prominent part in the religious ceremonies\r\nof the ancient Western Asiatic nations—among many peoples under a\r\ntheocratic government it was even believed to be sinful to use incense\r\nfor other than religious purposes. The Bible teaches us that Ezekiel\r\nand Isaiah protested against it, and that Moses even prescribed the\r\npreparation of certain kinds of incense for use in the tabernacle.\r\n\r\nAmong the most highly civilized people of antiquity, the Greeks, a\r\nlarge number of fragrant substances, as well as oils perfumed with\r\nthem—that is to say, perfumes in the same sense as we still understand\r\nthe term—was known; this will be no surprise to those familiar with the\r\nculture of this remarkable people. The odor of violets was the favorite\r\namong the Greeks; besides this they used the scent of the different\r\nmints, thyme, marjoram, and other aromatic plants. This was carried\r\nso far as to become a matter of fashion for the Greek fop to use only\r\ncertain odors in the form of ointments for the hair, others for the\r\nneck, etc. In order to prevent this luxury which was carried to such\r\nan excess, Solon even promulgated a law that interdicted the sale of\r\nfragrant oils to Athenian men (the law did not apply to the women).\r\n\r\nThe Romans, who were the pupils of the Greeks in all the arts, carried\r\nthe luxury with perfumes perhaps even farther. In ancient Rome there\r\nwas a very numerous guild of perfumers called _unguentarii_; they\r\nare said to have had a street to themselves in Capua. A Patrician\r\nRoman anointed himself three times daily with precious, sweet-scented\r\noils which he personally took along into his bath in golden vessels\r\nof exquisite workmanship, so-called nartheciæ. At the funeral of\r\nhis wife Poppæa, Nero is said to have used as incense more odorous\r\nsubstances than could be produced in one year in Arabia, at that time\r\nthe only reputed source of perfumes. This luxury went so far that\r\nduring the games in the open amphitheatres the whole air was filled\r\nwith sweet odors ascending from numerous censers arranged in a circle.\r\nThe apartments of well-to-do Romans always contained large and very\r\nvaluable urns filled with dried blossoms, to keep the air permanently\r\nperfumed.\r\n\r\nRoman extravagance with perfumes was carried to such an excess that\r\nunder the consulate of Licinius Crassus a law was passed which\r\nrestricted the use of perfumery, there being good reason to fear that\r\nthere would not be enough for the ceremonies in the temples.\r\n\r\nWith the migration of the almost savage Huns and Goths, the refinement\r\nof morals ceased, progress in civilization was retarded for centuries,\r\nand at the same time the use of perfumes disappeared entirely in\r\nEurope; but it was otherwise in the Orient. As an instance we may\r\nmention the prophecy of Mohammed, who promised in the Koran to the\r\nfaithful in paradise the possession of black-eyed houries whose bodies\r\nwere composed of the purest musk.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, the ancient masters of chemistry, were also the first\r\nfounders of the art of perfumery. Thus the Arabian physician Avicenna,\r\nin the tenth century, taught the art of preparing fragrant waters from\r\nleaves, and Sultan Saladin, in 1157, on his triumphal entry, had the\r\nwalls of the mosque of Omar washed with rose water.\r\n\r\nIt was the intercourse with the Orient brought about by the Crusades\r\nthat made Europeans again more familiar with the art of perfumery, and\r\na number of new odors rapidly became known. Italy and France, in those\r\ntimes the representatives of culture, were the countries in which the\r\npreparation of perfumes was carried on on a large scale. Thus, for\r\ninstance, we find the name of a Roman family preserved to the present\r\nday because one of its members had combined a sweet-scented powder,\r\ncalled Frangipanni after its inventor, which is still in favor, and\r\nbecause his grandson Mauritius Frangipanni had made the important\r\ndiscovery that by treating this powder with spirit of wine the fragrant\r\nsubstance could be obtained in a fluid form.\r\n\r\nThe fact has been frequently related and repeated, that Catherine de\r\nMedici, the wife of Henry II., had made use of the fashion of perfuming\r\nthe body for the purpose of ridding herself of objectionable persons,\r\nby giving them scented gloves prepared and at the same time poisoned by\r\na Florentine named René (Renato?). We think this tale to be simply a\r\nhair-raising fable—modern chemistry knows no substance the mere touch\r\nof which could produce the effect of a fatal poison; and it is scarcely\r\ncredible that such a material had been known at that time and lost\r\nsight of since.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, especially at the court of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nperfumes were used with great extravagance; in fact, were looked upon\r\nas one of the necessaries of life. This luxury was carried still\r\nfarther at the courts of the sumptuous kings of France; Louis XV. went\r\nso far as to demand every day a different odor for his apartments. A\r\nlady’s lover always used the same kind of perfume she did.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that among the Oriental nations perfumes are used so\r\nlargely that even food is flavored with rose water, musk, etc.; and\r\nIndian and Chinese goods always possess a peculiar aroma which is so\r\ncharacteristic for certain products that it was considered to be a sign\r\nof genuineness; this was the case, for instance, with the patchouly\r\nodor which always adheres to Indian shawls.\r\n\r\nA shawl-maker of Lyons, who had succeeded in perfectly imitating Indian\r\nshawls with reference to design and colors, spent a fabulous sum to\r\nobtain possession of the plant used by the Indian weavers for perfuming\r\ntheir wares. Despite the great outlay caused by the search for this\r\nplant, the manufacturer is said to have done a flourishing business\r\nwith his “genuine” Indian shawls.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times the great extension of trade to the farthest\r\ncountries of the globe, and still more the progress of chemistry, have\r\nmade us familiar with a number of new perfumes. More than two hundred\r\ndifferent aromatic substances are now known, and still they are far\r\nfrom being exhausted; every year new odoriferous plants become known,\r\nfrom which the chemist extracts perfumes. By this means, as well as by\r\nthe enormous employment of perfumes in all grades of society, the art\r\nof their preparation has risen to a higher plane; out of empiricism,\r\nwhich alone prevailed a few decades ago, into the domain of the\r\nchemical sciences.\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of the last edition of this book, the art of\r\nperfumery has made noteworthy progress both with reference to the\r\nknowledge of new aromatic substances and to improvement in the\r\nmethods of their preparation; by the introduction of glycerin, solid\r\nand liquid vaselin, and salicylic acid into perfumery, one of its\r\nbranches—hygienic cosmetics—has made an important advance.\r\n\r\nAt present it is particularly France and England whose perfumery\r\nindustry is most extensive and which to some extent rule the markets of\r\nthe world; southern France and Algiers especially furnish the best raw\r\nmaterials, the finest essential oils for the manufacture of perfumes at\r\nthe chief centres, Paris and London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nABOUT AROMATIC SUBSTANCES IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe apply the term perfume—which really means a fumigating material—to\r\nthose substances which make an agreeable impression upon our sense of\r\nsmell; the French call them briefly _odeurs_, _i.e._, odors. The high\r\ndegree of development at present attained by this industry in France\r\nand England is the cause of the fact that all perfumes are generally\r\nsold under French or English names, which must be borne in mind by\r\nmanufacturers in this country.\r\n\r\nPerfumes or scents, however, exert not only an agreeable impression\r\non the olfactory organ, but their effect extends to the entire\r\nnervous system, which they stimulate; when used in excess, they are\r\napt to cause headache in sensitive persons; the laborers in the\r\nchemical factories where these substances are produced on a large\r\nscale, occasionally even suffer by reason of their stimulating action\r\non the nerves. For this reason perfumes should never be employed\r\notherwise than in a very dilute condition; this necessity arises from\r\na peculiarity of the odorous substances which when concentrated and\r\npure have by no means a pleasant smell and become fragrant only when\r\nhighly diluted. Oil of roses, of orange flowers, or of jasmine, in\r\nfact nearly all aromatic substances, have an almost disagreeable odor\r\nwhen concentrated; only in an extremely dilute state they yield those\r\ndelightful scents which we admire so much in the blossoms from which\r\nthey are derived.\r\n\r\nIt will be easier to understand the almost incredible productiveness\r\nof perfumes if we cite as an instance that a few centigrams of musk\r\nplaced on a sensitive scale can for years fill a large hall with their\r\ncharacteristic odor without showing an appreciable loss of weight, and\r\nstill particles must separate from the musk and become evenly diffused\r\nthrough the air of the hall because the odor is perceptible throughout\r\nevery part of it.\r\n\r\nIt would be an error, however, were we to assume that all aromatic\r\nsubstances possess the same degree of productiveness; some of them, as\r\nfor instance the odorous principle of orris root, have a comparatively\r\nfaint smell—a fact which must be borne in mind in the combination of\r\nperfumes. Even odors having a very similar effect on the olfactory\r\nnerves differ widely in their intensity; for instance, true oil (attar)\r\nof roses possesses an intensity more than twice as great as that of the\r\nrose geranium; many authorities agree in giving the proportion as three\r\nto eight, the first figure being that of rose oil, the second that of\r\noil of rose geranium. Therefore, in order to produce perfumes of equal\r\nintensity (having the same effect on the olfactory nerves), we must\r\ndissolve in an equal quantity of the menstruum either three parts by\r\nweight of the attar of roses or eight parts of the oil of rose geranium.\r\n\r\nIn the prescriptions for the preparation of perfumes given in this\r\nbook, these proportions have been carefully weighed; but it will be the\r\noffice of the trained olfactory sense of the manufacturer to modify\r\nthem for the various kinds of perfumery in such a way as to produce a\r\ntruly harmonious pleasant odor.\r\n\r\nAlthough we know many aromatic substances, we are still in ignorance as\r\nto the preparation of certain decidedly agreeable odors. Thus no one at\r\npresent is able to produce the refreshing odor of the sea borne along\r\non the wind, any more than we are able to reproduce the scent exhaled\r\nby the forest, especially after a warm rain; chemistry, though it has\r\ndone much in the domain of perfumery, has thus far thrown no light\r\nupon it. Even certain vegetable odors—for instance, the delightful\r\nperfume exhaled by some Aroideæ and Primulaceæ—we cannot as yet\r\npreserve unchanged in perfumery. This opens an illimitable field for\r\nfuture activity to the progressive manufacturer.\r\n\r\nIn a book devoted to the production of perfumes it would certainly\r\nbe in place to say something about the physiological relations of\r\nthe olfactory sensations; but unfortunately this interesting part\r\nof physiology is still enveloped in great obscurity. All we know\r\npositively on this subject is that many particles of the odorous bodies\r\nevaporate and must come in contact with the olfactory nerves in order\r\nto produce the sensation of odor. There is no lack of experiments\r\nseeking to draw a parallel between sensations of smell and those of\r\nhearing, and, as is well known, we speak of a harmony and dissonance\r\nof odors as we do of tones. Piesse, the renowned perfumer, has even\r\nmade an attempt to arrange the different odors in a “harmonic scale”\r\nhaving the compass of the piano, and to deduce therefrom a law for the\r\nmixture of the several aromatic substances. This attempt, although very\r\ningenious, still lacks a scientific foundation. Piesse endeavors to\r\ncombine the several scents like tones to produce chords in different\r\nscales; the chords of odors are to agree with those of tones. Thus far,\r\nhowever, no proof has been furnished that the olfactory nerve and the\r\nacoustic nerve have the same organization, and under this supposition\r\nalone could Piesse’s system be accepted as correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF AROMATIC SUBSTANCES ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGIN.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the substances used in perfumery are derived from\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, but some come from the animal kingdom, and\r\nfor others which do not occur complete in nature we are indebted to\r\nchemistry. As is well known, most blossoms possess a decided odor,\r\nwhich is extremely fragrant in some; yet it is not the blossoms\r\nalone, but in different genera various parts are distinguished by\r\nagreeable odors. In some plants the fragrant substances are contained\r\nin every part, as in different pines and the mints; in others, only\r\nin the fruits (nutmeg, vanilla), while the other parts are odorless;\r\nin certain plants only the rinds of the fruits contain an aromatic\r\nsubstance (oranges, lemons). In the Florentine Iris the entire plant is\r\nodorless—only its root stock possesses an agreeable, violet-like scent;\r\nwhile, for instance, in the camphor-tree an aromatic substance exists\r\nin the wood, in the cinnamon laurel in the bark, in the clove-tree\r\nmainly in the closed buds.\r\n\r\nBut taking the aromatic plants all together, we find that it is\r\nparticularly their flowers which contain the finest odors, and that the\r\nmajority of perfumes are prepared from their blossoms.\r\n\r\nFrom the animal kingdom we take for the purposes of perfumery only a\r\nvery small number of substances, among which, moreover, some peculiar\r\nrelation exists; while, for instance, all men would call the odor of\r\nviolets, roses, vanilla, etc., agreeable, the odor of some animal\r\nsubstances is decidedly obnoxious to many persons, though others like\r\nit—an observation which can be verified often with reference to musk.\r\n\r\nWith the advancement of science, chemical products find application\r\nin ever increasing numbers; among them are substances which owe their\r\norigin directly to the vegetable kingdom, while others, such as\r\nnitrobenzol and pine-apple ether, are only indirectly derived from it.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated, we learn that our attention must be directed\r\nparticularly to those scents which are derived from the vegetable\r\nkingdom. To the manufacturer of perfumery, however, it is a matter\r\nof importance whence the plants are obtained which he uses for the\r\npreparation of the odors; a very slight change in the soil often\r\nmakes a great difference in the quality of one and the same species;\r\nwe see this quite clearly in our ordinary strawberry. While the wild\r\nfruit is but small in size it has a delightful aromatic flavor, and\r\nthe same species transplanted into gardens attains much greater size\r\nbut possesses only a faint aroma not to be compared with that of the\r\nwild variety. The Lombardian violet is large and beautiful, but the\r\nGerman has a much more pleasant odor. On the other hand, the blossoms\r\nof the orange-tree obtained from the plants cultivated in pots cannot\r\nbe compared with reference to their odor with these growing in the\r\nRiviera, the strip of coast land of the Mediterranean from Marseilles\r\nto Genoa. Altogether the last-named region and the south of France\r\nmay be called the true garden of the perfumer; in the neighborhood of\r\nGrasse, Cannes, Nice, Monaco, and some other towns, extensive plots\r\nof ground are set with aromatic plants such as orange-trees, Acacia\r\nfarnesiana, jasmine, violets, etc., whose products are elaborated\r\nin large, well-appointed chemical factories solely devoted to the\r\nextraction of their odors. The proximity of the sea-coast, with its\r\nfavorable climate almost free from frost, permits the cultivation of\r\nsouthern plants, while in the more elevated parts of the country the\r\nadjoining Maritime Alps cause a more changeable climate which adapts\r\nthem to certain other sweet-scented plants.\r\n\r\nThe great value of the annual production of the French flower farms at\r\nCannes, Grasse, and Nice will be evident from the following figures.\r\nThe harvesting and elaboration of the flowers at the points named\r\ngive employment to fifteen thousand persons, and the average annual\r\nproduction is:\r\n\r\nOrange flowers,  2,000,000 kgm., valued at 2,000,000 francs.\r\nRoses,             500,000  \"       \"        500,000   \"\r\nJasmine,            80,000  \"       \"        200,000   \"\r\nViolets,            80,000  \"       \"        400,000   \"\r\nAcacia flowers,     40,000  \"       \"        160,000   \"\r\nTuberoses,          20,000  \"       \"         80,000   \"\r\n                  ———-———-                  ———-———-\r\n                 2,720,000 kgm., valued at 3,340,000 francs.\r\n\r\nFrom these flowers were manufactured: 500,000 kgm. of pomades and\r\nessences, 1,000,000 litres of orange-flower water, 100,000 litres of\r\nrose water, and 1,200 kgm. of oil of roses.\r\n\r\nBesides, in more northern countries we find here and there quite\r\nan extensive cultivation of aromatic plants; this is the case, for\r\ninstance, in England, where lavender, crisp mint, and peppermint are\r\nplanted on a large scale solely for their perfume. In northern Germany,\r\ntoo, we sometimes find caraway and sweet flag cultivated, for their\r\npeculiar odors only, in special fields.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the place of growth of a plant exerts a powerful\r\ninfluence on the quality of the odors developed in it; this\r\ncircumstance may be the reason why certain scents are prized most\r\nhighly when they are derived from some definite regions, because\r\nthe buyer is sure that the product from such places is of superior\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nThus we find that English oils of lavender and peppermint are valued\r\nmore highly and bring better prices than those from other points of\r\nproduction; some places even have, as it were, acquired a monopoly of\r\ncertain odors. While the factories at Cannes produce the most perfect\r\nodors of roses, orange flowers, jasmine, and cassie, those at Nice\r\nare famous for the finest odors of violet, reseda (mignonette), and\r\ntuberose, and those of Italy for the odors of bergamot and orris root.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are in the United States no extensive places of\r\ncultivation for odoriferous plants, although certain localities are\r\nvery well adapted to the growth of violets, mignonette, roses, syringa,\r\nlavender, etc. Peppermint, however, is grown on a large scale in some\r\nparts of New York State and in Michigan. Of course such an enterprise,\r\nin order to be profitable, requires the intelligent co-operation\r\nof planters and duly qualified chemists, besides well-furnished\r\nlaboratories and a considerable amount of capital; but under these\r\nconditions the prospects of gain are good.\r\n\r\nAt present the manufacturers of perfumery are almost entirely dependent\r\nupon English and French factories for their supply of odors. Owing to\r\nthe absence of competition, the prices for the products, excellent\r\nthough they are, are high, and become still more so when the crops\r\nare short. These conditions would be materially altered under active\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, the odors used in perfumery may be divided into\r\nthree distinct groups according to their origin. These groups are:\r\n\r\n1. Odors of vegetable origin.\r\n\r\n2. Odors of animal origin.\r\n\r\n3. Odors of artificial origin—chemical products.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the preparation of true perfumes, it is necessary\r\nto become acquainted with the several raw materials required in their\r\nmanufacture; that is to say, the simple odorous substances, their\r\norigin, their preparation, and their peculiar qualities. Besides these\r\nodorous raw materials, the art of perfumery makes use of a number of\r\nchemical and mineral products, whose quality largely influences that\r\nof the perfume to be made. These, therefore, likewise call for an\r\nappropriate description. Among these auxiliary substances are alcohol,\r\nglycerin, fixed oils, and solid fats, which play an important part\r\nnot only in the preparation of the perfumes, but also enter into the\r\ncomposition of many. The liquid handkerchief perfumes always contain\r\na large quantity of alcohol, the scented hair oils consist largely\r\nof fixed oils, while solid fats of animal or vegetable origin occur\r\nin the so-called pomades. As we shall see, the actual odors, owing\r\nto their extraordinary productiveness, constitute generally only a\r\nsmall percentage of the perfumes; the greatest bulk is usually either\r\nalcohol, fixed oil, or solid fat.\r\n\r\nHence, as the last-named substances, aside from the odoriferous\r\nmaterials, form the foundation of all articles of perfumery, the\r\nmanufacturer must devote particular attention to their purity, and\r\ntheir qualities must be discussed in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nODORS FROM THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe odors occurring in plants have their seat mostly in peculiar\r\nreceptacles called oil glands in which the aromatic substances are\r\nstored and seem to take no further part in the vital processes of the\r\nplant. As has been intimated, the parts of the plant in which the\r\naromatic substances are stored differ greatly; but in general it may be\r\nsaid that in most cases the flowers and fruits contain the odors; more\r\nrarely they may be found in the roots, in the bark, or in the wood,\r\nand in very few instances equally distributed throughout the whole\r\nplant. In some cases, however, we can obtain totally different odors\r\nfrom various parts of the same plant; this applies, for instance, to\r\nthe orange-tree, whose blossoms furnish a different odor from the ripe\r\nfruits, and the latter must be distinguished from that obtainable from\r\nthe leaves. The odorous substances occurring in the vegetable kingdom\r\nare either mobile liquids (essential oils), or they have a thicker\r\nconsistence ranging from that of cream to that of soft cheese (balsams\r\nor gum-resins), or they are solid (resins). Aside from the fact that\r\nthe term “essential oils” is quite incorrect, since the substances\r\ncalled by that name have nothing in common with oils except perhaps\r\nthe liquid state, we are forced from a chemical standpoint to include\r\namong them even solid substances; the well-known camphor, a firm and\r\nwaxy-looking body, belongs according to all its chemical properties\r\ninto the same group as the so-called essential oils. The name\r\n“essential (or volatile) oils” is due to the fact that the volatile\r\nvegetable aromatic substances cause a stain on paper similar to that\r\nproduced by oils and fats; but the stain made by the former disappears\r\nspontaneously after some time, while that due to true oils and fats\r\npersists. The disappearance of the stain depends on the evaporation\r\nof the vegetable aromatic substances—a quality not possessed by fats.\r\nHence the volatile vegetable aromatic substances, in contradistinction\r\nfrom non-volatile fixed or fatty oils, have been designated as\r\nessential or volatile or ethereal oils. Inasmuch as the latter terms\r\nare the ordinary trade names for these substances, we are compelled to\r\nretain them despite their incorrectness. The French name for essential\r\noils is _essences_; “essence de lavande,” for instance, is the French\r\nname for essential oil of lavender, and not for an alcoholic solution\r\nof the oil, as might be inferred from the usually accepted meaning of\r\nthe English terms “essence of lavender,” “essence of peppermint,” etc.,\r\nwhich mean solutions of these essential oils in alcohol.\r\n\r\nAs the localities where the raw materials—that is, the aromatic\r\nplants—are cultivated on a large scale naturally constitute the places\r\nof manufacture of essential oils, we find in southern France and\r\nin England the most extensive factories devoted exclusively to the\r\npreparation of perfumes. In the countries named, a favorable influence\r\nis exerted, too, by their situation near the sea, as well as by their\r\ntrade with tropical lands from which additional aromatic plants are\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nWe have stated above that the manufacture of essential oils forms\r\nalmost a monopoly in France and England; but there is no doubt that\r\nthis country (the United States) likewise possesses many localities\r\nfavorable to the cultivation of certain aromatic plants and the\r\npreparation of essential oils from them, so that this branch of\r\nindustry could be carried on at a profit. For this reason we have in\r\nour descriptions devoted some attention to the conditions of growth\r\nrequired by such plants as might be raised here. We even find that some\r\nadvantages are derived from the hot-house cultivation of some tropical\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nAn exact knowledge of the chemical properties of a substance is in all\r\ncases the first and fundamental condition for its preparation; it would\r\nappear necessary, therefore, that we should endeavor to gain complete\r\ninformation about the nature of vegetable aromatic substances before we\r\nenter upon the description of the various methods of their preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF VEGETABLE AROMATIC SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the odors derived from the vegetable kingdom can be\r\ndivided, as stated above, into so-called essential oils, balsams,\r\ngum-resins or soft resins, and hard resins. Since the latter bear a\r\ncertain relation to the essential oils from which they are formed\r\nthrough chemical combinations, we must consider them first.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, the fruits and their rinds, or even the wood of some\r\nplants form the receptacles of essential oils; if they are liquid they\r\nare called essential oils _par excellence_; if they are firm they\r\nare called camphors. Besides, there are intermediate states between\r\nthem: oil of rose is always viscid and solidifies even at temperatures\r\nconsiderably above the freezing-point of water (see under Oil of Rose).\r\n\r\nThe bodies which are generally called essential oils are usually\r\nmixtures of a hydrocarbon with an oxygenated body, or an unchanged oil\r\nwith another which has become altered by the influence of the oxygen of\r\nthe air—a condition to which we shall recur later on. With reference\r\nto their elementary composition, essential oils may be divided into two\r\ngroups:\r\n\r\n1. Non-oxygenated essential oils.\r\n\r\n2. Oxygenated essential oils.\r\n\r\nThe non-oxgenated essential oils consist only of two elements—carbon\r\nand hydrogen; the other group, as the name indicates, contains a third\r\nelement in chemical combination, and consist of carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen. Most of the essential oils of the first group have the same\r\nchemical composition: C_{10}H_{16} (10 atoms of carbon combined with\r\n16 atoms of hydrogen). Despite the like chemical composition, all the\r\nessential oils display different physical qualities; they vary in\r\ndensity, in refractive power, in boiling-point (often by many degrees),\r\nand, a matter of the greatest importance for our purposes, in their\r\nodor. We may state at once that but few essential oils can be said\r\nto have a pleasant odor; that of most of them is even disagreeable\r\nand narcotic to the olfactory nerves; it is only after the oil has\r\nbeen extremely diluted that the odor begins to become pleasant and to\r\nresemble that of the plant from which the oil was derived.\r\n\r\nAccording to their physical qualities, essential oils may be described\r\nas fluids of a specific narcotic odor, colorless but very refractive,\r\nand easily inflammable. Only a few essential oils can be produced\r\nin such a state of purity as to appear perfectly colorless; usually\r\nthey are more or less dark yellow in color, and some even possess a\r\ncharacteristic tint; thus oil of acacia is reddish-brown, oils of\r\nrose and absinth are green, oil of chamomile is blue. But a simple\r\nexperiment will show that the color is not inseparably connected with\r\nthe oil, for certain tinted oils can be obtained perfectly colorless\r\nby being distilled with another, less volatile oil which retains the\r\ncoloring matter.\r\n\r\nThe boiling-point of essential oils is in general very high —between\r\n160° and 288° of the centigrade thermometer (C.), or 320° to 550°\r\nF. The fact that we smell the essential oils in aromatic plants so\r\ndistinctly despite their high boiling-point is an evidence of their\r\nexceedingly strong influence on the olfactory nerves.\r\n\r\nA peculiar property of essential oils, which is of great importance\r\nin their preparation, is that of distilling over in large quantities\r\nwith steam—both ordinary and superheated—that is, at temperatures\r\nat most only slightly exceeding 100° C. or 212° F. For this reason\r\nessential oils are usually obtained in this way, since they are but\r\nslightly soluble in water. Still, most of the oils dissolve in water in\r\nsufficient amount to impart to it their characteristic odor and thus\r\nto render it often very fragrant. Aqua Naphæ triplex (orange-flower\r\nwater), rose water, etc., are such as have been distilled over with the\r\nessential oils, contain a small quantity of the latter in solution, and\r\nhence have a very agreeable odor.\r\n\r\nAll essential oils dissolve readily in strong alcohol, petroleum ether,\r\nbenzol, bisulphide of carbon, in liquid and solid fats, in glycerin,\r\netc.; we shall again recur to this important subject under the head of\r\nthe preparation of the essential oils.\r\n\r\nIf a freshly prepared essential oil is at once excluded from the air\r\nby being placed in hermetically sealed vessels which it completely\r\nfills, and is kept from the light, the oil will remain unchanged for\r\nany length of time. But if an essential oil is exposed to the air, a\r\npeculiar, chemical alteration begins, which proceeds more rapidly and\r\nobviously if direct light acts upon the oil at the same time. The odor\r\nbecomes less intense, the oil grows darker in color and more viscous,\r\nand also acquires a peculiar quality: it has a strong bleaching\r\neffect which is easily seen on the cork closing the bottle, which is\r\nbeautifully bleached. After a certain time the oil changes to a viscid,\r\nless odorous mass, into balsam, and the latter, after the prolonged\r\ninfluence of the air, finally changes into a brownish, odorless\r\nsubstance, into resin.\r\n\r\nThese remarkable physical and chemical alterations depend on the fact\r\nthat the essential oil absorbs oxygen from the air, which it puts into\r\na peculiar condition in which it exerts increased chemical activity\r\nand is termed ozonized oxygen. One of the most marked of these effects\r\nis the uncommonly strong bleaching power of ozonized or active oxygen.\r\nWhen an essential oil that has altered so far as to contain ozonized\r\noxygen—which is shown by its bleaching vegetable coloring matters such\r\nas the juice of cherries, red beets, tincture of litmus, etc., agitated\r\nwith it—is cooled, we notice the separation from it of a usually\r\ncrystalline, colorless, and odorless body called stearopten, while the\r\nremaining liquid part is called elæopten. Stearopten always contains\r\noxygen, while elæopten still consists only of carbon and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of the stearopten we distinctly see the beginning\r\nprocess of resinification, which, therefore, is nothing but an\r\noxidation (combination of the essential oil with oxygen). It should,\r\nhowever, be stated that as to many essential oils this is not proven\r\nby actual observation. Many of them are not known to us as naturally\r\nexisting without any stearopten. Balsams are essential oils which\r\nhave to a great extent changed into resin, which they contain in\r\nsolution, and thereby have become more or less viscid. If the process\r\nof oxidation goes still farther, eventually the greater portion of the\r\nessential oil becomes oxidized, the entire mass grows firm, and then\r\npossesses only a very faint odor which is due to the last remnants of\r\nthe unchanged essential oil.\r\n\r\nSince aromatic substances during evaporation become mixed with air, it\r\nappears probable that they act upon the olfactory nerves only at the\r\nmoment when they become oxidized.\r\n\r\nThe entire process of resinification of oil of turpentine can be\r\nfollowed very clearly on the pitch pine (Pinus austriaca, or other\r\nspecies of Pinus), just as oil of turpentine in general can be taken\r\nas an example of an essential oil on which the peculiarities of the\r\nnon-oxygenated essential oils may be easily studied. In many localities\r\nthe pitch pine is partly deprived of its bark when it has reached a\r\ncertain age. From the trunk exudes oil of turpentine which in the air\r\nbecomes more and more viscid by the absorption of oxygen and changes\r\ninto balsam, called turpentine. The latter is collected and distilled\r\nwith water, when the unchanged oil of turpentine passes over with the\r\nsteam, while the odorless resin (rosin or colophony) remains behind in\r\nthe stills.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned qualities of the essential oils indicate naturally\r\nhow those used in perfumery, which are often very costly, are to be\r\npreserved. For this purpose small strong bottles should be chosen which\r\nare closed with well-fitting glass stoppers, over which is applied a\r\nglass capsule ground to fit tightly over the neck of the bottle. _These\r\nbottles should always be completely filled_ (hence small bottles should\r\nbe selected), _and kept tightly closed, in the dark_. As the action of\r\noxygen is retarded by low temperatures, it is advisable to keep bottles\r\ncontaining essential oils in a cool cellar. But care must be had never\r\nto pour out an essential oil in the cellar near an open candle light.\r\nThe vapors are very apt to take fire, as they are quite inflammable.\r\n\r\nAs there are a great many aromatic vegetable substances, so there\r\nare numerous odors, or, to retain the customary though incorrect\r\nappellation, numerous essential oils. All of these, however, cannot be\r\nused in the art of perfumery, as some of them do not possess a pleasant\r\nodor, as is the case, for instance, with oil of turpentine. (We may\r\nstate here, however, that very pure oil of turpentine, distilled from\r\ncertain Coniferæ, has an agreeable, refreshing odor which at present\r\nhas found application in perfumery under the title of forest perfume\r\nor pine-needle essence.) Besides, there are numerous essential oils\r\nwhich, while possessing a very pleasant odor, still cannot be used in\r\nperfumery except for very cheap preparations, though they are employed\r\nin much larger quantities in the manufacture of liqueurs. Such oils\r\nare: oil of cumin, fennel, juniper, absinth, etc.\r\n\r\nAs we shall return to this subject in connection with the essential\r\noils which are used in perfumery in general, we will now consider at\r\ngreater length the aromatic vegetable substances which are employed for\r\nthe manufacture of fragrant odors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE AROMATIC VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES EMPLOYED IN PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery fragrant portion of a plant can be used for the preparation of\r\nan aromatic substance, and therefore for the manufacture of a perfume.\r\nHence we are unable, in the following enumeration of the aromatic\r\nvegetable substances, to make any claim to absolute completeness; for\r\nevery new scientific expedition may acquaint us with hitherto unknown\r\nplants from which the finest odors may be obtained. We have said above\r\nthat we have not yet even fixed in our perfumes all the odors of the\r\nknown aromatic plants, and therefore there is still a large field open\r\nto the progressive manufacturer.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we must restrict ourselves to the description of\r\nthose aromatic vegetable substances which are used in the laboratories\r\nof the most advanced and scientific perfumers for the manufacture of\r\nodors. At the same time we lay particular stress on the fact that the\r\nknowledge of these raw materials is a matter of the greatest importance\r\nto the manufacturer of perfumes because it enables him to appreciate\r\nthe differences, often very minute, between fine and inferior\r\nqualities. Every manufacturer who aims at the production of fine goods\r\nmust make it the rule to use nothing but the best raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe price of the latter is apparently disproportionately high; for\r\nall that, only the most expensive materials should be bought, for it\r\nis the only kind that can be used. Let us give but two instances in\r\nillustration. We find in the market, grades of vanilla the prices of\r\nwhich are as one to four; the latter is fresh and contains the aromatic\r\nsubstance in large amount; the former is old, dry, and worthless, with\r\nan artificial glossy surface and little odor. The differences in the\r\nprice are still greater in an aromatic substance of animal origin,\r\nmusk, the cheapest grades of which are altogether artificial and\r\nperfumed with a mere trace of genuine musk.\r\n\r\nOf course, the same remark applies to the raw materials of animal\r\norigin and to the chemical products, all of which should be of the\r\ngreatest purity obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe aromatic substances at present employed in perfumery for the\r\nextraction of odors are the following.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLSPICE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Pimenta; _French_—Piment; _German_—Piment; Nelkenpfeffer.\r\n\r\nThis spice consists of the fruit berries, at first green, later black,\r\nof the Eugenia Pimenta, indigenous to Central America and the Antilles.\r\nIt is chiefly used in the manufacture of liqueurs, less in perfumery,\r\nthough it may be employed as an addition to certain strong odors,\r\nparticularly that of oil of bay; it serves very nicely for scenting\r\ncheap soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nANISE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Pimpinella Anisum; _French_—Anis; _German_—Anis.\r\n\r\nThis well-known plant, which is cultivated in many localities on a\r\nlarge scale, belongs to the Order of Umbelliferæ. The seeds contain\r\nabout three per cent of a very aromatic essential oil which finds\r\napplication in the manufacture of soap and in cheap perfumery; it is\r\nchiefly used as a flavoring for liqueurs. Good anise must have a light\r\ngreen color, an agreeable sweetish odor, and a sharp taste. In order to\r\nincrease the weight, anise is occasionally moistened with water; such\r\nseeds look swollen, are apt to become slimy, and then furnish a less\r\nfragrant oil. Anise is not to be confounded with star-anise, which will\r\nbe mentioned hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALM.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Melissa officinalis; _French_—Melisse; _German_—Melissenkraut.\r\n\r\nMelissa officinalis, an herbaceous plant with large, beautiful flowers,\r\nwhich grows wild in our woods, contains a very sweet-smelling oil in\r\nsmall quantities. This can be extracted by distillation from the fresh\r\nherb, and furnishes very fine perfumes.\r\n\r\nOil of Melissa of the market is, however, usually an East Indian oil,\r\nderived from Andropogon citratus. See under Citronella.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAY (SWEET BAY).\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Laurus nobilis; _French_—Laurier; _German_—Lorbeerfrüchte.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the bay-tree contain much essential oil which is used\r\nless in the manufacture of perfumery than for scenting soap. Venice is\r\nthe most important point of export. See the next article.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAY (WEST INDIAN).\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Myrcia acris; _French_—(Huile de) Bay; _German_—Bay (-Oel).\r\n\r\nThe essential oil obtained from the leaves of this tree, a native of\r\nthe West Indies, possesses a very aromatic, refreshing odor somewhat\r\nresembling that of allspice. It is known in the market as bay oil or\r\noil of bay. During the last decade or so its use has largely extended,\r\nand, while formerly almost unknown on the continent of Europe, has\r\nbecome an important article for the perfumer. An alcoholic distillate,\r\nprepared by distilling the fresh leaves with the crude spirit from\r\nwhich rum is otherwise obtained, is known as bay-rum, and is used as a\r\npleasant and refreshing wash for the skin. Bay-rum may also be made by\r\ndissolving the oil, together with certain other ingredients, in alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENZOIN.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Benzoinum; _French_—Benjoin; _German_—Benzoëharz.\r\n\r\nThis gum-resin, which possesses a pleasant vanilla-like odor, comes\r\nfrom a tree belonging to the Order of Styracaceæ, the Styrax Benzoin,\r\nand probably another species of Styrax, indigenous to tropical Asia,\r\nespecially Siam and Sumatra. The collection of benzoin is very similar\r\nto that of pine resin; the bark of the tree is cut open, the exuding\r\njuice is allowed to harden on the trunk, and is thus brought into\r\ncommerce. Benzoin differs according to its origin, the age of the tree,\r\netc., and in commerce a number of sorts (Siam, Penang, Palembang, and\r\nSumatra) are distinguished. As a rule, benzoin comes in lumps ranging\r\nin size to that of a child’s head. They are of a light gray color and\r\ninclose white, almond-shaped pieces. The finest quality, known as Siam\r\nbenzoin after its source, usually is in small pieces (Siam benzoin\r\nin tears) which are translucent, light yellow to brown externally,\r\nbut milky white on fracture, and have a strong vanilla odor. Less\r\nfine but still very good is Siam benzoin in lumps, consisting of\r\nlarge reddish-brown pieces inclosing white particles. All other kinds\r\nmentioned above come from the island of Sumatra, in lumps the size of a\r\nfist. What was formerly known as Calcutta benzoin formed large friable\r\npieces of a dirty reddish-gray color. Siam as well as Penang benzoin\r\noften contains, besides benzoic acid, also cinnamic acid; it is not\r\nknown why it is not a regular constituent. The worst quality is sold\r\nas “benzoin sorts,” consisting of brownish pieces without white spots;\r\nthey are often mixed with splinters of wood, bast fibres, and fragments\r\nof leaves, and can be used only for cheap perfumes.\r\n\r\nGood benzoin, besides the qualities named, must have a sweetish and\r\nburning sharp taste, it should be very friable, and when heated in a\r\nporcelain capsule should emit vapors (benzoic acid) of an acrid taste\r\nand a pronounced aromatic odor; it should dissolve completely in strong\r\nalcohol. In perfumery, benzoin serves for the preparation of many\r\nodors, washes, and the manufacture of benzoic acid. The latter will be\r\nfurther discussed under the head of aromatic substances obtained by\r\nmeans of chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERGAMOT.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Citrus Bergamia; _French_—Bergamote; _German_—Bergamottefrüchte.\r\n\r\nThe bergamot is the fruit of a tree belonging to the Order of\r\nAurantiaceæ, which is cultivated in Calabria. The tree is unknown in\r\na wild state. The golden-yellow or greenish-yellow fruits, resembling\r\na lemon in shape, have a bitter and at the same time acid pulp; the\r\nthin rind contains a very fragrant oil which is used largely in the\r\nmanufacture of fine perfumery and soaps, and is exported chiefly from\r\nMessina and Palermo.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTER ALMONDS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Amygdala amara; _French_—Amandes amères; _German_—Bittere\r\nMandeln.\r\n\r\nThe well-known fruits of the bitter almond-tree (Amygdalus communis,\r\nvar. amara). There are no definite botanical differences between the\r\nsweet and the bitter almond-tree. The only distinct difference is the\r\ncharacter of the respective fruits. The aromatic substance obtained\r\nfrom bitter almonds is not present fully formed in the fruits, but\r\nresults from the chemical transformation of the amygdalin they contain;\r\nthe latter body is absent in sweet almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAJUPUT LEAVES.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Folia Cajuputi.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of Melaleuca Cajuputi, a tree found in the Indian and Malay\r\nArchipelago, which have an aromatic odor resembling that of cardamoms.\r\nIn the Orient the leaves are used as incense and for the extraction of\r\nthe oil they contain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR WOOD.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Lignum Camphoræ; _French_—Bois de camphre; _German_—Campherholz.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the Camphor-tree, native of China and Japan, is exceedingly\r\nrich in essential oil, the firm, white, and strong-scented camphor.\r\nThe latter is usually prepared from the wood at the home of the tree,\r\nespecially in Formosa and Japan, so that the wood hardly forms an\r\narticle of commerce and is here enumerated only for completeness’ sake.\r\nIn China and in Japan, however, it is largely used for the manufacture\r\nof cloth-chests, trunks and wardrobes, as these are never invaded by\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARAWAY SEED.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Semen Carvi; _French_—Carvi; _German_—Kümmelsamen.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Carum Carvi, which is largely cultivated in Germany,\r\ncontains in its seeds from four to seven per cent of essential\r\noil which is extracted by distillation. Genuine caraway seed is\r\nbrownish-yellow, pointed at both ends, quite glabrous on examination\r\nwith a lens, and marked with five longitudinal ribs. Caraway is\r\noccasionally confounded with cumin seed, from Cuminum Cyminum, which\r\nis easily recognized with a lens: the seeds of the latter plant have\r\nfourteen longitudinal ribs and are hairy. The use of caraway in\r\nperfumery is limited to ordinary goods, but in the manufacture of\r\nliqueurs it is largely employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASCARILLA BARK.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Cortex Cascarillæ; _French_—Cascarille;\r\n_German_—Cascarillarinde.\r\n\r\nThis is the bark of a West Indian tree, Croton Eluteria, belonging to\r\nthe Order of Euphorbiaceæ, native of the Bahamas. It occurs in commerce\r\nin the shape of pieces the length and thickness of a finger; externally\r\nit is white and fissured, internally of a brown color and resinous.\r\nGood qualities should be free from dust and fractured pieces (sifted\r\ncascarilla), of a warm aromatic taste, and a very agreeable odor which\r\nbecomes more marked on being heated. Another variety of cascarilla\r\nderived from South Africa, Cascarilla gratissima, has very fragrant\r\nleaves which can be used immediately as incense, just as cascarilla in\r\ngeneral is employed in perfumery chiefly for fumigating powders and\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSIE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Acacia farnesiana; _French_—Cassie; _German_—Acacie.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of Acacia farnesiana (Willd.), one of the true acacias,\r\nnative of the East Indies, which flourishes farther north than the\r\nother varieties, cultivated largely in southern France for the\r\ndelightful odor which resembles that of violets but is more intense.\r\nThe flowers are collected and made to yield their odorous principle\r\nby one of the methods to be described hereafter. The plant which is\r\ngenerally but falsely called Acacia in this country, viz., Robinia\r\npseudoacacia, likewise bears very fragrant flowers which undoubtedly\r\ncan be made to yield a perfume by some one of the usual methods; but\r\nso far we know of no perfume into which the odor of Robinia flowers\r\nenters. Moreover, it is not alone the flowers of Acacia farnesiana\r\nwhich may be utilized for the preparation of the cassie perfume; the\r\nblack currant, Ribes niger, contains in its flowers an odor closely\r\nresembling the former; this is actually used in the preparation of an\r\noil sold under the name of “oil of cassie.” The latter plant flourishes\r\nin our northern States and would answer as a substitute for Acacia\r\nfarnesiana, which cannot stand our northern winters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDAR WOOD.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Lignum Cedri; _French_—Bois de cèdre; _German_—Cedernholz.\r\n\r\nThe wood met with in commerce is derived from the Virginian juniper\r\ntree, Juniperus virginiana, which is used in large quantities for\r\ninclosing lead pencils. The chips, the offal from this manufacture,\r\ncan be employed with advantage for the extraction of the essential oil\r\ncontained therein. Long uniform shavings of this wood are also used for\r\nfumigation, and the sawdust for cheap sachet powders. Cedar wood is\r\nreddish-brown, fragrant, very soft, and splits easily. In the perfumery\r\nindustry it usually passes under the name of the “cedar of Lebanon,”\r\nalthough the wood from the last-mentioned tree (Cedrus libanotica) has\r\nquite a different agreeable odor, is very firm, reddish-brown, and of a\r\nvery bitter taste—qualities by which it is readily distinguished from\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCINNAMON.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Cinnamomum; _French_—Canelle; _German_—Zimmtrinde.\r\n\r\nCinnamon consists of the bark of the young twigs of the cinnamon-tree,\r\nCinnamomum zeylanicum, indigenous to Ceylon. Good cinnamon consists\r\nof thin, tubular, rolled pieces of bark which are smooth, light brown\r\n(darker on fracture), of a pronounced characteristic odor, and a\r\nburning and at the same time sweet taste. The most valuable in commerce\r\nis that from Ceylon; the thicker bark is less fine.\r\n\r\nChinese cinnamon or cassia (French, Cassie; German, Zimmtcassia)\r\nconsists of the bark of the cassia-tree, an undetermined species of\r\nCinnamomum indigenous to Southern China; this is grayish-brown and\r\nhas the general properties of true cinnamon, but it as well as the\r\noil extracted from it has a less fine odor than cinnamon or oil of\r\ncinnamon. A very fine kind of Cinnamon has for a number of years past\r\nappeared on the market under the name of Saigon cinnamon. It is very\r\nrich in oil, and is exported from Cochin-China. Besides the true oils\r\nof cinnamon and cassia, other essential oils are met with in commerce\r\nunder the names of oil of cinnamon flowers and oil of cinnamon leaves,\r\nbut their odor is not so fine as that of the former. The so-called\r\ncinnamon flowers are the unripe fruits of various cinnamon laurels,\r\ncollected after the fall of the blossoms. They form brownish cones the\r\nlength of the nail of the little finger, and furnish an essential oil\r\nwhose odor resembles that of cinnamon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRON.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Fructus Citri; _French_—Citron; _German_—Citronenfrüchte.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of a tree, Citrus medica, indigenous to northern India, but\r\nlargely cultivated in the countries situated around the Mediterranean\r\nand in other countries. It is cultivated both for the pleasant acid\r\njuice of the fruit and for their fragrant rinds. Only the latter are of\r\nvalue for our purposes. It occurs in European commerce under the name\r\nof Citronat or citron peel. Good commercial citron peel should be in\r\nquarters and as fresh as possible, which is shown by its softness, the\r\nyellow color, and the strong odor. Old peel looks shrunken and brownish\r\nand has but little pleasant odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRON FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Flores Citri; _French_—Fleurs de citron;\r\n_German_—Citronenblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the citron-tree (Citrus medica) are white, fragrant,\r\nand contain a very aromatic essential oil; but as the oil is always\r\nextracted from the fresh flowers, the latter do not form an article of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRYLAUREL LEAVES.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Folia Laurocerasi; _French_—Laurier-cérise;\r\n_German_—Kirschlorbeerblätter.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this tree (Prunus Laurocerasus), which is largely\r\ncultivated for officinal purposes, furnish an odorous substance\r\ncompletely identical with that contained in bitter almonds, or, rather,\r\nformed in them under certain conditions. As the extraction of the\r\nodorous substance from bitter almonds is much cheaper, cherry-laurel is\r\nbut rarely used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRONELLA.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Andropogon Nardus; _French_—Citronelle; _German_—Citronella.\r\n\r\nThis grass, which, like the oil prepared from it, is called citronella,\r\nis a native of northern India, and is largely cultivated in Ceylon,\r\nwhere large quantities are worked for the oil; for this reason the\r\ngrass itself is seldom met with in commerce. Its odor is somewhat\r\nsimilar to that of the Indian lemon grass, that of verbena, and that\r\nof several other aromatic plants, in place of which citronella is\r\nfrequently employed.\r\n\r\nMuch confusion exists in much of the current literature regarding the\r\nsource and synonymy of the Indian grass oils and allied products. The\r\nfollowing list contains the most important ones:\r\n\r\n1. _Andropogon citratus_ DC.—Lemon Grass. The oil is known as Lemon\r\nGrass Oil, Indian Verbena Oil or Indian Melissa Oil, or simply Oil of\r\nVerbena or Oil of Melissa.\r\n\r\n2. _Andropogon laniger_ Desf.—This is the Juncus odoratus or Herba\r\nSchoenanthi of older pharmacy. No oil is prepared from this.\r\n\r\n3. _Andropogon muricatus_ Retz.—Cuscus or Vetiver. Source of Oil of\r\nVetiver.\r\n\r\n4. _Andropogon nardus_ L.—Citronella. Source of Oil of Citronella.\r\n\r\n5. _Andropogon Schoenanthus_ L.—Ginger Grass. The oil is known as\r\nOil of Ginger Grass, Oil of Geranium Grass, Oil of Indian Geranium\r\nor simply Oil of Geranium, also Oil of Rose Geranium [“Rose” is here\r\na corruption of the Hindostanee name of the plant, viz., Rusa], Oil\r\nof Rusa Grass, Oil of Rusa, Oil of Palmarosa.—The two terms “Oil of\r\nGeranium” and “Oil of Rose Geranium” should be abandoned for this oil,\r\nto avoid confusion with the “Oil of (Rose) Geranium” obtained from\r\nPelargonium. See under “Geranium.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Caryophylli; _French_—Clous de girofle; _German_—Nelkengewürz.\r\n\r\nThis well-known spice comes from a tree, Caryophyllus aromaticus,\r\nnative of the Moluccas, and largely cultivated at Zanzibar, Pemba, and\r\nelsewhere. It consists of the closed buds. The main essential of good\r\nquality is the greatest possible freshness, which may be recognized by\r\nthe cloves being full, heavy, reddish-brown, and of a fatty aspect,\r\nand they must contain so much essential oil (about 18 per cent)\r\nthat when crushed between the fingers the latter should be stained\r\nyellowish-brown. Before buying, this test should always be made, and\r\nattention paid to the fact whether the whitish dust is present in the\r\nwrinkles about the head. We have found in commerce cloves from which\r\nthe essential oil had been fraudulently extracted with alcohol and\r\nhence were worthless; such cloves may be recognized by the faint odor\r\nand taste, but especially by the absence of the whitish dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Cucumis sativus; _French_—Concombre; _German_—Gurke.\r\n\r\nThe well-known fruits of this kitchen-garden plant, though not\r\nstrictly sweet-scented, possess a peculiar refreshing odor which has\r\nfound application in perfumery. Certain products belonging under this\r\nhead require the odor of cucumber, and therefore this plant is to be\r\nincluded among the aromatic plants in a wider sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULILABAN BARK.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Cortex Culilavan; _French_—Ecorce culilaban;\r\n_German_—Kulilabanrinde.\r\n\r\nThe bark of Cinnamomum Culilavan Nees, a plant indigenous to the\r\nMolucca islands, used to occur in commerce in the shape of long, flat\r\npieces of a yellowish-brown color, with an odor like a mixture of\r\ncinnamon, sassafras, and clove oils. It is rarely met with now.\r\n\r\n\r\nDILL.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Semen Anethi; _French_—Aneth; _German_—Dillsamen.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Anethum graveolens, which is indigenous to the\r\nMediterranean region and southern Russia, contains in all its parts,\r\nparticularly in the seeds, an oil of a peculiar odor, which is used\r\nas a perfume for soap, also in cheap perfumery, and especially as a\r\nflavoring for liqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDER FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Flores Sambuci; _French_—Sureau; _German_—Hollunderblüthen.\r\n\r\nThis bush, Sambucus niger, which grows wild in Europe, bears umbellar\r\nflowers which are officinal, but contain besides a pleasant odor which\r\ncan be extracted from them. The odor of the flowers deteriorates on\r\ndrying, hence in perfumery only the fresh flowers should be used. The\r\nAmerican elder (Sambucus canadensis) could easily be used in place of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENNEL (SEED AND HERB).\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Fœniculum; _French_—Fenouil; _German_—Fenchel.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Fœniculum vulgare, Order Umbelliferæ, is largely cultivated\r\nin Europe. It contains an essential oil in all its parts, but\r\nespecially in the seeds. The plant is rarely used in perfumery, but\r\nmore frequently in the manufacture of liqueurs. The herb, dried and\r\ncomminuted, enters into the composition of some cheap sachets.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANGIPANNI (see Plumeria).\r\n\r\n\r\nGERANIUM.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Pelargonium roseum; _French_—Géranium; _German_—Geranium.\r\n\r\nThis plant, originally indigenous in South Africa, contains in its\r\nleaves an essential oil whose odor closely resembles that of roses. At\r\npresent it is cultivated on a large scale in many parts of France and\r\nin Turkey, solely for the purposes of perfumery. This plant would grow\r\nfreely in our Southern and Middle States, and could be cultivated with\r\nadvantage for the extraction of its highly valued perfume.\r\n\r\nThe terms “Oil of Geranium” and “Oil of Rose Geranium” ought to\r\nbe restricted in commerce to the oil obtained from true geranium\r\n(Pelargonium). Unfortunately, they are yet very commonly applied to\r\nan East Indian oil obtained from a species of Andropogon (see under\r\nCitronella).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hedyosmum Flowers.=\r\n\r\nOn the Antilles there are a number of bushes belonging to the Genus\r\nHedyosmum, Order Chloranthaceæ, whose flowers possess a magnificent,\r\ntruly intoxicating odor. Thus far these odors seem to have been\r\naccessible only to English perfumers. The perfumes sold under this name\r\nby Continental manufacturers are merely combinations of different odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELIOTROPE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Heliotropium peruvianum; _French_—Héliotrope;\r\n_German_—Heliotropenblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of this plant, which flourishes well in all temperate or\r\ntropic countries, possess a very pleasant odor, about the preparation\r\nof which we shall have more to say hereafter. In Europe only French\r\nperfumers have manufactured it; according to the author’s experiments,\r\nhowever, its extraction presents no more difficulty than that of any\r\nother plant.\r\n\r\nA synthetic, chemical product, known as piperonal, related to vanillin\r\nand cumarin, possesses the odor of the heliotrope in a most remarkable\r\ndegree. It is therefore much used to imitate the latter. In commerce it\r\nis known as heliotropin.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEYSUCKLE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Flores Loniceræ; _French_—Chèvre-feuille; _German_—\r\nGeisblattblüthen.\r\n\r\nThis well-known climbing plant, Lonicera Caprifolium, found in many of\r\nour garden bowers, contains an exceedingly fragrant oil in its numerous\r\nflowers, from which the author has prepared it. [Some of the American\r\nspecies of honeysuckle would, no doubt, likewise yield an essential\r\noil.] The oil sold in commerce under this name is not obtained from\r\nthese flowers, but is an imitation of the odor conventionally accepted\r\nfor it. The true oil of honeysuckle, first prepared by the author, far\r\nsurpasses these imitations in fragrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSSOP.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Hyssopus officinalis; _French_—Hyssope; _German_—Ysopkraut.\r\n\r\nHyssop possesses a strong odor, a very bitter taste, and is used only\r\nfor cheap perfumery, but more frequently in the manufacture of liqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nJASMINE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Jasminum odoratissimum; _French_—Jasmin; _German_—Jasminblüthen.\r\n\r\nTrue jasmine—not to be confounded with German jasmine (Philadelphus\r\ncoronarius, known here as the mock orange, or the Syringa of\r\ncultivation) which is likewise employed in perfumery—flourishes\r\nparticularly in the coast lands of the Mediterranean, where it is\r\ncultivated as a dwarf tree. The odor obtained from the flowers is one\r\nof the finest and most expensive in existence, and for this reason it\r\nwould be well worth trying the cultivation in our southern States. At\r\npresent nearly all the true jasmine perfume (pomade, extract, etc.)\r\ncomes from France.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVENDER.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Lavandula vera; _French_—Lavande; _German_—Lavendel.\r\n\r\nTrue lavender, which belongs to the Order of Labiatæ that contains\r\nmany aromatic plants, is one of the most ancient in our art; it was\r\nearly used in Greece for purposes of perfumery. Although true lavender\r\nflourishes throughout central Europe, its cultivation on a large scale\r\nis carried on chiefly in England, and the oil of lavender from English\r\nfactories is most highly prized. Much lavender is also grown in France,\r\nbut the product, though very fine, has a much lower value.\r\n\r\nTrue lavender is to be distinguished from spike-lavender (French,\r\naspic; German, Spik-Lavendel), whose odor is similar to that of true\r\nlavender, but furnishes a much less aromatic perfume. The cultivation\r\nof lavender in this country (U. S.) might give good results.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Citrus Limonum; _French_—Limon; _German_—Limonenfrüchte.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the South European lemon-tree, not to be confounded with\r\ncitrons, resemble the latter in appearance, but they are smaller, have\r\na more acid taste and a thinner rind. The peel contains an essential\r\noil which is very similar in odor to that of the citron. Hence the oils\r\nof lemon, limetta (from Citrus Limetta), and citron are used for the\r\nsame purposes; but when the three oils are immediately compared, an\r\nexperienced olfactory organ perceives a marked difference between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON GRASS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Andropogon citrates; _French_—Schoenanthe;\r\n_German_—Citronengrass.\r\n\r\nThis grass, which bears a close resemblance to citronella, is largely\r\ncultivated, especially in India and Ceylon, for the essential oil it\r\ncontains. The odor of the grass is similar to that of verbena, so that\r\nits oil is often used as an adulterant or rather as a substitute for\r\nthe former. (Compare the article on “Citronella.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nLILAC.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Flores Syringæ; _French_—Lilas; _German_—Fliederblüthen.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Syringa vulgaris, a native of Persia but fully acclimated\r\nin Europe and in this country, has very fragrant flowers, the odor of\r\nwhich can be obtained only from the fresh blossoms.\r\n\r\nA recently discovered liquid principle, now known as terpineol\r\n(C_{10}H_{17}OH), which exists in many essential oils, and in these, in\r\nthe portion boiling between 420° and 424° F., possesses the lilac odor\r\nin a most pronounced degree, and to its presence in the lilac flowers\r\nthe peculiar odor of the latter is, no doubt, due. It is obtainable in\r\nthe market under the name lilacine.\r\n\r\nThe Syringa of the florists is not the true lilac, but the same as the\r\nMock Orange, viz., Philadelphus coronarius.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Lilium candidum; _French_—Lis; _German_—Lilienblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe remarks made under the head of Wallflower apply equally to the\r\nblossoms of the white garden lily: strange to say, they are not used in\r\nperfumery, and all the so-called odors of lily are mixtures of several\r\naromatic substances. The author has succeeded in separating from the\r\nflowers, by means of petroleum ether, the delightful odor present in\r\nlarge amount in the blossoms of this plant, and has employed it in the\r\nmanufacture of magnificent perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Macis; _French_—Macis; _German_—Muscatblüthe.\r\n\r\nThis substance is the dried arillus covering the fruits of Myristica\r\nfragrans, the so-called nutmegs. The tree bearing them is indigenous\r\nto a group of islands in the Indian Archipelago and is cultivated\r\nespecially on the Molucca islands. Although mace is in such close\r\nrelation with nutmeg, yet, strange to say, the aromatic substance\r\ndiffers decidedly from that of the nut. Mace of good quality forms\r\npieces of orange-yellow color; they are fleshy, usually slit open\r\non one side, have a strong odor, tear with difficulty, and are so\r\noily that when crushed they stain the fingers brownish-yellow. Mace\r\nis largely used in the preparation of sachets and particularly for\r\nscenting soap. In England, soap scented with mace is well liked.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNOLIA.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Magnolia grandiflora; _French_—Magnolia;\r\n_German_—Magnoliablüthen.\r\n\r\nThe magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), indigenous to the warmer parts of\r\nSouth, Central, and North America, bears large white flowers having a\r\ndelightful odor which can be extracted by means of petroleum ether.\r\nIn the same way, truly intoxicating perfumes may be obtained from\r\nother varieties of magnolia. In our climate these plants flourish only\r\nin conservatories, and in their home no steps have yet been taken\r\nto utilize these natural treasures in a proper way; hence European\r\nmanufacturers invariably produce the perfume called magnolia by\r\ncombination of different odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARJORAM.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Herba majoranæ; _French_—Marjolaine; _German_—Majorankraut.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Origanum Majorana (vulgare), frequently cultivated in\r\nkitchen gardens, possesses in all its parts a strong odor due to an\r\nessential oil. The latter, which is quite expensive, is but little\r\nused, and probably only for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\n“Oil of Origanum” in English-speaking countries is intended to mean Oil\r\nof Thyme (from Thymus vulgaris), and never means Oil of Marjoram.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADOW SWEET.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Spiræa ulmaria; _French_—Reine des prés; _German_—Spierstaude.\r\n\r\nThis plant is frequent in Europe on damp meadows, and contains an\r\naromatic substance closely allied to oil of wintergreen, which occurs\r\nalso in the Canadian variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINT.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Mentha; _French_—Menthe; _German_—Minze.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of mint claiming our attention are the following:\r\n_Mentha piperita_, Peppermint (French: Menthe poivrée; German:\r\nPfefferminze).—_Mentha viridis_, Spearmint (French: Menthe verte;\r\nGerman: Grüne Minze).—_Mentha crispa_, Crisp Mint (French: Menthe\r\ncrépue [or frisée]; German: Krause Minze).\r\n\r\nAll of the mints have a pleasant odor; besides the plants named above,\r\nwe may mention Mentha aquatica, whose odor faintly but distinctly\r\nrecalls that of musk. Like lavender, Mentha crispa and M. piperita are\r\ncultivated particularly in England, and the English oils are the most\r\nsuperior. Mentha piperita is also largely cultivated in the United\r\nStates. Mentha viridis and its oil are almost exclusively confined to\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSK-SEED.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Semen Abelmoschi; _French_—Grains d’ambrette;\r\n_German_—Bisamkörner.\r\n\r\nThe tree, Hibiscus Abelmoschus, indigenous to Africa and India, bears\r\nfruit capsules containing reddish-gray seeds with grooved surface,\r\nso-called musk-seeds. They have an odor resembling musk, but much\r\nweaker, though it becomes more pronounced when the seeds are bruised.\r\nBesides this species of Hibiscus, other plants belonging to the same\r\norder are aromatic and are also used in perfumery.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRRH.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Myrrha; _French_—Myrrhe; _German_—Myrrhe.\r\n\r\nThe gum-resin which we call myrrh has long been known in the East,\r\nwhere it was celebrated as one of the finest perfumes, along with\r\nspikenard and frankincense. The tree, Balsamodendron Myrrha (or\r\nCommiphora Myrrha Engler) is indigenous to the countries bordering\r\nthe Red Sea to about 22° N. Lat.; the gum exudes partly spontaneously\r\nfrom the trunk. In European commerce myrrh appears in different sorts;\r\nthat called myrrha electa or myrrha in lacrimis is the most precious;\r\nit forms tears of a golden yellow to brown color, traversed by white\r\nveins; they have a pleasant smell. That called myrrha naturalis is\r\ninferior, but on being heated develops the characteristic aroma. In\r\ncommerce a product is sometimes offered by the name of myrrh which is\r\nnothing but cherry-tree gum scented with genuine myrrh.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRTLE LEAVES.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Myrtus communis; _French_—Myrte; _German_—Myrtenblätter.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this Southern European plant diffuse a pleasant odor;\r\nthe oil to which it is due can be extracted by distillation; yet the\r\nperfumes usually called myrtle are not obtained from the plant, but are\r\nmade by the combination of several aromatic substances. The aromatic\r\nwater known, especially in France, as “eau d’anges” is obtained by the\r\ndistillation of myrtle leaves with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCISSUS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Narcissus poeticus; _French_—Narcisse;\r\n_German_—Narcissenblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms of this favorite garden plant, which is cultivated on a\r\nlarge scale near Nice, have a pleasant, almost narcotic odor which may\r\nbe extracted in various ways; though the greatest part of the so-called\r\nnarcissus perfumes are made artificially.\r\n\r\nAnother species of Narcissus (Narcissus Jonquilla) is frequently\r\ncultivated in warm countries for its pleasant scent; but the perfumes\r\ngenerally found in the market under the name of Extract, etc., of\r\nJonquil are artificial compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTMEG.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Myristica; _French_—Muscade; _German_—Muscatnüsse.\r\n\r\nThese nuts are almost spherical in shape, the size of a small walnut,\r\nof a grayish-brown color externally, and usually coated with a\r\nfaint whitish-gray covering (which is lime). Internally they are\r\nreddish-brown, with white marbled spots. Good fresh nutmegs should be\r\ndense, heavy, and so oily that when pierced with a needle a drop of\r\noil should follow the withdrawal of the latter. Nuts which are hollow,\r\nwormy, and of a faint odor cannot be used in perfumery. Oil of nutmeg\r\nis used extensively in perfumery, but is rarely employed pure, more\r\ncommonly in combination with other strong odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIBANUM.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Olibanum; _French_—Encens; _German_—Weihrauch.\r\n\r\nThis gum-resin, employed even by the ancient civilized nations of Asia,\r\nespecially as incense for religious purposes, comes from East African\r\ntrees, various species of Boswellia. Fine olibanum appears in light\r\nyellow tears, very transparent and hard, whose pleasant though faint\r\nodor becomes particularly marked when it is thrown on hot coals. In\r\nperfumery olibanum is used almost exclusively for pastils, fumigating\r\npowders, etc. Pulverulent olibanum constitutes an inferior quality and\r\nis often adulterated with pine resin.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPOPANAX.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Resina Opopanax.\r\n\r\nThe root stock of an umbelliferous plant, indigenous in Syria, now\r\nrecognized at Balsamodendron Kafal, furnishes a yellow milky sap\r\ncontaining an aromatic resin with an odor resembling that of gum\r\nammoniacum. At least the opopanax now obtainable in the market is\r\nderived from this source. True opopanax resin, such as used to reach\r\nthe market formerly, is now unobtainable, and its true source is yet\r\nunknown. Opopanax oil is used in perfumery to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Flores Aurantii; _French_—Fleurs d’oranges;\r\n_German_—Orangenblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the bitter orange tree (Citrus vulgaris), as well as\r\nthose of the sweet (Citrus Aurantium), contain very fragrant essential\r\noils, which differ in flavor and value according to their source and\r\nmode of preparation. See below, under Oil of Orange. The leaves, too,\r\ncontain a peculiar oil used in perfumery.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE PEEL.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Cortex Aurantii; _French_—Ecorce d’oranges;\r\n_German_—Orangenschalen.\r\n\r\nThe very oily rinds of the orange occur in commerce in a dried form;\r\nsuch peels, however, can be used only in the manufacture of liqueurs;\r\nin perfumery nothing but the oil from the fresh rinds is employed, and\r\nthis is generally obtained by pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGANUM.\r\n\r\nSee Marjoram, and Thyme.\r\n\r\n\r\nORRIS ROOT.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Radix Iridis florentinæ; _French_—Iris; _German_—Veilchenwurzel.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine sword-lily, Iris florentina, which often grows wild in\r\nItaly but is largely cultivated, has a creeping root-stock covered with\r\na brown bark which, however, is peeled from the fresh root. Orris root\r\noccurs in commerce in whitish pieces which are sometimes forked; the\r\nsurface is knotty, and the size may reach the thickness of a thumb and\r\nthe length of a finger. When fresh, the roots have a disagreeable sharp\r\nodor, but on drying they attain an odor which may be said to resemble\r\nthat of the violet; but on comparing the two odors immediately,\r\na considerable difference is perceptible even to the untrained\r\nolfactory sense. Orris root should be as fresh as possible; this may\r\nbe recognized by its toughness, the great weight, and the white, not\r\nyellow color on fracture. It is very frequently used for sachets and\r\nfor fixing other odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALM OIL.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Oleum Palmæ; _French_—Huile de Palme; _German_—Palmöl.\r\n\r\nPalm oil, a fixed oil derived from Elais guineensis, possesses a\r\npeculiar odor faintly recalling that of violets which is easily\r\nextracted. Although not used thus far in perfumery, personal\r\nexperiments have convinced the author that the odor can be employed in\r\nthe manufacture of cheap perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATCHOULY.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Pogostemon Patchouly; _French_—Patchouly;\r\n_German_—Patschulikraut.\r\n\r\nThis herb, indigenous to the East Indies and China, in appearance\r\nsomewhat resembling our garden sage, is used in the countries named as\r\none of the most common perfumes; many East Indian and Chinese goods\r\n(such as Cashmere shawls, India ink, etc.) owe their peculiar odor to\r\nthe patchouly herb which is very productive. In this respect it can be\r\ncompared only with the nutmeg, but exceeds even this in intensity. This\r\nherb is not known very long in Europe, but at present it is imported\r\nin large quantities from India; in commerce it occurs in small bundles\r\nconsisting of stems and leaves (collected before flowering).\r\n\r\n\r\nPERU BALSAM.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Balsamum peruvianum; _French_—Beaume du Pérou;\r\n_German_—Perubalsam.\r\n\r\nThis balsam, imported from Central America (San Salvador), is derived\r\nfrom Toluifera Pereiræ; incisions are made in the bark and trunk of\r\nthe tree, from which the balsam exudes. Peru balsam is of a syrupy\r\nconsistence, thick and viscid, brownish-red in thin, blackish-brown in\r\nthick layers. Its taste is pungent, sharp, and bitter, afterward acrid;\r\nits odor is somewhat smoky, but agreeable and balsamic. Peru balsam is\r\noften sophisticated with fixed oil; this can be readily detected by\r\nagitation with alcohol, by which the oil is separated. But if castor\r\noil is the adulterant, this test is not applicable, as castor oil\r\ndissolves with equal facility in alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINE-APPLE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Bromelia Ananas; _French_—Ananas; _German_—Ananas.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this plant, originally derived from the East Indies, have\r\na well-known narcotic odor which can be extracted from them.\r\n\r\nIn commerce we often meet with a chemical product called pine-apple\r\nether which will be described at greater length under the head of\r\nchemical products used in perfumery. Pine-apple ether has an odor\r\nusually considered to be like that of the fruit, but when the two\r\nsubstances are immediately compared a great difference will be\r\ndetected. Pine-apple ether finds quite extensive application in\r\nconfectionery for the preparation of lemonades, punch, ices, etc. If\r\nthe true pine-apple odor is to be prepared from the fruits, care must\r\nbe had to use ripe fruits; the unripe or overripe fruits possess a less\r\ndelicate aroma.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Dianthus Caryophyllus; _French_—Œillet; _German_—Nelkenblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe odor of this favorite garden plant can be easily extracted from\r\nthe flowers by means of petroleum ether; but the genuine odor of pink\r\nis hardly ever met with in perfumery; the preparations sold under this\r\nname being usually artificial mixtures of other odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMERIA.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Plumeria; _French_—Plumeria; _German_—Plumeriablüthen.\r\n\r\nAll the Plumerias, indigenous to the Antilles, contain very fragrant\r\nodors in their flowers. To the best of our knowledge, these odors\r\nhave not yet been extracted from the flowers, and all the perfumes\r\nsold under this name (sometimes also called Frangipanni) are merely\r\ncombinations of different odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESEDA (MIGNONETTE).\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Reseda odorata; _French_—Mignonette; _German_—Reseda.\r\n\r\nThis herbaceous plant, probably indigenous to northern Africa, but long\r\ndomesticated in Europe and cultivated in gardens, is well known for its\r\nrefreshing odor. The latter, however, is very difficult to extract and\r\nis yielded only to the method of absorption (enfleurage). The true odor\r\nof reseda, owing to the mode of its preparation, is very expensive, and\r\nfor this reason nearly all perfumes sold under this name are produced\r\nfrom other aromatic substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODIUM.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Lignum Rhodii; _French_—Bois de rose; _German_—Rosenholz.\r\n\r\nThis is derived from two climbing plants, Convolvulus scoparius and\r\nConvolvulus floridus, indigenous to the Canary islands, and is the root\r\nwood of these plants. Its odor resembles that of the rose, and the wood\r\nis frequently used for cheap sachets and for the extraction of the\r\ncontained essential oil which was formerly (before oil of rose geranium\r\nwas made on the large scale) employed for the adulteration of genuine\r\noil of rose.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Rosa; _French_—Rose; _German_—Rosenblüthen.\r\n\r\nHorticulture has produced innumerable varieties from wild species\r\nof roses, which differ in size, form, color, as well as in odor. We\r\ninstance here only the various odors exhaled by tea roses and moss\r\nroses. Accordingly, perfumers likewise distinguish different odors of\r\nroses. Cultivated on a large scale exclusively for the extraction of\r\nthe essential oil, we find different varieties of roses in India, in\r\nEuropean Turkey (Rosa Damascena), in Persia, and in Southern France.\r\nIn this country (U. S.), too, oil of roses could be manufactured with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe wild rose, sweet brier, French églantine, possesses a delicate\r\nbut very fugitive odor, and therefore the perfume sold as wild rose\r\nis usually prepared from other substances with the addition of oil of\r\nroses. The same remark applies to the odor called “white rose” and to\r\nthose sold as “tea rose,” “moss rose,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSEMARY.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Rosmarinus officinalis; _French_—Romarin; _German_—Rosmarin.\r\n\r\nThis plant, indigenous to Southern and Central Europe, contains pretty\r\nlarge quantities of an aromatic oil in its leaves and flowers; the\r\noil has a refreshing odor and therefore is frequently added in small\r\namounts to fine perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Ruta graveolens; _French_—Rue; _German_—Raute.\r\n\r\nThis plant, cultivated in our gardens and also growing wild here, has\r\nlong been employed for its strong odor; in perfumery rue, in a dry\r\nstate as well as its oil, is occasionally used.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Salvia officinalis; _French_—Sauge; _German_—Salbei.\r\n\r\nAll varieties of sage, the one named being found most frequently\r\ngrowing wild in the meadows of Southern Europe, and extensively\r\ncultivated in Europe and in this country, possess a very agreeable,\r\nrefreshing odor which adheres for a long time even to the dried leaves;\r\nthese are therefore very suitable for sachets, tooth powders, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTAL WOOD.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Santalum album; _French_—Santal; _German_—Santalholz.\r\n\r\nThe tree from which this wood is derived is indigenous to Eastern Asia,\r\nto the Sunda Islands. The wood is soft, very fragrant, and is also\r\nerroneously called sandal wood. The latter is of a dark reddish-brown\r\ncolor, not fragrant, and is derived from Pterocarpus santalinus, a\r\ntree indigenous to Southern India, and the Philippine Islands; it is\r\nof value to the dyer and the cabinet-maker, but to the perfumer only\r\nfor coloring some tinctures. For the purposes of perfumery use can be\r\nmade only of santal wood (white or yellow santal wood) which possesses\r\na very pleasant odor resembling that of oil of rose. Formerly essential\r\noil of santal was employed for the adulteration of oil of rose. White\r\nand yellow santal wood comes from the same tree—the former from the\r\nsmaller trunks of Santalum album.\r\n\r\n\r\nSASSAFRAS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Lignum Sassafras; _French_—Sassafras; _German_—Sassafrasholz.\r\n\r\nSassafras wood, derived from the root of the American tree Sassafras\r\nofficinalis, appears in commerce in large bundles. It has a strong\r\npeculiar odor; in the bark of the root the odor is even more marked. In\r\nthe European drug trade Sassafras saw dust is also met with, but this\r\nis not rarely mixed with pine saw dust which has been moistened with\r\nfennel water and again dried. In perfumery sassafras wood is less used\r\nfor the manufacture of volatile odors than for scenting soap. Since the\r\nprincipal constituent of oil of sassafras, viz., safrol, has been found\r\nto be contained in the crude oil of Japanese camphor, the latter has to\r\na very large extent taken the place of the natural oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIKENARD.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Nardostachys Jatamansi; _French_—Spic-nard;\r\n_German_—Nardenkraut.\r\n\r\nThis plant, belonging to the Order of Valerianaceæ, which generally\r\npossess a strong and more or less unpleasant odor, forms one of the\r\nmain objects of Oriental perfumery; in the East Indies, where the\r\nplant grows wild on the mountains, the odor is held about in the same\r\nestimation as that of roses, violets, etc., in Europe. Spikenard was\r\nprobably known to the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians, for in the\r\nBible, in the Song of Solomon, we find this plant repeatedly mentioned\r\nand praised for its pleasant odor. As the odor of spikenard is not\r\nappreciated in Europe, the plant is rarely met with in commerce. All\r\nparts of the plant are aromatic, but use is chiefly made of the root,\r\nconsisting of fine fibres which are tied in bundles the thickness of a\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAR-ANISE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Illicium; Semen Anisi stellati; _French_—Badiane;\r\n_German_—Sternanis.\r\n\r\nStar-anise occurs in commerce in the form of eight-chambered capsules,\r\neach compartment containing one glossy seed, and is derived from a\r\nChinese tree, Illicium anisatum. The fruits are brown, woody; the seed\r\nhas a sweetish taste and an odor resembling that of anise. Outside of\r\nperfumery star-anise is used in the manufacture of liqueurs. Recently\r\na drug has appeared in commerce under the name of star-anise which\r\npossesses poisonous qualities, and is derived from another variety of\r\nIllicium (Illicium religiosum). While this may be of no consequence\r\nto the perfumer, it is important to the manufacturer of liqueurs who\r\nalways uses star-anise for fine goods and never oil of anise.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORAX.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Styrax; _French_—Styrax; _German_—Storax.\r\n\r\nThis product which belongs among the balsams is derived from a small\r\ntree, Liquidambar orientalis, and is obtained from the bark by\r\nheating with water, and also by pressure. It forms a viscid mass like\r\nturpentine, has a gray color, a burning sharp taste, an agreeable odor,\r\nand is easily soluble in strong alcohol; but the odor becomes pleasant\r\nonly after the solution is highly diluted. Storax has the peculiar\r\nproperty of binding different, very delicate odors, to render them less\r\nfugitive, and for this reason finds frequent application in perfumery.\r\n\r\nOriental storax should not be confounded with American storax\r\nwhich occurs in commerce under the name of Sweet Gum, Gum Wax, or\r\nLiquidamber, and is derived from Liquidambar styraciflua. It is quite\r\na thick transparent liquid, light yellow, gradually becoming more\r\nand more solid and darker colored, but is often used in place of the\r\nformer, though its odor is less fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMBUL ROOT.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Radix Sumbul; _French_—Soumboul; _German_—Moschuswurzel.\r\n\r\nThe Sumbul plant (Ferula Sumbul), indigenous to Turkestan and\r\nadjoining countries, has a light brown root covered with thin fibres,\r\nwhich has a penetrating odor of musk. Owing to this quality it is\r\nfrequently employed in perfumery, especially for sachets. In commerce\r\na distinction is made between East Indian and Bokharian or Russian\r\nsumbul, due to the different routes by which the article arrives. The\r\nlatter, which possesses the strongest odor, probably because it reaches\r\nthe market in a fresher state, is the most valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET ALMONDS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Amygdala dulcis; _French_—Amandes douces; _German_—Süsse\r\nMandeln.\r\n\r\nThe almond-tree, Amygdalus communis, occurs in two varieties,\r\nundistinguishable by botanical characteristics. One bears sweet,\r\nthe other bitter fruits (comp. Bitter almonds, page 24). Both are\r\nodorless and contain much fixed oil. The special odor of bitter almonds\r\nforms only in consequence of the decomposition of a peculiar body\r\n(amygdalin), present in bitter almonds, when it comes in contact with\r\nwater. Good almonds are full, juicy, light brown, without wrinkles, and\r\nhave a sweet mild taste. A rancid taste characterizes staleness. The\r\nfixed or expressed oil, both that of the sweet and that of the bitter\r\nalmonds (which are identical in taste, odor, and other properties), is\r\nused in perfumery for fine hair oils, ointments, and some fine soft\r\nsoaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET-FLAG ROOT.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Radix Calami; _French_—Racine de glaïeule;\r\n_German_—Calmuswurzel.\r\n\r\nThe calamus root met with in commerce is the creeping root-stock of\r\na plant (Acorus Calamus), occurring in all countries of the northern\r\nhemisphere, and frequent in European and American swamps. The\r\nroot-stock is spongy, about as thick as a finger, many-jointed, and of\r\na yellowish color, with many dark streaks and dots. Inside the color is\r\nreddish-white. The odor is strong and the taste sharp and burning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET-PEA.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Lathyrus tuberosus; _French_—Pois de senteur;\r\n_German_—Platterbsenblüthen.\r\n\r\nSweet-pea flowers, which have a very delicate odor, yield it to the\r\nusual solvents. The odor bears some resemblance to that of orange\r\nflowers, but is rarely used alone; it is generally combined with others\r\nto make it more lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYRINGA.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Philadelphus coronarius; _French_—Seringat, Lilac;\r\n_German_—Pfeifenstrauchblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe white flowers of this garden bush have a very pleasant odor which\r\nresembles that of orange flowers, in place of which it can be used, in\r\nthe cheaper grades of perfumery. This plant which flourishes freely in\r\nour climate deserves more attention by perfumers than it has hitherto\r\nreceived, since it appears to furnish an excellent substitute for the\r\nexpensive oil of orange flowers, as above stated, in cheap perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHYME.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Thymus Serpyllum; _French_—Thym; _German_—Thymian.\r\n\r\nThis well-known aromatic plant, which grows most luxuriantly on a\r\ncalcareous soil, has an odor which is not unpleasant but is in greater\r\ndemand for liqueurs than for perfumes. Here and there, however, it is\r\nemployed for scenting soap. Common thyme, Thymus vulgaris, is used for\r\nthe same purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Oil of Thyme, in the English and American market,\r\nis generally understood the oil of Thymus vulgaris, which is largely\r\ndistilled in the South of France. This oil is commonly misnamed Oil of\r\nOriganum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLU BALSAM.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Balsamum tolutanum; _French_—Beaume de Tolu;\r\n_German_—Tolubalsam.\r\n\r\nThis balsam is derived from a tree indigenous to the northern portion\r\nof South America, Toluifera Balsamum, belonging to the Order of\r\nLeguminosæ. The balsam, which is obtained by incisions into the bark of\r\nthese trees, is at first fluid, but becomes firm in the air owing to\r\nrapid resinification; in commerce it appears in a viscid form ranging\r\nfrom that of Venice turpentine to that of colophony. Its color varies\r\nfrom honey-yellow to reddish-brown; the taste is at first sweet, then\r\nsharp, it softens under the heat of the hand, and when warmed or\r\nsprinkled in powder form on glowing coals it diffuses a very pleasant\r\nodor recalling that of Peru balsam or vanilla. It shares with storax\r\nand Peru balsam the valuable property of fixing volatile odors and is\r\noften employed for this purpose, but is also frequently used alone in\r\nfumigating powders, tooth powders, etc. Adulteration of Tolu balsam\r\nwith Venice turpentine or colophony is not rarely met with.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONKA BEANS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Fabæ Tonkæ; _French_—Fèves de Tonka; _German_—Tonkabohnen,\r\nTonkasamen.\r\n\r\nThe South American tonka tree, Dipteryx odorata, bears almond-shaped\r\ndrupes almost as long as the finger, which contain seeds two to four\r\ncentimetres in length, the so-called tonka beans. These occur in\r\nEuropean commerce in two sorts, the so-called Dutch and English tonka\r\nbeans; the former are large, full, covered externally with a folded\r\nbrown to black skin, and white inside. The latter are barely two-thirds\r\nthe size of the former, almost black, and less glossy. The odor of the\r\ntonka bean is due to a volatile crystalline substance, coumarin, which\r\noften lies on the surface and in the wrinkles of the bean in the form\r\nof delicate, brilliant crystalline needles. Coumarin exists also in\r\nmany other plants, for instance, in sweet woodruff (Asperula odorata),\r\ndeer-tongue (Liatris odoratissima), etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBEROSE.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Polianthus tuberosa; _French_—Tubérose; _German_—Tuberose.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and very fragrant plant is frequently cultivated in\r\nSouthern France; its pleasant odor, however, owing to its great\r\nvolatility, can never be used pure, but must always be fixed with one\r\nof the above-mentioned balsams. As has been stated in connection with\r\nseveral aromatic plants, tuberose could be grown in our southern States\r\nwith advantage for the extraction of its odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLA.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Vanilla aromatica, Vanilla planifolia; _French_—Vanille;\r\n_German_—Vanille.\r\n\r\nThe vanilla, which may justly be called a king among aromatic plants,\r\nis a climbing orchid indigenous to tropical America. It is cultivated\r\non a most extensive scale on the islands of Reunion and Mauritius;\r\nlargely also in Mexico, and in some other countries. The agreeable odor\r\nis present in the fruit. These form three-lobed capsules about the\r\nlength of a lead pencil and the thickness of a quill. Externally they\r\nare glossy brown, have a fatty feel, and show in the depression a white\r\npowder which appears crystalline under a lens. Internally good fresh\r\nvanilla is so oily that it stains the fingers on being crushed and is\r\nfilled with numerous shining seeds the size of a small pin’s head.\r\nThese properties, together with the plump appearance and great weight,\r\nmark good qualities. Old vanilla, whose odor is fainter and less\r\nfragrant, may be recognized by its wrinkled surface, the absence of\r\nthe white dust, the slight weight, and the bent ends of the capsules.\r\nFraudulent dealers endeavor to give such old goods a fresher appearance\r\nby coating them with almond oil or Peru balsam. “Vanilla de Leg” is\r\nrecognized as the first quality of Mexican vanilla. Like most odors,\r\nthat of vanilla does not become pleasant until it is sufficiently\r\ndiluted.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERBENA.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Verbena triphylla, Aloysia citriodora; _French_—Verveine;\r\n_German_—Verbenakraut.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this Peruvian plant, especially on being rubbed between\r\nthe fingers, exhale a very pleasant odor which is due to an essential\r\noil. The odor resembles that of fine citrons, or rather that of lemon\r\ngrass; hence these two odors are frequently mistaken for each other.\r\nOwing to the high price of true oil of verbena, all the perfumes\r\nsold under this name are prepared from oil of lemon grass (see under\r\nCitronella) and other essential oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nVETIVER.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Andropogon muricatus; _French_—Vétyver; _German_—Vetiverwurzel.\r\n\r\nVetiver, also called cuscus, and sometimes iwarankusa (though this\r\nis more properly the name of Andropogon lanifer; see above, under\r\nCitronella), is the fibrous root-stock of a grass indigenous to India,\r\nwhere fragrant mats are woven from it. The odor of the root somewhat\r\nresembles that of santal wood, and is used partly alone, partly for\r\nfixing volatile perfumes. Shavings of the root are frequently employed\r\nfor filling sachet bags.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Viola odorata; _French_—Violette; _German_—Veilchenblüthen.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful fragrance of the March violet is due to an essential oil\r\nwhich it is, however, difficult to extract. For this reason genuine\r\nperfume of violets, really prepared from the flowers, is among the\r\nmost expensive odors, and the high-priced so-called violet perfumes are\r\ngenerally mixtures of other fine odors, while the cheaper grades are\r\nmade from orris root.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLKAMERIA.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Volkameria inermis, often cultivated in conservatories, has\r\na very agreeable odor. The perfume called by this name, however, is\r\nnot obtained from the plant, but is produced by the mixture of several\r\naromatic extracts from other plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLFLOWER.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Cheiranthus Cheiri; _French_—Giroflé; _German_—Levkojenblüthen,\r\nGoldlack.\r\n\r\nThe wallflower, a well-known biennial garden plant belonging to the\r\nOrder of Cruciferæ, according to recent experiments yields a very fine\r\nodor to certain substances and may be employed in the manufacture of\r\nquite superior perfumes. The preparations usually sold as wallflower,\r\nhowever, are not made from the flowers of this plant, but are mixtures\r\nof different odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTERGREEN.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Gaultheria procumbens; _French_—Gaulthérie;\r\n_German_—Wintergrünblätter.\r\n\r\nThis herbaceous plant, indigenous to North America, especially Canada\r\nand the Northern and Middle United States, where it grows wild in large\r\nquantities, has a very pleasant odor due to an essential oil and a\r\ncompound ether which can also be produced artificially. The odor of\r\nwintergreen serves chiefly for scenting fine soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nYLANG-YLANG.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Unona odoratissima, indigenous to the Philippine Islands,\r\ncontains an exceedingly fragrant oil. It is brought into commerce from\r\nManilla.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOwing to climatic relations, it is impossible for the perfumer to\r\nprocure all the above-enumerated substances in the fresh state; many\r\nof them he is forced to purchase through the drug trade, and he should\r\nbear in mind to give the preference always to the freshest obtainable\r\ngoods. At times it is not possible to utilize the materials at once\r\nfor the extraction of the odors and they must be kept for some time.\r\nThe vegetable substances should always be stored in an airy, not over\r\ndry room; and the material should be often inspected. If a trace of\r\nmouldiness shows itself, the material must be worked at once, since,\r\nif the mould is allowed to go on, the fragrance will suffer and may be\r\ndestroyed altogether.\r\n\r\nThe aromatic substances here enumerated are those which have actually\r\nfound general employment in perfumery; but the list is not complete,\r\nsince every aromatic plant can be used for the extraction of its\r\nodor. Of course, this is connected with some difficulties, but even\r\nin the present state of our knowledge they can all be overcome. When\r\na new odor has been prepared, the art of the perfumer consists in\r\nascertaining by many experiments those substances which harmonize with\r\nit; for with few exceptions the finest grades of perfumes are not\r\nsingle odors but combinations of several which are in accord.\r\n\r\nEven among our domestic plants there are numerous finds to be made by\r\nthe perfumer, and in this respect we refer particularly to some very\r\nfragrant kinds of orchids in our woods and to the delightful odor of\r\nthe lily of the valley. As to the latter, a perfume is met with in\r\ncommerce under this name, but its odor bears no resemblance to that of\r\nthe flower.\r\n\r\nA few facts appear to us of especial importance. In practical perfumery\r\nmany of the plants which are easily obtainable in large quantities,\r\nsuch as the flowers of clover and trefoil, the primrose, the rock-rose\r\n(Daphne Cneorum), dame’s-violet (Hesperis matronalis), and others\r\nabove named, have never been employed. As an actual curiosity we may\r\nstate that there is thus far no perfume containing the delightful odor\r\npresent in the flowers of the linden-tree, of the Robinia (erroneously\r\ncalled Acacia), of the lilac, etc., at least not made from the plants\r\nhere named.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ANIMAL SUBSTANCES USED IN PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the vegetable kingdom offers us an abundance of aromatic odors\r\nthe end of which it is impossible to foresee, the animal kingdom\r\ncontains absolutely no substance which may be called sweet-scented in\r\nthe strict sense of the term. If we find nevertheless a few animal\r\nsubstances generally used in perfumery, they should be considered\r\nrather as excellent means for fixing subtle vegetable odors than as\r\nfragrant bodies in the true sense. By themselves, indeed, they have\r\nan odor, but to most persons it is not agreeable even if properly\r\ndiluted. Thus far only five substances of animal origin are employed in\r\nperfumery, namely: ambergris, castor, hyraceum, musk, and civet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBERGRIS.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Ambra grisea; _French_—Ambregris; _German_—Ambra.\r\n\r\nThis is a substance whose origin is still doubtful; many facts\r\nindicate that it is a secretion—whether normal or morbid may be left\r\nundecided—of the largest living mammal, namely, of the pot-whale\r\n(Physeter macrocephalus). Ambergris is found in the intestines of this\r\nanimal or, more frequently, floating about in the sea; the shores of\r\nthe continents bordering the Indian Ocean furnish the largest amount of\r\nthis peculiar substance.\r\n\r\nAmbergris is a grayish-white fatty substance which occurs in commerce\r\nin pieces of various sizes—those as large as a fist are rare—of a\r\npenetrating, decidedly disagreeable odor. It is soluble in alcohol, and\r\nwhen properly diluted the odor becomes pleasant and it is so permanent\r\nthat a piece of linen moistened with it smells of it even after being\r\nwashed with soap. By itself, ambergris is not much used; it finds its\r\nchief application in combination with other odors or as an addition to\r\nsome perfumes in order to make them lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTOR.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Castoreum; _French_—Castoreum; _German_—Castoreum.\r\n\r\nThis is a secretion of the beaver (Castor fiber); it accumulates in two\r\npear-shaped bags on the abdomen of the animal, both male and female.\r\nThe hunters remove these bags from the body of the dead animal and in\r\nthis form they are brought into commerce. These sacs are the length of\r\na finger, at the thickest point the diameter of a thumb, and contain\r\na greasy mass of yellowish-brown, reddish-brown, or blackish color,\r\naccording to the nourishment of the animal. This mass constitutes\r\ncastor; it has a strong, disagreeable odor, a bitter, balsamic taste,\r\nbecomes soft when heated, is combustible, and almost entirely soluble\r\nin alcohol. It is probable that this secretion in its composition\r\nhas some relation to the nourishment of the beavers which feed by\r\npreference on resinous vegetable substances. In commerce Canadian and\r\nSiberian castor are distinguished; the latter is more valuable and has\r\nalmost disappeared from the market. It possesses a peculiar tarry,\r\nRussian-leather odor, probably due to a substance present in birch\r\nbark, upon which the Siberian animals feed almost exclusively. Canadian\r\ncastor has an odor more nearly resembling pine resin. In perfumery\r\ncastor is rarely used, usually only for fixing other odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYRACEUM.\r\n\r\nThe substance occurring in commerce under this name, the excrement of\r\nan animal found in Capeland, the rock badger or rock rabbit (Hyrax\r\ncapensis), is very similar in its properties to castor, and according\r\nto comparative experiments made by us can be used in place of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSK.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Moschus; _French_—Musc; _German_—Moschus.\r\n\r\nOf animal substances, musk is most frequently used in perfumery, and\r\npossesses the most agreeable odor of them all. Moreover, the odor of\r\nmusk is the most intense that we know, actually imponderable quantities\r\nof it being sufficient to impart to a large body of air the strong odor\r\nof musk. This substance is derived from a deer which attains the size\r\nof a small goat and, like the chamois of the Alps, lives on the highest\r\nmountains of the Himalayas. Only the male animal (Moschus moschiferus)\r\nproduces musk, which is secreted in a sac or rather gland near the\r\nsexual organ. Musk being subject to the worst adulterations owing to\r\nits high price, we append a description of the substance as well as of\r\nthe sac or bag in which it appears in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe musk bag cut by the hunter from the body of the animal has the size\r\nand shape of half a walnut. On the side by which it was attached to the\r\nbody of the animal it is membranous and nearly smooth; on the external\r\nsurface it is more or less hemispherical and covered with light brown\r\nor dark brown hair, according to the season at which the animal was\r\nkilled. The hair assumes a circular arrangement around an opening\r\nsituated in the centre of the bag. This opening, the efferent duct\r\nof the gland, is formed by a ring-shaped muscle which yields to the\r\npressure of a pointed object and permits the introduction of the point\r\nof the finger. Internally the musk bag consists of several layers of\r\nmembrane which surround the musk itself. It is probable that the musk\r\nis secreted by these membranes, for when the animal is dissected, no\r\ndirect communication of the musk gland with the body can be detected.\r\n\r\nIt has been surmised that the secretion of musk bears some relation\r\nto the food; at least it has been asserted that the animals eat,\r\namong other things, sumbul root with great avidity; and this root, it\r\nwill be remembered, has a very intense odor of musk. However, though\r\nthis appears probable at first sight, it is contradicted by the fact\r\nthat the females and the young males likewise eat the root without\r\nmanifesting any odor of musk nor do they secrete the substance, while\r\nthe older males produce it even when they are fed with hay only.\r\nAnother fact is of interest, namely, that other ruminants, too, for\r\ninstance, cattle, diffuse a marked though faint odor of musk which\r\noccurs also in their excrements, exactly as in the case of the musk\r\ndeer. Alligators likewise produce a musk-like substance which has\r\nactually been made use of in place of musk for coarser purposes.\r\n\r\nThe musk present in the glands differs in appearance with the season\r\nand the age of the animal. Musk deers killed in spring have in their\r\nmusk bag an unctuous soft mass of a reddish-brown color with the\r\nstrongest odor; at other seasons the mass is darker in color, almost\r\nblack, and granular; the size of the grains ranges from that of a\r\nmillet-seed to that of a large pea.\r\n\r\nThat the secretion of musk belongs to the sexual functions appears\r\nprobable from the fact that it can be found only in the bags of males\r\nmore than two years old; that of younger animals contains only a\r\nsubstance of a milky consistence, whose odor has no resemblance to that\r\nof musk. The quantity of musk present in a bag varies with the season\r\nand the age of the animal; the smallest quantity may be assumed at\r\nabout six drachms, though some bags contain as much as one and a half\r\nounces.\r\n\r\nThe hunters dry the bags either on hot stones or in the air, or they\r\ndip them into hot oil. In commerce musk occurs either in bags under the\r\nname moschus in vesicis, “musk in pods,” or free, moschus in granis,\r\nmoschus ex vesicis, “grain musk.” According to its origin four sorts\r\nare distinguished: Chinese or Tonquin musk, Siberian or Russian musk,\r\nAssam or Bengal musk, and finally Bokharian musk. The latter two\r\nvarieties, however, rarely reach this market. Chinese musk (Tonquin or\r\nThibet musk) occurs in small boxes containing twenty to thirty bags,\r\neach wrapped in Chinese tissue paper; on which Chinese characters\r\nare printed. This is considered the best quality. Assam musk occurs\r\nin boxes lined with tin which contain as many as two hundred or more\r\nbags; its value is about two-thirds that of the former. Russian musk\r\nis packed in various ways and is worth about one-fourth that of the\r\nChinese; a special variety of it, of a weaker and rather urinous odor,\r\nis known as Cabardine musk; of least value is Bokharian musk which is\r\nof a grayish black color, with a faint odor.\r\n\r\nMusk is adulterated in an almost incredible manner; at times so-called\r\nmusk bags are met with which are artificially constructed of animal\r\nmembranes and filled with dried blood, earth, etc., and slightly\r\nscented with genuine musk. But even the genuine musk bags are often\r\ntampered with; musk being removed from the opening and the space filled\r\nwith earth, dried blood, animal excrement, or perhaps pieces of copper\r\nand lead.\r\n\r\nPure musk reacts quite characteristically toward caustic alkalies such\r\nas caustic potash and soda or solution of ammonia, and these substances\r\nare used for testing the purity of musk. If a dilute alkaline solution\r\nis poured over musk, a marked increase of the odor is observed after\r\na short time; if the alkaline solution is concentrated or hot, the\r\nodor of musk disappears completely and the fluid develops the caustic\r\nodor of pure ammonia. Hot water dissolves about eighty per cent of\r\nthe total weight of musk; strong alcohol dissolves about one-tenth\r\nof it; when heated in an open porcelain capsule, musk burns with a\r\ndisgusting empyreumatic odor and leaves a considerable amount of ash,\r\nabout one-tenth of its weight. Besides the above-named substances which\r\ndestroy the musk odor by the decomposition of the aromatic constituent,\r\nthere are other bodies, whose action we do not know at present, which\r\nhave the peculiar property of completely extinguishing this most\r\npenetrating of all odors: to deodorize a vessel completely which has\r\ncontained musk, it is sufficient to rub in it some bitter almonds\r\nmoistened with water or some camphor with alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn an extremely dilute condition musk is used for perfuming the finest\r\nsoaps and sachets, and even in the manufacture of the most expensive\r\nand best perfumes, owing to its property of imparting permanence\r\nto very volatile odors. In the last-mentioned class, however, the\r\nquantity of musk must always be so small that its presence is not\r\ndistinctly observed, since many persons find the pure odor of musk\r\nvery disagreeable, while they praise the fragrance of such perfumes as\r\ncontain an amount of this substance too small to be perceived by the\r\nolfactory nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVET.\r\n\r\n_Latin_—Civetta; _French_—Civette; _German_—Zibeth.\r\n\r\nThis substance bears some resemblance to musk with reference to its\r\nderivation and the rôle it plays in the life of the animal from which\r\nit is obtained. The Viverridæ, a class of carnivora related to the\r\ncats and weasels, found in Asia and Africa, furnish this substance.\r\nIt is obtained chiefly from the civet cat (Viverra Civetta) and the\r\nmusk rat (Viverra Zibetha) which are kept in captivity for the purpose\r\nof abstracting from them from time to time the civet which is always\r\nformed anew.\r\n\r\nCivet is the secretion of a double gland present both in the male and\r\nthe female near the sexual organs. Fresh civet is a whitish-yellow mass\r\nof the consistence of butter or fat, and becomes thicker and darker\r\non exposure to the air. Similar to musk, it has a strong odor which\r\nbecomes pleasant on being diluted and is used both alone and for fixing\r\nother odors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS USED IN PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of perfumery a considerable number of chemical\r\nproducts find application; in this place, however, we shall describe\r\nonly those which are used very frequently and generally, and discuss\r\nthe characteristics of those employed more rarely in connection with\r\nthe articles of perfumery into which they enter. According to their\r\napplication we may divide these substances into several groups, namely:\r\n\r\nA. Chemicals which, without themselves serving as perfumes, are used\r\nexclusively for the extraction of odors.\r\n\r\nB. Chemicals which, while not fragrant, are frequently employed in the\r\npreparation of perfumes. Under this head we have included also those\r\nsubstances which are not strictly chemical products, but originally\r\ncome from the animal or vegetable kingdom, such as fats, spermaceti,\r\nand wax, yet cannot be used in perfumery unless they have undergone a\r\nprocess of chemical purification.\r\n\r\nC. Chemical products used for coloring perfumes, so-called dye-stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the substances to be here described it will\r\nhardly be the province of the perfumer to prepare himself, as they are\r\nfurnished by chemical factories at low prices; but some of them—for\r\ninstance, sublimed, natural benzoic acid suitable for perfumery and a\r\nfew other substances—the perfumer should make himself, in order to be\r\nsure of its genuineness. Therefore, while in the former class it will\r\nbe sufficient to describe their properties to enable the manufacturer\r\nto distinguish good quality from bad, the latter class must be\r\ndiscussed at greater length.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Chemicals used for the Extraction of Aromatic Substances.\r\n\r\nFor the extraction of aromatic substances from plants a number of\r\nbodies are used which possess great solvent power for essential oils,\r\nand are besides very volatile, or have a low boiling-point. These are\r\nparticularly ether, chloroform, petroleum ether, and bisulphide of\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHER.\r\n\r\nThis liquid, in commerce also called sulphuric ether, is made in large\r\nquantities in chemical laboratories by the distillation of alcohol with\r\nsulphuric acid, followed by a second distillation or rectification.\r\nWhen pure, ether forms a mobile, thin, strong-smelling, and inflammable\r\nliquid which when inhaled produces insensibility, for which reason it\r\nis used as an anæsthetic in surgery. Its specific gravity is about\r\n0.720 when anhydrous, and its boiling-point 35° C. (95° F.). It forms\r\nan excellent solvent for essential oils, resins, fats, and similar\r\nbodies. Owing to its great volatility, its vapors are quickly diffused\r\nin the air, and, as they are very inflammable, lights must be kept away\r\nfrom a bottle containing this substance. The same remark applies to\r\nmost of the substances to be presently described.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROFORM\r\n\r\nis prepared by the distillation of chlorinated lime, alcohol, and\r\nwater, acetone being more recently substituted for the alcohol,\r\nfollowed by rectification of the product. When inhaled it produces\r\ninsensibility like ether. It has a pleasant odor and sweet taste. Its\r\nspecific gravity is about 1.49 and its boiling-point 61° C. (142° F.).\r\nOwing to its great solvent power and low boiling-point, chloroform is\r\nlargely used for the extraction of aromatic vegetable substances; it\r\ndoes not take fire directly in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM ETHER.\r\n\r\nPetroleum, which is brought into commerce in immense quantities,\r\nespecially from Pennsylvania, for illuminating purposes, cannot be used\r\nin its crude state, but requires rectification. Petroleum as it issues\r\nfrom the earth consists of various hydrocarbons mixed together, some of\r\nwhich have very low boiling-points, so that their vapors readily take\r\nfire and would make the use of petroleum in lamps dangerous. Petroleum,\r\ntherefore, is heated in large apparatuses to about 70 or 80° C. (158 to\r\n176° F.), when the more volatile products pass over, and the petroleum\r\nfor illuminating purposes remains in the stills. A certain fraction\r\nof the volatile distillate, the so-called petroleum ether, is largely\r\nused in the manufacture of varnishes. Owing to its great solvent power\r\nfor aromatic vegetable substances and its low price, petroleum ether\r\nhas become quite an important body for the extraction of perfumes,\r\nwhich will be further discussed hereafter. Good petroleum ether is\r\ncolorless, has a peculiar, not unpleasant odor and a boiling-point\r\nbetween 50 and 55° C. (112° and 131° F.).\r\n\r\n\r\nBENZIN\r\n\r\nis a common name for another fraction of the volatile distillate from\r\npetroleum, viz., that which boils between 50° and 60°C. (122° to 140°\r\nF.) and has a spec. grav. of 0.670 to 0.675°.\r\n\r\nThis liquid, which is also used as a volatile solvent for the\r\nextraction of odorous substances, must not be confounded with Benzene\r\nor Benzol, a distillate from coal tar, boiling at about 80° C. (176°\r\nF.) and having a spec. grav. of 0.878. The latter is not used for the\r\nextraction of perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISULPHIDE OF CARBON.\r\n\r\nThis is made by conducting vapors of sulphur over glowing charcoal\r\nor coke. The vapors of bisulphide of carbon thus formed are led into\r\nvessels filled with ice or ice-cold water, where they condense.\r\nBisulphide of carbon is a colorless liquid, heavier than water and very\r\nrefractive. It is inflammable, and possesses a peculiar odor which\r\nis not disagreeable if the liquid has been thoroughly purified. Its\r\nboiling-point is about 45° C. (113° F.) and it has great solvent power.\r\nAt the present time, the market affords bisulphide of carbon of a high\r\ndegree of purity.\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers who prepare their odors by extraction, may find it\r\nadvantageous to make also the bisulphide of carbon necessary for it,\r\nand this is best done in Gérard’s apparatus (Fig. 1). It consists of\r\na cast-iron cylinder _a_, two metres high and one metre in diameter.\r\nThis cylinder is heated on the outer surface in an oven, and two tubes,\r\n_c_ and _d_, are attached to it. Tube _d_ is connected by _e_ with\r\nthe hemispherical vessel _b_ which is connected by the tube _i_ with\r\nthe condenser _mlk_. The condenser is formed of three cylinders made\r\nof sheet zinc which are surrounded with cold water. The condensed\r\nliquid escapes into the vessel _p_, while the gaseous products pass\r\nthrough _n_ into the chimney. The cylinder _a_ is filled with about\r\n1,500 pounds of charcoal or coke in small pieces, after which it is\r\nclosed and all tubes are carefully luted with clay; _a_ is then heated\r\nto a strong red heat and at intervals of three minutes 3 pounds of\r\nsulphur are thrown in through _c_. In twenty-four hours, by the use of\r\n478 pounds of sulphur, 568 pounds of crude bisulphide of carbon are\r\nobtained; a portion of the sulphur distils over uncombined into the\r\nvessel _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe crude bisulphide of carbon contains about twelve per cent of\r\nsulphur and other combinations in solution and is redistilled at\r\nexactly 48° C. (118.4° F.) in a steam-heated apparatus with a long exit\r\ntube cooled with ice below and water above. In order to obtain the\r\nbisulphide of carbon absolutely pure, which is essential to render it\r\nsuitable for extraction, it is again distilled at the same temperature,\r\nwith the addition of two per cent of palm oil. As the vapors of\r\nbisulphide of carbon are injurious to the organism, the vessels\r\ncontaining it must always be kept well closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Chemical Products used for the Preparation of Perfumes.\r\n\r\nAmong all the substances belonging under this head, there is one\r\nwhich plays a prominent part in the manufacture of most perfumes. In\r\nhandkerchief perfumes it is one of the most important substances, as\r\nit forms not only the greatest bulk, but the perfection of the perfume\r\ndepends upon its quality. This substance is—\r\n\r\n\r\nALCOHOL,\r\n\r\nalso called spirit of wine; French, esprit de vin; the well-known\r\ncombustible liquid formed by the alcoholic fermentation of sugar,\r\nwhich is made on a large scale in extensive distilleries. Alcohol is a\r\nthin, mobile liquid with an aromatic odor. The usual “strong” alcohol\r\nof the market contains about ninety-four per cent of absolute alcohol\r\nby volume. This has a specific gravity of 0·820. Its boiling-point is\r\n78·2° C. (172·40 F.), and it congeals at a very low temperature, below\r\n-100° C. Alcohol possesses great solvent power for resins, balsams, and\r\nessential oils.\r\n\r\nThese properties, however, belong only to the commercial stronger or\r\nso-called “druggists’ alcohol,” and more particularly to a very pure\r\nquality of it, as free as possible from fusel-oil compounds, known as\r\ncologne spirit. As absolute alcohol is also necessary for the purposes\r\nof perfumery, we shall briefly describe its preparation.\r\n\r\nIn order to make absolute alcohol, sulphate of copper is heated in a\r\nretort until it has changed into a white powder. After the powder has\r\ncooled in the covered retort, it is at once introduced into a large\r\nglass bottle; over it is poured the strongest obtainable alcohol (96%\r\nTralles) which must be free from fusel oil; then the bottle is closed\r\nair-tight and repeatedly shaken. The sulphate of copper which has lost\r\nits water of crystallization by the heat reabsorbs it from the alcohol\r\nand again becomes blue and crystalline. Generally four pounds of\r\nsulphate of copper are used for ten quarts of alcohol; when white burnt\r\nsulphate of copper after long contact with alcohol still remains white,\r\nthe alcohol is proved to be practically anhydrous (it may still contain\r\nabout two per cent of water).\r\n\r\nLarger quantities of absolute alcohol are made in a copper still\r\ncontaining fused anhydrous chloride of calcium in small pieces. The\r\napparatus is closed and alcohol of 94 to 95% is poured in through a\r\ntubulure. The mixture often grows so warm that the alcohol begins to\r\npass over, so that but little heat need be applied to make the absolute\r\nalcohol distil over.\r\n\r\nAbsolute alcohol obtained in this way—for by repeated distillation\r\nwe get at most an alcohol of 96%—abstracts water from the air with\r\navidity; hence it must be preserved in air-tight vessels which should\r\ncontain a small amount of anhydrous sulphate of copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nStrong commercial alcohol contains varying amounts of water—from four\r\nto twenty parts by volume (96 to 80% alcohol); at the present time,\r\nhowever, it is always customary for dealers in this country to supply\r\nthe officinal alcohol of 94%, when “strong alcohol” is called for.\r\nIts strength is measured by an areometer which sinks in proportion to\r\nthe purity of the alcohol; the alcoholometer of Tralles or volumeter\r\nshows at once on its scale how many parts by volume of absolute\r\nalcohol (volume per cent) are contained in 100 volumes of alcohol. The\r\nadjoining figure (Fig. 2) shows Tralles’ alcoholometer, with the vessel\r\nin which the test is made. The readings of the instrument, however,\r\nare correct only at a temperature of 15·6° C. (60° F.), the so-called\r\nnormal temperature; at a higher or lower point they must be corrected\r\naccording to the tables appended.\r\n\r\nAt temperatures below the normal, the amount of alcohol is greater than\r\nthe areometer indicates, hence a percentage must be added; at higher\r\ntemperatures a percentage must be deducted.\r\n\r\n TABLES FOR FINDING THE TRUE PERCENTAGE BY VOLUME, AT THE NORMAL\r\n TEMPERATURE OF 60° F., OF ALCOHOL OF ANY STRENGTH, WHEN TESTED AT\r\n TEMPERATURES BELOW OR ABOVE 60° F.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.—FOR TEMPERATURES UNDER 60° F.\r\n\r\n  ————————+———————————--+\r\n  Per cent|    Number   |\r\n     of   |of F.

The\r\n difference between 45 and 60° F. is 15. Opposite to 40 will be found\r\n the figure 4·5. For every 4·5 degrees F. below 60° there must be added\r\n 1 to the alcoholic percentage. Hence for 15 degrees there must be\r\n added 3.3 degrees. The alcoholic percentage, by volume, therefore, is\r\n 43·3 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.—FOR TEMPERATURES ABOVE 60° F.\r\n\r\n  ————————+————————-———-\r\n  Per cent|   Number\r\n     of   |of F.

The variety of fusel oil differs with the raw material from which\r\nthe alcohol was made; there is a potato fusel oil (chemically amyl\r\nalcohol), a corn fusel oil, a beet fusel oil, wine fusel oil (œnanthic\r\nether), etc. Fusel oils, being themselves odorous substances, exert an\r\ninfluence on the fragrance of the perfume; hence it is a general rule\r\nin perfumery to use only alcohol free from fusel oil; that is, such\r\nfrom which the fusel oil has been extracted as far as possible by means\r\nof fresh charcoal. So-called “Cologne Spirit” of the best quality is,\r\nas a rule, practically free from it.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, some essential oils or aromatic substances in general,\r\ndevelop their finest odors only when the perfumes are prepared with an\r\nalcohol from a certain source. While the charcoal treatment removes\r\nalmost all the fusel oil, the remaining traces suffice to act as\r\nodorous substances in the true sense of the term and to produce with\r\nother aromatic bodies a harmony of the odor which can never be reached\r\nby the use of another variety of alcohol. To give but a single instance\r\nwe may state that all the citron odors known in perfumery develop the\r\nfinest aroma only when dissolved in alcohol made from wine and the\r\nsolution is then distilled. The world-renowned eau de Cologne is made\r\nin this way; the other aromatic substances contained in it are added to\r\nthe distillate from the spirit of wine and the citron oils; any cologne\r\nmade in another manner or with another alcohol has a less fine odor.\r\nWhile the citron odors require true spirit of wine for the development\r\nof their full aroma, other scents require beet or corn alcohol to bring\r\nout their best odor. Jasmine, tuberose, orange flowers, violet, etc.,\r\nand all animal odors (ambergris, musk, and civet) belong to the latter\r\nclass. For this remarkable and to the perfumer most important fact we\r\nknow no other explanation than that traces of fusel oils present even\r\nin rectified alcohol take part in the general impression made on the\r\nolfactory nerves, acting as true aromatic substances.\r\n\r\nCologne spirit is expensive, but this should not be a reason for\r\naccepting a cheaper grade, with which it would be absolutely impossible\r\nto make really fine perfumes.\r\n\r\nAlcohol is also generally used for the direct extraction of odorous\r\nsubstances from plants, as will be seen in the description of the\r\nprocesses employed in the preparation of the so-called essences or\r\nextracts. For these purposes, too, the best cologne spirit only\r\nshould be used, that is, alcohol which has been freed from fusel oil\r\nand redistilled, for in no other way can the aromatic substances be\r\nobtained in the greatest possible purity. And this is indispensable\r\nfor the preparation of really fine perfumes, for we do not hesitate\r\nto say that French and English perfumes have acquired their deserved\r\nreputation mainly through the great care exercised in the selection of\r\ntheir raw materials, and especially of the alcohol used for extraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLOXAN.\r\n\r\nThis preparation, which is used in making a fine skin cosmetic, is\r\nmanufactured in chemical laboratories from uric acid heated with nitric\r\nacid. Alloxan is a crystalline colorless body which has the property\r\nof gradually producing a red tint on the skin and finds employment for\r\nthis reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIA.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a gas formed by the decomposition of nitrogenous substances,\r\nbut chiefly obtained, on a large scale, from the so-called “gas\r\nliquor” of gas works. By itself it develops a very disagreeable odor\r\nand stimulates the lachrymal glands to secretion—a fact which can\r\nbe verified in any stable. A solution of the gas (water of ammonia;\r\nliquor ammoniæ) possesses the same properties. In perfumery ammonia is\r\nnever used alone, but only in combination with other odors, namely,\r\nin the manufacture of smelling salts (French: sels volatils; German:\r\nRiechsalze), which are much in favor in England and in this country.\r\nFor the purposes of the perfumer, the greater part of the commercial\r\nammonia is unsuitable owing to its tarry odor. Pure ammonia is best\r\nprepared by heating equal parts of quicklime and powdered sal-ammoniac\r\nin a retort, and conducting the generated gas into water which\r\ndissolves it with avidity, one quart of water dissolving more than\r\nseven hundred quarts of ammonia gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONATE OF AMMONIA,\r\n\r\na combination of ammonia with carbonic acid, occurs in commerce in\r\nlarge transparent lumps, often covered with a white dust of bicarbonate\r\nof ammonia, which in the air continually develop ammonia and therefore\r\nalways smell of it. This commercial product is, as a rule, sufficiently\r\npure to be used in perfumery; as to its application the same remarks\r\napply as were made under the head of ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF BITTER ALMONDS (OLEUM AMYGDALÆ AMARÆ).\r\n\r\nThis is made from bitter almonds, previously deprived of fatty oil by\r\npressure, which are mixed with an equal weight of water and set in a\r\nwarm place. The amygdalin undergoes decomposition into sugar, hydrogen\r\ncyanide, and benzoyl hydride or oil of bitter almonds. After one or two\r\ndays the mass is distilled; the distillate being a colorless liquid,\r\ncontaining, besides oil of bitter almonds, hydrogen cyanide or prussic\r\nacid, one of the most virulent poisons, from which it must be freed.\r\nThis is done by shaking the liquid repeatedly with dilute solution of\r\npotassa, followed by agitation with water. Pure oil of bitter almonds\r\nis not poisonous, but has a very strong narcotic odor of bitter\r\nalmonds, which, however, becomes most marked when largely diluted with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENZOIC ACID (ACIDUM BENZOICUM).\r\n\r\nThis acid, contained in benzoin, is made also synthetically from other\r\nmaterials, in chemical laboratories. When pure it forms needle-shaped\r\ncrystals having a silky gloss; they have a peculiar acrid taste, but no\r\nodor. Synthetic benzoic acid is worthless to the perfumer; in his art\r\nhe can use only a benzoic acid made from gum benzoin by sublimation,\r\nbecause it contains a very aromatic essential oil for which the acid\r\nis merely the vehicle and which can also be employed alone.\r\n\r\nAs this sublimed benzoic acid is often adulterated with the artificial,\r\nwe advise the manufacturer of perfumery to make his own benzoic acid\r\naccording to the following directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Manufacture of Sublimed Benzoic Acid._\r\n\r\nAbout four pounds of benzoin B of best quality is broken into small\r\npieces and placed in a small copper boiler K (Fig. 3); over its entire\r\nsurface is pasted white blotting paper L, and to this is pasted a cone\r\nof strong paper which must surround the edge of the boiler. The cone\r\nends above in a paper tube R, about five feet long and an inch wide.\r\nThe copper boiler is placed in a large clay pot T (a flower pot) and\r\nsurrounded on all sides with fine sand. The clay pot is heated from\r\nwithout by a charcoal fire. After the pot has remained about half an\r\nhour on the fire, the latter is fanned to its utmost and kept at this\r\npoint for thirty minutes. The heat volatilizes the benzoic acid, the\r\nabove-mentioned essential oil, and some tarry substances of a brown\r\ncolor. The latter are arrested by the filter paper, while the benzoic\r\nacid is deposited on the cone and in the tube, in the form of delicate\r\nglossy needles which are very fragrant owing to the essential oil.\r\nThe largest yield of benzoic acid is obtained when the temperature is\r\nraised very gradually, until finally nothing remains in the copper\r\nboiler but a brown, almost carbonized mass of a blistered appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBORAX (SODII BORAS)\r\n\r\nis used in some preparations. Borax forms colorless crystals which\r\nslightly effloresce in dry air and hence must be preserved in tightly\r\nclosed vessels. Reddish tinted crystals are contaminated with oxide of\r\niron and should be rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMANGANATE OF POTASSIUM (POTASSI PERMANGANAS)\r\n\r\nis a salt formed by fusing a mixture of manganese dioxide, potassa, and\r\npotassium chlorate, extracting the product with water, and evaporating\r\nthe solution to crystallization; the salt is obtained in small dark\r\nviolet, almost black crystals which dissolve in sixteen parts of water\r\nto which they impart a beautiful violet color. By contact with organic\r\nsubstances, or others easily oxidized, the solution changes its color\r\ninto green and finally is decolorized, precipitating a brown powder.\r\nOwing to this change of color the salt has been called chameleon\r\nmineral. As its preparation requires considerable dexterity, it is\r\npreferable to buy it from reputable houses, rather than to make it. It\r\nis used in the manufacture of mouth washes and hair dyes. The solution\r\nof the salt causes brown stains on linen and the skin; they can be\r\nremoved only if the spots are immediately washed with hydrochloric,\r\noxalic, sulphuric, or another acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nACETIC ACID (ACIDUM ACETICUM).\r\n\r\nMuch confusion exists in the literature regarding the strength of\r\nacetic acid when merely called by this name. It is safe to assume\r\nthat, in each country, the term applies to the acid officinal in\r\nits national pharmacopœia as “Acidum Aceticum.” Thus the Austrian\r\nand German pharmacopœias understand by it an acid containing 96% of\r\nabsolute acetic acid, which is practically identical with what is\r\nknown as glacial acetic acid. The latter is, in some pharmacopœias,\r\ndistinguished by a special name: acidum aceticum glaciale, U.S. P.;\r\nacide acétique crystallisable, French Pharm.—In the present work, the\r\nauthor always intended the strong acid of the Austrian pharmacopœia\r\nto be understood when no other strength was designated. Like alcohol,\r\nstrong acetic acid dissolves essential oils and is used in the\r\nmanufacture of various toilet vinegars and washes. Acetic acid is made\r\nin chemical laboratories by distillation of acetate of sodium with\r\nsulphuric acid, or more commonly from wood vinegar. The buyer should\r\nalways satisfy himself that the product is free from an empyreumatic\r\nodor which clings tenaciously to an insufficiently purified sample.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATS.\r\n\r\nFats find extensive application in perfumery, in the preparation of\r\nthe so-called huiles antiques, pomades, and many other cosmetics. They\r\nshould be enumerated among the chemical products used in perfumery\r\nbecause they can never be employed in their commercial form, but\r\nmust undergo some process of purification, which is effected less by\r\nmechanical than by chemical means. Commercial fats usually contain\r\nremnants of the animal or vegetable body from which they are derived:\r\nparticles of blood and membranes occur frequently in animal fats;\r\ncell bodies and vegetable albumin in vegetable fats. Besides these\r\nmechanical impurities, fats, especially if old, sometimes contain\r\nsmall amounts of free fatty acids which suffice to impart to them the\r\nobjectionable odor and taste peculiar to every rancid fat. While some\r\nfats, such as bear’s grease, butter of cacao, oil of sesame, and some\r\nothers, remain free from rancidity for a long time, others undergo this\r\nchange very rapidly; in fact, we may say that every fat which shows\r\nthe slightest odor should be called rancid, for pure fat is absolutely\r\nodorless.\r\n\r\nWe shall here briefly describe the process employed in the fat industry\r\nand by perfumers for the purification of fats. Animal fat, such as\r\nlard, suet, bear’s grease, etc., as well as cocoanut and palm oils,\r\nare introduced into a large iron boiler containing dilute soda lye\r\n(not exceeding one per cent of caustic soda), and the lye is heated\r\nto boiling. In the boiler is a small pump terminating above in a\r\ncurved tube having a rose of a watering-pot at the end. The pump is so\r\narranged as to raise lye and melted fat at the same time and to return\r\nthe fluid into the boiler in a fine spray. After the fat is melted, the\r\nsolid matters floating on top are skimmed off with a perforated spoon,\r\nand then the pump is operated for about fifteen minutes. The contained\r\nshreds of membrane and similar substances are completely dissolved by\r\nthe soda lye, the free fatty acids are perfectly combined, and the\r\nfat is at the same time decolorized. After cooling, it floats on the\r\nsurface of the lye as a colorless and odorless fluid; it is ladled\r\noff and poured into tall tapering vessels which are well closed and\r\npreserved in cool cellars. Contact with the air, especially at higher\r\ntemperatures, causes rancidity of the fat. For every twenty pounds of\r\nfat twenty quarts of lye are used.\r\n\r\nAccording to another process the fat is purified by being heated with\r\nalum and table salt; or every twenty-five pounds of fat, one ounce of\r\nalum and two ounces of salt are dissolved in five gallons of water.\r\nThe scum is carefully skimmed from the surface of the melted fat, and,\r\nafter it has solidified, the fat is washed with water until the latter\r\nescapes perfectly tasteless and odorless.\r\n\r\nThe washing is a very complicated and tedious piece of work. Operating\r\non a small scale, a slightly inclined marble slab is taken, upon which\r\na thin stream of water is constantly falling from a tube arranged above\r\nit. The fat is placed on the slab in small quantities (not over two\r\npounds) and ground with a muller, like oil colors, under a constant\r\nflow of water. Owing to the expense of hand labor, it is advisable to\r\nuse a so-called vertical mill or chaser. This consists of a level,\r\ncircular, horizontal marble slab, bearing a central, easily movable\r\naxis with a crosspiece upon which two, likewise vertical, cylindrical\r\nmarble plates turn like wheels in a circle on the horizontal marble\r\nplate. The fat is placed on the latter and continually irrigated with\r\nwater; behind every chaser is applied a marble plate with a blade which\r\nnearly touches the chasers and returns the fat displaced laterally,\r\nunder the chasers. The axis around which the chasers run is kept moving\r\nby any available power, and the laborer has nothing to do but to\r\nreplace the washed fat with crude.\r\n\r\nLiquid fats are purified as follows:\r\n\r\nThe oil is intimately mixed with one per cent of sulphuric acid. The\r\nmixture assumes a black color, the vegetable mucilage present in the\r\noil becoming carbonized. After several days’ rest the oil becomes clear\r\nand floats on the surface of the sulphuric acid which has assumed a\r\nblack color from the presence of finely divided carbon. The oil is\r\ndecanted and treated, in the manner above stated for solid fats, with\r\ncaustic soda lye. Heating can be dispensed with if the pumping is\r\ncontinued for a longer time.\r\n\r\nBenzoin and benzoic acid have the property of counteracting the\r\ntendency of fats to become rancid; it is advisable, therefore, to mix\r\nintimately with the completely washed fat a small amount of benzoic\r\nacid, at most one-one-thousandth part by weight.\r\n\r\nThe best way of preserving fats is by salicylic acid. This is added\r\nto solid fats while they are in a melted state; if oils, the acid is\r\npoured in and the bottle vigorously shaken. If the oil is in casks,\r\na small bag filled with salicylic acid is hung into it from the\r\nbung-hole. The acid dissolves in the oil and is disseminated through it\r\nand thus effects its preservation. One-one-thousandth part by weight of\r\nthe fat or oil is said to be more than sufficient to keep it perfectly\r\nfresh for years.\r\n\r\nFats differ largely in their physical properties—for instance, in\r\ntheir appearance, melting-point, firmness, etc. As we shall return to\r\nthis subject in connection with the manufacture of some perfumes, it is\r\nenough here to state briefly that by the addition of spermaceti, wax,\r\nparaffin, etc., fats are made more transparent and firmer—a matter of\r\nimportance for some cosmetic preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE GELATIN.\r\n\r\nThis substance, derived from several algæ, species of Eucheuma,\r\nindigenous to the Chinese sea, and identical with Japanese agar-agar,\r\non being boiled with two hundred parts of water has the property of\r\nforming a colorless solution which solidifies on cooling. Owing to this\r\nproperty the addition of a small quantity of Chinese gelatin (0·1-0·2%)\r\nis an excellent means for imparting to certain pomades and ointments\r\ngreat transparency and firmness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT ETHERS\r\n\r\nare liquids which possess an agreeable, refreshing odor resembling\r\nthat of some fruits. For this reason they are used in confectionery,\r\nin the manufacture of liqueurs, and also in many ways in perfumery.\r\nChemically, fruit ethers are combinations of an organic acid—acetic,\r\nbutyric, valerianic, etc.—with a so-called alcohol radicle such as\r\nethyl and amyl. Their manufacture is connected with many difficulties\r\nand is but rarely attempted by perfumers, especially as these products\r\nare made a specialty in some chemical laboratories and are furnished at\r\nvery low prices and of excellent quality. In perfumery the following\r\nfruit ethers are particularly employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nACETIC ETHER,\r\n\r\nprepared by the distillation of acetate of sodium with alcohol and\r\nsulphuric acid, is a colorless liquid having an odor of fermenting\r\napple juice, with a boiling-point at 74° C. (155° F.).\r\n\r\n\r\nPINE-APPLE ETHER\r\n\r\n(ether or huile d’ananas) is made by the saponification of butter\r\nwith solution of potassa, distillation of the soap with alcohol\r\nand sulphuric acid, and rectification of the distillate. It is\r\nan inflammable liquid with an intense odor of pine-apple; its\r\nboiling-point is 119° C. (246° F.). It is not generally used pure, as\r\nits odor needs some correction. This is accomplished by the addition of\r\na little valerianate of amyl, and chloroform. Also in other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE ETHER,\r\n\r\nprepared by distillation from valerianate of sodium with alcohol and\r\nsulphuric acid, and the subsequent addition of certain correctives (see\r\nbelow).\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAR ETHER,\r\n\r\nalso called pear oil, chiefly valerianate of amyl oxide, can be\r\nobtained in large quantities from a by-product in the manufacture of\r\npotato spirit, namely, amyl alcohol, which is carefully heated in a\r\nstill with bichromate of potassium and sulphuric acid. The product thus\r\nobtained has a very pleasant odor of fine pears and boils at 196° C.\r\n(385° F.). But the commercial “pear-essence” is a more complex body\r\n(see following table).\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROUS ETHER\r\n\r\nis a very volatile liquid boiling at 16° C. (61° F.), which is obtained\r\nby distillation of strong alcohol with concentrated nitric acid and\r\nrectification of the distillate; it is less used in perfumery than the\r\nother fruit ethers.\r\n\r\nFruit ethers, owing to their low price and great strength, are\r\nfrequently employed in the manufacture of cheap perfumery, in place of\r\nessential oils, but more largely for scenting soap.\r\n\r\nThe so-called raspberry and strawberry ethers consist of mixtures of\r\nacetic, pine-apple, apple, and other ethers (see following table),\r\nwhich, combined in certain proportions, really manifest an odor nearly\r\nakin to those of the fruits after which they are named.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT ETHERS (FRUIT ESSENCES).\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE INGREDIENTS USUALLY EMPLOYED FOR PREPARING ARTIFICIAL\r\nFRUIT ETHERS (FRUIT ESSENCES).\r\n\r\n  A = Peach.\r\n  B = Apricot.\r\n  C = Plum.\r\n  D = Cherry.\r\n  E = Black Cherry.\r\n  F = Lemon.\r\n  G = Pear.\r\n  H = Orange.\r\n  I = Apple.\r\n  J = Grape.\r\n  K = Gooseberry.\r\n  L = Raspberry.\r\n  M = Strawberry.\r\n  N = Melon.\r\n  O = Pine-apple.\r\n  ————————————————————————————+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+\r\n                              | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I |\r\n  ————————————————————————————+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+\r\n  Glycerin                    | 5 | 4 | 8 | 3 |.. | 5 |10 |10 | 4 |\r\n  Chloroform                  |.. | 1 |.. |.. |.. | 1 |.. | 2 | 1 |\r\n  Nitrous ether               |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. | 1 |.. |.. | 1 |\r\n  Aldehyde                    | 2 |.. | 5 |.. |.. | 2 |.. | 2 | 2 |\r\n  Acetate of ethyl            | 5 |.. | 5 | 5 |10 |10 | 5 | 5 | 1 |\r\n  Formate of ethyl            | 5 |.. | 1 |.. |.. |.. |.. | 1 |.. |\r\n  Butyrate of ethyl           | 5 |10 | 2 |.. |.. |.. |.. | 1 |.. |\r\n  Valerianate of ethyl        | 5 | 5 |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  Benzoate of ethyl           |.. |.. |.. | 5 | 5 |.. |.. | 1 |.. |\r\n  Œnanthate of ethyl          | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  Salicylate of methyl        | 2 | 2 |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. | 1 |.. |\r\n  Sebacic acid                | 1 |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |10 |.. |.. |\r\n  Acetate of amyl             |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |10 |.. |\r\n  Butyrate of amyl            |.. | 1 |.. |.. |.. |10 |.. |.. |10 |\r\n  Valerianate of amyl         |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  Essence of orange           |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |10 |.. |10 |.. |\r\n  Alcohol,      {Tartaric acid|.. |.. |.. |.. | 1 |.. |.. | 1 | 1 |\r\n    solutions   {Oxalic acid  |.. | 1 |.. |.. |.. | 1 |.. |.. |.. |\r\n    saturated in{Succinic acid|.. |.. |.. | 1 | 2 |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n    the cold of {Benzoic acid |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  ————————————————————————————+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+\r\n  ————————————————————————————+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+\r\n                              | J | K | L | M | N | O |\r\n  ————————————————————————————+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+\r\n  Glycerin                    |10 |.. | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 |\r\n  Chloroform                  | 2 |.. |.. |.. |.. | 1 |\r\n  Nitrous ether               |.. |.. | 1 | 1 |.. |.. |\r\n  Aldehyde                    | 2 | 1 | 1 |.. | 2 | 1 |\r\n  Acetate of ethyl            |.. | 5 | 5 | 5 |.. |.. |\r\n  Formate of ethyl            | 2 |.. | 1 | 1 | 1 |.. |\r\n  Butyrate of ethyl           |.. |.. | 1 | 5 | 4 | 5 |\r\n  Valerianate of ethyl        |.. |.. |.. |.. | 5 |.. |\r\n  Benzoate of ethyl           |.. | 1 | 1 |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  Œnanthate of ethyl          |10 | 1 | 1 |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  Salicylate of methyl        | 1 |.. | 1 | 1 |.. |.. |\r\n  Sebacic acid                |.. |.. | 1 |.. |10 |.. |\r\n  Acetate of amyl             |.. |.. | 1 | 3 |.. |10 |\r\n  Butyrate of amyl            |.. |.. |.. | 2 |.. |.. |\r\n  Valerianate of amyl         |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  Essence of orange           |.. | 5 | 5 |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  Alcohol,      {Tartaric acid| 5 |.. |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n    solutions   {Oxalic acid  |.. | 1 | 1 |.. |.. |.. |\r\n    saturated in{Succinic acid| 3 | 1 |.. |.. |.. |.. |\r\n    the cold of {Benzoic acid |.. |.. | 1 |.. |.. |.. |\r\n  ————————————————————————————+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+—-—+\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCERIN.\r\n\r\nThis substance, which may be called a true cosmetic in itself, as it\r\npossesses marked solvent power for cutaneous coloring matters and at\r\nthe same time imparts to the skin delicacy and flexibility, is at\r\npresent to be had commercially in great purity. Pure glycerin is a\r\nbrilliant, colorless, and odorless substance of the consistence of a\r\nthick syrup, which mixes with water and alcohol in all proportions and\r\nhas a slightly warm but very sweet taste. It readily absorbs aromatic\r\nsubstances and is used in many valued toilet articles in combination\r\nwith fats and perfumes. Recently we have succeeded in using glycerin\r\nmost successfully for the extraction of aromatic substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF MIRBANE,\r\n\r\nalso called artificial oil of bitter almonds, nitrobenzol, and essence\r\nof mirbane. This substance, which is now largely used in perfumery\r\nand soap manufacture, is obtained by the action of fuming nitric acid\r\non benzol. The mixture becomes hot and emits masses of brown vapors,\r\nand there is formed a yellow oily body which is washed with water and\r\nsoda solution until the washings escape colorless. Pure nitrobenzol is\r\nnot soluble in water, but in alcohol or ether, boils at 213° C. (415°\r\nF.), and congeals at-5 to 6° C. (21-23° F.). Its spec. grav. is 1·2\r\nor a little over. Any oil of mirbane having a lower specific gravity\r\nthan 1·2 at 15° C. (59° F.) is spurious, most likely nitrotoluol.\r\nIts odor greatly resembles that of oil of bitter almonds, but can be\r\nclearly differentiated from it on comparison. Care must be taken in\r\ninhaling the vapor when undiluted, as it is poisonous. By distillation\r\nnitrobenzol can be obtained quite colorless, and in this form is\r\noften used for the adulteration of genuine oil of bitter almonds.\r\nThis adulteration, however, can be easily demonstrated by heating for\r\na short time with an alcoholic solution of a caustic alkali which\r\nseparates from nitrobenzol a brown resinous substance, while true oil\r\nof bitter almonds loses its odor and changes into benzoic acid which\r\nunites with the alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAFFIN.\r\n\r\nThis substance is one of the products of the distillation of petroleum,\r\ncoal, peat, and other carbonaceous sources. It is a crystalline,\r\nbrittle body, closely resembling wax in appearance and melting between\r\n51 and 60° C. (124 and 140° F.). Paraffin, which is now made on a large\r\nscale for the manufacture of candles, is very useful in perfumery as\r\na partial substitute for the much more expensive wax or spermaceti,\r\nover which it has the advantage, besides its cheapness, that it imparts\r\nto the articles great transparency—a quality which is valued highly\r\nin fine perfumeries. The addition of some paraffin to pomades renders\r\nthem more consistent and counteracts their tendency to become rancid.\r\nDistilled paraffin always has a crystalline form, differing from\r\nthe paraffin-like residues left after the distillation of petroleum\r\n(so-called vaselins, etc., see below) which are always amorphous.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYROGALLIC ACID\r\n\r\nappears in commerce as a white crystalline powder, made by heating\r\ngallic acid to 200-210° C. (392-410° F.). With iron salts, pyrogallic\r\nacid forms bluish-black combinations and precipitates the metal from\r\nsilver solutions as a velvety-black powder. On account of these\r\nproperties pyrogallic acid is used in perfumery as a constituent of\r\nsome hair dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHIDE OF POTASSIUM,\r\n\r\nliver of sulphur, hepar sulphuris, potassii sulphuretum, the\r\npentasulphide of potassium, is obtained by fusing together potash and\r\nsulphur, in the shape of a leather-brown mass which is soluble in water\r\nand on exposure to the air is gradually decomposed with the development\r\nof the offensive sulphuretted hydrogen gas; hence it should be\r\npreserved in well-closed vessels. An aqueous solution of this substance\r\nforms with lead or silver salts a black precipitate of sulphide of lead\r\nor silver, and is used for some hair dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARCH FLOUR\r\n\r\n(amylum) is prepared from various vegetables such as potatoes, rice,\r\narrowroot, sago, etc., and when pure appears as an insoluble white\r\npowder which the microscope shows to be grains consisting of many\r\nsuperimposed layers. In commerce the price of the different varieties\r\nof starch fluctuates greatly; in perfumery well-cleansed potato starch\r\ncan very well be used for dusting powders, and the so-called poudre de\r\nriz; in this country, corn starch is preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLIN,\r\n\r\nthat is, the body to which vanilla owes its fragrance, is now made\r\nartificially and can be used in place of vanilla for soaps and pomades.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASELIN.\r\n\r\nIn the distillation of petroleum there remain in the still as a residue\r\nlarge quantities of a substance which when purified is colorless and,\r\naccording to the nature of the petroleum, at ordinary temperatures has\r\neither the consistence of lard, melting under the heat of the hand, or\r\nforms an oily liquid. In perfumery vaselin can be used like fat or oil,\r\nover which it has the advantage in that it always remains odorless and\r\nfree from acid; hence it is very appropriate for the manufacture of\r\npomades. The market affords numerous varieties of this substance, under\r\ndifferent names: vaselin (oil and solid), albolene (oil and solid),\r\ncosmolin, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPERMACETI\r\n\r\nis a substance found in the skull cavities of several whales and\r\ndolphins. In its properties it stands midway between beeswax, paraffin,\r\nand firm fats. In the living animal spermaceti is fluid, but after its\r\ndeath it congeals to a white crystalline mass of a fatty lustre, which\r\nmelts at 40° C. (104° F.), and is frequently used for fine candles as\r\nwell as for other articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAX\r\n\r\n(Cera alba), the well-known product of the bee; in perfumery only\r\nbleached (white) wax is employed. In recent years Japanese wax\r\nhas appeared in commerce; this is of vegetable origin, but in its\r\nproperties resembles beeswax.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBNITRATE OF BISMUTH,\r\n\r\nbismuth white, pearl white, bismuthi subnitras, blanc de bismuth,\r\nblanc de perles, the basic nitrate of bismuth, the chief ingredient\r\nof many skin cosmetics, is prepared by dissolving metallic bismuth in\r\nmoderately strong nitric acid, and pouring the solution into a large\r\nquantity of water, whereupon the subnitrate is precipitated.\r\n\r\nThe precipitated powder is collected on a funnel and washed with pure\r\nwater until the wash water no longer changes blue tincture of litmus to\r\nred. The bismuth white is dried and preserved in well-closed vessels,\r\nsince in the air it gradually assumes a yellowish color; for any\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen present in the air is greedily absorbed by this\r\nsalt, and the resulting combination with sulphur has a black color.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXIDE OF TIN\r\n\r\nis obtained by treating metallic tin with fuming nitric acid, adding\r\nthe solution to a large quantity of water, and washing the product,\r\nwhich forms a white insoluble powder used cosmetically for polishing\r\nthe finger nails.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides the chemical products here enumerated, some others find\r\napplication in perfumery; we shall describe their properties in\r\nconnection with the articles into which they enter. In this connection\r\nmention may be made of the fact that more and more aromatic substances\r\nare now made artificially which were formerly obtained with difficulty\r\nfrom plants. Besides vanillin mentioned above, cumarin, oil of\r\nwintergreen, and some other products are prepared artificially.\r\nHeliotropin and nerolin are artificially prepared substances,\r\npossessing an odor resembling that of heliotrope and oil of neroli,\r\nrespectively, but not identical chemically with the natural odorous\r\nsubstance. Artificial musk (Baur’s), is playing a rôle at present, but\r\nis not identical with the natural substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. The Colors used in Perfumery.\r\n\r\nSome articles are colored intentionally; this remark applies\r\nparticularly to some soaps which not rarely are stained to correspond\r\nto the color of the flower whose odor they bear; for instance, violet\r\nsoap. Some articles again are used only on account of their color;\r\nfor instance, paints, hair and whisker dyes. As we shall discuss this\r\nsubject at greater length in connection with these toilet articles, we\r\nmerely state here that nowadays every manufacturer can choose between a\r\nlarge number of dyes of any color, all of which are innoxious; hence no\r\nperfumer should under any circumstances use poisonous colors. This is\r\na matter of importance with substances intended for immediate contact\r\nwith the human body such as paints, lip salves, soaps, etc. All of\r\nthese colors will be described hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXTRACTION OF ODORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcepting the articles made in Turkey and India (especially oil of\r\nrose), most aromatic substances are manufactured in southern France\r\nand the adjoining regions of Italy, while a few (oils of peppermint\r\nand lavender) are produced in England; a few also (oils of peppermint,\r\nspearmint, wintergreen, sassafras, etc.) in the United States. However,\r\nas we have stated above, it is possible to cultivate some plants from\r\nwhich odors are extracted in the warm sections of this country, and\r\nto obtain the most expensive perfumes from them. Among these plants\r\nour experience leads us to suggest violets, roses, reseda, lavender,\r\nmints, syringa, lilac, and several others to which the climate is\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which the odors can be extracted from the plants differ\r\naccording to the physical properties of the raw material and the\r\nchemical composition of the aromatic substance. We shall here briefly\r\ndescribe the methods thus far known, and at the same time add our\r\nown experience in this most important part of the art of perfumery.\r\nThe aromatic substances are obtained by pressure, by distillation,\r\nby maceration (infusion), by absorption (enfleurage) through air or\r\nthrough carbonic acid, and by extraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE.\r\n\r\nCertain aromatic substances that occur in large amounts in some\r\nparts of plants, are best obtained by pressure. The rinds of certain\r\nfruits contain an essential oil in considerable quantities inclosed\r\nin receptacles easily distinguished under the microscope. When these\r\nvegetable substances are subjected to strong pressure, the oil\r\nreceptacles burst and the essential oil escapes. The force is usually\r\napplied through a screw press with a stout iron spindle; the vegetable\r\nsubstances being inclosed in strong linen or horse-hair cloths, placed\r\nbetween iron plates, and subjected to a gradually increasing pressure.\r\nComparative experiments have shown us that even with the most powerful\r\npresses a considerable, amount of oil is lost owing to the fact that a\r\nlarge number of oil receptacles remain intact. For this reason, when\r\noil is to be extracted by pressure, a hydraulic press is preferable,\r\nas it develops greater power than any other press. In the hydraulic\r\npresses used for this purpose the piston fits exactly into a hollow\r\niron cylinder with sieve-like openings in its circumference. The\r\nvegetable substances are filled into this cylinder; when the pressure\r\nis applied, the fluids escape through the perforations, and the\r\nresidue forms a compact woody cake which is then free from oil.\r\n\r\nBesides the essential oil, watery fluid is expressed, the whole\r\nappearing as a milky liquid, owing to the admixture of vegetable\r\nfibres, mucilage, etc. It is collected in a tall glass cylinder which\r\nis set in a place free from any vibration. After remaining at rest for\r\nseveral hours the liquid separates into two layers, the lower being\r\nwatery and mixed with mucilage, that floating on top being almost\r\npure oil. The latter is separated, and finally purified by filtration\r\nthrough a double paper cone in a funnel covered with a glass plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIt is best to separate the water and oil in a regular separatory\r\nfunnel, or in a simple apparatus illustrated in Fig. 4. It is made\r\nby cutting the bottom from a tall flask, and fitting into the neck\r\nby means of a cork a glass tube having a diameter of one-fourth to\r\none-half inch. A rubber tube with stop-cock is fastened to the glass\r\ntube. By careful opening of the stop-cock, the watery fluid can be\r\ndrained off to the last drop.\r\n\r\nTo the perfumer this method is of little importance, since it is\r\napplicable only to a few substances which, moreover, give cheap odors.\r\nStill, the possession of a hydraulic press is advisable to every\r\nmanufacturer who works on a large scale, as it is useful also in the\r\npreparation of several fixed oils frequently employed in perfumery, for\r\ninstance, oils of almonds, nuts, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nFixed oils are best extracted in so-called drop presses, the material\r\nhaving first been comminuted between rollers. These are arranged\r\nas shown in section in Fig. 5, and in ground plan in Fig. 6. The\r\napparatus consists of two smooth or slightly grooved iron cylinders\r\nA and B, respectively four feet and one foot in diameter, which can\r\nbe approximated or separated by means of set screws. The material is\r\nplaced into the trough F containing a feeding roller moved by the belt\r\nP. The scrapers FF, pressed against the cylinders by means of weighted\r\nlevers, free the rollers from adhering pieces.\r\n\r\nThe drop presses Figs. 7 and 8 consist of a hydraulic press with\r\ncylinders A and piston B; the troughs E are movable by means of rings\r\nbetween two vertical columns and every trough has a circular gutter _d_\r\nfor the reception of the expressed oil. The iron pots G have double\r\nwalls, the inner of which has a series of openings at its upper part;\r\nthese pots are filled with the bruised material to be pressed and after\r\nthis has been covered with a plate of horse-hair tissue are set in the\r\npress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nAs the piston rises, the troughs E sink into the pots, the escaping oil\r\ncollects in the gutters _d_ and thence passes into a receptacle. After\r\npressing, the piston is allowed to sink back, the pots G are drawn\r\naside (Fig. 8) to tabular surfaces, and other pots are substituted for\r\nthe exhausted ones. These drop presses are suitable for the extraction\r\nof all fixed oils and also volatile oils present in orange and lemon\r\npeel, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION.\r\n\r\nMany odors or essential oils possess the remarkable property that their\r\nvapors pass so largely with that of boiling water that they can be\r\nextracted in this way (by “distillation”) from vegetable substances,\r\nthough the essential oils have a boiling-point far above that of water.\r\nDistillation can be employed for a large number of substances; for\r\ninstance, the essential oils present in cumin, anise, lavender, fennel,\r\nmace, nutmeg, etc., are extracted exclusively in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nFor the extraction of odors in this way, according to the quantities of\r\nmaterial to be worked, different apparatuses are used, some of the most\r\nimportant of which will be here described.\r\n\r\nFor manufacturers who run without steam and are obliged to use a naked\r\nflame, the adjoining apparatus (Fig. 9) will be advantageous.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a copper boiler A, the still, set in a brick furnace.\r\nThe latter is so constructed that the incandescent gases strike not\r\nonly the curved bottom of the still, but also its sides through the\r\nflues Z left in the brickwork. The still, whose upper part projects\r\nfrom the furnace, has an opening O on the left side, closed air-tight\r\nwith a screw, which serves for refilling with water during distillation\r\nwhen necessary. To the margin of the still is fitted steam-tight the\r\nhelm H, made of copper or tinned iron, having a prolongation, the tube\r\nR. The latter is joined to the conical projection _v_ which terminates\r\nin the worm K. In some apparatuses this projection is omitted and the\r\ntube immediately joins the worm. The latter is made of tinned iron and,\r\nas the cut shows, is arranged in coils and supported by props _t_ in\r\nthe wooden or metal condenser F. The condenser bears above a short bent\r\ntube _b_, and below, immediately over the bottom, an elbow tube _e_,\r\nlong enough to reach above the edge of the condenser, as indicated in\r\nthe cut.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable substances to be distilled can be put immediately into\r\nthe still and covered with water; but in this case it is advisable\r\nto use a stirrer which must be kept moving until the water boils,\r\notherwise the material might burn at the bottom. But this accident can\r\nalso be prevented by applying a perforated false bottom to the still\r\nabove the flues, or by inclosing the material in a wire-sieve basket C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nIn place of the basket C the apparatus can also be provided with an\r\nadditional vessel containing the material to be distilled. In the still\r\nA (Fig. 10) the water is brought to boiling, the steam rises through\r\nthe second still B in which the material is spread on a perforated\r\nbottom. The steam laden with the vapors of the essential oil passes\r\nthrough the tube R into the condenser.\r\n\r\nIt is very advantageous, and in large establishments altogether\r\nindispensable, to use steam in the distillation of essential oils. Fig.\r\n11 represents the arrangement of such an apparatus. The still B (which\r\nin this case may be made of stout tinned iron) stands free and is\r\nprovided with a wooden jacket M for the purpose of retaining the heat.\r\nImmediately above the curved bottom is a perforated plate on which the\r\nmaterial rests. The tube D which enters the bottom of the still is\r\nconnected with the boiler which furnishes steam at moderate tension.\r\nH is the faucet for the admission of steam; H. is the faucet by which\r\nthe water escapes from the still at the end of the operation. After the\r\nstill is filled with the material, the faucet H is opened gradually and\r\na continuous stream of steam is allowed to pass through the still until\r\nthe operation is finished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nWhen working with an open fire, as soon as vapors appear at the lower\r\nend of the worm (Fig. 9), cold water is admitted through the tube _ne_;\r\nas the cold water abstracts heat from the vapors and condenses them, it\r\nbecomes warm, rises to the surface, and escapes through _b_, so that\r\nthe worm is continually surrounded with cold water. If for any reason\r\nthe saving of cold water is an object, its flow may be so regulated\r\nthat the vapors are just condensed, the warm distillate being allowed\r\nto cool in the air. When working with steam, the cold water must be\r\nadmitted the moment the steam-cock is opened, and the flow of cold\r\nwater should be ample during the distillation, which in this case is\r\nmuch shorter.\r\n\r\nThe large apparatuses here described are generally used, especially\r\nfor the extraction from vegetable substances of odors present in\r\nconsiderable quantity, for instance, mace, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon,\r\netc., or from bulky material as the various flowers. For very expensive\r\nodors, smaller apparatuses are often employed, the construction of\r\nwhich resembles that of the ones described. For this purpose small\r\nglass apparatuses are very suitable; they are illustrated in Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nThe still, a retort A, consists of a spherical vessel with a bottle\r\nneck _t_ which is either closed with a cork or carries a thermometer\r\nor glass tube, and with a lateral tube, the neck of the retort,\r\nconnected with the adapter _r_. The latter passes into the condenser\r\nC. At the lower end of R is the bent adapter _v_ under which is placed\r\nthe receptacle for the distillate. The tube C is closed with corks,\r\nat its lower end is the ascending tube _h_, and at its upper end the\r\ndescending tube _g_. During the distillation cold water flows in\r\nthrough _h_ which cools the tube _r_ and escapes at _g_. The tube C,\r\nas will be readily understood, acts like the condenser in the larger\r\napparatuses above described. In order to prevent the breaking of the\r\nretort, it is not heated over a flame, but is set in a tin vessel B\r\nfilled with water. The comminuted vegetable material is inserted with\r\nwater through the up-turned neck of the retort into the latter; the\r\nvessel B is filled with water which is raised to the boiling-point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nDuring distillation we obtain at the lower end of the condenser pure\r\nwater and essential oil. When larger quantities are to be distilled\r\nit is advisable to use a Florentine flask as a receptacle for the\r\nseparation of the oil and water (Fig. 13). It consists of a glass\r\nbottle from the bottom of which ascends a tube curved above; the latter\r\nrises high enough to bring the curvature slightly below the neck of the\r\nflask. During the distillation the flask becomes filled with water W,\r\non which floats a layer of oil O; the excess of water escapes through\r\n_a_ at _d_ until the flask finally contains more oil and very little\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nWhen producing essential oils on a large scale, instead of the frail\r\nFlorentine flasks it is advisable to use separators, the construction\r\nof which is illustrated in Fig. 14. They consist of glass cylinders,\r\nconical above and below, supported on a suitable frame. The water\r\naccumulating under the oil is allowed to escape by opening the\r\nstop-cock; when the first separator is filled with oil, the succeeding\r\ndistillate passes through the horizontal tube into the next separator,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nWhen the distillation is carried on in an ordinary still, we obtain,\r\nbesides the essential oil, a considerable quantity of aromatic water,\r\nthat is, a solution of the oil in water.\r\n\r\nAn apparatus which obviates the losses caused thereby is that of\r\nSchimmel described below, which is well adapted to the manufacture on a\r\nlarge scale. The apparatus is patented.\r\n\r\nThe nearly spherical still D (Fig. 15) is surrounded by a jacket M;\r\nthe inlet steam tube R is connected with a branch _r_ which enters the\r\ninterior of the still as a spiral tube with numerous perforations,\r\nwhile R opens into the space M. When _r_ is opened, distillation takes\r\nplace by direct steam; when R is opened, by indirect steam; when both\r\nfaucets are opened, the still is heated at the same time with direct\r\nand indirect steam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe vapors rising from the still D pass through the helm C and the tube\r\nA into the worm K; the fluid condensed in the latter drops into the tin\r\nFlorentine flask F, the aromatic water flowing from the latter passes\r\nback into the still D through the Welter funnel T and is distilled over\r\nagain, so that the entire distillation can be effected with very little\r\nwater, and it is continued until the water escaping from the Florentine\r\nflask is freed from oil and odorless.\r\n\r\nWhen working with superheated steam, it is necessary to set under the\r\nfunnel tube T a vessel twice the size of the Florentine flask, which is\r\nprovided with a stop-cock above and below. The lower cock is closed,\r\nthe vessel is allowed to fill with water from F, then the upper cock is\r\nclosed, the contents being allowed to escape into D by opening, when\r\nthe cocks are again reversed.\r\n\r\nThe use of superheated steam is important especially with material\r\nwhich gives up the contained oil with difficulty, such as woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nFor freeing the essential oil completely from water we use a so-called\r\nseparating funnel (Fig. 16). This consists of a glass funnel T resting\r\non a suitable support G, which is closed above with a glass plate\r\nground to fit, drawn out below into a fine point S, and provided with a\r\nglass stop-cock H. The contents of the Florentine flask are poured into\r\nthe funnel which is covered with the glass plate and allowed to stand\r\nat rest until the layer of oil O is clearly separated from the water W.\r\nBy careful opening of the stop-cock the water is allowed to escape and\r\nthe oil is immediately filled into bottles which are closed air tight\r\nand preserved in a cool and dark place.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACERATION (INFUSION).\r\n\r\nSome odors, like those of cassie, rose, reseda, syringa, jasmine,\r\nviolets, and many other fragrant blossoms, cannot be obtained by\r\ndistillation as completely or as sweet-scented as by the process\r\nof maceration which is in general use among the large perfumers in\r\nsouthern France. This process is based on the property of fats to\r\nabsorb odorous substances with avidity and to yield them almost\r\nentirely to strong alcohol. According to the fat employed for the\r\nmaceration of the flowers—a solid fat like lard or a liquid like olive\r\noil—odorous products are obtained which are known either as pomades\r\nor as perfumed oils (huiles antiques). By repeatedly treating fresh\r\nflowers with the same fat the manufacturer is able to perfume the\r\npomade or oil at will, and in the factories these varying strengths\r\nare designated by numbers; the higher numbers indicating the stronger\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe process of maceration is very simple. The fat is put into porcelain\r\nor enamelled iron pots which are heated, in a shallow vessel filled\r\nwith water, to 40 or at most 50° C. (104-122° F.); the flowers are\r\ninclosed in small bags of fine linen and hung into the fat, where they\r\nare allowed to remain for from one-half to two days. At the end of that\r\ntime the bags are removed, drained, expressed, refilled with fresh\r\nflowers, and replaced in the fat. This procedure is repeated twelve to\r\nsixteen times or oftener, thus producing pomades or oils of varying\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nAs the odors are much superior when the flowers are only a short\r\ntime in contact with the fat, it is better to use an apparatus for\r\ncontinuous operation (Fig. 17). It consists of a box K made of tin\r\nplate, which is divided into from five to ten compartments by vertical\r\nsepta and can be closed water tight by a lid to be screwed on. The\r\nsepta have alternate upper and lower openings. The compartments contain\r\neach a basket of tinned wire filled with the flowers for maceration,\r\nthen the lid is closed and the box heated in a water bath to 40 or\r\n50° C. (104-122° F.). The stop-cock H in tube R is now opened. This\r\nadmits melted fat or oil from a vessel above to the first compartment\r\nin which it rises through the basket filled with flowers whose odor it\r\nabstracts. The additional fat coming from above drives it over through\r\nthe opening O_{2} into compartment 2, where it comes in contact with\r\nfresh flowers, passes through O_{3} into the third compartment, and so\r\non through 4 and 5, until it finally escapes through R_{1} well charged\r\nwith odor. According to requirements a larger number of compartments\r\nmay be employed.\r\n\r\nWhen all the fat has passed through the apparatus, it is opened, the\r\nbasket is removed from compartment 1, the basket from No. 2 is placed\r\nin 1, that from 3 in 2, etc.; basket 1 is emptied, filled with fresh\r\nflowers, and placed in compartment 5, so that every basket gradually\r\npasses through all compartments to No. 1. In this way the fat rapidly\r\nabsorbs all the odor.\r\n\r\nThe odorous substances are abstracted from the pomades or huiles\r\nantiques by treatment with strong alcohol (90-95%) which dissolves the\r\nessential oils but not the fats. The huiles antiques with the alcohol\r\nare placed in large glass bottles and frequently shaken. In order to\r\nabstract the odors from pomades, the latter are allowed to congeal and\r\nare divided into small pieces which are inserted into the bottles of\r\nalcohol. A better plan is to fill the pomades into a tin cylinder with\r\na narrow opening in front and to express the pomades, by a well-fitting\r\npiston, in the shape of a thin thread which thus presents a large\r\nsurface to the action of the alcohol, thus hastening the absorption\r\nof the odor. The alcoholic solution obtained after some weeks is then\r\ndistilled off at a low temperature. We shall recur to this hereafter.\r\n\r\nNo matter how long the fats are left in contact with alcohol, they do\r\nnot yield up to it all the odor, but retain a small portion of it and\r\nhence have a very fragrant smell. They are, therefore, brought into\r\ncommerce as perfumed oils or pomades bearing the name of the odorous\r\nsubstance they contain: orange flower, reseda pomade or oil, etc.; they\r\nare highly prized and are sometimes used again for the extraction of\r\nthe same odor.\r\n\r\nSome odors cannot bear even the slight rise of temperature necessary\r\nfor their extraction by the method of maceration or infusion. For these\r\ndelicate odors one of the following methods may be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORPTION OR ENFLEURAGE.\r\n\r\nIn this method the absorbing power of fat is likewise used for\r\nretaining the odors, but the flowers are treated with the fat at\r\nordinary temperatures. This procedure which is employed especially in\r\nsouthern France is carried out as follows. The fat (lard) is spread to\r\na thickness of about one-quarter inch on glass plates G one yard long\r\nand two feet wide, which are inserted in wooden frames R and sprinkled\r\nwith flowers F (Fig. 18). The frames are superimposed (the cut shows\r\ntwo of the frames) and left for from one to three days, when fresh\r\nflowers are substituted for the wilted ones, and so on until the pomade\r\nhas attained the desired strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nThis procedure is very cumbrous and tedious and therefore had better be\r\nmodified thus: In an air-tight box K (Fig. 19) we place a larger number\r\nof glass plates _g_ covered with lard drawn into fine threads by means\r\nof a syringe. This box is connected with a smaller one K_{1} which is\r\nfilled with fresh flowers and provided with openings below and above,\r\nO and O_{1}. The latter, O_{1} communicates by a tube with box K, at\r\nwhose upper end is a tube _e_ terminating in an exhaust fan so that the\r\nair must pass through the apparatus in the direction indicated by the\r\narrows. A small fan V driven by clockwork will answer. The air drawn\r\nfrom K_{1} is laden with odors and in passing over the fat as shown\r\nby the arrows gives them up completely to the fat. The use of this\r\napparatus has very important advantages: the absorption is effected\r\nrapidly, requires little power, and the flowers do not come at all into\r\ncontact with the fat which therefore can take up nothing but the odors\r\npresent in the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nInstead of charging the fat with odors by either one of the methods\r\nhere described, carbonic acid can also be employed with advantage, by\r\nmeans of the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 20. The large glass vessel\r\nG contains pieces of white marble M upon which hydrochloric acid is\r\npoured at intervals through the funnel tube R. A current of carbonic\r\nacid is thus developed, which passes through a wash bottle W filled\r\nwith water, then through the tin vessel B containing fresh flowers,\r\nand finally into a bottle A filled with strong alcohol and set in cold\r\nwater, after which it escapes through the tube _e_. The carbonic acid\r\nabsorbs the aromatic vapors from B and leaves them in the alcohol which\r\nabsorbs them. (G, R, W are made of glass, B of tin.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTION.\r\n\r\nThis method is based on the fact that some volatile liquids such as\r\nether, chloroform, petroleum ether, or bisulphide of carbon possess the\r\nproperty of rapidly extracting the aromatic substances from flowers;\r\nwhen they are evaporated at a gentle heat they leave the pure odors\r\nbehind. In our opinion this process is the best of all for the perfumer\r\nand it is to be regretted that it is not more generally used.\r\n\r\nAs a rule we employ either petroleum ether or bisulphide of carbon (see\r\nabove, pp. 65, 66) because these products are cheaper than ether or\r\nchloroform.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus we use for this purpose is illustrated in Fig. 21. It\r\nconsists of a cylinder C made of tinned iron, which is provided above\r\nwith a circular gutter R terminating in a stop-cock _h_ and which\r\ncan be closed by a lid D bearing a stop-cock _o_. A tube _b_ with a\r\nstop-cock _a_ enters the bottom of the cylinder. The latter is filled\r\nwith the flowers, the volatile liquid (petroleum ether, bisulphide\r\nof carbon, etc.) is poured over them, the lid is put on, and the\r\ngutter R filled with water, thereby sealing the contents of the vessel\r\nhermetically.\r\n\r\nAfter the extraction, which requires about thirty to forty minutes,\r\nstop-cock _o_ is opened first, then stop-cock _a_, and the liquid\r\nis allowed to escape into the retort of the still (Fig. 12). If the\r\nextraction is to be repeated, the water is allowed to escape from the\r\ngutter through _h_, the lid is opened, and the solvent is again poured\r\nover the flowers.\r\n\r\nFor operation on a larger scale the glass retorts are too small and\r\nshould be replaced by tin vessels (Fig. 22) having the form of a\r\nwide-mouthed bottle F; they are closed by a lid D which is rendered\r\nair tight by being clamped upon the flange of the vessel (R) with iron\r\nscrews S, a pasteboard washer being interposed; a curved glass tube\r\nconnects the apparatus with the condenser of Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe solutions of the aromatic substances are evaporated in these\r\napparatuses at the lowest possible temperature, the solvent being\r\ncondensed and used over again. The heat required is for ether about\r\n36° C. (97° F.), for chloroform about 65° C. (149° F.), for petroleum\r\nether about 56° C. (133° F.), and for bisulphide of carbon about 45° C.\r\n(113° F.). If it is desired to obtain the aromatic substances pure from\r\nan alcoholic extract of the pomades made by one of the above-described\r\nprocesses—which is rarely done since these solutions are generally\r\nused as such for perfumes—a heat of 75 to 80 C. (167 to 176° F.) is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAnother extraction apparatus illustrated in Fig. 23 is well adapted to\r\noperations on a large scale. Its main parts are the extractor E and the\r\nstill B. The former is set in a vat W continually supplied with cold\r\nwater. The still B is surrounded with hot water in the boiler K.\r\n\r\nTo start the apparatus the cone C is removed, the vessel E is filled\r\nwith the material to be extracted, and C is replaced. The faucets H_{2}\r\nand H_{4} are opened, the solvent is poured into the still through the\r\nlatter, when these faucets are closed and those marked H and H_{1} are\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe water in K is heated until the contents of B are in brisk\r\nebullition; the vapor rises through RH, is condensed on entering E and\r\nfalls in small drops on the material. This fine rain of the solvent\r\ndissolves the aromatic substances and flows back into B, where it is\r\nagain evaporated, and so on.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the extraction the faucets H and H_{1} are closed and\r\nH_{2}, is opened. The vapors of the solvent pass through it into a worm\r\nwhere they are condensed; the essential oil remaining in B is drained\r\noff by opening H_{3}.\r\n\r\nFor still larger operations more perfect apparatuses are employed,\r\nsuch as those of Seiffert and Vohl. Seiffert’s apparatus (Fig. 24)\r\nconsists of a battery of jacketed cylinders; steam circulates in the\r\nspace between the cylinders and the jackets. Each cylinder contains a\r\nplate covered with a wire net on which the flowers to be extracted are\r\nplaced. All the cylinders having been filled and closed, the solvent is\r\nadmitted from a container above, through S and _a_ into C^2; when this\r\nis filled the liquid flows through _a_^2_b_^3_c_^n into C. The solution\r\nsaturated with essential oil leaves the apparatus through _d_^n and\r\n_p_ and enters a reservoir. The course of the liquid is aided by the\r\nsuction of an air-pump acting on _p_.\r\n\r\nWhen the reservoir contains an amount of fluid equal to that in C^n,\r\n_d_^n is closed, _a_^n is opened, and C connected with C^1 through\r\n_b_^n and _c_^1. That the contents of C^2 are completely extracted is\r\nshown by the fact that the liquid appears colorless in the glass tube\r\ninserted in _b_^2; _a_^1 and C^2 are closed; _a_^2 and C^3 are opened,\r\nthereby excluding C^2 from the current of bisulphide of carbon which\r\nthen flows through C^3C^nC^1. In order to permit the free flow of\r\nthe bisulphide of carbon through S despite the exclusion of C^2, the\r\nfaucets _a_^1_a_^2_a_^3_a_^n must be two-way cocks; in one position\r\nthey connect S with _b_; in the other they close _b_ and leave the\r\npassage through S open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nIn order to collect the bisulphide of carbon present in the extracted\r\nresidue in C^2, faucet _g_^2 is opened and the bisulphide of carbon\r\nallowed to escape through _h_. The faucet _e_^2 in tube L on being\r\nopened admits compressed air to C^2, thus hastening the outflow. If\r\nnothing escapes below, faucets _f_^2 and _f_^x are opened, steam enters\r\nthrough tube D between jacket and cylinder; the bisulphide of carbon\r\nvapor passes through _g_^2 and _h_ into the worm. After the expulsion\r\nof the bisulphide of carbon, C^3 is emptied, refilled, connected with\r\nC^1, and bisulphide of carbon admitted from C^3 in the manner above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nAn extraction apparatus which has been much recommended of late is the\r\nso-called “Excelsior Apparatus” made by Wegelin and Huebner, Halle a.\r\nS., which can be worked with any desired solvent. The construction of\r\nthe apparatus (Figs. 25 and 26) is as follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe solvent is admitted to the reservoir R in the lower part of the\r\ncondenser B through the tube indicated in the figure. The material\r\nto be extracted having been filled into the cylinder A through the\r\nmanhole, the apparatus is closed. The cold water is admitted to the\r\ncondenser by opening a faucet. The three-way cock shown in Fig. 25 is\r\nso placed as to open a communication of the overflow tube with A. The\r\nfaucet at the lower end of the reservoir R is now opened sufficiently\r\nand the solvent passes into A from above, and as it descends takes\r\nup more and more oil, flows through the sieve-plate, and escapes\r\nthrough the tube at the bottom of A through the three-way cock, the\r\noverflow tube, and the drain tube into the accumulator C. The opening\r\nof a faucet now admits steam to the heating coil, when the solvent\r\nevaporates, leaving the oil or fat behind. It is condensed in B,\r\nagain returns to R, whence it passes once more through the faucet\r\ninto the extractor A. The vessel C and the tubes leading to A and C\r\nare surrounded with felt to prevent loss of heat. A sample taken from\r\nthe small cock at the foot of A (it has a small plate in the interior\r\nof the tube) will show when the extraction in A may be looked upon as\r\nfinished. The solvent is distilled off or recovered from the residue\r\nin A in the following manner. First the faucet in R is closed. The\r\nthree-way cock A is set to establish direct communication between A and\r\nC, thus cutting off the overflow tube. Hence all the solvent in A flows\r\ninto C for distillation, while the oil is left behind. Steam being\r\nadmitted to the residue, the solvent rises as vapor through the upper\r\ntube from A to B and collects in a liquid state in R. To drive off the\r\nlast traces of the solvent from the fat or oil obtained, steam is blown\r\ninto C by opening the valve. Besides the solvent, watery vapor enters B\r\nand forms a layer of water in R under the solvent. By taking a sample\r\nfrom the test-cock of the reservoir C which has an internal small\r\nplate, the termination of the process is ascertained. The gauge tube at\r\nthe reservoir shows the level of the solvent and water. The water is\r\ndrawn off by opening the faucet at the lower end of the reservoir. A is\r\nemptied through the manhole and by draining the oil from C through the\r\ndischarge cock. The tube R is closed by a light valve so as to prevent\r\nevaporation of the solvent. All the apparatuses work without pressure\r\nso that there is no danger from overstrain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe solutions of the essential oils in bisulphide of carbon are\r\ndistilled off in the steam still illustrated in Fig. 27; the steam\r\nenters at _h_, the water of condensation escapes at _d_, the liquid\r\nto be distilled enters at _e_ from a container at a higher level. The\r\nboiling is kept uniform by the stirring arrangement _hg_. After the\r\nbisulphide of carbon is distilled off, air is passed through the oil by\r\nthe curved tube _a_ which has fine perforations, so as to evaporate the\r\nlast traces of the solvent.\r\n\r\nIn Vohl’s apparatus (Fig. 28), arranged for petroleum ether, the\r\nextraction is effected with the boiling fluid; hence this apparatus\r\nis better adapted for the cheaper oils than for the finest oils from\r\nflowers. The apparatus consists of two extractors A A, the accumulator\r\nB, and the condenser C. Petroleum ether is allowed to flow over the\r\nsubstances to be extracted, by opening the faucets _mm_, _vh_, closing\r\n_ogw_E, and opening _o_, the course being through _ux_ to B. When B\r\nis two-thirds full, the flow of petroleum ether is cut off, steam\r\nis admitted through _y_ and the contents of B are brought to the\r\nboiling-point. The vapors pass through _g_ and are condensed in _f_\r\nuntil the contents of A reach the boiling-point of the solvent, when\r\nthe vapors pass through _i_ into C, and after closing _m´_ the liquid\r\npasses through _ml_ into the inner cylinder of the extraction apparatus\r\nand returns through _uxx_.\r\n\r\nAfter the contents of A are extracted, _m´_ is opened, _m_ closed, and\r\nsteam is admitted through _d_ into the jacket of A; the vapors of the\r\nsolvent force the liquid part of the contents through _ux_ into B.\r\nOverfilling of B is prevented by allowing the vapors of the solvent to\r\nescape at the proper time into the condenser through _p_ by opening\r\n_q_. Then _v_ is closed, _q_ opened, and the steam present in A drawn\r\noff by an exhaust applied to _p_; as soon as _p_ begins to cool, all\r\nthe petroleum ether is distilled off, the steam is cut off at _d_, and\r\nthe extract evacuated through _t_. The contents of B are brought into a\r\nstill through D and E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\nBy employing greater pressure the extraction can also be effected by\r\nwhat is called displacement; the material to be extracted is placed\r\nin a stout-walled vessel S (Fig. 29) which is connected by a narrow\r\ntube at least ten yards long with the vessel F containing the solvent.\r\nStopcock H is first opened, then stop-cock H_{1} which is closed as\r\nsoon as fluid begins to flow from it. After the liquid has remained in\r\ncontact with the material for from thirty to sixty minutes, H_{1} is\r\nopened very slowly, the liquid is allowed to escape and is displaced\r\nwith water which is made to pass out of F in the same way as the\r\nsolvent, until the latter is completely displaced from S.\r\n\r\nAfter the solvent has been distilled off, the less volatile essential\r\noil remains in the still almost pure, containing only traces of wax,\r\nvegetable fat or coloring matter which are of no consequence for our\r\npurposes. The last remnants of the solvent cannot be expelled by\r\ndistillation, but by forcing through the essential oil a current of\r\npure air for fifteen or twenty minutes. The essential oils then are of\r\nthe purest, unexceptionable quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of delicate oils it is better to use carbonic acid in place\r\nof air for expelling the last traces of the solvent, as the oxygen\r\nmay impair the delicacy of the fragrance. For this purpose we use the\r\napparatus illustrated in Fig. 30. In the large bottle A carbonic acid\r\nis generated by pouring hydrochloric acid over fragments of white\r\nmarble. The carbonic acid passes into the vessel B filled with water\r\nwhich frees it from any adhering drops of hydrochloric acid; then into\r\nC filled with sulphuric acid to which it yields its water so that only\r\npure carbonic acid escapes through the fine rose at the end of tube\r\nD which is made of pure tin, and as it passes through the oil in E\r\nit carries off the last traces of the volatile solvent. In its final\r\npassage through the water in F it leaves behind any oil that may have\r\nbeen carried with it.\r\n\r\nAs all the aromatic substances change in air by the gradual absorption\r\nof oxygen, and lose their odor—become resinified—these costly\r\nsubstances must be put into small bottles which they completely\r\nfill, and be preserved in a cool dark place, as light and heat favor\r\nresinification. The bottles must be closed with well-fitting glass\r\nstoppers.\r\n\r\nAromatic waters or eaux aromatisées, such as jasmine water (eau de\r\njasmin), orange-flower water (eau de fleurs d’oranges, eau triple de\r\nNéroli, aqua naphæ triplex), etc., are made by distillation of these\r\nflowers with water and show a faint but very fine odor. When they\r\ncontain, besides, dilute alcohol they are called spirituous waters\r\nor esprits. Those brought into commerce from southern France are of\r\nexcellent quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YIELD OF ESSENTIAL OILS.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of essential oil obtainable from the vegetable\r\nsubstances vary with the amount present in each.

than\r\nthat of the fresh, because the latter contain much water which is\r\nlost in drying. When such vegetable materials cannot be worked fresh,\r\nwhich is best, they should be completely dried, spread on boards, at\r\na moderate temperature in the shade and preserved in dry airy rooms,\r\nspecial care being had to guard against mould.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AROMATIC SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter on the chemical properties of the vegetable\r\nsubstances many of their characteristics have been described. In this\r\nplace we need only describe the physical properties of the essential\r\noils, and with some of them to lay stress on those peculiarities by\r\nwhich they are specially differentiated. This knowledge is of the\r\ngreatest importance to the manufacturer of perfumery because no\r\nsingle individual is in a position to prepare all aromatic substances\r\nhimself, but must rely on commerce for some of them; and in no group of\r\nchemicals is adulteration as frequent and as difficult of demonstration\r\nas among the aromatics. These adulterations are carried so far that\r\nmany essential oils occurring in commerce under certain names often\r\nhave nothing in common with the substance for which they are sold but\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CASSIE.\r\n\r\nThe oil of Acacia farnesiana is greenish-yellow and viscid; the density\r\nand boiling-point, which are of the greatest importance with reference\r\nto the genuineness of an essential oil, are not yet accurately known.\r\nMoreover, this oil never occurs in commerce as such, but its odor is\r\npresent in perfumes, fixed oils, and pomades.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF ANISE\r\n\r\nshould be colorless or faintly yellow; a dark yellow color indicates\r\nold and inferior quality. The characteristics of this oil are the odor,\r\nits aromatic sweet taste, and especially the property of solidifying\r\nat a comparatively high temperature, 10-15° C. (50-59° F.), which\r\nis due to the separation of a stearopten, anethol. Oil of anise is\r\nfrequently adulterated with or replaced by oil of star-anise. The easy\r\nsolidification of the oil of anise is not always proof of its good\r\nquality, for the oil from anise chaff, which congeals at a still higher\r\ntemperature, is sometimes mixed with it, and this has a less fine odor\r\nthan that distilled from the seed. One part by weight of oil of anise\r\nis soluble in an equal weight of alcohol of 94%.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF BERGAMOT\r\n\r\nhas a pale yellow color which becomes greenish when the oil is kept in\r\ncopper vessels, and a strong agreeable odor. This oil requires the\r\ngreatest care in its preservation, as it abstracts oxygen from the air\r\nwith extreme rapidity, when it changes its superior odor so that it can\r\nhardly be distinguished from oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF BITTER ALMOND (OLEUM AMYGDALE AMARÆ),\r\n\r\nwhen pure, is a colorless, refractive liquid which is heavier than\r\nwater. The vessels in which this product is preserved must be stoppered\r\nair-tight, for in the air the oil very quickly changes into a white,\r\nodorless mass of crystals consisting of benzoic acid.\r\n\r\nOil of bitter almond is formed by the action of the amygdalin upon the\r\nemulsin present in the fruit, bitter-almond meal being deprived of\r\nfat and left in contact with water for some hours at from 40-45° C.\r\n(104-113° F.). Besides oil of bitter almond, sugar and prussic acid are\r\nlikewise formed. The crude oil distilled from the meal is freed from\r\nthe prussic acid by agitation with ferrous chloride and lime-water, and\r\nredistillation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CAJEPUT (OLEUM CAJUPUTI)\r\n\r\nhas usually a greenish color, and has a burning, camphoraceous and at\r\nthe same time cooling taste. It has a peculiar odor resembling that of\r\ncamphor and rosemary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CALAMUS (OLEUM CALAMI).\r\n\r\nThis oil, which is very viscid and of a yellow or reddish color, must\r\nusually be mixed with other essential oils in order to furnish pleasant\r\nperfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CHAMOMILE (OLEUM CHAMOMILLÆ).\r\n\r\nOil of chamomile, from Matricaria Chamomilla (common chamomile), which\r\nis specially characterized by its magnificent dark-blue color, has a\r\nmarked narcotic odor and is very high-priced, owing to the small yield\r\nof oil by the flowers. The oil from Anthemis nobilis (Roman chamomile)\r\nhas also a blue color which gradually becomes greenish-yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR (CAMPHORA).\r\n\r\nThis essential oil differs from the others mainly by being firm and\r\ncrystalline at ordinary temperatures. Chinese or Japanese camphor melts\r\nat 175° C. (347° F.) and boils at 205° C. (401° F.). Camphor is seldom\r\nused alone, as its odor is hardly fragrant; but it finds frequent\r\napplication in the preparation of mouth washes, toilet vinegars, etc.\r\nIn commerce so-called Borneo camphor is also met with (though rarely),\r\nwhich closely resembles the Chinese in appearance and other qualities,\r\nbut is more friable and melts at 189° C. (388·4° F.).\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CASCARILLA\r\n\r\nis not used pure in perfumery, the bark being generally employed\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CASSIA (OLEUM CASSIÆ)\r\n\r\nhas a yellow color, gradually becoming dark reddish-brown, and an odor\r\nresembling that of oil of cinnamon, but the odor is not so fine, nor\r\nso strong, as that of the latter. The taste of the oil is of special\r\nimportance: while that of true oil of cinnamon is burning though sweet,\r\noil of cassia has a sharper taste, and this taste is considered by some\r\na good mark of recognition of the rather common adulteration of true\r\noil of cinnamon which is much more costly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CEDAR.\r\n\r\nThis oil, obtained from the wood of the Juniperus virginiana (not from\r\nthe true cedar, Cedrus Libani), is clear like water, has a pleasant\r\nodor, and differs from most essential oils by congealing at a very low\r\ntemperature (-22° C. or-8° F.) and by its uncommon resinification in\r\ncontact with air.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CITRON.\r\n\r\nOil of citron is usually merely a synonym for “oil of lemon.” But in\r\nperfumery it has been customary to designate the oil of lemon which was\r\nextracted by the écuelle process, as “oil of citron-zeste” or “oil of\r\ncitron,” while “oil of lemon” meant the distilled oil. Since there is\r\nno difficulty at the present time in obtaining all the hand-pressed oil\r\nthat may be required, and of the finest quality, there is no longer any\r\nnecessity for making the before-mentioned distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF LEMON (OLEUM LIMONIS, OLEUM CITRI)\r\n\r\nis one of the most important essential oils for the perfumer as well\r\nas the manufacturer of liqueurs, confectioner, etc. The oil is pale\r\nyellow, and of a very strong refreshing odor which it loses rapidly\r\nin contact with the air, when it acquires a disagreeable odor of\r\nturpentine and gradually resinifies. This change is particularly marked\r\nunder the influence of light. Its spec. grav. is 0·850 at 20° C. (68°\r\nF.). It is soluble in an equal volume of strong alcohol or glacial\r\nacetic acid. The hand-pressed oil has a much finer aroma than that\r\nobtained by distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CITRONELLA.\r\n\r\nThis oil is hardly ever made in Europe, since it is imported in\r\nexcellent quality and at low prices from India and especially the\r\nisland of Ceylon. (See above, p. 29.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF LEMON-GRASS.\r\n\r\nThis oil, which is imported in considerable quantities from India\r\n(chiefly Ceylon), is colorless and possesses a very pleasant odor of\r\nlemon which at the same time recalls that of roses and still more that\r\nof geranium, which is not rarely adulterated with it. (See above, p.\r\n33.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CORIANDER (OLEUM CORIANDRI)\r\n\r\nhas a pale yellow color and a burning, sharp, aromatic taste. Like\r\noil of cubebs (oleum cubebæ), oil of dill (oleum anethi), and oil of\r\nfennel (oleum fœniculi) which latter also has a rather low congealing\r\npoint (-8° C. or +17° F.), this oil is used less in perfumery than\r\nfor scenting soap and in the manufacture of liqueurs. But it should\r\nbe noted that these oils, as well as those of bergamot, caraway,\r\nstar-anise, and some others, could well be employed for cheap perfumes\r\nand for scenting soap. Oil of dill also finds application alone in the\r\npreparation of some face washes, and the dried fennel herb in cheap\r\nsachets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF LILAC\r\n\r\ncan be made at slight cost from the flowers, as the raw material is\r\nobtainable without much trouble; it forms a yellow, strong-scented oil.\r\nIn perfumery, however, use is generally made only of the pomade made\r\nfrom the fresh flowers or the alcoholic extract prepared from it. Or\r\nelse the odor is imitated by means of terpineol, which is now on the\r\nmarket under the name of lilacin.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF GERANIUM.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to distinguish clearly between oil of true geranium\r\ndistilled in Southern France and Algiers from species of Pelargonium;\r\nand Turkish oil of geranium, also known as Palmarosa oil, oil of\r\ngeranium grass, oil of Rusa grass, etc., which is distilled in India\r\nfrom ginger grass. (See above, p. 33.)\r\n\r\nThe first-mentioned oil has a much finer aroma than the second. The two\r\noils are frequently confounded, even in prominent works of reference.\r\n\r\nWhen oil of geranium or of rose geranium is directed to be used, the\r\nFrench (or Algerian, or Spanish) oil should be employed. These cost\r\nmore than twice as much as the so-called Turkish or palmarosa oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF HELIOTROPE.\r\n\r\nThis oil which does not yet occur in commerce (we find merely the\r\npomade and the alcoholic extract of the latter) has been made by\r\nthe author experimentally; the most suitable method was found to be\r\nextraction with petroleum ether. As the plant, Heliotropium peruvianum,\r\nthe source of this delightful odor, is frequently cultivated in\r\nour gardens, the preparation of the oil by this method is to be\r\nrecommended, being less expensive and more rapid than by the use of\r\nfat, while the product obtained with petroleum ether is as fine as that\r\nextracted by alcohol from the pomade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF ELDER (OLEUM SAMBUCI).\r\n\r\nThe remark made under the head of oil of lilac applies equally to this\r\noil. For the benefit of those who wish to make this oil in its pure\r\nform we may add that it is absolutely necessary to select only the\r\nfreshest flowers, otherwise the odor will be very much impaired.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF JASMINE,\r\n\r\nnot to be confounded with the oil of Syringa or German jasmine\r\n(Philadelphus coronarius), is colorless or yellowish and has a very\r\nstrong, almost narcotic odor. It is one of the most valuable and at the\r\nsame time most expensive aromatic substances employed in perfumery.\r\nGenuine oil of jasmine can be obtained only from Southern France at\r\nvery high prices. What is usually sold as “oil of jasmine” is a fixed\r\noil impregnated with the aroma of jasmine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CHERRY-LAUREL\r\n\r\nis not used as such in perfumery; at most cherry-laurel water may be\r\nemployed. But as this has the odor of oil of bitter almond and as\r\nthe presence of some prussic acid, on account of which the officinal\r\ncherry-laurel water is used, is of no value to the perfumer and is,\r\nin fact, undesirable, owing to its poisonous quality, we substitute\r\nin all cases a corresponding quantity of oil of bitter almond for\r\ncherry-laurel water.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CULILABAN (OLEUM CULILAVANI)\r\n\r\nis light brown, somewhat viscid; the odor recalls that of the oils of\r\ncinnamon, sassafras, and clove. It has been used for scenting soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CARAWAY (OLEUM CARI)\r\n\r\nis light yellow and has an aromatic odor and burning taste. In\r\nperfumery it is used only for very cheap odors and for scenting soap;\r\nit finds its chief application in the manufacture of liqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF LAVENDER (OLEUM LAVANDULÆ).\r\n\r\nThis oil is of great importance to the perfumer and is imported in\r\nunsurpassed quality from England (Mitcham); it is light yellow, has a\r\nburning sharp taste, and is exceedingly sensitive to light and air,\r\nunder the action of which it loses its refreshing odor in a very brief\r\ntime and acquires a common smell recalling that of turpentine.\r\n\r\nThe buyer of this oil should take care to secure the true oil of\r\nlavender (from Lavandula vera); for the oil of spike-lavender is sold\r\nunder the same name. This, prepared from Lavandula Spica, has a similar\r\nodor to the genuine, but cannot be compared with it in delicacy. For\r\nthis reason, too, the difference in the price between the two is\r\nconsiderable. True English oil of lavender costs ten times as much\r\nas oil of spike-lavender. The English brand of the true oil is of so\r\nexcellent a quality that it brings four or five times as much as the\r\nbest French oil, which is sold under the name of huile de lavande des\r\nAlpes. Yet during the last decade or so the French oil of lavender\r\nflowers has become so much improved in quality that it has become a\r\nserious rival to the Mitcham oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF WALLFLOWER\r\n\r\nmade from the flowers of the well-known garden plant, and\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF LILY\r\n\r\nlikewise from the ornamental plant, are, strange to say, not\r\nmanufactured in any place, to our knowledge. Experiments made by us in\r\nthis direction prove that the odors of these plants can be obtained\r\neither by absorption or, more readily, by extraction. The perfumes thus\r\nfar occurring under these names are always combinations of different\r\nscents which, though pleasant, have but little in common with the\r\nplants whose names they bear.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may say that the perfumes sold under the names\r\nof various flowers often have no relation to them, but are mixtures\r\nof various odors. While it cannot be denied that perfumes may be made\r\nin this manner which resemble those of the respective plants, it is\r\nunquestionably an imperfection in the art of perfumery that these\r\nodors are not really made from the flowers mentioned. To give another\r\ncharacteristic instance, we may add that the delightful odor of the\r\nwell-known lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis)—a plant which grows\r\nwild abundantly in many of our forests—has not yet been produced, and\r\nthat even imitations of this odor, which in delicacy and fragrance\r\nstands next to those of the rose and violet, are seldom met with in\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF LEMON (OLEUM LIMONIS),\r\n\r\nobtained from the fruits of the lemon-tree, is one of the most\r\nimportant products, both statistically and economically, of the Citrus\r\nfamily. In German works there is often a confusion between “oil of\r\ncitron” and “oil of lemon,” it being supposed by the authors that the\r\n“Citronen-öl” is derived from the citron (Citrus medica), and the\r\n“Limonen-öl” from the lemon (Citrus Limonum). There is, indeed, some\r\noil made, occasionally, from the citron, but it does not figure in\r\nprice-lists. The oil of the lemon, on the other hand, is very commonly\r\ncalled “Citronen-öl,” and the fruit itself “Citrone.” Hence, when\r\n“Citronen-öl” is quoted in a formula, it may be assumed at once that\r\noil of lemon is intended. It is very liable to resinify, when it loses\r\nits fragrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF SWEET BAY (LAUREL) (OLEUM LAURI)\r\n\r\nis green, and usually mixed with the fixed oil of the same plant. It\r\nfinds more frequent application in the manufacture of liqueurs than\r\nin perfumery; but as it has a pleasant odor it might well be used for\r\ncheap perfumes. But in that event it must be freed from the fixed oil\r\nby distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF MAGNOLIA,\r\n\r\nlikewise, has not yet been prepared as such. The remarks made above\r\nunder the head of oils of lily and wallflower apply also to this odor.\r\nThe so-called magnolia perfumes are mixtures of different odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF MARJORAM (OLEUM MAJORANÆ).\r\n\r\nOil of marjoram, which is obtained by distillation from the dried\r\nherb, has a strong aromatic odor. It is mentioned as having often been\r\nused in perfumery for scenting soap instead of oil of thyme, whose\r\nodor, moreover, is very similar to that of marjoram, but this is a\r\nmistake, due to the fact that ordinary oil of thyme has long been sold\r\nunder the name of oil of origanum. True oil of marjoram costs about\r\ntwelve dollars a pound, while oil of thyme (so-called oil of origanum)\r\nis worth only about eighty cents. It is rarely employed for volatile\r\nperfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF MELISSA.\r\n\r\nThe oil of Melissa officinalis, owing to the very small yield, is quite\r\nexpensive. It is used only for the preparation of some perfumes which\r\nowe their peculiar qualities to this strong odor. This oil must not\r\nbe confounded with the spurious oil of melissa, also called oil of\r\ncitron-melissa, which is identical with oil of lemon grass (see page\r\n30).\r\n\r\n\r\nOILS OF MINT.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the mints possess an agreeable odor, only three varieties\r\nfind extensive application. There are the oils from Mentha piperita,\r\npeppermint; Mentha viridis, spearmint; and Mentha crispa, crispmint.\r\nThe oils of English manufacture are highly esteemed, but the United\r\nStates also produces them of excellent quality. At one time the\r\ncultivation of mints, particularly peppermint, was greatly extended,\r\nwith the expectation of deriving satisfactory profit from the\r\nenterprise. It has, however, been conclusively shown that the market\r\ncannot absorb more than a certain quantity of these products; and that\r\nany over-production brings loss and disappointment to the investor.\r\nBeside the three kinds of mint above mentioned, there is another\r\nspecies, Mentha arvensis, a native of Japan, which is extensively\r\ncultivated there, and is the chief source of the menthol of commerce,\r\nso well known as an efficient remedy for neuralgia, migraine, etc., in\r\nform of menthol cones. The three varieties of the mint oils previously\r\nmentioned are distinguished, aside from their pleasant odor, by the\r\nproperty of leaving a very refreshing and cooling taste in the mouth,\r\nand for this reason they form the most important constituent of all\r\nfine mouth washes.\r\n\r\nTrue oil of peppermint, Oleum Menthæ piperitæ, when pure is colorless,\r\nvery mobile, of a burning sharp taste which is followed by a peculiar\r\ncoolness. The commercial product is usually pale green. Oil of\r\ncrispmint, Oleum Menthæ crispæ, which in Europe is often sold to\r\nnovices as oil of peppermint, has always a more or less yellow color\r\nand resembles the oil of peppermint in its properties, but it is less\r\nfine and cheaper. The same is true of the oil of spearmint, but this\r\nhas a very characteristic odor and taste, distinctly different from\r\npeppermint.\r\n\r\nAs above stated, the oils of mint are extensively used for mouth\r\nwashes, also for scenting soap, in liqueurs and pastils, but rarely in\r\nhandkerchief perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOILS OF MACE AND NUTMEG (OLEUM MACIDIS AND OLEUM MYRISTICÆ).\r\n\r\nThese oils are prepared either from the seed coat (Oleum Macidis)\r\nor the nutmeg itself (Oleum Myristicæ). Oil of mace generally has\r\na yellowish-red color in tint varying from dark to light and even\r\ncolorless. Its taste is agreeable and mild and the odor exceedingly\r\nstrong. Like oil of nutmeg, it is extensively used in the manufacture\r\nof liqueurs and for scenting soap. The oil prepared by distillation\r\nfrom the nutmeg is, when fresh, almost colorless or at most faintly\r\nyellow, of a burning sharp taste, and an aromatic odor. Like oil of\r\nmace, it is used in the manufacture of liqueurs and soaps and also in\r\nmany perfumes.\r\n\r\nIn India a third valuable product is obtained from the nutmeg by\r\nexpression of the ripe fruits and is called nutmeg butter. This\r\nis bright yellow and consists of a true fat and an essential oil.\r\nIts odor is very pleasant and a very superior soap can be made by\r\nsaponification of this valuable product with soda lye.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF MYRTLE.\r\n\r\nThis oil is of a greenish color and very mobile, but it is not a\r\ncommercial product; the manufacturer must prepare the oil himself from\r\nthe leaves, though the yield is small. The articles sold as so-called\r\nessence of myrtle are always mixtures of different odors. Southern\r\nFrance, however, exports at high prices a myrtle water (eau des anges)\r\nwhich is really made by distillation of the leaves with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF NARCISSUS.\r\n\r\nAs to the odor to which this flower owes its fragrance we may repeat\r\nwhat we have said just now with reference to the oil of myrtle: we\r\nhave never succeeded in obtaining this oil in commerce. The so-called\r\nessence of narcissus, though a very pleasant mixture, contains no trace\r\nof the true oil. As to\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF PINK,\r\n\r\nthe same remark applies: the compositions sold under the name of\r\nessence d’œillet, however, have a very striking odor of pink.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF CLOVE (OLEUM CARYOPHYLLI).\r\n\r\nThis oil when fresh is colorless, but soon becomes yellowish or brown.\r\nIt is heavier than water in which it sinks and is characterized by an\r\nexceedingly strong burning taste and a spicy odor. It remains at least\r\npartly fluid at a very low temperature, namely,-20° C. (-4° F.).\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF ORANGE FLOWERS (OLEUM NAPHÆ, OLEUM NEROLI),\r\n\r\ncommercially known also under the French names huile de fleurs\r\nd’oranges, huile néroli, huile néroli pétale, is obtained from the\r\nflowers of the orange-tree in Southern France, where the orange is\r\nspecially planted for this purpose. The odor of the oil varies with the\r\nmode of its preparation; that obtained by distillation with water has\r\na different odor from that made by maceration with fat and extraction\r\nwith alcohol. The latter variety of oil as such, however, is not\r\nfound in commerce, the alcoholic extract entering at once into the\r\ncomposition of the perfumes.\r\n\r\nThe French manufacturers of this oil, which is of great importance in\r\nperfumery, distinguish several varieties. The most valuable is the oil\r\nfrom the flowers of Citrus vulgaris (or Citrus Bigaradia), the true\r\nbitter orange (or Seville orange) tree. This is the so-called néroli\r\nbigarade. That called néroli pétale is obtained from the same flowers\r\ncarefully deprived of their floral envelopes, so that only the petals\r\nare subjected to distillation. Much cheaper than these two is the oil\r\nof petit grain which is distilled from the leaves and sometimes also\r\nunripe fruits of various trees of the Citrus order.\r\n\r\nAll these oils are among the most delicate; when fresh they are\r\ncolorless and have a peculiar bitter taste; exposed to light and air\r\nthey assume a reddish tint and undergo rapid resinification. They\r\nshould, therefore, be preserved in particularly well-closed vessels in\r\na dark, cool place.\r\n\r\nNot to be confounded with these oils is the\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF ORANGE,\r\n\r\nof which there are two kinds, one from the bitter orange, known also\r\nas Oil of Orange, Bigarade, and the other from the sweet orange, also\r\nknown as Oil of Portugal. Both are extracted from the peel of the fruit\r\nby mechanical means. Both oils of orange peel are golden yellow, and\r\nhave a pleasant, refreshing odor recalling that of the fruit. They\r\nfind application for scenting soap, in toilet waters, and in some true\r\nperfumes. When oil of orange or oil of orange peel is mentioned in any\r\nformula, without further specification, the oil of _bitter_ orange peel\r\nshould be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF PATCHOULY.\r\n\r\nThis oil, which might be manufactured with advantage in India, the\r\nhome of the plant, is, strange to say, not imported from that country,\r\nbut is distilled in Europe from the dried herb. Fresh oil of patchouly\r\nis brown in color, very viscid, almost like balsam, and surpasses all\r\nother essential oils in the intensity of its odor. Owing to the strong\r\nodor, pure oil of patchouly must really be called ill-smelling; only\r\nwhen highly diluted does the odor become pleasant, and then forms a\r\nuseful ingredient of many perfumes as the fundamental odor in the\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF SYRINGA.\r\n\r\nOil of false jasmine, from the flowers of Philadelphus coronarius,\r\nis not made as such; in Southern France, however, the flowers\r\nare frequently used for the preparation of a cheap pomade known\r\ncommercially as orange-flower pomade. A personal experiment made with\r\nthe view to obtain the pure odor by extraction of the flowers with\r\npetroleum ether has shown that this plant is suitable for making very\r\nfine preparations, both handkerchief perfumes and pomades.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF ALLSPICE,\r\n\r\nof a burning sharp taste and odor, is colorless, but is hardly ever\r\nused for the purposes of the perfumer—at most for soaps—but all the\r\nmore frequently in the manufacture of liqueurs, and particularly also\r\nin that of artificial bay-rum.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF SWEET PEA\r\n\r\nhas not been made thus far, though there is no doubt that this perfume,\r\ntoo, can be prepared pure from the alcoholic extract of the pomade.\r\nThe properties of the oil should resemble those of the finest néroli\r\npétale.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF RUE (OLEUM RUTÆ).\r\n\r\nThis oil, obtained by distillation of the herb, is colorless or pale\r\nyellow, of a very strong, penetrating odor; it is used in some washes,\r\nbut more particularly as an ingredient in the manufacture of artificial\r\ncognac, for which purpose the plant is specially cultivated in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF RESEDA (MIGNONETTE).\r\n\r\nThe delightful odor of this plant which formerly could only be fixed by\r\nmaceration in fat may be readily prepared by extraction with petroleum\r\nether. Yet special precautions should be taken that nothing but\r\nportions of the flowers, carefully picked off, and no green leaves are\r\nextracted. The oil thus obtained has a yellow color and a disagreeable\r\nodor which changes into the well-known pleasant smell of the flower\r\nwhen highly diluted with alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF ROSE (OLEUM ROSÆ),\r\n\r\nalso known as attar or otto of rose. The various species of roses give\r\ndifferent odors. The commercial Turkish, Persian, and Indian oils of\r\nrose (which latter is never exported)—which, by the way, are very\r\ngenerally adulterated even at their point of production—are derived\r\nmainly from Rosa damascena, and when highly diluted yield the pleasant\r\nodor of our ordinary garden roses. The rose oils having the odor of the\r\nmoss rose, tea rose, or dog rose are made almost exclusively in France\r\nand in commerce do not appear pure but generally in the form of pomades\r\nor alcoholic solutions known as essences de roses.\r\n\r\nTrue rose oil is yellowish or yellow, or else greenish, and varying\r\nfrom liquid almost to the consistence of butter. Between these\r\nextremes there are all possible gradations. A comparatively very high\r\ncongealing-point is a characteristic of oil of rose. It becomes almost\r\nsolid at 14 to 20° C. (57 to 68° F.). The portion separated during\r\nsolidification is colorless, markedly crystalline, and, strange to say,\r\nalmost odorless. Pure oil of rose smells disagreeably narcotic, only\r\nthe very dilute solution shows the incomparable fragrance.\r\n\r\nMuch superior to the oils of rose which are prepared from rose leaves\r\n(either fresh or salted) are those obtained by maceration or extraction\r\nwith petroleum ether. Those perfumes sold under the name of various\r\nspecies of rose, such as moss rose, etc., are combinations of rose oil\r\nwith other aromatics.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF RHODIUM.\r\n\r\nThis bright yellow light oil is obtained by distillation of the wood of\r\nConvolvulus Scoparius. At times this oil is scarce in commerce. It has\r\na faint but decided odor of rose.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF ROSEMARY (OLEUM ROSMARINI).\r\n\r\nThis oil is obtained by distillation from the herb of the rosemary\r\nplant as a thin, pale green fluid with an aromatic odor and spicy\r\ntaste. It is used as an ingredient in some old renowned handkerchief\r\nperfumes—for instance, Cologne water—also for flavoring soaps and\r\nliqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF SAGE (OLEUM SALVIÆ),\r\n\r\nfrom the flowers of Salvia officinalis, is yellowish, with an odor\r\nsomewhat similar to that of oil of peppermint, but far less intense.\r\nLike the latter it imparts a pleasant coolness to the mouth and hence\r\nis used in some mouth washes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF SANTAL (OLEUM SANTALI).\r\n\r\nThe oil of santal wood (also called sandal-wood oil) has a thick,\r\nhoney-like consistence and an agreeable, rose-like odor. Formerly\r\nit was sometimes used for the adulteration of oil of rose, but can\r\nalso very well be used alone for several perfumes and fumigating\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF SASSAFRAS (OLEUM SASSAFRAS)\r\n\r\nis yellow, spicy, with a burning odor and taste; in the cold it\r\ncrystallizes only in part. The odor of this oil recalls that of fennel.\r\nThe purest form of it, or rather substitute for it, is safrol, its main\r\nconstituent, which is, however, now extracted more economically from\r\ncrude oil of camphor, in which it likewise forms an ingredient.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF MEADOW-SWEET (OLEUM SPIRÆÆ).\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Spiræa, and especially Spiræa ulmaria, furnish very\r\npleasant odors. This oil consists mainly of salicylic aldehyde.\r\n\r\nDespite its pleasant odor and the facility of its production, this\r\nsubstance has thus far found little application in perfumery. The\r\nnatural oil of meadowsweet, owing to its extremely high price, can\r\nhardly ever be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF STAR-ANISE (OLEUM ANISI STELLATI; OLEUM ILLICII)\r\n\r\nresembles in its properties the oil of anise, even in its odor; but\r\nall connoisseurs agree that the odor of the oil of star-anise far\r\nsurpasses that of the oil of anise, hence the former is used especially\r\nfor fine perfumes. This preference, however, does not extend to all\r\npreparations. For certain liqueurs, such as anisette, the oil obtained\r\nfrom common anise (Saxon anise) is usually preferred. Many also regard\r\nthe odor of star-anise as inferior to that of fine European anise.\r\n\r\n\r\nOILS OF THYME (OLEUM THYMI).\r\n\r\nThe essential oils of thyme (chiefly Thymus vulgaris) and some related\r\nplants are very frequently used for scenting cheap soaps. The oils of\r\nthese plants are light yellow, and so similar in odor that it is not\r\npossible to distinguish them except by direct comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF VANILLA,\r\n\r\nor, more correctly, vanilla camphor, the true odorous constituent\r\nof vanilla, also called vanillin, is a crystalline substance with a\r\ndelightful odor, melting at 76° C. (169° F.). This is now extensively\r\nmade artificially from the cambium sap of pines, the coniferin being\r\nconverted by chemical processes into vanillin. One ounce of good\r\nvanillin is equivalent to about forty ounces of best Mexican vanilla\r\nbeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF VIOLET\r\n\r\nhas thus far been produced in but very small quantities from the\r\nalcoholic extract of the true violet pomade; it has a greenish color\r\nand when pure a narcotic odor not to be recognized as that of the\r\nflower. The pleasant odor of violets manifests itself only in extreme\r\ndilution.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF VERBENA\r\n\r\nis yellow, with a very pleasant odor of lemons. Its price being quite\r\nhigh, it is usually adulterated with oil of lemon-grass, or else\r\nthe latter is sold under the name of oil of verbena (see p. 30). In\r\nfact the odors of the two oils are so similar that they are easily\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF VETIVER (OLEUM IVARANCHUSÆ),\r\n\r\nfrom Andropogon muricatus (see p. 30), is viscid, reddish-brown, with a\r\nvery strong and lasting odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF WINTERGREEN (OLEUM GAULTHERIÆ).\r\n\r\nThis product is obtained by distillation from the leaves and twigs\r\nof Gaultheria procumbens or else by distilling the bark or leaves\r\nof Betula lenta with water, in which case the oil is generated by\r\nthe action of the water, as it does not pre-exist in the birch,\r\nand, moreover, in this case the oil consists of nothing but methyl\r\nsalicylate. It differs, like oil of meadowsweet, very markedly from\r\nthe other aromatic substances and mainly consists of a so-called\r\ncompound ether. It is a salicylate of methyl, boils at 220° C. (428°\r\nF.), is much heavier than water (specific gravity 1·173 to 1·184), and\r\ndissolves readily in alcohol and other solvents. It is used chiefly for\r\nscenting soap; the perfumes sold as wintergreen are usually mixtures of\r\ndifferent substances which contain no oil of wintergreen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF YLANG-YLANG (OLEUM UNONÆ ODORATISSIMÆ)\r\n\r\nis imported from Manilla. It is colorless or yellowish, and has a most\r\ndelightful characteristic odor, which is rather fugitive if not made\r\nresistant by other substances. It forms an important constituent of\r\nseveral of the most favorite and expensive essences.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF HYSSOP (OLEUM HYSSOPI)\r\n\r\nis colorless, but rapidly becomes yellow in the air. It is used in some\r\nvery cheap perfumes and in the manufacture of liqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOILS OF CINNAMON (OLEUM CINNAMOMI).\r\n\r\nCommercially we find chiefly three varieties of essential oils which\r\nare designated as: oil of Ceylon cinnamon, oil of Chinese cinnamon or\r\noil of cassia, and oil of cinnamon leaves. Oil of Ceylon cinnamon,\r\nsometimes called “true oil of cinnamon,” made from the bark of the\r\ntwigs of the cinnamon laurel and formerly imported mainly from Ceylon\r\nbut now distilled in large amounts in Germany from imported cinnamon\r\n“chips,” is rather viscid, golden yellow to reddish-brown in color, of\r\na burning though sweet taste. In the air it gradually absorbs oxygen,\r\nwhen it becomes dark red, thicker, and of weaker flavor. Oil of Ceylon\r\ncinnamon, which should always be used in perfumes or liqueurs when\r\nsimply “oil of cinnamon” is directed, has a specific gravity of 1·030\r\nto 1·035 at 15° C. (59° F.) and boils at about 240° C. (464° F.). Its\r\nchief constituent upon which its aroma depends is cinnamyl aldehyde.\r\n\r\nOil of Chinese cinnamon, or oil of cassia, has for a very long time,\r\nup to within a few years, always reached the market in a more or less\r\nadulterated state, a regular practice of the Chinese exporters being\r\nto dissolve ordinary resin in it (claiming afterward that the “resin”\r\nwas caused by the oxidation of the oil through age) and often also to\r\nadd petroleum to it. These frauds have been well shown up by Schimmel\r\n& Co., of Leipsic; and in consequence thereof, the quality of oil of\r\ncassia exported from China has been greatly improved. Oil of cassia\r\nwhen pure has a specific gravity of 1·060 to 1·065, and should contain\r\nnot less than seventy-five per cent of cinnamyl aldehyde.\r\n\r\nOil of cinnamon leaves is an inferior product, often used for\r\nadulterating oil of Ceylon cinnamon. It does not deserve notice by the\r\nperfumer.\r\n\r\nAs an appendix we may add in this connection a description of the\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL OF TURPENTINE (OLEUM TEREBINTHINÆ),\r\n\r\nbecause it must be called an important substance to know for the\r\nperfumer, inasmuch as it is very frequently used for the adulteration\r\nof different essential oils. Oil of turpentine, which is obtained from\r\nincisions into the bark of different fir and pine trees, the exuding\r\nresin being distilled with water, comes into commerce from various\r\nsources. Different sorts are distinguished, but to the perfumer only\r\nthe rectified oil of turpentine, oleum terebinthinæ rectificatum, is\r\nimportant. Oil of turpentine has a yellowish color and a decidedly\r\ndisagreeable, resinous, and burnt taste. By repeated distillation,\r\nespecially over quicklime or chloride of lime (bleaching powder), it is\r\nfinally obtained as a colorless, very refractive liquid with a density\r\nof 0·855 to 0·870 and a boiling-point at 160° C. (320° F.). Its odor\r\nis peculiar, but not easily distinguished from that of old essential\r\noils, such as oils of caraway, anise, etc. One peculiarity of oil of\r\nturpentine is that its odor is easily masked by that of other essential\r\noils, so that, for instance, a comparatively large quantity of oil of\r\nturpentine needs the addition of but little oil of anise to impart to\r\nthe entire mixture a rather pronounced odor of anise. This peculiarity\r\nhas led to the frequent employment of rectified oil of turpentine for\r\nthe adulteration of other essential oils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE ADULTERATIONS OF ESSENTIAL OILS AND THEIR RECOGNITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find it necessary to devote a special chapter to the adulterations\r\nof the commercial essential oils because an experience of many years\r\nhas shown us that hardly any other group of products is subject to\r\nso many sophistications as essential oils. The high price of most\r\naromatic substances and the difficulty of recognizing the adulteration\r\nfurnish an inviting field to the unscrupulous manufacturer. In the\r\nbest interest of the perfumer, therefore, we advise the purchase of\r\nessential oils only from renowned reliable houses, even at higher\r\nprices, for the cheap commercial products are almost worthless, since\r\nthey are almost without exception adulterated.\r\n\r\nThe adulterations are very manifold. Some expensive oils are mixed\r\nwith cheaper ones having a similar odor—for instance, oil of rose with\r\noil of geranium or oil of geranium grass; oil of orange flowers with\r\nthe oil from Philadelphus coronarius; oil of verbena with oil of lemon\r\ngrass; oils of caraway, anise, and fennel with oil of turpentine; oil\r\nof cinnamon with oil of cassia, etc. Besides these, other deceptions\r\nare practised—for instance, oil of anise is mixed with oil of\r\nturpentine and in order to make the mixture congeal readily (which is\r\nthe characteristic of true oil of anise, as above stated) paraffin\r\nor spermaceti is added. A similar practice prevails with adulterated\r\noil of rose and other viscid oils. Oil of bitter almond we have found\r\nadulterated with or entirely replaced by nitrobenzol, etc.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of the adulteration of an essential oil by chemical\r\nmeans offers many difficulties. We devote particular attention to\r\nthe physical characteristics, for experience has shown us that the\r\nolfactory organ—provided it is very expert—is often able to determine\r\nthe genuineness of any aromatic substance when other tests have given\r\nonly uncertain results, or can give certain results only in the hands\r\nof experts. To make this test, however, quite reliable, it is necessary\r\nto be familiar with the substances in their pure unadulterated\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer of perfumery, therefore, should spare neither trouble\r\nnor pecuniary sacrifices to obtain possession of absolutely genuine\r\nspecimens of those essential oils, even in minute quantities, which\r\nhe intends to employ. Such samples should be carefully preserved\r\n(protected from heat, evaporation, daylight, etc.) for the purpose of\r\nimmediate comparison with the oils to be purchased.\r\n\r\nAs above stated, the physical properties of the essential oils\r\nusually furnish the means of recognizing their purity, and these give\r\nmore reliable results to the practical perfumer than the chemical\r\ntests. The most valuable points are furnished by the boiling-point,\r\nthe congealing-point, and the density of the oils. The following\r\ntable gives the boiling and congealing points of the most important\r\nessential oils in degrees of the centigrade thermometer, together with\r\nthe density (or specific gravity); where two figures are given, they\r\nindicate the extreme limits found in genuine samples.\r\n\r\nSpecial characteristics of some essential oils with reference to their\r\naction at low temperatures or their melting-point are given in the\r\ncolumn “Remarks.”\r\n\r\nOil of turpentine, paraffin, wax, and spermaceti being frequently used\r\nfor the adulteration of essential oils, have been included in the table.\r\n\r\nIf accurate results are aimed at in the examination of an essential\r\noil according to this table, the specific gravity should be determined\r\nby means of a scale sensitive to one one-thousandth gram, and the\r\nthermometer should be graduated to the tenth of a degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n TABLE SHOWING THE APPROXIMATE DENSITY, BOILING AND CONGEALING POINTS\r\n OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ESSENTIAL OILS USED IN PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n  —————————————————+—————————————+—————————-+————————————-+—————————————\r\n                   |             | Boiling- | Congealing- |\r\n   Essential Oil   | Density.    |  Point,  |    Point,   |   Remarks.\r\n        of         |             | Deg.

He must look for certain substances which are generally\r\nused for the sophistication of essential oils. These are: A. Other\r\nessential oils; B. Fixed oils; C. Alcohol; D. Paraffin, spermaceti,\r\nwax.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. ADULTERATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS WITH OTHER ESSENTIAL OILS.\r\n\r\nThis mode of adulteration, which is frequent, is naturally the one\r\nmost difficult of demonstration. In the case of cheap oils such as\r\nthose of caraway, lemon, orange peel, etc., rectified oil of turpentine\r\nis almost without exception the adulterant. The methods usually\r\nrecommended, such as attempting to dissolve out the oil of turpentine\r\nby strong alcohol, hoping thus to separate it from the essential oil,\r\nare without practical value.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration can, however, often be demonstrated by rubbing a drop\r\nof the suspected oil on a glass plate and testing the odor, provided\r\nthe olfactory organ is trained. As the above table shows, the oils\r\nhave different high boiling-points, while oil of turpentine boils at a\r\nrather low temperature, hence it evaporates sooner than the others and\r\ncan be demonstrated by its odor.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of an adulteration with an essential oil is most\r\ncertain by so-called fractional distillation. Some of the oil to be\r\nexamined (about four to six fluidrachms) is placed in a small retort\r\nwith condenser and heated to a temperature a few degrees below the\r\nboiling-point of the oil in question. If, for instance, oil of bergamot\r\nadulterated with oil of turpentine is to be tested, it is heated\r\ncarefully to nearly 188° C. (370° F.), the boiling-point of the oil of\r\nbergamot; the oil of turpentine which boils at 160° C. (320° F.) passes\r\nover completely, while the oil of bergamot remains in the retort.\r\n\r\nFractional distillation is also the most reliable way of demonstrating\r\nan adulteration with a fixed oil or with paraffin, wax, or spermaceti.\r\nAn adulteration of oil of lavender with oil of spike-lavender, which\r\nis otherwise barely recognizable, is positively shown by this method;\r\neven oil of geranium in oil of rose, oil of cassia in oil of cinnamon,\r\netc., may be thus demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. ADULTERATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS WITH FIXED OILS.\r\n\r\nAn addition of fixed oils can be easily demonstrated by agitation of\r\nthe oil with strong alcohol in which the essential oil dissolves,\r\nwhile the fixed oil remains unchanged. Castor oil, however, is\r\nlikewise soluble in alcohol and for this reason is frequently used\r\nfor the adulteration of essential oils. Yet the presence of a fixed\r\noil can also be shown in a very simple manner by placing a drop of\r\nthe suspected oil upon white paper and leaving it for some hours in\r\na warm spot. If the oil was pure, the translucent stain on the paper\r\nwill disappear completely (also when the oil was adulterated with\r\nturpentine); but if it was mixed with a fixed oil, the stain will\r\nremain permanently and cannot be removed from the paper even by strong\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. ADULTERATION WITH ALCOHOL.\r\n\r\nThis frequent adulteration is demonstrated either by fractional\r\ndistillation, when the alcohol passes over first between 70° and 80° C.\r\n(158° and 176° F.), or by the use of the vessel illustrated in Fig. 31,\r\nwhich is divided into 100 equal parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nThe vessel is filled to the tenth division with the oil to be tested,\r\nand water is added to bring the volume to the 50 mark. If alcohol is\r\npresent, it is taken up by the water so that the volume of oil appears\r\nto diminish. If the oil reaches to the mark 7, it contained three\r\nvolumes of alcohol, or in other words it was mixed with thirty per cent\r\nof alcohol. It is true, essential oils likewise dissolve somewhat in\r\nwater, but in such minute quantities as not to affect the success of\r\nthe test.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. ADULTERATION WITH PARAFFIN, SPERMACETI, OR WAX.\r\n\r\nThis mode of adulteration is practised mainly with viscid oils which\r\ncongeal at rather high temperatures, such as oils of anise, rose, etc.,\r\nthe essential oils being usually mixed at the same time with oil of\r\nturpentine or paraffin. The fraud is easily detected by fractional\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nOil of bitter almonds is often adulterated with oil of mirbane; this\r\ncan be demonstrated by shaking 1 volume of the oil with 17 volumes\r\nof alcohol of 45%, and setting the mixture aside to settle. The\r\nnitrobenzol (oil of mirbane) will then collect at the bottom. Oil of\r\nRose may be tested as follows: Mix the oil with an equal quantity of\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid. Neither the color nor the odor of the oil\r\nshould be changed, but if oil of geranium was present a disagreeable\r\nodor and a darker color is produced.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed, too, to test the oils by heating with iodine\r\nor nitric acid and determining the purity by the reaction; but the\r\nresults with the different oils are so similar that the test is\r\nalmost worthless. We have had the same experience with the test by\r\nnitro-prusside of copper which on being heated with essential oils\r\ngives colored precipitates differing with various oils, but still so\r\nsimilar that they cannot be relied upon. We have found in all cases\r\nthat a comparison of an oil with a sample of known purity is the best,\r\nor else the tests given in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE ESSENCES OR EXTRACTS EMPLOYED IN PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _essence_ or _extract_ in perfumery means a solution of an\r\naromatic substance in strong alcohol. These solutions are generally\r\nmade as concentrated as possible and in this form find application in\r\nthe manufacture of handkerchief perfumes and of certain odors bearing a\r\nspecial name. The so-called extrait d’œillet, extract of pink, or the\r\nfavorite perfumes known as new-mown hay have nothing in common with\r\neither pink or hay except the name; like many other odors, both are\r\nmerely mixtures of different essences or extracts.\r\n\r\nBesides the manufacture of true perfumes, essences or extracts are\r\nalso used for scenting fine soaps, sachets, mouth washes, etc. For the\r\nlatter, too, use is often made of the so-called aromatic waters (eaux\r\naromatisées) which are obtained as a by-product in the distillation of\r\nfragrant plants, and have a very fine odor owing to the small amount\r\nof the aromatic substance they hold in solution. To this class belong\r\norange-flower water (Aqua Naphæ triplex, eau de fleurs d’oranges),\r\npeppermint water (Aqua Menthæ, eau de menthe), and many others.\r\n\r\nEssences or extracts can be made in two ways: in the case of aromatic\r\nsubstances which are obtainable in the pure state—that is, essential\r\noils—by dissolving them in strong alcohol in definite proportions;\r\nin the case of aromatics combined with a fatty substance by one of\r\nthe processes described above, by treating the pomade (lard, or other\r\nperfectly bland, sweet, and in itself odorless fat combined with the\r\naromatic) or huile antique (fixed oil holding the aromatic substance\r\nin solution) with the strongest alcohol.\r\n\r\nAccording to the action of the alcohol upon the pomade or huile antique\r\nat ordinary or higher temperature, the process is called cold or warm\r\ninfusion. Cold infusion furnishes the odor in a much more delicate and\r\nsuperior form than the warm. The cold infusion requires for complete\r\nsolution of the aromatic four to six weeks; the warm, ten to fourteen\r\ndays. Although the former consumes a much longer time, it is to be\r\npreferred, as the heat injures the odor. Pomades or huiles antiques are\r\nnever completely exhausted by a single treatment with alcohol. Even\r\nwhen heat is employed they always retain a portion of the aromatic with\r\ngreat tenacity; a second and third infusion still abstracts odor from\r\nthem, and finally nothing remains but pure fat with a pleasant odor\r\nwhich is stained and sold commercially as pomade under the name of the\r\nrespective odor—violet, orange flower, reseda, etc.—or else is used\r\nover again in the factory for the extraction of flowers.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown us that it is best to infuse the pomades or huiles\r\nantiques twice in the cold and to use the two fluids united for the\r\nfinest perfumes; the residue by warm infusion furnishes an essence of\r\nsecond quality, and superior pomades or fragrant oils. The infusion is\r\ngenerally effected in strong glass bottles of a capacity of three to\r\nfive gallons; about five to six quarts of cologne spirit being poured\r\nover six to eight pounds or pints of fat or huile antique.\r\n\r\nIn treating huiles antiques all parts of the oil should be brought into\r\ncontact with the alcohol as much as possible, hence the bottles must\r\nbe frequently shaken; a better plan is to bring the tightly closed\r\nbottles into an apparatus in which they are constantly agitated by\r\nrotation. Such an apparatus is easily made by placing the bottles in\r\nan inclined position between two rods fastened to a common axis which\r\nis kept revolving. The adjoining illustration (Fig. 32) shows such a\r\ncontrivance which is required also in the manufacture of perfumes. The\r\nrotation may be effected by clockwork, water power, or any other motor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nPomades being solid must be divided into small pieces which may be done\r\nwith a knife, but the following procedure is more suitable and less\r\nlaborious. The pomade is placed in a tin cylinder four inches wide and\r\nabout a foot high, which is open at one end, the other being closed\r\nwith a tin plate having several fine openings. The cylinder filled with\r\npomade is set upon the bottle containing the alcohol for extraction,\r\nand the pomade is pressed through the openings in the shape of thin\r\nthreads by means of a piston.\r\n\r\nIn this way, of course, the pomade acquires a very large surface and\r\nrapidly yields the aromatic substance to the alcohol. The odor of\r\nthe pomade differs according to the length of time which it has been\r\nsubjected to the flowers, and on being treated with alcohol furnishes\r\nextracts of corresponding strength. This should be borne in mind in the\r\nmanufacture of perfumes which are intended to be uniform in quality.\r\n\r\nAfter two cold and one warm infusion of the pomade, it may be made to\r\nyield some more aromatic material by heating it carefully to its exact\r\nmelting-point, when extract again appears on the surface and can be\r\npoured off by gentle inclination of the vessel.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we give the proportions by weight and\r\nmeasure employed by the most important French, English, and German\r\nmanufacturers for their pomade extracts or solutions of the essential\r\noils in alcohol. As to the latter we again repeat that it must be over\r\n88 to 90% strength according to Tralles or even stronger, and that it\r\nmust be absolutely free from any trace of amyl alcohol (potato fusel\r\noil), the least amount of which impairs the delicacy of the odor. In\r\nthis country (the United States) there is no difficulty whatever in\r\nobtaining alcohol of proper strength. The market offers scarcely any\r\nother but that of 94%. Of course deodorized alcohol, or so-called\r\nCologne spirit should be used. Grain and wine spirits are the kinds\r\nwhich when rectified are to be preferred to all others. All the citron\r\noils (_i.e._, oils of lemon, bergamot, and those with similar odor),\r\nrose oils (oils of rose, geranium, and rhodium), and many other sweet\r\nscents are most fragrant when dissolved in pure spirit of wine, while\r\nthe odors from the animal kingdom and those of violet (violet and orris\r\nroot) smell sweetest when dissolved in grain spirit.\r\n\r\nThe essences prepared from pomades or huiles antiques usually contain\r\nin solution some fat which is best removed by cooling. To this end the\r\nvessels containing the essences are placed in a vat and surrounded with\r\npellets of ice and crystals of chloride of calcium. By this mixture the\r\ntemperature can be reduced below-20° C. (-4° F.), and after some time\r\nthe fats are deposited in a solid form at the bottom of the vessel.\r\nThis is then taken from the vat and the essence carefully poured from\r\nthe sediment.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic extracts of the pomades or solutions of the aromatics are\r\ncalled essences or extracts (French, extraits); the solutions obtained\r\nfrom resins and balsams are usually termed tinctures.\r\n\r\nWhile some extracts, owing to their strong odor, can be used only when\r\ndiluted with alcohol, others are employed in perfumes as such. Pure\r\nextracts (extraits purs) are those containing only a single odor and\r\nare but rarely used as perfumes; the latter are usually mixtures of\r\nseveral, often a great many odors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING THE MOST IMPORTANT ESSENCES AND EXTRACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.—There is considerable confusion, in works on perfumery, regarding\r\nthe terms _essence_ and _extract_. In French works, _essence_ always\r\nmeans “essential oil.” Thus “essence de rose” is “essential oil of\r\nroses,” or “attar (otto) of roses.” _Extrait_ (French) is used of\r\nalcoholic solutions of oils, as well as alcoholic extracts of pomades,\r\nor of substances not wholly soluble in alcohol, and also of compound\r\nliquids. In English, _essence_ is used, and should be confined to\r\nalcoholic solutions of essential oils (“essence of lemon,” “essence\r\nof peppermint”). It is, then, equivalent to the term “spirit,”\r\nwhich is also used only of alcoholic solutions of essential oils or\r\nother volatile substance (such as: spirit of peppermint, essence\r\nof peppermint; spirit of camphor, etc.). Liquid alcoholic extracts\r\nof substances not wholly soluble in alcohol are properly called\r\n_tinctures_ (for instance, tincture of benzoin, tincture of musk); and\r\nliquid alcoholic extracts of pomades, or compound odorous liquids, are\r\nbest comprised under the general term _extracts_.\r\n\r\nWe shall employ the terms _essence_, _extract_, and _tincture_ in the\r\nsense here explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF CASSIE (EXTRAIT DE CASSIE).\r\n\r\n  Cassie pomade      6 lbs.\r\n  Alcohol            5 qts.\r\n\r\nExtract of cassie has a fine green color—a fact which is not desirable\r\nin perfumes intended for the handkerchief because colored preparations\r\nleave stains. However, extract of cassie is rarely used pure, but is\r\ngenerally mixed with other odors for handkerchief perfumes, whereby the\r\ncolor is so much diluted that it may be disregarded. This extract—and\r\nthe same remark applies to all the others—immediately after its\r\npreparation must be put into tightly closed vessels and preserved in\r\nthe coolest attainable dark place; for light, air, and heat must be\r\ncalled the destroyers of perfumes, since the most delightful odors\r\neventually disappear under their influence.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of manufacturers who import this extract from Southern\r\nFrance, the main source of supply, we may add that the word cassie or\r\nextrait de cassie, derived from the flowers of Acacia farnesiana, might\r\nreadily give rise to confusion with extrait de cassia, made from the\r\nbark of the cinnamon cassia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF AMBERGRIS (EXTRAIT D’AMBREGRIS).\r\n\r\n  Ambergris      5 oz.\r\n  Alcohol        5 qts.\r\n\r\nThe ambergris should be broken into small pieces with a chopping knife\r\nrepeatedly moistened with alcohol, and allowed to digest in the alcohol\r\nfor some weeks at a temperature of about 30° C. (86° F.).\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF BENZOIN (EXTRAIT DE BENJOIN).\r\n\r\n  Benzoin       10 oz.\r\n  Alcohol        5 qts.\r\n\r\nThis tincture is not so much used for handkerchief perfumes as for\r\npreserving many pomades, as it possesses the valuable property of\r\npreventing fats from becoming rancid.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF BERGAMOT (EXTRAIT DE BERGAMOTTE).\r\n\r\n  Oil of bergamot     8 oz.\r\n  Alcohol             5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF CASTOR (EXTRAIT DE CASTOREUM).\r\n\r\n  Castor        2½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol       5  qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF MUSK SEED (EXTRAIT D’AMBRETTE).\r\n\r\n  Musk seed, powdered       1 lb.\r\n  Alcohol                   5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF BITTER ALMOND (EXTRAIT D’AMANDE).\r\n\r\n  Oil of bitter almond       1¾ oz.\r\n  Alcohol                    5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF CALAMUS (EXTRAIT DE GLAÏEUL).\r\n\r\n  Oil of calamus       1¾ oz.\r\n  Alcohol              5 qts.\r\n\r\nThis essence has a pleasant odor, but it is not valued as a true\r\nperfume; though if it is mixed with other essences or extracts until\r\nits characteristic odor is no longer recognizable it furnishes a very\r\nuseful basis for many cheap articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF CEDAR (EXTRAIT DE CÈDRE).\r\n\r\n  Oil of cedar wood        ½ lb.\r\n  Alcohol                 5 qts.\r\n\r\nThis essence made from the oil is colorless and can be used immediately\r\nfor handkerchief perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF CEDAR (EXTRAIT DE BOIS DE CÈDRE).\r\n\r\nThis is made by digesting finely rasped cedar wood with strong alcohol,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n  Cedar wood chips       6 lb.\r\n  Alcohol                5 qts.\r\n\r\nThe result is a fragrant tincture with a beautiful deep red color which\r\ncannot be employed for handkerchief perfumes, but for many cosmetic\r\npreparations such as mouth washes and for scenting soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF CITRONELLA.\r\n\r\n  Extrait de citronella       3 to 3½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol                     5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF LEMON GRASS (EXTRAIT DE SCHOENANTHE).\r\n\r\n  Oil of lemon grass       2 to 3 oz.\r\n  Alcohol                  5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF LILAC (EXTRAIT DE LILAS).\r\n\r\nThe genuine is seldom made; the preparation sold under this name\r\nconsists of:\r\n\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                        15 grains.\r\n  Extract of orange flowers, from pomade       2 qts.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade             3 qts.\r\n  Tincture of civet                             ¼ pint.\r\n\r\nOf late, extract of lilac is often prepared by means of lilacin or\r\nterpineol, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Lilacin       1 oz.\r\n  Alcohol       1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF HONEYSUCKLE (EXTRAIT DE CHÈVRE-FEUILLE).\r\n\r\nThe author has made this extract by treating the pomade prepared from\r\nthe flowers of Lonicera Caprifolium, in the following proportion:\r\n\r\n  Honeysuckle pomade       6 lb.\r\n  Alcohol                  5 qts.\r\n\r\nThe commercial extract of this name is always a compound which may be\r\nprepared according to the following formula:\r\n\r\n  Extract of rose, made from the pomade    1 qt.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade         1 qt.\r\n  Extract of violet, from pomade           1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla                       ½ pint.\r\n  Tincture of Tolu                          ½ pint.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                    15 grains.\r\n  Oil of neroli                            8 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF GERANIUM.\r\n\r\n  Oil of geranium (rose-geranium)       5½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol                               5 qts.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial article the essence of lemon grass is often\r\nsubstituted for the essence of geranium, the odor being similar, though\r\nless delicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF CUCUMBER (EXTRAIT DE CONCOMBRES).\r\n\r\n  Cucumbers       8 lbs.\r\n  Alcohol         5 qts.\r\n\r\nThe cucumbers are peeled, cut into thin slices, and macerated in the\r\nwarm alcohol. If the odor is not strong enough in the alcohol after\r\nsome days, it is poured over some more fresh slices, the macerated\r\nresidue is expressed, and at the end of the operation all the liquids\r\nare united and filtered.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF HELIOTROPE (EXTRAIT DE HÉLIOTROPE).\r\n\r\n  Heliotrope pomade      6 lb.\r\n  Alcohol                5 qts.\r\n\r\nThis has thus far been manufactured only by French perfumers at very\r\nhigh prices; the great majority of the so-called extracts of heliotrope\r\nare compounded from:\r\n\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade                 2 qts.\r\n  Extract of orange flowers, from pomade      14 oz.\r\n  Tincture of ambergris                        7 oz.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla                          4 qts.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                        75 grains.\r\n\r\nThis is used as a perfume as such.\r\n\r\nMore recently, piperonal, under the name heliotropin, is used for\r\nmaking this extract—\r\n\r\n  Heliotropin      ¼ oz.\r\n  Alcohol          1 Pint.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to blend this with various other aromatics in order to\r\ncover the pronounced odor. A little cumarin is usually of great help.\r\nBut is it impossible, as yet, to give reliable proportions which would\r\nsuit all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF JASMINE (EXTRAIT DE JASMIN).\r\n\r\n  Jasmine pomade      6 lb.\r\n  Alcohol             5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF LAVENDER (EXTRAIT DE LAVANDE).\r\n\r\n  Oil of lavender      7 oz.\r\n  Alcohol              5 qts.\r\n\r\nA far superior essence may be prepared by the distillation of:\r\n\r\n  Oil of lavender      7 oz.\r\n  Rose water           2 qts.\r\n  Alcohol             10 qts.\r\n\r\nThe distillation is continued until one-half of the entire liquid has\r\npassed over; the residue in the still furnishes an essence of lavender\r\nof the second quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF WALLFLOWER (EXTRAIT DE GIROFLÉ).\r\n\r\nThe genuine odor can be made only from the pomade; the commercial\r\nextract consists of:\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie, from pomade              1 pint.\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade       1 qt.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade                1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla.                        1 pint.\r\n  Tincture of orris root                      1 pint.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                        1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF LILY (EXTRAIT DE LYS).\r\n\r\nAs to this delightful odor the remark made under the preceding head\r\napplies likewise; artificial extract of lily consists of:\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie, from pomade              3 pints.\r\n  Extract of jasmine, from pomade            13½ fl. oz.\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade      27 fl. oz.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade                3 pints.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade            3 qts.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla                        40½ fl. oz.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                       30 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF LEMON (EXTRAIT DE LIMON).\r\n\r\n  Oil of lemon      7 oz.\r\n  Alcohol           5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF MAGNOLIA (EXTRAIT DE MAGNOLIA).\r\n\r\nThis favorite perfume is a mixture of:\r\n\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade       2 qts.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade                4 qts.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade            1 qt.\r\n  Extract of violet, from pomade              1 qt.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                       40 grains.\r\n  Oil of lemon                               16 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF PEPPERMINT (EXTRAIT DE MENTHE).\r\n\r\n  Oil of peppermint      6½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol                5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF MUSK (EXTRAIT DE MUSC).\r\n\r\n  Musk         2½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol      5 qts.\r\n\r\nThis tincture is of special importance, not so much because of its odor\r\nas on account of its useful property of fixing other very volatile\r\nodors.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF MYRTLE (EXTRAIT DE MYRTE).\r\n\r\nOwing to the small yield of essential oil furnished on distillation\r\nby the myrtle and the comparatively high price of the oil of myrtle,\r\nnearly all the extract of myrtle is prepared artificially, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Extract of jasmine, from pomade          ½ pint.\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade      1 qt.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade               2 qts.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade           1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla                        1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF NARCISSUS.\r\n\r\nIn perfumery, two extracts of narcissus are distinguished—true extract\r\nof narcissus, from the flowers of the garden plant, Narcissus poeticus,\r\nand the so-called extract of jonquille, from Narcissus Jonquilla,\r\nwhich is cultivated in Southern France and whose odor is obtained by\r\nmaceration. Genuine extract of narcissus is even more rarely obtainable\r\nthan extract of jonquille; the odors of both are imitated, mainly\r\naccording to the following prescriptions:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. EXTRACT OF NARCISSUS (EXTRAIT DE NARCISSE).\r\n\r\n  Extract of jonquille, from pomade      2 qts.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade       3 qts.\r\n  Tincture of storax                      ½ pint.\r\n  Tincture of tolu                        ½ pint.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. EXTRACT OF JONQUILLE (EXTRAIT DE JONQUILLE).\r\n\r\n  Extract of jasmine, from pomade            2 qts.\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade      1 qt.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade           2 qts.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla                         ½ pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF CLOVE (EXTRAIT DE CLOUS DE GIROFLES).\r\n\r\n  Oil of clove      4½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol           5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF PINK (EXTRAIT D’ŒILLET).\r\n\r\nThis pleasant odor occurs in commerce only as an imitation.\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie, from pomade                  2½ pints.\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade           2½ pints.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade                    5 pints.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla                            20 fl. oz.\r\n  Oil of clove, a sufficient quantity, about     75 grains.\r\n\r\nThe oil of clove which determines the characteristic odor of this\r\nextract is dissolved in a little alcohol; of this solution enough is\r\ngradually added to the mixture until the odor has become sufficiently\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF ORANGE FLOWER OR NEROLI (EXTRAIT DE FLEURS D’ORANGES,\r\nEXTRAIT DE NÉROLI).\r\n\r\n  Orange-flower pomade      6 lb.\r\n  Alcohol                   5 qts.\r\n\r\n  Or,\r\n\r\n  Oil neroli pétale         2½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol                   5 qts.\r\n\r\nThe latter preparation is also called “essence of neroli.”\r\n\r\nThe extract prepared from the pomade furnishes this highly esteemed\r\nodor of a delicacy never to be approached by that made with oil. The\r\nalcoholic extract of the pomade perfumed with the flowers of Syringa\r\n(Philadelphus coronarius) also occurs in commerce as extract of orange\r\nflowers or neroli.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF PATCHOULY (EXTRAIT DE PATCHOULI).\r\n\r\n  Oil of patchouly      1¼ oz.\r\n  Alcohol               5 qts.\r\n\r\nThis pure essence of patchouly has not a very pleasant odor; that made\r\naccording to the following formula is far superior.\r\n\r\n  Oil of patchouly      1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose            ⅜ oz.\r\n  Alcohol               5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF BALSAM OF PERU (EXTRAIT DE PÉROU).\r\n\r\n  Peru balsam      10½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol           5 qts.\r\n\r\nThis tincture, though of a very pleasant odor, can be used only for\r\nscenting soap or sachets, as it has a very dark brown color; by\r\ndistilling alcohol over Peru balsam a colorless extract is obtained,\r\nthough of a fainter odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF ALLSPICE (EXTRAIT DE PIMENT).\r\n\r\n  Oil of allspice     3½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol             5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF SWEET PEA (EXTRAIT DE POIS DE SENTEUR).\r\n\r\nThis extract, made almost exclusively in Southern France by maceration\r\nof the pomade, is but rarely met with in commerce; what passes under\r\nthis name is made as follows:\r\n\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade      2½ pints.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade               2½ pints.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade           2½ pints.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla                        5¾ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF RESEDA (EXTRAIT DE MIGNONETTE).\r\n\r\n  Reseda pomade         5 to 6 lb.\r\n  Alcohol               5 qts.\r\n  Tincture of tolu      5½ oz.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the tincture of tolu is necessary here, owing to the\r\nextraordinary volatility of the delightful odor of mignonette, which is\r\nlessened by the addition of tincture of tolu.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OR EXTRACT OF ROSE (EXTRAITS DE ROSE).\r\n\r\nIn commerce several sorts of essence or extract of rose are\r\ndistinguished; only the cheaper grades are made by direct solution of\r\nthe oil of rose in alcohol, the better grades are prepared only from\r\npomades. As the rose is the noblest of flowers, so are these odors the\r\nmost magnificent thus far produced by the art of perfumery, since they\r\nare approached in delicacy and fragrance only by the genuine extracts\r\nof orange flower and violet. The so-called rose waters (eaux de rose)\r\nare best obtained by distillation of fresh or salted rose leaves with\r\nwater. The preceding formulæ will show that both extract of rose and\r\nrose water form important constituents of many compound essences, hence\r\nthese materials require special attention. In the following pages\r\nwe enumerate only those formulæ which are acknowledged as the best\r\nand furnish the finest product. As rose water likewise belongs among\r\nthe rose odors we give directions for its preparation, and observe\r\nin passing that the precautions required in the manufacture of this\r\none apply also to all aromatic waters (eaux aromatisées). The first\r\nessential to the production of a fine aromatic water is the employment\r\nof the freshest possible flowers; when kept in stock, chemical changes\r\noccur in the leaves which affect also the aromatic constituents and\r\nlead to a deterioration of the fragrance. Hence we urgently recommend\r\nto distil the freshly gathered flowers as soon as possible, even if the\r\nquantity on hand be small. Should this not be feasible, it is advisable\r\nto press the flowers immediately after gathering in stone-ware pots and\r\nto pour over them a saturated solution of table salt. A concentrated\r\nsaline solution prevents decomposition by the abstraction of water; and\r\nthus larger quantities of flowers may be gathered and distilled with\r\nthe salt solution. The majority of aromatic waters are prepared in this\r\nway, for instance, rose, jasmine, lilac, and others. They enter less\r\ninto handkerchief perfumes than into various mouth and other washes,\r\nand cosmetics in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE WATER (EAU DE ROSE TRIPLE).\r\n\r\n  Rose leaves       4 lb.\r\n  Water            20 pints.\r\n\r\nMix them, and by means of steam, distil 10 pints.\r\n\r\nThe rose leaves are, of course, preferably to be used while fresh.\r\nIf they are to be preserved for future use, they should be packed in\r\nstone-ware jars, and covered with a solution of common salt.

It is prepared according to the following formula:\r\n\r\n  Extract of jasmine, from pomade       1 pint.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade          1 qt.\r\n  Extract of tuberose, from pomade      2 qts.\r\n  Extract of violet, from pomade        2 qts.\r\n  Tincture of musk.                      ½ pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENCE OF VETIVER (EXTRAIT DE VÉTIVER).\r\n\r\n  Oil of vetiver      2½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol             5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF OLIBANUM (EXTRAIT D’OLIBAN, EXTRAIT D’ENCENS).\r\n\r\n  Olibanum      1 lb.\r\n  Alcohol       5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF WINTERGREEN (EXTRAIT DE GAULTHÉRIE).\r\n\r\nThis essence is more commonly sold under the English than the French\r\nname. Its composition is the following:\r\n\r\n  Tincture of ambergris                      1 pint.\r\n  Extract of cassie                          1 qt.\r\n  Essence of lavender                        1 pint.\r\n  Extract of orange flower, from pomade      1 qt.\r\n  Extract of rose, from pomade               2 qts.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla.                       1 pint.\r\n  Essence of vetiver                         1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF CIVET (EXTRAIT DE CIVETTE).\r\n\r\n  Civet.          1—1½ oz.\r\n  Orris root      1—1½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol         5 qts.\r\n\r\nTincture of civet is exceedingly lasting and is generally employed for\r\nfixing other odors. As to the quantity required to fix perfumes in\r\ngeneral, we may state that it varies with the nature of the odor. As a\r\nrule, about one-sixteenth part of tincture of civet suffices for even\r\nthe most volatile perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF CINNAMON (EXTRAIT DE CANELLE).\r\n\r\n  Cinnamon      1 lb.\r\n  Alcohol       5 qts.\r\n\r\nOwing to the yellow color left upon handkerchiefs by perfumes prepared\r\nwith this extract, it can be used only for common goods, but it is more\r\nfrequently employed for scenting soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the purposes for which they are intended, the various\r\narticles of perfumery may be divided into several groups. They are:\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUE PERFUMES.\r\n\r\nA. _Liquid._—Alcoholic handkerchief perfumes. Among these are the\r\nso-called extracts, bouquets, and waters. Ammoniacal and acid perfumes:\r\naromatic vinegars and volatile ammoniacal salts.\r\n\r\nB. _Dry._—Sachet powders, fumigating pastils and powders.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE CARE OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nEmulsions, crêmes, perfumed soaps, toilet waters, nail powders.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE CARE OF THE HAIR.\r\n\r\nHair oils, pomades, hair washes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE CARE OF THE MOUTH.\r\n\r\nTooth powders, mouth washes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSMETICS.\r\n\r\nPaints, powders, hair dyes, depilatories, etc.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the description of these different articles some\r\nremarks will be made about the colors employed in perfumery and about\r\nthe utensils used with the cosmetics, such as combs, brushes, sponges,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF HANDKERCHIEF PERFUMES, BOUQUETS, OR AROMATIC WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of handkerchief perfumes is very simple: the extracts\r\nprepared as directed in Chapter XI. are mixed in definite proportions\r\nand the perfume is finished. If the extracts are well seasoned, the\r\nperfumes blend in perfect harmony within a few days, and this time may\r\nbe even shortened by the use of the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 32.\r\nIf the extracts have been but recently prepared, a longer time will be\r\nrequired before the odor of the alcohol and the several constituents is\r\nimperceptible and all odors have blended into a harmonious whole.\r\n\r\nIf the manufacturer can afford to allow the finished extracts and\r\nperfumes to season for some length of time—of course, in well-closed\r\nand completely filled vessels—in a cool place, they will improve\r\nmarkedly in quality. Perfumes which contain but a single odor or in\r\nwhich a certain odor distinctly predominates are usually called by\r\nthe name of the respective plant, etc., under a French title, _e.g._,\r\nextrait de violette, extrait de reséda, etc. Combinations of many odors\r\nwhich produce an agreeable impression as a whole, while no one odor\r\npredominates, are called bouquets or waters; for instance, Bouquet de\r\nJockey Club, Eau de Mille Fleurs, Cologne Water, Hungarian Water, etc.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of the extracts is effected in strong glass bottles of a\r\ncapacity exactly adapted to the perfume, so as to be completely filled.\r\nFor perfumes which require seasoning to make the odors blend we use\r\nsmall glass balls of which enough are introduced into the bottle to\r\nmake the mixture rise into the neck of the container which is then\r\nclosed air-tight and preserved in a dark, cool place.\r\n\r\nOf course, all perfumes should be perfectly clear and free from\r\nturbidity. The extracts made from pomades or essential oils are clear\r\nand furnish perfumes that remain so; extracts prepared from balsams or\r\nresins should be allowed to stand at rest for several weeks and then be\r\ncarefully decanted from the sediment. Filtration should be dispensed\r\nwith unless absolutely unavoidable, on account of the large amount of\r\noxygen with which the extract would thereby come in contact, to the\r\ndetriment of the odor.\r\n\r\nThe bottles in which the perfumes are mixed, as well as those in which\r\nthey are put up for sale, must be perfectly dry, as a very small amount\r\nof water often suffices to separate a portion of the aromatics and to\r\nrender the liquid turbid or opalescent.\r\n\r\nFine perfumes are always sold in glass vessels with ground-glass\r\nstoppers; cork has a peculiar odor which it would communicate to the\r\nliquid. For the more perfect exclusion of the air the stoppers and\r\nbottle necks are moreover covered with animal membrane, sheet rubber,\r\nor vegetable parchment, with an outer cap of white glove leather.\r\n\r\nIn the case of very expensive perfumes, much care is bestowed on the\r\ncontainer; certain perfumes are filled into bottles of peculiar form\r\nand color, or into small porcelain jars provided with corresponding\r\nlabels printed in gold and colors. Sometimes the container costs many\r\ntimes the price of the perfume. But as the finest perfumes are articles\r\nof luxury in the truest sense of the word, they require extreme care\r\nin their putting up; and good taste in the selection of the containers\r\nfor fluids, pomades, cosmetics, powders, etc., is of as much importance\r\nto the perfumer as the possession of a sensitive and trained olfactory\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nIn the following formulas for the preparation of bouquets, the words\r\nextract, essence, and tincture have the same meaning as was explained\r\nunder Chapter XI. For cheap perfumes the corresponding essential oils\r\ndissolved in alcohol, that is, the corresponding “essence,” is employed\r\nin place of the true “extract.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER

Hence all\r\nsimilar perfumes must contain tincture of tonka. Other aromatic\r\nsubstances, however, contribute to the odor of hay, but the cumarin\r\ngives, as it were, the keynote to its real odor.\r\n\r\nA very pleasant perfume is made after the following formula:\r\n\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)  1 qt.\r\n  Essence of geranium       1 qt.\r\n  Extract of jasmine        1 qt.\r\n  Extract of orange flower  1 qt.\r\n  Extract of rose           1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of tonka         2 qts.\r\n\r\nSome add to this perfume 1 pint of extract of cassie which imparts a\r\ngreenish color to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL HORSE-GUARD’S BOUQUET.\r\n\r\n  Extract of orange flower   20 fl. oz.\r\n  Tincture of musk           10 fl. oz.\r\n  Extract of rose             5 pints.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla        20 fl. oz.\r\n  Tincture of orris root     20 fl. oz.\r\n  Oil of clove              120 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUQUET D’IRLANDE.\r\n\r\n  Extract of white rose  5 qts.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla    1 lb.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly fine perfume.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOVENIA.\r\n\r\nThis plant, Hovenia dulcis, indigenous to Japan, has a peculiar odor,\r\nwhich, however, is not pleasant to European taste.

Jockey Club perfume is among the\r\nfinest known to the trade; the delicacy of its odor rests largely\r\non the extracts of cassie and tuberose which are employed in their\r\nstrongest form—an alcoholic extract of a pomade well charged with the\r\nodors of the plants. As in the case of Cologne water, there are a\r\nnumber of widely diverging formulas for its preparation, from which we\r\nselect a few which furnish excellent perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOCKEY CLUB, A (ENGLISH FORMULA).\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie         1 pint.\r\n  Tincture of ambergris      ¾ pint.\r\n  Extract of rose           1½ pints.\r\n  Extract of tuberose        ¾ pint.\r\n  Tincture of orris root    3 pints.\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)  1½ pints.\r\n  Oil of bergamot            ¾ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOCKEY CLUB, B (FRENCH FORMULA).\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie    1½ pints.\r\n  Extract of jasmine   2¼ pints.\r\n  Extract of rose      3 pints.\r\n  Extract of tuberose  3 pints.\r\n  Tincture of civet      ½ pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOCKEY CLUB, C (GERMAN FORMULA).\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie       1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of ambergris  13½ fl. oz.\r\n  Extract of jasmine      1 qt.\r\n  Extract of rose         1 pint.\r\n  Extract of tuberose     1 qt.\r\n  Extract of violet       1 pint.\r\n  Tincture of civet      20 fl. oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot          ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of citronella        ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli            ½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONQUILLE (EXTRAIT DE JONQUILLE).\r\n\r\n  Extract of jasmine        2 qts.\r\n  Extract of orange flower  1 qt.\r\n  Extract of tuberose       2 qts.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla        ½ pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nKISS ME QUICK.\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie                  1 qt.\r\n  Extract of ambergris                ½ pint.\r\n  Extract of narcissus (Jonquille)   2 qts.\r\n  Tincture of tonka                  1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of orris root             2 qts.\r\n  Tincture of civet                   ½ pint.\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)           1 qt.\r\n  Oil of citronella                 75 grains.\r\n  Oil of lemon grass                45 grains.\r\n\r\nThis perfume, which was once very popular, owes its peculiar refreshing\r\nodor to the tincture of tonka beans; by increasing this ingredient the\r\nspecific odor can be made more pronounced.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUQUET COSMOPOLITE.\r\n\r\n  Extract of jasmine         1 pint.\r\n  Essence of lavender         ½ pint.\r\n  Tincture of musk            ½ pint.\r\n  Essence of patachouly       ½ pint.\r\n  Extract of santal           ½ pint.\r\n  Extract of tuberose        1 pint.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla         ½ pint.\r\n  Extract of violet          1 qt.\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)   1 pint.\r\n  Oil of citronella         75 grains.\r\n  Oil of lemon                ½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOGNE WATER (EAU DE COLOGNE).\r\n\r\nThis famous perfume, which was first made in Cologne on the Rhine,\r\nits formula being kept secret, can be produced anywhere of the same\r\nquality as the original. In order to obtain a first-class product, it\r\nis necessary, besides using the finest oils—a matter of course for all\r\nfine perfumes—to observe another special point. Every Cologne water\r\ncontains oils of the citron group which develop their best odors only\r\nin true spirit of _wine_. Unless an alcohol distilled from _wine_\r\nis used, it will be impossible to make a Cologne water of really\r\nfirst quality. While it is possible to make a good cologne with grain\r\nor potato spirit, especially if highly rectified, comparison with\r\none prepared from pure spirit of _wine_ will at once show a marked\r\ndifference. The small amount of œnanthic ether, hardly demonstrable by\r\nchemical tests but present in every spirit of wine, exerts a decided\r\ninfluence on the flavor.\r\n\r\nCologne water of the most superior and incomparable quality is made\r\nby dissolving the essential oils, excepting the oils of rosemary and\r\nneroli, in the alcohol and distilling it, the other oils being added to\r\nthe distillate.\r\n\r\nA very large number of formulas for the preparation of Cologne water\r\nhave been published of which we subjoin a few. We have purposely\r\nomitted those containing many essential oils, as experience has taught\r\nus that they are of little value; for it is not the number of oils that\r\ndetermines the fineness of a perfume, but the manner in which certain\r\nodors are combined.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

It is\r\nadvisable to dissolve the aromatics in very strong alcohol and then to\r\neffect the dilution required with orange-flower or rose water. This\r\ndilution is also to be employed when a cheaper product is desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVENDER PERFUMES.\r\n\r\nEnglish (Mitcham) oil of lavender should always be used when it is\r\ndesired to produce perfumes of first quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE LAVANDE AMBRÉE.\r\n\r\n  Oil of bergamot   1 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon       ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of geranium  75 grains.\r\n  Oil of lavender   5½ oz.\r\n  Musk              8 grains.\r\n  Peru balsam       2 oz.\r\n  Storax            4¼ oz.\r\n  Civet            15 grains.\r\n  Alcohol          10 qts.\r\n\r\nThe essential oils are dissolved in the alcohol, the other substances\r\nare macerated in the solution for one month, and the liquid decanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE LAVANDE DOUBLE.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of musk      3 fl. oz.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla   3 fl. oz.\r\n  Tincture of civet     3 fl. oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot       1¼ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon           ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lavender       3½ oz.\r\n  Rose water (triple)   1 qt.\r\n  Alcohol              10 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE LAVANDE A MILLE FLEURS.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of ambergris                       ½ pint.\r\n  Essence of lavender                        2 qts.\r\n  Eau de mille fleurs (see below, page 186)  2 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAP-YEAR BOUQUET.\r\n\r\n  Extract of jasmine        3 pints.\r\n  Essence of patchouly      1½ pints.\r\n  Essence of santal         1½ pints.\r\n  Extract of tuberose       1 qt.\r\n  Extract of verbena        6½ fl. oz.\r\n  Essence of vetiver        1½ pints.\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)  1½ pints.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE LEIPSIC.\r\n\r\n  Oil of lemon            ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli           ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of orange peel   150 grains.\r\n  Oil of bergamot        2¼ oz.\r\n  Oil of rosemary       75 grains.\r\n  Orange-flower water    1 qt.\r\n  Alcohol                9 pints.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLFLOWER (EXTRAIT DE GIROFLÉ).\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie         1 pint.\r\n  Extract of orange flower  1 qt.\r\n  Extract of rose           1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla       1 pint.\r\n  Tincture of orris root    1 pint.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond      8 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY (EXTRAIT DE LYS).\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie          3 pints.\r\n  Extract of jasmine        13½ fl. oz.\r\n  Extract of orange flower  27 fl. oz.\r\n  Extract of rose            1 pint.\r\n  Extract of tuberose        3 qts.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla       40 fl. oz.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond      30 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE LISBONNE.\r\n\r\n  Oil of lemon        2¼ oz.\r\n  Oil of orange peel  4½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose          ¼ oz.\r\n  Alcohol             5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNOLIA (EXTRAIT DE MAGNOLIA).\r\n\r\n  Extract of orange flower   2 qts.\r\n  Extract of rose            4 qts.\r\n  Extract of tuberose        1 qt.\r\n  Extract of violet          1 qt.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond      40 grains.\r\n  Oil of lemon              15 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY OF THE VALLEY.\r\n\r\n  Oil of bitter almond  150 grains.\r\n  Extract of jasmine      7 oz.\r\n  Extract of neroli       7 oz.\r\n  Extract of cassie      14 oz.\r\n  Extract of tuberose    28 oz.\r\n  Alcohol                28 oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY OF THE VALLEY EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n  Extract of jasmine                           3½ oz.\r\n  Extract of ylang-ylang (see below, p. 198)    ½ oz.\r\n  Cardamom seed, crushed                      75 grains.\r\n  Oil of orris                                10 drops.\r\n\r\nMacerate for a week, and filter.\r\n\r\nThe amount of cardamom seed is to be weighed exactly; should its odor\r\nstill be too pronounced, extract of jasmine should be gradually added\r\nuntil the right aroma is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUQUET A LA MARÉCHALE.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of ambergris       ½ pint.\r\n  Tincture of musk            ½ pint.\r\n  Extract of neroli          1 pint.\r\n  Extract of orange flower   1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of tonka          1 pint.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla        1 pint.\r\n  Tincture of orris root     1 pint.\r\n  Essence of vetiver         1 pint.\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)   1 qt.\r\n  Oil of clove              75 grains.\r\n  Oil of santal             75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LA MODE.\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie          1 qt.\r\n  Extract of jasmine         1 qt.\r\n  Extract of orange flower   1 qt.\r\n  Extract of tuberose        1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of civet          1 pint.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond      75 grains.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg             60 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

For the requirements of the\r\nmiddle classes, quite fragrant perfumes are manufactured by dissolving\r\nthe cheaper essential oils in ordinary alcohol, and various new odors\r\ncan be obtained by mixing several of them. The extracts made with cheap\r\noils are well suited to this purpose. The oils most frequently used\r\nfor such articles are those of bergamot, lemon, orange peel, lavender\r\nflowers (French), lemon grass, nutmeg, clove, and santal. The alcohol\r\nmust be free from fusel oil and have a strength of at least 70% Tralles.\r\n\r\nOils with not very intense odor are generally used in the proportion of\r\nabout 2 to 2½ ounces to the quart of alcohol; half that quantity will\r\nsuffice for strong-scented oils such as those of lemon-grass, clove,\r\nand nutmeg.\r\n\r\nFrom these simple solutions an experienced manufacturer can produce\r\nvery nice perfumes by mixing them in due proportions; they are\r\ncomparatively cheap, and sometimes they yield relatively more profit\r\nthan the finest articles, whose contents and containers generally\r\nrepresent a considerable outlay on the part of the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nAMMONIACAL AND ACID PERFUMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. AMMONIACAL PERFUMES.\r\n\r\nAmmonia (ammonia water) has a disagreeable odor and exerts a very\r\ncaustic effect on the lachrymal glands. Despite these properties,\r\nammonia, in a highly dilute condition and mixed with other aromatics,\r\nfinds manifold application in perfumery and serves particularly for the\r\nmanufacture of the so-called smelling salts, or inexhaustible salts,\r\nused for filling smelling bottles.\r\n\r\nThe liquid or caustic ammonia, however, is not so suitable for the\r\npurposes of the perfumer as the carbonate of ammonia, which when pure\r\nforms colorless crystals usually covered with a white dust (consisting\r\nof bicarbonate of ammonia); these, undergoing gradual decomposition,\r\ngive off the odor of ammonia and hence are more lasting in smelling\r\nbottles than the pure liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe main essential for both of these substances is purity. Caustic\r\nammonia as well as carbonate of ammonia are now obtained on a large\r\nscale from “gas liquor,” but the crude products always retain some of\r\nthe penetrating odor of coal tar which renders them valueless for the\r\npurposes of the perfumer. We must, therefore, make it a rule to use\r\nnothing but perfectly pure materials which, moreover, are easily to be\r\nhad in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nINEXHAUSTIBLE SALT (SEL INÉPUISABLE).\r\n\r\n  Oil of bergamot   24 grains.\r\n  Oil of lavender   45 grains.\r\n  Oil of mace       24 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove      24 grains.\r\n  Oil of rosemary   45 grains.\r\n  Water of ammonia   1 qt.\r\n\r\nThe aromatics are placed in a bottle, the ammonia is added, and the\r\nbottle vigorously shaken; the solution is soon effected, and the turbid\r\nliquid can be at once filled into bottles.\r\n\r\nAccording to the material from which the containers are made, different\r\nmethods must be adopted. It is necessary to give the liquid such form\r\nas to prevent its flowing out when the vessel is inverted; this is\r\nimportant, as the bottles are often carried in dress pockets and the\r\nammonia destroys most colors. As a rule the vessels are filled with\r\nindifferent porous substances which are moistened with the perfume.\r\nIf the container is made of box wood, ivory, porcelain, or some\r\nother opaque material, it is filled with fibres of asbestos or with\r\nvery small pieces of sponge, and as much perfume is poured in as the\r\nsubstance can take up; the vessels are then inverted into a porcelain\r\nplate and allowed to drain, and are finally closed with a loose plug of\r\ncotton. If the container is transparent, it is better to use, instead\r\nof the asbestos or sponge which do not look neat, either small pieces\r\nof white pumice stone, powdered glass, small white glass beads, or\r\ncrystals of sulphate of potassium which is insoluble in the perfume.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SMELLING SALT (SEL BLANC PARFUMÉ).\r\n\r\nWhile the first-named ammoniacal preparation is called a salt, it is\r\nreally nothing but perfumed caustic ammonia; but white smelling salt is\r\nwhat its name indicates and can be perfumed as desired by the consumer;\r\nbut as only certain scents harmonize with ammonia, not every odor can\r\nbe employed; the most appropriate are oils whose odor resembles that of\r\nrose, and the oils of nutmeg and cinnamon.\r\n\r\nMix in a large porcelain jar—\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of ammonia  2 lb.\r\n  Caustic ammonia       1 lb.\r\n\r\nCover the jar and leave it at rest. After some days the mixture will\r\nhave changed into a firm mass of monocarbonate of ammonia which is\r\nrubbed to a coarse powder, perfumed, and filled into bottles. The above\r\nquantities require:\r\n\r\n  Oil of bergamot  15 grains.\r\n  Oil of lavender  15 grains.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg     8 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove      8 grains.\r\n  Oil of rose       8 grains.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon  75 grains.\r\n\r\nThe oils are poured into a mortar and rubbed up with about one-tenth of\r\nthe salt; of this perfumed salt enough is added to the several portions\r\nof the mass, and triturated until the odor is equally distributed. For\r\ncheaper smelling salts oils of geranium and cassia may be substituted\r\nfor the oils of rose and cinnamon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESTON SALT (SEL VOLATIL).\r\n\r\nIn this perfume ammonia is continually generated; the salt is prepared\r\nby mixing chloride of ammonium or sal-ammoniac in fine powder with\r\nfreshly slaked lime. Fine or cheap perfume is added, according to the\r\ngrade desired. The mixture of sal-ammoniac and slaked lime continually\r\ndevelops small amounts of ammonia—it takes a long time until the\r\ndecomposition is complete, and for this reason a bottle filled with\r\nPreston salt retains the odor of ammonia for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE LUCE.\r\n\r\nThis is the only ammoniacal perfume used in a liquid form. It is made\r\naccording to the following formula:\r\n\r\n  Tincture of ambergris   10½ oz.\r\n  Tincture of benzoin       ½ lb.\r\n  Oil of lavender        150 grains.\r\n  Water of ammonia         1½ lb.\r\n\r\nThe tinctures are mixed with the ammonia by agitation and immediately\r\nfilled into bottles; the liquid should have a milky appearance. At\r\ntimes 150 grains of white soap is added which aids in imparting to the\r\nliquid the desired milky appearance. In fine eau de Luce the odor of\r\nambergris should predominate; this can be easily effected by increasing\r\nthe amount of tincture of ambergris.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. ACID PERFUMES.\r\n\r\nAs there is a group of perfumes which is distinguished by their\r\ncharacteristic odor of ammonia and which we have therefore called\r\nammoniacal, so there is an important series of articles containing\r\nacetic acid which are used cosmetically as so-called toilet vinegars,\r\nand in some washes.\r\n\r\nOrdinary vinegar, _i.e._, water containing four to six per cent of\r\nacetic acid, has, as is well known, a not unpleasant refreshing odor\r\nand a pure acid taste. Pure acetic acid, now made in large quantities\r\nand of excellent quality, is known commercially as glacial acetic acid.\r\nIn commerce, it is customary to designate any acetic acid containing\r\n85 or more per cent of the absolute acid, as glacial acetic acid. In\r\nchemical or pharmacopœial nomenclature, however, the glacial acid is\r\nmeant to be as near 100% as possible. In perfumery, an 85% acid is\r\nsufficiently strong. It forms a colorless liquid with a narcotic odor\r\nand an intensely acid taste; it congeals into glassy crystals at a\r\ntemperature of 8.5° C. (47° F.). The latter property is of importance\r\nas showing the purity of the acid. Concentrated acetic acid, like\r\nalcohol, dissolves aromatic substances, with which it forms perfumes\r\nwhich differ from those made with alcohol mainly by their peculiar\r\nrefreshing after-odor which is due to the acetic acid.\r\n\r\nAcetic acid can be saturated with various odors and thus furnish fine\r\nperfumes; but for so-called toilet vinegars which are used as washes\r\nthe acetic acid must be properly diluted, since the concentrated acid\r\nhas pronounced caustic properties, reddens the skin, and may even\r\nproduce destructive effects on sensitive parts such as the lips.\r\n\r\n\r\nAROMATIC VINEGAR (VINAIGRE AROMATIQUE).\r\n\r\n  Glacial acetic acid    2 lb.\r\n  Camphor                4¼ oz.\r\n  Oil of lavender         ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of mace          150 grains.\r\n  Oil of rosemary      150 grains.\r\n\r\nInstead of the perfumes here given, finer odors may be employed for the\r\nproduction of superior toilet vinegars; thus we find vinaigre ambré,\r\nau musc, à la violette, au jasmin, etc., according to the perfume used.\r\nAs concentrated acetic acid dissolves most aromatic substances the\r\nsame as alcohol, all alcoholic perfumes may have their counterparts in\r\nacetic acid; but the aromatics should never be added in so large amount\r\nas to mask the characteristic odor of the acetic acid. A very pleasant\r\nvinegar may be produced by combining an alcoholic with an acid perfume,\r\nas in the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nSPICED VINEGAR (VINAIGRE AUX ÉPICES).\r\n\r\n  1. Macerate:\r\n      Leaves of geranium, lavender, peppermint,\r\n        rosemary, and sage, of each                1 oz.\r\n      In alcohol of 80%                            1 lb.\r\n\r\n  2.

The longer this mixture is allowed to\r\nseason in the bottle, the finer will be the aroma; for in the course of\r\ntime the alcohol and acetic acid react on each other and form acetic\r\nether, which likewise possesses a pleasant aromatic odor.\r\n\r\nCertain aromatic vinegars, like ammoniacal perfumes, are filled into\r\nsmelling bottles containing the same porous substances for their\r\nabsorption, namely, sponge, pumice stone, crystals of potassium\r\nsulphate, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMULAS FOR TOILET VINEGARS.\r\n\r\nVINAIGRE A LA ROSE.\r\n\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)  10½ oz.\r\n  White-wine vinegar         1 qt.\r\n\r\nThis should be colored a pale rose tint with one of the dye-stuffs\r\nto be enumerated hereafter.

The oldest civilized people known\r\nin history—Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Babylonians, and the Jews,\r\nas numerous passages in the Bible prove—used dried portions of plants,\r\nleaves, flowers, and resins as perfumes and incense.\r\n\r\nTo this day there is kept up quite a trade in Valeriana celtica, a\r\nstrong-scented Alpine plant, and in powdered amber, with the Orient,\r\nwhere they are used for scent bags and incense respectively. The\r\nCatholic Church retains to the present time the Jewish rite of\r\nburning incense, and in our museums will be found urns, taken from\r\nEgyptian graves, from which pleasant odors escape even now after\r\nnearly four thousand years, owing to the aromatic resins with which\r\nthey are filled. It is said, too, that the delightful volatile odors\r\nof our handkerchief perfumes were first prepared by an Italian named\r\nFrangipanni conceiving the idea of treating a dry mixture of different\r\naromatic plants with alcohol and thus imparting the odor they contained\r\nto the latter.\r\n\r\nNot all aromatics can be made into sachet powders; it is well known\r\nthat the delightful odor of violets changes into a positively\r\ndisagreeable smell when the flowers are dried, and the same remark\r\napplies to the blossoms of the lily of the valley, mignonette, lily,\r\nand most of our fragrant plants. On the other hand, some portions of\r\nplants, especially those in which the odorous principle is contained\r\nnot only in the flower but in all parts of the plant, as in the mints,\r\nsage, and most Labiatæ, remain fragrant for a long time after drying\r\nand hence can be employed for sachets. Besides the plants named,\r\nlavender, rose leaves, the leaves of the lemon and orange tree, Acacia\r\nfarnesiana, patchouly herb, and some other plants continue fragrant\r\nafter drying.\r\n\r\nAny vegetable substance to be used for sachets must be completely dried\r\nso as to prevent mould. The drying should be effected in a warm, shady\r\nplace, sometimes in heated chambers; direct sunlight and excessive\r\nheat injure the strength of the odor, a portion of the aromatics\r\nbecoming resinified and volatilized. If artificial heat is employed, a\r\ntemperature between 40 and 45° C. (104-113° F.) is most suitable.\r\n\r\nThe external form of this class of preparations varies of course with\r\nthe public for which it is intended. Expensive sachets are sold in silk\r\nbags with different ornamentation; those intended for the Orient are\r\ngenerally put up as small silk cushions richly ornamented with gold\r\nand colors to suit Oriental taste. Cheap sachets are sold in envelopes\r\nor in round boxes. It is customary to have the ingredients ground or\r\nfinely powdered, for which purpose small hand-mills will generally\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nFORMULAS FOR DRY PERFUMES (SACHETS).\r\n\r\n\r\nCEYLON SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Mace                23 oz.\r\n  Patchouly           28 oz.\r\n  Vetiver root        35 oz.\r\n  Oil of orange peel   1¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of peppermint    3½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYPRIAN SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Cedar wood           2 lb.\r\n  Rhodium              2 lb.\r\n  Santal wood          2 lb.\r\n  Oil of rhodium        ½ oz.\r\n\r\nThe oil is mixed with the finely powdered or rasped woods and\r\ndistributed in the mass by trituration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD FLOWER SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Calamus root   1 lb.\r\n  Caraway         ½ lb.\r\n  Lavender       1 lb.\r\n  Marjoram        ½ lb.\r\n  Musk          30 grains.\r\n  Cloves         2¾ oz.\r\n  Peppermint      ½ lb.\r\n  Rose leaves    1 lb.\r\n  Rosemary       3½ oz.\r\n  Thyme           ½ lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANGIPANNI SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Musk             1 oz.\r\n  Sage              ½ lb.\r\n  Santal wood       ½ lb.\r\n  Orris root       6 lb.\r\n  Vetiver           ½ lb.\r\n  Civet             ¼ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli   75 grains.\r\n  Oil of santal   75 grains.\r\n  Oil of rhodium  75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELIOTROPE SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Musk                    ½ oz.\r\n  Rose leaves            2 lb.\r\n  Tonka beans            1 lb.\r\n  Vanilla                 ½ lb.\r\n  Orris root             4 lb.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond  30 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Santal wood        3½ oz.\r\n  Orris root        21 oz.\r\n  Cinnamon          10½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lavender   75 grains.\r\n  Cloves            30 grains.\r\n  Oil of rose      150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVENDER SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Benzoin             1 lb.\r\n  Lavender flowers    4 lb.\r\n  Oil of lavender     1 oz.\r\n  Oil of rose        75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSHAL SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Cassia         ½ lb.\r\n  Musk         75 grains.\r\n  Cloves         ½ lb.\r\n  Rose leaves    ½ lb.\r\n  Santal wood   1 lb.\r\n  Orris root    1 lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLE FLEURS SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Benzoin       1 lb.\r\n  Lavender      1 lb.\r\n  Musk         30 grains.\r\n  Cloves        4½ oz.\r\n  Allspice      2½ oz.\r\n  Rose leaves   1 lb.\r\n  Santal wood   4¼ oz.\r\n  Tonka beans   4¼ oz.\r\n  Vanilla       4½ oz.\r\n  Orris root    1 lb.\r\n  Civet        30 grains.\r\n  Cinnamon       ½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSLIN SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Benzoin            ½ lb.\r\n  Santal wood       1 lb.\r\n  Thyme             1 lb.\r\n  Orris root        1 lb.\r\n  Vetiver root      2 lb.\r\n  Oil of geranium  75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLLA PODRIDA.\r\n\r\nThis name is applied in Spain to a dish prepared from various remnants\r\nof food. The olla podrida of the perfumer is made from the remnants of\r\nthe aromatic vegetable substances after their extraction with alcohol,\r\npetroleum ether, etc. Although vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., be\r\nrepeatedly extracted, they still retain their characteristic odor,\r\nthough somewhat fainter, and thus they can be used with advantage for\r\nsachet powders intended for filling bags, cushions, etc. If mixed in\r\ncorresponding proportions, they can be made use of for all the sachets\r\nhere enumerated.

The same process is followed with all other\r\ndry powders in which a small amount of a solid with intense odor or of\r\nan essential oil is to be mixed with a large quantity of powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSIAN SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Musk                     30 grains.\r\n  Rose leaves               1 lb.\r\n  Tonka beans               3½ oz.\r\n  Orris root                2 lb.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg            75 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove             75 grains.\r\n  Oil of rose             150 grains.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon          75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUGAL POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Lemon peels               1 lb.\r\n  Orange peels              2 lb.\r\n  Orris root                1 lb.\r\n  Cinnamon                  3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon grass      150 grains.\r\n  Oil of neroli           150 grains.\r\n  Oil of orange peel        2½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTPOURRI.\r\n\r\nMany widely differing perfumes are sold in the market under this name;\r\na good formula for its preparation is the following:\r\n\r\n  Lavender                     1 lb.\r\n  Cloves                       2½ oz.\r\n  Allspice                     2½ oz.\r\n  Rose leaves                  1 lb.\r\n  Reseda                       1¾ oz.\r\n  Orris root                   ½ lb.\r\n  Vanilla                    150 grains.\r\n  Cinnamon                     1¾ oz.\r\n  Sand, or table salt, etc.    1 lb.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of fine white sand, table salt, or powdered glass or\r\nmarble, etc., is made merely for the purpose of increasing the weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE SACHET POWDER, A.\r\n\r\n  Geranium herb                 3½ oz.\r\n  Rose leaves                   2 lb.\r\n  Santal wood                   1 lb.\r\n  Oil of rose                    ½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE SACHET POWDER, B.\r\n\r\n  Rose leaves                   2 lb.\r\n  Santal wood                   1 lb.\r\n  Oil of rose                   1 oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTAL POWDER,\r\n\r\nwhich is simply finely rasped santal wood, is also sometimes sold as\r\nrose sachet powder when it has received an addition of some oil of\r\ngeranium.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Benzoin                        ½ lb.\r\n  Musk                         30 grains.\r\n  Orange flowers                1¾ oz.\r\n  Rose leaves                   1 lb.\r\n  Orris root                    2 lb.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond         75 grains.\r\n  Oil of lemon grass           30 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Orris root, powdered           1 lb.\r\n  Musk                           8 grains.\r\n  Vanillin                      30 grains.\r\n  Oil of rose                   25 drops.\r\n  Oil of petit grain           150 grains.\r\n  Cologne water                  3½ oz.\r\n\r\nMix intimately in a porcelain mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERBENA SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Lemon peels                    1 lb.\r\n  Caraway                         ½ lb.\r\n  Orange peels                   1 lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                1¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                   1¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon grass            75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nVETIVER SACHET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Vetiver root                   2 lb.\r\n  Musk                          15 grains.\r\n  Civet                         20 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PERFUMES USED FOR FUMIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the use made of them, perfumes for fumigation may be\r\ndivided into two groups: those which develop their fragrance on being\r\nburned, and those which do so on being merely heated. The former group\r\nincludes pastils and ribbons, the latter fumigating powders and waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUMIGATING PASTILS.\r\n\r\n_French_—Pastilles fumigatoires; _German_—Räucherkerzen.\r\n\r\nPastils consist in the main of charcoal to which enough saltpetre is\r\nadded to make the lighted mass glow continuously and leave a pure\r\nwhite ash. To this mass are added various aromatic substances which are\r\ngradually volatilized by the heat and fill the surrounding air with\r\ntheir perfume. It is important to observe that only ordinary saltpetre\r\n(nitrate of potassium) is to be used for this purpose, and not the\r\nso-called Chili saltpetre (nitrate of sodium) which becomes moist in\r\nthe air. For ordinary pastils finely rasped fragrant woods such as\r\ncedar or santal are frequently employed. During the slow combustion,\r\nhowever, the wood gives off products of a pungent or disagreeable\r\nodor such as acetic acid and empyreumatic products, which lessen the\r\nfragrance. Fine pastils are composed of resins and essential oils and\r\nare usually formed into cones two-fifths to four-fifths of an inch\r\nhigh, by being pressed in metal moulds.\r\n\r\nFumigating pastils are manufactured as follows. Each solid ingredient\r\nis finely powdered by itself, and the necessary quantities are then put\r\ninto a wide porcelain dish and intimately mixed with a flat spatula.\r\nIn order to confine the dust, the dish is covered with a cloth during\r\nthis operation.

It may be stated,\r\nhowever, that the opium may be omitted entirely, as it neither\r\ncontributes to the fragrance, nor produces, by being burned in this\r\nmanner, any of the supposed exhilarating or intoxicating effects which\r\nit may produce when used in other forms or employed in other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAGUETTES ENCENSOIRES (FUMIGATING PENCILS).\r\n\r\n  Benzoin                           14 oz.\r\n  Charcoal                           1¾ oz.\r\n  Peru balsam                        1 oz.\r\n  Storax                             2 oz.\r\n  Shellac                            3½ oz.\r\n  Olibanum                           5½ oz.\r\n  Civet                             75 grains.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                    1 oz.\r\n  Oil of orange peel                 1 oz.\r\n  Oil of santal                       ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nMelt the benzoin, charcoal, shellac, and olibanum in a bright iron pan\r\nat the lowest possible heat; take the pan from the fire and add the\r\nother ingredients, heat being again applied from time to time to keep\r\nthe mass in a liquid state.

Ruban de Bruges;\r\n_German_—Räucherpapiere. Räucherbänder.\r\n\r\nFumigating papers are strips impregnated with substances which become\r\nfragrant on being heated; such a strip need merely be placed on a stove\r\nor held over a flame in order to perfume a whole room. Fumigating\r\npapers are divided into two groups: those meant to be burned, and those\r\nmeant to be used repeatedly. The former, before being treated with\r\naromatics, are dipped into saltpetre solution; the latter, in order to\r\nrender them incombustible, are first dipped into a hot alum solution so\r\nthat they are only charred by a strong heat, but not entirely consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. INFLAMMABLE FUMIGATING PAPER.\r\n\r\nPapier Fumigatoire Inflammable.\r\n\r\nThe paper is dipped into a solution of 3½ to 5½ ounces of saltpetre in\r\nwater; after drying it is immersed in a strong tincture of benzoin or\r\nolibanum and again dried. An excellent paper is made according to the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n  Benzoin               5½ oz.\r\n  Santal wood           3½ oz.\r\n  Olibanum              3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon grass  150 grains.\r\n  Essence of vetiver    1¾ oz.\r\n  Alcohol.              1 qt.\r\n\r\nFor use, the paper is touched with a red-hot substance, not a flame. It\r\nbegins to glow at once without bursting into flame, giving off numerous\r\nsparks and a pleasant odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. NON-INFLAMMABLE FUMIGATING PAPER.\r\n\r\nPapier Fumigatoire Permanent.\r\n\r\nThis paper is prepared by dipping it in a hot solution of 3½ oz. of\r\nalum in one quart of water; after drying, it is saturated with the\r\nfollowing mixture:\r\n\r\n  Benzoin              7 oz.\r\n  Tolu balsam          7 oz.\r\n  Tincture of tonka    7 oz.\r\n  Essence of vetiver   7 oz.\r\n  Alcohol             20 fl. oz.\r\n\r\nThis paper, when heated, diffuses a very pleasant odor and can be used\r\nrepeatedly. It does not burn, and strong heat only chars it. Some\r\nmanufacturers make inferior fumigating papers by dipping the alum paper\r\nsimply in melted benzoin or olibanum.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. FUMIGATING RIBBONS\r\n\r\nare nothing but fine flat lamp wicks treated first with saltpetre\r\nsolution and then with the preceding mixture. The wick is rolled up and\r\nplaced in a vessel provided with a lamp burner. It is inserted in the\r\nburner like any other wick and when lighted burns down to the metal and\r\ngoes out unless screwed up higher. Fumigating vessels provided with\r\nthese wicks are very practical because, if artistic in form, they form\r\nquite an ornament to the room and can be instantly set in operation. A\r\nFrench formula gives the following mixture for saturating the wicks:\r\n\r\n  Benzoin                  1 lb.\r\n  Musk                      ¾ oz.\r\n  Myrrh                    3½ oz.\r\n  Tolu balsam              3½ oz.\r\n  Tincture of orris root   1 pint.\r\n  Oil of rose             15 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUMIGATING WATERS AND VINEGARS (EAUX ENCENSOIRES, VINAIGRES\r\nENCENSOIRES).\r\n\r\nThese fluids are nothing but strong solutions of various aromatics in\r\nalcohol, a few drops of which suffice, if evaporated on a warm plate,\r\nto perfume a large room.

They find their most\r\nappropriate use in places where an aromatic odor is desired, while\r\nthere is no room for keeping the substances themselves. These must\r\ntherefore be put into a small compass, and the aromatics chosen should\r\nbe distinguished by great intensity and permanence of odor.\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a few formulas for the manufacture of such specialties, and\r\nadd the remark that besides the aromatics there given other substances\r\nmay be used in their preparation; but that the presence of benzoin,\r\nmusk, or civet, even in small amount, is always necessary, since these\r\nsubstances, as above stated, not only possess an intense and permanent\r\nodor, but have the valuable property of imparting lasting qualities to\r\nmore volatile odors.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan, too, to keep on hand two kinds of these\r\nspecialties—one containing musk, the other none—for the reason that\r\nthe musk odor is as disagreeable to some persons as it is pleasant to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH SKIN (PEAU D’ESPAGNE, SPANISCH LEDER).\r\n\r\nThe article sold under this name resembles in some respects sachets or\r\nscent bags and is made as follows.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of wash-leather (chamois), trim it to a square shape, and\r\nleave it for three or four days in the following mixture:\r\n\r\n  Benzoin                                          ½ lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                                     ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon grass                               ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lavender                                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg                                 150 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove                                  150 grains.\r\n  Oil of neroli                                   1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose                                     1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of santal                                   1½ oz.\r\n  Tincture of tonka                                ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon                               150 grains.\r\n  Alcohol                                         1 qt.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the time named remove the leather from the liquid, let it\r\ndrain, spread it on a glass plate, and when dry coat it on the rough\r\nside, by means of a brush, with a paste prepared in a mortar from the\r\nfollowing ingredients:\r\n\r\n  Benzoic acid, sublimed                        150 grains.\r\n  Musk                                           15 grains.\r\n  Civet                                          15 grains.\r\n  Gum acacia                                      1 oz.\r\n  Glycerin                                         ¾ oz.\r\n  Water                                           1¾ oz.\r\n\r\nThe leather is then folded in the centre, smoothed with a paper-knife,\r\nput under a weight, and allowed to dry. The dried leather forms the\r\nso-called perfume skin which retains its fine odor for years. Instead\r\nof the above alcoholic liquids any desired alcoholic perfume may be\r\nused; especially suitable are those containing oils of lemon grass,\r\nlavender, and rose, since they are not very volatile, and when combined\r\nwith musk and civet remain fragrant for a long time. A sufficiently\r\nlarge piece of perfume skin inserted in a desk pad or placed among the\r\npaper will make the latter very fragrant. Spanish skin is chiefly used\r\nfor this purpose, as well as for work, glove, and handkerchief boxes,\r\netc. It is generally inclosed in a heavy silk cover.\r\n\r\nIf leather be thought too expensive, four to six layers of\r\nblotting-paper may be perfumed in the same way and properly inclosed.\r\nThin layers of cotton wadding between paper can also be thus perfumed\r\nand used for filling pin cushions, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH PASTE.\r\n\r\nMix the following substances intimately in a porcelain mortar, and add\r\nwater drop by drop until a doughy mass results.\r\n\r\n  Ambergris             ¾ oz.\r\n  Benzoin              1½ oz.\r\n  Musk                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Vanilla               ¾ oz.\r\n  Orris root            ¾ oz.\r\n  Cinnamon              ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot      1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose           ¾ oz.\r\n  Gum acacia           1½ oz.\r\n  Glycerin             1½ oz.\r\n\r\nThis paste, divided into pieces about the size of a hazelnut, is\r\nused for filling the so-called cassolettes or scent boxes which are\r\ncarried in the pocket, etc., like smelling bottles. Owing to its pasty\r\nconsistence this preparation can be used for perfuming jewelry (small\r\nquantities are inserted within the diamond settings), fine leather\r\ngoods, belts, and other articles. It is unnecessary to lengthen the\r\nlist; every practical perfumer will know what objects need perfuming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nHYGIENIC AND COSMETIC PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerfumery is not merely called upon to act in an æsthetic direction and\r\ngladden the senses; it has another and more important aim, that is,\r\nto aid in some respects the practice of medicine. It is not necessary\r\nto point out that in this sense, too, it acts in an æsthetic way; for\r\nhealth and beauty are one and inseparable.\r\n\r\nThe field relegated to perfumery with reference to hygiene is\r\nextensive, comprising the care of the skin, the hair, and the mouth.\r\nBut we also find in commercial perfumery articles which possess no\r\nmedicinal effect and serve merely for beautifying some parts of the\r\nbody, for instance, paints and hair dyes. As it is not possible to\r\nseparate perfumes with hygienic effects from cosmetics, we shall\r\ndescribe the latter in connection with the former.\r\n\r\nTo repeat, hygienic perfumery has to deal with such substances as have\r\nreally a favorable effect on health. No one will deny that soap takes\r\nthe first place among them. Soap promotes cleanliness, and cleanliness\r\nin itself is essential to health. But it would exceed the scope of this\r\nwork were we to treat in detail of the manufacture of soap and its\r\nemployment in the toilet; we must confine ourselves to some specialties\r\nexclusively made by perfumers and into the composition of which soap\r\nenters. We do so the more readily since perfumers are but rarely in\r\na position to make soap, and in most cases find it more advantageous\r\nto buy the raw material, that is, ordinary good soap, from the\r\nmanufacturer and to perfume it.\r\n\r\nNext to soap in hygienic perfumery stand the so-called emulsions and\r\ncreams (crêmes) which are excellent preparations for the skin and\r\npertain to the domain of the perfumer.\r\n\r\nThe human skin consists of three distinct parts: the deepest layer, the\r\nsubcutaneous cellular tissue which gradually changes into true skin;\r\nthe corium or true skin (the thickest layer); and the superficial scarf\r\nskin or epidermis which is very thin and consists largely of dead and\r\ndying cells; these are continually shed and steadily reproduced from\r\nthe corium.\r\n\r\nThe skin contains various depressions, namely, the sudoriparous glands\r\nwhich excrete sweat; the sebaceous glands which serve the purpose\r\nof covering the skin with fat and thereby keep it soft, glossy, and\r\nsupple; and lastly the hair follicles which contain the hairs, an\r\nappendage to the skin.\r\n\r\nThe main object of hygienic perfumery with reference to the skin is to\r\nkeep these glandular organs in health and activity; it effects this by\r\nvarious remedies which, besides promoting the general health, improve\r\nthe appearance of the skin.\r\n\r\nAs a special group of preparations is intended exclusively for the\r\ncare of the skin, so another class is devoted to the preservation of\r\nthe hair, and still another to the care of the mouth and its greatest\r\nornament, the teeth. Accordingly the preparations belonging under this\r\nhead will be divided into three groups—those for the skin, the hair,\r\nand the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE CARE OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCERIN.\r\n\r\nPure glycerin is a substance that has a powerful beautifying effect on\r\nthe skin, by rendering it white, supple, soft, and glossy; no other\r\nremedy will clear a sun-burnt skin in so short a time as glycerin.\r\nAn excellent wash may be made by the perfumer by mixing equal parts\r\nof thick, colorless glycerin and orange-flower water (or some other\r\naromatic water with fine odor), possibly giving it a rose color by the\r\naddition of a very small amount of fuchsine. Concentrated glycerin must\r\nnot be used as a wash, because it abstracts water from the skin and\r\nthereby produces a sensation of heat or burning.\r\n\r\nBesides common soap, the so-called emulsions, meals, pastes, vegetable\r\nmilks and creams are the best preparations for the care of the skin;\r\nin perfumery they are even preferable to soap in some respects because\r\nthey contain not only substances which have a cleansing effect like any\r\nsoap, scented or not, but at the same time render the skin clearer,\r\nmore transparent, and more supple.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMULSIONS.\r\n\r\nMany perfumers make a definite distinction between two groups\r\nof emulsions which they call respectively “emulsions” and “true\r\nemulsions.” By “emulsions” they mean masses which have the property\r\nof changing on contact with water into a milky fluid or becoming\r\nemulsified; the term “true emulsions” is applied to such preparations\r\nas already contain a sufficient amount of water and therefore have a\r\nmilky appearance. Hence the difference between the two preparations\r\nlies in the lesser or greater quantity of water, and is so variable\r\nthat we prefer to describe them under one head.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the milky appearance of the emulsions on coming in contact\r\nwith water is that they contain, besides fat, substances which possess\r\nthe property of keeping the fat suspended in form of exceedingly minute\r\ndroplets which make the entire fluid look like milk. As a glance\r\nthrough the microscope shows, the milk of animals consists of a clear\r\nfluid in which the divided fat droplets (butter) float; these by their\r\nrefractive power make the milk appear white.\r\n\r\nWhile soaps always contain a certain quantity of free alkali, a\r\nsubstance having active caustic properties, emulsions include very\r\nlittle if any alkali, and, since they possess the same cleansing power\r\nas soap without its disadvantages with reference to the skin, their\r\nsteady use produces a warm youthful complexion, as well as smoothness\r\nand delicacy of the skin.\r\n\r\nGlycerin is of special importance in the composition of emulsions.\r\nBesides the above-mentioned property of this substance of keeping\r\nthe skin soft and supple, it acts as a true cosmetic by its solvent\r\npower of coloring matters: a skin deeply browned by exposure to the\r\nsun is most rapidly whitened by the use of glycerin alone. Moreover,\r\nglycerin prevents the decomposition of the preparations and keeps them\r\nunchanged for a long time. This quality has a value which should not be\r\nunderestimated; for all emulsions are very apt to decompose and become\r\nrancid owing to the finely divided fat they contain. Under ordinary\r\nconditions, only complete protection against light and air can retard\r\nrancidity, which is accompanied by a disagreeable odor not to be masked\r\nby any perfume; an addition of glycerin, which we incorporate in all\r\nemulsions, makes them more permanent owing to the antiseptic property\r\nof this substance.\r\n\r\nRecent years, however, have made us acquainted with a substance which\r\nin very minute quantities—one-half of one per cent of the mass to be\r\npreserved by it—prevents decomposition and rancidity of fats. This is\r\nsalicylic acid, a chemical product which, being harmless, tasteless,\r\nand odorless, should be employed wherever we wish to guard against\r\ndestructive influences exerted by air, fermentation, etc. While\r\nformerly all emulsions were made only in small amounts, just sufficient\r\nfor several weeks’ use, salicylic acid enables us to manufacture\r\nlarger quantities at once and to keep them without much fear of their\r\nspoiling. However, even the presence of salicylic acid is no guaranty\r\nagainst deterioration, if other precautions are neglected. The products\r\nshould be kept in well-stoppered bottles or vessels, in a cool and\r\ndark place. All substances cannot be preserved by salicylic acid,\r\nand there are certain ferments or fungi which resist the action of\r\nsalicylic acid. If chloroform is not objectionable in any of these\r\npreparations—and only so much is necessary as can be held in actual\r\n_solution_ by the liquid, on an average three drops to the ounce—this\r\npreservative is preferable to salicylic acid.\r\n\r\nThe only fats used in the preparation of emulsions are expressed oil\r\nof almonds, olive oil, and lard. Almond oil is best made by immediate\r\npressure of the bruised fruits, since fresh almond meal likewise finds\r\napplication in perfumery; olive oil and lard must be very carefully\r\npurified. This is done by heating them for one hour with about ten\r\ntimes the quantity of water containing soap (one per cent of the\r\nquantity of fat to be purified). They are then treated five or six\r\ntimes with pure warm water until the latter escapes quite neutral. If\r\nthe water turns red litmus paper blue, it would indicate the presence\r\nof free alkali (soap); if it turns blue litmus paper red, it would\r\nprove the presence of free fatty acids (rancid fat). Either one of\r\nthese substances, especially the latter, would injure the quality\r\nof the product. The fat should be absolutely neutral and have no\r\ninfluence on either kind of litmus paper; then its quality may be\r\npronounced perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFORMULAS FOR THE PREPARATION OF EMULSIONS, MEALS, PASTES, VEGETABLE\r\nMILK, AND COLD-CREAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Emulsions.\r\n\r\nAMANDINE.\r\n\r\n_Almond Cream._—Melt ten pounds of purified lard in an enamelled iron\r\npot or a porcelain vessel, and while increasing the temperature add\r\nlittle by little five pounds of potash lye of 25% strength, stirring\r\nall the time with a broad spatula. When fat and lye have become a\r\nuniform mass, 2¾ to 3½ ounces of alcohol is gradually added, whereby\r\nthe mixture acquires a translucent, crystalline appearance. Before the\r\nalcohol is added three-fourths to one ounce of oil of bitter almond\r\nis dissolved in it. The soapy mass thus obtained is called “almond\r\ncream” (crême d’amandes) and may be used alone for washing. For making\r\nAmandine take of—\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almonds                          10 lb.\r\n  Almond cream                                       3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                                    1 oz.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                               1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                                     150 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove                                     150 grains.\r\n  Oil of mace                                      150 grains.\r\n  Water                                              1¾ oz.\r\n  Sugar                                              3½ oz.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture the following rules should be observed.\r\n\r\nEffect the mixture in a cool room, the cellar in summer, a fireless\r\nroom in winter. Mix the ingredients in a shallow, smooth vessel, best\r\na large porcelain dish, using a very broad, flat stirrer with several\r\nholes. The sugar is first dissolved in the water and intimately mixed\r\nwith the almond cream. The essential oils are dissolved in the almond\r\noil contained in a vessel provided with a stop-cock. The oil is first\r\nallowed to run into the dish in a moderate stream under continual\r\nstirring. The mass soon grows more viscid, and toward the end of the\r\noperation the flow of oil must be carefully restricted so that the\r\nquantity admitted can be at once completely mixed with the contents of\r\nthe dish. Well-made amandine must be rather consistent and white, and\r\nshould not be translucent. If translucency or an oily appearance is\r\nobserved during the mixture, the flow of oil must be at once checked\r\nor enough almond cream must be added to restore the white appearance,\r\nunder active stirring.\r\n\r\nAs amandine is very liable to decompose, it must be immediately filled\r\ninto the vessels in which it is to be kept, and the latter, closed\r\nair-tight, should be preserved in a cool place. By adding ¾ ounce of\r\nsalicylic acid, amandine may be made quite permanent so that it can be\r\nkept unchanged even in a warm place.\r\n\r\nWe have described the preparation of amandine at greater length\r\nbecause its manufacture requires some technical skill and because the\r\npreparation of all other cold-creams corresponds in general with that\r\nof amandine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCERIN EMULSIONS.

GLYCERIN CREAM.\r\n\r\n  Glycerin                   ½ lb.\r\n  Almond oil               14 oz.\r\n  Rose water               12½ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                3½ oz.\r\n  Wax                     480 grains.\r\n  Oil of rose              60 grains.\r\n\r\nMelt the wax and spermaceti by gentle heat, then add the almond oil,\r\nnext the glycerin mixed with the rose water, and lastly the oil of\r\nrose which may also be replaced by some other fragrant oil or mixture.\r\nIf the preparation is to be used in summer, it is advisable to increase\r\nthe wax by one-half, thus giving the mass greater consistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. GLYCERIN JELLY.\r\n\r\n  Glycerin                     2 lb.\r\n  Almond oil                   6 lb.\r\n  Soap                         5½ oz.\r\n  Oil of orange peel         150 grains.\r\n  Oil of thyme                  ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nMix the soap with the glycerin, gradually add the oil (as for\r\namandine), and finally the aromatics.\r\n\r\n\r\nJASMINE EMULSION.\r\n\r\n  Huile antique de jasmin          2 lb.\r\n  Almond cream                     5½ oz.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond          4 lb.\r\n  Water                            5½ oz.\r\n  Sugar                            2¾ oz.\r\n\r\nMix in the same order as given under Amandine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBEROSE EMULSION.\r\n\r\n  Huile antique des tubéroses       1¾ to 2 lb.\r\n  Almond cream                      5½ oz.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond           4 lb.\r\n  Water                             5½ oz.\r\n  Sugar                             2¾ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET EMULSION.\r\n\r\n  Huile antique des violettes       2 to 3 lb.\r\n  Almond cream                      5½ oz.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond           4 lb.\r\n  Water                             5½ oz.\r\n  Sugar                             2¾ oz.\r\n\r\nIn place of the huiles antiques named (_i.e._, fine oils saturated with\r\nthe odors of the corresponding flowers) any other huile antique may\r\nbe used and the cream then called by the name of the flower whose odor\r\nit possesses. Such creams with genuine huiles antiques are among the\r\nfinest preparations known in perfumery and of course are high-priced,\r\nowing to the cost of the huiles antiques.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVINE.\r\n\r\n  Gum acacia                ½ lb.\r\n  Yolk of egg             10 yolks.\r\n  Olive oil                4 lb.\r\n  Soap                     7 oz.\r\n  Water                    8 oz.\r\n  Sugar                    5½ oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot          2 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon             2 oz.\r\n  Oil of clove             1 oz.\r\n  Oil of orange peel        ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of thyme            75 grains.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon         75 grains.\r\n\r\nThe gum, sugar, water, and yolk of eggs are first intimately mixed and\r\ngradually added to the olive oil containing the essential oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Meals and Pastes.\r\n\r\nThe so-called meals (farines) and pastes (pâtes) really consist of\r\nthe flour of fatty vegetable substances which possess the property of\r\nforming an emulsion with water and are frequently used in washes. As\r\nthey are free from alkali, they are the most delicate preparations of\r\nthe kind and are especially suitable for washing the face or sensitive\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE ALMOND PASTE (PÂTE D’AMANDES SIMPLE).\r\n\r\n  Bitter almonds          6 lb.\r\n  Alcohol                 2 qts.\r\n  Rose water              4 qts.\r\n  Oil of bergamot        10½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon            3½ oz.\r\n\r\nPut the bitter almonds in a sieve, dip them for a few seconds in\r\nboiling water, when they can be easily deprived of their brown skin;\r\ncarefully bruise them in a mortar, and place them in a glazed pot set\r\nin another kept full with boiling water; pour over them two quarts of\r\nthe rose water heated to near the boiling-point. Keep up the heat under\r\ncontinual stirring until the almond meal and rose water form a uniform\r\nmass free from granules; in other words, until the meal is changed into\r\npaste. The pot is now allowed to cool somewhat, when the rest of the\r\nrose water and the oils dissolved in alcohol are added. Almond paste\r\nshould have a uniform, butter-like consistence if the first part of the\r\noperation has been carefully performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND AND HONEY PASTE (PÂTE D’AMANDES AU MIEL).\r\n\r\n  Bitter almonds               2 lb.\r\n  Yolk of egg                 30 yolks.\r\n  Honey                        4 lb.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond      4 lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot              1 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of clove                  ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nDecorticate and bruise the bitter almonds and add them with the\r\nessential oils to the mixed yolks, honey, and almond oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND MEAL (FARINE D’AMANDES).\r\n\r\n  Almond meal                      4 lb.\r\n  Orris root, powdered             5½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                     1 oz.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond           150 grains.\r\n  Oil of lemon grass              75 grains.\r\n\r\nAlmond meal here means the bran left after expressing the oil from\r\nsweet almonds. First mix the powdered orris root intimately with the\r\nessential oils and triturate the mass with the almond bran. Other\r\nessential oils may also be used for perfuming the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISTACHIO MEAL (FARINE DE PISTACHES).\r\n\r\n  Pistachio nuts                    4 lb.\r\n  Orris root, powdered              4 lb.\r\n  Oil of lemon                      1¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli                   150 grains.\r\n  Oil of orange peel                1 oz.\r\n\r\nThe pistachio nuts are blanched in the same manner as almonds (see\r\nunder Simple Almond Paste), and then reduced to a meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Vegetable Milk.\r\n\r\nThe several varieties of vegetable milk are merely emulsions containing\r\nsufficient water to give them a milky appearance. They are used as such\r\nfor washes and are in great favor. Owing to the larger amount of water\r\nthey contain, they are more liable to decompose than the preparations\r\ndescribed above, since the fats present in them easily become rancid on\r\naccount of their fine division in the milk.\r\n\r\nIn order to render these preparations more stable, they receive an\r\naddition of about five to ten per cent of their weight of pure glycerin\r\nwhich enhances their cosmetic effect. The addition of about one-half\r\nof one per cent of salicylic acid is likewise to be recommended, as it\r\nmakes them more stable.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we shall describe only the most important of\r\nthese preparations usually made by the perfumer. In this connection we\r\nmay state that by slightly modifying the substances used to perfume\r\nthem, new varieties of vegetable milk can be easily prepared.\r\n\r\nEvery vegetable milk consists in the main of a base of soap, wax,\r\nand spermaceti, and an aromatic water which gives the name to the\r\npreparation. This composition is intended to keep suspended the fatty\r\nvegetable substances (almond or pistachio meal, etc.), thus producing a\r\nmilky appearance.\r\n\r\nVegetable milks are made as follows.\r\n\r\nMelt the soap with the wax and spermaceti at a gentle heat. Prepare\r\na milk from the vegetable substance and the aromatic water (_e.g._,\r\n_unexpressed_ almonds and rose water) by careful trituration, strain it\r\nthrough fine silk gauze into the vessel containing the melted mixture\r\nof soap, wax, and spermaceti, stir thoroughly, let it cool, and add the\r\nalcohol holding in solution the essential oils, the glycerin (and the\r\nsalicylic acid), under continual stirring. The alcohol must be added in\r\na very thin stream, otherwise a portion of the mass will curdle. The\r\ncoarser particles contained in the milk must be allowed to settle by\r\nleaving the preparation at rest for twenty-four hours, when the milk\r\ncan be carefully decanted from the sediment and filled into bottles for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILAC MILK (LAIT DE LILAS).\r\n\r\n  Soap                          2¼ oz.\r\n  Wax                           2¼ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                    2¼ oz.\r\n  Sweet almonds                 1 lb.\r\n  Lilac-flower water            4½ pints.\r\n  Huile antique de lilas        2½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol (80-85% Tralles)      2 lb.\r\n\r\nIn place of lilac-flower water and huile antique de lilas, lilacin\r\n(terpineol) may be used, a sufficient quantity (about 1 oz.) being\r\ndissolved in the alcohol. But the lilacin must be pure and of clean\r\nodor.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINAL MILK (LAIT VIRGINAL).\r\n\r\nThis preparation differs from all other milks sold in perfumery in that\r\nit consists of some aromatic water with tincture of benzoin and tolu.\r\nIn making it, pour the aromatic water in a very thin stream into the\r\ntincture under vigorous stirring. If the water flows in too rapidly,\r\nthe resins present in the tincture separate in lumps; but if slowly\r\npoured in, the resins form minute spheres which remain suspended.\r\nThe preparation is named after the aromatic water it contains: Lait\r\nvirginal de la rose, à fleurs d’oranges, etc. Its formula is:\r\n\r\n  Tincture of benzoin                    2 oz.\r\n  Tincture of tolu                       2¾ oz.\r\n  Aromatic water                         4 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER MILK (LAIT DE CONCOMBRES).\r\n\r\n  Soap                                   1 oz.\r\n  Olive oil                              1 oz.\r\n  Wax                                    1 oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                             1 oz.\r\n  Sweet almonds                          1 lb.\r\n  Cucumber juice (freshly expressed)     4½ pints.\r\n  Extract of cucumber                    1 pint.\r\n  Alcohol                                2 lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANDELION MILK.\r\n\r\n  Soap                                  2¼ oz.\r\n  Olive oil                             2¼ oz.\r\n  Wax                                   2¼ oz.\r\n  Sweet almonds                         1 lb.\r\n  Extract of tuberose                   1 lb.\r\n  Rose water                            5 pints.\r\n  Dandelion juice                       5 oz.\r\n\r\nDandelion juice is the bitter milk sap of the root of the common\r\ndandelion (Leontodon taraxacum); it should be expressed immediately\r\nbefore use. The rose water may be replaced by some other aromatic water\r\nor even ordinary water; but the latter should be distilled, otherwise\r\nthe lime it contains would form an insoluble combination with the soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTER-ALMOND MILK (LAIT D’AMANDES AMÈRES).\r\n\r\n  Bitter almonds                 2¼ oz.\r\n  Soap                           2¼ oz.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond        2¼ oz.\r\n  Wax                            2¼ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                     2¼ oz.\r\n  Rose water                     4 qts.\r\n  Alcohol                        3 pints.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond            ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                1 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                    ½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE MILK (LAIT DE ROSES).\r\n\r\n  Olive oil              2¼ oz.\r\n  Soap                   2¼ oz.\r\n  Wax                    2¼ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti             2¼ oz.\r\n  Sweet almonds          4 lb.\r\n  Oil of rose          150 grains.\r\n  Rose water             4 qts.\r\n  Alcohol                1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISTACHIO MILK (LAIT DE PISTACHES).\r\n\r\n  Soap.                     2¼ oz.\r\n  Olive oil                 2¼ oz.\r\n  Wax                       2¼ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                2¼ oz.\r\n  Pistachio nuts           14 oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli              ¾ oz.\r\n  Orange-flower water       6 qts.\r\n  Alcohol                   1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Cold-Creams and Lip Salves.\r\n\r\nIn the main they resemble in their composition the emulsions and\r\nvegetable milks, but differ by their thick consistence which renders\r\nthem suitable for being rubbed into the skin. Cold-creams are really\r\nsalves perfumed with one of the well-known odors which give them their\r\nnames. Fat forms the basis of these mixtures and gives them their\r\nhygienic effect, as it imparts fulness and softness to the skin. Every\r\nwell-made cold-cream should have the consistence of recently congealed\r\nwax and should yield to the pressure of the finger like pomatum.\r\nIt should be noted that the addition of very thick glycerin will\r\nincrease the effect of the cold-cream and improve its fine transparent\r\nappearance; but this substance must be added with great care, otherwise\r\nthe mass will not possess the required firmness.\r\n\r\nIn making cold-cream, a mixture of wax, spermaceti, and expressed\r\nalmond oil must be combined with an aromatic water and an essential\r\noil. The first part of the operation is easy; the wax and spermaceti\r\nare melted at the lowest possible temperature, and the almond oil is\r\nadded under continual stirring. It is more difficult to unite the other\r\nsubstances with this base; the aromatic water is admitted in a thin\r\nstream under vigorous stirring (or whipping, or churning), and when\r\nit forms a uniform mass with the contents of the mortar the remaining\r\nsubstances are stirred in and the still fluid mass is poured into the\r\nvessels intended for it, and allowed to congeal.\r\n\r\nCold-creams are usually sold in tasteful porcelain jars or vases. To\r\nguard against rancidity of the mass, the vessels are closed either with\r\nground stoppers or with corks covered with tin foil. The essential oils\r\nshould be added last, when the mass has cooled to the congealing-point;\r\nif added before, too much of them is lost by evaporation.\r\n\r\nWe give below several approved formulas for the preparation of some\r\nfavorite cold-creams, and repeat that new varieties can be produced by\r\nintroducing any desired odor into the composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCERIN COLD-CREAM A.\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond                   2 lb.\r\n  Wax                                       2½ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                                2½ oz.\r\n  Glycerin                                  7 oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                            ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                               ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of geranium                            ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli                           150 grains.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon                         150 grains.\r\n  Rose water                                1 lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCERIN COLD-CREAM B.\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond                   2 lb.\r\n  Wax                                       4½ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                                4½ oz.\r\n  Glycerin                                   ½ lb.\r\n  Oil of rose                             150 grains.\r\n  Civet                                    30 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR ICE (CAMPHOR COLD-CREAM).\r\n\r\n  Wax                                       2¼ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                                2¼ oz.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond                   2 lb.\r\n  Camphor                                   4½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rosemary                          90 grains.\r\n  Oil of peppermint                        45 grains.\r\n  Rose water                                2 lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR ICE (PÂTE CAMPHORIQUE).\r\n\r\n  Lard                                      2 lb.\r\n  Wax                                        ½ lb.\r\n  Camphor                                    ½ lb.\r\n  Oil of lavender                            ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rosemary                            ½ oz.\r\n\r\nThis mixture, which is rather firm, is frequently poured into shallow\r\nporcelain boxes; sometimes it is colored red with alkanet root.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR BALLS (SAVONETTES CAMPHORIQUES).\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond         7 oz.\r\n  Purified tallow                 2 lb.\r\n  Wax                             7 oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                      7 oz.\r\n  Camphor                         7 oz.\r\n  Oil of lavender                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of rosemary                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon                75 grains.\r\n\r\nSavonette is generally understood to mean a soap cast in spherical\r\nmoulds; this preparation is, as a rule, likewise sold in this form.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVINE POMADE A.\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond    3 lb.\r\n  Spermaceti                 1 lb.\r\n  Lard                       2 lb.\r\n  Benzoin                    1 lb.\r\n  Vanilla                    7 oz.\r\n  Civet                       ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nThe aromatic substances, having been comminuted, are thoroughly\r\ntriturated with the other ingredients, and the mass is kept for\r\ntwenty-four hours at a temperature of 50 to 60° C.

In Rome there was even, as we have stated\r\nin an earlier part of the book, a special guild of ointment-makers\r\nor unguentarii. They employed a process for making their ointments\r\nfragrant which resembles that of maceration in present use.\r\n\r\nThe so-called pomades (from pomum, apple) were prepared by sticking a\r\nfine apple full of spices and placing it for a long time in liquid fat\r\nwhich absorbed the odor of the spices.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of chemical science, the basis of every pomade or\r\nhair oil is formed by some fat perfumed with aromatic substances and at\r\ntimes colored. The fats generally used are lard, beef marrow, tallow,\r\nbears’ grease, olive or almond oil; some of the firmer fats receive\r\nan addition of a certain amount of paraffin, spermaceti, or wax, in\r\norder to give the pomade greater consistence. As in the manufacture of\r\nall the finer articles, it is essential that whatever fat is employed\r\nshould be perfectly pure; only fat which is absolutely neutral, _i.e._,\r\nfree from acid, can be used, and any sample with but a trace of\r\nrancidity (containing free fatty acids) should be rejected on account\r\nof the penetrating odor peculiar to several of these acids.\r\n\r\nManufacturers who aim at the production of fine goods spare neither\r\ntrouble nor expense in order to obtain perfectly pure fats.\r\n\r\nFats are purified for the purposes of the perfumer in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nThe fat is melted in a bright iron pot or enamelled vessel with three\r\ntimes the quantity of water containing in solution about one per cent\r\n(of the weight of the fat) of alum and one per cent of table salt. Fat\r\nand water are well stirred with a broad flat ladle or some mechanical\r\narrangement within the boiler. After the mass has remained at rest for\r\nsome time, the curdled solid matters are skimmed from the surface. The\r\ntime required for this operation can be much shortened by the use of a\r\npump which raises the fat and water from the boiler and returns them in\r\na fine spray.\r\n\r\nWhen fats with some degree of rancidity are to be made suitable for\r\nthe purposes of the perfumer, 0.5% of caustic soda lye is added to the\r\nwater instead of the alum.\r\n\r\nAfter this treatment is completed, the fat must be washed in order to\r\nfree it from the substances with which it was purified. Formerly this\r\nwashing was done in a manner resembling the grinding of oil colors.\r\nThe fat was placed on a level stone plate and kneaded with a muller\r\nwith flat base under a continual stream of water flowing from above,\r\nuntil the fat was clean. This expensive hand labor is now performed by\r\nmachines, the fat being treated with water in vertical mills.\r\n\r\nNo matter how carefully a fat was purified, it may happen that the\r\npomades made from it, if kept long in stock, may subsequently become\r\nrancid—a circumstance which may destroy the reputation of a factory.\r\nFortunately we know two substances which materially counteract the\r\ntendency of fats to become rancid: salicylic acid and benzoin. Either\r\nof these substances is added to many perfumery articles, especially\r\npomades, in order to prevent rancidity; an admixture of from\r\none-one-thousandth to five-one-thousandths parts of solid salicylic\r\nacid suffices, according to our experiments, for the purpose; of\r\nbenzoin we need about three-fourths of an ounce for every quart of\r\nfat; the resin is only partly soluble in fat, but imparts to it its\r\nvanilla-like odor. For the finest pomades sublimed benzoic acid is\r\nused, in the proportion of about 150 to 240 grains to the quart of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nFORMULAS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF POMADES AND HAIR OILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Pomades.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing perfumery two groups of pomades are\r\ndistinguished—those with a hard base, and those with a soft base. By\r\nbase is meant the fat which is the vehicle of the odor in every pomade.\r\nThe consistence of the substance depends upon its melting-point; lard\r\nand beef marrow, having a low melting-point, furnish soft pomades;\r\nwhile beef and mutton tallow, which often receive an addition of\r\nparaffin, wax, or spermaceti in order to make them firmer, have a\r\nhigher melting-point and serve for hard pomades.\r\n\r\nFrench perfumers put on the market some very fine pomades consisting\r\nof the fat which has served for the absorption of odors by maceration,\r\nenfleurage, etc., and which has been treated with alcohol for the\r\nextraction of the odors (so-called washed pomades). No matter how long\r\nsuch a fat is treated with alcohol, it tenaciously retains a portion of\r\nthe odor to which the great fragrance of these pomades is due and which\r\nhas given them their reputation.\r\n\r\nIf the pomades resulting from the following formulas should turn\r\nout too soft—a fact depending on the climate of the place of\r\nmanufacture—they may receive an addition of a mixture of equal parts\r\nof paraffin, wax, and spermaceti, in portions of respectively five per\r\ncent at each addition, until the desired ointment-like consistence is\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTHARIDAL POMADE.\r\n\r\n  Beef marrow                4 lb.\r\n  Wax                        7 oz.\r\n  Oil of mace              150 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove             150 grains.\r\n  Oil of rose              150 grains.\r\n  Tincture of cantharides     ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nTincture of cantharides is prepared by prolonged maceration of ¾ ounce\r\nof powdered cantharides in one quart of alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCASSIAN POMADE.\r\n\r\n  Benzoin pomade (see below)  2 lb.\r\n  Rose pomade                 1 lb.\r\n  Lard                        2 lb.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond     4 lb.\r\n  Alkanet root                3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose                  ½ oz.\r\n\r\nThe almond oil alone is first macerated with the alkanet root until,\r\nwhen added to the other ingredients, it imparts a beautiful red color\r\nto the pomade.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENZOIN POMADE A.\r\n\r\n  Benzoic acid, sublimed      4¼ oz.\r\n  Purified fat                4 lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENZOIN POMADE B.\r\n\r\n  Benzoin                  12¼ oz.\r\n  Fat                       4 lb.\r\n\r\nMacerate the benzoin or benzoic acid in the fat at the temperature of\r\nboiling water for several hours, and strain the pomade through a cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE POMADES.\r\n\r\nThese pomades are put on the market in excellent quality especially by\r\nFrench manufacturers. They consist of a mixture of washed pomades and\r\nhuiles antiques. The respective quantities must be chosen according to\r\nthe climate of the country for which the articles are intended. Colder\r\ncountries require equal parts by weight of pomades and oils; warmer\r\nclimates, two parts of fat to one of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLIZED OIL (HUILE CRYSTALLISÉE).\r\n\r\n  Huile antique of orange flowers           1 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of roses                    2 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of tuberoses                2 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of violets                  2 lb.\r\n  Spermaceti                                1 lb.\r\n  Paraffin                                  7 oz.\r\n\r\nThe addition of spermaceti and paraffin causes the mixture to assume\r\na crystalline form on cooling, the appearance improving in proportion\r\nas the cooling is slow and gradual. First melt the paraffin and\r\nspermaceti on a water bath, add the huiles antiques, mix thoroughly by\r\nprolonged stirring, and pour the finished product into the vessels in\r\nwhich it is to be sold. These vessels are previously warmed to 60 or\r\n70° C. (140-158°F.), and very slowly after filling, so as to secure a\r\nbeautiful crystalline mass. A second quality of crystalline hair oil is\r\nmade according to the following formula:\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond    10 lb.\r\n  Spermaceti                 21 oz.\r\n  Paraffin                   14 oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot             2 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                4¼ oz.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond      150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOSSOM POMADE (POMADE À FLEURS).\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond    4 lb.\r\n  Jasmine pomade            28 oz.\r\n  Rose pomade               28 oz.\r\n  Violet pomade             28 oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot             ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon             150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAR’S GREASE POMADE (POMADE À GRAISSE D’OURS).\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond          20 lb.\r\n  Lard                             24 lb.\r\n  Cassie pomade                     4 lb.\r\n  Jasmine pomade                    4 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of cassie           1 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of jasmine          1 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of orange flowers   1 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of roses            1 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of tuberoses        1 lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                    ½ lb.\r\n  Oil of lemon                      3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg                     1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of clove                      4¼ oz.\r\n\r\nThis pomade is rather consistent; if it is to be made still firmer for\r\nsummer use or warm climates, the almond oil should be diminished and\r\nthe lard increased in proportion, or some tallow and wax added. The\r\npomade is made by mixing the oil and lard, adding next the pomades and\r\nhuiles antiques, and finally the essential oils. The temperature should\r\nnot be higher than suffices to keep the mass liquid; the mixture is\r\neffected by vigorous stirring, and is then at once, though gradually,\r\ncooled.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF-MARROW POMADE (POMADE À MOËLLE DE BŒUF).\r\n\r\n  Lard                                 8 lb.\r\n  Beef marrow                          4 lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                      1 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                         2 oz.\r\n  Oil of mace                          150 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove                         150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARROW CREAM (CRÊME DE MOËLLE).\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond              4 lb.\r\n  Lard                                 4 lb.\r\n  Palm oil                             3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                      2 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                         7 oz.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg                      150 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove                       150 grains.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon                    150 grains.\r\n\r\nThe public is accustomed to receive the last two pomades in the form\r\nof froth. This can be easily effected by whipping the pomade during\r\ncooling with an egg-beater until it is solidified.\r\n\r\n\r\nCINCHONA POMADE (POMADE À QUINQUINE).\r\n\r\n  Lard                                4 lb.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond             1 lb.\r\n  Beef marrow                         6 lb.\r\n  Peru balsam                         1 oz.\r\n  Cinchona bark                        ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of clove                        1 oz.\r\n  Oil of rose                       150 grains.\r\n\r\nMacerate the finely powdered bark in the fat for some hours, add the\r\nPeru balsam, strain through a cloth, and incorporate the essential\r\noils. The pomade is vaunted as a hair tonic, as well as\r\n\r\n\r\nTANNO-QUININE POMADE,\r\n\r\nwhich is prepared in the same way; the only difference being the\r\naddition of 150 grains of tannin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTOR-OIL CREAM (CRÊME DE RICINE).\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond                            3 lb.\r\n  Castor oil                                         3 lb.\r\n  Rose pomade                                        2 lb.\r\n  Orange-flower pomade                               2 lb.\r\n  Tuberose pomade                                    2 lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                                    7 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                                       3½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE-FLOWER POMADE (POMADE À FLEURS D’ORANGES).\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond                           38½ oz.\r\n  Cassie pomade                                     38½ oz.\r\n  Rose pomade                                       35 oz.\r\n  Jasmine pomade                                    35 oz.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                             150 grains.\r\n  Oil of neroli                                       ½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELIOTROPE POMADE (POMADE DE HÉLIOTROPE).\r\n\r\n  Rose pomade                                        4 lb.\r\n  Orange-flower pomade                               1 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of jasmine                           2 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of orange flower                     1 lb.\r\n  Huile antique of tuberose                          1 lb.\r\n  Vanilla pomade                                     2 lb.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                             150 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove                                      75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPARENT POMADE.\r\n\r\n  Expressed oil of almond                            6 lb.\r\n  Wax                                                5½ oz.\r\n  Spermaceti                                         1 lb.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond                              75 grains.\r\n  Oil of rose                                      150 grains.\r\n  Tincture of musk                                   1½ oz.\r\n\r\nThe pomade is completely liquefied after being mixed and allowed to\r\ncongeal in the vessels in which it is marketed. If successful, the\r\nproduct must be quite transparent or at least decidedly translucent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONKA CREAM.\r\n\r\n  Tonka beans                                        1 lb.\r\n  Lard                                               8 lb.\r\n\r\nThe powdered beans are stirred into the melted fat, in which they\r\nremain for several days, the fat being agitated from time to time; when\r\nit smells strong enough, it is strained through fine linen, and the\r\ntonka beans are treated with another quantity of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET POMADE (POMADE DES VIOLETTES).\r\n\r\n  Lard                                               4 lb.\r\n  Cassie pomade                                      3 lb.\r\n  Rose pomade                                        2 lb.\r\n  Violet pomade                                      2 lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLA CREAM (CRÊME DE VANILLE).\r\n\r\n  Vanilla                                            7 oz.\r\n  Lard                                               6 lb.\r\n\r\nIn making this pomade the material is treated the same as in preparing\r\ntonka pomade. Ordinary vanilla pomade is made by triturating:\r\n\r\n  Peru balsam                                        7 oz.\r\n  Lard                                               2 lb.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond                            2 lb.\r\n\r\nFirst triturate the balsam with the almond oil and gradually add the\r\nlard.

Unfortunately there are but few persons who can boast of a\r\nperfectly healthy set of teeth, which is found as a normal condition\r\nonly among savages and animals. The chief causes of the admitted fact\r\nthat most persons have some defect in the mouth—bad teeth, pale gums,\r\noffensive odor—lie in part in our civilization with the ingestion of\r\nhot and sometimes sour food, in part in the lack of attention bestowed\r\non the care of the mouth by many people. The care of the mouth is most\r\nimportant after meals and in the morning; particles of food lodge even\r\nbetween the most perfect teeth and undergo rapid decomposition in the\r\nhigh temperature prevailing in the mouth. This gives rise to a most\r\ndisagreeable odor, and the decomposition quickly extends to the teeth.\r\n\r\nPerfectly normal healthy teeth consist of a hard, brilliant external\r\ncoat, the enamel, which opposes great resistance to acid and\r\ndecomposing substances. But unfortunately the enamel is very sensitive\r\nto changes of temperature and easily cracks, thus admitting to the bony\r\npart of the teeth such deleterious substances and leading to their\r\ndestruction. The bulk of the tooth consists of a porous mass of bone\r\nwhich is easily destroyed, and thus the entire set may be lost.\r\n\r\nHygienic perfumery is able to offer to the public means by which a\r\nhealthy set of teeth can be kept in good condition and the disease\r\narrested in affected teeth, and by which an agreeable freshness is\r\nimparted to the gums and lips. While true perfumes may be looked upon\r\nas more or less of a luxury, the hygiene of the mouth is a necessity;\r\nfor we have to deal with the health and preservation of the important\r\nmasticatory apparatus which is necessary to the welfare of the whole\r\nbody, so that the æsthetic factor occupies a secondary position, or\r\nrather results as a necessary consequence from a proper care of the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nWith no other hygienic article have so many sins been committed as with\r\nthose intended for the teeth; we have had occasion to examine a number\r\nof tooth powders, some of them very high-priced, which were decidedly\r\ninjurious. Thus we have known of cases in which powdered pumice stone,\r\ncolored and perfumed, has been sold as a tooth powder. Pumice stone,\r\nhowever, resembles glass in its composition and acts on the teeth\r\nlike a fine file which rapidly wears away the enamel and exposes the\r\nfrail bony substance. It needs no further explanation to prove the\r\ndestructive effects of such a powder on the teeth.\r\n\r\nMany person prize finely powdered wood charcoal as a tooth powder, and\r\nto some extent they are right. Wood charcoal always contains alkalies\r\nwhich neutralize the injurious acids, besides traces of products of dry\r\ndistillation which prevent decomposition. But these valuable properties\r\nare counteracted by the fact that charcoal is always more or less\r\ngritty, or, being insoluble, will lodge between the teeth and form the\r\nnucleus for the lodgement of other substances.\r\n\r\nIn compounding articles for the mouth and teeth—tooth powders and mouth\r\nwashes—the objects aimed at are to neutralize the chemical processes\r\nthat injure the teeth and gums, and to restore freshness and resisting\r\npower to the relaxed gums and mucous membranes.\r\n\r\nRemnants of food left in the mouth after meals soon develop acids which\r\nattack the teeth; they are neutralized by basic substances or alkalies\r\nwhich counteract them.\r\n\r\nThe formation of organic acids from food remnants is caused by\r\nmicroscopic fungi (schizomycetes) which adhere to the teeth (so-called\r\ntartar) in the absence of cleanliness; against these parasites there\r\nare at our disposal a number of substances which kill them rapidly and\r\nthus for a time arrest the process of decomposition; they are therefore\r\ncalled antiseptics.\r\n\r\nAnother group of ingredients acts especially on such abnormal\r\nconditions of the membranous and fleshy parts of the mouth as manifest\r\nthemselves by colorless, easily bleeding gums. It is mainly compounds\r\nof the tannin group which strengthen the gums and are known as\r\nastringents.\r\n\r\nIn compounding articles for the teeth it has thus far unfortunately\r\nnot been customary to combine several of the substances having the\r\nabove properties, the general rule being to incorporate only one in the\r\ncomposition, and some so-called tooth lotions consist even of aromatics\r\nalone. Such articles perfume the mouth, but have no hygienic effect\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nAmong the essential oils, however, there is one which should form a\r\npart of every article intended for the care of the mouth, provided it\r\ncan remain unchanged in the presence of the other ingredients, which\r\nwould not be the case where permanganate of potassium is used. Oil of\r\npeppermint and other mint oils exert a very refreshing influence on\r\nthe mucous membranes of the mouth, in which they leave a sensation of\r\nfreshness lasting for some time.\r\n\r\nWe give below a number of formulas for the manufacture of articles for\r\nthe care of the mouth, as to the value of which the reader can form\r\nhis own opinion from what has been stated. Finally it may be observed\r\nthat several of the so-called secret preparations for the care of the\r\nmouth are arrant humbugs, worthless substances being sold at exorbitant\r\nprices and, worse yet, lacking the vaunted hygienic effect owing to\r\ntheir chemical composition.\r\n\r\nThe articles for the care of the mouth and teeth may be divided into\r\ntooth pastes, tooth powders, tooth tinctures or lotions, and mouth\r\nwashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Tooth Pastes.\r\n\r\nTOOTH SOAP (SAVON DENTIFRICE).\r\n\r\n  Soap                               2 lb.\r\n  Talcum                             2 lb.\r\n  Orris root                         2 lb.\r\n  Sugar                              1 lb.\r\n  Water                              1 lb.\r\n  Oil of clove                       150 grains.\r\n  Oil of peppermint                   ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nThe soap should be good, well-boiled tallow soap; it is mixed with\r\nthe other ingredients (the sugar is to be previously dissolved in\r\nthe water) by thorough and prolonged stirring, and is usually sold in\r\nshallow porcelain boxes. The talcum or French chalk is a soft mineral\r\nwith a fatty feel and is a common commercial article.\r\n\r\nThis tooth soap and other similar preparations for the care of the\r\nmouth are frequently colored rose red. Of course only harmless colors\r\ncan be used. The most appropriate are rose madder lake and carmine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOTH PASTE (PÂTE DENTIFRICE).\r\n\r\n  Prepared chalk                     2 lb.\r\n  Orris root                         2 lb.\r\n  Sugar                              2 lb.\r\n  Water                              1 lb.\r\n  Madder lake                         ¾ to 1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lavender                  150 grains.\r\n  Oil of mace                      150 grains.\r\n  Oil of clove                     150 grains.\r\n  Oil of peppermint                  1 oz.\r\n  Oil of rose                      150 grains.\r\n\r\nThe prepared chalk used in this and many other articles is pure\r\n_precipitated_ carbonate of lime. It is made from pieces of white\r\nmarble, the offal from sculptors’ workshops, which are placed in wide\r\nporcelain or glass vessels and covered with hydrochloric acid, when\r\nabundant vapors of carbonic acid are given off. When the development\r\nof carbonic acid has ceased, the liquid is allowed to stand at rest\r\nfor several days with an excess of marble, whereby all the iron oxide\r\nis separated. This is necessary, otherwise the preparation would not\r\nbe white, but yellowish. The liquid is filtered and treated with a\r\nsolution of carbonate of soda (sal soda), in water as long as any white\r\nprecipitate results. This precipitate is washed with pure water on a\r\nfilter, and when slowly dried it forms a fine, brilliant white powder.\r\nCrystalline calcium chloride may also be purchased, dissolved in water,\r\nand treated with the soda solution to obtain the white precipitate.\r\nThe quantity of madder lake in the above formula is given within the\r\nlimits to form light or dark red tooth paste.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

For this and many other tooth\r\ntinctures rhatany root is also frequently used. Rhatany root is derived\r\nfrom Krameria triandra, a South American plant. Its alcoholic tincture\r\nhas a red color.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. FRENCH FORMULA.\r\n\r\n  Anise               10 oz.\r\n  Cochineal             ¾ oz.\r\n  Mace               150 grains.\r\n  Cloves.            150 grains.\r\n  Cinnamon             2¾ oz.\r\n  Alcohol              3 qts.\r\n  Oil of peppermint     ¾ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. ENGLISH FORMULA.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of cedar      4 qts.\r\n  Tincture of myrrh      1 qt.\r\n  Tincture of rhatany    1 qt.\r\n  Oil of lavender         ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of peppermint      1 oz.\r\n  Oil of rose          150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORATED TOOTH TINCTURE.\r\n\r\n  Borax            5½ oz.\r\n  Myrrh            5½ oz.\r\n  Red santal wood  5½ oz.\r\n  Sugar            5½ oz.\r\n  Cologne water    1 qt.\r\n  Alcohol          3 qts.\r\n  Water            3 pints.\r\n\r\nMacerate the myrrh and santal wood in the alcohol, then add the Cologne\r\nwater, and lastly the sugar and borax dissolved in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHORATED COLOGNE WATER.\r\n\r\n  Camphor        1 lb.\r\n  Cologne water  4 qts.\r\n\r\nCologne water with myrrh is made in the same way, by substituting a\r\nlike weight of myrrh for the camphor.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE MILAN.\r\n\r\n  Kino                 3½ oz.\r\n  Civet               75 grains.\r\n  Cinnamon              ¾ oz.\r\n  Alcohol              5 qts.\r\n  Oil of bergamot    150 grains.\r\n  Oil of lemon       150 grains.\r\n  Oil of peppermint     ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nKino contains an astringent, a variety of tannin, and forms a dark red\r\nsolution with alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE MIALHE.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of benzoin     ¾ oz.\r\n  Tincture of tolu        ¾ oz.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla  150 grains.\r\n  Kino                   5½ oz.\r\n  Alcohol                5 qts.\r\n  Oil of anise.         75 grains.\r\n  Oil of peppermint       ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of star-anise     75 grains.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon      150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRRH TOOTH TINCTURE.\r\n\r\n  Mace           1¾ oz.\r\n  Myrrh.         8 oz.\r\n  Cloves         8 oz.\r\n  Rhatany root.  8 oz.\r\n  Alcohol        5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORAL MOUTH WASH.\r\n\r\n  Chloral hydrate   1 oz.\r\n  Water            10 oz.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of this, rinsed about the mouth, removes every trace\r\nof bad odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM PERMANGANATE WATER.\r\n\r\n  Potassium permanganate  3½ oz.\r\n  Distilled water         5 qts.\r\n\r\nPotassium permanganate easily dissolves in distilled water and forms a\r\nbeautiful violet solution, a few drops of which are placed in a glass\r\nof water for use. This salt is one of the most valuable articles for\r\nthe teeth; it has the property of readily giving off oxygen to organic\r\nsubstances and hence immediately destroys all odor in the mouth by\r\noxidizing the organic bodies; it also removes at once the odor of\r\ntobacco smoke. After rinsing the mouth with this solution, it is well\r\nto use some peppermint water for polishing the teeth. This mouth wash\r\nleaves brown stains on linen and other materials as well as on the\r\nskin; such spots can only be removed with acids (hydrochloric, oxalic,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nSALICYLATED TOOTH TINCTURE.\r\n\r\n  Salicylic acid        1¾ oz.\r\n  Orange-flower water  30 grains.\r\n  Water                 2 qts.\r\n  Alcohol               1 qt.\r\n  Oil of peppermint    30 grains.\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid is a substance possessing strong antiseptic properties;\r\ntherefore, when this mouth wash is used after meals, the occurrence of\r\nany bad odor, even in persons with defective teeth, is prevented and\r\nthe progress of caries is arrested, so that the acid may be considered\r\none of the most valuable substances in hygienic perfumery.\r\n\r\nDissolve the salicylic acid in the warm alcohol mixed with water; add\r\nto the still warm solution the orange-flower water and the oil of\r\npeppermint dissolved in some of the alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE SALVIA.\r\n\r\n  Oil of lemon.   ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of sage    1¾ oz.\r\n  Alcohol        1 qt.\r\n  Water          4 qts.\r\n\r\nThe essential oils are dissolved in the alcohol, and this solution\r\nmixed with the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE VIOLETTES.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of orris root  1 qt.\r\n  Rose water, triple      1 qt.\r\n  Alcohol                 1 qt.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond   75 grains.\r\n  Oil of neroli          30 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nCOSMETIC PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn cosmetic perfumery, use is made chiefly of articles which serve to\r\nbeautify some parts of the body by artificial means; for instance, to\r\nimpart to pale cheeks a youthful freshness or to restore to prematurely\r\ngray hair its original appearance. In so far as the former object is\r\nattained also by the preparations discussed in Chapters XXI., XXII.,\r\nXXIII., and XXIV., they likewise belong to the domain of cosmetic\r\nperfumery; for health and beauty are inseparably connected.\r\n\r\nThough we have separated hygienic from cosmetic perfumery, we have done\r\nso only in order to draw the line between preparations whose regular\r\nuse really improves the bodily health, and those which temporarily\r\ncover a defect of certain parts of the body.\r\n\r\nCosmetics may also be divided into several groups—those for beautifying\r\nthe skin, as paints and toilet powders; and those for the care of the\r\nhair. The latter are subdivided into hair washes, hair dyes, so-called\r\nhair tonics, depilatories, and preparations for dressing the hair,\r\n_i.e._, for making it glossy and fixing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nSKIN COSMETICS AND FACE LOTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of skin cosmetics and paints is of remote antiquity, but varies\r\nin different nations according to their civilization and their sense\r\nof beauty. While among certain Oriental nations dark blue rings around\r\nthe eyes, with yellow lips and nails, pass for beautiful, the European\r\nprizes only a white skin with a delicate tinge of red; Italian ladies\r\nin the middle ages used the dark red juice of the fruit of the deadly\r\nnight-shade as a paint, hence the name bella donna, _i.e._, beautiful\r\nlady. (According to Matthiolus, the name _herba bella donna_ arose\r\nfrom the fact that Italian ladies used a distilled water of the plant\r\nas a cosmetic.) Owing to its marked effect on the eyes, by dilating\r\nthe pupil and increasing the lustre, this juice also heightens the\r\nbrilliancy of the eye, though at the expense of its health.\r\n\r\nWhile in the last century face-painting was a universal fashion, it\r\nis nowadays resorted to only by persons whose skin requires some\r\nartificial help. But nobody desires that the cosmetic should be\r\nperceptible on the skin. Hence it must be laid down as a rule that\r\npaints and all cosmetics should be so compounded that it is not easily\r\npossible to the observer to recognize that some artificial means has\r\nbeen employed for beautifying the skin.\r\n\r\nWe give below a number of such articles, which come as near as possible\r\nto this ideal without injuring the skin. As every skin cosmetic cannot\r\nbut occlude the pores of the skin, it should be removed as soon as\r\npossible—an advice to be heeded particularly by actors and actresses,\r\nwho must appear painted on the boards.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. White Skin Cosmetics.\r\n\r\nFRENCH WHITE (BLANC FRANÇAIS).\r\n\r\n  Talcum            4 lb.\r\n  Oil of lemon     75 grains.\r\n  Oil of bergamot  75 grains.\r\n\r\nThe talcum must be reduced to the finest powder, levigated, dried, and\r\nthen perfumed. Owing to its unctuous nature, it readily adheres to the\r\nskin, and as it has no effect on it and does not change color, it is\r\nthe best of all powders.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID BISMUTH WHITE; PEARL WHITE (BLANC PERLÉ LIQUIDE).\r\n\r\n  Subnitrate of bismuth  1 lb.\r\n  Rose water             1 qt.\r\n  Orange-flower water    1 qt.\r\n\r\nWhen standing at rest, the subnitrate of bismuth sinks to the bottom,\r\nwhile the supernatant fluid becomes quite clear. The bottle must\r\ntherefore be vigorously shaken immediately before use. When this\r\npreparation remains on the skin for some length of time, it loses its\r\npure white color and becomes yellow, or darker, through the gradual\r\nformation of a black sulphur compound.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENETIAN CHALK (CRAIE VENÉTIENNE).\r\n\r\nis made exactly like the French white, above; the only difference\r\nbetween the two preparations is that the talcum for the latter is\r\nbrought to a red heat, which, however, causes it in part to lose the\r\npower of adhering to the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Red Skin Cosmetics (Rouges).\r\n\r\nROUGE VÉGETAL ROSE LIQUIDE.\r\n\r\n  Ammonia water             2 oz.\r\n  Carmine                   1¼ oz.\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)  2½ oz.\r\n  Rose water                2 qts.\r\n\r\nThis superior preparation, which serves mainly for coloring the lips,\r\nis made as follows: Reduce the carmine to powder; macerate it in the\r\nammonia in a three or four pint bottle for several days, add the other\r\ningredients, and let it stand for a week under oft-repeated agitation.\r\nAt the end of that time the bottle is left undisturbed until the\r\ncontents have become quite clear, when they are carefully decanted and\r\nfilled into bottles for sale.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain this preparation in proper form, only the finest\r\ncarmine should be used. That known in the market as “No. 40” is the\r\nbest. This alone will produce a cosmetic that, when brought in contact\r\nwith the skin, will give a vivid red color.\r\n\r\nIn place of carmine, which requires the presence of ammonia if it is\r\nto remain in solution, the anilin color known as _eosine_ may be used.\r\nOf this, very minute amounts will be sufficient to impart the proper\r\ntint. It is impracticable to give exact proportions, as these must be\r\ndetermined in each case by experiment. It is necessary to avoid an\r\nexcess. The tint of a liquid colored by eosine may not appear deep, and\r\nyet when it is applied to the skin a decidedly deeper stain than was\r\ndesired may be produced. Hence each addition of fresh coloring matter\r\nmust be carefully controlled by a practical test.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGE EN FEUILLES.\r\n\r\nCut from thick, highly calendered paper circular disks about 2½ inches\r\nin diameter, and cover them with a layer of carmine containing just\r\nenough gum acacia to make it adhere to the paper. For use, the leaf\r\nis breathed on, a pledget of fine cotton is rubbed over it, and the\r\nadhering color is transferred to the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGE EN PÂTE.\r\n\r\n  Carmine      1 oz.\r\n  Talcum      21 oz.\r\n  Gum acacia   1¾ oz.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients in finest powder are mixed in a mortar by prolonged\r\ntrituration, then water is added in small portions to form a doughy\r\nmass to be filled into shallow porcelain dishes about the diameter\r\nof a dollar. If the rouge is desired darker for the use of actors\r\nand dark-complexioned persons, the proportion of carmine should be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGE EN TASSES.\r\n\r\n  Carthamin       1 oz.\r\n  Talcum powder   1 lb.\r\n  Gum acacia      1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose    15 grains.\r\n\r\nThis rouge, when dry, has a greenish metallic lustre; it is prepared\r\nand sold like rouge en pâte.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEU VÉGETAL POUR LES VEINES.\r\n\r\n  Venetian chalk  1 lb.\r\n  Berlin blue     1¾ oz.\r\n  Gum acacia      1 oz.\r\n\r\nTo the powdered solids add sufficient water to form a mass to be rolled\r\ninto sticks. For use, a pencil is breathed on, rubbed against the rough\r\nside of a piece of white glove leather, and the veins are marked with\r\nthe adhering color on the skin coated with pearl white. Of course, some\r\ndexterity is required to make the veins appear natural by the use of\r\nthis blue color.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGE ALLOXANE (ALLOXAN RED; MUREXIDE PAINT).\r\n\r\n  Cold cream   1 lb.\r\n  Alloxan     75 grains.\r\n\r\nDissolve the alloxan in a little water and mix it intimately with any\r\ndesired cold-cream. The mixture is white, but when transferred to the\r\nskin gradually becomes red. The preparation sold in Austria, etc.,\r\nunder the name of “Schnuda” is identical with this alloxan paint.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Face Lotions.\r\n\r\nThe skin often contains spots with marked color which are more or\r\nless unsightly; for instance, freckles, liver spots, mother’s marks\r\n(nævi), etc. Unfortunately we know of no remedy which radically removes\r\nthem; even chemical preparations with the most energetic effects,\r\nwhich of course must never be employed owing to their destructive\r\naction on the skin, cannot entirely do away with these dark spots\r\nwhich have their seat in the lower layers of the skin. But the public\r\ndemands preparations for the removal of freckles, liver spots, etc.,\r\nand—obtains them. We subjoin the formulas for several of such secret\r\nremedies, but declare emphatically that none of them will completely\r\neffect the desired result.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRECKLE MILK (LAIT ANTÉPHELIQUE).\r\n\r\n  Camphor                1¾ oz.\r\n  Ammonium chloride        ¾ oz.\r\n  Corrosive sublimate  150 grains.\r\n  Albumen                3½ oz.\r\n  Rose water             2 lb.\r\n\r\nWe call attention to the fact that the sublimate (bichloride of\r\nmercury) is very poisonous and must be used with the greatest care.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRECKLE LOTION.\r\n\r\n  Angelica root           1¾ oz.\r\n  Black hellebore root    1¾ oz.\r\n  Storax                   ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot       150 grains.\r\n  Oil of citron         150 grains.\r\n  Alcohol                 2 qts.\r\n\r\nMacerate for a week and filter.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU LENTICULEUSE.\r\n\r\n  Potassium carbonate  7 oz.\r\n  Sugar                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Orange-flower water  2 qts.\r\n  Alcohol              7 oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILIONESE I.\r\n\r\n  Potassium carbonate   14 oz.\r\n  Water                  4 lb.\r\n  Rose water            14 oz.\r\n  Alcohol                7 oz.\r\n  Oil of rose          150 grains.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon       75 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILIONESE II.\r\n\r\n  Rose water           2 qts.\r\n  Orange-flower water  1 qt.\r\n  Glycerin             1 lb.\r\n  Potassium carbonate  3½ oz.\r\n  Tincture of benzoin   ¾ to 1¾ oz.\r\n\r\nAdd only enough of the alcoholic tincture of benzoin to render the\r\nliquid slightly opalescent or milky.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTION FOR CHAPPED SKIN.\r\n\r\n  Glycerin    4 lb.\r\n  Water       1 qt.\r\n  Rose water  1 qt.\r\n\r\nColor pale red with cochineal.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE PERLES.\r\n\r\n  White soap                1 lb.\r\n  Dissolved in: Water       4 qts.\r\n                Glycerin    2 lb.\r\n  Add: Rose water           1 qt.\r\n       Tincture of musk   150 grains.\r\n\r\nTo be colored bluish with some indigo-carmin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEINT DE VENUS.\r\n\r\n  Alcoholic soap solution   2 qts.\r\n  Carbonate of potassium    3½ oz.\r\n  Extract of orange flower  3½ oz.\r\n\r\nThe soap solution is made as concentrated as possible, and the entire\r\nfluid colored with cochineal; in place of the extract of orange flower,\r\nother essences or extracts may also be employed. For use, some of the\r\nliquid is poured into the wash water.\r\n\r\n\r\nPULCHÉRINE.\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of potassium   14 oz.\r\n  Water                     4 lb.\r\n  Orange-flower water       2 lb.\r\n  Alcohol                   3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli           150 grains.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla        ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nThe preceding preparations owe their activity merely to the presence of\r\ncarbonate of potassium which forms an emulsion with the fat of the skin\r\nand thus resembles in its effects a mild soap. The other ingredients\r\nonly serve to render the composition fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Toilet Powders.\r\n\r\nToilet powders are used to impart whiteness and smoothness to the skin;\r\nhence they are merely a kind of dry cosmetic which are applied by means\r\nof a powder puff or a hare’s foot. Their main ingredients are starch\r\nand talcum powders, perfumed and sometimes tinted a rose-red color.\r\nIt is immaterial what kind of starch is used; rice, wheat, and potato\r\nstarch are equally effective, provided they are clear white and in the\r\nfinest powder. In some cases the bitter-almond bran remaining after the\r\nexpression of the fixed oil and the preparation of the oil of bitter\r\nalmond is likewise used for toilet powders. The more thoroughly these\r\npowders are rubbed into the skin, the whiter the latter becomes and the\r\nless easily can they be detected.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE TOILET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  Fine levigated zinc white   1¾ oz.\r\n  Venetian talcum             1¾ oz.\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia       1¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose                20 drops.\r\n  Oil of orris               20 drops.\r\n\r\nMix intimately.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK TOILET POWDER.\r\n\r\n  White toilet powder (see above)  5½ oz.\r\n  Carmine                          8 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUDRE DE PISTACHES.\r\n\r\n  Pistachio meal   10 lb.\r\n  Talcum           10 lb.\r\n  Oil of lavender    ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose        ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon  75 grains.\r\n\r\nThe oil must have been completely extracted from the pistachio meal,\r\nwhich is to be reduced to the finest powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUDRE À LA ROSE.\r\n\r\n  Starch powder      20 lb.\r\n  Carmine              ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose          ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of santal        ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of vetiver    150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUDRE À LA VIOLETTE.\r\n\r\n  Starch powder                20 lb.\r\n  Orris root, in fine powder   10 lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot                ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                   ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of clove                150 grains.\r\n  Oil of neroli               150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUDRE BLANCHE SURFINE (POUDRE DE RIZ).\r\n\r\n  Starch powder           20 lb.\r\n  Subnitrate of bismuth    2 lb.\r\n  Oil of lemon              ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose            150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLANC DE PERLES SEC (DRY PEARL WHITE).\r\n\r\n  Venetian chalk         20 lb.\r\n  Subnitrate of bismuth  42 oz.\r\n  Zinc white             42 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon            1½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTI-ODORIN.\r\n\r\n  Starch powder     1 lb.\r\n  Salicylic acid  150 grains.\r\n\r\nThis mixture, which is best left unperfumed, does excellent service\r\nwhen used to prevent an offensive odor in stockings or shoes. The\r\ninside of the stockings is dusted with the powder, and every week a\r\nteaspoonful is sprinkled into the shoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIN GLOSS.\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of potassium    1¾ oz.\r\n  Powdered spermaceti       1¾ oz.\r\n  Starch powder             1 lb.\r\n  Benzoin                    ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond    150 grains.\r\n\r\nMix intimately and preserve in well-closed boxes. For use, stir some\r\ninto water.\r\n\r\n\r\nKALODERM.\r\n\r\n  Wheat flour                 4 lb.\r\n  Almond bran                 1 lb.\r\n  Orris root, in fine powder  1 lb.\r\n  Extract of rose             1 pint.\r\n  Glycerin                    6 fl. oz.\r\n\r\nForm into a dough which is thinned with water and painted on the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSK PASTE (FOR WASHING THE HANDS).\r\n\r\n  Powdered white soap            2 lb.\r\n  Orris root, in fine powder      ½ lb.\r\n  Starch powder                  1½ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon                    ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli                150 grains.\r\n  Tincture of musk               1½ fl. oz.\r\n  Glycerin                      12 fl. oz.\r\n\r\nRub the starch with the glycerin in a mortar until they are thoroughly\r\nmixed. Then transfer the mixture to a porcelain capsule and apply a\r\nheat gradually raised to 284° F. (and not exceeding 290° F.), stirring\r\nconstantly, until the starch granules are completely dissolved, and a\r\ntranslucent jelly is formed. Then gradually incorporate with it the\r\npowdered soap and orris root, and lastly the oils and tincture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nHAIR COSMETICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of preparations used for the care of the hair and beard is\r\nconsiderable. Unfortunately we are forced to admit that the majority of\r\nthem, especially those said to strengthen the scalp and to stimulate\r\nthe growth of the hair, are utterly inert. Thus far we know too little\r\nof the natural conditions of growth of the hair to enable us to\r\ncompound remedies which would actively aid the efforts of nature in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we cannot speak with approval of the preparations used\r\nto color the hair, either from a chemico-sanitary or from an æsthetic\r\nstandpoint; many of them contain substances which positively injure\r\nthe hair or impart to it an unnatural color which is detected at first\r\nsight. But a well-made cosmetic should never produce this effect, and\r\nnature must be faithfully imitated if the preparation is to deserve the\r\nname of a cosmetic.\r\n\r\nWith the so-called hair and beard elixirs almost incredible swindles\r\nare perpetrated; the practical perfumer, however, cannot advise against\r\nthe use of such worthless preparations among his goods, as they are\r\nin daily demand. This is the reason why we furnish the formulas for\r\nsome of these secret preparations; anybody at all familiar with\r\nthe principles of chemistry and physiology will recognize their\r\nworthlessness from their composition. The only articles of practical\r\nvalue are those intended for cleansing the hair, for making it soft and\r\nglossy, some of the hair dyes, and the preparations for fixing the hair\r\nin certain positions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Hair Washes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU D’ATHÈNES.\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of potassium  2½ oz.\r\n  Sassafras wood          8 oz.\r\n  Rose water              4 qts.\r\n  Orange-flower water     4 qts.\r\n  Alcohol                 1 qt.\r\n\r\nMacerate the ingredients for one month. The carbonate of potassium\r\nand the alcohol cleanse the hair and remove the fat. After using this\r\nwash and drying the hair, its fat and gloss should be restored by the\r\napplication of a good pomade or hair oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU GLYCERINÉE AUX CANTHARIDES.\r\n\r\n  Ammonia water                         3½ oz.\r\n  Tincture of cantharides (see below)   3½ oz.\r\n  Rosemary water                        8 qts.\r\n  Glycerin                             10½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose                            ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nThe tincture of cantharides is made by macerating 1¾ oz. of powdered\r\nSpanish flies (Lytta vesicatoria) in one quart of strong alcohol. The\r\ncaustic ammonia has a similar cleansing effect as the carbonate of\r\npotassium; the glycerin makes the hair soft; the entire preparation is\r\na happy combination, as it cleanses and softens the hair at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE FLEURS; EXTRAIT VÉGÉTAL.\r\n\r\n  Extract of cassie         7 oz.\r\n  Extract of jasmine        7 oz.\r\n  Extract of orange flower  7 oz.\r\n  Tincture of tonka         3½ oz.\r\n  Extract of tuberose       7 oz.\r\n  Tincture of vanilla       3½ oz.\r\n  Rose water                2 qts.\r\n  Alcohol                   2 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE LAURIER.\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of ammonium.   5½ oz.\r\n  Borax                    5½ oz.\r\n  Oil of sweet bay          ½ oz.\r\n  Oil of rose             75 grains.\r\n  Rose water               5 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE ROMARIN.\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of potassium    1¾ oz.\r\n  Rosemary water            4 qts.\r\n  Essence of rose (triple)  1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU SAPONIQUE.\r\n\r\n  Rose water           5 qts.\r\n  Rondeletia perfume  10½ oz.\r\n  Saffron             75 grains.\r\n  Soap                 1 oz.\r\n  Alcohol             10½ oz.\r\n\r\nBoil the finely divided soap and the saffron with some distilled water\r\nuntil the soap is completely dissolved, add the other ingredients, mix\r\nintimately, and let stand for some days to allow the coarser particles\r\nof saffron to settle. This preparation has a particularly handsome\r\nappearance; in cut-glass bottles it shows a peculiar opalescence or\r\niridescence; in transmitted light it represents an almost perfectly\r\ntransparent, saffron-yellow liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU VICTORIA.\r\n\r\n  Ammonia water             1 oz.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond   1 oz.\r\n  Oil of mace              75 grains.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg            75 grains.\r\n  Essence of rosemary      21 oz.\r\n  Rose water                4 lb.\r\n\r\nMix the ingredients, except the rose water, by vigorous agitation until\r\na kind of emulsion results. Then add the rose water in small portions,\r\nshaking after each addition.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE ROSES.\r\n\r\n    Rose water               5 qts.\r\n    Oil of rose             75 grains.\r\n  Dissolve in\r\n    Alcohol                  3½ oz.\r\n  And add\r\n    Tincture of vanilla      1¾ oz.\r\n    Tincture of civet      150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Hair Tonics.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIR RESTORER.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of cantharides (see above, page 281)    1¾ oz.\r\n  Tincture of nut-galls                            1¾ oz.\r\n  Extract of musk                                150 grains.\r\n  Carmine                                         75 grains.\r\n  Alcohol                                          3½ oz.\r\n  Rose water                                       1 qt.\r\n\r\nTincture of nut-galls is made by macerating 3½ oz. of powdered\r\nnut-galls in one quart of alcohol. The tincture of cinchona in the\r\nfollowing formula is prepared in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANNO-QUININE HAIR RESTORER.\r\n\r\n  Tincture of cinchona     1¾ oz.\r\n  Tincture of nut-galls    1¾ oz.\r\n  Carmine                150 grains.\r\n  Oil of neroli           75 grains.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg           75 grains.\r\n  Alcohol                  3½ oz.\r\n  Rose water               1 qt.\r\n  Orange-flower water      1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAUME DE MILAN POUR LES CHEVEUX.\r\n\r\n  Lard                       1 lb.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond    1 lb.\r\n  Spermaceti                 1¾ oz.\r\n  Carmine                  150 grains.\r\n  Tincture of cantharides     ¾ oz.\r\n  Tincture of storax         1 oz.\r\n  Tincture of tolu           1 oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEARD PRODUCER.\r\n\r\n  Lard                       1 lb.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond    1 lb.\r\n  Spermaceti                  ¾ oz.\r\n  Cantharides                 ¾ oz.\r\n  Carmine                  150 grains.\r\n  Oil of bergamot           75 grains.\r\n  Oil of lavender           75 grains.\r\n  Oil of santal             75 grains.\r\n\r\nRub the cantharides with the carmine to the finest possible powder; add\r\nthis with the essential oils to the other ingredients.\r\n\r\nFormulas for similar hair tonics might be given to the number of\r\nseveral hundreds; but we repeat what we have said above—they do not\r\nproduce the desired result.\r\n\r\nWhile the well-known bay rum is used more as a face lotion or\r\nrefreshing skin tonic, particularly after shaving, or when perspiring\r\nin hot weather, yet it is also often used as a wash for the scalp,\r\nand is popularly believed to stimulate the growth of hair, which is\r\nin reality not the case. We shall therefore give a formula for its\r\npreparation here:\r\n\r\n\r\nBAY RUM.\r\n\r\n  Oil of bay (from Myrcia acris)  240 grains.\r\n  Oil of orange (bigarade)         16 grains.\r\n  Oil of Pimenta                   16 grains.\r\n  Alcohol                           1 qt.\r\n  Water                            25 fl. oz.\r\n\r\nDissolve the oils in the alcohol and add the water. Mix the liquid with\r\nabout 2 oz. of precipitated phosphate of lime, and filter. It will\r\nimprove by age.\r\n\r\nGenuine bay rum is imported from the West Indies (St. Thomas, etc.),\r\nwhere a crude kind of alcohol, obtained in connection with the\r\nmanufacture of rum from molasses, is distilled with the fresh leaves\r\nof the bay-tree (Myrcia acris). The oil of bay obtained from this must\r\nnot be confounded with the oil of sweet bay. The latter, as it appears\r\nin commerce, is a crude mixture of a fixed with a volatile oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nHAIR DYES AND DEPILATORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe custom of dyeing the hair is universal in the Orient; in the\r\nOccident, however, hair dyes are also frequently used, namely, to hide\r\nthe grayness of the hair, sometimes to give the hair a preferred color.\r\nHair dyes, which are very numerous, may be divided into groups—those\r\ncontaining the dye-stuff ready formed, and those in which it is\r\nproduced in the hair by some chemical process. Some hair dyes contain\r\nsubstances which in their nature are decidedly injurious to the hair;\r\nsuch articles, of course, must be dispensed with because, if frequently\r\nemployed, they would certainly lead to baldness. We shall return to\r\nthis subject in connection with the several preparations.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use of hair dyes, especially those consisting of two\r\nseparate portions, we may state that it is necessary to remove the fat\r\nfrom the hair before applying the dye, as the chemicals in question do\r\nnot adhere well to fat. The hair should be thoroughly washed once or\r\ntwice with soap, and dyed when nearly dry.\r\n\r\nWhen dyeing the hair the preparations should first be diluted; if the\r\ncolor is not deep enough, the process is repeated. If the preparation\r\nis used at once in a concentrated form, a color may result which has no\r\nresemblance to any natural tint; hair meant to be black may assume a\r\nmetallic bluish-black gloss.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Simple Hair Dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD HAIR DYE.\r\n\r\n  Oxide of lead      4 lb.\r\n  Quicklime          1 lb.\r\n  Calcined magnesia  1 lb.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients are rubbed to a very fine powder and for use are mixed\r\nwith water, applied to the hair, and left there until the desired\r\ntint—light brown to black—is obtained, from four to twelve hours, when\r\nthe powder is removed by washing. The lime by its caustic effect acts\r\ndestructively on the horny substance of the hair. Moreover, _all lead\r\npreparations_ without exception are _very injurious_ to the organism;\r\nhence this hair dye is to be rejected, especially as there are harmless\r\npreparations which produce the same effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nKARSI (TEINTURE ORIENTALE).\r\n\r\n  Ambergris       75 grains.\r\n  Nut-galls        4 lb.\r\n  Iron filings     1¾ oz.\r\n  Copper filings  30 grains.\r\n  Musk            30 grains.\r\n\r\nThis preparation, which really comes from the Orient, is made as\r\nfollows: Reduce the nut-galls to a very fine powder and roast them\r\nin an iron pan under continual stirring until they have become dark\r\nbrown or almost black. This powder is triturated with the metals in\r\nfine powder and the aromatics, and preserved in a moist place. For\r\nuse, some of the powder is moistened in the palm of the hand and\r\nvigorously rubbed into the hair; after a few days it assumes a deep\r\nblack, natural color. The roasting changes the tannin bodies contained\r\nin the galls into gallic and pyrogallic acids which form deep black\r\ncombinations with the metals, and themselves are easily transformed\r\ninto brownish-black substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOHOL (TEINTURE CHINOISE).\r\n\r\n  Gum arabic  1 oz.\r\n  India ink   1¾ oz.\r\n  Rose water  1 qt.\r\n\r\nPowder the ink and the gum, and triturate small quantities of the\r\npowder with rose water until a uniform black liquid results, which must\r\nbe free from granules. This liquid is placed in a bottle and the rest\r\nof the rose water added. Kohol can be used only by persons with black\r\nhair, and is employed particularly for dyeing the eyebrows. As the\r\ncoloring matter of this preparation consists of carbon in a state of\r\nfine division, the dye is perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE DYE.\r\n\r\n  Silver nitrate   2 oz.\r\n  Distilled water  1 qt.\r\n\r\nThis hair dye produces a deep black color, but cannot be recommended,\r\nas it is injurious to the hair. Its full effects appear only after the\r\nlapse of some hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM PERMANGANATE.\r\n\r\n  Potassium permanganate  5½ oz.\r\n  Distilled water         2 qts.\r\n\r\nCrystalline potassium permanganate is soluble in water, forming\r\na dark violet solution. When brought in contact with an organic\r\nsubstance—paper, linen, skin, horn, hair—it is rapidly decolored and\r\nimparts to the substances named a brown tint due to hydrated oxide of\r\nmanganese. The hair is washed, as stated above, to remove the fat, and\r\nthe dilute solution applied with a soft brush; the color is produced at\r\nonce and according to the degree of dilution this innocuous preparation\r\ncan be made to give any desired color from blond to very dark brown.\r\nOf course, this preparation can be used for the beard as well as the\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nAll the hair dyes here and elsewhere given stain the skin as well\r\nwherever they come in contact with it; hence care should be taken to\r\nprotect the skin during their application.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Double Hair Dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVER HAIR DYES.\r\n\r\nThis and similar hair dyes consist of two preparations, preserved in\r\nbottles I. and II.; the latter, containing the silver solution, should\r\nbe of dark amber-colored or black glass, as the silver salts are\r\ndecomposed by light. It is utterly useless to employ blue glass for\r\nthis purpose, as this admits the chemical rays of light as easily as\r\nflint glass. For use, some of the liquid from bottle I. is poured into\r\na cup and the hair is moistened with it by means of a soft brush. The\r\nliquid from bottle II. is poured into a second cup and applied with\r\nanother brush.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN DYE.\r\n\r\nI. (_In White Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Sulphide of potassium  7 oz.\r\n  Alcohol                1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (_In Dark Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Silver nitrate   4¼ oz.\r\n  Distilled water  1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK DYE.\r\n\r\nI. (_In White Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Sulphide of potassium   ½ lb.\r\n  Alcohol                1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (_In Dark Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Silver nitrate   5½ oz.\r\n  Distilled water  1 qt.\r\n\r\nThe sulphide of potassium (liver of sulphur) appears in fragments of a\r\nliver-brown mass which readily dissolves in water. The solution must be\r\nfiltered before being filled into bottles for sale, and, as it becomes\r\nturbid in the air, kept in well-closed vessels. When the two solutions\r\nare brought together, black sulphide of silver results and darkens\r\nthe hair. After the use of this preparation a disagreeable odor of\r\nrotten eggs adheres to the hair, but can be easily removed by washing,\r\nespecially with one of the previously mentioned hair washes.\r\n\r\nThe silver hair dye will be still better if the liquid contained in\r\nbottle II. is made by dropping into the solution, under continual\r\nstirring, ammonia water, until the precipitate first formed is again\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELANOGÈNE.\r\n\r\nI. (_In Dark Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Silver nitrate   150 grains.\r\n  Distilled water    2¾ oz.\r\n  Ammonia water      1 oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (_In White Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Pyrogallic acid  15 grains.\r\n  Alcohol of 40%    1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANNIN HAIR DYE.\r\n\r\nI. (_In White Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Powdered nut-galls  14 oz.\r\n  Water               1 pint.\r\n  Rose water          1 pint.\r\n\r\nBoil the nut-galls in the water, strain the boiling liquid through a\r\nthick cloth into the rose water, and fill the still hot mixture into\r\nbottles which must be immediately closed. (It is essential that the\r\nliquid be hot during the filling, to guard against the development of\r\nmould.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (_In Dark Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Silver nitrate   5½ oz.\r\n  Distilled water  1 qt.\r\n\r\nAdd ammonia water to the silver solution until the precipitate first\r\nformed is again dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU D’AFRIQUE.\r\n\r\nI. (_In Dark Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Silver nitrate   45 grains.\r\n  Distilled water  3½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (_In White Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Sulphide of sodium  120 grains.\r\n  Distilled water       3½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRINOCHROM.\r\n\r\nI. (_In White Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Pyrogallic acid  150 grains.\r\n  Distilled water    6¼ oz.\r\n  Alcohol            5¾ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (_In Dark Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Silver nitrate   180 grains.\r\n  Ammonia water      2 oz.\r\n  Distilled water   10½ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER HAIR DYE.\r\n\r\nI. (_In White Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Ferrocyanide of potassium  7 oz.\r\n  Distilled water            1 qt.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (_In Dark Bottle._)\r\n\r\n  Sulphate of copper  7 oz.\r\n  Distilled water     1 qt.\r\n\r\nAdd ammonia water to the copper solution until the light blue\r\nprecipitate first formed again dissolves to a rich, dark blue liquid.\r\nThis hair dye gives a dark brown color.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAU DE FONTAINE DE JOUVENCE,\r\n\r\nalso called Auricome and Golden Hair Water, is no dye, but a bleaching\r\nagent which changes dark hair to a light blond or golden-yellow\r\ncolor. The preparation consists of peroxide of hydrogen, a substance\r\npossessing marked bleaching properties.\r\n\r\nPeroxide of hydrogen, or hydrogen dioxide, is at the present time made\r\non a large scale by many manufacturers, and readily obtainable in the\r\nmarket. It would therefore scarcely pay any one to prepare it himself\r\nunless he were out of reach of the usual channels of trade, so that he\r\ncould not obtain the preparation in a _fresh_ state. Nevertheless it\r\nmay be useful to state how it is made. Barium dioxide (or peroxide),\r\nwhich is a regular article of commerce, and is a stable compound which\r\nwill keep for any length of time if kept in tightly closed bottles, is\r\ntreated with water until the dioxide forms with it a thin, smooth milk.\r\nThis is gradually added to dilute sulphuric acid, cooled with ice or\r\nkept otherwise as cold as possible, until the sulphuric acid is almost\r\nentirely neutralized. The solution is then allowed to settle and the\r\nclear liquid drawn off. For bleaching purposes, this is pure enough.\r\nOnly it must be ascertained that the amount of free acid present,\r\nwithout which the hydrogen dioxide does not keep well, is only small.\r\nOther acids can be used besides sulphuric, but the latter is the most\r\nconvenient. If an alkali is added to hydrogen dioxide so that the\r\nreaction becomes alkaline, it will decompose very rapidly. Even under\r\nthe most favorable circumstances (when acid, and kept in a cool place)\r\nit will gradually deteriorate, and finally be entirely converted into\r\noxygen gas, which escapes, and plain water.\r\n\r\nPeroxide or dioxide of hydrogen, when applied to the hair as a\r\nbleaching agent, must be used in a dilute condition at first. Those\r\nwho use it for the first time should always make preliminary trials\r\nwith the liquid upon odd bunches of hair (such as may at any time\r\nbe procured at hair-dressers’ shops) resembling that which is to be\r\nbleached, before actually applying it to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe hair to be bleached is deprived of fat by washing with soap\r\nsolution, the soap is washed out with water, and the peroxide of\r\nhydrogen applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHISKER DYE.\r\n\r\n  I.  Acetate of lead  1¾ oz.\r\n      Distilled water  1 pint.\r\n\r\n  II. Caustic potassa   ¾ oz.\r\n      Distilled water  1 qt.\r\n\r\nDissolve the acetate of lead (“sugar of lead”) in the warm water,\r\nfilter the solution, and add ammonia water until a precipitate ceases\r\nto form. Collect the precipitate on a filter, wash it by pouring\r\ndistilled water over it eight or ten times, and while still moist\r\nintroduce it into solution II. Stir repeatedly, and after twelve hours\r\nleave the vessel at rest until the solution has become clear. Then\r\ndecant it from the sediment, which may be treated a second time with\r\nsolution II. For use, the beard is washed with soap, and combed with a\r\nfine rubber comb dipped in the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Depilatories.\r\n\r\nCombinations of sulphur with the alkaline metals calcium, barium,\r\nand strontium rapidly destroy the hair; for this reason tanners use\r\nthe “gas lime” from gas works, which contains calcium sulphide, for\r\nremoving the hair from hides. All the depilatories used cosmetically,\r\neven rhusma employed in the Orient for removing the beard, owe their\r\nactivity to the presence of calcium sulphide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCIUM SULPHIDE\r\n\r\nhas usually been lauded as a perfectly harmless depilatory. This is\r\na great mistake, however, since it has often done serious harm,\r\nthrough careless application by persons unfamiliar with its caustic\r\nand corrosive effects. It is absolutely necessary to protect the\r\n_skin_ against its action; otherwise superficial irritation, or even\r\ndestruction of the skin may result.\r\n\r\nCalcium sulphide cannot be made by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nupon lime. It is usually made by heating at a low red heat, in a\r\nsecurely closed crucible, an intimate mixture of 100 parts of finely\r\npowdered quicklime with 90 parts of precipitated sulphur. Mix together:\r\n\r\n  Calcium sulphide    4 oz.\r\n  Sugar               2 oz.\r\n  Water               2 oz.\r\n  Starch powder       2 oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon       30 grains.\r\n  Oil of peppermint  10 grains.\r\n\r\nThe resulting mass must be filled at once into an air-tight jar, as\r\nthe calcium sulphide is decomposed in the atmosphere. For use, some\r\nof the mass is moistened with water, painted on the skin, and washed\r\noff with water after thirty to forty-five minutes. This and all other\r\ndepilatories act only temporarily, that is, they destroy only the hair\r\nprojecting above the surface without killing the hair bulbs; after some\r\ntime the hair grows again and the preparation must be reapplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARIUM SULPHIDE,\r\n\r\nwhich is likewise used as a depilatory, is made by heating barium\r\nsulphate with charcoal, extracting the residue with water, and mixing\r\nthe resulting product with starch paste. In its effects barium sulphide\r\nequals the preceding preparation, but it decomposes more readily.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPILATORY PASTE.\r\n\r\n  Powdered caustic lime   2 lb.\r\n  Starch powder           2 lb.\r\n  Sodium sulphide        21 oz.\r\n\r\nSodium sulphide is made by saturating strong caustic soda solution with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. The other ingredients are added to the solution\r\nof sodium sulphide.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUSMA\r\n\r\nis a depilatory made by mixing powdered quicklime (unslaked) with\r\norpiment (yellow sulphide of arsenic). Take of:\r\n\r\n  Quicklime   4 lb.\r\n  Orpiment   10½ oz.\r\n\r\nMix intimately and preserve the powder in tightly closed vessels. For\r\nuse, take some of the powder, reduce it to a thin paste with water,\r\nand apply it to the place upon which the hairs are to be destroyed.\r\nOwing to its poisonousness and the destructive effects of the caustic\r\nlime on the skin, this preparation should never be employed in cosmetic\r\nperfumery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nWAX POMADES, BANDOLINES, AND BRILLIANTINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe so-called wax pomades, stick pomatum, and bandolines serve to\r\nstiffen the hair and are frequently employed by hair dressers. The\r\nformer two articles possess some adhesive power by which they fasten\r\nthe hair together; bandolines are mucilaginous fluids which generally\r\ncontain bassorin (or vegetable mucilage present in tragacanth), quince\r\nseeds, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Wax Pomades.\r\n\r\nSTICK POMATUM.\r\n\r\nThis is usually formed into oval or round sticks which are wrapped\r\nin tin foil. They are colored and perfumed as desired. The ordinary\r\nvarieties are: white, for light blond hair, which is left uncolored;\r\npink, colored with carmine; brown, colored with umber; and black,\r\ncolored with bone black. The coloring matters are always rubbed up with\r\noil. Red pomatum may be colored with alkanet root, which is macerated\r\nfor some time with the melted fat. The base of these preparations\r\nconsists of:\r\n\r\n  Lard     4 lb.\r\n  Tallow  12 lb.\r\n  Wax      6 lb.\r\n\r\nThe mass may be made harder or softer by increasing or diminishing the\r\nwax. The perfumes generally used are oils of bergamot, lemon, clove,\r\nand thyme, with an addition of some Peru balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Beard Wax.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEARD WAX (CIRE À MOUSTACHES).\r\n\r\n  Turpentine               2 lb.\r\n  Expressed oil of almond  2 lb.\r\n  Wax                      6 lb.\r\n  Violet pomade            2 lb.\r\n  Peru balsam              1 lb.\r\n  Oil of clove             1 oz.\r\n  Oil of santal             ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of cinnamon           ¾ oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARIAN BEARD WAX (CIRE À MOUSTACHE HONGROISE.)\r\n\r\n  Castile soap, powdered   3½ oz.\r\n  Mucilage of acacia      10 oz.\r\n  White wax                9 oz.\r\n  Glycerin                 3½ oz.\r\n  Oil of bergamot         20 drops.\r\n  Oil of lemon            10 drops.\r\n  Oil of rose             10 drops.\r\n\r\nRub the powdered soap with the mucilage, previously diluted with nine\r\nounces of water, then add the wax and glycerin, and heat the mass on a\r\nwater-bath, stirring constantly, until it becomes homogeneous. Lastly\r\nadd the oils, and pour the mass into suitable moulds.\r\n\r\nFor brown or black wax the corresponding color is added. The mass is\r\nformed into sticks the thickness of a lead pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Bandolines.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANDOLINE AUX AMANDES.\r\n\r\n  Tragacanth            14 oz.\r\n  Rose water             8 qts.\r\n  Oil of bitter almond    ¾ oz.\r\n\r\nCrush the tragacanth, place it in the rose water, and leave it at rest\r\nin a warm spot, stirring occasionally, until the tragacanth has swollen\r\nto a slimy mass. Press it first through a coarse and then through a\r\nfiner cloth, add a little carmine and the oil of bitter almond.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANDOLINE À LA ROSE.\r\n\r\nThis is made like the preceding, only substituting 1½ oz. of oil of\r\nrose for the oil of bitter almond. Other varieties may be produced by\r\nthe use of different odors.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Brillantines.\r\n\r\nUnder various names preparations are placed on the market which render\r\nthe hair both soft and glossy. The chief constituent of all these\r\narticles is glycerin which is perfumed according to taste and stained\r\nreddish or violet. As many aniline colors easily dissolve in glycerin,\r\nthey are generally used for this purpose. Formerly, before glycerin\r\nwas obtainable in sufficient purity, brillantines were chiefly made of\r\ncastor oil dissolved in alcohol, but aside from the fact that glycerin\r\nis cheaper than castor oil with alcohol, the former is preferable, as\r\nalcohol injures the hair.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRILLANTINE.\r\n\r\n  Glycerin                              8 lb.\r\n  Extract of jasmine (or other flower)  2 qts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLÉOLISSE.\r\n\r\n  Glycerin           4 lb.\r\n  Castor oil         4 lb.\r\n  Oil of bergamot     ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of lemon        ¾ oz.\r\n  Oil of neroli    150 grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE COLORS USED IN PERFUMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn perfumes in which next to the odor, the appearance is of importance,\r\nthe colors play a prominent part.\r\n\r\nIn handkerchief perfumes, any accidental color present is an obstacle,\r\nas it would cause stains on the material. Hence the aim is to obtain\r\nthe perfumes colorless or—a highly prized quality in fine articles—they\r\nreceive a pale green color which disappears on drying. Extract of\r\ncassie possesses this color, and in many cases this extract is added to\r\nperfumes for the purpose of giving them this favorite color.\r\n\r\nRegarding the colors employed for other articles—emulsions, pomades,\r\nsoaps, etc.—it may be stated as a general rule that a preparation named\r\nafter a certain flower must possess the color of the latter. Hence all\r\nperfumes named after the rose should be rose red; violet perfumes,\r\nviolet; those bearing the name of the lily or white rose must be\r\ncolorless, etc.\r\n\r\nThe best for articles containing alcohol or glycerin are the aniline\r\ncolors, both on account of their beautiful appearance and their\r\nextraordinary staining power. But an insurmountable obstacle is met\r\nwith in their use for articles containing animal or vegetable fats\r\nwhich rapidly destroy many aniline colors. When a rose pomade is\r\ncolored with aniline red, the fine delicate tint hardly lasts three or\r\nfour weeks and changes into dirty gray. The same is true of aniline\r\nviolet in violet pomade, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, articles containing fat must receive other dye-stuffs, and\r\nin the following pages we briefly enumerate those we have found most\r\nappropriate; but it must be observed that all poisonous dyes must be\r\nabsolutely excluded. Commercial aniline colors formerly often contained\r\narsenic; at the present time other processes are usually employed for\r\ntheir preparation, not involving the employment of arsenious acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW COLORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saffron._\r\n\r\nThe stigmata of Crocus sativus contain a bright yellow or orange yellow\r\ncoloring matter which is easily extracted by alcohol, petroleum ether,\r\nor fat. We prefer petroleum ether in which the finely powdered saffron\r\nis macerated, the greater portion of the solvent being distilled off,\r\nand the rest of the solution is allowed to evaporate, when the pure\r\ncoloring matter is left and can be easily mixed with fat. The coloring\r\nmatter may also be obtained by macerating the saffron in melted lard or\r\nin olive oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jonquille Pomade._\r\n\r\nGenuine jonquille pomade, from Narcissus Jonquilla, has a handsome\r\nyellow color which is derived from the dark yellow flowers; for this\r\nreason small quantities of jonquille pomade are sometimes used for\r\ncoloring pomades for the hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curcuma or Turmeric._\r\n\r\nCurcuma or turmeric root contains a very beautiful yellow coloring\r\nmatter which is easily extracted by alcohol or petroleum ether. We\r\nprepare it in the same manner as stated under the head of saffron.\r\nCurcuma color cannot be used for articles containing free alkali, which\r\nchanges it to brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Palm Oil._\r\n\r\nhas naturally a fine yellow color, which it imparts also to soaps\r\nprepared from it; but the color fades completely when the wet soap is\r\nexposed to the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED COLORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carmine._\r\n\r\nThis magnificent, though very expensive color is obtained from the\r\ncochineal insect, Coccus cacti. If good carmine is not available, a\r\nsubstitute may be made, for the purpose of coloring perfumery articles,\r\nby powdering cochineal, treating it with dilute caustic ammonia, and,\r\nafter adding some alum solution, exposing it to the air and direct\r\nsunlight, when the coloring matter separates in handsome red flakes,\r\nwhich are collected and dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carthamin Red._\r\n\r\nSafflower, the blossoms of Carthamus tinctorius, contains two coloring\r\nmatters, yellow and red. The former is extracted with water from the\r\ndried flowers, and the residue is treated with a weak soda solution\r\nwhich dissolves the red coloring matter. When this solution is\r\ngradually diluted with acetic acid, the dye is precipitated, and after\r\ndrying forms a mass with a greenish metallic lustre. This, when reduced\r\nto powder, is used for rouge en feuilles or rouge en tasses.\r\n\r\nThis coloring matter can also be prepared by introducing into the soda\r\nsolution some clean white cotton on which the color is precipitated and\r\ncan then be extracted with alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alkanet._\r\n\r\nThis root, which is readily obtained in the market, contains a\r\nbeautiful red coloring matter which can be extracted with petroleum\r\nether, but is also easily soluble in fats (melted lard or warm oil).\r\nEven small amounts of it produce a handsome rose red and larger\r\nquantities a dark purple. For pomades, hair oils, and emulsions alkanet\r\nroot is the best coloring matter, as it stains them rapidly, is\r\nlasting, and cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rhatany._\r\n\r\nRhatany root furnishes a reddish-brown coloring matter which is\r\nsoluble in alcohol and is extracted with it from the comminuted root,\r\nespecially for tooth tinctures and mouth washes. For the same purpose\r\nuse may also be made of red santal wood and Pernambuco wood which\r\nlikewise yield to alcohol, besides astringents, beautiful colors which\r\nare very suitable for such preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN COLORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chlorophyll._\r\n\r\nThe green coloring matter of leaves is easily extracted from them,\r\nwhen bruised, with alcohol, and is left behind after the evaporation\r\nof the solvent. Some powders which are to have a green color are mixed\r\ndirectly with dried and finely divided bright green leaves such as\r\nspinach, celery, parsley leaves, etc.\r\n\r\nFor soap it is customary to use a mixture of yellow and blue which\r\ntogether produce a green color. Take a yellow soap, melt it, and add\r\nto it the finest powder of smalt or ultramarine until the desired tint\r\nis obtained. Indigo-carmine cannot be used, as it would impart a blue\r\ncolor to the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE COLORS.\r\n\r\nFor many preparations smalt or ultramarine is employed, but these\r\ncolors are insoluble. The only soluble blue colors are aniline blue and\r\nindigo-carmine; the latter has a beautiful and intense color, but is\r\nsuitable only for pomades and not for soaps because, as stated above,\r\nit would stain the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET\r\n\r\nis produced by a mixture of red and blue in due proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN\r\n\r\nis produced by caramel, which is made by heating sugar in an iron pot\r\nuntil it changes into a deep black mass which is brown only in thin\r\nthreads. This color dissolves easily in water (not in alcohol) and is\r\nvery suitable for soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK\r\n\r\nis produced by finely divided vegetable or bone black. Liquids are\r\ncolored with India ink which remains suspended for a long time owing to\r\nthe fine division of the carbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE UTENSILS USED IN THE TOILET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the toilet, besides combs and hair brushes, use is made of powder\r\npuffs, tooth brushes, and bath sponges. Powder puffs are made from swan\r\nskins, but should be used rather for the even division of the powder or\r\npaint than for its application. For the latter purpose a piece of soft\r\nglove or chamois leather is best.\r\n\r\nThe commercial tooth brushes are almost without exception objectionable\r\nowing to the stiffness of the bristles. A suitable tooth brush should\r\nbe made of very soft, flexible bristles, lest it wear away the enamel.\r\n\r\nParticular attention should be devoted to bath sponges. Their value\r\nis proportionate to the fineness of the pores, their softness and\r\nelasticity, and their spherical shape. Crude sponges are best cleansed\r\nby being placed in dilute hydrochloric acid which dissolves the\r\ncalcareous particles adhering to them.\r\n\r\nThey are bleached as follows.\r\n\r\nFree them as far as possible from sand and other foreign matters. Then\r\nwash them thoroughly with water, and press them. Next introduce them\r\ninto a solution of permanganate of potassium containing one ounce of\r\nthe salt in a gallon; leave them in this liquid two or three minutes;\r\nthen take them out, express the liquid (which can be several times\r\nused over again), wash them with water until no more violet-tinted\r\nliquid runs from them, and then immerse them in a solution of one\r\npart of hyposulphite of sodium in twenty parts of water, to which\r\nimmediately before dipping the sponges one part of hydrochloric acid\r\nhas been added. When the sponge’s are white, remove them and wash them\r\nthoroughly with water.\r\n\r\nAfter prolonged use, bath sponges lose their elasticity and softness.\r\nThese properties can be restored by dipping the sponges into a mixture\r\nof one part by measure of glycerin and eight parts of water, pressing\r\nout the excess of the liquid and allowing them to dry. The small\r\nquantity of glycerin which they contain prevents their hardening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  À la mode perfume, 186\r\n\r\n  Absorption, 101\r\n\r\n  Acacia farnesiana,
